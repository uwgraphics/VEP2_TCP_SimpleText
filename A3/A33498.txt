departure out of this Life.

Concerning our Dear Friend AND BROTHER (In the Holy-Vnion of Divine-Love)
JOSIAH COAL, Thus it arises in my heart to write.
THE Holy wise Omnipotent God, having by his Power appeared, and manifested
himself unto a Remnant of People, in the North parts of England, who were
scattered up and down the Barren Mountains, seeking rest, but finding none; the
Lord in a wonderful manner did break in upon them, and by his Power did rend
the Vail of Darkness that was over them, and did Purge and Purify them; and
after he had thus fitted, and prepared a People for his Praise, his Power moved
strongly in the Hearts of many, and his Pure Love constrained them, to leave
dear and near Relations, to declare unto others what the Lord had done for
their Souls; in the Year 1654. several of God's faithful Servants, were moved
of their Master and Lord, to travel into the Southern Parts of England, and
some into the Western Parts. The chief of which that were the first Proclaimers
of this Heavenly Message in and about Bristol, were these two true and faithful
Servants of God John Audland, and John Came; by whose powerful Ministry many
were convinced, and turned from Darkness to Light, and from Satan's Power to
God; amongst whom was our dear Brother Josiah Coal; The Powerful Word of Life
(declared and preached by God's Servant John Audland) did pierce and break his
Heart, and took deep root in him, and wrought effectually to his Salvation and
Redemption: He was for a Time under deep Judgment, and walked mournfully many
a day, whereby he became a Wonder, and a gazeing-Stock, unto those that were
his former Acquaintance; and he, amongst the rest of the Lord's People, was
Reproached, and Mocked, Reviled, and Persecuted; but God's Arm that was
revealed and made bear was strong, and wrought powerfully in him, and rent the
Vail of Darkness, and plucked up the Weeds and evil Plants, which the Enemy had
sown in his Heart, and purified and purged his Vessel, making it fit for the
Lord's use: So the Lord opened the Spring of Life and Fountain of Love in his
Soul, which gave him full satisfaction, and caused his Cup to overflow; and
being thus Translated out of the Kingdom of Darkness, into the Kingdom of the
dear Son of God, passing through the Ministration of Condemnation, bearing
daily the Cross of Christ, he obtained Life and Salvation through the Grace of
Christ that wrought in him, and being made Partaker of the Divine Nature, and
the Love of God shed abroad in his Heart (the nature of which makes the Heart
tender) by its Virtue and Power he was moved and constrained to leave his
Fathers House, and his near and dear Relations, and Native Country, and
traveled by Sea through many Dangers, and preached the Gospel in many of the
Western Islands, and in Maryland, and Virginia; from whence he passed through
the Wilderness on foot, many hundreds of Miles, to New England, amongst those
cruel and bloody Professors, who drunk the Blood of four of the Lord's Servants
(only for their pure Testimony and Worship of God, which Blood the Lord will
require at their Hands) he preached the Gospel freely, going a warfare at his
own charge; and the Presence of the Lord did accompany him, and by his powerful
Ministry many were convinced, and turned to the Lord: After his long Travels in
several Places and Islands beyond the Seas, he came over into his own Native
Country (old England) where he labored much in the Work and Service of the
Lord, in several Countries, and was dearly beloved, and well accepted of by all
that had a true savor of God. After some time here in England, spent chiefly
in the Work of God, he traveled again by Sea into the several Islands, and
Plantations, to visit the tender Seed of God, raised by his Power, and to water
the tender Plants, which the Lord by his own Right Hand had planted; and the
good presence of God was with him, and did support him in his Exercises and
Trials, and brought him back safe into his own Country, though his outward man
was much spent, and weakened by his sore Travels and Exercises, as many of his
dear Friends were sensible of, and often told him of it; but his Heart was bent
to go on in the Work and Service of the Lord, being willing to spend, and be
spent in so weighty and good a Work as the Lord had called him to, it being his
Meat and Drink to do the Will of his Father: He suffered Imprisonment for the
Testimony of Jesus, which he held, in several Places in England, as in
Launcston in Cornwel, in Bristol, in Kendal, in West-moorland, and several
times in London; in all which he was found faithful, and did never yield to the
fawning Flatteries of men; but did wait in patience till the Lord did make way
for his deliverance. He was endued with a good Measure of the Heavenly Power
and Wisdom of God, which made him bold and valient for the Truth; and often
times full of Heavenly Majesty in his Declaration, which did wound and pierce
the Hearts of many, and made them bow before the Lord, and confess to the Truth
which he preached: Those that were intimately acquainted with him, found him to
be of a tender spirit, and of a sweet loving disposition; greatly delighting in
the Union and Society of his Brethren, having an honorable esteem of those
that were in Christ before him. Toward the latter end of the ninth Month
1668. he began to be ill in Body; but being of a strong spirit, he kept over it
for some time; till at last he was forced to keep his Chamber for some weeks,
in which time, he was much refreshed with the Life and Power of God, which did
arise in him, to the comfort and refreshment of those that did tend him: in the
midst of his bodily weakness and exercises, he was raised again for a little
time, and walked abroad; but soon after (the cause of his distemper remaining)
he was brought down again, and his strength passed away by degrees, until a
Period was put to his days; he was full of love even to the last, and his Heart
was broken and melted before the Lord; and many times broke forth and praised
the Lord, and declared much of the goodness of God unto him, which did ever
melt and tender the Hearts of those that heard him; he passed away like a Lamb,
without the least Sigh or Groan, even as One falling into a sweet Sleep, and so
is at rest with the Lord, and the Lamb, and all the holy Angels and Saints; and
shall rest in peace and joy forevermore (and to convince the Reader, that these
things testified of him, are true) (as many living Witnesses can seal to the
same) look over his own Writings, and read over his several Epistles, written
to the Churches at several times, and upon several Occasions, which are
gathered together and presented to thy view, and if thou have any true spiritual
sense in thee, thou will feel and discern that such sweet and pleasant Streams
must needs flow from a sweet and good Fountain, knowing that one Fountain does
not send forth sweet and bitter Water; therefore the Streams being sweet, the
Fountain (or Well from whence they spring) is sweet also; and he having drunk
deep draughts of the Water (that Christ gives) it became in him a Well of
Living Water, springing up into Eternal Life, according to the saying of Christ
our Savior: Whosoever shall drink of the Water that I give it shall be in him
a Well of Living Water, springing up into Eternal Life. And that this was true
in him, is attested unto by one, who had large experience of his Integrity, and
Holy Zeal for God; who has been often in travels with him, and still is a
Labourer in the Lord's Vineyard, desiring and praying to Almighty God, that
the scattered Sheep may be gathered into the Fold of the good Shepherd; That so
there may be one Sheepfold, and one Shepherd.

A TESTIMONY Concerning Josiah Coal.
AS concerning our dear Friend and Brother Josiah Coal, I having had a certain
knowledge of him, and his Life, from that Conversation we had many times
together in the Service of the Lord, and living Society of the Holy Spirit; I
have this Testimony to give of him.

That he was a Man endued with an heavenly and effectual Gift, and therein was
enlarged and increased as a Reward upon him, after his sore Travels and Labor
in the Gospel beyond Seas; and he had a real love and estimation of his
Brethren in the Service and Work of the Lord, and delighted in their Fellowship
and Communion, being often refresht thereby. His faithfulness was manifested to
God, and to his People, amongst whom he labored; he was freely given up to
improve his Gift in the Heavenly Calling wherewith he was called, to spend and
to be spent for the Gospel's sake (wherein he had his reward) counting nothing
too dear of Life, Relation, or Estate, to resign up in and for that Service,
wherein he manifested both his Commission and Power to be of God, and not of
man, for the gathering out of Darkness, false Ways, and Worships, emty
Professions, and vain Traditions of men, into the Light, and Living way of
Truth, that therein they might serve and worship God in Spirit, which admits of
no confidence in the Flesh, nor products thereof.

He was a Man of a tender spirit, having a reverent esteem of his faithful
Brethren and elders in the Truth, and he had a tender care to preserve Unity,
and Brotherly Love; as also the sense he had of his reward, made him cheerful
in his Service, and fervent in spirit, and zealous in his Testimonies against
all false and deceitful spirits, which slight and dis-esteem Truth, and lead
into Apostasy from the Unity and Fellowship of the Gospel, whose ways do not
tend to Peace, but Strife, and Self-separation.

He fervently preached the Cross of Christ, and pressed the necessity of
obedience through it, and unto watchfulness in the fear of God: He preached
Faith in the Power of God, and the Righteousness thereof, not to stand in the
wisdom of man, nor in lifeless Professions, or traditional Opinions, nor yet to
consist in self acting, and voluntary humility, but in Spirit and Life, from
which living Obedience and Righteousness naturally spring; by which Testimony
and Preaching he was instrumental to affect the Hearts of many with the
excellency of the Truth, as it is in Jesus; and turn many thereunto, even from
Darkness unto Light, and from Satan's Power to God, that they might both
receive Remission of sin, and Possession of Life Eternal: And as he had freely
received of Christ, so he freely gave, and as he was freely given up to spend,
and to be spent for the Lord; so he spared not of his outward Substance in his
Service, his care being such (to cut off occasions from such as seek them, and
so to keep the Gospel without charge, as that he many times would not use his
power and freedom which Christ allowed his Ministers in that case, as mentioned
in Luke, Chap. 10. Verse 7. but with the Apostle Paul debased himself, that he
might not prove chargable to the Churches, and indeed, he went much a warfare
at his own charges, giving freely up, both his Liberty and Life for the
promotion of the Gospel of Truth, both in this, and other Nations through many
Hazards and difficulties, particularly of late years in this City of London;
wherein the blessed effects of his Labors, Travels, and Sufferings are felt
and known by many.

And as he lived in and by the Faith of God's Elect, so with him to live was
Christ, and to dye a Gain; who being outwardly spent for the Gospel sake, was
inwardly renewed by the Virtue of the same, whereby having conquered Death and
the Grave, he cheerfully embraced his Dissolution, and changed for a full and
perpetual Enjoyment of that Joy and Reward of Life and Glory, which he had long
an Earnest and Evidence of in himself; and in the fullness of which his Soul now
rests, and lives for evermore; Yea, his life is felt in the heavenly Society;
and though he being dead, yet speaks in him, in whom he died, who is his
Resurrection and Life for evermore.

G. W.

A Short TETIMONY OF The Life, Death, and Ministry of that Faithful Servant of
the LORD Josiah Coal;
THough I knew him not from the beginning, yet I knew him in that which has
neither beginning of Days, nor end of Life, which is the Eternal Power of God;
that by which he was separated from the World, and made an able, powerful and
faithful Minister of the everlasting Gospel of Christ Jesus our Lord, and which
in all Travels, Trials and Sufferings that did attend him, made him more then
Conqueror, to the glorifying of the Name of the Lord in the sight of his
Enemies, and to the replenishing of his Soul with Divine Consolations.

In the Eternal Light I knew him, and had often and sweet Fellowship with him
therein to my great refreshment, even in the gloomy and dark day of my early
and deep Exercises; and though he was a man free in his disposition, and ready
to help all through the tenderness of his spirit, yet was he endued with sound
Judgment, to the discerning of spirits, and giving no liberty to the Flesh; but
was dreadful in his Testimony against the Life, Glory and Customs of the World
(being redeemed therefrom, and made a Witness through Judgment of that pure
Spirit of Glory, which was before the World began, which vails and darkens the
beauty of Flesh, and gathers into Purity, and Self-denial through the
Sanctifying operation of the same) I had intimacy with him above many; but so
mixed was his kindness with seriousness, and his familiarity with a stayed, and
examplary Behavior, as he was ever an honor to the Truth, and therein a
confirmer of his holy Testimony, and weaker Brethren.

He was an incessant Labourer in the Gospel, and Few more spent in its Service;
his Soul seemed wholly bent to the Renowning of it, and its Enemies he ever
accounted his: His Declaration was to the Ungodly World like an Ax, an Hammer,
or a Sword, sharp and piercing, being mostly attended with an eminent
appearance of the dreadful Power of the Lord, to the cutting down of many a
tall Cedar, and to the making of many lofty Oaks to bow; but to the Faithful
and diligent (who mind the things of Christ more then their own) O the soft and
pleasant Streams of Life Immortal, that have run through him to the refreshing
of those the Lord's Heritage; yea, 'twas his life and joy to be speaking the
Word of the Lord, and not his own: And many thousands doubtless rest behind,
who are living Testimonies to the Power, Virtue, and Efficacy of his Ministry;
but above all terrible was he to the Sowers of Strife, secret Back-biters, and
such as rend the holy Body, and separate from the Life, Love, and Fellowship of
the Blessed Truth: Who in their own selfish spirit set themselves over the holy
Brethren, by feignedness and deceitful appearances, to the betraying of the
Simple-hearted, and ketching the Innocent in their Snares.

Yet was he ready to reach out an helping Hand to save the upright Hearted,
whose desires were to the Lord, and the Fellowship of the Faithful: He was
Hardy, Valiant, and fixed, not of those that shun the Cross, or sell their
Birthright for a Mess of Pottage. He baulkt no Danger for the sake of his
blessed Testimony, but ever met in the Lord's Armor, by which he has many
times overcome in England, Holland, Barbados, Virginia, New England,
Maryland, etc. where through many difficulties, he boldly preached the
everlasting Gospel, Christ in him the Hope of Glory.

He was a good Example, as well for his Liberality as Faithfulness; for as I am
a Witness, that the prosperity of God's Truth (and dear Friends) was above all
things most in his Eye; so was he always cautious of making the Gospel
chargeable to any; but having some Estate of his own he freely employed it in
the Lord's Service, counting nothing too dear for the Name and Service of the
Lord.

And thus having labored his natural strength away, in this heavenly Warfare,
for the promotion of the glorious Truth of the Lord, and the advancment of its
Interest and Dominion in the World (for about twelve Years together) (he did
with perfect understanding, and in an extraordinary enjoyment of the Lord's
Life, Majesty and Presence (to the refreshment of the Beholders) on the 15th of
the 11th Month 1668. he cheerfully laid down his Mortal Body (it being in the
five and thirtieth Year of his Age) that he might be perfectly clothed on,
with Blessed Immortallity, which is the Wages of the Work, and the Eternal
Recompense of his Temporal Tribulations.

And now is he truly ascended above and beyond every Trouble, and Temptation,
where all Tears are wiped away from his Eyes, and upon Mount Zion does he
stand, amongst the rest of our holy Brethren, and those Martyrs (who kept the
Testimony of Jesus in their day) singing the Song of the Lamb for evermore.

Therefore shall his Memorial remain as a sweet Ointment with the Righteous,
and time shall never blot him out of their remembrance; for amongst the
Worthies shall he be reckoned in the Generations to come, because he loved not
his Life unto Death, but chos'd to pass through the many Tribulations, which
have given him an entrance into the Everlasting Rest, where his spirit lives
and remains with God for ever.

My Soul is often heavy, and bowed down in the sense of the loss of these
Valiants, at this time of the day; but herein am I satisfied, that our God that
raised them, will fill up their places, and daily bring forth by his Eternal
Arm, many noble Champions for his Glory, who shall sound forth his Wonders to
the Ends of the Earth, and stand as Saviors (upon Mount Zion) to the Nations.

And therefore woes to the dark hellish sin-pleasing persecuting Priests,
Professors, and Profane, of the whole Earth; for the Lord God Omnipotent is
taking to himself his great Power, and he will Reign whose Kingdom stands in
Righteousness, and is an Everlasting Kingdom, and of whose Government and
Dominion there shall be no end.

AN EPISTLE TO THE READER, As Concerning Josiah Coal.
HE did labor much in the Power of the Lord, and did stand in the Power of the
Lord against the spirit of the World, and against all the Opposers of the Truth
to his dying day; yea within one Hour and a half of his death (see his
Testimony against the dark blasphemous spirit of Muggleton, in the latter end
of this Book) and besides the several Opposers of the Truth, of the several
Sects in New England, Barbados, Virginia, Maryland, and other Islands; and
the several Cruel and Inhumane Sufferings, and Imprisonments by the chief
Priests, Professors, and Rulers) which would be to large to mention, and would
make a great Volumn, that he suffered amongst them: And also his sore Travels
among the Heathen in America, concerning the Truth, and preaching the Gospel;
and when the cruel murdering Priests and Professors of New England, which
Murdered, and Martyred, and Spoiled so many of the Goods of our Friends, and
burned some of them with their hot Irons, and cut off the Ears of some of our
Friends for the Truth and Gospel's sake. These New England persecuting
Professors said to some that they did persecute; Why did not our Friends come
through the Heathen by Land, from Virginia to New England, through the Wilderness
on foot; for they looked for Miracles: but Josiah Coal and another, was that
very Time passing through the Heathen, and the Wilderness, from Virginia to
New England: and the persecuting Professors of New England, then did not think
that they were so near them, that did pass through the Woods and Wildernesses,
which immediately came among them: having passed through the Woods, and wild
Wildernesses, and through the danger of the Men-Eaters, and wild Beasts, and
venomous Creatures; but when they came through much Hunger, and Cold, and
Weariness, through the Bogs and Waters into New England, they found worss
entertainment among the New England persecuting Priests and Professers, then
they had found among the wild and venomous Beasts, and Men-eaters; yea, they
were worss to them, and others of the Disciples of Christ (as I said) then the
Heathen and Men-eaters; who had passed through much danger of their lives, and
often times were fain to cut down Chest-Nut-Trees, for the Nuts for Food, when
they were hungry: And nevertheless when these came immediately upon the blind
persecuting Professors in New England, these Professors were in as much
Unbelief, as ever they were before; as it may appear more at large in the
Record of New-England's Persecutions; And also this Josiah Coale's Labor and
Travels in Holland, and in the Low Countries, concerning the Gospel of God, and
his Truth; where ever he came he did bear his Testimony against that spirit
that did oppose the Truth, and he did live to see much of it over-thrown: And
also when this Josiah Coal was weak, the Power of the Lord was fresh in him,
and a little before he died, I spoke to him, that the Friends that were with
him, might go forth of the Room, for I had something to say to him, and when
they were gone, I asked him, if that he was clear, or whether any thing did lie
upon him to write to Friend in England, or any other Parts of the World beyond
the Seas to Friends; and he said, that he was clear of writing to them, and how
that the Lord by his Power and Majesty, had carried him through England, and
other Nations, and so he had nothing to write; but desired his love might be
remembered to all the Friends, and said, that one thing did lie upon him: He did
understand that I had a Book in answer to Muggleton, and that when he was gone,
Muggleton and his Company would boast against him; wherefore he desired that I
would put a few words of his last Testimony against Muggleton in my Book, and I
bade him to write them out, for I was to go to see a Friend hard by, and would
come to him presently again, and at that time as he was sitting in his Chair by
the fire, he spoke them forth in the Power of the Lord God, as fresh as if he
had ayled nothing, and a Friend took it in writing; which Testimony is inserted
in the latter Part of this Book (as is before noted) After this was done,
Josiah Coal desired me to pray, that he might have an easy passage; and when
I came to him again, he was sitting by the fire as before, in the Power of the
Lord, and full of it; and after seeing him to begin to be haevy, I bade him to
go and lie on the Bed, which he did, and with Friends help rose up again, and
sat on the side of the Bed, and Friends sat about him, and healed him; and I
went to him, and healed him, and he was full of the Power of the Lord, and his
Seed and Life, that was over all; and so in that he departed away in the Arms
of Friends, as he sat on the side of his Bed; and had a very easy passage
through the Life in which he remains. His Age when he died was 35. Years and
two Months, and he was in the Service of the Lord, preaching his Gospel about
twelve Years, and did convince many to the Lord's Truth, and brought many from
the vain Rudiments of the World to the Gospel. You may see some of his Epistles
and Writings in this following Book, which he left in writing, being carefully
copied out, and placed together; which is but some of what he has written, and
spoken.

A few Lines concerning Josiah Coal.
IS dear Josiah gone? yes, he is gone;
He Is gone from us, in the Eternal One:
Where he from all his Labor is at Rest,
In The Bosom of the Father, who is forever Blessed.
Ah Valiant Champion for God's Truth, so pure,
Thy Name's as precious Ointment, thy Memory shall dure
In upright Hearts, from them nothing can hide
Thy Worth; thy Faithfulness shall still abide,
To their Refreshment, though thy Body's laid
In The Bowels of the Earth; yet as thou said,
God's Majesty was with thee, and the Crown
Of Immortal Life is on thee; and that will renown
Thy Name to Generations, yet unborn,
When they shall hear, Josiah did adorn
The Gospel of our Lord by Doctrine that was sound,
Within his Native Land; ye he was found
In foreign Islands, spreading forth the Fame
Of his beloved Lord: and that his Name
Might be advanced, thought no Travel long;
Let God be Magnified, that was his Song:
His Travels they were sore, within, and eke without:
His Recompense was large; yes, there is no doubt.
Now he shines as a Star, of no small magnitude,
Who, by the Power of God, has convinced a Multitude.
Many are the Children, he has gathered
To the Knowledge of the Lord, and Christ their Head.
He rightly did divide the Word of God;
Gave Milk to Babes; but Fools are for the Rod:
He sweetly comforted the Meek:
Ah he was strength unto the Weak;
But terrible he was to the Stout-hearted,
Who verily was smote before they parted.
The Workers of Iniquity by him
Were trampled under foot; the man of sin
Was sorely wounded by his powerful Hand;
The Hypocrites before him could not stand,
But by the Power of God he did them slay:
But now, alas, he is gone, he is gone away.
And we who loved him, though our Loss is great;
Yet being fixed in God, we are complete;
There meet we with his Spirit, who gathered is
Into the Mansion of Eternal Bliss.
Praised be God, and Magnified be He,
Who never waxes old, nor changed can be.

To all Dear Friends OF TRUTH, Who are Sufferers at this day for their
TESTIMONY to the TRUTH, And for the Cause of God (in the Prisons of London,
Hartford, etc.) This is a Salutation of my Love and Life.
MY dearly beloved Friends, who are often brought into my Remembrance, and
presented before me by the Spirit of the Lord; with whom my Life is, and unto
whom the Love of my soul does even flow forth and extend it self; in the Virtue
of that Life which is Infinite and Eternal, and in the Spirit of Supplication
my soul is daily poured forth unto the Lord, before the Throne of his Majesty,
on your behalfs; Beseeching and Desiring, That he will so furnish and arm you
with the whole Armor of his own Righteousness, that you may be entire wanting
nothing; and that you may be enabled to stand, and hold out unto the End in
this day of Battle and Trial; and that, as Valiant Soldiers of the Lamb, you
may endure (all Hardships) as seeing him present in the midst of you, who is
Invisible; in the Faith of the Answer whereof I dearly salute you all.

And dear Friends, in this you may all be enboldned (and in this Consideration
your Heads may be lifted up above all Sufferings, even in the midst of them)
that the Cause in which you are engaged, and for which you suffer, is a
Righteous Cause, of which we have the Witness or Testimony in our own
Consciences; and a more certain Witness cannot be: and this Witness does
testify, That our Cause is the Cause of God; who has called us out of
Darkness into his marvelous Light, and has made choice of us, to bear
Testimony to (and stand Witnesses for) his Name and Truth, in this Day of his
Spiritual Appearance, and Manifestation, or Revelation of the Son of his Love;
whose quickening Spirit we have received, by which we are separated from the
World; and by which we have been (and still are) constrained to bear Testimony
against all Oppression and Cruelty, and against all the Unrighteousness of this
sinful World; for which Cause these Sufferings come upon us, and attend us: But
blessed be the Lord, who has called us with so Honorable a Calling, and
accounted us worthy to suffer for so Honorable a Cause, as, Our Testimony for
his Blessed Name and Truth: the Reward thereof (which is great) will be certain
unto all who are found Faithful unto the End.

Wherefore my dear Friends (toward whom my Bowels of Love even earn, and my
Life and Soul reaches, as you may feel, who are sensible of Life) I say unto
you all, in the Name and Fear of the Lord, Lift up your Heads, over, and above
all Sufferings, both present and to come; I say, in the Faith look over them
all, unto him who is invisible, who will out-last them all; who alone has
Immortallity, and dwells in the Light; whose Presence is certainly with you and
amongst you, and will be so continued as you walk and continue with him in his
Everlasting Covenant of Light, in which he dwells: Wherefore let your Life,
Delight, and Habitation be in him; for, my Friends, you whose Hearts are
upright unto God, know right well, that the Lord has not been at any time
wanting unto you in any Exercise, of what nature or kind soever, in time past;
the consideration of which is a sufficient Encouragement to every one, to cast
their Care upon him, and to resign up themselves unto him, who takes Care for
them. And if the Enemy be permitted so far to prevail, as to execute his
Decrees made against us; yet in this may we be all satisfied, that it shall
certainly work for good unto us in the End, and shall make for the furtherance
of the Glorious Gospel of Peace, and for the Exaltation of the Worthy Name of
the Lord, by which we are called; wherefore in Contentedness with the Will of
the Lord in all states, let every one rest, resigned up unto him, and in the
Gift of his own Spirit wait upon him to receive daily Refreshment from his
Presence, that you may be Watered, Refreshed, and Consolated from day to day;
that so you may grow in his Grace, and be kept fresh and living in his precious
Truth, to shine forth in the beauty thereof. And let it be your great Care
above all things, to keep in the Enjoyment and Feeling of the Peace and Love of
God in your own Hearts, and in that you will have Content in all Conditions;
and live in Love and in Peace one with another, and have perfect Charity
amongst your selves: and whatsoever tends to the contrary, let it be condemned
by the Light in the rise of it. And bear with (and for) one another, and watch
over one another in Love, and therein exhort one another; and build up one
another in the most precious Faith, which gives you Victory over the World, and
over all the Persecuting Powers of Darkness; and be a Strength, and a
Refreshing, and a Comfort one unto another in your Persecuted Suffering State
and Condition.

And God Almighty keep you all, and refresh your hearts daily with his Love,
and renew your strength with the virtue of his Life, that none may be weary,
nor faint in your Minds; but that all may endure with Patience, and Valor, and
Boldness, and Courage, in the Lamb's Spirit unto the End; that in the End you
may be Crowned with the Crown of Immortal Life and Glory, which never fades
away, which is the Daily-Prayer of him who dearly and entirely loves you all,
who are of an Upright Heart; by which Love I was constrained to salute you all
at this time with these few Lines, and so rest in it.

From my outward Being near Bristol, this 20th of the 1st Month, 1665. Your
Dear and truly Loving Friend and Brother, Josiah Coal.

A Salutation of Love From the Spirit of Life, Unto all Friends of TRUTH: Who
are in Exilement, or Sentenced to Exilement, for the Exercise of their Pure
Consciences in the Service and Worship of God.
MY beloved Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, who are exposed to Exilement, from
the Land of your Nativity, for the sake of your Testimony to the blessed Truth
of God; and who have been, and are content to suffer the loss of all that were
dear unto you in this present World, for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
rather then to betray that blessed Testimony, which God had committed unto you
to bear for his Name; and who have sufficiently manifested your fidelity unto
the Lord and his blessed Truth, even in the view of the whole World (as a
Witness against their False, Antichristian, and Idolatrous Worships (which God
by his Power) will certainly throw down, and bring to naught) and who have bore
Testimony in Faithfulness (in and by your Submissiveness to an Exiled Estate)
against that Antichristian spirit of Persecution, which Raigns and Rules in the
Hearts of all the Apostate False Christians, whose Worship stands in
Subjection to the Precepts and Commandments of Men, and in Bowing to Stocks and
Stones, and to the Works of Men's Hands, and in other Outward Performances,
without the Inward Leadings of the Spirit of the Lord; and in this
Antichristian-spirit (by which they have been exercised (in the aforesaid
Idolatrous Abominations) they have been Killing, Destroying, and Devouring one
another about those things which are their own Inventions, set up in their own
Wills, which they would have all to conform to: and have long imposed it one
upon another by Penal Laws, and thereby have enforced many (who feared Man more
then God) to conform, contrary to what they were persuaded in their own
Consciences) to worship the Image set up by them; yet a Remnant there was
always, whom God preserved, and raised up by his Power, to stand faithful
Witnesses against their Idolatrous Worships and Traditions, whose Blood this
Antichristian-spirit in the Beast and false Prophet, that carries the Whore,
has always drunk; and many Faithful Martyrs of Jesus, in times past, have
sealed their Testimony against this false Church of Apostate Christians (in
which this Antichristian spirit rules) even with their very Lives, though they
did not see nor understand the things that are now seen and understood by many;
yet (blessed be the Lord) they were by his Power and Spirit so furnished, and
sustained, and so filled with Love to God and his Cause, and with Zeal against
the false Church, and her Antichristian Impositions and Idolatries; that they
loved not their Lives unto death, but laid down their Lives with Cheerfulness,
as a Testimony against them; and so, through Faith have obtained a Good Report
amongst us, who are now following the Lamb in the same Footsteps of the Flock.

And so, my Beloved Friends, Seeing that now, in fullness of time, God has
raised us up by his Power, according to his Purpose, and Determination, and
Foreknowledge, to be faithful Witnesses for his Name and Truth, and to the
Power of his Appearance in our Hearts, and to bear Testimony against the
aforesaid Superstitions, and and Idolatrous Impositions, which are practiced at
this day amongst them that know not the only true and living God, nor Jesus
Christ, whom he has sent a Light into the World: I say, my Friends, These
things are sufficient to engage our Hearts unto the Lord, follow him unto the
end, through all Trials and Exercises, of what nature or kind soever, that for
the future may come upon us, for our Testimonies sake: For, my Friends, We know
right well, that God has not been wanting unto us in any Trial or State
whatsoever (if we have not been wanting in or Obedience unto him) but has been
always present with us, and has often caused his Love to abound unto us, and in
us, being shed abroad in our hearts by his good Spirit; so that for joy of
Heart we could even sing Praises to the Name of the Lord in the midst of our
Sufferings and Afflictions; so that we have no Cause to be discouraged at the
Sufferings which attend us, nor at the Threats and Frowns of Wicked Men, who
hate and persecute us without a just Cause; but we have rather great Cause of
encouragement to persevere and go on, bearing forth our Testimony for the Lord
through all Sufferings, if it be Death it self, knowing the Reward thereof to
be so exceeding great; and having this Confidence in our selves, That none of
these things shall be able to move us, nor to separate us from the Love of God
which we have in Christ Jesus: Nay, but rather shall confirm us; for as the
Apostle said, It is an evident Token to us of Salvation, but to our Adversaries
of Perdition, and that of God.

And so, my Beloved Friends, You who are already Exiled, and sent into foreign
Parts of the World, for your Testimony's sake; I doubt not but you
experimentally know, in an especial manner, the Largeness of the Extent of
God's Love unto his People in a Suffering Condition, you having been in measure
exercised therein, beyond many others; though I doubt not (but have the
Testimony of God's Holy Spirit) that many are as freely given up in the same
Faith, for the same Testimony, to partake with you outwardly of the same
Sufferings, as they do inwardly sympathize with you therein, if the Lord see it
meet for the Honor of his Name, so to suffer them to be exercised; Yet
nevertheless, All who have been, and are faithful to God in their Places, have,
and do enjoy so much of the Peace and Presence of God, as is fully satisfactory
unto them; so that in the Unity of the Spirit of Life, which from God we have
received, and by which we are separated from the World, and its Ways and Works
of Darkness, and by which we are raised up to be faithful and true Witnesses
for God, and against the Traditions of men, by which they have made void God's
Commandments; I say, in this Spirit we do sympathize and partake with you, both
in Suffering and in Rejoicing, and have a real Sense upon our hearts and
spirits of your Estate; and we are not unmindful of you, but do heartily pray,
That Grace, Health, Mercy, and Peace, together with all Spiritual Blessings in
Christ our Lord, may be continually multiplied and increased amongst you, that
the Aboundings thereof you may know unto your great Consolation; that so, being
thereby watered and refreshed, you may grow in the Grace of God, and in the
Knowledge of our Lord Jesus, and may feel his Life to increase in you, and so
to strengthen you, that you thereby may be able to teach others also, and to
instruct them in the Way of Life and Salvation, that so your Sufferings and
Exilement may make for the Furtherance of the Gospel of God, and for the
spreading of his Blessed Glorious Truth through the Nations, and for the
gathering into it them who are yet afar off from God, and Strangers unto him;
that so the Witness of God in all Consciences being answered by you, both in
Life, Conversation, and Doctrine you may be a good savor unto God, both in
them that believe, and also in them that perish, that the Justification of Life
in the Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ you may all feel and witness, and that
will be your alone Satisfaction in all Conditions, and therein my Love does
dearly salute you all.

And in this, my Dear Friends, pray one for another, and walk together in Love,
and be of one Mind and Practice in all things that appertain to the Worship of
God, and to your Testimony for Him, and against the World, and its Ways and
Worships; and live in Peace one with another; and build up one another in your
most precious Faith; and watch over one another in the Spirit of Love and
Meekness; and let there be no Straightness nor Strangeness one toward another;
but be Open-hearted and Tender one to another: And if any thing appear amongst
any of you, which tends to the Hurt of any Particular, or to the Truth in
general, in the Spirit of Meekness let it be spoken to them, and in the same
Spirit let it be received; and that will keep down all that may arise to make
any Dissension, to cause any straitness or strangeness amongst you, and so you
will be kept in the unity of the Truth, which will be a good savor amongst all
people; and in that the Lord will take Delight to dwell amongst you, and to do
you good; and in that God Almighty be with you, and bless you, and water you
with the Dew of Heaven, and cause the Showers of his Love to descend upon you,
that you may be refreshed and kept alive in the Truth, therein to live
according to God in the Spirit, and not according to men in the Flesh, but in
that by which you are judged according to men, and by which you are crucified
unto the World; and therein your Joy, Peace, and Comfott will be Everlasting.

And so dear Friends, Let nothing enter that would deprive you of your Peace
and Comfort, lest you lose the Reward of your Sufferings; but keep in
Lowliness, and Watchfulness, and in true Humility of mind and spirit; for
therein is Safety: And its the Humble that God teaches and supporteth: And
without his assisting Spirit of Grace we can do nothing that will add to our
Comfort or Consolation; and therefore, whatever our state be, we have daily
need of an Assistance from him, and of the renewing of our strength by him, by
whom alone we are able to do all things, and in him nothing is too hard for us;
for its through him (that we are more then Conquerors, and by Faith in him) we
stand, and that gives Victory over the World: And in that, my Dear Friends, all
live and walk, and thereby you will have free access to God, and will meet with
us at the Throne of Grace, and Ocean of Life; and there the Minister of the
Sanctuary is seen always near at hand, administering unto every one according
to their necessity, who will give Ability and Strength sufficient to endure all
things, and to answer his Requirings in all things; and will also keep down
(and under) all which would arise to exalt the mind above measure in the time
of enjoyment of the Reward that is received through Sufferings; and hereby you
will be preserved out of all the Snares of the Enemy: And in this my Love is
dear to you all, and to the whole Flock of God in all Parts of the World; and
to this Spirit of Grace I do commit you all, and resign you up to be governed
and protected thereby; for, by it I was at this time moved to write these Lines
to you, in which I doubt not but it will be received, by all whose hearts are
sincere toward God: And in that God Almighty be with your spirits, Amen.

London, this 28th of the 11th Month, 1665. I am your Dearly Loving Brother,
in the Patient Long-Suffering Spirit of the Lamb. Josiah Coal.
Let this be read amongst Friends who are Ezil'd, or sentenced for Exilement,
when they are met together in the Fear of the Lord.



An Epistle to FRIENDS In Holland.
MY Dearly Beloved Friends, I ofttimes remember you, and make mention of you in
my Prayers to the Lord, since I outwardly saw your Faces, and my Love in the
Lord is unfeigned to you, in which I have, for your Good traveled amongst you,
and in which at this time I dearly salute you, as those whom God Almighty has
reached unto and visited, that you might have Acquaintance with him, and that
you might be made Partakers of his Endless Love in his Son Christ Jesus, and
therewith might love one another, as he has loved you, who has forgiven you
your Trespasses, that you might take Example thereby to Forgive one another;
that so you may have the Mind of his Spirit of Love, and be like him in this
present evil World, and that you might bear his Image amongst the Children of
Men, and stand as Witnesses for him, and appear on his behalf in that Life,
through which you will answer the Witness of God in the Hearts of all People;
that so you bring Honor, and Glory, and Praise to the Name of the Lord, who
has visited you; To whom all Glory belongs forever, Amen.

My Beloved Friends, Prize the Mercies of the Lord, with which he has visited
you; and walk worthy of his Love, which has been additionally manifested
through the many tender Visitations which he has sent unto you by his
Servants, whom he has moved from time to time to come amongst you with the
Message of Life, as Dispencers of his Word of Reconciliation, for your
Consolation and Comfort: And every one in your own particulars, feel the
Measure of the Meek Spirit of the Lamb, that your minds may be daily exercised
thereby, in the Cross to all that is contrary to the Nature thereof, that so
your Hearts and Souls may be seasoned therewith, and the contrary kept down and
bowed under it: And as all are exercised with this Spirit of the Lamb, you will
more and more grow into its nature, through the refreshing Virtue which therein
and thereby you will daily receive; and this is alone that which presents all a
Good Savor unto God; and in this (you know) we have labored among'st you; and
therein you will feel my Love and Life, which is in that which is not of this
World; and therein the Fellowship of the Children of Light stands, which is a
Mystery to the World; and in that, Love, Unity, Peace, Meekness and Gentleness
will increase amongst you, which are excellent Virtues, and amiable to behold;
and that which is Passionate, or Hasty and Unsavory shall not have a place
amongst you; but you will all be Examples of good one unto another: And also,
Your Life, and Holy Chaste Conversation will preach unto the World, by which
they that are without shall be convinced, and made to confess, That God is in
you; and in this you will be a Good Savor unto God; and he will take Delight
to manifest his Presence and Blessings amongst you, and to multiply his Mercies
unto you; and will water you daily with the Dew of Heaven, through which you
will be kept in the Freshness of the Life of the Blessed Unchangeable Truth;
for the Lord waits to be Gracious unto all them that wait upon him for the
Teachings of his Spirit of Grace, and are taught thereby; and such he enricheth
with the Riches of his Grace, through which they live unto him; and in that all
are a strength one unto another, and a Refreshment and Comfort to each other:
And so, my dear Friends, In that God Almighty keep you, and be with you, and
water you daily with the Dew of Heaven, that you may grow thereby; and dwell
all in Watchfulness, in the Light, and keep in the weighty Truth, the true
Foundation, that the Understandings of all may be kept clear and open, that
none may be beguiled of their Peace nor Crown of Life: And all watch over one
another in Love; and bear ye one another Burdens, and so fulfill the Law of
God, and in that you are a strength one to another; and so in this feel the
Salutation of my Love, which is to you beyond declaring. And to the Keeping and
Protection of the Arm of the Lord I do commit you, Amen.

So, in the Peace and Life which has no end, I remain,

London the 2d Day of the 7th Month, 1667. Your Faithful and True Brother,
Josiah Coal.
Let this be sent amongst the Friends in Holland.



To all People in JAMAICA Unto whom the MESSAGE OF Eternal Life is sent; and
amongst whom the Gospel is now preached.
FRIENDS, Now the Everlasting Gospel of Peace and Glad-tidings is preached
amongst you, and the Word of Reconciliation reaches forth toward you, every
one with Meekness receive it; for it is able to save your Souls, and to build
you up, and give you an Inheritance amongst the sanctified Ones: For now is the
Message of the Lord to be declared unto you, and amongst you, by True and
Faithful Messengers, whom he has sent forth in his Name, and endew'd with
Power for that Service; and has made them willing, for your sakes, to give up
their Lives, that the Way of Life might be made known unto you, and you might
come to walk therein: And their Message you are all to receive, as you prize
the Salvation of your Souls; for they are Messengers of the New Covenant, into
which the Lord (in this Day of his Glorious Appearance) is gathering his
People, that they might be all taught of him, and come to the Knowledge of him,
from the Least to the Greatest.

And Friends, This Covenant, of which I speak, which they are Messengers of, is
Light; and this Light lights every man that comes into the World, which, if
you give heed unto, in your own Consciences, you will find it reproving for the
Deeds of Darkness, and condemning sin in the Flesh; and will lead all, who are
guided by it, out of sin; and will lead in the Way of Righteousness, and in the
Path of Peace, and Way of True Holiness, which is a Way that the World knows
not, who live in Iniquity. Wherefore now all People, The Day of your Visitation
being upon you, and the Lord striving with you by his Good Spirit in your
Hearts, and being also calling unto you by the Mouths of his Messengers, to
Returns; Now every one incline your Ears, and hear what the Spirit says in
your inward Parts; and prize the Day of the Visitation of the Lord's Love, who,
after the long time that you have passed away in Rebellion and Disobedience
against his Good Spirit, should now be pleased to accept of you, and to pass by
your Transgressions past, and the Sins of your Youth; therefore I say, Let the
Rich Love of the Lord, which is now manifested, constrain you to Fear before
him, and to learn Obedience unto his Faithful Witness, which he has placed in
your Hearts: For Friends, it concerns your Eternal Peace; and now is the Day
wherein you may come to the knowledge thereof, before they be hid from your
Eyes: For, truly Friends, If you be not attentive unto that which will give
unto you the knowledge of those things, the time will come, that they will be
hid from your Eyes; and then shall you cry out, saying, How have we hated
Instruction, and despised the Day of Healing.

And so, Now the Day is, wherein you may come to know and witness your
Reconciliation made with the Lord by his Word of Power, which is nigh you, even
in your Hearts and in your Mouths; which Word reconciles to God all who hear
and obey it; and it will also purge you from all Iniquity, if you submit to the
Working and Operation of it.

And this I testify, That no other Way can you come to know a being sanctified
and reconciled to the Lord, but by the Word of his Power, and through your
Obedience thereunto: And this Testimony I send amongst you, to the end that you
might believe in the Light of the Son of God, wherewith you are enlighttened:
And this Testimony will be further confirmed unto you by the Mouths of these
whom the Lord has now sent amongst you; and their Testimony is true, of which
I am a Witness; for we have been all Baptized by one Spirit into one Body, even
the Glorious Body of him who is the Head: And so we are all Eyewitnesses of
his Majesty, and of his Glory; and can give in our Testimony together, That by
the Mouths of several Witnesses (even so many as the Lord shall call) the
TRUTH may be confirmed to you; that so you may no longer follow them who cry,
Lo here, or Lo there; For, behold the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, and
comes not with Observations; and all that enter into it must become as little
Children; for of such is the Kingdom of God, which is now come with Power, and
is nigh unto you: And Blessed and Happy are all they that come to know an
Entrance administered into it; for they are Heirs of that Inheritance which
shall never fade away.

Labourer in the Lords' Vineyard, called, Josiah Coal.

An Epistle to FRIENDS IN New England.
The First Epistle.
DEAR FRIENDS, My Love, which is sincere and fervent in the Lord's Truth (which
is as precious as ever in this Day of Trial) is freely and fervently extended
to you: For, often are you in my Remembrance, in much tenderness; and truly do I
Respect you as such whom the Lord has accounted worthy to bear his Name, and
which he has made choice of to be a Peculiar People to himself, and to be
Witnesses for him in the midst of a Crooked and Perverse Generation.

And let your Holy Life and Chaste Conversation be such, as may preach
Righteousness unto all; that if they speak Evil of you, as of Evildoers, you
may have cause to Rejoice, having the Peace of God in your Hearts.

And Friends, I am not unmindful of you, neither are you forgotten by me: For,
often I am even amongst you in the Spirit of Love and Life, in which my Desires
and Prayers to God are, and often have been for you, that you may grow, and
increase, and prosper, and flourish in the precious living glorious Truth of
God, of which you are made Partakers, and into which you are gathered, through
the working of his Divine Power, that so the Heavenly Image may be borne by you
all; that by your Good Example in Holiness and Righteousness many may be made
to confess unto the Truth, and be convinced of it; and that to the Brightness
of your rising in it, many may be gathered; that so the Borders of the
Sanctuary of the Most High may be enlarged unto the ends of the Earth.

For Friends, You know full well, that in the Power of God, yea, the Power of
an Endless Life, We, (whom the Lord sent unto you) labored amongst you for the
Exaltation of his Kingdom, and for the publishing and spreading of his
Everlasting Truth; and for the sake of this, our Lives nor Liberties were not
dear unto us; wherefore be ye every one like-minded with us in the same thing:
And in your places where the Lord has set you, therein adorn the Truth, so
will you be a good savor unto God, and he will take Pleasure and Delight in
you, and will do you good by multiplying his Mercies and Blessings in your
Hearts; and so you will witness a growth and increase in the Increases of God.

And so all Friends, Wait upon the Lord in the Gift of his Spirit, that you may
feel him to administer unto you of his Heavenly Riches and Consolation, that no
one may have cause to complain of Poverty or Weariness; but every one know him
in you, in whom the Fullness dwells, that you may by him be upheld in all times
of Trial, and be administered unto in all times of want, that so you may be
carried on with Cheerfulness to run the Way of his Commandments. And God
Almighty keep you by his own Power, that therein you may be firmly joined and
united together, a Family of Love, and a strong Body, and a spiritual House
fitly framed and compacted, that there may be no Rent nor Division; but that
you may be one in him, who is the Head: and in this I can promise you the
Blessings of God, and that by his Spirit. And so, bear one with another in
Love; and let the Strong help the Weak, and by so doing you will preserve
Peace. And the Blessing of the Lord be with you, and rest upon you forever,
Amen.

London the 1st Month of the Year, 1667. This is a Salutation of Pure,
Perfect, and Never-dying Love, from your Dear and Truly Loving Brother, Josiah
Coal.

An EPISTLE to FRIENDS IN New England.
The Second Epistle.
DEAR and Everlastingly Beloved Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, whom my
Heavenly Father has visited with the Dayspring from on High, which he has
caused to dawn unto you; and by his Outstretched Arm of Power, has gathered
you out of the Egyptian Darkness into the mavelous Light of the Son of his
Love, that therein you may come to have an Inheritance amongst them that are
sanctified, and become Heirs of Eternal and Everlasting Salvation in and
through Christ Jesus, the Firstborn from the Dead, who is now brought forth
into the World, and revealed in us, whom all the Angels must worship.

I say, my dear Friends, Seeing the Lord has thus visited you with his Love,
and thus reached unto you, see that you walk worthy of his Love: And every one
in your holy Callings, wherewith you are called of God, therein abide with him;
and feel the Gift of his good Spirit of Grace, which from him you have
received, at all times to exercise your minds; that so, out of all the Snares
and Temptations of the Wicked One you may thereby be led, kept, and preserved,
that the Enemy may not prevail to hurt you, or to deprive you of your precious
Treasure, or to make a Spoil of you, or in the least to diminish that Precious
Life which God has raised and manifested in you, and given you a feeling of:
But all, and every one, wait that you may grow therein, and become daily more
and more a good savor unto God, that you may know him to take delight in you,
and to dwell amongst you, and in the midst of you, and to administer unto you
according to your Necessities, that there may be no want unto you in the Day of
Trial; but that you may be thoroughly furnished unto every good Word and Work;
that in all Trials and Temptations whatsoever, that may come upon you, you may
feel your Strength, Hope and Confidence to remain, that so you may be supported
and carried through with Cheerfulness unto the End; for its such only that
shall be saved.

And above all things, my Friends and Brethren, have perfect Charity amongst
your selves; and let the Love of God dwell in your Hearts, and rule there, and
in that watch over one another; and in the Spirit of Love and Meekness exhort
and beseech one another, as the Lord moves; and let no one go beyond the Word
of the Lord, nor yet without it; for that will burden the Seed in others; but
watch in the Light for the Movings of the Life it self; and as that is felt to
stir or move in you, or any of you, wait to know the Mind and Intent of the
Spirit's Motion, whether it be for your selves to treasure up, or whether it be
to give forth unto others; and this Discerning and Understanding you will all
come to know and receive as you wait in Stilness, out of the Reasoning Part;
for, if the Reasoning Part enter, that will darken the Understanding, and then
you will not know what to chose, and what to refuse, nor what to do, or what to
leave undone: Therefore dwell in the Simplicity, and single Subjection unto
God's Holy Spirit of Life, the Meek Lamb's Spirit; and there is the Gate of
true Wisdom, and the Door of Understanding; and in that you will edify one
another in Love, and the Bond of Peace will be known amongst you: And for this
End have we traveled and labored amongst you, whom the Lord sent forth in his
own Name and Power, for the turning of you from the darkness of Ignorance unto
the Light and Knowledge of God's Everlasting Power, and for the building of you
up in your most precious holy Faith, that therein, and thereby you might come
to have victory over all that is contrary. And to this day I am often traveling
in Spirit amongst you; and in my Prayers to God, I daily make mention of you;
and my spirit breathes unto God, and is poured forth unto him for your
preservation, growth, and prosperity in the precious living Truth, and that you
may be crowned with Victory, Life, and Dominion over all which would hinder you
from running this good Race, that is set before you; that so none amongst you,
who have tasted of the Love of God, and have known the Way of Life, may fall
short of the Mark, or of the Inheritance incorruptible, which fades not away.
So the Lord God Almighty be with you, and keep you, and place his Fear in your
Hearts yet more and more, that you may no more depart from him, or from the
feeling of his Life and Presence; but that you may always live in him, who is
God blessed forever; and may be found of him in everlasting Peace, Amen.

London, 21 1st Month, 1665. This from your dear Brother, who truly loves you,
and the whole Flock of God in all Places, JOSIAH COAL.

To the Flock of God, Gathered out of the World in the Province of MARYLAND.
The First EPISTLE.
MY Dearly Beloved Friends, with whom, and amongst whom I have traveled in
times past, for the Redemption of the Suffering Seed, which lay groaning in
Bondage, and was held in Captivity under the Chains of Death and Darkness in
you; and for the bringing forth of that Birth which is Heir of all things, and
must Rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron, and unto whom we (who have been
Laborers amongst you) have reached with the Word of Immortal Life, and with
the Power of the Almighty, to the raising of Life, and bringing Immortality to
Light in you, by which you were then quickened unto Life, who were sometimes
dead in Sin and Trespasses: And you know right well, that by this Word of God,
and Power of an Endless Life you were more and more enlightened, as you came
into Obedience thereunto; and your Understandings were opened, by which you
came to see how you had been in times past captivated with Sin and Iniquity,
and had been led away with the Error of the Wicked, into Envy, Strife, and
Maliciousness; and indeed, into every Evil Work; and then true Judgment and
Condemnation took hold on that part in you, by which you had been led into
those things; and the Way of Truth, Peace, Love, Sanctification, and Salvation,
opened unto you, by the Light and Spirit of the Lord, by which your
Understandings were quickened: And the Invisible Eye was opened in you, by which
you came to see your Teacher; and as you inclined your Ear unto this Teacher,
and walked in this Light of God's Salvation; O then, how was the Appearance of
Evil eschewed by you? And how contrary to your Desires it was to see or hear of
Strife, and Debate, and Contention amongst Brethren? And how Love, Peace, and
Good Will did then abound one toward another, and toward all men, desiring
that all might come to know and be made Partakers with you of the same
plentious Redemption? And how gloriously and plentifully the Lord did then
appear amongst you? And how freely he did then shed abroad his Love in your
Hearts, and issue forth of the Virtue of his Life unto you, by which your
Hearts were enlarged, and your souls refreshed and comforted; so that you did
run well (without Weariness or Fainting) Who has hindered you, or any of you,
that you should not continue in this Race, in which Peace, Love, and Good Will
did abound one unto another? And what is the cause of the Strife, and
Divisions, and Contentions, that of late has been amongst you? Has not the
Evil One stepped in, and drawn you into Reasonings and Consultations about
Differences which has been occasioned by Dissenting-spirits, and thereby
veiled the Understandings of some of you, and so brought Night upon them; and
in the Night season sown the seed of Sedition amongst them.

Well, My Heart is grieved within me for your sakes; and I am oft-times
afflicted in spirit because of these things which have happened amongst you:
for indeed, some there be, that have made the Hearts of others sad, whom God
never made sad, because of their unsoundness, and unstedfastness in the Truth,
which in much simplicity, fear, and reverence was made known unto you by us,
who labored amongst you in the Word and Doctrine.

And truly Friends, I cannot but Lament the lost estate of some amongst you,
which I am fully sensible is great and sad: Oh that ever it should be said of
such a People (for whom the Lord had done such great things, and unto whom he
had so plentifully manifested himself and appeared) that they should not retain
their first Love, and Integrity, and Fervency, and Zeal to the Lord, and one
toward another! Its indeed sad to consider: For have not I seen the Lilly
blossom amongst you, and the Vine flourish, and the tender Grapes appear? yes
verily. And this I further testify, That while you kept your first Simplicity,
and your first Faith and Love, you were Beautiful, and Comely, and Lovely in
the Eyes of the Lord; and he took great Delight in you; and exercised Judgment,
Mercy, and Loving Kindness amongst you; in which many did greatly Rejoice; and
your Faith was every where spoken of amongst the Churches of Christ; and many
did greatly Rejoice because of you; for you were Honorable and lovely in the
Hearts of the People of God every where; and you were even a Crown of Rejoicing
unto us, who had labored amongst you, and traveled for your sakes. But alas!
A contrary spirit has since entered amongst some of you, with which we have not
Unity nor Fellowship; the Report of which has brought Sadness upon the Hearts
of many: But those who have given place to the Envious-One, must bear their own
Burden; for their Judgment and Condemnation slumbreth not, but will swiftly
come upon them.

Wherefore my dear Ftiends all, Be you retired in your minds unto the Light, by
which you were first convinced of the Truth, and which gave you then to see the
Error of your Ways, and which led you into Love, Peace, and Good Will one
toward another, and toward all men; and to eschew the appearance of Evil: And
as you all (in this Light) come singly to wait upon the Lord in your first
Love, Simplicity, and Integrity, you will plainly and clearly see what it is
that has entered (and how it entered) that has been the cause of all those
Tumults, and Contentions, and Divisions, which of late has (happened and) been
amongst you; and as its seen with the Light, and discovered thereby unto you,
or any of you, let it by the Life be judged from amongst you; and therein wait
that you may be purged from all Filthiness, both of Flesh and Spirit: And be
tenderly affectionated one toward another in the Truth; not with a feigned
Love, or a feigned Affection; for that God hates: But let Love be without
Dissimulation, abhorring that which is Evil in all, and cleaving to that which
is Good: And be Open-Hearted one toward another (not Strange and Staightned)
and Simply and Honestly confess your Faults to each other, and pray for one
another, and the Lord will have Mercy upon the Transgressors, and will heal
their Backslidings and blot out their Iniquities, and will again love them
freely; and so you will re-gain the Favor, Love, and Good Will of God unto
you; and we shall again be comforted in you, after these our Sorrows and Grief
of Heart, because of the Divisions and Spoilings that have been amongst you;
for, our Joy is in your Prosperity and Well-being; and our Rejoying is in your
Comfort, and Refreshment, and Preservation, and Safety.

Wherefore, my Friends, Keep your Eye always upon that Mark which first you
pressed after, when you received the Truth, and obeyed the Gospel; and in that
straight and narrow Way of Holiness, which was then made known unto you, every
one still press toward this Mark; and have perfect Charity amongst your
selves, as in the time of your first Simplicity: And then you will feel the
Lords wonted Goodness and Loving Kindness shed abroad in your Hearts; and he
will water you with the Dew of Heaven, and will bless you with all Spiritual
Blessings from above; and he will then own you for his own, and will dwell in
the midst of you, and amongst you; for which the earnest Desire of my Soul is
unto the Lord; and in my Prayers I do often make mention of you unto my God and
your God, that his Arm of Power and Salvation may always be with you; and that
you may be thereby kept Pure, and Unrebukeable, and Spotless unto Himself in
his sight, from this time forth and forever, Amen.

And Friends, It was the fervent and sincere Desire of my Heart to have seen
you this Year; having a confident Persuasion and Assurance in me, That (if the
Lord had so ordered it) it would have been for your Good and Benefit; and that
I should have been Refreshed with you and amongst you, as in times past.

And in order to it I wholly fixed and applied my Heart to the Lord (for some
certain days) to search his Counsel in the thing, until he fully and clearly
satisfied me, that it must not then be; in whose blessed Will I rest, and am
content: yet am not wholly without hopes, but that in Due Season it may yet be.
And in the mean time I leave you, and commend you to God, who is able to keep
you, and do more abundantly for you then you can ask or think; to whom be
Glory forever, Amen.

Written in Essex this 5th of the 7th Mon. 1664. I am your Dear Brother, in the
Tribulation, Kingdom, and Patience of Jesus, Josiah Coal.
Let Copies of this be sent amongst Friends every where in the Province of
Maryland, and be read amongst them in their Assemblies in the Fear of the Lord.



To the Flock of God IN MARYLAND GREETING.
The second EPISTLE.
MY Dear Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, who are called and sanctified in
Christ Jesus; and with whom, and amongst whom I have traveled both in Body and
Spirit, for the Resurrection of that Birth which is Immortal; through which you
might become Heirs of Eternal Salvation, and of the Kingdom Everlasting, which
is not of this World.

My soul and bowels even daily earn toward you; and you are even daily
presented before me, and brought into my View and Remembrance by the Spirit of
the Lord; by which I am often constrained to present my Supplications and Prayers
to the God of my Life for you, and on your behalfs; beseeching and desiring
him, that he will keep and preserve you in the Unspotted Life of the Lamb; and
that Grace, Mercy, and Peace, together with Spiritual Blessings in Christ Jesus
our Lord, may be multipy'd and increased amongst you.

My beloved Friends, Keep your station in the Holy Place, every one who know
it; and in your Holy Calling, wherewith you are called of God, therein abide
and walk with him; that therein you may all adorn the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ.

And Friends, You certainly know, That the Living, Blessed, and Everlasting
Truth it self (which sanctifies thoroughly, both in Soul, Body, and Spirit; and
which sets free from the Bondage of Corruption all who continue in it) has
been freely made manifest amongst you: Therefore I charge you all, as you will
answer the Lord, Every one see that you live and walk in the Purity thereof.

And you likewise know the Way of Life, and Salvation, and of Holiness (in
which no unclean thing can pass) see therefore that you continue therein; that
so, whenever your Lord comes, you may be found of him in Peace, and covered
with his Righteousness.

For you have all need of Circumspection, and Watchfulness, and Diligence;
because the Adversary of your Soul's Peace is very subtle, and lodges very
near to every one; and waits to devour, and lurkes to destroy; and will lose no
Opportunity, if possible he may beguile any of you, as he did Eve in the
beginning. -- But as you all watch in the Light of God's Salvation, which he
has caused to shine unto you, the Adversary will thereby be discovered unto
you in all his Twindings and Appearances.

And my Friends, This Light, in which you have believed, is the true
Touchstone, by which all spirits may be tried, and all Motions (in whom soever
they arise) may hereby be known, whether they be of God, and tend to that which
is consistant with the Honor of Truth, and your own Peace; or whether they
savor of the Flesh, and tend to the satisfying of the Lusts thereof.

For, the Lusts of the Flesh, and of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, are not
of the Father, but of the World, which passes away: And where (or in
whomsoever) these, or either of these are found, and discovered by the Light,
which makes all things manifest; they are therewith to be condemned, and by you
to be denied; that so you may be every one kept out of the Snare of the
Devourer, and out of the Net of the mighty Hunter.

For, If you live after the Flesh, you shall dye; for the Lusts thereof, when
they are conceived, bring forth sin; and the Wages of sin is death: But every
one, who through the spirit mortifies the Deeds of the flesh, such shall live
to God in the Newness of Life; and such will adorn the Gospel of God.

And so, my dear Friends, You are called to Liberty, but not to serve your
selves; therefore use not your Liberty as an Occasion to the Flesh, lest
thereby you be ensnared; neither use it as an Occasion of stumbling unto
others: but every one, in the Fear of the Lord, stand fast in that glorious
Liberty, wherewith Christ has made you free. And beware of being again
entangled with the heavy Yoke of Bondage, and of being brought into Captivity
with that which in measure you had Victory over -- For, you (that have passed
from Death to Life) know right well (and I need not tell you) through what
Difficulties, Hardships, and Exercises you obtained that precious Liberty in
the Truth, which you are brought unto: And you also know what it cost you to
purchase the Possession of that measure of Life and Truth, which is manifested
amongst you; therefore let none sell his Birthright for a Mess of Pottage;
neither let any perishing Object become a snare, or divert you from your
Simplicity and Sincerity in the Truth.

But every one walk worthy of the matchless Love of God, which has extended
its self unto you, that so the daily Multiplyings and Abounding thereof you may
know and witness in your hearts; that through it you may Grow, and Increase,
and be Enriched; and that God Almighty may take delight to dwell amongst you.

And my Friends, The savoury holy Order that the Truth led into in the
beginning, and in which the primative Christians were exercised, you are not
ignorant of; and I hope not unmindful of it neither: And you likewise know what
Fervency, and Fear, and Zeal toward God the Truth wrought in your Hearts, when
you first received the Testimony thereof; And what a Godly Resolution was put
on by many? and there was not another thing accounted of by many of you, in
comparison of his Blessed Truth.

And whatsoever things were honest and of Good Report, and by which the Truth
might have been adorned; how readily would you have been made conformable
thereunto, though you had denied your selves therein? And then how did the
Blessings of God, with Peace and Unity one with another, abound amongst you?

Well, I hope (and doubt not but that) you are still like-minded in the same
thing many of you; and that you have the same Consolation abounding amongst
you: But if any be otherwise-minded, I would have such know, that the Truth is
of the same worth, as ever it was; and of as great price, with all who really
walk therein, as ever it was esteemed by such; and this God shall reveal unto
them in his Day.

And if any retain not their first Love, Zeal, and Fervency; but walk
disorderly, and not according to the Truth of the Gospel, which was preached
unto you by us in the beginning; I say, if we, or any other shall walk amongst
you not according to that Holy Order of the Gospel, by which it may be adorned,
and shall refuse (the Admonition of the Spirit of Meekness) to be humbled for
his disorderly walking; have no Fellowship with such a one; but let him be
accounted as a Heathen and a Publican unto you, that God may deal with him for
his Iniquity according to his Deserts: Yet nevertheless, against an Elder
receive not an Accusation, except it be by the Mouths of two or three
Witnesses; that nothing be done, but that which may tend to the Edification of
all, and not to the Destruction of any.

And farther, my Friends, If any amongst you shall walk, not as becomes the
Gospel of Christ, nor according to that savoury holy Order, that the Truth has
led, and does lead into; but by any unsavory Actions or Motions whatsoever,
shall vary from the Simplicity and Purity of the Truth, yet let not that become
a Stumbling Block unto any, nor cause any to fall from the Faith which you have
received, and through which you have obtained Remission of Sins, and Immortal
Life: For the Unfaithfulness or disorderly walking of some will not be a
sufficient Excuse for others in the Day of the Lord, when they are called to an
account; but every one, who have tasted of the Power and Love of God, and have
received the Gift of his Spirit, be faithful thereunto, that you may improve
your Tallent, which is committed to you: For every one must give an account for
himself unto God; and none can excuse you before him: therefore I say, Look not
at the Haltings of others (though it should be such, who have seemed to be as
Pillars) nor think to make that a Plea, or an Excuse to decline from the Purity
of the Holy Way of the Lord; for, although that may serve for an Argument
amongst men; yet that will not serve when God shall come to plead with such,
before whom all Hearts are open, and all things naked and bare; and he will
give to every one a just Reward, according to their Deeds.

Wherefore, I say, Let every one have an Eye unto the Lord in all things, and
mind their own state, and how it stands betwixt them and the Lord; and that
will keep them from looking-out, and consulting about the state of others, who
may vary from the Purity of the Truth; for hereby the occasion of stumbling
comes unto many -- But rather let the halting of such be as Dreadful Examples
unto you, to take Warning by; that so you may be kept in Fear and Faithfulness,
in Watchfulness and Diligence, lest you fall into the same Temptation and Snare
of the Devil.

For, my Friends, Whither can any go to find Life, Immortal Consolation, and
Satisfaction to their Souls, if they should forsake the precious Truth, of
which we have born testimony (in the Life and Demonstration of God's Spirit)
amongst you, and through which many of you have found Rest to your Souls, after
many long and sore Travels? Truly there is not another thing that can add unto
your everlasting Consolation, if once any of you should vary, or slip aside
from that: And this I hope (and doubt not but) that many, or most of you are
persuaded, and satisfied in -- Therefore continue therein, and therein be
unanimous in your Service and Obedience unto the Lord; that by him, his Good
Spirit, and Word of Grace, you may be established forever.

And as concerning the state of Marriages, You know the comely Order of the
Church in the primitive Times, before the Apostasy began; and how the Apostle
said, If any be called, being Married, let him nor seek to be loosed (nay,
though he or she had an Unbelieving Wife or Husband) but let the Husband render
due Benevolence to the Wife, and likewise, the Wife to the Husband. And
further, By Commission from God he said, Let not the Wife depart from her
Husband. -- And so say I unto you, in the Name and Fear of the Lord, Let none
give place in the least to that spirit that would beget Inclinations in the
Wife or Husband to depart one from another; but let every man have his own
Wife, and every woman her own Husband: For, whatsoever Pretense or Covering
that spirit (that would separate them) may come under, yet it is a spirit of
Fornication; and it will lead out of the comely Order, into the Disorder, and
into the Defilements and Pollutions of the World, and into a Pit and a Snare:
And for such things sake the Wrath of God will be revealed; and he will make
such Examples of his Vengeance: For, as the Apostle said, The Wife is bound by
the Law so long as her Husband lives; and if she depart from him, and Marry
another Man, she is an Adulteress, and a Transgressor of the Law. -- And
therefore, my dear Friends (as I said before) In that comely Order, in which
you may adorn the Gospel (and be kept in Favor with the Lord, and in Unity and
Fellowship one with another, in his Spirit of Life) let all walk together; and
in your places and stations, where the Lord has set you and ordered you,
therein abide with him, having the Loins of your Minds girt about with the
Truth it self, and be zealous for the Honor thereof; and keep steadfast therein
with the Lord, in Fear and Faithfulness, in Fervency and Simplicity, all being
Examples one to another of Chastity, and Holiness, and Godliness of
Conversation, that you may also be as Lights unto the World, answering the
Witness of God in all, that none may have any thing against you, nor whereof to
accuse you, but only concerning your Obedience to the Law of your God; then
will you have strong Consolation in the Lord, and great Boldness and Confidence
toward him, and also in the sight of all men; and the Lord will increase your
Spiritual Substance, and will also enlarge your Borders, by daily adding to
your Number such as shall be saved. And so, the Everlasting God keep you all,
and be with and amongst you, and cause the plentious Showers of his Love to
descend amongst you, and refresh and consolate you therewith, that you may walk
cheerfully in his Presence, and not with Bowed-down Souls; but that every one
may possess his Soul in Peace, Amen.

And my Friends, Although some things, contained in this Epistle, may seem
strange unto many of you; yet those whom they concern will not be ignorant of
the ground of my thus writing; and for their sakes I have written with Boldness
and Plainness: And so the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits,
Amen.

From the Common Goal in Kendal, in Westmoreland, this 29th of the 7th Month,
1665. I am your dear Brother, a Sufferer for the Testimony of the blessed
unchangeable Truth; and hate the Garment spotted with the flesh, Josiah Coal.

An EPISTLE TO THE Flock of God WHO Are called to bear Testimony for the Name
of the Lord at this Day, through Sufferings: Sent unto them for the building up
of the Weak of the Flock in their Most Precious FAITH; and for the
strengthening of them in their Persecuted and Suffering Estate.
In which also (for their Encouragement) the Purpose of God in their present
Sufferings is declared.
My Beloved Dear Friends,
WHOM the Lord God Almighty has visited with his Everlasting Loving Kindness;
and unto whom he has caused the Everlasting Day to dawn, and the Son of
Righteousness to arise; and whom he has called out of the World, and separated
from its Ways, Worships, and Traditions, and from the Defilements and
Abominations thereof; that you might be a peculiar People unto himself, zealous
of Good-works, that he might make known unto you that Mystery of his Kingdom,
which has been hid from Ages and Generations past; that so you might stand
faithful and true Witnesses for his Name and Truth, and appear on his behalf in
the Demonstration of his own Life and Spirit; and that you might bear a
faithful Testimony for that Blessed, Everlasting, and Unchangeable Truth (which
he has manifested in your Inward Parts) not only in Doctrine, Life, and
Conversation, but also by suffering (for its sake) whatsoever the Enemies
thereof shall be permitted to inflict upon you, that thereby you may be
approved not only in the sight of God, but also of all good Men.

I say unto you, my beloved Friends, Prize your honorable and holy Calling,
wherewith the Lord Almighty has called you, and therein walk with God; and
think it not hard nor strange that he suffers you so long to be tried and
exercised in Sufferings, as you have been hitherto, and are at this day, for
your Testimony sake; but look over it all, and lift up your heads above all;
for the Lord has assuredly an End in it, for his own Glory, and for the
Exaltation and Spreading abroad that Blessed Truth, which we possess and live
in, and which we suffer for; and also for the gathering into it many, who are
yet far off from him, and Strangers unto him; so that whatsoever come, whether
Bonds or Exilement, or what Exercises soever we meet withal, in this we may be
satisfied, That it shall make for the Furtherance of the Gospel of Christ, and
for good unto all who continue their Obedience in him unto the End, and abide
faithful unto Death. Wherefore, my dear Friends, If the Lord see it meet
further to permit the Enemy to sift and winnow us, and that we must be further
tried; nay, if he should so order it, that we must be a suffering People all
our days; yet let none be weary or faint in your minds: For, In the Lord
JEHOVAH who is certainly with us) there is Everlasting strength; and he
faints not, neither is weary; but he gives power to the Faint, and to him
that has no might he increases strength: And so, let your Trust be in him,
and let that godly Resolution be put on (by every one of you) that was in Job,
who (when God suffered Satan to smite and afflict him) said, Though thou kill
me, yet will I trust in thee. And indeed, it is far better to suffer Persecution
with the People of God for good Conscience toward him, then to dwell in the
Tents of Wickedness, out of which God has called and redeemed us.

And my Friends, Consider, Whither can any go, or whether can any flee, to
escape Persecutions? Certainly I know no place; neither do I believe there is
any, professing Christianity, except it be in the Tents of Wickedness; For, he
that will live Godly in Christ Jesus must suffer Persecution. And if any, to
escape Persecutions and Sufferings, should return to the Tents of Wickedness
again; out of which, by the Power and Arm of God, they are brought; and should
disert their Testimony, which God has committed to them, to bear for his Name;
it would happen unto them (as the Apostle said) according to the old Proverb,
The Dog is turned to his Vomit, and the Sow that was washed to her wallowing in
the Mire: And the Hand of the Lord would find such out; and the Terrors of the
Almighty would certainly seize upon them, and surprise them, which would be
manifold more grievous to be borne, then all the Sufferings that man can
possibly inflict upon them: For its a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of
the Living God: for out of his Hands no man can deliver; but out of the hands
of Blood-thirsty and Wicked Men God can, and certainly in his own time will
deliver all who trust in him.

Wherefore (my dear Friends) Put on Boldness and Courage, in the Name of the
Lord, and stand valiant Witnesses for his Truth through all Sufferings, which
is the thing he has called you unto; that so you may answer the End for which
he has visited you, and made known himself unto you: For consider, Was it in
Loving Kindness and Compassion unto you, that the Lord visited you, and made
choice of you to be Witnesses for him, that his Name might be Glorified by you?
Or else, Was it because he had such need of you, that he could not Glorify his
Name without you? Surely all who are of an understanding Heart will confess and
acknowledge, that it was only in Love and Mercy unto you, that he thus made
choice of you to suffer for his Name, and to Glorify himself thereby, because
he can work for the Glory of his own Name, as he sees meet, without you, or any
of you; and can Magnify his Power in the Destruction or Desolation of a Nation
or People (as in time past he has done, and is doing at this day) though he
takes no Delight therein; and therefore he has no need of you for that End,
but you have need of him: So that its only in Love and Compassion toward you,
that he has thus visited you; and also, that you might have strong Consolation
in your Obedience unto him through all Sufferings, which he has called you
unto.

And therefore my Beloved Friends, Gird up the Loins of your minds; and keep
close to, and steadfast with the Lord; and with the Eye of Faith look over all
Tribulations, unto him that is invisible, who will out-last them all, and will
be with you in them, and through them all, and also, when they shall be no
more: For certainly Friends, God has determined, by and through these things,
to exalt his Kingdom, and to get himself a Name in the Earth above every Name,
that every Knee may bow, and every Tongue confess thereunto, unto his Praise
and Glory. And he has highly Honored us, in that he has been pleased to make
choice of us, and to accept of us to appear on his behalf, and (by Sufferings)
to contend for his Cause, and to bear Testimony in the Life of his Spirit
against all Idolatry and superstitious Inventions, which have gotten up in the
dark Night of Apostasy; for he has put the spiritual Weapon into our hands, by
the which the spiritual Wickednesses (that are in High Places) and the strong
Holds of Iniquity must be beat down; and in vain do the Inhabitants of the
Earth Combine, or take Counsel together, to stop or limit this Work of God,
which he has begun, and is carrying on amongst us; For he will certainly in
the end be too hard for them; and they must, and shall assuredly fall before
him, as their Predecessors did in times past (who opposed his Appearance in our
Forefathers) the Lord has spoken it: And no Weapons that is formed by them, or
that they shall Form, shall ever prosper or prevail, so as to accomplish their
Decree; for God has said it.

Wherefore my Friends, With one Heart, with one Mind, and with one Spirit serve
ye the Lord in newness of Life; and continue the Assembling of your selves
together in his Fear, to wait upon him, even as if these did not at all attend
you. And none be Slack or Backward in your TESTIMONY herein for fear of
Sufferings, lest hereby you do not only purchase the Displeasure of the LORD
against your selves, but also, weaken the hand of others, and thereby obtained
the greater Condemnation: But remember what happened to the Fearful and
Unbelieving Spies, who weakened the Hands of Israel of old, that they could not
enter the promised Land; for, these things were written for our learning, that
we should not tempt God as they tempted him, and were destroyed of the
Destroyer. For certainly Friends, this I have long seen, and sometimes declared
also, that if any, to whom the Visitation of God's Love has reached, and who
are now called to bear Witness to the Name of the Lord, by assembling
themselves together to wait upon him, and to worship him in Spirit, and have
been persuaded in their Consciences by the Light of his Son, that it was their
Duty so to do: I say, if such (for fear of Suffering for their Testimony
therein) shall forsake the Assembling of themselves together, (as the manner of
some has been) they will certainly bring upon themselves greater Sufferings,
even from the hands of men, and more grievous to be borne, then those which for
the assembling of our selves together seem now to be threatened; except they
wholly conform to worship the Image that is made unto the Beast, that had a
Wound and does live: and if so, then (as I said before) the Lord God will
assuredly find such out, which will be more heavy and grievous to bear then the
rest.

And therefore let all be Unanimous in your Testimony for the Lord, in this day
of trying and proving; and be a Strength and an Encouragement one unto another,
in that Gift of the Spirit of God, which from him you have received; and you
will certainly find and feel the Lord present with you, assisting and
furnishing of you with all heavenly Virtues, which are needful or necessary for
you in your present and future Exercises; and the Light of his Countenance you
will know to shine in your Tabernacle; and that is very precious, and pleasant,
and comely to behold: And indeed, its that alone which causes us to walk
cheerfully through all Trials and Exercises; and we experimentally know, that
he has not failed us hitherto, but has been always present with us to
deliver us out of many Distresses; yea, and assuredly will deliver us out of
all in his own time, which hasteneth, when the measure of the Sufferings of our
Lord and Master are filled up in us; for we must be thoroughly tried and proved
by Sufferings, and thereby be made manifest unto the Nations about us, to be
the peculiar People of God, before the measure of our Sufferings be full.

And my Friends, It is not the Purpose of God, by these Storms and Tempests,
that beat upon the Building of God (or by the Sufferings that attend us) to
suffer his Heritage or Building to be laid waste: No; but thereby to beat down
all False Building, and Outside Possessions, and to lay waste the Hills and
Barren Mountains, upon which the Whore sits, and to make her desolate; for
they, by clashing one against another, shall be broken one by another, or by
biting and devouring one another, will be destroyed one of another: But you, my
Beloved, who keep steadfast with the Lord through these things, shall thereby be
manifested in the view of all Nations to be the Building of God, whose standing
is upon the Rock of Ages (the Mountain of his Holiness) which all Storms, nor
the Gates of Hell cannot prevail against; and thereby he will also exalt his
own House (where Israel 's Fold is) above all the Hills and barren Mountains
(upon which we were sometime scattered, and from which we are now gathered by
the Arm and Power of God) that so thereunto the gathering of the Nations may
be, according to his Promise; for, was it not foreshewen by the Angel of the
Lord unto his Servant John, in times past, That the Horns of the Beast, that
should make War with the Saints (and whom the Saints should overcome) should
hate the Whore also, and make her desolate.

My Friends, Consider this; and in Patience and Confidence, that he is Faithful
that has promised, let us all wait upon the Lord, and be resigned up to be
disposed of according to the Counsel of his Will; and let him work, and carry
on, and prosper his own Work, as he sees meet: For its he alone that works
all our Works for us, and in us; and he knows what is best for us, and of what
we stand in need; and no Good Thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly: And we (who are in the Faith) know, that all things shall work for
our good, who love him above all; therefore let us give up our All unto him,
and cast our Care upon him, who takes care for us; whose Ways are
unsearchable, and his Judgments past finding out.

And so, my Beloved Friends, Keep to, and watch the weighty Foundation, which
stands sure through all Storms and Tempests; and walk together in Love, and
therein serve one another; and let none give place to that spirit which would
exercise Lordship over another; for that is not the serving Spirit, that is to
be submitted unto, which begets into Love, Meekness, and Gentleness; but
that spirit will rather beget a Root of Bitterness, which may defile many, and
therefore not to be heeded: But the Love being dwelt in, which vaunteth not it
self, nor seeks its own, but another good; that begets its own likeness: and
in this you will stir up and provoke one another to Love, and to good and
charitable Works; and then by you the Gospel of God will be adorned, and you
will have his Blessing and Peace in your hearts; which is of more Value, and
greater Price with the Upright in Heart, then all the Pleasure of sin, or Gain
of Oppression: And so, by your Stedfastness, Faithfulness, Sincerity, and
Simplicity in the Truth, you will even engage and provoke the Lord to appear on
your behalfs, and to plead your Cause with your Adversaries, and to shorten the
days of the Wicked for your sakes. And so the Almighty God of Love and Peace
be with you all, and multiply the Riches of his Grace, Mercy, and Peace unto
you all; that the Poor in Spirit may be enriched, the Weak and Feeble
strengthened, and the Sincere in Heart established and confirmed: And unto him
alone I do commit and commend you all, by whose Power and Love unfeigned I was
at this time constrained to send this Epistle unto you, to stir you up to
Faithfulness, Diligence, and Zeal toward God, and for his Cause; in which my
love toward you, and my care for you is manifested: in which I also kindly
salute you in the Bowels of Christ Jesus, whose Life is my Life, and whose Love
has filled my heart, in which I take my Solace and Rest.

From the Common Goal in Kendal, the place of my Confinement for the Testimony
of Jesus and for the Word of God, this 18th of the 7th Month, 1665. Your Dear
Brother, in the Tribulation, Kingdom, and Patience of Jesus, Josiah Coal.

An EPISTLE To Friends.
The First general EPISTLE.
DEar and Everlastingly beloved Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, whom in God s
Holy Covenant, and Power of an Endless Life my soul dearly loves, and to whom
I am firmly joined and united with the Spirit of the Living God, which he has
sent into our hearts; and by which we have been separated from the Ways, and
Worships, and vain Tradition of the World; amongst whom (in times past) we had
our Conversation, and walked according to the Lust of Ignorance, as other
Gentiles did: But now, being separated from these things by the Power of an
Endless Life, and being redeemed therefrom by the precious Blood of the Lamb
without Spot: And being made choice of, to be a peculiar People unto God, to
serve him in our Generation, and to be a Praise unto him; therefore now, my
beloved Friends, have Valor, and Boldness, and Courage every one in your
Hearts; and have the Loins of your minds girt about with Truth, that you may be
armed to fight the Lord's Battles, and be able to stand in the Evil Day, when
you shall be tried: And be you found watching every one in the Light and Gift
of the Spirit of the Lord God, so will not that Day come upon any of you at
unawares; but you will be found fitted and prepared to with-stand or resist the
Evil One in all his Wiles and Appearances, so that he shall not touch or harm
your precious Life; for, the Lord Almighty, in whom you have believed, and in
whom our Trust and Confidence is, he will renew your Strength, and will be a
Buckler unto you in the Day of Battle; and there will be no Faintness of Heart
nor Fear in your Way, but the Mighty POWER of God you will feel, by which you
will be able to tread upon the Necks of your Enemies, both within and without,
and tread Satan under Foot.

And so, my Friends, These things (in short) were in my Heart to write unto
you, in the full enjoyment of that Love with which you know right well we have
often been refreshed together; assuring you all, that the same Blessed Presence,
and Power, and Love of God, in which I have been amongst you, and by which I
have been called from amongst you, to bear Testimony to the Blessed Name of the
Lord (by which we are called) even to the Nations afar off) is still continued
with me; in which Love this is farther in my Heart to say unto you (although
you may very well know it already, yet that none may grow forgetful) that God
has many Ways to try the Faith of his People, both inwardly and outwardly;
and oft-times suffers the Enemy to work and exercise his power for that End;
and the Enemy will work very subtly if possible to deprive you of your Peace
with God: But my Friends, You keeping in the Power of an Endless Life (with
which God has certainly visited you) thereby your Understandings will be kept
clear, and your Hearts open toward God; and there all the Wiles and Subtilties
of the Enemy will be seen and discovered, and he defied and rejected, and
trampled upon in the Eternal Power of God: And herein you will be Victorious
and Conquerers over all Temptations, and over all Assaults of the Wicked one:
And herein you will have free Access to God, and Boldness toward God; and you
will all meet at the Throne of Grace, in the Unity of the Faith, in which you
will have Acceptance with the Lord. And here will be no Rent, nor Division, nor
Striving of Spirits; Nay, that must not enter which would have the pre-eminence
over others; for that will cause Divisions: but that must live in all, and over
all, which will be Servant to all; and therein are the Blessings of the Lord
enjoyed, and his Peace witnessed; and he will fill your Hearts with his Love,
and cause his Heritage to flourish; and will make you as a watered Garden,
whose Springs do not fail.

And now, my Friends, Consider what the Lord has done for you: Has he done so
for any other People upon the Earth; or did he more for his People in any Age
or Generation (since the beginning) then he has done for us? Or, Are any able
to speak more of the Wonders of the Lord, and of the Greatness of his Work, and
of the Strangeness of his Act at this Day then we are (who are accounted by the
Uncircumcised but as the Offscouring of all things?) Nay verily: And therefore
may it be said, That us has he known above all the Families of the Earth. And
this, my Friends, may engage all, and constrain all, to walk worthy of this
matchless Love, that the same with which he has reached unto you, and visited
you, may be continued unto you, and may abound in you all one toward another,
that you may all know you are the Children of your Father which is in Heaven;
and in this you will be as Lights unto the World, and as a City set upon a Hill
which cannot be hid; you will appear fresh in the Beauty of Holiness, as the
Heritage of God in its flourishing state, in which my Unfeigned Love is dear to
you all who are faithful to God; and in this I do salute you all, without
respect of Persons; for dear are you to me and precious, and every Member of
the true Church of Christ, in all Regions and Quarters of the Earth: And God
Almighty keep you and preserve you all unto his Heavenly Kingdom, Amen.

London, this 12th of the 3d Month, 1663. I am your Dear Brother, in the
Patience and Tribulation of the Son of God, in whom we rejoice daily, Josiah
Coal.

AND Friends, This know, that for the sake of the residue of our Seed, which is
yet ungathered, is my Life freely sacrificed up into the Hand of the Lord, and
ready and willing am I to lay it down (for the Testimony of God's Blessed
Truth, which he has given me to bear) if thereunto I am called: For, Bonds and
Afflictions attend me daily; and I may say, We are hear in Jeopardy of our
Lives daily.

So let your Prayers to God be for me, that I may be kept unto the End, to
finish my Testimony with Joy, and in all things to bring Glory and Honor to
the Name of the Lord, who is over all Blessed forever.

An EPISTLE To Friends.
The Second general EPISTLE.
FRIENDS,
ALL who are convinced of the Truth of the Evelasting Gospel, and have believed
the Report that has been given amongst you concerning the great Salvation of
God; and who have been persuaded in your Hearts and Consciences, by the Light
and Spirit of the Lord, that it is your Duty unto God to meet together to wait
upon him, and to worship him in Spirit and in Truth, and have been drawn by
this Spirit of Truth to the performance of this Religious Duty.

I say, my Friends, You know right well, that Gloriously and Plentifully the
Lord did appear amongst you in your Assemblies, when you first began the
Exercises thereof; and he made his Power known amongst you; and thereby wrought
in your Hearts mightily and effectually, to the bringing down and subjecting of
that which had darkened and veiled Life and Immortality from your sight and
view; and by which you were made Strangers thereunto: And this same Power of
God, through the effectual working and operating of it, did raise Life, and
bring Immortality to Light in you; so that you were no longer as Strangers unto
it, but were brought into acquaintance therewith; and your hearts and souls
were abundantly Refreshed and Consolated therewith; and through the arising
thereof and thereby you became more fully confirmed in your first Faith, which
was begotten in you by the Word; and then a Godly Zeal and Resolution more
fervently arose in your hearts, to continue this Practice, and perform this
Duty of Assembling your selves together, which at first you believed you ought
to do; and then did the Lord so eminently appear amongst you, that by his
Spirit he sealed unto you your Acceptance with him in the performance of this
Duty; and then you farther saw and believed, That whatsoever Suffering should
come upon you for the continuance of this Religious Exercise, yet you ought to
persevere and continue therein, and to hold fast the Profession of your first
Faith; and also the practice of the thing which you believed to be your Duty
unto God.

And you right well know, That many Trials and Sufferings have attended you
since you first began to contend for this Faith, and to make a Profession
thereof, and to practice the thing which you believed was your Duty unto God;
but the Lord was always with you, and assisted you with his Spirit and Power
in the midst thereof, even all who were singly resigned up unto him, and did
persevere and continue in their due Obedience unto him; and he never left nor
forsook such in any Trial or Tribulation, but always ministered unto them in
the midst thereof according to their necessities; and this I know the Witness
of God in all the Upright in Heart shall seal unto.

And now my dear Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, the Consideration and
Remembrance of these things are sufficient to encourage every one, and to stir
them up, and provoke them to hold fast their Godly Resolution, which they put
on in the beginning; and to persevere and continue in all Faithful Obedience in
this Duty, while they have Liberty and Opportunity so to do: And if for your
Faithfulness, and Obedience therein, the Devil be suffered to cast you into
Prison, and to Exile you for the Gospel's sake, Yet the Lord will be with you
there, he has said it, and will perform his word; so that you need not fear
what Man can do unto you; for the Lord, will support and comfort you in the
midst of all your Sufferings, as in times past: but if any draw back, or fall
from their first Stedfastness, and forsake the assembling of themselves
together, for fear of Sufferings and Pesecutions, and think thereby to escape
the Penalty of the unrighteous Laws of men; then will the Lord take no pleasure
in such; but will withdraw his Love and Presence; and his wonted Goodness will
he withhold from such; and instead of Peace, there will be Trouble unto them;
and Sorrow instead of Joy; and instead of Plenty and Fullness of the Riches of
God's Grace, there will be Poverty, and Emptiness, and Want; and Barrenness
instead of Fruitfulness: For He, with whom we have to do, can turn a Fruitful
Land into Barrenness, for the Iniquity of them that dwell therein: And indeed,
it is better to dye for the Cause of God, then to live out of his Favor.

Wherefore my Dear Friends, All dwell and watch in the Light, our first
Principle, that the subtilty of the Enemy may be discovered thereby, in all his
Assaults and Alurement; and keep in a state resigned unto the Lord, out of all
Reasonings and Consultations with Flesh and Blood; for they let in Temptations,
and thereby you may be snared; but as you stand singly given up to follow the
Lord through all Trials and Sufferings, that may come upon you for the Gospels
sake, there will be nothing wanting unto you that appertains to the Peace, and
Comfort, and to the Joy, and Salvation of your Souls.

And Friends, This I have seen in the Light of God's Truth and Salvation, and
this has been long upon my Heart to declare unto you, That if any are any whit
wavering in their Minds, they may be forewarned, that if the Enemy should so
far prevail with any, as to put them upon seeking out a Way to escape the
present Sufferings, which attend the Flock of God, as Imprisonment, Exilement,
etc. yet I say unto you, and you shall find it to be true, that the same Enemy
will find out another Way to bring such wholly to conform to his Worship and
Image set up; or else will bring a worse Suffering upon them, and more grievous
to be borne then that which now is threatened.

Wherefore my Dear Friends, Partakers of the Heavenly Calling in Christ Jesus,
Put on Valor, and Boldness, and Courage for the Cause of God which we are now
engaged in; and stand fast in that Liberty wherewith Christ our Lord has made
you free; and be nothing terrified because of the Rage of the Enemies of God's
Truth; but whereunto you have already attained there abide, and hold fast that
which you have already received, lest you lose your Crown; and keep out of
Consultings with flesh and Blood, lest you be thereby entangled with the Yoke
of Bondage; for, the Flesh is weak, and not willing to bear Sufferings; but the
Spirit is willing; and as it is inclined unto, and obeyed, and followed in its
Motions and Leadings, it makes willing to bear and endure all things, and to
suffer the loss of all things for the sake of the Lord Jesus; rhetefore let
none ( Esau like) sell his Birthright for a Mess of Pottage; but like Worm
Jacob, wrestle with the Lord in his own Strength, that you may prevail as
Princes, and obtain the Inheritance incorruptible, that never fades away;
which is the earnest Desire and Prayer of him, who dearly loves and salutes the
whole Flock of God in every Region and Quarter of the Earth.

To the Elect of God Every where, Called and Chosen in Christ Jesus before the
World, and before Transgression was (in which the World lies:) The Salutation
of Love, Mercy, and Peace, from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
The Third general EPISTLE.
DEartly Beloved Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, For as much as the Almighty
Power and Arm of the Lord has been stretched forth unto you in this Day of his
Love, by which you have been gathered out of the dark Paths, which the World
walks in; and have been cleansed from the Polutions and Defilements which many
yet lie wallowing in; and have been separated from the Abominations of the
World by the Word of his Power, which sanctifies unto himself; and has
administered unto you an Entrance into that Kingdom, which is not of this World,
and which fades not away, where you are made Partakers of the Durable Riches
and Everlasting Treasure, with which your Hearts have been filled from day to
day, and from time to time; yea manifold has his Benefits, and Mercies, and
Goodness been unto you; and often has he caused your Cups to overflow; so that
you could say in your Hearts, That you had received your souls Desire, and were
fully satisfied; and your Souls did Bless, Magnify, and Praise the Name of the
Lord, the God of your Salvation; who has done so great things for you, even
beyond declaring; who brought deliverance unto you in the time of great
Affliction and Distress; when you were compassed about with many Sorrows, and
saw none to comfort you; when you were even in the horrible Pit, and saw your
selves at a great Distance from your Maker (by reason of Sin and Transgression)
and were in your own eyes even shut up in Darkness and in Obscurity, then did
the Distressed cry unto the Lord, and he heard the Cries and Groanings thereof,
and was moved with Compassion toward his own Seed, and he arose in his mighty
Power, and stretched forth his Glorious Arm, and reached unto his own Elect,
and thereby brought Deliverance thereunto: And so the Oppressed came to be set
free, and the Distressed to be set at liberty; and this was the Day of
Glad-tidings unto you, and the acceptable Year of the Lord, though a Day of
Vengeance came upon the Wicked and Ungodly, and upon that part which had led
your minds astray, and to transgress the pure Law and holy Commandment of the
Lord And so, my Dearly Beloved, The Lord having done so great things for you,
in bringing you out of the Egyptian Darkness, and out of the waste howling
Wilderness; and has brought you into a Plentiful Land, flowin with Milk and
Honey; and with the good things thereof has he satisfied you, and abundantly
filled you time after time; therefore now rememember, and beware that you
forget not the Lord, nor his wondrous Works; but dwell in his eternal Power,
by which he has done these things for you; and walk in all Humility before
him, answering the motion of his Pure Holy Spirit, by which you are quickened
unto Life, that you may know it continually to remain in you; that so by it you
may be kept alive unto God: And this Spirit may be your Leader and Instructor
in all things; so will you have the Testimony thereof in your own particulars,
to bear Witness for you that you are his Children; For they only are the Sons
of God, that are led by his Spirit; and they only have the Testimony of it
witnessing for them, that are faithful Followers thereof: and such enjoy Peace
and Consolation from the Lord, which is more to be valued and esteemed than all
things visible; for they are perishing, and last but for a Moment; but the
Precious Truth of the Lord, of which you are made Partakers, that is
Everlasting, and lives and abides forever; therefore let that be prized above
all things else, which in comparison thereof is but as Dross and Dung; and so
it was in your eye when full the Glory thereof appeared in you. And you know
full well what you have parted with to purchase the Possession of it: Therefore
let none sell his Birthright for a Mess of Pottage; but let it be forever in
your Eye esteemed above all things under the Son. And let not the Subtilty of
the Enemy draw any ones Mind into the love of any perishing thing, nor into the
fear of the Threatenings of Man, whose Breath is in his Nostrils; but stand in
the pure Fear and Dread of the living God, and continually set him before your
Eyes: and beware of entering into Consultations with Flesh and Blood; for
thereby you may fall into the Snare of the Enemy, and be overcome by his Wiles;
but give up simply and freely to whatsoever you are called to, either to do or
suffer for his Name's sake, and for his Truth's sake, in your several Places
and Callings; that so a Faithful Testimony for his Name may be given by every
one who makes mention thereof, and that professes his Eternal Truth; and of
this be assured, He will be your exceeding great Reward: but if any draw back,
or hanker in their Minds, and through letting in of Slavish Fears, deny the
Lord who has purchased them unto himself by his own Blood, by which he has
cleansed your Hearts, that so you might become a fit Habitation for his own
Spirit to dwell in: I say, If any, through the fear of Man, deny him in any
thing that he calls unto, then they lose their Reward, and lose their Peace
with God; and the Pangs and Anguish of Heart will take hold on them; and the
Sorrows of Death shall compass them about, even as before they were delivered
from their former Troubles, and so they will bring themselves under the heavy
Yoke of Bondage again, and the Countenance of the Lord will be hid from them,
and a Cloud of Darkness will come over them, and Misery will be their Portion
from the Lord God, who is the Joy of the Righteous, and the Rewarder of all who
obey him; and out of this Condition it will be hard to be removed, and to be
restored again into the Favor of the Lord.

And so my dear Friends, Prize your Peace with him above all things visible;
and so walk as that you may be preserved therein: And wait upon him in the Gift
which you have received from God, and you will feel his Everlasting Blessings
to flow in upon you, and his Mercies and Loving-kindnesses will be renewed unto
you Morning by Morning, whereby you will be abundantly refreshed, and be kept
living unto the Lord; and a daily growth you will witness from Strength to
Strength, and from one Degree of Grace unto another, until you appear before
the Lord in Sion, in complete Beauty and perfect Holiness.

And so, as you in Patience wait upon the Lord, and walk before him in his
Covenant of Grace; and dwell in his Pure Holy Power, and be subject thereunto
in all its Leadings and Requirings; then you will see the Lord pleading your
Cause in the Hearts of your Enemies, and working your enlargement and Liberty
by his own secret Hand of Power; by which he will turn back the powers of
Darkness, and remove the Seat of Violence, and will exalt his own Kingdom and
Righteousness in the Earth, and Oppression shall be far away; for this is his
Decree and Determination; and those that rise up against him in this day of his
Appearance, or oppose him in his Work, such shall be scattered by the Breath of
his Mouth, even as Chaff is scattered before the Wind: And then shall the
Righteous rejoice, and be glad in the God of their Salvation. And so you will
see that all these Trials and Sufferings which shall come upon any of you,
shall work for your everlasting Good, and for the Glory of the Lord, and shall
make for the furtherance of the Glorious Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who
is the Captain of our Salvation, and was made perfect through Suffering, and is
now set upon his Throne, at the Right Hand of the Father, to judge the World in
Righteousness; to whose Scepter and Dominion all Powers, Thrones, and Dominions
must bow, and bend, and become subject; for the Mouth of the Lord has spoken
it.

And therefore let none faint in their minds, because of the present Rage of
the Adversary, but look unto him who lifts up the Head above the Raging Waves
of the Sea, and you will see him to arise, who will rebuke the Rage of the
Devourer, and will cause a great Calm.

And so, my dearly beloved Friends, Keep in the Covenant of Peace and Life; and
feel the pure Power of the Lord God Almighty to bound you, and compass you
about; and feel your Unity and Fellowship in it with the Lord, and one with
another; and watch over one another in Love; and build up one another in your
Most Holy Faith; so will you have dominion over the World, and come to know the
Earth to be your Footstool; and so in and through him, who has manifested his
eternal Love in you, you will be more than Conquerors, even through his eternal
Power, who subdueth all thing unto himself, that he may Reign over all whose
right it is, and unto whom the Kingdom does belong; and unto him be Glory and
living Obedience for ever, Amen.

And so, the Lord God of Power and Love be amongst you all, and fill you with
his Love and Power, that so you may be kept out of the Snares of the Evil One
(for that has often been the Breathing of my Soul for you in secret) and that
you may walk before him in the Purity of his holy Spirit, and be kept unspotted
from the World: And so, in the Bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ do I most dearly
and tenderly salute you all, who are of the Family of my Father, and of the
Household of Faith; and the God of Love and Peace be with you all.

Barbados, this third Mon. 1661. I am your Dear Brother, in the Patient
Long-Suffering Spirit of our Lord and Master, and a Traveller for the
Redemption of the Oppressed Seed, Josiah Coal.

To the Called of God Every where, who are Witnesses of the Eternal Excellency
of the SON of RIGHTEOUSNESS; Who is now appeared in his Majesty and Glory, in
this Day of the FATHER'S LOVE to the Children of Men.
The Fourth general EPISTLE.
MY Dear and Everlastingly well beloved Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, with
whom in the Covenant of Life, and Kingdom of Peace, Glory, and Eternal Felicity
my soul rests, and is at Peace and perfect Freedom; where the Glorious Presence
of the God of Life (who is Jacob's Shepherd) is enjoyed; and is known to be an
open Fountain, daily administering of his Heavenly Rich Virtue and Goodness, to
the consolating and refreshing of our Immortal Souls; so that we have no need
to complain of Poverty, because he (who is the Fountain of all Good) is
continually with us, and never ceases to administer into his own, according to
their several Necessities, as in his pure Fear and Power they wait upon him,
and walk before him: And this I know many of you are not unsensible of, for
whom a Feast of Fat Things is prepared, and a Table richly decked is spread
before you; where every hungry one may feed, and be refreshed; and the Breast
of Consolation is also known, at which every Babe may suck, and be satisfied;
and so all having access unto this, you may here be delighted with the
abundance of the Treasure of my Father's Heavenly Kingdom; the Windows whereof
being now opened, a Blessing is poured forth without measure.

Oh! that all who profess the Name of the Lord were thoroughly sensible of this
thing! then would their souls (with us) delight in Fatness, and their hearts
would be enlarged thereby; so that they would find Encouragement to run the Way
of his Commandments even with Delight; and nothing would be counted too dear
to part withal for his sake, who has called us (and is bringing many Sons and
Daughters) unto Glory and Virtue.

Wherefore my dearly beloved Friends, be ye encouraged to walk on in the Way of
the Lord, though it be strait to the Earthly Man; and be ye content to pass
through Evil-Report, and Good-Report; and let him be your Example in all
things, who, when he was reviled, he reviled not again; and when he suffered,
he threatened not, but committed it to him who judges Righteously; as a Lamb
before the Shearer is Dumb, so he opened not his Mouth.

Therefore I say Friends, Let none be discouraged because of Trials, and
Sufferings, and Persecutions, nor because of the Frowns of the Enemy for God's
Truth, neither be Dismayed because of the prosperity of the Wicked, whose Day
shall pass away swiftly, and shall be no more: but every one put on Strength,
and Courage, and Boldness in the Name of the Lord; and as valiant Soldiers,
endure Hardship, and fight the Good Fight of FAITH, and lay holy on Eternal
Life; for the Lord God Almighty is with us, and take our part; and he assuredly
will fight our Battles for us, before whom all the Nations of the Earth are but
as the Drop of a Bucket; and therefore its in vain for them to contend with the
Almighty, who is on our side, and is greater in us then he that is in the
World; whose eternal Glory and Excellency is now revealed; Praises and
Halelujahs to the Most High forever.

Wherefore Arise, arise, thou Seed of the Covenant, arise and shine, for thy
Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is arisen upon thee; though the Earth
be covered with Darkness, and gross Darkness be over the People, yet the Lord
is become thy Everlasting Light, and thy God thy Glory: Wherefore shake thy
self from the Dust of Earth, and put on thy beautiful Garments, Oh Jerusalem,
the holy City; for this I testify in the Name of the Lord, That henceforth
there shall not come into thee the Uncircumcised, nor the Unclean; but thou
shall be called the City of God, the Place wherein his Honor dwells. Wherefore
all ye Inhabitants thereof, my Fellow Citizens, and beloved Brethren and
Sisters, with whom my Life is bound up, and with whom my soul rejoices; who
are surrounded with the great Salvation of God, and know it to be the Wall of
this Holy City, the Gates whereof is Praise, and stand open Night and Day,
though the Unclean cannot enter into it: I say unto you all, Let the High
Praises of God be in your Mouths; and cease not to make mention of the Wonders
of the Lord, and of his Works, which he has wrought for you; and tell of his,
Goodness and Loving Kindness, and speak of his Praises; that the Glory of his
Appearance in you may be admired amongst the Heathen, in this the Day of the
Lords Power, wherein his Excellency and Majesty is seen, of which we are
Eyewitnesses; and therefore can we not cease to make known his Power and
Coming, that others also may be turned to the Light of God in them, their to
wait for his Appearance.

And though there be a Generation that would have us silenced, as the Pharisees
would have Christ to rebuke his Disciples, when they went Triumphing to
Jerusalem, and the High Praises of God were in their Mouths, yet they were not
to hold their peace, but to go on, and preach his Name amongst all Nations,
that People might be turned unto God. And though they were again afterward
charged to speak no more in his Name; yet they considered, That it was better
to obey God than Man: For they who followed the Lamb were Called, and Chosen,
and Faithful; and they loved not their Lives unto the Death, but went on boldly
preaching in the Name of Jesus, not regarding the Threatenings of corrupt Man,
but had respect unto the Lord above all, who is the same at this day as ever he
was; and his Faithfulness is the same forever unto them that are truly Faithful
unto him.

And his wondrous Works, and Majesty, and Glory is now seen by us, in this our
Day, even as by them in the days of old; wherefore let the same Courage,
Boldness, and Faithfulness appear amongst you, as was in them; though I do not
at all upbraid you, neither was it in my Heart so to do; but as a Brother of
the same Root and Offspring with you (who are begotten by the same Word, and
brought forth by the same eternal Womb, which is Holy forever) do I exhort you
in Bowels of the same tender Love, with which our Hearts are filled, to
continue in Stedfastness, and hold fast your Integrity in Faithfulness unto the
End every one in your several Stations and Callings, that you may adorn the
Glorious Gospel of Peace and of Salvation; that so, you dwelling in the Pure,
Divine, Heavenly Power, thereby your Lips may be opened, and your Mouths may
show forth his Praise; that his Name may be known to be great in the Assemblies
of his Saints, and in the Congregations of the Righteous; that so Nations may
be gathered unto him, and Kings unto the Brightness of his Rising; that so the
Name of the Lord may be spread even to the Ends of the Earth, which is now to
be exalted above every Name, to which every Knee must bow, and all Tongues
confess.

Wherefore all you my beloved Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, who are of the
Royal Offspring, and of the Holy Seed, which is the Heir of the Blessing and
Promise of the Father: I say unto you all, dwell in the feeling of the Immortal
Birth, every one in your own particulars; for therein the Heirship stands, and
to that the Blessing is sure; and as you keep Faithfully joined unto it,
therein you will know the Heavenly Dominion and Power, which goes over the
Powers of the Earth and Darkness (with which the Earth is covered) and will
give you to see before they were.

And here the Son is known, who was glorified with the Father before the World
began, and who is the express Image of his Father's Substance, and in whom the
Fullness of the Godhead dwells, and unto whom all Power in Heaven and in Earth
is given. And this is he, who now is come in Power and great Glory, of whose
Power and Coming you are his Cloud of Witnesses, who know the Birth of the
Immortal Seed; and it is because of this that the Heathen rages, and the
Nations are angry; and therefore do they Revile, and Persecute, and Smite with
the Fist of Wickedness, according as it is written, He that is born after the
Flesh persecutes him that is born after the Spirit: And these things they do
unto you, because they know not him, of whose Coming you are Witnesses.
Nevertheless, Dwell ye in the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit ye that have the
sense and feeling of the working and operating thereof in your inward Parts in
any measure, and answer the Motions thereof in all things; for therein your
Peace and Consolation consists, and your Everlasting Refreshment, which none
can hinder you of, as you obey the Truth according to the Motions of the Spirit
of Truth; and therein walking, you will not fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh; but
the Cross will be dwelt in, and Self-denial will be known and witnessed, and
the Power of the Lord will be felt, which makes willing to come into the
Obedience of the Cross, whereby the contrary part will be crucified; and
mortified and the Old Man will be wholly put off with his Deeds, and the New Man
put on, which is created after God in Righteousness and true Holiness. And so
here walking every one in your own measures, in Faithfulness to the Lord, you
will feel the Lord administering unto you of his rich Virtue to the filling of
your Hearts, and to the making of your Cups to overflow; for this I testify
unto you, and that by the Spirit of the Lord, That the Lord's Love, and
Mercies, and the Riches of his Grace did never more abound in the Hearts of his
People, in any Age or Generation, than it does in this our Day, in the Hearts
of all who obey and follow him; and give up freely unto him in all his Leadings
and Requirings.

And therefore once more I say unto you, my Beloved Ones, give up in singleness
to follow the Lord, in whatsoever he leads you unto. And walk with him in the
Power of his own Spirit of Life; and let the Righteousness of God go before
you, and his Everlasting Glory shall be your Reward.

And so, Dear Hearts, Feel your selves covered with the Spirit of Life; for
that shall and will remain when all false Coverings shall be ripped off, and all
empty Professions, and outside Shows will wither, and have an end, and come to
nothing. Therefore ye, as Wise Virgins, have Oil in your Lamps; and see that
your Lamps be kept trimmed and burning, that so you may be kept ready at all
times, to enter in with the Bridegroom into his Marriage Chamber; so will you
have Joy, and Felicity, and Gladness of Heart; and no cause of Sorrow will
there be while you enjoy the Bridegroom of your Souls present with you; who
will be an everlasting Comforter unto you, with whom you will know an
Everlasting REST: And that Peace you will be Heirs of (and possess) which
passes the Understanding of the World; and in this you will have strong
Consolation and Comfort, even that which can never be blasted: but whatsoever
flourishes, and may seem prosperous for a time, if it be not in and by the
Power of the Lord, that will the Lord blast, and cause to wither as the Flower
of the Grass; and this your Eyes shall see, if you keep in the eternal Power of
the Lord, which keeps the invisible Eye open, which alone perceives the things
of God. So in the pure Power of the Lord dwell and keep, that you may be kept
in a clear Discerning, and sensible of your own particular Conditions, and how
it stands with you in the Presence of the Lord, that you may know your Peace
and Unity with him, and one with another; that so all being kept in the Power
and Unity of the one Spirit, in that you may exhort one another, and so much
the more as you see the Day approaching; that so you may be strengthened one by
another, and may build up one another in the Precious Living Truth, and therein
edify one another in Love, that so you may stand over the World, and over that
part in which the Enmity stands, which is against God; so will it appear unto
all men, That you are the People which God has Blessed.

And now my dearly beloved Friends, These few Lines have I written unto you
from the aboundings of the Love of my heavenly Father, which he has shed
abroad in my heart toward you all, and by this Love only was I constrained
thereunto; wherein (in some measure) is manifested that real and unfeigned Love
which dwells in me, and daily extends it self unto the whole Household of Faith,
wheresoever they are; with whom I am at this time even wrapped up with the
Garment of Praise: And in the pure Unity of the Spirit of Life, and Endless
Unspotted Love, do I purely salute you all, leaving you to the Protection of
the Almighty, whose tender Care is over all his, and watches over his own
Inheritance Night and Day; so that the Devourer cannot prevail to lay it waste
nor desolate.

Wherefore let your Confidence and Trust be in him always, and continue you in
the Grace of God which has appeared, and the Sufficiency thereof you will more
and more see and witness daily. And Blessed (in the Name of the Lord God
Almighty) are all they whose Trust and Confidence is in him alone; for they
shall never be ashamed nor confounded, but shall be as Mount Sion, which cannot
be moved.

So the Lord God Almighty of Heaven and Earth keep you all, and preserve you
all in the enjoyment of the Fullness of the Blessing of the Gospel of Peace,
where you all may know the Rest to remain, that neither Storms can disturb
you, nor Tempests make you afraid; in which I am with you all who are of the
Family of God.

AN INVITATION OF LOVE TO THE HUNGRY and THIRSTY, Who truly hunger after the
Food of Life; and a Call (to such) to come (from off the Barren Mountains, and
from feeding upon vanity) into the Everlasting Kingdom and House of my Father,
where the least of his Servants have Bread enough: With some Information of the
Way which leads thereunto.
EVery one that hungers, and every one that thirsts, and every one that breaths
after Righteousness, Come, the Fountain of Life is opened, and the Everlasting
God of Jacob is arisen in this day of his Power, to gather unto himself the
dispersed of Israel, into his Everlasting Fold of Rest, and into his
Everlasting Covenant of Light, Life, and Peace, with him to dwell; And for this
very end has he caused the Eternal Light of his Son to shine forth, and has
set up his Standard, and displayed his Ensign (to the Nations) to which the
gathering is; and the Call is gone forth, and the Spirit bids, Come, and every
one that hears, let him Come, and drink of the water of Life freely; For the
Fountain is now opened; and the true Shepherd now Calls; and his voice is
heard; and all who are wandering upon the barren Mountains, and in desolate
places, and are weary and heavy laden with sin, may Come, and follow (him who
leads to the Everlasting Fold of Rest, which is) Jesus Christ the true
Shepherd, and the Light of the World, and Way to the Father; who is now arisen
in this his Day for his Seeds sake; to gather his Sheep from off the Barren
Mountains, where they have been scattered and driven away, in the dark and in
the cloudy day; And to make manifest the way of Life freely, to all who hearken
to his Counsel, and obey his voice, who declares unto man what is his thoughts;
And by his Light makes manifest the Secrets of the heart, and reproves the
deeds of darkness; by which all who are guided by it, comes to receive power
over sin, which made a separation between God and you: And this is he (which
the Holy Prophets of God prophesied of, in the days of old) who is given a
Light to lighten the Gentiles, and for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth: And
whom Moses said the People should hear, and said, that he that would not hear
this Prophet, which the Lord should raise up (to wit) Christ Jesus the Light of
the World; Even he should be Cut off from amongst the People; and therefore
every one, you being enlightened with a measure of the Light which comes from
this Prophet, Christ Jesus, by whom the World was made, and whom the people is
to hearken to; it is a thing of concerment to you all, to wait to hear his
voice, who calls your minds out of the vanities of the World, and the love
thereof, that you may hear and live, and no longer to spend your labor for
that which does not satisfy the soul; But to hearken diligently to the Voice
of God (who is Light) that you may come to eat of that which is good, and let
your Souls delight in fatness; and so every out who prizeth the Everlasting
Peace and welfare of your Souls, beyond the pleasures and delights of the
World; Return unto him who calls in your minds out of the visible and perishing
things of this World, and the love thereof; and wait to know the Sword of the
Lord Jesus Christ (who is the Prince of Peace) to Cut down the Transgressor in
every particular of you; and to know the Righteous Law of God revealed in you,
to take hold on the unrighteous Nature which has led you into Rebellion
against God, and against his pure witness in you, which has long called for
purity, and for a holy Life, and a godly Conversation; that so into purity and
holiness you might all come, without which none can see the Lord; And so they
who comes to the Light of Christ in them, such comes to that which is pure, and
holy, with which they may come to see God.

And Friends, This is the Word of the Lord God to you all, and his Everlasting
Counsel to you all, who have desires in Truth and Righteousness to walk in the
way of Life? that you hearken diligently to the Voice of God, the Light in
every one of your Consciences, and to it be obedient at all times, in
whatsoever it makes manifest to be the mind and Will of God the Father; that so
his will may be done by you in Earth, as it is in Heaven; and that your sins
and iniquities may be blotted out (by him) for his own Names sake; Who is now
arisen for his Glories sake, which has been long trampled upon, and for his
Seeds sake which has long cried unto him, from under the burden of oppression,
which has ruled above the pure in every one of you; And the Cries and
Groanings of the Oppressed, has entered into the Ears of the Lord God of Rest,
and he is arisen and is zealous for his Glory; And in the valley of Judgment
will he plead with Egypts King, and with all the Host of the Egyptians, and by
his outstretched Arm will he bring deliverance unto his own Elect Seed, and
the Host of the Egyptians will he destroy in the Red Sea of his Wrath, and then
shall the Seed rejoice over its Oppressors.

And so Friends, as you hearken to, and obey the Voice of the Lord, the Angel
of his presence you will see leading you in the way in which he will have you
to walk; and beware of him, and obey his voice, for he will not at all pardon
your transgressions any more, Exodus 23.20, 21. But will give a just reward to
every one according to their deeds, whether they be good, or whether they be
evil: And so that you may come and receive the reward of Everlasting Life,
which is enjoyed in my Fathers Kingdom; Every one be good and faithful
Servants, and improve your Talents which is committed to you, that so when the
Lord shall come, you may be found doing his will, and not your own; So shall an
entrance be Administered unto you into the Kingdom which is without end, where
you may feed on the Heavenly Manna, and drink of the water of Life, out of the
Wells of Salvation, even abundantly, and be filled and your Souls satisfied
therewith.

And so Friends and people; arise and come out of Death, you that have desires
after the way of Life and Salvation Which is now Preached freely, and be all
obedient to the measure of the Grace of God (which brings Salvation) which
has appeared unto you, and believe in the Light which you are enlightened
withal; for says Christ, I am the Light of the World, he that believes in me
shall not abide in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life; and this is the
sure word of Prophecy, unto which you do well if you take heed, as unto a
light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn and the Day Star arise in
your hearts, which Star being followed, will lead unto the knowledge of the
Savior, as it did the wise men who found him lying in a manger, for there was
no room for him in the Inn, because it was full of other guests (him that reads
let him understand) and so when you have found him according to the Angels
Inteligence, though it be but in a low place, in you, yet wait to know him to
grow in stature, and you in him to increase in Wisdom, and in Favor with God;
for truly People, no Union nor Fellowship with God can be known by you, until
you come to be Obedient to the Son of God, and to hear him in whom the Father
is well pleased, and in whom alone we are accepted of God, and by whom we have
free access to his Throne of Grace, where he sits at the Right hand of the
Majesty on High, Judging and Condemning all who walk contrary to his Light, and
that disobey the Gospel which is now Preached; and justifies and gives life
unto all that obey and follow him, and stand in his Counsel; which is the
desire of my Soul that you all may do, who have desires in the least measure
after this Life of Holiness; And for your sakes have I written these Lines
according as the Lord gave it me by his Spirit;

Who am a true lover of all your Souls, and a Labourer and Traveller for the
Seeds sake which is Scattered throughout the Earth; That those who are
wandering upon the Barron Mountains, and in desolate places, may be gathered
into the Everlasting Rest, and Fold of Jesus Christ, with me to lie down in
peace and safety, where none can make us afraid. Josiah Coal.

A SALUTATION TO THE Suffering-Seed OF GOD Wherein the Things are Declared and
Signified beforehand that must shortly come to pass.
DEarly beloved Friends, Brethern and Sisters, Babes, Lambs and Children, who
are of the Election of Grace, and of the true Shepherds Fold, whom it has
pleased my heavenly Father in his Love, Life and Spirit, to gather out of the
World, and to sepatate from amongst men, to be the first fruits unto Him, and
to the LAMB, in this Day of his Power and glorious Appearance, and has
manifested his Power, and revealed his glorious Arm of Strength in and amongst
you, and has made known his blessed, sweet, refreshing Presence in the midst
of you, whereby you have been refreshed, comforted and strengthened in the
midst of many Trials, Tribulations and Temptations, which have been suffered to
come upon you for the trial of your Faith since you were a People unto him: and
you know right well, that he has not been wanting unto you in any state or
condition that you have been brought into, as you abode faithful unto him: And
the mighty things which he has done for you, and the great delieverances which
he has brought unto you in the time when you were in great distress, surely
cannot be forgotten by you, but is worthy to be had in everlasting remembrance:
And the things which you have seen of this kind, and the endless
loving kindness of God unto you therein manifested, is and (I hope) will be for
ever sufficient to engage you to walk with the Lord in singleness and
uprightness of heart, that in all trials of what nature or kind soever that you
meet withal for the future time, you may hold fast your testimony for him, and
your Faith and Confidence in him, and be nothing daunted in your minds hearts,
nor spirits, but in all things give up unto the Lord, and resign up your Cause
unto him alone, and he will certainly plead for you in the hearts of your
Enemies, and they shall assuredly know that his controversy is very great with
them for your sakes: For he has regard unto your sufferings, and the Cries and
deep Groans of his Oppressed suffering Seed, is continually before him, and he
is near to bring deliverance unto all who in patience and contentedness wait
upon him, and that trust in him with an upright, and with a perfect heart.

Wherefore I say unto you all, my beloved Friends, Lambs and Babes of God, be
patient, and therein wait upon God, for the coming of the Lord draws nigh,
and the day of a great deliverance is at hand, wherein he will do, and bring to
pass such things which cannot be believed by many, though they should be told
unto them: Therefore murmur not against the Lord in any wise, because of these
things which are come to pass, and happened unto us, nor because of the
greatness of the rage of the Adversary, for it is because he has but a very
short time; and though you have born long, and suffered much in diverse kinds,
and the oppressive yoke of Antichrist is not yet removed nor taken away; yet I
say, my Friends, Fear not, nor faint not in your minds, but endure to the end
in the Faith and Patience of Jesus, and when the things determined shall be
accomplished, and the measure of iniquity shall be filled up, then shall the
day of a great deliverance come unto you, and your eyes shall see Jerusalem a
quiet habitation, the praise of the whole Earth: And then shall the Lord God
Almighty be known to reign in the Kingdoms of Men, and his Glory shall spread
forth its self to the ends of the World, and be declared of throughout all the
Nations of the Earth; and the Knowledge of God shall cover the Earth as the
waters cover the Sea. These sayings are faithful and true, and things that must
shortly come to pass and be fulfilled, the Lord has spoken it, and blessed are
all they who believe and obey the Word of the Gospel, and wait for the
fulfilling of these things.

Wherefore, my dear Friends, dwell low in God's Fear, and in his Covenant of
Light into which you are gathered; and wait to receive his pure, Divine,
Heavenly wisdom to order you, and be you ordered thereby, and that will keep
you out of all extremes, so that none will be lifted up above what is meet,
because of the Promises of God, nor yet be cast down because of the threatenings
of the Enemy, that so you may neither turn aside to the right hand, nor to the
left, but that you may walk on in the even way, which is the path of peace, and
feel the Eternal Life which is of God, to remain and abide in you; so will you
be kept fresh and lively in the beauty of Truth and Holiness, and shine as
Lights to the World: For you are the Salt with which the Earth must be
seasoned, and with which all things must be salted to make it savory unto God,
and acceptable unto him: For as the state of the World is in which they now
lie, they are unsavory unto God, and not at all a pleasant smell, neither has
he any delight in their Sacrifices, for even their prayers are abominable unto
him, and their solemn Assemblies he has no pleasure in, but his soul even
loathes and abhors them, and he will certainly work a Reformation is the Earth,
and he will beat down Babylon with a mighty blow, and will bring a great
desolation upon her, and amongst her Merchants shall the noise of a great
howling be heard, and all her delicacies shall come to naught, and all her
costly attire (the works of cunning Workmen) shall be consumed; for she is come
into remembrance before the Lord, and as she has loved blood, so must she have
blood to drink; for the Cup of God's Fury is already filled into the hands of
the Saints of the Most High, to pour out unto her: And as she has lived
deliciously, and glorified her self; so much torment and sorrow must she have
given unto her; yea, she shall have doubled unto her according to all her
works, and then shall the Saints, Prophets and holy Apostles rejoice over, when
God shall have avenged us on her.

And now, my beloved Friends, this I say unto you in and by the Spirit of the
Lord, That the time hastens and draws nigh in which these things must be
brought to pass, yet nevertheless the things decreed and determined of the Lord
must first be accomplished: So that although the power of darkness has been
long working, and does still work, as it were, in a prevalent manner, by which
sufferings and tribulations are brought upon us; yet I say, it is by the
permission of the hand of the Lord, that these things are so, and he has an
end in suffering it so to be, and that for his own glory; and who shall say him
nay for so doing, or reason with him about matters of so deep concernment,
seeing his way is hid from man, and is not known unto any, but only them unto
whom he reveals it?

But this, my Friends, I know from the Lord, That he has an intent and purpose
of good unto us thereby, and why then should not we all be content, and
willingly submit unto the hand of the Lord, whose Fatherly care is over all
his. And truly Friends, though we may say we have suffered long by the
afflicting hand of our Enemies, and their stroke has fallen hard upon many of
us, and that great sufferings and afflictions seem still to attend us; yet my
Friends (blessed be the Lord) my heart is not at all troubled at these things,
neither do thoughts of fear enter; because I see the end of the Lord in it. And
I know it is not contrary, but according to the determination of the Almighty
that these things are so: Yet I dare not but acknowledge, that they by whom
these sufferings are inflicted upon us, do go beyond their bounds and
commission, and that is the very thing with will break them, when they have
filled up their measure.

Wherefore, my beloved Brethen, be you all like-minded with me in this matter;
and settle it in your heart, to bear all things with patience and
contentedness, that may yet come upon you, for the farther trial of your Faith;
and put on Valor, and Courage, and Boldness, and be strong in the Lord, and in
the Power of his Might, and be nothing daunted before the face of your Enemies;
but let them see your courage in the Spirit of the Lamb, and in the Wisdom of
God: For the Lord is assuredly with us, and amongst us, and will be an Enemy
unto our Enemies: And what is it makes a people more dreadful and terrible,
then to have the Presence of the Lord with them? and truly Friends this I know
from the Lord, and this I have receive from God, That he will yet make his
people a terror to the Nations round about them; and they shall come bowing,
and bending, and shall desire to be at League and Covenant with all those who
are and abide in Covenant with God, because they shall know that God is with us.

Therefore all, my Friends, abide in that where you may have and enjoy the
presence of the Lord and know it to continue always with you, who will be your
everlasting Comforter, and your Stay, and Strength in all states and
conditions; and you will not be left comfortless by him, though you may be yet
further tried, and sometimes, it may be, cast down; yet you will not be
forsaken that trust in him, and repose confidence in him; for he will be always
with you, and will give you of his Counsel and Wisdom, by which you will be
directed to walk in the path of peace, and all occasions of stumbling will be
removed out of the way; and you will not at all think it strange that the Lord
suffers you so to be tried, for you will see the end and purpose of God
therein, and so in submission to his Heavenly Will in all things, you will have
satisfaction, peace, joy and content: But if the reasoning part enter, that
will soon darken the understanding, and vail the life, and the Counsel of God
will be obscure to thee, and thou will not see the end of the Lord in his thus
exercising of thee, and then sufferings will be grievous and hard to be born,
and the Murmurer will get up, that will murmur against God, and peace will fly
from thee, and the afflicting hand of God will be upon thee also, because of
thy unfaithfulness; and such a state is worse then his that never knew the way
of Truth: Wherefore consult not with flesh and blood, but in patience continue
to the end, in will-doing, and none to be weary therein, but be circumspect and
diligent every one in your minds and spirits, and watch unto prayer, that you
enter not into the temptation when it comes, for your Adversary the Devil
goes about like a roaring Lion, and waits to devour, and lurks to destroy the
precious life, and will lose no opportunity that possibly he can get to make an
entrance upon you, to deprive you of your treasure: Wherefore I say, Resist
him steadfast in the Faith, and be you armed with the whole Armor of God, that
you may be able to withstand him in all his appearances; for now he will best
in him with all his force and might, and will make many great oppositions and
assaults both within and without, if by any means to beguile you as he did Eve
in the beginning: but as you dwell in him who is the quickening Spirit, in him
the Devil has no part, neither can he prevail there; so in him your safety is
from the devourer; for he that is begotten of God into this quickening Spirit,
and therein abides, he it is that keeps himself, and that wicked one touches
him not. And so my dear Friends, I am full of unfeigned love to you all, and my
heart is indeed greatly enlarged toward you with the goodness and Love of God
which abounds in me, and not in me only, but in all the Flock of my Fathers
Fold, who are faithful and upright-hearted to him, and a table richly decked he
has spread before us in the midst of our Enemies; and what could we more desire
then the Lord has done for us, and promised to do? He has begotten us unto
himself, and nourished and brought us up unto this state in which we now stand;
and this he has done by his own right hand of power, and has formed us for
his praise, to be a peculiar people unto himself: And now this he requires of
every one, That you walk worthy of his Love, that it rise not in judgment
against any one; and that every one answer his requirings, and the leadings and
drawings of his Spirit; so shall his Love continue with you for ever, and you
shall be as a watered Garden, whose springs do not fail: So to the Lord do I
resign you up, and commit you all to the word of his Grace, who will preserve
you and keep you thereby who trust in him, and the almighty Arm of God be
amongst you, and prosper and perserve you unto his everlasting Kingdom, Amen.

And this was I moved by the Spirit of the Lord to write unto you, as a
Salutation of my endeared Love unto you, and that the things that must shortly
come to pass, might be signified unto you beforehand, and that you may be
refreshed thereby: And so in the Faith thereof I rest and remain.

Written at Kingstone upon Thames, the 22d. of the 7th month 1663. and is to
go amongst Friends, to be read in their Assemblies in the Lord's fear. Your
Brother in the Patience and Tribulation of the Lamb, Josiah Coal.

POSTSCRIPT.
ANd Friends, not in any wise to forsake the assembling of your selves
together, in as much as you know the exceeding benefit you have received
thereby; and you know full well, that it was the usual practice of the Servants
of God by whom you were begotten into the Truth, and instructed therein (of
whom some remain amongst you unto this day, and some are fallen asleep) I say,
it was their usual manner to exhort you, and to stir you up to that obedience
of assembling your selves together: And when did you meet together to wait upon
God, and your hearts kept stayed upon him, but that you received your expected
end? Wherefore let the remembrance of these things encourage you to continue in
this well-doing while you have a being and Liberty so to do: And though there
were such in ages past, whose manner was to forsake the assembling of
themselves together, and some such there are at this day also: Yet my Friends,
let not them be your example to walk by; but every one to walk as you had and
have them for examples amongst you, who begat you into the Truth, and by whom
the Way of Life has been made known unto you; and be ye Followers of them even
as they were, and are of Christ: For this, my Friends, I say unto you, There
are some sprung up amongst us who have in effect, labored to dissuade Friends
from their usual way and manner of meeting and assembling together, with whose
spirit and proceedings therein we have not unity, but must in the Spirit of
Christ Jesus the Lamb of God, give testimony against them, and forewarn you not
to receive that spirit which goes about to divert you from your usual way and
manner of assembling together, in which you have had the comfort of the
presence of the Lord, and received the Justification of Life, and thereby your
growth has been much added unto: So that certainly my Friends, that Spirit
which would turn you aside from this godly practice (of assembliug together) is
a dangerous spirit, and is not of God, whatsoever it pretend, or though it
cover it self with never so fair expressions: Wherefore, my dear Friends, have
Salt within you to savor withal, and keep your first Love, and your first
Faith, through which you received life eternal; and hold fast your first
simplicity, and your former integrity, and gad not abroad to change your ways,
but meet together in the Name and Fear of the Lord, as your wonted manner has
been; so shall you find the presence of God with you in your Assemblies, as in
the days past; and his wonted goodness and love you will feel, which will warm
your hearts, and refresh your souls; by which you will be kept living unto him,
and a good savor, and be to the praise of his Name, who is God over all
blessed for ever.

To all the Babes in Christ, AND CHILDREN of LIGHT, Who are young in the Truth,
and but of late convinced of it, A Tender Salutation and Exhortation.
MY beloved Friends, Babes, and Lambs of Christ, with whom I have traveled,
for the bringing forth of the Birth which is immortal, and which is the right
Heir of the everlasting Kingdom of God, and for the redemption and freedom of
the Seed which is incorruptible, from under the dark power, where it has been
held, and lain in bondage, and in captivity, that it might come forth into its
freedom, and Glorious Liberty, to serve the Lord, and to sacrifice in
Righteousness unto him; I say, for the Redemption and Freedom thereof, have we
labored and traveled together, whom the Lord sent forth amongst you, in his
own Name, and Power, and Authority, and therein, and therewith have we reached
unto you, and the Spirit of Life from God through us has breathed upon the
Slain in you, and entered into the Witness, and raised the Dead incorruptible;
and now the Dead being raised in you, and the Living, True, and Faithful
Witness being felt by you, wait every one, that thereby you may come to be
changed; and wholly translated, that you may become wholly a right Seed; that
as touching your former Conversation, the old Man may be put off, and you may
be wholly made conformable unto the Death and Sufferings of Christ, that so you
may live with him, and live to God through him; and that you may be redeemed
from the vain Conversation of the World, and fashioned (according to the
working of his Power) like unto the Son of God: That as you have born the Image
of the Earthly, and been made conformable unto the Fashions and Customs of this
present sinful World; so henceforth you may bear the Image of the Heavenly, and
be made conformable or subject unto the working or operation of the Heavenly
Divine Power of God, with which he has reached unto you, and visited you, that
in all things our Lord Christ may be your example, who made himself of no
Reputation, but humbled himself, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death
of the Cross, and is sat down at the Right Hand of the Majesty on High, making
intercession for them that come unto God by him; and so is become the Author
of eternal Salvation unto all them that believe and obey him, that he in all
things may have the pre-eminence. And so, my dear Friends, as I said unto you,
let him be your example to walk by, of whose Spirit you have received a
measure, to be a Guide, Rule, and Counselor unto you, and none vary from the
leadings thereof in any wise, nor by any means, for then you wander, or go into
darkness, and so lose your way of peace, and then trouble will come in upon
you, and desperation will be ready to get up in your minds; or contrariwise a
spirit of conceitedness, will carry away the mind into a motion or profession
of the Truth, out of the Life of it, and will lead thee to talk of former
experiences, when thou have lost the thing by and through which thou gainest
that experience which thou once had, and which thou now talkst of, and so
thou will grow into a form and profession of Truth, without the power and life
of it, and this is not a Sacrifice acceptable or agreeable unto the mind of
God, but contrariwise altogether disagreeable unto his mind and holy Spirit,
and his Soul hates it, and has no pleasure therein. Wherefore, my dear
Friends, dwell and watch in the Light of the Son of God, unto which, from the
darkness you have been turned, that therein every one may be kept in a true and
clear sense and discerning of his own present state, and standing, and there
the Power of God is felt, which goes over that which would drive into unbelief
or desperation, in the time of trouble. And this same Power or God will also
keep down the aspiring mind, that would be exalted above the Cross, and would
intrude into things which is not revealed of God, and would be puffed up
therewith, and glory therein, all such glorying is vain. And this is the Enemy
that would not have Christ to reign over him, neither will it be subject to the
higher Power, but will despise the Authority of God, and speak evil of
Dignities. And this must be slain; for this spirit has not the mind of Christ,
neither would walk as Christ did, nor have him for its example, but would be of
reputation in the World, and seeks the praise of men, and the honor of men,
and not the honor that comes from God only; and whatsoever pretense or show of
humility this spirit comes under, yet it seeks it self, and its own reputation,
and will admire men's persons for its advantage, and will justify the wicked
for reward (or for its advantage, or to set up and exalt it self, and will cry
peace to the wicked and ungodly, and preach judgment to the righteous. And
this is the temper of that unrighteous, exalted, self-seeking spirit, where, or
in whomsoever it gets an entrance, as has been largely made manifest, and as
by woeful experience we have seen. Wherefore beware of that spirit, and receive
it not, but deny it, for it is not of God, but shall fall and wither, and come
to naught, the Lord has spoken it. Wherefore dwell every one in true
subjection to the Cross, and see that your joy and rejoicing be in that, for
therein alone is your safety, and there you learn of Christ, and have, and
feel) the teachings of his good Spirit, and this keeps in the true humility
which goes before the true honor, and in this you are sensible of the
prosperity, or going on of the Work of God in you; and here you will know a
daily weakening of the strength and power of the wicked one, whose work is to
lead or drive out of the straight, pure, and holy way (into which God has
brought you) which leads unto life, and so diverting you from this, he then
leads or drives into exaltation, or desperation, both which leads to the
chambers of death; But as you all wait in the true simplicity, and in obedience
to the Word of Gods Power in your own hearts, you will be kept clear in your
understandings; for as said the Apostle, He that hears the Word of God, and
does it not, is like unto a man that beholds his natural face in a glass, and
straightway goes his way and forgets what manner of man he was. But be not
you forgetful Hearers, but Doers of the Word, and let it dwell plentifully in
you, so will you be kept sensible of your state and condition; but if you go
from that, then you lose your fence and underandsting that you had before of
the manner of your state and then deadness will grow, and carelessness and
negligence, and thou will become dry and barren, and unfruitful; and so my dear
hearts having large experience, and being largely sensible of the many wiles,
subtilties, and craftinesses of the wicked one, I cannot do less (for the love
sake which I bear in my heart toward you) then to lay these things before you,
and to re-mind you of them, although you have been told of them before yet as
the Apostle said, I think it meet, (yea, and it is my duty so to do) while I
remain in this Tabernacle, to re-mind you of these things; and according to the
working of the Power of God, and Word of life, to stir you up to
watchfulness, diligence and obedience, knowing that therein your preservation
and safety consists: So dwell and watch in the Light, and in the sense and
feeling of Gods eternal quickening Spirit of life, and in simplicity, and true
subjection thereunto, and there all the snares of the wicked one will be
discovered to thee, and a Way seen to escape them all, so that none will fall
therein, but be kept by the Power of God, in the even, pure, straight, and holy
way, which is narrow and leads to life eternal; and herein is no exaltation nor
desperation, nor deadness, nor dullness of spirit, but a diligent and patient
witing upon the Lord, to receive his Counsels and Instructions, in all states,
straits, and trials whatsoever, that may come upon thee for the trial of thy
Faith, which is much more precious then that of gold which perishes.

And Friends, be nothing terrified, nor yet dismayed at the prosperity, rage,
or fury of the wicked, for they have their day, and their consolation here, and
when that is over, (as David said) they shall be cut off, for their feet are
set in slippery places, and their Rock is not as our Rock, they themselves may
be Judges, but wait you upon the Lord, for the manifestation of his will, and
give up your selves to do or suffer whatsoever he calls you unto, and be you
resigned up, to be wholly disposed of according to the ordering of his Hand of
Love, or Arm of Power manifested in his Covenant of Light, and follow the Lord
Christ your Captain, whithersoever he leads you, not loving your lives unto the
death, and as valiant Soldiers endure hardships, and continue to the end,
looking over and beyond all difficulties that may appear in your way; and keep
your eye upon the mark that stands before, and then you will feel forcible
drawings in your hearts by the Spirit of the Lord to press on toward it, and
nothing will be accounted dear to part with for it, nor any thing grievous to
be born or suffered, that in the end thou may purchase it, but there will be
courage and strength sufficient given thee of the Lord to bear all things, and
endure all things, as thou resign'st up thy self unto him, and thou will have
peace with God in thine own heart and conscience, in all trials, and in all
tribulations; and in the end thou will have the full desire of thy soul, and
satisfaction to it; and so my love is dear to you all, who are Babes in Christ,
and is largely extended to the whole flock of God in all Countries, Regions and
Quarters of the Earth: But for your sakes have I chiefly written this Epistle,
who are young in the Truth, and have not so full acquaintance with the workings
of Satan, and so full a knowledge of the depths of the mystery of iniquity as
others have, who are of a more full age in the truth; and receive this as a
Salutation of my dear love to you, and a manifestation of my tender care for
you, and the Lord God Almighty give you wisdom and understanding, and
discerning, that you may choose the good, and refuse the evil, and may follow
after that above all things, which makes for your everlasting peace and
happiness, Amen.

Kingston, the 25th. of the 1st. Month, 1664. I am your dear Brother in the
Tribulation, and Kingdom, and Patience of Jesus Christ. Josiah Coal.

To the KING AND Both Houses OF PARLIAMENT. (Who have made Laws and Decrees,
and caused them to be put in Execution, to Restrain and Prohibit People from
having the Liberty of their Consciences in the Exercise of the Worship of God)
This is sent as a Warning from the LORD,
FRIENDS,
WHat do you mean by these Practices? Or what do you expect to bring to pass by
these your Undertakings and Proceedings? Do you think thereby to root out the
Holy Seed, and Royal Offspring of God, which he has raised and brought forth
in these North parts of the World to rule and reign (according to his promise
made by the Mouths of his Prophets in Ages past) to which Nations must bow, and
bend, and become Subject; I tell you plainly, and truly, that if this be your
expectations (which your proceedings gives me cause to believe it is) you will
certainly fail therein; And God will assuredly frustrate these your
expectations, and by this very way and means that you take to suppress and root
out the People of God from having a Being amongst you; even thereby you will
provoke the Lord to root out you, if you persist therein: Wherefore beware,
lest that which you think (and expect) to bring upon the People of God, be by
the hand of God brought upon your selves. For (be it known unto you) the Lord
God Almighty is with his People of a truth, whom you have turned your Sword and
Power against; and what is done unto them, he certainly takes as done unto
himself: And in as much as you go about to suppress his people, or to limit
them in the exercise of their Consciences toward God, you therein are found
Fighters against God, and thereby you go about to stop and hinder the Work of
God, which will be as hard for you to do, as it was for Saul to Kick against
the Pricks of the Witness of God in his own Conscience. Wherefore consider
these things, and remember that many Warnings and tender Visitations of Love,
the Lord has sent unto you, in times past, (which you have little regarded
hitherto, but go on exercising Cruelty toward the people of God) And now at
this time also I am moved (and it is upon my heart) by the Spirit of the Lord,
to lay these things before you, and to tell you in plainness what the Lord will
do and bring to pass; in despite of all that you can do, who seek to oppose
him; For notwithstanding the many Laws and Decrees which you have made or shall
make, yet the Work of the Lord which he has certainly begun, that shall go on
and increase, and the Truth must flourish and prosper, and spread forth it
self; and the Kingdoms of the World must become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and
of his Christ, according to his Promise; and they that will not bow unto his
Thorn and Government, who is KING of Kings, (whose right it is to rule in the
Consciences of people, and to bear the Government there, and to exercise them
in matters of worship toward God,) but will seek to stop to limit him in his
Government there, even such must, and shall be broken by him, and bruised under
by his Eternal Power; the Lord has said and spoken it, and it must come to
pass.

Wherefore, Friends, be you once more warned, That you meddle no more with the
Consciences of people, so as to go about to limit them in matters relating to
the Service of God (for its not the place of a civil Magistrate to meddle or
have to do with those things) but leave them free in those things to do as they
are persuaded in their own Consciences by the Light of the Spirit of the Lord,
for you cannot give an account unto God for them, if they do amiss, but they
must all (and so must you also give an account unto God, every one for himself;
and this is just and equal, that in (things of this nature) every one should be
left to the exercise of the Spirit of the Lord in his own heart, because that
Spiritual Worship consists in obedience to the Spirit of God, and you your
selves would not be willing to be prohibited from, or denied of this liberty;
but (I dare say) you would look upon it to be a very great Oppression unto you
to be restrained (by any civil Power or Government) from that, which by the
Spirit and Power of God you were persuaded in your Consciences you ought to do;
and you could not but judge that those (who should go about to lay or impose
such a restriction upon you) did do unto you as they themselves would not be
done by; and so you might well conclude that it were unrighteousness in them so
to do: Wherefore if you seriously consider whether this unrighteousness and
Oppression be not found in you; I know you cannot but lay your hands upon your
mouths, and confess Guilty.

So let my Counsel be (at this time) received by you, and take my Advice (as
from one that has received the Counsel of the Lord, and (in Measure) knows the
Mind of the Lord by the revelation of his Spirit as touching this matter) that
is this; Shake your selves out of these cruel practices of persecuting about
Religion and Worship and lay aside these cruel Impositions, which are and have
been laid upon the People of God; by reason whereof, many (who are dear unto
the Lord) have suffered very greatly; some the loss of their Liberties, and
some the loss of their Lives, occasioned through being thrust together in
noisome Holes and Prisons, and others are obnoxious to exilement from their
Wives, and Children, and from their Native Country, and dearest Relations; and
no evil at all justly charged against any of these, for which these cruel
Sufferings are inflicted upon them; it is only for Worshipping God in Spirit,
that these Sufferings are sustained by them; that is the greatest Charge that
has been by you at all proved against them: And for these things sake the
Lord's Controversy is certainly great with you, and while you continue in
these things, through which you have provoked the Lord to Anger: His Wrath will
not be appeased toward you, neither can your Government be established in
Safety, nor you cannot establish your selves in Safety and Security; for Fear
will surprise you (while you go on in these Practices) because of the Guilt
that is upon your Consciences; and although we cannot, neither do we desire to
make outward opposition against you, by Plottings, and Insurrections, etc. (Out
of which things God Almighty has redeemed us, and has brought us into his
Covenant of Peace, and unto his Mountain of Holiness, where nothing hurts nor
destroys) Yet we know that the Lord is with us, and is on our side, and takes
our part, and will plead our Cause, and Fight for us; and He is stronger then
you all, and his Power is above yours, and our Trust and Confidence is in him
alone, and not in the Arm of Flesh; and its in vain for you to strive against
him, or to oppose or resist him; for he will in the end be too hard for you,
and will break you to pieces, as a Potters Vessel of Clay, except you Repent.

And now, Friends, there is but one only Way, by which you may, or can possibly
escape and prevent the Dreadful Judgments of the Lord, or by which his Anger
may be appeased which is kindled against you; and that is this, To Humble your
selves before the Lord, and to Repent of the Evil of your Doings, and to loose
the Bands of Iniquity, and to undo the heavy burdens, and let the oppressed go
free, and turn the sword against the Evildoers, and suppress vice and
profaneness, and do not tolerate licenciousness, and those wicked practices
(as rioting, and drunkenness, stage plays, and the like) which day by day even
greatly abounds in your Streets, while the Servants of the Lord lie in noisome
Holes and Prisons; And give liberty of Conscience unto the People of God to
Worship him (which is the main thing that I contend with you for) that the
Servants of the Lord may have free liberty to labor for the reducing of People
from those aforementioned, and all other vices, which tends to the destruction
of youth, and to the destroying both of Soul and Body; and this is the way for
you (if there be any) to purchase the good will and favor of God; and to be
established in safety and security in your Government; and if any (who are
self-seekers and time-servers) shall (for self ends) counsel you otherwise,
such (you shall know in the day of the Lord) are evil counselors, and ought
not to be received by you, but denied.

And Friends, one thing more I would present to your consideration, which has
been often laid before you in times past, and as often forgotten by you, that is
this; What has been the ground and original cause of all the late
over-turnings, which has been in this Nation? if it be rightly weighed and
considered; will it not appear that cruelty and oppression of men's Consciences
in matters relating to the Service of God, was the main original cause thereof?
I confess I cannot but marvel you should be so blinded (with your present
prosperity) that you cannot see and consider these things, and labor to avoid
that which was the cause of their overthrow and ruin, that are gone before
you, but to run on so headlong and inconsiderate, as though you were hasting
with desire to bring the wrath of God upon you: For mark, Friends, When did any
escape the hand of God in any Age or Generation? or, Where were any established
in safety that took in hand this work of oppression, and persecuting the Seed
of God and his People? consider from Pharaoh (that great oppressor) unto this
day, and you will find that in all Ages, this work of persecuting and
oppressing the People of God, was the very cause of the overthrow and ruin of
the Persecutors; as for instance, The great persecution and cruelty that was
exercised by the then Powers of the Nation in Queen Mary's days; What was the
issue thereof? was it not the very overthrow, and rooting out of that
persecuting Power, and Religion, and Faith, etc? And do not their names (who
exercised that cruelty) remain as an ill savor unto all sober People (truly
fearing God) unto this day? And could they by all their tyranny then exercised,
root out or extinguish that Faith and Religion, that they then struck at? Nay,
they could not, though it was but (as I may say) the beginning of Reformation,
and coming out of the Apostasy; but its true indeed, they killed, destroyed,
and murdered many; but blessed be the Lord that did not shake the rest so as
to make them fall, but rather establish them. And certainly, Friends, although
you should be permitted (as they were) to destroy many of us by your Laws, and
Decrees, made or to be made, yet you cannot thereby destroy the faith of
others, neither can you possibly accomplish your desire, nor root out the holy
Seed, which is now sprung and risen, and must replenish Nations, and cause the
desolate places to be inhabited; though indeed you may thereby root out and
destroy your selves, which is sad to consider.

So Friends, much more might be said unto you, and many sound reasons and
arguments might be produced to convince you how unsafe it is for you, to
persevere in this Work of persecution and cruelty; but I know you will (many of
you, if not most of you) kick against it, and harden your hearts, and will not
believe; wherefore I have chosen rather to be as brief as may be, only to
discharge my conscience unto you in the sight of the Lord, that I may be clear
of your blood, and so shall conclude even with a few words; telling you, That
this work which you have begun, and put your hands unto, will be too hard for
you, for when did ever any yet rise up against the Lord and prosper? or do you
think to prevail against the Ancient of days, although your Predecessors could
not; Oh nay, it cannot be: But then you will say that it is not the Work of God
that you oppose, but Heresy and Sedition, etc. I answer, so said your
Predecessors the Persecutors in all Generations, when they slew the Prophets,
and Crucified the Son of God, and persecuted the Apostles; they charged them
with Blasphemy and Sedition, and Turners of the World up-side down; and said,
The Earth was not able to bear them, etc. Yet that would not be a sufficient
excuse for them, in the day when God took vengance; neither will it be a
sufficient excuse for you in the day when you must (all without respect of
persons) give an account unto God for all your deeds done in the body,
wherefore beware least that come upon you which was spoken by the Prophet of
old, saying, Behold ye Despisers and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in
your days, which you can in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.

I am a Friend to the whole Creation of God, and have the mind of the Spirit of
the Lord, who wills not the Deather Destruction of any, but rather that all
should return and live. J. C.

ENGLANDS SAD ESTATE LAMENTED; AND HER Abominations DISCOVERED: Which are the
Cause of the present Visitation of God's Judgments upon her Inhabitants. In
which also is declared, the True, Only, and Alone Way, by which the future
Judgments threatened may be escaped. Wherein also the Rulers of the Nation may
see their State, and perceive the Danger they are in.
OH England, England, the Land of my Nativity, who art full of Abominations,
and whose sin has reached Heaven, how art thou filled with pride and
oppression, persecutions and cruelty, and all kinds of Abomination abounds in
thee; How has the cry of the oppressed been heard in thy streets, and still
is, and yet those who are in power to relieve them, have turned away their
ears, and have had no regard thereunto, but have feignedly made many fair
Promises (in times past) of freedom, and liberty from those oppressive,
Antichristian yoaks and burdens that have long been laid upon the tender
Consciences of Gods people: But alas, they have had little regard to their
engagements, but have hitherto dealt deceitfully and treacherously with the
Lord and his People, and the bonds of iniquity are still standing; and instead
of breaking of them (according to the requirings of the Lord, and their own
engagements) they have made them more strong, and thereby added afflictions
unto the sufferings of Gods people; and by these things is the Lord provoked,
for he has seen it, and it displeases him: And therefore, is his controversy
great with thee, Oh England, and his hand is stretched out in Judgment against
thee O Land of my Nativity; because of which my heart is even afflicted within
me, for the sake of thy Inhabitants, and I am even pressed in spirit to declare
unto thee thy Abominations, and wherein thy Sin lies, that has thus provoked
the Lord, that if happily those (within thy Borders) who have not quite sinned
out their Day, may hear, and fear, and repent, and find Mercy at the Hand of
the Lord, that their tranquillity may be lengthened; for he is a God of tender
compassion, and wills not the death nor destruction of any; and therefore, has
his hand been long stretched forth in mercy and love unto thee, and his spirit
has long strived with thee to have gathered thee, and he sent his Prophets and
Servants unto thee, even riseing early, and sending them before the day of his
Judgments broke forth, and they proclaimed (in thy streets) Gods mighty day at
hand; and forewarned thy Inhabitants both high and low, great and small, bond
and free, male and female, Rulers and people of the dreadful Day of Gods
Judgments, which is now begun to be revealed; but they hearkened not, neither
would they receive the council of wisdom that cried in thy streets, but
despised all her reproofs; and although she has continued sending her Prophets
and wise men unto this day, yet hitherto they have not hearkened, nor regarded,
but have gone on in pride, and presumption, in persecution and cruelty, and
have nourished their hearts as in a day of slaughter, and given up themselves
to follow pleasures, and have walked in the lusts and devices of their own
hearts, and (as much as in them lies) they have fulfilled the desires of their
own minds, and lived carelessly, and wantonly upon the earth, as though there
was no God; therefore, is thy Judgments just from the Hand of the Lord, and thy
reward is the recompense of thy own doings, for thy iniquities has pulled his
Judgments upon thee, and thy sins have brought his Plagues, and thou must
confess that he is just in all his ways, and righteous in all his doings.

For consider, Oh Nation, and let me expostulate the matter with thee a little;
and then judge thy self what reward thou art worthy of: What could the Lord
have done for thee more then he has done, (or has he done so for another
Nation, as for thee) he has even filled thee with all manner of temporal
blessings and benefits that the hearts of thy Inhabitants could desire, Corn
and Oil, and Wine in abundance have been brought into thee, and all kind of
Necessaries both for food and raiment has he caused to abound in thee, that
thy Inhabitants might be fed and clothed, and that want might not be unto any
within thy Borders; and also, that thou might therein be a blessing unto
other Nations about thee: but alas, how have thou abused his Mercies, even in
these Temporal things, and converted them unto another use, then that for which
they were ordained and given unto thee! How have many of thy Inhabitants spent
much of their time to invent what to be clothed with, and after what manner to
be arrayed, in all kind of gorgeous Apparel! when others with all their care
and industry could scarce get Raiment to put on to cover their nakedness, but
have been even ready to starve for want: And how have many been inventing what
to eat, and drink, and also making waste and havoc of Gods good Creatures,
while many aged, poor and feeble have been in want of bread to eat, and in
necessity of food convenient for the preservation of the natural health; and in
this their distressed state and condition they have not had compassion on them,
nor commiserated their state; but even vaunted over them, as though they had
not been their fellow Creatures, and as though God had not appointed them to
partake of the fruits of the Creation; and in these things the Mercies of God
have been abused, and his Creatures have been converted to a wrong use, and the
Lords Love and Goodness therein has been very evilly requited by Thee, and
will it not be very just, if the Lord sends want and scarcity, and famine
instead of this great plenty, amongst those who have thus evilly requited the
Lord in abusing his Mercies? Yes verily. For consider:

Do not the sins of Sodom abound in thee, by which God was provoked to consume
it; yea, and greater sins then were charged upon Sodom, which was Pride,
Fullness of Bread, and Abundance of Idleness: But, Oh Nation! thou have not
been only found in these Sins (and yet they have abounded in thee also, as
God's faithful Witness in the Hearts of thy Inhabitants will testify) but over
and above all this, many of thy Inhabitants (even those who ought to be
Examples of Chastity to others) have given up themselves to Whoredoms, and took
delight therein, as though it were a thing not forbidden, but allowed of God;
but unto many of them it is happened (and doubtless it will unto more)
according unto that saying, Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge. Well,

But this is not all that I have to charge this Nation guilty of; for, How do
Oaths cause this Land to Mourn, even near unto Desolation? And how are the
hearts of many of the Inhabitants thereof hardened, and even seared as with a
Hot Iron; so that without any sense of the Reproofs of God's Witness in them,
they blaspheme the pure and worthy Name of the Holy Lord God, by Cursing,
Swearing, Ranting, and Sporting themselves in the day time in all kind of
Pastimes, as though they endeavored with all their Force and Might, to draw
one another, as much as in them lie out of the Fear of God? And beside all
this, What Lying and Dissembling is there amongst thy Inhabitants,
notwithstanding all their profession of (a Reformed) Christian Religion; yet
what cousening, cheating, and defrauding one another is there within thy
borders? and so treacherous have thy Inhabitants bin one toward another, and
such rotten heartedness, and double dealing have they sound one in another,
that few of them dare trust one another.

Again, O how does drunkenness also abound in thee, oh England? and how are
many Houses filled even night and day with riotous persons, spending and
wasting the Creation upon their ungodly lusts, and assembling themselves
together, even great multitudes to their invented Stage Plays, and all kind of
Vanities, and Abominations, when the people of the Lord, who fear his Name, are
not suffered to meet peaceably together to wait upon God, and to worship him,
but they must be thrust into Prisons, or beat and abused, and knocked down, and
by these things has the Lord been provoked to visit thee with these his just,
and sore Judgments.

Oh England, England, what Lamentation shall I take up for thee, for whom the
Lord has done so great things, not only in giving of thee such fullness of
temporal blessings, and benefits (for the end before expressed, which thou have
abused, as herein is signified) But over and above all this, he manifested his
Eternal Power in the midst of thee, and thereby wrought Miraculously in the
hearts of a Remnant of thy Inhabitants, to whom he made known the Mysterious
Way (which the Vulterous eye never saw) which leads to Life, and Salvation (and
whom he made choice of, to be a kind of first fruits unto himself in these
latter days) and whom he separated from the aforesaid abominations, (in which
thou art yet involved) and raised them up to be examples of Holiness, and
Righteousness, and Godliness of Conversation; and to bear Testimony (and cry)
against thy unrighteous and ungodly Ways, and also put into their hearts (by
his Spirit) to tell of his Power which he had Revealed in them, and to proclaim
his mighty Day at hand, in which he would Judge the Inhabitants of the Land in
Righteousness; and also he warned us, to warn thy Inhabitants to Repent, and we
cried aloud in thy Streets, in thy Steeple houses, and in thy Markets, as thy
Inhabitants well know; and we told them of the dreadful Day of Gods Judgments
at hand, to come upon all who (lived, and) continued in the aforesaid,
abominations; that so they might have returned to the Lord, and have come to
walk in the light of his Son, wherewith they were enlightened, that so thereby
they might have been led out of the aforesaid abominations, and Works of
Darkness, and so have escaped the Judgments threatened.

But instead of harkning to the voice of Wisdom which cried in the Streets, thy
Inhabitants rejected her counsel, and despised all her reproofs; and
despitefully used the Messengers of the Lord, whom he sent unto thee, and cast
them into Holes and Prisons, in which they have outwardly perished, whose
righteous blood yet lies at thy Doors; which God will certainly take vengeance
for.

And so far have thou been, O England, from taking Warning or Example by those
whom God thus raised up within thy Borders, and sent to Warn thee; that even
thy Rulers (with the advice and counsel of thy Chief Priests, and Prophets)
have made diverse Laws, and Decrees, by which they have endeavored to stop and
limit this Work of the Almighty, which by his mighty Power he has begun in the
hearts of his Remnant, which he has raised up to be a peculier People unto
himself within thy Borders.

And as though all thy aforesaid Abominations were too little, and that thou
might yet add thereunto; how have thy Rulers abused the Power which God
committed to them, and entrusted them withal, in tolerating all those
Licencious Practices, which daily have abounded in thy Streets; and in
suffering the Wicked, and Evildoers to go unpunished, and in turning their
Sword against the Innocent, and to Persecute the harmless People of the Lord,
for the exercise of their pure Consciences toward him in matters relating to
his Worship; and in taking upon them to Lord over the Consciences of men, the
Seat of God: have they not herein greatly abused the Power committed to them,
and intruded into the Prerogative of God? Oh great Presumption, and Usurpation
indeed, a Sin which shall not go unpunished by the Judge -- But, Oh that they
had hearkened, and taken Warning in time, that so they might have been Healed!
but now it will go hard with many of them; for God will certainly be Avenged,
for this thing; For is it not Justice in him to Dis-throne such, who would
thrust themselves into his Throne, and so Presumptiously to entrench upon his
Prerogative.

Again consider, How many and great have the Sufferings been, that have been
sustained by us (whom God raised up) (in the midst of thee, Oh England) to bear
Testimony unto his Name, and against thy Traditional Worships, and dead Forms,
and outside Professions, with the rest of thy Abominations) even by reason of
the Laws, and Decrees which thy Rulers have made against us, and sometimes
without them also? and how often have we been thrust together into noisome
Prisons, and have suffered all kind of abuses, as Socking, Stoning, Whiping,
knocking down, some Killed, in the Streets, and Steeple Houses, and in our
Peaceable Meetings, where we were gathered only to Worship God in Spirit? and
thus evilly have thou requited the Lord and his People, for his and their love,
and good will unto thee, that thou have accounted them not worthy to have a
being within thy Borders; but in thy Decrees made against them, thou have
designed their Exilement, and Extirpation, from amongst thine Inhabitants,
although according to the Law of God, and Nature, (we, and) those whom thy
Rulers have already Banished (and exposed to the hardships, and difficulties
which the Seas, and foreign Countries affords) have as just a right as
themselves, here to have continued in the Land of our Nativity, and to have
enjoyed the Liberty of their Consciences in the Service and Worship of God,
together with all other Temporal benefits, and comforts which God had afforded
unto them, as Wives, Children, and Estates, etc. And thy Rulers shall one Day
know that its as great unrighteousness in them, to Prison, Persecute, and
Banish us, (for the Exercises of our Consciences toward God) as they can
conceive it would be for others to Prison, Banish, and Persecute them for the
exercise of their Consciences, if the Lord should bring them under; wherefore
let them consider, whether or no they do by us, as themselves would be done by?
and whether they are not found Transgressors of the Law of Christ?

Well, but, all this is but as a hint of what might be mentioned of the
Abominations that is found in thee, Oh England; yet hereby thou may perceive
whether or no thy Sins does not exceed the Sins of Sodom? (whom God Destroyed
in his displeasure) and whether thy Iniquities does not surmount the Iniquities
of Gomorrah? Certainly, if Gods Witness may arise and Answer me in the
Consciences of thy Inhabitants, it will make them confess they do; and what
then can thou expect from the hand of the Lord as a just reward of all these
thy Abominations? surely thou can not miss of all the Judgments that have
been pronounced by the Spirit of the Lord through his Servants, in thy Streets,
Steeple Houses, and Markets, and to thy Rulers both by Word, and Writing; for
they must, and will unavoidably come upon thee, and then thou shall know that
the Lord spoke by his Servants, whom thou slightedst, and that the most high
Rules in the Kingdoms of men, and will execute Justice, and Judgment, and
Righteousness in the Earth, and then also thou shall know, and confess that God
gave thee time to Repent, and to put away the evil of thy doings from before
him, and forewarned thy Rulers, also oft-times of the evil to come, and that
they should set free the Oppressed, and break the heavy Yoke of Persecution
from off the Necks of God's People, that with freedom and cheerfulness, they
might serve him; but they have not hearkened thereunto, nor regarded at all;
therefore is thy Plagues come, and thy Judgment have not lingered, as is seen
at this day.

But well, much of this kind have ofttimes been presented to thy view and
consideration, so that I could even almost despair of hopes that thou will
hear, or lend an Ear unto what I say at this time, because I experimentally
know that thou art a Rebellious Nation against the Lord; yet my Bowels so
yearns toward those of thine Inhabitants, who have not quite sinned out their
Day; that I cannot but strive with them a little, in representing these things
to their consideration; that such who have any tenderness left in them, may
Repent with speed, and turn to the Lord with all their hearts, not feignedly,
but in sincerity, that so they may find a hiding place in him from the Wrath to
come and that they may understand the Cause wherefore the Lords Hand is
stretched out against thee in Judgment, Oh Nation: surely all who are prudent
in spirit, cannot but confess, and acknowledge that these things before
mentioned, is the very cause of the present Visitation that is upon thee, and
also of the future Judgments which are threatened, for these are but the
beginning of thy sorrows which it to come upon thee because thou Repented not
of thy Evil Deeds. Well.

But some it may be will say, what, and where has been the cause that all
these Abominations has thus abounded, and been continued in thee, seeing thou
have had such a large Profession of a reformed Christian Religion? to whom I
say, Search and examine, whether or no, the main ground and cause is not found
in thy Teachers, and Leaders? for have they not caused thee to Err? and have
they not strengthened the hand of the worker of Iniquity (so that none can turn
from the Evil of his Way) by promising of him life? and may not I say of thy
Teachers, Oh England, as the Prophet of the Lord said (of the false Prophets)
in his day, viz. from the Prophets of Israel is Profaneness gone forth into
all the Earth; for has not they Leaders been evil examples unto thee of
profaneness, of drunkenness, and whoredoms many of them, and universally of
covetousness, which is Idolatry? for most, or all, must needs see that their
hearts are gone after covetous practices, and by their Lies, (against the
people of God) and by their lightness, they have caused the People to err from
the right way, and have led them into rebellion against the Light of the Son of
God, wherewith they are enlightened, (which would have led them out of the dark
paths of ignorance, and works of Iniquity) under pretense that it was a
dangerous principle to be adhered unto, and that it was not sufficient to lead
out of sin; nor to save from sin, when indeed, there is none other name given
under Heaven, whereby Men can be saved from sin, but the name of Jesus, who
preached himself the Light of the World, and who lights every Man that comes
into the World, and whose free grace that brings salvation has appeared unto
all men; so that all who turn from this Grace of God which teaches us to live
soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present evil World, such turn from
the right way, and all who rebel against this Light wherewith they are
enlightened, they know not the way thereof, as Job said, and so they are
strangers to the good and right way, which is Christ, who lights every Man
that comes into the World; and is not this Light or Spirit of Grace in the
inward parts, the very thing that thy Leaders has long persuaded thee against,
that thou should not incline or adhere thereunto, under pretense as
aforesaid? and so are like unto them whom Christ said, did shut the Kingdom of
Heaven against Men, who would neither enter in themselves, and them that would
enter they hindered; and although they have in pretense made large Prayers
against sin, and iniquity, and seemed to preach against it likewise, yet they
have indeed told thee thou could not be washed, or freed from sin, while here
on Earth, and so have denied the very work of the Ministry, which was for the
perfecting of the Saints; for the Apostle labored that he might present every
Man perfect in Christ: and have they not hereby strengthened the hands of the
Workers of iniquity, even by begetting a belief in them that they cannot turn
from the evil of their ways, so as to be set free from their evil deeds, and
yet they promise them life hereafter? but be not deceived with good words, and
fair speeches; for God will not be mocked with an outside profession, for if
you live after the flesh, you shall dye; for the wages of sin is death, but the
Gift of the Spirit of God is eternal Life, through Christ our Lord, unto all
them that receive and obey it.

Again, have not thy Leaders been the great Stirrers up of thy Rulers to
persecute the harmless People of the Lord, whom he has raised up by his power
to trust in his Name, and to bear witness for him, and to testify against thy
abominations? -- have they not moved thy Rulers, and Majestrates to make Laws,
and to put them in execution, as aforesaid, against us? Consider this, Oh
Nation; what a blood-thirsty Generation of covetous Hirelings thou have
nourished within thy bowels? may I not say of them, as Hosea said of the
Priests in his days, viz. As Troops of Robers wait for a Man, so the Company
of Priests murder in the way by consent? for have they not been even unanimous
in this work of Persecution? how many have they murdered (in the way (of Cain,)
which they are in) by consent; in casting of them into Prisons for their filthy
lukers sake? and how have they provoked, and stirred up thy Rulers and people
to the same work, and even made them their vassals to fulfill their envious
wills?

So that all these things being considered (with many more, which might be
mentioned) have we not just cause to attribute the main ground of thy
continuing in these so gross abominations, unto these covetous Hirelings, and
filthy Dreamers that defile the flesh? I confess, I cannot but believe, that
there are multitudes of thousands within thy Borders, Oh England, that see
their folly and madness, and their unstableness; and how they toss up and down,
and are driven about with every tempest that arises, even as Clouds without
rain, as their Predecessors were, whom the Apostle spoke of; and saw come in
his day, who went in Cain's way of Persecution and Murder, and were wandering
Stars, for whom was reserved the blackness of Darkness for ever.

For have not the unstabillity of these men, their wandering and tossings to
and fro (with every Wind or Tempest that has arised in this Nation) been
evidently enough seen, in this our Generation; yea surely, all who are not
wilfully blind cannot but perceive how not long since they preached up the
Common Prayer Book, seemingly with a great zeal, as though Salvation was not to
be attained without Conformity thereunto; but no sooner did the windy tempest
arise which blew that away, and the then Powers of the Nation by whom it was
upheld (and which these men swore for, and prayed for, etc) came to be subdued,
and the Church Faith, and Directory come to be set up in its stead, but
presently they were turned, or driven about with the tempest, and wandered from
the Comnon-Prayer-Book, and swore against the King and House of Lords, by whom
it was upheld, and whom before they prayed and swore for, and began to swear
for the Commonwealth, and to preach up the Church Faith, and Directory, with
as much seeming zeal as before they had done the other. And now again, since
the tempest has risen, and the wind has blown another way, and their Church
Faith (of which Christ was not the Author) and Directory has fallen thereby, and
the Common Prayer Book again set up in its old place, they are persently
wandered back again to that, and driven about thither, preaching of it up, and
praying, and swearing for King, and house of Lords, whom they formerly
preached, and prayed, and swore against, and these things they do with as
impudent faces (many of them) as though they had never varied from it. Oh
hypocritical, treacherous, deceitful hearted Generation, who shall believe them
to be Messengers, or Ministers of God, that have no more stability with them;
truly their very actions in turning, and tossing, and wandering to and fro,
has sufficiently declared them to be without any true foundation; and who
shall conside in them for the time to come that are so variable? have we not
ground to believe that they will turn to the old Mass, or to the Turk's
Alcharon, or any thing that the Powers of the Nation shall countenance? surely,
they who believe better then so of them, will be deceived by many, or most of
them, as many have been already in times past; for although they feignedly
appear as such who should take care and watch for the Soul, yet we
experimentally see, that they seek for their own gain, and indeed they serve
not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own bellies, for their fruits declare, that
they will Murder (as they have done) many for their Bellies: And although they
flatter with the King, and thy Rulers, Oh England, as though they sought and
studied their Welfare and Safety, and would counsel them for their
Establishment and Security; yet they are a treacherous Generation, and it is
not safe for the King to trust then; for they have an End unto themselves in
most, or all that they do, and their own Interest is concerned in most of their
Enterprises; for they are Lovers of their own selves, and of Pleasures more
then of God (as the King and his Council may easily see, if they consider it,
and take an inspection into it: And let me tell the King and his Council this
by the way, together with the rest of thy Rulers (Oh England) That if they,
hearken to the Counsel of these Self-seeking and Time serving-men, who are
Wandering Stars, and Clouds driven with Tempests, as before is declared; I say,
if they follow these Blind Guides, and hearken to their Counsel, so as to be
swayed by them, and become their Vassels, to fulfill their Blood-thirsty
Desires, in Prosecuting, Banishing, and making Havoc of the People of God;
then, in the end they will certainly fall into the Ditch of Everlasting
Destruction and Perpetual Shame and Contempt, out of which there is no
recovery, and then shall they know, that God has spoken by me, and that a
Prophet of the Lord has been amongst them.

Wherefore Oh Nation, and you Inhabitants thereof, let my Counsel be acceptable
unto you at this time, that if possible so many of you, who have not quite
sinned out your Day (and have yet any Tenderness of Heart left in you toward
God) may come to find a Hiding Place from the Wrath to come: For, if the
aforesaid crying Sins and Abominations (which your Teachers are a great Cause
of, as afore-shew'd) are continued in, then utter Destruction and Desolation,
must, and will unavoidably come upon you. Wherefore hearken not to them who
tell you that you cannot be made free from Sin, while you remain in this Body;
but hearken to the Voice of God, who is Light, and who searches your Hearts,
and declares the Secrets thereof unto you, by his Faithful and True Witness,
which he has placed in your Consciences, and which calls out of Sin and
Transgression; for, if you are in the Light, and walk in the Light, wherewith
you are enlightened, the Blood of Jesus, Christ, will cleanse you from all Sin,
and Wash you from all Iniquity, as the Apostle testified. Neither lend an Ear
to them, who stir you up to Persecute the Innocent for the exercise of their
Consciences toward God in his Worship; for they cause you to Err, and to
Transgress the Royal Law of God (which says, Whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, even so do ye unto them) and thereby you will purchase the
displeasure of the Lord against your selves, as many have already done, which
will not easily be appeased: Wherefore save your selves from this untoward
Generation of false Prophets, who cause you to Err, and who make a prey upon
you; and Come out from amongst them, and be separate from them, and Touch not
the unclean thing, or any thing whatsoever that will defile the Conscience; but
break off your Sins, and all kind of Iniquities by speedy Repentance, and by
true submission to Gods faithful Witness, his Spirit of Grace in your inward
parts, which will Teach you (as it did the Saints of Old, and as it does us)
that denying Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, you should live Soberly,
Righteously, and Godly in this present World; for there is not another way to
escape the Righteous and Dreadful Judgments of the Lord, which are already
begun to be Revealed upon thy Inhabitants, Oh England, but only by turning to
the Lord with their whole hearts, and by truly humbling themselves before him,
and by learning obedience to the Gift of his Spirit, which has long strived
with them: for it is not an outside Profession, that will serve turn; the Lord
has been long grieved therewith already, and many have soared aloft, above the
Measure of the Gift of the Spirit of God, into an airy Profession of high
things, but have not had the Life of what they have Professed, only have made
their Profession a Cloak for their Wickedness, many of them; and thereby the
Spirit of the Lord is and has been grieved; and he is now arisen to lay open
their Madness, that their Shame may appear, of which he sent them a Sign
beforehand; and now all false Foundations shall be discovered, and all false
coverings shall be ripped of, and all outside Professions shall wither; for God
is Risen to Fan the Nations, and to Winnow them, and he will separate betwixt
the Wheat, and the Chaff, and he will gather the Wheat into his Gardner, and
the Chaff shall be burnt with unquenchable fire; and woe be unto them that are
covered, and not with the covering of the Spirit of the Lord.

Therefore let every one humble themselves under the hand of God which is now
stretched out in Judgment, and mind the simplicity that was in Christ Jesus,
who made himself of no reputation, but humbled himself; and then will the lofty
aspiring mind be kept down, which otherwise will be aspiring after (and
intrudeing into) things above its reach, and will neglect to be obedient to
those small things which are made known, and this has been and still is the
state of the greatest part of people professing Christianity: But as I said
before, that will not serve their turn, nor give people acceptance with the
Lord; for then had God been highly pleased with this Generation, but contrary
wise it has provoked him to wrath, and to visit them with his judgment, that
thereby they may be humbled, whereby they may perceive that humiliation in
life, and godliness of Conversation, and a righteous upright walking with the
Lord, is of greater acceptance with the Lord then all outside shows and empty
professions whatsoever.

Therefore at last, amendment of life is the matter, and a close walking with
the Lord in his Covenant of Light, according to the appearance thereof, is the
thing that must bring people into favor and peace, and acceptance with the
Lord; for this I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, neither will he
regard them because of their profession, nor yet because of their greatness,
(for of him are all things) but in every Nation, he that fears God, and
works Righteousness is accepted of him.

Neither is it your many Prayers that he has regard unto, while rebellion
against his Spirit, with envy and murder against his people lodges in your
hearts; and those acts of violence toward them are in your hand; for says he,
When you make many Prayers I will not hear, for your hands are full of Blood:
No more will your fastings at all remove the present Visitation, of his
Judgments from amongst you; nor cause Health to spring unto you, while you Fast
as you do at this day, that is (as your Fruits declare) for Strife, and Debate,
and to Smite (the People of God) with the Fist of Wickedness, which is the Fast
that was forbidden of God, Isai. 58, 4. in which you do (according to your
confession) the things that you ought not to do, and you likewise leave undone
(as you say) the things that you ought to do, that is to keep the Fast which
the Lord has chosen; which is, to loose the Bonds of Wickedness, and to undo
the heavy Burdens, (that is laid upon Gods People, and upon the Seed of God in
your selves) and to let the Oppressed go free from those Sufferings, that you
inflict upon them, and that you break every Unrighteous Yoke; for this is the
Fast that you ought to keep, and these are things that you ought to do, (in
order to the staying of the present hand of Judgment, which is stretched forth)
which indeed you leave undone; and therefore (as you say) you have no health in
you; but if you would keep the Commands of God, that is not to Fast as you do
this day, which is to Smite with the Fist of Wickedness; but if you would study
to be quiet, and as much as in you lies to have Peace with all Men, and would
keep the Fast which the Lord has chosen, that is to loose the Bonds of
Wickedness, and to undo the heavy Burdens, and set the Oppressed free, and
would deal thy Bread to the hungry, and bring the Poor that are cast out into
thy House; and when thou see the Naked, that thou cloth them; and that thou
hide not thy self from thine own flesh: then would the Promise of God (which he
is not slack concerning) be soon fulfilled unto thee, Oh Nation; for then
should thy light break forth as the Morning, and thine health should spring
forth speedily; thy Righteousness should go before thee, and the Glory of the
Lord should be thy Rereward; then thou should call, and the Lord would
answer; thou should cry, and he would say, here am I; for he is faithful
that Promised, and these are his faithful, and true Promises, which is not
fulfilled unto thee, Oh Nation; because thou do those things, (as aforesaid)
which thou ought not to do, and leaves undone those things which thou ought to
do; and this is the cause that thine health does not spring forth, and that
thine Inhabitants, have no health in them.

Oh, England, England, How incurable is thy Wound? must many of thy mighty Men
perish or fall (before thy breach can be made up) through harkening to the
voice of an Adulteress, whose feet abides not in her house, Prove. 7.11. and
through taking counsel of a whorish Woman, who has corrupted the Earth with
the abundance of her Fornications, and Enchanted, and Bewitched the Inhabitants
thereof with her Sorceries, and by whom many mighty Men have already fallen, as
Solomon said, Prove. 7.26? Well, but must she be the cause of the fall of many
in this our day also? Oh, my heart is even broken within, and I am even very
sorely afflicted, because of the consideration of these things. What, will not
thy great Men, and Rulers hearken to the Counsel of the Lord? that they may be
healed, but hearken to the voice of a Harlot, whose ways are so moveable, that
they cannot be known, Prove. 5.6. and who causes all to Perish, that she
compasses within her Habitation, Prove. 2.19? Well, I could wish, that if it
were the Will of the Lord; it might not happen unto them, as it did unto Ahab
of Old, who had provoked the Lord, (and by the false Accusation of the sons of
Belial, caused the Blood of Innocent Naboth to be shed) until his Decree was
sealed against him, which caused him to say; Who shall persuade Ahab, that he
may go up, and fall at Ramoth Gilead, 1 Kings 22.20. and there came forth a
spirit, and stood before the Lord; and said, I will persuade him, and the Lord
said unto him, Wherewith? and he said, I will go forth, and be a Lying spirit
in the mouths of all his Prophets; and the Lord said, Thou shall persuade him,
and prevail also; go forth, and do so: So the lying spirit, went in the mouths
of his Prophets, and persuaded him by them, to go on in the thing that he
desired; But Micaiah, the true Prophet of the Lord, told the King in
faithfulness, what would be the issue of that Interprize, that he was putting
himself upon; nevertheless, the King would not hearken unto Micaiah, but
commanded that he should be put in Prison, and fed with the Bread of
affliction, and with the Water of affliction, etc. and hearkened unto the lying
spirit, that was in the mouths of his many Prophets, who prophesied smooth
things unto him, and by them this lying spirit prevailed, and caused him to
fall before the Host of the King of Assyria.

Well, I say, I could heartily wish that it may not be so with thy Rulers and
Magistrates, (Oh Nation, as it was with Ahab) and that they have not so far
provoked the Lord (by Persecuting, and sheding the Blood of the Innocent) as to
cause him to seal his Decree, against them, or any of them, as he did against
Ahab; and I could wish that it might not prove so (which I have cause to
believe it will) that he has given permission to the lying spirit, to go in
the mouths of thy Priests, and Prophets, to persuade thy Rulers, to go on in
this Antichristian Work of Persecuting the Innocent, and harmless People of the
Lord, thereby to fill up the measure of their Fathers Iniquities; that so he
may be avenged on them. But, Oh that thy Rulers had hearkened unto the Counsel
of those whom God sent unto them; who came not for filthy Lucre, nor with
flattering Speeches, but in the Name of the Lord, declaring his Counsel in
plainness, and faithfulness for thy good; but Alas, instead of hearing their
Counsel, they have done unto them as Ahab did unto Micaiah, even put them in
Prison, and fed them with the Bread, and Water of affliction; and thereby they
have provoked the Lord of Hosts: So that without all controversy (as I said
before) if thy Rulers persist, and go on following the Counsel of those false
Prophets, into whose mouths the lying spirit is entered, to persuade them that
the way to remove, or stop the present Visitation of Gods Judgments (which is
Revealed in the midst of thee) is to be severe in Persecuting, and Banishing
his despised and harmless People out of thy Borders: I say, if their counsel be
hearkened unto, and obeyed therein, that lying spirit will certainly thereby
prevail, and will cause them to fall, and none shall help them; and they shall
be broken with a perpetual breath, and none shall bind them up.

Wherefore hearken unto this ye Heads, and Rulers of the Nation of England, the
Land of my Nativity; be not Proud, nor stout hearted against the Lord; but fear
and dread the Almighty God of Heaven and Earth; for he has certainly a
Controversy with you, and he will not at all regard the lofty looks, nor your
proud Carriage, for he will be reverenced; wherefore humble your selves in Dust
and Ashes in his presence (you who have not quite sinned out your Day) and put
on Sackcloth before him, if so be there may be hope, lest he break you in
pieces as a Potters Vessel of Clay, and there be none to save you.

And thus, Oh England, I have briefly and faithfully declared unto thee thy
state and condition, according as God showed it unto me, and the cause of thy
present Calamities, and of the future Judgments that threatens themselves; and
also the way in which they may in a great measure be prevented, and the hot
displeasure and indignation of the Lord be appeased, in which thy Rulers may
likewise see the state and danger they are in: But yet I know many will not
hear nor regard at all until their desolation come upon (...); yet
nevertheless, I shall be clear in that I have discharged my Conscience unto
them from time to time, according as God required me; (...) if they perish in
their gain sayings, and (...)-neckedness, their blood will be upon themselves,
and upon them who caused them to err.

Postscript.
WHen the good will and loving kindness of God (who wills not the death nor
destruction of any) has been largely manifested unto a rebellious and
stiff-necked Generation of people, in striving with them by his good Spirit;
and when he has often reached unto them with the visitation of his Love, and
called unto them (by the mouths of his Servants, Prophets, and Messengers) to
repent, and turn every one from his evil way, that they might be healed, and
find mercy with the Lord, and yet they will have no regard thereunto; but
refuse to be reformed, and continue still in their rebellion against the Light
of his good Spirit in their hearts; and despise, hate, persecute, and
despitefully use the Servants and Messengers of God, whom in tender mercy, love
and good will, he sent unto them; I say after the long suffering and loving
kindness of God has been so largely (and on this wise) manifested unto a
rebellious and stiff-necked people; who so evilly requite his love to them; is
it not then justice in the Lord to cease striving with them, and to give them
up to hardness of heart, and to seal his Decree against them, (in his wisdom)
to find out a way that their eyes may be closed, and their hearts hardened,
least they should see, and understand, and be converted, and healed; that so it
may come upon them according to that Prophetical saying of Solomon, viz. He
that oft-times is reproved, and stiffneth his neck, shall suddenly be cut off,
and that without remedy.

Wherefore now consider, Oh Nation of England, is not this the very state of
many of thy Inhabitants at this day? has not the love and good will of God
been largely manifested to them, in that he has long strove with them by his
good Spirit in their hearts? and has not his immortal Word of Life been
plentifully declared amongst them, even to the uttermost of thy borders every
way? has it not been line upon line, and precept upon precept unto them, even
by the mouths of his faithful Servants and Prophets whose cry in thy Streets
has often, and long been, Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways; why will die,
etc? And did they not declare that Gods dreadful Judgments were nigh to be
revealed upon them that would not repent, and turn from the Abominations
against which they testified: But alas! few at all had regard thereunto; but
many looked upon it as an idle Tale, or as a whimsical Imagination, and refused
to hear and fear, (even as Jerusalem did in the day when Christ would have
gathered her) and therefore now (in the Justice of God) is his Decree gone
forth, and sealed against many of them (as it was against Jerusalem) and his
righteous Judgments (which was threatened and prophesied of by his Servants and
Handmaids) is begun to be revealed amongst them, and in the midst thereof he
has (in his wisdom) found out a way to blind their Eyes, and to stop their
Ears, and to harden their Hearts, least they should see and hear, and
understand, and be converted and healed; for as Job said, He takes away the
perfect, and the wicked; and because it is so, that (in this present
Visitation) he takes away the Righteous from the Earth as well as the wicked;
therefore the wicked cannot discern betwixt him that serves God, and him that
serves him not, (according to that saying of Daniel, viz. None of the wicked
shall understand, but the wise shall understand, etc.) But they are ready to
conclude, and many do conclude that the Righteous are not Righteous, and that
the Just and Innocent are not Just and Innocent: But because they have slighted
the Day of Gods love unto them, (in which his Hand was stretched forth to
gather them) he has so brought it to pass, and takes away the Just as well as
the Unjust, that thereby their Eyes may be blinded, that they may not see a
difference, and that their years may be stopped left they should hear his Word,
and that their hearts may be hardened (as Pharaoh's was) lest they should
understand the way of Life, (in which the just walks) and be converted
thereunto and healed; and yet in all these thing iniquity cannot he charged
upon the Lord, (because he willed not their destruction, but did strive with
them long, and gave them space to repent, but they repented not,) therefore
their destruction is of themselves; for when he would have gathered them they
would not: therefore (I say) its of themselves that they are left so
desolation; yet there is a remnant in the midst of thee, (Oh England) whose day
is not yet over, and them he will spare, and will gather them to himself, and
they shall see the path of Life, and hear the voice of the Bridegroom of their
souls, and understand the things that belongs to their everlasting peace and
shall be glad, and rejoice in his great Salvation.

The Whore Unvailed, Or the Mystery of the Deceit of the CHURCH of ROME
REVEALED.

BEING A brief Answer to a Book, Entitled, The Reconciler of Religions; or, A
Decider of all Controversies in Matters of Faith; Written by a professed Roman
Catholic, who subscribes his name A. S. in which he endeavored to prove the
Church of Rome to be the True Church; But what his Arguments therein produced
are worth for his purpose, may here be seen in this following Treatise.

Also his Reflections upon the Principles of the People, called Quakers,
Answered.

With a brief Discovery of the true Church, in which the Doctrine of Perfection
is Vindicated by sound (Scripture) Arguments.

Whereunto is added the 14th Chapter of A. S. his Book, in which he declares
the Protestant, or Sectarian Ministers, not to be true Preachers, nor sent of
God, which I thought meet to publish herewith, that the Sectarians, or
Episcoparians may Answer for themselves.

O thou that dwell upon many Waters, abundant in Treasures, thine End is
come, and the Measure of thy Covetousness, Jer. 51.13.

For out of the North there comes up a Nation against her, which shall make
her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein chap. 50.3.

And a mighty Angel took up a great stone, like a millstone, and cast it into

down, and shall be found no more at all, Rev. 18.21.

To the Reader.
Reader;
ALthough the Author of the pretended Reconciler of Religions, did, in the
conclusion thereof, seem to Challenge an Answer to all Particulars therein laid
down, according to the Chapters and Numbers thereof; yet I did not look upon
his Challenge to be any Obligation to me, to proceed according to his
Directions; neither indeed was it needful or necessary, that I should answer
his desire therein; for it would have required more time then I was willing to
spare for that work, and more labor, then I was willing to bestow about it;
because there is an easier way, which I have taken to do the Work, as
effectual, as though I had gone through with every particular there inserted:
For when the Foundation of a Building is Raced, the whole Building will fall as
effectually, as though a man should begin at the top, and pull down all, one
Stone after another; and with a great deal less labor it is done. So for my
commodity I have observed that Rule in answering the aforesaid Book, by Racing
the Foundation of the Contents thereof, or answering the chief Heads, by which
he therein endeavored to prove the Church of Rome to be the True Church; upon
which all the rest of his Book has its dependancy: and those Heads, or
Particulars being confuted, the rest must of (themselves needs fall, or of)
necessity be of no validity, and so not worth spending Ink and Paper about;
upon consideration of which, I doubt not but the Reader will find as good
satisfaction in what I have hear written concerning the Church of Rome, as
though I had answered all his particulars particularly. And so to the Grace of
God do I commend thee.

The Whore Unvailed, etc.
GReat is the controversy at this day throughout Christendom concerning the
way of Worship and Salvation, and great is the confusion that is about Faith,
and Religion, etc. even amongst all professing Christianity; and many, and
cruel are the murders, that have been acted by them, one against another,
about Faith, and Worship, since the Apostasy began; and since people forsook
the right way, and went in Cains way, and in Balaams, Jude ver. 11. For then
persecution began amongst the professed Christians, and not before; and when the
right way was forsaken, then people went into Envy, and then they withstood the
truth; even as Jannes, and Jambres withstood Moses; and then they began to be
scattered (from the holy Mountain of the Lord, where nothings hurts, nor
destroys) to the barren mountains, where they have been destroying one another;
and there (in the dark and cloudy day of Antichrist's reign) they have been
worshipping the many headed Beast; (that then arose) and also the Dragon, that
gave power to the Beast to make War with the Saints; and they who have been
worshipping upon one mountain, they have cried salvation is here: And they who
have been worshipping another head, or upon another hill, they have cried that
salvation was to be found there: (For the seven Heads of the Beast are seven
Mountains upon which the Whore sits, that drinks the Blood of the Saints.) And
so they fell out one with another about the way of Salvation, and upon these
barren Mountains (unto which people are in looking for Salvation) the strife
and the envy has been: And there people has been killing one another about
the way, and themselves all out of the way, in an Antichristian, destroying,
persecuting spirit, as their fruits declare; for the Spirit of Christ never led
the true Christians to persecute any about Religion; neither does any who are
in the right way, kill and destroy men's lives about Religion; Nay, they that do
so, are not true Christians, but of an Antichristian spirit; for I testify in
the Name of the Lord, and for God, that the Spirit of Christ does not (nor
never did) admit, or allow of persecution, or of destroying men's lives about
Worship, and Faith toward God; neither are any of them true Christians
(whatsoever they profess) that are found so doing.

For it is not a bare profession of Christ, and of zeal for his cause, and
crying up Ordinances, etc. that makes people true Christians, or that gives
them acceptance with God, or will make them well-pleasing unto God; But, that
which makes a man a true Christian, is (his obedience unto) that Spirit, which
baptizeth into the true Faith, by which Righteousness is wrought, Heb. 11.33.
and into Christ, who is the Author of faith, and will bring him to have the
mind of Christ (as the true Christians had) and will make him partaker of his
divine nature, and will teach him to live soberly, righteously, and godly in
this present World, and to do to all men, as he would they should do unto him,
which is according to the Law and Prophets, that Christ came to fulfill: And
indeed, there is nothing that can bring a man into this true Christian state,
but only the working and operation of the Spirit of Christ in his inward parts,
which all ought to obey and submit unto: For, the persecuting Jews, who were
uncircumcised in heart and ears, and did always resist the holy Ghost; they
professed as great Zeal for God, and his Cause, as the Apostate Christians now
do; and they looked for the coming of the Messiah, of whom all the Prophets
prophesied, and professed they would Adore him, and Reverence him, etc. and
said, That, if they had been in the days of their Fathers, they would not have
slain the Prophets, Mat. 23.31. who prophesied of the coming of Christ; and so
they had seemingly a great Zeal for God, and his Truth: But, alas! a Murdering
spirit was found in them; for, notwithstanding they professed, That they would
not have killed the Prophets; yet they killed the Son, who was the end of the
Prophets: And although the Prophets signified the Time when, Dan. 9.24. and the
Place, where the Messiah should be born, Mic. 5.2. yet when he was come,
according to the Prophets, which they professed; these Professing Jews would not
own him, nor receive him, John 1.11. because he reproved their Hypocrisy, and
their Murdering spirit, John 8.40. but they Crucified and Slew Him.

And this is the very State of the Apostate Christians this day: For who is
there now amongst them, but will profess as great Love to Christ, as the Jews
in Christ's days did to the Prophets, who prophesied of him? and who is there
now among'st them, but will say; Had we been in Pilate's days, (...) would not
have crucified Christ, nor delivered him up to be crucified (as the Jews said
of the Prophets) yet, notwithstanding their so saying, they do as the Jews did:
for, now in this day of his spiritual appearance (which they profess they look
for, and expect) they are found persecuting of him in his Members, under the
sam^e pretense, that the Jews persecuted him in their day, (viz.) as a
Blasphemer, etc. And so the Persecutors were in all ages blinded by the godd of
the World, who was a murderer from the beginning; and though they could see
the iniquities of their fathers and predecessors, in persecuting and killing
the Prophets, yet the envy of their hearts was such, that they could not see
their own iniquities, in persecuting and slaying the Son, who was greater than
the Servants, whom their fathers slew: so, as I said before, it is not a
profession of Christ, and his Ordinances, or zeal for his cause, that makes
people true Christians; neither is God Worshipped upon any of those mountains
where the persecuting and destroying one another is; but the Worship of God
consists in obedience to that Spirit of Truth, which condemns all those works
of darkness and cruelty, and in his own Mountain of Holiness, where nothing
hurts nor destroys, Isa. 11.9. And such is the Father now seeking to worship
him, that will worship him there; and is now gathering his Sheep from off the
barren Mountains, upon which the Whore sits, (where they have been scattered in
the dark and cloudy day of Anchrist's reign, and where the Wars and Fightings
are) even to his own Holy Mountain, where they shall learn war no more, Isa.
2.4. And this is the work that the Envious, and Murtherous one opposes, and
bestirs himself with all his force and might, in his Instruments of Cruelty,
and Men of War, arming of them with all kind (...) weapons that possibly he can
form, to fight against this Appearance and Work of God; for so it has been,
that since we (who are reproachfully called Quakers) were raised up to be a
people, to bear Testimony for the Name of the Lord, and of the working of his
Spirit and Power, we have always been even as a Butt, for all the Archers of
Babylon (even from every Mountain) to shoot at: and our sufferings have not
been only in our persons, and estates, as the spoiling of our goods, and
scourgings, and cruel mockings, and imprisonments (many unto death, as this
Nation to her anguish must be made to know) but even all sorts of Babylons
Merchants, (or they that trades in every part of her, or within her Subburbs)
have often made it their business, to write and print against us, endeavoring
thereby as much as in them lay, to render us odious, (to our own Nation, and to
Nations about us) under pretense that we were Papists, and Jesuits, and that we
propagated Jesuitical Principles, etc. but they being almost, if not
altogether, weary of that work, finding it to be to no purpose, (for the truth
which we profess has still got ground, and flourishes through all these
things) now at last, the Papists, or Jesuits themselves, (who, I perceive have
a secret hope of a day once more in this Nation,) they begin to put out their
heads, and to print against us; and so both Protestants and Papists, even every
head and horn of the Beast, after whom the whole World wonders, are found
pushing against the Lamb and the Saints, Rev. 17.14. For of late a certain
Pamphlet accidentally came to my hands, written by a perfect Roman Catholic,
who subscribed his name A. S. in which he seems to show himself sensible of the
great distractions that are throughout the whole Christendom, about the true
way of worship, and concerning the true Church; and first states a Question,
viz. which is this Church? etc. and afterward makes it his business to prove
the Church of Rome to be this true Church, and that by diverse Arguments by him
stated in a Syllogistical manner: And I also finding the Author of the
aforesaid Pamphlet therein smiting at the People of God called Quakers, and
endeavoring to render them odious, by affirming they are led by a deluding
spirit, etc. I found my self somewhat concerned to return a brief reply to his
chief Arguments therein produced, by which he has in vain) endeavored to
accomplish the aforesaid work by him undertaken.

A. S. His first Argument, produced to prove the Church of Rome to be the true
Church, consists of nine particulars, as follows; viz. That is the true
Church, and no other, which is one, Holy Catholic, and Apostolic Church,
Which is visible, infallible, inerrable, in which is power of miracles, out of
which none can be saved; But the Roman Pontificial, that is to say, the
Faithful People, dispersed all the World over, in communion with the high
Priest, Bishop, or Pope of Rome is such, and no other; Therefore the Roman
Pontificial alone is the true Church.

Reply. To which I reply, that the true Church; of which Christ alone is Head,
and Supreme Governor, is in it self one, holy, Apostolic Church, etc. I shall
not go about to deny: But as touching that grand Question by A. S. stated
before his Argument here inserted (viz.) which is this Church, etc. I answer,
this is a thing indeed disputable amongst many, yea, amongst many thousands,
yet not at all questionable, nor yet doubtful unto me; for I am well satisfied
therein, and in all other things that appertain to the way of Life and
Salvation, but that the Church of Rome is the true Church, (as A. S. affirms,
and by his many Arguments has endeavored to prove) I do not acknowledge, but
deny, and doubt not but I shall, in this short ensuing Treatise, prove the
contrary, to the Satisfaction of every judicious Reader.

First, Although the true Church, of which Christ is in visible Head, is one
yet the oneness of the Church of Rome is not a sufficient Argument to prove her
to be the true Church; for wherein does her oneness consist, farther then in
Idolatry, Superstition, Murder, and such like abominations, of which much
might be mentioned (which was never practiced by the true Church in the
Apostles days) but in these things the Church of Rome is one: Witness her
Worshipping Idols, or Images, bowing to that she calls her Altars, and the rest
of her Supestitious Ceremonies; witness the Killing, Burning, or Drinking the
Blood of so many Thousands, as she has done for many hundred years past, as
the whole Christendom full well knows; therefore the Church of Rome is not the
true Church.

Secondly, And consider, was not the company of Priests one in Hosea's days,
who murdered in the way by consent? whom the Prophet compared, to troops of
Robbers, Hos. 6.9. And is not the Church of Rome one as they were? for has not
she murdered many (by consent of most of her members) in the way that she is
in? consider these things.

But then A. S. says, That she is one in matters of Faith, and governed by one
invisible Head, Christ; and by one visible Head, the Pope, the true Successor
of Peter, etc. and therefore she is the true Church.

Answ. 1. I answer; that she is perfectly united in matters of Faith, I utterly
deny: witness the History of the Counsel of Trent, which copiously relates the
Divisions and Contradictions amongst them there about matters of Faith. But
admit that it were so, that she were one in matters of Faith, that does not
prove her to be the true Church, unless she could prove her Faith to be the
true Faith, by which righteousness is wrought, Heb. 11.13. And which is made
perfect by works of righteousness, James 2.22. But the Faith of the Church of
Rome is not the true Faith, (as her works of unrighteousness before mentioned
clearly make manifest) therefore the Church of Rome is not the true Church.

Secondly, That the Church of Rome is governed by one invisible Head, Christ;
that I also deny, and her fruits before mentioned, and that which I shall
hereafter mention, sufficiently declares the contrary; and as Christ said to
the Jews, If you were of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham, but now
you go about to kill me; thus did not Abraham. So say I of the Church of Rome,
If she were governed by the one invisible Head, Christ, as the true Church was,
then she would have the mind of Christ, (who came not to destroy men's lives,
but to save them) as the true Church had, 1 Corinthians. 2.16. but she has not the
mind of Christ: Witness her destroying the lives of many, not only of those
that believe not, but of those that believe: Therefore she is not governed by
the invisible Head, Christ, and consequently is not the true Church, but the
Whore that drinks the blood of the Saints.

Thirdly, But that the Church of Rome is governed by her visible Head, the
Pope, I shall not go about to contradict; for although that proves her to be
one, in subjection to the Pope, yet it does not prove her to be the true
Church; because Christ never ordained a visible Head to his Church; but that
the Pope is the true Successor of Peter (as A. S. affirms) that I do deny; and
it remains for him to prove it, or for some of his Servant, to do it for him;
for after Peter was converted, he never gave consent to the murdering of any,
as the Pope has done many; Therefore he is not the true Successor of Peter.

2. That the true Chu ch is holy; or (as A. S. says the spotless Body of
Christ, that I do acknowledge; but the Church of Rome (of which the Pope is
visible head) is not holy, nor the spotless Body of Christ.

1. For the spotless Body of Christ (the true Church) was baptized with the
holy Ghost and with fire, the Spirit of Judgment and of burning, and thereby
her filth and her spots were purged away from her, and she was washed from
Idolatry and covetousness, etc. as the Apostles testified, 1 Cor. 6.11. and
thereby she was fitted for Gods Kingdom, and was made to sit together in
heavenly places in Christ Jesus, and had the mind of Christ, 1 Cor. 2.16. who
came not to destroy men's lives, etc. Luke 9.56. But the Church of Rome is not
washed from Idolatry, nor free from Murder, as her worshipping of Idols or
Images does testify; and as her killing and destroying about Religion, and
Worship bears witness (which the Spirit of Christ never allowed of, not the
spotless Body of Christ never practiced.) Therefore the Church of Rome is not
holy, nor the spotless Body of Christ.

And as to that affirmation of A. S. in the third Number of his first Chapter
(viz.) Every man as he is Regenerated in Christ, and a member of his body, is
holy, and a Saint, though as he is the Son of Adam, be is a liar and a sinner.

Answ. To this I answer, That the most part of all the Sectaries in the World
will join with him in that particular; therefore he need not so much cry
against them: but the True Church will not own that Doctrine, neither can I own
it, because it is the Doctrine of Devils, and the Spirit of God testifies
against it. For it is impossible for any man to be both a Saint and a sinner at
one season: for if that could be, then might a man serve two Masters, which
Christ said could not be, Luke 16.13. And the Apostle said, He that commits
sin, is the Servant of sin, Joh. 8.34. and is free from righteousness, Romans
6.22. So has no part in Christ, who is the righteousness of God. And whosoever
loves or makes a Lie, shall not enter the Holy City; which is the true
Church, Revel. 21.27. Therefore is no member of it. Now let A. S. consider his
Ignorance, for according to his own confession, the true Church is built of
living believers (elect and precious) but he that is a liar and a sinner, is
dead (for the soul that sins shall dye, Ezekiel. 18.4.) Therefore, he that is a
Liar and a Sinner, is not a living Believer, nor yet holy, and a Saint: Yet I
do not deny, but that he that is regenerated in Christ, and is baptized into
him, and is thereby made a member of his spotless body, is holy and a Saint;
for by and through the second Adam, he is redeemed out of the first fallen
Adams state.

Well, but A. S. says, That all the members of the Church of Rome are baptized
and sanctified in Christ, and that all her Institutes and Ceremonies, etc. are
holy, and therefore she is holy.

Answ. I deny it, and he cannot prove it; for all who are baptized into Christ
(and are sanctified in him) have put on Christ, Gal. 3.27. and does live holy,
and have the mind of Christ, 1 Cor. 2.16. But the Church of Rome has not the
mind of Christ, neither does she live holy (as before proved;) Therefore she is
not holy. And as concerning her Institutions and Ceremonies, as Bowing to
Images, and Altars, and such things we never read that the holy Church in the
Primitive times, did practice such things; therefore we have no ground to
believe they are holy.

3. That the true Church is Catholic or Universal, I shall not go about to
deny: but I do deny that the Universality of the Church of Rome, is a
sufficient Argument to prove her to be the true Church; for consider.

1. What Church is more Universal then the great Whore (the false Church) who
has a name written, MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND
ABOMINATION OF THE EARTH, Rev. 7.5. Who sits upon the many waters, which are
Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, and People? Rev. 17.15. And did not the Whole
World, wonder after the Beast, that carries the Whore? Rev. 13.3. And did she
not sit as a Queen over them all, with her (fair Profession, or) golden cup in
her hand, full of Abominations, and Filthiness of her Fornication? Rev. 18.7.
and 17.4. And did not all the Inhabitants of the Earth, and the Kings of the
Earth drink of the Wine of her Fornication, and commit Fornication with her,
Rev. 18.3. and 17.^. (Mark) how universal was this great Whore, the false
Church, and how confident she was? for she said in her heart, that she should
see no sorrow, Rev. 18.7. And did she not glorify her self, and reign over the
kings of the Earth? Rev. 17.18. mark this thing. Is not this the very state of
the Church of Rome now at this day? does she not reign over the Kings of the
Earth, and over the Inhabitants of the Earth? and has she not so done long,
even for many ages? Witness Fox his Acts and Monuments, the first Volume, which
copiously relates the Authority she has exercised over Kings, and how Pope
Adrian made Fredricus the Emperor hold his stirrup while he got upon his
horse; yea, and shent him for his pains, because the poor Emperor (not being
used to that work) held his stirrup on the wrongside of his horse.

And again, Did not the great Whore (which John spoke of) drink the blood of
the Saints and Martyrs of Jesus? as Rev. 17.6. And was she not to have blood
given her to drink? And has not the Church of Rome drunk the blood of many
thousands of the Saints and Martyrs of Jesus? Surely the Histories of many
Generations past will testify she has: Therefore she is not the true Church,
but the Whore.

And have not many Nations gone into her, and committed fornication with her?
and does she not sit upon many Waters? the People, Kindreds, Tongues, and
Nations? and this kind of universality she makes use of, as an argument to
prove that she is the true Church: which may be truly said to be a part of her
Witchcrafts and Sorceries, with which she has long bewitched the Nations, even
all this long night of Apostasy, in which Antichrist has reigned, who has
blinded the invisible eye in people, and with this same pitiful shallow stuff
she would fain still blind that eye which God has opened in us: But blessed be
the Lord, the day is dawned which makes all things manifest.

Secondly, And farther, consider what a slender, or blind Argument it is, to
plead universality to prove the Church of Rome to be the true Church. Surely A.
S. did not consider, that they are many, who goes in the broad way that leads
to destruction, and that the whole World wondered after the Beast that carries
the Whore, the false Church; neither did he consider that they are but few who
finds (and walks in) the straight way which leads unto life; for had he
considered these things, he would have been ashamed to have produced such an
Argument to prove the Church of Rome to be the true Church. But its clear that
the universal Church of Rome sits upon the many Waters, and reigns over the
Kings of the Earth, and goes in the broad way; Therefore she is not the true
Church, but the Whore.

Fourthly, Again, That the true Church is Apostolic, and built upon the
Foundation of the holy Apostles and Prophets, Ephesians. 2.20. and was propagated
through the World by the Apostles, that I acknowledge, but that the Church of
Rome is Apostolic, or had her beginning in Christ and his Apostles, (as A. S.
affirms) or that she was propagated through the World by the Apostles, in
that discipline (Ceremonies, worshipping of Idols, or Images, Murdering the
People of God, etc.) in which she now stands, that I do deny, and its
Abomination in A. S. to affirm it. For consider;

First, When, or where did Christ, or his Apostles begin the practice of Bowing
to Images, or Worshipping Idols? or when did any of them Bow to an Alter of
Wood, or Pray with a String of Beads, or Pray to Saints, or carry a Silver, or
Wooden Cross about with them, or Murder any because they were not of their
Faith? The Church of Rome cannot prove that ever Christ or his Apostles began,
or practiced any of these things; nor that they were in being in their days,
we defy them; but they are inventions set up in the false Church, in the dark
Night of Apostasy, that has been over the Nations since the Apostles days,
and are practiced in the Church of Rome to this day; Therefore she is not
Apostolic, but Apostate like.

Fifthly, That the true Church, or the Members of it are visible, I shall not
deny; and that she is the Light of the World, I do confess; but that the Church
of Rome is the true Church, or the Light of the World, because she is visible,
that I do not acknowledge, but deny; for although the true Church, or the
Members of it, are visible, yet so is the Whore also.

But then some will say, How are they then to be distinguished? First, I
answer, By their fruits? as Christ said, men do not gather grapes of thorns,
nor figs of thistles, Matthew. 7.16. neither can one Fountain, send forth bitter
Water and sweet, James 3.12. nor a good Tree cannot bring forth bad fruit; But
the visible Church of Rome brings forth bad fruits, and sends forth bitter
Waters, as the Cruelties exercised by her, and the Murders she has acted for
Ages past testifies; and as the Idolatries exercised in her to this day (as
before mentioned) witnesses: For such things was never exercised by, nor in
the true Church, in Christ's nor the Apostles days; therefore though the Church
of Rome be visible, yet her fruits testifies, that she is not the true Church.

Secondly, Again A. S. says, (and diabolically affirms in the second Page of
his pretended Reconciler of Religions) That the true Church is composed of both
good and bad, wheat, and tares; which I do abominate to acknowledge, and is
blasphemy in him to affirm: for the true Church is built of Living Stones, 1
Pet. 2.5. Elect and Precious; or (as A. S. affirms) of living Believers: but
no living Believers can be truly called the bad, nor the tares, but elect and
precious; and all that are living, or precious, are the good; therefore the
true Church is built of the good only.

Thirdly, but if the Church of Christ (which A. S. in his second page,
affirms is the Kingdom of Christ) be composed of both good and bad, then
according to his own affirmation, the Kingdom of Christ is part good, and part
bad, which is horrid blasphemy in A. S. to affirm.

Oh gross darkness and confusion! Art thou a Member of the Church that calls it
self the light of the World? Oh, dark, dull, gloomy light! the Lord God
Almighty bring all his people out of that dark Cell, that they may walk in his
mavelous Light, which makes all things manifest of what sort it is.

Fourthly, But if you say that Christ likened the Kingdom to a Net that was
cast into the Sea, which gathered of all Kinds; -- I answer he did so; yet when
it came to Land, there was none composed, or gathered into the vessels, but the
good only, and the bad were cast away, Matthew. 13.48. Therefore the true Church
is not composed of both good and bad, but of the good only.

Fifthly, but if you object, that the tares and wheat were both to grow
together in the Fleld; I answer, they Were so until the Harvest; (and the
Fleld is the World, Mat. 23.39. but the true Church is not of the World, Joh.
17.14.) but when the Reapers were sent forth (which were the Angels, that had
the Gospel to preach, Rev. 14.6. who went to disciple people, and to baptize
them into the true Church, Mat. 28.19.) Their Commission was to compose or
gather the Wheat only, and to separate the Tares from it, and to bind them in
bundles for the Fire, Mat. 13.30. and therefore the true Church is not composed
of both Wheat and Tares, but of Wheat only.

Sixthly, Farther, If you say that there were some in the true Church, in the
Apostles days, that were false brethren, and these were bad; I answer, Though
they were amongst them, yet they were not of them: as the Apostle said, 1 John
2.19. Therefore the true Church is not composed of both good and bad, but of
the good only.

But to return to the fifth part of A. S. his Argument, where he says, That
the Church of Rome is known to the World, in her Bishops, Pastors, and
Believers, etc. And therefore she is visible.

Answ. Although that proves her visible, yet it does not prove her to be the
true Church, but the contrary; For the true Church, that was the light of the
World, was not known to the World, John 17.14. but the visible Church of Rome
is known to the World, (as A. S. himself affirms) therefore she is not the
true Church, but the contrary.

Again, the true Church wrestled not with flesh and blood, neither were her
weapons carnal, but spiritual, and she wrestled with spiritual wickednesses
that were in the high places, and broke down the strong holds of iniquity, 2
Cor. 10.3, 4. but the Church of Rome wrestles with flesh and blood, and kills
men's bodies about Religion; as the whole Christendom knows; and the spiritual
wickednesses are still standing in her, as before proved, and as all the World
sufficiently knows; therefore she is not the true Church.

Sixthly, The infallibleness of the true Church, of which Christ is supreme
Head and Governor, I do not go about to deny; but that the Church of Rome is
infallible, that I do deny. For,

First, Although A. S. has affirmed, that she has always remained since
Christ's time unto this day, without interruption etc. yet he never proved it;
neither can he do it; for, as before I have said, we never read that the true
Church in Christ's days was found in such things; neither was such things then
found in her as is now found in the Church of Rome, and which the Church of
Rome is now found in: by which it is clear, that she has not always remained
since Christ's time in the state she now stands.

Secondly, But if she has always remained, since Christ time to this day,
without interruption (as A. S. says she has) then she cannot possibly be the
true Church; for the true Church was interrupted since the Resurrection and
Ascension of Christ, (and yet remained, as hereafter I shall show;) and in the
Apostles days her interruption began, and some of the Apostles foresaw it, and
said, of your selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, Acts 20.30. and
when they were arisen, they withstood the truth, as Jannes and Jambres
withstood Moses, 2 Timothy 3.8. so here the interruption of the true Church began:
and after this John saw the Dragon (interrupting, or) persecuting her into the
Wilderness, where she had a place prepared of God, that they might feed her
there, a thousand, two hundred, and threescore days, Rev. 12.6. and ver. 13,
14. concerning which, I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter; so on this
wise the true Church was interrupted since Christ's days: But A. S. says, that
the Church of Rome has always remained since Christ's time without
interruption; Therefore she is not the true Church.

Thirdly, And whereas A. S. farther says, that the Church of Rome shall always
remain to the end of the World; and therefore she is infallible.

I answer, He has not at all confirmed that by any proof, neither has he any
farther proof than his own affirmation; except he would produee that saying of
the Mother of Harlots, (viz.) I sit as a Queen, and am no Widow, and shall see
no sorrow, Rev. 18.7. And indeed that would be a very pitiful Argument to
prove the Church of Rome infallible; but none other can he produce (except he
could first prove her to be the true Church, which he is never able to do; his
best Argument by which he has undertaken it, being already confuted) Therefore
we have no more cause to believe his Affirmation, than we have to believe the
sayings of the forementioned Mother of Harlots, for they are both alike to us;
and though she said, she should see no sorrow, yet John (who was in the Spirit
of the Lord) said, that in one day her Desolation should come, Rev. 18.8. And
although A. S. says, That the Church of Rome shall always remain to the end
of the World; yet I say, in the Name of the Lord, and by the same Spirit that
John was in, That the one day, of which John spoke, is already dawned, in which
the Desolation of that Great Whore, the Church of Rome shall come; and as
surely, as when Sodom was overthrown, the Cities round about it were overthrown
also, 2 Pet. 2.9. Jude ver. 7. so certainly, when this great City Babylon is
overthrown, and made desolate, the Suburbs thereof shall be overthrown, and
made desolate also. The Mouth of the Lord has spoken it, and therefore she
must fail in her Prophesies, and cease in her Being, which, as A. S. says,
the true Church cannot.

Fourthly, And farther, the Church of Rome is variable in her Judgments, as the
diversities of Councels that she has held concerning matters of Faith, bears
witness; for the following General Counsel has oft-times excluded that, which
was concluded on by the former: and surely both cannot be infallible, they
being quite contradictory one to the other. Read the 15th chapter of F. H. his
Book, entitled, THE GLORY OF THE TRUE CHURCH DISCOVERED, etc. wherein the
contradictions of the General Counsels which the Church of Rome has held, are
sufficiently made manifest; so that I need not trouble my self to insert them
here: and thereby its evident enough, that the Church of Rome is not infallible.

Fifthly, Again, if A. S. or any other, could prove that the Church of Rome had
always remained since Christ's time; yet, as aforesaid, that is not a
sufficient Argument to prove her infallible, or that she cannot fail, nor
cease. For consider, the Dragon, that old Serpent, called the Devil, who was a
Murderer from the beginning, (who gave power to the Beast that carries the
Whore, that drinks the Saints blood, that said she should see no sorrow) was
before the days of Christ's appearance in the flesh, yet the Dragon is not
infallible; But the Church of Rome is upheld by the Murderer, or carried by
the Dragons power in the Beast, as the Murders acted by her bears witness;
therefore she is no more infallible than the Dragon is.

Seventhly, And as to the 7th part of A. S. his Argument, wherein he says, The
True Church is inerrable, and then says, that the Church of Rome is this
inerrable True Church: for all the Sectaries, Schismatics, and Heretics in
the World, says he, could never yet show wherein she erred, nor ever shall:
Therefore she is inerrable.

Answ. 1. I answer, although the Heretics could not prove that the Church of
Rome has erred, yet there are many, who are members of the true Church, of
which Christ is Head, and supreme Governor alone, that can prove wherein she
has erred, and does still grossly err from the Doctrine, Practice, and
Discipline of the true Church, as it stood in the Apostles days: for the
Apostle in his days said, Let every man be fully persuaded in his own
Conscience, Romans 14.5. and did not go about to force People to conform to such
things, that they were not persuaded of in their consciences, nor to compel
them by outward Laws to conform thereunto; but the Church of Rome does not
admit, that every one should walk or act, according as they are persuaded in
their own Consciences, but goes about by outward Laws to compel them to conform
to that which she calls her holy Ordinances and Institutions, which many, for
conscience sake toward Gods, dare not conform to, because they know them to be
invented Idolatries; and they, who cannot for Conscience sake submit to her
Impositions, or drink of her Cup of Abominations, then to be sure she will
drink their Blood: Witness the Blood she has drunk (for above this thousand
years past) of them that could not, for Conscience sake toward God, conform to
her Ordinances: And therefore she has erred from that Spirit which was in the
true Church, and from the Apostles Doctrine, and is still in the Error.

Secondly, In the true Church in the Apostles days, every one, as he had
received the Gift of the Spirit of God, so he might Administer, 1 Pet. 4.10.
and the Prophets might speak two or three; and if any thing was revealed to him
that stood by, he might speak, and the first should be silent, 1 Cor. 14.29,
30, 31. But this is not the order of the Church of Rome, as is sufficiently
manifested to all Christendom; therefore she has erred from the Apostles
Spirit and Order, and is still in the Error: And thus I might produce many more
Arguments, to show wherein the Church of Rome has erred, and does err, only my
desire is to be as brief as may be, so that satisfaction may be given: for
which I doubt not but this is sufficient, as to that particular.

8. And as concerning Miracles in the true Church, I do confess and bear
witness, that there are Miracles wrought in her daily; but that all Miracles
are an Argument sufficient to prove a people to be the true Church; that I do
not acknowledge, but deny: For,

First, the Magicians of Egypt could by their Sorceries, or Enchantments
imitate those things in the sight of the Egyptians, that Moses and Aaron did by
the Power of God, Exodus 8.7. and the false Prophet he wrought lying Miracles
before the Beast that carries the Whore, insomuch that he caused fire to come
down out of Heaven in the sight of men, Rev. 13.13, 14. and chap. 19. ver. 20.
And this the Whore might have said was done in confirmation of her faith and
doctrines; (as A. S. does) yet nevertheless it was done by the Dragons power,
who was a Murderer from the beginning; For he gave power to the Beast (that
carries the Whore) to do such things, Rev. 13.2. and therefore the Miracles in
the Church of Rome (if now there be any) is no infallible evidence to prove her
to be the true Church. Well,

2. But then it may be some will say, that this is harsh judgment, and how can
you tell but that the Miracles wrought in the Church of Rome, are wrought by
the Power of God? or how can you distinguish between Miracles wrought by the
Power of God, and Miracles wrought by the Dragons power.

Answ. I answer, we have an infallible way to judge in this particular; For,
all Miracles wrought by the murdering power, are not wrought by the Power of
God, but by the Dragons power, for the Dragon, that old Serpent, who is called
the Devil, was a Murderer from the beginning, (but Christ the Power of God, is
not a murdering power, for he came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them,
Luke 9.56. Therefore the Miracles wrought by Christ, the Power of God, are not
wrought by a murdering power) But the Miracles of the Church of Rome (if now
there be any) are wrought by a murdering power; for the many murders she has
acted, sufficiently testifies to the whole Christendom, that a murdering power
rules in her: By which its clear, that the Miracles wrought in the Church of
Rome,) if there be any) are wrought by the Dragons power, and not by the Power
of God: So that my judgment concerning the Miracles in the Church of Rome is
not harsh, but according to the Spirit of Truth and sound Reason.

Thirdly, but for all A. S. in his Epistle Dedicatory, has made such a great
noise about Miracles wrought by a Roman Catholic Priest in and about London
and Westminster, yet when he comes to prove that the Church of Rome is powerful
in Miracles, then he does just as much as nothing, but takes an easy way to
get out from that thing, which seemingly he undertook to go through with, by
referring of us for a witness of his Affirmation to nostre dame de Loretto,
nostre dame de Montague, nostre dame de Hall, and to the whole World, etc. Now
what a pitiful proof or witness is this, which A. S. directs us to; For as the
Apostles says, the whole World lies in wickedness, 1 John. 5.19. and wonders
after the Beast, by whom lying Miracles are wrought, Rev. 13.3. So that the
Miracles which the World bears witness to, are lying Miracles; for the World
knows not Christ, nor his Church, 1 John 3.1. by whom true Miracles are
wrought; for when Christ wrought Miracles amongst the World, they did not bear
witness to him, but said he did it by the Prince of Devils, Mat. 9.34. So that
the witness that A. S. calls for, confirms my forementioned Affirmation, viz.
That, the Miracles in the Church of Rome are wrought by the Dragons power in
the Beast, and false Prophet, that the whole World wonders after.

Fourthly, and for nostre dame de Loretto, and the rest mentioned, they
signify nothing as to our satisfaction in this particular, because they are
altogether unknown to us; neither can we attain to a certain knowledge of them,
if we would; for the information of the Church of Rome is to us no
satisfaction; so as I said before (that A. S.) for matter of proving his
Affirmation, has done just as much as nothing; only made a show, like a Cloud
without Rain: But methinks, if there were so many Miracles wrought daily, by a
Roman Priest about London, etc. as A. S. seems to make a noise of; he should
have instanced some of them particularly for our satisfaction: but seeing he
has not instanced any, we have just cause to believe, that there are none at
all.

Ninthly, So to proceed to the ninth part of A. S. his first Argument, viz. Out
of the True Church none can be saved.

I answer, That thing I do not at all deny, for all that are saved are of the
true Church; but that none can be saved out of the Church of Rome, that I do
deny; for the Church of Rome is not the true Church, but the Whore that drinks
the Blood of the Saints, as afore-proved; therefore out of the Church of Rome
people may be saved. Wherefore let all who expect or desire Salvation make
haste out of this great City Babylon: And run for your lives toward Jerusalem,
the holy City, the true Church, the Lambs Wife, in whose Light the Nations of
them that are saved must walk, Rev. 21.24. lest you perish within the Borders
of Babylon, whose desolation shall certainly come in one day: Yea, Death, and
Mourning, and Famine, for strong is the Lord, who (is now arisen and) judges
her.

The Mystery of the Whore farther discovered.
Well, But if the Church of Rome says, That she does not drink the blood of the
Saints, but the blood of Heretics, etc. and therefore she is the true Church.

1. I answer, so, or to that effect, said the Destroyers and Murderers in all
Ages, even they that put Christ to death; they did it not in their own account,
as he was the Son of God, but as a Blasphemer; and the Apostles were persecuted
as Spreaders of Heresy, and Shedders of Sedition, and not as Saints and
Servants of the Lord, in their Adversaries account, Acts 24.5. and thus the
murdering persecuting spirit has in all Ages, as at this day sought to shelter
it self, but this covering must now be ripped off, for the Power of God is arisen
that rends the vail of Darkness, and the Day is dawned that makes all things
manifest.

2. And further; If they were Heretic, etc. whose blood the Church of Rome
drinks, yet that does not argue that she is the true Church, but the contrary;
for the true Church did never drink the blood of Heretics, nor persecute any,
because they were Heretics; but the greatest punishment that ever Christ
appointed for Heretics, was, that they should account them as Publicans, and
Heathens, Mat. 18.17.

3. So its clear, that Christ the Power of God, and the true Church that had
the mind of Christ, did never kill, nor persecute any because they were
Heretics, or did not believe, nor yet because (after they believed) they made
shipwreck of faith; but labored in the Spirit of Love and Meekness, to restore
them, and to convince them by sound Doctrine; but if they refused to receive
admonition, or to submit to the Church after due admonition given, then they
let them receive the punishment aforesaid, and refused to have fellowship with
them, and this was the greatest punishment that ever the true Church inflicted
upon any, though they were Rebellious, and this was the way to make true
Believers of people, which force and compulsion, by penal Laws will never do:
though its true, compulsive Laws may make many of them Hypocrites, who fears
man more then God; but they who fears not man that can kill the body, and can
do no more, but fears the Lord God almighty above all, such will not bow to the
compulsive Laws of men, which violates the righteous Law of God in their own
hearts, (no more then Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego would bow to the Image
that Nebuchadnezar set up) though for their stedfastness they suffer the pangs
of death, as many of their Predecessors have done, whose blood the Church of
Rome has drunk.

Thus much in brief to the nine particulars of A. S. his first Argument, by
which (I perceive) he thought he had infallibly proved the Church of Rome to be
the true Church; but what his Argument is worth for his purpose, let all who
reads this judge.

And the next thing he undertakes, is, to prove Peter to be the Rock or
Foundation upon which Christ built his Church; and to accomplish this design,
he rambles through several Languages, into which the Scripture has bin
translated; and in the conclusion he says (a great lie) to Peter then Christ
said, upon thee I will build my Church, etc. when none of the several Languages
(which he makes use of to prove it) say any such thing, according to his own
interpretation of them; and indeed its blasphemy in A. S. to affirm it: But
then he says, That Christ is the primary Rock, and Peter the secondary Rock.

Reply. But how can that be, that Peter should be a secondary Rock, for A. S.
cannot prove that God ever ordained, or appointed a secondary Rock to build his
Church on, (neither do we in all the Scriptures read of a secondary Rock once
mentioned) for the Apostle affirms the contrary, saying, Another Foundation
can no man lay, then that which is already laid, 1 Cor. 3.11. which is Jesus
Christ: So he is the first, and the last, the beginning and the end; and A. S.
his Affirmation is nothing worth for his purpose: nay, its worse then nothing,
for it discovers his Deceit and Ignorance, though I perceive his intent and aim
was to gratify his Master the Pope, by pleading his Supremacy, under pretense
of setting Peter above the rest of the Apostles, when indeed, its manifest
enough, that his intent was to set up the Pope, as Lord and Master over Gods
Heritage, Gentile like, contrary to that saying of our [one] Lord Christ, viz.
Be not many Masters, for one is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are
brethren, Mat- 23.8. So that Peter was not set up as a visible head over, the
Church of Christ, as A. S. says the Pope is over the. Church of Rome, neither
was Peter above other of the Apostles, but a Fellow Servants with them, and they
all fellow-workers together with Christ, 2 Cor. 6.1. and Paul was not at all
inferior to Peter (in relation to his spiritual authority) for he himself said
(yet not boastingly, but truly) that he came not behind the very chiefest
Apostles, 2 Cor. 12.11. So that Peter was no more the Rock then Paul was; and
what was Paul; or what was Apollo; or Peter either, but Ministers by whom the
Church believed, 1 Cor. 3.5?

So it was not the work of the Apostles to set themselves one above another,
for they abased themselves, that the Lord Jesus Christ might be exalted:
Neither did they preach themselves, but Jesus Christ the Lord, and themselves
Servants, etc. 2 Cor. 4.5. by which it appears that the Pope does not truly
succeed Peter in the same spirit that he and the rest of the Apostles were in,
who had the Spirit and mind of Christ, who made himself of no reputation, Phil.
2.7. but the Pope truly succeeds those whom the Apostle saw would come, that
would be covetous Boasters, and proud Blasphemers, 2 Timothy 3.2. as does appear
by his preaching up himself, and his boasting of his great power and
superiority, witness Fox his Acts, the first Volume page 1023. and so on; where
you may read at large how several of the Popes of Rome have sufficiently
declared themselves to be covetous Boasters, and proud Blasphemers, and have
also laid themselves open enough to the view of all who have an eye to see, so
that I need not produce any farther Argument to prove the Pope a proud
Blasphemer.

Then (...) A. S. in his third chapter undertakes to prove, That neither all
Sects, nor any one of them, is the true Church, etc. Whose Cause I am not
engaged in, nor intend to plead, therefore I shall let that pass. But his
fourth and fifth Chapters contains several Arguments, by which he undertakes
farther to prove the Church of Rome to be the true Church; together with some
Queries propounded. To which I intend to return a brief and sober Answer.

1. First, A. S. says, That which was once the true Church is now, etc. But
the Roman Pontificial was once the true Church, etc. I answer, I do not deny
but that there was a true Church at Rome in the Apostles days, but that the
Church now at Rome is therefore the true Church, that does not follow; for as I
have before proved, the true Church in the Apostles days was far different,
both in Discipline and Practice from the Church of Rome that now is.

But then A. S. says, If the Roman Pontificial did fall, what Church did she
fall from? If she did fail, when, etc?

I answer, Paul in the first Chapter in his Epistle to the Church of Rome,
spoke of some, who when (...) God, did not glorify him as God, but became vain
in their imaginations, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an
Image made like to corruptible man; and so not liking to retain God in their
knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, and they were filled with
unrighteousness, fornication, and wickedness, covetousness, envy, murder, etc.
Romans 1.21, 23, 28, 29. And is not this the very state of the Church of Rome at
this day? is she not now filled with these things? Surely yes; Thousands of
thousands must acknowledge it, if they consider it, and speak the truth. Oh the
murders acted by her, and the blood she has drunk, as before hinted, and the
Adulteries committed within her Borders. Indeed these, and many other her
abominations, are innumerable, as she her self full well knows; therefore she
is indeed fallen, and deeply revolted from that pure Spirit, in which the true
Church stood in the Apostles days: Thence she is fallen, and the time when she
fell, was, when she began to enter into these aforesaid abominations that is
now found in her. Well,

2dly. But then A. S. says, That if the true Church be infallible, she must
have always remained without interruption, since Christ's time, to this day,
etc.

I answer, although the true Church be infallible, yet it does not absolutely
follow, that she must have always remained without interruption unto this day;
for, as I have already proved, the true Church was interrupted by the Dragon,
and was persecuted into the Wilderness, but she did not fail, but remained
there, and had a being there, a place prepared of God for her; concerning which
I shall have occasion to speak more fully shortly.

3dly. But A. S. says, That no other Church on Earth has remained unto this
day without interruption, beside the Roman Pontificial, and therefore she is
the true Church.

I answer no, she is not therefore the true Church, but the Whore; for as I
have already proved, the true Church was interrupted, and yet remained.

4. But then said A. S. If any can say, that there has remained any other
Church on Earth, since Christ's time unto this day without interruption, and
error, let him tell what was she, or what is she? where was she? or where is
she, what is her name? what Bishops, Pastors, and Believers had she, or yet
has she? what Emperors or Kings did adhere to her, or now do? what general
Councils did she hold? what Heretics did she condemn? what Academies did she
erect or confirm; what Churches or Monastries did she build? etc. And then said
he, To these, and such like Interrogatories, all the Schismatics, Sectaries,
and Heretics in the World cannot answer.

Answ. To which I answer, Although all the Sectaries in the World cannot answer
those questions; yet there are many, who are Members of the true Church (not of
the Church of Rome) that can answer them; and first, I say there has remained
another Church since Christ's time to this day (besides the Roman Pontificial
that now is) though not without interruption; yet the true Church (as before
proved) was interrupted. And as to those questions, (viz.) What was she, or
what is she? etc.

I answer, she was in John's day a wonder in Heaven, a Woman clothed with the
Sun (that and there she was) and the Moon was under her Feet, and upon her Head
a Crown of twelve Stars, Rev. 12.1. And having brought forth a man-child, that
was to rule all Nations with his rod of Iron, the enmity of the Dragon then
arose, who sought to devour the Man-child; but being by the Hand of God
prevented of his purpose on the man-child, ver. 5. he than cast out his flood
of Persecution after the Woman, ver. 15. (of whom this Ruler was born) and
drove her into the Wilderness whither she fled from him, to her place prepared
of God, that they might feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore
days, Rev. 12.6.14. ( To A. S. his Query (viz.) where was she?
and there she has been) and there she has sitten as in a sollitary place, and
in a Mourning State and Condition, out of which she To, where is she?
is now returning, and is now coming up out of the Wilderness, and is
descending from God, as a Bride adorned for her Husband, Rev. 21.2. and her To
A. S's query, what is her name?
name is, the Bride, the Lambs Wife, the holy City, ver. 9. New Jerusalem. And
now is Jerusalem shaking her self from the Dust of the Earth (in which she has
been trodden of the Gentiles (and now is she putting on her beautiful Garments,
and now does the Solitary begin to rejoice, and the barren that did not bear,
begins to break forth into singing, Isa. 54.1. And the things that many
prophets desired to see, and could not see, is now seen and revealing; glory to
God in the highest, The day is come which we have waited for, we will be glad
and rejoice in it; and now the Time, Times, and a half Time. is expired, in
which the true Church has been fed in the Wilderness; and now is the forty and
two Months expired also, for which Time the holy City has been trodden under
foot of the Gentiles, Rev. 11.2. in which Time the Beast had power given him to
continue, Rev. 13.5. and the whole World wondered after him, and worshipped
him, and in that Time it was given unto him, to make war with the Saints, and
to overcome them; and he received power over all Kindreds, and Tongues and
Nations, that all that dwelt upon the Earth should worship him, whose names
were not written in the Book of Life, of the Lamb slain from the Foundation of
the World; if any man have an Ear, let him hear, Rev. 13.7, 8, 9. And this was
the Time that the true Church was in her mourning state, which now begins to be
over; Glory to God for ever, the day of rejoicing is come.

And for her Bishops, Pastors, and Believers that she had.

I answer, Christ was, and is her Bishop and chief Pastor, 1 Pet. 2.25. And the
rest (after the Apostles days) were they that fed her in the Wilderness; and
her Believers were those that had the Testimony of Jesus, Rev. 12.17. whose
Blood the Whore drunk. And they are now her Believers, whose Blood the Whore
thirsts after. And as to that question (viz.) What Emperors or Kings did adhere
to her, or now do?

Answ. I answer, On this wise did the Pharisees Query with those Officers whom
they sent to take Jesus and bring him unto them, saying, Have any of the
Rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him? Joh. 7.48. Well, what Emperors or
Kings did adhere to him at that time? Was he not therefore the true Christ,
because the Rulers of the World, and the Pharisees rejected him? And what said
the Apostle to the true Church in his day? You see your calling, Brethren, how
that not many wise men after the Flesh, not many mighty, nor noble, etc. but
God has chosen the foolish things of this World, to confound the wise, etc.
that Flesh might not glory in his Presence, 1 Cor. 1.26, 27. And further, the
Apostle (who preached Christ) said, That he preached the Wisdom of God in a
Mystery, which none of the Princes of the World know, etc. 1 Cor. 2.7, 8. By
which it appears, that none of the Princes of the World knew Christ, the
Wisdom of God* 1 Cor. 1.24. And the true Church was in the World as Christ was;
for the Apostle said, as (...), so are we in this present World, 1 John 4.17.
And (...) World knows as not, ver. 1. because it knew not him. So that
understanding the Princes of this World knew not Christ, when he was amongst
them, and although the Rulers believed not in him, nor did adhere to him, when
he was come; yet that did not argue, that he was not the true Christ. And
notwithstanding it was so, that the true Church was unknown to the World, and
was composed not of many wise men after the flesh, nor of the Nobles of the
Earth, but was persecuted by them (as she is at this day) yet she was the true
Church for all that.

And seeing it was so, that the Princes and Rulers did not adhere to her, in
the time of her flourishing state (when she was clothed with the Sun) how can
it be expected that they should adhere to her in her persecuted state, and in
her mourning Wilderness-state (for a rich man shall very hardly enter the
Kingdom, Mat. 19.23. but there is more in them words) And moreover, seeing the
Kings of the Earth committed Fornication with the great Whore, and went into
her, how then can it possibly be expected that they should adhere to the true
Church? Surely all who have a spiritual eye open, may be hereby satisfied as to
this particular. And further, as to that Query (viz.) What general Councils did
she hold, and what Heretics did she Condemn?

Answ. I answer, she has not been in a capacity in her Wilderness-state to
hold General Counsels, as in the time of her flourishing state; yet the mighty
God has always been her wonderful Counselor, Isa. 9.6. and the Members of
her has stood in (and held to) his Counsel, according to the manifestation
thereof received by them, not loving their lives unto death, as the Church of
Rome well knows, (who have drunk the blood of many of them) or shall know to
her sorrow and pangs. And as for the true Churches condemning Heretics; the
Church of Rome knows, that those members of her, whose blood she has drunk,
did always condemn those Heresies, that are healed, and the Idolatries acted
in the Church of Rome, and did always give Testimony against her Superstitious
inventions, and denied to have Fellowship with her therein, and looked upon her
as reprobated from the true Faith (as Fox his Acts copiously relates) and this
was a great Condemnation, as the Spirit of Christ gave commission to the true
Church to pass upon Heretics.

Again, as to that question, viz. What Academies did she erect.

Answ. I answer, A people Erecting of Academies, is not an Argument sufficient
to prove them to be the true Church; for what Academies, or Universities did
the Apostles erect or confirm, or attain the Knowledge of God in? Was it not
the Light that shined in their Hearts, that gave them this knowledge? 2 Cor.
4.6. And was not this Light the Law, that was the Apostles Schoolmaster till
Christ? Gal. 3.24. And is not the Law which is Light, Pro. 6.23. written in the
hearts of all people? And is it not a sufficient Schoolmaster now, to bring
people (who are taught by it) unto the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the
Face of Christ, as it did the Apostles then? What need then is there of
erecting Academies; for people cannot attain to the Knowledge of God by natural
Learning, 1 Cor. 1.21. nor thereby be made true Ministers of Jesus Christ. Yet
I am not against having an outward School-house, or some convenient place for
the educating, or bringing up of children in Natural Learning, which is good in
its place; but that any can thereby be brought to the Knowledge of God, or made
true Ministers of Jesus Christ, that I cannot own. Neither was this way of
making Ministers by Natural-Learning, or setting of them up by man, in being,
until people had forsaken the right way, and went into Cains way, and Balaams,
and then the envy and murder began amongst the professed Christians, and then
they could not endure sound Doctrine, but heapt up to themselves Teachers
according, to their own hearts lusts, who knew nothing but what they knew
naturally, as bruit Beasts, etc. and this the Apostle Paul foresaw; and wot of
to Timothy, 2. Tim. 4.3. and Peter prophesied of them also, 2 Pet. 2. and John
and Jude saw them come; 1 John 2.18. Jude 10.11. so that by natural learning,
and ordination of man, no true Minister of Christ was ever made, or sent forth;
but contrariwise, the Apostle Paul was made a Minister, (viz.) not of man, nor
by men, nor yet by natural learning, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ,
Gal. 1.1. so we do not understand that in the Apostles days they did erect
Accademies, or that they had any need of them, and indeed I cannot but look
upon it as an Ignorant question to be proposed by A. S. upon this account. But
to his next Query, viz. What Churches and Monasteries did she build?

Answ. I answer, this is as Ignorant a question as the former, and great
foolishness to ask, what Churches the Church built? however this I say, they
who were Members of the true Church, did build up one another in their most
holy faith, Jude 20. And as for Monasteries, or Monk-houses, we hear of such
thing that was in being in the Apostles days, neither do we believe that there
is any need of them; for we do not read in the holy Scriptures, that ever the
true Church, in any Generation, built such places; but we know, that many such
places have been erected and built within the borders of the great City
Babylon, since the Apostasy began, and since the right way was forsaken, and
many other Superstitious inventions and Idolatries, as before hinted, has been
set up, relating to the Beasts and Dragons worship, all which God has
determined to throw down; and when the Desolation of all these things comes,
and the seven Mountains upon which the Whore sits, comes to be laid waste,
according as has been prophesied in Ages past, Isa. 42.15. And when the great
Whore comes to drink the Cup of Gods fury, which is already filled into the
hands of the Saints of the most High, to pour out unto her, Rev. 12. I say,
then shall she knows that God has spoken by me; and that I have herein
declared the Truth according as I received it from, and by the Spirit of the
Lord. And thus much as to his Queries.

But then he speaks of another Clear and Easy Way to find out the True Church,
te try all Churches by the true Catechism, and see which of them all says it
truly, believes it rightly, etc. and that which does, is the true.

Answ. I answer, to try all Churches by their Doctrine, and Practice, and see
which is most agreeable to the Principles, Doctrines, and Practice of the true
Church in the Apostles days, is indeed a way that I do very well approve of;
and if all controversies betwixt you and us might be decided after this manner,
(laying aside all carnal Weapons, carnal Laws, Prisons, Fires, and the like,
which has been the Weapons that the Church of Rome has defended her self
with, for many Ages past, and does at this day) I say then it would be indeed
well, and we shall be very willing to engage with you with spiritual Weapons,
bring the best you can form or find out; but for carnal Weapons, we are
redeemed from them, and the Weapons of our warfare are spiritual; so I say,
upon equal terms we shall be very willing to dispute the matters with you; that
are in controversy betwixt us, and they who are found, either you or us, in
Doctrine, Life, and Practice, to be most agreeable to the true Church in the
primitive times, shall be owned, and acknowledged to be the true Church now at
this day. And they who are detected to be in the Steps, Practices, and
Doctrines of them, whom the holy Prophets, Christ, and his Apostles testified
against, shall be concluded to be the false Church now at this day: and upon
these terms, as I said before, we shall be very ready and willing to join
issue with you, at any time or place, that you with us shall agree upon.

And whereas A. S. says, That all the Schismatics, Sectaries and Heretics in
the World, cannot truly say that Prayer that Christ taught his Disciples, viz.
Our Father which art in Heaven etc. or, said he, they are continually doing the
Works of the Devil, and are his children, and consequently cannot truly call
God Father.

I answer, therefore the Church of Rome cannot call God Father, for she is, and
long has been, doing the works of the Devil, the Murderer, as before proved;
therefore she is of her father the Devil, and cannot call God Father in Truth
and in Righteousness. Then A. S. rambles through several other particulars, in
which he controverts with Sectaries, etc. whose cause I am not concerned to
plead, only this small hint before I have given to prove the Church of Rome one
of those Sects, who cannot speak the forementioned words truly, and so I shall
leave the Sectaries, with whom A. S. controverts, to plead their own cause; for
the thing that was chiefly in my heart, when I took in hand to write this brief
Reply, was to prove the Church of Rome not to be the true Church; and the Chief
Arguments by him Produced to prove her the True Church, I have already in brief
answered.

Again, A. S. in his 6th Chapter, makes it his business to prove the Church to
be the Judge of all controversies in matters of faith, and says, That not
every man, nor human reason, nor the private Spirit, nor the Bible is this
Judge; and to prove it, he quotes Matthew. 18.17. where Christ said, tell the
Church, etc.

Answ. To which I answer, That the Judgment of the true Church, of which
Christ is Head, in matters of Faith, I do not deny; for being governed in all
things by the Head Christ, (to whom all Judgment is committed, John 5.20.) the
Judgment thereof must of necessity be Ture, (for the Strength of Israel cannot
Lie) and ought for to be submitted unto by all; But the Church of Rome being
not the True Church, (she being not Governed by the invisible Head, Christ, to
whom all Judgment is committed, as before proved) Therefore she is not Judge of
Controversies in matters of Faith. And the True Church, to whom Christ said, He
that Hears you, Hears me, were such as heard Christ, and in whom the Spirit
of the Father spoke, Mat. 10.20. But the Church of Rome does not hear Christ,
as hereafter I shall prove; therefore they who hear the Church of Rome, do not
hear Christ. But surely when A. S. began this work of deciding Controversies,
he had forgotten that the Church was the only Judge in that particular, and not
every man, nor the private spirit; for had he considered that, (he being but a
particular man) would not have undertaken the Churches work; as appears by the
Title of his Book he has, for he calls it, A brief Decider of all
Controversies in matters of Faith, which Book we have cause to judge is his own
only work, and not the Churches; in which we find him condemning himself for
the thing which he is doing; for, as appears by his aforesaid Title, himself
undertakes to decide controversies; and in his 6th Chapter he affirms, 'That
the Church is the only Judge, or decider of all controversies: But this is,
that his confusion may the more appear, as it has done in many other things,
as may be seen in this small Treatise; and surely, if the Pope have no better
Servants then A. S. to do his work for him, he had better keep them idle, than
to employ them in such a work; for in the end they will bring more shame to him
than they will honor; for such like confusions, and other abominations, have
already made the very name of the Pope an ill favor to all true Christians.

And one thing more in A. S. his 6th Chapter, I cannot well omit to observe,
where he said, The spirit inspireth when he will, and you hear his voice, but
cannot tell whence, from God or the Devil he does come, or whither to Heaven or
to Hell he does go; and then says, So is every one that is born of the spirit;
and to prove this, he quotes Luke 9.55. where Christ said, Ye know not what
Spirit ye are of.

Now consider the blindness, and ignorance, or else the wilful wickedness, of
A. S. who jumbles a deal of Scriptures together, blasphemously wresting of them
to his own destruction, or at least, to the destruction of his own work in
hand, thinking thereby to blind the minds of people, and with his good words,
(mixed with blasphemies) and fair speeches, to deceive the hearts of the
simple, as his Predecessors have done in the long night of Apostasy, which has
been over all Nations since the Apostles days. But its in vain for him to
strive to accomplish his end, for the Day is dawned unto many, and there is an
eye opened in many thousands in this Nation of England, that gives them to see
over, and beyond all this Babylonish or confused trumpery, and stuff, and have
a feeling of that which was before Babylon was, and shall out-last Babylon, to
the praise of God, and to the glory and honor of his Name, who is blessed for
ever. Well,

Although it was so, that Christ said unto his Disciples, You know not what
spirit ye are of, yet consider the time when he spoke these words; was it not
before they were born of the Spirit? (although called to be Apostles) for
Christ said unto them, you must be born again, John. 3.7, 8. and that he would
send them the Spirit (of which he said they must be born) which shall lead them
into all Truth, John 16.13. and he did not say, as A. S. does, that they should
not know whence (from God or the Devil) the Spirit came, or whither (to Heaven
or to Hell) it went: Oh, horrid blasphemy in A. S! who says, so is every one
that is born of the Spirit; as much as to say, that he that is born of the
Spirits knows not whether he be from God, or the Devil; or whither he shall go,
to Heaven or to Hell: Oh, wickedness indeed! Christ said no such things, as A.
S. does, although that blessed worthy saying of our Savior and Lord Christ,
was, and is very true, (viz.) Marvel not that I say unto you, that you must be
born again; for the wind blows where it lists, and men hears the sound
thereof, but cannot tell from whence it comes, nor whither it goes; adding,
even so is every one that is born of the Spirit, John 3.7, 8. (Mark) they that
were born of the Spirit, were unknown to the World; for said the Apostle (after
they were born again) the World knows us not. So, although they were in the
World, and men saw them, yet the World knew them not, no more than they knew
from whence the wind came, and wither it went, which they heard the sound of;
and indeed so is the state of the True Church in the World at this day.

And the Apostles did know from whence the Spirit came, and of what Spirit they
were, after they received the Spirit of Truth, and were born of it, for Christ
told them, John 14.16. That he would Pray the Father, and he should send them
the Holy Ghost, the Conforter, John 16.7, 13. Which should ABIDE with them for
ever; and they did receive it, and were led by it into a Heavenly Habitation,
Ephesians. 1.3. For they were made to sit together in Heavenly Places in Christ
Jesus: So its hereby clear, that the Apostles knew from whence the Spirit came,
and whither it led them; and its also plain, that A. S. either wilfully or
sottishly wrests the Words of Christ, and by his additious to them, would make
them import another thing, than was intended by him, of purpose to divert
People from being led by the Spirit of God, or to dissuade them from adhering
to the leadings of it, under pretense that they cannot tell whence, (from God
or the Devil) it does come, or whither (to Heaven or to Hell) it goes, when
indeed Christ's words in themselves imports quite another thing, as above
showed.

Wherefore let all mind and obey the Spirit of Truth, which will lead into all
Truth, and condemn sin in the Flesh, and will lead out of all Unrighteousness,
and Errors, and Heresies, which the Church of Rome is full of, and that Spirit
which condemns the Abominations of the Whore, and all Sin and Unrighteousness,
that is the Spirit of God, and comes from God, through the Son of his love, who
is the Light of the World, that lights every man that comes into the World,
and leads up unto God the Father, from whence it comes, all who are Taught
and Guided by it; but condemns from God all who in Unbelief, or in Rebellion
do dispight unto it, and disobey the Motions thereof.

But to return to the matter concerning the Churches being Judge.

First, I find A. S. in the beginning of his seventh chapter saying, Methinks I
hear a Quaker whispering, The Light that is in thee is the Judge of all
Controversies, and the Law and Rule according to which thou must walk.

Answ. I answer, Yea, The People called Quakers do believe and say, That the
Light which every man is enlightened with, is the Law and Rule according to
which every man ought to walk, and is the Judge in all Controversies in Matters
of Faith; for (as before) All Judgment is committed unto the Son, Joh. 5.22.
Who lights every man that comes into the World; so all Judgment being
committed to the Light, that lights every man, the Light that is in every man
must of necessity be the Judge of all Controversies: And this I further add,
That all who are Baptized into Christ, has put on Christ, and all who are by
one Spirit Baptized into one Body, (though they were sometimes Darkness) are
made Light in the Lord, and so they being in him, and he in them, are all one,
even as Christ and the Father is one, and he that sanctifies, and they that
are Sanctified, are all of one; by which its clear, that Christ in his Church,
who is Light with him, is the only Judge of all Controversies: and indeed this
supernatural Light is the true Touchstone, by which all spitits may be tried,
whether they be of God, or not; for, as the Apostle said, Whatsoever makes
manifest, is light, Ephesians 5.13. so that without this Touchstone, none can
try spirits, because an evil spirit may speak good words.

Again, Christ is in all things to be the Example of all Believers; and he
lights every man that comes into the World, John 1.9. so every man being
enlightened with the light of his Spirit, who is to be our example in all
things, it must of necessity be, that the Light that is in us is this Judge,
and the Law and Rule according to which all ought to walk.

Secondly, But then A. S. replies, That the Light that is in thee tells thee,
that thou must hear Christ, and Christ tells thee, that thou must hear the
Church, etc.

Answ. I answer, Yea, the Light that is in us teaches us to hear Christ, who
has enlightened us, and also to hear his Church, with whom he dwells, and that
hears him, and in whom his Spirit speaks; so, as I said before, I shall not go
about to deny the Authority of the True Church; but the usurped authority of
the Church of Rome I do deny; usurped, I say, because she has been, and here
is, sufficiently proved not to be the true Church (to whom Christ gives power
and authority both to bind and to loose) therefore her authority if usurped,
and she is not to be heard, but to be turned away from.

Thirdly, A. S. says, If you object, that the Spiritual judges all things;
and the Spiritual is judged of no man. I answer, that the godly Spiritual
judges all things, etc. But I deny that you, or any other Sectaries in the
World, is Godly Spiritual, for, as St. Augustine says, they have not the Holy
Ghost that are out of the Church.

Reply, To which I say, that as A. S. has confessed, That the spiritual man
judges all things, its according to my own belief; but what does this avail
the Church of Rome, who as I have proved is not godly spiritual; but is sensual
and devilish, and is not the true Church, but the Whore; for although, as he
says, The godly spiritual is judged of none; yet the Whore is judged of all
who are godly spiritual; and although A.S. denies, that the Quakers are godly
spiritual, yet he is never able to prove his affirmation; for though they have
not the holy Ghost who are out of the Church; yet it does not follow, that they
have it not who are out of the Church of Rome, except she could be proved to be
the true Church.

The contrary whereof I have already proved; for the people called Quakers
(though they are out of the Church of Rome) are led by that Spirit which
teaches them to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World, as
thousands of their Neighbors can bear witness; therefore the people called
Quakers are godly Spiritual.

Again, That Prophet which is of God is godly spiritual, Jer. 28.9. and that
Prophet which speaks a thing, and the thing come to pass, that Prophet is of
God; But the people called Quakers have prophesied several things, as to the
late overturned Powers of this Nation Witness the Book Entitled, Good Counsel
and Advice Rejected.
(with diverse other things) which accordingly came to pass, (as to their sorrow
they were made to know) therefore they are of God, and godly spiritual.

Fourthly, A. S. again said, If you say, Know ye not your selves, how that
Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates, 2. Cor. 13.5.

I answer, The true sense and meaning of this place is this, etc So here A. S.
is again undertaking that which himself says is the Churches work; for says
he in his eighth Chapter, the Church is the alone Interpreter of all
Scriptures; and yet he himself, who is but a particular man, is here
undertaking to give an interpretation or meaning, to the forementioned
Scripture, by which it is plain, that he condemns himself in the things he is
doing?

5. Again Fifthly, he says, That the Spirit of God says, Hear the Church, but
the spirit of the Devil contradicts, and says, Hear not the Church, but Christ
alone; for of Christ, says he, its written, This is my beloved Son, him hear
ye: behold the Devil pleads for Christ, of purpose to deceive Christions, etc.

Answ. To which I answer, That I think I need not say much to convince all that
reads but A. S. his own words, that he is either grossly ignorant, or else
abominably wilful and wicked; for who can believe that the Devil will plead for
Christ, or persuade people to hear Christ, and dissuade them from hearing of
the Church? certainly, if he would persuade people to hear the greater, he
would not dissuade them from hearing the lesser: And how can people possibly be
deceived, that hears Christ and obeys him? I cannot believe that its the spirit
of the Devil that persuades people to hear Christ, but rather, that its the
drawings of the Spirit of the Father, that invites them to come unto the Son,
and to hear him, for Christ said, None comes unto me, except my Father, who
has sent me draw him, Joh. 6.44.

But A. S. contrariwise (in effect) says, That the Devil draws people to come
unto Christ, and to hear him; By which he has manifestly showed, that he is of
a contrary spirit unto Christ; Therefore A. S. is an Antichrist, and one that
puts Light for darkness, and darkness for light; against whom the woe is
pronounced, Isa. 5.20. And although A. S. so much pleads for the Church (whom I
know all will hear, that hears Christ) yet upon serious consideration, I find
its of purpose to deceive Christians, and so he has showed himself as bad as
the Devil he speaks of, being found doing the same work, of which he seems to
accuse the Devil; for in his sixth Chapter I find him (as before declared) in
effect persuading people, Not to adhere to the motions of the Spirit of Christ,
under pretense that they cannot tell whence (from God or the Devil) it comes,
or whither to (Heaven or Hell) it goes, etc. And as above, he is again
persuading people, That its a dangerous thing to hear that Spirit that invites
them to hear Christ; calling it the Devil, because it does not invite them to
hear the Church of Rome also. But I never read or heard before, that any spirit
did invite people to hear Christ, but the Spirit of the Father; and his Spirit
said, This is my beloved Son, him hear ye, Mat. 17.5. Therefore that Spirit
that invites people to hear the Son of God, is not the Devil, but the Spirit of
the Father, and ought to be heard and obeyed by all.

Sixthly, Again, S. A. affirms, that the Spirit of God says, That Carpenters,
Smiths, Masons, and other Tradesmen, must not meddle with Ecclesiastical
things, as to Preach, or Teach, etc. But, says he, the evil spirit affirms
the quite contrary, by persuading them they may all prophecy one by one. But
alas then, says, A. S. He deceives, for that place is understood of the real
and True Prophets, of whose number all the Devils in Hell cannot prove all
Tradesmen to be.

Answ. Here A. S. seems to oppose that, which for my part I know none affirms;
for who is there that says all Tradesmen have the Spirit of Prophecy? I know
none. Yet although all Tradesmen have it not, it does not therefore follow that
no Tradesmen have it; neither did I ever read, that the Spirit of God did
forbid Tradesmen to meddle with those things, nor does that Scripture which A.
S. quotes confirm any such thing which he affirms, but rather the contrary:
And we do read in the Scriptures of Truth, that Christ did call some of several
Tradesmen to Teach the Way of God, and to Preach the everlasting Gospel;
witness St Peter a Fisherman, St Paul a Tent-maker, with diverse others that
might be mentioned; so that though all Tradesmen have not the Spirit of
Prophecy, yet we see that some had, and they were not forbidden, but commanded
to Preach and Teach; and therefore they who have the Testimony of Jesus, which
is the Spirit of Prophecy (although they be Tradesmen) they may Preach and
Teach according to the Gift thereof received; for the Apostle said, Every one
as he has received the Gift of the Spirit, so let him administer, 1 Pet. 4.10.

Seventhly, And says A. S. the Apostle said, Women must not speak in the
Church; but the Devil says they may. For the Scripture averreth, says he,
That your Sons and Daughters shall Prophecy; this Devil deceives the
Women-Quakers. But alas, that Scripture was fulfilled in the Apostles, and in
the true Prophetesses in their times, as Anna, Luke 2.28. and now is in such as
have the True Spirit of Prophecy, which Quakers Wives and Daughters can never
prove themselves to have.

Answ. Here A. S. has confessed that there was Prophetesses in the Apostles
days, and that there now is at this day also; and the Apostle spoke of Women
that were helpers with him in the Gospel, Phil. 4.3. So then its undeniable
that Women did speak and Prophecy, and now may; though the Apostles did not
Permit Busybodies and Tattlers, to be asking Questions in the Church, but
said they should ask their Husbands at Home.

So the thing disputable is, whether or no Quakers Wives and Daughters have the
true Spirit of Prophecy? concerning which I say this, The Testimony of Jesus
is the Spirit of Prophecy, and many Wives and Daughters of the people called
Quakers, have received the Testimony of Jesus, and knows the Life of Jesus
manifested in them, as by their fruits of Love, Meekness, Gentleness, Patience,
Long-suffering, etc. (which are fruits of the Spirit) does appear unto those
who have a knowledge of them; Therefore they have the Spirit of Prophecy.

And further, several of the Wives and Daughters amongst the people called
Quakers, have Prophesied of the desolation of the great Whore (the Church of
Rome) and when that comes to pass, it will be thereby proved, that they have
the true Spirit of Prophecy; and then shall every Tongue confess to it, and in
the mean time let none speak evil of the things they know not, lest they be
found fighters against God.

Eighthly, Again, A. S. says, That the good Spirit says, It is a Religious Act
to Swear by God in a Just Cause; but the Evil-spirit contradicts; for its
written, says he, [Sware not at all.] Behold the Puritanism of this impure
spirit; but alas, he deludeth; for God expressly commands, Jer. 4.2. Thou shall
Swear the Lord lives in Truth, in Judgment, and in justice, etc.

Answ. I answer, although in the Law and Prophets, people were commanded to
Swear in Truth and Righteousness, and to perform their Oaths to the Lord; yet
Christ (the new Covenant, whom God promised should not be according to the old)
says Swear not at all, Jer. 31.31, 32. and though Moses and the Prophets were
to be heard, under the ministration of the first Covenant, yet they said when
Christ the second Covenant was come, people must hear him; for said Moses, a
Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you like unto me, him shall ye
hear, Deuteronomy. 18.15. And the Prophet said, that Nation and people that will not
serve thee, that Nation shall perish, Isa. 60.12. So that although Moses said
thou shall perform thy Oath to the Lord, yet Christ that Prophet who is the end
of that Law, (and whom Moses said the people must hear, or else be cut off) he
said Swear not at all; and although the Prophet said, thou shall Swear the Lord
lives, etc. yet Christ who is the end of the Prophets (and whom the Prophets
said people must serve, or else perish, says, Swear not at all; and although
it may be alleged that the Angels swore, yet Christ the first born amongst
many Brethren (to whom all the Angels must bow) says, Swear not at all, and
although it may be further alleged, that God himself swore, and therefore its
lawful for Christians to Swear, yet God himself said, concerning Christ, This
is my beloved Son, hear ye him, Mat. 17.5. And this beloved Son of God, (whom
all Christians ought to hear) says, Swear not at all. All which being rightly
weighed, and considered, it plainly appears, that Swearing by any Oath
whatsoever, was forbidden by Christ Jesus, who is the Lawgiver unto all
Christians, and therefore it is not lawful for Christians to Swear at all: And
that spirit that tollerates Swearing or would set it up, as a Religious Act, is
an Antichrist spirit, because it is against the command of Christ.

And although the Apostle might, or did call the Lord to witness concerning the
Truth which he spoke, yet that does not prove that the Apostle swore, as A. S.
affirms that he did, neither do we read that ever any of the Apostles did
either propagate, or tolerate Swearing, since Christ forbid it; But
contrariwise the Apostle James says, Above all things my Brethren, Swear not;
neither by Heaven, nor by the Earth, neither by any other Oath; but let your
yea be yea, and your nay, nay, lest you fall into condemnation: So that
although A. S. would wrest the words of Christ to persuade people that his
intent was they should not Swear but in Truth and in Righteousness, yet the
words of Christ and the Apostle (whom all true Christians are to hear) does
clearly import that their intent was, that people should not Swear at all by
any Oath whatsoever: But this Antichristian spirit which opposes the Doctrines
and Commands of Christ and his Apostles, we have had large experience of, and
we have ofttimes seen that it leads people to swear, and also to forswear
themselves, both which are an Abomination to the Lord, and in the Transgression
against God and the new Covenant.

Ninthly, and A. S. says, the Apostle, said salute one another, but the Devil
says, salute not one another, for Christ says, he sending his Disciples, bid
them salute no man by the way, Luke 10.4. this Devil follows all Quakers, but
alas, Christ's meaning there was, that none should hinder them by the way, etc.

Answ. To which I answer here again A. S. goes about to make us believe, that
the Commands of Christ are the Impositions of the Devil, or at lest that the
Devil stirs up people to keep the Commands of Christ; the first of which is
Blasphemy in the highest degree, and the second is little less: for if the
Devil would teach people to keep the Commands of Christ, then might they serve
Christ and Belial: but as Christ said, that cannot be. And indeed we do
experimentally see and find, that the Devil always opposes the keeping of
Christ's Commands: As now in A.S. Who would diswade them from it, under pretense
that its the Devil that leads them to it: And as to his saying, this Devil
follows all Quakers.

I answer, Its true; but alas its intentionally to destroy them; for it was
said to the Serpent in the beginning, that the Seed of the Woman should bruise
his Head, and he should bruise its Heel, Genesis 3.15. And even so its now come to
pass, for the Lord Jesus Christ the promised Seed, Gal 3.16. being become the
Leader of his people, and the Angel of Gods present going before them, the
Devil, as A. S. says, comes after them, and follows them with his fiery darts
of persecution, and Serpent-like is snarling at the Heel: But blessed be the
Lord, he that goes before them, and is in them, is greater and mightier then
the Devil that follows them, and he has been their Preserver hitherto, and I
doubt not, but he will unto the end perserve all who trust in him.

And as concerning Christ's words, there needs no meaning to be given to them,
for he meant as he spoke, but if they did according to A. S's own conclusion,
he is not the Interpreter, but the Church; Therefore (A.S. being not the
Church, but a particular man) according to his own Argument, his interpretation
is not to be heeded. Again he says, Every man is not the Interpreter, for
says he, Every man is a Liar: And indeed he has conformed unto us, that
himself is a Liar, because he has belyed the intent of Christ's words
aforesaid, by giving his meaning to them.

Then says A. S. Yet these deluded Souls think that this their deluding Spirit
is of God; and why forsooth, because it reprehends them of sin, etc. and did
not Judas his spirit rebuke him of sin, and notwithstanding induce him to
desperation, and to hang himself.

Answ. Here A. S. is again putting Light for darkness, or calling the Spirit of
Truth a deluding Spirit; for is not that the Spirit of Truth that reproves the
World of sin, John 16.7, 8. Did not Christ say, that he would send the
Comforter, that should reprove the World of sin, and we never read of any other
Spirit that did reprove sin, but the Spirit of Truth, which A. S.
(blasphemously) calls a deluding Spirit; neither did I ever read, that a
deluding Spirit was the Comforter, which that Spirit that reproves for sin is,
as Christ said. And again, is it not clear that A. S. puts Light for darkness,
in calling that a deluding Spirit, which reproves sin; for the Apostle said,
that whatsoever things are reproved, are made manifest by the Light, for
whatsoever makes manifest is Light, Ephesians. 5.13. and the deluding spirit is
darkness it self; so that hereby it manifestly appears, that A. S. cannot
discern betwixt Light and darkness, so is a miserable Blind-Guide indeed. And
though the Spirit of Truth did rebuke Judas for his treachery, does it
therefore follow that it was the same that led him to hang himself; no, this is
great Ignorance in A. S. to affirm; for he might as well have said, That the
same Spirit that led him to betray his Master, did afterward rebuke him for
it; but then his Ignorance would have somewhat more plainly appeared: But it
was indeed the same spirit which led Judas into that presumptuous act, as to
betray his Master, that afterward led him to desperation, and to hang himself;
and that Spirit which let him see his wickedness which he had done, and rebuked
him for it, was Light; For whatsoever makes manifest is Light, Ephesians. 5.13.

Eleventhly, then lastly he says, Thus far have we digressed for the
Conversion of Quakers, etc

Answ. To which I say, that if he has no better way to convert Quakers, nor no
better Arguments to produce in order to their Conversion, then what he has
made use of in his pretended reconsiler of Religions, he were better be silent
and save his Labor, for I cannot believe that a thousand such Books will ever
convert (or rather divert) one Quaker, nay, nor convince them neither, except
it be of his own gross Ignorance or wilful wickedness, of which there is enough
appears, as before manifested.

Thus having briefly answered the most remarkable Arguments produced by A. S.
to prove the Church of Rome, the true Church, and also the several particulars,
by which he endeavored to render the people called Quakers, as a people led by
a deluding Spirit: I find the rest of his Book consists of diverse Arguments, in
which he controverts with Sectaries, and their Bibles, and Ministers, etc.
whose cause (as aforesaid) I am not engaged in, therefore it does not concern
me to answer his Charges against them, but shall leave them to answer for
themselves.

Although there are indeed many things contained in the remaining part of his
Book, from which I might lay open much of the deceit and Ignorance of A. S. and
the Abominations of the Church of Rome; But the generality of people being
alreadly so fully satisfied concerning her: and the confusion and ignorance of
A. S. also being herein so fully manifested already; I look upon it as
superfluous at present to enlarge on this account; and indeed if never a word
had been said, the very fruits brought forth by the Church of Rome in the view
of all Nations, are enough to foreware them of adhering to her, for can a man
touch Pitch and not be defiled.

A hint toward the discovery of the true Church.
But for all that has been said, It may be some will say, that grand Question
propounded by A. S. in the second Chapter of his Book, Remains yet unanswered;
(viz) Which is the true Church, etc.

First, to which I answer; that is the true Church, (and no other (whose fruits
make manifest that they are governed by the invisible head Christ, and that
continue in the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, and that are found in the
same order, or discipline in their Assemblies, that the true Church was in the
primitive times; and that have the same way of ordaining Ministers, that the
true Church had; and that lives soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
present World, as the true Church did; But the people called Quaekers are such
as hereafter I shall prove; Therefore the people called Quakers are the true
Church.

Secondly, It is manifest by the fruits of the people called Quakers, that they
are governed by the invisible Head Christ; for Christ commands his Followers,
not to swear at all, which command the aforesaid people observe and keep, as
this Nation of England full well knows.

Again, Christ came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them; and commanded
his Followers to love their Enemies; And it is manifest that the people called
Quakers have the mind of Christ because they seek not the destruction of any,
but the preservation and good of all, and that they love even their Enemies,
who hate, and persecute them; because they are ready to assist, or be helpful
to them upon all occasions, or opportunities, in any thing that may tend to
their present and future well-being; therefore, they are governed by the
invisible Head Christ: Again, Christ commanded saying, whatsoever ye would that
men should do unto you, even so do ye unto them, Mat. 7.12. which command the
aforesaid people observe and keep, as thousands can bear witness for them;
Therefore they are governed by the invisible Head Christ, and are the True
Church.

Thirdly, Again the people called Quakers continue in the Doctrine of Christ
and his Apostles; for Christ preached the Doctrine of Perfection, saying, Be ye
perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect, Math. 5.48. And the Apostle
preached the same Doctrine: Heb. 6.1. and Labored to persent every man perfect
in Christ, Col. 1.28. having received gifts for that very work, Ephesians. 4.11.12.
And the people called Quakers do preach the same Doctrine of Perfection, and
Labor in the Power and Spirit of the Lord, to present people perfect in
Christ, as the Apostles did, as thousands can bear Testimony; by which it
sufficiently appears, that they continue in the Doctrine of Christ, and his
Apostles; and therefore they are the true Church.

But this Christian Doctrine is opposed by all the Antichristian Ministers
thoughout the whole Christendom, or by all Babylons Merchants in every part of
her Teritories, who ignorantly produce many good words to oppose this Doctrine.

1. As First, they urge Solomon's words (viz) There is not a just man upon the
Earth that does good, and sins not; Therefore say they, people cannot be
perfect; But alas, they do not discern the signs of the times, neither do they
consider the time and season when these words were spoken; for at that time all
were gone out of the Way, and there was none that did good, Psa. 14.3. and they
had forsaken the Lord, and knew not so much of him, as the Ox did of his
Owner, Isa. 1.3. and were in the transgression of Gods Covenant which he made
with their Fathers, Jer. 31.32. so that although there were none without sin at
that time; yet it does not follow the people can never be free from sin, no
more then their being then ignorant of God, does argue, that people should
never come to the knowledge of him; the contrary of both which may be easily
proved by plain Scripture; for at that time when Israel were strangers unto
God, and were all gone out of the way, and none amongst them did good, etc.
even then did God promise that the day should come in which he would make a new
Covenant with the house of Judah, and with the house of Israel, (who were in
the transgression, of the first Covenant Jer. 31.31.) and that he would finish
transgression, and make an end of sin, Dan. 24. who had hid his face from them
(and by which they were made Strangers to him, Isa. 59.2.) and that he would
remember their Iniquities no more, and that they should all know him from the
least, to the greatest, Jer. 31.34. by which it is evident, that (although in
the Prophets days, they were all in transgression, and had not the Knowledge of
God) the purpose of God was to bring them into a better state, which the true
Church in the Apostles days were Witnesses of, (for the Apostles said, Heb.
11.46. God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us could
not be made perfect,) and although some of them had been Idolators, and had
lived in the pollutions of the World, yet they were washed and cleansed, yea,
and justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1
Cor. 6.10, 11. and so though they were sometimes ignorant of God, yet God
caused the Light to shine out of darkness in their hearts, to give them the
Light of the Knowledge of Gods Glory in the face of Christ, who dwelt in them,
2 Cor. 4.6. Gal. 2.20. so that both sin and ignorance, was done away in them
though the power and coming of the Lord Jesus, and so they did not always
remain in their sin, but were freed from them, as the Apostle testified, Romans
18. and 1.2.

Secondly, But then Antichrist's Mimisters says, That if they were free from
sin, why did the Apostle say; That if we say we have no sin, we deceive our
selves and the Truth is not in us, 1 John. 1.8.

I Answer he did not say so because people could not be made free from sin, but
he said so that they might not sin, 1 John. 2.1. and consider who they were
that he then wrote to; for he sometimes wrote to Children, and sometimes to
Young Men, and sometimes to Fathers in the truth, 1 John 2.13. But when be
spoke those words (viz*) If we say we have no sin, etc. he then spoke to
Children; for said he, my little Children, these things I write unto you, that
you sin not, 1 John 2.1. Now if they had been already perfect, or fully fully
freed from sin, then had they attained to the man's state, which the Apostle
labored to bring them to, Col. 1.28. But they having not attained to that
state, he would not have them to deceive themselves, (nor to think more highly
of themselves then they ought to think, Romans 12.3.) which Children in
understanding are subject to do, but with these little Children the Apostle
Traveled in birth, that Christ might be formed in them, Gal. 4.19. (who is the
one offering that perfects for ever, all them that are sanctified, Heb. 10.14.)
and he labored to build them up in the holy Faith which gives Victory through
Christ, that so they might be borne up to a man's state, for said He, he that is
born of God does not sin, John 3.9.

Thirdly, But then, it may be some will object, that the Apostle spoke not only
of Children, but of himself also, saying, If we say, etc.

To which I Answer, that although the Apostle numbered himself with them, yet
that does not argue, that he was in their state, or that he was not set free
from sin, no more then James his numbering himself amongst the scattered Jews,
(saying, with the same mouth curse we men etc. Jam. 1.9) does argue that he was
one of them that did curse men, for its evident that the Apostle became as
weak, to them that were weak, and to the strong, as strong, and to them that
were under the Law, as under the Law, and to them that were without the Law, as
without the Law, though not without Law to God, and became all things unto all,
that he thereby might gain some; 1 Cor. 9.20, 21, 22. so although he did
condescend to them that were weak, as Children or Babes in Christ, as to number
himself amongst them, for the gaining of them to a farther state, yet that does
not at all argue, that he was, as they were, for the Apostle Paul himself said,
that he was set free from the Law of sin and death, Romans 8.2. all which being
rightly weighed, it manifestly appears, that perfection or freedom from sin, is
attainable according to the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, which by the
people called Quakers is preached and continued in, as before asserted,
therefore they are the true Church.

4. Again, The Order and Discipline of the true Church in the Apostles time,
was, That the Prophets might speak two or three, and the rest might judge; and
if any thing was revealed to another that sat by, he might speak, and the
first was to hold his peace, 1 Cor. 14.29, 30. and the same order the people
called Quakers have in their Assemblies, as is known to thousands, by which it
appears that they are the true Church.

5. Again, The Ministers of Christ in the true Church in the primitive times
(who turned people from darkness to light, and from Satan's power, to the Power
of God, Gal. 1.1.) were Ordained and made Ministers, not of man, nor by man,
nor of the letter, but of the Spirit, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor.
3.6. and so are the Ministers amongst the people called Quakers, made Ministers
of the Spirit, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, as the effects of their
ministry does testify; for many are turned from darkness to light, and from
iniquity to righteousness, and the spirits in Prison is by them ministered unto,
and the dead are raised unto life, and the Captives are set at Liberty, as
thousands can and must bear witness; Therefore the people called Quakers are
the true Church.

Sixthly, The true Church in the primitive times, was taught by the Grace of
God, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, they should live soberly and
righteously, and goodly in this present World, Tit. 2.11, 12. and the people
called Quakers, being taught by the same spirit of Grace, do deny ungodliness,
and wordly lusts (as many in this Nation well knows) and does live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world, as thousands can testify;
Therefore the people called Quakers are the true Church.

Thus I might produce many more Arguments to prove the aforesaid people to be
the Church of true Christians, but much of this kind has been by several of
them already written; wherefore, I shall not enlarge at present; but for any
that shall desire any farther satisfaction, let them come to the Assemblies of
the aforesaid people, and hear their Doctrines, and behold their Discipline,
etc. and, as the Apostle said, Try all things, and hold fast that which is
good, 1 Thessalonians. 5.21.

These following Lines are sent to all Sectaries (in Christendom, who have been
killing and destroying one another about Faith and Worship) but especially to
the Church of ROME.
O Babylon the Great, who long have reigned a Painted Whore:
And have Bewitch't the Nations with thy Enchanting Power.
Into Remembrance thou art come of God the Mighty Lord,
Who Will do to thee as thou have done: the Saints with one accord
Have bent their Bows against thee; strong and mighty men they are:
They will not spare nor pity thee, in this day o'th Lambs War;
For it is the day of vengeance great, of our Almighty God,
He Will do to thee as thou have done, thou cannot escape his Rod.
The holy Prophets in their day, foretold these things of thee,
Which to our consolation, we hope to live and see;
For Jeremiah he foresaw, thy desolation great,
And said an Army great should come, that should give thee defeat;
Out of the North the Prophet said, they should come against thee, Jer. 50.9.
(Even as it now is come to pass) before whom thou must flee.
The seven heads, or mountains great, on which thou long have sat,
Must now be turned upside down, and made to reele and quake;
For now the Lion he does roar, and utter forth his voice,
At which the mountains great must move, and fly away at's noise, Isa. 42.14,
15.
Yea, vacant, waste, and desolate, those mountains must be laid.
And be no more inhabited, for so it has been said;
Thy Merchants many have enricht themselves, and made them great.
And Ruled with Force and Cruelty, False-prophet like indeed.
Wherefore Lament and Howl they must, and mourn both great and small,
And cry, alas, alas, for now is come thy sudden fall:
For the day is dawned which John foresaw (and Prophesied of thee)
In which he said, and testified, thy total fall should be.
Though thou have sitten in thy pride, like as a stately Queen,
And said within thy heart and mind, Thine end should not be seen;
Though thou have drunk the blood of Saints, and glorified thy self,
And said, Thou should no sorrow see, nor ever loose thy Wealth,
Yet woe and sorrow, great and sore, will swiftly thee surprise,
And all thy expectations, will fail before thine eyes.
When Death and Famine comes on thee, with mourning great and sore,
This will predict thine end to thee, who never shall rise more;
And truly thy divisions great, predicts thy sudden fall,
The more, because thou have refused to hear the heavenly call;
For in thy Streets the voice has cried, Repent and fear the Lord,
And turn from your Idolatries, serve God with one accord;
But like the Adder thou have been, that is deaf and will not hear,
The Charmer, who has charmed long, so thou have stopped thine ear:
Why do not mind the Words of Christ, who spoke and said himself,
The Kingdom cannot stand that is divided against it self?
And is not thy divisions great, Oh Babylon thou Whore!
Which does foretell thy total end, and thou shall be no more.
The cause which does provoke the Lord, to pour his Judgments great
On thee, is thy deceit and Pride, and Murders which are great,
And also thy Idolatries, and Whoredoms which are many,
This does provoke the Lord to Wrath, and's anger will not tarry:
Wherefore look for it, and expect that it will surely come,
For God has said it, and it must accordingly be done.
Written in Bridewel, near Lancston in Cornwall, the 11th Month. 1664. J. C.

Here follows the Papists 14th Chapter concerning the Protestants, or Sectarian
Ministers, published for them to Answer. That the Protestant, or Sectarian
Minister or Preachers, are not True Preachers, or sent by God.
1. ALl that have no true Mission, are not true Preachers; How shall they
Preach unless they are sent? Romans 10.15. But Protestant, or Sectarian Ministers
and Preachers have no true Mission: For all their Mission, from the beginning
of their Reformation, was either the Inspiration of a Spirit they knew not
what, or the Commission of a Child, Edward the Sixth, whom they called Supreme
Head of the Church, and from whose Kingly power, all Jurisdiction, as well
Ecclesiastical as Secular, they affirm did flow. See Fox tom. 2. Anno, 1546. in
Edw. the 6th, or the Letters Patents of a Woman, Queen Eliz. to whom also they
were pleased to attribute the like Superiority and Power. See. Stat. Anno primo
Eliz. Cap. 1. or the Ilisit and invallid Ordination or Mission of or by one
Story, an Apostate Monk, who Ordained their first Bishops at the Nags-Head in
Cheapside, in Queen Elizabeth's time: See Christophorus de Sacro Bosco, or at
length the Approbation of Tryers, Instituted by his late Highness (forsooth)
and Confirmed by Act of Parliament (if they have any better let them prove it,
in the mean time let them know, we value not a straw Mason's Old New Records
produced in the year 1613. which was the matter of fifty years after the thing
now mentioned was Sacrilegiously and invalidly done, and most disgracefully and
shamefully cried down) But those could not give them any spiritual Authority,
Power, or Right to Preach, for according to that received Maxim of the Law, No
man can give more right, then he himself has, Cook. Lib. 4. Therefore, etc.

2. Moreover, a Bishop is to be ordained by two or three Bishops, Consil.
Apostil. Can. 1. And a Priest, and likewise a Deacon, and the rest of the
Clergy, by a Bishop, ibidem Can. 2. Con. Triden. Sess. 23. Can. 7. But this
Apostolical and needful manner of Ordination, or Mission, they never yet had;
for they rejected it quite, and brought in an Heretical fashion in its stead,
in Edward the Sixth's time; neither if they were willing, could they have, for,
as I said before, their Bishops from the beginning of their Reformation, had no
other Ordination, Consecration, or Mission, then the Commission of the King or
Queen; nor yet that, but during the King or Queens pleasure: For the
sacrilegious, Ilicit, or Invalid Ordination of or by Story (which was the first
pretended holy Mission of Protestants in England, and from whence they hitherto
derive their Orders) it was not worth a Straw, witness the aforementioned
Canons of the Apostolic Council, etc. and consequently, their pretended holy
Orders thence derived, are not worth a Pins-head; no more is the Approbation of
Tryers; Therefore they are not true Preachers. What are they then, forsooth?
Intruders, Thieves and Robbers, Hypocrites, Ravenous Wolves, and Murderers,
Sons of Belial, False Prophets, and Priests of Baal. Which is their Heresy?
Rebellion, and Stubbornness against the Church; for Rebellion (as they
themselves, even in their newest Bible confess) is as the sin of Witchcraft,
and Stubbornness, is as Iniquity and Idolatry, 1 Samuel (as they call it) the
25. and 13.

3. Now if the Protestant or Sectarian Preachers and Teachers be such, what
must the Protestants and Sectarians themselves be? If the Light that is in them
be darkness, how great shall the darkness its self be? If the Blind lead the
Blind, shall they not both fall into the Ditch? Sure enough they shall, even
into the Ditch of everlasting Burning, Brimstone and Fire, where shall be
Howling, and Crying, and Weeping, and Lamenting, and gnashing of Teeth forever,
unless they be converted and do Penance, and live in the Church, in which must
always be true Preachers and Teachers, for the Consummation of Saints, to the
work of the Ministry, and edification of the Body of Christ, Ephesians. 4. ver. 5,
and 11. But in the Protestant, or Sectarian Church, are not such, as now
proved, therefore the Protestant Sectarian Church is not the true Church of
true Believers: How shall they believe in him whom (not of whom, as their Bible
says of purpose to excuse themselves. See above) they have not heard, or how
shall they hear without a Preacher, or how shall they Preach, unless they are
sent?

4. Note this well, gentle Reader, and consider seriously with your self, how
deplorable a thing it is to see such Hypocritical Intruders to stand in a
Pulpit or Tub, with such a brazenfac'd Book, as is their unjust, corrupt, and
perverse Bible in their hand, lulling the Poor Ignorant people to the sleep of
death, with these words, Thus says the Lord, when the Lord says no such
thing. Are not these they of whom the Lord himself says, Jer. 14.14. They
prophecy falsely in my Name, I sent them not, and I did not bid them, neither
did I speak unto them; a lying vision, and divination, and fraudulence, and
sedition of their own hearts they prophecy unto you. See more Dent. 13.5. Item
18.20. etc. And when they have done with their, Thus says the Lord, and can
say no more, then they rowse up their slumbering spirits by singing unto them
one of Tho. Sternholds, Jack Hopkins, or Rob. Wisdoms Psalms; suppose, From
Turk and Pope, etc. which Sacrilegious Psalm, or Diabolical Song, passes with
these Deluders, and their deluded Auditors and Chorists, for holy Scripture,
and the Word of God, as well as Dixit Dominus, Domino meo, etc. Oh times, Oh
manner, Oh God amend them, Amen. See Erastus senior and jun. who copiously
prove this Subject.

The Last Testimony OF That Faithful Servant of the Lord, and Minister of Jesus
Christ, RICHARD FARNSWORTH. Whereunto is prefixed a brief Testimony concerning
his Life, Death, and Travels, etc. To which is added a few words of Exhortation
unto those that believe in the Light of the Lamb. Published for the Consolation
of the Household of Faith; and for the stopping of that Mouth which is opened in
Blasphemy against God, his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.
FOrasmuch as it has pleased God Almighty (after the long Night of woeful gross
Darkness, Apostasy and Ignorance, which has been over the Nations, amongst
those who have had a Profession of Christianity) again to make known and
manifest, the true, new, and living way which leads unto Life Eternal, even by
and through the Revelation and Operation of his Eternal Power, and Word of
Life, in the hearts of a Remnant, whom (in this our day) he first reached unto
and visited, and raised up to be Witnesses thereof; that by them it might be
born Testimony unto, amongst those who were strangers to it, and that thirsted
after it, that so thereby they also might receive the manifestation and
knowledge thereof, for want of which many perish, and are strangers to the way
of Life; having only (at best) a Form of godlyness without the Power: In which
dead Forms, or outside empty Professions, some are at ease and rest, as though
they were in the true Heaven that should never pass away, and some are at rest
and at ease without any profession, living in all uncleanness, unrighteousness,
and abomination; and some cannot find rest in either. The faithful and true
Witness of God being awakened in their Hearts and Consciences, which takes the
false peace from them, and lets them see the emptiness of all outside
professions, which are without Life and Power, and also the Abominations, and
vanities of the World, and makes sin exceeding sinful to them: And by this true
and faithful Witness are desires, and breathings, and pantings begotten in
their hearts after the Knowledge of God and Christ, after fellowship and
acquaintance with the Father and the Son; which desire cannot be satisfied
without the Knowledge and enjoyment of the Presence of the Lord, and of the
Light of his Countenance. And for this cause many run to and fro, and wander
like Sheep gone astray from the true Shepherds Fold, and are wearying
themselves upon the barren Mountains, in vain looking thereunto for Salvation,
and seeking the Living amongst the Dead, and so spend their labor for that
which does not satisfy. And in these several states and conditions aforesaid,
the whole Christian World lies, who are not turned to the Light and Spirit of
Jesus in themselves; and true rest and salvation cannot be found by them, until
they return to the Light and Power of the Spirit of God in their own hearts,
which is that whereby a dislike of sin is begotten in them, and also desires
after Life and Salvation; and Freedom from sin is thereby begotten; and that is
it alone which can answer every desire, which is begotten by its self. Well,

But when it pleased the Lord to reveal the Son of his Love, and to make known
his eternal Power (in these latter days) for the rending of the Vail of
Darkness that had long been over the heart, by which he caused the Light to
shine out of Darkness, which gives the Knowledge of his own Glory; he did not
then give the knowledge and manifestation thereof unto all People, but he chose
certain Witnesses, whom he raised up to declare of the manifestation of this
Power, and to preach the Word of Life nigh, in the Heart and in Mouth; and he
furnished them with Armor of Righteousness, and with all spiritual Weapons;
which were mighty through him, to break down the strong holds of Iniquity, and
the spiritual wickednesses that were in the high places; and empowered them as
Instruments in his hand to turn many from Darkness to the Light, that the
Salvation of God they might come to see; and the Work of God greatly prospered
in their hands; and multitudes were brought to the acknowledgment of the Truth,
to the saving of their Souls: and though they met with great opposition, and
persecutions, by the Emissaries of Satan, even in all Quarters where they
came; yet that was not prevalent to hinder the prosperity of that Work
whereunto they were called of God; but it still prospered, and does still
prosper, to the spreading of the unchangeable Truth abroad, even as is seen at
this day.

And of this number whom God Almighty at the first raised up by his Power for
this Work aforesaid, the late deceased Richard Farnsworth was one, concerning
whom the chief occasion of this my present writing is; that so a Testimony
concerning him, and of what the Lord did by, and through him, may remain upon
Record for Generations to come; and that this present Generation of the Just,
may see and hear his last Testimony, which proceeded from his own mouth a
little before his departure out of the body; and I doubt not, but thereby the
Consolation and spiritual Comfort of the Household of Faith will be added unto.

And, for these Causes, I could not well rest satisfied in my spirit without
taking in hand to publish these things; though I well know that there are many
living Witnesses that knew the Life, Labors, and Travels of the said R. F. who
are the Seal of his Ministry: And also the many Writings of his own, which
remain upon Record, will speak forth to those, who are of a true spiritual
understanding, what he was; yet notwithstanding all these things were in my
mind, and diverse other Considerations, which occasioned me to defer the
publication hereof so long as till now; yet being I could not be so clear in my
duty toward God and my Brother, in neglecting to give forth this my Testimony
concerning him, and in suffering so precious a Testimony, as his last was,
wholly to be put in oblivion, I have with freeness and cheerfulness of heart
undertaken it.

And when it pleased God to manifest his Eternal Power in the heart of the
aforesaid R. F. it is well known unto many how effectually it wrought in him;
insomuch, that although he was (before) a man of great abilities, and parts,
and knowledge, accounted of among men, even excelling many of his equals; yet
he was content and willing, in obedience to the Power of God, to become a Fool
to the World, and to be stripped and emptied of his own wisdom and knowledge,
(which stood in the state fallen from God and his Power) and to suffer the loss
of all worldly reputation and favor, and the pleasures and delights thereof,
that he might win Christ Jesus, and be found his Servant, clothed with the
Righteousness of Faith, preferring the simplicity that is in Christ, beyond all
worldly wisdom and honor whatsoever; and his Sufferings for the sake of
Christ, beyond all worldly reputation; and so great was the change that was
wrought it him, that he became a wonder amongst many* and the Word of God and
his Power was great and mighty in him, and through him; in which he was sent
forth by the Lord (who had manifested himself unto him) to preach the
Everlasting Gospel to the Poor, and to declare of that great Power of God, of
which he was made a Witness, and of the Effects of its operation; and so
powerful was his Message and Testimony, that many were begotten into a firm
belief thereof* and believing the Report, were turned from Darkness to the
Light of Jesus, with which they were enlightened, and from Satan's power unto
the Power of God, which wrought mightily in their hearts, to the changing of
their minds and affections from things that are below, toward things that are
above all that is fading and corruptible, and to the bringing of Life and
Immortality to light in them: And although they were atttended with many foul
temptations, because of their obedience to the Truth and Light of the Spirit of
Grace, and brought in many distresses in their passage from Death unto Life,
yet was he so experienced in the Depths and Subtilties of Satan, and also in
the Dealings and Goodness of God in such conditions and estates, that he had
obtained the tongue of the Learned, and could (as often times he did) speak words
in Season, to the strengthening of the weak, and refreshing of the weary; and to
the reviving of that which was near ready to faint: So that he was in the Lords
Hand, even as a Father to the fatherless, and as eyes to the Blind, and feet to
the lame; and the eye that truly saw him, blessed hm; and the ear that heard
him, gave witness unto him* for through the Power of God which enabled him, he
delivered the Poor and the needy, and built up many (that believed) in their
most precious Faith, and confirmed them therein: And went about from place to
place, through the Land of his Nativity, turning many from Darkness to Light,
and confirming the Churches, and doing good: And his Service was very great for
the Lord in his day; for he was so furnished with Heavenly Wisdom and
Understanding through the Grace of God; and also so seasoned thereby, that his
Patience, Meekness, and Humility exceeded many: And although God had so endued
him with Heavenly Virtues and Abilities exceeding many, yet was he not pufft up
therewith, neither sought to exercise Lordship over those that were weaker and
younger then himself, but gave place unto any that had the least Gift of God to
exercise; so that through the Spirit of Meekness and Humility, with which he
was adorned, he was exceeding lovely and beautiful, and the hearts and souls of
many were affected therewith, who in simplicity thirsted after Righteousness,
and such waited for him, as for the Rain, upon whom his Doctrine so dropped:
Yet nevertheless he was terrible to the Worker of Iniquity; and the Sword of
his Mouth was very sharp, for the Word of God was therein; and when he had to
do with any who opposed the Truth and Way of Life and Salvation, which we
profess and walk in (as ofttimes he had) his Weapon was very sharp to them, and
they were not able to resist the Wisdom of the Spirit by which he spoke; for
thereby he confounded their wisdom, and broke their Weapons in pieces; so that
they were often ready to Blaspheme God, because of the plague that it was to
them; and a Conqueror he was over the Beast and false Prophet, against whom he
made War in Righteousness, in and though the Power of the Lamb, in whose Spirit
he finished his Testimony and Course in the Faith.

And as the Enemies of the Truth of God were many, and in diverse shapes, that
this valiant Soldiers of the Lamb had to encounter withal, so he was always
furnished with Armor and Weapons, fit for the Work and Service in which he was
exercised, by which he was enabled to encounter with, and Conquer all: But at
last, that his Armor and Weapons might be proved to be sufficient to encounter
with the Enemy of Truth, in all kind of Appearances and Transformations, it was
his lot with me, and diverse others of the Servants of the Lord, to be engaged
against the Enemy of Truth, who had transformed himself into the likeness of an
Angel of Light, and under a seeming pretense of appearing on the behalf of God
and his Cause, etc. and against Formality and Traditions, begun strongly to
oppose the Truth of God, and the Ministry thereof in and through his Servants
and Messengers (who have approved themselves as the Ministers of God, and as
his Ambassadors) and to cry against our Assemblies and manner of Worship, and
our Exercise therein, (as only Formal;) in which we have always found the
glorious Presence, Power and Majesty of the Lord amongst us, refreshing,
comforting and strengthening of us, even according as our Hearts and Souls, can
or could desire; so that we were engaged to justify the Lord, in opposition to
that gainsaying spirit of delusion, by which many were beguiled and led away
after Satan, to their hurt: And in our Testimony for the Lord, and against that
self-separating gainsaying Spirit, the Power of the Lord did greatly accompany
and assist us, and was as greatly with us, as in any service that he had called
us unto; The sincere and upright in heart (who have kept their first Love, and
their first Faith) are Witnesses of it; and how in Love we labored for the
restoration of those who were beguiled through the craft of the Enemy; and for
the preservation of those who hitherto have escaped his Snare, that is well
known to many witnesses. But if none were sensible of it, the Lord he knows,
and is Witness, that in sincerity of heart (in the Name of the Lord) toward
God and his People we were exercised; and in our Labor and Travel for them,
the Blessings of the Lord and his Peace, and the comfort of his Spirit, did
possess and fill our hearts beyond the understanding of the World, although
many, toward whom we were so in love exercised, could not believe, but some
withstood our Testimony, and kicked against it in their hearts, and resisted
the Counsel of God against themselves, to the grief and sorrow of our hearts.

Therefore it pleased the Lord, in Love, Mercy and good Will to his Servant, my
dear Brother R. F. that his Travels, Burdens, and grievous Sufferings might be
put to an end; and that our testimony for the Lord might be sealed with the
Life of his Servant against that Antichristian intruding Spirit of Opposition,
which labored to intrude its self into the Church, to sit as Ruler and Judge
there, I say, for these causes, and for none contrary hereunto, it pleased God
to visit my dear Brother R. F. and to take him out of the Body; at which, I
perceive, some who are ignorant of what the Lord intended thereby have
rejoiced: But let such know, that they have made a wrong application of the
dealing of the Lord therein; by which they have hardened themselves, instead of
being humbled through that which was ordered of God for their humiliation and
good; and if possible that such may yet see, and turn to the flock of the
Companions of Christ: And also that the flocks who are (and have remained) in
the true Fold may be refreshed thereby, I shall here insert the Last Testimony
of the aforesaid R. F. which was given by him, a very short space before his
departure out of the Body, in the presence of several good Friends at which
time in the Name, Strength, and Power of God, he was moved to sit up in his
Bed, and spoke (concerning the Love of God, and concerning our Testimony
against the aforesaid Antichristian, intruding, factious spirit) with as much
strength, Power and freeness of spirit, as at any time he had done in the time
of his outward health. Whose words were as follows.

Friends, God has been mightily with me, and has stood by me at this time,
and his Power and presence has accompanied me all along, though some think
that I am under a Cloud for something; but God has appeared for the owning of
our Testimony, and has broken in upon me as a flood, and I am filled with his
Love, more than I am able to express; and God is really appeared for us. If God
himself had come down and spoken as a man, he could not have spoke more clearer
to us than he has done, by the many Testimonies from Heaven in his People
concerning this thing. Therefore I beseech you Friends, here of this City of
London, (whether I live or dye) be you faithful to your Testimony which God
has committed to you, and as it arises in your hearts, be faithful to the
Lord therein.

After which he was silent for a little season, and then his Mouth was again
opened in the Name and Power of the Lord, even as before, and he spoke very
preciously unto Friends concerning the things before mentioned, testifying of
the greatness of the Love and Power of God, of which he was made partaker, and
which he then felt; and of the preciousness of the Truth, which he had with us
born witness of; and exhorted them to faithfulness and stedfastness therein,
and to singleness, that nothing might be suffered to creep in of another nature
to intermix therewith, saying, No Linsy-woolsy Garment must be worn, etc. with
much more to that effect, which cannot be remembered. And having thus given his
last Testimony, as a Seal unto all the former Testimonies which he had given
for the Lord, and on his behalf, in about two or three Hours time after, being
filled with the Peace and Love of God beyond declaring, (as himself signified)
he departed this Life, even like a Lamb, and Slept with his Fathers and
Brethren, and is entered into everlasting rest with the Lord.

And this may serve also as a sufficient Testimony, to stop the Mouths of all
who vaunt themselves in his death, as though he had been taken away in Judgment
and Displeasure of the Lord, because of his appearing on the behalf of God
against that Antichristian spirit of opposition, which contends against our
Meetings, and Preaching, and the manner of our exercise in the Worship of God,
as Formal, etc. And let such know, that if his being removed prove a Judgment
unto any, it will be to them, who rejected the Mercies of God by him tendered to
them, and have thereby hardened themselves against the Lord and his Servants,
and have made a wrong application of the dealings of the Lord with his Servant,
even as those who know not the purpose of God therein; and so have showed
themselves not to be the Friends of God, as Abraham was, from whom God did not
hide the thing that he intended; but let such yet repent, if a place can be
found for them.

And so let all my dear friends every where, who believe in the Light of Jesus,
and who have tasted of the Love, Goodness, and Power of God, dwell in the sense
and feeling of his Love and Power, and let nothing divert or turn aside the
minds of any from persevering in that pure holy way of Life, which they are
called to walk in, and in which the daily renewings of the peace and good will
of God is witnessed; neither let any be slack or remiss, in performing that
ancient, godly, Christian practice of Assembling your selves together in the
Name and Fear of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know the exceeding benefit and
advantage that ye have received thereby, because of the Lords Appearance
amongst us, who, acording to his Promise has not failed us unto this day; but
his Name and Power has been great amongst us, and still is, opening the
mysteries of his Kingdom, and revealing of the virtue of his Life in our Hearts
and Souls, by his own Spirit, to our great refreshment and comfort; so that we
have not at any time been sent empty away, who have in sincerity thirsted after
him, and in faithfulness waited for his Appearance; which is sufficient to
encourage all to persevere in that godly practice of meeting together with all
integrity, without wavering. And forasmuch as our assembling together at this
day, is the great thing that the Enemy of Truth strikes at in all his
Instruments of all kinds, in which he appears against us; it behooves all to
stand and be faithful therein; that the Cause of God may not be betrayed by
any, through their declining from that godly Practice and duty, that the Enemy
may not be encouraged thereby to vaunt against the Remnant that are faithful,
to oppose them therein also; but rather, through your faithfulness and
stability, the enemy may be discouraged in his Enterprises, and put to flight,
that you may be Conquerors over him, and may tread Satan under foot, and may
reign with the Lamb for ever.

And my Friends, consider the faithfulness of many of the Servants of the Lord,
who loved not their lives unto death, who are gone before, who preached and
made known the Truth and way of Life to you, how they labored and traveled
amongst you, in the Name and Strength of the Lord, to beget you unto God, and
to build you up in the most precious Faith; and how they exhorted you time
after time to that godly practice, of Assembling together, and how they gave
Example and President therein as well as Exhortation thereunto.

Nay, have not diverse of them laid down their Lives (not counting them dear to
them) for that very Practice of Assembling together? Yea, certainly they have
so; some in Prisons, and some otherwise. Oh therefore my Friends, this Duty of
Assembling together, ought not to be slighted; nay, has not the present
Liberty that we do enjoy, in our meeting together, cost the Lives of many? was
it not with the blood of many (of them that bore the same Testimony which we
bare) that this present Liberty has been purchased? and ought not this Liberty
then to be prized, and made a right Use of; I am jealous with a godly
Jealousy, that all who are concerned, do not rightly weigh, ponder, and
consider these things; but I desire all to consider it, and let not that
Testimony fall (by the negligence of any) which has been sealed with the Lives
of so many of Gods Servants and Messengers, whose Knowledge and Understanding
in the Way and Mysteries of God, was not inferior unto any that are left
behind, and yet they cheerfully offered up their All for that Testimonies sake.

Therefore, my Friends, be diligent and faithful to the Lord, walking in his
Covenant of Life, which will be a true Guide unto you, and an Instructor, and
will keep your Desires fresh toward the Lord, and your Love one toward
another; so that you will be constrained to Come together, and to wait together
upon the Lord, to receive refreshment from his presence, which you will see and
feel in the midst of you, as your hearts are kept in his Fear; and enter not
into consultation with Flesh and Blood, nor into reasonings which will say,
Thou need not go to Meetings, because thy Teacher is present in all places,
and so will draw thee into negligence of meeting with the Children of Light;
for if thou gave heed unto such reasonings, thou will soon find, thy Love will
wax cold toward the People of God, and thou will lose the sense of the
Teachings of the Lord, who is present in all places; for although he be in all
places present, yet has he ordained and appointed, that his People should
Assemble themselves together to wait upon him, and to worship him, and has
given the promise of his Presence unto such that do so. But if any draw back
from answering his requirings, his Soul will have no pleasure in them: and such
will dye as to God, and will become as dry and withered Branches, and their
Love will decay, and wax cold, and they will not have a sight, nor a sense of
the Omnipresence of the Lord, nor of his Teachings, though they may talk of it,
as multitudes do at this day, who are altogether strangers thereunto, further
than by hear say.

And therefore once more I say unto you all, Be faithful to the Lord in your
several measures and stations, where the Lord has set you, and be diligent in
that godly Practice of Assembling your selves together, in which a Testimony
for the Lord is born, which many have laid down their Lives for, and let none
make their blood of no effect, by slighting Meetings, the present Liberty for
which has been purchased through the shedding their blood; but let all meet
together, and being met, wait upon the Lord in faithfulness, that you may feel
the Springs and Fountain of Life opened amongst you, and in the midst of you,
that you may be refreshed and strengthened, and may grow, and be enabled to
encounter with your Souls Enemy in all his appearances, and may put him to
flight, and may tread Satan under foot, and reign as Kings on Earth, and as
Conquerors, to the praise of his Name (who has called you, that he may take
delight to dwell amongst you, and to do you good) who over all is worthy, God
Blessed for evermore,

By a Companion of those who hold the Word of God and Testimony of Jesus
Christ, and suffer for the same, Josiah Coal.

A SONG Of the Judgments and Mercies OF THE LORD: Wherein the things, seen in
Secret, are declared Openly. Being, A Brief Demonstration of the Secret Work of
the Almighty in me his Servant: Given forth at the Movings of the Spirit of the
Lord, and is to go abroad throughout the World, With a Hearty Salutation of
Pure and Unfeigned Love, flowing from the Innocent Life, (...) in a few words)
to all the Soldiers, of the Lambs Army though out the Nations, and also to the
Suffering Seed every where. With a few Words by way of Information unto such
who may have desires in them to know the Way to the Kingdom of Peace and
Righteousness, (which we (...), and are Heirs of through Christ Jesus our Lord)
which to the^ (...) the Visitation of God.
I Will sing of the Judgments, and Mercies of the Lord; and declare his
wondrous Works unto all people; that the Inhabitants of the Earth may hear, and
fear, and reverence the Lord who is holy.

When I walked in the way of the Wicked, and knew not the Path of the Just;
when I lived in Transgression against God, and knew not his holy Law to walk
therein; then oft-times did fear surprise me, and terror seized upon my heart;
for I saw that the way in which I walked, was the way that led to destruction;
then as I considered the way of the World, I saw they were all gone astray, and
though they had a Profession of God, yet acquaintance with him they had not,
neither was he to be found in their Assemblies: Then my Soul languished after
the Knowledge of him, and after the Knowledge of the Way of Life; yet still was
I captivated with vanity, and the deceitfulness of sin stole away my heart: But
the good Spirit of God still strived in me, to come out of the ways of the
World, whose Worships I had long seen to be but as the offering of
Swines-blood; and in my heart I could not join with them, but had a testimony
in me against their ways; and that which they called their Ordinances, I saw
there was nothing of God in it, for they were but as a shadow, vanity and
nothing; but how to come into the Way of Life, to this I was still a stranger,
until the Lord in his Eternal Power sent the Ministers of the Word of Life, who
were anointed of the Lord, and endued with Power from on high, to preach the
glad tidings of the Gospel to the captivated Seed, and to minister to the
spirits that were in prison, whose voice I rejoiced to hear, and whose
Testimony I gladly received, For they declared the Way of Life, that it was in
the midst of the Path of Judgment and the Witness of God in my heart did seal
to the truth (...) their Testimony: and this I saw was the way that the Workers
of Iniquity knew not: For, there is no judgment in their goings: Then my soul
cried unto God for the pourings forth of the Spirit of Judgment, that I might
walk in the paths thereof, and that the filth thereby might be purged away: For
I saw that my heart was polluted, and that there was no Habitation for God;
which caused me to mourn in desolation, and to wander in solitary places: So as
I waited in the Light of his Son, which shined in my Heart and Conscience,
there he revealed his righteous Judgments, and the just rejoiced therein, yea
he brought me into the valley thereof* and there did he plead with me, even by
sword and by fire, etc. He poured the Cup of his fury upon me, and made me
drink of the dregs thereof, yea the Cup of trembling he put into my hand, and
gladly did I receive it, though it was in my belly bitter: he ofttimes sorely
afflicted me, and caused deep sorrow to compass me about, and poured his
indignation upon me: Then said I, I will bear it with patience, because I have
sinned against thee: Yet many times I was strongly assaulted with the violent
rage of the wicked one, for he shot his fiery darts at me, which often wounded
my Soul: Then I cried unto the Lord in my distress, and he comforted me with
his precious promises, which begat a secret hope in me, or else I had fainted
in the tribulation, when his vials of wrath were poured upon me, and the Enemy
came in like a flood: then was I ready to say in my heart, I shall one day fall
by the hand of mine Enemy; yet I was still sustained by a secret hope; so that
I cried unto the Lord, That he would never let his Judgments depart, until the
Prince of this World was judged and cast out: So he followed me with his
righteous Judgments, until I was near ready to faint: Then I cried again,
saying, If thou will indeed bring me through thy Judgments, and grant me thy
Everlasting Peace; If thou will destroy the Enemy of my Soul, and give me rest
from those that oppress me; Then will I Teach Sinners thy ways, and
Transgressors shall be converted unto thee: yea, I made many promises unto him,
that my life I would give up unto his service, and that I would follow him
whithersoever he would lead me: yet oft-times I enquired of the Lord, why I
should be so afflicted more than others; For I said in my heart, Never man's
sorrow was like my sorrow: Then he answered me, and said, How should thou
declare my wondrous works, unless thou see, and know them; So when I had born
the indignation long, even the time of his good pleasure, when I had been long
tossed with tempests, even as a ship upon the Sea, and had long been as a
Pelican in the Wilderness, and an Owl in the desert, yea, as a silly Dove
without a mate, then he remembered Jacob his servant, and was pleased to speak
comfortably unto me, saying, Oh, thou tossed with tempests, afflicted, and not
comforted, Behold I will lay thy Stones with fair colors, and though for a
moment I have afflicted thee, yet with everlasting loving kindness have I
visited thee; and with many sweet and precious promises he compassed me about,
which at this time is unutterable, and he put the Cup of Consolation into my
hand, yea he caused it to overflow, for which my Soul did magnify his Name,
and gave praise unto him in the land of the living, unto which, by the Arm of
his Powers, I was brought through the long and terrible Wilderness; for he had
regard unto his own Seed, and brought it forth by an outstretched Arm: for he
plagued Pharaoh with his Judgments, and destroyed the Egyptians in the Red Sea
of his wrath: Wherefore I magnify the God of Heaven (who is Light) and extol
him above all Gods; for the Proud he is able to abase with his Judgments, and
to exalt the Meek with his tender Mercies.

Thus have I drunk the bitter Cup of Gods fierce indignation, the Ministration
of the Law, and of Condemnation, which in its time was glorious; the Just
rejoiced therein, until the Prophets Ministry came, whereby the hope came in
of a Redeemer from all sin, the Law, and Curse thereof; (And of deliverance
from the Judgment and the Wrath) which stayed me in the patience, to bear the
indignation, under which I long had traveled through many tribulations, until
John's Ministry I came to see, which was the greatest of all the Prophets which
had gone before, from the greatest unto the smallest: For then the Way was made
so strait, the Path was made so plain, that the coming of God's Son I saw in
his great Power to reign, whose Kingdom now is come with Power; the Lamb is set
on's throne; the least that in this Kingdom is, he greater is then John: So
here the Mystery of the work of Regeneration is; he that can read me herein,
may know where my dwelling is.

So when he had thus exercised me with his Judgments, and filled my heart with
his tender Mercies, and enlarged it with his Loving Kindness, so that the Way
of his Commandments was delightful unto me, and my life was not dear unto me
for his sake; then he spoke unto me, saying, Thou must be my Servant to bring
again the dispersed of Israel, etc. with much more, which I judge is not
expedient here to be expressed; So to his service I gave up my life truly, and
whatsoever I had, I accounted not dear for his sake; for he gave me the promise
of his good presence, that it should never leave me, nor forsake me, but that
he would accompany me therewith: And he is faithful, and keeps Covenant, and
performs his word unto his Servant; For he has carried me through many
Countries in which I was a Stranger, and from one Nation to another People he
has led me; and sometimes through many People of diverse and strange Languages;
and his good presence never departed from me since I left the Land of my
nativity; but he is a constant Companion unto me, and his Almighty power is
with me, through which I am able to do all things, and no thing is hard unto
me; though bonds and travels attend me, yet the comfort of his Spirit is with
me, and all places are alike unto me, both the roaring Sea, and the dry Land,
because of his Omnipresence who created them all; And this is the Mighty God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who is with me, who fills my heart daily with his
Love, and causes his Blessing and Living Virtue to abound, so that my Cup does
overflow, for which I Bless and Magnify his Name, and Sound forth his Praises
through the Horn of his own Anointed; And this is the God whom David served,
who is now with me, even he that made him wiser then his Teachers, and gave him
more understanding then the Ancients, and delivered him out of the Mouth of the
Lion, and from the paw of the dovouring Bear, and gave the Life of the
uncircumcised Philistine into his hand; even he it is that does accompany me,
and carry me through all my travels; who spoke to Moses out of the Bush when it
was on Fire, and was not consumed, at whose voice Moses feared and trembled
exceedingly; and this is he of whom I make my Boast, who leads me whethersoever
he pleases; And who shall withstand him in his way, and not fall before him?
for the lofty City he brings it down, he lays it low even with the dust;
Wherefore howl ye Inhabitants thereof; For behold, your desolation comes
swiftly, and none shall be able to hinder it; for the Destroyer of the Gentiles
is on his way; and who is he that can withstand him, or be able to deliver you
out of the just hand of the Almighty? for he is greater and stronger then all,
whose Controversy is certainly great with you, and will assuredly plead with
you in his jealousy, and in his fierce indignation, and you shall not escape
his hand; for he will find you out, whatsoever covering you hide your selves
under, and he will recompense every one according to their doings; for all
things are naked and bare before him with whom we have to do; And his Kingdom
of Righteousness shall be exalted over all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the
Lord God Omnipotent shall reign, and the Powers of Darkness must bow before him
that sits upon the Throne, and rides upon the white Horse whose name is called
Faithful and true; and in righteousness he does judge and make War: wherefore
let the Armies that are in Heaven rejoice, that follow him upon white Horses;
for your Enemies shall be given into your hands for a prey, and by their spoil
shall you be enriched: He that has an Ear to Hear, let him Hear what the
Spirit says, which now speaks expressly, and signifies the things that must
shortly come to pass.

Wherefore put on valor and courage you heads of the Army of the Lords
Heavenly Host, who are in the front of the Battle, and art oft-times deeply
engaged in War with the Beast and false Prophet, (who must be taken alive, and
cast into the Lake:) I say unto you my beloved Brethren, and Fellow Soldiers
(whose Weapons are not carnal but spiritual, and mighty through God) I am not
insensible of your travels, combats, and oppositions, and hardships which daily
you meet withal, but in my measure partake with you, and do truly travel in
your strength, (I speak to the wise in heart) and I also partake with you of
the everlasting Consolation which daily abounds, so that we need not faint in
our minds, nor in our hearts, though our Enemies seem many in number, and great
in strength; for the Lord, the mighty God of Jacob is with us, even the Mighty
Jehovah is on our side, (and this you fully know, and it is not because you
know not these things, that I write thus unto you, but because you know it, and
can seal this Testimony, and that you may be refreshed hereby;) and he it is
that fights all our Battles for us; and all Nations are but as a drop of a
Bucket before him; and the hearts of Kings are in his hand, and he can turn
them as the Rivers of Waters; who turns a Fruitful Land into barrenness, for
the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

Oh my beloved Brethren, how does my Soul love you, and cleave unto you! how
often are you in my Remembrance! and sweet, pleasant, and delightful is the
Remembrance of you unto me; your Beauty ofttimes even ravisheth my Heart, and
(at this time) even overcomes me; your Crown is glorious which I behold, and
the might of the Power with which you are endued, and by which you are armed,
who can declare! Oh, go on therefore you mighty men of War, you valiant
Champions of the Lord's Host lay waste the heritage of the wicked, that the
heritage of the godly may flourish: Let the Nations feel the stroke of the Hand
of the God of David (who is with you) who smote the Philistine (that defied the
Armies of the living God) that he dyed; Let the Enemies of Gods Truth be
smitten in the hinder parts, that they may fall and never rise again; For Gog
and Magog have set themselves in Battle against the Lord, and the Briars and
Thorns shall set themselves in array; but, Oh how will he dash them to pieces
like a Potters Vessel of Clay! and how will he burn them up, and consume them
with the Fire of his Jealousy, and fierce Indignation, and Wrath! how will he
consume it, and lay waste, until the Spoyler be utterly spoiled, and the
Devourer laid waste! for the Cries of the Oppressed and Distressed Suffering
Seed is entered into the Ears of the Lord God of Sabbath, and he has assuredly
regard thereunto, and he has awakened and made bare his Arm, that cut Rahab,
and wounded the Dragon in the days of old; and he has rouzed up himself as a
man out of Sleep, and has put on the Garments of Vengeance for clothing, and
is clad with Zeal as with a Cloak: and fury to his Adversaries he will repay;
and he will certainly plead the cause of his own Elest, who have no other
helper in the Earth.

Wherefore all you suffering Lambs of the True Shepherds Fold, be of good
cheer, and of good comfort, and suffer patiently whatsoever the Enemy shall be
suffered or permitted to inflict upon you for the trial of your faith; and
eternally I say unto you, it will be your Crown for ever, and everlasting
reward shall you receive from the hand of the Almighty; when you have been
tried thoroughly, then shall you appear in the Beauty of holiness, and your
sorrow shall be turned into rejoicing; and for your affliction you shall have
the everlasting comfort of Gods good Spirit, which shall abide with you
forever; and the wicked, and those that hate you, shall be clothed with shame
and everlasting contempt, and confusion shall cover them, for the Mouth of the
Lord has spoken it.

Wherefore put on courage and strength in the Name of the Lord, and lift up
your heads above all sufferings, for these things last but for a moment, and
will pass away, and be forgotten, as they had not been, and are not worthy to
be compared to the glory that is to be revealed in them who abide faithful; for
their reward will be everlasting, and will endure for ever; wherefore above all
have an eye unto the Lord, and have respect unto the recompense of reward, and
this will carry you through with cheerfulness, so that nothing will be dear
unto you for his sake who has shed abroad his rich Love in your hearts, and
the aboundings thereof. I question not but the upright in heart feel daily: For
the Lord is not slack toward any of his faithful ones, but is free and large
in his Love, and rich in his Mercies, and freely extends it, even as a River
into the hearts of his chosen: wherefore be replenished therewith you suffering
Plants; for this I testify unto you in the Name of the Lord, that the virtue
of the Life of Holiness I thus hold forth freely toward you, so that none
needs faint under the Oppressor, but may receive renewedness of strengh to bear
yet a season: And behold, he in whom you have believed will be avenged on your
Adversaries, and will smite your Enemies in the hinder parts, and they shall
fall, and none shall help them, neither shall they rise again. If you walk
humbly with the Lord, and reverence him above all, who is the God of Life, then
shall you have rest from all your Enemies, and your Portion shall be the Lord,
and your Kingdom shall be that which is not of this World, which is an
everlasting Kingdom, and shall never have end: So the Lord God of my Life keep
you all in Lowliness, and Faithfulness, and true Humility before him; for he
who is the Holy One of Israel dwells with such, and unto them his goodness
extends, but especially to them of a clean heart: Farewell.

Written at the movings of the Spirit of the Lord, the Eighth day of the Third
Month, 1662, as I was traveling in the Wilderness, as without, on Long Island
in America, and pondering in my heart the things of God, and his dealings in
times past, and also present; then the Spirit of the Lord, and the Power of the
Lord overshadowed me, and his glory filled the Temple, and be showed me things
not now lawful to be declared. J. C.

To all who desire to know the Way to the Kingdom of Peace and Righteousness;
this to you is the Visitation of God.
THat which was in the beginning, before the World was, and is now made
manifest, which we have seen, and which we have tasted of, and which our hands
have handled of the Word of Life; and that which is revealed to us in secret of
the Spirit of the Lord, that do we declare openly, even that which we are eye
Witnesses of; For the Word has took flesh, and dwelt amongst us, and we have
beheld his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of
Grace and Truth: And this is he who is appeared in Spirit, and made manifest
for this end, that the works of the Devil might be destroyed; and that by and
through him, the God of the spirits of all flesh might be revealed; for want of
whose knowledge the people perish; and many (in diverse parts of the World, as I
have observed) are in great perplexity and some even at their wits end, because
of the distractions, and many cries that are in the World, some crying this is
the way, and other some, that is the way; and all of them from the Light of the
Son of God in their own hearts and Consciences, which leads in the way of Life
and Peace (all who are guided by it) and out of all confusion and destruction
about Religion, and Church-Ordinance, and worship, and such things, about which
the World is in heaps and confusion; and are prescribing ways and worships in
their own fallen wisdom, and would compel all to conform thereunto, (and so
(...) bind the Conscience of people to their wills) which ought to be left unto
the Lord, to be exercised by his Power in matters of Worship and Obedience
toward him; and his Prerogative is to Rule there; So that people must either
disobey God, or the Laws of corrupt fallen Man; and whether is better, judge ye.

And this is sad to see and consider; because there has been for so many Years
by past, so much preaching, and so much profession of Liberty of Conscience,
and the like, and that by men of all Professions, as they have come into
Authority one after another; and many and seeming fair Promises have been made
by them all, that free Liberty of Conscience (in things relating to God) should
be granted and allowed to people of all sorts: for the breach of which
Engagements (with many other) diverse have already been rooted out, and
overturned; and yet thereby men have not taken warning (though besides,
warnings have often been given them in render love) to perform their Promises and
Engagements in these things, and all other, though much consists therein as
to their Establishment; and on the contrary, to their Ruination: Neither have
they Learned to give the same Liberty to others (in things relating to the
Conscience) as themselves would desire to have; and this is not to do as they
would be done unto. And therein they are short of fulfilling the Royal Law of
God.

Wherefore let all people (who are making Laws to compel men's Conscience)
consider how they are degenerated from God, and how darkness has covered them,
and hardness of heart has seized on them; so that they cannot have regard unto
tender Consciences, but in the pride of their hearts would be Lords over the
Consciences of others: Surely they are not guided by the same Spirit that the
Apostle was in the primitive times, who said, Let every man be fully preswaded
in his own Conscience, and this was true Liberty of Conscience.

And notwithstanding all the Profession that there has been, and yet are in
the World, and the Talk of God, and Christ, and Redemption, and Salvation by
him, yet now, when the Son of God is come, is there faith to be found on Earth?
or are people Redeemed from the Earth, or saved from the pollutions of the
World? I tell you nay; for all who err from the Light of the Son of God in
them, they are in the Alination, and Degeneration, and are strangers unto God
and his Covenant of Peace, and Reprobate concerning that Faith which gives the
Saints victory over the World, and so are drove out into the Earth (not
redeemed from it) but are Bondslaves to corruption, and live in the pollutions
of the World: And in this state the whole World lies, notwithstanding all
their Profession, and talk of Religion which is amongst them; and so their
fruits plainly manifest it; and thereby it is clearly seen, that their Teachers
were not sent of the Lord, neither have they had his Word, nor stood in his
Counsel; therefore have they not profitted the people, nor turned them from the
evil of their ways, neither are they brought to the knowledge of the Truth by
which Freedom and Redemption is witnessed: So their Preaching is vain, and
their Faith is vain, and they remain in their sins, which separates them from
God, and are dead while they live, and are unrestored, and unreconciled, and
have no assurance of their eternal wel-being: And when any comes into a serious
Consideration, and unto a true sense of the sad state they are in, and how they
have lived, and spent their time all their Life long: Then Judgment, and Wrath,
Condemnation, and Pangs, and the Sorrows of Hell conpasseth them about; and
then seeing themselves in the perishing state, are even at their wits end; yet
these things they consider not in the time of their prosperity.

Wherefore all people every where, who desire to come out of these
Distractions, and Confusions, and Hurryings, and Contentions about Faith, and
Worship, and Ordinances, and out of the Pollutions which the World lives in,
and to come into the Spiritual Worship which is in the Spirit and in the Truth:
To you I say, that is the Spirit of Truth in you all (in which God will be
worshipped) which reproves you of sin in your hearts; and as you come into
obedience to that, it will bring you into the Spiritual Worship: For the
Spiritual Worship consists in Obedience to the Spirit; and this is the
everlasting Ordinance of God (viz.) Christ the Light, the quickening Spirit;
for him has God ordained of old, to all that believe, and work Righteousness
for Salvation: So all being exercised in the Light, and with the quickening
Spirit, here you are exercised in the Ordinance of God; and here the living
Substance is known, in which the Shadows, Types, and Figures end: And here the
Handwriting of Ordinances is blotted out: And here the Law ends, which was
contained in Ordinances, (mark that) in Christ the everlasting Ordinance.

Concerning FAITH.
ANd the Living FAITH, which gives the Saints victory over the World, this
comes by hearing of the Word, which is nigh unto you all, even in your hearts,
and in your mouths: and as every one comes to hear and obey it, you will
thereby be begotten in the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints, by
which they wrought Righteousness, and that is the Faith which gives victory
over the World, and which works by love for the purifying of the Conscience
from dead works to serve the living God; and without this Faith it is
impossible to please God; for whatsoever is not of Faith is sin. So search your
selves, and see, whether you are in this Faith, yea or nay; or whether your
Faith be not a dead Faith: For that which does not lead to work righteousness
is a dead faith: for as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
works is dead also; yet by works only there is none justified, (and faith
without works is dead, for the Faith of Abraham wrought with works, and by
works Faith is made perfect: So let not any deceive themselves with a fained
faith, or framed in the imagination; for that is a vain faith, and not able to
save you: Also beware that your Faith toward God be not taught by the Precepts
of men, for that will stand you in no stead, neither will it give you victory
over the Pollutions of the World, nor purify your hearts from sin: Wherefore
mind the Word which is nigh, by the hearing of which Faith comes, even the
Living Faith (by which the Just live,) which was once delivered to the Saints,
and which we earnestly content for.

Concerning HOPE.
ANd the living Hope, which makes not ashamed, but puryfieth the heart, even
as God is pure: This is not witnessed nor known, but through the tribulation
and patience in the experimental working and operation of the Spirit of Life in
the inward parts, and Word of Life; For by the Word of God, which lives and
abides for ever, are we begotten again unto a lively Hope, which we have for an
anchor both sure and steadfast in all our Trials, and tossings, and hurryings
which we meet withal in the World, and amongst the hypocritical Professors
thereof, whose Hope will perish in the day when the Wrath of God is revealed
from Heaven upon all who hold the Truth in unrighteousness: But he whose Hope,
is begotten by the operation of the Word and Spirit of Life, even he it is that
purifies himself even as God is pure:

So all who desire the Way of Life to know, and to walk in the Path of Peace,
which the Worker of Iniquity knows not; I say unto you all, it is in the midst
of the Paths of Judgment, which Christ the Light, the wisdom of God leads unto:
So every one, the light in your own Consciences mind, wherewith Christ Jesus
the Son of the Fathers love has enlightened you; and as you Wait in it, you
will find it checking and reproving you for sin and iniquity in the secret of
your hearts and Consciences; and as every one comes to be guided by this Light,
which is the way, it will be an infallible guide unto you, to lead you in the
way of Righteousness, and in the midst of the paths of Judgment; and the worker
of iniquity you will see judged in your own particulars daily; and the Prince
of this World will come to be cast out, as you dwell in the Judgment; and this
is the way whereby Sion comes to be redeemed.

Wherefore dwell in that which judges the man of sin in your own particulars:
and join not to that Nature which would lead to work iniquity, or
unrighteousness, but join to that which (in your own particulars) judges it;
and here the Cross you will know, which the whole World are Strangers to; and
then the Old man will come to be weakened, and to be put off with his deeds,
that the New man be put on, which is created in Righteousness and true
Holiness; but this work is not wrought nor effected but though many Combats,
Trials, and great Tribulations, which formerly you were not acquainted with,
while you were lead captive at the Devils will, and followed his lusts, and the
strong man armed kept the house, then all was at peace; but when the stronger
is come, the other must be bound, and a spoil of his goods must be made, and
his heritage must be laid waste; for the coming of the second Adam (Christ
Jesus the Light of the World) is not to send Peace on Earth, but a Sword; and
then you will hear of Wars, and rumors of Wars* see then that ye be not
troubled, for these are but the beginning of sorrow, but the end is not yet.

So as every one are exercised with the Spirit of Truth (in your own
particulars, which reproves you of sin) this will lead you into all truth, and
to work Righteousness, and will bring you to fulfill the Royal Law, and the
Prophets, which is, to do unto all men as you would men should do unto you: And
whenever the motions of sin and iniquity shall arise in your hearts, as you
watch in the Light it will be seen, and by the Spirit of Truth it will be
judged, before it will be brought forth into action; and here the Cockatrice is
crushed in the shell, and Babylons brats dashed against the stone, and happy
shall he be that does so.

So there must be a diligent watch set before the door of thy Lips, and a
diligent waiting in the Light (which is the eye) that the Enemy may be seen in
all his wiles, and that his baits and snares may be discovered, and escaped,
who lies in wait to devour, and hunts for that end, to keep the heart polluted,
for then he has his nest there; so, herewith a young man may cleanse his way,
even by taking heed thereunto, according to the Word, which is pure, and is
nigh, even in the heart, and in the mouth, and this is the Word of Faith which
we preach, which was in the beginning, and is nigh unto all, which you do well
if you take heed, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawn,
and the Day Star arise in your hearts: And as you all take heed unto this Word,
it will be unto you a Light unto your feet, and a Lanthorn unto your paths; and
the operation of it you will know as a fire to purge the filth out of every
ones heart, and as a Sword to separate you from your former Lovers: and this is
the Word of Reconciliation which (purging out the filth) reconciles us to God;
and this will be a Teacher near you, so that none will need go far for
teachings; for your eye shall see your Teacher, which shall not be removed into
a corner any more, according to the Promise of God made by his Prophets in the
days of old, and your ears shall hear this Word behind you saying, this is the
Way, walk in it, when you turn to the right hand, or when you turn to the left.

Wherefore, incline your ears, and come unto me (says the Lord) hear and your
Souls shall live, and I will make with you an Everlasting Covenant, even the
sure Mercies of David: So now the day of gathering into Gods Everlasting
Covenant of Light, Life and Peace is come; and now is the day of Gods
Visitation unto all People, and the time now is wherein you may come to know
reconciliation with God, and wherein you may come to he made nigh, who are in
the alienation and degeneration; and now the time is wherein you may come to
know the Restoration out of the fallen state: Wherefore be not rebellious
against the Light, neither be ye stiff-necked against the Reproofs thereof in
your own Hearts; neither resist the motions of Gods good Spirit of Grace in
your inward Parts, by which he has long striven with you; and do not dispite
unto it by resisting the motions thereof, lest it leave to strive with you, and
the day of your Visitation pass over, and your Hearts be heardened, and you
become even sold to work wickedness, and then it be said unto you, as Christ
said to Jerusalem, How often would I have gathered you, as a Hen gathers her
Chickens under her Wings, but ye would not; therefore, behold your house is
left desolate.

Wherefore consider your ways, and how the good Spirit of God has long striven
with you, to gather you out of the Pollutions, Ways, and vain Traditions of
the World; and every one while you have time prize it, and while it is called
to day harden not your hearts, lest thereby you provoke the Lord to Anger and
Jealousy, which cannot be quenched; for this know, that his long suffering and
forbearance will come to an end, and his Spirit will not always strive with
man; therefore while the tenders of Gods Love are held forth unto you every one
(who desires to know the Salvation of your Souls) receive it, and that which
begets good desires in your minds, and judges evil desires when they arise,
that own for your Guide and Teacher; And this will exercise your minds in
Lowliness and Humility, and keep down the lofty spirit, and high imaginations
which will puff the mind up above the fear of God; so keep down in the
Humility, for this the Lord requires of thee, Oh man, whosoever thou be, to do
justly, and to love mercy, and walk humbly with God; for the proud he
resists, but he gives grace unto the humble; by which he teaches them his
precepts even by his good Spirit of Grace, which brings Salvation, and which
has appeared unto all men; by this I say he teaches them, that denying
ungodliness, and worldly lusts, they should live Soberly, and Righteously, and
Godly in this present evil World, (mark) the Grace which teaches this and
which brings Salvation, has appeared unto all men: so that which brings
Salvation, is nigh unto you; the Grace of God which has appeared unto you; so
every one mind that, and none turn it into wantonness, nor into laciviousness;
but every one give up to be taught by it, that the precepts of God you may come
to know, and walk in them: And so here is the great Salvation of God, Gods
Covenant of Light, which lights every man that comes into World; I have given
thee (says he) a Covenant of Light, to lighten the Gentiles, that thou may
be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth; mark, Gods Covenant of Light for
Salvation, which lights every man that comes into the World, in which Light
the Nations of them that are saved must walk: And says God (who is Light) I
the Lord search the heart, and try the reins; look unto me, and be saved all ye
ends of the Earth; mark again, unto him that searches the heart, and tries
the reins, all the ends of the Earth must look for Salvation; so that it comes
not from the Mountains, nor from the Hills, but Salvation is of the Lord; and
God is Light, and in him is no darkness at all; and that is the Father of
Lights, and is in the Son, and the Son in him, and the Father and Son are one;
who lights every man that comes into the World: wherefore dwell in the
Light, and walk in the Light, that you may be Children of the Light; for the
Earth shall be covered with darkness, and gross darkness shall be over the
people, but the Lord shall become the Light of his Israel, and his God his
glory.

Wherefore come out of the gross darkness with which the Earth is covered, and
walk in the Everlasting Light of the Son of God, wherewith you are enlightened;
and walk no longer in the dark paths of Ignorance, neither follow the
Blind-guides of the World any more, who have fed you with their own aerie
Imaginations, and Conceptions, and brain-study, and have spoken unto you a
Divination of their own brain, and not from the mouth of the Lord, and your
souls are not satisfied with all that ever you received from them; And why then
will you spend, your money for that which is not bread? and your labor for
that which does not satisfy your souls? Oh hearken diligently unto the voice
of God, (who is Light) that you may eat of that which is good, and your souls
may be satisfied; for why should your souls be in poverty, and dry, and barren
(now the Fountain of durable Riches is open,) but because you are alienated
from the Lord, and Strangers to his Covenant of Light! Wherefore the
Restoration all wait to know, by him who brings back again that which has been
driven away, that the return of your Captivity you may come to know and witness
out of Babylon that great City (whose desolation comes suddenly,) and be ye
separated from the abominations thereof, and touch not the unclean thing, that
you may be received of the Lord into my Fathers house, where my dwelling is, in
which there is no want of any good thing; for here is all plenty of Heavenly
rich virtue, and sweet Consolation; wherefore I cannot but invite all who are
hungry to come freely, for the Fountain is open, and whosoever thirsts may
drink of the water of life freely.

But now, my Friends, this know, that the Way that leads to this Ocean of Rest,
Kingdom of Grace, and Fountain of Life, is strait and norrow, and none can walk
therein, but through Self-denial, and taking up the daily Cross to the Carnal
Mind; which may seem hard to such as enter into Reasonings and Consultations
with the wrong nature, which would still live; but that being denied, and the
Light being joined unto, which manifests the Way; and the Cross being taken up,
and the Yoke submitted unto; then the Power of the Lord you will feel, which
will subject the contrary nature, and will make the Way easy and plain before
you, yea, and delightful unto you, though it be in the midst of the paths of
Judgment; for the Righteous will rejoice therein: And though many oppositions,
and sometimes many difficulties you may find in the way, yet keeping to the
Light in singleness, and feeling the Power of God, and the secret working
thereof, it will keep the mind cool, and exclude the Consulter: And then the
way thou will see open clear before thee, through all difficulties; and as thou
waitest in the pure fear of the Lord, keeping thy mind stayed upon him, thou will feel his good hand of love reaching unto thee daily, administering
renewedness of strength unto thee, whereby thou will be sufficiently encouraged
to press on in the strait and narrow way, and the way of his Commandments will
be delightful unto thee, and not grievous; and he will replenish thy heart with
his Grace, and make thee know the aboundings of his love, which will exceedingly
enlarge thy heart; So let none stumble or start aside at the straitness of the
Way, but be willing to submit to the Cross, that the Crown thou may come to
receive, which is Immortal and Eternal; and then it will never repent thee
whatsoever thou art made to deny; For an Hundredfold thy Reward will be in
this life from the Hand of the Lord, and Peace and Life everlasting thou will
have the assurance of, and it thou will possess and enjoy; and this is of more
value with the Upright in Heart then all the Love, Glory, or Friendship of the
World; for that lasts but for a little season, and then passes away; but this
Inheritance is Everlasting, and never has End.

Wherefore let not your Minds be captivated with any perishing thing
whatsoever; but in that which will redeem the mind out of all that is
perishing, in that dwell, and you will know a daily dying unto sin, and to all
things of that nature, which keep the soul in Death, and thereby you will be
quickened unto God; and the Desires and secret Breathings which are in you
after God will more and more increase, and be renewed, and Fervency of heart
and Zeal for the Lord will increase also: And where these fervent Desires and
Breathings are in any one, nothing will satisfy but the Presence of the Lord:
And as this is dwelt with, in sincerity and in singleness, the Lord in his own
time will manifest himself to thy everlasting Satisfaction, Comfort, Joy, and
Content: Wherefore let not any thing be accounted dear for his sake; For he
that loves Father or Mother, Wife or Children, or any thing more then me
(says Christ) is not worthy of me.

Wherefore I now publish the Decree of the Almighty unto all Nations, That
whosoever will not serve, worship, and obey the God of Heaven, who is Light,
and searches the heart of man, even he shall dye, and Darkness shall be his
Covering, and gross Darkness his Pavilion; and Death shall be his Life, and the
Terror thereof shall compass him about World without End.

JOSIAH COAL.

A VINDICATION Of the Light Within, Against the Darkness, Error, and Blasphemy
of JOHN NEWMAN, in his Book, Entitled, The Light Within, etc. Concerning The
Scriptures The Word of God. The Only Rule. The Light Within. The True Savior.
The Body of Jesus. The Spirit's Guidance.

THE main Controversy with John Newman, being at this time, Whether or no the
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament (so called) be not properly and
principally called the Word of God, and that distinct from Christ, whose Name
is called the Word? And whether the Scriptures be not a perfect Rule for all
men to walk by, and none other? Who, for the proving of the Affirmative, has
instanced several places of Scripture.

My Work at this time will be to show, That those Scriptures, produced by him,
do not any wise serve to prove his Affirmations, but rather the contrary;
though he has much wronged them, by wresting of them, as is usual with those,
who labor to pervert the Right Way of the Lord, as John Newman has
endeavored to do; which I doubt not, but I shall sufficiently show hereafter.

The first Scripture that he produces, as a Foundation, from whence to argue
the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is Luke 11.28. where Christ said, Yea,
rather Blessed are they, that hear the Word of God, and keep it.

Now (says he in page three) whether it be Jesus Christ, which in Scripture is
styled the Word of God; a Name which is given unto him, or whether the words,
which God has spoken by his holy Prophets, and Blessed Son, and Apostles, in
the two Testaments of his Will, etc. be not the Word of God?

Answer, Christ did not intend the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament at
that time, when he so spoke; but he meant himself, who was the Word that was
with God in the beginning, John 1.1. whom they were to hear and obey, as the
Father had given Commandment by the Mouths of his Prophets, and also by
Immediate Voice from Heaven; as by Moses, who said, A Prophet shall the Lord
your God raise up unto you, him shall ye hear, etc. And when this Prophet was
raised, and was with his three Disciples in the Mount, the Immediate Voice from
the Excellent Glory, said, This is my Beloved SON, hear ye him, Mat. 17.5. This
then is that Word, which they were blessed that heard, according to that Saying
of Christ to his Disciples, Blessed are your Ears, for they hear, etc. For,
many that had Ears could not hear the Word, though they had the Scriptures
(that were then in being) which testified of the Word: So its plain that Christ
spoke of himself, when he said, Blessed are they that hear the Word of God, etc.

And that he spoke not of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, there is
not any thing can be more plain; because the Scriptures that are called the new
Testament were not then written, nay, not any part thereof: So that its great
Ignorance in John Newman, to think that Christ spoke of the Scriptures,
especially of the new Testament, and not of himself.

But then in page 4. he says, I shall undertake to prove, that the Scriptures
of the two Testaments, etc. are properly and principally called the Word of
God, etc. And his first Proof is, Psalm. 18.28, 30. where the Prophet said, Thou will light my Candle; the Lord will enlighten my Darkness: And as for God, his
Way is perfect; the Word of the Lord is tried. And from hence argues, That the
Scripture is the Word of God, which David spoke of; Because, says he, its the
same that is called the Way of God: So takes it for granted, That the Scripture
is the Way of God; and concludes, That it must needs follow, that the Scripture
is the Word there spoken of, saying, It does appear, that the Scriptures, or
perfect Way of God, in which the Prophet walked, and by which he should be
enlightened, is here called, the Word of the Lord.

Answ. I cannot but Marvel, that men should be so wilfully blind, to go about
to wrest the Scriptures after this manner; when never a word of David, here
inserted, so much as speaks of the Scriptures, much less of the Old and New
Testament. But he here speaks, of what God, his Way, and Word was; and of what
God, whom he said, was his Lamp, would do for him: Likewise, in the 29th verse
(which J. N. willingly omits) he declares, what God had done for him, or, what
himself had done by the Lord (not by Scripture) By thee, I have run through a
Troop; and by my God, I have leapt over a Wall: And verse. 3^. It is God that
girdeth me with Strength, and makes my Way perfect: [Mark] He did not say,
That he made the Scripture a perfect Way for him; for the Scripture was not his
Way, by which he run through the Troop: Nor did he say, That by the Scripture
he would light his Candle, and enlighten his Darkness; but by Him, who is
Light, by whom he run through a Troop. So that it appears, it was the Power and
Strength of God, in which David walked, and by which the Lord did those things
for him, and not by Scripture: So that this serves nothing at all to prove the
Scriptures the Word and Way of God; neither do I understand, that the
Scriptures any where say, That they are the Way; but contrariwise, testify,
That Christ is the Way (whose Name is called, the Word of God) which was with
God in the beginning, and in the Bosom of the Father from Everlasting John
1.18. nevertheless, the Law written in Tables of Stone, was, in the
dispensation of time, the Rule, though not the Supreme Rule, which they were to
observe and do, until Christ the Seed came, who is the Way Everlasting.

The next Scripture, offered by J. N. to prove the Scriptures the Word, is out
of Psalm 119.100, 105. where the Prophet says, Thy Word is a Lamp unto my
Feet, and a Light unto my Path.

Now (says J. N.) what this Word is, he shows at large, in verse. 97, 98, and
101. where the Prophet plainly shows, That it was the holy Law of God, which
was his Meditation day and night: And further, he says, Thou, through thy
Commandments, have made me wiser then my Enemies: And in verse. 101. to show
what this Way of God was, he says, I have refrained my Feet from every false
way, that I might keep thy Word: And in verse. 106. he says, I have sworn, that
I will perform it, that I may keep thy Judgments: From whence we may plainly
see, That God's Word, which was a Lanthorn unto his Feet, and a Light unto his
Path, which Word he had sworn to keep; that it was the Commandments or Word of
God, in which was contained the Will of God, in order to David's Salvation. And
it is plain, the Word here is not meant of Christ, because the Prophet calls
it, The Word of God; and says, He had sworn to keep it. And it cannot in
reason be understood, That David, or any other man, did ever keep Christ; for
all his Saints are kept by him; for we are kept by the Power of Christ, through
Faith unto Salvation, etc.

Answ. How can a rational Person judge, but that J. N. is willing to put out
his own Eyes, lest he should see; and likewise to blind the Eyes of as many
more as he can; who thus tears the Scriptures to pieces, that the import of
them may not be understood; and then patch up a few bits together again, mixed
with his own Imaginations and Meanings, to make them show like what himself
would have? Wherefore did he not instance the 99th verse also, as well as the
98th and 100th, where David said, I have more Understanding, then my Teachers?
Was it not lest People should perceive, that surely David had some farther
Acquaintance and Community with God, then his Teachers had; and that God was
his immediate Teacher, by his Word, which he sent, and healed them that were in
distress, Psalm. 107.20. which was a Light unto David 's Feet, and a Lanthorn to
his Path? A thing, which his Teachers were not so acquainted with, though they
well knew the Law outwardly (which David also stricktly observed) as otherwise
it cannot be rationally understood, that David's Teachers did not well
understand the Law, yet he had more understanding, then they; for, he was a
Prophet of God, and knew the Word of the Lord, though it was (as he said)
forever settled in Heaven, verse. ^9. and said he, In God I will praise thy
Word, Psalm. 56.^. And thy Word has quickened me, Psalm. 119.50. And I have
hoped in thy Word, verse. 74. And when this Word was withdrawn out of his
sight, he said, Mine Eyes f^il for thy Word, verse. 82.

Now, who can be so ignorant and blind, as to think, that he spoke of the
Scriptures, when he said, Thy Word is settled in Heaven: For, were the
Scriptures settled in Heaven? And in God I will praise thy Word: Was it the
Scripture that he would praise? And I have hoped in thy Word: Was his Hope in
the Scriptures, or in Christ, as in him that was to come? And mine Eyes fail
for thy Word: Was it the Scriptures that his Eyes failed for? Surely no; the
Scripture (so much of it, as was then written, which were chiefly the Books of
Moses) was obvious enough to him, when the Word might be withdrawn out of his
sight, for a Trial unto him; as David said concerning Joseph, Psalm. 105.18, 19.
Whose Feet they hurt with Fetters: Until the time that his Word came; the Word
of the Lord tried him.

And who dares deny (without Presumption) but that it was the same Word, which
David said, Was a Light unto his Path, and a Lamp unto his Feet? So that all J.
N s. tearing assunder the Scriptures, with his additional Imaginations, will
not prove, that it was the Scriptures David spoke of, in this place; but was
indeed the Word, by which David (as a Prophet, to whom the Word of the Lord
came) spoke forth that part of the Scriptures.

And although David did meditate on the Law of God (which if I should grant it
to be only the outward Law, that came by Moses) yet that does not prove, that
he called it the Word; nor can it be understood, that he meant the Scripture,
when he so spoke of the Word, for the Reasons before given.

The Word was precious, or scarce, in those days, which came to the Prophets,
saying, So, and so; and those Sayings are signified or contained in the
Scriptures: But the Scriptures were not more scarce then, then at times before;
though the Word was, of which there was a Famine.

And though the Scriptures may be heard now, which contain the Saying of the
Word, which the Word demonstrated; yet all that hear them, cannot be said to
hear the sound of the Word, as they did, who heard those sayings demonstrated,
or sounded out of the Mouths of the Prophets, by the Word that so spoke.

And although J. N. says, Its plain, the Word here is not mean of Christ,
because the Prophet calls it, the Word of God; and says, He had sworn to keep
it: and it cannot in reason be understood, that David, or any man, did ever
keep Christ.

Answ. I answer, Here J. N. has wronged the Prophet's word; for he did not
say, That he had sworn to keep the Word; but, He had sworn to keep his
Righteous Judgments; as if he should have said, He would observe the Judgments
of the Lord, to walk in the Paths thereof; or, That he would walk according to
the Spirit of Judgment: Yet, notwithstanding this, It is but the
unreasonableness of J.N. to conclude, That David, nor any man, did never keep
Christ; for, they that keep in subjection to the Spirit of Christ, and dwell
under his Government, may be properly said to keep the Word, which is Christ.

And there were in the Church of Philadelphia, those that kept the Word, and
such denied not his Name, Rev. 3.8. [Mark that] He that kept the Word, denied
not his Name, which is called the Word: and in verse. 10. he said, Because thou
have kept the Word of my Patience, I will keep thee, etc.

Now, can it reasonably be understood, That it was the Scriptures, that were
here called the Word of Patience, which they kept; or that Scriptures were that
Name which they denied not, who kept the Word. Certainly I cannot rationally
judge, that any should be so blind; but if they should, the very next verse
will sufficiently clear the matter, where it is said, Hold fast that thou have,
that none take away thy Crown. [Mark] He having kept the Word of Patience, was
exhorted, to hold that fast which he had, that he might not lose his Crown.

And can any rationally conclude, That the Scripture was his Crown? Or else,
Was it not the Word of Life (and of Patience) which was in the beginning,
before the Scriptures were written; and would be his Crown when Scriptures
should be no more: For, Paul exhorts Timothy, To lay hold on Eternal Life, 1 Timothy 6.12. And must he not then lay hold on Christ, who is the Word, and the
Life? 1 John 1.1. and John 14.6. And they that had received him, who was the
Word and the Life, and was to be their Crown, as before is showed, and were to
keep, or hold fast that which they had received, May it not be properly said,
That they kept Christ? Certainly none can be so ignorant, who understand the
Scripture, to conclude, that no Man did ever keep Christ; although all his are
kept from the hour of Temptation, by him (who is the Power of God) through
Faith unto Salvation? By all which it plainly appears, That the words of the
Prophet, produced by J. N. do not prove, nor intend to prove the Scriptures to
be the Word of God, that the Prophets and Holy Men of God kept: although I
shall easily confess, that they do contain many sayings and words, that
proceeded from the Mouth of the Lord; all which were, and are, according to the
several Dispensations of time, to which they relate, to be observed also.

The next Scripture, produced by J. Newman, to prove Scripture the Word of God,
is, Isa. 28.9, 10, 13. where the Prophet said, Whom shall I teach Knowledge?
and whom shall I make to understand Doctrine, etc? Precept must be upon
Precept, Line upon Line, etc. the Word of the Lord was to his People, Precept
upon Precept, and Line upon Line, etc. So that ( says J. N.) its clear, the
Word of God is that Doctrine, Teaching, and Precepts, that was given at large
to God's People, etc. so its plain, etc. the Scripture is properly and
principally called the Word of God.

Answ. To which I answer, This does not at all prove the Scriptures to be the
Word, which the Prophet said, was Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept unto
them; for, though he said, Whom shall I make to understand Doctrine? and in
order to it said, The Word of the Lord must be Precept upon Precept: Yet that
does not prove, that the Doctrine was the Word; but the Doctrine was of the
Word; and by the Word, that came unto the Prophet, was the Doctrine
demonstrated; and they thereby made to understand it. And so the Word often times
came unto the Prophets (not the Scriptures) and bid them go, and speak, so, and
so; and the Doctrine, which they preached, could not be properly called the
Word it self, that came to them; though the sound of the Word was heard in the
delivery of that Doctrine: But their Doctrine proceeded from the Word, which
bid them so speak; so that there was the Word, the Teacher, and the Doctrine
thereof, the Teachings.

And this Word, so often coming unto the Prophet, to bid him go and speak unto
the People; it might well be said, That the Word of the Lord was Line upon Line
unto them: so that it plainly appears, that this Word (here spoken of) was not
intended to be the Scripture; neither does this at all prove the Scriptures to
be properly and principally called the Word of God, as J. Newman would have it.

Again, in page 7. J. N. says, Another Proof to confirm this Truth, is, Mark
7.13. where the Lord Christ does affirm the Commands of God, in the first
Testament, or Scriptures of the Prophets, to be the Word of God; because he
said unto the Pharisees, in the 9th verse, Full well ye reject the Commandment
of God, that you may keep your own Traditions: and in the thirteenth verse, he
said, Making the Word of God of none effect, etc.

Answ. This does not at all prove, that Christ called the Scripture of the
Prophets the Word of God; for it relates only to that particular Command of
God, viz. Honor thy Father and thy Mother: and Matthew says plainly, in chap.
15.6. speaking of the same thing, Thus have ye made the Commandment of God of
none effect, by your Traditions: Now the Question will be, whether Matthew or
Mark gave the right relation of the words of Christ; for, both theirs are but a
Relation (in this matter) of what Christ said to the Jews? Or, whether the
Translators did not wrong the Evangelists, in making one appear to speak one
thing, and the other another thing; seeing its plain, they both spoke of one
thing which they had seen and heard of Christ? And this one thing was the
Commandment, as aforesaid, as Matthew plainly calls it: and Mark, in the 9th
verse, calls it, the Commandment also; from which we may rationally conclude,
that the Fault was in the Translator, to make the one differ from the other, in
that Expression; but if he did indeed call that Commandment the Word, yet that
does not prove the Scriptures to be properly called the Word of God; for that
saying of Christ relates only to that one Command, which, with the rest of the
Commandments, are called the words which God speak; as Exodus 20.1. God spoke
all these words, saying, etc.

And that the Scriptures do contain a Relation of the words, that at sundry
times God speak, I shall easily acknowledge; but that they are properly and
principally called the Word of God, as J. N. affirms, I do deny; neither has
he produced any Scripture, that does prove it, as I hope, by these few Lines,
will appear to the Impartial Reader.

And so J. N. concluding; That he has proved the Scriptures of the first
Testament to be the Word of God, he says, he shall labor to prove, that the
Scriptures of the New Testament are also called the Word: and in page 8. he
says, The first Scripture for Proof hereof, is, Acts 4.25, 26, 27. where John
and Peter Preaching and Teaching Jesus Christ, out of the Psalms, to the
Rulers, etc. pray d unto the Lord, That they might Preach this Word with
Boldness (And says) 'Its plain from the scope of this place, that the
Preaching and Teaching of Jesus Christ, according to the Scriptures of the New
Testament, is properly and principally called the Word of God.

Answ. How has J. N. besotted himself, with laboring to pervert the Truth?
First says, he has proved the Scriptures of the Old Testament to be properly
called the Word of God; and now says, Its plain the Scriptures of the New
Testament are principally called the Word: And sometimes says, Christ is
called the Word of God: [Mark] Christ call d the Word, but the Scriptures
principally called the Word; so that he sets the Scriptures (as the Word) above
Christ, by saying, principally, etc.

And besides, How many Words of God he will make, or seem to make something he
would have without, to be called the Word, to keep People from enclining to the
Word in the heart, lest they should come to know Christ manifested in them;
which before he confesses the Apostles preached, when they prayed, That they
might speak the Word with Boldness: [Mark] If they preached Christ, and prayed,
that they might speak that Word with Boldness; then Christ was that Word, and
not the Scriptures; although their Preaching of him, and bearing Witness of his
Appearance and Coming, was according to the Scriptures of the Prophets: For
they showed the People out of Moses and the Prophets, that Jesus was Christ,
Acts 28.23. Yet this does not prove, that their Preachings and Teachings of him
were by the Scriptures of the New Testament; for they were not then written:
But they preached by virtue of the Word and Spirit that was in them, which they
had handled of, 1 John ^.1. which through them demonstrated it self, according
to the Pleasure of his Will, who wrought mightily in them, both to will and to
do; so that it may be observed, that the Scriptures, which J. N. produces, to
prove Scriptures to be the Word, do rather prove Christ to be the Word there
spoken of, which J. N. acknowledges the Apostle preached, when he prayed, That
he might speak that Word with Boldness.

His next is page 9. to the same purpose, where he says, In Acts 5.42. its
said, the Apostle did daily Preach and Teach Jesus Christ; and this Preaching
and Teaching of Jesus Christ, is in the 6th chapter, verse 4. called, The
Ministry of the Word, etc.

Answ. To which I Answer, Its true, they that preach Christ, they preach the
Word; and they that preach the Word, they preach Christ; for Christ is the
Word, as before showed, and hereafter shall be more largely demonstrated.

But then says J. N. The Word of God inrceased, etc. (from whence in page 18.
he argues) That none can in Reason imagine, that the Word of God, that so grew
and multiplied, can be understood of Christ (though he confesses) That the
increase of the Word was so mighty, notwithstanding the Opposition that the
preaching of Christ met with.

Answ. What can be understood by the Multiplying, Increasing, or Prevailing of
the Word of God, but the prevailency of Christ in that Work, which (in and by
his Servants, the Apostles, according to the Pleasure of the Father's Will) he
had undertaken, notwithstanding all the Opposition that he in them met withal,
according to that Saying, in Isa. 54.17. Every Tongue that rises up in
Judgment against Thee, Thou shall condemn: So that through the powerful
Operation of the Word Christ, Which in them wrought mightily both toward the
Circumcision, and Uncircumcision, Gal. 2.8. many were made to submit thereunto,
and to confess thereunto; and thereby the Increase of his Government was known,
which the Prophet said, Should be without End, Isa. 9.7. And the number of the
Disciples (or Believers on the Word) were multiplied; so that the Word
multiplied the Disciples thereof; and grew in Dominion over its Opposers; and
increased its Government in and among'st them: And this in Plainness and
Simplicity, was the Growth, Multiplying, Increasing, and Prevailing of Christ
the Word; and yet there was no more then one Christ prevailing, and increasing
in his Government, and multiplying his Disciples; though J. N. cannot see, but
there must of necessity be more then one Christ, if by the increase of the Word
be understood of Christ: so that although he concludes, it must needs be the
Doctrine, contained in the Scriptures, intended by the increase of the Word,
yet here he may see his Ignorance therein

Again, In page 9. and 10. J. N. says, That in Acts 19.20. the Preaching and
Teaching of Jesus Christ is called the Word of God.

Answ. To this I have already answered, that the preaching of Jesus Christ is
the Preaching of the Word; for his Name is called the Word: Yet is does not
follow, as J. N. would have it, that all the Disputings, which the Apostle had
for the space of three Months, was the Word: Its true, he disputed and
persuaded the things of the Kingdom (according to the Scriptures of the
Prophets) by Virtue of the Word that was in him; so that all they of Asia heard
the Word, or the sound thereof, when the Doctrine thereof was by it self
demonstrated; For, from you sounded out the Word of the Lord, said the Apostle,
1 These. 1.8. But the Apostle did not call his Preachings and Disputings the
Word; but that which he preached: For he preached Christ; but his Preachings
were not Christ, but a Testimony of him; as Christ said concerning the
Scriptures, They are they that testify of me, Joh. 5.39. By which it apprears,
that Christ was the Word which he preached, and which they in Asia heard the
sound of, according to that Saying of Christ, The Hour comes, and now is, when
the Dead shall hear the Voice of the Son, etc. And therefore this Argument is
but like the rest, which make nothing to prove the Scriptures to be principally
call d the Word of God.

Again, (says J.N.) I should have left prosecuting this Subject, but this
Truth yet finding more Friends to plead its Cause, I am not willing to be a
Hinderance, etc. And then quotes 2 Cor. 4.1, 2. where the Apostle said, He had
not handled the Word of God deceitfully. Now (says J.N.) what Word of God was
this, which he had not handled deceitfully, but the Ministry he had received,
even the Preaching and Teaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as is plain in
the 3d, 4th. and 5th verses? For, what he calls the Ministry in the 1st
verse, in the 2d the Word of God, in the following he calls it the Gospel,
and the preaching of Christ according to the Gospel; so that its clear by this
Witness also, that the Preaching and Teaching of Jesus Christ, according to the
Scriptures of the New Testament, etc. is properly and principally called, The
Word of God.

Answ. Truly J. N. had need find better Friends, or some that speak more
pertinent to his business, then this which he has here produced, or else he
may labor (as before he said he should) long enough to prove Scripture the
Word of God, and have all to do when he has ended: For, if I should grant that
he called his Ministry, or that of, and from which he ministered, the Word; yet
that does not prove the Scriptures to be the Word; because, the Life and Spirit
of his Ministry is not contained in the Scripture: Or, if I should acknowledge
the Gospel to be the Word; yet that does not prove the Scriptures to be the
Word; For, The Gospel is the Power of God, as the Apostle said, Romans 1.16. and
so are not the Scriptures; and the Gospel is Everlasting, but the Scriptures
are not so. But J.N. would make the Scriptures to be the Word, the Gospel, the
Ministry, and all; and jumbles all together, and then says, The Apostle calls
it so; when the Apostle says no such thing; but speaks of his Ministry; and of
the Gospel, which is the Power of God; and of the (Word, which endures
forever, which by the Gospel, the Power) was preached unto them, 1 Pet. 1.25.

And as to that Question, What Word of God was this that he had not handled
Deceitfully?

Answ. I answer, It was the Word which was from the beginning, as John said, 1 John 1.1. Which they had Seen and Handled; which were not the Scriptures; for
they were not from the beginning: but the Word was, which they had handled, and
which they handled not deceitfully; but in Simplicity declared openly, what
they received by its secret operation, and mighty working in them (according as
Christ commanded them) without adding thereto, or diminishing therefrom; and
hence it was that they said, They Handled it not Deceitfully.

Again, (says J. N.) The second VVitness, that appears to countenance this
Truth, is in Col. 1.25. where the Apostle calls, the Preaching of the Gospel
the Word of God: but for the better understanding of this VVitness, let us see
verse. 23. where the Apostle uses these words to the Church, If you continue in
the Faith, grounded and settled, and not removed from the Hope of the Gospel,
which you have heard, and which was preached to every Creature under Heaven:
Whereof, he says, in verse. 25. I Paul am made a Minister: But what to do? He
answers, To fulfill the Word of God: Now, what Word of God was this that Paul
did fulfill, but only his Ministry, in Preaching and Teaching of Jesus Christ,
according to the Gospel, which he here calls the Word of God? So that there
is no Truth more plain then this, that the Scriptures of the New Testament are
properly and principally called the Word of God.

Answ. Surely J.N. has a great Conceit of his blind Affirmations; it appears,
as often times I have seen it, viz. That Ignorance in some is as great a Cause of
Confidence, as sound Knowledge is in others: What Reason has J. N. from the
Scriptures before mentioned, to affirm the Scriptures of the New Testament to
be properly called the Word of God? Or the Word there spoken of by the Apostle
to be meant the Scriptures, which he said were given him to fulfill? For, in the
next verse he declares what that Word was, viz. The Mystery which has been
hid from Ages, and from Generations; but now made manifest in his Saints: To
whom (says the Apostle) God would make known what is the Riches of the Glory
of his Mystery amongst the Gentiles, which is, Christ in you the Hope of Glory.
[Mark Reader] He says, The Word which he was to fulfill, was the Mystery, etc.
and the Mystery was, Christ in them, etc. So that the VVitness, that J. N.
produces, testifies against his Affirmation as absolutely as may be, to the
utter overthrow of his Cause, by which the Ignorance and Blindness of J. N.
appears.

But then he says, in page 12. I shall give but one Scripture more for the
Proof of this Truth, and that is, Tit. 2.5. Where the Apostle calls the
Doctrine of Christ, the Word of God: For (says he) let us see what the Apostle
says in the first verse, where he gives Titus a Charge, to preach sound
Doctrine; and lays down the particulars thereof, what he should preach, and
the Persons distinctly to whom he should preach: and gives them Instruction in
the 5th verse, That they should walk to the Doctrine or Teaching answerably;
and the Reason he gave was this, Lest the word of God should be Blasphemed: so
that the Doctrine he gave in Charge to Titus, with all the particulars of the
Doctrine, the same in the 5th verse he calls, The Word of God.

Answ. That Conclusion is utterly false; he does not say (nor in effect say)
That the Doctrines, with all particulars of the Doctrines, are the Word: Nor
can it rationally be concluded, That it was the Scripture, or the Doctrine,
that he spoke of, when he said, Lest the Word of God should be Blasphemed: But
rather, that worthy Name by which they were called (which Name, they who kept
the Word denied not, as before showed) For, if they should not walk according
to the Doctrine of the Word, which they taught; the Ignorant that were
without, or they that watched for Iniquity, might be ready to judge, that there
was a difficiency in the Word, by which they were taught, or in the Name which
they professed and walked in; and so be encouraged to slight and speak evil of
the same: and thereby the Word (by which they were taught) might be
blasphemed, through their not walking according to the Doctrine thereof, who
made a Profession of it: so that the Apostle, in saying, Lest the Word of God
should be blasphemed, does not at all call the Doctrine the Word; nor does
this in the least serve to prove the Scriptures to be properly called the Word
of God; although thereupon J. N. thus concludes, That there is nothing more
evident then this Glorious and saving Truth, That the Scriptures or two
Testament, etc. are properly and principally called the Word of God. But what
the Scriptures offered by him, with his Arguments thereupon (which I have
before stated and answered) do make for his purpose, I shall leave to the truly
Juditious and Impartial Reader to judge.

The next thing (says J.N.) I shall insist upon, are the Reasons, for the
Confirmation of this Point, or gracious Truth, that I have asserted, etc. and I
shall labor to show that all those places, that I have brought to prove
Scriptures to be the Word of God, will stand firm, etc.

Answ. All the Scriptures which he has brought, I have already before examined
and explained, and I cannot but look upon it as superfluous, to go twice over
with one Work, as J. N. has done; for that which is unsound, or not right in
the Ground, Bottom, or Foundation, can never be made sound or right by
Repetitions: but the Subject before stated by J.N. is unsound, and not true, as
before proved; and therefore can never be made sound and true by Repetitions;
for which cause (as also upon consideration, that this same Subject has been
already often stated, and answered to, by several of us, as is notoriously
evident by several Books* now in Print) I look upon it (as I said before)
superfluous, to go over with the Repetitions of J. N. it being chiefly but a
Repetition of the above sited Scriptures, paraphaised upon once more by him,
which I have before examined, and spoken to: And therefore shall omit taking
further notice thereof at this time; and proceed to his next Subject or
Assertion, in the 22th and 23th pages of his Book, where he speaks as follows.

Concerning Scriptures being a Perfect Rule for all Men, etc.
HAving thus proved the Scriptures to be the Word, etc. I shall therefore show
briefly, That the Scriptures, I have so proved to be the Word of God, that they
are a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and no other; and this (says he) is
clear from Mat. 28.20. where Christ gives his Disciples Commission to preach
the Gospel, and says, Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command
you: and so likewise in Mark, where Christ confirms the same Commission, etc.
Mark 16.15, 16. Now this was not only to be preached for men to hear the sound
of, but also to believe and obey the same: And this Truth is confirmed in Acts
3.22. where its said, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of
your Brethren, (says Moses) like unto me, him shall you hear in all things,
whatsoever he shall say unto you: Observe that, Him shall you hear in all
things: From whence we may learn, That Christ gives no License to his People to
pick and cull his Ways* but to hear and obey him in all things, whatsoever he
shall say unto them. And that the Scriptures are in force as a Perfect Rule,
see Romans 16.25, 26. where the Apostle does affirm the Authority thereof, and
says, The Mystery that was kept secret since the World began, is now made
manifest by the Scripture of the Prophets, according to the Commandment of the
Everlasting God, and made known unto all Nations for the Obedience of Faith,
etc.

Answ. Reader, I would not be mis-taken in my Intentions, as though, I went
about to under-value the Scriptures of Truth; or, as though I had slight esteem
of them (for, I do in reallity own them; and do acknowledge them to contain
many true Testimonies of him, whose Name is called the Word of God; who is the
perfect Way to the Father; and the alone Guide, that leads unto Life eternal;
a Leader and Commander unto his People, appointed of the Father: I say, I own
the Scriptures to contain many true Testimonies concerning him, and concerning
many other things; and that they ought to be believed, etc. But that they are
therefore a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other, I cannot own;
for, they no where testify of, or concerning themselves: And if it were
certainly so, That they were a Perfect Rule, and no other (as J. N. affirms)
then it must of necessity follow, That they, who have not the Scriptures, are
without a Perfect Rule; and that before the Scriptures were written, the
Ancients and Worthies of God, as, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, Lot, Enoch, etc.
had no Perfect Rule to walk by; except he could prove, That the Rule by which
they walked (and by which Abraham was to walk before God, and be Perfect) was
no more to be a Rule, after the Scriptures were written; the which I no where
find recorded in the Scriptures: But contrariwise, That same Rule, by which
they walked, bore Witness unto the Scripture: And the Scriptures offered by J.
N. do not at all prove, that they are a Perfect Rule; except it could be
proved, that they contain all things that Christ commanded his Apostles to
preach and teach, which in reason none can conclude; for, although the
Scriptures be a part of what they preached and taught, yet there is but very
little of what they taught and preached declared in them; nor indeed, little at
all of the Preachings and Teachings of the most part of the Apostles;
therefore, if their Preachings and Teachings be the Perfect Rule for all men to
walk by, then the Scriptures are not indeed that Perfect Rule, they containing
in them such a small part of what they preached and taught.

Again, It cannot be understood, That the Scriptures were the Gospel that was
preached to every Creature under Heaven; for, a great part of the People under
Heaven, never heard (nor heard of) the Scriptures: But the Gospel was preached
to, or in, every Creature under Heaven, Col. 1.23. Therefore the Scripture is
not the Gospel.

And again, The Gospel that they preached, was, and is Everlasting: But the
Scriptures cannot be rationally understood to be Everlasting, because they are
things that are seen, which are temporal; therefore the Scriptures are not the
Everlasting Gospel, but the Power of God is, Romans 2.16.

And what does that saying of Moses avail, to prove the Scriptures a perfect
Rule for all men to walk by? For, if that Prophet was, and is to be heard in
all things, then he is to be looked unto as a Guide, and Commander, and Ruler;
and if a Ruler, then his Spirit, by which he rules, is the Perfect Rule above
Scripture.

And as to his saying, The Apostle confirms the Scripture to be a Perfect Pule
by these words, The Mystery that was kept secret since the World began, is now
made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, etc.

Answ. What, though that great Mystery was made manifest, according to the
Scriptures of the Prophets, that does not prove the Scriptures a Perfect Rule
for all men to walk by; for, the Manifestation of that Mystery by the
Scriptures of the Prophets, was no more but their persuading (or showing) them
out of Moses and the Prophets concerning Jesus, Acts 28.23. of whom all the
Prophets bore Testimony: For this Jesus, concerning whom the Apostles (by
Revelation and Commandment of the Everlasting God) persuaded the People, was
the Mystery that had been hid, as the Apostle to the Collosians, cap. 1. ver.
26, 27. declares, saying, The Mystery which has been hid from Ages and
Generations, but now is made manifest, etc. Which is Christ in you the Hope of
Glory [Mark] Is now made manifest: So here was the manifesting of that Mystery,
by the Scriptures of the Prophets, even by persuading them, or showing them out
of the Prophets concerning Jesus: so that the Apostle does not affirm (nor in
effect affirm) in the Scripture, That the Scriptures are a Perfect Rule; but
simply declares, That by the Commandment of the Everlasting God they made known
that Mystery (or preached Jesus) by (or out of) the Scriptures of the Prophets,
who had testified of him that was to come, and was then come according to their
Testimony, who is the Way, the Mystery, and the Word, which all are to hear,
obey, and keep.

But then says J. N. This is that Rule that Christ directs unto in Joh.
5.39, 40. where Christ says, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to
have Eternal Life: and to take away all Objections, as if it were only their
thoughts, and not really so, he adds these words, And they are they which
testify of me: and by way of Reproof, because they did not so do, he again
says, You will not come to me that you may have Life; by which he plainly
shows, that there was Life therein, by dutiful Obedience by Faith in him; so
that here the great Prophet and Teacher of his People sends us to the
Scriptures, as a Rule through Faith to come to Life.

Answ. How wilfully blind this man seems to appear, or like one that would put
out his own Eyes, and others also! to wrest and pervert the words of Christ in
such a gross and shameful manner, by tearing of them in sunder, and mixing his
own Imaginations therewith, to make them look quite another way, or to import
another thing; for that which J. N. argues Christ confirms ( viz. Their
thoughts of having Life in the Scriptures) he indeed reproved, as the words in
themselves without wresting clearly signify; for some Translations render it
thus, Ye search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have Eternal Life; and
they are they which testify of Me; and ye will not come unto Me: Mark, Ye
search, etc. he tells them they did search; but why? because they thought to
have Eternal Life in them, which were but a Testimony of him, who was the Life;
and he (by way of Reproof to them, for not believing on him, in whom Life was,
and of whom the Scriptures (which they searched) did testify) said, Ye will
not come unto me that ye may have Life: [Mark] his Me here spoken of, that they
would not come to for Life, was not the Scriptures, but Christ Jesus, of whom
the Scriptures testified: so that he did not plainly show, That there is Life
in the Scriptures, as J. N. (either wilfully or ignorantly) affirms; nor
directs to them as A Rule to come to Life: But reproves them because they did
not come unto him for Life, of whom the Scripture testified: so that the most
J. N. has done by this Argument is, even manifested his perverse crooked
spirit, by which he wrests and perverts the Scriptures, and would set them in
the place of Christ, to give Life: But what is the End of the crooked Serpent
in this Work, but to keep people from coming unto Christ the Power of God,
through which Life Eternal is received by all that follow and obey him, who is
the Truth, whose Spirit of Truth will lead into all Truth, as a certain Rule
for all to walk by, and in, which Christ directed them to wait for, as a Guide
to walk by; and the Apostle exhorted them to walk in the Spirit, saying, There
is no Condemnation to such, etc. Romans 8.1. Gal. 5.16. Asts 1.4, 5. And all this
the subtle Serpent does under pretense of Promoting (and not Perverting) the
right Way of God, and Rule of Life; but this serves not (as before showed) to
prove, That Christ directed to the Scriptures, as a Rule to come to Life; but
that he reproved them for that they would not come to him, who was the the
Life, that they might have Life.

But then says J. N. This Truth is confirmed in Paul's Epistle to Timothy,
chap. 3. verse. 15, 16, 17. where the Apostle shows, the Scriptures are able
to make us wise unto Salvation through Faith in Christ Jesus (And from hence J.
N. argues) That if the Scriptures are able to make us wise to Salvation
through Faith that is in Christ Jesus, then the Scriptures are a Perfect Rule
for all men to walk by, and none other: But the Scriptures are able to made us
wise unto Salvation through Faith that is in Christ Jesus; therefore the
Scriptures are a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other.

Answ. To which I answer, That Argument is falacious; for, though the
Scriptures are able to make wise to Salvation through Faith that is in Christ
Jesus; yet it does not follow (according to the sequel of the major) that the
Scriptures (the Faith in Christ Jesus being left out, as J. N. has done) are a
Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other; because its through that
Faith which is in Christ Jesus, that they are able to make wise, etc. which
Faith he makes no mention of in his Assumption and Conclusion, that they are a
Perfect Rule, etc. by which the Falaciousness of his Argument appears.

And indeed its necessary, that all should understand how the Scriptures are
able to make wise unto Salvation, through Faith, etc. for, the Scriptures here
spoken of (and which Christ spoke of, when he said, Ye search the Scriptures,
etc.) cannot be otherwise understood then the Scriptures of the old Testament,
because the other was not then written: And those Scriptures of the Prophets
were they that testified of Christ, who is the great Salvation of God: And God
said by the Prophet, He had given him a Covenant of Light to lighten the
Gentiles, to be for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth: And the Prophets
likewise showed the time when, and the place where this Messiah should be born
and brought forth in that Body which was prepared for him; in which old Simeon
beheld the Salvation, to wit, The Light of the Gentiles, and the Glory of
Israel: so that the Scriptures of the Prophets, containing in them so many
clear and infallible Testimonies of the great Salvation of God, and of the time
and place of the Appearance thereof, they were able through Faith in Christ to
make him wise, or to give an Understanding, that he was the great Salvation of
God that was then appeared, according to the Testimonies of the Prophets, which
from a Child he had known: And so on this wise, coming to the Knowledge of the
great Salvation of God by Faith in him, he in the same Faith did doubtless
follow him, as a Sheep that knew his Voice, that so he might receive Life
Eternal (which he gives to his Followers) and become an Heir of that Salvation,
which through Faith in Christ he was made wise unto; and so coming as a Sheep
to be a Follower of the true Shepherd, he owned him for his only Guide, and his
Spirit as the only Zule to walk by, and to speak by, whose Preaching was
thereby, even with words that it self taught, 1 Cor. 2.13.

And this is that Perfect Rule which cannot be corrupted, as the Scriptures
may, as J.N. confesses; and so cannot be said to be a Perfect Rule, if
corrupted: And indeed J.N. is one that greatly corrupts them (as he states
them) thinking thereby to prove them a Perfect Rule, even as before showed.

The next Argument to prove Scriptures a perfect Rule is, That if the
Scriptures be given by Inspiration, and are profitable for Doctrine, for
Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness, that the Man of God may be
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all Good Works, then the Scriptures are an
Absolute and a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and none other: but the
Scriptures are, etc. therefore, etc

Answ. That the Scriptures (though not all Scriptures) were given by
Inspiration of God, I shall grant; and that they are profitable, as aforesaid,
I shall acknowledge: but that they are therefore an absolute and a perfect Rule
for all men to walk by, and none other, as J.N. affirms, that I do not
acknowledge, but deny; because that may be profitable to man in order to the
persecting of him to all Good Works, which may not be an absolute and perfect
Rule for him to walk by, and none other; as for instance, One man may be
profitable to another in teaching and instructing of him by the Spirit of the
Lord, to walk in the Light and Spirit of the Son of God, which the Father has
sent into the Heart, that so by that Spirit, and the Power of it, he may be
able to deny all Unrighteousness, and be furnished thereby perfectly to perform
all Good Wooks; herein I say one man may be profitable to another, and yet it
cannot therefore be said, That that man, who is so profitable etc. is an
absolute and perfect Rule for all men to walk by, and no other; for it were
ridiculous: so that although the Scriptures be profitable, as aforesaid; it
does not at all follow (as J. N. concludes) that they are therefore a Perfect
Rule, and no other.

But that Word, Light, or Spirit of Truth in the inward parts, from whence the
Scriptures proceeded, and which by the Scriptures we are instructed to walk in,
to hear, and obey (which cannot be corrupted, as the Scriptures may) that is
the alone, absolute, and perfect Rule, all men ought to walk by, and none
other, as says the Scripture, Nehemiah 9.20. I gave them my Good Spirit to
instruct them. And this is that Rule or Leader which Christ directs to, Even
the Spirit of Truth, which will lead into all Truth, Joh. 16.13. the same the
Apostle directs to, saying, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the
Lusts of the Flesh [Mark] What more Perfect Rule can be then that which keeps
from the fulfilling the Lusts which bring forth sin; for if the Lusts be not
obeyed and fulfilled, the sin is not acted; therefore said the Apostle, He that
abides in him sins not; by all which it appears that J.N. has not proved
that the Scriptures are a Perfect Rule, and none other: Neither do the
Scriptures any where testify of themselves, as a Perfect Rule, excluding all
other: But frequently bear Testimony unto that one ancient standing RULE, which
was from the beginning, from which the Scriptures were given forth, and which
they direct unto.

Again, (says J. N. page 26.) For further Confirmation of this Truth I shall
add some few Arguments more, that the New Testament Way is a Perfect Rule for
all men to walk by, and none other.

Answ. This wholly alters the Case; for it is not the New Testament Way being a
Perfect Rule, etc. that we are contending against; neither will his proving the
new Testament Way to be a perfect Rule, at all prove the Scriptures to be a
perfect Rule; except he could first prove the Scriptures to be the New
Testament Way, which he is never able to do; for its declared in the Scriptures
called the New Testament, That Christ, who is God's Covenant of Light, said, I
am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Joh. 14.6. Abide in me, etc. cap. 15.4.
And my Sheep bear my Voice, and they follow me, and I give to them Eternal
Life, Joh. 10.27, 28.

Another New Testament Way or Perfect Rule then this, for men to walk in, and
by, I no where read of in the Scripture of Truth; but this Way (as the New and
Living Way) which leads to the Holiest of all, is frequently borne witness of
in the Scriptures, which (as before I have said) contain many Testimonies
concerning this Just One, who is the Way, the Word, the Truth, etc.

And indeed, the whole scope or drift of the Scriptures, or of what is
contained therein, is to direct and enduce people to walk in him, and according
to him, who is the Way, the true Shepherd, that carries his Lambs in his Arms
(Mark, if his Lambs are in his Arm, then he is essentially present with them.)

And I do no where read in the Scriptures that they are called the New
Testament, or the New Testament Way; but they testify of the New Testament,
that it is the Spirit that gives Life, as in 2 Cor. 3.6. the Apostle says,
Who has made us able Ministers of the New Testament, not of the Letter, but of
the Spirit; for the Letter kills, but the Spirit gives Life: And they
testify of the Way, that it is Christ,; so that the Way of the Spirit (which
is the New Covenant) is Christ, and they that are led by the Spirit, they walk
in Christ the New Testament Way; so that if J. N. had proved the New Testament
Way to be a perfect Rule, etc. it had served nothing for his purpose to prove
the Scriptures a perfect Rule, they being proved not to be the New Testament;
as also said the Angel unto John, cap. 19. verse. 10. The Testimony of Jesus is
the Spirit of Prophecy: though I do acknowledge, as before, That this New
Testament, or New Covenant, or Testimony of Jesus is testified of in the
Scriptures of Truth; yet they are not the thing, nor do they contain the thing
in them which they testify of, as J. Newman seems to imply they do, as
hereafter may be signified.

But instead of proving the New Testament Way a perfect Rule, he goes about to
prove the Scriptures a perfect Rule, but never proves (nor goes about to prove)
them to be the New Testament Way; but takes that for granted (as far as I
perceive) although that is the principal matter wherein the Controvesie lies
betwixt us, which I plainly perceive J.N. does not understand, though he has
so deeply engaged himself: For, if he could have proved the Scriptures, called
the New Testament, to be the New Testament Way, I should not have put Pen to
Paper to have contended against their being a perfect Rule for all men to walk
by: But herein is the great Mistake amongst many (as also in this man) They put
the Dead Letter for the Living Word, and the Scriptures for the Way, and so
would set them in the stead of the thing which they do but testify of; and
thereby keep people always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge
of the Truth, which sanctifies and sets free, 2 Timothy 3.7. Joh. 8.32. Joh.
17.17.

Then J. N. like a man fighting with the Wind (or like one that sets up a
Poppit of his own, and supposes it to be another, and then lies fighting with
it, when he has done) rumbles over a great deal of stuff (like one that wants
Work) contending against a Third Covenant, or a Third Testament Way, arguing in
the 26th page of his Book, That if a Third Covenant, or a Third Testament Way
has not been any where promised of God, then the Second is still in force, for
all men to walk by, and none other. And for my part, I know none that assert a
Third Covenant, or a Third Testament Way; nor yet any that deny the Second to
be in force: so that J.N. has busied himself to no purpose; as I said before,
like one beating of the Air; but I do not intend so to busy my self, to
contend against him about things in which I am not concerned: For, as I said, I
own no other Covenant nor Testament Way, but the Second Covenant, which God
promised by the Mouths of his Prophets, saying, Jer. 31.33. This shall be the
Covenant that I will make, etc. I will put my Law in their Inward Parts, and
write it in their Hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my People:
And they shall no more teach every man his Neighbor, saying, Know the Lord;
for they shall all know me, etc. And in Isa. 59.21. he said, This is my
Covenant with them, says the Lord, my Spirit which is upon thee, and my Words
which I have put into thy Mouth shall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of
the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed's Seed, says the Lord,
from hence forth and for evermore. [Mark] This Law and Spirit within, the New
Covenant, the New Testament Way, testified of in the Scriptures of Truth, to be
an Everlasting Covenant; this we own to be a Perfect Rule for all men to walk
by, unto the End of the World, and none other. And for a third Covenant, or
third Testament Way, I know none assert it; therefore I shall not trouble my
self to contend about it; but shall leave that part of his Book for those whom
it concern, if there be any; though I cannot well but observe, that he has
offered many foolish, falacious and ignorant Arguments; pretending thereby to
prove the New Testament Way still in force, and to be so to the End, which I
have already granted (and shall be ready so to do at all times) but still he
mistakes the matter, by putting the Dead Letter in the place of the Quickening
Spirit; and directs people to the Letter for Life, when its only the Spirit
that gives Life, as before is signified; and so he stumbleth at the
Stumbling-Stone; a Rock, which many have run against, and have been split.

And so after he has rumbled over diverse sylogistical Argments, which serve to
signify, that he loves to hear himself talk Logic; thereby still laboring to
prove, That no Third Covenant, or third Testament Way is to be expected, for
which cause the Second is to stand in force unto the End, etc. He then, in page
42. of his Book, comes to lay down some sad Consequences, Which will (as he
says) follow by denying the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and by making
them insufficient as a Rule in order to Man's Salvation; and first, (says he)
It takes away the general Ground of Faith from all men. 2dly, It denies the
Ground of Faith for the Remission of sins. 3dly, It makes void the Exercises
of Faith in the precious Promises of God; for what has Faith to exercise it
self in, but only the Promises of God in the Scriptures? 4thly, It denies the
Comforts of Faith; for all the Comforts that Faith can bring to the soul, must
be brought from the precious Promises of God in the Scripture. 5thly, It
Destroys the Support and Supplies of Grace to the Soul in a time of
Affliction; and to deny the Scripture to be the Word of God, is to deny the
Fountain and Wellspring of Comforts to the Soul. 6thly, It denies the
Knowledge of Acceptance with God. 7thly, If the Scriptures be denied to be the
Word of God, and thereby made insufficient as a Rule, etc. then all men are
left in the dark; for no man is able to know that God will save any, but by his
Word, which is contained in the Scriptures; for this is the Word of Salvation,
or that which directs to the Means by which we shall obtain Life. 8thly,
Without this (meaning Scripture) we know not that there is any God, or Christ,
or Salvation by God in Christ, etc. Lastly, It leaves men to walk by Fancy or
Imagination, etc.

Answ. To all which I shall answer, That for as much as we (the People of God
called Quakers) do not assert or own a third Testament Way, which J.N. seems to
fight against and oppose; it would be as superfluous for me to reply to his
Sylogisms, as it has been in him to offer them; and I should (therein) but
answer a Fool according to his Folly, and so become like unto him, which I am
no way inclined to do; but shall proceed to examine, whether or no those
dreadful Consequences, asserted by J. N. will follow the denying of the
Scriptures to be the Word of God, and a Perfect Rule for all men to walk by,
and none other.

First, How does it take away the general ground of Faith from all men, to deny
the Scriptures to be the Word, and Rule, etc. seeing the Word is still owned to
be in being, and to be heard, which was the Ground and Author of the Faith of
Abraham, and the Holy Men of God, who believed before the Scriptures were
written? 2 Cor. 4.13.
And because they believed, therefore they spoke forth the Scriptures: by which
it appears, That the Faith, that was once delivered to the Saints (which we are
earnestly to contend for) was received by them through hearing of the Word,
before the Scriptures were written; and therefore the Scriptures were not the
Ground of their Faith: so that to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is
not to deny or take away the Ground of that Faith, which by the Spirit or Word
was once delivered to the Saints: For the Apostle, in 1 Cor. 12.^. declares the
Ground of the Faith which the Church had received (and which he labored in the
Word (which wrought mightily in him) for the building of them up in) to be the
Spirit, when he spoke of the diversity of Gifts which they had received; he
said, To another is given Faith by the same Spirit: And this does not at all
oppose or contradict that Scripture which says, Faith comes by Hearing, and
Hearing by the Word of God; because the Father, Word, and Spirit are one
Substance, and are not divided (but the Scripture is not one Substance with the
Father and Spirit) so that he who hears the Word hears the Father and the
Quickening Spirit also.

And this Author of Faith (as I said before) was heard and believed before the
Scriptures were written; and remains the same this day as yesterday, and the
same forever, a Foundation of Faith that stands sure, and is not a far off
from every one, but is nigh, even the Word nigh thee, in thy Heart and in thy
Mouth; and this is the Word of Faith which the Apostle preached, and which we
preach, by the hearing of which Faith comes: so that denying the Scriptures to
be the Word is not to deny the Ground and Foundation of true Faith; neither is
it in the least to under-value the holy Scriptures, which so frequently
testify of the Ground, and Foundation; and Author of the true Faith.

Secondly, And as for his affirming, That to deny the Scriptures to be the
Word, is to deny the Ground of Faith for the Remission of sins.

Answ. I answer No; if the Word be the Ground (as most true it is) the Ground
is not denied by denying Scriptures to be the Word; because the Scriptures,
which testify of the Word, are before proved not to be the Word.

And they which had the Seal of Acceptance with God, had (without Controversy)
the Seal of Remission of sins; because, without Remission there can be no
Acceptance, But the Servants of God had the Seal or Testimony of Acceptance
with God, even some before any part of the Scriptures were written, as Abel,
Enoch, Abraham, etc. therefore the Scriptures were not the Ground of Faith for
the Remission of sins, but the Word which was before the Scriptures were
written: so that to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is not to deny
the Ground of Faith for the Remission of sins.

And the Prophet David, who sometime complained, Psalm. 38.4. That his
Iniquities were gone over his head as a Burden too heavy for him to bear;
afterward declared, Psalm. 103.12. That as far as the East is from the West, so
far had the Lord removed his Transgressions from him: Now where did the
Scriptures tell him that his Iniquities were put so far from him? Or how were
they the Ground of this Faith by which he thus spoke, and by which he had this
Evidence of the Remission or Removing of his sins? Was not the Word, which was
settled in the Heavens, and which was a Light to his Feet, etc. the Ground of
this Faith: Which Word healed him when he was in Distress, and when his Wounds
stunk because of his Folly; which Word still remains, and is owned as the
Ground of Faith for the Remission of sins, though the Scriptures be not
acknowledged to be the Word.

Thirdly, And for his saying, It makes void the Exercises of Faith in the
precious Promises of God; for, what has Faith to exercise it self, but only
the Promises of God in Scripture, etc.

Answ. I answer, The true Faith, which Christ is the Author of, has the Power
of God (in which it stands) to exercise it self in, as the Objects thereof;
through which Power of God (which is the Gospel) Life and Immortality is
brought to Light, 2 Timothy 1.10. as Fruit of that Faith which stands in Christ
the Power; so that Virtue and Knowledge is thereby added to the Faith, by which
the true Believer is built up in his Holy Faith: so that denying the Scriptures
to be the Word does not make void the Exercises of Faith, nor take away the
Ground in which true Faith stands, as J. N. vainly imagines; because the
Scripture is not the Power of God, in which the true Faith stands: Neither
does it follow, as J. N. asserteth, That Faith must be exercised in Scripture,
or else upon Fancy and Imagination; because it may be exercised in the Power of
God, as in the true Ground thereof, which is neither Scripture, nor
Imagination, nor Fancy; for the Apostle said, That his Speech and Preaching was
not with enticing words of man's Wisdom, but in Demonstration of the Spirit and
of Power, that their Faith might not stand in the Wisdom of Man, but in the
Power of God, 1 Cor. 2.4, 5. And in this are the Exercises of that true Faith,
which (by the Spirit or Word) was once delivered to the Saints, and which we
now earnestly contend for. But J. N. by this Assertion signifies that he is a
Stranger to the Power of God, in which true Faith stands, and therefore we
may rationally conclude, That he is also Reprobate concerning that Faith which
Christ the Power of God is the Author and Object of.

Fourthly, He says, It denies the Comforts of Faith; for all Comforts that
Faith can bring to the soul, must be brought from the Promises of God,
according as they are laid down in the Scripture, etc.

Answ. Here J.N. absolutely limits God, without any Ground or Reason, or
Warrant for so doing; as though God, who is the Fountain of all true Comfort,
could not convey true Comfort to the soul of a Believer by his Faith, but he
must first fetch it from the Scripture; and so in effect the Scripture must be
set above God, or at least, in the Place of God.

But what Scripture J. N. has to prove this his absurd Affirmation, I know
not; he has produced none to prove that, nor indeed any of the sad
Consequences, which he says will follow the denying the Scriptures to be the
Word of God, and Perfect Rule, etc. we have only his bare word for it; but
whether that be of sufficient authority to enduce us to believe his Assertions,
I leave to the juditious Reader to judge; seeing that Christ said to the Woman
of Samaria, That the Water that he would give, should be in him that received
it as a Well springing up to Eternal Life, Joh. 4.14. and again, Joh. 7.38, 39.
said, He that believes on Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his Belly
shall flow Rivers of Living Water: But this spake-he of the Spirit, which they
that believe on him should receive. [Mark Reader] The Spirit that they should
receive that believed on him (and whose Faith stood in the Power of God) was
that Living Water that should be in them springing up unto Eternal Life, or
that should flow up in them through Faith; and this Comfort their Faith did not
fetch from Scripture, but by their Faith was known to dwell in them, as their
Everlasting Comforter, that was to abide with them forever, even the Spirit of
Truth, according as Christ promised, Jo. 14.16, 17. so that to deny the
Scripture to be the Word, is not to deny the Comforts of Faith, because that
the true Comforter was known by Faith, and is known by Faith to remain though
the Scripture may be taken away; and yet it does not deny the Comfort of the
Scripture neither, unto those who have the understanding thereof.

Fifthly, J. N. says, It destroys the Support and Supplies of Grace to the
soul in a time of Affliction, etc. and to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of
God, is to deny the very Foundation and Wellspring of Comforts to the soul in
Affliction, which is brought out of the Promises in the Scriptures to the soul,
etc.

Answ. This Assertion is like the former, only the last part thereof somewhat
more gross Blasphemy, without any Scripture Argument to prove any part thereof,
only his own Assertion, as in the rest, though full contrary to the Testimony
of the Prophet, who speaking of the Affliction of the soul said, When the Enemy
shall come in like a Flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a Standard
against him: That was the Support and Relief of the soul in the time of its
Affliction, according to the Prophets Testimony; and the same Support the
Children of Light do still witness, whose Faith stands in the Power of God, and
whose Trust is in that Name which is a strong Tower.

And for his calling the Scriptures the very Fountain and Wellspring of
Comforts, etc. Its gross Blasphemy, and a Robbing of God, who is a Spirit, and
who is the Fountain of all Good, whose Spirit (as before showed) is in them
that believe as a Well springing up unto Eternal Life; for the Scriptures no
where call themselves the Fountain, nor have the holy Men of God so called
them; but they testify of him-who is the Fountain of all Good: Neither are
they in them selves any where called the Wellspring of Comforts; but they
testify of the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter, that it shall be in them that
believe, a Well springing up unto Eternal Life: so that J. Newman to make good
his Argument, if he could, Blasphemously puts the Dead Letter in the place
of God, and in the place of the Living Spirit.

Sixthly, He says, It denies the Knowledge of Acceptance with God; for if the
Scriptures be denied to be the Word of God, then who knows what God will
accept, etc? and who knows what God counts sin and wickedness, etc.

Answ. To which I answer, This is in part answered already; for Enoch, etc. had
this Testimony, That he pleased God, Heb. 11.5. before the Scriptures were
written; and that Testimony was the Seal of Acceptance with God, which I dare
affirm every true Believer will acknowledge; and this Testimony of Acceptance
he did not receive from Scripture; for there was none; but he obtained it by
Faith, which the Word (that was in the Beginning) was the Author of, as the
Apostle said, He that believes has the Witness in himself, 1 John 5.10. by
which it appears, That the Knowledge of Acceptance, or the Seal of being
Well-pleasing unto God, is not the Scriptures, but the Spirit of Faith.

But that J. N. and others, may see the Confusion that he runs into while he is
fighting against the Truth, I insert his own words in the 77th page of his
Book, and compare them with this Assertion; he says, I shall freely own the
giving forth of his blessed Spirit into the Hearts of his Children, whereby
they are directed into his Most Holy Will, by the enlightening of their spirits
by that Holy Spirit of Promise, by which they know their Adoption; and also, by
the same Spirit can own God to be their Father, etc.

Thus far are his own words, by which the Reader may easily judge whether or no
J-N. does not speak absolutely contrary to the Belief or Persuasion of his
mind, in saying, If the Scriptures be denied to be the Word of God, it denies
the Knowledge of Acceptance; and who then knows what God accounts sin and
wickedness, etc. I say, let the Reader but compare his Confession concerning
the Spirit with his Assertion concerning the Scripture, and he shall see his
Contradition sufficiently; for, if the giving forth of the Spirit directs
into the Knowledge of the Most Holy Will of the Father, then by the same
Spirit, what is contrary to that must absolutely be known also; and how then
can it be said, that without Scriptures be owned to be the Word of God, the
Ground of the Knowledge of Acceptance with God is denied; seeing that which
manifests the will of the Father, manifests that which is acceptable to him,
and thereby its known? And all this may be known by the Spirit, as J. N.
confesses, to the wounding of his own Work. And indeed, What he has
acknowledged is to be known by the Spirit, is even enough for any man to know,
or enough to give Satisfaction to every Soul, who breathes after the Knowledge
of Acceptance with God: For what can give more satisfaction to a man, then to
know the holy Will of God by his Spirit, and to know his Adoption, and to know
that God is his Father? Certainly there is no cause for him that has this
Knowledge to question his Acceptance with God: And this may be known without
Scripture, even by the holy Spirit of Promise, as J.N. confesses: therefore to
deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, does not deny the Knowledge of
Acceptance with God; and thus out of his own Mouth he is judged.

Seventhly, He says, If the Scriptures be denied to be the Word of God, etc.
then all men are left in the dark, etc. for no man is able to know that God
will save any, but by his Word, which is contained in the Scriptures; for this
is the Word of Salvation, or that which directs to the Means by which we
shall obtain Life, etc.

Answ. That none are able to know that God will save any, but by this Word,
that I shall easily acknowledgd; because its the Word only that is able to
save: but that the Scriptures are this Word, or alone able to save, that I do
not acknowledge, but deny; and J. N. has produced no Proof for his Assertion,
but only his own Affirmation, nor indeed can he: although he boldly says, They
are the Word of Salvation, yet they no where say so of themselves; but they
testify of the Word of Salvation, and That it was sent unto the Children of
Abraham, and unto all amongst them that feared God, Acts 13.26. [Mark] This was
not the Scriptures that were sent amongst them; but the Word of Salvation, or
that Word which is able to save, Jam. 1.21. which the Apostle there besought
the Children of Abraham to receive with Meekness, calling it the Ingrafted
Word, or as some English Translations have it, The Word that is grafted in you:
so this is the Word that is able to save, the Word of Salvation, the Word of
Faith in the Heart, etc. which Word was in the Beginning, the Author of the
Faith of the Fathers; by which Jacob knew that God would save, even before
Scriptures were written, which made him say ( Genesis 49.18.) O Lord, I have
waited for thy Salvation: By all which it appears, That to deny the Scriptures
to be the Word of God, does not leave men so in the dark, as J. N. affirms,
but that they are still in a capacity to know that God will save; and also to
see the Salvation of God, which is promised to them that order their
Conversation aright.

And whereas he says, That the Scriptures direct to the Means by which we
shall obtain Life.

I Answer, I shall easily acknowledge that; for, as I have before said, they
contain many true Testimonies of him, who is the alone Leader unto Life; and
they are profitable for Doctrine, for Instruction, etc. that people may be
directed to Christ the Way, which they testify of; and that they may be turned
from Darkness to the Light, which discovers the Darkness; and that they may
come to receive with Meekness the ingrafted Word, or the word which is grafted
in them, by it to be taught, and led unto the Possession of Life; for this is
the Means by which Life is obtained, which the Scriptures testify of, and
direct unto; and for this Work we own the Scriptures to be profitable.

But this does not run parallel with the Affirmation of J. N. in the 24th page
of his Book, where he affirms, That Life was in the Scriptures; for its one
thing to say, that there is Life therein; and another thing to say, they direct
to the Means by which Life is obtained. If John Newman asserted no other thing
then the latter, there had been no Controversy about this Point; for, so far
we own the Scriptures: But his Confusion shows what his spirit is, oft-tmes
contradicting and opposing himself, as is usual with those that oppose the
Unchangeable Truth.

But I perceive, an Objection may arise in the Ignorant concerning this thing,
That if the Word which is able to save, be grafted in people, and be nigh unto
all, even in the Heart and Mouth; why then are not all saved? or, why do not
all see the Salvation of God? or, why did the Apostle Exhort them to receive it
with Meekness, if it were in them already?

I Answer, though the Word, or Spirit, (which is one) was in them, yet they
being disobedient thereunto, did not receive it, or had not received it; but
had always resisted it, as the Apostle tells them, Acts 7.51. and so were like
unto those that Job spoke of, saying; They are of them that rebel against the
Light, who know not the Way of it, etc. Job 24.13. so that although the Word,
or Light, or Spirit be in a people, and they rebel against it, or resist the
reproofs and Instructions thereof, or do dispite to the strivings thereof; how
can such be said to have received it, for they only receive the Word, and the
Spirit, that receive the Reproofs and Instructions thereof, and in them it is
known to be a Spirit, or Prince of Peace, and a Word of Life, and Consolation,
and such know their Beloved to lie all might betwixt their Breasts; but although
he be nigh even in the hearts of many, they cannot be said to receive him,
while they rebel against him; and therefore they are not saved, but condemned
by him; For this is the condemnation that Light is come, and men love Darkness
rather then Light, Joh. 3.19. and though he lights every man that comes into
the World; yet its only they that receive him, (the Light) that he gives Power
unto, Joh. 1.12. by which it appears that all that were englightned by him, did
not receive him, so that the Light, the Word; the Spirit, may be in people, and
yet they that received it, but reject it in its Reproofs, Counsels, and
Instructions, and therefore they are not saved by it, but condemned; for which
cause it was needful for the Apostle to Labor to turn them from Darkness to
the Light, wherewith they were enlightened, and to Exhort them to receive with
meekness, the engrafted Word, or to submit unto the operation of the Word that
was in them, that by it they might be saved; for none experimentally knows its
ability to save, but they, who receive the Reproofs, and Instructions of it,
and are Doers, or Obeyers thereof; and such are taught thereby (as by the
Universal Grace, which has appeared unto all men, which brings salvation) to
order their Conversation aright, through which they come to see the great
Salvation of God.

Eighthly, Now I come to the eighth, sad Consequence that J. N. says will
follow denying the Scripture to be the Word of God, Without this (says he) we
know not that there is any God, or Christ, etc. neither do we know what God
counts unclean, or what he counts holy, etc.

Answ. If by what God counts Unclean, and what Holy, he means the things
appertaining to the Life and Conversation of People, then the denial of
Scripture to be the Word of God does not hinder People from knowing what is
Unclean and what is Holy: Notwithstanding, we cannot own the Scriptures to be
the Word; yet we own that to be unclean which is so accounted in the Scriptures
of Truth in the Gospel Dispensation, and that to be holy which in them is so
accounted, and that the one ought to be chosen and the other refused: but if
there were no Scriptures in being, yet are people in the same capacity to
receive the Knowledge of those things, as they were before the Scriptures were
written; or as the Gentiles were, who had not the outward Law, yet in Life and
Conversation showed forth the Works of the Law that was written in their
Hearts; and if those Gentiles were now here, they would condemn the Ignorance
of J. N. who says, Without Scripture none know whether there be a God, or what
he counts Unclean, and what Holy: For all the Heathen Poets and Philosophers,
who had not the Scriptures, generally acknowledged a Supreme Power and Being,
which all were to be subject to, some calling of it by one name, and some
another; but while they acknowledged the thing, it is sufficient to signify,
that if the Scriptures were not in being, yet People might know that there is
a God: And they are not only in the capacity that the Gentiles were, who knew
and confessed, That there was a God, and showed forth the Works of the Law
written in their Hearts; but also, in the capacity that the Fathers of old
were; who did not only know that there was a God, but knew the only true God,
and were the acceptable Worshippers of him before Scriptures were written.

And these things I speak not in the least to under-value the Scriptures, or
out of a slight esteem of them; for they are very profitable for Instruction,
etc. and so I own them, and have great esteem of them; yet if people have no
more Knowledge then what they carnally receive therefrom, I may say as the
Apostle said, That what they know, they know naturally, as bruit Beasts; and
indeed, knew nothing as they ought to know: And those that he thus spoke to had
the Scriptures, that were then in being; yet had not the Knowledge of God,
which he spoke to their shame, 1 Cor. 15.34. So that the End of my thus
speaking is, to enduce people not to rest in a Notional or Traditional
Knowledge concerning God, which is fecht into the Comprehension out of
Scripture by the Wisdom that is from below; but that all may incline unto the
Inspiration of the Almighty, which gives Knowledge, and wait in the Light
which shines in the Darkness; or take heed unto the Word in the Heart, as unto
a Light that shines in a Dark place, until the Day Star arise there, that will
expel the Darkness, by which the Understanding has been clouded; and until the
Light shine out of the Darkness, which gives the Knowledge of the glory God in
the Face of Christ Jesus: And this is that Knowledge which is saving, and is of
concernment for all to come to; because (whatsoever notional Knowledge they
have) they that have not the Knowledge of God, shall be punished with
Everlasting Destruction from his Presence, 2 These. 1.8, 9.

Ninthly, And Lastly, J. N. says, That to deny the Scriptures to be the Word
of God, etc. is to leave men to walk by Fancy or Imagination, leaving that holy
Rule, wherein Life and Salvation is declared, etc.

Answ. This is but like the rest (viz.) His own Assertion, without farther
Proof: But whether denying the Scriptures to be the Word of God, be to deny
them to be believed, as containing true Testimonies concerning the Word (for so
I have always owned them) I may leave to the Reader to judge; and how it
leaves men to walk by Fancy or Imagination (while J. N. himself says, That the
Blessed Spirit directs into the Knowledge of the most holy Will of the
Father, and that thereby the Adoption is known, and God owned, etc.) seems very
strange; for, the Light and Spirit reproves all Imaginations and Fancies, and
leads into all Truth those who receive the Reproofs and Instructions thereof:
And therefore the denying of the Scripture to be the Word, while the Word in
the Heart (which the Scripture testifies of) is owned; people are not left to
walk by Imagination, but by the Word, which is a Light to the Feet of those who
take heed unto their Ways, according to the leadings of it: And the Help and
Comfort that is to be found in the Scriptures People are not deprived of
neither, though they are not owned to be the Word: So that J. N. hereby and
others, may see plainly that those sad consequences do not follow the denying
the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and Rule, etc. as J. N. vainly imagined,
and boldly without Proof affirmed: And what do all those Affirmations signify
more then this, That J. Newman (for all his large Profession of Knowledge and
Understanding) is ignorant of the Holy Spirit, Power and Word of God, without
which none can be born again? And so himself is found in the
Unregenerate-state, and worshipping according to the oldness of the Letter; a
Blind Leader of the Blind, which all are to beware of; for its such that lead
people captive laden with Sins and diverse Lusts, always learning, but never
able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, which sets free, and which
sanctifies, which is the Word, as Christ said, John 17.17. but labors to keep
them from enclining to the sanctifying Word, which the Prophet declared should
be their Teacher, which their Ears would hear behind, saying, This is the Way,
walk in it; when they turn to the Right Hand, or to the left, Isa. 30.21.

And thus having briefly gone through with the principal Scriptures and
Arguments produced by him, to prove the Scriptures to the Word of God, and
Perfect Rule, etc. and with the sad Consequences which he affirmed would follow
by denying of them so to be: I shall leave it to the Reader to judge, 1st,
Whether the Word, so often spoken of, as before, may be understood to be the
Scripture? or 2dly, Whether that Word may not be understood to be that which
was before the Scriptures were written, which so oft-times came unto the
Prophets, by virtue of which they gave forth the Scriptures? and 3dly, Whether
the Rule of the New Covenant be the Scriptures, called the New Testament? or
4thly, Whether the Rule of the New Testament be not the Law written in the
Heart, even the Law of that Spirit which the Apostle said was the New
Testament? and 5thly, Whether those sad Consequences do follow by denying the
Scriptures to be the Word, or no, as J. N. has affirmed?

Concerning Christ being the Word of God.
AND now I shall come to the next thing which he insists upon, which is, Christ
being the Word of God; in which I observe he will own, That he is called so,
but he is not really so, page 49. and that he is called by many Names
comparatively, as a Door, a Vine, an Ensign, a Star, a Lamb, etc. but yet he is
not really any of these, page 50.

Answ. What absurdities are here? might not J. N. as well have said that though
Christ is called Christ, yet he is not really so? and although he is called a
Savior, yet he is not really so? has he not the same ground for the one, as
the other? If Christ be not really what he said he was, is it not to make him a
Liar? whether is it more safe to believe what Christ said himself was, or to
believe what John Newman says he was? For J. N. altogether contradicts
Christ's sayings in Scripture concerning himself; for Christ says, Joh. 15.1.
I am the True Vine; But J. N. says, in the 50. Page of his Book: he is not a
Vine. Certainly the greatest Truth that I can perceive demonstrated in this
matter, is, That J. N. is no Branch of the True Vine, nor yet grafted into it;
for if he had been a Branch in the Vine (or a member in the Body that holds the
Head) he would have known that Christ is really a Vine; and he would have also
known that he is really all those things which he said of himself, and which
they that knew what he was to them, said of him; and that it is by the
diversities of the Operations of this one Lord, that he is known to be really
all those things, but J. N. has sufficiently declared himself to be a stranger
to the diversities of the operations of this one Lord, by denying him to be
really what he affirms himself to be; and so has given Christ the Lie, of
which let him repent, before it be to late.

But what is the cause that he thus works, and shuffles, and denis Christ before
men, to be what he said he was, and what they that knew the diversities of his
operations declared him to be? is it not to take away the Key of Knowledge, to
hinder them from going in at this Door, that are entering? is it not to keep
people from believing, that the operation of the Word in the Heart (which is a
Hammer knocking for resception) is the appearance of Christ, lest they should
be converted thereto, by its own operation, and thereby be healed of all their
putrefying sores? and is not this to do the Divel's work, to shut Christ and
his saving Power out of his People, as though he whom the Apostle said,
ascended far above all Heavens that he might fill all things, could be
circumscribed only to a Body of Flesh? [Mark] he did not only say, that he
ascended into Heaven; neither do I deny, (but acknowledge) that he sits at the
right Hand of God in Heaven: But he also said, that he ascended far above all
Heavens, that he might fill all things: And because he fills all things,
therefore None need say, who shall ascend into Heaven to fetch Christ from
above, or who shall descend into the deep to fetch him up, etc? for the Word is
nigh unto thee in thy Mouth; and in thy Heart, which is incomprehensible, and
fills all things; so that all may look unto him and be saved, even to the
Word, which is really the Word, and is able to save the Soul even to the
uttermost from all iniquity whatsoever; but J. N. would not have this Word to
be properly Christ, by any means, but shifts, and shuffles, and wrests the
Scripture; and brings in his Meanings, as though they were of more credit, then
the plain words of Scripture; and would fain put out our Eyes with his Atoms:
But in the true Light, which makes all things manifest, he is seen,
comprehended and denied to be any true Follower of Christ, or Branch of the
true Vine, or spiritual Worshipper.

But then (in the 50. Page of his Book) where he affirms, that Christ is not
really the Word; though so called (he says) there is an objection brought
against this Truth in Joh. 1.1. where the Evangelist says; In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the word was God; from whence
(says he) they object, and say, That Christ was the Word from the beginning;
which thing (says he) I cannot grant; for this place does not prove, Christ,
as Christ, to be the Word from the beginning; but it proves the Word to be God
from the beginning, for Christ was not Christ in the beginning, but the Word
was God in the beginning; but Christ was in time, when the God head had taken
Flesh to it self, and not before, etc. And in page 51. he says, It cannot be
understood, that Christ, as Christ, should be the Word of God, from, or in the
beginning; or yet called the Word of God; for he was not Christ till he took to
himself Flesh in the Womb of Mary; therefore Christ, as Christ, could not be
the Word of God from the beginning.

Answ. Mark Reader, whether or no the Affirmations of J. N. do not frequenly
contradict the Testimonies of Christ and his Servants; for the Apostle,
speaking of the spiritual Rock, which followed Israel, of which they all drunk,
said, That Rock was Christ, 1 Cor. 10.4. But J. N. affirms, That Christ was not
Christ till he took to himself Flesh, etc. Therefore he contradicts the
Apostle's Testimony, who said, That Rock was Christ; and therefore is not to be
received.

Again, The Apostle said (by virtue of the Revelation of the Father) That
Christ was the Son of God, Mat. 16.16, 17. Thou art the Son of God: And this
Christ the Son of God, was glorified with the Father before the World was: For
that was Christ that said, Glorify thy Son with the same Glory that he had
with thee, etc. Therefore Christ was Christ before the World was, and before he
took to himself Flesh.

And whereas J. N. says; He cannot grant that Christ was the Word from the
Beginning.

Answ. That does not at all weaken the Testimony of John, who said, The Word
was with God in the Beginning; for his Testimony does as much prove, That
Christ was the Word in the Beginning, as it does, That the Word was God; and J.
N. in effect confesses it; but that he is blinded, being a Stranger to the
Spirit that gives Understanding, and being gone from the Scriptures (which
elsewhere he seems so much to applaud) into his own Imaginations and Fancies;
for says he, He was not Christ till he took to himself Flesh; and he that took
to himself Flesh, he acknowledges to be the Word, by which he confessed,
Christ was the Word before he took Flesh; by which also in effect he
acknowledges, That the Flesh that he took in the Womb of the Virgin, was not
Christ, but the Flesh that Christ took; thus much his own words import; but I
know he will not like to hear of it, because it so deeply wounds his own
Cause.

And so after J. N. has rumbled through many Non-sensical Arguments, laboring
thereby to prove, That Christ is not really the Word of God, but only
comparatively so called, etc. he finds another Objection in p. 56. brought
against his Affirmation, And is (says he) in 1 Pet. 1.23. where the Apostle
says, Being born again, not of corruptible, but of incorruptible, by the Word
of God which lives and abides forever: Which Word, says the Objector, is
Christ; and the great Reason that is urged, is, Because it lives and abides
forever: But (says he) these words make nothing to prove this Word here to be
Christ; for (says he) the Apostle says in verse. 25. The Word of the Lord
endures forever; and this is the Word which by the Gospel is preached unto
you. (And from hence J. N. argues) That the Preachings of the Apostles
according to the Gospel, was that Word by which they were born again, and which
endures forever.

Answ. To which I answer, as sometime before upon occasion have said, There is
a difference betwixt the the Thing Preached, and the Preachings of the Thing;
and betwixt the Thing Witnessed or Testified of, and the Testimony or Witness
concerning the Thing: So that although the Apostle, by the Gospel, (which is
the Power of God) preached the Word, and preached Christ; yet the Preachings or
Declarations of the Apostle cannot properly be called Christ, who is without
beginning of Days or end of Life; nor can they properly be called the Word,
which abides forever; and so cannot be concluded to be that by which they were
born again: This Shift will not serve the turn of J. N. to persuade us, That
the Word which the Apostle preached was not Christ, or that Christ was not that
Word by which they were born again; for, when ever he preached the Word he
preached Christ; and yet his Preachings were neither the Word preached, nor yet
Christ; but Christ preached was the Word by which they were born again, which
lives and abides forever, as is evident by the Scripture before mentioned,
which proves a Block too heavy for J. N. to remove out of his way.

Again, In page 57. he says, This Word cannot be understood of Christ, because
it is here called the Seed.

Answ. Yet it may be understood of Christ, and cannot otherwise be rightly
understood of Christ; because, as the Apostle said, Gal. 3.16. The Seed is
Christ.

Again, In page 58. he says thus, Neither do I go about to rob Christ of his
Title, but do acknowledge him to be called the Word of God comparatively, as he
is the Father's Mouth, and speaks the Father's words, etc.

Answ. Hereby we may perceive that J. N. will not own Christ to be the Word, no
more then in effect he owns the Prophets and Apostles to be the Word; for he
owns Christ to be the Word but comparatively, and not really so, and but as he
is the Father's Mouth to speak the Father Words, and so were the Prophets and
Apostles the Father's Mouth, and spoke his words, as the Spirit gave them
utterance: So that if he was called the Word only because of that, every one of
the Prophets may be as well called the Word also, because they were his Mouth,
and spoke his words.

But what Absurdities are these, that J. N. runs into, to make Christ not to be
the Word, really so? I must needs acknowledge he exceeds (in one thing) all
sorts of People professing Christianity, that ever I spoke with, or heard of;
for I never heard of any, nor spoke with any, but would acknowledge Christ to
be really the Substantial Word, though they will (many of them) plead for the
Scripture to be the Word (or as some style it, the Material Word) also: But J.
N. affirms the Scriptures to be properly and principally the Word, and Christ
but comparatively the Word, and not really so: So that he out-strips all (in
promoting the Scriptures, and in under-valuing Christ) that ever I heard of;
and it is not his wresting of Scriptures, and jumbling his own Intepretations
and Imaginations amongst them, that will effect his Design, or will prove
Christ not to be the Word of God, really so; nor yet to be Christ before he
took Flesh, etc. For the Testimonies of himself, and of his Servants concerning
him, (which J. N. by his Imaginations labors to make of none effect) will
stand valuable and credible, viz. That Christ, who (as J. Newman confesses)
took Flesh in the Womb of the Virgin, was the Word with God in the Beginning;
and that the Rock which followed Israel was Christ, before he took Flesh; and
that this Word which by the Gospel the Apostle preached, was Christ which he
preached; and that the preachings, declarations, or words of the Apostles were
not the Word preached; and that the Word preached (and not the Preachings of
it) was that by which they were born again, and which lived forever; and that
the true Christ was the Son glorified with the Father before the World was, and
is without Beginning of Days or End of Life; the Root of David, and his
Offspring also; the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End, and the Joy
of many Generations; the Quickening Spirit that dwells in his People; the
express Image of the Father's Substance, whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot
contain, who is ascended far above all Heavens that he might fill all things,
who is the Light of the Gentiles, and the Glory of Israel: This is my Beloved,
and this is my Friend; and he that has an Ear to hear, let him hear.

Concerning Christ Within being the true Savior.
THe next thing he undertakes, is, (page 60.) to prove that the true Christ
does not dwell in any man, as he is Christ, but instead of so doing, he goes
about to prove, that the Body of the true Christ, that he took upon him, and in
which he suffered, rose again out of the Sepulcher, and that it does not dwell
in man; and so (as in diverse things before) he appears like one that beats the
air, or that loves to hear himself talk; for he opposes that, which I know
none affirm; and affirms that, which none, that I know of, deny; for I know
none that deny that his Body was raised out of the Sepulcher; nor none that
affirm that Body to dwell in man; so that I am not concerned to take farther
notice of those things; though the true Christ, which was the Rock, that
followed Israel in the Wilderness, and that was the Son glorified with the
Father before the World was, for whom that Body was prepared to do the Father's
Will in, who is ascended where he was before, and is again glorified with the
same Glory that he had with the Father in the Beginning; who is ascended far
above all Heavens, that he might fill all things: This true Christ (I say) I
must own to be a Quickening Spirit, and to dwell in man; and this is that
Intercessor which the Apostle spoke of, saying, Romans 8.26, 27. But the Spirit
it self makes Intercession for us with Groanings, which cannot be uttered: And
he that searches the Heart knows the mind of the Spirit; because he makes
Intercession for the Saints, according to the Will of God.

And although it be asserted by J. N. That Christ is with the Father, and sits
at the Right Hand of the Father in Heaven with a Body of Flesh; and therefore
cannot be in man.

Answ. I answer, I do not deny that he sits at the Right Hand of the Father in
Heaven, with that very Flesh and Blood which gives Life Eternal to all that
partake thereof: but J. N. has no Proof for his being there with an Humane
Body of Flesh and Blood, that cannot inherit the Kingdom.

But what! Does his being at the Right Hand of God in Heaven hinder his
In-dwelling in man, more then it hinders his being in the Bosom of the Father?
Might he not as well have said, That he cannot be in the Bosom of the Father
(as John testified, cap. 1. verse. 18.) because he sits at his Right Hand, as
say, he cannot be in man, because he is there? Or might he not as well have
said, He cannot be at the Right Hand of the Father, because he is in the
Father's Bosom? For, by what he has said, he appears to exclude him out of his
People (who is the Image of the Father, which the Heaven of Heavens cannot
contain) and to confine him only to a Body of Flesh; though the Apostle said
plainly, That he ascended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things,
Ephesians. 4.10. by which it may plainly be understood, That his being at the
Right Hand of the Father, and in the Bosom of the Father, does no way hinder
his being in man; but as he is at the Right Hand of the Father, and in the
Bosom of the Father, so he is in man also: And they that know not this Christ
in them, they are Reprobates, as the Apostle said, 2 Cor. 13.5.

Again, In page 65. of his Book he says thus, If he did ascend as Jesus, or a
Savior, then he had a Body of Flesh; for he was not Jesus, or a Savior, as he
was God, but as he was Man

Answ. That he ascended as he was Jesus and a Savior, I own; but it does not
therefore follow, That God was not a Savior; for, although J. N. boldly and
blasphemously affirms (without any Proof, as his usual manner is) that he was
not a Savior as he was God, but as he was man: Yet it is easy to prove the
contrary; because the Word which was with God in the beginning, and which was
God, is able to save; and therefore is a Savior as he is God, and also as the
Word manifested in the Flesh (the Man Christ Jesus, who is God's Salvation) for
the diversity of Names does not add to his Ability, but to express his Dignity,
and the diversity of his Operations, the diversity of Names has been given
him; and yet still is the same Lord under either of these Names, or in either
of his Operations, whom the Prophet said should come forth of Bethlehem
Ephratah, to be Ruler in Israel, Whose Goings forth (says he) have been from
of Old, from Everlasting, Mich. 5.2. [Mark] Is not Christ he that is to be
Ruler in Israel? And is it not he that is the Savior? Then the Goings-forth of
the Savior have been from of Old, even from Everlasting; therefore he is a
Savior as he is God, and was so before he took Flesh.

And if this be too little to give satisfaction, That he is a Savior as he is
God, or that he was a Savior before he took upon him Flesh, then take farther
the sayings of God himself by his Prophets (and if you will not hear them, you
will not hear though one arise from the Dead) Hosea 13.4. Thou shall know no
God but Me; for there is no Savior besides Me: And again, In Isa. 43.11. he
says, I, even I, am the Lord; and besides Me there is no Savior: By all which
it appears sufficiently that he is a Savior, as he is God; and that his
ascending as a Savior does not prove that either the Spirit (or God) was not
the Savior, or that the Flesh simply was the Savior; because it appears he
was a Savior before he took Flesh upon him; and is Christ the same this day as
yesterday, and the same forever, the Spirit that quickens; For the Flesh
profits nothing, as Christ himself said, and therefore can be no Savior,
Joh. 6.63.

And Isa. 45.21, 22. he says, There is no God else besides me, a just God, and
a Savior; look unto me, and be ye saved, etc. [Mark Reader,] beside the
Savior there is no God, as says God himself by the Prophet; so that if the
affimation of J. N. and other such Professors be true; That the body of Flesh
that Christ took (which in Scripture is called the body of Jesus) be the only
Savior; then the Prophets Words must be false, or else, there must be no God,
but the Body of Flesh, because, there is no God else but the Savior, as said
God; But to say, There is no God, but that body of Flesh that the Word took,
would be gross and horrid Blasphemy; but such is the effect of the Affirmation
of J. N. by which he may see his Ignorance, Presumption and Blasphemy; and this
may suffice forever to stop the Mouths of those who affirm the body of Flesh
that Christ took, to be the Savior, and do deny him to be a Savior as he is
God.

And that all may be informed where to look unto him (according to the
exhortation of the Prophet) and be saved, observe what the Prophet Amos says,
Chap. 4. verse. 13. he that declares unto man what is his thought, the God of
Hosts is his Name, and (Jer. 17.10.) I the Lord search the Heart, etc. by which
thou may understand that this is God the Savior, and Christ the quickening
Spirit ( for Christ is God, Romans 9.5.) that searches thy Heart, and shows
thee thy thoughts; though thou have thought him to be such an one as thy self,
and have set him at a distance in thy Imaginations; yet he is near at Hand unto
thee, (the Word in thy Heart, who is a Searcher thereof; and a Discerner of thy
thoughts, which he shows unto thee) that so thou may look unto him, to be led
and instructed by his good Spirit of Grace, which brings Salvation unto Light
in all who are taught thereby to order their Conversation aright, Psalm. 50.13.
and this is that free Grace which has appeared unto all men, Tit. 2.11, 12. by
which the primative Christians were taught (as by a standing Rule, according to
which they walked) And by which, through Faith they were saved, as the Apostle
testified Ephesians. 2.8. though many turned from this Grace into Wantonness, and did
dispite to the Spirit thereof, as they do at this day; And those are they that
Rebel against the Light wherewith every one is enlightened, and labors to
render it insufficient to save; not considering that this is that Grace that
has appeared to all, and by which they were saved, and which God said unto
Paul, was Sufficient for him; and so they trample under foot, that blood of the
everlasting Covenant, which is Drink indeed, by which they that walk in the
Light are cleansed from all sin.

But then he says (in page 68.) There is an Objection brought against him from
2 Cor. 5. where Paul says, Though he had known Christ after the Flesh, yet
henceforth know I him so no more. But in page 70. he says. The Apostle is so
far from denying to know Christ in a Body of Flesh, though Glorified, that he
does affirm the same to the Church of the Ephesians, Ephesians. 5.30. where he says,
We are Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone: but (says he) the Apostle did
not intend to know Christ in the Flesh attended with all those Infirmities as
he was subject to in his suffering Estate.

Answ. If by the Body of Flesh that Christ had, he means the Church which the
Apostle speaks of, which was the Body of which Christ (the Power and Word) was
Head, and they Members of, then I am one with him; for, his having that Body
(after his Ascension) I never denied, nor intend to do so: but that Body could
not be called the Savior; for Christ was the Savior of that Body, of which
they were Members, was yet on Earth: And the Apostle was not without
expectation of the same Sufferings (in measure) to attend Christ in those
Members of his Body, as had attended him before; for, in Col. 1.24. he says
thus, Who now Rejoice in my Suffering for you, and fill up that which is behind
of the Afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his Body's sake, which is the
Church; by which it appears, that Afflictions did still attend those Members of
Christ's Body, who (as J. N. confesses) was Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of
his Bone: And such a Body we own Christ had after his Ascension, and still
has, though not free (as yet) from suffering Afflictions; yet his Body shall
be fashioned like unto his glorious Body; which is not so confined, as he
vainly imagins they were Flesh of his Flesh, etc. This does not in the least
prove that Christ is not in man, but rather the contrary; for can it be
rationally concluded, that he should be at a distance from the Members of his
own Body? No certainly: If the Body be divided from the Head, it is no more a
perfect Body, but dead Members: So that Christ, the Head (the Quickening
Spirit) having men to be Members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bone, we
may rationally conclude (if we had no other Evidence) That he is not at a
distance from his Body, but present with them, and therefore in them, as
himself said, Joh. 14.17. He is with you, and shall be in you: And in verse 20.
At that day you shall know that I am in my Father [Mark, in the Bosom of the
Father] and you in me, and I in you.

Well Reader, There are many things remaining in this Book of J. N's concerning
Christ's being in man, and also out of him; to which an Answer might be
returned, to manifest his Ignorance and Confusion, which for brevity-sake I
shall omit; for it would fill too large a Volumn to publish to the World at
this time; especially, because those same things have been answered by us again
and again: yet I cannot well but observe some few things more, that his
Confusion and Opposing of himself may further appear.

Concerning the Spirit's Guidance.
IN page 84. speaking of the Spirit being given to the Saints, he says, It is
of the same Being of the Father and Son; and also of the same Nature, Power
and Tendency of both. And in page 54. he said, 'That Spirit is God.

Answ. If the Spirit given to the Saints, be of the same Being of the Father
and Son, as J. N. in this place truly affirms; then it is of the same
Substance of the Father and Son; for the same Being is the same Substance, and
the same Substance or Being is not divided into several Beeings; therefore if
the Spirit, which is of the same Being of the Father and Son be in man, then
the Father and Son is (according to the measure thereof) in men also.

And herein J. N. has contradicted his own sayings in page 78. where he tells
us of a distinct Being of God and Christ out of all men; For if a part of the
same Being of them be in man, how can it rationally be concluded that they are
a distinct Being from their own Being in Man?

[Mark Reader] I would not be mistaken, but rightly understood in this matter,
it being a matter of the greatest weight and moment: I do not oppose the Being
of God and Christ out of man, in the highest Heavens, nor in the lowest Hell,
because Infinite and Incorruptible; but his so being distinct, as to exclude
his Nature and Presence from man, thereby denying his In-dwelling, is the thing
which I oppose (and which J. N. has confounded himself about) because the
Being of God (who is a Spirit) and Christ, who is the Quickening Spirit,
cannot be divided [and J. N. in page 62. also says, Christ cannot be divided.]
And the Spirit of God, which is in man being of the same Being or Substance
with the Father and Son: All which is that Infinite Being or Substance, which
the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain; it cannot be said, they have not a Being
in man; but a measure of the same Being or Substance (which is not divided)
ought as properly to said in man, as in the highest Heavens: And this is that
God, who is Light, 1 John 1.5. who is in all, through all, and over all blessed
forever, whom the World by wisdom can never attain to the knowledge of.

Again, If the Spirit be God, as J. N. in page 54. affirms, which is certainly
true (because God is a Spirit) and the Spirit be in the Saints, and in Man,
leading into his most holy Will (as J. N. also confesses in page 77, and 84.)
Then how can it be said, That God that fills Heaven and Earth, who is a Spirit,
dwells not in man, as he elsewhere says? Unless he will conclude the Spirit of
God to be divided into several Beeings, which cannot be; therefore his Being
is not only afar off, but near at hand, even in man; but that lofty One, that
dwells in the high and holy place, is known also with him that is poor, etc.
and his Delight is with the Sons of men.

Again, If the Spirit in the Saints be (as J. N. to the wounding of his own
Cause, says) of the same nature, tendency and power with the Father and Son;
then there is a sufficient Savior in man; for the Tendency of the Son is to
save, as J.N. himself (I dare say) will acknowledge; and his Nature is to save
which was the end of his coming, and he is of power to save; For all Power in
Heaven and Earth is given to the Son; and the Nature of the Father is to save,
as I have before showed out of the Prophets; therefore the Spirit, that is given
into the hearts of People (which reproves them for sin) being of the same
nature, power and tendence with the Father and Son, is sufficient to save; else
it cannot be said to be of the same nature, tendency and power: so that none
need go far, or look to the Hills and Mountains for a Savior; but look unto
him that is nigh (who is of power to save) even to the Light or Grace, that
has appeared as a Reprover of the deeds of Darkness; and this will lead into
all Truth, and save out of all Unrighteousness; and unto them that walk here,
in Christ the Light (not after the Motions of the Flesh) but after the Leadings
of the Spirit, there will be no Condemnation. And although this God who is
Light, and is a Spirit, be a God afar off also, as being that Infinite
Incomprehensible Fullness that fills all things; yet all that can be known of
him by any man, is manifested within man, Romans 1.19.

And thus the Confusions and Contractions of J. N. appears, who thereby
declares, that he has not the knowledge of Christ nor of God, to exercise his
Faith in; nor yet does he keep to Scripture neither, to exercise his Faith
therein; but is seen and discovered to have his mind and his Faith exercised in
Fancies and Imaginations, which is the cause of his thus contradicting himself,
and of his affirming so many Absurdities, and Blasphemies, without sound reason
or Scripture Arguments, sometimes dividing Christ and his Spirit, and sometimes
acknowledging them to be of one and the same being, and sometimes join the
Spirit and Scriptures, and arguing that they cannot be separated; and the
reasons he gives is, because the Scriptures are the givings forth of the
Spirit; and yet notwithstanding will say, Christ has a distinct being from
his Spirit, which is of his givings forth; and thus, as fancy leads him, he
affirms things, as in Page 43. he says, If Scripture be denied to be the Word
of God, it makes void the exercise of Faith, for Faith must be exercised in
the Scriptures or else upon fancy and imagination; and in Page 73. he says, if
there be no personal being of Christ, then there is no Christ to exercise
Faith in* so by this kind of Arguments of J. N. if Faith be exercised in a
personal being of Christ, its exercised upon fancy and imagination, (which is
very true) for a personal being of Christ is not Scripture, and he says,
Faith must be exercised in Scripture or else upon fancy and imagination, But
the truth is, he cannot tell what the true Faith is nor what it is exercised
in, sometimes Scripture is the only thing; and another while a personal being
of Christ; and what will it be next, but even what his Fancy and Imaginations
bring forth? which he appears full of, like one that knows not Christ the Power
of God, (manifested in him) who is the Author of true Faith, or the begetter
thereof; and is also the object thereof, in which it is exercised, and in whom
it stands, whom all must hear, that receive the true Faith, which is the
victory that overcomes the World, and which gives access unto God; in which
Faith, there is Peace, and Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory.

Again, in Page 87. mentioning that Scripture which seems as a Block in his
way, which I perceive he would fain remove, (Gal. 4.19) till Christ be formed
in you; and therefore gives this meaning, viz. This forming of Christ in the
Saints, was but to bring them forth into a Gospel-Purity, etc. this is his
Interpretation of that Scripture, and a very favorable one too; but whereby
should they be brought forth into a Gospel Purity? Was it not by the Spirit's
operation that was in them, which they received by the hearing of Faith Gal.
3.2. which J. N. acknowledged to be of the same being of the Father and the
Son? If so, then was not Christ, according to Measure, (who fills all things)
really in them, who has diversity of operations, who came for judgment, and to
send Fire on the Earth; and were they not to be brought forth into that Gospel
Purity (that J. N. speaks of) by his Spirit of judgment and of burning which
they had received, who came for judgment, and to send Fire; seeing God
signified by his Prophet, that the Filth of the Daughter of Sion should be
purged away with the Spirit of judgment and of burning? Isa. 4.4. and this was
that Spirit, by which the Saints were washed, cleansed, sanctified, and
justified, when the Apostle told them they were so, in the Name of the Lord
Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor. 6.11. and they that were thus
washed, and brought forth into this Gospel Purity, they were made a Habitation
for God (who as J. N. Confesses, is that Spirit) even through the Spirit's
operations, which is of the same Being or Substance with Christ, so that the
filth being purged away; there was room for him to dwell there, and so was
really in them formed; and they brought forth in his own Image by his own
operation, with whom the Apostles were Co-workers, and therefore traveled for
this forming of Christ in them, or for the subjecting them in the Faith, wholly
unto Christ's Government, that he might reign in them over all, who is God
Blessed forever.

One thing more (which I find in the close of his Book, which he entitules, A
Caution to all) I cannot well pass by with silence, where he says, Seeing God
has cast us into a day, wherein there is such a spirit running too and fro in
this Nation, that will seemingly own Truth, and yet will draw all into a
Mystery within man, denying Truth according to Truth's Intent; let us therefore
labor with our God for his blessed Spirit, to guide us into all Truth.

Answ. [Mark Reader] Is it contrary to Truth's intent, to own the Truth to be a
Mystery within man? Does not God love to have Truth manifested in the inward
parts? Is not Christ the Truth, which the Apostle declared to be the Mystery
within, saying, Christ in you the Hope of Glory? How then can it be said, That
that Spirit, that owns Truth to be a Mystery within, does not own it according
to Truth's intent? Surely J. N. has besotted his Understanding, else he would
not thus speak.

And whereas he says, Let us labor with God, for his blessed Spirit, to guide
us in all Truth. He therein seems to own Truth to be a Mystery within also; for
if the Spirit be to be received, it must be within; and the Spirit is Truth,
because (as J. N. elsewhere confesses) It is of the same being, nature, power
and tendency with God, who is Truth, and with Christ, who is the Truth. And the
Spirit is the Unction, which was received from the Holy One, which was True,
and not a Lie; so here he seems to own Truth a Mystery within (the Spirit being
Mystery) which before he said, was contrary to Truth's Intent; and thus his
Confusion appears from time to time: And moreover, if in such a dangerous time,
as he supposes this to be, the Spirit be the only Thing to be labored for, as
a Guide to lead in all Truth; wherefore then does he so much cry against the
Quakers; whose Principle it is, and also their Practice, To labor with people,
to wait for the Spirit's Operation, that by it (as the most certain Guide) they
may be led into all Truth? Has he not also opposed himself hereby, who not
long before asserted, the Scriptures to be the only Rule, which do but testify
of the Spirit, which now he would have people labor for, as a Guide in all
Truth, which indeed is the only Guide, without which the Scriptures cannot be
known, (because they are things of God; and the things of God know no man but
the Spirit of God, and he to whom the Spirit of God reveals them?

And he says, Let us not be hasty to receive an Opinion, before we have
weighed the same by the Law and Testimony; seeing there are many false spirits
gone out into the world.

Answ. That there are many false spirits gone out into the World, I grant; and
that is a false babilonish spirit that contradicts it self, as the spirit of
J.N. has done, as before showed: And that is the true Spirit of Grace, which
teaches to live God-like in this present World: but that which leads into
Confusion, is not God-like; but such is the spirit of J.N. therefore not to be
received. And that all Opinions and Spirits are to be tried by the Law and
Testimony, I own; but what is this Law and Testimony? is it not the Light and
Spirit in the inward parts? for Solomon said, The Law is Light; and the Angel
said, The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy, Pro. 6.23. Rev. 19.11.
So here is the Law and Testimony declared, which I dare say J.N. never intended
to direct people to, as a Touchstone to try Opinions by, as he call them: And
is not this Light the Law of the Spirit, which the Apostle speaks of, and which
he sometimes called, The perfect Law of Liberty? Jam. 1.25. And by this Law
indeed Paul said, He was set free from the Law of sin and death: So as the
Prophet said, Let all to the Law and to the Testimony; or, as the Apostle said,
Look into the perfect Law of Liberty; the Law of the Spirit, or Light thereof,
in the inward parts; for this is that perfect Rule that leads in the Way, in
which a Wayfaring-man, though a Fool, cannot err: And without this there are
none able to understand the Scriptures, nor to practice them; because of our
selves we can do nothing; yet we are willing to having our Doctrines,
Principles and Practices tried by the Scriptures of Truth.

But (then says J.N.) the most dangerous spirit is this, that draws all the
Happiness of this Life, and that which is to come, into man, and finishes all
the Glory of man at the brink of the Grave.

Answ. If by the Glory of man, he means the Glory of Man, as simply a Creature;
then I do say, all that is to be finished at the brink of the Grave; for its
but the glory of Flesh, which, as the Flower of the Grass, passes away: But if
by the Glory of man, he means that which the Wise in Heart shall inherit (
Prove. 3.35.) and which is the Reward of those, before whom the Righteousness of
God goes; then I know none (except Athiests and Ranters) that affirm or assert
any such thing; and I say also, that is the most dangerous spirit of all, and
to be shunned by all: But that spirit which would keep people out of an
Expectation of seeing and beholding that Glory that is endless, while on this
side the Grave, is not much inferior (as to the Ill-consequences of it) to the
other; for that would deprive people of the chief Happiness of this Life, and
of the happy Enjoyment of that Glory which their Peace and Joy is full of in
believing, while they remain on this side the Grave; and may also endanger to
deprive them of the enjoyment of that which is to be received in the Life that
is to come: For, if the Earnest of the incorruptible Inheritance (which is a
part thereof) be not received in this Life, what true Comfort can there be
enjoyed in this Life? So then that Spirit of Grace, or Word of Grace, which
manifests its Light and Strength in the Inward Parts, by its own Operation, for
the begetting of Faith in, and concerning it self, in all that hear and receive
it; this, I say, is not to be shunned, but adhered unto by all, as unto the
Author of true Faith; seeing Faith comes by Hearing, and hearing by the Word
of God; and the Word is nigh thee, in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth, Romans 10.17.
and the Spirit is in the inward parts (which with the Word is one) by which
Faith is given.

And all that hear this Word, and obey this Spirit of Faith, shall doubtless
behold the Glory of the Word, as the Apostles did, even as the Glory of the
only Begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth; and shall doubtless know
that Faith, in which is Peace and Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory; and this
will be unto them an Earnest of the Everlasting Inheritance, that never fades,
by which they will be assured of the full Possession thereof, when time shall
be no more.

And thus having examined the principal matters in this Book, viz. Concerning
the Scriptures being the Word of God, and the perfect Rule, and the sad
Consequences which (he says) will follow the denying of them so to be; and
concerning Christ being the Word really so, and (as he says) but comparatively
so; and concerning Christ being a Savior as he is God, or a Savior only, as
he has a Body of Flesh; and concerning his being in Heaven with the Father, at
his Right Hand, and his being in man really so; I say, having gone through with
these things, and spoken as to them; I shall leave them to the Judgment of the
Judicious Reader; desiring of God, by his own Spirit to give a right
Understanding unto all that desire after him, that they may know him that is
true to be manifested in them, that they may by his spirit be baptized into him
to live and have their Being in him; that so they may understand the things
that appertain to his Kingdom, and to their own everlasting Peace; that in the
Faith of the Unchangable Truth, they may stand as Mount Sion, that cannot be
moved.

And the rest of his Book, consisting of a large pretended Answer to six
Queries, that were sent to him by a certain Person, whom I do not well know; I
shall not much concern my self therein at this time, though I do acknowledge,
that diverse things therein contained, do concern the Truth, which I profess,
and therein I am concerned; but it consists chiefly of things that I have
already spoken to: so that what I have written, may serve for an Answer to all;
for it would be superfluous to reiterate that, which in substance I have
already gone over.

J. C.

A TESTIMONY Concerning LODOWICK MUGGLETON
FOR as much as I have been informed, That Lodowick Muggleton has vaunted
concerning my departure out of the Body, because of his pretended Sentence of
Damnation given against me; I am moved to leave this Testimony, concerning him,
behind me: viz. That he is a Son of Darkness, and a Co-Worker with the Prince
of the Bottomless Pit; in which his Inheritance shall be forever. And the
Judgment I passed on him, when with him, stands sealed by the Spirit of the
Lord, by which I then declared unto him, That in the Name of that God, that
spanneth the Heaven with his Span, and measures the Waters in the hollow of
his Hand, I bind thee here on Earth, and thou art bound in Heaven; and in the
Chain under Darkness to the Judgment of the great Day thou shall be reserved:
and thy faith and strength, thou boastest of, I defy and trample under Foot.

And I do hereby further declare the said Lodowick to be a false Prophet, in
what he said to me at that time, who told me, That from henceforth I should be
always in fear of Damnation, which should be a Sign to me that I was damned;
which Fear I was never in since: so that his Sign given by himself, did not
follow his Prophecy, which sufficiently declares him to be a false Prophet.

Josiah Coal.

What Josiah Coal spoke, a little time before he died, to Friends that were
about him.
WEll Friends, Be faithful to God, and have a single Eye to his glory, and seek
nothing for self, or your own glory; and if any thing arise, judge it down by
the Power of the Lord God; that so you may be clear in his Sight, and answer
his Witness in all People; then will you have the Reward of LIFE.

For my part, I have walked in Faithfulness with the Lord, and I have Peace
with the Lord; and his Majesty is with me, and his Crown of Life is upon me: So
mind my Love to all Friends. Then he ceased speaking.

After he spoke to S. C. saying, Dear Heart, keep low in the Holy Seed of God;
that will be thy Crown.

He said after, A minister of Christ must walk as he walked.
