Satan's Design DEFEATED.

In a short Answer to a Manuscript sent by a Priest out of Sussex, to a Member
of this present Parliament, full of railing accusations, whereby he has
secretly smitten the Innocent, by a secret desiring the persecution of the
People of God.

But herein his folly and madness does appear, that (...) he has accused
others falsely, himself is found guilty of the same thing.

With Invitations of Love to the present Authority, that ^^^y may save
themselves from being the executioners of the Priests malice, least the Lord
destroy them.

By a Friend to Righteousness, E.B.

LONDON, (...) Thomas Simmons, at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1659.

A Certain Paper being come to my hand (which is said to be written by one
Priest Iackson, and sent to a member of Parliament) containing diverse
particulars charged as errors upon the despised people called Quakers, wherein
he says he has set down some of their Tenants which they maintain; unto which
Manuscript I am moved to write something in answer, as to clear the truth from
his fowl aspertions which he casts upon it, to the intent that the said member
of Parliament, and the whole house may be the better satisfied and resolved;
wherein they doubt of every particular, that the truth may appear, when as the
fowl vail of the darkness and slanders is removed.

His first particular
That the Holy Scriptures are not the word of God, nor the Saints Rule of Faith
and Life, neither is it the duty of every one to search them.

Answ. The Holy Scriptures that were given forth by the Spirit of the Lord, as
holy men of God were moved, they are the words of God, and a Declaration and a
Treatise, Luke 1.1. and that which the Saints had handled and tasted of the
word of Life, that they declared forth in words and writing, Acts 1.1. and the
Scriptures as they were given forth by the Spirit of God, are a true
declaration of what is to be believed and practiced in relation to eternal
salvation, it is a true Testimony concerning God and his mighty works, and of
truth and righteousness, and it is a Testimony also of the Devil and what he
is, and of his deceits and errors, and unrighteousness, so the Scriptures are
words given forth by the spirit, but Christ is the Word that was before the
Scriptures was, for in the beginning was the word of God, and the World was
made by it, and the Word shall endure for ever, and Christ's Name is called the
Word of God, and though the Scriptures are profitable and were given forth to
be read, and to be fulfilled, yet they are not the rule and guide of faith and
life unto the Saints, but the Spirit of God that gave forth the Scriptures,
that is the rule, and guide, the Teacher and leader into all truth, and them
that are led by the spirit of God, are the Sons of God, and if you walk in the
spirit says the Apostle, you shall live, and as many as walk according to this
(to wit of the Spirit) peace is upon them, and so the spirit of God is the rule
of the Saints faith and life; and the spirit leads them to walk in the
fulfilling of the Scriptures, and according to them. And as for all the Priests
in England who does profess the Scriptures to be their rule, out of their own
mouths will God judge them, who are found walking contrary to the Scriptures in
life, and doctrine, and practices, while they cry it up for their rule, and
condemn all that will not say as they say. And the last part of this
proposition is utterly false, for we never do assert that it is not the duty of
every one to search them, but we bid every one search the Scriptures and every
one ought to search them, but yet we say that none understands them, but who
have the spirit that gave them forth, nor none can profit thereby, but by the
spirit that gave them forth, which works the same truth in the heart, which
the Scriptures without declares of, and this I do affirm, they are the words of
God, and the Spirit of God is the rule of Faith and Life to the Saints, and all
men ought to search the Scriptures, and to believe what is therein written, and
to receive and enjoy Christ who is the substance and the end of all things, the
first and last, the beginning and ending, and in him the Scriptures are
fulfilled, and finished.

They do deny the Doctrine of the Trinity, His second Particular.
and that Christ is God and man in one person.

Answ. As for the word Trinity, it is invented, and he has learned it out of
the Masse-Book, or Common Prayer Book, but we own the Doctrine of the Gospel of
Christ, that Christ is God, and the Spirit is God; and there are three that
bear record, the Father, Son and Spirit, and these are one, but God and the
Spirit are not persons, but infinite beings, and the Scripture no where in true
Translations expresses God under the name person, for person is too carnal to
express God and Christ, and the spirit by, but God was in Christ reconciling
the World, and this we believe and acknowlelge according to the Scriptures; but
for this word Doctrine of the Trinity, the Scriptures knows no such word, but
the truth we own, and the Gospel and the Scriptures too.

His third particular
They hold that Jesus Christ died only signally or exemplarily, and that we
are justified by the suffering of Christ in us, and to be healed by his stripes
is to be stripped of or from sin.

Answ. Jesus Christ died, and rose again, and ascended according to the
Scriptures, this we do believe; And Christ was and is the substance, the end of
all signs and examples, yet was he an example to the Saints; And the Apostle
exhorted to walk as they had Christ for an example; and while he was in the
World he did and spoke and acted many things as Parables, signs and examples,
the substance of which is to be received in the Saints, and known by them
through the spirit, and we believe Saints are justified by the Christ, and
through faith in him which was and is, and is to come, who is blessed for ever,
and none are justified by his death and suffering and blood without them, but
who witnesses Christ within them, for all are reprobates, and to be condemned
and cannot be justified that has not Christ in them, as thou may read,
(except Christ be in you, you are reprobates) and all that believe in Christ
and receives him they are healed through his sufferings and stripes, for he
sanctifies them, and gives remission of sin and justifies them, and in him the
Saints are complete, and the new man (the regenerate) is justified, and the old
man is in the degeneration, and knows not Christ in him, and has not received
him, but only heard of him without him, and believes the relation; but this
faith does not justify, for all the false Christians upon earth has this
faith; but that faith alone justifies which gives to receive Christ, and him to
live in us, and to dwell in us by that faith.

His fourth particular
They utterly renounce the Doctrine of justification by the imputation of the
righteousness of Christ, or by the obedience he performed, or sufferings he
sustained or underwent in his own person without us.

Answer, This is partly true, and partly a lie; we do indeed renounce the
profession of justification by the imputation of Christ or his Righteousness
performed without men, by men while they are in the degenerated estate, and
unconverted, and unreconciled, and unborn again; for by such profession of
justification many deceive their souls; but yet we say, that Righteousness is
imputed to us, and reckoned unto us who believe in Christ and have received
him, even the obedience and sufferings that he performed without us is ours who
have received him within us, and witnesses Christ in us, and therefore we are
not reprobates; yet we do acknowledge he wrought perfect righteousness by
obedience and suffering without us, and that righteousness is ours by faith,
which faith has received Christ to dwell in us, and he and his righteousness,
his obedience and sufferings we enjoy in us in spirit, if any can receive it
let them, for that he wrought Righteousness this is acknowledged, but who has
a part in this righteousness, that is disputable.

They wholly renounce the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, His fifth
particular
and it is one of the great reasons for which they decry the Ministers because
they assert it; they say Jacob and Esau are in a man, and the good seed is
Jacob which God electeth, and the bad seed is Esau which he reprobates.

Answ. The Doctrine of Election and Reprobation we do own according to the
Scriptures, and therefore have thou belied us and slandered us, and art found
reproveable, and would incense men's minds against us for advantage to thy self,
but to some in that house we are better known then thou can report of us; and
yet thou say we say that Jacob and Esau are in a man, and the good seed God
electeth, and the bad he Reprobates, and thou may here see thy confusion and
thy ignorance uttered in the self same lines; for thou say we renounce the
Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, and yet say we say the good seed God
electeth, and the bad seed he reprobateth; and this shows what spirit thou art
of, and how that the spirit of unrighteousness does possess thee, and leads
thee to speak without understanding; and we further say, man being degenerated,
became reprobated and cast out, and all by nature are the children of wrath,
and the children of wrath are all in the reprobate state, and none are elected
but who are elected in Christ the seed of David, and so in the first Adam all
are reprobated, and all that are in the second Adam are elected; and the
Election and Reprobation stands not in the persons but in the seeds, and yet
the persons are blessed or cursed, in the love or in the displeasure of God,
according as the seed of God, or the seed of the Serpent lives and dwells and
bears rule in the persons; and we do indeed decry and deny you the professed
Ministers, upon many accounts more then one, and we have already, and may in
time to come show sufficient reasons against you, both in Doctrine and practice
and otherwise, that you are not the Ministers of Christ, but the Ministers of
Satan generally.

His sixth Particular
That Jesus Christ as he is the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham is in
every one, and that a measure or part of the substance that was conceived in
the womb of the Virgin Mary, is in every one.

Answ. Jesus Christ he is the seed of the woman, and the seed of Abraham
according to the flesh, and after the spirit the Son of the living God, and
this Christ that was, and is, and is to come, who was dead but is alive, and
lives for evermore, the alone Savior of the world, he has given a measure of
Light and Life unto every man, and there is a Light from him that shines in the
hearts of all men, shining in darkness; the Light shines, but the darkness
comprehends it not, and this was John's Testimony, and is our Testimony that
Christ enlighteneth every man, or all mankind that comes into the World, for
in him was life, and the Life was the Light of men, as the scripture says; and
the Apostle Preached the Light that shined in peoples hearts, and it was that
Light that gave them the Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God; but thou
have discovered thy self to be a stumbler at the stumbling-stone, and has
taken offense at the light, like the Pharisees who professed the scriptures as
the Priests of England do, but were ignorant of the Life, the end of the words,
and knew not Christ the substance; but the stone at which you stumble will
break you to pieces, and grind you to powder, even Christ the Light of the
World, that lights every man that comes into the World.

That the soul is a part or measure of God (as they speak) and not a part of
man but uncreated; His 7. particular.
And so is that light which is in every one.

Ans. The soul is immortal, and God is immortal, for God breathed into man the
breath of life, and he became a living soul (as says the Scripture) and the
soul is related to God, for what a man works against God, it is against his own
soul; for all sin is against God, and against a man's own soul; And God who has
all souls in his hand, who is the Creator, and gave life into the soul that is
immortal and can never die, Though death has passed over it, And has reigned
over all from Adam till Moses; And Christ is the light of the world that gives
life unto the soul, And he raises up the soul out of death, and misery, and
brings the soul to rejoice in God its Savior; And Christ is the souls Bishop,
its Pastor, and Feeder, and who knows Christ knows him that was before the
world was made; and sees to the beginning, and to the ending, and his soul
rests in God that is over all.

That the light in the heathens, His 8. particular.
who never heard that Jesus Christ died at Jerusalem is the same for the
quality of it, with that which is in the most godly person; only there is a
difference in the quantity; And men are reconciled to God by following of it,
This light they say is the sure word of prophecy, and that it is sufficient to
lead out of all sin unto God.

An. The Testimony of John is, that Christ is the light that lights every man
that comes into the world, And if every man, then the heathen, who has not
the relation of Christ's life, and his death at Jerusalem, yea and it is the
same light that is in the heathen, the same in nature and kind, as it is in the
Saints, for the Comforter the spirit of truth is one in it self and the same;
Though it comfort the Saints, and reproves the world, and the wicked for
their sins; And men are reconciled to God by Christ, for he was in God
reconciling to himself; and none are reconciled but who walk in the light, and
follows it, for who walks in the light, the blood of Christ cleanses them
from all sin; and they are reconciled, and none else; And the word of God is in
the heart as the Scripture says, Deuteronomy. 30. Romans 10. and that is the word of
prophecy, and that word is sufficient to lead out of all sin unto God, if men
believe in Jesus and receives him, and the spirit of truth leads into all
truth, all that follow it.

His 9. particular.
That Christ as man is not in heaven, yea that he has ceased to be man and
consequently to be Mediator, and when I told them he should come in the Clouds
in like manner as he ascended, and that at his coming the Elements melts one
of their Teachers told me that the clouds were scattered and the Elements
melted in him.

Ans. Christ Jesus is ascended into Heaven and sits at the right hand of the
Father, yea he is ascended far above all heavens, as says the Scripture, but
that is utterly false whereas thou say, we say he ceased to be man, that is
thy lie, and so I pass it; And we believe according to the Scriptures that he
shall come in the Clouds in like manner as he Ascended, and at his coming the
Elements shall melt; And it is not error for a man to say the Clouds were
scattered and the Elements melted in him; for Clouds are darkness and covers
the face of the Sun many times as thou may behold in the Firmament; But
darkness is yet over thy heart, and the Elements are not melted away; And
therefore thou art in thy imaginations, putting light for darkness and darkness
for light, and calling evil good and good evil.

That the bodies of men shall never rise again after death, and that the day of
Judgment is come already, His tenth particular.
and that now the Saints do Judge the world.

Ans. We do believe the Resurrection according to the Scriptures, for if only
in this life we have hope, we were of all men most miserable; And we believe
that the dead shall arise again after death, and every one shall receive
according to the deeds done in the body, they that have done evil shall arise
to Eternal condemnation, and they that have done good unto Eternal salvation in
the day of Judgment; And the Lord comes with, and in ten thousand of his
Saints to judge the world, and the Saints upon earth do receive the spirit of
judgment, and do judge the world, even all things, for the spiritual man
judges all things, even in this present age, if thou can receive it thou
may.

His 11th. particular.
They are utterly against water Baptism and Administering of the Lords Supper
with bread and wine, Because they say they have the substance of all within.

Ans. As for Baptism and the Supper of the Lord we do own it, and it is
practiced of us in the life and power of God, but as for your Baptism, that is
to say sprinkling of infants, calling it the Baptism into the faith, and that
they are made members of the Church thereby, and that it is a seal of
regeneration as you say in your Common Prayer book, and Directory, that we do
utterly deny, and does say it is no Ordinance of God, neither was ever
commanded by him, or practiced by his Saints, but is an Institution of the
Whore of Rome, And England received it by a Popish Institution, and your
practice of it is idolatry, and not any part of the true worship of God; And as
for your breaking bread and drinking wine in that manner and form as it is
practiced in the Church of England among the unconverted and unregenerated,
that we utterly deny also to be of God, or to be ever commanded of him or
practiced by his Saints, and this is neither Heresy nor error in us, but true
bearing witness against your Idolatrous ways and practices, with which the
Nations are deceived, whom the Whore causes to drink her cup; even all people
has drunk her cup, and she has drunk the blood of them that would not; And
she has long sat upon Nations, Peoples, and multitudes, but now she is made
bare and discovered, and all you her false Ministers; And whereas the Author
does say these are some of the strange and horrid opinions which they have
audatiously invented, etc.

Answ. It is no strange thing that truth be called Heresy and error; and that
it be branded with a name of strange and horrid opinions, and such like, but we
do acknowledge that in that way that is called Heresy do we worship the true
and living God, and woe will be unto them that put light for darkness, and
darkness for light, but when these particular things and their answers are
truly read and weighed, then let spiritual men judge, for this Author must not
be judge in his own case, whose judgment is corrupted and his ways
abomination; And it has been the work of that generation (of those called
Ministers I mean) for this seven years to cry out to the Magistrates and to
send one Paper after another of this nature to them, but what has it
advantaged them? for has not the Lord turned their wisdom backward? And even
the way which they have thought to destroy the heritage of the Lord, the Lord
hereby has made his heritage more glorious, and so they have striven against
the Lord, and altogether in vain, and their doings shall they eat the fruit of,
and receive the reward of their own work. And whereas the Author further says,
such as has saving work in their souls, and that knows God and Christ, etc.
can not but bless God for keeping them from the great blackness and darkness
that has invaded the souls of these deluded wretches.

Answ. They that know the saving work in their souls, and that knows God and
Christ in truth and righteousness, and that calls upon him with an upright
heart we are one with them, and they with us; And they alone that walks in the
light that Christ has enlighted them withal, are kept from the darkness that
does invade the deluded; and as for thy envious reflection, as poor deluded
wretches, and such like, these words are to thy self for they have no entrance
into our dwellings, the Lord has saved us by his right hand* and we bear them
as his reproaches for righteousness sake. And whereas thou say it is very
sad that after so much Preaching of the Gospel so many should take those things
for new lights, which are but Antiquated errors, etc.

Ans. It is very sad indeed that the Ministers of this Nation should have so
fair a Profession upon them, and should put the Nation to so much charge by
giving them tithes and Stipends and money, and has spoiled Peoples goods, and
cast their bodies into prisons even of many hundreds that would not pay them;
And yet the Nation should be left in darkness, and like a untilled wilderness,
notwithstanding all the Profession of Preaching the Gospel, for the Nation has
been like an untilled field, and like People like Priest, like shepherd like
sheep, as it is especially amongst them where Shepherds and sheep are risen in
Rebellion against the Nation, and has joined with the old Caveliers, but this
shows that your Preaching has been for ends to your selves and for money, and
that you have been Ministers of the Letter, and not of the spirit nor of the
power of God, for had you been in the life and Preachers of the true Gospel,
the Nations had been as a garden at this day, and not like an unploughed field,
as we see they are, people abounding in ungodliness and in all pride, and
vanity which is a shame to Christianity; now People and Ministers has made a
show of the Gospel, but has been without the power in the form of godliness,
and have had the form but resisted the power; And indeed the ignorance of the
people will lie upon their Ministers who has been crying peace to them that
have walked after the imaginations of their own hearts, and has not turned the
wicked from his wicked way, and the Scriptures are fulfilled upon them, they
have run but God has not sent them, therefore the people has not at all been
profited by them; but the light of the glorious Gospel is risen in men's hearts,
and your folly and vanity is discovered, and that makes you rage and swell like
a foaming Sea; now when your shame is seen you are casting out slanders and
reproaches, thinking thereby to seduce the minds of people, thinking always to
keep the Magistrates on your side and to ride upon them; and that they will
establish you in freedom and destroy them that are against you; but the Lord is
opening their eyes to behold your deceit and madness; and you will be left unto
your selves, and fall into the pit that you have dug for others.

And whereas this Author does further compare this poor people which he in
scorn calls Quakers with several pestilent Heretics as he calls them, that
have disturbed the Church, and says he, they agree with the Adamites, and
Pharisees, and Sadduces, and with the Mannachies with the Jews, Turks,
Servebus, and with the Soscinians and many more which he names, and says we
agree with them, and this is to render us odious and as abominable as he can to
men in Authority:

To all which I do answer, what we do profess and practice for Religion, we
have not been learnt from man nor been taught it by men; not our Gospel nor
Religion, but we have received it from the Lord, and of him are we taught, and
by the spirit lead into all truth, and though thou have done as the Pharisees
did; they reckoned Christ with transgressors, and crucified him betwixt two
thieves, so though thou have compared us with such and such; whom thou call
Heretics and it is possible many of them might be so, and so thou have showed
the spirit of the Pharisees, and of the murderers that denied Christ, and we
are known unto the Lord what we are, though not unto mortal man's wisdom that
perishes; And to whom shall we more truly compare the Ministers of England?
are they not like those which Isaiah cried against, that sought for their gain
from their quarter, that were greedy dumb dogs? And like them that Jeremiah
cried against that said, thus says the Lord when the Lord, had never spoken to
them, nor sent them? and are not you all like them that Micah cried against
chap. 3. that Preached for hire and Divined for money, and that prepared war
against those that would not put into their mouths, as you do at this day? and
are not you like them that Ezekiel cried against that made a prey upon the
flock, and made merchandise of souls and fed themselves with the fat, and did
not feed the flock, but ruled over them with force and cruelty? And are you not
like such as Christ cried woe against that were called of men Master, that went
in long robes and love greeting in the markets, and uppermost rooms at feasts?
for you act those things which Christ cried woe against, the Pharisees who did
the same things; And are not you like them that Paul spoke of, that are headdy
and high minded men, and covetous and proud, and went in the way of Baalam for
gifts and rewards, and that through coveteousness with fained words made
Merchandise of souls? And

Are not you like them that John saw was coming in, in his days, that went out
from them, and that went into the world, that were of the world, and spoke of
the world, and the world heard them, and which the world went after? And are
not you of them that has deceived the whole world, that has been of the Whore
that causes all Nations to drink her cup, and of them that has made war
against the Saints and against the Lamb, of that stock of the false Prophets
that wrought miracles in the sight of the beast, And the world wonders after
the beast? and the beast has carried the Whore, and he has compelled and
caused all to worship him, and the Whore caused all to drink of the cup of her
fornication? are not these things so? may not the witness of God in all men's
consciences truly answer hereunto, and condemn you to be such as were the
false prophets and the hirelings and the deceivers, against whom the Prophets,
Christ and the Apostles gave witness; yea it is manifest that you are in the
same way, and of the same generation, and that you follow the same spirit,
because you show forth the same works? and are not you like the Papist, and the
Jesuits, was it not by the Authority of the Pope of Rome that your very way of
making Ministers was ordained at Schools and Colleges? and were it not the
Papists and in their days that the general part of your Church Discipline and
Government, the call of your Ministers, and practice of them, and maintenance
of them, was it not first set up by the Papists? was not this way of Tithes
first established by the Church of Rome? and do you not follow the Papists
herein in receiving tithes and Gleab Lands, and Easter reckonings and Midsumer
dues, which you hold up, and would destroy them that will not give you such
things; And therefore are not you like unto the Papists and Jesuits? yea we
know that the Church of England is but newly come out of the womb of Popery,
and has the Symtomes thereof upon her at this very day in many things; yea,
the Testimony of God in all people may witness hereunto, and so it is the very
trick of the Whore to cry out against others and to charge others with that which
she is guilty of her self; but now it will not cover them to slander others
that themselves may seem clear; for the Lord is opening peoples hearts and
giving them a spirit to discern all things.

And whereas the Author speaks against the Quakers for crying against Cuffs,
Caps, and for using thee, and thou, and for crying against Pulpits and hour
glasses and such things, and for owning Revelation, and for holding the free
grace of God to be given unto all, and because of trembling and quaking, and
saying our writtings are given out by the same infallible spirit that the
Scriptures were given out by, and for crying down the Ministers maintenance,
and for calling some of them vipers and Serpents.

To all this I answer, it is your generation that makes a great noise about
thee and thou, and Cuffs and Caps, for we in plainness and simplicity do speak
the proper Language, thee, and thou to a single person, and it is the proud and
exalted minds of men that are offended hereat, which pride and arogancie has
eaten out the sincerity, and the very propriety of speech also, and you are
offended at us because of it, and for crying against your Cuffs and
Boot-hose-tops and Ribbands and points; we cry against all these things as not
becoming the Ministers of Christ, but as being of the world in the pride and
vanity and superfluity, abusing the Creation, which the Lord will Judge among
you; And as for having an hour-glasse and Preaching thereby, and as for your
carnal Bells which you call people by, we do disown these things, and say they
are old Popish inventions, for the Ministers of Christ never limited their
spirits to an hour-glasse, neither had they a carnal Bell to call people to
their worship; and as for Revelation, we do own that the Spirit of God does
reveal truth to us, and God has revealed Christ in us, and none ever shall
know God but by Revelation; for none knows the Father but the Son, and he to
whom the Son will reveal him; And as for free grace, we say the grace of God
has appeared to all men, and it teaches the Saints to deny ungodliness; but
the wicked turns it into wantonness, and does dispite unto the spirit of grace;
and we also say, that who now speaks or are moved to write forth by the Spirit
of God, they speak and write by the same spirit that is infalliable that the
Scriptures was given forth by; And as for your maintenance, it is altogether
abominable and oppression to the Nation, and the Lord is against it, your
taking peoples goods and casting them into prison that will not pay you wages,
and give you Tithes against their consciences; And be not offended at being
called vipers and Serpents, for these are the works of venomous vipers and
stinging Serpents which pesecute the servants of God, and cries to the
Magistrates for help against a poor people that uses no weapons against you,
saving that of the Spirit of God, and though we do thus to you, to the false
Ministers; to cry against them, and give our witness against them in the name
of the Lord, yet we do not deny the true Ministers of Christ, nor speak any
thing against them which are the true Ministers that has received the ministry
of righteousness by the gift of the holy spirit, which all that are true
Ministers does receive their ministry thereby.

And whereas thou say we are bitter enemies to the Doctrine of
Justification, and agrees with the Cavelierish party, and would silence godly
Ministers, and are Iesuitical, and such like things thou falsely charge upon
us, and that we have a notable faculty to delude ignorant unstable souls, etc.

Ans. These are but the Authors reproaches and his slanders he has filled his
mouth with against the innocent; And he has set his tongue on the fire of
hell, to slander the Just and the innocent; and all these things we bear in
patience, counting reproaches for Christ our chiefest riches and thus to the
substance of this Paper I have given answer, whereby all that love the Lord,
and desire to be informed in the truth may receive satisfaction; for it is seen
that that generation of Priests are joined with the Prelatical Cavelierish
party, and this is known at large in the Nation in the North especially, and so
as I said they would fain slander others that themselves might seem clear; but
the Lord will rebuke him and his lying tongue, and the innocent shall be
delivered from his devouring lips; and as for any other thing in his Paper it
is not worth answering to, nor worth minding, but his wickedness will turn upon
his own head and he shall bear the burden of his own words, only he queries
whether this be not the pestilence that walks in darkness? And the floods that
the Dragon has cast out of his mouth to drown the woman? is not this the mark
of the beast who opened his mouth in blasphemy? And are not these the unclean
spirits that came out of the mouth of the Dragon and out of the mouth of the
false prophet?

Ans. Now the pestilence that walks in darkness, is the plague that is out of
the light, sin and death and misery, which smites the ungodly, and he sees it
not; And the flood which the Dragon cast out is the floods of persecution and
cruelty, ( viz) the imprisoning until death, and spoiling peoples goods for
tithes and money, as the Priests have done; And the Dragon gave power to the
beast that compelled all to worship, and that carried the Whore, the false
Church, and the true Church has been fled into the wilderness for many
generations, and the false Church (the Whore) has sat as a Queen, and given
her cup to drink, the false Church of Rome, and the false Church of the
Protestants, all which are of the Whore, these have all been carried by the
beast which the Dragon gave his power to. And they have all persecuted the
woman, the true Church, and the mark of the beast he compelled people to
receive, and compelled them to worship, and they opened their mouths in
blasphemy, that denies Christ, and denies the light, and that says they are
Jews and are not, this is error and blasphemy which the Beast opens his mouth
in against the Saints, and against them that dwell in heaven, and the unclean
spirits are the spirits of Devils that are out of the truth, and these the
Dragon cast out in slanders, and reproaches, and lies, such as this Author has
done, and of that generation is he. Christ said false prophets should come, and
John saw in his days they were come, and he saw the world gone after them, and
of that generation are you, and now the Lord is gathering people from you
again, and Babylon must fall, and all her merchants howl and weep, And these
things have been which the Scripture speaks of, and the woman is now coming out
of the wilderness again, and the Whore must be rewarded, and sorrow is coming
upon her, and as she has done unto the Saints, so shall the Saints do unto her.

And in the conclusion he says; worthy Sir, (to this member of Parliament) it
will be your honor to stand in the gap to stop the violence of this hellish
Torrent that is so high that it sounds from Dan to Beersheba, and threatens
Judgment to our Israel, etc.

Ans. Here is the conclusion of thy matter, which is the sum of it, a running
to the powers of the earth for help; what, have you ministers lost the Lord to
be your strength, that you must fly for help to men to defend you from the
spirit of God in his people? must they make Laws to establish you and set you
up? is not this the Whore that road upon the Beast, and that the Beast carries?
is not here a description of her out of the mouth of this Author? Is he crying
to you to persecute the innocent? it is true, the seed of God is risen* the
Elect seed that is able to make war against the beast and against the false
prophets, even with the word of the Lord, and is he offended that truth is
risen so high? And would he have some fire and Faggots again in Smith-field?
and some persecution and banishment acted upon the people of God? is this the
standing in the gap and stopping violence, or would he have it done this way?
yea, Judgments indeed are threatened to your generation; for if God will not
destroy you soon enough, you will destroy your own selves, and your own
iniquity will be upon you, and the wickedness of the wicked shall slay him.

But my Council is not only to that particular member, but to the whole body
of them, that they be wise and take heed what they do, for the eye of the Lord
is over you, and his hand can dash you in pieces, and if you be oppressors of
the people of God, and will not relieve the oppressed, the innocent, and break
the bonds of oppression, the Lord will break you in pieces; for this is the
rock that has broken all before you, persecuting people for conscience sake,
and if you go in this way, your destruction shall be the most lamentable of any
that was ever yet before you; do you not yet see the wickedness of this
generation? will you yet contend for them? surely you might learn wisdom even
by their solly, and if you do not shut your eyes, there needs no more discovery
then their own present ways and works.

Wherefore consider the day of Gods visitation is upon you, make good use of
your time least the Lord break you down and never build you up, and let the
Spirit of the Lord have its liberty and limit it not, for if you do you shall
never prosper, nor never be made a blessing unto the people under your charge.

Remember you are warned by a lover of your souls.

AND Friends, Great things has the Lord done in these Nations in your days,
and that by the face of your Authority; and there has a spirit stirred in some
of you and in the Army, which the Lord has appeared with, and yet the work of
the Lord is not finished; but greater things then these has the Lord to
accomplish amongst us and in this Nation, and these things that have come to
pass, have been but as the preparing of the way, for the bringing about greater
things; It is true, many Mountains have been removed, and some oppressions
taken off, and excellent things have been promised, and doubtless (by some of
you) really intended; but alas! the work has long remained unfinished, and
many of your best Friends are almost weary with waiting, to receive the end of
their hopes and desires; and many are even fainting concerning the Good Old
Cause, though of late it has seemed to be revived by you, yet it goes but
easily forwards, and even so little is its growth since your late Meeting, that
many are thinking themselves to be in a deceived condition by you; Why? They
see that wicked Clergies interest more prospering then the just freedom of the
people. And this I say unto you in the Name of the Lord, that while that
interest (of this false Priesthood I mean) is so much favored and defended,
you can never prosper, nor the Nations be ever happy under you; for it is one
of the greatest oppressions this day in the Nation, the maintaining and
upholding of this Ministry by Tithes and other unrighteous wages, and the very
Land groans under the oppression of this Church and Ministry, which lies as a
heavy burden upon both persons, and estates, and consciences of many good
people, even of your dearest Friends, and though the Lord does manifestly (even
from Heaven) show signal tokens of his displeasure against them, and the
servants of the Lord, they also cease not to warn you concerning them, and
their own doings are sufficient Testimony of the malice of their hearts against
you and all good men in the Nation, yet nevertheless some of you seem to shut
your eyes, and as if you would see no evil in them, but are crying up your
godly Ministers; and some of you utterly despising the man (as not worthy to
live) that does but speak against them; and thus are you blinded, and perceives
not where the cause lies of your interruption to bring forth righteousness. I
say, it is the favoring of that interest which stops the issues of good
things, and while you oppress peoples persons and estates, and consciences, to
uphold this Ministry and Priesthood aforesaid, the Lord shall never prosper
you, nor make the Nations happy under your charges, and this you shall witness
eternally; Wherefore I do say unto you, it is high time for you to lay aside
the interest of this oppressing Clergy, so much leavened and tasted of the
Whore of Rome; your selves do know that the spirit of the Romish Clergy was in
the late Bishops, which you east out for their wickedness; and the very spirit
of those Bishops is entered into these Priests, and bears rule in their hearts;
and thus by succession has the Whore of Rome leavened the Clergy of England,
from one generation to another, with her taste and savor; and there is the
remainer of her murders and cruelty in those men's breasts, and at every
opportunity it breaks forth, as of late in this Rebellion you have full
Testimony, and if you do not curb it speedily, it will grow over you to your
undoing. Therefore clear your selves, do not any longer drink the Whores cup,
neither be ye carriers of her, to execute her wickedness upon the bodies and
consciences of people, for it is written the Beast has carried the Whore, and
we see it has been thus, as John saw it was to come to pass; and so clear your
selves from her Tyrannies and Oppressions, and leave this false Church and
ministry to themselves, and if God will not uphold them by his power, Why
should you do it? If these Priests have not yet planted Vineyards that will
yield them fruit, and if their flock will not yield them milk freely, why
should you unjustly impose upon peoples Consciences, and compel Tithes and
money from them, for the maintenance of these men? Ye ought not to do it, for
while ye compel and force people by violence, contrary to good Conscience, to
maintain and uphold this Ministry, and Church, and Worship, you do but cause
people to drink the Whores cup, and you are but them which carries the Whore,
viz. the false Church; and this is plain dealing, to tell you the Truth,
whether ye will reject it or receive it, wherefore cast them off and let them
not lurk under your wings, for one day they will rebel against you, and
another day flatter with you, and for a season they will show forth much love
and kindness in hypocrisy, even while they are hatching mischief against you,
and to bring the Nation into blood, and they will cry out Heresy, and error of
others that themselves may seem clear, while as the same lodges in their own
hearts, wherefore I say do not make a false peace with them, nor do not (...)
with treacherous minds; for you had better have them your open enemies, then
deceitful and flattering friends, you had better be in a just opposition
against them, then in an unjust peace with them; I know it appears to many of
you, a thing very hard to be born; what? to forsake our godly Ministers think
ye, to hear tell of laying them aside, is an amazement unto some of your minds?
was it not the same concerning the King and Bishops? was it not as much
terrible to him and his Lords and Council to think of the overthrow of the then
called godly Fathers and Bishops* but better had he cast them off, and saved
himself, then to have perished with them; and so I say unto you, better were it
for you to lay these men aside, and their flatteries and feigned prayers, and
to save your selves from their flattery, then to perish with them, and the one
of these will come to pass, for its decreed of the Lord, if you uphold them,
and oppress peoples persons, estates and consciences on their behalf, and in
their evil cause, for Tithes and wages to them, ye shall fall with them, and
none shall be able to deliver, neither you nor them, for I tell you again, that
the very spirit of the old Idolatrous Bishops (long since cast out) is entered
into the hearts of these men, and there is as great a measure of Tyranny and
injustice and abomination lying upon these, as once was upon the Bishops, and
these are no less free from any abomination, then they were, and these are nigh
as ripe for vengeance and overthrow as the others were, and it will as surely
come upon these, as it did upon them ^ wherefore take heed unto your selves,
and be wise, and learn, and do us justice, or else God will do us justice upon
you, if ye will not take off our burdens and ease our oppressions, the Lord
God will ease us of you* and the earth shall not be oppressed with you, and if
ye will uphold this Priesthood against equity and good conscience, the Lord
will free good consciences both from you and them, and this is the word of the
Lord God to you.

The open enemy has not prevailed against you, but the secret hand of the
Lord, will not miss you.

THE END.
