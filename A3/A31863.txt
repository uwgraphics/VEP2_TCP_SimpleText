HIS MAJESTY'S DECLARATION TO ALL HIS LOVING SUBJECTS after His late Victory
against the Rebels on Sunday the 23d of October.
AS We must wholly attribute the preservation of Us and Our Children in the
late bloody Battle with the Rebels to the mercy and goodness of Almighty God,
who best knowing the Ju^^ice of Our cause, and the uprightness of Our he^^t to
his service, and to the good and welfare of Our People, would not suffer Us
and this whole Kingdom to be made a prey to those desperate Persons, so We
hold it Our duty still to use all possible means to remove that jealousy, and
misunderstanding from Our good Subjects, which by the Industry, and subtilty of
that Malignant Party (which has brought this mischief and confusion upon the
Kingdom) has been infused into them, and to that purpose (though even those
scandals are sufficiently answered by many of Our Declarations and Messages,
and by Our late Protestation made in the head of Our Army, which We shall
always by the help of God steadfastly and solemly observe) We shall take notice
of those subtle Insinuations by which at this present (according to that
observation We can make, and Information We can receive) they endeavor to
poison the hearts and corrupt the Allegiance of such of Our good Subjects who
cannot so clearly discern their malice and impostures. First, by urging and
pressing that false groundless Imputation of Our favoring Popery, and Our
employing many of that Religion now in Our Army. Secondly, by seducing Our good
people to believe that this Army raised and kept for Our necessary defense (and
without which in all probability the malice of these men had before this taken
Our life from Us) is to fight against, and subdue the Parliament, to take away
the Privileges thereof, and thereby to root out Parliaments, if either of
which were true, We should not have the courage with an Army much greater then
Ours, to hope for success.

For the first, for Our Affection to that Religion, Our continual practice,
Our constant Profession and several Protestations will satisfy all the world,
against which Malice and Treason it self, cannot find the least probable
objection, we wish from Our heart the zeal and Affection of these men to the
true Protestant Religion were as apparent as Ours. For the employing men of
that Religion in Our present service in the Army, whosoever considers the
hardness and straights the malice and fury of these men have driven Us to,
their stopping all passages and ways that neither men or money might come to
Us, their declaring all such to be Traitors who shall assist Us, their
entertaining men of all Countries, all Religions, to serve against Us, would
not wonder, if We had been very well contented to have received the service and
Assistance of any of Our good Subjects who had Loyalty enough (whatsoever their
Religion is) to bring them to Our succor. All men know the great number of
Papists which serve in their Army, Commanders, and others, the great Industry
they have used to corrupt the Loyalty and Affection of all Our Subjects of that
Religion, the private promises and undertakings they have made to them, that if
they would assist them against Us, all the Laws made in their prejudice should
be repealed, yet neither the weakness of Our own condition, nor the other Arts
used against Us, could prevail with Us to invite those of that Religion to
come to Our succor or to recall Our Proclamation which forbad them to do so.
And We are confident (though We know of some few whose eminent Abilities in
command and conduct, and moderate and unfactious dispositions has moved Us in
this great necessity to employ them in this service) that a far greater number
of that Religion is in the Army of the Rebels, then in Our own. And We do
assure Our good Subjects though We shall always remember the particular
services which particular men have or shall in this exigent of Ours perform to
Us with that grace and bounty which becomes a just Prince, yet We shall be so
far from ever giving the least countenance or encouragement to that Religion,
that We shall always use Our utmost endeavor to suppress it, by the
execution of those good and wholesome Laws already in force against Papists,
and concurring in such further remedies as the care and wisdom of Us and both
Houses of Parliament shall think most necessary for the Advancement of Gods
service.

For the second, of Our intention to make War upon Our Parliament and so to
root out Parliaments. The scandal is so senseless, when Our Accusation of a
few particular Persons for particular crimes notoriously committed, adjudged by
the known Laws of the Land to be Treason, is evident, that no man can be moved
with it, who does not believe a dozen or twenty factious, seditious Persons, to
be the high Court of Parliament, which consists of King, Lords, and Commons;
and for the Privileges of it, whoever does not believe that to raise an Army
to murder and depose the King, to alter the whole frame of Government and
established Laws of the Land by extemporary, extravagant Votes and resolutions
of either or both Houses, to force and compel the Members to submit to the
faction and Treason of a few, and to take away the Liberty and freedom of
Consultation from them, to be the Privileges of Parliament, must confess that
the Army now raised by Us is no less for the vindication and preservation of
Parliament then for Our own necessary defense. We have often said, and We still
say, that We believe many Inconveniences have grown upon this Kingdom by the
too long intermission of Parliaments, that Parliaments are the only necessary
Sovereign remedies for the growing mischiefs which time and Accidents have and
will always beget in this Kingdom, that without Parliaments the happiness
cannot be lasting to King or People; We have prepared for the frequent
assembling of Parliaments, and will be always as careful of their just
Privileges, as of Our Life, Honor, or Interest; but that those Privileges
should extend so far as has been lately declared, that it should not be
lawful for Us to apprehend the Lord St. John, Captain Windgate, or Captain
Walton, when they came to destroy Us, because they were Members of Parliament,
without the consent of that House of which they were Members, is so ridiculous,
that there need no more to be said in this Argument then the giving these
instances. In a word, as whoever knows in what danger Our Person was in, on
Sunday the 23 of October, can never believe that the Army which gave Us Battle
was raised for Our defense, and preservation; so when they consider how much
the Liberty of the Subject is invaded by their Rapine and Imprisoning; and that
four parts at the least of five of the Members of both Houses are by violence
driven from being present in that Council. That the Book of Common Prayer is
rejected, and no countenance given but to Anabaptists and Brownists, they will
easily find the pretenses of care of the Protestant Religion, the Liberty of
the Subject, and of the Privilege of Parliament to be as vain and pretended,
as those which refer to the safety of Our Person, and preservation of Our
Posterity.

We cannot omit the great pains and endeavors these great pretenders to Peace
and Charity have taken, to raise an implacable malice and hatred between the
Gentry and Commonalty of the Kingdom, by rendering all Persons of Honor,
Courage, and Reputation, odious to the Common people, under the style of
Cavaliers, insomuch as the Highways and Villages have not been safe for
Gentlemen to pass through without violence or Affronts, and by infusing into
them that there was an intention by the Commission of Array to take away a part
of their Estates from them, a scandal so senseless and impossible, that the
contrivers of it well know they might with equal Ingenuity have charged Us
with a purpose of introducing Turcisme or Judisme amongst them, and We hope
when Our good Subjects have well weighed the continual practices of these men
to reject all offers of Treaty, and to suppress truth, and to mislead them by
bold and monstrous falsehoods, they will not think such Arts and ways to lead
to Peace and Unity. And We desire Our good Subjects of all Conditions to
believe that We hold Our Self bound no less to defend and protect the meanest
of Our People (who are born equally free, and to whom the Law of the Land is an
equal Inheritance) then the greatest Subject, and that as the wealth and
strength of this Kingdom consists in the number and happiness of Our People,
which is made up of men of all Conditions, so We shall to the utmost of Our
power endeavor without distinction to give every one of them that Justice and
Protection which is due to them, and We do exhort them all to that charitable
and brotherly Affection one to wards another, that they may be reconciled in a
just duty and Loyalty to Us, which may enable Us for that Protection.

To conclude, We would have all the world know, that We shall never forget the
Protestations and Vows We have made to Allmighty God in Our several
Declarations and Messages to both Our Houses of Parliament. And We are too much
a Christian to believe that We can break those promises, and avoid the Justice
of Heaven.

FINIS.
