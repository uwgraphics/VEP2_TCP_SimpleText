DIONYSIUS CATO, HIS Moral Precepts.

THE PREFACE.
WHEN I observed, how many Men
In manners went awry,
And grossly erred in their course,
From Paths of Piety;
I thought my counsel (to amend,
If happily I might)
Was not amiss; And teach Men how,
To live in happy plight.
Now therefore (my beloved Son)
I will inform thy mind,
To walk a course, whereby thou may,
Both praise and profit find.
So then my precepts read, as that
They may be understood.
For why? to read and not regard,
Is to neglect thy Good.
THE INTRODUCTION.
PRay to thy God with rev'rent fear
And allways love thy Parents dear
Respect thy kindred with good will
Fear to offend your Teachers still.
Keep what is given to thee in Trust
And to the Court prepare thou must.
With upright men, walk where thou wald
To council come thou not uncalled.
Be neat and cleanly, as thou can:
And bid Good Day to every Man.
To all Superiors, give due place.
Slight no Inferiors, with Disgrace.
Keep your Estate, with serious care.
Be bashful ay, where you repair.
Ply well your care in every thing:
Read Books for Learning's cherishing
And what ye read, strive to retain.
Your Family seek to maintain.
Be fair spoken at all essays;
And let not anger blind your eyes.
Mock none least you be mocked again.
The poorest Wretch do not disdain.
Spare not to lend, but look to whom:
And to the Judgment you must come.
Feast rarely: And sleep in due time.
To break your Oath, abhor the crime.
By too much wine, wrong not your health
Fight for your Countries Common wealth
Trust nothing rashly; I advise you:
Flee from all Whores; least they abuse you.
Ply Learning for your future bless,
Let good Men feel your Bounteousness.
Avoid ill speaking: Do not raill.
An honest Name's of great avail.
Judge righteous Judgment: By deserts,
And patience, win your Parents hearts.
Mind well a Benefit received:
Keep watch and waird, when thou art craved.
Give your advice when it is sought;
Make use of Valor, not for naught.
Assuage your anger, and subdue it.
Let Tops be used and Dice eschew'd.
Though thou be strong, no violence do;
And no Inferior overthrow.
Covet not, what is none of thine.
Love thy Spouse, and against foes combine
Train up your Children virtuously:
Thine own Law thou must underly:
Speak spareingly at Banquet-Table,
Press what is just, when thou art able
And willingly endure Loves pain:
To love, and to be loved again.
DIONYSIUS CATO, HIS MORAL PRECEPTS. Translated out of Latin Hexameter, into
English Meeter; By J. M.
BOOK I.
1
IF GOD Almighty be a Sp'rit,
As Writings testify,
He must be worshipped aright,
In Sp'rit and Verity.
2.
Be watchful always; And to sleep
Let not thy Mind be bent;
For Ease continual unto Vice,
Affords nourishment.
3.
Of moral Virtues hold it chief,
The unbridled Tongue to tame;
Next unto GOD is He, that can
With reason rule the same.
4.
Repugnant to thy self in ought,
By varying scorn to be:
For he, that from himself dissents,
With no Man will agree.
5.
If thou survey the Lives of Men,
And manners of the time,
While each reproves another faults,
What Man is free from Crime?
6.
Abandon things that hurtful are,
Though dear to thee they seem:
In time, thy private profit, more
Than Wealth, thou must esteem.
7.
Be constant, and [if cause require,]
Unstable seem to be:
Wise Men their Manners sometimes change,
And yet from fault are free.
8.
Believe not rashly what thy wife
Of Servants shall relate:
For oftimes whom the Husband loves
The Wife is found to hate.
9.
If thou [in kindness] warn a man
Self-willed and loath to hear:
Yet leave not off thy course begun,
If he to thee be dear.
10.
With jangling fellows, full of words,
Contend thou not in vain:
For speech is common unto all,
But Wisdom few attain.
11.
So love thy Friends, as to thy self,
A loving Friend thou be:
So bound thy Bounty to the best,
As harm pursue not thee.
12.
Flee Tales and Rumors; Least of News
A Coiner thou be thought:
For silence seldom hurts a Man,
But speech much care has wrought.
13.
On trust to others words, make thou
No promise, least thou break;
For Faith and Truth is rare; Because
Most mean not as they speak.
14.
When other Men commend thee most,
Judge of thy merit so:
As thou believe not more their Words,
Then what thy self does know.
15.
Each pleasure done thee by a friend,
To many make thou known:
But what to others thou have done,
Keep to thy self alone.
16.
When thou art old, and shall report
The Acts of diverse Men:
Remember well thy youthful times
And what thy self did then.
17.
Take no regard what Standers by
In private whispering chat;
A guilty Conscience still mistrusts,
Her self is aimed at.
18.
In time of wealth, remember woe;
Mutations are not strange.
All humane things are ordered so,
To have their Interchange.
19.
Since frail and doubtful is our life,
Unknown our dying day:
To live in hope of others Death,
Great folly does bewray.
20.
If from thy poor well-wishing Friend
Some slender Gift be sent:
In thankful ways accept his love,
And praise his good intent.
21.
Since naked from the womb thou came,
As Nature formed thee there;
The burden of external wants,
With patience, see thou bear.
22.
Dread not thy death, in time to come,
Nor fear the fatal Knife:
Who dreads his end, therein exiles
The comforts of his Life.
23.
If Friends, to whom thou have been kind,
Thy kindness naught regard,
Accuse not Fate; But blame thy self:
Be wiser afterward.
24.
The better to supply thy want,
Spare what thy hand has got:
And that thou may thy penny save,
Suppose thou had it not.
25.
What in thy power rests to perform
Twice promise not, for shame
Least [while thou would be civil thought,]
Thy lightness all Men blame.
26.
Who speaks right fair and loves thee not,
Like measure let him find;
So Art by Art is met withal,
And falsehood in her kind.
27
Approve not fawning Flatterers,
Whose words are full of Wiles,
Most sweetly sounds the Fowlers call,
Whiles he the Bird beguiles.
28.
If wedded thou have Children store,
And little wealth to give,
Then train them up in honest Arts,
That each may learn to live.
29.
Things that be cheap imagine dear,
Things dear as cheap esteem.
So neither niggard to thy self,
Nor greedy shall thou seem.
30.
What fault thou finds with other Men,
Let not be found in thee,
Foul shame in him, that vice reproves,
Himself not to be free.
31.
What is thy due, thou may require,
Or what seems honest, crave:
But folly were it, to desire
A thing, thou should not have.
32.
Things known, before things never tried
Prefere, if thou be wise:
Since those by Judgment are discerned,
But these by mere surmise.
33.
Since Life in daily danger lies,
and issues doubtful are:
Each day thou liv'st account thou gain,
that captive are to care.
34.
Sometimes, when thou may Victor be,
Give place as vanquished,
By yiedling up in Courtesy,
Kind Friends are conquered.
35.
Great things requiring, grudge thou not,
Small Charges to bestow:
For by this means 'twixt Friend and Friend,
Does favor greatly grow.
36.
With whom thou art in League of Love,
To quarrel think profane;
Brauls hatred breeds, and friendship breaks;
But Peace does Love maintain.
37.
When careless Servants move thy mind
To Wrath, and ireful Rage;
Do naught in choler, till the time
Thy Fury shall assuage.
38.
Whom thou by force may conquer, seek
By suff'rance to convince:
Of moral Virtues wise Men hold
Sweet Patience Sovereign Prince.
39.
Keep rather Goods by labor got,
Than spend till things be scant:
In loss to work and toill afresh,
Is still to live in want.
40.
If wealth abound, be liberal
Each Friendship to reward:
Yet so as always of thy self,
Thou have a due regard.
Dionysius Cato, His MORAL PRECEPTS.
BOOK II.
The PREFACE.
OF Tillage if perhaps thou would,
The Skill exactly know.
Read Learned Virgil, whose Discourse
Each thing at large does show.
But if of Herbs and Plants the Force
Thou rather wish to find,
Lo Macer writtes a Book in Verse,
To satisfy thy Mind.
^f Roman Wars and bloody Broils
Of Carthage please thee more:
Search Lucan, who of Mars his Stirs
And Stratagems has store.
Or if by reading thou desire,
The Laws of Love to Learn,
In Nasoes wanton Legend, lo,
This Art thou may discern.
But if thy chiefest Care intend,
A wise Man's state to see:
Then listen thou to lead a Life
From filthy Vices free.
Approach, I say, and to my Lore.
Attend while I relate,
What Wisdom is, and how by her,
Thou may be fortunate.
1
EVEN unto strangers (if thou may'st]
Do good, in time of need:
For friends, by love and bounty won,
A kingdoms worth exceed.
2.
What heaven and Gods high secrets are,
Waste not thy wits to learn:
Since thou art mortal, mind the things
Which mortal men concern.
3.
Fond fear of Death abandon quite,
As follies foul effect:
Which, who so dreads, all joy of life,
Does utterly reject.
4.
In disputation suffer not,
Incensed wrath to rise;
Which wit and judgment so beguiles,
That truth obscured lies.
5.
Spare for no cost, when time shall serve,
And cause require the same,
A penny better spent then spared,
Adds to an honest name.
6.
Abandon Superfluities,
With little rest content:
Safe is the bark on calmer streams
To wished Haven bent.
7.
Remember well (as wisdom would,)
To hide thy proper shame:
Lest what thy private self-mislikes
Incur more public blame.
8.
Think not that men offending often
Can closely so conceal
Their faults: but that one time shall sure
Their secret Sins reveal.
9.
A man of limbs and stature small
Disdain not in thy pride:
For Natur's want by wisdoms wealth
Is commonly Supplied.
10.
Contending with superior powers
Take heed in time to yield:
For often the party Vanquished,
Has after won the field.
11.
Against thy friend, by force of words,
Strive not in any ways:
Sometimes of words (which are but wind)
Great controversies rise.
12.
What God intends, endeavor not
By lot, to know or shun.
What he determines, touching thee,
Without thee shall be done.
13.
Eschew, by over nice attires,
Foul Envyes hateful sting:
Which (though it hurt not,) to endure
Is yet an irksome thing.
14.
By wrongful Judgment overthrown,
Thy self discourage not:
By doom unjust who overcomes,
Not long enjoyes his lot.
15.
Once reconciled, rip not up
The wrongs of former days:
Old Sores to rub, and wrath revive,
A wicked mind bewrayes.
16.
To praise or discommend thy self,
Are things alike unfit:
For so do fools whom glory vain,
Bereaves of common wit.
17.
In midst of plenty, keep a mean,
Spend not thy self too fast:
Goods, long in gathering, often are seen
In little time to waste.
18.
To play the fool in time and place
Occasion serving fit,
Amongst the wisest is esteemed
The primest point of Wit.
19.
Flee wanton Riot, and withal
Eschew the common Fame
Of Avarice; Both which Extremes
Impair a Man's good Name.
20.
Believe not lightly every Tale,
Each Babbler shall relate:
Small Credit crave his idle Words
That uses much to prate.
21.
The Sin of Surfeit pardon not:
Do Penance for the same:
Not Wine, but Drinkers foul Abuse,
That does deserves Blame.
22.
Thy Secrets to a secret Friend,
Commit, if thou be wise:
Thy crazed Body to his Trust,
That Health by Art supplies.
23.
Ungodly Persons thriving fast
Let not thy Mind affright:
For Fortune favors wicked Men.
To Work them farther Spite.
24
Provide for After-Claps in time,
And arm thy self to bear;
So shall thou in expected Broiles,
Prevent both Harm and Fear.
25.
In time of trouble, be not like
A wounded Man, half slain,
But hope the best: For Hope alone
Revives the Dead again.
26.
Neglect not fit Occasion, for
Thy proper Good assigned:
Old Father Time has hairy Locks
Before, but not behind.
27.
Look back what follows, and withal
Forseee what stands in place.
This Wisdom may that Emblem teach,
Of Janus double Face.
28.
Sometimes, for Health, spare diet use;
For though of Dainties store
Dame Pleasure crave; Yet to thy Health
Thou art addebted more.
29.
The Judgment of the Multitude
Despise not thou alone:
Lest while thou many Men contemn'st
Thy self be liked of none.
30.
Of wished Health have chiefest Care,
Prefer thy Health to all:
If evil Diet make thee sick,
Blame not the Spring nor Fall.
31.
Regard not Dreams; For what Men's Thoughs
Broad waking entertain,
And wish, or hope, then muse upon,
In Sleep appears again.
Dionysius Cato, His MORAL PRECEPTS.
BOOK III.
The PREFACE.
GOOD Reader, whosoever thou art,
That takes this Book in Hand,
These brief Directions good for Life,
Give heed to understand.
With honest Precepts store thy Mind,
Learn well their wise Contents.
For Life of civil Learning void,
Death's Image represents,
Great Profit may thou reap thereby,
Which if thou not respect,
Not me the Writer, but thy self
Thou chiefly shall neglect.
1
WHereas thou lead'st an upright life,
Regard not causeless wrongs:
By base detractors offered; for
Thou can not rule Men's tongues.
^
(...) ^^ll'd by law, against thy Friend,
(...) ^^^^ess crimes forepast:
(...) honest reputation saved.]
^^^ceale them what thou may.
3.
Of fawning words and flattering speech,
beware, [in any ways,]
For simple truth unmasked walks,
But fraud fair words disguise.
4.
Flee beastly sloth, the bane of life:
Some honest business do.
An idle mind decays it self,
And wastes the body too.
5.
To make both mind and body strong,
No labor then refuse:
But in thy many careful toils
Some recreation use.
6.
To carp at others words, let not
Thy wit be ill applied;
Least by thine own example taught,
Another the deride.
^.
What by deceased Friends bequeathed,
Is happened to thy Lot,
Keep and increase, that common Fame
A Spend-Thrift call thee not.
^.
Of Riches, if thy latter age
A greater portion find:
Abound in Bounty, and abhor
A wretched Miser's Mind.
^
Sage counsel from thy Servants mouth,
Disdain not to respect;
^or any Men's advice, that may
Thy proper good effect.
^.
If wonted wealth and substance fail,
Yet banish Care and Grief;
and live content with what the times,
Shall yield for thy Relief.
11.
Beware thou marry not a Wife,
For Wealth and Wordly store;
And if she falsity her Faith,
Admit her Love no more.
12.
By many Men's example learn,
What to embrace or flee:
An others Life, in this behalf,
May thine instructor be.
13.
Attempt not matters past thy strength,
Left over-prest with pain,
Thy Labor fail: and so thy work
And Enterprise prove vain.
14.
What ill thou know of others wrought
Spare not in time to tell:
Lest by thy silence thou subscribe,
and seem to like it well.
15.
By Law unjust condemned, seek
The Judges help to have:
For Laws themselves by Equity,
To be reformed crave.
16.
What penalty deserved inflicts,
To bear thou must not grudge;
For guilty to thy self in ought,
Thy self thou ought to judge.
17.
Improve thy self by Reading much,
And mending things amiss:
For Poets many marvels write,
Whose Credit doubtful is.
18.
At Feasts and Banquets busy not
Thy Tongue, with too much chat:
Lest while thou would be pleasant thought,
Thy Talk be laughed at,
19.
The Speeches of thy angry Wife,
Let not thy Courage daunt:
For Women with their wily Tears,
Their Husbands often enchant.
20.
Use that thou have, to do thee good,
But see thou make no waste;
Who vainly spend their own, and want,
Seek other Men's at last.
21.
Resolve, fond fear of future Death
To banish from the still:
Which, though it be not good it self,
Yet makes an end of ill.
22.
With inward and Religious love
Thy Parents both embrace:
And to offend thy Mother dear
forbear in any case.
Dionysius Cato, His MORAL PRECEPTS.
BOOK IV.
The PREFACE.
WHOSOEVER thou art that do desire
To lead a quiet Life,
And touching Manners, to eschew
Corruptions that are rise.
This little Volume often revolve,
Wherein thy self shall find
Such Precepts, grave as (Tutor-like,)
May teach and rule thy Mind.
1.
ONE special Note of Blessedness
Is Riches to deny;
Which whosoever covets to engross
Lives always beggarly.
2.
Dame Natures Wealth he cannot want,
Who curbs his vain desires.
And measures his Expense, with what
Necessity requires.
3
Through want of care, if thine Affairs
Succeed not to thy mind:
Accuse not fained Fortune, nor
Reproach her to be blind.
4.
Love Money well; but to the stamp
Put not thy mind in thrall:
Which honest and Religious Men
Do not respect at all.
5.
If thou be rich, bestow the more
On Physic for thine Health;
A rich Man sick has store of Coin,
But wants his chiefest wealth,
6.
If of thy Master thou receive
Correction more severe,
Thine angry Fathers sharp Reproof,
With Patience see thou bear.
7.
In things that profit may procure,
Thy labors exercise:
But never undertake Affairs
Where Doubt or Error lies.
8.
What thou may give, from him that craves
Desire not to detain:
For why to benefit the best,
Is held the greatest Gain.
9
Suspecting ought to find it out,
With speed have due regard:
For things, at first neglected, prove
Mischievous afterward
10.
To Venus damned pleasures prone,
If thou thy self distrust,
Forbear to feed on costly Meats,
As Motives unto Lust.
11.
Whereas thou shunest savage Beasts,
Whose Forces fearful are:
I only wish thee to avoid
Lewd Men, more cruel far.
12.
Not strength of able Limbs alone,
That others most surmount,
But wisdom, manageing the Might,
True Valor Men Account.
13.
Seek Comfort of thy constant Friend,
Afflicted if thou be:
For no Physician in his Cure,
May more prevail then he.
14.
For thine Offense, why should thy Beast
In Sacrifice be slain?
To hope for Health by others Death,
Fond Folly does maintain
15.
A good Companion, or a Friend
In seeking to select:
Regard not what his Fortunes are:
His honest Name respect.
16.
Make use of Wealth, and scorn the Name
Of Niggard evermore.
What good do Riches to tho Man
That starves in midst of store?
17.
If thou desire in Life and Death
A good report to find:
All Earthly pleasures, vain and vile,
Abandon from thy mind.
18.
Deride not Ages dull conceit,
In things to thee more plain,
For whosoever lives till he be Old,
Shall wax a Child again.
19.
Learn something, and if Suddenly
Thy Substance should decay:
Thy Skill remaining may relieve
Thy Wants another way.
20.
Observe with Silence whereunto
Each ones Discourse does tend;
For Speech Men's Manners does cnoceal
And utters in the end.
21.
Though learned, yet thy Studies grave
By no means intermit:
As labor keeps the hand in use,
So practice helps the wit.
22.
Regard not how the Fates conspire
In time to work thee Spite;
He dreads not Death, in doubtful Life
That learns not to delight.
23.
Learn; But of such as learned are,
Thy self instruct the rest,
For knowledge, where it may do good,
Ought not to be suppressed.
24
Drink what thou can: For forced Draughts
Men's Health does much impair;
Such beastly Pleasures oftentimes
Procures the Bodies Care.
25
What ever thing thou shall approve,
Or Praise in public place;
Condemn not lightly afterward,
Lest thou sustain Disgrace.
26,
In time of calm and quiet rest,
Remember storms aloft;
Again in trouble hope the best,
Since Fortune alters often.
27.
To learning still thy mind apply,
By study wisdom grows;
And prudence rare, to industry,
In time her Treasure shows.
28
Commend thy Friend more sparingly
And rest content with this;
That time at length shall manifest
His Merit, what it is.
29
Blush not, of Ignorance, to show
Thy willingness to learn;
As wit's a glory, so scandalous for those,
Who nothing will discern.
30
In Wine and Women (wise men say)
Both good and evil rest:
What therefore is in either bad
Refuse, and take the best.
31
Of sad and sullen countenanced
And silent Men, beware;
For when the stream is calmest, there
The waters deepest are.
32
If discontented with thy state,
Thou weigh the sad Decline
Of other men (superiors late)
Thou need to repine.
33
Attempt according to thy strength;
Close by the shore to keep
Is safer, then to hoise up Sails
And launch into the deep.
34
Against a just and upright man,
Contend not wickedly:
For God in justice does revenge
All wrong and injury.
35
Bereft of Riches, sorrow not,
Nor vex thy self in vain:
Be rather merry, if thou may
Recover them again.
36
To suffer loss of all, a wrack
Intolerable were:
Yet things there are, which patiently
Behooves a friend to bear.
37.
In no ways promise, to thy self,
Long Life and many Years:
For like a shadow at the back,
Death every where appears.
38
With incense make the Altar smoke,
Spare Oxen to the Plow;
Burnt Sacrifice with Blood embru'd,
The LORD does not allow.
39.
Give Fortune place, and bear thy self
To mighty Men submiss:
For he that knows to yield in time,
May profit him and his.
40
In often offending, never free
Thy fault, from punishment;
In cureing wounds one smart (we see)
Another does prevent.
41
Thy ancient friend dishonor not,
Though he unconstant prove,
And change his manners; yet respect
The bonds of former love.
42
To gain the greater Love of all,
In thankfullness abound:
Lest thou incurr the Name of one,
In whom deserts are drowned.
43
Flee vain Suspicions, lest thou lead
Thy Life in Misery:
For fearful and surmising Folks
Are aptest still to die.
44.
When for thy proper use thou buyer
bond-Servants now and then,
And call'st them Slaves; Remember yet
That they are also Men.
45.
Occasion fit to apprehend,
With speed have due respect;
Lest afterward thou seek in vain,
What late thou did neglect.
46
Rejoice not in the sudden Death,
Of Sinners caught away:
For Saints, whose Lives unspotted are,
Must Death's Arrest obey.
47.
If thou be poor, and have withal
A Wife of ill report:
Bar such, as by the Name of Friends,
Would to thy House resort.
48.
Although by Studies thou be brought,
Deep matters to discern;
Yet show thy self in things unknown
Desireous still to learn.
49.
And wonder, not that plainest words
My Poems entertain;
Since brevity my Muse affects,
To help the shallow Brain.
FINIS.
