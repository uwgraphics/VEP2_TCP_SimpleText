London printed in the year 1663.

DEar Children, and Chosen vessels of the Eternal Everliving God, whom he has
plucked as brands out of the fire, and has Manifested his heavenly powerful
operating Spirit, to lead you in his holy fear, to wait upon him in the way of
his Judgments, which has buried and baptized Self in the death: that you
could not find any Comfort or Satisfaction unto your hungry thirsty Souls, but
in lying down, in true subjection to the Judgments of the Lord, manifest in
the light, until the Lord broke in upon you [when your wills were subjected]
with his tender love and bowels of free mercy, which caused the dead to live,
the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak forth the wonders of
the Lord.

Oh you dear Companions, in the tribulations, and patience of Jesus, when I
remember you, my heart is broken, and as a man overcome, with the Compassions
of the Lords love that flows out toward you; in which my Soul exhorts you to
dread the Lord, and fear continually before the heavenly Majesty of our God,
and be faithful upon your watch that the Enemy which you know goes abroad as a
roaring Lion to devour you, that he may be trampled upon, and never get
Entrance, to stain your pure garments: which you know never could be washed but
in the blood of the Lamb: And all take heed of giving way in the least measure,
to what you know would entangle you in any bondage, do not rely upon your own
strength, though you have and do reign in the glorious dominion standing in the
Light, yet if there be the least harkening to the Enemy to tamper with him,
though you may think you may be able to subject the disposition of nature he
works upon, if he draw you from the Light you will be ensnared, and distress
and sorrow will come upon you as an Armed man, and under Gods Judgments you
must lie, until the Lord raise you up again in the renewings of his mercy, in
the Light of his own Covenant.

Therefore, dear Children, of the Immortal birth, I cannot but say once more
unto you, Watch, watch with all circumspection and diligence, stand faithful
upon your watch, that in the Light of the Lord the eye of discerning be kept
open in you, that you may discern the Mysterious workings of the subtle Enemy
of your souls peace: And take heed of taking any liberty to your selves in any
thing but what you know stands approved in the Light, power and life, which
has so freely manifested it self in regenerating and renewing you in the
spirit of your minds, let your souls continually prize the Light, and the
Sin condemning power to love it above all things, that you may stand in the
Marriage-union in the power which destroys the works of the Devil, and keeps
the Soul in pure freedom to walk with the Lord, rejoicing in the daily Cross,
where Self is crucified, and the Soul set free, in the pure Liberty, in the
love and life of the most High, to magnify and praise his name, in the beauty
of holiness, for ever and ever.

Oh beloved ones! look not at Self, nor at any storm or tempest that arises
through temptation or trials of what nature soever, as to vail you, from
beholding of the lovely coentenance of Jesus the beloved of our Souls: Oh lift
up your heads all that love the Light; for the Lord our God, in the bowels of
everlasting compassions will draw near you more and more; and he will carry his
tender Lambs in his Arms, and the dear suckling Babes at the Breasts of his
Consolation; and to cause his young men in Christ to rejoice in the purity of
his nature, and the handmaids and daughters of Glory to triumph in his
Comeliness, with which he will cover them that love the Light and his pure
nature better then their lives: the aged among his people he will cloth them
with Wisdom, and the grave, solid, ponderous, weighty Spirit shall more and
more possess the Ancients among his Children, a pure perfect eternal Judgment,
he has placed in the midst of thee, oh Sion, that shall keep forth, and bind
the ravenous ones, for it shall be as a wall, for the preservation of his
lovely City Jerusalem, and great is and shall be the encreasings of God upon
all thy inhabitants, that abhor self, and love the light, and delights to
walk in faithfulness up to the requirings of the Lord in this his dreadful
day, wherein he is purging his Sanctuary through great sufferings according to
the word of the Lord as has been declared, let no discouragement be upon your
Spirits, for the mighty Jehovah is with every particular babe of his Kingdom,
and dear and precious is your lives in the sight of the Lord: a woman may
forget her sucking child, but the Lord will not forget you that trust in his
mercies; and though the Cup look bitter, which many has to drink in this
trying day, fear not, you beloved people, but stand approved in the light of
Jesus, and what ever you meet withal, his presence will accompany you, in
sweetning your passage daily more and more for his bowels yearns abundantly to
you, who in the holy resolution in his heavenly power, is freely given up to do
and suffer what ever the pleasure of the Lord is, that he may glorify his name
in the earth, in disposing of you to the eternal renown of his name for ever.

Oh you dear babes of the holy Seed, abide in your safe dwelling, in the light
over all fear of what ever man can do, for the determination of God is, not
any more wrath shall have power, then shall turn to his praise, for the Lord
has given his Angels charge over you, and they pitch their tents continually
about you, and in vain it is for man to strive to afflict you whom the Lord
will save, or to destroy whom the Lord will preserve; Therefore be glad, oh
Sion, in thy God this day, and let thy inhabitants oh Jerusalem shine forth in
the glory of the heavenly power of the most high God, who dwells in the midst
of thee, for the day of thy deliverance he is hastening, and to make
inquisition for the blood of thy tender Children, who has suffered spoylings of
their Goods, and many Stripes, Prisons, Afflictions, and death for the word of
God, and Testimony of Jesus Christ: Therefore in the word of his patience,
every one stand in your several conditions, gird up in the light, the mind to
the Lord unmovable in his strength to bear your Testimonies, the strong
leading the weak by the hand, that all in the gentle sweet leading Spirit of
life, in eternal Unity live and walk in the heavenly Authority, in peace and
faithfulness until death, where the Crown of eternal glory shall be your
reward in the power of his everlasting dominion to praise and magnify his name
with hallelujahs and high praises in the beauty of his life for ever and for
evermore, Amen.

And further this arises in my heart dear beloved vessels wheresoever God has
placed you in the earth (whatever appears amongst the children of men) in the
light of Christ stand still and dwell in your peaceable rest for ever, that to
the witness of God in every conscience we may be manifest, to be the Children
of the eternal God of peace; in whom is our diligent watchings, and waitings
upon our God, to order us in his power and wisdom, in our peaceable lives to
be a blessing to all the inhabitants of the land of our nativity, from the
highest to the lowest in what we may, to persuade them to walk in the fear of
the Lord, that they may escape in the day of terrible wrath, which the mighty
God will manifest in the day of his dreadful vengeance upon the ungodly, that
so by our conversation in Christ, the measure of God in all their consciences
may testify for us, that in us the peaceable holy Seed is raised which the
Lord has blessed, and in which we know that neither height, nor depth,
principalities nor powers, things present, nor things to come, prisons,
nakedness, peril or sword, life nor death can never separate us from the sweet
refreshing, life and peace we have together in Christ our righteousness,
strength and dominion for ever,

In whom rests the soul of your brother in the word of his patience with you,
farewell. Will. Deusbury.

Dear Friends,
KEep your Meetings diligently in the name and fear of the Lord, and watch in
the Light least the Enemy enter through the natural inclinations, to draw your
minds into the visible things which be temporal and fading, for so worldly
encumbrances, cares and false fears may over-charge your hearts, and weaken you
in the day of trial: Therefore I say unto you in the name of the Lord which
has been your help and hiding place, keep together, and let neither worldly
business nor the terror of the wicked break your Meetings, but so much the
more as trials increase wait upon the Lord that your strength may be renewed;
and love one another with an upright heart and pure mind, and watch not for
evil! least the enemy lay an occasion to stumble in your way, and be tender of
the motions of life in one another, least the Spirit be quenched: speak as ye
are moved, and pray as ye are moved, and God will hear and help you, and ye
shall glorify, him to whom I have committed you, and yet do in spirit and mind
pray for you, that in the life, power, and wisdom of God ye may be kept in the
hour of temptation, that ye who have gone through many trials for the truths
sake may by no means nor devices of the Enemy be beguiled of your reward, which
is laid up for all that endures to the end: Receive this as the Salutation of
my dearest love to you all that have believed the truth.

John Whitehead.


ANd Friends take heed of striving or joining with them which strive one with
another, unless it be to excel in Virtue, Meekness, Humility and Patience,
for strife about words and other men's matters will eat out the Unity and Love
which you should have one to another in the life of truth: and look not forth
at the words of any, but as you feel them in the Spirit and power that keeps
low and in the denial of self in their own particular, and mind your standing
on the foundation which is already laid, for that is in it self sure and
everlasting; and let every one take heed what they build thereon, for every
man's work shall be tried, and all that which abides not the fire shall be
consumed by it.

I. W

The End.
