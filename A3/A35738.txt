DAGON's FALL OR, The WHIGS Lamentation for the Death of Anthony King of Poland.
Ag(...) Ld shaftsbury
To the Tune of, Philander, etc. 3. feb. 1683/2
[1]
AH Cruel Bloody Fate!
What can thou now do more?
Alas! it is now too late
Poor Toney to restore:
Why should the flattering Fates persuade,
That Toney still should live,
In England here,
Or in Holland there,
Yet all our hopes deceive.
[2]
A Noble Peer He was,
And of Notorious Fame;
But now He Is gone (alas!)
A Pilgrim over the Main:
The Prop and Pillar of our hope
The Patron of our CAUSE;
The Scorn and Hate
Of Church and State,
The Urchin of the Laws.
[3]
Of matchless Policy
Was this Renowned Peer,
The bane of Monarchy,
The Peoples Hope and Fear,
The Joy of all True-Protestants,
The Tories Scorn and Dread;
But now He Is gone
Who cursed the Throne,
Alas! poor Toney's dead.
[4]
For Commonwealth He stood,
Pretending Liberty;
And for the Public Good
Would pull down Monarchy:
The Church and State he would divorce,
The Holy CAUSE to wed:
And in time did hope
To confound the Pope,
To be himself the Head.
[5]
A TAP in's side he bore,
To broach all forts of Ill,
For which Seditious Store
The Crowd adored him still:
He spit his Venom through the Town,
With which the Saints possessed,
Would preach and prate
Against Church and State,
While He performed the rest.
[6]
When any change of State,
Or Mischief was at hand,
He had a working Pate,
And Devil, at command:
He forged a PLOT, for which the Heads
Of Faction gave their Votes;
But now the PLOT
Is gone to pot,
What will become of Oats?
[7]
Under the fair pretense
Of Right, Religion, Law,
Excluding the True Prince,
The Church would overthrow:
With such Religious Shams he brought
The Rabble on his side;
And, for his sport,
The Town and Court
In Parties would divide.
[8]
Now what is become of all
His squinting Policy
Which wrought your Dagon's Fall,
From Justice forced to fly?
Old and Decrepid, full of pains,
As he of Guilt was full:
He fell to Fate,
And now (too late)
He leaves us to condole.
[9]
Now, learn ye Whigs in time,
By his deserved Fall,
To expiate his Crime,
Ever Fate revenge you all;
For Rights, Religion, Liberty,
Are but the Sham-pretence
To Anarchy;
But Loyalty
Obeys the Lawful Prince:
