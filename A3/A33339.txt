TO His dearly beloved Friends, and Neighbors, Members of the Church of Christ
that meet in Bennet Fink, London.
Dearly beloved Friends,
I Have much desired, and longed for an opportunity to express, and make known
my grateful heart unto you, for those many favors, and expressions of love
which I have received from you: For whereas by reason of the iniquities of the
times, and the cruelty of the common enemy, I was banished from my home, and
that station wherein the Lord had seated me with much comfort, it pleased God
to direct your hearts to make choice of me for your Minister; and since that
time (being now eleven years) I have never found your affections cooled, but
rather more, and more inflamed and increased toward me: No small mercy in
these giddy, and unstable times! and as a real demonstration thereof, you have
been very solicitous to provide for my comfortable subsistence amongst you,
wherein I may use the Apostles expression, 2 Cor. 8. 3. That to your power, yea
I bear record, beyond your power, you have been willing: But that which
especially has ministered most comfort unto me, is your professed subjection
to the Gospel of Christ, evidenced remarkably in this particular, which I
desire to speak of to Gods glory, your credit, and that your zeal may provoke
others. I never had occasion to move you in any just and honest business,
whether of public or private concernment, wherein I have not found your
readiness, and forwardness to concur with, and answer my expectation: My
hearts desire, and earnest prayer to God for you is, that you may yet abound
more and more in every good word, and work, that so fighting the good fight of
faith, you may finish your course with joy: For which end I beseech you in the
bowels of Jesus Christ, that you mark them which would cause divisions, and
offenses among you, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid
them: For many false Prophets are gone out into the world in Sheeps clothing,
which yet inwardly are ravening Wolves, begu^ling unstable souls, who like
little children are carried about with every wind of Doctrine. Ye therefore,
Beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led
away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own steadfastness, 2 Pet. 3.
17. And the God of all grace, who has called us into his eternal glory by
Jesus Christ, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
strengthen, and settle you: which shall ever be the hearty prayer, and earnest
endeavor of him who is

Devoted to the service of your Faith, Sa. Clark.

THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
Christian Reader,
THis Book which I now present unto thee is the fruit of my spare hours, it
having been my recreation for these many years to read the best Histories which
I could meet with: and for the help of my memory, I have collected the
eminentest, and most remarkable examples which did occur, and reduced them
under several heads distinguished into*severall Chapters: which I have found
very useful, profitable, and pleasing unto me, and presuming that they may be
so to others also; I have now this second time published them to the world,
that so they which neither have money to buy, nor leisure to read many Volumes,
may find in this little Epitome the choicest, and chiefest things that are
contained in them: I have also sometimes set down more pleasant stories, which
may have their use, and prevent tediousness to the Reader, though in such
great variety of History, I suppose there is no great danger of nauseousnesse.
But besides what I have collected out of the Authors themselves, I have met
with many examples in several Treatises, and Sermons which have been lately
published; but what I have borrowed from them I hope I shall repay with
interest by this ensuing Collection. I have also inserted some memorable
examples from my own observation, which were never before in Print: I presume
that it will be superfluous for me to tell thee, what great benefit thou may
reap by acquainting thy self with these Examples: Do thou live in places of
danger, and times of persecution? here thou may see how powerful, and
merciful the Lord is in supporting, or delivering his people in such times.
Do thou see the enemies of Gods Church to thrive, and pro^per in their
malice, and cruelty? here thou may see what the end of them is like to be,
if they speedily repent not. Would thou see the amiablenesse, and
desireablenesse of virtues, and Graces? here thou may see it held forth unto
thee in excellent Mirrours, or Looking-Glasses. Would thou behold the
ugliness, and danger of great, and horrid sins? Behold here Examples of the
severity of Gods Judgments against them. Would thou find out, and propose
some choice Patterns, and Presidents for thine imitation? Here thou shall find
store, and variety of them. These, with diverse other uses, and benefits may be
made of these examples, which I freely impart to thee, with prayer for Gods
blessing upon thee, and them, and desiring the like courtesy at thy hands, I
rest,

Thine in the Lord, Sa. Clark.

EXAMPLES OF Miracles of Gods Mercies to His CHILDREN.
CHAP. I.
THe people of God, who live in such times wherein public dangers and
persecutions are approaching, being conscious to their own infirmities, and
weakness, are many times much perplexed, and distracted with the fears, and
apprehensions of the ensuing perils, and through weakness of Faith much
question whether they be able to undergo such conflicts, and endure such
temptations as the people of God formerly have done? or whether the power of
God does so eminently appear in these latter times for the deliverance of his
Church, and Children, as in the time of the Old Testament, and in the first
primitive times of the Gospel it did? But certainly the Name of God is
wonderful still: His arm is not shortened that it cannot save, nor his ear
heavy that it cannot hear: So that we may assure our selves, that either he
will preserve us from, or support us under, or deliver us out of any
temptation, that may or shall befall us: For God never puts his servants to
suffer, but he furnishes them with spiritual sufficiency to go through with
the same. And like as a prudent Commander makes not choice of white-livered
Soldiers for hot service and high attempts; but of those of greatest
experience, and most approved valor: so God singles out his valiantest
Soldiers for strongest encounters, his best Scholars for the largest lessons,
his choicest armor for the highest proof, the most courageous Christians for
the sorest afflictions. And that the truth hereof may the more clearly appear,
view seriously th^se ensuing examples, both of the ancient and modern times,
which as they were first recorded for the public benefit: so are they now
collected out of several authors of good credit for our present instruction,
and consolation.

MArcus A^relius the Emperor, who raised the Eusebius.

Ignatius Bishop of Antioch, being apprehended, Let the fire, the Cross, the
Beasts, the breaking of bones, convulsion of members, and bruising of the whole
body, yea, and the torments of the Devil seize upon me; provided that I may
partake of Jesus Christ, I pass them not. Also when he was cast unto the wild
beasts, he allured them to devour him, saying, That if he were ground with
their teeth, he should be found fine flour in the house of his Father. Eusebius.

John Bishop of Bergomum, a godly and reverend Lombards for his wickedness:
the King desirous of revenge, commanded him to be sent home upon a fierce
horse, which used to cast his riders, and tear them to pieces: but the godly
Bishop being mounted upon him, he laid aside his fierceness, and carried him
home safely to his own house. Platin.

Theodosius, a godly Emperor, fighting against the Eugenius, his Army was in
great danger of being overthrown; but Theodosius having recourse unto God by
prayer, the Lord sent a mighty tempest of wind, which blew so vehemently in
his enemies faces, that it drove back their darts upon themselves, whereby they
were overcome. Ruffin.

Constantius the Emperor, an Arian, being incensed A^banasius a godly Bishop,
sent a Captain with five thousand armed men to slay him; but the Lord
delivered him miraculously: for when they had environed the Church wherein he
was, he passed safely through the midst of them; and though many Arians that
knew him, were present to discover him, yet was he not discerned. Theod. See
his life in my first part.

The City of Nisibis being straightly besieged by Sapores Persia, there was in
the City an holy man of God, Jacobus by name unto whom the Citizens resorted,
beseeching him that he would show himself upon the walls, and pray to God for
help against their enemies, which so soon as he had done, the Lord sent a
cloud of gnats and flies among the Persians, whereby the siege was raised, and
the City saved. Simps. Eccles. Hist.

Sanctius a godly Christian under one of the first persecutions, I am a
Christian; whereupon the tormenters applied Plates of Brass red-hot to all the
tenderest parts of his body, which was extreme sore with former scourgings,
whereby his body was so pitifully drawn together, that he retained not the
shape of a man; after which they cast him into prison, and after a few days
(his body being all over so sore that he could scarce endure the least touch)
they bring him forth to new torments, presuming thereby either to force him to
blaspheme, or to die under them; on the contrary, his body was so suppled, and
refreshed by his torments, that he recovered his former shape, and use of his
members, their intended punishment (by the grace of Christ) proving a safe
medicine unto him. Act. and Mon.

In Tire a City of Phenicia, certain Christians being Act. and Mon.

Quirinus Bishop of Scescanus having an hand-mill floated above the water, and
called to the lookers on that they should not be dismayed at his sufferings;
and so at last with much ado he was drowned. Act. and Mon.

The child of a Christian, being but seven years old, that whatsoever men
affirm to be God, must needs be one, which with one is one and the same: and
inasmuch as this one is Christ, of necessity Christ must be the true God. The
Tyrant being amazed at this answer, asked him, where, and of whom he had
learned this lesson? Of my mother (quoth the child) with whose milk I sucked
in this Doctrine. Whereupon the mother was called, and she gladly appeared; The
Tyrant commanded the child to be horsed up, and scourged: the joyful mother
standing by with dry cheeks, whilst all the beholders wept: yea, she rebuked
her Babe for craving a cup of water to quench his thirst, charging him to
thirst after the cup which the Infants of Bethlehem once drank of, and to
remember little Isaac, who willingly offered his throat to the sacrificing
knife. Whilst she thus counseled him, the bloody Tyrant pulled off the skin
from the crown of his head: the mother cried, Suffer, my child, for anon thou
shall pass to him who will adorn thy naked head with a crown of glory. Whereby
the child was so encouraged, that he received the stripes with a smiling
countenance: After which the Tyrant cast him into prison, and shortly after
commanded him to be beheaded; at which time the mother taking up her child
into her arms, kissed him, and being required, she delivered him to the
Executioner, saying, Farewell, my sweet child: and whilst his head was
cutting off, she sang, All land and praise with heart and voice,
O Lord, we give to thee,
To whom the death of all thy Saints
We know full dear to be.


The head being off, the mother wrapped it in her garments, laid it to her
breast, and so departed. Act. and Mon.

Babilas a godly Christian for the cause of Christ Act. and Mon.

Pope Martin the fifth raised three great armies, intending Bohemians, which
clave to the doctrine of John Husse, and Jerome of Prague; but when they came
to the encounter five several times, each time the said Armies ran away out of
the field, leaving their Tents and surniture behind them, being stricken and
daunted with a causeless fear, before any blow was given, or received; whereby
the godly Bohemians were much encouraged, and enriched: Afterward under their
Captain Zisca they fought eleven battles against the Popes side, and ever went
away victors. Act. and Mon. See Zisca's Life in my second Part.

Ladislaus King of Hungary getting by fraud the two Huniades into his hands,
most cruelly and unjustly caused the eldest of them to be beheaded, who after
he had received three blows from the Hangman, his hands being tied behind
him, rose up upon his feet, and looking (...) heaven, called upon the Lord,
protesting his inno^^^cy, and so laying down his head again, at the fourth blow
was dispatched. Act. and Mon.

Examples of Miraculous provision in times of Famine.
Near unto Aldborough in Suffolk, at what time (viz. England was choked, and
blasted in the ear, there grew up Pease miraculously amongst the rocks without
any earth at all about them, about the end of September, which much brought
down the price of corn. Camb. Brit. p. 466.

In the year 1331. when there was a great famine Ireland, the mercy of God so
disposed, that upon the twenty seventh of June there came to land a mighty
multitude of sea-fishes called Thurlheds, such as in many ages before had not
been seen there: They came into the Haven of Dublin: Anthony Lord Lucy being
Justice of Ireland, and by the Citizens of Dublin were many of them killed.
Camb. Brit. Irel. p. 184.

Leyden in the Low Countries being straightly Spaniard, Anno 1574. and blocked up
with thirty six forts, the famine grew so great that there died above seven
thousand in the City; whereupon the Prince of Orange by breaking of ditches,
and drawing up of sluices, did what he could to drown the country; but yet the
water was too shallow to carry boats, till God sent a strong Southwest wind
which drove the sea into the rivers, and land, that great boats passed and
victualled the ^own; whereupon the Spaniards raised their siege: but behold the
remarkable work of God! who two days after sent as strong a North-west wind
that beat back the Sea again whence it came. Belg. Com. Wealth. p. 72.

Rochell being besieged with a mighty Army from December 1573. to the month of
June following: a Dearth began to seize upon the godly Protestants which were
within the same; but the Lord seasonably sent a number of fishes called
Surdones into the haven, whereby the poor Inhabitants were relieved during the
continuance of the siege, which being once broken up, the fishes departed, and
were found no more in that coast. Fren. Hist.

A Christian Matron of excellent parts, and piety, Esa. 57. 15. by little and
little abundance of spiritual comfort flowed into her heart, in which condition
she continued many years after, even until her death, which was 1595. Mr.
Bolton.

A virtuous Gentlewoman in this Land, doubting You have often told me that I
must seek no further then Gods Word, but I have been long without comfort, and
can endure no longer: therefore if I must be saved let this glass be kept from
breaking, and therewithal she threw it against the walls: and though the Lord
might have dealt otherwise, yet he was content to satisfy her longing soul
with a miracle: The Glass rebounds again, and comes safe unto the ground:
which the Minister taking up, said, Oh repent of this sin, and bless God for
his mercy, never distrust him more of his promise. Bolton. Yates. See this more
fully in my first part of Lives. In the life of Master Fox.

Mistress Katharine Brettergh upon her deathbed, was Woe, woe, woe, etc. a weak,
a woeful, a wretched, a forsaken woman! but at length, by Gods wonderful mercy,
she recovered such comfort, that in the ravishments of spirit, she cried out, O
Lord Jesus, do thou pray for me? O blessed and sweet Savior, how wonderful!
how wonderful! how wonderful are thy mercies! O thy love is unspeakable, that
have dealt so graciously with me! O Lord my God, blessed be thy Name for
evermore, which have showed me the path of life: thou did, O Lord, hide thy
face from me for a little season, but with everlasting mercy thou have
compassion upon me: and now blessed Lord, thy comfortable presence is come,
yea, thou art come to thine handmaid with fullness of joys, and abundance of
consolation: O the joys! the joys! the joys that I feel in my soul! O they
be wonderful! they be wonderful! they be wonderful! O Lord, I feel thy mercy,
and I am assured of thy love; and so certain am I thereof, as thou art the God
of truth, even so sure do I know my self to be thine, and this my soul knows
right well, and this my soul knows right well: O blessed be the Lord, O
blessed be the Lord, that has thus comforted me! O the joy, the joy, the
delightsome joy that I feel! O praise the Lord for his mercies, and for this
joy which my soul feels full well: Praise his Name for evermore. See her life
and death in my second Part.

Mr. Peacock a biessed servant of God, being in horror And for these now
(says he) I feel an hell in my conscience; and afterward groaning most
pitiously, he cried out, O me pitious wretch! Oh mine heart is miserable! Oh,
oh, miserable, and woeful! the burden of my sin lies so heavy upon me, I
doubt it will break my heart: Oh how woeful and miserable is my state, that
thus must converse with hell hounds! Being asked whether he would pray? he
answered, I cannot: then they said, Let us pray for you: Take not (replied he)
the Name of God in vain by praying for a reprobate; but after a while this
tempest of temptation being over: Truly (said he) my heart and soul has been
far led, and deeply troubled with temptations, and many inconsiderate
speeches have flowed from me in the same, for which I humbly and heartily ask
mercy of God: I now find that the Sea is not more full of water, nor the Sun
of light, then the Lord of mercy, yea his mercies are ten thousand times more;
what great cause have I to magnify the goodness of God, that has humbled,
nay rather exalted such a wretched miscreant, and of so base a condition, to an
estate so glorious and stately? the Lord has honored me with his goodness: I
am sure he has provided a glorious Kingdom for me: The joy that I feel in my
heart is incredible. Bolton.

Mr. Robert Glover was so worn and consumed by Act. and Mon.

Mr. John Holland a faithful Minister of Gods Word, Romans for the space of two
hours; but on a sudden he said, O stay your reading, what brightness is this I
see? have you light up any candles? A stander by said, No, it is the Sunshine
(for it was about five a clock in a clear Summers evening:) Sunshine? says
he, Nay, it is my Saviours-shine: now farewell world: welcome heaven: the
day star from on high has visited my heart: O speak it when I am gone, and
preach it at my Funeral: God deals familiarly with man, I feel his mercy, I
see his Majesty, whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell, God he
knows: But I see things that are unutterable. And being thus ravished in his
spirit, he roamed toward heaven, with a cheerful look, and soft sweet voice;
but what he said was not understood: with the Sun in the morning following,
raising himself, as Jacob did upon his staff, he shut up his blessed life with
these blessed words: O what an happy change shall I make from night to day,
from darkness to light, from death to life, from sorrow to solace, from a
factious world, to an heavenly being? Oh my dear brethren, sisters and friends!
it pitieth me to leave you behind: yet remember my death when I am gone, and
what I now feel, I hope you shall feel ere you die, that God does, and will
deal familiarly with men; and now thou fiery Chariot, that came down to
fetch up Elijah, carry me to my happy hold: and all you blessed Angels that
attended the soul of Lazarus to bring it to Heaven, bear me, Oh bear me into
the bosom of my best beloved. Amen, Amen; Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly: And
so he fell asleep. Leigh.

Luther, who had the Devil, the Popes, the Emperor, yet the Lord miraculously
preserved him for the space of about thirty years, in despite of them all: and
at last he died in peace in his bed; at which time he made this heavenly
Prayer; My heavenly Father, Eternal, and Merciful God, thou have manifested
unto me thy dear Son, our Lord Jesus Christ: I have taught him, I have known
him, I love him as my Life, my health, and my Redemption; whom the wicked have
injured, persecuted, maligned, and afflicted: Draw my soul unto thee; for
though I must lay down this frail body, yet I certainly know that I shall live
with thee eternally, and that I cannot be taken out of thy hands. I commend my
spirit into thy hands, thou have redeemed it, O Lord God of truth; God so loved
the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that all that believe in him
should have life everlasting; which he repeated thrice; and so as one falling
asleep without any bodily pain that could be discerned, he departed this life,
1546. See his life in my first part.

Bergerius at Lions in France, being accused and apprehended by the space of
seven or eight months, who by reason of his pain and torment blasphemed God,
and cursed his parents that begat him, being almost eaten up with Lice, and fed
with such bread as Dogs and Horses refused to eat: but through the preaching
and prayers of Bergerius, he was brought to repentance: of which he wrote a
sweet letter to some of his friends, wherein he declared that the next day
after he had embraced the Gospel, his Lice which before did so abound, were all
gone, not one remaining: and that God so stirred up the hearts of good people
to pity, and provide for him, that he was fed with white bread, and wholesome
food. Act. and Mon.

Fanius, who was burnt for Religion in the City of Ferrara in Italy; all the

and go thy ways; whereto when he gave no great heed at first: the second time
it was so said: upon this as he fell to prayer, it was said to him the third
time likewise, which was about half an hour after: whereupon he rising up,
immediately part of the prison-wall fell down: And as the Officers came in at
the outward gate of the prison, he leaping over the ditch escaped: And in the
way meeting a beggar, changed his coat with him, and coming to the Seashoare,
he found a vessel ready to go over, into which he entered, and escaped. Act.

Since the beginning of these Civil wars, 40. honest Cornwall were condemned
to be hanged, by Sir Richard Greenvile for not assisting him against the
Parliament; and when they came to be executed, the sixth man brake a new halter,
wherewith he should have been hanged, and after that another, and after that
two others twisted together, which miracle of Gods mercy did so astonish the
adversaries, that they let him and all the rest depart in safety.

At that time when P. Rupert plunderd the town of Bolton in Lancashire; amongst
others that were cruelly slain by his party, there was one William Isherwood,
and his wife both slain; and Felice their daughter being then eleven weeks old,
lay pitifully crying at the breast of her dead mother: But and it pleased God
that an old woman, the wife of one Ralph Holme of the same town, aged above
seventy years, who had not given suck above twenty years before, seeing and
hearing the child, compassioned, and took it up, and having neither food for
her self, nor for the infant in that common calamity, to still the child laid
it to her breast: and behold the goodness of God, who provides for the young
ravens that cry! the child sucking, milk came into her breasts, wherewith she
nourished it to the admiration, and astonishment of all beholders. This is
attested by three godly Ministers, and diverse others of good credit who were
eyewitnesses of the same.

Thomas Whittel a blessed Martyr in Queen Mary's days, was by the wicked
suggestions of some Popish incarnate Devils, drawn to subscribe to their
hellish Doctrine: But considering in cold blood, what he had done, was horribly
vexed, and felt a hell in his conscience and Satan ready to devour him: which
terrible desertion and trouble of mind, made him quickly return with more
constancy and fortitude, and afterward by Gods great mercy, he proved a most
invincible and immovable Martyr. Act. and Mon.

bring the bond, and throw it in at the window, bidding the young man to take it
again unto him. Act. and Mon.

About the year 1556. in the town of Weissenstein Germany, a Jew, for theft
that he had committed, was condemned in this cruel manner to be executed. He
was hanged by the feet with his head downwards betwixt two dogs, which
constantly snatched, and bit at him: The strangeness of the torment moved
Jacobus Andreas (a grave, and learned Divine) to go to behold it: Coming
thither, he found the poor wretch as he hung, repeating verses out of the
Hebrew Psalms, wherein he cried out to God for mercy: Andreas hereupon took
occasion to counsel him to trust in Jesus Christ the true Savior of mankind:
The Jew embracing the the Christian faith, requested but this one thing, that
he might be taken down, and be Baptized, though presently after he were hanged
again (but by the neck, as Christian malefactors suffered) which was
accordingly granted to him: Mel. Adam. in vit. Ja. Andr. p. 639.

One who had accused the Apostle Saint James the John, when he saw that he was
condemned, and led to execution, was so pricked in conscience, that of his own
accord he confessed himself to be a Christian, and so they were both led forth
together to be executed: As they were in the way, he desired Saint James to
forgive him that which he had done, who after that he had paused a little upon
the matter, turned to him, and said; Peace be unto thee, brother, and kissed
him, and so both were beheaded together. Eusebius.

The Cardinal of Loraine, a principal pillar of the Guise, and a crafty, and
cruel persecutor of Gods people, coming from Rome with a purpose to stir up
the Kings of France, and Polonia, utterly to root out the Christian assemblies,
the Lord wrought so wonderfully for his peoples safety, that by the way he fell
mad at Avignion, and died in the flower of his youth; at the instant of whose
death there happened such an horrible tempest in the air, that all stood
amazed at it. Act. and Mon.

CHAP. II. Examples sit for Gods Ministers to imitate.
GOds faithful Ministers, as they are set up by God in a special manner to
oppose and beat down the kingdom of sin, and Satan: so usually they are
singled out by the Devil and his instruments, as the principal Buts against
which the invenomed Arrows of their malicious hearts are most directed: and
therefore not only Serpentine wisdom, and Dove-like innocence is necessary
for them above others: but also courage and magnanimity, not to fear the
faces of men: Sanctity and holiness, without which all their natural, and
acquired parts are but as a Pearl in the head of a filthy Toade, a Pearl in
the head, and the body all poison: And lastly, diligence and indefatigablenesse
in that work which God imployes them about, who puts no difference between
nequam and nequaquam, an idle, and an evil servant: Which things that they may
be better stirred up to endeavor after, let them diligently observe these
following examples.

Mr. Calvin being much weakened by his incessant Would you have the Lord when

Bishop Jewel, riding to preach at Lacock in Wiltshire, a Gentleman that met
him, perceiving his feebleness, advised him for his healths sake to turn home
again: to whom he answered, Oportet Episcopum concionantem mori: A Bishop
should die preaching; and so indeed he did; for presently after the Sermon, by
reason of his sickness, he was forced to bed, from which he never came off
till he was translated to glory. See his Life in my first parr.

Doctor Reynolds, when the Doctors of Oxsor came to visit him in his last
sickness, which he had contracted merely by his exceeding pains in his study

Mr. William Perkins borne at Marston nigh Coventry in Warwickshire was a

plain, but the piously learned did admire them; nor so learned, but the plain
did understand them: He would pronounce the word Damn with such an emphasis as
left a doleful echo in his auditors ear esa good while after: He had a rare
felicity in speedy reading of books, and as it were, but turning them over
would give an exact account of all considerables therein: besides his frequent
preaching, he wrote many books: and though lame of his right hand, yet this
Ehud with a left handed pen did stab the Romish cause, and as one says,

refused to hear him: and being brought by Sir Thomas Wharton, her Steward,
into the dining room, was desired to drink, which when he had done, he paused
a while, looking very sad: and being asked the reason, he said; Surely I have
done amiss in drinking in that place where the Word of God being offered, was
rejected, whereas, I should have departed presently and shaken off the dust
from my shoes for a testimony against this house.

Bugenhagius a Dutch Divine was so joyful, when Luther, and some other learned

CHAP. III. Ezamples of Christian courage, and resolution.
THe Naturalists write of the Eagle, that she tries who if they can outface
the Sun of persecution, they are sincere indeed: not but that he knows them
sufficiently without such a trial, but hereby he makes them known both to
themselves and others: for Grace is hid in nature here, as sweet water in
Rose-leaves; the fire of affliction must be put under to distill it out: and as
trees fix their roots the faster, the more they are shaken, so comforts abound
as sufferings abound; yet lest any should think that he can stand by his own
strength, the Apostle Paul tells him that all our sufficiency is of God, 2 Cor.
3. 5. who uses to proportion the burden to the back, and the stroke to the
strength of him that bears it, and if at any time the furnace be made hotter
then ordinary, yet then will he make his power to appear in our weakness; so
steeling our hearts, and raising our resolutions, that no danger, though never
so great, shall be able to appale it: as will appear evidently in these
examples following.

Constantius, the father of Constantine the great, to Eusebius.

Luther being cited by an Herald of Arms to appear Worms; many of his
friends persuaded him not to adventure himself to such a present danger: to
whom he answered, that he was resolved, and certainly determined to enter into

so many Devil to resist him, as there were tiles to cover the houses in
Worms. Sl^id. Com.

The Duchess Dowager of Ferrar, who was a great France had one Malicorne a

Saint Chrysostom also shows the like heroical the Lords, and the fullness

will let her cast me into the Sea; I will, remember Jonah: if she will, let her
cast me into a burning fiery Furnace, or amongst wild beasts; the three
children, and Daniel were so dealt with: if she will let her stone me, or cut
off mine head, I have then Saint Stephen and the Baptist my blessed companions:
if she will, let her take away all my substance: Naked came I out of my mothers

Polycarpus being accused for that he was a Christian, Caesar, and to defy

King Edward the sixth being solicited by some of Mary his sister to have the
Mass in her house, answered, That he would rather spend his life, and all that

selves, said he, most surely, that we of no earthly thing under heaven make
such account as of this one, to have our Laws obeyed, and this cause of God
which we have taken in hand, to be thoroughly maintained, from the which we will
never remove one hairs breadth, or give place to any creature living, much
less to any subject, wherein we will spend our own Royal person, our Crown,
Treasure, Realm, and all our Estate; whereof we assure you upon our high
honor. Act. and Mon.

Saint Basil relates a story of 40. Martyrs who being cast out naked all night
in the winter, and were to be burned the next day, they comforted themselves on
this wise, Sharp is the winter, but sweet is Paradise: painful is the frost,
but joyful the fruition that follows it; wait but a while and the
Patriarchs bosom shall cherish us: After one night we shall lay hold upon
eternal life: Let our feet feel the fire for a season, that we may for ever
walk arm in arm with the Angels: Let our hands fall off, that they may for
ever be lifted up to praise the Almighty, etc.

A godly Christian being tormented by Infidels with Even this that you see,

It is said of Luther, unus homo solus totius orbis impetum sustinuit: that he
alone opposed all the world.

When Eudoxia the Emperesse sent a threatening message to Saint Chrysostom? Go
tell her (says he) from me, Nil nisi peccatum timeo: that I fear nothing but
sin.

Theodosius the great, having in Egypt abolished Nilus (which they honored as
a God) keep in his streams, and not water their Land as formerly, began to
mutiny: whereupon the President wrote to the Emperor, beseeching him for once
to gratify the people by conniving at their superstition: to whom he
heroically answered: that it was better to continue faithful, and constant to
God, then to prefer the overflowing of Nilus, and the fertility of the earth
before piety and godliness: and that he had rather Nilus should never
overflow, then that they should raise it by sacrifices and enchantments. Soz.

Saint Basil being sent to by the Emperor to subscribe Opto me in aeternum sic

Melancthon being much disquieted in spirit by reason Luther thus encourages
him: Seeing the business is not man's, but Almighty Gods, laying aside all
care, you should cast the whole weight of it upon him: why do you vex your
self? If God has bestowed his Son upon us, why are we afraid? what tremble
we at? why are we distracted and sadded? Is Satan stronger then he? why fear we
the world which Christ has conquered? If we defend an evil cause, why do we
not change our purpose? If the cause be holy and just, why do we not trust Gods
promises? Certainly there is nothing besides our lives that Satan can snatch
from us, and though we die, yet Christ lives, and reigns for ever to defend
his own cause, etc. Sleid Com. l. 7.

Chrysostom speaking to the people of Antioch, like In this should a gracious
man differ from a graceless man, that he should bear his crosses courageously,
and as it were, with the wings of faith outsoare the height of all humane
miseries: He should be like a Rock, being incorporated into Jesus Christ,
inexpugnable, and unshaken with the most furious incursions of the waves, and
storms of worldly troubles, pressures, and persecutions. Ad pop. Antioch.

He that writes the life of Anselme, says thus of that he feared nothing in
the world more then sin, and that if on the one hand he should see corporally
the horror of sin, and on the other the pains of hell, and must necessarily
be plunged into the one, he would choose hell, rather then sin; and that he
would rather have hell, being innocent, and free from sin, then polluted with
the filth thereof, possess the kingdom of heaven.

Mr. Woodman, Martyr, speaks thus of himself: When I have been in prison
wearing bolts and shackles, sometimes lying upon the bare ground, sometimes
sitting in the stocks, sometimes bound with cords that all my body has been
swollen, like to be overcome with pain: sometimes feign to lie without in the
woods, and fields, wandering to and fro: sometimes brought before the Justices,
Sheriffs, Lords, Doctors and Bishops; sometimes called Dog, Devil, Heretic,
Whoremonger, Traitor, Thief, Deceiver, etc. yea, and they that did eat of my
bread, and should have been most my friends by nature have betrayed me; yet for
all this I praise my Lord God, that has separated me from my mothers womb:
all this that has happened to me, has been easy, light, and most delectable,
and joyful of any treasure that ever I possessed. Act. and Mon.

Julian the Apostate (that subtle enemy of the Church and implicit Idolatry)
refused to do, rather choosing to lose their wages: whilst others not knowing
the depth of this mystery of iniquity, and suspecting no hurt, did it, and so
defiled their consciences; which afterward filled them with such extreme
grief, and horror, that they offered to expiate their sin with their blood.
Theod.

I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and
after that have no more that they can do: But I will forewarne you, whom you
shall fear: Fear him which after he has killed, has power to cast into hell:
yea I say unto you, Fear him, Luke 12. 4, 5.
CHAP IV. Examples of Gods judgments upon Persecutors.
THere has ever been from the beginnin^ ^n inveterate antipathy between Satan
and his instruments, and the children of God: whence it is that wicked men
being more for number, and stronger in power then Christ's flock; have watched
all opportunities to be pushing and goaring of them, yea solacing, and pleasing
themselves in the others sufferings: So that if Christ, the great Shepherd of
his sheep, should not cut short, or break off the horns of the wicked, there
would be no living by them: yet the Lord may, and many times does lengthen the
chain, and enlarge the power of such to do much mischief, though not to the
ruin, and subversion of the Church, yet to the cutting off many of the
members, but still with this promise, that when he has accomplished all his
work upon mount Sion, and Jerusalem, he will then visit the proud heart of
those his enemies, (and like a loving and tender Father) when he has
sufficiently corrected his children, he will burn the rod in the fire: so that
all shall say, Verily, there is a God that judges in the earth. The truth
where of will manifestly appear in these examples following.

Manasses King of Judah being reproved by that Esaias: he caused him near to the
fountain of Silce to be sawen in sunder with a wooden saw in the eightieth
year of his age, for which cruel fact, amongst other of his sins, see his
punishments, 2 Chronicles. 33. 11. etc.

Antiochus Epiphanes a grievous blasphemer of God, Jerusalem a common burying
place, and the streets thereof to run with their blood, being smitten by God
as he went thitherward, began to relent, seeming very penitent, and vowed that
if he recovered, he would do many, and great things for the people of God, and
that he would become a Jew, and go through all the known world to declare the
power of God: but the Lord knowing his hypocrisy, still continued his disease,
which was a remediless pain of the bowels, intolerable torments of the inward
parts, his body breeding abundance of Worms which issued out of the same, so
that he rotted above ground, and by reason of the intolerablestinke thereof, no
man could endure to come near him, yea himself could not abide the same, and
so he ended his wretched life in much misery. Josephus.

Herod the great who caused the babes of Bethlehem and yet nothing sufficed
him: a grievous flux in the fundament, a droptick humor issuing from his feet,
a rotting of his inward bowels, an issue from his bladder, his privy members
rotted ingendring abundance of worms which issued from the same, a short, and
stinking breath, and great pain in breathing: and in all his members so

CHAP. V. Examples of the wicked lives, and woeful deaths of many of the Popes,
and Popelings.
THat Rome is Babylon, and the Pope Antichrist, are things now so evident and
notorious, that few question it: but that so many thousands which live under
the Romish jurisdiction should abide in so gross ignorance, as to continue
courting that old, and withered strumpet, may justly seem a marvel, were it
not that the common people are kept in such miserable ignorance, being deprived
of the soul-enlightning Word of God, and enjoined to pin their faith on the
Priests sleeve: And the more knowing sort of them are by Gods just judgment
given over to strong delusions to believe a lie, as the Apostle Paul long since
foretold, 2 These. 2. 11. which prophecy as it is in many other things
fulfilled, so especially in these prodigious blasphemies which are not only
published, but believed, and entertained with great applause among them: Many
instances might be given, but take one only in stead of all, wherein they
affirm that Christ imprinted his five wounds upon Francis of Assise the Freir,
as if he also were to suffer for the world, and redeem mankind: whereupon
Tursellin the Jesuit made these Verses: Exue Franciscum tunica, laceroque
cucullo,
Qui Franciscus erat, jam modo Christus erit.
Francisci exuviis, siqualicet, indue Christum,
Jam Franciscus erit, qui modo Christus erat.
Strip Francis from his coat, and cowle, all nak't, and you shall see
He that even now St. Francis was, to Christ will turned be.
Again put Francis coat, and cowle on Christ, and (mark the lier)
He that even now Christ Jesus was, will Francis be the Friar.


But that you may the better see what manner of persons the Popes themselves
have been, what their lives, and what their deaths, read these Examples
following.

playing the whore, fell in travel in the time of a solemn procession, and died

processions. Simps.

the woman's husband. Simps.

Pope Silvester the second was a great Conjurer, and Till he should say Mass
in Jerusalem: In the Lent after as he was saying Mass in the Chapel of Saint
Cross, he suddenly fell sick and remembering that that Chapel was called
Jerusalem, he perceived how he was cousened by the devil: He commanded his
Cardinals that after his death they should cut his body in pieces, and so bury
him, having before bequeathed his soul to the devil: It is commonly reported,
that by the rattling of his bones in his tomb is portended the death of the
Pope. Simps.

the devil strangled him to death. Simps.

most miserably in Germany. Balleus.

Christian world into a combustion. As he rose out of his seat to excommunicate

rent, and shivered in pieces: Afterward he hired one to knock the Emperor on
the head as he was at prayers: Enquiring of the Host for an answer against the
Emperor, because it would not speak, he threw it into the fire, and burnt it:
and after many such outrageous villainies, he was deposed and banished: after
which he wandered as a vagabond, without comfort, without help, without hope, in
a pitiful estate, yet pitied of no man, traveling under the unsupportable
burden of a restless conscience, and at last died for grief, Simps.

Pope Clement the sixth raised many horrible Wars against the Emperor Lewis of
Bavaria: and was the death of twenty thousand Frenchmen by the King of England:
At last he poisoned the Emperor: But shortly after himself was, by Gods just
judgment, stifled to death.

Frederick Barbarussa for holding his stirrup on the left side; as he was

the Adder, and the Basiliske, and shall tread down the Lion, and Dragon: The
Emperor said, Not to thee, but to Peter: To whom the Pope answered: Both to me
and to Peter. Simps.

Pope Boniface the eighth was a most proud, and Philip King of France, and his
posterity to the fourth generation, for making a Decree that no money should be
carried out of his Country to Rome: but the King sent the steward of his
house, and a Noble man of Rome, whom the Pope had driven out of his
inheritance, to publish his appeal to the next general Council, who seizing
upon the Pope, spoiled his treasures, and set him upon a wanton Colt with his
face toward the tail, and so made him a ridiculous spectacle to all the
people: whereupon he fell into so cruel a frenzy that he eat his own hands,
and died miserably: of whom it was said, that he entered like a Fox, reigned
like a Lion, and died like a dog. Simps.

Pope Urbane the sixth was a most cruel, and bloody Simps.

Pope Sixtus the fourth, most unjustly vexed all Italy with wars, and
dissentions. One of his own writers says, that amongst all the Bawds of these
latter days that built brothell-houses, this Pope surmounted them all: who at
Rome erected Stews of double abomination, one of women, the other of, etc. and
allowed the whole family of the Cardinal of St. Lucy in the three hot months
of Summer free leave to use Sodomitry: He caused every whore to pay him a
certain rate, which yearly amounted to the sum of forty thousand Ducats. of
whom these Epitaphs were made: Sixte, jaces tandem, nostri discordia sceli,
S^visti in superos, nunc Acheronta move.
Sixte, jaces tandem, deflent tua busta cinaedi,
Scort^que, lenones, ^lea, vina, Venus.

blew as though he had been beaten with bats, Simps.

Pope John the 22. told his friends that he knew by Simps.

Pope Paul the second being an ignorant, and illiterate Plat.

then barbarous cruelty, and a burning desire of advancing his bastards, whereof
he had many: He set benefices, and promotions to sale: He poisoned John
Michael, Cardinal of Venice, at Rome for his gold and treasures. In adulteries
he was most filthy, and abominable: In Tyranny most merciless: In Magic most
cunning, and therefore execrable: He poisoned his own father: He committed
incest with his own sister Lucretia: He poisoned Zemes, brother to Bajazet the
great Turk, being hired thereto by two hundred Ducats, after he had sworn
friendship to him: He procured aid of the Turk against the King of France: He
caused the tongue, and hands of Anthony Mancivel, (a learned and prudent man)
to be cut off, for making an Oration in reproof of his wickedness: He never
attempted any thing, but he first consulted with the devil: He was accustomed
to poison any whom he disliked; but at last through the mistake of his Butler,
had the poisoned wine (which he had prepared for some of his Cardinals) put
into his own hand, which he drinking off, with horrible cries and groans, died
immediately. Simps. Guich: Bembus.

purpose to poison the King, saying, It Is better that one man should die, then
that all the people should perish: The Abbat wept for joy, and absolved the
Monk from all his sins: Then did this varlot mix the poison of a filthy
toade with a cup of excellent wine, and brought it to the King, saying, My
Liege, here is such a cup of wine as you never drank a better in all your life:
I trust this wassail shall make all England glad: and therewithal began a good
draught to him, and the King pledging him, shortly after died.

Anno Christi 1605. when the powder plot was in Catesby, one of the Plotters,
repaired to Garnet a Popish Priest with this case of conscience, Whether it was
lawful in some cases to destroy the innocent with the wicked? This good father

resolved, that without all doubt it was, when the good coming by it might make
compensation for the loss of their lives.

Pope John the twenty third calling a Council at Rome against the godly
Christians in Bohemia: when the Council was set, the Mass of the holy Ghost
sung, and the Pope placed in his chair, there came flying in amongst them an
ugly Owl with an ill-fauoured hooting, and set her self upon a cross beam
just over against the Pope, casting her staring eyes upon him: whereupon the
whole company began to marvel, and whispering each to other, said, Behold, the
Spirit is come in the likeness of an Owl: The Pope himself blushed at the
matter, and began to sweat, fret, and fume, and so being in great distraction
dissolved the Council for the present; yet afterward calling another Sessions,
when they were met, in came the Owl as before, still looking steadfastly upon
the Pope; whereupon he was more ashamed, saying, that he could no longer abide
the sight of her, and commanded her to be driven away with bats, and shoutings,
but by no means could she be removed, till with the blows of the sticks thrown
at her, at length she fell down dead amongst them.

CHAP. VI. Examples of most inhumane cruelties.
THe corrupt nature of man since the fall of Adam contains in it the seed,
and spawn of all manner of impieties, so that if the Lord do but let loose the
reins of his restraining spirit, and leave man to himself, there is not the
most abhorred villainy that was ever perpetrated by any damned reprobate, but
he is prone to fall into the same, yea to rush on into sin as the horse into
the battle: whence it is that Solomon long since told us, that The tender
mercies of the wicked are cruelty: as will most manifestly appear by these
ensuing Examples.

Bellisarius, a worthy, and famous Captain under Justinian: having by Gods
assistance with great success fought many battles against the Persians, Goths,
and Vandals, in his old age, by the malice, and cruelty of the Emperesse (who
was a favourer of Eutyches the Heretic) had his eyes put out, and fell into
such want that he was forced to beg by the highways: Date obolum
Bellisario* For Gods sake, give an half penny to Bellisarius. See Justinians

Abundance of French inhabiting in the Island of Sicily, being hated by the

thrust him through with their halberds contrary to the mind both of the Duke,

compelling their husbands to stand by, and behold the same. This Duke on a time

that, besides those which were slain in war, and secret Massacres, he had put
into the hand of the hangman eighteen thousand in the space of six years.

by) could persuade them more effectually, unto whom he would lead them: When
they approached, the Image would rise up, open her arms, and embrace them:
which arms, and her breasts also were full of sharp ^ron nails, wherewith
she griped the poor wretch till she had killed him, and then the Tyrant seized
on his goods.

In the reign of Saint Edward, King of England, Harrould, and Tosto fell out in
the Kings Court at Windsor, from words, falling to blows, and Tosto having the
worst, secretly hied him to the Marches of Wales to his brother Harroulds
house, which was then in preparing to entertain the King, where he slew all
his brothers servants, and cutting them piece meal into gobbets, salted some
of their limbs, and cast the rest into vessels of Mead, and wine, sending his
brother word that he had furnished him with poudered meats against the Kings
coming thither: but this barbarous act caused his name to be so odious amongst
his Northumbrians (where he was Earl) that at last it was repayed with his own
death. Speeds Chron. page 402.

and so leading them forth one after another, he dispatched them all: All the
elder went to the slaughter more cheerfully, the younger more timerously: I
tremble and quake (says a Roman Catholic, out of whose letter to his Lord
this is transcribed) even to remember how the executioner held his bloody knife
between his teeth, with the bloody mufler in his hand, and his arms all goare
blood up to the elbowes going to the fold, and taking every one of them one
after another by the hand, and so dispatching them all, no otherwise then a
Butcher does his Calves, or Sheep.

In the Spanish Inquisition, if any Protestant be secretly Hoffeus the Jesuit

the whole truth, withal professing himself to be a Christian, whereupon he was
condemned, and led to execution, which Theodora hearing of (thinking to excuse

It Is recorded of Julius Caesar that in his wars he Plin.

Gains Caligula the fourth Emperor of Rome was Tiberius, who was made coheire
with him, to be murdered. He caused Syllanus his wives father to murder
himself: He caused diverse of the Senators to be privily murdered, and then
gave it out that they had murdered themselves: many other noble men he
stigmatized and then condemned them to the mettal-mines, or to mending the
highways, or to the wild beasts: Some he sawed a sunder in the midst. He
forced parents to be present at the torments of their children: and whereas one
excused himself by reason of sickness, he sent his horse-litter for him:
Another asking whether he might not wink? for that he caused him to be slain.
Another whom he forced to be present at the torments of his children, he
presently took him home with him to a feast, and forced him to be merry. When
he wanted condemned persons to feed his beasts, he would cause some of the
innocent spectators to have their tongues cut out, that they might not
complain, and so to be thrown to the beasts. When he distasted any of the
Senators, he would suborne some to come into the Courts, and to declare them
public enemies to the State, and presently to murder them, yet was he not
satisfied till he saw them torn peecemeale, and their bowels dragged along the
streets. He used to say that he commended nothing more in his nature then his
impudence. He would not have men presently to be killed, but used to say to his
executioners, Ita percute, ut mori se sentiat: So strike, that he may feel
himself to die. Being angry with the people for coming slowly to his sports, he
wished, Vtinam Populus Romanus unam cervicem haberet! Would all the people of
Rome had but one neck! He used to complain of his times that they were not
made famous by some great public calamity: and therefore he used to wish for
the destruction of his Armies, famines, pestilence, burning, or some
extraordinary gapings of the earth; and grieved for that he should be soon
forgotten, because of the prosperity of all things. Having entertained the two
Consuls at a great feast, suddenly he fell into a great laughter, and when they
asked him mildly what he laughed at, he answered: To think that with one nod, I
can presently cause you both to be murdered. When he used to kiss the necks of
his wives, and concubines, he said: This fair neck as soon as I command, shall
be cut off. Sueto.

Vitellius the Roman Emperor was exceeding cruel, One of his friends coming
to visit him, and finding himself not well called for some water to drink, the
Emperor with his own hands cast poison into it, and poisoned him. He commanded
some young men to be slain, only because they came to int^eate him to pardon
their father whom he had condemned to die. Imperial Hist.

CHAP. VII. Examples of Temperance, Abstinence, and Sobriety.
ABstinence orders a man in the use of meats, that it be neither unseasonable
for the time, nor unreasonable for the measure: nature is content with a
little: grace with less. Men should rather be like Ants, and Bees (those
wisest of creatures) and abound rather in pectore, ubi est animus, quam in
ventre, ubi est stercus, in breast then in belly: Not, like the Locusts, which
have but one gut; and the Spider which is little else then belly: Let us not
therefore pamper the body, nor cater for the flesh: Preserve it we must: make
provision for it we may not, Romans 8. 11. and 13. last. Debtors we are to see to
it, not to live to ^^: we may not live to eat, but eat to live: whereunto these
following examples may invite us.

CHAP. VIII. Examples of drunkenness.
THe sin of Drunkenness is a bewitching sin, Hos. 4. 11. It steals away
the heart from God, and all goodness: It is an old sin, it began presently
after the Flood: It is a malignant sin: it drownes the brain, wastes the
time, consumes the estate, and fills the body with as many diseases as has an
horse; It is an Epidemical sin that has almost drowned the whole world with
another deluge: In these modern times it began in Germany, whence grew that
proverb, Germani possunt cunctos tolerare labores:
O utinam possint tam been far sitim!
The Germans can all labors undergo,
Would they as well could bear their thirst also!


But since it has infected all Europe: It is grown into fashion to quaffe
soul-sick healths till they make themselves like Swine, and worse then beasts:

CHAP. IX. Examples of Prodigality, Gluttony, and Excess.
THey have their souls (says one) merely for salt to keep their bodies from
putrefying, whose whole life is to eat, and drink, and sport, and sleep, as if
they came into the world as Rats, and Mice, only to devour victuals, and run
squeeking up and down; whereas nature in framing of man teaches him
temperance, by giving him a little mouth, with a narrow throat, and a lesser
belly then other creatures have; Yet such is the prodigious unnaturalness
amongst most, that (as the French Proverb has it) They dig their Graves with
their teeth, whilst their Kitchen is their shrine, their Cook their Priest,
their Table their Altar, and their belly their god. Hence also it is said, That
Meat kills as many as the Musket. Plures pereunt crapula quam capulo; lancibus,
quam lanceis; The board kills more then the sword. And as it is thus noxious to
the body, so also to the estate; whilst the spend thrift entombes his
Ancestors in his own bowels, turning his Rents into Ruffes, and his Lands into
Laces. And lastly, to his soul also; for Gluttony is the gallery of
Incontinency: Nutritiva facultas est ossi^ina generativae. The odiousness of
this sin will farther appear in these examples following.

Pearls and Diamonds; his seats strewed with Musk and Amber; his bed covered
with Gold and Silver, and beset with Pearls, and his way strawed with powder

countrey-manners, and the discipline of the former Macedonian Kings, too light
and mean for him. He imitated the pride of the Persian Kings: He made him a
Crown, and robes like unto Darius: He grew so proud, and insolent that he
suffered his Macedonians to fall down and worship him like a god: Yea he
commanded his servants, and slaves to do so. He clothed his Captains and
horsemen after the Persian manner, which though they disliked, yet they durst
not refuse. He gat him three hundred sixty five concubines, of the
beautifullest Virgins that could be found in Asia, after the manner of the
Persian Kings: of these he had one that lay with him every night: He had his
troop of Eunuchs. He spent days, and nights in profuse feasting, and
revelling. He gat many Musicians, Jesters, Singing women, etc. All which was
very offensive to his old Captains, and Soldiers. Q. Cur.

Cleopatra being very young, was with her brother Ptolomaeus King of Egypt
besieged in Alexandria by Julius Caesar: After a while she caused one
Apollidorus to bind her up in clothes like a bed, and so carried her into
Caesar's tent, where being laid down at Caesar's feet, the man opens his fardel,
and a Venus comes forth, whose beauty Caesar being taken with, used her body at
his pleasure, not long before she had been defiled by Pompey: But these were
her childish whoredoms: Afterward Mark Anthony being in Asia raising
tributes, and ready to underake the Parthian War, sends for Cleopatra to
plead her cause before him for assisting Cassius, his enemy, with money: She
attires her self after the curiousest, and costliest manner that could be, and
upon the River Cydnus enters into her Galley all guilt with gold, the oars
covered with silver, that kept their strokes by the sound of Musicians: the
sails were of purple silk: her self lay under a heaven of gold beset with all
sorts of precious stones: many Ganimeds stood about her to fan wind to cool
her; her Ladies like Nymphs sat up, and down the ship, burning incense, and
sweet persumes: Being come to the place where Anthony was, he, to keep the
Roman gravity, sat in the Tribunal with the Officers and people about him, and
sends for her thither: but she goes straight to her Inn, and all the people
left Anthony to gaze upon her: So that being left alone, he returns to his
quarters, and sends to invite her to supper: She refuses, and excuses herself:
Anthony could no longer forbear, but goes to her, sups with her, eats and
drinks in love: her beauty, wit, and smooth tongue soon bewitched him: She
could readily speak Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, AEthiopick, and Persian language in
their own Idiome: Anthony being thus taken, forgets his Wars his wives, and
all relations: goes with her into Egypt, and spends his time in adulteries:
till vengeance seized on them both, which was executed by Octa. Caesar. Lipsius.

neither was she faithful to him, but prostituted her body to Landric, Master of
the Kings horse. On a time the King being to go a hunting, went to bid his wife
farewell, who was combing her hair: The King went softly behind her, and with
his wand in sport struck her behind: She thinking it had been her Landric,
said: What do thou do, my Landric? It Is the part of a good Knight to charge
a Lady before, and not behind: The King by this means finding her falsehood,
went his ways on hunting, and she finding her self discovered, sent for
Landric: told him what was happened, and therefore persuaded him to kill the
King for his, and her safety: which he undertook, and effected that night as

Valentinian the third, Emperor of Rome, by dishonouring Petronius Maximus, a
Senator of Rome, lost his life, and was thereby the author of the final
destruction of the Roman Empire. For Petronius being informed of the wrong
which the Emperor had done him by defiling his wife, was purposed to revenge
it with his own hands: but knowing that he could not do it whilst Actius the
General of his Army lived, (a man famous for his valiant exploits against the
Burgundians and Goths) he accused him falsely to the Emperor of treason, and
thereby procured his death: then did he stir up some of Actius friends to
revenge his death upon the Emperor: which they also performed upon him as he
was sitting in judgment: then did Maximus not only seize upon the Empire, but
upon Eudoxia the Emperesse, forcing her to be his wife; which indignity she not
enduring, sent privately into Africa to Genserick King of the Vandals, to come
and deliver her and the City of Rome from the Tyranny of Maximus, which
occasion he laying hold of, came into Italy, with a huge Army, whereupon the
Citizens of Rome were so affrighted, that they fled into the Mountains, and
Maximus flying with them, was murdered by the way, and hewn in pieces by some
of the Senators: And Genserick entering Rome, found it empty of inhabitants, but
not of infinite riches, all which he exposed as a prey to his Army, and carried
away into Africa, together with a great number of the people, and amongst them
was Eudoxia the Emperesse, and her two daughters, Eudocia and Placidia: After
which the Roman Empire could never recover it self, but grew weaker and weaker
till it came to utter ruin.

Attalus who was one of Philip King of Macedonia's Pausanias, a Noble young
man, and not content therewith, at a drunken feast he exposed him to be defiled
by his guests also. This indignity did so exasperate Pausanias, that he
complained to King Philip of the wrong; who entertained him with scoffs, and
scorns in stead of punishing the offender: Pausanias seeing this, was so
enraged against the King, that on a day when he made a great feast for the
Coronation of his son Alexander King of Epyrus, and for the marriage of his
daughter Cleopatra, Pausanius watching his opportunity, slew him, thereby
turning their melody into mourning, and their joy into sorrow. Diod. Sic.

CHAP. XI. Examples of Chastity, and Modesty.
THe way to heaven is up the hill all the way, and the unclean adulterer with
his rotten Lungs, and wasted Loins cannot climb up it. Virgins which are not
defiled with women, are they which follow the Lamb in white whithersoever he
goes. The frequency of the sin of uncleanness amongst Christians, brings
dishonor to God, scandal to their profession, and a wound to their own souls,
and many of the Heathen will rise up in judgment in the last day against such:
as these following Examples will more fully declare. Chastity.

Alexander M. being in the heat of youth showed Darius, which were women of
admirable beauty, yet he neither by word or deed proffered them the least
indignity, thinking it a greater honor to overcome himself, then his
adversaries: and when he looked upon other captive Ladies that excelled in
stature, and beauty, he merrily said. Persides oculorum dolores esse: That the
Persian women were a disease of the eyes: and yet he looked on them but on so
many statues: And understanding that two of his Captains under Parmenio had
ravished two of the Persian wives, he wrote to him to enquire after the matter,
and if he found it true, that he should cut of their heads, as of beasts borne
for the hurt of mankind: he also wrote him word that he himself was so far
from contemplating the beauty of Darius's wife, that he would not so much as
suffer her to be commended in his presence: and that he was so careful of their
chastity that they lived in his camp, shut up in their tent, as if they had
been in a Temple. Plut.

AS Husbandmen cast some of their Corn back into a fruitful soil, whereby in
due time they receive it back again with increase: So should we do with worldly
blessings, sow them in the bowels, and on the backs of poor members of Christ,
and in the day of harvest we shall find great increase: Such laying out, is a
laying up our treasure in heaven. Hereby we make to our selves friends of the
Mammon of unrighteousness; and though for the present it seem like bread cast

it again, Eccses. 11. 1. For we make God our debtour, who is a sure paymaster,

contrary, miserly muckwormes are like the muckhill, that never does good till
it be carried out: like the earthen box, that has one chink to receive, but
never a one to let out; and so does no good till it be broken. Or like the fat
hog, that yields no profit till he comes to the knife. But that we may be the

he was devoured. Act. and Mon.

When Xerxes came with his huge Army into Greece, Delphos, to setch away the
treasure from the Temple there, but by the way they were encountered with
thunder, lightning, and such tempests of wind and rain, that very many of
them were slain with it; two great pieces also of Parnassus being torn up by
the tempest, were tumbled down with a great noise upon the rest, which crushed
them to pieces, so that few of them which went about that Sacrilegious action,
escaped with there lives. Pez. Mel. Hist.

The Phocians in Greece having robbed the Temple Apollo at Delphos, the other
Grecians raised an Army to revenge that Sacrilege, and in a great battle the
Phocians were overthrown, many of them slain, and Philomilus their General
forced to cast himself down from a high rocks, whereby he brake his neck. Yet
afterward choosing one Onomarchus for their General, they renewed the wars
again, and in a great battle which they fought against Philip, King of
Macedonia, they were again beaten, and had six thousand slain, and three
thousand taken prisoners, all which, as Sacrilegious persons King Philip caused
to be thrust through with darts. Diod. Sic. This Sacred War, as they called
it, continued nineteen years, which at last was ended by King Philip, and the
judgment of the whole business was referred to the Court of the Amphyctions,
which was a general Court made up of all the Provinces in Greece: this Court
adjudged the walls of all the Phocians Cities to be thrown down: that they
should pay yearly out of the fruits of their fields sixty talents: that they
should never after have any thing to do, either in Apollo's Temple, or be
members of the Court of the Amphictyons, that they should neither use horses,
nor Armor, till they had paid back all the money that they had stolen from
Delphos: and that they should be branded with infamy as most wicked persons,
which had any hand in that sacrilegious theft. Justin. Diodorus. Sic. sets down
diverse other judgments which befell them for their sacrilege, all their
Generals one after another perished by untimely deaths, their soldiers were
sooner or later all of them devoured by the sword, yea the Princes wives that
had taken gold chains out of the Temple, had several judgments befell them.

Antiochus M. being overcome by the Romans, Asia minor, went to Babylon, and
there intending to rob the Temple of Bell, or Belus, which was full of riches,
he was slain in a tumult by the common people. Sirabo.

Qu. Caepio, a Roman Consul, besieging the City Toulouse in France, at length
took it by storm, and the soldiers finding the Temples very rich, took out
all the gold and silver out of them: but of all those that committed this
Sacrilege, there was not one that escaped, but came to a miserable end. Cor.
Tacitus.

The Phocians who were the keepers of Apollo's Delphos, being straightned for
want of money in a time of warer, despoiled the Temple of the riches which had
been bestowed upon it. All men hated, and cried out of this sacrilege* but
none went about to revenge it, save Philip King of Macedon, who at this time
was weak and scarce taken notice of in the world: when they came to the battle,
the Phocians were easily overthrown, and Philip carried away a glorious victory
whereby he laid the foundations of that greatness, which himself and his
son Alexander afterward attained. Lipsius. This is somewhat larger before.

William the Conqueror took away land both from New Forest in Hantshire: But
Gods just judgment not long after followed this Sacrilegious act of the King;
for Richard his second son, as he was hunting in this Forest, was blasted
with a pestilent air whereof he died: William Rufus, another of his sons, as
he was hunting in it, was by chance shot through, and slain with an arrow by
Walter Tirrel: Likewise Henry his grandchild by Robert his eldest son,
whilst he hotly pursued his game in this Chase, was hanged amongst the boughs,
and so died. Camb. Brit. p. 259.

See in my General Martirolygie, p. 7, 8. Gods judgment on Antiochus Epiphanes
for his Sacrilege amongst his other sins.

Myconius a godly divine, being sent over into England, Germane Princes in King
Henry the eights days, when he saw him seize upon, and sell the Abbey-lands,
abhorring such Sacrilege he returned home, and would have no hand in making
peace with so wicked a Prince.

Calvin, when he saw the Senate of Geneva employing Monasteries to civil uses,
told them in his Sermon, that he could not endure such Sacrilege, which he
knew God in the end would punish most severely: What then will become of our
late purchasers of the Church-revenues, which were given to a sacred, not to a
superstitious use, as the former? and what will become of those that yet think
the Church not bare enough, till they have stripped her of all her revenues?

Lodwick Count of Oeting, sending for Andreas an Andreas went to take leave of
his own Prince, Christopher of Wittenberg, he charged him, and gave it him in
writing that if Count Lodwick set upon the Reformation, that under pretense of
Religion he might rob the Church and by seizing upon the revenues of the
Monasteries, turn them to his own use, that he should presently leave him as a
Sacrilegious person, and come back again.

Thou that abhorrest Idols, committest thou Sacrilege? Romans 2. 22. Will a man
rob God? yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In
tithes, and in offerings. Ye are accursed with a curse, etc. Mal. 3. 8, 9.
CHAP. XVI. Examples of Pride, and Arrogance, Ambition, and vainglory
Many men when they grow great in the world, are so puffed up with pride, that
they scarce know themselves; which is, as if the silly Ant the higher that she
gets upon her hill, the bigger she should conceit her self to be: It is the
devils last stratagem, if he cannot beat us down to sin, he will labor to
blow us up with pride; and yet there is nothing that the Lord does more hate,
for he beholds the proud afar off, as if he were not fit to be touched with a
pair of tongs: Besides, men by pride do but hasten their own ruin, --

thunderbolt: He used to sit in the midst of the Images of the gods, and caused
the most costly fowls; and birds to be sacrificed to him: he had also certain
instruments made, whereby he imitated the thunder, and lightening: and when it
thundered indeed, he used to cast stones toward Heaven, saying, Either thou
shall kill me, or I will kill thee: He caused the heads of most of the Idols in
Rome to be broken off, and his own to be set in their rooms: Sometimes he
would sit with a golden beard, and a thunderbolt in his hand, like Jupiter:
other sometimes with a Trident, like Neptune: He invited the moon like a woman

Captives. Parmenio told Alexander, that if he were Alexander he would accept of
those terms: And I, said Alexander, if I were Parmenio, would rather have the
money then glory: But now, said he, I am secure from poverty, and must remember
that I am a King, and not a Merchant: and so he returned this proud answer:
Tell, faith he, Darius, that it is superfluous to return thanks to his enemy,
and wherein I have dealt mildly, and liberally with his family, it proceeds
from my good nature, and not to curry favor with him: I would do what he
desires if he would be my inferior, but not if he would be my equal: for as
the world cannot have two Suns, neither can it contain two Emperors; therefore
let him either yield up himself to me to day, or expect the fortune of War to
morrow. Q. Cur. Plut.

Other examples: The Grecians being ready to join Xerxes his navy, the
Lacedaemonians would needs appoint an Admiral for the Grecian navy, which of
right belonged to the Athenians, yet the Athenians preferring the safety of
Greece before their own right, willingly condescended to it. Intelligebant enim
interituram esse Graeciam, si de dominat^ intempestive contenderent, etc. Herod.

The Grecians being ready to join battle with the Persians, there arose a
contention between the Athenians, and Areadians about the precedence of place:
the Athenians said to them: Though we might justly challenge the precedence in
regard of our actions both ancient, and modern, yet considering the present
state of affairs, we will not now contend about it: but will humbly submit to
the judgment of the Lacedaemonians, let them place us where they please: only
this we are resolved of, that where ever they place us, we will endeavor to
honor the place by our valiant actions. Pez. Mel. Hist.

routed, himself with most of the Persian Nobility fled into the City of Thebes:
Whereupon one Lampus persuaded Pausanias the King of Lacedemon to ^lay
Mardonius with the other Persian Nobles, telling him that it would much redound
to his hounour: But Pausanias being no whit puffed up with the victory,
answered him humbly, that such cruelty was fi^ter for the Barbarians then the
Grecians, and therefore, ^aith he, I am only content with the honor of
speaking, and doing such things as may be pleasing to my Spartanes. Pez. Mel

In the Wars which the Grecians made with Darius, Athenians was conferred upon
Aristides, he in humility transferred it to Miltiades, saying to the other
Captains, It is not dishonorable, but honest, and safe to obey, and submit to
the command of wise men. Plut.

Before the battle of Marathon the Tagaeatae strove Athenians about the
chiefest place in the Army: whereupon Aristides said to them: Locus neque dat,
neque ad^mit virtutem, etc. The place does neither give, uor take away valor:
therefore whatever place ye assign unto us, we will endeavor to adorn, and
defend the same, that so we may do nothing unworth our former victories: for we
came hither not to contend with our friends, but to fight with our enemies; nor
to boast of the actions of our Progenitors, but to prove our selves valiant
men; for this present battle shall show how much Greece owes to every City,
Captain, and private soldiers. Pez. Mel. Hist.

Brasidas the Lacedemonian General having given Athenians a great overthrow,

death his mother hearing every one highly extolling his valor, said: My son
truly was a good, and a valiant man, yet he has left behind him many of his
fellow Citizens, that far excel him in virtue, and valor: The Ephori
hearing of this her speech, caused her to be publicly honored, and praised,
for that she preferred the public honor of her country, before the private
praise, and glory of her son. Pez. Mel. Hist.

After the death of Romulus, the Romans chose Numa Pompilius, a Sabine of the
City Cures for their King, and sent Ambassadors to him to acquaint him with
their choice, and to desire his present repair to their City: The Ambassadors
thought that few words would have prevailed with him to accept of it: But he
being a prudent, and humble man, answered them, that change, and alteration of
a man's life. was exceeding dangerous, but for him that lacked nothing, neither
had cause to complain of his present state, it was great folly to leave his
present known condition, and to enter into a new, and unknown, so that it was
long before they could prevail with him to accept of the Kingdom. Plut.

Certain fishermen of the Isle of Co, casting their have ensued betwixt them:
But the Oracle at Delphos being consulted with, commanded them to give the
stool to the wisest man that then was: upon this they sent it to Thales at
Miletum: But Thales sent the stool to Bias, judging him a wiser man then
himself: He again sent it to another as a wiser man then himself: and the third
to a fourth; so that being thus posted from man to man, at last it came back to
Thales again, who sent it to Thebes, and dedicated it to the Temple of Apollo.

would come and sup with him: the Citizen told his wife, and so went into the
market to make some provision: in the mean time the good wife hearing that she
should have so great a man come to her house, bustled about to get all things
ready: when presently came in Philopoemen, clothed in a mean habit, whom the
good wife looking upon and supposing him to be a servant sent before, she bade
him to help her to get supper: Philopoemen presently obeyed, put off his coat,
took an axe, and fell to cleaving of wood: presently came in the Citizen, and
seeing him about such a business, said, What mean you, O Philopoemen, by
this? Philopoemen answered, Quid aliud nisi deformitatis poenas luo? I am well
enough served, for coming in such mean apparel. Polybius.

Agesilaus King of Sparta was of such an humble disposition, Plut*

When the Thasian people, for some great favors Agesilaus King of Sparta, and
offered sacrifices to him as to a god: they sent Ambassadors to him to
certify him thereof: But he said unto them, Can your countrymen make gods of
men? to whom they answered, that they could. Well then, said Agesilaus, let
them first make themselves gods, and then I will believe that they can make me
one. Xenophon.

Alexander M in a drunken feast that he made after Persia, began to boast of
his great victories, and atchievments to the distaste of his own Captains,
insomuch as one of them called Clitus, speaking to another, said, He boasts of
those victories which were purchased with other men's blood: Alexander
suspecting that he spoke against him, asked what he said? and when all were
silent, Clitus spoke of the great victories which Philip his father had gotten
in Greece, preferring them before these: which so incensed Alexander, that he
bade him be gone out of his presence: and when Clitus hastened not, but
multiplied words, the King rose up in a great fury, and snatching a lance out
of his Squires hand, therewith he thrust Clitus through, and killed him: This
Clitus had formerly saved the Kings life in the battle against Darius: He was
an old soldier of King Philips, and had performed many excellent exploits.
Besides, his mother had nursed Alexander, and he was brought up with him as his
foster-brother: So that Alexander when the heat of his anger was over, was so
enraged against himself for this murder, that he was about with the same
lance to have murdered himself, if he had not been violently restrained by his
servants. Q. Cur.

CHAP. XIX. Examples of Patience, Moderation, and Meekness.
SOme of the Heathens have attained to a great eminency in this virtue of
Patience: but Christians are to add it to the number of their graces, 2 Pet.
1. 6. And indeed it is that that gives a great luster to all the rest: Humility
is the root whence it springs, and the fruit of it is both amiable, and
profitable: It puts, and keeps a man in possession of his soul, Luke 21. 19. It
makes all burdens light, and is much improved by exercise, Romans 5. 3. Moses
his meekness, and Jobs patience are exemplary, and so held forth in the
Scripture: And these which follow also may be useful to quicken us to an
earnest pursuit after this so excellent a virtue.

Other examples: A young man striking Lycurgus Lycurgus to punish him as he
pleased. Lycurgus took him home with him to his house, spoke never a soul word
to him, only commanded him to wait upon him: The young man, now sensible of
his fault willingly obeyed him, and observing his strict life, and his
constancy in enduring labor, he began first to reverence, and then to love him
with this heart, so that of a fierce, rash, and ill conditioned youth, he
became a grave, and wise man. Plut.

The two Navies of Xerxes, and the Grecians being Grecians would have made a

Eurybiades, because Themistoles persuaded their stay, Eurybiades held up his

Aristides having been banished Athens by the envy, Themistocles, three years
after when Xerxes came against Greece, he was called home by the Athenians
again: and forgetting all the former wrongs that he had received from
Themistocles, he cordially joined with him in promoting the public good, and
advancing Themistocles his honor thereby: using this moderate speech to him:
If we be wise, let us lay aside our former youthly, and vain contentions, and
let us now strive who shall do most for the public good of our country, thou
by thy valor, and I by my counsel, and undergoing the office of a servant to
thee. Plut.

The Pythagoreans, if at any time through anger

Theodosius the Emperor upon a fault committed Thessalonica, commanded severe
punishment to be inflicted upon them, which was so unadvisedly executed, that
as well the innocent, as the nocent were involved therein: The Emperor
afterward coming to Millan, would have entered into the Church to have
communicated with other Christians; but Ambrose the Bishop thereof (though
otherwise a man of admiral mildness) resisted and excommunicated him: in which
estate he continued for eight months, and then upon his submission was
absolved, and received again into the Congregation: And that he might prevent
the like offense afterward, he enacted a Law, that thirty days should pass
betwixt the sentence of death, and the Execution of it: And to suppress his
Choler (whereunto he was very subject) his usual manner was to repeat the Greek
Alphalet, before he uttered any speech savouring of that humor. See Ambrose

Julius Caesar being extremely defamed by Clavus Catullus the Poet: Yet

Augustus Caesar was also of the same disposition: Timagines an Historian,
wrote against him, together with his wife, daughters, and all his family: he
only sent to him, advising him to use his tongue, and pen with more

CHAP. XV. Examples of Gods judgments upon Apostates, and backsliders.
TRue grace is not like a slight stain, but a durable die, and graine-colour
which can never be washed out: the gates of hell cannot prevail against the
faith of Gods elect: so that though they may lose the luster of their graces,
yet not the graces themselves, but a see will still remain in them: The reason
then why some glorious professors do fall like stars from heaven, is, because
they were never fixed in the true Orb: They had a name only that they lived,
but were dead, Rev. 3. 1. they had an evil heart of unbelief in them, and
therefore they depart away from the living God, Heb. 3. 12. They began in
hypocrisy, and so end in Apostasy: But that the danger, and misery of such
persons may more manifestly appear unto us, lay to heart these texts, and
Examples following.

Foretold, 2 These. 2. 3. Exodus 32. 8. 1 Timothy 4. 1. Mat. 24. 12.

Other examples, Jeroboam the son of N^bat fell Dan, and Bethel, and when the
Prophet prophesied against his Idolatry, he stretched forth his hand against
him, which was immediately dried up: But not taking warning hereby, shortly
after the Lord struck his son Abijah with sickness, whereof he died, 1 Kings
14. Then was he assaulted by Abijam King of Judah, and though Jeroboams Army
was twice so big, yet was he overthrown, and lost five hundred thousand of his
men, besides some of his Cities, and not long after, himself was stricken by
God, that he died.

Jehoram King of Judah, though he had been religiously Iehosaphat, and had seen
his zeal in purging out Idolatry, and maintaining the pure service of God, yet
marrying Athalia, the daughter of Ahab, he turned an Idolater, and caused the
men of Judah to run a whoring after strange gods: whereupon the Arabians, and
Philistines rose up against him, wasted his country, robbed him of his
treasures, took away his wives, and murdered all his children save Jehoahaz
his youngest son: After which the Lord smote him with an incurable disease in
his bowels, so that after he had lived two years in grievous torments, his guts
fell out of his belly, and he died, 2 Chronicles. 21.

Joas King of Judah, who had been preserved, and religiously Jehojadah, after
his death this Joas Apostatized from the service of God, and fell to Idolatry:
For which God raised up the Syrians against him, who came with a small army
against a mighty host, yet did they prevail against Joas, slew his Princes,
and carried away a great spoil to Damascus, and shortly after the Lord struck
Joas with grievous diseases, and his own servants conspiring against him, slew
him, the people not affording him a burial amongst the Kings, 2 Chronicles. 24.

Amaziah King of Judah, began his reign well, pretending Edomites, he brought
home their gods, worshipped, and burned incense to them: And being reproved by
a Prophet, he threatened him with death, if he ceased not: For which the Lord
delivered him up into the hand of the King of Israel, who overthrew his Army,
took him prisoner, carried him back to Jerusalem, and for the greater reproach
before his face, brake down part of the Citywalls, ransacked the Temple, and
Kings palace, carried away all the treasure out of both, took his children for

carried away raving, and shut up in a close chamber, from which time to his
last breath, he continually cried out that he was damned, and rejected of God,

he followed up, and down whithersoever she went, and seeing his love and labor
despised, he pined away with grief, and being regardlesse of himself,
multitudes of lice bred, and fed upon him, yea, they issued out abundantly from
every part of his body: So that feeling Gods heavy vengeance upon him he began
to despair of mercy, and resolved to pine himself, which purpose the lice
seemed to further, for they clustered so many in his throat as almost choked
him and when some of his friends (pitying his condition) set open his mouth
with a gag to pour in broth, the lice went down with it, and choked him: so
that as he had gagged the godly Ministers at their death, himself died with a
gag in his mouth.

King Henry the fourth of France, who had all his France, when he had almost

body with a knife, but the King at the same instant, stooping to take up one of
his Lords, who was on his knees before him, the blow fell upon his right upper
jaw, cutting out one of his teeth, and somewhat wounding his tongue: It is
reported that in his progress a Protestant Minister in private conference said
unto him: You have denied God with your tongue, and have received a wound in
the same, take heed of denying him with your heart, lest you receive a wound in
that also: which indeed proved a prophecy; for riding abroad in his Coach to
refresh himself, one Ravilliac watched his opportunity, and stabbed him, first
into the left pap, and with a second blow struck him between the fifth and
sixth rib* cutting asunder the vein leading to the heart, the knife entering
into the vena cava, of which wound he died. French H^st.

soldiers, carrying away with him the King with all the Christians there

A Smith in King Edward the sixths days called Richard Denson was a forward

Queen Mary this young man was cast into prison for his religion, who remembering
his old friend the Smith to whom he always carried a reverend respect for the
good that he had received by him, sent to know whether he was not imprisoned
also, and finding that he was not, desired to speak with him, and when he came
asked his advice whether he thought it comfortable for him to remain in
prison, and whether he would encourage him to burn at a stake for his
religion? To whom the Smith answered that his cause was good, and he might with
comfort suffer for it: But for my (...) (says he) I cannot burn: But he that
could (...) burn for religion, by Gods just judgment was burned for his
Apostasy: For shortly after his shop, and house being set on fire, whilst
over-e^gerly be sought to save his goods, himself was burned.

fear of death, renounced Christ, and was set at liberty; whereupon Philbert
said to him: O unhappy, and more then miserable man! Is it possible that to
save your life for a few days you should so deny the truth? Know therefore
that though you have avoided the corporal sire, yet your life shall not be
prolonged; for you shall die before me, and you shall not have the honor to
die for the cause of God, but you shall be an Example to all Apostates: And

quarrel to him, met him and slew him. Eodem. p. 292.

Caligula the Roman Emperor fancied himself a Jove's thunder: He commanded
himself to be worshipped, and set up his Images every where: He dedicated the
Temple at Jerusalem to his own worship: But when the true God gave forth his
voice of Majesty from heaven, he that before was so high, was now as low, and
of a poor spirit, covering his eyes with his cap, running under a bed, or
creeping into a bench-hole for safety: Yet did Gods judgment find out this
Atheist; for he reigned but three years and three months, and was slain by a
Tribune. Suet. in Calig.

answer he made himself very merry, and so went homewards; but by the way he
met with King Attalus, whom he had sormerly much abused, who caused his
servants to carry Daphida upon a great rock, which was called The horse, and
from thence to throw him down, whereby he was broken in pieces. Val. Max. L. 1.

having by his Pardons, and indulgences scraped together vast sums of money to
maintain his courtizans, and whores, and to enrich his bastards, as he was one

within three days.

Anno Christi, 1464. the Bishop of Angiers in France, prosecuted a rich Citizen
in the palace of Paris, for saying publicly, that he believed that there was
neither God nor devil Heaven nor Hell: And it came to pass that whilst the
Bishops Lawyer was opening these things against him, the house where they were,
began to tremble very much, so that a stone from the roof fell down amongst
them, but without hurt to any, yet were they so affrighted, that all departed
for that time: The next day when that cause came to be heard again, the house
began again to shake, and tremble, insomuch as a Summer came forth of its
mortise-hole, falling downwards two foot, and there staid, which did so afright
the people, that they ran away, losing and leaving behind them many of their
garments: God hereby warning them to take heed of such fearful sins as these
are. Eng. de Monstrelit.

Anno Christi, 1502. there was one Herman Biswick, Moses had written, and that
there were neither Angels, nor devils, hell, nor future life, but that the
souls of men perished with their bodies, and that Christ Jesus was a seducer
of the people, and that the faith of Christians, and the Sacred Scriptures were
mere vanity: For which himself, with his books were burnt in Holland. Theat.
Hist.

There was in our own Nation, one Marlin, sometimes Cambridge, but afterward a
maker of Stage Plays, and a notorious Atheist, denying God, and his Son
Christ, and not only in word blasphemed the holy Trinity, but also wrote books
against it, affirming our Savior to be a deceiver, and Moses to be a conjurer,
and a seducer of the people, and the Sacred Scriptures to be vain and idle
stories, and all Religion but a Politic device: But God suffered not such
profaneness to go long unpunished; for this man upon a quarrel intending to
have stabbed another, the other party perceiving it, to avoid the stroke,
caught hold on his wrist, and forced him to stab his own dagger into his own
head, which wound could not be cured by Surgery, so that he lay cursing,
swearing, and blaspheming, and together with an oath breathed forth his
accursed soul: Gods Justice notably appearing, in that his own hand that had
written those blasphemies, was an instrument to wound his head that had devised
them. Beards Theat.

A Gentleman in Bark-shire, was an open contemner Beelzebub: He was a notorious
whoremaster, and so addicted to swearing, that he could scarce speak without an
oath: but at last Gods hand found him out: For being a hunting, he was stricken
by God suddenly, so that falling backwards on his horse, he was taken down
stark dead, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, after a fearful manner.

THe Apostle Peter, 2 Pet. 3. 3. foretold that in the last days should come

Martiques Governor of Britany in France, in the for that their strong God had
now forsaken them, and scoffingly said, that it was time for them to sing: Help
us now O Lord, for it is time: But shortly after he found that their strong God
was living, able to help the weak, and to confound the proud, himself being
presentiy after slain in the siege. Act. and Mon.

Another also in the like case, seeing the Host said, that Christ came to him

The Queen Mother of Scotland having received aid France, forced the
Protestants for a while to retire toward the High-lands, whereupon she
scoffingly said: Where is now John Knox his God? My God is now stronger then
his, yea even in Fife: but her brags lasted not long: For within a few days
six hundred Protestants beat above four thousand French and Scots, etc. See
Master Knox his Life in my first Part.

The same Queen Mother, when some English, and Scots Leith by storm, and many
of them were slain by reason that the scaling ladders proved too short,
beholding it from Edenborough. Castle where she was, burst out into a great
laughter, saying: Now will I go to Mass, and praise God for that which mine
eyes have seen. And when the French had stripped the slain, and laid the naked
bodies along the walls, the Queen looking on them, said scoffingly, Yonder are
the fairest Tapestries that ever mine eyes beheld: I would that the whole
fields which are betwixt Leith, and this place were all strewed with the same
stuff. But this joy lasted not long: For presently after a fire kindled in
Leith, which burnt up their storehouses, and provision for the Army: and the
Queen Mother fell sick and died. Eodem.

CHAP. XXIV. Examples of Gods judgments against Perjury,
SWearing, Cursing, and Perjury are such Godprovoking and Heaven-outfacing
sins, that the Lord does not only reserve wrath for these his enemies in the
world to come, but many times also even in this world he takes some of the
eminentest of these sinners, and (as it were) hangs them up in Gibbets, to be
monuments of his heavy wrath, and indignation, for the terror of others, that
they may hear and fear, and do no more so wickedly: as these ensuing Examples
may sufficiently evince.

It Is a great sin, 1 Timothy 1. 9. 10. Lev. 6. 3. Jer. 23. 10, Hos. 10. 4.

Agesilaus being sent with a great Army from Sparta into Asia Minor against
Tissaphernes the King of Persiu's Leiutenant there: Tissaphernes, desired to
know the reason of his coming, Agesilaus answered, that it was to let the
Grecian Cities free: Tissaphernes entreated him to make a truce with him till
he had sent to the King of Persia to know his pleasure therein: Agesilaus
consented, and so a truce was made, with solemn oaths on both sides; but
Tissaphernes dealt deceitfully, and sent to the King for a great Army. which
being come to him, he sent an Herald to Agesilaus to command him presently to
depart out of Asia. Agesilaus being nothing daunted with the news, returned
this answer, That he gave him no small thanks for that by his perjury he had
made the gods angry with the Persians, and favorable to the Grecians; and
accordingly it so fell out, for coming to a battle, he gave the Persians a
great overthrow. Xenophon.

Lysander King of Sparta, though otherwise a gallant that boys used to be
deceived with false dice, and men with oaths. Plut.

Eumenes being made General of an Army against Antigonus by the young King of
Macedonia, Alexander M. his son, and his protector, they wrote to the two
Colonells of the Argyraspides, to adjoyne themselves to him: (These were
Alexanders old soldiers, whom when he took them with him into India, he made
them silver shields, and called them Argyraspides:) These Colonells obeying the
command went with him into Asia, and after some lesser conflicts, the two
armies met at last in Media, where these silvershields (of whom none were under
sixty, and most of them were seventy years old,) took in such scorn that their
sons and boys should fight against them, that they charged them with such
fury, that after the slaughter of many they made Antigonus his infantry wholly
to run away; but in the mean time Antigonus his Cavalry, had routed the Cavalry
of Eumenes, and seizing upon their carriges, had driven them away, the Silver
shields hearing of it, sent presently to Antigonus, desiring him to restore
them their carriages again: who answered, that if they would deliver up
Eumenes bound into his hands, he would not only restore their carriages, but
greatly prefer them also: Hereupon most treacherously they ran upon Eumenes,
took away his sword, and bound his hands behind him, so that he could scarce
get leave to speak before they carried him away, but at last having obtained
leave, he thus spoke: O my soldiers, ye see the habit, and ornaments of your
General, not imposed upon him by his enemies, but you your selves of a
Conqueror have made him a Captive: You that within one years space, have bound
your selves four times to me by oath, do now to redeem your carriages betray
me to mine enemies, therefore I desire you rather to kill me your selves, for
Antigonus desires not to have me living but dead, and if you will but herein
gratify me, I freely absolve you, from all the oaths wherewith you have bound
your selves to me, or if you will not show me so much favor, then loose one of
my bands, and give me a sword that I may kill my self, or if you dare not
trust me with a sword, cast me to the Elephants to be destroyed by them. But
when he saw that they would gratify him in none of these, he grew into a
passion, and said, Ye cursed villains, I pray the gods, who are the revengers
of perjury, to send you such ends as ye have brought your Generals unto, for I
am not the first whom you have thus betrayed, etc. And so being delivered to
Antigonus, he was shortly after murdered by him: But withal he so hated these
perjured Silver shields, that he burned one of their Colonells, and slew the
other, the rest of them he sent into remote Countries, and put them upon such
desperate services, that by degrees they were all cut off, and never any one of
them, returned into his own Country again. Plut.

King Henry the first of England in the twenty seventh Maud, and that she
should succeed in his Kingdom: they which swore, were first William
Archbishop of Canterbury, and the rest of the Bishops, and Abbats, then David
King of Scotland, Uncle to Maud, now married to the Emperesse of Germany, then
Stephen Earl of Mortaigne, and Bulloigne Nephew to the King, etc. But so soon
as King Henry was dead in Normandy, Stephen hasted into England, and by the
help especially of the Bishops, was made King, and the Emperesse put by: but
behold the revenging hand of God following their Perjury: Stephen though
otherwise a gallant Prince, yet found his Crown, to be but a glorious misery,
Mars, and Vulcan never suffering him to be at quiet; and as he would not suffer
the right heir to inherit, so God would not suffer him to have an heir to
inherit; for his son was put by the Crown, which was conferred upon Henry
son to the Emperesse, the rightful heir. Also William Archbishop of
Canterbury never prospered after his perjury, but died within that year. Roger
Bishop of Salisbury fell into displeasure with King Stephen, who took him
prisoner, seized upon his Castles, and treasures, and so used him that he died
for very grief. Alexander Bishop of Lincoln was also taken by the King, and
led in a rope to the Castle of Newark upon Trent, the King swearing that the
Bishop should neither eat nor drink till his Castle was surrendered; so that
there he gat all the Bishops treasure: and as for Hugh Bigot he also escaped
not long unpunished, says Fabian.

Rodulph Duke of Sweveh, provoked by the Pope, rebelled Henry the fourth, but
in a battle which he fought against him, he lost his right arm, whereof he
shortly after died: acknowledging Gods justice for his disloyalty, punishing
him in that arm, which before was lift up to swear the oath of allegiance to
his Master. Act. and Mon.

breaking sealed by the Name of Christ, whom they profess to be their Savior.

Almerick King of Jerusalem having entered into Caliph of Egypt, and confirmed
the same by an oath, afterward warred upon him contrary to his promise:
whereupon God raised him up many enemies, who miserably wasted the Kingdom of
Jerusalem, himself was beaten out of Egypt, and all hopes of succor failing
him, being wearied with whole volleys of miseries, he ended his life of a
bloody Flux. Hist. holy Wars.

The Egyptians reputed perjury so capital a crime,

Pausanias notes this to be one chief cause, why Philip King of Macedon with
all his posterity were so quickly destroyed, because he made no account of
keeping his oaths, but swear and unswere as might stand best with his interest.

Gregory of Tours makes mention of a wicked varlet France, among the people
called Averni, that forswearing himself in an unjust-cause, had his tongue
presently so tied, that he could not speak but roar, till by his inward
prayer, and repentance, the Lord restored him the use of that unruly member.

Theodor Beza records what befell a perjured person, Apoplexy, he never

Cleomenes King of Lacedemonia making truce with Argives for seven days,
oppressed them in the third night unawares, thinking thereby to avoid perjury:
But the Argive women, their husbands being slain, took up arms, like so many
Amazones, and repelled Cleomenes: who afterward was banished into Egypt, where
desperately he slew himself. Plut.

Uladislaus King of Hungary having contracted a Amurath the great Turk, and
bound himself to it by an oath: the Pope sent a Legate to absolve him from his
oath, and provoke him to war: which he undertaking with a very great Army,
the victory stood doubtful a great while together: but Amurath seeing a
Crucifix in the Christians Ensign, plucked the writing (wherein the late League
was contained) out of his bosom; and with his eyes, and hands cast up to
heaven, said, O thou crucified Christ, behold, this is the League thy
Christians in thy Name made with me, which they have causelessly violated: If
thou be a God, as they say thou art, and as we dream, revenge the wrong now
done unto thy Name, and me, and show thy power upon thy perjured people, who in
their deeds deny thee their God: Immediately afterward, the King in the midst
of his enemies was slain, and the Christians fled, very few ever returning to
their own homes, but perished miserably. Turk Hist.

When Harold King of England was ready to join William the Conqueror, and his
Normans: Gyth, a younger brother of his, advised him that in case he had made
promise unto William of the Kingdom, he should for his own person withdraw
himself out of the battle; for surely all his forces could not secure him
against God, and his own conscience, who no doubt would require punishment for
breach offaith, and promise, withal assuring him that if he would commit the
fortune of that battle into his hands, he would not fail to perform the part
of a good brother, and valiant Captain: but the King contemning this wholesome
counsel, would needs join battle himself, wherein he lost his Army, Kingdom,
and his own life. Camb, Brit. p. 149, 150.

Sigismund the Emperor having granted letters of John Hus, and Jerome of
Prague, under the faith and protection of himself, and the Empire, yet suffered
them to be unjustly burnt at the Council of Constance: after which time the
said Emperor never prospered in any thing that he took in hand, he died
without issue male, and his daughters son [ Ladislaus] died also childlesse,
whereby his name was quite extinguished in one age: And his Emperesse became a
dishonor also to the royal place which she held, and so Gods judgments justly
followed him for his perjury. Luther.

Elfred a Nobleman in the days of King Ethelstane England, conspiring against

treason being discovered, he was sent to Rome to purge himself by oath, where

abjuring the thing, suddenly fell down to the earth, and being carried by his
servants into the English school, within three days after, he there died. Sp.

forthwith choked.

In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, one Annis Averies London, widow, forswore
her self for a little money, which she should have paid for six pounds of Towe

downwards, and so presently died. Act. and Mon.

A certain Inne-Keeper in the town of Rutlinguen,

One hearing perjury condemned by a godly Preacher, I have often for sworn my
self, and yet my right hand is no shorter then my left; which words he had
scarce uttered, when such an inflammation arose in that hand, that he was
forced to go to the Surgeon, and cut it off, lest it should have infected
his whole body, whereby it became shorter then the other.

A rich young maid in Saxony promised marriage that if she ever married
another, the devil might take her away on the wedding day: yet afterward the
fickle wench was betrothed, and married to another: At dinner two men on
horseback came to the house, and were entertained at the feast: and after
dinner one of them leading the Bride a dance, he took her by the hand, and led
her a turn or two, and then in the presence of all her friends, he caught her,
crying out for help, and went out at the gate where he hoisted her up into the
air, and vanished away with his companion and horses, so that she was never
seen more. Sword against Swearers.

Philip King of Macedonia was a great contemner of Arideus one of his sons was

BIshop Ridly in a Sermon at Paul's Cross related a Cornwall in the days of
King Edward the sixth, who riding in the company of other Gentlemen began to
swear, and swagger, and being reproved for it he swore the more, and raged
worse: to whom one Master Haines, a Minister, with gentle words said, that he
should one day give an account thereof: whereat the Gentleman being in a fume,
bade him take no thought for him, but to prepare for his own Winding Sheet:
Well, said the other, amend, for death gives no warning: Gods wounds (said he)
care not thou for me, still raging worse and worse, till coming to a bridge

switched his horse, that he leaped over with him into the water, who as he was
going cried: Horse, and man, and all to the devil. Act. and Mon.

At a Village called Benevides in Spain, two young whisked round about them
for a pretty while, and then passed forwards: the one of them arose in such an
agony that he was scarce able to stand: the other lying still and not stirring,
some other that stood under an hedge a far off, went to see how he did, and
found him stark dead, with his bones so crushed, that the joints of his arms,
and legs turned every way, as though his body had been made of Moss: his
tongue also was pulled out by the roots, and could never be found, which was
the more remarkable, because he was noted to have been an outrageous swearer,

was no deeper a place for him to swim in: Some told him that there was not

Anno 15^7. at Forchenum in the Bishopric of Bamburg, O Paul, Paul, if thy
Doctrine touching the receiving of the Sacrament in both kinds be true, and if
it be a wicked thing to receive it otherwise, then let the devil take me: and
if the Popes Doctrine concerning this point be false, then am I the devils

IT is just with God, that they which will not have truth their King, and

Sim^n Magus, after that he was so sharply reproved ^eter w^nt t^ Rome, and
taught many abominable heresies, affirming himself to be the true God: That the
w^rl^ was created by Angels, that Christ was neither come, no^ did suffer^ he
denied the resurrection of the body, brought in the promiscuous use of women:
used the company of one H^l^na, an harlot, whom he affirmed to be the Holy
Ghost and that he begat Angels of her: he attempted to show his power to the
people by flying in the air, but falling down, he brake his thigh, and died
miserably. Jacks. Ch^o^ p. 186.

Under the reign of Adrian the Emperor there was Benchochab, who professed
himself to be the Messiah, that descended from Heaven in the likeness of a

the Jews to call him Bencozba, the son of a lie. Eus.

Gerinthus the heretic, being in a Bath at Ephesus, John seeing him, said to

Cyril has of his own knowledge recorded a wonderful Hierom, a bold and
blasphemous Heretic, called Sabinianus, who denied the distinction of persons
in the Trinity, affirming the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be but one
indistinct person, and to gain credit to his heresy, he wrote a book to
confirm his opinions, which he published in the name of Saint Hierome;
whereupon Silvanus Bishop of Nazareth sharply reproved him for depraving so
worthy a man now dead, and to detect his falsehood, agreed with Sabinianus,
that if Hierome did not the next day by some miracle declare his falsehood, he
would willingly die: but if he did, the other should die: this being agreed
upon, the day following they went to the Temple at Jerusalem, multitudes of
people following them to see the issue, and the day was now past, and no
miracle appeared, so that Silvanus was required to yield his neck to the
headsman, which he willingly, and confidently did: but when he was ready to
receive the blow, something appeared like Saint Hierome, and staid the blow,
and then vanishing, presently the head of Sabinianus fell off, and his carcass
tumbled upon the ground.

About ^he year 1629. there lived at Cubbington in Warwickshire, a Gentleman
called Master Griswould, of a competent estate, and a zealous prosessor of
Religion, familiarly acquainted with most of the godly Ministers and Christians
thereabouts, and well esteemed of by them: till one Can (lately of Amsterdam)
falling into his acquaintance began to seduce him from his former opinions, and
practice, causing him to scruple, first, joining with our Congregations in
Prayers, and the Sacrament: Secondly, to question whether he might lawfully
hear a conformable Minister, though able, and godly? from thence he fell to
separation: and after a while, he first questioned, and after concluded, that
there was no true Church in the world, to which he might adjoyne himself, and
therefore kept himself to duties with his own family, and rejected all others,
yet staid he not long here, but after a while, excluding his servants, he kept
himself in his chamber with his children only: Then he conceited that all
civil society with others defiled him: and thereupon locking his chamber door
continually, he caused his servants to reach in at the window food for
himself, and children: He cut out all the contents of the Chapters, through
the whole Bible: expected Enthusiasmes, and revelations, often in the day lying
along on the floor, and causing his children to do the like with their heads
in a ring: and when his ancient friends, Ministers, and others hearing of it,
came to speak with him (amongst whom my self was one) knocking at his
chamber door, importuning, entreating, and threatening to break open the door,
yet could they by no means prevail either to have a word from him, or the
door opened: at length one of his children sickened, and died, yet he
concealing it, privately carried it into the next room, and locked it up, till
the corpse putrefying almost choked him: whereupon he caused his servant to
bring him some Moss, (still concealing the occasion) wherewith he stopped the
cranies in his wall to keep out the stench: But his course of life being much
talked of abroad, a neighbor Justice of Peace, pitying his condition, sent
some with command to break open his chamberdoore, which being done, they found
him, and his children (like Nebuchadnezzar) much deformed with their hair, and
nails grown very long, their clothes almost rotten upon their backs for the
want of shift, and all their healths very much impaired with that course of
life: yet neither would he, nor any of his children (being so tutored by him)
speak to any one, though never so much pressed thereunto. But it pleased God at
length that his children being taken from him, and sent to some friends,
recovered both their tongues, and health. Himself upon the breaking open of
this door presently took his bed, refusing to speak to, or converse with any:
and though by godly Ministers and others which came to him, he was labored
with to take notice of the dangerous temptation under which he lay, entreated,
counseled, threatened, and prayed with, and for him, yet still turning his
face to the wall, he would neither hear nor answer them one word; In which
obstinate condition he remained till his death, which was not long after.

David George, alins Haas Van Burcht, borne in Delft in the Low Countries: a
man altogether unlearned, being a painter of glasses: yet subtle of
understanding, and eloquent withal, after he began to disperse his erroneous
tenets, was sought after by the Magistrates of that place, whereupon he fled
with his family to Basil in Suitzerland, where in private he taught, and
advanced his damnable Heresies, confirming his absent disciples by letters, and
books which he caused to be printed in the Castle of Beningen. He died in the
said town of Basil, Anno 1556. for grief that one of his followers was
revolted: Before his death, whereas his disciples thought him to be god, seeing
him draw toward death, he resolutely said unto them, Be not amassed, I go to
begin to show my power: Christ my predecessor to show his power rose again the
third day: but I to show my greater glory will rise again at the end of three
years: Afterward the Magistrate being thoroughly informed of his life, and
doctrine, caused his process to be drawn, and by a sentence, his body was
taken out of the ground, and justice done as if he had been alive, his goods
confiscated, and his books burnt. Belg. Com. Wealth. p. 65. 66.

At Boston in New England the seventeenth of October. William Dier (which woman
held many monstrous, and Heretical opinions) was brought to bed of a Monster,
which had no head, the face stood low upon the breast, the ears like an Apes,
grew upon the shoulders, the eyes stood far out, and so did the mouth: the nose
was hooking upward: the breast, and back full of short prickles like a
Thornback: the Navel, belly, and distinction of the sex were where the hips
should have been, and those back-parts were on the same side with the face, the
arms, hands, thighs, and legs were as other childrens: but instead of toes
it had on each foot three claws, with Tallons like a Foul: upon the back
above the belly, it had two great holes like mouths, and in each of them stood
out two pieces of flesh: it had no forehead, but in the place above the eyes it
had four horns, two of above an inch long, hard, and sharp, and the othee two
somewhat less: It was of the female Sex; both the father and mother of it
were great Familists: The midwife (one Hawkins wife of St. Ives) was notorious
for familiarity with the devil* and a prime Familist: Most of the women who
were present at this woman's travel, were suddenly taken with such a violent
vomiting, and purging, without eating, or drinking any thing, that they were
forced to go home: others had their children so taken with Convulsions (which
they neither had before, nor after) that they were sent for home, so that none
were left at the time of the birth of it, but the Midwife, and two other, one
of which was fallen asleep: and at such time as the child died (which was about
two hours before the birth of it) the bed wherein the mother lay, shook so
violently, as that all that were in the room perceived it: the afterbirth had
prickles on the inside like those on the childs breast. See Mr. Wells short
story, etc, p. 44.

Also about the same time, and in the same place one Hutchinson, who held about
thirty monstrous, and Heretical opinions, whereof you have a Catalogue set down
by the same Author, Page 59. etc. growing big with child, and toward the time
of her labor, at last brought forth thirty monstrous births, or thereabouts at
once: some of them bigger, and some lesser: some of one shape, and some of
another: few of any perfect shape, none of all of them of humane shape: This
Mistress Hutchinson was first banished by the Magistrates of New England into
Read-Island for her Heresies: but not staying long there, she removed with all
her family, her daughter, and her children into the Dutch Plantation to a place
called Helgate: where the Indians set upon them, and slew her with all her
family, her daughter, and her daughters husband, with all their children, save
only one that escaped: which is the more remarkable, because it was never
heard that the Indians either before, or since did commit the like outrage upon
any others.

A Popish* Priest, Parson of Crondal near Canterbury, Poole, was absolved by
him, and got a Copy of the Popes Bull of pardon brought into England by the
said Poole; which the Sabbath following he read to his people, and withal told
them, that having been with the Cardinal on the Thursday before, he had made
him as clean from his sins, as he was at the Font-stone, or the night wherein
he was borne: whilst he was relating this in the Pulpit, he fell down stark
dead, and never stirred more. Act. and Mon.

John Duns, called Scotus, borne in Emildon in Northumberland, Merton College
in Oxford, was wonderful well learned in Logic, and in that crabbed; and
intricate Devinity of those days: yet as one still doubtful and unresolved, he
did overcast the truth of Religion with mists of obscurity: but he died
miserably, being taken with an Apoplexy, and over-hastily buried, he after a
time revived, and making means in vain by a lamentable noise to call for help,
after he had a long time knocked his head against the gravestone, dashed out
his brains, and so yielded up his vital breath: whereupon were made these
verses. Quaecunque humani fuerant, jurisque sacrati,
In dubium veniunt cuncta vocante Scoto.
Quid? quod and in dubium illius sit vita vocata,
Morte illum simili ludificaute stropha.
Quum non ante virum vita jugularit adempta,
Quam vivus tumulo conditus ille foret.
All learning taught in humane books, and couched in holy writ,
Duns Scotus dark, and doubtful made by subtilty of wit.
No marvel that to doubtful terms of life himself was brought,
Whilst with like wile, and subtle trick, death on his body wrought.
When as her stroke to kill outright she would not him vouchsafe,
Until that man (a pitious case) was buried quick in grave. Camb. Brit. p. 814.


Mahomet, by birth an Arabian, was one of the monstrousest Abdemonoples bought
him for his slave, and loved him for his parts, so that he made him ruler of
his house; about which time one Serg^us a Monk (flying for his Heresy into
Arabia) instructed him in the Heresy of Nestorius. A while after his Master
died, and Mah^met married his widow, after whose death he grew famous for his
wealth, and skill in Magic. Wherefore by the advice of Sergius he called
himself the great prophet of God, and his fame increasing, he devised a Law,
and wrote it, which he called the Alcoran, wherein he borrowed something from
almost all the Heresies which were before his time. With the Sabellians he
denied the Trinity. With the Manichees he affirmed that there were but two
persons in the Deity. With Eunomius he denied the equality of the Father with
the Son. With Macedonius he said that the Holy Ghost was a Creature: and held
the community of women with the Nicolaitans: He borrowed of the Jews
circumcision, and of the Gentiles much superstition: And somewhat he took from
the Christian verity, besides many devilish phansies invented of his own
brain: But when he had lived in wickedness about forty years, God cut him
off by the falling sickness, which of a long time having been troubled with,
he told his seduced disciples that at those times the Angel Gabriel appeared to
him, whose brightness he could not behold.

A certain Jesuit in Lancashire as he was walking Wards Ser.

Anno Christi 1591. there was one Edmund Coppinger, Henry Arthington, two
gentlemen who associated themselves with William Hacket, sometimes a very lewd
person, but now converted in outward show, by whose hypocritical behavior the
aforesaid gentlemen were deluded to think that Hacket was anointed to be Judge
of the world: wherefore coming one day to his lodging in London, Hacket told
them that he had been anointed by the holy Ghost: Then Coppinger asked, what
his pleasure was to command them? Go (says he) and proclaim in the City, that
Jesus Christ is come with his fan in his hand to judge the earth: and if they
will not believe you, let them come, and kill me if they can. Coppinger
answered, that it should be done: and so immediately he and Arthington ^an into
the streets* and proclaimed their message^ and when by reason of the confluence
of people they could go no further, they gat up into two empty carts in
Cheapside, crying, Repent, repent, for Jesus Christ is come to judge the world.
And so pulling a paper out of their bosoms, they read out of it many things,
touching the calling and office of Hacket, as how he represented Christ, by
partaking of his glorified body, etc. They also called themselves his Prophets,
one of Justice, the other of Mercy. The City being amazed at this thing, took
Hacket, carried him before a Justice, who after examination committed him, and
at the Sessions being found guilty of sedition, and speaking traitorous words
against the Queen he was condemned, and hanged on a Gibbet in Cheap Side,
uttering horrible blasphemies against the Majesty of God: Coppinger died the
next day in Bridewel, and Arthington was kept in prison upon the hope of
repentance.

Some Donatists which cast the holy elements of Simpson.

Arminius, who craftily revived the heresy of Pelagius, Leiden, and many other
places in Holland, to the great disturbance of the peace of Gods Church, fell
sick, being grievously tormented with a cough, gout, ague, and incessant pain
in his belly: with a great binding, and stopping under the heart, which caused
him to draw his breath with much difficulty: he slept also very unquietly, and
could not digest his meat, his radical moisture dried up: and he had a vehement
pain in his bowels, with an obstruction in his Optic sinews, which made him
blind of his left eye, and his right shoulder was much swollen, whereby he lost
the use of his right arm; and thus languishing in much misery, he ended his
days, October 19. 1609. Hist. of the Netherl.

In the year 1327. there was one Adam Duff, an Irish Dublin, for denying the
Incarnation of Jesus Christ, and saying that there could not be three persons,

the resurrection of the dead, and avouching that the Sacred Scriptures were but
fables. Camb. Brit. Irel. p. 181.

Donatus the father of the Donatists, about the year Caecilianus to the
Bishopric of Carthage, made a schism in the Church, and fell from one error
to another, till at last some of his disciples which were called Circumcellions
grew to that height of madness, that running up and down, when they met with
any passengers by the way, they would force them to kill them; others of them
by leaping from rocks, and high places would break their own necks, or burn
themselves in the fire, that so they might die Martyrs. August.

A certain Anabaptist in the field of Sancto Galli, Voluntas D^i impleta est:
The will of the Lord is fulfilled. Gastius.

John Matthias, one of the Prophets of the Anabaptists Germany, being vexed
with a disgraceful scoff, which was given him by a blacksmith, procured him
to be condemned to death by some of his own rabble, and himself would needs be
the executioner, wounding him first with an Halberd, and that wound not proving
mortal, he after shot him through with a Pistol: Then shedding some
Crocodile-teares, he pardoned him for his rash* speech, saying, That God was
reconciled to him, and that he had a revelation from Heaven, that the man
should not die of his wounds; yet he proved a false Prophet, the man dying
within a few days after. Hist. of the Anabap.

John of Leiden, a Tailor, whom the Anabaptists in Germany chose for their
King, presently after his Coronation, made a great feast, inviting at least
four thousand men and women to it, and between the first, and second course,
he accuses a man of high Treason, and cuts off his head with his own hands,
and returns merry to supper, and after supper with the same bloody hands, he
administers the Lords Supper. Not long after (though there was a great famine
in the City of Munster, where they were, yet) he, and his Courtiers abated
nothing of their full dishes: But one of his fifteen wives (for so many he had)
somewhat more conscientious then the rest, said, That she thought God was not
well pleased with their feasting, and rioting, when the other people pined with
hunger, and so were famished to death in the streets: This mock-King, being
told of this speech of hers, brought her into the marketplace with other of
his wives, and making her kneel down, cut off her head, commanding his other
wives to sing, and give praise for it to their heavenly Father. Hist. Anabap.
Within the space of two years, wherein this Sect of the Anabaptists by their
fanaticall opinions, and practices disturbed the peace of Germany, and much
hindered the Reformation of Religion begun by Luther and others, it pleased God
by eminent, and visible judgments to punish the prime actors and fomentors of
the same: For Thomas Muncer was put to the rack by George Duke of Saxony, where
he roared most fearfully, and in the end had his head cut off, and put upon an
high pole in the fields. Three hundred Anabaptists that fell upon a Monastery
in Friesland, and rifled it, were most of them, either killed by the ruins of
the Monastery, or put to death by the hangman. John of Leiden, and their Consul
Bernard Knipperdoling, were tied to a stake, and together with their great
Prophet had their flesh torn off with hot pinchers, and in the end being
slain, had their bodies put into iron Cages, and hanged on the steeple of
Saint Lambert. Sleid. Com. Lib. 10.

There was in the year 1647. one Quarterman, who Oxford, and been a zealous
professor of Religion, and one that had suffered under the Tyranny of the
Bishops. At the beginning of the difference between the King, and Parliament,
he was chosen Marshal of the City of London, and continued some years in that
employment: afterward he turned a violent Sectarie, and being discarded by the
City, he went to the Army, where he found countenance and employment: But
withal he sucked in errors so fast* that in Southwark, before a godly
Minister, he said, That there was no more holiness in the Scriptures, then in
a dogs tail: which afterward he again affirmed before the said Minister, and
many of his Congregation; whereupon the Minister went forth, fearing (as he
professed) lest the house should fall upon his head, wherein such a blasphemous
wretch was: and within few days after, it pleased God to strike the said
Quarterman with a violent disease, viz. upon February the eleventh, where of he
presently died, and was buried, February the sixteenth. 1647.

In the same year there were in Yorkshire, certain York.

Anno Christi. 1648. there lived in Southwark one Gunne a Sectarian Preacher,
who lived in adultery with another man's wife for about the space of nine
years, and afterward solicited, and lay with one Greens widow; whereupon it
pleased God to strike him with such horror of conscience, that he ran mad, and
continued raving, and raging in a fearful manner, till at the length, having
an opportunity he murdered himself: and the woman with whom he lay, being
examined about it, acknowledged the fact, saying, That she did it, to cure her
brother of his burnings.

Bolton, one that by Separation made the first schism England, first through
the stirring of his conscience, made a public Recantation of his errors at
Paul's Cross, and yet afterward was so dogged with a desperate remorse, that he
rested not, till that by hanging himself he had ended his miserable life.

Anno Christi 1647. there was at Newbery some Anabaptists, that took upon them
to have revelations, and therein to see, and know such glorious things, as
could not be imagined: and one of them had such strange gestures, and fits, as
the like was seldom seen. This woman gave forth, that she had a revelation
that such a night she should be taken up into heaven, against which time many
of them assembled together, took their solemn leaves of her with tears, and
the time being come, out they go to see her ascension. The night was a
Moonshiny night, and as they expected when an Angel should come to fetch her up
in a Chariot, a cloud comes and covers the face of the Moon, whereupon they
all cry out, Behold he comes in the clouds: but presently the cloud vanishes:
whereupon their hopes being frustrate; they still expect his coming: And after
a while comes a flock of wild geese a good way off, whereupon again they cry
out, He comes, he comes: But when the wild geese were gone, at length they
were feign to return to their homes as wise as they came, having made
themselves a ridiculous spectacle unto many.

In May last 1653 in Kendal in Westmoreland, there was John Gilpin, who was
very desirous to associate himself with the Quakers at their meetings, and
speaking with one of them about it, he much encouraged him to hold on his
purpose, and accordingly he went to them when one Chapter Atkinson was Speaker,
whose drift was to deny all Ministerial Teaching, and Ordinances, together with
all Notional knowledge gained by the use of such means, and to become as if
they hade never learned any thing, and now to be taught of God within
themselves: by waiting upon an inward light, which (as he said) lies low hidden
under the earth, viz. The old man which is of the earth earthy.

Gilpin was immediately so taken with this new doctrine: that he resolved to
close with them: was afraid to read any good books, to hear any preaching
Minister, or to call to remembrance any thing which he had formerly learned
concerning God, Christ, his own estate, or any other subject contained in the
Scriptures; for they told him that all such knowledge was but Notional, carnal,
and hanging upon the Tree of Knowledge: adding, Cursed is every one that hangs
on this Tree.

One of them told him that Christ was as man, had his failings distrusted God,
etc.

At his next meeting the Speaker urged him to take up the cross daily, saying.
Carry the cross all day, and it will keep thee at night: He urged him to
hearken to a voice within him: Spoke much of a light within them, which Gilpin
not yet finding, was much troubled, desiring that he might fall into quaking,
thinking that thereby he should attain to the immediate discoveries of God to
him. And accordingly shortly after as he was walking in his chamber, he began
to quake so extremely that he could not stand, but fell upon his bed, where he
houled, and cried in a terrible, and hideous manner, (as others of them used to
do) yet was he not afraid but looked upon it as the pangs of the Newbirth.
After half an hour by degrees he ceased from houling, and rejoiced that now
he could witness against the Ministers of England, as false prophets, and
Priests of Baa^. All the night after he was much troubled with dreams about
his sins: and when he awaked, as he thought thereon, he perceived something
lighting on his neck, and giving him a great stroke, which caused much pain,
and so a second, third, and fourth, each loss then other, descending till it
came to the middle of his back, and then he discerned something to enter into
his body, which Satan suggested to be the Spirit of God like a dove: and he
thought he heard a voice within him saying, It is day: Adding twice: As sure as
it is light, so surely shall Christ give thee light.

Two or three days after he still waited for more light, and walking into his
Garden, he lay down with his face to the earth, at which time his right hand
began extremely to shake: and he was in a great rapture of joy, apprehending it
to be a Figure of his spiritual Marriage, and union with Christ: Then did the
power within raise him, and set him on his feet, and afterward laid him on his
back, brought his sins into his remembrance: causing his hand at every sin
to strike the ground; and he heard a voice saying, Now is such a sin
mortified: then was he persuaded that all his sins were mortified at once:
then rose he up, and it was said to him: Ask what thou will of the Father in my
Name, and he will give it thee: then said Gilpin, What shall I ask? It was
answered, Ask wisdom in the first place: then he desired that such things
might be given him, as made for Gods glory and the good of others: It was
answered, that his request was granted, and that he should be endowed with the
gift of Prophecy, and singing praises to God.

Presently after he went to another of their meetings where Atkinson was again
the Speaker, with which he was more affected then formerly; for that (as he
conceited) he could inwardly witness to what he spoke. Atkinson having done,
one John Audland spoke, in the time of whose speaking Gilpin was by the devil
within him drawn out of his chair, and thrown upon the ground where he lay all
night; all which time his body and members were all in motion, being turned
from his back on his belly, and so back again several times, making crosses
with his legs, and his hands moving on the ground as if he had been writing:
and he heard (as he thought) a voice saying, that that writing with his hand on
the ground signified the writing of the Law in his heart: then were his hands
moved to his head, and he heard the voice saying, Christ in God, and God in
Christ, and Christ in thee. Which words he was compelled to sing forth in a
strange manner, and with such a voice as was not his own, he sung also diverse
phrases of Scripture which were given in to him: then the devil raised him up,
and bade him be humble, then brought him on his knees again, and he heard the
voice saying, Stoop low, low: and when his face was almost at the ground, it
said to him, Take up thy cross, and follow me. Then rising he was led out of
the house by the devil at a back door to the River, and back again, and then
into the Town, where he was drawn down the street, to a door that he knew not:
whereupon two of them that followed him, said, Whither will you go? This is the
Fiddlers house. Gilpin answered: Be it whose house it will, Christ leads me
hither, and hither I must go: then was his hand forced to knock at the door,
and a voice bade him say, Behold, Christ stands at the door, and knocks. The
Fiddler opening the door, he went in, and taking down a Base-viol, he was
forced to play on it, and to dance whereupon he questioned what power led him
to such actions? and the voice presently answered him, This is not because I
love Music, for I hate it, but to signify to thee what joy there is in heaven
at thy conversion: as also, what spiritual Melody thou shall have hereafter.
Then was he led out of the house, and carried through the Town, being forced, as
he went, to proclaim, I am the way, the truth, and the life: Then went he to
his own house, and there by the devil was thrown down, and forced to make
circles with his hands, the voice telling him, that he was now putting off the
old man. His hand also was forced to take up a^stone which lay on the floor,
which he thought to be like a man's heart, and the voice told him, that Christ
had taken that stone out of his heart, and given him an heart of flesh: then
holding it forth to the spectatours, he was forced to say, Except you see
signs, and wonders, you will not believe; And throwing the stone amongst them,
he said, Lo, here is my heart of stone. Then was he cast upon his back on the
ground, and the voice said, Thou shall have two Angels to keep thee: and
immediately two swallows came down the Chimney, and sat on a shelfe near him;
whereupon he cried, My Angels, my Angels, and withal he held out his hand to
them, expecting they should have come to him; but they flew up the chimney
again, though the door, and windows were open. Then was he carried upon his
hands, and knees out of the doors into the street, and when his wife would
have stopped him, he said, he must not be stopped, he must forsake wife,
children, and all to follow Christ. Thus went he up the street, thinking that
he bore a cross upon his neck, till some pulled him out of the mire, and dirt,
and by force carried him into his house, whereupon pointing at one of them, he
said, Christ points at thee, thou art a wicked woman, and have hindered the work
of the Lord. Then the voice asked him, Where is thy cross? upon which he
thought he saw a visible cross hanging in a thread, which with his hand he put
behind his neck: Thus he continued till the evening, when many of the Quakers
coming to him, said, Be lowly minded, and hearken to the voice within thee, and
so they left him, his strength being almost quite spent with his restlessenesse.

His wife and family going to bed, he remained alone, when he began to
question, whether these strange actions were Divine, or Diabolical? whereupon
he trembled, and his hand was forced to take up a knife, which lay by, and to
point it to his throat, and the voice said to him, Open a hole there, and I
will give thee eternal life: But he threw away the knife, and his wife coming
to him, at her persuasion he went to bed, and all the night after he assured
himself that he was possessed by the devil, and in the morning he roared and
cried out, Now the devil is gone out of me, at which instant he, and his family
heard it thunder, though no others heard it.

Shortly after the devil came to him again, and told him, that it was Satan
that had possessed, and seduced him hitherto, but now Christ was come, and had
cast out Satan, and told him also that what he had done the day before was in
obedience unto Satan, and that as he had served Satan the day before in his
clothes, so now this day he must undo all that he had done in his shirt in
obedience to Christ: whereupon he rose out of his bed, went into the street in
his shirt, but some stopped him: whereupon the devil within him told him, that
he must be carried into the house by four women, or else that he should for
ever stand there like a pillar of salt, as Lots wise did. Then four women
carried him into his bed; whereupon he told them, that the day before he had
been doing the devils work, but now he must do Christ's work, etc. Then he fell
to acting in his shirt upon the bed, as he had done the day before upon the
floor, playing topsey turvey from one bed to another: the devil bidding him not
to fear, for (says he) I will give thee strength: then it told him, that the
day before the devil bade him bear his cross, but now Christ bade him lay it
aside, for Christ takes no pleasure in Crosses, nor will be worshipped as
yesterday he had done: It said farther: Yesterday the devil made thee lie all
day on the ground, but now I have provided a bed for thee: For my yoke is
easy: He promised also to give him bread of life to eat, and water of life to
drink, and that out of his belly should flow rivers of living water: Then were
his teeth moved as if he was eating, and he thought that he felt in his belly a
flowing up, and down of waters: he was told also that yesterday the devils
Angels waited on him, but now Christ's Angels should guard him; hereupon he saw
two Butterflies in the window, and his hand was forced to take one of them, and
to put it into his mouth, which he swallowed down: then he was moved to take
the other, and put it to his throat, and he was told that it should enter in
there, for (says the voice) nothing is impossible to him that believes: then
he was forced to make circles on the bed, whereupon he began to supect that he
was acted by Satan, and thereupon in great fear cried out, Lord, what will thou
have me do? But the devil answered, It Is too late to cry unto God, for sentence
is already passed against thee: Hereupon he lay down in despair; but presently
the devil told him the third time, that it was a while devil that had deluded
him this second time; but that now Christ was come indeed, and would cast him
out: and accordingly he thought the devil was ejected: But then all his members
fell on working as if the pangs of death had been upon him: the voice teling
him, that they were the pangs of the Newbirth, and that now Christ was
newborn in him: Thus he continued a whole day, and the devil told him that
now he should work wonders, and cast out devils in Christ's Name. Then came in
two of the Quakers, to whom he said, I have two devils cast out of me, but now
Christ is in me of a truth: Then said the devil to him, I was crowned with a
crown of thorns, but I will crown thee with a crown of glory, and bade him set
his fist upon his head, which (says he) to the standers by shall appear as a
glorious crown: when he did this, he asked them, what they saw? they answered
nothing: whereupon the devil told him, that they saw the crown on his head, but
were so stricken with admiratien that they could not express what they saw:
Then the devil bade him tell one of the Quakers, that he had a devil in him,
but he should east it out: and that he should quake, and tremble, which
accordingly he did: then the devil bade him to speak to him to fall flat on the
ground, which he did, and presently rose again; whereupon Gilpin asked him,
whether now the devil was gone out of him? to which he answered not, but the
devil told him that he was now ejected, etc.

A while after he began again to question whether in all this he were not
deluded by Satan, which made him fall into a great fear, and then the devil
told him that all this while he had been serving him, and blaspheming God: and
that now it was too late to repent: Hereupon he fell into despair for a time,
thinking that every thing which he either heard or saw was the devil that came
to fetch him away: Sometimes he thought that he should be taken away in a flame
of fire; other sometimes that the earth would open, and swallow him: Yet at
last it pleased God (as it seems) to give him repentance and peace in his
conscience; whereupon he published a Narrative, of these things to discover the
danger of these ways, and to be for caution to others to take heed how they go
out of Gods ways, and forsake his Ordinances, least falling into the error of
the wicked, they decline from their former steadfastness, and lest not
receiving the love of the truth, that they might be saved, God give them over
to strong delusions to believe a lie. This is attested under the hand of the
Major of Kendal, the Minister, Schoolmaster, and some others.

As we may not tell a lie, so neither may we conceal Kirkham in Lancashire, one
Mistress Houghton a Papist, who used to say, I pray God rather then I shall be
around-head, or bear a roundhead, I may bring forth a child without an head:
Her mother also being a Papist, used to mock and scoff at the roundheads, and
in derision of Master Prin, cut off her cats ears, and called him Prin: but
behold the just retribution of God! For not long after the said Mistress
Houghton being brought to bed, was delivered of a child without an head, ugly
and deformed. This was attested by Master Edward Fleetwood Minister, the
midwife, and others that saw the child taken out of its grave.

Lords, and Nobles, whether in the Agreement made betwixt King Edmund, and him,
there was any mention made of the children, or brethren of Edmund to have any
part of the land divided to them? The Lords flatteringly answered, That there
was none: Yea, they confirmed their false words with an oath, thinking thereby
to have procured great favor with the King: But he on the contrary ever after
mistrusted and disdained them, especially such as had sworn fealty to King
Edmund: Yea, some of them he exiled, many he beheaded, and diverse of them by
Gods just judgment died suddenly. Speed.

Seleucus marrying Stratonica the daughter of Demetrius, Antiochus the son of
Seleucus fell in love with his stepmother, and not daring to discover it, for
fear of the displeasure of his father, he pined a way from day to day: at last
one of his Physicians found out the cause of his disease, and acquainted his
father therewith, who out of indulgence to his son, calling his Nobles, and
people together, said, I have decreed to make Antiochus my son King of all my
superior Provinces, and to give him Stratonica for his wife, and Queen; and if
she scruple the unlawfulness of the marriage, I desire you that are my
friends, to persuade her that all things are honest and just, that a King shall
decree for the public profit. Plut.

Andronicus one of the Greek Emperors, doted Andronicus, that in comparison of
him, he disregarded not only the rest of his Nephews, but his own children
also: being unwilling to spare him out of sight either day or night: but when
this young man was stepped further into years, besides a world of miseries, and
molestations created to his Grandfather in the mean time, at last he pressed
without resistance upon his Palace, with purpose to surprise his person, though
the old Emperout entreated him with much affectionate eloquence, that he would
reverence those hands which had oftentimes so willingly embraced him, and those
lips which had so often lovingly kissed him: and that he would spare to spill
that blood, from which himself had taken the fountain of life: yet for all
this, he caused the old Emperor to be polled, shaven, and made a Monk, and not
only so, but also the very Anvile of much dunghill-scorne, and vilest
indignities, until the workmanship of death had finished the sorrowful

Austine, upon a terrible, and dreadful accident, Cyrillus, a man mighty

so being drunk with immoderate doting, he neglected to correct him, and gave
him liberty to do whatsoever he list: Now this very day (says he) this same

In the beginning of the reign of Darius King of Persia, Intaphernes conspired
against him, which being discovered to Darius, he caused him, and all his
kindred to be cast into prison: But Intaphernes wife exceedingly weeping, and
houling, Darius gave her leave to choose any one of the prisoners whose life
she would have spared: whereupon amongst them all she chose her brother, and
Darius asking her why she ^se her brother rather then her husband, or son? she
answered: Because if God please I may have another husband, and children; but
my Parents being dead, I cannot have another brother. This so pleased Darius,
that he granted her the life; not only of her brother, but of her son too Herod.

Darius King of Persia being dead, left two sons, Ariamenes, or as some call
him Artabazanes, and Xerxes: these both claimed the Kingdom, but brotherly
love so prevailed with them, that they were contented to stand to the judgment
of the Persian Nobles; yet in the interim, Xerxes being in Persia, performed
all the offices of a King; and Ariaments coming out of Media, Xerxes sent great
presents to him, commanding the messengers to tell him: Thy brother Xerxes
presents thee with these gifts, and if by the consent and suffrage of the
Nobles he be declared King, he promises thee the chiefest place next unto
himself: To which Ariamenes returned this answer: Truly I willingly accept of
these gifts, yet claim the Sovereignty to belong to me, but will reserve the
next place of dignity for my brother Xerxes. The Persian Nobles referred the
determination of this controversy to their Uncle Artabanus, who having heard
both sides, determined for Xerxes, because Ariamenes was borne to Darius
whilst he was a private person, Xerxes, after he was a King: the mother of
Ariamenes was the daughter of Gobrias a private woman, the mother of Xerxes was
Atossa a Queen; Ariamenes hearing this judgment without any distemper of
spirit, rose up, worshipped his brother; and taking him by the hand, placed him
in the Kingly throne, and ever after was very obsequious to him. Plut. Herod.

his brother, I think of Smerdis whom thou have slain, and yet he has none to

CHAP. XXXIV. Examples of Fortitude, Valor and Magnanimity.
Whilst a people walk in obedience to God, he has promised, that they shall
chase their enemies, who shall fall before them on the sword: and that five of
them shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of them shall put ten thousand to
flight, Lev. 26. 7, 8. Whence it appears, that the spirit of courage and
valor is from the Lord; who by small, and weak means does many times effect
great, and wonderful things, that the glory of all may be his. We have had
much experience hereof, in these unhappy, bloody, civil wars: wherein our
great victories, and successes, have been obtained, and carried on most
happily, when the enemy has been most elated, and our selves most weak, and
almost in despair: neither is this any new thing, but according to Gods
dealings in former times, as these following Scriptures, and Examples will more

Other examples: Darius sent a very great Army of Athenians, charging his
Commanders to destroy the City, and bring all the people captives to him;
accordingly they ^ailed into Attica, where landing, they made grievous spoil
of all before them, thinking that Athens would have submitted so soon as they
came near them: but the Athenians choosing Miltiades for their General, sent
him forth with ten thousand Citizens, and one thousand Auxiliaries; who
marching to Marathon, about two leagues from Athens, encountered with the great
Army of the Persians, charging them so furiously, that they prevented the
throwing of their darts, and enforced them to run away like sheep to their
Navy, and after a great carnage, they burnt and took many of their ships also:
At this time Themistocles being a very young man, showed much valor, and
dexterity in the battle. Justin.

Also in this battle Cynaegirus an Athenian, showed Persians to then ships;
when some of them were putting off from the shore, he caught hold of one of the
ships with his right hand, holding it till his hand was cut off, then did he
lay hold on it with his left hand, till that also was cut off, and then he
caught hold of it with his teeth. Justin.

Xerxes sending his Ambassadors to Lacedaemon, and Athens, requiring them to
send him earth and water in token of their homage; they out of greatness of

from thence, if they pleased to carry to their Lord. Pezel. Mel. Hist.

The Lacedaemonians in their public feasts had always

The first of old men, who sang: We have been young, and strong, and valiant
heretofore, Till crooked age did hold us back, and bid us do no more.

The second of young men, who sang: We yet are young, bold, strong, and ready
to maintain That quarrel still against all men, that do on earth remain.

The third of children, who sang: And we do hope as well to pass you all at
last, And that the world shall witness be ere many years be past. In their
wars they assaulted their enemies very fiercely, and never gave over till the
flight of their enemies had assured them of the victory, and then they quickly,
and quietly retreated into their camp judging it unworthy their manhood, and an
ignoble action, to kill, and hew in pieces men once scattered, and out of
order: this much surthered their victories, their enemies being upon their
flight, secured from further danger. Plut.

When Alexander M. had put Calisthenes to death, Lysimachus, another of his

before. Q. Cur.

horse with his father, that he would back him: and accordingly turning him on
the other side where the horse might not see his shadow, he mounted on his
back, and rode him up and down: His father wondering at his Magnanimity, when
he alighted, kissed him, and said: O my son, thou must seek out some other

will do for mine one sake, but what shall I do for thee, for thy sake? Porus

bigger then his own. Q Cur.

Demetrius the son of Antigonus fighting against Ptolomaeus Egypt, was
overthrown in the battle, and losing his carriages, he lost all his furniture,

friends that were taken prisoners, saying, That he fought with him only for
glory, and Empire: Demetrius was so affected herewith, that he prayed to the
gods to give him an opportunity that he might not be long in Ptolomaeus his
debt, but might requite him with the like courtesy: which shortly after fell
out, for in another battle Demetrius overcame Ptolomy, and rejoiced not so much
for what he had gotten, as that hereby he could retaliate Ptolomies kindness,
which accordingly he did by a free release of all his captives. Plut.

deservedst love; but after thou had murdered thy mother, and wife, and had
turned Charioteer, Stage Player, and Boutefeux, I could no longer endure thee.

Mardonius being left with a great Army in Greece, Xerxes his return into
Asia; he sent Ambassadors to the Athenians, persuading them to make peace with
him making many golden promises to them, if they would do it: the
Lacedaemonians hearing of it, sent their Ambassadors also to them, to dissuade
them from it, showing how dishonorable it would be to them, and dangerous to
all Greece: and the better to prevail, they sent them word that whereas their
houses had been burnt, and their harvest spoiled by the Persians, they would
provide for their wives, and children, so long as the war lasted. To the
Persian Ambassadors, the Athenians answered, that they scorned so long as the
Sun kept his course to make any friendship with the Persians, whom they hoped
by the assistance of the gods to drive out of their Country. To the
Lacedaemonians they answered, that knowing the valor of the Athenians, they
marvelled why they should suspect their complying with the Persians, assuring
them, that the greatest promises in the world could not make them unfaithful to
their Country, nor to agree with the Persians whilst there was any one of
them alive, and for their proffer to provide for their wives, and children,
they gave them hearty thanks for the same, but withal told them, that they
hoped they should be able to provide for them themselves, and therefore would
not be burdensome unto others. Herod.

King Porsenna making war against the Romans, Publicola, ^allied out against
him, betwixt whom began an hot skirmish near Tyber; and the enemies exceeding
in number, Publicola fighting valiantly, was wounded so dangerously, that he
was carried away by his soldiers, which so discouraged his Army, that they
fled toward the City, the enemies pursuing them to the wooden bridge, whereby
Rome was in danger to be taken: But Horatius Cocles, with two other young
Noblemen, made head upon the bridge against them. till the bridge was broken
down behind them: then Cocles, armed as he was, and hurt in the hip with a
pike, leaped into Tyber, and swam to the other side of the river: Publicola
admiring his valor, gave him an annual pension for his life, and so much land
as he could compass about in a day with a plough. Plut.

Whilst Porsenna besieged Rome, a citizen called Mutius, devising how he might
kill him, disguised himself, and went into his army, and speaking the Tuscan
language perfectly, was admitted into the Kings presence, but not knowing him,
he drew his sword, and slew one that was near him, mistaking him for the King:
hereupon he was apprehended, and Porsenna calling for a pan of coals, caused
his right hand to be held over it, till the flesh fried, and the sinews
shrunk, yet did Mutius all the while look upon the King with an undaunted
countenance; which Porsenna wondering at, caused the fire to be removed, and
his sword to be restored to him, which he taking with his left hand, was thence
called Scaevola. Plut.

Aristomenes King of the Messenians, was a very gallant, Corinthians, slew one

See the example of Xenophon, in Ingratitude,

Epaminondas with his Thebans, having given the Spartans a great overthrow at
Leustra, went presently to Lacedaemon, and made an attempt upon the City it
self, at which time a valiant young man of Lacedaemon called Isadas, neither
defended with armor, nor apparel, but being stark naked, and his body
anointed with oil, and his sword in his hand, did wonders both in the
judgment of his citizens, and of his very enemies, of whom he slew all that he
met, and yet never received any wound himself: and after the fight was ended,
the Ephori crowned him as a reward of his valor, and then fined him a thousand
Drams for exposing himself to such danger without his armor. Plut.

Epaminondas in another battle that he fought against Lacedaemonians, and
Arcadians, was sorely wounded with a dart, and being carried into his tent,
after the battle was ended, the Chyrurgeons coming to him, told him that when
the dart was drawn forth of his body he must needs die; whereupon he called his
Squire to him, and asked him if he had not lost his shield? he told him, No,
and withal showed it to him: Then he asked if his army had gotten the victory?
they told him. Iea. Then, said he, it is now time for me to leave my life, and
so bade them pull out the dart; whereupon his friends cried out grievously, and
one of them said to him, O Epaminondas, thou die without children: To whom he
answered, Nay truly, for ^ shall leave two daughters behind me, viz. my two
great victories, one a^ Leuctra and this at Mantinea, and so the dart being
pulled out, he gave up the ghost. Plut.

After the battle of Cheronaea wherein Philip K. of Macedon Athenians; after
the victory looking upon the dead bodies of his adversaries* he much commended
them for their valor, for that all their wounds were in their fore-parts, and
for that they died in those very stations which were assigned by their
Captains: Also when with his friends (in token of joy for the victory) he
celebrated a drunken feast, and danced amongst the Captives, deriding them in
their calamity, Damades one of those Athenian Captives, freely said to him, O
King, now that fortune has put upon thee the person of Agamem^on, art thou not
ashamed to act the part of drunken Thersites? Philip wondering at his courage,
set both Damades and all the rest of the Athenian captives at liberty, and sent
them home without ransom, and buried the dead bodies of the slain, and
afterward made peace with the Athenians. Diod. Sic.

Cato being but fourteen years old, used to go with Sarpedon, to Sylla's house,
to salute him: not far off, was the executioners house, whither Sylla sent
whom he pleased to be tormented, and slain: Cato seeing this said to his
Master, Why does no man kill this tyrant Sylla? Sarpedon answered, Because they
more fear him, then hate him: Cato replied, Why then will you not give me a
sword, that I may kill him, and free my country from such a savage beast?
Afterward Pompey being returned out of the East with great glory after his
victories, sought to oblige Cato to him, thinking to strengthen himself
thereby, and for this end desired to marry with Cato's sister, which the maid
much desired, but Cato liked not the motion, returning this answer: That he
would not be ensnared with women: If Pompey did that which was just, and profit
able for the Common wealth, he should easily have him for his friend, otherwise
no bribes, or contracts should procure it. Suetonius.

Before the great battle of Cannae, fought between Carthaginians and Romans,
Hannibal sent his brother Mago to view the number, and countenance of the
enemy; and at his return asked him, what work they were like to have with the
Romans? Work enough, answered Mago, for they are an horrible company: As
horrible a company as they be (said Hannibal) I will warrant thee there is not
one Mago amongst them, and therewith all fell a laughing, which his soldiers
took for a certain sign of victory, which accordingly fell out* Sir Walt.

he might be saved, if he should cast himself down from the wall with that dog?

The Romans being ready to join battle with the Albanes, that they might
avoid bloodshed, agreed that the victory should be determined by three against
three: Now there were in each camp three brethren born at one birth, of equal
years, who were to be the Champions: The three Horatii for the Romans, and the
three Curiatii for the Albanes: who after a doubtful conflict, two of the
Horatii being slain, the third (pretending fear) ran away, and thereby drew
his adversaries asunder, who (by reason of their wounds) could not run with
equal speed: which being perceived by him, he turned back, and slew them one by
one in single fi^ht before they could join together, whereby the day fell to

Breda in the Low Countries being by treachery Parma, Anno 1580. was again
recovered by the Prince of Orange, Anno 1590. by an hardy, and dangerous
enterprise, which Captain Charles of Haraugiere made with seventy two resolute
soldiers, who being hidden in a boat full of turfes, entering at noon day, in
a thousand dangers of their lives, if they had been discovered, they lay still
all the day, and the night following, coming suddenly forth of the boat, they
cut in pieces the Corpse Dugard, giving entrance to the Prince, and Earl of

that had lived long there, and had married a wife, by whom he had two fair
daughters, being then in state to be married, seeing this last calamity
approaching, rather then he would see his wife, and daughters to be brought
into shameful servitude, having called them to him, he first ^lew with his
sword, his two daughters, and then their mother: this done, with an harquebuse,
and a cross bow bent, (as clean bereft of senses) he made toward his
enemies, of whom he slew two at the first encounter, and afterward fighting a
while with his sword, being environed with a multitude of Turks, brought
himself to the end of his most unhappy life. Pur. Pil. v. 2. p. 878.

At that famous battle of Vascape with fifteen thousand soldiers, he overthrew
Abedin Bassa with fourscore thousand fighting men. Car. Lib. 5.

In the Reign of King John of England, a controversy arising betwixt him, and
the King of France, about a Seigniory, and certain Castles: the King of France
offered a Champion to fight for his right; whereupon King John. chose John
Cursy Earl of Ulster: but when the French Champion heard of his exceeding
great feeding, and mighty strength, he refused the combat: Then the King of
France desired to see a stroke given by the hand of John Cursy, and he set a
strong and doughty good morion, or headpiece full of maile upon a great block;
and taking his skeine or sword, he smote the morion through, from the crest
downward, and his sword stuck so fast in the wood, that no other man but
himself could pull it out, yet he himself did it with much facility. Camb.

there was not left in the Town above twenty men, and eighty women: who with
weapons in their hands came to the walls, desiring rather to die, then to fall
into the hands of the Turks: and as the Turks approached to the walls, the
women with stones, fire, and such weapons, beat them off with greater courage
then could have been expected, in their weak sex: which whilst they were
doing, it pleased God that a great storm arose suddenly, which so outragiously
tossed the Galleys, that the Turks were glad to give over the assault, and to
hie away to a place of more safety. Turk. Hist. p. 869.

Scanderbeg was such a mirror of manhood, and Turks, that nine years after his
death, as they passed through Lyssa, where his body lay buried, they dug up
his bones with great devotion; reckoning it some part of their happiness, if
they might but see, or touch the same: and such as could get any part thereof,
were it never so little, caused the same to be set, some in silver, some in
gold, to hang about their necks, thinking that it would animate their spirits,
with extraordinary vigor. Paulus Jovius Illust. virorum.

Valor of Women.
Zenobia the wife of Odenate King of the Palmyrenians, which her husband used
both in peace, and war: She loved her husband exceedingly, but having once
conceived by him, she would lie with him no more till after her delivery: she
was very expert in the Oriental Histories, which she wrote, and left them for
the use of posterity: She was very beautiful, and black sparkling eyes, and her
teeth to white, that they seemed rather to be pearls then teeth: her husband
being treacherously murdered, she took upon her the government, and having
been formerly accustomed to the Wars, she fought often with the Romans,
Subdued Egypt. and drove out thence Probus the Roman president: At last she
rather by compact yielded to, then by conquest was overcome by Aurelian the
Emperor, whose son married her daughter, and many of her stock flourished in
Rome long after. Lipsius.

Valor of Women.

Cowardice, Timerousnesse, Fearfulness.
In a great battle that was fought between Philip King Macedon, and the
Athenians at Cheronaea, wherein the liberty of Greece lay at the stake:
Demosthenes the Athenian Orator, before there was any just cause for it, most

CHAP. XXXV. Examples of Gods judgments upon Sabbath Breakers.
The command of the Sabbath has a special Memento, or Remember prefixed unto
it: that by timely thinking of it, we might lay aside our worldly business,
and get our hearts into an holy array, and readiness for entertainment of God
into them. It is the market day of the soul, wherein the Lord uses to meet his
people to dispense his blessings, and graces in, and by his Ordinances, to
those which humbly, and reverently attend upon him therein. The careful
sanctification of it keeps up the power of godliness in our hearts, and lives.
And if worldly labor is unlawful upon that day, much more are carnal
delights, and pastimes: Melius arare, quam saltare in Sabbato: It is better to
plow then to dance on the Sabbath, was St. Austines judgment: and when men
neglect to punish the profanation of it, the Lord usually takes the sword into
his own hand, and by visible judgments plagues the profaners of it: as will
further appear by these Examples following.

January the thirteenth, 1583. being the Sabbath, Symps. Eccl. Hist.

Not long since in Bedfordshire, a match at football Sabbath in the afternoon:
whilst two were in the Belfree tolling of a Bell to call the company together,
there was suddenly heard a clap of thunder, and a flash of lightning was seen
by some that sat in the Church Porch, coming through a dark lane, and flashing
in their faces, which much terrified them, and passing through the Porch into
the Belfree, it tripped up his heels that was toiling the Bell, and struck him
stark dead; and the other that was with him was so sorely blasted therewith,
that shortly after, he died also. Dr. Twist on the Sab.

At Alcester in Warwickshire upon the coming forth Sabbath day to a Green, not
far off, where she said, she would dance as long as she could stand: but
while she was dancing, God struck her with a violent disease, whereof within
two or three days after she died.

Also in the same place not long after, a young man Though I never played in my
life, yet I will play one bout now: But shortly after, as he was jesting with a
young maid, he took up a birding-peece, which was charged, saying, Have at
thee, and the piece going off, shot her in the face, whereof she immediately
died for which act he forfeited all his goods, and underwent the trial of the
Law.

At Wootton in the same County, a Miller going forth ^abbath-day to a Wake,

down to the ground.

At Woolston in the same County many loose persons Sabbath day, in a Smiths
barn, to the great grief of the godly Minister, who labored all that he
could to restrain it: But it pleased God that shortly after a fire kindled in
that Smiths shop, which burnt it down, together with his house, and barn, and
raging furiously, going sometimes with, sometimes against the wind it burnt
down many other houses, most of which were prime actors in that profanation of
the Lords day. I my felfe knew these four last Examples.

doubted not but to dance about the May Pole the next Lords day: but before he
moved out of that place, he was smitten with such a feebleness of heart, and
dizzinesse in his head, that desiring help to carry him to an house, he died
before the Lords day came.

Lords day, and part of the night also, in revelling, one of them in a Tavern
merrily discoursing the next day of his Sabbaths acts, and voyage over the Ice;
but on Tuseday next after, these three returning homewards, and attempting to
pass again over the Ice, they all sunk down to the bottom as stones, whereof
one only of them was miraculously preserved, but the other two were drowned:
These four last are attested by good hands.

Anno Christi 1598. the town of Feverton in Devonshire April, in the year

flames: Also Anno Christi 1612. it was again wholly burnt down, except a few
poor houses, they being not warned by the former judgment, but continuing in
the same sin. Beards Theat.

CHAP. XXXVI. Examples of Gods judgments upon Murderers and Blood-shedders.
THe positive judicial Law of God is, that whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by
man shall his blood be shed, Genesis 9. 6. and the reason is there rendered,
because such destroy Gods Image wherein man is made: and the cry of blood (if
not punished by man) is so great, Genesis 4. 10. that the Lord comes down from
heaven to call the murderer to account, and by some visible, and remarkable
judgments, or other, to stigmatize this sin, as these following Examples will
more fully manifest.

Murderers ought to be punished with death, Genesis 9. 6. Exodus 21. 12. Prove. 28.

all would not prevail, but that he died of the same disease. Sp. Chr.

partake of the like, and so hanged her self: But shortly after the Divine
justice met with Olympias, who by the appointment of Cassander, one of her sons
Captains, was murdered. Diod. Sic. Justin

seventy three years without any disease, was at last taken with a dysenterie,
and fearing that his former felicity should be overclouded with a lingering
disease, he asked leave of Alexander that he might burn himself: the King
labored to dissuade him from his unnatural purpose, but when he could not
prevail by arguments, he gave his consent, whereupon Calanus caused a pile of
wood to be made, and riding to it, he made his prayers to his Country gods,

to be put to it, he sat with a fixed and unmovable body, till he was burned to

hear no tidings, began to suspect the matter, and therefore following the dog,

examination found guilty; whereupon being put alone into a boat, he was

himself: This villain with his masters money, and bills of exchange, sets up
a shop at Roan. In the mean time the Merchant was expected at Luca, and when he
came not, a messenger was dispatched to seek him, who after much enquiry, heard
at an Inn, that six months before a Lucquois Merchant lodged there, and was
going toward Paris. But the messenger hearing nothing of him there, began to

CHAP. XXXVII. Examples about Marriage, and Conjugal Love.
MAn, and wife, are as the two branches in the Prophet Ezekiels hand, enclosed
in one bark, and so closing together, that they make but one piece: and
therefore marriage is rather a fellowship of the dearest amity, then disordered
love: and though before marriage we may endeavor to fit our choice to our
mind, yet after, we must fit our mind to our choice: yea though all other
contentions betwixt man, and wife are unlawful, yet may they contend each, who
should love other most: and the more to quicken us hereunto, observe these
Scriptures, and examples following.

Other examples: Some Trojans that escaped in the sacking Troy, took such Ships
as they found in the Haven, and putting to sea, were driven by the winds to a
part of Tuscany, near that place where Rome now stands, and the men being gone
on hunting, the women having been very sea-sick, the noblest of them called
Roma, persuaded the other women to set their Ships on fire, that so they might
go to sea no more: the men at their return, finding their Ships burnt, were
exceeding angry with their wives, whereupon to pacify them, they went and
kissed them on their mouths, whence that custom was taken up, which continues
till this day of saluting by a kiss. Plut.

The Romans at the first building of their City, Sabine virgins came to see
their pastimes, they seized upon them, every man catching one for his wife:
this was the cause of great, and long Wars between the Sabines and the
Romans: but at last when the two armies were ready to join battle, these women
ran betwixt them; some of one side, others of the other, with lamentations, and
cries stepping between their weapons, and seeking out their fathers, and
husbands, with their babes in their arms, and their hair dishevelled, they
called sometimes upon the Romans, other sometimes upon the Sabines, with the
movingest expressions they could devise, which so melted the enraged hearts of
both Armies that they gave back a little: Then Hersilia that was married to
Romulus, and some other of the chiefest women said to the Sabines: What offense
have we done to you, that we should deserve such an heap of evils? we were
indeed violently, and against Law ravished by those who are now our husbands,
but you left us so long with them, that now we are tied to them by the
strongest bonds of nature that can be. You came not to our rescue when we were
Virgins untouched; but now you come to take the wives from their husbands, and
the mothers from their little ones, so that the help which you now think to
give us, does but grieve us more then your former neglect of us: These, and
such like speeches brought the two Armies to a parley, during which the women
brought their husbands to their parents, and brethren: provided them meat, and
drink, dressed their wounds, and carrying them home to their houses, showed
them that they were Mistresses there with their husbands, highly loved, and
honored by them: So that in the end a peace was concluded, and amongst other
Articles of agreement these were some: that the Sabine women should remain
with their husbands: that they should be exempted from all service, and work*
save spinning of wool: that they should have the upperhand of their husbands:
that the men should speak no foul, nor dishonest words, nor discover their
nakedness before them, etc. Plut.

A woman of another Country being in talk with Gorgona the wife of Leonidas
King of Sparta, said to her, There be no wives in the world that so much love,
and commend their husbands as you Lacedemonian wives do: the Queen straight
replied, Neither be there any women but we that bring forth men. Plut.

Numa enacted a Law amongst the Romans, that when any man died, his wife
should remain a widow for the space of ten months.

Augustus Caesar died in the kisses of his wife Livia, Livia, nostri conjugii
memor, vive, and vale. She was always exceeding dear to him; and being asked
how she kept his love so long, she answered. Quod diligenter, and prudenter
agens, summum adhibuisset studium, ut omnia faceret ex animo Augusti: nec
curiose perquisivisset quidquam eorum quae Augustus faceret. Plut.

Portia the daughter of Cato was married to M. Brutus, Julius Caesar, was
something melancholy, and troubled in mind about the thing: his wife Portia
observing it, and being grieved that her husband should conceal any thing from
her, she took a rasour, and wounded her thigh, and losing much blood fell into
a fever: Her husband coming home, and hearing of the sickness of his wife,
was much grieved, and went to visit her: She taking the opportunity they being
alone, said thus unto him: My dear husband, sit down, and let us talk
seriously together: when I married you, I came to your house as a wife, not as
a friend, or harlot: and gave up my self unto you not only at bed, and board,
but as a companion of all your joy, and sorrows: I am Cato's daughter, and I
desire that you will take notice of* what stock I come. What therefore shall I
complain of you? truly I cannot do it in other things: only one thing
troubles me, that you make me not a partaker of your secrets, as doubting of my
fidelity, and taciturnity, you cannot dissemble with me: I discern that your
mind is full of trouble, and there is some great secret that you are about:
Why do you conceal it from me? if you cannot expect help, yet expect comfort
from me: and I will assure you of my silence: Do not consider what others of my
sex are but remember again that I am Cato's daughter, and Brutus's wife:
either nature from my father, or custom from my husband has made me valiant,
and constant so as not to fear any danger. What need more words? I have made
trial of myself by this wound, the smart, and pain whereof I can easily bear:
yea, assure your self, that I can die with Brutus, and for my husband.
Wherefore if thou art about any honest thing that beseemes us both, do not
conceal it from me. Brutus wondering at her courage kissed her, and with his
hand lift up to heaven he said, O ye Celestial gods, I pray you make me an
husband fit for such a wife: and so discloseth the whole matter to her.
Afterward when she heard of his death after the battle in the Philippic
fields, she resolved to die, and being for a while hindered by those about her,
she at last snatched some burning coals out of the fire, and putting them into
her mouth, and throat, suffocated herself, Lipsius.

Licurgus the Lacedemonian Lawgiver, enacted, that all they should be infamous
that would not marry: So that on a time Dercillides a Noble Captain coming
into a place, there was a young man that refused to rise up, and do him
reverence; for, said he, Thou have not gotten a son that may do the like to me
in time to come. Plut.

affections. Holy War.

The Emperor Conrade besieging the City of Winsperge Germany: and the women
perceiving that the Town could not hold out long, petitioned the Emperor that
they might depart only with so much as each of them could carry upon her back,
which the Emperor condescended unto, expecting that they would have laden
themselves with silver, gold, etc. but they came all forth with every one her
husband on her back, whereby the men were all saved, and their wives gat
immortal credit to themselves.

A Reverend man seeing a very Choleric couple together: to whom the man
answered, When my wives fit is upon her, I yield to her, as Abraham did to
Sarah: and when my fit is upon me, she yields to me, and so we never strive

In the Bohemian Persecution we read of the Major Litomeritia, who apprehended
twenty four godly Citizens, of whom his own son in Law was one, and after he
had almost pined them in prison, he adjudged them to be drowned in the river
Albis, whereupon his daughter wringing her hands, and falling at her fathers
feet besought him to spare her husband: but he, harder then a rock, bade her
hold her peace, saying, What? can you not have a worthier husband then this? to
which she answered, You shall never more espouse me to any, and so beating her
breast, and tearing her hair she followed her husband to the river, and when
he was cast into the midst of the river bound, she leaped in, and caught him
about the middle, but being unable to draw him forth, they were both drowned
together, and the next day were found embracing one another. See my Genesis
Martyr. p. 151.

A young and beautiful maid was matched to a man she was to him friends,
Physician, Husband, Nurse: yea, she was Father, Mother, Brother, Sister,
Daughter, every thing, any thing to do him good any manner of way: she was full
of merciful and melting affections toward him: for falling into want, by
reason of extraordinary expense, and excessive charges about him, she sold her
Chains, Rings, and richest Attire: she emptied her cupboard of Plate, her
Chabinet of chiefest and choicest Jewels to do him good: and when he was dead,
and friends came about her, rather to congratulate her happy riddance, then to
bewail her widowhood, she did not only abhor, and deprecate all speeches
tending that way, but protested if it were possible, she would willingly
redeem her husbands life with the loss of her five dearest children: and
though as yet the flower, and prime of her beautifullest, and best time was not
expired, yet she strongly resolved against a second match, Because (said she) I
shall not find a second Valdaura, for so her husband was called. Vives, Lib.

An unnatural Husband.
In the time of the fourth Persecution there was in Egypt a woman married to an
husband that was given much to the sin of uncleanness, which when by no
means she could reform in him, she sued out a bill of Divorce, whereupon this
wretched man went and accused her to the Governor that she was a Christian,
and so caused her to be put to death.

A Wife murdering her Husband.
Semiramis the wife of Ninus being very witty, and beautiful woman, whom her
husband loved exceedingly, as she was one day in discourse with him, told him
that she was exceeding desirous of a thing: yet because of the greatness of
it, she durst not discover it, nor could hope to prevail: Ninus not fearing
her subtilty, bade her tell him what it was: She answered, that he should
deliver to her the Government of his Empire for five days: which when she had
obtained, she caused her husband to be slain, and so usurped the Government of
the Empire into her own hands. Diod. Sic.

The Lacedaemonians having intelligence that their Pausanias treacherously held
correspondence with their enemy Xerxes, they sent for him home, and when he
came back perceiving that his treason was discovered, he took sanctuary in the
Temple of Pallas, and the Lacedaemonians fearing to violate the privilege of
the place, durst not fetch him out to punishment, whereupon Pausanias his
mother took a brick, and said it in the door of the Temple, and the other
Lacedaemonians seeing it, they all brought bricks, and made up the door,
whereby Pausanias perished of famine. Herod.

When the Sabines came against Rome, and besieged Tarpeius was Governor, his
daughter Tarpeia contracted with them to betray the Castle into their hands,
upon condition that they would give her all the golden bracelets which they
wore upon their left arms: to this the Sabines agreed: and she in the
nightime opened a posterne, and let them in: and afterward when she
challenged her reward: Tacius the Sabine General bade all his soldiers do as
he did: and withal he threw his bracelet at her, and his buckler also which he
wore on his left arm: and all the soldiers doing the like, she was pressed
down with the weight of them; and died immediately and so received the just
reward of her treachery.

Antigonus was not singular when he said, that he loved them that did betray,
but hated them that had betrayed. Nor Augustus Caesar, who told Rymitalces the
Thracian, that he loved the treason, but hated the traitor. Plut.

Camillus with the Roman Army besieged the strong Falerians in Italy, but it
was so well fortified, and furnished, that the inhabitants made little account
of the siege. At this time the whole City had but one common Scholmaster, who
used to lead out his Schoolars into the fields to play, and watching his
opportunity, he at last led them to the Roman Guards, delivering them all up
into their hands, and himself going to Camillus said: Sir, I am Schoolmaster to
all these children, yet do I prefer the favor of the Romans before my
honor, and office, and therefore have I delivered up these children to you, by
whom you may make the Falerians yield upon your own terms. Camillus answered,
that indeed in the Wars there were many wrongs done, yet a Noble General
should rather seek victory by Valor then by wicked, or treacherous means: and
therefore abhorring this vallainy, he presently commanded his Sergeants to
tear off this Schoolmasters clothes, and to bind his hands behind him, and
to give the boys whips, and rods to whip back the Traitor into the City that
had so basely betrayed them. In the mean time the Falerians hearing how their
children were betrayed, ran up to their City-Walls like distracted persons, but
there they spied the boys whipping the Schoolmaster stark naked toward the
City, which so wrought upon them, that they presently sent forth, and made
peace with the Romans. Plut.

Aristomenes King of the Messenians being driven out Lacedaemonians, was forced
to fly to the Arcadians for succor: and being a gallant man, had purposed
with a select band to have invaded Sparta whilst their Army was plundering his
Country; but the King of Arcadia being privy to his design, discovered it to
the Lacedaemonians, and so prevented it: for which treachery his own subjects
stoned him, and cast him unburied out of their confines, setting up a Pillar by
him with this inscription:

Difficile est hominem perjurum fallere Divos. Diod. Sic.

Ochus King of Persia raising a great Army, went against the City of Sidon in
Phenicia, where one Tennes was King, who hearing of Ochus his purpose, hired
Mentor of Rhodes with some other Grecian Auxiliaries for his aid; but when
Ochus drew near with his huge Army, he sought to provide for his safety rather
then his honor, sending one privately to Ochus, proffering to betray the City
to him: Ochus being glad to hear this, promised whatsoever he required;
whereupon Tennes accordingly betrayed the City into his hands: But before Ochus
came, the Sidonians to make their men to fight more desperately, had burnt all
their ships in the haven, that so all hopes of escaping might be taken away: so
that the City being thus betrayed, the Citizens seeing their desperate
condition, shut up themselves with their wives and children in their houses,
and so firing them, burnt themselves and all that they had, by which means
there perished above forty thousand persons. But Ochus now standing in no
further need of Tennes, caused him to be murdered. A just reward for his
treachery. Pez* Mel. Hist.

Before the first great battle that Darius King of Persia fought with Alexander
M. he sent the greatest part of his money, and rich furniture to Damascus to be
kept in safety there: but Alexander sending Parmenio against it, the Governor
betrayed the City, and all those infinite riches into his hands: which treason
he escaped not long with, for one of his own consorts slew him, and cutting off
his head, carried it to Darius. Q. Cur.

Bessus having basely betrayed, and murdered Darius, Alexander pursued him
into Bactria, and when he drew near him, Spitamenes one of Bessus's chief
friends, laid hands on him, bound him, stripped him naked, and so putting a
chain about his neck, led him to Alexander: to whom Alexander said: What
brutish madness seized upon thee, that thou durst lay hands on thy King, and
murder him, when he had deserved so well of thee? Bessus would have made an
apology, but Alexander delivered him to Darius his brother to do with him as he
pleased, who leading him to the place where he had murdered Darius, cut him in
pieces there. Q. Cur.

Darius having for a long time besieged Babylon in Zopyrus, cut off his own
ears and nose, and with his fresh bleeding wounds fled to the Babylonians,
pretending that he came to them for succor, and accused Darius for his
cruelty, saying, that he had so mangled him for counselling him to give over
the siege: whereupon the Babylonians, knowing his prowess, trusted him with
the greatest part of their forces: which when Zopyrus had obtained, after some
small colorable overthrowes given to the Persians in ^allies, spying his
opportunity, he betrayed the City, and delivered it up into Darius his hand,
who had lain in siege before it twenty months.

A wicked Varlot betrayed the Isle of Rhodes to the Turk, upon condition to
have his daughter to wife with a great Dowry: but when the Turk had gotten the
Isle, he told him, that he must not have a Christian to his son in Law; but he
must first be a Musselman both within and without, and therefore he caused his
Baptized skin (as he called it) to be flayed off, and appointed him to be put
into a bed strewed with salt that he might get a new skin, promising that then
he should be his son in Law: But the wicked wretch ended his life with shame,
and torment: Princes love treason, but hate the traitor. Turk. Hist.

Banister servant to the Duke of Buckingham in the Richard the third, upon the
promise of a thousand pound basely betrayed his Lord, and Master, from whom he
had formerly received great favors; but after his base treachery, he never had
the reward promised; and besides* had these judgments befell him: His eldest
son fell mad, and so died in a Swine-sti^: His second son became deformed
in his Limbs, and fell lame: His third son was drowned in a small puddle of
water: His eldest daughter was suddenly struck with a foul Leprosy: and
himself in his old age was arraigned, found guilty of murder, and escaped
hanging very narrowly. Speed. Chron. p. 927.

was rolled up, and down till he died. Turk. Hist. p. 824.

A Noble Senator in Rome being proscribed by the Triumviri, they promised a
great reward to them that would discover him to them; whereupon the Senators
own servant betrayed him. The Triumviri, according to their promises, first
rewarded him for his service to the State, because he delivered up into their
hands one that was judged guilty of treason, and then to reward him for his
treachery to his Master, whom he should have preserved, they threw him down
headlong from the Capitol, whereby he brake his neck.

Don Frederick son to the Duke of Alva, going Naerden in Holland, was
admitted into the town, and himself and soldiers feasted by the Bourgers,
after which he commanded them with the rest of the inhabitants to go into a
certain Chapel where they should be made acquainted with such Laws as they
were to be regulated by: but when they were thus assembled, he sent his
soldiers, commanding them to murder them without sparing any one: The men
were Massacred: the women first ravished, and then murdered: the children, and
infants had their throats cut. See my Genesis Martyr. p. 265.

reverence-sake offered sacrifice to the image of Faith.

Attilius Regulus, General of the Roman Army against Carthaginians, being
overcome was taken prisoner, after which being sent to Rome upon his Parole
with conditions of peace which he judged dishonorable, he first dissuaded his

Carthaginians, though he was sure to die a painful death. Tul. de offic.

Pontius Centurio, a Captain of Caesar's being taken Scipio, Pompey's father in
Law, had his life offered him with an honorable place in Pompey's Army if he
would leave Caesar, and serve Pompey: But he stoutly answered Scipio, that
though he thanked him greatly for his kind offer, yet that he would not accept
of life upon such unequal conditions, choosing rather to die then to falsify
his faith to Caesar.

Themistocles being banished Athens by his ungrateful Artaxerxes for refuge,
with whom he found great favor, and having continued a while with him,
Artaxerxes went to war against the Athenians, and would needs have
Themistocles to go along with him: Themistocles was content upon condition that
the King would swear to him that without him he would not go into Greece: this
Artaxerxes assents to; whereupon Themistocles making a great feast, and
inviting his friends to it, the feast being ended, he drank a draught of bulls
blood, and so poisoned himself, by this means showing his faithfulness to his
City, which had been so ungrateful to him: for he prevented the Kings going
against it by reason of his oath, and rather chose death then that himself
would act any thing against it. Diodorus.

King Porsenna making peace with the Romans, Romans should deliver to him ten
young Noble men's sons, and ten of their daughters for hostages, which was
accordingly done, and Publicola's daughter called Valeria, was one of them;
within few days after these ten Virgins went to the river Tyber to wash
themselves: where, being freed from their guard, they had a great desire to
escape over the river, though it was very deep, and ran with a swift
stream, and so to get home; and Caelia venturing first upon her horses back,
encouraged the others, and so they gat all safe over, and went, and presented
themselves to Publicola; but he was so far from countenancing them in their
escape, that he immediately sent them back to Porsenna: when they came back,
Porsenna asked which of them it was that had first adventured to swim the
river? and being showed Caelia, he sent for one of his best horses, and richest
furniture, and bestowed it upon her. Plut.

Other Examples: The Gauls having besieged the Roman Capitol seven months,
both sides grew weary, and upon treaty the Romans were to give the Gauls a
thousand pound weight of gold, and so they were to depart, which agreement was
sworn to on both sides; but when they came to weigh the gold, the Gauls would
hold the scales, and used much falsehood therein: Brennus also their King took
off his sword, and girdle, and put it into the scales, and being asked by
Sulpitius what he meant by it? he answered, What can it mean but misery to the
vanquished? Just at this time came Camillus to Rome with an Army that he had
gathered amongst the confederates, and being informed of all that happened, he
marched in good order to the place where the gold was weighing, which he took
out of the scales, and divided it amongst his soldiers, and then falling upon
the Gauls, he forced them to depart without their money. Plut.

Other Examples: Cambyses, King of Persia making Egyptians, overthrew them in a
great battle, and took the regal City Memphis, and therein the King
Psammenitus, and all his family, and Nobles, after which he kept him prisoner
in the suburbs, and then caused the daughters of the Nobles, and amongst them
Psammenitus daughter clad in base apparel to fetch water in tankards from the
river: which when their parents saw, they all brake forth into grievous
weeping, only Psammenitus with his eyes fixed upon the ground showed no sign
of sorrow. Then did Cambyses cause the Noble-mens sons, and amongst them
Psammenitus his son to be led to execution tied together by the necks with
ropes, and bridles put into their mouths: hereupon their fathers again brake
forth into lamentations, only Psammenitus stood quiet as before: But presently
after seeing an old man his intimate friend begging in the streets, he brake
forth into grievous lamentations, which Cambyses observing, sent to him to know
what was the reason that he when he saw his daughter so abused, and his son led
to death mourned not: but now when he saw this poor man that was no kin to him
begging he made such heavy moan? To whom Psammenitus answered, My domestic
evils were greater then that I could express my sorrow for them: but the
calamity of my friend deserves my tears; for that now in his old age from an
high estate he is brought to such extreme poverty. Herod.

Darius having escaped a great danger in his return Scythia by the faithful

Cyrus Junior was of that friendly disposition that of Subjects, he reserved
none to himself, but distributed them amongst his friends according to their
several qualities; and when he had choice apparel sent him, he used to say,
that his own body could not wear it, but he thought himself richly adorned in
seeing his friends adorned with it: When he had excellent wine, he would send
his friends most of it, saying, that he believed that they could not get
better: When he had costly cates at his table, he would send them a great part
with this message: Tell them that Cyrus sends you these things, because himself
liked them exceeding well. Xenophon.

matter, and so was condemned. Theodora hearing of it, thinking to excuse him,
came, and presented herself as the guilty party, desiring that she might die,
and the other be excused; but the merciless Judge caused them both to be put
to death. See my Genesis Martyr. p. 52.

CHAP. XLII. Examples of gross Ignorance, and Folly.
THere were never any former ages which enjoyed the like means of knowledge,
as we which live at this day do: for besides the sacred Scriptures in a known
tongue, how many volumes of heavenly truths, dropping from the mounthes, and
pens, both of ancient and modern Divines, has that most excellent, and
exquisite Art of Printing conveyed to us? how many burning and shining lights
do daily waste, and consume themselves to propagate saving knowledge unto
others? and therefore to love darkness, or to live in darkness under so great
light, will much aggravate our condemnation: whence it is that we have great
cause to bewail with tears of blood, not only that woeful ignorance which is
still to be found in those kingdoms, wherein the more then Egyptian darkness
of Popery has overspread their Horizons, but which also is too rife and
frequent amongst our selves: both which may in part be discerned by these

After the battle of Marathon, wherein the Grecians Persians, they found their
enemies tents full of gold, silver, rich apparel, and other treasures; yet
Aristides, to whom a great share of them did belong, would not touch any of
them, nor take to himself the worth of one farthing. Plut.

Aristides, who by his prudence, Policy, and valor Athenians, did so contemn
riches, that when others abounded, he only remained poor: and when a kinsman
of his called Callias, who had exceedingly enriched himself by the Persian
treasure, was accused to the people for neglecting to relieve him in his wants:
Aristides himself undertook his defense, telling them that Callias had often
offered him much, but he had always refused it: For there are many, says he*
that abuse their riches, but few can bear poverty well. Plut* When he died he
was bur^ed at the public charges of the City, not leaving so much as would pay
for his own funeral Plato thought that amongst all those famous, and worthy men
that Athens had bread, none deserved so much honor as Aristides: for that
whereas others had filled Athens with stately buildings, money, and other
trifles: only Aristides in managing the affairs of the Commonwealth, had
proposed nothing to himself but the advancement of virtue. Pez. Mel. Hist.

Cimon the son of Aristides, after his fathers Athens, would by no means take
any bribes, but did and spoke all things gratis: and when a certain Persian
exile with a great Mass of treasures fled to Athens, meeting there with some
affronts, went to the house of Cimon, and there set down before him two great
goblets full of gold, and silver; Cimon seeing it, laughed* and said unto him,
Whether would thou have me thy friend Gratis, or thy Patron hired by a great
sum of money? Therefore, said he, take these things away, and m^ke use of me
as thy friend, and employ thy money otherwise as thou please. Plut.

This Cimon when he had gotten a compe^ent estate, so every one might freely
make use of the fruits thereof: He kept a frugal Table, yet enough for many,
and so entertained all comers. Plut.

Epimenides, a very wise and good man, having taken Athens, when he was to
return home, the people offered him great sums of money; but he refused all,
only desiring them to give him a branch of Olive, with which he returned into
his own country. See his example in Reformation. Plut.

Epaminondas that was one of the gallantest men Greece bred, who freed his
country of Thebes from the Lacedemonian slavery; and obtained many great, and
admirable victories; yet was he such a contemner of riches, that when he died
he left not enough to discharge the charge of his funeral. Just.

The Lacedaemonians having freed themselves from Philopoemen, the most
accomplished man in all Greece, and thereupon resolved to send Ambassadors to
make a tender to him of this Mass of money; but every one, (knowing how far he
was from being caught with such baits) refused that office: At last they chose
one Timolaus of his ancient acquaintance, who wen to him at Megalopolis, where
being entertained and feasted by Philopoemen, observing his gravity, frugality,
and temperance, was so discouraged, that (not daring to deliver his message) he
returned without effecting any thing; the like did a second: but a third being
sent to him, took the boldness to tell him how much the Lacedaemonians esteemed
and honored his virtues, whereby he prevailed with Philopoemen to go to
Lacedemon, who there (in a public Assembly of the people) exhorted shem that
they would not go about to buy friends by their gifts who were ready to serve
them without them, persuading them rather to employ that money in bribing their
turbulent Orators that disturbed the peace of the City: with so high a mind
did he despise their money. Plut.

Agesilaus King of Sparta used to say that he had rather make his soldiers
rich, then to be rich himself. Xenoph.

Lysander King of Sparta having overcome the Athenians Dionysius the Sicilian
Tyrant sent him costly garments for his daughters, he returned them back again,
saying* That he feared lest his daughters should be disgraced by them. Plut.
Xenoph.

The King of Persia sending to Epaminondas, that famous Thebane Captain, three
thousand pieces of gold to make him his friend, he sharply rebuked the
Ambassador that brought it, for traveling so long a journey to corrupt
Epaminondas: and bad him take it back, and tell his King, that if he deserved
the favor of the Thebanes, Epaminondas would be his friend without a bribe;
but if he deserved otherwise, he would be his enemy. Plut.

The same Epaminondas hearing that his Squire had Give me my shield from thee,
and go and buy thee a shop, and turn hucster; for now that thou art grown rich,
I am sure thou will not adventure thy self into dangers. Plut.

Agesilaus King of Sparta was a great contemner of riches, and could not endure
covetousness: So that never any of his soldiers, or Officers had cause to
complain that he wronged them in their wages, or otherwise, but every one
praised him for his bounty. Plut.

Agesilaus King of Sparta was such a contemner of Persia in his time made it
all their care to heap up gold, silver, and all precious things, he on the
contrary valued not any of them: he suited his expenses to his incomes, and to
get money would never do any unjust thing. Plut.

Pyrrhus King of Epyrus in the first battle that he Italy against the Romans,
overcame them, and took one thousand eight hundred prisoners; whereupon the
Romans sent Ambassadors to him, proffering a great sum of money for their
ransom; but he rej^cting their money set them free gratis, and taking a great
love to one of the Ambassadors called Fabricius, and understanding that he was
very poor, he proffered him a fourth part of his Kingdom if he would serve
him: But Fabricius scorned the proffer* wherewith Pyrrhus was so taken, that he
presently sent* and made peace with the Romans. Eutrop.

Marcus ^ttilius Regulus, the Roman Consul was Africa against the
Carthaginians, his wife and children were maintained upon the public charges.

Curious Dentatus the Roman Consul, having gorten Samnites, they sent
Ambassadors to him with a great sum of gold, who found him parching pease
for his dinner; and when they proffered him the gold, he said to them, I had
rather have these pease in my earthen pots, and rule over those that have gold,
then to receive your gold of you: And when he was afterward charged with
stealing something that should have been brought into the public treasury, he
brought forth a wooden platter that he used to sacrifice in, and swore that of
all the spoils he had reserved only that to himself. Aur. Victor.

Vergerius the Popes Legate was sent by his Master to Luther (when he first
began to preach against the corrruptions of the Church of Rome) to proffer him
a Cardinals hat, if he would relinquish his opinions: To whom he answered,
Contemptus est a me Romanus and favor and furor: I neither care for the favor,
nor fury of Rome. At another time there was a design to give him a great sum
of money; but one (wiser then the rest) cried out, Hem! Germana illa bestia*non
curat aurum: That beast of Germany cares not for money. See his Life in my
first Part.

Luther tells us that when the Pope sent some Cardinals Valde protestatus sum,
me nolle sic satiari ab eo: I said flatly that God should not put me off with
these low things. See his Life in my first Part.

Love of money the root of all evil.

Lycurgus the Lacedemonian Lawgiver considering the manifold mischiefs which
come by the love of money, and covetousness, banished the use of money out of
the Commonwealth, forbidding all coin of gold and silver, employing iron in
stead thereof, whereof a great quantity was but worth a little, so that to lay
up ten pound in iron would have filled an whole Cellar: hereby he prevented all
theft, and robberies: Hereby also he prevented all superfluous, and
unprofitable sciences; for who would make such things as would undo them, by
reason of the baseness of the money which they should receive for them? Hereby
also they could buy no foreign commodities, because their iron money would go
no where else. This kept out of his Commonwealth Rhetoricians which teach the
cunning art of Lying, and Panders which keep brothelhouses: and Goldsmiths, and
Jewellers which sell toys for women. Hereby delicateness wanting fuel by
little, and little vanished. Housholdstuffe was excellently made; for
Artificers laying aside superfluous works, wholly employed themselves in making
necessary things. Plut.

Bid in his Ecclesiastical History of England, reports Anno Christi 420. After
that the Britanes had been long afflicted by the Picts, and Scots, the Lord at
last gave them rest from all their enemies, and sent them such plenty of corn,
and fruits of the earth, as the like was never known before: But instead of
returning thanks for those mercies; they fell to all manner of riot, and
excess, which, was accompanied with many other foul enormities, especially
with a hatred of the truth, and contempt of the Word of God: For which cause
the Lord sent amongst them such a contagious plague, that the living were
scarce able to bury the dead: and when by this judgment they were not
reclaimed, the Lord brought upon them the fierce, and cruel Nations of the
Saxons, and Angli out of Germany, who though at first they came to help them,
yet after a while they turned against them, and after much bloodshed, drove
them out of their Country into the mountains of Wales, where they remain
unto this day. See this more fully in my English Martyrologie.

Gildes, a godly, and learned man, was at another Britanes to repentance, and

and Towns were decayed, and much of the Land turned to a wilderness.

of the play was scurrilous, and blasphemous, containing some bitter taunts
against all godly persons under the name of Puritans, and at religion it self
under the name of observing fasting days: But as they were acting of it, it
pleased God, that the room wherein the people was, fell, whereby five were
slain outright, and above sixty were hurt, and sorely bruised. One woman had
her leg broken, which being cut off, she died within three or four days:
besides, there were about twelve broken arms, and legs, and others put out of
joint: This is written at large by Mr. John Row a godly Minister, and preacher

threw it against heaven with all his might, when behold the dagger vanished,
and five drops of blood fell upon the table in the midst of them, and
immediately the devil came in, annd carried away the blasphemous wretch with
such a noise that the whole City was amazed at it: The other, half distracted
with fear, strove with all their strength to wipe out the drops of blood: but
the more they wiped it, the more clearly it appeared. The rumor hereof flying
through the City, multitudes flocked to the place, where they found the
Gamesters washing the board, whom by the decree of the Senate they bound with
chains, and carried toward the prison: but as they went by the way, one of
them was stricken suddenly dead, with such a number of lice, and worms
creeping out of him, as was wonderful, and loathsome to behold: The third to
avert the indignation that seemed to hang over their heads, was by the Citizens
immediately put to death. The table was preserved for a monument to show the

CHAP. XLVII. Examples of Justice: The duty of Judges, and Magistrates.
TO do justly is the duty of every Christian, Mich. 6. 8. but especially of
Magistrates, and such as are in authority: and then people may sit under their
own Vines and Fig Trees in safety, when Justice runs down like a river, and
righteousness as a mighty stream in the streets. But alas! in such woeful times
as these, wherein the sword rages, and is drunk with blood, we may complain
with the Prophet, Isa. 59. 14. that Judgment is turned backwards, and Justice
stands afar off: Truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter: for it
is with us, as with that man who came to the General of an army for justice, to
whom he answered; What do thou talk to me of justice? I cannot hear the
voice of Justice for the noise of Guns, and Drums. Oh therefore pray for the
peace of Jerusalem, and give God no rest till he make, and till he establish it
a praise in the earth: and that we may be the more enamoured with the beauty of
justice consider these Examples following, and these Scriptures requiring it.

allied to Brutus, and two of his own sons were drawn into this treason by them:
The conspiracy being at last discovered, the Consuls met in the public place,
and sent for the conspirators, and there before all the people discovered the
treason: The people being much amazed, hung down their heads; only some few,
thinking to gratify Brutus, moved that they might be banished: but Brutus
calling his sons by name, asked them, what they could answer for themselves?
and when, being confounded they held their peace, he said to the Sergeants,
They are in your hands; Do justice. Then did the Sergeants tear off their
clothes, bound their hands, and whipped them with rods, which sad spectacle
moved the people to pity, so that they turned away their faces, But their
father never looked off, nor changed his severe countenance, till at last they
were laid flat on the ground, and had their heads struck off: Then did Brutus
depart, and left the execution of the rest to his fellow-Consull: But Collatine
showed more favor to his kindred, being solicited thereto by his and their
wives. Valerius, a Noble man of Rome, seeing this partiality, exclaimed against
him for it, saying, That Brutus spared not his own sons, but Collatine to
please a few women was about to let manifest Traitors to their country,
escape: and the people called for Brutus again, who being returned to his
seat, spoke thus, For mine own children, I judged them, and saw the Law
executed upon them; for these other, I leave them freely to the judgment of
the people: whereupon they all cried out, Execution, execution; and accordingly
their heads were presently struck off. Plut.

Harpalus that was made Treasurer by Alexander M. Babylon whilst he went to

all manner of looseness, and impurity, ravishing Noble Virgins, and defiling
Matrous; but when he heard of Alexanders return, fearing to be called to
account for his vi^^ainy, he stole five thousand talents of silver, and so fled
to Athens, laboring by his money to corrupt the Citiz^ns to secure him against
Alexander, and especially he sough to corrupt their Orators, which had most
power with the people: But Demosthenes exhorted the people to expel him out of
their City, and not to bring an unnecessary war upon themselves, in defense
of ^o unjust a cause: yet afterward being with Harpalus he spread amongst his
treasures, one of the Kings cups of gold, and began highly to commend it for
the beauty, and curious workmanship; and Harpalus perceiving his covetous mind
thereby, bade him take the cup in his hand, and guess what it might weigh:
Demosthenes answered that he could not guess: But, says Harpalus, this cup
will bring you twenty talents; and accordingly at night he carried him the cup
with twenty talents in it: Hereupon the next morning when the people were met
together to debate the cause of Harpalus, Demosthenes came to the Pulpit all
muffled about his throat, and mouth, and when he was called upon by the people
to speak his mind, he told them that he was troubled with a squinancy, and
could not speak; wherewith some merry fellows made sport, saying, that
Demosthenes had that night gotten a silvernancy, and not a squinancy: Diod.

MOses was the Lawgiver to the Israelites, Number. 21. 18. Deuteronomy. 33. 21.

Amongst the Lacedaemonians Law-suites were not Plut.

Lycurgus was the Lawgiver to the Lacedaemonians Delphos to the Oracle of
Apollo to consult therewith about the success of his enterprise. Plut. He
would have none of his Laws written, but commanded parents by the virtuous
education of their children, and youth to implant them in their hearts, and
lives. Plut.

When by experience he saw his Laws well approved Apollo, and in the mean
time he desired them to observe his Laws inviolably, without altering any thing
until his return: this they all promised him faithfully, yet for the greater
security, he took an oath of the Kings, Senators* and all the people to make
good their promise to him, and so went to Delphos, where he sacrificed to
Apollo, and asked him if his Laws were sufficient to make a people happy: the
Oracle answered that they were, and that his Citizens observing them should be
the most renowned in all the world. This answer Lycurgus wrote, and sent to
Sparta, and then taking his leave of his son, and friends, he pined himself
to death, commanding his friends to burn his body, and to throw his ashes into
the sea, lest any part of him being carried into Sparta, his Citizens should
say that he was returned again, and so think themselves absolved from their
oath. According to his expectation whilst Lacedemon observed his Laws it
flourished in wonderful prosperity, and honor for five hundred years
together, till King Agis his time, in whose reign gold, and silver began to be
in request, and so pride, covetousness, and curiosity crept in, which by
degrees wrought their ruin. Plut.

Numa Pompilius the first Lawgiver amongst the Romans, gave out that he
conversed in the woods with the goodesse Egeria, that so he might procure the
greater esteem to himself, and to the Laws which he enacted. Plut.

Solon the Lawgiver to the Athenians collecting, and Anacharsis, a very wise
man, laughed at him, saying, Think thou by written Laws to bridle the
covetousness, and injustice of men? Know thou not that Laws are like
cobwebs that catch little flies, but the rich, and mighty will break through
them at their pleasure. Plut.

Draco that first gave Laws to the Athenians, punished his Laws were said to
be written in blood. But when Solon reformed them, he made them more mild, and
moderate. Plut.

Darius going to war against the Scythians, would Deobaces one of his Noble
men that was very old: whereupon Deobaces requested him to leave one of his
sons at home to be a solace to his old age: Yea, said Darius, I will leave
them all three, and so he caused them to be all slain, and thrown into their
fathers presence. Pez. Mel Hist.

The Lacedaemonians having in diverse battles by sea, Athenians, they at last set
thirty Tyrants over them, which exercised extreme cruelty toward them. The
honest Citizens whom they either feared, or hated, or that excelled in wealth,
they either banished, or slew them, and Teized upon their estates. Whereupon
one of them (somewhat better then the rest) called Theramenes spoke against
this cruelty, which caused another called Critias to accuse him of treason, and
so to condemn him to death. Theramenes hearing it, fled to the Altar, saying,
I fly to this Altar, not that I think it will save my life, but that I may
show that these Tyrants are not only cruel toward men, but profane, and
wicked toward the gods: Critias commanded armed men to fetch him away to his
death: and as they led him through the City, he cried out against the Tyrants
cruelty, whereupon one of their Captains said to him: Flebis si non silebis:
Thou shall weep if thou wile not hold thy peace, to whom he answered, Annon
fleba, si tacebo? Shall I not weep if I do hold my peace? when they put the cup
of poison into his hand, he drank it off, and throwing away the bottom he
said, I drink this to fair Critias. After his death they raged more extremely,
filling all places with rapines, and slaughter; and not suffering the friends
of the murdered to interre their dead bodies. Having amongst others slain one
Phidon, they at their feast sent for his daughters to come, and dance naked
upon the floor that was defiled with their fathers blood, but the maids
abominating such immanity, threw themselves down from an high place, and brake
their necks. And to fill up the measure of the Athenians miseries, whereas many
thousands of them were ^led, or banished into all the neighboring countries of
Greece, their proud insulting adversaries, the Lacedaemonians forbade all
persons to entertain any of these miserable exiles, but to return them to the
Tyrants again, and that upon the pain of forfeitting three thousand crowns.
Diod. Sic.

Lysander King of Sparta, when the Argives came to Lacedemon to dispute about
the borders of their country, pleading that they had ajuster cause then the
Lacedaemonians, he drew his sword and said, They that can hold this best, can
best dispute about their coasts. Xenoph.

Alexander the Tyrant of Thessaly was of such a cruel Polyphron, and then
consecrated the spear wherewith he did it to the gods: But not long after
himself was slain by the conspiracy of his own wife. Plut.

Euphron the Lacedemonian having made himself a Cicyon, was shortly after
murdered by the Senators as he sat in counsel with them, who defended
themselves by this Apology: quod qui manifesti sceleris proditionis, and
tyrannidis rei sunt, non sententia aliqua dammandi videantur, sed ab omnibus
hominibus jam ante dammati sunt, and quod nulla Graecorum lex ostendi possit,
quae proditionibus, aut Tyrannis securitatem praestet. That those which are
guilty of Treason, and Tyranny, need not to be proceeded against in a legal
way, for that they are beforehand condemned in all men's judgments, neither was
there any law amongst the Grecians that gave security to traitors, and
Tyrants. Plut

Ochus King of Persia succeeding his father Artaxe^xes Mnemon, presently after
his getting the Kingdom, filled, and defiled all his palace with blood,
murdered all the Princes and Royal seed, without any respect of age, or sex:
and yet through Gods patience, he lived ninety three years, and reigned forty
three years. Diod. Sic. But in the end growing odious, and burdensome to all
by reason of his bloodshed, and cruelty, one of his Eunuchs called Bagoas
poisoned him, and threw his dead body to be devoured of cats, AElian. Lib. 6.

Alexander M. after his great victories grew proud, Philotas, one of his brave
captains, the son of Parmenio, who had a chief hand in all his victories,
and after grievous torments, caused him to be slain, and not content
therewith, thinking that his father might seek to revenge the wrong, he caused
him to be murdered also. Qu. Cur. See Alexander M. also in Anger.

Alexander M. as he was rowing upon a lake in his Babylon, a sudden tempest
arising, blew off his hat, and crown fastened upon it into the lake, whereupon
one of his Mariners leaping into the lake, swam, and fetched it to him, and to
keep it the drier he put it upon his own head, Alexander rewarded him with a
talent, for saving his Crown, but withal caused his head to be cut off, for
presuming to put his Crown upon it. Plut.

Dionysius the Sicillian Tyrant, was so suspicious of Sir, you have now put
your life into his hands, at which the boy smiled: whereupon Dionysius caused
them both to be slain, the man for teaching the boy how to kill him, and the
boy for laughing at it. There was one Damocles, a great slatterer of his, who
told him what an happy man he was that did so abound in riches, Majesty, Power,
etc. affirming that there was never any man more happy then himself: Well,
said Dionysius, will thou, O Damocles, try how happy a man I am, seeing thou
do so admire my condition? Yea, said Damocles, with all my heart: Hereupon
Dionysius caused him to be clothed in Kingly apparel, to be set upon a golden
seat, in a room richly hung, and curiously adorned with pictures, then a table
to be furnished with all sorts of dainty dishes, with a company of beautiful
boys to wait upon him. He had also precious ointments, Crowns, music, and
what not? So that Domacles thought himself a woundro^s happy man: But
presently Dionysius caused a sharp glittering sword, tied in an horse-haire to
be hung just over his head, the terror whereof so afflicted Damocles, lest it
should fall on his head, that he durst not stir, nor enjoy any of those
felicities, whereupon he sent to the Tyrant, desiring him to give him leave to
go away, for he desired that happiness no longer. Citero.

Antiochus Epiphanes, warring against Egypt, Ptolomy Egypt sent to the Senate
at Rome to make them his Guardians, and to desire their help against Antiochus:
Hereupon the Senate sent Popilius to Antiochus requiring him to forbear meddling
with Egypt, or if he was already entered, presently to depart out of it.
Antiochus offered to kiss Popilius, in token of his love to him, but Popilius
answered, Let all private friendship cease, till thou have answered my public
Commands. Antiochus told him that he would consult with his friends, and
shortly return an answer. Popilius having a stick in his hand, drew with it a
circle about him, and his friends, requiring them to return an answer, and
either to choose war or peace before they went out of that circle. This so
daunted the King, that he told him he would obey the command of the Senate.

the Persian was by him condemned to be burnt: and when he was laid upon the
Pile of wood, he cried out, O Solon, Solon, Solon: which being told to Cyrus,
he sent for him to know what he meant by it: Croesus answered, that having once
entertained wise Solon into his house: he told him that no man ought to be
accounted happy so long as he lived: which, said he, I never understood till
now. Cyrus laying this to heart, and considering the mutability of all earthly
things, did not only give him his life, but made him his friend, and chief
Counselor in all his affairs. Herod.

Not long after Cyrus being to make war against Massages, Croesus dissuaded
him from it, saying, (...) mea sunt (...), If thou were immortal thy self, and
had an Army of immortal soldiers thou need not my counsel, but seeing
thou art mortal thy self, and the like are thy soldiers, consider that all
humane affairs are like a wheel: that spoke that is up to day may be down to
morrow, and think not that thou will always be fortunate: but Cyrus not taking
his advice went against them, where himself with twenty thousand of his
soldiers were slain. Justi.

Xerxes which a little before had led an Army of above a million of men into
Greece, wherewith he thought himself able to conquer the whole world, within a
little space saw his Navy destroyed on the sea, and multitudes of his soldiers
by an handful of the Grecians slain upon the land, and himself in great fear
accompanied with some few servants fled back to get into Asia again; but when
he came to the Hellespont, he found his great bridge, over which he should have
passed, broken with a tempest: so that he was forced to enter into a poor
fisher boat, in which with much danger h^gat into Asia: For being encountered
with a great storm, in great fear he asked the Pilot if there were any hope of
safety? No Sir, said he, except the boat be eased of some of the passengers:
whereupon Xerxes cried out, O ye Persians, now I shall see whether you have any
care of the safety of your King or no? for in you it lies to save, or to
destroy my life: which when they heard, some of them leaped overboard, and
drowned themselves to preserve their King: But like a Tyrant, when he came to
land, he gave the Pilot a Crown of gold for saving his life, but because he
had drowned some of his servants, he caused his head to be ^ut off. Herod.

After the battle of Plataea, wherein the Grecians had Xerxes: Pausanias King
of Sparta being the Grecian General was exceedingly elated with the glory of
that victory, and afterward at a feast in a scorneful manner he bade Simonides
a wise man, to give him some wholesome counsel; Simonides answered: Take heed
of forgetting that thou were but a mortal man, which though he laughed at for
the present, yet shortly after he remembered it, when being immured in Pallas's
Temple, he was pined to death. Plut. See it in Treachery.

Solon told Croesus that considering how the life of man is subject to infinite
changes, wisdom therefore forbids us to trust, or glory in worldly riches
honors, or any outward things, or to account any man happy before his death.
And therefore, said he, I account Tellus a happier man then thy self in the
midst of all thy affluence; for he being a Citizen of Athens was a very
honest man, and left his children in good esteem: and himself died honorably
in the field, fighting in the defense of his country. Plut.

Artaxeroees Mnemon in that great battle which he Cyrus, being wounded in the
breast by Cyrus, retired out of the battle, and at night the weather being hot,
he was extreme thirsty, and could get nothing to drink; whereupon his Eunuchs
ran up, and down to seek him some water, and at last they met with a poor
fellow that had gotten some stinking puddle water in a fi^thy vessel, this they
took and carried to the King, who drank it all off, and when one of them asked
him whether that filthy water did not offend him? he swore that he never drank
such a sweet draught either of wine or water in his life before; and therefore
he prayed the gods that if he could not reward the poor man that brought it,
yet that they would make him both blessed, and rich for his labor. Plut.

Alexander M. having overcome Darius, went to Babylon where he had the City,
and Castle delivered up to him, and there in infinite treasures: from thence he
went to Susa, which being also surrendered to him, he found there fifty thousand
Talents in bullion, and such abundance of riches as the Persian Kings had for a
long time heaped up together, leaving it from father to son, all which in one
hour came into his hands that never cared for it. From thence he went to
Persepolis which had in it a far greater Mass of treasure, it being the
richest City then under the Sun: there he found one hundred and twenty
thousand Talents of money, and as much other treasures as twenty thousand
Mules, and ten thousand Camels could carry away, much whereof had been reserved
there from Cyrus his time; Alexander setting himself down in the Kings throne
it was so high that his feet could not reach the ground, whereupon one brough a
little table; and set under his feet: and one of Darius his Eunuchs standing
by, sighed and weeped grievously, which Alexander taking notice of, asked him
what was the cause of it? to whom the Eunuch answered, I weep to see that table
that was so highly prized by my Master Darius, to be now made thy footstool.

This Darius flying out of the battle, who a little Alexander pursued, and was
now come near to them, these villains, Bessus, Artabazus, and others took
Darius, wounded him in many places, and wounded the beasts that drew him, and
so fled themselves into Bactria: In the mean time the beasts that drew Darius
being weary, hot, and wounded, turned out of the way into a certain valley,
whither one of Alexanders men called Polystratus coming to seek for water, as
he was drinking out of his helmet, he spied the wagon and mangled beasts, and
going, and looking into it, he spied a man half dead with many wounds: Darius
lifting up his eyes, and seeing him, said, This comfort I have in my present
fortune, that I shall breath out my last words to one that can understand them:
therefore, says he, I pray thee tell Alexander that though I never deserved
any favor at his hands, yet I shall die his debtour: giving him many thanks
for his kindness to my mother, wife, and children. Tell him that as he has
showed favor to them, so on the contrary my servants, and kinsmen that
received their lives, and livelihood from me, have basely betrayed, and
murdered me. Tell him that I pray that he may Conquer all the World, and
desire him to revenge this wickedness both for his own, and for the sake of
all Kings, it being of evil example that such treachery should go unpunished:
and so fainting he desired a little water, which when he had drunk, he said to
Polystratus: Whosoever thou art that have showed me this kindness in my
extreme misery, the gods requite thee for so great a benefit, and the gods
requite Alexander also for all his humanity, and clemency: and so he gave up
the ghost. Quin. Cur.

Alexander M. after all his great conquests returning Babylon, had Ambassadors
that came to him almost from all Countries, some to congratulate his victories,
others to tender their homage, all bringing great and rich presents: but
whilst in the midst of his glory he was feasting of them, he caught a surfeit
with inordinate drinking, which turned to a mortal feavour; and a little before
his death being asked by his friends, to whom he would leave his Kingdom? he
answered, To the most worthy man; and he being asked, When they should do
Divine honors to him? he answered, When they themselves were happy, which were
his last words, and so he died, having lived not thirty three years, nor
reigned thirteen, and as soon as he was dead, his great Captains sought to
enrich themselves by his spoils, and whilst they were contonding to share the
world amongst them, his dead body lay many days in that hot Country unburied,
stinking above ground, a notable Emblem of the vanity of all earthly
greatness. Plut. Qu. Cur. Besides this his vast Empire was divided amongst his
great Captains, to Ptolomaeus Lagi was allotted Egypt, and Africa: To
Lao^^don, Syria, and Phoenicia: To Philotas, Cilicia: To Python, Media: To
Eumenes, Paphlagonia and Cappadocia: To Antigonus, Pamphilia, Lycia, and
Phrygia the great: To Cassander, Caria: To Menander, Lydia: To Leonatus,
Phrygia the less: To Lysimachus, Thracia, with the neighboring Countries. To
Antipater, Macedonia, and the neighboring Nations. But these men not contented
with their shares, fell presently to wars amongst themselves: Perdiccas
warring upon Egypt was slain by his own soldiers. Antipater died. Eumenes was
betrayed by his own soldiers, and slain by Antigonus. Python was
treacherously slain by Antigonus. Olympias the mother of Alexander, was slain
by Cassander. Cleopatra sister to Alexander, was slain by the treachery of
Antigonus. Antigonus himself was slain in battle by Cassander, and
Lysimachus. Rhoxane the beloved wife of Alexander, together with her son
Alexander and Barsine another of his wives, which was the daughter of Darius,
were all slain by Cassander. Presently after the whole family of Cassander was
rooted out. Ptolomaeus died in Egypt. Lysimachus was slain by Seleucus. And
Seleucus himself presently after by Ptolomaeus. So that all the family of
Alexander within a few years after his death, was wholly extirpated: And all
his friends and great Captains by their mutual contentions came most of them
to untimely ends. Diod. Si^. Justin.

Pempey the Great, who had been three times Consul of Rome, and had three times
triumphed after his famous victories, and was exalted to that height of honor,
that the world could afford no greater, yet being overcome by Caesar in the
Pharsalian plains, he was forced to fly into Egypt in a little fisher-boat,
where he had deserved well of the King Ptolomy, and therefore expected all
kind entertainment: but the King on the contrary, hearing of his coming, sent
out some to meet him at the Seaside, who treacherously cut off his head, and
so he whom the world a little before could not contain, now wanted a grave for
his burial, so that Caesar pursuing him, when three days after he found him
lying on the sand, could not forbear weeping. Plut.

The same Caesar also after all his great victories, being Plut.

Nero who a little before wallowed in all manner of Phaon his freed-man:
Epaphroditus Master of requests: Sporus his male-concubine, and Neophitus. When
he came to a place of safety (as he thought) he was feign like a beast to creep
on all four, through under woods, and briars to hide himself, in such extreme
want of all things, that for quenching his thirst, he was driven to lade water
with his hand, out of a dirty plash, saying, This is Nero's Beverege. But those
men who were sent after him for his execution, were outstripped by swifter
means, which warned him of the nearness, and inevitableness of his
approaching danger: for the Senate had proclaimed him the public enemy, and to
die More majorum, or after the ancient manner, which was this: to have his body
stripped stark naked, his hands fast bo^nd behind him, his head stockt under a
fork, and so in open view to be whipped to death with rods. Nero hereupon after
many timorous delays, and abject lamentations, puts a poinard to his throat,
which Epaphroditus did help to drive home, lest he should fall alive into his
enemies hands. Suet* Pliny. Thus was Nero's voice, and fiddling marred, and
his last words were: O what an artist I die! Dio.

Sultan Saladine Emperor of the Turks, lying upon Anno Christi 1193. commanded
that no solemnity should be used at his burial, but only his shirt in manner of
an ensign, fastened upon the point of a spear to be carried before his dead
body, a simple Priest going before and crying aloud to the people in this sort:
Saladine Conqueror of the East, of all the greatness, and riches that he had
in this life, carried nothing away with him but his shirt. Hoveden. And poor
Eumenes of a Potters son,
By fickle Fortunes help a Kingdom won:
But she for him such diet did provide,
That he of hunger shortly after died.


Mahomet the Great, the first Emperor of the Turks, after the winning of
Constantinople fell in love with a most Beautiful Greekish Lady, called Irene,
upon whose rare perfections he so much doated, that he gave himself wholly over
to her love: But when he heard that his Captains, and Officers murmured at it:
he appointed them all to attend him in his great Hall, and commanding Irene to
dress, and adorn her self in all her gorgeous appare^, he brought her in his
hand into the midst of them, who seeing her incomparable perfections
acknowledged their error, saying, That their Emperor had just cause to pass
his time in sol^cing himself with such a peerless Paragon: But he on a sudden
caught her by the hair with one of his hands, and with the other drawing his
Fauchion, at one blow struck off her head, thereby showing them that he was not
such a slave to his affections, but that he preferred his honor before them.
Turk. Hist.

Gillimer King of the Vandals in Africa having lived Billisarius, and having
lost the greatest part of his Army, with a few of his servants was forced to
fly into a high, and inaccessible mountain for refuge, where being besieged
by one of Billisarius his Captains he was brought to such straits, that he
sent to a special friend requesting him to send him a Sponge, an Harp, and a
Loaf of bread: A Sponge to dry up his tears: an Harp to solace him in his
sorrows, and a Loaf of bread to satisfy his hunger. Pez. Mel. Hist.

The Caliph of Babylon (being taken together with Haalon the Tartarian,) was by
him shut up in the midst of his infinite treasure, which he, and his
predecessors had with much care and pains scraped togeher, who bade him take,
and eat what he pleased of gold and silver, or precious stones: for (said he)
it is fit that so gaineful a guest should be fed with the best, and therefore
make no spare of any thing. The miserable caitiffe being so kept for certain
days, died of hunger in the midst of those things whereof he thought that he
should never have had enough, and whereby he thought to have secured himself
against any dearth, or danger. Turk. Hist.

The Heathenish Romans had for a difference in their

No sooner had the soul of that victorious Prince William the Conqueror left
his body, but that his dead Corpse was abandoned by all his Nobles, and
followers: and by his meaner servants, he was dispoiled of Armor, Vessels,
Apparel, and all Princely furniture, and his naked body left upon the floor,
his Funeral wholly neglected, till one Harluins, a poor country Knight,
undertook the carriage of his Corpse to Caen in Normandy to Saint Stevens
Church, which this dead King had formerly founded: At his entrance into Caen,
the Covent of Monks came forth to meet him, but at the same instant, there
happened a great fire, so that, as his Corpse before, so now his Hearse was of
all men forsaken, every one running to quench the fire; which done, his body
being at last carried to the Church, and the Funeral Sermon ended, and the
stone Coffin set into the earth in the Chancel, as the body was ready to be
laid therein, one Ascelinus Fitz-Arthur, stood up and forb^de the burial,
alleging that that very place was the floor of his fathers house, which this
dead Duke violently took from him to build this Church upon: Therefore (says
he) I challenge this ground, and in the Name of God forbid that the body of
this dispoiler be covered in my earth: so that they were enforced to compound
with him for one hundred pounds: But when the body came to be laid in the
Tomb, it proved too little for it, so that being pressed, the belly, not
bowelled, brake and with an intolerable stench so annoyed the bystanders, that
all their Gums, and spices ^uming in their Censers could not relieve them,
whereupon all with great amazement hasting away, left the Monks only to shuffle
up the burial, which they did in haste, and so gat them to their Cells. Speeds

Cicero hearing of it, fled to Cajetta, and there taking ship intended to
escape, but was often driven back with the winds, so that at last he said,
Moriar in patria saepe serva^a; I will die in my country which I have often
saved: yet when his servants heard that the murderers approached they perforce

WE have (says Camerarius) in Noremberg a young

Platerus mentions one deaf, and dumb born, yet O^colampadius preaching by the
motions of his lips, and gesture understood many things.

One Gennet Lowes a Scottish woman dwelling in Edenburg, being deaf, and dumb
by nature, could understand any one in her house, merely by the moving of their
lips: so that by their motions alone without a voice, she could exactly know
their meaning.

Master Crisp, brother to Sir Nicholas Crisp, his dexterity Alexander Carey was
beheaded at Tower Hill, this Master Crisp (having been deaf long before)
pressed to stand near to the Scaffold, whereupon Master Hurst, an officer in
the train-bands that kept the guard spoke to him to forbear, who not hearing
him, continued to labor to get a convenient place, till Master Hurst being
told by some who he was, suffered him to place himself right against the front
of the Scaffold, and when Sir Alexander turned himself to speak to the people,
Master* Crisp fixed his eyes upon his lips, during all the time of his speech,
which he so perfectly understood, and carried away, that relating it to his
friends, they much wondered at the way of his perception.

There was a Nobleman in Spain, the younger brother Castile, born so deaf
that he could not hear a gun shot off by his ear, and consequently dumb: yet
the lovlinesse of his face, and exceeding vivacity of his eyes, the comeliness
of his person, and the whole composure of his body, were pregnant signs of a
well tempered mind: Physicians and Chyrurgions had long employed their skill
to help him, but all in vain: At last a certain Priest undertook to teach him
to understand others when they spoke, and to speak himself that others might
understand him: This attempt was at first laughed at: but after some years
with great pains he taught this young Lord to speak as distinctly as any man,
and to understand so perfectly what others said, that he could understandingly
converse all day with them. Prince Charles when he was wooing the Infanta of
Spain, saw him, and often made trial of him, not only with English words, but
making some Welchmen in his train to speak words of their language, all which
he perfectly repeated, only for want of his hearing, his tone was rather
vehement, and shrill, then pleasing. This many were witnesses of.

Pausanias reports that one Balthus a dumb man, wandering in a desert, met with
a Lion, and was struck with such exceeding fear, and trepidation that thereupon
the strings of his tongue were loosed, and he spoke ever after.

Other Examples: Aristides is an admirable example Phlutarch writes that amidst
all the changes which befell the Athenians in his time, he remained always the
same; for honors never puffed him up with pride, nor adversity never made him
impatient: For when AEschylus the Poet in the public Amphytheater made verses
in his commendation, and thereupon the eyes of all the people were fixed upon
him, he was nothing affected, or puffed up with it: neither at other times was
he afflicted at the reproaches, and indignities of his enemies: He used to say,
That it was the part of a good Citizen, only to rejoice in his good speeches,
and actions. Plut.

Nero being weary of his wife Octavia the daughter Claudius, by whom he had the
Empire, charged her with adultery, and Pythias one of her women, was miserably
tormented upon the rack, to extort a confession against her imperial Lady, but
she left this memorable Example of loyal constancy: Tigellinus, Nero's
instrument of cruelty, sitting in Commission at the rack, demanded of her some
immodest* questions about her Lady Octavia: But she being raised above fear, or
pain by honest courage, did spit into his face, saying, that Octavia was
honester in her woman's parts, then his mouth. Suet.

Phocion the Athenian was semper idem* always the Pray you be quiet, I am the
man whom ye seek, for there are none of your doings that please me: Athens was
at this time in her dotage. Afterward being chosen Captain of the Athenians
against the Macedonians: he seeing that his cowardly soldiers were only
valiant in their tongues, wisely forbore fighting, and made a peace: afterward
being upbraided, as if he had done it through cowardice, he answered: You are
happy that you had a Captain that knew you well enough, otherwise you had all
perished before this. At another time, when Demosthenes that rode the people by
his flattery, told Phocion, that the Athenians would kill him, when they began
to be mad. But, said Phocion, they will kill thee, when they begin to be wise.
Lipsius.

Saint Ambrose Bishop of Millaine being besieged in Valentinian junior, at the
instigation of Justina his mother, an Arian, the Emperor commanded him to come
forth of the Church, intending* to deliver it to the Arians: But Ambrose told
him that he would never come out of it willingly, neither would betray his
sheepfold to the wolvs, nor his Church to such as were blasphemers of God;
Therefore (says he) if thou will kill me, come in, and thrust me through,
either with thy sword, or spear, which death will be very grateful unto me.

Majesty's favor: For a crime committed against his Majesty, is far greater
then disobedience to you. Niceph.

Pomponius a Knight of Rome fighting in the Army Lucullus against Mithridates

C. Mevius a Captain of Augustus Caesar's, having Mark Anthony, was at last

knowledge of Christ: Hereupon Wolfranius pulled his foot out of the Font,
saying, I also will then go to hell where my predecessors are, choosing rather
to be in that place where are most, then where are fewest. Fulgos.

flatterers, himself practiced it in a shameful manner toward the Queens, and
Freedmen: whilst he inveighed against riches, and rich men, he heaped together
infinite riches by usury, and unjust dealings: And whilst he condemned Luxury
in others, himself had five hundred costly chaires made of Cedar, their feet of
Ivory, and all other things answerable. Xiphil. in vita Neromis.

CHAP. LXII. Examples of such as have preferred Christ, before all earthly
enjoyments.
Under the eight Persecution there was one Marinus, Caesaria who stood for an
honorable office that of right fell to him; but his Competitor to prevent him,
accused him to the Judge for being a Christian: The Judge examining him of his
faith, and finding it true, gave him three hours time to deliberate with
himself whether he would lose his Office, and Life, or renounce Christ, and
his profession: Marinus being much perplexed what to resolve on, a godly Bishop
took him by the hand, led him into the Church, laid before him a sword, and a
New Testament, bidding him freely take his choice which of them he would have,
whereupon Marinus ran to the New Testament, and chose that, and so being
encouraged by the Bishop, he went boldly to the Judge, by whose sentence he was
beheaded.

Dioclesian that bloody Persecutor, first labored to That they were not only
ready to lay down their honors, and weapons, but even their lives, if he
required it, rather then to sin against God, and deny Christ.

A Noble Virgin in Portugal called Eulalia, under What a shame is it for you,
thus wickedly to seek to kill men's souls, and to break their bodies in pieces,
seeking thereby to withdraw them from Christ? Would you know what I am? I am a
Christian, ana an enemy to your devilish sacrifices, I spurn your idols under
my feet, etc. Hereupon the Judge being enraged, said unto her: O fond, and
sturdy girl, I would feign have thee before thou die revoke thy wickedness:
Remember the Honorable House of which thou art come, and thy friends tears:
Will thou cast away thy self in the flower of thy youth? Will thou bereave thy
self of honorable marriage? Does the glittering pomp of the bride-bed nothing
prevail with thee? etc. Behold, if these things will not move thee, I have
here variety of engines prepared to put thee to a cruel death, etc. But our
Noble Eulalia having her heart ravished with the love of Christ, to whom she
desired to be married, rejected both his flatteries, and threats, and chose
death, rather then to forsake Christ. See my General Martyrology. p. 77.

In the late Bohemian Persecution a noble Lady of Latium, leaving all her
riches, house, and friends, crept under the walls through the common sewer (the
gates being guarded) that she might enjoy Christ in his Ordinances elsewhere.

In the Affrican Persecution under the Arians there Saturus, eminent for piety,
and holiness, whom the Tyrant King labored to withdraw from Christ, and his
truth, to the Arian Heresy, telling him, that if he consented not presently,
he should forfeit his house, his Lands, his goods, his honors, that his
children and servants should be sold, that his wife should be given to one of
his basest slaves, etc. But when threats prevailed not, he was cast into
prison, and when his Lady heard her doom, she went to him with her garments
rent, and her hair disheveled, her children at her heels, and a sucking infant
in her arms, and falling down at her husbands feet, she took him about the
knees, saying, Have compassion (O my sweetest) of me thy poor wife, and of
these thy children, look upon them; let them not be made slaves; let not me be
yoaked in so base a marriage: consider that which thou art required to do, thou
do it not willingly, but art constrained thereto, and therefore it will not
be laid to thy charge, etc. But this valiant Soldier of Christ answered her in
the words of Job: Thou speak like a foolish woman; Thou actest the Devils
part: If thou truly lovedst thy husband, thou would never seek to draw him
to sin that may separate him from Christ, and expose him to the second death:
Know assuredly, that I am resolved (as my Savior Christ commands me) to
forsake wife, children, house, lands, etc. that so I may enjoy him which is
best of all.

One Copin a Merchant in France was apprehended, Ast for his bold asserting of
the truth, to whom the B. said, that he must either recant his opinions, or be
punished: But Copin answered, that he would maintain them with his life: For,
says he, I have goods, a wife, and children, and yet have I lost those
affections which I formerly bore to them, neither are they dear to me, so I may
gain Christ.

Anno Christi 1620. in that bloody Persecution Valtoline, a noble Gentleman

and embrace Popery; whereupon he said, God forbid, that to save this temporal
life, I should deny my Lord Jesus Christ, who with his precious blood upon the
Cross redeemed me at so dear a rate, etc. I say, God forbid; and so they
murdered him. See my Genesis Martyrologie, p. 327.

Anno Christi 1507. one Laurence Guest being in Salisbury, the Bishop (because
he had good friends) labored by all means to draw him to recant: but not
prevailing he condemned him; yet when he was at the stake, he sent his wife,
and seven children to him, hoping by that means to work upon him: but through
Gods grace, Religion overcame nature, and when his wife entreated him with
tears to favor himself, he answered, Be not a block in my way, for I am in a
good course, and running toward the mark of my salvation: and so he patiently
suffered Martyrdom:

In Q Mary's days one Steven Knight, Martyr, O Lord Jesus Christ, for the love
of whom I willingly leave this life, and rather desire the bitter death of thy
Cross, with the loss of all earthly goods, then to obey men in breaking thy
holy Commandments: Thou see, O Lord, that whereas I might live in worldly
wealth, if I would worship a false god: I rather choose the torments of my
body, and loss of my life, counting all things but dung and dross that I
might win thee, for whose sake death is dearer unto me then thousands of gold
and silver, etc. See my Eng. Martyrologie. p. 132.

Nicholas Sheterden, Martyr, when he was ready Lord, thou know that if I

Laws, lo, I willingly leave all the pleasures of this life, for the hopes sake
of eternal life, etc. Idem. p. 146.

Richard Woodman, Martyr, when he was brought I love my wife, and children in

sakes for sake Christ. Idem. p. 185.

A poor woman in Cornwall being admonished by I have them, and I have them not;

should have pardon whatsoever his offense was: so whosoever goes to God the
Father with Christ in his arms, shall be sure to speed in his request.

grievous asseverations protested that he had never seen her but once, and then
never offered the least indignity to her: Darius lifting up his hands to heaven

In the reign of Q. Mary there was one Ralph Allerton who coming into the
Church of Bently in Essex, finding the people idle, or ill employed, read a
Chapter to them, and prayed with them, for which being brought before Bonner,
he by his subtle persuasions, and flatteries so prevailed with him that he
drew him to a recantation, after which this Allerton was brought into such
bondage, and terrors of conscience, and was so cast down that if the Lord had
not looked mercifully upon him he had been utterly undone; but, through Gods
goodness, upon his unseigned repentance he at last recovered comfort, and gave
his life for the cause of Christ. See my Eng. Manyrologie. p. 193.

About the same time there was one Mr. Whittle, Essex Minister, who being also
called before Bonner, by the subtle practices of the B. and the advice of some
carnal friends set his hand to a recantation; but presently after he fell into
grievous terrors of conscience whereof himself thus writes: After (says he) I
had done this thing, I had little joy of any thing, my conscience telling me
that I had done very ill by so slight a means to shake off the sweet Cross of
Christ. Yea, his terrors of conscience were so great that he could not sleep;
whereupon he procured the writing, and to are out his name: After which he thus
writes, Being condemned to die my conscience, and mind, I praise God, is quiet
in Christ, and I by his grace, am very willing, and content to give over this
body to death for the testimony of Christ's truth, and pure religion against
Antichrist, etc. Idem. p. 160, 161.

Before this in the reign of King Henry the 8 th. Thomas Bilney for fear of
Death was drawn to an Abjuration, after which he fell into such terrors of
conscience that he was near the point of utter despair, so that his friends
were fain to watch with him night, and day, endeavoring to comfort him, but
all in vain: In this woeful condition he continued for the space of a whole
year, and was in such anguish that neither eating, drinking, sleeping, nor any
thing else did him good: yea, he thought that all the Word of God was against
him, and sounded his condemnation: But at last, resolving through Gods Grace,
to lay down his life for* the truth, he began to feel some comfort, etc. See

theirs caused such a rent in the Church, that it did more hurt then an open

stood, and now were ready to scale the walls, and to set upon the sleeping
watch, for neither man nor dog heard them: but it fell out that there were some
holy geese kept in Juno's Temple, which hearing the Gauls began to run upon

Capitol. Plut.

Agathocles had for his Father a Potter, himself Syracuse, but was repelled:

murdered the Princes, and people: then passing with his Army into Africa he
makes war with the Carthaginians, that had helped him to the Kingdom: and
strangely prevails in many Battles, yet at last was beaten, forsaken by his

Wife, and Children from him, and slew Agathocles. Lipsius.

Leontius the Athenian Philosopher had a daughter Athenais, who was very
beautiful and witty: and therefore the old man on his deathbed divided his
estate amongst his Sons, leaving her only a small Legacy: Hereupon she went to
Law with her Brothers hoping to recover more of them, but being overthrown in
the suit, she went to Constantinople; there she insinuated her self into the
acquaintance of Pulcheria the Emperors Sister, who enquiring whether she was a
Virgin, brought her into the Court, caused her to be instructed in the
Principles of Christianity, and Baptized, giving her the name of Eudocia: and
took such a liking to her, that she prevailed with her brother Theodosius to
take her to wife: long she continued in that happy condition; but at length
fell into suspicion upon this occasion: One presented the Emperor Theodosius
with an apple of an extraordinary greatness, which for the rarity of it he
sent to his wife Eudocia: she presently gave it to Paulinus, a facetious, and
learned man: he knowing nothing whence it came, again presented it to the
Emperor; the Emperor marking it well, knew that it was the same which he had
sent to his wife: hereupon he goes to her, and asks her for the apple he sent
her, she rashly affirms, that she had eaten it: he asks again more earnestly,
and she affirms the same with an oath: Then the Emperor being very angry
produces the apple; and suspecting that Paulinus was too familiar with his
wife, he causes him to be slain; and divorceth his wife: she hereupon went to
Jerusalem where she led the remainder of her life holily, and chastely. Lipsius.

Dion with a great courage but a small Army, went Sicily to free Syracuse from

being left his substitute in Syracuse, presently dispatches away a messenger to
Dionysius to assure him of Dion's coming, and therefore to request him, (all
other businesses being set aside) to hasten his return: the messenger in his
journey met with a friend who had been offering sacrifice, and gave him a piece
of the flesh, which he put into his budget where the Letters to Dionysius were,
and not long after being weary, laid him down on the grass to sleep; presently
came a Wolf* and smelling the meat, snatched up the budget, and ran away with
it: the man awakens, and mis^ing his budget, durst not go to Dionysius, but
turns another way: By this means Dion had opportunity to get Syracuse, and
Dionysius lost his Kingdom. Lipsius.

them where he was; whereupon they accompany Titinnius to Cassius to acquaint
him with the good news: Cassius seeing them coming, and suspecting them to be
enemies, and Brutus to be overthrown, causes his freeman to cut his throat;
Titinnius finding him dead through his default, he cuts his own throat also:
Brutus hearing of these sad accidents (with Cassius) loses his courage, and
victory. Justin.

Hanibal after the Victory at Cannae domineered in Italy at his pleasure,
nothing remained but the taking of Rome to complete his work: about that time
he enters into confederacy with Philip King of Macedon; upon condition that the
Carthaginians should enjoy Italy, and should help Philip to subdue Greece: For
the confirming of this Treaty Philip sends Xenophanes his Ambassador to
Hanibal: but he comes upon the Coast of Italy near Tarentum, and falls in
amongst the Roman Navy, where being examined what he was, and whither he went?
he cunningly feignes that he was sent from King Philip to the Roman Senate to
enter into a league with them against Hanibal: the Romans rejoice exceedingly
at this good news, expecting help in their low condition from so potent a
King, and so land Xenophanes, who presently travels to Hanibal, and dispatches
his business, and so returns: but again meets with the Roman Navy, which was
commanded by Q. Fulvius: he again examines Xenophanes; who tells him that he
had been with the Senate at Rome, and had concluded a League betwixt Philip and
them, against Hanibal: Fulvius believes him, and was about to dismiss him, but
spying some in his train in African habits, he examines what they were, and
growing suspicious, finds out the truth, casts them into bonds, sends them to
Rome: by which means the City was saved. Lipsius. Ludit in humanis divina
potentia rebus.

When Philip King of Macedonia heard so much viz. That Parmenio his General had
obtained a notable victory over his enemies: That Alexander his son was born:
And that his Chariots had won the prize at the Olympic games, all in one
day, he called upon Fortune to spice his joys with some bitterness, lest he
should surfeit of them, and forget himself.

Diagoras having seen his three sons crowned with Olympic Games, One came
running to him with this Gratulation, Morere Diagoras, non enim in coelum
ascensurus^es: As if he could have enjoyed no greater happiness on earth, then

and children left therein, and those feeding on man's flesh, the Parents
requiring of their children that life which not long before they gave them, and

living Sepulchers of their scarce dead Parents: The stronger preyed upon the
weaker: and if the Famine had left on them nothing but skin and bones for those
hungry raveners, they ripped up their bellies and devoured their inward parts,
and breaking the skull, sucked out their brains raw. Yea, the weaker sex was by

ANno Christi 1228. in a Synod held by the Popish Paris in France, there was
one appointed to make a Sermon, who as he was walking abroad, and meditating
upon what subject to preach, the Devil appeared to him, asking him what he
needed to be so solicitous about that matter: Say (says he) in thy Sermon, The
Princes of hell salute you, O ye Princes of the Church, and gladly give you
thanks, for that through your default, and negligence it comes to pass, that
so many souls come down to hell. Adding, that he was enforced by God to
declare the same: Yea, and he gave this Priest a certain token, whereby the
Synod might evidently see that he did not lie.

On a time as Luther was walking in his garden, Luther sleighting, and not
regarding him, he vanished away.

See his Life in my first Part.

Luther tells us, that when he was lodged in Wartzhurg in a Chamber far from
any company, he was many times molested by noises made by the Devil in his
Chamber, and on his stairs: but I (says he) encountered him with that
sentence, Omnia subjecisti pedibus ejus, Thou have put all things in subjection
under his feet: and so I laid me down, and slept in safety. Collo. Men's.

Another of the German Divines in Luther's time The Son of God came to dissolve
the works of the Devil: and so holding up that paper to the Devil, he vanished.

Senerclaus tells of a plain Country man at Friburg Germany, to whom, as he
lay on his deathbed, the Devil appeared in the shape of a tall, and grimme man,
claiming his soul, saying, Thou have been a notorious sinner, and I am now come
to set down all thy sins, and thereupon drew out paper and ink, and sitting
down at a Table that stood by, began to write. The sick man said; My soul is
Christ's, and all my sins were nailed to his Cross; But if thou desire to set
down my sins, write thus: All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. The Devil
set that down, and bade him say on. He did; But thou, Lord, have promised for
thine own Names sake to blot out all our iniquities: And to make our scarlet
sins white as snow. The Devil would not write these words, but was earnest
with the man to go on in his former confession. Then said the sick man with
great cheerfulness; The Son of God appeared to destroy the works of the Devil:
whereupon the Devil vanished, and shortly after the sick man dyed.

Mr. White of Dorchester being a member of the Lambeth; but for the present
could get no convenient house to dwell in, but one that was possessed by the
Devil: This he took; and not long after his maid sitting up late, the Devil
appeared to her, whereupon in a great fright she ran up to tell her Master; He
bid her get to bed, saying; She was well served for sitting up so late:
Presently after the Devil appeared to Mr. White himself standing at his beds
feet: To whom Mr. White said; If thou have nothing else to do* thou may
stand there still; And I will betake my self to my rest: and accordingly
composing himself to sleep, the Devil vanished.

Not long since at Stetin a University in Pomerania Cramerus a Professor of
Divinity in that University, to ask his advice, who wished him to keep the
bond: the other replied that he durst not; Then said the Dr. bring it to me,
and I will keep it. Some few nights after as the Dr. was in his study, the
Devil came rapping at his study door, saying, Cramer, Cramer, give me by bond,
for it belongs to me, and thou have nothing to do with it. To whom the Dr.
answered; Satan, Satan, thou shall not have the bond, thou have nothing to do
with it, I have put it where thou can not fetch it; For it is in my Bible at
the third Chapter of Genesis; where these words are, The seed of the woman
shall break the Serpents head: upon this the Devil (taking his Chamber-window
with him) went his way.

Crescentius the Popes Legate at the Council of Trent, as he was upon a time
writing Letters till midnight to the Pope; being about to rise to refresh
himself, there came in a great black dog, with flaming eyes, and ears hanging
almost to the ground, which came to the Table where he sat, and then vanished:
the Cardinal affrighted called in his servants, caused them to look about the
Chamber for the Dog, and when they could not find him, he immediately fell
sick, and in his sickness was always calling upon those about him to drive
away the dog that clumbe upon his bed, and so continued till he dyed. Sleid.
Comment.

Anno Christi 1653. about the month of October, Wales about V^rexham,
endeavoring to win some professors to their party: Their principal design
was to disgrace the Ministry, and all public Ordinances. They held universal
Redemption, Free Will, and falling from Grace: they published that all men have
the pure seed of God in them: boasting that themselves were perfect, and
without sin: that they knew at the first sight sincere Christians from
hypocrites. At their meetings after long silence, sometimes one, sometimes more
fell into a great and dreadful shaking, and trembling in their whole bodies,
and all their joints with such risings, and swellings in their bellies, and
bowels, sending forth such shreekings, yellings, howlings, and roarings, as not
only affrighted the spectators, but caused the Dogs to bark, the swine to cry,
and the Cattle to run about, to the astonishment of all that heard them. By
these artifices one William Spencer was drawn by them to leave the Church, and
to follow them, whereupon at several times he fell into the same quaking fits:
And lying with one of them three several nights; the last night being much
troubled, and not able to sleep, upon a sudden he heard something buzzing, and
humming about the Quakers head like an humble Be, which did sore affright him,
whereupon he sought to rise: but the Quaker persuaded him to lie still: and
immediately there arose a great wind, and storm, which shook the house wherein
they lay: which adding much to his former fear, he again attempted to arise:
but the Quaker still pressed him to lie still, persuading him to expect the
Power to come (which they often promise to their Proselytes,) and thereupon he
again heard the former humming noise which more and more terrified him, so that
he strove vehemently to rise, but the Quaker laid his head upon Spencer's
shoulder, and did blow hard like the hissing of a Goose several times toward
his face, or mouth, which made him leap out of his bed in a great astonishment,
crying for a light, and guide to conduct him to a neighbors house: and upon
this occasion left them altogether, testifying the truth hereof to the Quaker's
face before many witnesses, the Quaker not denying it. Attested under several
hands.

Richard Duke of Gloucester was so cunning a dissembler Edward the 5th. his
Nephew, and his Brother in the Tower, and had cut off the heads of some of the
Lords that stood in his way, he suborned one Dr. Shaw in a Sermon at Paul's
Cross to blazon his honorable Birth, and Parentage, to relate his Virtues, to
commend his Valor, to weaken the fame, and honor of the deceased King Edward
by reason of his lasciviousness with Shores Wife, to basterdize all his
children as being born in Adultery, etc. and applying his speech to the
worthiness, and goodness of Richard, he took it for granted that the people
could not choose but receive him for their undoubted Sovereign, and King, and
so he strove to have prepared the multitude to have shouted when Richard came
in, and to have cried, King Richard, King Richard: but he failed of his
purpose, for every man was silent, and more surprised with wonder then with
applause, to see how wickedly these businesses were carried on. The next day
the Duke of Buckingham went to Guildhall in London, and there to the Citizens
endeavored by like arguments to make Richard the Protector the right, and
undoubted heir, and inheriter of the Crown, and though the people took no
content in this speech, nor by their voices assented to that which was
delivered, yet he procured the Lord Major, and Aldermen the next day to go with
him, and many other Lords to Bainard's Castle to the Protector, where they
offered him to receive him for their lawful King, entreating him to accept of
the burden: But ofttimes he refused to grant their request: yet at last
(seeming to be overcome by their importunity) he assented: and thus by their
persuasions he gained his own hearts desire. Mart. Chron.

Themistocles did so envy Aristides for that favor Athens, that when he had no
other exceptions against him, he suggested to the people, that Aristides by his
just and upright dealing engrossed all matters of Judicature into his own
hands, and thereby affected the sole power, and overthrow of all their other
Tribunals, for which he caused him to be banished. Plut.

Their banishment was called Ostracisme, and the Ostracisme: Now when Aristides
was to be banished, a certain illiterate Citizen met him in the street, and
because he could not write himself, desired him to set down Aristides his name
in his shell: Aristides wondering at it, asked him whether he had ever suffered
any wrong from Aristides, or whether he knew him if he saw him? No, said the
other, I know him not, neither did he ever wrong me, but yet I envy him because
her has gotten the surname of Just. Aristides wondering at it, took the man's
shell, wrote down his own name, and so delivered it, never discovering himself
to him. Plut.

that he could hold out no longer, he caused a great pile of wood to be made in

all his gold, silver, and treasures, and so setting it on fire, he cast himself
into it, whereby they all perished together. Diod. Sic.

Candaules King of Lydia having a very beautiful Gyges a witness thereof: and

Megahysus General to Darius in Europe, sent Amyntas King of Macedon, requiring

these Persians being merry with wine, required Amyntas to bring forth his
wives, and daughters for their further entertainment; Amyntas consented,
brought them forth, and placed them over against the Ambassadors, who being
almost drunken, they began to kiss the Matrones, and Virgins, and immodestly
to handle their breasts: Alexander the son of Amyntas taking this in scorn,
desired his father to withdraw himself, whilst he chastised the petulancy of
the Persians: and then calling forth the women, as if it were for them to
dress themselves more curiously, he caused diverse youths to be dressed in

Two young men of Sparta being sent to the Oracle Apollo at Delphos, in their
journey lodged at the house of one Scedasus in Leuctra, a good man, and given
much to hospitality: this Scedasus had two daughters, beautiful Virgins, upon
whom these young men cast wanton eyes, and as they came back again, they turned
into the same house, at which time Scedasus was from home, and the maids gave
them kind entertainment, but they seeing their opportunity ravished them, and
when they saw them make grievous moan for the wrong which they had suffered,
they murdered them, and threw them into a pit, and so departed. Not long after
Scedasus came home, and missing his daughters, looked up, and down for them; at
last a little Dog that he had came whining to him, and ran out of doors
inviting him to follow, which at last he did, and the dog brought him to the
pit into which they were thrown, whence he drew them out, and hearing by his
neighbors that those two men had been again at his house, he concluded that
they were the murderers, and therefore went to Lacedaemon, to complain to the
Magistrates of that barbarous cruelty, where he made his moan first to the
Ephori, and being neglected by them, then to the Kings, and they also
neglecting it, he complained to the people, and finding no redress, he with
hands lift up to heaven complained to the gods, and then stabbed himself: but
God left not this wickedness long unpunished, for shortly after in a great
battle which the Lacedaemonians fought in Leuctra against the Thebans, they
were overthrown, and abundance of them were slain. Xenoph.

When Alexander M. took the City of Thebes by Timoclea, a Lady of admirable
beauty, after which he asked her where she had hid her gold, and jewels? she
told him, she would show him the place, and so taking him into her Orchard, she
showed him a deep pit, which whilst he stooped to look into, she pushed him
into it, and then overwhelmed him with stones: for this she was accused, and
brought before Alexander, who asked her who she was? She with an undaunted
courage answered: I am the sister of Theagines, who lost his life, fighting
valiantly against thee for the liberty of Greece at Cheronaea: Alexander
wondering at her beauty, and boldness, set her, and all her children at
liberty. Diod. Sic.

Alexander M. having conquered Persia, and Persepolis the regal City, made a
great feast to his Captains, at which many Curtizans were also present, and
amongst the rest, Thais, that famous Athenian strumpet, who having bewitched
Alexander with her beauty, persuaded him to burn down the Queens Palace, which
was so stately a thing, that the like was not in the world. Parmenio much
dissuaded him from it, telling him what a dishonor it would be to him, by such
a shameful act to destroy that which he had gotten by his virtue, and valor,
and how distasteful it would be to all the Asiaticks, who would thereby judge
that he came not to conquer, and to possess, but to lay waste Asia: but
Alexander was so intoxicated with this harlot, that to gratify her, he refused
that good counsel, and caused it to be burnt down. Q. Cur.

and their other wickedness.
THe Jews were banished Rome, Act. 18 2.

They persecuted Paul, 2 Cor. 11. 24. Act. 21. 27. and 23. 12. and 25 2, 7. and

The Jews which crucified the Lord of life, and that his blood might be upon
them, and their children, presently after, through the just Judgment of God,
had blood to drink in full measure: For besides their afflictions in diverse
Countries, being tossed up, and down by the Deputies of the Romans; There were
slain in Caesarea 20000 in one day. At Alexandria 50000 another day: At
Zabulon, and Joppa 8400, besides the burning of the Towns. At Damascus 10000
had their throats cut. In the siege of Jerusalem they were so famished, that
Oxens dung was accounted good meat: Others fed upon old leather, and some women
boiled their own children, and did eat them. Many thinking to save their lives
by flying to the Romans were slit in pieces to search for gold, and Jewels in
their guts: two thousand dyed thus miserably in one night: 97000 were taken
prisoners at the taking of the City by Titus: eleven hundred thousand were
slain. As for the prisoners some of them were carried to Rome in triumph.
Others were slain in sundry places at the Conquerers will: Some were torn in
pieces, and devoured by wild beasts: Others were compelled to march in Troops
against their fellows, and to kill one another to make the spectators sport.
The relics of these wretched people were dispersed into all Nations under
heaven, having no Magistrates of their own to protect them, but were, and still
are altogether at the will, and discretion of the Lords of those Countries
where they sojourn: so that no Nation in the world is so vile, and contemptible
as the Jews.

In the time of Julian the Apostate he gave leave Jews to re-build the Temple
at Jerusalem; but so soon as they had laid the foundations thereof, all was
overthrown by an earthquake, many thousands of them being overwhelmed with the
mines; and those which were left, were slain, and scattered by a tempest, and
thunder.

The Jews at Imnester near Antioch celebrating Simeon, Anno Christi 1476. And
another in Fretulium five years after. At another time they took a Carpenters
son in Hungary, in contempt of Christ, whom they called the son of a
Carpenter, and cutting all his veins sucked out all his blood with quills: And
being apprehended and tortured, they confessed that they had done the like at
Thirna four years before, and that they could not be without Christian blood,
for that therewith they anointed their Priests: But at all these times their
wickedness being discovered, they suffered just punishment, by hanging,
burning, or some other cruel death.

Anno Christi 1492. one Eleazar a Jew bought the Fincel.

Anno Christi 1407. a Jew stole the picture of Gasp. AEdio. l. 3. c. 6.

The Jews whilst they were suffered to live here England, used every year to
steal some Christian's child, and on Good-Priday to crucify him in despite of
Christ, and the Christian Religion.

Thus they served a child at Lincoln, Anno Christi Henry the third: And another
at Norwich, having first circumcised him, and kept him a whole year: For which
being apprehended thirty two of them were put to death at Lincoln, and twenty
at Norwich: Others of them being besieged at York when they could hold out no
longer, cut their own throats, whereby fifteen hundred of them perished at that
time. At Northhampton many of them were burnt for attempting to set the City on
fire with wildfire: And at last for their many wicked practices, they were
utterly banished the Kingdom of England by King Edward the first, Anno Christi
1291. for which the Commons gave the King a Fifteenth.

Judea has now only some few parcels of rich Psalm. 107. 34. He turns a
fruitful Land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.

In the Reign of Adrianus the Emperor, he sent Severus his General against the
Jews, who by reason of their multitudes would not try it out in a set battle,
but proceeding more warily, and taking his opportunity, he by degrees took
fifty of their fortified Castles, rased nine hundred, and fourscore of their
best Towns, and slew five hundred, and eighty thousand of their men: besides
innumerable multitudes which perished by famine, sickness, and fire: so that
almost all Judaea was left destitute: and Adrian by an Edict prohibited the
Jews from coming near to Jerusalem, or once from any high place to look
toward the same, or the Region adjoining. Dion.

Salmanticensis says, that there was a decree made Rome, that no Jew should
ever enter Cyprus (the place where their rebellion began) and that Adrian
destroyed twice as many Jews as Moses brought out of Egypt: He rased
Jerusalem, and not far from it built another City (the now Jerusalem) and
called it after his own name AElia. And over the gate of this City he placed
the Statues of swine, which were faithful Porters to prohibit the superstitious
Jews from entrance. This was about the year 135.

St. Hierom tells us, that in his time on that day Jerusalem was taken by the
Romans, you may see decrepit women, and old ragged men, and many wretched
people (but pitied of none) with blubbered cheeks, black arms, dishevelled
hair, howling, and lamenting for the ruins of their Sanctuary, in their
bodies, and habits bearing, and wearing ^he sad characters of Divine vengeance,
of whom the Soldiers also exact their fee, for liberty of further weeping: so
that they which formerly sold the blood of Christ, are now fain to buy their
own tears.

In the Reign of Trajan ( Adrian's predecessor) Jews rebelled in Egypt, and
Cyrene, where they slew many Greeks, and Romans, did eat their flesh, girt
themselves with their guts, imbrewed themselves with their blood, and clothed
themselves with their skins: many they sawed in sunder from the Crown
downwards, many they cast to the Beasts, etc. Hereupon Trajan sent against them
Martius Turbo, who destroved many thousands of them: and fearing lest the Jews
in Mesopotamia should break out into the like outrages, he commanded Lucius
Quietus to destroy them utterly, who so diligently executed his will* that the
Emperor to recompense his service made him President of Judea. Dion.

In Creet there arose amongst them a false Prophet Moses that led the
Israelites through the Red Sea, telling them that he was come to lead them
through the Sea into the holy Land: Thus for a whole year he went from City to
City amongst them, persuading them to leave their riches to any that would take
them, and to follow him; and at a day appointed he went before them to a
Promontorie of the Sea, and there bidsthem leap in, which many doing perished
in the waves, and more would have done but that some Christian Merchants, and
Mariners saved some, and stayed the madness of others: But when the Jews
sought to revenge themselves on this counterfeit Moses, he could no where be
found, and thereupon they concluded him to be the Devil in humane shape that
thus sought their destruction. Socrates.

Adrian banished 500000 of them into Spain, Ferdinand, and Isabel, Anno Christi
1492. at which time there went out of Spain 120000 Families: From thence they
passed into Tuscany, and the Popes Dominions, but were again banished thence by
Paul the fourth and Pius the fifth. But it would be endless to show what
miseries they have endured ever since they committed that great sin.

Lactantius says, That when Noah cast off his son Cham for his wickedness. he
went into Canaan, and his posterity being ignorant of God, because their
Founder or Prince received not of his father rules for Gods worship, quickly
sell to Idolatry: The Egyptians being not covered with houses by reason of the
temperate air, observing the motions of the stars, whilst they often viewed
them more curiously fell to worship them: After which they invented monstrous
shapes of Beasts, and worshipped them: Others scattered into other regious,
admiring the Heavens, Sun, Moon, Earth, Sea, without Images, or Temples
worshipped them. and sacrificed to them, till afterward they erected Temples,
and Images to their most puissant Kings, and ordained to them sacrifices, and
Incense, etc.

The Egyptians of all other Nations were most Isis, Serapis, and Anubis, but
even the basest of living creatures, as Dogs, Catts, Crocodiles, Hawks,
Ichnumons, Wolves, etc. To these they gave food; consecrated fields, and
tributes to them, the Images of these they carried in their Ensigns, and if any
man killed any of these, they were punished with death for it. Lipsius. Also in
the time of a great Famine they spared these creatures, and chose rather to
feed upon man's flesh: yea they fed these creatures with man's flesh to preserve
their lives. Diod. Sic.

The Carthaginians were so superstitious that they Saturn, in the arms of
whose brazen Image they used to lay them, and then to tumble them alive into a
pit of fire; and this they did upon certain days each year: but especially
they multiplied these Sacrifices in the time of any public calamity; so that
having suffered a great loss by Agathocles, they resolved to offer 200 young
Noble-mens sons to appease the angry Deity; yea, and there were so many youths
that voluntarily offered themselves hereunto. Plut.

When S^e^igrade in Egy^us was besieged by the Turk, a Traitor within (knowing
how superstitiously the Garrison Soldiers abhorred tasting any thing that they
deemed unclean) threw a dead dog into the only Well that supplied the City
with water: upon the discovery whereof the Soldiers chose rather to die then
to drink of it, whereupon the City was delivered up to the Turk: See
Scanderbeg's Life in my second Part.

The Idol Moloch, or Saturn, amongst the Idolatrous Jews was represented by a
Man-like Brazen body, and with the head of a Calf. The children offered to
Moloch were enclosed within the body of this Idol which was compassed about
with a great fire, and as the Idol heated, the Sacrificers filled the air with
the noise of Instruments, that the pitiful cries of the Sacrificed children
might not be heard.

answered the bloody Tigellinus, Nero's favorite; I think (said he) far better
then you; for you repute him worthy to sing, but I to hold his peace. And so
truly it was, for his voice was but weak, and hollow, and therefore to help it,
he used to lie on his back with a leaden plate on his breast, and to fast
certain days in every month with nothing but oil. Pliny.

A little before the Spanish Invasion in eighty Spanish Ambassador after a
large recital of his Masters demands to Queen Elizabeth* summed up the effect
of it in this Tetrastich, Te veto ne pergas bello defendere* Belgas;
Quae Dracus eripuit nunc restituantur oportet:
Quas Pater evertit, jubeo te Condere cellas:
Religio Papae fac restituatur ad unguem. i. e.
These to you are our Commands,
Send no help to th'Netherlands:
Of the Treasure took by Drake,
Restitution you must make:
And those Abbeys build anew
Which your fathers overthrew:
If for any Peace you hope,
In all points restore the Pope.


The Queen smiling at these demands, returned this sudden answer, Ad Graecas,
bone Rex, fient mandata Calendas.
Worthy King, know this your will,
At latter Lammas we will fulfill.

Alexander the Great, having taken the Kingdom Sidon, gave it to Hephaestion
to dispose of it to whom he pleased: Hephaestion to show his gratitude
proffered it to his host with whom he quartered; but he, not being of the
Kingly family, refused it, saying; It is not our Country fashion that any one
should be King, but such as are of the King's line: and such an one, says he,
lives hard by, a good and a wise man, but very poor, and one that lives by his
hard labor: then Hephaestion, taking Kingly apparel with him, went to this
poor man, and saluted him King, bidding him wash off his dirt, and put off his
rags, and put on that Kingly apparel: the poor man's name was Abdolonimus, who
thought he had been in a dream, but being by the standers by washed, and
adorned, Hephaestion led him into the Palace, saying, When thou sit on thy
Throne, and have power over the lives of all thy Subjects, forget not thy
former condition. Alexander hearing of it, sent for him, and asked him with
what patience he being of such a noble extraction, could bear his former
poverty? To whom Abdolonimus answered; I pray God that I may bear the Kingdom
with the same mind; for, said he, these hands provided for my necessity, and as
I had nothing, so I wanted nothing. Just. Cur. Diod. Sic.

Numa Pompilius made a Law amongst the Romans, men should not serve the gods,
as they passed by, or were in haste, or did any other business: but that they
should worship and pray to them when they had time, and leisure, and all other
businesses set apart. He himself did so firmly put his confidence in them, that
on a time being told that his enemies were in Arms coming against him: he
answered, At ego rem divinam facio: But I am sacrificing to the gods. Plut.

The Romans having taken the rich City of Veia, Apollo at Delphos; but when
little gold was found in Rome, the Soldiers having embezelled it, the Roman

they made a cup that weighed eight Talents, in recompense whereof the Senate
ordained that women should be openly praised in funeral Orations, which was
never used before. Plut.

to hazard the loss of all that was dear to him, then that those holy things
should miscarry. Plut.

horns, and a great quantity of incense, and sweet perfumes which he caused at
the City gates to be delivered to the Priests: with which act of piety the
Jews were so overcome, that they made peace with him, and yielded up their
City to him. Lipsius.

Pausanias King of Sparta, and at that time Captain Grecians, in that notable
fight against the Persians at Platea, when the Persian Army pressed upon him,

obtained a glorious victory over his enemies. Lipsius.

us go hence to Pella. Also one Jesus the son of Ananaus, eighty years before
the war began, went up, and down continually crying; A voice from the East, a
voice against Jerusalem, and the Temple: A voice against new married persons:
A voice against all this people. And when the City was besieged by the Romans,
going upon the Walls about the City, he cried, Woe, woe to the City, Temple,
and people, and at last he said, Woe also unto me: which words were no sooner
utt^ced, but a stone shot out of an Engine, slew him. Joseph. Hist.

Before the Peloponesian, or civil wars amongst Graecians, one of their

Rome, but it was the forerunner of some great event. Pez. Mel. Hist.

terror whereof was so great, that Bajazet himself the great Turk and the
people generally forsook their houses, and lay abroad in the fields: it endured
for a month together with very little intermission: after which ensued a great
plague, whereby the City was for the most part unpeopled. Turk. Hist. p. 476.

most terrible tempest with so violent, and continual thunder, and lightening,
that all the City showed as if it had been on fire: at the end whereof fell a
storm of hail that brake tiles, and glasses, so that stones were taken up of an
hundred, and fifty drammes, and the next morning some of them being weighed,
they were of about seven, and eight ounces apiece; wherewith many were sore
wounded: and the third of July after there fell out another tempest of thunder,
and lightning which burned a woman, and child, and slew much Cattle in the

heard to ride and march through the Towns: the Cattle, and Beasts in these
places were so frighted, that most of them brake out of their pastures; some by
leaping brake their necks, and some their legs; some ran away four miles, and
some more, who when they were found, were extremely heated: One Ox that lay in
a stack-yard lame, and could not rise without help in this fright brake forth,
and was found a mile off, and was fain to be brought home on a sled.

In March following three glorious Suns were seen Cumberland, to the
astonishment of many thousands which beheld them.

Standish, a Town five miles from Gloucester, and there appeared a terrible
fearful fiery shaking sword, with the hilt upwards toward the heavens, the
point downwards toward the earth; the hilt seemed to be blue, the Sword was of
a great length, shaking hither and thither, and coming lower toward the
earth: There was a long flame of fire toward the point, sparkling, and flaming
in a fearful manner to the great astonishment of the Spectators who were many.
At last the heaven closing, the Sword vanished, and the fire fell to the earth,
and ran upon the ground: This I had from an eyewitness.

astonishment of all that saw it, who took it as a presage of the divisions
ensuing. Camb. Brit. p. 399.

Orodes King of Parthia who had overcome and Crassus the Roman Consul; in his
old age fell desperately sick for grief at the loss of his son Pacones, slain
by Venticius: yet his younger son Phraates had not patience to expect his
death, but gave him poison to accelerate it: But behold Gods providence, the
poison proving a strong purge, wrought out not only it self, but the disease
too; so that Orodes recovered beyond expectation: which Phraates seeing,
strangled him, and to settle him the surer in his Kingdom obtained by
Parricide, he entered into league with the Romans, sending back the Ensigns of
Crassus, and other Presents: the Romans to requite him, sent him great gifts,
and amongst the rest a beautiful Italian strumpet, by whom he had a son, which
being grown up, by the advice, and help of his mother, poisoned his father to

to entrap her; he sent Ambassadors to her pretending love, promising to marry
her, to make her partner with him in the Kingdom, and her sons his heirs;
protesting that he took up arms for no other end: proffering to swear upon the
holy Altars when, and where she pleased, that all this was in good faith. The
poor Lady deceived hereby, sent some of her friends to take his oath, before
whom he went into the most ancient Temple, and there touching the gods, and the
Altar, swears. That he sincerely purposed to marry her, to make her his Queen,
and her children his heirs: otherwise he prays for vengeance upon himself,
etc. Upon this Arsinoe comes to him, is married, and crowned Queen of
Macedonia: then she delivers up to him Cassandrea, a most strong City, where
her children, and all her treasures were; he having now his desire, sends men
that slew her children in their mothers lap, and drove her into exile: but God
suffered not this wickedness to go long unrevenged; for presently after the
Gauls brake into Macedonia, overthrew Ptolemie, cut off his head, and carried
it upon a Lance about with them. Lipsius.

The same Cambyses having caused twelve of his Croesus, who was left as a
Counselor to him by his father Cyrus, reproved him for it, admonishing him not
so to give way to his passion, lest he provoked his Subjects to rise up against
him: Cambyses instead of making a good use of it, took a bow, and would have
slain Croesus for it, but he escaping from him, Cambyses commanded his servants
to slay him: yet they thinking that he would afterward repent it; hid Croesus,
and slew him not; and when Cambyses not long after wanted Croesus for his
faithful counsel, and bemoaned his rash putting of him to death: his servants
expecting a great reward, brought him forth. Cambyses was glad that Croesus was

CHAP. XCV. Scriptures the Word of God: Not to be profaned.
ALL Scripture is divinely inspired, 2 Timothy 3. 16. And holy men spoke as they
were acted* and carried thereunto by the holy Ghost, 2 Pet. 1. 21. God spoke by
the mouth of his holy Prophets, Luke 1. 70. we speak (says Paul) not in the
words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the holy Ghost teaches, 1 Cor. 2.
13. and that both for matter, as v. 12. and words. These are the very
sentences, yea notions, that were writien of old in the mind of God, and are
now clothed with his own very terms, and expressions: though by some of his
servants he has uttered himself more loftily, by some in a lower Language,
according to the several abilities of the speakers, and capacity of the hearers.

Arguments a posteriori to prove the Divinity of the Scriptures are: The
venerable antiquity, matchless majesty, lively efficacy, beautiful harmony,
incorrigible purity, invincible perennity, and continuance of them, mauger the
injury, and iniquity of times, and Tyrants who have sought to suppressc them:
Besides the confirmation by Miracles, confession of Martyrs, destruction of
oppugners, fulfilling of Prophecies, consent of Churches, yea, assent of
adversaries: As first, of Heretics, who in oppugning of Scriptures do yet
allege Scripture to their own utter destruction, 2 Pet. 3. 16. Secondly, of
Jews Gods Library-keepers, as St Augustine calls them, who studiously read, and
curiously kept the Books of the Old Testament, by a singular Providence of God,
for our benefit, and behoof. 3. Many Heathens have sealed to the truth of the
Scripture by their testimonies, and confirmed them to be Divine. Porphyry
testifies that Moses has written the History of the Law truly. Numenius the
Pythagorist recites Moses's History almost word for word, testifying that he
was a great Divine: But we have better testimonies, both outward and inward.

That without us is: First, The Scripture testifying of it self, and we know
its testimony is true, because it is the Word of that God that can as soon die
as lie: Hence Moses so often says; I am the Lord: And the Prophets, Thus says
the Lord: The Evangelists, Jesus said: The Apostles, I have received of the
Lord that which I delivered unto you. The truth is, the best proof of the
Scripture is to be fetched out of it self, whence also it is called Light, Psalm.
119. 105. because it discovers it self: and the Testimony of the Lord, because
it bears witness to it self: and this it does not authoritative only, by an
inartificial argument, but ratiocinative, by sound reasons, whether we look to
the Penmen of the Scripture, the subject matter of the Scripture, or the
admirable effects thereof.

The Penmen (besides their divine vocation, mission, and inspiration) were
plain men, poor men, shepherds, neat-herds, fishers, Publicans, etc. neither
eloquent Orators, nor cunning headed Politicians to art out an Imposture, nor
witty enough to deceive, Act. 4. 13. Add hereunto their impartial
faithfulness in relating the naked truth, though to the discredit (as it might
seem) of themselves, and their best friends. Moses repeats the sin and doom of
his grandfather Levi: of his brother A^ron, and sister Miriam, nay, of himself
how he sinned, and was sentenced at the waters of strife. David shames himself
in his preface to the 51. Psalm. Isaiah tells the world of the wickedness of
Ahaz, and weakness of Hezekiah, his natural Princes. Ezekiel makes honorable
mention of Daniel his coetaneous, and Peter of Paul, though he took him up
publicly for halting at Antioch. I was a blasphemer, an oppressor, a
persecutor, says that blessed Apostle, whereby we see that it is free from
partiality, and flattery.

Secondly, For the matter of the Scripture, it is proved to be the Word of God;
By the Majesty of it, which (besides the stately plainness of the style) far
surpasses the creatures capacity, the fathom of flesh, and reach of reason.
There is no jot, or tittle of it that savours of earthlinesse: Every word of
Gods mouth is pure, precious, and profitable, not a syllable superfluous. The
very majesty of the sentence is such as cannot be conceived, and yet it is
always more powerful in matter then in words. It sets forth such an admirable
concurrence of Gods mercy, and Justice in man's Redemption, by the man Christ
Jesus, as no creature could possibly contrive: or if they could, yet certainly
would not. Not good men, or Angels, for they would never have put upon the
world such a notorious imposture: Not evil men or Devils, for it crosses, and
controlleth their contrary courses, and condemns them to the pit of hell. It
utterly overturns the Devils Kingdom, who therefore sharply eggeth, and edgeth
all his instruments against it: yea, and tempts better men sometimes to doubt
of it: whereas if it were forged, and false, he would (like a liar as he is)
foment, and fight for it, promote, and propagate it, as he does Turcisme, and
Paganism, and other falsehoods abroad in the world though never so absurd, and
impious.

Lastly, look upon its admirable effects, and irresistible power to effect the
thing whereunto it is appointed, as to break the stubborn, to bind up the
brokenhearted, etc. Not only to inform as other writings, but to reform, yea,
transform the soul from glory to glory, till it be wholly conformed to that
heavenly pattern: Add hereunto, that it is effectual for the conversion of a
sinner from the error of his way: Not from error of his mind only, but of
his manners also: For the mind may be thoroughly convinced, and yet the man not
truly converted; yea, and when the spirit feels it self dead, and decayed (as
by a relapse into some foul sin) this good Word revives it, as the breath of
God did those dry bones in Ezekiel. Humane writings may show some faults to be
avoided, but give no power to amend them: But, Now are ye clean by the Word
that I have spoken, says Christ: Sanctify them by thy truth, thy Word is
truth. Philosophy may civilize, not sanctify: hide some sins, not heal them:
cover, not cure them. So then, the efficacy, and virtue of the Scripture to
produce the love of God, and our enemies, to purify the heart, to pacify the
conscience, to rectify the whole both constitution, and conversation of a man,
to take him off from the delights of the world, and the flesh, to make him
glory in afflictions, sing in the flames, triumph over death: all these, and
more do necessarily conclude the divine authority of the Scriptures. What words
of Philosophers could ever make of a Leopard a Lamb: of a viper a child; of a
Leacher a chaste man; of a Nabal a Nadib; of a covetous carle, a liberal person?

Besides this real, there is also a vocal testimony from God to the Divinity of
the Scriptures, which yet is heard by none but Gods household, and is confined
to the communion of Saints, whose consciences he secretly persuades of this
truth, and sweetly seals it up to them: Promised, Isa. 52. 6. They shall know
in that day that I am he that does speak, etc. Joh. 7. 17. If any man will do
his will, he shall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, etc. 1 John 5.
10. He that believes has the witness in himself. 1 Cor. 2. 15. The spiritual
man discerns all things: for he has the mind of Christ: and an unction
within that teaches him all things, 1 John 2. 20, 27. So that he no sooner
hears, but believes, and is sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Ephesians.
1. 13. whose inward testimony of the truth, and authority of the Scriptures, is
ever met by a motion of the sanctified soul, inspired by the same Spirit, more
steadfastly resting it self on that testimony, then if he should hear from
heaven, as St. Augustine did, Toll, Lege, take, and read this book of God: or
than if some Angel should bring him a Bible, and say; This is the very Word of
God: For he might suspect these as delusions of the Devil But the testimony of
the Spirit we know to be true; Job. 14. 17. because he is both a Spirit of
truth, and a searcher of the deep things of God, 1 Cor. 2. 10. Only it must be
remembered, that this inward witness must not be brought for confirmation of
this Doctrine to others, nor for confutation of adversaries: But that every one
for himself might hereby be certified, and satisfied in his conscience, that
the Sacred Scriptures are the Word of God. The Churches testimony without this
is but of little value, and validity: it being merely informativum et
directivum, non certificativum, et terminativum fidei: And whereas St.
Augustine says, I should not have believed the Gospel but that the authority
of the Church moved me thereto: he speaks there of himself as unconverted to
the faith, and so not acquainted with the Spirits testimony. Now no marvel
though such be moved by the consent, and authority of the Church; which is to
them an introduction whereby they are better prepared to believe the
Scriptures, yea, inclined at first to think them to be the Word of God, and so
made willing to read, and hear them. See this, and more in that elaborate piece
of my worthy friend, called Trapp's Treasury.

One John Ap-howel in Queen Mary's days standing William Maudon as he was
reading on a Primer at Greenwich, mocked him after every word with contrary
gaudes and flouting speeches unreverently; whereupon Maudon said to him, John,
take heed what thou do, thou mockest not me but God in his Word, though I be
simple that read it. Yet went he on in his mocking, till Maudon reading, Lord
have mercy upon us: Christ have mercy upon us: the other with a start, said
suddenly, Lord have mercy upon me: with that Maudon turning to him, said; What
aileth thee, John? to which he answered, Nothing, but that he was afraid:
Whereof, said Maudon? Nothing now, said the other: yet presently after he
confessed, that at the reading of those words, Lord have mercy upon me, the
hair of his head stood upright with a great fear that came upon him. On the
next day he ran mad, and was bound in his bed, and lay continually day, and
night crying out of the Devil of hell, etc. See my Eng. Mariyrolog^e.

CHAP. XCVI. Servants, Slaves.
THe Scythians having made an eruption into Asia Lorded it there for diverse
years: In the mean time their wives thinking that they had been all slain,
married their servants that were left to keep their cattle. But at last these
Scythians being beaten out of Asia by the Medes; returned home, but then their
servants rose in arms against them, and after diverse fights the victory
remained doubtful: at last one told them, That fighting against slaves they
should not use swords, but whips, as more proper instruments to subdue their
servile nature: which advice being well liked, against the next encounter they
provided them whips, with the claping of which their servants were so
terrified, that they ran away; and their Masters remained Conquerours. Pez.
Mel. Hist.

The Tyrians having maintained long wars Persians, were much weakened thereby;
which occasion their slaves, being many in number, laying hold of the
opportunity to rise up against their Masters, and put them all to the sword,
together with all their children, and then seized upon their houses, and
married their wives: only one of them being more merciful then the rest,
spared his old Master [ Straton] and his son, and hid them. Then these Slaves
having thus gotten possession of all, consulted to choose a King, and agreed,
That he that could first see the Sun rising should be King: whereupon this
forementioned Slave consulted with his old Master about the business; who bade
him, when others looked into the East, that he should look into the West: and
accordingly when they were all assembled into the fields, and every man's eyes
were fixed upon the East, he only looked VVestwards, for which his companions
scoffed at him: but presently he espied the Sunbeams shining upon the high
Towers, and Chimneys in the City, and so challenged the Kingdom: His
companions would needs know who taught him this wit, and at last he told them;
whereupon fetching out old Straton they not only gave him his life, but made
him their King. Justin.

Before the first destruction of Rome by Brennus, Gauls the very heathen
Writers observe that the people were careless of the service of the gods, and
grown loose, and dissolute in matters of Religion. Plut.

A religious man in an expostulatory strain complained Phocas, that Parricide,
who paved his way to the Throne by the murder of Mauricius his Master, and
predecessor, saying; Lord, wherefore have thou made this man Emperor? To whom
the Lord answered, Enimvero quia non inveni p^jor^m: Verily because I have not
found a worse. Thus God punishes a wicked people with a wicked, and Tyrannical
Prince. Cedrenus.

greater then ours. Sp. Chr.

Also before the Norman Conquest (as Gervasius Canterbury writes) the Priests
were idle, drousie, and unlearned, the people given to riot, and loose life;
Discipline lay dead, the Commonwealth sick of an infinite sort of vices: but
above all Pride, whose waiting-maid is destruction, was come to a mighty head:
yea they fell to fast to all lewdness, that to be ignorant of sinful crimes,
was held a great crime. Camb. Brit. p. 143.

Upon the Persecution of the Church under the Valerian, Cyprian writes thus: We
must confess that this great calamity which has wasted for the most part all
our Churches, and still does daily consume us, arises chiefly from our own
wickedness whilst we walk not in the way of the Lord, nor observe his
precepts as we ought, whilst we are full of lucre, pride, emulation,
dissension, void of simplicity, and faithful dealing, renouncing the world in
word, but not in deed, every man pleasing himself, and displeasing others, and
therefore are we thus worthily scourged: For, Non venissent fratribus haec
mala, si in unum fuisset fraternitas animata: These evils had not befallen the
brethren, if they had been joined together in brotherly unanimity. See more in
my Genesis Martyrologie. p. 56.

Salvian Bishop of Masilia complains that before Vandalls came into Africa,

went in the streets as if they had been Monsters. Eodem. page 101.

After the death of Cambyses there being none of Persian Nobles, or Magi being
all so potent, that none would give place to others, they at last agreed, That
meeting all together in such a place the next morning, he whose horse first
neighed, should be acknowledged King: one of these was Darius, whose Master of
his horse hearing what was determined, over night took Darius his horse to the
place, and caused him to cover a Mare; the next morning when they came all to
the place, Darius his horse remembering the Mare presently fell a neighing,
whereupon all the rest of the Nobles alighted, and saluted him for their King.
Herod.

Darius besieging the impregnable City of Babylon Zopyrus, caused himself to be
beaten black, and blew, his nose, and lips, and ears to be cut off, and
acquainting Darius with his purpose, he went to Babylon, into which being
admitted, he showed the people his dismembered, and torn body, complains of the
cruelty of Darius, and proffereth his best assistance to them against him: the
Citizens knowing the worth of the man, and not suspecting his fraud, made him
their Captain, and in some skirmishes he beat the Persians: at last having
drawn forth all the strength of the City, he betrayed them to Darius, and so
delivered up Babylon into his hands. After which Darius used to say, That he
had rather have one Zopyrus then twenty Cities of Babylon. Pez. Mel. Hist.

When the Grecian Navy understood that the Army Xerxes was entered into
Peloponesus, every one being solicitous for his own home, they resolved to
divide themselves, and to provide for the safety of their own Country: This
Themistocles mainly opposed, as foreseeing that the division of the Grecian
Navy would be their ruin, and therefore when he could no otherwise prevail,
he sent a trusty person about him privately to Xerxes to inform him, that the
Grecian Navy was intended to fly away, and that therefore he should presently
with his Navy set upon them, if he desired a glorious Victory. Xerxes being
glad of this intelligence, thinking that Themistocles had done it out of
respect to him, he presently caused his Navy to environ the Grecians on every
side, so that they were forced to fight whether they would or no, and so after
a terrible battle they gave the Persians a great overthrow, destroying two
hundred of their ships, besides those which they took in the battle. Herod.

Xerxes seeing his great losses both by Sea, and Mardonius, and himself with
some small party to return into Asia: the Grecian Generals understanding this,
resolved to go with their Navy to Abydos to break down the Bridge which Xerxes
had made, and left there over the Sea for his return at his pleasure, thinking
by this means either to destroy his whole Army thus shut up in Greece, or to
force him to good terms of agreement: Themistocles thinking that it was fitter
to make a golden bridge to a flying enemy, then to take away all hopes of
escaping from them which might make them fight more desperately, gave contrary
counsel; and when he saw that he could not prevail, he sent privately to
Xerxes, acquainting him with the Grecians purpose of breaking down his bridge,
and therefore advised him to hasten his return before they had put their
counsel into action. Xerxes being affrighted with this message, left his
Captains to bring after him those Forces which he intended to take back into
Asia, and himself with a few attendants posted back to the Bridge for his own
safety. Herod.

After the final overthrow of the Persian Army, Athenians began to build their
City anew, which had been burned by the Persians, and to compass it about with
strong Walls, which the Lacedaemonians hearing of, and suspecting the Athenian
power, they sent Ambassadors to them to dissuade them from the work, telling
them how dangerous it might be if the Persians should again come into Greece,
etc. Themistocles perceiving that they did it out of envy, told them that the
Athenians would themselves send Ambassadors of their own to satisfy the
Lacedaemonians about that matter: and so dismissing them, he exhorted the
Athenians to hasten their work all that possibly they could; and after a while
himself goes as their Ambassador to Sparta, but by the way pretends sickness,
and other impediments to hinder: yet at length he comes to Sparta, but then
tells them that he could do nothing effectually till his Colleagues were come
to him: In the mean time the Lacedemenians hearing that the Walls went forward
apace, sent new Ambassadors to know the truth of the business: Themistocles
therefore dispeeds away his man to Athens, writing to the Magistrates, that
when the Ambassadors came they should cast them into prison, and keep them as
pledges that the Lacedaemonians should act nothing against them: and at last he
makes an Oration to the Lacedaemonians, and tells them, that now Athens wa^
fortified, whereby they were able to repel war both by their Arms, and Walls:
and so having outwitted the Lacedaemonians by this stratagem, he returned home
with great applause. Justin.

Cimon, General of the Athenians triumphed over the Persians twice in one day:
for first he fought a Asia, wherein he gave them a great overthrow; and then
taking the Persian Ships, he put all his valiantest Soldiers into them, and
dressed them in the Persians apparel, and so sailing to the place where their
Land-Army lay, they took them for Persians returning in triumph from the
slaughter of the Athenians: Cimon therefore by this stratagem landing his men,
brake suddenly into the Camp of the Persians, whom they quickly overthrew with
a great slaughter, and took twenty thousand prisoners, together with an
infinite mass of treasure, the tenth part whereof the Athenians dedicated to
their gods. Diod. Sic.

Wheu the Grecians had taken the City of Bizantium, Grecian Captains referred
to Cimon the dividing of the spoil: whereupon he set all the Captives of one
side, and all the plunder of the City on the other; and then bade the other
Grecians choose which they would have: they chose the plunder, leaving the
naked persons to the Athenians, and withal, laughed Cimon to scorn for his
foolish division. But shortly after the friends, and kinsfolk of the Captives
came, and brought great sums of money to redeem the captives, whereby the
Athenians gat more then all the other Grecians; with which Cimon defrayed the
whole charges of the Navy for four months. Plut.

Another Stratagem of Cimons was this, whereas Athenians by forcing them to
serve in the Wars; Cimon on the contrary, suffered them to commute their
personal service for a sum of money, and they that had shipping if they would
deliver him their ships, he would excuse them from going in them themselves,
and so suffered them to follow their Trades, and husbandry: in the mean time he
hired his Athenians to serve in all the wars both by Sea, and Land, and so made
them expert, and excellent Soldiers, whilst their confederates spent their
time in ease, or contrary affairs, and so put the opportunity into the
Athenians hands of being Lords over all their neighbors. Plut.

In the wars between the Lacedaemonians, and the Athenians, when Archidamus the
Lacedemonian General entered with his Army into the Confines of Attiea, and laid
all waste before him; Pericles the Athenian General suspecting that he would
spare his houses, and Lands, sent to Athens, and bestowed them all upon the
Commonwealth* that so he might free himself from the envy, and suspicion of
his Citizens. The like Stratagem did Fabius Max. the Roman use, who when as
Hanibal had spared his lands, he presently sent his son to Rome to sell them,
and employed the money for the redeeming of Captives from Hanibal. Pez. Mel.

Lycurgus commanded his Spartans that they Plut.

A little before the Grecian Navy joined battle Persians, Themistocles as he
went along the Sea, and passed by those places where the enemies Navy must
needs come, caused to be engraven in great letters upon the rocks, and stones
an Exhortation to the Ionians to desert the Persians, and to take part with the
Grecians, who were their ancestors, and founders, and such as fought for their
liberty, hoping by this stratagem either to bring the Ionians to take part with
him, or at least to make the Persians jealous, and distrustful of them, and so
render them the less useful. See the Example of Straton in Servants.

Sertorius the Roman General in his passage into Spain was fain to pay tribute
to certain barbarous people that inhabited the Pyrenaean Mountains over which
he was to pass. At this some of his Soldiers muttered, saying, That it was an
act very dishonorable for the Romans: but he told them that he only bought
time, a commodity which such as aspire to haughty enterprises must take up at
any rate.

young ones: about which time they cast all their feathers, and become stark

The Storks are so careful of their parents, that Delph in the Low Countries is
so seated for the feeding, and bringing up of these Birds, that it is hard to
see an house wherein they breed not: In which Town upon the third of May Anno

big; the old ones perceiving the fire to approach their nests, attempted to
carry away their young ones, but could not they were so weighty, which they

In the year 1404. some women of Edam in the Low Countries going in Barks to
their cattle in Purmerm^^r, did often see at the ebbing of the water a
Sea-woman playing up, and down, whereat at first they were afraid, but after
encouraging one another, made with their Boats toward her, and the water now
not deep enough for her to dive in, they took her by force, drew her into the
Boat, and carried her to Edam, where in time she grew familiar, and fed of
ordinary meats; and being sent to Harleus lived some fifteen years, but never
spoke, seeking often to get again into the water. Belg. Com. Wealth. p. 102.

About the year 105. in the Reign of Trajan, who October there fell out one of
the most terrible Earthquakes that ever was: First there arose furious, and
violent winds, which tare up trees by the roots, made birds fall to the earth,
uncovered houses, and overthrew many; then followed thunder, and lightning,
which made the night like noonday; then fearful Thunderbolts, which brake
down stately buildings, and slew many men. The Sea was wonderfully troubled,
after which came such a violent heat, that men not able to endure it, stripped
themselves, and hid themselves under ground, the sky was so dark, and dust so
great, that one could not see another, so that shocking together many fell down
dead: Many Cities were ruinated, much people perished; many Mountains, and
hills sunk, and became plains: many Rivers were dried up, Fountains and
springs brake out where never was any before. Almost all the houses in Antioch

Anno Christi 1204. at Oreford in Suffolk a fish Bartholomew de Glanvil, Keeper
of Oreford Castle. In all his limbs, and members he resembled a man, had hair
in ^ll the usual parts of his body, only his head was bald. The Knight caused
meat to be set before him, which he greedily devoured, and did eat fish raw, or
sod: that which was raw he pressed with his hand till he had squeezed out all
the moisture: He uttered not any speech, though to try him, they hung him up by
the heels, and grievously tormented him. He would get him to his couch at the
setting of the Sun, and rise again at the Sunrising. One day they brought him
to the haven, and let him go into the Sea, but to prevent his escape they set
three rows of very strong nets before him to catch him again at their
pleasure: But he, streightwaies diving to the bottom, crept under all their
nets, and showed himself again to them, and so often diving he still came up,
and looked upon them that stood on the shore as it were mocking of them. At
length after he had sported himself a great while in the water, and there was
no hope of his return, he came back to them of his own accord, and remained
with them two months after. But finally, when he was negligently looked to, he
went to the Sea, and was never after seen, or heard of. Fabians Chron.

Near unto the Grand Cairo in Egypt is a Garden Balme-tree bearing true balm,
that is in the world: it has a short stock, or body, and bears leaves like
unto vine-leaves, but not altogether so long, P. Pil. v. 2. p. 838.

The famous River of Nilus in Egypt uses once June, and increases daily,
sometimes two, sometimes three fingers, and sometimes half a Cubit high on a
day: the increase of it is known by a pillar in a Cistern whereinto the water
is conveyed by a sluice, which pillar is divided into eighteen parts, each a
Cubit: if the water reach only to the fifteenth Cubit, they expect a fruitful
year, if it stay between the twelfth, and fifteenth Cubit, the increase of that
year will be but mean; if it reach not to the twelfth, it is a sign of scarcity:
if it rise to the eighteenth, the scarcity will be greater in regard of too
much moisture: this River continues 40 days increasing, and 40 days
decreasing. Eodem loco.

There are three sorts of Camels: the first sort are second fort of them have
two bunches on their back, and are fit either for burdens, or to ride on: the
third sort are of a slender, and low stature called Dromidaries, unfit for
burdens, but they excel in swiftness, so that in the space of one day they
will travel an hundred miles, and will so continue for eight or ten days
together with very little provender: and they will abstain from drink eight,
ten, and sometimes fifteen days together without any inconvenience. P. Pil. v.
2. p. 845.

In the Grand Cairo in Egypt the Plague uses to Nilus begins to overflow his
banks, at which time it does instantly cease: insomuch as when five hundred

p. 897.

In the Marshes of Egypt grow the sedgy reeds, Papyri, of which they made
paper, and of which ours (made of rags) assumeth that name: They divide it into
thin flakes, whereinto it naturally parts: then laying them on a Table, and
moistening them with the glutinous water of Nilus, they press them together,
dry them in the Sun, whereby they are fitted for use. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 898.

There is a certain Island called Lounda in the Congo, wherein is no fresh
water (being a very sandy ground) but if you digg but the depth of two or three
hand-breadthes, you shall find sweet water, the best in all those Countries:
and (which is most strange) when the Ocean ebbeth this water grows brackish,
but when it flows to the top, it is most sweet. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 989.

Not far from Casbine, the Regal City in Persia is of which there continually
springs, and issues a mavelous quantity of black Oil, which serves in all
parts of Persia to burn in their houses, and is usually carried all over the
Country upon Kine, and Asses, whereof you may often meet three or four hundred
in company. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1431.

About three days journey from old Babylon is a Ait, and near unto that is a
valley of Pitch very mavelous to behold, wherein are many Springs, throwing
out abundantly a kind of black substance* like unto Tar, and Pitch, which
serves all the Country thereabouts to make staunch their Barques with, and
Boats: every one of which Springs makes a noise like to a Smith's Forge in
puffing, and blowing out the matter, which never cease day, nor night, and
the noise is heard a mile off: the Moors call it Hell-mouth. P. Pil. v. 2. p.
1437.

The tree whereon the Coquo-nuts grow in the Indies of all trees in the Forest
may have the pre-eminence: for merely with it, without the least help of any
other a ship may be built, and furnished to Sea: the heart of the Tree will
make good Planks, and Timber, and Masts: a Gum that grows thereon will serve
to calk it: the rind of the same Tree will make Cordage, and Sails; and the
large nut being full of kernel, and pleasant liquor will serve for meat, and
drink to those that sail in the ship; and the store of these nuts for
Merchandise. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1466.

In the great Mogul's Country, from Agra to Lahor (which are the two chief
Cities in this Empire) is about four hundred English miles: the Country in all
that distance being even without Mountains, or hills; and the highway planted
on both sides with Trees like unto a delicate Walk. P. Pil. v. 2. 1468.

In the same Country in a City called Nagracut, Ma^ta, visited yearly by many
thousands of the Indians, who out of devotion cut off part of their tongues to
make a sacrifice for it: In the same Province also there is another famous
Pilgrimage to a place called Iallamakae, where out of cold Springs, and hard
rocks there are daily to be seen incessant eruptions of fire: before which the
Idolatrous people fall down, and worship. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1468.

In the same Country also they have a pleasant Taddy, issuing from a spongie
Tree that grows straight, and tall, without boughs to the top, and there
spreads out into branches, somewhat like to an English Colewort, where they
make incisions, under which they hang earthen pots to preserve the influence:
that which distills forth in the night is as pleasing to the taste as any white
wine, if drunk betimes in the morning; and of a piercing, and medicinable
quality, excellent against the stone. But in the heat of the day the Sun alters
it, so that it becomes headdy, ill-relished, and unwholesome. P. Pil. v. 2. p.
1469.

The Cynamon-tree is a small tree, and low, having March or April, when the sap
goes up to the top of the tree, they cut the bark of the tree round about in
length from knot to knot, or from joint to joint, above and below, and then
easily with their hands they take it away, laying it in the Sun to dry, and
yet for all this the tree dies not, but against the next year it will have a
new bark, and that which is gathered every year is the best Cynamon: that
which grows longer is great, and not so good, P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1709

In India is a treee called Arbore de Rays, or the Tree of roots, it grows
first up like other trees, and spreads the branches, out of which there come
strings, which seem afar off to be cords of hemp, which growing longer, till
they reach the ground, there take root again: so that in the end one tree will
cover a great piece of ground, one root crossing within another like a Maze,
each of these young trees will in time grow so big, that it cannot be discerned
which is the principal trunk o^ body of the tree.

There is also a tree called Arbor^ irist^, or the sorrow full tree, so called,
because it never bears blossoms but in the nightime, and so it does, and
continues all the year long: So soon as the Sun sets, there is not one blossom
seen upon the tree, but presently within half an hour after, there are as many
blossoms as the tree can bear, pleasant to behold, and smelling very sweet,
and as soon as the day comes, and the Sun is rising, they all presently fall
off, and not one to be seen on the tree, which seems as though it were dead,
till evening comes again, and then it begins to blossom as it did before,
it is as big as a Plum-tree: it grows up quickly, and if you break but a
branch of the tree, and set it in the earth, it presently takes root, and
grows, and within a few days after it bears blossoms, which are like
Orange-tree-blossoms, the flower white, and in the bottom somewhat yellow, and
reddish. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1780.

There is also an herb in India called by the Portugals herba sentida, or
feeling herb, which if a man touch, or throw sand, or any other thing upon it,
presently it becoms as though it were withered, closing the leaves together,
and it comes not to it self again as long as the man stands by it, but
presently after he is gone, it opens the leaves again, which become stiff,
and fair, as though they were newly grown: and touching it again, it shuts, and
becomes withered as before, so that it is a pleasure to behold the strange
nature of it. P. Pil. v. 2. p* 1781.

Pepper is planted at the root of some other tree, Ivy: the leaves are like
the Orange leaves, but somewhat smaller, green, and sharp at ends: the Pepper
grows in bunches like grapes, but less, and thinner; they are always green
till they begin to dry, and ripen, which is in December, and January, at which
time it turns black, and is gathered. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1782.

The best Ginger grows in Malabar; it grows Netherland Reeds, two or three
spans high, the root whereof is the Ginger, which is gathered in December, and
January. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1782.

The Clove-trees are like Bay-trees, the blossoms P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1783.

The Nutmeg-tree is like a Pear Tree, but that it is Peaches, the inward part
whereof is the Nutmeg; this has about it an hard shell like wood, and the
shell is covered over with Nutmeg-flower, which is the Mace, and over it is the
fruit, which without is like the fruit of a Peach. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1783.

Gumme-Lac comes most from Pegu: where are Pismires with wings which fly up the
trees like Plum-trees, out of which trees comes a certain Gum which the
Pismires suck up, and then they make the Lac round about the branches of the
trees, as Bees make Wax, and when it is full, the owners come, and breaking off
the branches, lay them to dry, and being dry, the branches shrink out, and the
Lac remains. P. Pil. v. 2. p. 1783.

Ambergreece is usually cast upon the Seashore, Whale, or as others, the

There is in Africa a certain Monster called Po^g^ man but in his legs which
have no calves: He goes always upon his legs, and carries his hands clasped
in the nape of his neck when he walks upon the ground; they sleep in trees and
live of fruit, and nuts. P. Pil. v* 2. p. 982.

In Abassia are Kine with horns like unto Hearts Pil. v. 2. p. 1495.

In Sofala are many River-horses as big as two of Bears tush: they live in the

color gray with white strakes on their faces; or white stars* P. Pil. v. 2. p.

In America there are certain very small birds called Viemalim, with small, and
long bills, they live of the dew, and of the juice of flowers and Roses like
Bees: their feathers are of very curious colors; they die, or sleep every year
in October sitting on a bough in a warm place, and in April following they
awake again when the flowers be sprung. I have one of these Birds.

The most, and best Pearls are brought from the Ille of Z^ilan they fish for
them, beginning in March, and continuing fifty days: the manner is this: At
the end of a rope they make fast a great stone which they throw into the Sea,
and then a man that has his ears, and nose well stopped* and anointed with oil,
with a basket about his neck goes down by the rope to the bottom of the Sea,
and as fast as he can, fills his basket with Oisters, and when it is full
shakes the rope, and then his fellows in the Boat hale him up with his
Basket, which being emptied, he goes down again; and at the end of the fishing
they open their Oisters in many of which they find Pearls, which are of four
sorts, and valued according to their beauty, and bigness. Idem. p. 1709.

Mastick-trees grow only in the Island of Sio: August they begin their
Mastick-harvest, men cutting the bark of the Tree with Iron instruments, out of

In the Arabian Deserts there are great store of Ostridges, that keep in
flocks, and often affright passengers that are strangers with their fearful
shreeches, appearing afar off like a troop of horsemen: Their bodies are too
heavy to be supported with their wings, which useless for flight, yet serve
them to run more speedily, so that a swift horse can scarce overtake them: what
they find they swallow down, sometimes stones, and iron: when they have laid
their eggs (which are as big as a Culverin Bullet) they forget where they left
them, and so return no more: Hence that expression, Lam. 4. 3. The daughter of
my people is become cruel like the Ostriches in the wilderness. Whereupon also
she is made the Embleam of Folly; Job 39. 14, etc. She leaves her ^ggs in the

There are a sort of Fishes, whose wonderful making Pilchards, only a little
rounder, and bigger. They fly best with a side-wind, but longer then their
wings are wet. they cannot fly, so that their longest flight is about a
quarter of a mile. The Dolphins and Bonitoes do continually hunt after them to
devour them, whereupon for safety they take the air, but then there is a
foul called an Alcatrace, much like a Hern which hovers in the air to seize
upon them. Incidit in Scyllam qui vul^ vitare Charibdin. Out of the frying pan

In Brasile is a little bird, which they call the risen or awaken bird, because
it sleeps six months, and wakes the other six. It has a cap on its head of no
one color, but on what ^ide so ever you look shows red, green, black, or
other colors, all very fine and shining, the breast also shows great variety
of colors, especially yellow more fine then gold: The body is gray, and it
has a very long bill, and yet the tongue is twice so long as the bill: It
flies very swiftly, and makes a noise like a Be; It always feeds flying.

There is often a strange fight in the Sea between Whale and his enemies, viz.
The Swordfish, and the Thresher. The Swordfish is not great but strongly made,
and between his neck, and shoulders he has a bone, like a sword of about five
inches broad, and above three foot long full of prickles on either side. The
Thresher is a bigger Fish whose tail is broad, and thick and very weighty. The
fight is in this manner; The Swordfish places himself under the belly of the
Whale, and the Thresher above with his Tail thresheth upon the head of the
Whale till he forces him to give way, which the Swordfish perceiving, wounds
him in the belly with the Sword, and so forces him to rise up again. In this
manner they torment him, that the fight is sometimes heard above three leagues
off, the Whales roaring being heard much further, his only remedy in this case
is to get to the shore, which he labors to do so soon as he sees his
enemies: For then there can fight but one with him, and for either of them hand
to hand he is too good. Pur. Pil. v. 4. p. 1377.

There is also in the same Island a Tree as big as Oak of middle size, the bark
white like Hornbeam; six, or seven yards high with ragged boughs, the leaf
like the Bay-leaf. It bears neither fruit nor flower; It stands on the side
of an hill, in the day* it is withered, and drops all night (a cloud hanging
thereon) so that it yields water sufficient for the whole Island, wherein are
eight thousand souls, and about an hundred thousand Cammels, Mules, Goats,
etc. The water falls from it into a pond made of brick, paved with stone; from
which it is conveyed into several ponds through the whole Island. They also water
therewith their Cornground, for they have no other water in the Island* except
rainwater. The Pond holds twenty thousand Tun of water, and is filled in one
night. Many of English that have been there have attested the truth hereof.

Aloes grows in the same Country which is Semper viv^m, it is so full of a
Rosinlike juice that the leaves are ready to br^^k with it: which leaves they
cut in small pieces* and cast them into a clean pit made in the ground, and
paved: there it lies to ferment in the heat of the Sun, whereby the juice
flows forth, which they put in skins, and hang them up in the wind to dry,
whereby it hardens. P. Pil. v. 1. p. 419.

Indico grows in the Moguls Country, having Sena: the branches are of a
woody substance like broom: It grows not above a yard high, the stalk about
the bigness of a man's thumb: The seed is included in a small round Cod of an
inch long. This once sowed lasts three years* that of the first year makes a
weighty reddish Indico that sinks in water being not yet come to its
perfection: that of the second year is rich, very light, and of a perfect
violet color swimming on the water: that of the third year is weighty,
blackish, and the worst of the three. This herb when it is cut is put into a
Cistern, and pressed down with stones, then covered over with water, where it
remains till the substance of the herb is gone into the water: then it is drawn
forth into another Cistern, and labored with staves till it be like Batter,
then they let it sees, and so scum off the water two or three times till
nothing but a thick substance remains, which taking forth they spread on a
cloth, dry it in the Sun, then make it into balls, dry it on the sand, which
causes the sandy foot: That is best which is of pure a grain, violetcolour, is
glo^^ie, dry, and light. Idem. p. 430.

Sir James Lancaster in his East-Indy Voyage, in Sombrer^ found on the
Sea-sands a young twig growing up to a tree, and offering to pluck up the same,
it shrank down into the ground, and when it was by strength pulled up, a great
Worm was the root of it, and as the Tree grows in greatness, the worm
diminishes: This Tree plucked up, the leaves, and pill stripped off, by that
time it is dry is turned into a hard stone; so that this Worm was twice
transformed into different natures after a wondrous manner: Of these he brought
home many. P. Pil. v. 1. p. 152.

CHAP. CIV. Examples of rare, stupendous, and costly works made by the Art of
man.
A Description of Jerusalem, and the Temple, as they were when they were
destroyed by the Romans.
Jerusalem was compassed with a treble Wall David compassing it about with a
wall called it the City of David. The other hill called Acra was the place
whereon the lower part of the City stood: And opposite to this Acra was another
hill lower then it, which at first was divided from it by a large valley; but
when the Asmonaeans reigned, they filled up this valley, and cut down the top
of Acra that it might not hide the Temple: within one of the valleys was
Siloam, a fountain sending forth abundance of clear and sweet water: The
outmost wall, by reason of the valley about it, and rock whereon it stood was
impregnable the rather because besides the situation it was built very strongly
by David, Solomon, and other Kings. A fourth wall was begun by Agrippa: In
humane reason had this wall been finished, the City could never have been
taken: For he began to build it with stones 20. cubits long, and 10. cubits
broad, so that it could neither be easily undermined, nor battered with
Engines: but he built this wall but only 10. Cubits high, and then fearing
lest Claudius Caesar should think that he had a purpose to rebel, he gave it
over: yet afterward the Jews raised this wall 20 Cubits high: made a
battlement 2. cubits high, and the Tower 3. cubits, in all 24. cubits high:
Besides upon the wall were three Towers 20. cubits broad, and twenty cubits
high, built four square very strongly; within these Towers were rooms for men
to dwell in, and Cisterns to receive rainwater. The third wall had ninety of
these Towers, and between every Tower were two hundred Cubits space: The second
wall had fourteen Towers; and the old wall had threescore, and the compass of
the whole City was 33. furlongs. Between the North, and West-part of the City
upon the outmost wall stood the Tower Psephina, which was raised seventy Cubits
high; so that in a clear day a man might from thence discover Arabia, and the
utmost confines of the Jews even to the Sea. Just opposite to this was the
Tower Hippicos built by Herod upon the old wall, which for bigness, beauty,
and strength surpassed all others in the world: It had four corners, each of
which was 25. Cubits broad, as many long, and 30. Cubits high, and in no place
hollow: On the top was a Well to receive rainwater twenty Cubits deep. On the
Top of all were houses 25. Cubits high divided into many rooms: Above them
were battlements two Cubits high, and Turrets three Cubits high, so that in all
it was eighty five Cubits high. He built also a second Tower in breadth, and
length forty Cubits, and as many high in Figure of a square pillar, all solid,
and not hollow within: And above this, a porch ten Cubits high adorned with
Turrets, and Pinacles: Over the midst of this Porch he built another Tower
distinguished into goodly rooms, and sumptuous Baths; and on the top it was
beautified with Turrets, and Pinacles, so that the whole height was almost
fourscore, and ten Cubits: Lastly, he built a third Tower, which he called
after his Queens name, Mariamne twenty cubits high, and twenty broad, all of
solid stone, and not hollow, having more stately and magnificent lodgings in it
then either of the former: it was in all fifty five Cubits high. These Towers
though they were very high, yet by reason of their situation they seemed far
higher: For the old wall whereon they were built stood upon rock that was 30.
Cubits high, whereby their height was much increased: They were not built also
of ordinary stone, but all of white Marble, whereof each stone was 20. Cubits
long, and ten Cubits broad, and five Cubits thick; and so curiously joined
together that every Tower seemed but one stone; within the City was the Kings
Palace surpassing all that can be spoken of it, and for greatness, and curious
workmanship may be compared with any other in the world: It was environed with
a wall 30. Cubits high, adorned with goodly Towers round about: Beautified with
houses for an hundred of the Nobility: The variety of the Marble wherewith it
was built was admirable, all sorts being therein used, though never so rare to
be found. In every room also were many vessels of gold, and silver, and many
Porches round about adorned with most curious Pillars: There were in it very
many pleasant walks adorned with all sorts of trees, and gardens beset with
Fountains that spouted up water on high, and Cisterns beautified with many
brazen Statues from which ran out water continually.

The Temple was built upon a Rocky Mountain;

The way to the inward Temple was all enclosed within it was twenty five Cubits
high: At the top of the fourteen stairs within the wall was a level compassed
with a wall of three hundred Cubits, which had eight Gates in it; and between
the Gates were Porches opposite each to other reaching from the wall to the
Treasury, supported with great, and stately Pillars. All the gates were covered
with Plates of gold, and silver, only one was covered with Corinthian brass,
which for beauty far excelled the other, dazzling the eyes of the beholders: In
every gate were two doors, each of them thirty Cubits high, and fifteen broad;
and on each side they had seats 30. Cubits long, and 40. Cubits high, each one
supported with two Pillars twelve Cubits thick: Only the Gate which was*
covered with Corinthian brass was fifty Cubits high, the Gates were forty
Cubits, and it was more richly adorned then the rest.

The Holy of Holies was situated in the midst curious hangings of the same
length, admirably wrought with purple, violet, and Scarlet silk, all the
fabric was so exquisitely, and richly wrought, that none could possibly
imagine any workmanship that it wanted: For it was all covered with a massy
plate of pure gold which dazzled the eyes of the beholders: The top was all set
with rods of gold, sharp like pikes at the ends, lest birds should sit thereon,
and defile it. The stones wherewith it was built were forty five Cubits large,
five in length, six broad, and as many long. Josephus l. 6. c. 7.

CHAP. CV. A Description of old Rome, and the chief raririties thereof.
ROme when it was first built was but ^2 miles in Tiber at Rome is four hundred
foot broad, and so deep that it will carry ships of the greatest burden. Its
about sixteen miles distant from the Sea. It was almost round in compass. The
suburbs in process of time grew so great, that Aurelian the Emperor built new
walls, which were amost fifteen miles in compass: and again, the suburbs in a
little time grew so great that one of them was fifteen miles long, and raught
even to the Sea, and in Augustus his time there was numbered in Rome above three
hundred, and twenty thousand poor people that received relief from the public:
Besides, the number of bondmen was very great: few rich men but they had an
hundred, and some four hundred a piece: Seneca says in his time that the
inhabitants were so many that the spacious and innumerable houses were scarce
able to contain them: that a great part of them were foreigners that came from
all parts of the world to live there: So that the number of inhabitants was
reckoned to be at least four millions. These people were sustained with
provisions brought out of all Nations; so that Rome seemed to be the common
Mart of the whole world. Heliogabalns to show the greatness of the City caused
all the spiders to be gathered and put together, which being weighed amounted
to ten thousand pounds weight: and a great Plague breaking out at Rome for many
days together there died ten thousand persons. The houses were generally built
very high, that so they might be the more capcious, insomuch as Augustus was
feign to make a Decree that their buildings should not exceed seventy foot in
height, conceiving that they marred the delicacy of the air by their overmuch
shadow: but this extended only to private men's houses, for the great men were
not limited. But besides, the great height of the houses, they were beautified
by the matter whereof they were built, by the Architecture, and by the Symmetry
of them, wherein Art, and Elegancy strove for priority. And for that end what
exquisite workmen soever Greece, or Asia brought forth, they were either sent
for, or came of their own accord to beautify this Imperial City, especially in
Augustus's time, who made his boasts, Marmoream se relinquere, quam lateritiam
accepisset: that he should leave Rome built of Marble, which he found built of
Bricks. Nero also when he had burned a great part of it, at his own charges
built it up again, beautifying it with excellently composed streets, large
ways, and curious porches to all the houses, which three things were a great
Ornament to the City: whereupon Cassiodorus says, Our forefathers tells us of
the seven wonders of the World: The Temple of Diana at Epesus: The costly Tomb
of King Mausolus: The brazen Statue of the Sunin the Isle of Rhodes called the
Colossus. The Image of Jupiter Olympicus made by Phidias: The house of Cyrus
King of the Medes, and Persians built by Memnon: The walls of Babylon built by
Semiramus: And the Pyramides of Egypt: But now (says he) the City of Rome is
the greatest miracle of them all. There were in it four hundred twenty four
Temples erected to their Idol-gods.

There were two Capitols in Rome; The old built Numa, the new, begun by
Tarquinius Priscus, and Superbus, finished by Horutius Pulvillus Consul, upon
the Saturnian, or Tarpeian, or Capitoline hill. It was eight acres, or eight
hundred feet in compass, almost four square. It was ascended unto by one
hundred steps on the South part which looked toward the Marketplace, and
Palace. It would hold eight thousand men. It was covered with brasse-tiles all
gilt with gold. There were three Chapels in it; to one of which ( viz.
Jupiter's) Augustus gave sixteen thousand pound weight of gold, and jewels
worth almost as much more, twelve thousand Talents were spent in gilding of it.
The gates were covered with thick plates of gold.

Next after the Capitol, the Pantheon is worthily Agrippa son in Law to
Augustus in the year of the City 729. The Architecture of it was admirable, the
beauty, and proportion of all the parts most exquisite: The breadth of it was
one hundred and forty four feet, and the height as much: It was wholly covered
over with very great tiles of brass richly gilt. In the Reign of Trajan it was
burnt by lightning, and rebuilt by Hadrian.

The Temple of Peace was built by Vespasian, three Jerusalem, and were brought
from thence by Titus at the sacking of it. It was burnt down in the time of
Commodus either with fire from heaven, or arising out of the earth after a
little earthquake.

There were an infinite number of Baths both Rome. Some of which baths were all
paved with plates of silver, and set with rows of Pillars for ornament.
Antoninus's bath had sixteen hundred slates of polished Marble in it.

The Appian Cawsey was built by Appius Claudius Rome to Capua, the bounds of
the Empire that way, at that time; which was afterward lengthened to
Brundisium by Julius, and Augustus Caesar, in all three hundred and fifty miles
long, and so broad, that two Coaches might easily pass by one another, being
about 25 foot broad. It was made of hard flinty stones, hewn and laid so close
together, (yet without any mortar or claspes of iron) that it seemed all of one
stone; the stones were three, four, and five feet square: nine hundred years
after it was made the stones were not one whit disjoynted, or broken: Ever and
anon on the sides were stones whereon persons might sit, or lay their burdens,
or get on horseback, and at every miles and, high stones (or pillars) were
raised, whereon were engraven the number of the miles. Likewise there were many
Monuments on both sides with witty inscriptions, or pretty inventions on them,
yielding both matter of mirth, and seriousness to the travelers.

There were fourteen (says Pliny) twenty (says P. Victor) Aquaeducts in Rome;
the chiefest of which was the Claudian, began by Caligula, and finished by
Claudius; So big as a man might ride on horseback in it; brought forty miles
to the City in a level, through the Mountains, and over the Valleys; as high as
the highest hill in the City: seven millions and a half were spent in making
it. There were besides in the City one thousand three hundred fifty two lakes
or great receptacles of water for common use.

The Cloacae or common sewer, were made by Tarquinius Priscus; they were so
wide, that a Cart laden with hay might pass along them, viz. sixteen foot
wide, and as many high. There were seven chief arms from the seven hills
(besides several smaller from other parts) which ran into the main Channel.
Notwithstanding all the weight of building upon them, and several earthquakes,
they remained firm almost eight hundred years. And at one time when they were
out of repair* there were a thousand talents spent in repairing of them.

There were an infinite number of Statues, or Domitian the Emperor commanded
that no statues should be made for him in the Capitol, but such as were all of
silver, or all gold, solid, and not hollow, each of them weighing at least an
hundred pound weight. Commodas the Emperor had a Statue made for him of gold
that weighed a thousand pound weight: Together with a Bull, and a Cow of the
same metal as if he had been the founder of the City. He had also in the
Marketplace a Pillar erected, and his Statue made upon it of a thousand five
hundred pounds weight of silver. Their statues of brass were most of them
gilt, and so were many of their Statues of silver. Some of them were of a
Colossaean bigness; others mounted on horseback, and in^several postures, and
habits: For the preserving of all which from hurt, there was one who was called
Comes, or an Earl, whose office it was continually to walk up, and down in the
night attended with many Soldiers, that none might wrong them, and besides it
was death for any man to do it. Lipsius de Mag. Romans Imperii.

Trajan built a Bridge over the River Ister, or Danon, of twenty Arches, each
one hundred and fifty feet high, sixty thick, and one hundred and seventy
distant one from another, in all four thousand seven hundred and seventy feet,
which was almost a mile long. The River was very deep and swift, and the bottom
not firm ground, neither could the stream be diverted any other way: all which
much augmented the difficulty of the work.

Ancus Martius the fourth King of Rome built Tybur, yet without nails, or
pins, so that in time of war it was taken down; afterward AEmilius built it
of stone: and lastly, Antoninus Pius built it of Marble.

one year finished the Walls which contained in circuit four hundred and eighty
furlongs, or sixty Italian miles: they were two hundred soot high, and fifty
foot thick: the River Euphrates ran through the midst of it: over which she
built a strong, and stately bridge, binding each stone to other, with clips of
iron fastened with molten lead. These walls were one of the seven Wonders of
the World.

Semiramis her Obelisk described.
Semiramis Queen of Babylon caused an huge Obelisk, Pyramid, to be cut out of

to Babylon, where she erected it, to be matter of admiration to future ages.
Diod.

The Rarities in old Babylon described.
Within the huge, and stately City of Babylon was hundred and fifty Towers.
Semiramis also built in the same City a stately Temple to Jupiter Belus four
square, each side containing two furlongs with brazen gates: In the midst was
a solid Tower of the height, and thickness of a furlong: upon this another,
and so one higher then another, eight in number: In the highest Tower was a
Chapel, and therein a fair bed covered, and a table of gold, in the top of
this Chapel she placed three golden Statues: One of Jupiter forty foot long
weighing a thousand Talents (each Talent containing sixty three pounds, and
almost ten ounces): Another of Ops weighing as much sitting in a golden Throne,
at her feet two Lions, and hard by huge Serpents of silver each of thirty
Talents. The third Image was of Juno standing, in weight eight hundred Talents:
To all which was a common Table of gold forty foot long, and twelve broad,
weighing fifty Talents. There were also two standing Cups of 30 Talents, and
two vessels for perfume of the like weight: Besides three other vessels of gold
weighing twelve hundred Talents: all which the Persian Kings after their
conquest of it took away. Herod.

Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon with its Rarities described.
Nebuchadnezzar, after he came to it having conquered Belus with their spoils,
and added a new City to the old without the same, which he compassed about with
three walls, and made in them stately gates: and near his fathers Palace he
built another more stately, wherein he raised stone works like unto Mountains,
which he planted with all manner of trees; He made also Pensile Gardens (one of
the Worlds Wonders) born up on arches four square, each square containing four
hundred foot, filled above with earth wherein grew all sorts of trees, and
plants: the arches were built one upon another in convenient height, still
increasing as they ascended: the highest which bare the walls were fifty Cubits
high: he made also Aquaeducts for the watering of this Garden. He erected also
an Image of Gold in the plain of Dura six hundred Cubits high, and six broad:
These stately buildings made him so to boast; Is not this great Babel that I
have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power, and for the
honor of my Majesty? Herod.

form of a sumptuous Summerhouse, where he often solaceth himself with variety
of Objects, and from whence taking barge he passes to the delightful places of
the adjoining Asia. In this Seraglio also are many stately rooms appropriated
to the seasons of the year, which are called Rooms of fair Prospect, into which
the Sultan goes sometimes alone, but more usually with his Concubines for his
recreation. Within a fine little Court adorned with very many delicate
Fountains is the Chamber wherein he gives audience to Ambassadors, etc. one
part whereof is spread with very sumptuous Carpets of Gold, and Crimson velvet

with Heroical Letters resembling the Agulia of Rome, in whose top were the
enclosed ashes of Julius Caesar; In the same Piazza also is a great Pillar of
brass made with mavelous Art in form of three Serpents wreathed together
with their mouths upward.

CHAP. CVII. Hyspaan described.
THe City of Hyspaan in Persia was formerly called Hecatompolis by reason of

then there comes broad cloth into London. This City is much to be commended for
Civil Government: For an idle person is not suffered to live amongst them; the
child that is but six years old is set to labor: no ill rule, disorder, or
riot is suffered there. They have a Law amongst them whereby every person is
compelled to give his name to the Magistrate, withal declaring by what course
he lives: and if any tell untruly, he is either well beaten on the feet, or
employed in public slavery.

The Suburbs are very large, wherein also are many stately buildings, especially
a College being of a wonderful height, and great strength: Besides many other
Palaces, Colleges, and Temples. Here they have great store of Poultry: For in
certain Ovens built upon sundry lofts they put abundance of Eggs; which Ovens
being kept in a moderate heat will in seven days hatch all those eggs into
chickens. P. Pil.

The Egyptian Pyramids described.
In Egypt are diverse stupendous structures called Pyramids, the greatest
whereof is situated on the top of a rocky hill which rises above the plain
about an hundred feet, with a gentle, and easy ascent, the height of the
situation adding beauty to the work, and the solidity of the rock giving the
superstructure a permanent, and stable support: each side of this Pyramid is
six hundred ninety three feet according to the English Standard; so that the
whole Basis contains four hundred eighty thousand two hundred, and forty nine
square feet, or eleven English acres of ground. The height is the same with the
breadth, viz. six hundred ninety three feet. The ascent to the top is contrived
in this manner: From all the sides without, the ascent is by degrees; the
lowermost step or degree is about four foot in height, and three in breadth
which running about the Pyramid in a level, makes on every side of it a long but
narrow Walk; the second row is like the first, retiring inward from the first
three feet, and so runs about the Pyramid. In the same manner is the third row
placed above the second, and so in order the rest like so many stairs rising
one above another to the top, which contains about nine foot square. The
degrees by which men ascend are not all of an equal depth, for some are about
four foot, others scarcely three, and the higher they ascend the more they
diminish both in breadth, and thickness: so that a right line extended from
any part of the Basis to the top, will equally touch the outward angle of every
degree.

These are all made of Massy, and polished stones, hewn out of the Arabian
Mountains which bound the upper part of Egypt, being so vast, that the breadth
and depth of every step is one single, and entire stone, so that in most of
them is contained thirty feet of stone: The number of these steps is two
hundred and seven.

On the North side ascending thirty eight feet upon an artificial bank of earth
there is a square, and narrow passage leading into the inside of this Pyramid
containing in length ninety two feet, and an half: The structure of it has
been the labor of an exquisite hand, as appears by the smoothness and
evennesse of the work, and by the close knitting of the joints: it is now an
habitation for great ugly batts of about a foot long: At the end of this
entrance you must climb up a massy stone, eight or nine foot in height, where
you enter into a Gallery, the pavement consisting of smooth, and polished white
Marble; the breadth is about five foot, and the height the like: the length of
this Gallery is an hundred, and ten feet: At the end whereof begins a second
Gallery, a very stately piece of work, and not inferior either in respect of
the curiosity of Art, or richness of materials, to the most sumptuous or
magnificent buildings: It Is divided from the former by a wall; At the end
whereof is a Well about three feet in the diameter, the sides whereof are lined
with white Marble, it is eighty six Cubits in depth, hewn through the rock on
which the Pyramid stands: Beyond the Well about fifteen foot is a square
passage, the stones whereof are exceeding massy, and exquisitely joined, which
contains one hundred and ten feet, at the end whereof is an arched Vault, or
little Chamber, the length about twenty feet, the breadth seventeen, the height
about fifteen. The length of this second Gallery before mentioned is 154 feet,
of white, and polished Marble both roof, walls, and bottom; the joints are so
well knit that they are scarce discernable: The height of this Gallery is
twenty six feet, the breadth six feet, bounded on both sides with two banks,
like benches of polished Marble; At the end of this gallery you enter into a
square hole which brings you into a little room lined with rich, and speckled
Thebaick Marble, out of which through another passage being all of Thebaick
Marble most exquisitely cut, you land at the North end of a very sumptuous, and
well proportioned room wherein art seems to contend with nature, the curious
work being not inferior to the rich materials: It stands in the heart, or
center of the Pyramid, equidistant from all the sides, and in the midst
between the Basis, and the top: The floor, sides, and roof are all made of
vast, and exquisite tables of Thebaick Marble: From the top to the bottom are
but six ranges of stone, all of an equal height. The stones which cover this
room are of a strange, and stupendous length, like so many huge beams lying
flat, and traversing the room, and bearing up that infinite weight, and mass
of the Pyramid above. Of these there are nine which cover the roof; the length
of this room is thirty four English feet: the breadth somewhat above seventeen
feet, the height nineteen feet and a half. In the midst of this glorious room
stands the Tomb of Ch^ops of one piece of Marble, hollow within, and sounding
like a bell, but empty: For (says Diadorus) although the Egyptian Kings
intended these for their Sepulchers, yet it happened that they were not buried
therein: For the people being exasperated against them by reason of the
toilsomnesse of these works, and for their cruelty, and oppression, threatened
to tear in pieces their dead bodies, and with ignominy to throw them out of
their Sepulchers, wherefore they commanded their friends when they were dead to
bury them in some obscure place. The Tomb is cut smooth, and plain, without any
sculpture, and ingraving: the outsides contain in length seven foot, three
inches, and a half. In depth it is three foot, and almost four inches, and the
same in breadth: The hollow part within is something more then six foot long,
the depth is somewhat above two feet: whereby it appears that men's bodies are
now as big as they were 3000 years ago: For it is almost so long since this Tomb
was made. This Pyramid was 20 years in making, and yet there were three hundred
threescore, and six thousand men continually working about it, who only in
Radishes, Garlicks, and Onions are said to have consumed eighteen hundred
Talents. Collected out of Mr: Greaves, a curious observer of it.

The Egyptian Mummi's described.
Not far from this Pyramid in Egypt are the Mummi's Egyptians into which are
descents not unlike to the narrow mouths of Wells, some near ten fathoms deep
leading into long vaults hewn out of the Rock with pillars of the same.
Between every Arch lie the corpses ranked one by another of all sizes, which
are innumerable, shrouded in a number of folds of Linen, and swathed with
bands of the same, the breasts of diverse being stained with Hierogliphical
Characters: The Linen being pulled off, the bodies appear solid, incorrupt,
and perfect in all their dimensions; whereof the musculous parts are of a brown
color, hard as stone-pitch, and has in Physic the like operation, only more
sovereign. To keep these from putrefactions, they drew the brains out at the
nostrils with an iron instrument, replenishing the head with preservative
spices: then cutting up the belly with an Ethiopian stone, they took forth the
bowels, cleansed the inside with Wine, and so stuffing it with a composition of
Myrrh, Cassia, and other odours they closed it up again: The like the poorer
sort effected with Bitumen fetched from the Lake of Asphaltites in Jury,
whereby they have been preserved till this day, having lain there for about
three thousand years.

The Lake of Maeris described.
Maeris, one of the Egyptian Kings, undertook, Memphis, the circumference of it
contains CD. CD. CD. DC: furlongs; the depth of it is fifty fathom, or three
hundred feet; many myriads of men were employed for many years about it. The
benefit of it to the Egyptians, and the wisdom of the King cannot be
sufficiently commended: For seeing the rising of Nilus is not always alike,
and the Country is more fruitful by the moderatenesse thereof: He dug this
Lake to receive the superfluity of the water, that neither by the greatness of
the inundation it should cause Marshes, or by the scarcity of water the earth
should not yield her strength, he therefore cut a ditch from the River to this
Lake of 80 furlongs, and three hundred feet in breadth, by which sometimes
receiving in, and sometimes diverting the River he gave a sufficient quantity
of water to the husbandmen. After the Kings name it is called the Lake of
Maeris. In the midst of it he built a Sepulcher, and two Pyramids each of
them of an hundred fathoms high, placing upon them two Marble Statues sitting
on a Throne, one for himself, the other for his wife, seeking hereby to get an
immortal memory. The Revenues of the fish of this Lake he gave to his wife for
to buy her unguents, and other ornaments: the fishing being worth to her a
Talent a day: For it was mightily replenished with Fish of twenty two sorts; so
that very many were continually employed in salting of them. Diod. Sic. Herod.

Porsennah's Tomb described.
Porsenna King of Hetruria, not far from the City Clusium built for himself a
Monument of square stone, each side of it was three hundred foot broad, and
fifty foot high; within which square Basis there was an inextricable labyrinth,
into which whosoever adventured without a clue could find no passage out. Upon
this square he erected five Pyramids, four in the corners, and one in the
midst; in the bottom they were seventy five foot broad, and each of them one
hundred and fifty foot high, on the top was one brass circle, and covering for
them all, from which there hung bells fastened with chains, which being moved
with the wind, gave a sound afar off: Upon this brazen circle stood other four
Pyramids, each of them one hundred foot high; and upon them (being covered with
another plain) were again erected five other Pyramids, the height whereof my
Author was ashamed to name: so foolishly did he waste the wealth of his
Kingdom, that in the end the commendation of the Artificer should be the
greatest. Pliny out of Varro; and Greaves out of him.

The Great Mogol's Palace described.
In the City of Agra the Great Mogol has a Palace Pur. Pil. v. 2. p. 1474.

The Rhodian Colossus described.
In the Isle of Rhodes stood one of the worlds seven Colossus made of Brass in
the form of a man standing with his two legs striding over an haven under
which ships with their Masts and Sails might pass, it was threescore, and ten
Cubits high with all the parts proportionable, and all gilt over. When Muani
the fifth Caliph of Babylon overcame Constance the Emperor in a Sea Fight, and
had taken the Isle of Rhodes, this Image being formerly thrown down by an
earthquake, was sold by him to a Jew, who loaded nine hundred Camels with the
Brass of it. Theoph. Pez. Mel. Hist.

Admirable Works done by the Art of man.
Protogenes the Rhodian an exquisite Painter bestowed Apelles beheld, he stood
amazed at the excellency of the workmanship, so that for a while he could not
speak, but afterward he said, This is an admirable work, and of huge labor,
yet he wants an Orator to extol his workmanship to the skies. When King
Demetrius besieged the City of Rhodes, he took the Suburbs, and in them this
picture, whereupon the Citizens sent to him, requesting him not to deface it;
to whom he answered, That he would sooner burn the picture of his Father, then
hurt a piece of such admirable workmanship. Diod. Sic. Plut.

Anno Christi 1610. amongst other rare Presents Sophy of Persia to the King of
Spain, were six drinking glasses so exquisitely tempered, that they could not
be broken. Turk. Hist. page 1273.

About six miles from Salisbury upon the plains Cicero calls insanam
substructionem. For within the circuit of a ditch there are erected in the
manner of a Crown, in three ranks, or courses one within another, certain
mighty, and unwrought stones, whereof some are twenty eight foot high, and
seven broad; upon the heads of which others like overthwart pieces do bear, and
rest crossewise with tenants, and mortesses, so as the whole frame seems to
hang, whereof it is commonly called Stone-henge. Camb. Brit.

In Westmer land hard by Shape there be huge stones Pyramids, some of them nine
foot high, and fourteen foot thick, ranged directly as it were in a row for a
mile in length with equal distance almost between them. Camb. Brit. p. 762.

CHAP. CVIII. The Temple of Diana described.
THe Temple of Diana at Ephesus was one of the Jupiter was made by one Canesia:
some say of Ebonie; others of the vine which had many holes made, and filled
with Spikenard the moisture whereof closed up the rifts. It was enriched, and
adorned with gifts beyond value. Herod.

The Hill Amara in AEthiopia described.
In Ethiopia under Prete Janny, commonly called Prester, or Presbyter John, is
an hill called Amara, situated in the navill of the Ethiopian body under the
Equinoctial line, adorned with all variety of fruits, wholesome air, pleasant
aspect, and prospect: yea Heaven, and Earth, Nature and Industry have all been
corrivals to present their riches to it. It stands in a great plain, having no
other hill near it by thirty leagues, the form of it is round: the rock is cut
so smooth without any unequal swelling, that to him that stands beneath, it is
like an high wall: the top is overhanged with rocks, jutting forth for the
space of a mile: It Is above twenty leagues in the circuit, compassed with a
wall on the top well wrought, that so neither man, nor beast in chase may fall
down. The top is a level, only toward the South is a rising hill beautifying
this plain, whence issues a pleasant Spring which passes through all that
plain, and paying its tribute to every Garden that will exact it, and making a
Lake at length, whence issues a River that from thence runs into Nilus. The
way up to it is cut out of the rock not with stairs, but by an easy ascent,
so that one may ride up with ease, at the foot whereof is a fair Gate with a
Corpse du Guard: Half way up is a fair, and spacious Hall cut out of the rock
with three large windows to it, and at the top is another gate with the like
Guard: The air above is wholesome, and delectable, so that they live long there
without sickness: There are upon it thirty four Palaces standing by
themselves, spacious, sumptuous, and beautiful, where the Princes of the
Royal blood have their abode with their Families. There are two Temples also,
the most beautiful in all Ethiopia: There are many flourishing, and fruitful
Gardens, curiously made, and plentifully furnished with European fruits, as
Pears, Pippins, etc. and of their own, as Oranges, Citrons, Lemons. etc. It Is
also adorned with Cedars, Palm Trees, etc. as also with variety of herbs, and
flowers to delight the sight, taste, and sent: There are also Cubaio Trees,
pleasant in taste beyond all comparison, and great store of Balm-trees. There
is plenty of all sorts of Grain, and Corn, and such charms of Birds as delight
the ear with their melodious warbling notes, and pleasing the eye with their
variety of colors, and other creatures that adorn this Paradise.

The aforenamed Churches have their Pillars, and Roofes of stone, richly, and
cunningly wrought, the matter, and workmanship contending for magnificence:
That of Jasper, Alabaster, Marble, Porphyrie; This of printing, gilding, and
much curiosity: To these are adjoining two stately Monasteries; in one whereof
are two rare pieces whereon wonder may justly fasten both her eyes. The
Treasury, and the Library of the Emperor, neither of which is thought to be
matchable in the world; neither that of Constantinople wherein were one hundred
and twenty thousand Books; nor that of Alexandria, wherein were seven hundred
thousand Books: For the number in this Library is numberless, their price
inestimable. There are three great Halls, each above two hundred paces large,
with Books of all Sciences written in fine Parchment with much curiosity of
golden Letters, and other works, and cost in writing, binding, and covers:
There are all the Greek Fathers: The Writers of Syria, Egypt, Africa, and the
Latin Fathers, with others innumerable in Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Abyssine,
Egyptian, Syrian, and Chaldee. There are Poets, Philosophers, Physicians,
Rabbis, Talmudists, Cabalists, Hieroglyphics, etc.

The Treasury leaves them of all other Princes behind it. It Is a Sea that every
year receives new Rivers, which never run out: every Emperor yearly laying up
part of his revenue there. The Jewels here kept are incomparable, Topazes,
Amethists, Saphires, Diamonds, etc. He has one Jewel that was found in the
River Niger, (that brings forth more Gemmes then any other in the world) which
is one piece diversified with a thousand variety of stones. It Is about two
span^, and an half square: there are in it one hundred and sixty Diamonds, one
as large as the Palm of ones hand: It has in it above three hundred Emeralds;
Rubies the greatest in the world: Above fifty Saphires, Turqueses, Balazes,
Amethists, Spin^ls, Topazes, Jacinths, Chrysolites, etc. Nature here playing
the Jeweller, and representing a Mapp of the worlds Gemmes in this one Jewel
without, and infinitely beyond all Art of Man. Bernardo de Vecheti, a Jeweller,
being sent thither by Francis de Medicis Duke of Florence to see it, accounted
it beyond all estimation, and value. The Emperor also has made him Tables
with thousands of stones set in them.

In this hill are kept the Princes of the Blood Royal as in a prison, and never
return thence except they be chosen Emperors. Anno Christi 1608. there were
six of them: These meet altogether when they please to recreate themselves by
hauking, hunting, etc. and they have grave persons to instruct them in
learning, and virtue. Purchase Pilgrimage. p. 677, etc.

The admirable Highways in Peru described.
In Peru in the West Indies are two admirable Ingas, or Emperors: The one is
by the Andes or Forests from Pasto unto Chile, being nine hundred Leagues
long, the Cawsey five, and twenty foot broad; and every four leagues has a
stately house where was provision of victuals, and apparel, and every half
League, men that stood ready to carry messages, and orders from hand to hand.
The other Way was through the Plains along the coast of twenty five foot broad,
and on each side a wall of a man's height from Piura to Chile where both the
ways met. This latter way was between trees that yielded a very pleasant
shadow in those hot Countries, and both of them began at the Imperial City of
Cuzco. P. Pil. v. 3. p. 887, 888.

There belonged also to the Incas a Garden of silver Maiz, Quinua, Pulse,
Fruit Trees with fruit on them all of gold, and silver resembling the natural.
In the Incas house they had heaps of wood all counterfeit of gold, and silver.
All the vessels (which were infinite) for the Temple-service, Pots, Pans, Tubs,
Hogsheads were of gold, and silver, yea the spades, and pickaxes for the Garden
were of the same. At the taking of this City by the Spaniards the Image of the
Sun fell to one Captain's share, who lost it one night at dice, whereupon they
said, That he had played away the Sun before it was up. P. Pil. v. 4. p. 1464,
etc.

Cusco the Imperial City of the Incas in America, Spaniards first took it, had
in it a Temple of the Sun, all the walls whereof were covered with plates of
gold from the top to the bottom. At the East end was the Image of the Sun of
one plate of gold as thick again as the other: the face was round with rays of
gold like flames of fire, all of one piece: It was so big, that it filled all
from one wall to the other. On both sides were the bodies of their deceased
Kings, embalmed, set in seats of gold placed on planks of gold: All the doors
about the Temple were lined with plates of gold; without the Temple on the top
of the walls ran a champhered work of gold above a yard broad round about the
Temple: Beyond the Temple ran a cloister of four squares, round about the top
whereof was such a crown of champhered gold above a yard broad: In the corners
of the cloister were Chapels; One whereof was dedicated to the Moon, all which
with the Gates thereof were covered with plates of silver: the Image was
placed, as that of the Suns, with the face of a woman, all of one plank of
silver. The next Chapel was dedicated to Venus, and the Stars, lined also
with silver, and the porch of silver. The third was dedicated to the Thunder,
and Lightning: The fourth to the Rainbowe; which two last were all lined, and
garnished with gold. Hard by was an house for the Priests all lined with gold
from the top to the bottom. There were twelve doors to the Cloister, and as
many Tabernacles or Shrines which were all plated over with gold in form of
Porches, and the floores covered with gold. The Images were all set with
Turkesses, and Emeralds. In the house also were five Fountains of water wherein
they washed the sacrifices: out of them the water ran in Pipes of gold; and
many of their pillars were of gold hollow, and some of them of silver.

CHAP. CIX. Pequin the now Regal City of China described.
PEquin is in compass thirty Leagues, environed Triumphall Arch, shut up at
nights, in the chief whereof are Watch-bells. There are one hundred and twenty
large Channels of water, and over them eighteen hundred rich, and fair bridges:
There are in this City one hundred and twenty Shambles, one hundred and twenty
Marketplaces; besides in every street five or six shops wherein they sell
flesh, poultry, and Bacon. There are without the City sixteen hundred
Garden-houses belonging to persons of principal note: And twenty four thousand
Sepulchers of Mandarines [Justices of Peace] with their little gilded Chapels,
encompassed with Grates of Iron, and Latten with rich Arches at their entries.
The Gardens, Groves, Tanks, and Fountains have their walls lined within with
fine Porceland which makes a gallant show. There are also store of other houses
with great walls in which are Gardens, and Groves with game for hunting which
belong to several companies.

A Description of Mosco the Imperial City of Russia.
Mosco the Regal City of Russia is almost round, London, environed with three
strong walls circling the one within the other, and with many streets lying
between: The inmost wall, and the buildings within it, fenced, and watered with
the River of Moscua that runs close by it, is all accounted the Emperors
Castle. The number of houses, being formerly reckoned, was forty one thousand
five hundred. The streets instead of paving are planked with Fir-trees plained,
and laid even, and close the one to the other. The houses are of wood without
any lime or stone built very close, and warm with Firre-trees, which are
fastened together with notches at each corner. Betwixt this timber they thrust
in Moss to keep out the air, so that they are very warm; the greatest danger
is their aptness for firing whereby much hurt is many times done in that City.
P. Pil.

A Description of Venice, with her Rarities.
This Wonder of Cities is seated in the bosom Adriatic Sea: It is built upon
sundry Islands, and is (as it were) chained together by many Bridges. The
occasion which made these watery Isles a mansion for men, was, when that
Northern Deluge of Goths, Vandals, Huns, and Longobards did overflow all Italy,
the people of all sorts fled to these Lakes to avoid the Land torrent that was
like to swallow them up; and finding the air to be gentle, and fit for
habitation, and propagation, they pitched their Tents upon these Isles, and
associated them by conjoyning Bridges. There are seventy two Isles that support
Venice. and the nearest part of the Continent is five miles distant: There are
banks, and ditches cast up to preserve her from the impetuousnesse of the waves
of the Sea, extending in length above six miles. She is above eight miles in
circuit, and has of all sorts about a thousand Bridges. Besides there be above
twenty thousand Gondolaes, or Boats which ply up, and down perpetually, in each
of which are two rowers at least, so that upon occasion she can suddenly make
an Army of above fifty thousand Gondoliers.

Her Fabriques public, and private are extraordinary specious, and sumptuous,
and her streets so neat, and evenly paved, that in the depth of winter a man
may walk up, and down in a pair of Satin Pantables, and Crimson Silk
stockings, and not be dirtied. There are above two hundred Palaces fit to
receive any Prince with his ordinary retinue: Her situation is so rare, every
street almost having an arm of the Sea running through it; and her structures
so magnificent, and neat, that she ravisheth therewith all strangers that come
to visit her.

She has in her one hundred and fifty Churches, and Monasteries: but
especially three things worthy of sight, viz. St. Mark's Church, and Steeple;
the Treasury, and the Arsenal.

S. Mark's Church is built throughout with rare Mosaique work, and yet the
furniture of the Church surpasses the Fabrique in richness; Her walls are
inlaid in many places with precious stones of diverse colors, and in such a
manner that they seem rather to be the work of Nature then of Art.

It Is built in the form of a Cross, whose corners are highly vaulted, and
covered with bright Lead, as all the rest of the Church is. The whole Bulk is
supported with most curious Arches joined together by mavelous Art. The
inside from the middle to the highest part thereof glistereth with gold, and
the concavity of the vaults is enriched with diverse curious, and antic
pictures. That which is from the gilding down to the pavement is excellently
joined together with goodly Tables of Marble, by whose pleasant veins in form
of rays the eyes of the beholders are rather fed then satisfied. The seats
below are of an extraordinary red stone like to Porphyrie, the Pavement is all
of Marble engraven with diverse Figures wholly different, and of various
colors: There are sundry Columns and Tables of Parian, Spartan, and Numidian
work that environ the seats on both sides the Quire. The entrance into the
Church on both sides is in a manner of the same trimming; while gilded Arches
are sustained without by more then three hundred exquisite Pillars, the space
between those Pillars being filled with choice Tables of Marble. On the height
of this entrance are four great brazen horses all gilded over, in a posture as
if running, and neighing. All this bears up the highest top of the Church
divided into six Steeples, every of which is like a Pyramid, and has on the
sharpest point thereof a white Marble Statue of a naked man standing upright.
Diverse other representations delightful to the eye, and wrought with exceeding
skill do beautify the spaces between the Steeples, and all that which is
vaulted underneath is covered with gold. In sum, there is no place in the whole
Church, either within, or without, but it is either adorned with Marble, gold,
or precious stones; so that the two Columns of Alabaster, and the Chalcedony
stones which are in the midst of the pavement are accounted the least
curiosities.

The Arsenal of Venice is one of the greatest Magazines Arsenal has Arms to
furnish two hundred thousand men, and has constantly belonging to it two
hundred Galleys in Dock* or abroad in course, besides Galliasses, and Galleons,
with all provisions necessary for them.

The Treasury of St. Mark is cried up through Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires,
Emerauds, Cups of Agate of an huge bigness. The great Diamond which Henry the
third gave when he was made a Gentleman of Venice: There you may see an Armor
all of massy Gold, beset all over with great Pearls, Turkies, Rubies, and all
manner of precious stones in such a quantity, and bigness, that they alone
would make a rich Treasury. There are also twelve Corslets of Gold beset with
precious stones. There is an huge gold Chain that reaches from Pillar to
Pillar: Diverse Chests of Gold, and amongst others one great Iron Chest with
this Inscription, When this Chest shall open the whole Earth shall tremble.
There are two large Unicorn's horns. A great Bottel made of a Chalcedonian
stone transparent, and clear, which will hold above a quart. There is a Garnet
of a vast size formed into the shape of a Kettle which will hold near a Gallon.
There are many Crosses, and Crucifixes of massy Gold beset with Jewels of all
sorts: There are the Crowns of Cyprus, and Candie, as also that of the Dukes
of Venice all inlaid with choice rich Diamonds, great Rubies, Emerauds,
Saphires, and other stones that would beget astonishment in the beholders. In
that of the Dukes there is one great Rubie worth an hundred thousand Crowns.
There are Cups of sundry forms cut out of rich stones, with Dishes of sundry
kinds. There are diverse Presses full of Plate, huge, and massy, with Statues
of silver, and large Chalices of gold, and variety of other rich things, the
worth whereof no eye is able to judge. There are moreover twelve Crowns of
massy Gold which were taken at the sacking of Constantinople when the French,
and Venetians divided the spoils. Pacheeo the Spanish Ambassador coming to
see this Treasury, fell a groping whether it had any bottom and being asked
why? answered; In this amongst other things my great Master's Treasure differs
from yours, in that his has no bottom as I find yours to have. Alluding to the
Mines in Mexico, and Potosi.

In one of its Islands called Murano Crystal Glasses are made, where you may
see a whole street or the one side having above twenty Furnaces perpetually at
work both day, and night. If one of these Furnaces be removed to any other
Island, or but to the other side of the street, though they use the same men,
materials, and fuel, yet can they not make Glass in the same perfections for
beauty, and luster as in this place. Howels Survey.

Padua described.
Padua is a City within the Venetian Territories, Anno Christi 1222. She is
famous every where for a Seminary of the best Physicians, and has a Garden of
great variety of Simples. It was formerly girt with a trebble wall: but a
double contents her now, which has very deep ditches round about: For the
River Brent with vast charges, and labor was brought to this City which has
much advantaged her both for strength, and Navigation: It Is situated in a most
pleasant, and plentiful plain, enjoying a sweet temperate Clime, with a
singular good soil by reason of the neighborhood of the Eugonian Mountains on
the West side of it. Her circumference is near upon seven miles; Her Temples,
and dwelling houses both public, and private are more magnificent then
elsewhere. She has six stately Gates: Five large Marketplaces; within the
Walls twenty two great Churches, twenty three Monasteries, twenty nine
Nunneries. She has the most renowned Hall for public Justice of any City in
Italy, covered all over with Lead, and yet propped by no Pillars. The
Council-Court has Gates, and Columns of Marble; She has twenty eight Bridges
Arched over the Brent which runs through her. She has very spacious Piazza's:
She has six Hospitals, three for the poor, and three for Pilgrims. She has a
place called Monte de Pieta, set up on purpose to root out the Jews usury, who
used to demand twenty per Cent: for Brocage: She has other two Hospitals for
Orphans, and poor children. There are thirty eight thousand Crowns deposited in
the hands of several persons of Quality to whom the poorer sort may repair with
their pawnes, and if it be under thirty shillings they pay no use for their
money, if it be above they pay five per Cent: for relieving the poor.

The City of Millan described.
The City of Millan in Italy lies within a stately Lorenzo there stand sixteen
Marble Pillars being a remnant of the Temple of Hercules. But of all the
Churches the Cathedral is most costly. It Is all of white Marble, and about it
are five hundred Statues of the same: There is a late building added to it
which is very glorious, especially for the huge Pillars of Granito, an
excellent sort of Marble: Private men's houses also in Millan are not inferior
to those of other Cities in Italy. The streets are of a more then common
breadth, and there are very many Gardens within the Walls. The greatest
Hospital in Italy is that in Millan, which is a square of Columns, and Porches
six hundred Roods about, seeming fitter to be a Court for some King, then an
Hospital for the poor. The Castle in Millan is accounted by all Engineers the
fairest, and strongest Citadel in Europe. Raimund's Mer. Ital.

The City of Naples described.
Naples the Metropolis of that Kingdom stands Mediterranean Sea: It Is reckoned
the third City in Italy, and so great are the delights that nature has
allotted to this place, that it is still frequented by persons of great quality.
The streets of it are generally well paved of free stone, large, and even: The
Houses are very uniform, built flat on the top to walk on; a notable
convenience in those hot Countries. Another like accommodation which this City
has against the heat, is the Mole, which is an Artificial street casting it
self into the Sea, whither all the Gentry at the evenings resort to take the
Fresco. Amongst the Palaces that of the Vice-Kings is the fairest: It has
three Castles; and the Churches generally are very curious, and costly filled
with Marble Statues. This City is exceeding populous, and consequently vicious:
He that desires to live a chaste life must not set up there: For as their
Gardens are well filled with Oranges, so their houses want not Lemmons; there
are usually thirty thousand Courtesans Registered that pay taxes for their
pleasure.

Near unto Naples is Virgil's Tomb upon an High Rock: And the Crypta
Neapolitana in the rocky Mountain Pausylippus, cut through, very high, spacious,
and well paved, so that for the space of a mile two Coaches may go on Front
under the earth: In the midst is a Madonna with a Lamp perpetually burning.
Not far off is the hill of Brimstone on which neither grass nor any Herb
grows; but it is all white with ashes, and ever casts out of several holes a
contin^^l smoke, with Flames making the very earth to boil. The ground is
hollow underneath, and makes an hideous noise if struck upon with an hammer. On
the other side Naples is the Mountain of Vesuvius, brother to AEtna, upon the
top whereof is a terrifying spectacle, viz. a Vorago, or hole about three miles
in compass, and half as much in depth, and in the midst is a new hill that
still vomits thick smoke which the fire within has raised within these few
years, and it still daily increases. Pliny the Naturalist being too
inquisitive after the cause of this fire, changed life for death upon this
Mountain. Idem.

The City of Florence described.
Florence is the Capitol City of Tuscany situated Arno, over which are built
four Bridges of stone; upon one of the two chief is the Goldsmiths street: upon
the other, which is a very stately structure, stand the four quarters of the
year in Marble: Opposite unto which stands a vast Column with a Statue of
Justice in Porphyrie at the top: Hard by is the Palace of Strossie admirable
for the immensity of its Fabric; on the left hand whereof is the Merchants
Vault supported with many fair Pillars, and before it a brazen Boar jetting
forth water: Before that is the great Place in the midst whereof is the great
Duke Cosmus on horseback in brass, near unto which is a Fountain the like to
which Italy affords not. Round about the Laver is the Family of Neptune in
brass, with his Colosse of Marble in the midst, born up by four horses. In
this same Piazza is a Porch arched and adorned with some Statues, amongst which
that of Judith in brass, with the rape of the Sabines, three persons in
several postures cut all out of one stone. Just against it is the Palazzo
Vechio, at the entrance whereof stand two Celossi, the one of David, the other
of Hercules trampling on Cacus, excellent pieces. Within is a Court set about
with Pillars of Corinthian work. Above is a very spacious Hall with diverse
Statues. Near to it is the richest of Treasures, the Great Duke's Gallery, in
the uppermost part whereof are contained as many wonders as things: some to be
admired for the preciousnesse, and Art; others for their Rarity, and antiquity:
On each side of the Gallery stand above fourscore Statues: One an Idol brought
from the Temple of Apollo in Delphos: Another of Scipio Africanus holding up
his gown under his Arm: Then two curious Triumphant Pillars: Over the Statues
hang rare pictures, the most famous Scholars on the one side, and Soldiers on
the other.

At the right hand of this Gallery are several Stanza's full of curiosities,
wherewith the spectators are astonished both in regard of the richness, and
rarity thereof. In the first Room is an Altar totally compacted of Jewels, and
precious stones: The value inestimable. In the next is a Table with Flowers,
and Birds in their natural colors of precious stones, with a Cabinet worth two
hundred thousand Crowns covered with Agates, Emerauds, Amethists, etc. Within
it is the History of Christ's Passion, with the twelve Apostles all in Amber.
In the third is a Cabinet with Calcedonie Pillars, filled with ancient Medals
of gold. Round about this Room are an infinite number of Natural, and
Artificial curiosities: As the Emperor's head cut on a Turquoise bigger then a
Walnut, with thousands more. Next is the Armory, wherein are the habits, and
diverse sorts of Arms of several ages, and people. There is likewise a
Loadstone that bears up fourscore pounds weight of Iron. In the last Cabinet is
the curious turned works of Ivory; A Pillar of Oriental Alabaster, etc. In
another Room are twelve great Cupboards of silver Plate of all sorts, and
another of all pure Massy Gold. A Saddle all Embroydered with Pearls, and
Diamonds; besides many other things of great worth.

From hence is a private passage to the Duke's Court on the other side of the
River: The front of which edifice is very Majestique, toward the Basis of
Dorick work, in the midst of Ionick, and the uppermost story of Corinthian.
In the Court is a Grotto with Statues, and a Fountain over it; and a Loadstone
of a most prodigious greatness.

The Gardens belonging to it for their largeness have the Face of a Forest,
for their variety of a Paradise. Here are Cypress Groves, their Walks with
Statues: Here a Sea of Fountains; There Swans, Ostriches, and other delighting
Creatures.

The Cathedral Church is of a vast Bulk, and exquisite workmanship, made of
Red, White, and Black Marble. The Cupola is so high, that the brass Globe at
the top will hold sixteen persons: No less excellent is the Steeple composed
of the same stone, and materials with the Church, but with more Art, and
Ornaments.

The Chapel of St. Laurence seems more then terrestrial: It Is wholly overlaid
with fine polished stones, neither is there any color upon Earth but it is
there in stones naturally. Near to this is a famous Library filled with great
variety of Manuscripts. In brief, the Houses of Florence are generally built
high, the streets are paved with great stones even, and large, and adorned with
many excellent Fountains, and other public Ornaments.

The chiefest Cities of Italy are thus usually distinguished: Rome the Un-Holy;
Venice the Rich; Naples the Gentle; Florence the Fair; Genoa the Proud; Millan
the Great; Bolonia the Fat; Padua the Learned; and Verona the Ancient. Idem.

The first Invention of Printing.
Laurence Jans, a rich Citizen of Harlem in the Low Countries, walking forth
one day into the neighboring Woods for recreation, began to cut in pieces of
wood the letters of his name, printing them on the back of his hand; which
pleasing him well, he cut three or four lines which he beat with Ink, and
printed them upon Paper, wherewith he much joyed, and determined to find out
another kind of Ink more fastening, and holding, and so with his kinsman Thomas
Peterse, found out another way to print whole sheets, but of one side only,
which are yet to be seen in the said Town: afterward he changed his letters of
Wood into Lead, and after that into Tin, and so by degrees this famous Art of
Printing grew to perfection. Belg. Com. Wealth. p. 57.

The first Invention of Guns.
A German Friar of the Order of St. Francis called Bertholdus Swart, being very
studious of Chemistry, as he was one Evening (for the finding out of some
experiment) very busy in tempering Brimstone, Sulphurous powder of dried
earth, and certain other ingredients in a Mortar which he covered with a stone:
when it grew dark he took (...) tinder-box to light him a candle, a spark
whereof by chance flying into the Mortar, caught hold of the Brimstone, and
Saltpeter, and firing with (...) sudden flash blew up the stone. The cunning
Chemist guessing which of his ingredients it was which wrought this effect,
never left till he found out the certainty, and then taking an iron pipe he
crammed it full of the said ingredient together with some stones, and so
putting fire to it he saw that with great fury, and noise it discharged it
self: Soon after which he communicated this his Invention to the Venetians,
who, having been often vanquished by the Genowaies, did by the help of these
Bombards, or Guns, give them a notable discomfiture, Anno Christi 1380.
