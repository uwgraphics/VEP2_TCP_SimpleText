An Excellent New Ballad,
To the Tune of How Unhappy is Phillis in Love.
[1]
LEt Oliver now be forgotten,
His Policy's quite out of Doors;
Let Bradshaw and Hewson lie rotten,
Like Sons of Fanatical Whores:
For Tony's grown a Patrician,
By Voting damned Sedition,
For many years,
Famed Politician,
The Mouth of all Presbyter Peers.
[2]
Old Tony a Turn-coat at Worster,
Yet swore he would mantain the King's Right;
But Tony did Swagger and Bluster,
Yet never drew Sword on his side.
For Tony is like an old Stallion,
He has still the Pox of Rebellion,
And never was sound;
Like the Camelion,
Still changing his Shape and his Ground.
[3]
Old Rowly's returned (Heavens bless him,)
From Exile and Danger set free;
Old Tony made haste to Address him,
And swore none more Loyal than He:
The King, (who knew him a Traitor,)
And saw him squint like a Satyr;
Yet through his Grace,
Pardoned the Matter,
And gave him since the Purse and the Mace.
[4]
And now little Chancellor Tony,
With Honor had feathered his Wing,
And carefully picked up the Money,
But never a Groat for the King:
But Tony's Luck was confounded;
The D. who smoakt him a Roundhead;
From Head to Heel
Tony was sounded,
And Y -- soon put a Spoke in his Wheel.
[5]
But now little Tony in Passion,
Like Boy that had nettl'd his Breech,
Maliciously took an occasion,
To make a most delicate Speech;
He told the King like a Croney;
If e're he hoped to have Money,
He must be Ruled:
Oh fine Tony!
Was ever Potent Monarch so Schooled?
[6]
The King issues out a Poclamation,
By Learned and Loyal Advice;
But Tony possesses the Nation
The Council will never be wise:
For Tony is madder and madder,
And M -- blows like a Bladder,
And L -- too,
Who grows gladder,
That They Great York are like to subdue.
[7]
But Destiny shortly will cross it,
For Tony's grown Gouty and Sick,
In spite of his Spiggot and Fawcet,
The Statesman must go to Old Nick:
For Tony rails at the Papist,
Yet He himself is an Atheist;
Though so precise,
Foolish and Apish,
Like Holy Quack or Priest in Disguise.
[8]
But now let this Rump of the Law-see,
A Maxim as Learned in part;
Who e're with his Prince is too saucy,
It Is feared he is a Traitor in's Heart:
Then Tony cease to be witty,
By buzzing Treason in the City;
And love the King,
So ends my Dity;
Or else let him die like a Dog in a string.
