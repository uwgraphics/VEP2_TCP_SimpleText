THE CASE Of Sir Nathaniel Napper, Baronet.
Elected one of the Members for the Town and County of Poole, to Sit in the
Convention the 22d of January Instant.
THAT the said Town and County of Poole has, by Prescription, always Elected
Members for Parliament by their Mayor and Burgesses only, as by all the Returns
ever since 12 Edw. IV. appears.

That Sir N. Napper, with H. Trenchard Esquire was duly Chosen by the Majotity of
such as have Right to Vote, to Serve in this Convention, and was then Returned
by the Sheriff (in terminis) Elected according to such Ancient and Customary
Usage, and according to His Highnesses Letter.

That the Sheriff also has returned Tho. Chaffin Esquire Elected by the
Commonalty, though they never before did, or had a Right to Elect.

That the Merits of this Cause and Return was heard by the Committee of
Elections on Monday last, and the Majority by 12 of the said Committee then
Voted for Mr. Chaffin.

That if the Election by the Commonalty be allowed, it will, by this Example,
let in the Commonalty for the Future, and not only at present Exclude Sir N.
Napper, but also destroy the Mayor and Burgesses Ancient and Customary Right of
Election, as aforesaid, for the Future.

It is therefore most humbly Requested, That this Cause may be heard at the Bar
of this Honorable House.
