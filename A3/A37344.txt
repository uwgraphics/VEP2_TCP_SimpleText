ON BEHALF OF THEMselves and the whole Army, showing the grounds of their
present advance toward the City of LONDON.

OXFORD, Printed by J. HARRIS, and H. HILLS, Printers to his Excellency Sir
THOMAS FAIRFAX, Ann. Dom. 1647.

A DECLARATION Of his Excellency Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX, and his Council of War,
on behalf of themselves and the whole Army, showing the grounds of their
present advance toward the City of LONDON.
WHen this Army was formerly led, by the manifold dispensations of Gods
providence, and the grounds then declared to advance toward the City of
London, we held it our duty to yield the Kingdom the some of these desires,
which we had to propose, on behalf of it and our selves, where in we should
acquiesse: And having received from the Parliament some hopes of due
satisfaction therein, and some assurance from the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and
Common Council of the City of London, of their ready concurrance with us in
those things: And also great resolutions professed by them of their care and
tenderness, to preserve all the rights and privileges of Parliament safe.
free, and inviolate from attempts of all kinds; we do appeal to Cod, to the
City, and to all men, what a speedy compliance their desires for our removal
to a further distance found in this Army: For preventing all fears, ielousies,
and other inconveniences to the City, and to give clear testimony that we had
nothing in our breasts but thoughts of peace, and the good and welfare both of
Parliament, City and Kingdom; notwithstanding many falce and scandalous
reports raised, that we saught our selves, that we had vile and wicked ends,
and that nothing would satisfy the Soldiers but the plunder of the City, and
contrary whereof did manifestly appear, when they so readily marched back upon
hopes of satisfaction in their desires of public concernment.

Having then upon the aforesaid confidence so with-drawne, and out of a just
sense of the Countries suffering (by quartering) removed the head quarter of
the Army above forty miles from London, and dispersed the rest well nigh two
hundred miles, for the more ease of all parts; and that we might give the
better satisfaction to the Kingdom; and being in this secure way, and
laboring after the sudden settlement of the Kingdom, we had even brought to
perfection the particular proposals, (included in the generals of our first
Representation) to be sent to the Parliament for a final conclusion of all our
troubles; and also had made good progress toward the present relief of
distressed Ireland, by assigning a competent force both of horse and foot
forthwith to have advanced for that service.

But the Kingdoms and our enemies being most vigilent and active to prevent
and frustrate those good intentions and endeavors of ours (that they might
carry on their former evil designs, and underhand practices, and also preserve
themselves from the hands of Justice) they have endeavored to cast the
Kingdom into a new and bloody war, and for that end have procured the
underhand listing of several Reformadoes and others: Have contrived,
promoted, and caused to be entered into by several persons, a wicked and
treasonable combination, as is sufficiently manifested by a Declaration passed
thereupon by both Houses of Parliement the three and twenteth of July last, for
prevension of the disturbances that were like to ensue thereupon: From which
kind of disorders, the City had bin well preserved during the space of almost
four years, whilst the Militia was in the hands of the old Commissioners)
wereby it appears there was cause for the Army to entreat the Parliament that
the Militia might be returned into the hands it was in before, as also for
diverse other good reasons.

First, the old Commissioners of the Militia (that have been since left out)
were not only persons without all exception, having been formerly chosen and
approved by the Parliament, and City, but also men of whom the City, Parliament
and Kingdom, have had above four years experience in the faithful discharge
of their trust; men that ever from the beginning, in the worst of times, and in
the occasions of greatest difficulty, had faithfully and constantly engaged for
and with the Parliament in this cause: Men that were always most desirous of
peace, but of a safe and well grounded one, and that had always testified a
great ^are to prevent all occasions of embroyling the Kingdom in a new War;
Now that on a sudden this Trust which they had faithfully discharged so long,
should be taken out of their hands, and put into the hands of others, some
whereof (at the best) have been very cool in the service of the Parliament at
the beginning of this War; That this should be pressed, and in a manner forced
upon the Parliament, with such importunity from the Common Council, that some
out of every Ward should be appointed to solicit the Members of the House of
Commons every day as they went in and out at the House, with Professions, that
they would never leave the door of the House, till they were satisfied in
their desires; That they would not be contented with the Militia of the City of
London only, unless they might have power over that of the Suburbs and
outparts; and all this before the peace of the Kingdom was settled, or the
propositions sent to the King for that purpose. These things ministered great
cause of suspicion, that this alteration of the Militia was in order to a
design, and to make the terms of the peace and agreement with the King (on
which the security of the whole Kingdom and their posterity is to be bottomed)
more suitable to the private bargainings and undertakings of some men, then to
the public welfare of the whole Kingdom in its security and prosperity, for
the present and in future times. But this Design discovered it self more
clearly by such things as accompanied the pursuit of this alteration of the
Militia, and ensued upon the obtaining thereof; At the same time that the
alteration of the Militia was set on foot, the same persons with as much
earnestness pressed for the disbanding of this Army, before any thing was
settled for the security and liberties of the Kingdom. At the same time the
Common Council was new modeled, and a Lord Major chosen that might suite with
the present Design in hand; At the same time (in color of difference^ in some
circumstances of Church Government) it was earnestly endeavored that such as
had been constantly true and most faithful to the interest of this Kingdom,
should be disabled to have any employment in Church or Commonwealth either in
England or Ireland; And without any such color or pretense, diverse persons
were left out of the Common Council, and Militia, of eminent dese^^^ and
fidelity, and others brought into their rooms, that had either testified an
ill ^ffection, or little ^ffection to the Parliament and their Cause; And such
as seemed to withdraw themselves from all employment in the beginning of this
war, now at the winding up thereof, are ambitious to thrust themselves into
employments, with a Design (as may justly be suspected) to frustrate and
overthrow and overthrow in the Close of all the fruit and effect of all the
cost and blood that has been spent and spilt in this Cause. And after that
with difficulty, and not without reluctance in the Houses of Parliament, they
had obtained the power of the Militia in the City of London, and also in the
outparts for the space of one year: Many chief Officers and under Officers in
the Trained bands of known trust and fidelity were displaced, and others of
more doubtful affection placed in their rooms; little ear was taken of the
honor of the Parliament, which was continually trampled under foot, and their
authority affronted by every rabble of Women, Apprentices, Reformadoes and
soldiers; which latter sort of persons were thereby so encouraged to rise
higher and higher in their tumultuous carriages against the Houses, till at
length it is risen to the height of barbarous and monstrous violence against
the Parliament, that they might set themselves on works, and the Kingdom on
fire again: And now at length the Design appears open faced, and though the
Militia be made as the principal ground of the quarrel, yet by the late vow
and engagement set on foot before any alteration of the Militia; and the
pressing so much the Message of the 12 of May, and the Kings coming to London
to confirm the same, show, that the Militia is desired but in order to that
Design, and to force the Parliament (being wholly in their power) to such
terms of peace as they pleased.

In the next place, when the interest of the Common Council in their change of
the Militia shall be claimed as the birthright of the City of London (which
they never had any color to pretend to) swing by the indulgency of the
Parliament unto them since this Parliament, in respect of the great use they
have had of them, and the many good servites they have received from them) it
is time for all the Kingdom to look to their Birthrights, if such a claim
shall be help up against both Houses of Parliament: That upon no occasion
whatsoever, nor in no time of danger and distraction whatsoever, they may
appoint these that shall have the power of the Militia of London without the
consent of the Common Council especially, when as the Houses shall sit under
their power; The late example may evidence to all the world who shall be
Masters of the Parliaments freedom and resolutions: And Common Reason will
teach every man who shall be Masters of their Birthrights of the whole
Kingdom, when there shall be no Army on foot, when they have the confidence to
dispute for the Mastery, notwithstanding such an an Army as this to check and
balance them in behalf of the Kingdom and Parliament.

Lastly. The Army discerning how intimate some of the new Militia were with
some of the eleven accused Members; how forward they were to comply and act
with them in their endeavors to raise a new a new War; how they made
eighteen or nineteen votes in order thereunto together with them, in one
night; All which the Common Council and Parliament disliked and revoked, how
notwithstanding they secretly promoted their Designs by private Listings,
which now appears to have been still working under ground.

The Army, we say, observing this, and having nothing more in their thoughts
and desires, then to settle a speedy safe and well grounded peace, and to
prevent a new War, found it necessary to desire, that the Militia might be put
into the hands wherein it was formerly, who had approved themselves both to the
Army, Parliament, and Kingdom, to be sober minded men, and not given to any
practices whereby a new War might be kindled; to the intent, that the Army
being secured by that means from that danger, might with the more confidence
retire farther from the City: enlarge their Quarter for the greater ease of the
Kingdom: and intend wholly the settling of a sure peace in this Kingdom, and a
speedy and effectual relief of Ireland; which was almost brought to a period,
and nothing in the sight of man could have hindered, but the cursed violence
upon the Parliament under pretense of the Militia; which according to our
desire being restored again into the hands of the Old Commoners by an
Ordinance of both Houses dated July the 23. (in pursuance of the aforesaid
reasonable combination) several Petitions were presented to the Common
Council and City of London in the name of the Apprentices and others,
importing their desires, That the Militia of the City might continue in the
hands of the former Commoners according to the Ordinance of the 4 of May last.
Whereupon Monday July the 26. the Common Council of the City presents their
petitions to both Houses for changing the Militia; wherein the House of Lords
refuse to alter their resolutions, the House of Commons answered they would
take it into consideration the next morning; Notwithstanding which, the City
and Kingdom cannot be ignorant with what rage and insolency the tumult of
Apprentices the same day forced both Houses; They blocked up their doors;
swearing they would keep them in till they had passed what votes they pleased.
They threatened the Houses if they granted not their desires: knocking, hooting
and hollowing so at the Parliament doors, that many times the Members could
not be heard to speak or debate; not suffering the House of Commons to divide
for determining such questions as were put, crying out that those that gave
their votes against them should be sent out to them; very often and loudly
crying, Agree, Agree, Dispatch, we will wait no longer; and in this outrageous
manner they continued at the House above eight hours together, the City guards
there present, nor the City releiving them; by reason whereof the House was
forced to vote what that rude multitude would demand, and then adjourned the
House till the next morning* After which the Speaker rising, the Speaker and
many of the Members going out of the House, they force them back again into
the House; many of the Apprentices pressing in with them, where they stood with
their hats on their heads, and compelled the Speaker to take the Chair, and
the House to vote in their presence what they pleased, committing many other
insolences, as is published by the Speaker of the House of Commons in his
Declaration* and is too well known by all then^^e sen^ And during the time of
this excerable violence done by the said Apprentices, Westminster Hall, and the
Palace yard was fils'd with Reformadoes, and other ill-affected persons
designed to back them. After this the Houses being adjourned till Friday
following, upon the Thursday the Apprentices printed, and posted a paper in
several places of the City, requiring all their fellows to be early at the
Parliament the next morning, for that they intended to adjourne by seven of
the clock, and that for a Month.

Thus the Speakers with many of the Members of both Houses were driven away
from the Parliament.

This being the true state of things as they have broke forth within these few
days, (which are so contrary to all those pretenses of Peace, and detestation
of a new War of late so frequently held forth on all sides) all men may
observe to what maturity the long projected design of some men, (of whom are
those that are impeached by us) is now brought and may be traced in the
several steps thereof, as it has tended to the inslaving this Kingdom, and
the destruction of all such well-aff^cted people, who would not comply with
them therein; so as by what now is come to light the justness of that Cause
this Army had engaged themselves in, and the great and wonderful Mercy of God,
in continuing them together, we assure our selves does now clearly appear, to
all men's eyes and apprehensions, and will every day more and more be
acknowledged, even by those that have heretofore made a question of it.

And if when this Kingdom has spent so much of it is blood and Treasure, has
past through such unheard of dangers, and overcome such Difficulties, so many
years together, All that they must now hope for, and rest in, must only be what
the King grants in his Message of the 12. of May last* And if this must be
imposed upon men's judgments and Consciences by an Oath and vow, entered into in
a tumultuous and unlawful way, and by outrage maintained in despite and
contempt of the Parliament: If rather then this should not be accomplished, the
Parliam^nt it self must be violated and forced into the hands of such of the
Members thereof, as have secretly fomented and abetted these practices to that
end, That these hidden Counsels, and works of darkness, might, when they
come to their full birth, have the Image of highest authority in the face of
them, the better to gain credit thereunto, and s^cure the Authors of them from
punishment; For the evidence of all which, we refer our selves to the
particulars in our charge against the eleaven Members, compared with those
passages of late broke forth, before rehearst: Unto which we shall now only
add, (and leave it to the consideration of all wise and good men) with what
Artifice and boldness these Members have served themselves of those horrid
tumults and violences of their own creating, (in stead of showing their
detestation of them) again to intrude themselves into the public mannaging of
affairs, and inevitably to embroyle the Kingdom in a new War: which their
own revenge, and the compassing of their former plots and designs makes them
so greedily thirst after. If these things (we say,) must be the end and upshot
of all, what then remains to this poor Kingdom, and all true hearted
Englishmen, but to join together as one man with their Counsels, Estates, and
Lives in this way, as our last refuge under God: which he by his wise and
gracious providence has provided and reserved, and keeping up this Army even
to a Miracle, so to prevent the aforesaid evils, and to procure to this dying
Kingdom, yet a settled Peace and happiness if it be his blessed will?

These things being seriously considered by us, we have thought fit in the
name of the Army to declare, that all such Members of either, House of
Parliament, as are already with the Army, or for the securing of their Persons,
and for the ends aforesaid, are forced to absent themselves from Westminster,
that we shall hold and esteem them, as Persons in whom the public trust of
the Kingdom is still remaining, though they cannot for the present fit as a
Parliament with freedom and safety at Westminster: And by whose advice and
Counsels we desire to govern our selves, in the managing these weighty
affairs: And to that end we invite them to make repair to this Army, to join
with us in this great Cause, we being resolved; and do hereby faithfully
obleige our selves to stand by them therein, and to live and die with them
against all opposition whatsoever. And in particular, we do hold our selves
bound to own that honorable Act of the Speaker of the House of Commons, who
upon the grounds he himself expressed in his Declaration sent unto us, has
actually withdrawn himself; And hereupon we do further engage to use our
utmost and speedy endeavors, that he and those Members of either House that
are thus enforced away from their attendance at Westminster, may with freedom
and security sit there, and again discharge their trust as a free and legal
Parliament. And in the mean time, we do declare against that late choice of a
New Speaker by some Gentlemen at Westminster, as contrary to all Right, Reason,
Law, and Custom; And we profess our selves to be most clearly satisfied in
our Judgments, and are also confident, the Kingdom will herein concur with
us, that as things now stand there is no free nor legal Parliament sitting,
being through the aforesaid violence at present suspended. And that the Orders,
Votes, or Resolutions forced from the Houses on Monday the 26, of July last, as
also all such as shall pass in this assembly of some few Lords and Gentlemen
at Westminster under what pretense and color soever are void and null, and
ought not to be submitted to by the freeborne Subjects of England: And that we
may prevent that slavery designed upon us and the Nation, and that the Kingdom
may be restored to the happy state of a visible Government now Ecclypsed and
darkened, we hold our selves bound by our duty to God and the Kingdom, to bring
to condign punishment the Authors and promoters of that unparaleld violence,
done to the Parliament, and in that to all the freeborne Subjects of England,
that are or hereafter shall be; And therefore we are resolved to march up
toward London, where we do expect that the welaffected people of that City,
will deliver up unto us, (or otherwise put into safe Custody, so as they may be
referred to a legal Trial) the eleven impeached Members, that have again
thrust themselves into the management of public affairs by this wicked
Design; And that all others will give us such assistance therein that the
Members of both Houses may receive due encouragement to return to Westminster,
there to sit with all freedom, and so to perform their trust, as shall
conduce to the settlement of this distracted Kingdom; And to inflict such
punishment upon those late Offenders, as shall deter any for the future to
make the like attempt.

We appeal to all the Kingdom, if we have not had a very tender care of the
City of London, there Commissioners will witness it; Our lives have not bin
dear unto us for the public good; And being now resolved by the assistance
of God to bring these Delinquents to their deserved punishment as that, then
which there cannot be any thing of more public concernment to the Kingdom, we
trust (if it shall come to that) our blood shall not be accounted too dear a
price for the accomplishment of it; And if any in the City will engage
themselves against us to pretect those persons, and so put the Kingdom again
into a new and miserable War, the Blood must be laid to the Account of such
persons as the Authors thereof.

And Lastly, because it is the main Engine, of ours and the Kingdoms enemy, to
render us odious, by possessing the minds of men that we gape only after the
plunder of this Great and wealthy City: As the experience of the contrary
carriage in all Towns, that we have taken, yields unto us a Testimony beyond
the example of any Army, so we do from our hearts declare, that we abhor the
thought thereof: And we doubt not but the World shall see our actions
answerable to our professions, and that we shall not cause any man to suffer
but by his own default, And that God will manifest, we have only in our eyes
that justice may have a free course, the Parliament a free Sitting and Voting,
and a full vindication of the late violence done to them.

And as for the City of Westminster, the Borough of Southwarke* the Hamlets,
and the rest of the Suburbs and out Parts, as we are informed. That they are
not so ready to engage themselves in a new War as some would have them, so we
are sensible of the hard condition that they are brought into, even by them
that claim a Right against both Houses of Parliament, (a strange claim
against a Parliament, though more reasonab^^ against others) not to be
subjected to a Militia without their own co^^^t, and yet will not be contented
unless they may have others subject^ unto them, and lay what burdens they
please upon them without ^^^owing them any part of Vote or consent with them;
In which point of Common Right and Equity we shall not be wanting (in a due
way) to assist them for the obtaining of their just desires and immunities: It
being our chief aim to settle Peace with Truth and Righteousness throughout
the Kingdom; And that none may be oppressed in his just freedom and
liberties, much less the Parliament it self. Which being duly settled, we
shall be as ready also to assure unto the King his just Rights and Authority,
as any that pretend it never so much, for the better upholding of an ill cause,
and the Countenance of tumultuous violence against the Parliament. The which
our honest just and necessary undertakings, as we are resolved to pursue, with
the utmost h^zard of our lives and fortunes, so we doubt ^ot but we shall find,
Gods accustomed goodness and assistance with us therein, till we have brought
them to a good and happy conclusion for this poor distracted and languishing
Kingdom.

By the Appointment of his Excellency Sir THOMAS FAIRFAX and his Council of
War. Colebrooke Aug. 3. 1647. JO. RUSHWORTH. Secretary.
