A PROCLAMATION Against Tumultuous Petitions.
CHARLES R.

WHereas His Majesty has been informed, That diverse evil disposed Persons at
this time, endeavor in several parts of this Kingdom, to Frame Petitions to
His Majesty for specious ends and purposes relating to the Public, and
thereupon to Collect and Procure to the same, the Hands or Subscriptions of
multitudes of His Majesty's Subjects; Which Proceedings are contrary to the
Common and known Laws of this Land, for that it tends to promote Discontents
amongst the People, and to Raise Sedition and Rebellion. His Majesty
considering the evil Consequences that may happen if such Offenses should go
unpunished, and lest that any of His good Subjects should be inveigled by
Plausible Pretenses, or should through inadvertency or ignorance, be engaged to
a Breach of the Laws in any of the Particulars aforesaid, His Majesty has
therefore thought fit (by the Advice of His Privy Council) to Declare and make
the same known by this His Royal Proclamation, and does hereby strictly Charge
and Command all and every His Loving Subjects, of what Rank or Degree soever,
That they presume not to Agitate or Promote any such Subscriptions, nor in any
wise join in any Petition of that manner to be Preferred to His Majesty, upon
Peril of the utmost Rigor of the Law that may be inflicted for the same. And
His Majesty does further Command all Magistrates, and other Officers to whom it
shall appertain, to take effectual Care, that all such Offenders against the
Laws, be Prosecuted and Punished according to their Demer^ts.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twelfth day of December 1679. In the One
and thirtieth year of Our Reign.
God save the King.
