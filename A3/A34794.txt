THE PREFACE.
THE Eminency of our Author is so well known to this present Age, that it were
to little purpose for me to imagine, that what I am able to say, would add any
thing to ^is Glory. Only this, his too much cry^ng up Parliament Privileges,
rendered him not so much a favorite of those former times as his worth merited;
^or his Books so vendible as they have ^^en since these late changes in
England: And therefore though this Treatise be of the Laws of England, sin^^
himself was so good a Common wealth man, I hope, for the Authors sake it wi^^
find no less acceptance in ^he Englis^ World, then if he had lived to mayntaine
what he in that Age durst avow and thereby appeared in his own natural and
proper colors. If in anthing I have erred in this Translation Charity can
pardon me, especiall^ when I shall affirm, that this was work of Charity in
my self (as I conceived) not to let so choice a metho^ of our English Laws
lie obscured in a language, which I know many of this Nation who were
wel-willers to the Law could not understand; and to those only it is intended.
And if it happen into any other hand, especially into such as hate the
profession of the Law, I do no ^^re regard their censure then they do the Laws
Precepts, which our Author te^^ us, are to live honestly, to do no injury to
any one, and to render every one their due.

Farewell.

THE First Book of the Institutes of the Laws of ENGLAND.
Of Justice and Law.
TIT. I.
JUstice is a constant and perpetual will of rendering unto every one their
Due. Bract. l. 1. c. 4. number. 2. Fl^t. l. 4. c. 1.


1. The knowledge or learning of the Law, is a knowledge of things both Divine
and Humane, and a Science distinguishing what is just, what unjust. Bract. l.
cod. number. 4.


2. The Precepts of the Law are these, To live honestly, to do no injury to
any one, and to render every one their due. Id. cod. nu. 6.


3. The Law is to be considered, either as public or private: We call that
the Law public, which appertains to the very Constitution of a
Commonwealth; and it consists in things holy, in Priests and Magistrates:
For it is necessary for a Commonwealth to have Churches, in which men may
address themselves to God, for the forgiveness of their sins: It is also
convenient to have Priests or Ministers, by whom we may be enjoined repentance
for our sins; and who may pray for us, and mediate to God on our behalf, for
his help and providence. And it is requisite likewise, That there be
Magistrates ordained, because by the means of those who are appointed to
precede as Judges, the Laws may be put in execution; for it were to little
purpose that there should be Laws, if there were not some to govern by those
Laws. Bract. l. 1. c. 5. number. 6.


4. That which we term Private Law, is that which chiefly belongs to the
utility of particular persons, and is secondarily necessary for a
Commonwealth, That no one abuse his own: And so on the other side, what is
necessary for a Commonwealth, is likewise secundarily requisite for the profit
of particular persons: And this private Law has three foundations, Viz.
Natural, National, and Civil. Bract. l. 1. c. 5. number. 3. Flet. 6. c. pri.


Of the Law of Nature and Nations, and the Law Civil.
TIT. II.
THE natural Law is that which nature, or rather God has instilled into all
Creatures. Bract. l. 1. c. 5. number. 4.


1. The National Law or the Law of Nations, is that which all Nations observe,
and which proceeds from the natural Law. Because the natural Law is that
which is common to all creatures, either on the Earth, in the Sea, or in the
Air. Id. l. 1. c. 5. number. 6.
From the Law of Nation comes the conjuncti^n of male and female. Plow. fol.
445.
And that which by common consent is called Matrimony. But this cannot properly
be termed a Law, because it is corporated and may be seen, for Laws are
incorporall, which descend and are introduced by the custom of Nations: But
from this Law proceeds the Procreation, and Education of Children. Id. 303. and
304.
And this Law of Nations is ^olely common to man, as Religion toward God; that
we may become assisting both to ^ur Parents and Country, and repel Force and
Injury. And from hence it comes, that ^hatosever we do for the Defense of our
own ^odies is adjudged legal. Bract. l. 1. c. 6. number. 7.
From the Law ^f Nations also are servitudes, Id. eod.
wars, di^tinct and divided Nations, several distin^uisht Kingdoms and
Dominions, Manumis^ons, setting of bounds to Land, the building together, and
neighboring of houses, by which means we have our Cities, Borroughs, and
Villiages. And generally to this Law of Nations may be referred, all manner of
con^^acts, and many other things. Id. l. 1. c. 5. number. 6, 7, 8.


2. The civil Law of England (usually ^^lled Common Law) is, (...), and ^ath a
threefold Acceptance. For first, it is ^^ken generally for that Law which the
En^^^sh use, distinguished from that of the Romans, and other Nations.
Secondly, It is taken for these two Courts of Judicature, commonly called the
Formerly Kings Bench.
Upper Bench, and the Common Pleas. For when we say, the cognizance of any
cause belongs to the Common Law, we did not intend to any Court Baron, County
Court, Pypowder Court, o^ any such Court, but to one of these two Judicatories,
who do most strictly judge all cause^ according to the rule of the Common Law,
Doct. and Stu. l. 2. c. 5. Eract. l. 1. c. 5. number. 5.
Although there be many cases in which, both in the Chancery and Fxchequer,
Process are issued upon Original. Writs, and judgment given according to
common Law. Plow. fol. 9.
And thirdly, It is taken for that Law which we term Statute Law Cook, l. 3.
f^l. 86.


3. The Law of England according to some has six principal foundations, viz.
The La^ of Reason, Plo. f. 316.
the Divine Law, the general customs, of the Kingdom, certain principle and
Maxims, particular Customs and St^tutes. Doct. and Stu. l. 1. c. 4.


But if we shall contract these more close* we may say the Law of England has
tw^ parts, Viz. Ancient Customs confirmed (...) the consent of the People, and
[formerly* the Kings Oath: And Statutes which (...) enacted by Parliament,
either as Supplem^nts or amendments to the aforesaid Customs; both which are
derived from the Law of Nature and Nations, as all other Law ^s whatsoever,
which, are either just (...) reasonable: And thus we fitly divide (...) Laws
into written and unwritten. Fortc. c. 13


There be others which make our La^ three fold. Viz. Common Law, Customs, and
Statutes. Cook, pref. l. 4.


4. Our written Law, at least that which is in use, is contained in Statutes,
Cook, l. 3. pres.
which were not made according to the Princes pleasure, but by the consent of
the whole Realm called together [formerly] by the King, for this purpose,
Fortes. c. 9. and 18 and Bract l. 1. c. 2. nu. 7.
yet we as [heretofore] the Kings approbation was necessarily required.

5. And in one p^rticuler the supreme pow^^ wheresoever it rest, [as, in times,
past the King] is above the Laws for that it, may grant privileges at
pleasure as to single persons, as to Corporations and Colleges, provided they
become not injurious to a third person. F. n. B. fol. 28.
In which if any douts arise, some say it self alone has sole power of
interpreting. Bract. l. 2. c. 16. number. 3. Brit. c. 63. Flet. l. 3. c. 14.
Although others ascribe this power also unto the Judges, that such Charrers
may receive construction according to the rules of law. Cook l. 1. Case
Altonwoods.


6. But sometimes it falls out, cases arise which are neither provided for, by
customs or Statutes sufficiently. And there the Judges do decide by like
reasons, proceeding accorcording to former Precedents: And for that purpose did
many times meat together to argue such cases. New terms of the Law, tit.
Demurrer.
But if any such disficulty, chances to happen which requires a higher search,
then judgment is recited until the next Parliament, by the council of which
Court it is determined. Bract. l. 1. c. 2. number. 7.


7. The unwritten Law consists of ancient customs of the Realm which are
observed for Law Bract. l. 1. c. 3. number. 2. Littl. l. 2. c. 10. Cook'l. 4. fo.
21
and to the observation of which our Kings at their coronations were obliged,
Fort. c. 34.
by Oath; notwithstanding any of these customs may be altered or nulled by a
Statute. Doct. Stu. l. 2. c. 5. Plow. 465.
A custom is either general or particular. A general custom is that which
is observed through the whole Realm, and is more properly termed by us a
common Right. Bract. l. 1. c. 1. nu. 2. etc. 3. number. 5.
A particular is that which is in force in diverse particular Counties, Cities,
Buroughs, Villages, and Manors. Cook l. 4. fol. 78. Doct. Stu. l. 1. c. 8.
and 10. N. l. Entr. tit. Customs. Kitch. c. Customs, fol. 102
The public Judicatories also of England have their customs likewise, which
are observed as strictly as Laws. Cook. l. 2. fol. 16. and 17. l. 4. f. 23,
24. and Stu. c. f. 93.
But any custom which is repugnant either to Law or Reason is to be abolished.
Plow. fol. 400.


8. Natural Laws or the Laws of nature are immutable, Plow. 88. Elet. l. 1.
c. 4.
But the Law of England may by the consent of those, by whose advise it was
first ordained to be altered. Bract. l. 1 c. 2. number. 7.
Yet so as it do neither oppugn Reason, or the Law of Nature.

9. Now that Law concerning which we shall treat at present, belongs only to
persons, things, or Actions, according to the Rights and Customs of England.
And because Persons are the most worthy, as for whose sake all Laws were
ordained: Therefore we discourse first of them, and of their states and Doct.
Stu. l. 1. c. 19. Speci^l. Justic. l. 3.
conditions, which are various and diverse. Bract. l 1. c. 6 Flet. l. 1. c. 1.


Of the Rights of Persons.
TIT. III.
THe first and shortest division of Persons is this, That all men are either
Free or Servants. Bract. l. 1. c. 6. Flet. l. 1. c. 1.


1. Now liberty is a natural faculty in every one to do what seems good to
them, so it be neither against Law or Authority. Bract. eod. nu. 2. and l. 2.
c. 19. number. 4.
Or it may be defined an evacuation of servitude, because it is directly
contrary unto it. Fl. l. 1. c. 2.


2. Servitude is a constitution of the Law of Nations; by which, contrary to
nature, one is subjected to another power; and it is so called from Servando,
and not Serviendo, for anciently Princes used to sell their Slaves and for that
cause they did reserve, rather then kill them. Brit. f. 77.
Wherefore when they were afterward set at liberty, they were called
Manumissi, as being delivered out of the hand. Bract. eod. number. 3. Brit. c. 31.
Spe. Just. c. 2. Flet. l. 1. c. 3.


3. Servants are either those which are borne so, or made so: Those which are
borne so, come from Natives, Father and Mother, whether they be married or not
(which is true both in Natives and them which are free Lit. l. 2. c. 11.
whether they be in the power of their Lord, or out of his power: Also that is
a Servant, whose Mother being a Native, is not married, notwithstanding that
the Father be free: Because in that case, as a common conception, it follows
the condition of the Mother. Bract. eod. n. 4. Brit. d. c. 31. Flet. l. 1. c.
3. Spec. Just d. c. 2.
And on the contrary, The Issue of a free Woman illegittimate, though begotten
by a Servant: And it is borne free because in our Law it is reputed, Nullius
filius. Bract. l. 1. c. 6. Instit. J^r. com. c 34.
Those which are Servants borne, we term Servants by Prescription; as those
also may happily be called Free by prescription, who have gained their freedom
through the negligence of their Lords. Bract. l. 1. c. 10. n. 13. Fl. l. 1. c.
7. and l. 4. c. 11. Dyer, fol. 60: n: 23.


4. Those which we call Natives are almost the same with those whom the Romans
called, Adscriptim gleba: namely those which served the Land, together with
their Lords: And were mancipated and aliened with their Estates. Bract. l. 1.
c. 6.
These we term Villains Regardants, Littl. l. 2. c. 11. Brit. c. 66. fol.
165. b. Bra. l. 1. c. 11. n. 1. 2. Spec. Just. l. 2.
because they do, Villis inservire. Of whom the Ancient Writers of our Laws
speak thus, A native Servant is such a one who is begotten by a Free man of a
Woman, who is a Villain, and lives in a Villainage, whether they be married or
not: But at this day, the Issue which is begotten by a Free man of a Native, is
free. F. W. fol. 78. G.


5. And so on the contrary, if a Villain go in unto a Free woman, the Issue
shall be free; but if it be begotten between the Villains of several Lords,
then it is material to observe in whose Villainage it was borne, and whom it
ought to follow, whether Father or Mother, according as they were either
married or unmarryed, or according as they were either within, or from under
the power of their Lords: Also if it be the Issue of a Freeman and a single
Woman a Villain the Issue shall be native, because it follows the condition of
the Mother. But if of a she Villain, and a Freeman marrying out of the
Villinage, and in Libero Thoro, it shall be reputed free, and see of a
Freewoman and Freeman. Bract. l. 1. c. 6. n. 4. Brit. c. 31. Fl. l. 1. c. 3.


6. Those which are made Servants, are made so by captivity from the Law of
nations. For when Wars began, captivity followed. A freeman may also be made
a villain by Law namely by his own confession and acknowledgement made in one
of the Formerly the King's Courts.
superior Courts Bract. l. 1. c. 6. n. 4. Brit. c. 31. and 43. Fle. l. 1. c.
3, 5. Lit. l. 2. c. 11.
A Freeman may also become a Villain according to the Ancients. Bract. l. 1.
c. 6.
If being once manumissed he shall happen to be called back again for his
ingratitude into servitude. But this by the means is uncontradicted, Fort. c.
46.
Also a freeman may be made a Villain, if at first being made either Clark or
Monk, he shall afterward return to a Seculer life, because such a one ought to
be restored to his Lord Brac. l. 1. c. 6. n. 4. Flet. l. 1. c. 3.
Those which are made Villains are called Villains in gross, because they are
of themselves without being appendant to any Estate. Lit. l. 2. c. 11
But all that are Villains in gross are not servants made. Because there may
be villain Issue between those which are our Captives, or by any other of this
way become Servants. Which we soon as born like the Issue of Natives fall
immediately into the power of the Lord.

7. A Freewoman is not made a Villain by marrying with a Villain, and this is
in favor of Liberty against the common rule of our Law which speaks, the Wife
to be the same flesh with the Husband. F. B. f. 78. G
And if a Freeman marry a Villain she shall be free. Id. eod.


8. But it is reported to be an ancient custom in Cornwall, that if a Freeman
took a Villain to wife to a freehold and free-bed if they have Issue two
Daughters the one shall be free and the oath villain. Brac. l. 4. tract. 3. c.
13. n. 2.


9. There is a condition of servitude which is termed Substantialis. For
whosoever is a Servant is so a Servant as that he is nothing else Brac. l. 1. d
c. 6. n. 3. Brit. c. 31. Flet. l. 1. c. 3. d.


10. And there is lastly a certain condition like to Servants which are yet
ingenious and freeborn To wit, those whom we call Apprentices who are bound by
their Parents or Governors to their Masters to learn Merchandising or other
mechanik trades, by Covenants. An. 5. Eliz c. 4. fol. 25.
And these are in the power of their Masters during the time covenanted, and
make gains, not for themselves or Parents, but for their Masters; unless it be
otherwise covenanted for a Covenant prevails above Law Brac. l. 2. c. 15. and
l. 5. tr. 2. c. 3. n. 7. and l 5 tr. 3. c. 9. n. 12.
These oblige themselves in many things, and chiefly in these namely. That for
the time covenanted they will truly and faithfully serve their Masters,
conceal their secrets, willingly obey al their lawful and honest commands.
That they will not commit Fornication within their Masters House or without,
that they will not go away within their time, nor be absent day or night, that
they will no ways damnifie him nor suffer him to be damnified in what they may
help but that they will with all their might endeavor to hinder his loss or
else fore warn him with all possible diligence, that they will not inordinately
imbezell their Masters Goods, nor lend them to others without his command or
special license, that they will not frequent Taverns unless to make bargains,
and therein to serve their Masters. That they will not to the prejudice of their
Masters, play at cards or dice, that they will not intermarry or contract
Matrimony with any woman during the said Term, that they will not trade with
their own or another Money without leave or license of their said Masters, but
that they will well and truly behave themselves in word and deed, as a good and
faithful Apprentice ought to do. Ne. b. Entr. Ver. coven. in Apprent:


Of Freeborn.
TIT. IV.
A Freeman is natural and freeborn, he is said to be free born who is free
so soon as born, whether born of two freeborn, or of a man freeborn and a
woman made free, or of a single woman and a Freeman Fortes. c. 42 Flet. l. 2.
c. 4.
provided it be not within a villinage but in a free bed, notwithstanding it be
out of the state of Matrimony. Vid. sup. tit. prox. par. 4. in fine.


1. So if of a Freewoman and a Villain out of Matrimony, and it is sufficient
that the Mother be frce at any time namely either (...) the time of conception,
parturition or in the intervall, notwithstanding that she become Villain
afterward because the misfortune of the Mother shall not prejudice the Infant
in the Womb. Brac. l. 1. c. 6. n. 5. Flet. l. 1. c. 4. Lit. l. 2. c. 11


2. So if a Freeman having Children do in Court acknowledge himself a Villain.
Those Children which he shall have after such acknowledgment shall be
villains, but those which he had before shall be free. Brac. ibi supra.


Of such as are made free.
TIT. V.
THose are said to be made free who are manumissed from a just Servitude. And
they are called free men as being set free from servitude: Brac. l. 1. c. 6. n:
6 Flet. l. 1. 4.
Manumission is a giving of liberty, that is a manifesting or declaring
according to soul, because liberty which is by the Law of nature cannot be
wholly taken away by the Law of nations, albeit it may be under a cloud. Brac.
l. c. 5. n. 8. Flet. and sup.


1. Manumission is twofold, namely, Expressed or tacit and employed. Dyer fo.
60 n. 23. and sa. 266 and 267. ^. 11.
Manumission expressed is also double. One which is by writing, as when the
Lord gives a Charter or instrument of Manumission to his Villain. And another
which is by fact and which was more used of old. As when the Lord in the
presence of his Neighbors, laying his hand upon the head of his Villain shall
say I will that this man be free, and having said this, letting him go out of
his hands shall put him from him. Brac. l. 1. c. 5. l. 8. Jemn. Ju. ver. manum.
Erit. c. 31. ^^.


2. Lambert in his (...), fo. 226.
Flet. l. 3. c, 13. and l. 4. c. 11.
describes the ancient forms of Manumission thus. If any one will make his
villain free let him with his right hand deliver him to the Sheriff in a full
County, and he ought to quit claim unto him the Bond of servitude by
manumission, and show him free Gates and ways and deliver him free Arms viz.
lance and sword, and then he is free.

3. Manumission employed is when a Lord shall bind himself by obligation to pay
a certain fum at a certain day to his Villain, or shall bring his action
against him for any thing which he may challenge as his own, or shall grant him
a yearly Rent, or make a Feoffment unto him of Land, or by Deed grant him an
Estate in Land for life or years, or finally do any such action which we are
not used to do but to freemen. Brac. l. 4. tr. 1 c. 21. n. 3. f. 192. b. and c.
22 Brook Tit. villena spec. Just. n l. 2. des Weiss.


If a Villain becomes a secular Priest, yet the Lord may claim him as his
Servant and seize his goods. Spec. Just. cod.
But if he shall enter into Religion it is otherwise, because there he is dead
in the eye of the Law. Lit. c. 2. c. 11.


In what causes Manumission cannot be.
TIT. VI.
THere are so few marks left at this day of servitude or of Villains that it
were to little purpose to prescribe a form of Manumission, and therefore our
Authors are silent in it. But that I may add one word for conclusion in this
place. Manumission ought to be bounden within the same limits in which other
lawful Acts are; So that neither an Infant nor one that is not Compos mentis,
nor one that has no right, may work any thing by it. All other things, unless
any thing be done to defraud, Creditors are left at pleasure.

Of the taking away the Law which was called, Lex Fusia Caninia.
TIT. VII.
NEither is there amongst us any the least use of this Law, which for so many
ages together, was by the Romans abrogated, as envious and cruel.

Of those which are in their own, and those which are under the power of
others.
TIT. VIII.
WE have discoursed before of the state of Persons, now we are to make another
division: And this is, that every one is either in their own power, or in the
power of others. Brac. l. 1. c. 9. Fet. l. 1. c. 5.


1. In their own power are all who are not subject to others: But we shall by
consequence know those which are in their own power, when we shall declare who
are under subjection to others. Brac. ib. ^. 2.


2. In the power of others are Servants; which power of Lords over their
Vassalls is by the Law of nature, and this was sometimes a power of life and
death: But now it is more restrained by our civil Law, so that now power over
life and lims, is only annexed to the Supremacy; so that he who shall kill his
Servant, shall be no less punished, then for killing a stranger, for it is
very necessary for the Common wealth, that no one do abuse their own: and in
this they have Law against their Lords, that they may have Justice against them
for life and limme, in case of any cruelty, or intolerable injury exercised by
their Lords. mahemium Lit. l. 2. c. 11.
As if you destroy them that they cannot enjoy their Wainage free and safe: But
this is true only in those Villains which hold in Ancient Demesne of the
Crown; for it is otherwise of others: Because when ever the Lord shall please,
he may take from his Villain his Wainage, together with all his other Goods
whatsoever. Brac. l. 1. c. 9. n. 3. Flet. l. 1. c. 5.


3. And as to freeborn People also, some are in the power of others, as Wards
under the protection of their Guardians or Friends, or under the tuition of
their Lords. Flet. l. 1. c. 9

10. Brit. c. 119. fol. 270. Flet. l 1. c. 6.


1. Those which are not ligitimate are not reputed Children, as in case of
Adultery and otherwise, nor those who are brought forth contrary to the form of
man kind: As Brac. l. 1. c. 6. n. 7. and l. 4. tr. 3, c. 13. n. 2. Flet. l. 1.
c. 5. and l. 4. c. 17. and l. 6. c. 56.
Monsters and Prodigies in nature, but those which are irregular only in
members, as having six fingers, or four, or only one, shall not for that be
esteemed illegitimate.

2. But we are to observe that, that ancient Jurisdiction which the Romans
exercised over their Children, Institut. Imperiales, cod. tit.
is much more qualified with us. For the English only take the profits of the
Labors of those Children which are under the age of twenty one years: And that
in such manner, that if they live at home with them they may do their own
notwithstanding that they are retained in their parents business, and that they
find them diet and clothing. But if they be put forth to learn any other
Arts, their Masters have the sole benefit of their work, unless any condition
forbid, for that a condition may prevail even against Law. Bract. l. 2. c. 5.


3. Whatsoever Estate whither adventitious or bequeathed especially Land, shall
fall unto Children, the Father shall not so much as have the profits of it, but
shall be liable to give an account to his Child so soon as it shall come of
age. But that I may explainit, this Parentall power, relisheth more of that
love and respect which Children bare to Parents as a principle infused and
instilled by the Law of Religion and nature rather then of any compulsion of
force by which the Law obliges. Cook, l. 3. Casu Radclif, fol. 37, 38.
for our Decalogue, which the Romans wanted, inculcates this respect with
promise of divine Benediction. And the only curb with which Parents restrain
those that become refractory is the power of disinheriting which is not often
times threatened in vain.

4. Now the Guardianship of wards is double, one by virtue of the common, the
oother of the Statute Law, Cook ubi sup.
And it is true The Common Law gives an action of tre^^pass to the Father
against him that shall take away his Son and Heir, which Action (...) good in

the Child is. Fle. l. 1. c. 5. etc. 14, 15.

Of Marriages.
TIT. X.
A Wife by the Law of England is under the power and Jurisdiction of her
husband, Dyer f. 79. n. 51. Plow. f. 307.
and so in duty tied to him that if she shall be conscious of any fact
committed by her husband, she shall not be punished for concealing it, Glan. l.
11. c. 3. Bract l. 1. c. 6. n. 2. and l. 2 c. 15. and l. 5. tr. 5. c. 17. n. 2.
But she is obliged to hinder as much as in her lies, Flet. l. 1. c. 38.
and according to our ancient Authors, if stolen goods be found under her lock
and key, she shall be esteemed equally guilty with her husband. And so also if
the things stolen be found in her hands, Flet. ibid.
but at this day the Law, is so much altered, as it seems, that if the Wife
commit Thest by the instigation of her Husband she shall not be guilty of
Felony. Fitz. tit. Crown, 99. Brook, ib. 108.


1. And in the same Bond is that woman obliged which shall marry a Villain. For
if a woman who is a Coheir marry a Villain she cannot claim her Partition,
before her time i. e. before the death of her Husband. Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c.
25. n. 2. Fl. l. 4. c. 12. n. 1.
In a word whenever the Husband during Coverture shall dispose of the Lands
of his Wife except only where a Fine is levied, she superviving may after his
death, dissolve such Contracts as done at such a time when as she being under
Coverture was so tied by the Law that she could not contradict him, Plo. 265.
and 32 H. S. c. 2^
nay according to some of our Ancients a Wife is so far obliged to obey her
Husband, that if the Husband shall sell her Jointure against her will she shall
not recover her Dower against the Vendees after his decease, Glan. l. 2. c. 4.
for that she ought to rest silent, and obey her Husband patiently who disposed
in that manner of her Dower as to maintain her life. But this Law is long time
out of date Lit. l. 1. c. 4.
.

2. Contracts of Matrimony may be entered into at the age of seven years Pract.
l. 1. c. 36. nu. 3. Instit. c. 24. Dyer 143. n. 56.
but they are not to intermarry until a fit age, viz. the man at fourteen and
the woman at twelve years old Brac. ib. Instit. ib.
and not in any degree of consanguinity or affinity, which is forbidden by the
Leviticall Law, 32 H. 8. c. 8.
and by our Law if a woman entermarry at nine years of age and survive her
Husband, she shall have her Dower because at that age she is defined to be
capable of it. Lit. l. 1. c. 5
And this is equally a rule both for Villains and those that are free, for
Villains may enter marriage lawfully In this it follows the Common Law.
but they are punishable if they do without license of their Lord. Lit. l. 2.
c. 11.


3. The consent of Parents is not so essentially necessary with us that for
default therein a matrimonial Contract made between them that are free being,
De praesenti, should be nulled, for in this we follow the Pontifical Law, Ca.
cum apud 23. ext. des. onsa and matrim.
and this some affirm true in the Civil Law also. Cujacius in Julii Pauli
receptas sententias, l. 2. c. 19. quem etiam vid. l. observat. 3: c. 5.
However Tribonianus in that long and wearisome work of his indigesling the
Law has happened to omit it, for here the words of Paulus are expressed For
those who are under the power of Fathers, they ought not by Law to contract
Matrimony without their consent, but being once contracted it cannot possibly
be dissolved. For that the regard which is had to the public good is to be
preferred to private Convenienty. l. z. recept-semen. c. 19. de nuptiis.


4. And yet Marriages are not so absolutely ^ee with us for they which hold in
Fee of the King in Capite, that is in right of his Crown, ^r of any Honor or
Manor of his; or of a ^ommon personally Knights Service, if at the ^ay of the
Ancestors death the party be with^^ age and unmarried he cannot without pe^alty
refuse a Wife tendered unto him by the lord of the Fee: For in such case he
shall (...) unto him the value of the marriage: If (...) be that the Lord do
tender unto him ^hilest he is within age a wife who is fit for ^im without
disparity or (as our law expresses (...)) Disparagment. Brit. c. 66. 2 c H. 3.
c. 7. F. B. f. 141, 174 Glan. l. 7. c. 12. Lit. l. 2. c. 4. Flet. l. 1. c. 13.
yet if the Lord shall tender one, some are of opinion that he may
not^ithstanding claim the value of the Heir when (...) comes to age. Dyer, f
255 260.
But here it is to be di^inguished whether the ward refuse the Wife ^ndred to
him by his Guardian, and remain ^nmarried till he comes of age, or whither
after such refusal, he shall yet marry another (...) in the first case he
shall only be compelled (...) pay the value of the marriage simply, but (...)
the later he shall pay it double. F. B. 141. Lit. l. 2. c. 4. Stat. Merc. c. 6.
West. 1. c. 12.


5. And this is true also of womenwho are un^er the age of 14. at the death of
their Ance^ors and unmarried for they also are bound there to marry or pray the
value to their uardian if within two years after fourteen be completed, he
shall tender them a fitting husband, Westminster. 1. c. 12. Brit. c. 67. Brac. l. 2.
c. 37. n. 6. Flet. l. 1. c. 13.
but where the Guardian makes no tender, the Law is the same as in the case of
men.

6. Now disparagement is where the Guardian shall tender to his ward a woman
wanting a Foot or a hand, one that is maimed, imperfect or deformed, or that
has an infectio^s, or contagious disease: One that is old and pa^ hope of
Issue Lit. l. 2. c. 4
or in case the Guardian shall tender, a Villain, Burger, or one that is meanly
descended to her that is, Noble, Flet. l. 1. c. 13.


7. If there be many Lords of whom the Fee is holden, the King (if he be one)
shall have the wardship of the Heir. But if the be all common persons, he shall
be preferre^ to whom the Ancestors did first Homage for the marriage will not
admit partiti^^ But if this cannot appear, he shall be preferred who first
enfeoffed the Ancestors, an^ if this cannot be proved, then that Lord wh^ shall
gain the possession first of the ward Flet. l. 1. c. 13.


8. If the Lord of the Fee shall marry (...) ward made within the age of
fourteen year the ward so soon as he shall come to that age may descent and
leave her, which is also tr^^ in Females who by consent of their Guard^ans
shall marry within the age of twelve Lit. l. 2. c. 4.
and here both Sexes have the same La^ that after marriage so had, under age by
designation of the Guardian. They are no more obliged to his arbitrament the
bond of Matr^mony being dissolved by death. Brac. l. 2. c. 37. n. 6. Lit. l. 2.
c. 4.
And th^^ by an inequality of marrying them, the Guardian shall loose his ward,
and shall liable to satisfy the friends of the ward so disparaged for so great
a damage Brit. c. 67. Lit. l. 2. c. 4. Instit. Jur. com. 24.


9. Heretofore when an Heir female was at ^ge, and held of diverse Lords in Fee,
it was sufficient for her in marrying to require the ^ssent of the next
capital Lord to whom her Ancestors had done legiance, Eract. d. l. 2. c. 37.
n. 6.
but at this day she that is of age, is not obliged to ask the con^ent of her
Lord to marry Brook, tit. Guard. 7.


10. If the Heir of Tenant in Chivalry not being of that age at which by the
Law he may consent to marry, shall marry in his Fathers life time: his Father
being dead, the Lord of the Fee shall have a Writ of Ravishment, because it is
in the power of the Heir to repudiate his wife when he shall come to that full
age, F. B. 143. m.
and a woman who holds of the King in this manner, being thus married; is at
her own election, when she shall come to age whether she will adhere to the
former marriage or accept of such a Husband as the King shall tender, 17 E. 2.
Stat 1. c. 5.


11. Those Widows also which are termed the Kings Widows do make Oath not to
enter marriage again without the Kings consent. And if they do otherwise the
King may by distress seize himself of those lands and renements which they have
in Dower until they or their Husbands shall pay such Fines as the King at
pleasure shall impose. Slan. P^er. c. 4. Glan. l. 7. c. 12. Flet. l. 7. c. 23.
F. B. 263 and 174. 17 E. 2. 1.
Magna charta also does affirm that common persons may exercise the same power
over their Widows c. 7.
And there is this reason given, least the Kings Tenants should enter marriage
with his capital enemies. Fl. l. 1. c. 13


12. Whosoever shall steal or draw away another ward although he restore the
ward afterward unmarried or satisfy for the marriage, shall for such trespass
suffer imprisonment for two years. And if he does not restore the said ward but
marries him or her, and is not able to satisfy for the same he shall abjure the
Realm or be imprisoned during life, Flet. l. 1. c. 13.


13. If any person above the age of fourteen shall draw away an unmarried woman
under sixteen without consent of Parents, or at least those who had the Guard of
her, he shall suffer two years imprisonment without Bail or at least be fined
for his said offense, according to discretion of the Star chamber This power is
now in the Chancery.
But if he shall defile her being so stolen away or any way contract marriage
with her against the consent of her Parents, or Guardians he shall be
imprisoned for five years or much according to the discretion of the said
Court. And if such woman being above twelve and under sixteen shall by her own
consent marry with such ravisher she shall forfeit all and singular those
Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments which at the time of such consent given, she
had either in possession, Reversion or Remainder, 4 and 5 Phi. and Mar. c. 8.
Cook, l. 3. Nut. Case, f. 39.


14. Villains are not to marry without consent of their Patrons. Lit. l. 2. c.
11.
Also if a freeman shall take away ones native in marriage without the consent
of her Lord, although the Lord cannot take her from him, yet he may have his
action for the Ravishment of her. Idem ibid.


15. Women that marry noble men shall have the appellation and privileges of
noble persons, for that dignity they derive from their husbands until they
shall again marry with common persons Idem ibid.
for by marrying they make themselves the same flesh with their Husbands 20 H.
6. c. 6
but if it shall be demanded whether a woman more noble marrying with a man
less noble or a common person may free her Chaplains for non-residency
according to the Statute in that case provided, we 21 H. 8. c. 13.
cannot answer without distinguishing. For second marriages will not prejudice
those which she had during widdowhood. But she cannot impart the same
privilege to them, which she shall have after the second marrying, because her
nobility is extinct. Cook, l. 4. Actons Case, f. 117.
Notwithstanding, that it seems to be otherwise with those which are born noble
and derive not their nobility from marriage. Id. ibid.
for that such who draw their nobility from their Ancestors are more esteemed
and honored with us then they which take it only from their Husbands.

16. If any come together against the leviticall Law we neither understand them
man and Wife, nor do we allow of their contracts, marriage or Dower. Their
Issue gaining no other esteem then to be termed natural, 32 H. 8. c. 38.
Those only are said to be divorced by our Lawyers, whose Marriages are nul'd
for that there may be a separation, a mensa and thoro, and yet the Matrimonial
bond remain unbroken. Term. Jur. verl. Divorce.


17. Those which are unlawfully begotten cannot possibly be made ligitimate.
But they are often made capable of Preisthood or exercising sacred functions by
dispensation, Bract. l.
A spurious Issue may by silence and patience be rendered legitimate; as in case
a Wife shall conceive by another man besides her Husband, notwithstanding that
it be apparent, yet if the husband entertain such Issue in his Family and bring
it up and call it as his Child, he makes it his own lawful Son and Heir, which
is equally true if he do not so call it expressly if he do not remove it and
renounce it, nor is it material whether the Husband be ignorant or knowing of
it, or whether he doubt, for it shall be reputed his lawful Heir because born
of his Wife, so long as it may be presumed that her Husband begot it. And this
may be said also of a supposed Issue, for that often a common opinion passes
for a truth. Bract. d. l. 2. c. 27. n. 4, 5.


18. There are with us two consequences and effects of Marriage. The first,
that all moveable Goods (which by us are termed personal Chattells) which the
Wife brings with her do presently pass into the husbands Patrimony, without
any distinction being thereby (as it were swallowed up, nor can any thing be
reassumed by the Wife surviving but her woman's apparel; and so of imoveables
and realls if allened by the Husband in his life time, but for those which are
not alienated, he being dead they shall return to the Wife, Plow. 418. 4^9.
but if a Wife being Executrix or Administratrix to a former Husband, marries a
second and survives him, she shall have all those Goods both personal and and
real which she brought unto him as possessed of by reason of that relation and
office and which are not alienated by her second husband, restored unto her
without diminution. Vid. infra. tit. 11. par. 7.


The other consequence of Marriage is that lawful or reasonable Dower under
which notion she shall have the third part of all such Lands and Tenements
which her Husband was seized of in Fee for her life Flet. l. 5. c. 22. and 27.
An. 3. and 6 Id. 6. in provis. Dyer 140.
but in case the husband shall happen to be attainted of treason or felony
there the wife shall loose her Dower, 1 Jac. ses. 1. c. 11. and 12.


Of Adoptions.
TIT. XI. Bract. l. 2^ c. 29. n. 4, 5.

BRacton in the place before mentioned calls silence and Patience in the case
of adulterate Issue, adoption which creates such Children being in our power,
free and legitimate. I have also heard of that kind of Adoption amongst us
which the Romans used. But this seems rather to be by private will and
agreement of the persons adopting and adopted, then by any Law; for this is at
our own election that we may give Lands purchased by our selves or which we
have by descent, unless they be given conditionally or (as we term it) by
intail, to whomsoever we please, whether to one of our Kindred, or whether it
be to a stranger without having any relation to those Children which we have,
whence it is apparent, that the custom which the Romans had of Adoption was
either never received amongst us or else that it is long since, as with the
French, wholly extinct. V. Equinarium Baronem in particula posteriori suorum
comment. super Instit hoc Tit.


How and by what means Paternall Jurisdiction is dissolved.
TIT. XII.
WE have spoken before how paternall Jurisdiction is occasioned and
constituted, now we are to declare how it is dissolved and taken away: And we
must know that this is done three manner of ways. By natural death, by civil
death, and by dignity or honor. For if the Father in whose power the Son is,
dies, the Son remains at his own disposing although sometime in the custody of
a Lord or the care of Friends or Parents. But the Grandfather on the Fathers
side being dead, the grandchildren are not in their own power; but remain under
the Jurisdiction of the Father, if he survive the Grandfather, and do not at
all go out of his power as in the case of a Emancipation, or Dignity. Bract. l.
1. c. 10. Flet. l. 1. c. 7.


1. So by a civil death, as in case the Father be condemned for Felony
committed, or exiled. But if he be banished but for a time he shall retain his
Children under his power, because whatever is his he shall enjoy at his coming
back, Id. ibid.


2. Paternall Jurisdiction is dissolved also by Emancipation: As if a man
discharge his Son from his family with any part of his Inheritance, as it was
the custom in former times, Id. eod.
for this kind is a kind of a civil death of the Son, as is the entrance into
Religion. 4 H. 4. c. 17


3. This power is dissolved also by dignity, as in a case the Son be made a
Bishop. Bract. ubi supra.


4. But as this Bond of paternall power is not so strict with us as it was with
the Romans, so neither is the releasing of it by Emancipation so usual: For I
find nothing in our Laws, which hinders a son or daughter from disposing of
themselves, even against their Fathers consent so soon as they shall come to
the age of one and twenty years. It is most certain that they may then enter
Marriage or Contract with any one, and be no less obliged by a Contract then
^f they were threescore. For this age with us is perfect and full maturity.
Bract. l. 1. c. 10. n. 2. Lit. l. 2. c. 4.


Of Wardships.
TIT. XIII.
OF those which are under the power or Jurisdiction of others, there are some
which are in the custody or protection of Lords, some are under the care of
Parents, and Friends, and some are not obliged by either, as those which are at
full age. Bract. l. 1. c. 10. number. 2.


1. The word protection, is not so frequent with us as Custody. For as we have
many Species of Law from the Normans, so have we words also* now they call him
(...) Guardian which the Romans termed Tutor or which was rather meant and
comprehended under their appellations of Tutor and Curator together. In which
we imitate them in calling them Guardians

2. These Guardians are appointed sometimes by the Fathers will, sometimes by
the Law, and sometimes by the Magistrate. For where the Father has only an
Estate of Money or Chattells to leave to those Children which being under age
are in his power, he may commit the care and Government (...) them together,
with the Legacies to any (...) his Friends, Cook, l. 3. case Ratcl. f. 37, 38.
he also has the like power with a Father who shall infeost an Infant i^
Laws, for he may commit the Custody (...) him according to his pleasure to
whom (...) pleases, Flet. l. 1. c. ^
and what is here mentioned of Children born may be understood of Post humi.

Who they are that by Testament may appear Guardians.
TIT. XIIII.
WHosoever has a Free administration and power of dispensing his Goods may,
constitute a Guardian by his will, provided he be of perfect age and sound
memory, Glan. l. 7. c. 6.
and this also may be performed by a Woman, Brit. c. 35.
But if an Infant or one that is not Compos mentis be ordained, he cannot be
admitted until the defect be removed. Swinb. part 3. Sect. 10.


1. A man may constitute his own Villain or Native Guardian over his Children,
or another with the permission of his Lord, but it is worthy consideration
whether a Villain by this Act, shall gain his Liberty. Sus. de libertinis,
tit. 5.


2. One may also constitute his Apprentice Brook, Testament. 8.
whosoever may be an Executor may also be a Guardian. Swinb. part 3. Sect. 10.


Of the lawful Guardian-ship of Kindred.
TIT. XV.
WE have spoken already of Guardians which are appointed by Law and this is
by reason of an Estate in Fee which shall descend to Infants by right of
Inheritance: But if Tenant in Socage dies, the next Heir whether Son or
Daughter, if an Infant shall be in the custody of the next of Kinn on that side
to whom the Inheritance cannot descend, for examples sake, if the Estate come
by the Fathers side, then the Mother, or if she be dead, the next of Kinn on
her side shall have the custody of the Infant. If by the Mothers side, then the
next of kinn on the Fathers side Glan. l. 7. c. 11. Lit. l. 2. c. 5. Bract. l.

and this is the reason of the Law. Because the Infants may be in less danger
in their hands, to whom their death is least advantageous. Fort. c. 44. and 45.
so that none that is a Copar^^ner in Socage ought to be in the Guard or Custody
of her Copar^^ner or her Husband but of some of her Parents, and if any one
shall buy the Guard of the Lands or the marriage of the Daughters and shall take
any of them to Wife, he is presently suspected and shall by the Law loose the
Guard of the Body, and the marriage of the rest by reason of the suspicion. Fle.
l. 1. c. 9


1. But if two Brothers purchase Land (...) them, their Heirs, the elder if at
age ^ay have the Guard of the younger, being (...) Infant provided they be both
legitimate. Brit. c. 35. fol. 92.


2. And these Heirs according to the ^^cients, go out of Wardship at fifteen
years (...) age. Glan. l. 7. c. 9. Bract. l. 2. c. 36. n 2. Flet. l. 1. c. 11.
But according to the modern ^^actise at fourteen, Lit. l. 2. c. 5 Doct. and
Stu. c. 7 fol. 141. F. B. 118.
in regard the Law ^^pposeth that at this age they are able to ^^rform those
things which belong to Hus^^ndry. But Tenants by the custom called ^avelkinde,
being sixteen years old com^^eat, may alien their Lands by Feostment; ^^thout
license from their Guardians, Dyer, fo. 301. n. 41. Fitzh. Custom 11. Brook,
ibid. 50.


3. So also Tenants in Burgage, who are ^^fants; their Father or Ancestor being
dead (...) committed, for the same reason which ^enant in Socage are, to the
Custody of ^^eir Kindred. From whence they are freed (...) soon as they shall
be able discreetly to ^unt Money, and measure Cloth, and per^^rm other such
like businesses. But in this ^^se the certain time is not defined but is
ad^^dged by the discretion and maturity of the ^eires, Bract ubi. sup. Flet. l.

4. A Woman is supposed to be of perfect ^ge in Socage in all cases so soon as
she is a^e to know how to dispose of her house, and (...) do those things which
belong to the dis^^sing and ordering her Family and is able (...) understand
what appertains to Cone and ^^ey, which cannot be before she be fourteen (...)
fifteen years old, because this age requires ^^der and judgment. Bract. l. 2.
c. 39. n. 2.


5. A female Heir was according to some ancient writers judged equal with a

Of Disfranchisement, or Deminutio capitis.
TIT. XVI.
THat which the Romans called Demin^ coepitis, and divided into three kinds,
(...) so distinguished by the English. Notwith^^^nding that we do tacitly
acknowledge it ^^uble by our Laws. That which they tear^^ed the least we wholly
omit, for those which (...) emancipated by their Fathers, do not ^^ose the
Right of their former family. But (...) they may (at least making a partition
(...) Goods and Chattells) be received as to (...) successiion or Inheritance
of an Intestate (...) those who are adopted by others have (...) rights of
their new faculty, either ^^on the sole agreement or the expressed ^urtesy of
those by whom they are adopted ^^thout assistance of the Law, required or
^^pected. Sup. tit. Adopt. 17.


1. Those who are, Servi paenae, namely ^^ose which have sentence for Treason
or ^^lony loose all that can be lost: Not only ^^eir Freedom and Liberty but
even all ^^at they have, and their lives also, Stan. placit. Coro. l. 2. and
Prerog. c. 44.
Nor ^^ve they other Successor then the Exche^^er or the Lord of the Manor: as
we shall ^^ew else where, See the 4. Book, tit. of Pub. Ju.
and therefore we may ^^th reason call this the greatest Disfran^isement or
Capitis diminutio.

2. And although the ancient Law which ^^nished, Brac. l. 3. tract. 2. c. 16.

but those who undergo ^^is penalty seem to undergo the lesser dis^anchisement
or that which the Romans ^^lled, Medium capitis diminutionem.

Capitis diminutio, and seems to be wholly taken away with us, for those who

Of the lawful Guardianship of Lords or Patrons.
TIT. XVII.
OUR Laws do not decree any thi^^ that I know concerning that Patron^^^
Tutela, which the Roman Law mentions. (...) we have another kind of Patronage
in re^pect of the Fee which we possess, and these (...) termed the Lords of
the Fee. Prat ^i lexicon verb. Patronus.
And the^^ are very few Infants that succed to good Estates, who escape their
Wardship and C^stody. For as there is none with us (except (...) Crown) who are
seized of their Estates an^ Tenements in a freer or larger Title th^^ Fee, so
is there scarce any Fee less worth* But that it is bound to the Lord or a
Patro^ by Knights Service; now those things which are proper to this Service,
are Guard, Ma^^age, and Releife. Lit. l. 2. c. 4


1. An Infant Heir, who succeeds his A^cestors, F. B. 262. Fletl. 1. c. 11.
Dyer, 362. Gla. l. 7. c. 9. Bract. l. 2. c. 32. Brit. c. 66. Lit. l. 2. c. 4.
in Knights Service remains under the Guard and Custody of his Lord u^till he
come to perfect age. For before th^^ age he is not adjudged capable of those
war^ick accomplishments requisite for a Knight and due to his Lord by reason of
his Te^ure, notwithstanding that it falls out some^imes that age being
dispensed with some are elected into the order of Knighthood before ^hey be
complete one and twenty years old: But our Law supposes these to be able to do
those Offices due to the Lord of the Fee, wherefore they are out of the custody
though Infants. Brook, tit. Guard. 42. and 72 Fulbeck in paral. f. 29. Plow 267.


2. And this right of custody springs from ^his reason, that since he who holds
by Knights Service is obliged according to the ^greement at the first investing
of the Estate ^o follow his Lord as a Knight in the Kings Wars. It is presumed
that no man will be more careful in training up the Infant in ^eats of Arms
then the Lord himself. Fort. c. 44. Polid. Virg. l. 16.


3. But if such an Heir be female she remains in custody according to the
Ancients Bract. l. 2. c. 37. n. 3.
but till fifteen, and according to our moderns no longer then sixteen years of
age Lit. l. 2. c. 4
^or no sooner do they come to that age, but they are immediately presumed to
be able to govern their house, and to marry such a Husband that shall be
capable of doing the Service due to the Lord of the Fee. Bract. and Lit. ibid.
But if she be complete fourteen years old at the death of her Ancestor,
neither her Body or Land shall fall under the Custody of the Lord. Lit. l. 2.
c. 4. Mert. c. 6. West. 1. c 22. Instit. Jur. Com. c. 24. Br. tit. Guard. 7.


4. But if in this case it come in question, whether the Heir be an infant or
not, he shall remain in custody until it be determined* Brac. l. 2. c. 37.
Brit. c. 66 fol. 167. b.


5. If a Knights Fee descend to an Heir (...) the Mothers side, the Father
living shall have the Guard of his Body, and the Lord of the Land, for it is a
Maxim, that no one as to his Person shall fall into the custody of the Lord,
his Father living. Lit. l. 2. c. 4.


6. If Lands descend to a Wife who after Issue had by her Husband dies. So
that the Husband for default of having possession (...) the Lands in the life
of his Wife cannot be Tenant by the courtesy of England. In this case the
Issue, unless it be Heir to the Father as being his eldest Son, shall be in
custody. And if such Issue be a female and an Infant, at the death of her
Mother, she shall remain: If her Father have a Son living, in custody
notwithstanding her Father be aliv^. F. B. fol. 143.


7. Lord of a Knights Fee, may transfer the guard of his Tenant to another. From
whence there arises this distinction of Guardian i^ Law, and Guardian in Tail.
Guardian i^ Law is the Lord himself. Guardian in Tail is he to whom the Lord
has granted the the Custody of his Heir, Bract. l. 2. c. 37. n. 3. Lit. l. 2.
c. 4.


8. There is also a Guardian simply and originally so called, and a Guardian by
accident, from the cause of custody, Originally is he who in right of his Fee
has the custody of his Tenant. Causarily, is he who for that he has the
custody of his own Tenant being yet an Infant has upon that score the custody
of another who is Tenant to his Ward, F. B. fol. 139. d. Dyer, 123 n. 38.
For an Infant cannot be Guardi^^ of an Infant. Flet. l. 1. c. 11.


^* When there is an Heir male or female ^ho has many capital Lords, they
cannot (...) have the custody of the Heir, and there^^re one must be preferred
before the rest: and that is he who first infeoffed the Tenant (...) Knights
Service, the rest shall only be ^^rmitted, the custody of the Lands which ^^e
holden of their Fee. Bract. l. 2. c. 37. n. 4, etc. Stamf. Prerog. c. 2.


10. But if any Heir hold of the King in, ^^pite by Knights Service, whether he
has ^^her Lords or not, the King shall be prefer^^d before the rest, to the
custody of the ^eir; and that notwithstanding, Priority or ^osteriority of
infeoffing. For that the King ^ath no equal or superior in his Realm Glan.
l. 7. c. 10. Bract. and Stam. ut sup.


11. A Ward who is once freed from the ^^stody of his Guardian [as by marrying
or ^ontracting Matrimony with his consent] ^^all not return again into the
custody. And ^^at notwithstanding he be under fourteen ^ears of age, or
afterward that he shall mar^y before 21. Bract. l. 2. c. 38. n. 1. Lit. l. 2.
c 4.


12. If there shall be many Daughters Co^cites who hold by Knights Service:
They shall be all under the custody of the capital lord, and none under the
custody of the Mother. Bract. l. 2. c. 37. n. 6.


Of the Legal Guardianship of Parents.
TIT. XVIII.
THE Father is preferred before all others, to the custody of his eldest So^*
For if an Inheritance fall to such an Infa^^ who has a Father living;
notwithstanding that the Lands, if they be holden in Knight Service be in the
custody of the Lord of the Fee. Yet the Body of the Heir shall remai^ with his
Father. Lit. l. 2. c. 4 Cook, l. 3. Case Rat. fo.. 37.


1. So also, the Mother of an Infant (...) holds in Socage, shall have the
Custody (...) the Body and Lands of the Heir before a^^ kindred, either of the
Fathers side or Moth^^ side.

Of Fiduciary Guardianships.
TIT. XIX.
THat Tutela Fiduciaria, which the Roman^ imposed upon the male children, their
Parents being dead and upon the Children of Patrons, our Ancestors seem wholly
(...) have neglected. Concerning the first, We^ have nothing determined save
that which we mentioned before of the legal Guardianship of Kindred. But as
for the other, they do not transfer it upon the Children of the Patrons but
upon the Executors rather Lit. l. 1. c. 5
for they reckon the custody of Wards, among Chattells real, N. Ter. ver.
Chattels. Flet. l. 1. c. 11.
and therefore if the Patron or Lord of the Fee do not demise them by his last
will, they are transmitted by the Common Law to the Executors of his last Will.

Of the Attilian Tutorship which is appointed by the Lex Julia Titia.
TIT. XX.
WE have sometimes Tutores Dativi, or deputed Guardians amongst us. For in
case the Mother being dead the Father die intestate and leaves Children under
age, who have no Fee to succeed unto; it often happens that the Ecclesiastical
Judge commit the Guard of them, to such as shall have a care of their Persons
and Patrimony, until they come to fourteen years of age. And this is often
attested and confirmed by an Instrument authentickly sealed: But our Law does
not compel any one to such an Office, nay rather the Judges stir up and make
choice of those whom affinity and consanguinity oblige to this work of love and
Charity Swinb. part 3. Sect. 9.


1. And probably that Guardian may not improperly be styled Dativus, Tutor
which Bracton mentions, l. 2. c. 11. n. 1 and Brit. c. 34, 40, 62. Fle. l. 1.
c. 9.
when he says that it is convenient for him that gives Lands or Tenements to
an Infant to appoint him a Guardian also, giving this reason because the Donor
cannot be Guardian least he seem to continue his own Seisin nor can an Infant
consent to the Gift but by his Guardian.

2. The supreme power may by Letters Patents constitute to an Infant an
universal Guardian to answer and appear for him in all Actions begun, and to
be begun, and that before any Judge or Judges whatsoever. Or the same power may
authorize two or three Guardians jointly or severally to answer or prosecute
any Action in his behalf. and the same letters at the instance of the Infant
may give power to the same Guardians jointly and severally, to substitute other
Guardians under them who may in their place and stead act for the said Infant
in all causes and complaints or make defense for him. F. B. fol. 27. b.


3. Nor is it unusual in Court-Barons or other liberties for the Steward or
municipall Magistrate to appoint Guardians to Infants Kitch. in preceden. pa.

Of the Authority of Tutors and Guardians.
TIT. XXI.
AN Infant under the age of twenty one years cannot make any contract in his
own name (except for those things which ap^e^tain to his necessary Food,
Raiment, and Education] Brook, tit. Inf. 51.
without the Authority and consent of him under whose power and custody he is
New book of Entrys, tit.. Bro. non fuit com^os mentis. Bract. l. 5. trac. 2. c.
11. n. 1.
nor can he commence his Suit against his Guardian Bract. l. 5. tract. 4. c. 4.
n. 5. Brit. c. 121.
An Infant may by himself and by his own Deed better his. condition, but he
cannot prejudice himself Bract. l. 2. c. 5. n. 8.


1. There is something more particular in those who hold by Knights Service:
For the capital Lords have a plenary power over their whole Estate without
their persons and sometimes over their Persons also, and so that they have the
full disposing of Advowsons in case of Vacancies, and in granting, giving, or
selling their Wards, And (in case of female Heirs) of marrying them or selling
their Marriages, and generally of disposing all things whatsoever for the
profit of the Heir. Of late for their own proper profit. Brook, Guard. 2. Fitz.
Account, 36.
as if they were to dispose of their own and better if possible. They may sell
their custody of the Lands and the marriages of the Heirs if unmarried, but
they cannot alien any thing of the Inheritance, or sell the Remainder.
Notwithstanding, as for the hei^ which are in custody, they are to treat then
honorably, and to discharge the duties belonging to the Inheritance according
to the quantity of the Inheritance, and for the ra^^ according to the time of
the Wardship. They may manage the affraies of their Heirs, recover their right
in those things wherein the Heir as an Infant may plead, or move, or prosecute
a Suit in their behalf; namely of the rights of possession of proper Seisin, or
of the Seisin of an Ancestor. But in a^ Action of right in case of property
they can neither act nor answer for them, except of that of which the Infant
was infeoffed during his Minority. Bract. l. 2. c. 37 n. 3. and Brit. c. 34.
fol. 90.


2. Guardians ought to sustain and keep in repair the Houses of their Wards,
as also their Parks, Warrens, Fishings, Mills, and other Appurtenances; least
by neglect they be impaired or ruined, by which, wast may be found: They are
also bound to redeliver the Lands in due time free, at least as they received
them and that Gratis, quitted both of releife and Fine, in case they be
accorded and agreed concerning Marriage Flet. l. 1. c. 12. Mag. Cha. c. 4.
West. 1. c. 47. 6 Ed. 1. c. 5. West. 2. c. 35.


3. The same Authority also have Guardians in Socage, to contract, to manage
Suits in Law, and to do all other things which are behoovefull, either for the
conservation or augmentation of the Estate of their Pupil: But these are
liable to render an account when their Wards shall come to age F. B. fol. 118.
b.


4, A Guardian may make Oath for his Word. Flet. l. 6. c. 10.


5. In some Cases our Law does so highly ^avour Infants, that it will not
suffer them to ^un the hazard of Judgment although with ^he consent of their
Guardians but stay pro^eeding until they come of age. For in case of right or
property of their possessions they can neither sue nor be sued, except for such
which themselves have gaind. Glan. l. 7. c. 9. Bract. l. 5. tract. 5. c. 21. n.

yet formerly there were bound in case of a Fine acknowledged in Court, in case
of a proper in^ury, or Dower, or in Case of what themselves had recovered,

By what means Wardships expire.
TIT. XXII.
ALL Wards whatsoever not holding by Knights Service are without more-adoe
freed from their Guardians at fourteen years of age Lit. l. 2. c. 4
but those Tenants if male, not till one and twenty, if female not till
fourteen Id. ibid.
or in some cases not till sixteen years of age, V. sup. tit. 15. Sect. 4.
and although a Woman being full twelve years old may contract Matrimony, as
well by our Law as by the Civil Bract. l. 2. c. 37. n. 7.
being then adjudged capable of a Husband: yet she does not so soon come to
maturity of Judgment but it is sooner notwithstanding out of custody then a
man, because when she marries she does but alter her condition entering under a
new power of a Husband, instead of the custody of her Guardian. Glan. l. 11. c.
7. Bract. l. 1. c. 6. n. 2.


1. So a Wardship may expire by the natural or Civil death V. sus. tit. 16.
of the Guardian which is that which we termed the, Maxima or Media capitis
diminutio, or in case the Guardian shall give Lands, etc. to his Ward or
infeoff him. For no man can be both a Guardian and Feoffor at one and the same
time. Bract. l. 2. c. 5. n. 6.
But this is most remarkable in Guardians which are so by reason of Knights
Service, that they may either assign the custody of their Wards, to another;
or bequeath them amongst their other Chattells by common custom to their
Executors.

2 The Lord loses the custody of the Body of his Ward when ever he gives him
or her in Matrimony: So that if it shall happen, the Ward being under age to
become single the second time he can by no means recover him into his custody.
Lit. l. 2. c. 4


Of Tutors or Overseers.
TIT. XXIII.
MEN though full grown, and women though marriageable, were amongst the Romans
to receive Tutors until they arrived at twenty five years of age.
Notwithstanding, that they are not so with us beyond the age of one and twenty,
and that in case where they had not any before either in regard of their Tenure
or necessity of the Law. However we include Tutors and Overseers under the
name of Guardians, although it is apparent, those to be more proper in relation
to the person, these to the Estate. V. tit. 14. Sect. 4. in Inst. and A de rit^
nuptiarum l. sciendum 20.


1. To some also, the Law appoint Tutors and Overseers, for by the Statute the
King has the custody of the Lands of natural Idiots, receiving the profis
without waste and destruction, and finding them necessaries* without any regard
had of whom the Lands are holden which after the death of the Idiots are to be
restored to the right Heirs, so that they cannot by any means be aliened by
the Idiots or the Heirs disinherited 17 Ed. 2. Brit. 167. Stan. Prerog. c. 9.
Bract. l. 5. trac. 5 c. 20. n. 1. Dyer, 102. Co^. l. 4. 126.
Fleta affirms l. 1. c. 11.
that anciently Idiots were under the custody of their own Lords, But that for
the many Exheredations that happened: Their Guardianshipp was conferred by
Parliament upon the King, yet with this Proviso, that the Lords of the Fee and
those whom it concerned should loose nothing which was their due. Either for
Services, Rents Releifs, of their right of Guardianship, till they come to full
age according to the condition of their Fee.

2. So also where it happens that any one who formerly had both memory and
understanding becomes, Non compos mentis, as some are who have, Lucida
intervalla. The King shall take care, that the Lands and Tenements of such
shall be kept without waste or destruction: And that he and his Family shall
live competently and be maintained out of the profits of the same: And that the
Remainder of their profits shall be reserved for their use. So that the said
Lands and Tenements shall not be by any means alienated within the said time,
nor the Revenues appropriated to the Kings use, and that if he shall happen to
die in such a condition, that then that said remainder of the said profits to be
disposed of by the Ordinary, for the good of his Soul. 17 E. 2. c. 10. Bract.
l. 5. tr. 5. c. 9. n. 7. Dyer, fol. 25. n. 164. Cook, l. 4. 127.


3. Those who are naturally deaf and dumb or labor under any perpetual
disease according to the opinion of some are necessarily to have Guardians.
Bract. l. 5. tr. 3. c. 6 n. 6. and tr. 5. c. 18. n. 1. etc. 10. n. 1.


4. Infants are not forced to receive Guardians against their will except by
reason of their Fee, or any of the causes before mentioned, or in case of Suits
in Law. And in the latter case oftentimes there is not only the next of Kinn
assigned to assist the Infant in acting but a Guardian likewise to afford him
help for his defense West. 1. c. 47. West. 2. c. 15. F. B. f. 27.


5. Notwithstanding which, no man as Guardian to an Infant shall prosecute for
him or receive an Action without warrant, but another may as his Kinsman
commence an action for him without express warrant, Id. ibid.
nor can an Infant disclaim that Guardian who prosecutes an action for him as
being next of Kinn. Id. ibid.


6. An Idiot born is not received to prosecute or defend in any action by his
Guardian or next of kinn, but is required ^lwaies to be present in his proper
person. F. N. B. fol. 27. g.


Of the Security which is to be given by Guardians.
TIT. XXIV.
HE that is constituted sole Tutor or Guardian by the Magistrate or Ordinary ^s
bound by our Law to put in security. But before he is admitted to his Office he
makes ^ath to administer all the affairs of his ^ard to his profit and
benefit, to give a true and faithful Inventory of all his Goods, and to
exhibit it by a certain time, accor^ing as the Judge shall appoint, as also to
^ender an exact and true account of his Office when it shall be required from
him. ^esides all which he is to find fit and able ^^reties jointly with
himself, and severally ^y themselves to become bound for his true and faithful
administration of his Guardian^hip.

Of the excuses of Guardians.
TIT XXV.
OUR Laws speak nothing of the excuses of Guardians because no one is pu^ upon
this Office against his Will.

Of Guardians which may fall under Suspicion.
TIT. XXVI.
OUR Laws are very careful in p^ of trusting Guardians. For he that give
Estates to diverse, whereof some are of ag^ and some Infants, may lawfully appo^
those which are of age to be Guardians o^ the Infants; but this will not stand
in c^ there be any cause of suspicion, that they w^ contrive the death of the
Infants, but susp^tion is not admitted, if the gift be made t^ Father or Mother
or their lawful Issue, b^ it is otherwise where it is to Brother or Uncle or
Nephew; because of the right discending. Bract. l. 2. c. 11.


1. They who are Guardians by right o^ their Fee, so long as they have the
custod^ of the Land are bound to maintain and re^aire all Houses, Parks,
Warrens, Fish^ooles, Mills, and all things whatsoever ap^ertaining to the said
Land, out of the pro^^ts of the said Land: And to ^ender to the Heir when he
shall come to age, his said ^and free from all Services of the Plough ^t least
as free as he found it. Nor shall he ^ake any thing of the Land of the Heir as
he ^eing under age, more then the ordinary cu^tomes and reasonable Services.
And th^s without destruction or waste either of men or goods; which if he shall
do, whether there ^o any prohibition precede or not, he shall ^oose his ward
and pay Damages. And deli^er up the Land for his default, to some dis^reet and
lawful men of his Fee or to the ^ext of Kynn. Bract. l. 2. c. 37. n. 3. and l.
4. tr. 6. c. 19. n. 2. Mag. Char. c. 4. and 5.


2. And it is true regularly, that no one ^^all remain in the custody of him
who may ^e suspected that he will lay claim to the ^nheritance. Whence it
follows that if there ^e many Daughters and Heirs in Socage ^one of them shall
be wards to the rest, but ^hey shall remain in the custody of their next of
Kinn who are allied to them in that line ^o which the Inheritance cannot
descend, ^ut if they hold by Knights Service, they shall be all under the
custody of another Capital Lord [and not one alone under the Guard of another
Lord by reason of the said suspition] until they come to perfect age. Bract.
l. 2. c. 37. n. 6. and l. 2. c. 5. n. 8.


3. A Ward may prosecute an Action of waste against his Guardian, and may
constitute his Attorney in the Action. F. N. B. f. 27. H.


The end of the first Book.
THE Second Book of the Institutes of the Laws of ENGLAND.
Of the division of things and the gaining a Property in things.
TIT. I.
WE have spoke before of the Persons and conditions of men and persons in Law.
We are therefore now by consequence to treat of things by dividing and
distinguishing, that they may the better be understood, Bract. l. 1. c. 12. in
the begin.


1. Now the first division of things, is this, that some are in Patrimony and
Inheritance, and some not. Those which are of, or belonging to our Patrimony,
and both movables and immoveables, which we have liberty to make use of
according to our wills (...) necessities. Rights and Services are not properly
to be reckoned amongst Goods, but i^ regard they are not extreneous, they may
the rather be accounted such. Bract. ib. n. 2. Flet. l. 3. c. 1.


2. Those which are not appertaining (...) our Patrimony are things sacred,
religio^^ and common. Bract. ib. n. 5.


3. By natural right these things are to be esteemed as common. Running water,
the Air and Sea, and the Sea shores as accessory. For no one is prohibited
coming to the Sea shoares, whilst he abstaines from Buildings and Villages,
because by the Law o^ Nations the shoares are as common as the Sea: And
therefore, those Buildings which shall be erected either in the Sea or shore,
are the Builders by the Law of Nations? and in this case the soil follows the
propriety o^ the building, although in others it be contrary the building
giving place and following the propriety of the Soil Bract. d. l. 2. c. 12. n.
5.


4. Things which are to be esteemed public are Rivers and Ports. And therefore
the right of fi^hing used to be free to all, as also the use of the banks are
public as the Rivers themselves by the Law of Nations. Wherefore it is as free
to every one to join Ships and fasten them unto them, to tie their cables or
ropes to the Trees growing on them, to lay any burden upon them as it is to
sail or row in the Rivers themselves, but the property of them is theirs to
whose Fee they adione. And for that reason the ^rees which grow thereon are
theirs like^ise. And this is to be understood of those ^ivers which have a
perpetual and continu^l course, because those which are but tem^orary may be
private, Bract. l. 2. c. 12. n. 6.
but these which ^ere formerly the Peoples. And by our Law ^^ansferd upon the
supreme Power, as repre^^nting the person of all the People and con^^quently of
the Commonwealth it self Pl^w. Cas. Reinyer and Fogassa.
therefore at this day whosoever disburdens (...) unlades his Ship upon the

6. Those things are said universal and ^elong to the generallity (not to
particular Persons) which are in Cities, Theaters, Ra^es, and the like, which
are common in Cities and are for the use and in the power of the Generality.
But of things which belong and appertain to the generallity, some are termed
Venalia, not from the use but the power, under which they are and profit, as
the lands and Servants of Cities so that they cannot be called any ones
particularly. Bract. ib. Brit ib. Flet. ib.


Some things there are which may many ways be said not to be the goods of any
one, as first by the Law of nature. Wild Beast, Birds, Fishes, and Men. Next by
Judgment* as things Sacred, religious and holy. The^^ by accident as an
Inheritance lying before it be entered upon or appropriated, and (...) Wreck. By
will, as any thing that is left and forsaken, and by process of time as
Treasure, Bract. ib. n. 10. and l. 3. tr. 2 c. 3. n. 4, 5, 6. D and Stu. f.
157. Brit. c. 33. Flet. l. 1. c. 43, 44, and 47. and l. 3. c. 1.
but by our Law, Wrecks, things that are left and forsaken, and Treasure,
belong to the public Exchequer. Kitch. f. 12 f. 30. f. 40. Stat de Prerog.
Reg. c. 11.


8. Things sacred are those which are duly set apart by the Clergy, for Gods
Service. As Churches and Gifts duly dedicated for holy uses; as Chaliees, etc.
Which are forbidden to be alienated, except for the redemption of Captives;
also Church yards and Chappells, and although structures happen to be
dimolished, notwithstanding, the ground remains sacred still. Now Sacru^
differs from Sacrarium, Sacrarium signifying only a place where holy things are
laid, Bract. ib. n. 9. and l. 2. c. 27. n. 2. etc. 5. n. 7. Brit. c. 33.
and besides all these, the Kings High way in some sense is termed sacred,
Bract. l. 4. tr. 1. c. 16. n. 9. etc. 28. etc. 38. and tr. 3. c. 9. and l. 5.
tr. 5. c. 10. Fl. l. 3. c. 1.


9. Christian Religion makes religious things almost the same with sacred, yet
there are amongst us many noble families who have by the leave of the Ordinary
and Parishoners, built Chappells near the Church, and have therein a right of
burial for them-selves, so that none else might be interred in them.

10. Those things which are called Sancta, are such as are s^nced and guarded
from the injury of men, as that law is particulerly called Sanctio which lays
a Panalty upon those who commit injuries. And of this sort are walls and gates
of Cities, which we suppose so called, because if we may credit our ancient
writers their way, a capital punishment ordained for those who should iniure
them, either by violating or altering them, or climbing or Scaling them, or by
any other way. In regard it seems an Act of hostility and not sufferable, to
enter any other way then by the gates, Bra. ib. n. 9.
but this punishment seems of late arbitrary, unless in time of War.

11. Now those things which every particular man possesses are held and had,
either by the Law of Nature, the Law of Nations, or the Law Civil, we shall
therefore first treat of the most ancient which had their first rise, even with
Mankind it self. After which we shall descend to the Law Civil which was
introduced afterward; namely, when Cities were built, Magistrates created, and
Laws began to be prescribed. Bract. l. 2. c. 1. n. 2. Brit c. 33.


12. Now dominion or propriety in things by the Laws of Nature and Nations was
first created by the occupation and possession of those things which did not
properly belong to any particular Person. Occupation includes, Fishing,
Hunting, Fowling, Enclosing, Seizing, Bract. ib. n. 2, 3. Brit. c. 33 Flet. l.
3. c. 2. Plow. fol. 28.
the Law of Nations puts the property of things thus gotten into the person who
has possession, but ours does not. For there are many things which are the
Kings by his Prerogative, Bra. ib. n. 2.
and there are many Statutes which put limitations both to Fishing, 4 H. 7. 15.
Eliz. 17. 25 H 8. 7. 13 E. 1. c. 47. 13 Eliz. c. 18. 31 H. 8. 1, 2. 3 E. 3. c.

and Hunting 5 Eliz. c. 21. 13 H. 8. c. 18. and 31 c. 2 37 D. 3. c. 13. 24 H.
8. c. 10. and 25. c. 11. and 31. c. 12. and 32. c. 8, 11. 3 and 4 E. 6. c. 7. 5
El. c. 21. and 23. c. 10. Dyer, fol. 306. and 326.
by which that ancient liberty which the Law of Nations intitles us unto,
becomes bounded, custom also of places does often in these alter common right.

13. The mere persuing and hunting of any thing does not make it mine; for
although I should so wound any beast that it may be taken, yet is it not mine
until I shall have taken it, nay, it shall rather be his that can get
possession of it in regard many things may intervene and happen which may
hinder my taking of it. So if a Dear shall fall into the Ginn or Snare which I
shall set up, for to catch any thing, and I chance to take him and hunt him by
persuing, he shall be mine if he come into my power, unless there be any
custom or Privilege to the contrary. 23 Eliz. c. 10. 13 E. 2. Stat. 1. c. 13.
2 and 3 E. 6. c. 14. and 17. Dyer, f. 238.


14. So bees are by nature wild for if they shall settle upon my Tree they are
no more mine before I have hived them. Then the Birds which shall build their
nests there, and therefore if another shall hive them, they shall be accounted
his, yet the Chickins or young ones of such Birds as build in my Trees are mine
by right until they can fly away F. B. f. 86, 87, 89. Doct. and Stu. l. 1. c.
5.
so that if any one else shall take them away, he is liable to pay me Damages.
14 H. 8. f. 1. F. B f. 86.
If a swarm of Bees forsake my hive, they are said to be mine so long as they
continue in my sight and that the persuing of them becomes not impossible,
otherwise they are his that takes them. But yet whosoever shall take them does
not make them his, if he know whose they are, but commits Theft unless he
intend restitution. And these are true unless where the particular custom of
any place makes an alteration. Bract. l. 2. c. 12. n. 3. Brit. c. 33. Flet. l.
3. c. 2. Sect. 2.


15. That which has been spoken is to be understood of those Creatures which
remain continually wild, but if any shall happen to be made tame, and by
custom go familiarly in and out, fly abroad and return as Dear, Swans,
Peacocks, Pigeons and the like. There is another* rule to be observed for that
they are to be understood, ours so long as they have any Inclination of
returning. For when ever they cease to have any desire to return, they cease to
be ours, and the inclination of returning is then said to cease when the
custom does; and the same is to be understood of Hens and Geese when having
been tame they become wild. Bract. ib. Brit. ib.


16. But in the case of Hens and Geese which are bred in a House, the third
rule holds good, namely, that although they fly away out of my fight, yet in
what place soever they are, they are to be understood mine, and he committs
Theft who detains them with an intention to gain. Bract. ib.


17. And this Species of possession takes place also amongst those who are made
Captives, that if free men be brought into our Servitude and escape, they
receive their pristine condition Bract. ib.


18. So has it in those things that are common as in the Sea and its shore.
In stones and Gemms, and other things found on the shore. Bract. ib. Brit. d.
c. 33. Flet. l. 3. c. 2.


19. The second manner of gaining, which is by Jus gentium, and is a discreet
or distinct increase, or secretly a Contrete or continued. And therefore
whatsoever is born (...) comes from any sort of animalls under (...) Subjection
or power are absolutely gained unto us. Bract. ib. Brit. ib. Flet. ib.


20. So Whatever a River throws up (...) adds unto our Land by overflowing is
ours, by Jus gentium, now this kind of increase (...) unknown, for that it is
said to be added by overflowing, which is so insensibly added, that the time or
times are insensible. Bract. ib. Brit. ib. Flet. ib. Dyer, fol. 326.


21 But if this increase be not inperceptible, but apparent, then it is
otherwise: As in case the force and violence of a River should sever any part
of your Inheriance, and join it to your Neighbors, yet undoubtedly it remains
yours still: but if it shall remai^ long so joined, and the Trees which
accompanied it, take root in your Neighbors fee, from that time they seemed to
be perfectly added and gained to his Inheritance, yet according to some, there
is a profitable claim given to the former owner: But this claim cease because
the very Superficies, is become another, and a Tree which is fed and nourished
by another man's ground shall be esteemed his. Bract. ib. Brit ib. Flet. ib.


22 And this kind of accession is in case of an Island made by a River which
if it be just in the middle of the River, it shall be in common to those who,
pro indiviso, have the Inheritance near the bank on each side the River,
according to the latitude of each ^ee toward the Bank. But if it be nigher to
^ne side then the other, then it is theirs only which have the Inheritance on
that side near ^he Bank. Bract. ib. Brit. ib. Flet. ib.


23. But if an Island be made in the Sea, (...) which seldom happens) the
propriety is in ^he Occupier, not that another man's ground and property reduced
into an Island, is to be ^nderstood an Island; as if a River being ^ivided at
the upper end, incompaseth ano^hers Ground, and is again united; in this ^ase
the property remains in him in whom it ^as. But this is to be taken in grounds
not ^imited, for in those that are limited, over^^owings signify nothing: Now
those are li^ited to which terms and bounds are ascri^ed. Where it is
distinguishable what is gi^en, what retained and left. Moreover an ^sland is
not to be appropriated to limited ^ossessions in the case of Vicinity, where
the River is public: But the property is rather ^n the Occupier, and
consequently in the King by Prerogative. Bract. ib. Flet. ib.


24. And this kind of accession is to be understood in case where the Channel
of a River is left by the River, the property of which shall be in them whose
possessions are next to the River bank, according to the latitude and extent of
their possessions near the bank; the property of the new Channel remaining
with that of the River, namely in the public, now in case where a River shall
take away part of my Fee by his new Channel, and shall return again to its
old; I cannot strictly by Law challenge any thing to my own Fee in regard the
property is i^ them whose possessions are next the bank: Though in Equity I
may. Bract. ib. Crom^. Juris. fol. 109.


25. But in case a River shall not make any new Channel in my Grounds but only
overflow them, there the Species as to the property is not altered, and thus
much for accession which is merely providentiall.

26. There is also another kind of Accession which is natural which by
joining one Species with another either of the same or diverse kinds, either by
sodering or ceme^ting, in which case the Minor shall give place to the Major or
more worthy or precious; but if neither be more precious, then every one may
claim his own. Bract. ib. Flet. ib.


27. The right of Accession takes place likewise in houses built, as if I build
another material upon my Soil, I shall be esteemed owner of the House because
the property of what is built follows the Soil, Fulb. tit. Devises f. 39.
Flet. ib.
nor yet does he that was owner of the matter cease to be owner still, nor yet
can he take (...) away, but he may recover double damages. And if the house
shall fall he may challenge what was his, if he have not recovered double; but
on the other side, if any one out of an evil intention build with his own
materials upon my ground, he is presumed to give me his material, but if it
be not through any evil intent, as supposing the ground to be his, I, who am
owner of the soil shall pay unto him the price of his materiall^ and his
Workmens wages, now this which has been said, it to be understood where that
building is immovable, for if it be moveable it is otherwise. As for example,
a new Barn of timber built or placed upon the Inheritance or Fee of John an
Oaks shall not be understood to be the Barn of John an Oaks. Bract. ib. n. 4.
Brit. c. 33. f. 86. Perk tit. Dower 328.


And this very Species of Accession which is by the Labor and Industry of man
may be assigned even to Letters for letters though writ in gold follow the
property of the Skins or papers in which they are written, as buildings do the
property of the Soil on which they are built, Bract. ib. n. 5. Plow. 223.
but it is otherwise in case of Pictures. For it were ridiculous that a
precious Picture should by accession entitle him to the property who was only
owner of a vile and inconsiderable Table whereon it was drawn, Bract. ib.
and therefore the Table shall follow the Picture.

29. So also in Textures for if any one shall interweave or imbrayder his
Purple in my garment although his Purple be much more precious then my garment,
yet by the right of accession it shall follow the property of the Vestment.
Bract. ib.


30. Likewise, the same Species of Accession in fructuaries and in those things
whereof we have the use but not the property concerning the revenues of income
of the inrease, Bract. ib. Flet. l. 3. c. 1.


31. But there is another Species of accession which is providentially natural
and is made by the cooperation of divine and humane nature from whence a
property is acquired, as for example, A. sowes another man's plant in his own
Soil the property of the Plant shall be in A. and on the contrary A. sowes his
own Plant in the Inheritance of B. B. shall have the plant, provided in both
cases that they take root, according to the verse.

Quicquid plantatur seritur vell inaedificatur.
Omne solo cedit, radices si tamen egit.
Whatever we do plant or build or sow,
Follows the Soil, if they with roots do grow.
But before they have roots they are his who first had the property, and this
is so undeniably true that if A. have a Tree which does so much overcharge the
Soil of B. that it takes rooting in it, the property shall be in B. for reason
will not permit that it should be in any other then in him in whose ground the
roots grow, so if a Tree be set in the bounds of Lands, and the roots reach
into another soil, the tree shall be common nor shall it be permitted the
Neighbor to cut up the roots, and this is to be understood in case where my
tree puts forth its roots so far into my Neighbors Soil, that without it, it
cannot live or grow; for where it has sufficient to maintain it without those
roots, it shall not be in Common. Bract. ib. n. 6. Flet l. 3. c. 2.


32. And by the same reason that Plants having taken root, and immovable
buildings follow the property of the Soil, by the same reason does any kind of
grain when it shall be sown and take nourishment and grow in the ground, nor is
it material whether it came there by accident or not. Bract. ib. Brit. c. 33.


33. There is also an accession by specification or changing the Species, as if
a man create a new Species out of a substance which was another, the property
shall be in him, that made the Species.

34. And in like manner by confounding, as in ^icquids, by confounding wine
with honey. So may there be confounding also of Solids, although it be wrought
with very much difficulty, viz. The Species, as Gold, Silver, Lead, Iron, the
product of which shall be common whether they will be separated or not) amongst
those by whose desire the bodies or Species were intermixed, so also in case of
an intermixture purely accidental, which will not admit of Separation, but if
it be possible to separate the substances, then each shall have his peculiar
part in weight and measure according to that which he had in the original and
rude matter. Bract. d. c 3. n. c. Flet. l. 3 c. 2.


35. But if one man's corn be mixed with another, the Corn shall not all be
common, but each one shall claim his share from the heap, according to his
quantity or measure of Corn, nor can there be any community in Corn; because
single bodis remain in their own proper substances, as in case A. his Herd
intermixeth with mine, it cannot be conceived that the Herd should become
common, and although it be very difficult, and in a manner impossible to
separate one man's corn from another, (...) there may be sufficient argument to
give^ (...)tle to the claim of an individual part, (...) the whole heap of
Corn were in comm^^ Namely, that he may claim so much of (...) heap as was his,
now there is a difference between confounding and mixing, and that (...) three
particulers. For Species are said to (...) mixed, and matters and substances,
to be ^^^founded. Also Species mixed remain in (...) same substance and
Species, but confounde^ they are transferred into another (...) Bract. ib.
Flet. ib.


36. If a man buy an Inheritance, (...) of another whom he believes to be them
owner of it, when indeed he is not, or sha^^ Bona fide receive it of gift or
upon any ^^ther just consideration. Natural Reason ^^leth that the profits
which he has receive shall be his for his tillage and care, Fulb. Bargains,
f. 13. b. and 14 Eli. 311. Dyer.
(...) this is not permitted to a wilful (...) of another man's Inheritance.
Cook, l. 1. 98. Perk. 529. Stat. Glocest. c. 1. An. 6. Ed. 1.


37. Now it is much questioned wheth^^ Tenant for life [which is almost all one
(...) the Roman Fructuarij] has any right (...) to profits and fruits
unreceived. And (...) Books distinguish between fruits growi^^ merely by the
operation of the divine na^^ for as to those they conclude that Tenant (...)
life may dispose them, either by his (...) Will and Testament, or otherwise.
Perk. f. 513 514, 515, 518, 519, 520.


38. There is a propriety gained by ^^^ding, as in case of Treasure found,
Bract. ib. and l. 3. tr. 2. c. 2. n. 3. Plow. 315. and 323.
no^ by Treasure we mean an ancient h^ardi^^ of Money or other Me^^all, whose
memor^ is so much worn out, that it has not now a^y owner; and so by the Law
of nature, it is ^is who found it, to exclude others, Flet. l. 1. c. 43.
other^ise if any man for gain, fear, or to keep it, ^ids and burieth any thing
under ground; this ^^all not be said a Treasure, and of this there ^^ay be
Theft committed. Treasure is suppo^ed the gift of fortune; and no one ought by
^he labor of his Servants to seek after it, ^or for it to dig up the earth,
and seeing Trea^ure is no particular man's goods, and was an^iently the finders
by the Law of nature, now ^y the Law of our Nation, it is become the Kings,
Bract. l. 3. tr. 2. c. 3. n. 4.
and this is true for things found ^n the earth, but it is otherwise for things
found in the Sea, Brit. c. 17.
as for other things which are found above ground, they remain ^he owners still,
if he make claim within a year and a day, nor is the property in the finder
^ntill he has made publication of the things found, in the Markets, and
Churches, next adjoining, Brit. ib. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 38. Dyer 121. n. 14.
yet at this day if they be things ^nanimate, they escheat to the Lord of the
Manor for ever, nor can any prescription of time entitle the finder unto them,
Brook, Act. sur le Case, 109, 113.
and the reason of difference is this: That animal things cannot be kept and
maintained without charge, which is otherwise in inanimate.

39. Those things which accrue unto us by Tradition or Livery, are ours by the
Law of Nations: Nothing being more consonant to natural Aequity, then to have
the will of the Donor confirmed when it transfers any thing upon another. Now
Tradition is a free transferring of a corporeal thing, either of ones own or
another, from person to person, with ones own hand or another as
administratory [provided it be with the will of the owner] into the hands of
another. And Tradition is nothing else in another sense, but the Induction of a
corporeal thing into possession, Bract. l. 2. c. 18. n. 2. Brit. c. 40. Flet.
l. 3. c. 2.
nor is it material whether the Owner himself deliver the thing given or sold
with his own hand, or another by his appointment as his Attorney, if himself
shall not be present, or a Messenger with Letters Patents of Attorney,
intimating and containing the will of the Donor or Selle^* Bract. l. 2. c. 18.


40. Now the bare will of the Owner (...) the case of Livery is sufficient for
the transferring of any thing to another, as changing the cause of possession,
Provided it be wit^ Solemnity, and that there does not wa^^ Witness, as in case
a man lets a thing to another, or grants it for term of life or years and
shall either sell or give the same unto him afterward, although he had it not
at first upon this Score, yet since the Owner himself suffers him to enjoy it
upon this or another account, it becomes his. In the same manner, if any one be
in possession of another right, without a just precedent cause, namely by
Intrusion or disseisin, and the owner wills that the Intruder or Disseisor shall
have it, it shall be his although the owner were not possessed of it at all, it
being supposed that possession and property in the thing came unto him by the
owners Will, as from him and by his own hands Bract. l. 2. c. 18. n. 2. Lit. l.
3. c. Releases. Flet. l. 4. c. 20.


41. Things sold and delivered are no otherwise, the Buyers then as paying the
seller for them, or otherwise satisfying him as by pledge or earnest, Bract. l.
2. c. 27 n. 1. Flet. l. 2. c. 51. Dyer, f. 76. n. 30.
unless the seller lets him have it upon his Credit. Dyer, f. 30 n. 203. Plow.
f. 432. and f. 5. and 9


42. Where Livery is to be given to any one either by the owner himself or his
Attorney, of any house by it self, or of any Message, by reason of a Fee, to
that intent that the Donee should have the possession until a certain Term
with all the rights and Appurtenances: It is not needful in this case to go
round all the Land, or set ones foot in every part or parcel of it, but it
suffices if Livery be given by a Door or by the hasp or Ring of a door; For
by this means he shall be in possession of the whole by the intention and view,
and by the consequences of possession, but if there be no house he may have
seisin [as it is commonly called] by a staff or twigg, and the mere setting of
the foot upon the Soil with a desire of possessing and an intention of the
Donor is sufficient, notwithstanding that it does not immediately inure to take
its effects, Bract. l. 2. c. 18. n. 2.
but without Livery of Seisin a Freehold passes not, either by Feoffment,
Gift, or Lease. Brit. c. 33. Bract. l. 2. c. 19 Doct. and Stu. c. 7. f. 14.
Lit. c. Attornment. Perk. from f. 206. to f. 216.


43. Those which the Romans called Missilia, or the Liberalities which Emperors
and Princes scattered among the People, are not so frequent with us as they
were with them, yet we have some mentions of them which carry the same Right
with them, as when the Conduits of London at the Coronations of Kings or other
such like solemnities (...) with Wine, every one has a property in the Wine he
there takes. Bract. l. 1. c. 12. n. 10. Fle. l. 1. c. 43. and 47


44 Whatsoever is left and forsaken, ou^ Lawyers term a Waife, this was
formerly by natural right the finders, but now by ou^ custom it is the Kings,
Bro. tit. Estray and Waife.
that also it called a Waife when any personal or moveable Chattell is
felloniously taken and being through the fear of the Felon left, has no owner
to claim it, Kitch f. 12 b. n. 39.
wherefore if any such thing be found, it is the Kings or the Lords of the
Manor, to whom this liberty and privilege is granted by the King, yet so that
Restitution is to be made, if the Owner claim it within a year and a day. Brit.
c. 17.


45. So any beasts that are found straying in any ones ground follow the
custom of things left, for even these also were by out ancient writers
included under the name of Waifes Bract. l. 1. c. 12. n. 10. Fl. l. 1. c. 43.
and 47
but others call them by a more particular name, Estrayes Brit. d. c. 17
which our Latins render, Extrahura: Because for the most part they break
forth and stray against their owners will, and these after a year and a day, if
not claimed by their Owners within a year and a day, Escheat to the King or the
Lord of the Manor where they were taken, Provided they be duly cried and
proclaimed in the Neighboring Markets. Brit. ib.


46. The same is to be understood of things cast out of a ship in a Tempest to
lighten the ship, or of such things which happen to fall out of a Cart when it
runs, the owners not ^owing of them, but in case of Shipwreck which we call a
Wreck) where neither any (...) the Passengers, nor any Catt or Dog ^^ts from
the Ship to the shore a live, what^^ever of the Goods or ship shall be cast
upon the Land by the Sea, shall be the Kings (...) the Lords of the Fee, to
whom the King ^^th granted this privilege. Brit. d. c. 17. and Westminster. 1. c. 4.

Of things Corporeal, and Incorporeall.
TIT. II.
THere are moreover of things, some which are corporeal and some which are
Incorporeal. Corporeal are such as may be touched, as Land, ground; things
immovable and moveable, which can move themselves, as living creatures and the
like, or which may be moved.

Things which are Incorporeall are such which can neither be seen nor touched,
as rights and Privileges, the right of walking, acting, conveying of water,
and the like. Bract, l 2. c. 12. n. 3. Flet. l. C. c. 3. Plow. f. 170.
Now rights and Services are the same, but have their appellations from a
diverse respect. Bract. l. 4. tr. 1. c. 37.
To this may be added the right of Pasturing, which we call common of Pasture*
Fishing, digging of Turfes, felling in other men's Woods, the right of
presentation to (...) benefice distinct from an Estate of Inheritance, which is
by us called Piscaryes, Turnryes, Estovers, Id. ib.
Advowsons in gross. Bro. Tenure, n. 15. and 18.
And lastly an Annual Rent, Doct. and Stu. c. 30.
now this cannot be said properly to be in possession, but (...) it were.

1. For things moveable or immovable our Law determines, Quatenus to the
Persons, and as they either are or are not in the po^er or property of man, Id.

Now property is (...) full and absolute right of disposing of, or selling any
thing corporeal, unless the Law and any condition hinder, Gothof. ad rubr. ^.
de aqu. rerum dominio. Lit. l. 1. c. 1. Bract. l. 2. c. 21 and 23. Brit. c. 40
Possession or Se^su^e, In Dominico, etc. Is properly of corpore all things,
and incorporeal we only say as of Fee. For that they are not absolutely
acquired by Livery of Seisin, but as it were, now this Seizure, In Dominico,
etc. Is twofold. Direct, or merely for use. Direct, [which is also termed
absolute] is that which comprehends both Property and use, The other consists
solely in the benefit and use of a thing. Bract. l. 4. tr. 1. c. 27. n. 6. and
tr. 4. c. 4. Fl. l. 1. c. 12.


2. The English have a full Dominion and Power of things corporeal and
moveable, but not of immovable if we except the supreme power and right of the
Crown; for the Subject has not an absolute freehold in their Lands and
Tenements, but a Fee only, and that fee does not comprise so absolute a power,
appears, not only by those Authors who write of Fees, Anto. Con. in Feodorum
Comment. c. 2. Matthae us ^^esenbecius in tr. de feodis c. 1.
but even by Littleton himself, when he says that such a one was seized of
such an Estate in his Demesne as of Fee, by which words he affirms the highest
and fullest title to be expressed. And these words, (as of Fee) do abate somewhat
of an absolute power, and argue a Tenure from a superior, but that these words
are sometimes referred to the Kings Demesne, In 27 H. 8 16.
is either from the ignorance of speaking and applying; or else that
distinction is maintained by which some will have a double acceptance of the
word Fee, viz. One by which a man holds an immovable thing by any Title to him
and his Heirs. The other by which one holds from another by Rent or Service,
or both, Flet. l. 5. c. 5.
whereas Fee in the second acceptance is never without the Oath of Fealty,
Terms of the Law, V. Fealty. Fulb. Paral. c. Seigniority, f. 19. b.
which the King never gave to any one as having an absolute Power. Fort. c. 9.
Bract. l. 1. c. 8. Brit. in Praemi.


3. Fee which is in latin Feodum, and by some Feodum, comes from the German
[Fief] which signifies an Inheritance held of another, Hottoman. b. disput. c.
11.
and is by those that write of Fees defined to be an immovable thing given to
another, in such a manner that the Property continues in the Power of the
Donor, but the benefit and use is to the Donee, and his Heirs, Males or
Females for ever. So long as the Donee and his heirs do faithfully their
Services to the Lord, Anto. Continus in Com. sup. feod. c. 3.
so that Fidelity or Fealty is the foundation of Fee and nothing else. Yet it
often happens that it is not bestowed Gratis, but for some small consideration
of Money in the name of Rent, or for Services, Duar. in Com. sup. feod. c. 12.
Smyth. Com. l. 3. c. 8.
but we understand by Fee, all which we hold to us and our Hei^^ Bract. l. 4.
tr. 3. c. 9. n. 6. Lit. l. 1. c. 1.


4. Fee, as it is taken for an Inheritance held of another, is held either of
the King or a Subject, or (that we may use our ow^ Phrase) a common person.
Fees that are held of the King are double, either in right of his Crown (which
we call Tenure in Capite) or of some Honor or Manor appertaining to the
Crown: But a Subject although he may have others who hold of him in Fee, from
whom he may exact Fealty, yet himself is either mediately or immediately
Feodary to the King, for all the Land of this Kingdom which is not held of
others by Services is held of the King and belongs to him, either as ancient
Demesne, escheats, or perquisites.

5. Fee is divided into many Species, either from the Effect, or from some
cause efficient or formal, but we shall only discourse briefly here of those
which we meet with most frequently in our Books.

6. Fee therefore is either Liege or nonleige some Feodists Duar. ib.
will have it to come from the Italian word [Liga] which signifies a Band or
League, and that because it ties and obliges the Vas^al. For Liege is properly
where any one swears Fealty to his Lord non-Liege is when with the exception of
another. The first is due only to the King, the later to common persons. 10 R.
2. and 11. c. 1. and 34. and 35. c. 3. Lit. l. 2. c. 1.


7. Again, Fee is either Royal or no^ Royal. Royal, is the greater, for that
it has somewhat of Royalty in it, as from whence any one is instituted from
the King ^eing absolute, without acknowledging a su^eriour. Of this sort are
those which had a ^ignity or Honor conjoined with the pow^^ of their
Privileges, and are by us styled ^^erties or Prerogatives Royal; as where ^^e
King grants by his Charter to any Sub^^ct the view of a Franck Pledge, the
Pleas (...) Impranding, the amendment of the faults (...) Assise, the adjudging
of Robbers, as infang^^eife and out^ang theife, Soc, Sac, Tol, Theme. ^o punish
by the Gallows, or other punish^ents which the execution of Judgment ^^all
require Goods of Felons, and which ^^pertain to the Peace, and consequently to
^^e Crown. Bract. l. 2. c. 5. n. 7. and. c. 24. and l. 3. tr. 2. c. 35.
Wrecks of the Sea, Whales, ^u^geons, Free warren, Fair, Bract l. 4. tt. 1. c.
46.
and those ^^her things which fall within the Kings ^erogative. But of these
Fees there are ^^th us certain degrees, since some have a ^^eater number, some
a lesser granted unto ^^em.

The first, the Principallity of Wales claims (...) right, Polid. Vir. in ed.
1. f. 343. lin. 28.
which from the time of Edward ^^e first did belong to the Kings eldest Son.
and the second is claimed by the four Pa^^tinates or Counties Palatine,
Lancaster, ^^rham, Chester, and Ely. 5 Elix. c. 23. 17 Ed. 4. c. 1. 27 H. 8. c.
25.


And these have those Fees which we cal^^d Honors which the King (besides the
Juris^^ctions contingent to Courts Barons) has ^^anted some, though not all
these Royall^^es out of his Munificence. 31 H. 8. c. 5. and 33. c. 37, 38. and
37. c. 18.


8. Thirdly, Fee is either noble or Ignoble, ^^oble is that which has any
Dignity annexed to it, or which enobles the Possesso^ or concludes him to be
noble. And of the sort with us are those which we call Mann^^ whose Lords have
some Jurisdictions, thou^^ not Royal over those which hold of their (...) Perk.
670. Fulb. par. Seig. f. 18. Kitch. f. 4
Ignoble, is that which depends of such Manor, and is granted to Countrymen
(...) their Heirs for some base Service; this (...) commonly called Freehold.

9. Fourthly, Fee is either new or an^^ent Homage Auncestrell.
new, is there where any one is first all invested by the chief Lord of the
(...) and that either by the Curtesy of the Lo^^ or for Money paid to the
former feoda^^ for he is the first of a new Family, who yei^^ Homage and
Fealty, Lit. l. 2. c. 7
ancient Fee is who the Feodary and his Ancestors, time out (...) mind, have
held such a Fee, and here the F^^dists Id. ib. and new terms, tit. Hom. Auncest.
place a Medium between these two, (...) paternal Fee which comes by four
degreese Descent, and they define that to be the a^cient which discends from
more. Duar. com. in cons. feod. c. 4. n. 10.


10. Fifthly, Fee is divided into ecclesias^^^^ and Laick or Seculer.
Ecclesiastic is the which is possessed either by Ecclesiastic persons or
which belongs to Churches. (...) that which is held by Lay persons, and cann^^
be possessed by Ecclesiastic, and indeed (...) Fees as with us laick, unless
they become ^^ther by some special grant from the King which we call giving to
Mortmain. Mag. Char. c. 36. 18 E 3. Stat. 3. c. 3. 15 R. 2. c. 5. Pol. Virg. l.
17. Eng. Hist.


11. Sixthly, Fee is distinguished (...) Masculine and Feminine. Masculine is
the which is given to the Feodary, and the Hei^ Males of his Body, and of this
kind (...) those of Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, (...) Barons, for the
most part. Which (...) defect of Heirs Males are extinguished, (...) return
into the supremacy, from whence ^^ey Issued, but these are at this day rather
^itles of Honor then Fees, in regard they ^re for the most part conferred
without (...). ^emenine, is that which may descend to ^^e ^^male Issue, as when
it is given indefinitely (...) the Feodary and his Heirs, and so that or
default of Heirs males it may come to ^he females and their Issue. Bract. l.
2. c. 34. and l. 1 c. 8. n. 4.


12. Lastly, Fee is either pure or simple, or ^onditionall. Simple is that
which is held (...) a simple and perpetual Right to the Feo^ary and his Heirs
for ever. Conditional, (...) that which is granted to the Feodary and ^uch or
such Heirs, for default of which it re^urns to the Donor and his Heirs, and
therefor he that has Lands given to him and his Wife, and to his Heirs
begotten of her, in ^ase she die without Issue before him, is called ^enant in
tail after hope or possibility of Issue ^xtinct For this kind of Fee with us is
called Fee-tail, coming from the French word [Tallier] to cut, part, or
divide, as if we should say a Fee by some means severed or diminished. Lit. l.
r. c. 1 and 1 Instit. Jur. com. c. 11. and 13


13. And this kind of Fee is double, viz. Tail general and Tail special.
General Tail is where a Fee is given to the Feodary and the Heirs of him
lawfully begotten or to be begotten, for in this case the Children of either
Wife, whether first, second, or third, shall inherit: special Tail is where a
Fee is given to the Feodary, and his Wife and to the Heirs of either of them
Lit. ib. Inst. Jur. c. 12. West. 2. c. 1.
or [according to some] when it is given to him and his Wife and one Heir of
their Bodies lawfully to be begotten, and one Heir of that He^^ only, Perk. 171
but this, whether it be properly to be styled a Fee for want of perpetuity may
(...) be doubted.

14. Now a Fee is not limited to one F^odary, but may be possessed by more, so
tha^ they are called Partners, Joynt-Tenants, (...) Tenants in Common. Lit. l.
3. c. 3 Inst. Jur. com. c. 15.
Partners are either by Law or custom, by Law are Sisters Co-heires, because
the Heirs Males being dead they equally succeed their Parents in the Fee, Id.
c. 1. and 3
by custom are Brothers in ma^^ Counties, especially in Kent, from the Custom
of Gav^lkind, called so from the equality of apportioning the Inheritance Id.
c. 2.
Joynt-Tenants are they which hold Lan^^ or Tenements by one and the same
Title, but not hereditary. Tenants in common (...) those which possess Lands or
Tenements (...) indiviso, by diverse Titles, as in case one Co-Heire sells her
part to a stranger, he is not Joynt-Tenant with the other Partners, but is
called-Tenant in common. Id. c. 4. Inst. Jur. com. c. 15.


15. A Fee with us is not only of Corporal things but incorporall also, for
the custody of a Forest, Vid. N. b. f. 6. Dyer, f. 30. n. 209.
Prison, Id. f. 41.
or County, 28 Ed. 1. Stat. 3. c. 8.
may be granted to one in Fee, and the same may be said of an annual Rent,
Vid. N. B. for. 8.
and of an advowson severed and not appertaining to any Manor, which we call
an Advowson in gross Lit. l. 1. c. 1. Bro. tit. Tenures, 105.
now there are many services pertaining to a Fee, which we shall mention in the
next Chapter.

16. There are belonging even as it were to the very nature of Fees, Fee farm,
free farm, and free Tenement, Fee farm is a Tenure of Lands and Tenements
granted to any one and his Heirs for a yearly Rent, which equals the third, F.
N. b. fol. 210. b.
or at the least the fourth part, Old Tenure ver. Fee farm.
of the true value without any other Services then what are expressed in a
Charter of Feoffment, West. part. 1. symb. 463.
some affirm that a Fee farm can only be granted for the life of the Farmer,
and some will have it Fealty although not expressed New terms of the Law.
in the Feoffment, and others that reasonable releife Bract. l. 2. c. 39. n. 9.
is due of right from the Fee-Farmer to the Donor, but the condition of this
Tenure is such, that if Rent be not paid by the Tenant for the space of two
years, then the Lord or Feoffer may recover the Lands to him and his Heirs
upon his action.

17. Britton makes free farm where Lands and Tenements are so given that the
nature of Fee by Feoffment is changed from Knights service to certain annual
Service, so that there is neither Marriage nor Releife requirable, nor any
other service expressed in the Feoffment Brit. c. 66.
but I do not remember that I have read this in any other Author.

18. Free Tenement or freehold is, where Lands and Tenements are held only for
life of the Tenant, and such a Tenant is said to hold, In Dominico suo ut de
libero Tenemento, Dyer f. 221. n. 19. and f. 153. n. 10.
But if it shall be said that Fee is naturally a Freehold. I shall not deny
it, only must add, that it is also somewhat more, because perpetual, Inst.
Jur. com. c. 10. Lit. l. 1. c. 6. Bract. l. 4 tr. 1. c. 37.
but of that Freehold which is meant here there are two kinds. One which is
for term of life even by the very custom and Law, the other which is so only
by agreement. Of the first sort are Tenants by the Curtesy of England, and
tenants in Dower, for such is the Civillity and courtesy of our nation, that if
a man marry a woman that is an Heir, and have Issue by her, born alive, that
Land of which he is seized in right of his Wife in her life time he shall hold
after her death for term of his own life, Bract. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 30. n 7.
Flet. l. 6. c. ult. Dr. and Stu. l. 1. c. 7. and l. 2. c. 15 Dyer, fol. 25. n.
159. and f. 95. n. 35. In. J. co. c. 8
which Law some ascribe to Henry the first, Spec. Just. l. 1.
a woman also whose Husband in his life time was seized in Fee, shall have the
third part of his Estate, he being dead, and in some places the half, Lit. l.
1. c. 9
in some the whole for her Dower, F. N. b. fo. 150. P. Bract. l. 4. ^r. 6. c.
13. n. 2. Dr. and Stu. Bri. 1. c. 10.
if at least she be nine years old that she may claim a Dower: Lit. l. 1. c. 4
Flet. l. 5. c. 22.
there is another sort of Dower which is freehold also, namely Dower which is
by consent, which is that that is agreed on before marriage at the Church door,
or otherwise between the man and Wife, Lit. l. ^. c. 4. Inst. Jur. com. c 9.
Flc. l. 5. c. 22 Brac. l. 2. c. 39.
briefly all Lands and Tenements which are either by bargain, gift, or any
other contract, held for term of ones own life or another, are comprehended
under the name of Freehold. Inst. Jur. com. c. 6 Bract. l. 2. c. 5. n. 7.


19. And as Fee Dyer, f. 213 n. 42. fol. 288. n. 55.
so free Tenement or freehold may be of a thing incorporall, as an office for
life. Bro. tit. Tenures, n. 25. Dyer, f. 211 n. 19.


Thus have I given you a description of estates in Fee, Inheritances, and
Free-holds, the third is a kind of possession or Tenure comprehended under the
name of Chattells ^^lls, and they are those which we hold (...) Term of years,
or at the will of another. ^enant at will is two fold, viz. either by com^on
Law, or by the custom of any Manor, which is by Copy of the Court Roll, or by
^erge, Inst. Jur. Com c. 2. 3. Lit. l. 1. c. 9. Kitch. fo. 102. b. Coo. l. 3.
case Heydon fo. 8. a. b. and f. 9.
But this kind we referr to the ^hapter of uses. Of which hereafter c. 4. of
this Book.
we all speak.

Of the Services which Inheritances are bound unto.
TIT. III.
BEcause Services are reckoned amongst those things which are termed
incorpo^l, we shall take a view of them; now there a certain service or
Servitude which sub^cts one man to another, See. l. 1. c. 3.
but it is not this which we intend here to treat of, but that which subjects
one Estate or Fee unto other. Yet is it like that other which ren^rs one man a
Servant to another, for as at constitution is called, Jus Gentium, the ^aw of
Nations, which against nature sub^^cts a man to the Power of another, so may
also be said of Service or that constitution which subjects one house to
another, and one state to another. And thus Services may (...) divided into
such as appertain to Cities and such as are Rural, Brac, l. 4.
those which be^^ng to Cities, and for the most part such as the Civil Law
mentions, namely such (...) inherent in the very buildings, and the^^fore
called from the City Fees, because (...) call all buildings City Inheritances,
tho^^ built in Villiages. Bract. ib.
Of this kind are th^^ not to build a House higher, not to hin^ lights or
prospects, to convey and keep (...) Gutters and sincks from the yard or (...)
of ones Neighbor, to lay a prop upon (...) there man's Wall or ground for the
supp^^tance of a House, to bear an Incumberan^^ to have a Way, Road, or
Passage. For thou^^ a Way and Road be Rural and Country Se^vices, yet are they
City also, when apply^ to City Inheritances. For it often happen that a
neighbor has a power and libe^^ of passing through a Yard belonging to (...)
House, or of going up ones stairs to (...) own chamber, Rural are such as are
not in^^rent to buildings but are wholly without them. And these also are
almost the sa^^ which the Civil Law reckons [if we exce^^ those which the
customs of Fees have intr^duced] as a Road, Pathway, Aqua duct, Dyer fo. 248.
n. 80. and fo. 319. n. 7.
drawing of water, folding of Cattle, pa^^ring of Cattle, quenching of Lime,
diggin^ of Sand, taking of Stone, and the like. No^ both the kinds of Services
are either real (...) personal, with relation to the thing or person to whom
they are due.

1. Fee Servitude which both by our F^^dists and Lawyers is called Service, is
either military and noble, or Rustic and Ignoble Fulb. divis. of seign. and
services f. 20. b.
military is that which performs some duty belonging to military discipline, or
some other thing that is honorable, and this also ^s double, one which is due
to the King only, Lit. l. 2. c. 8
the other to the Lord of the Fee, notwithstanding that he be Feodary to
another, that which is due to the King is double also, namely Serjeanty and
Castle-gard.

2. Serjeanty is either Grand or Petit, Grand is where any one in the name of
his Fee is personally bound to perform any Office or other honorable thing to
the King, id^b. Flet. l. 1. c. 10. and l. 3. c. 16.
which some also affirm may be due to a common Person Bract. l. 2. c. 35. n. 6.
of this kind is the bearing the Kings Standard or Spear in War, the leading
and conduct of his Army, the performing the Office of Martial, the sounding of
a Horn at the incursion of any of the Kings Northern Enemies, to send an armed
man, if himself will not go, to fight under the King when ever necessity shall
require, within the four Seas. to carry the Kings Sword before him at his
Coronation, to perform the Offices of Sewer, Taster, Carver, Butler, or
Chamberlain. Coo. l. 2. case Cromwell fo. 81. a.
And in such Services all the Barons in ancient time were obliged.

3. Petit Serjeanty is that which renders to the King as an acknowledgement of
the Tenure yearly, a Bow, Spear, Dagger, a pair of Gantle^s, or a pair of gold
Spurrs, an Arrow, a Horse, or any such small thing which belongs to War. Now he
that holds such a Fee, does not perform any personal Duty but rather
Patrimoniall and real, and that certain: And therefore differs somewhat from
the very nature of a military Service, having a property of a different
Species, ^it. l. 2, c. 9. Inst. Jur. Com. 27. Broo. tit. Tenures 69.
but Fleta will not have this duty exceed the value of half a mark. l. 1. c. 11.


4. Castle-gard we have defined to be a service due to the King only. Which is
originally true, because no man can erect a Castle or Fort in the Kingdom
without the Kings License; but in case the King grants a Castle with all the
liberties belonging to it, unto a Subject, he grants Castle-gard, also if there
be any such Service due unto i^* And for this reason this Service may as well
belong to a Subject as the right of a Forest Manwood par. 1. de. Jur. forset.
page 87. Cov. col. 4. fol. 88. a. and Lit. c. Socage.
It is a Service consisting in fortifying and defending any Castle of the Kings
or another Lords as often as the Feodary shall require. And this is properly
Knights Service when it requires the Person of the T^nant, but when it is
converted into a certain pecuniary mulct, payable every year for the fortifying
and guarding of a Castle, it is alt^red from the nature of Knights Service.
Tit. ib. Inst com. c. 27. Bro. tit. Tenures n. 58. F. n. b. fo. 259. A.


5. The second sort of Knights Service or Military which is due to common
persons as well as to the King, is called Scutage Plow. fo. 126. 129.
from Sculum, a shield. And he that holds by this is obliged at his own Charges
for a certain number of days to follow his Lord in the Wars against the
Scors: Lit. l. 2. c. 3.
They who hold by an entire and whole Knights Fee, Camd. B^it. 111.
which some determine to be 680. Acres of Land, some eight hundred Acres, some
fifteen pounds Sterling, some twenty pounds, 1. Ed. 2. c. 1.
and others forty pounds, Smiths. Com.. c. 18.
are bound to serve for the space of forty days, Bro. Tenures n. 19.
they which hold but by half a Knights Fee twenty days, and so accordingly,
Lit. l. 2. c, 1.


6. Now that certain differences between Lords and Feodaries, as well
concerning Arms as the time of Serving, viz. whether from the time of showing
or perfecting, to begin, might be removed, it appears in most places, that it
is by joint consent of Lords and Tenants agreed, that the Tenants shall pay
yearly a certain sum of Money to their Lords according to the value of their
Fee, and so to be freed from personal duties, id. ib.
from whence the thing it self seems so changed by degrees, that that service
which with our Ancestors was so uncertain, is in most Fees at this day reduced
to certainty and is called Scutage certain, Lit. l. 2. c. 5.
that uncertain kind being in diverse Manors quite extinct, now this certain
Seutage is Socage. Bro. tit. Tenures 28. 29.


7. There are also other real Services which at^end a Knights Fee, as the
shadow does the Body, as Homage, Fealty, Custody of Land and Heirs, Releife,
Marriage, Brac. l. 2. c. 35. Lit. l. 2. c. 4.
for these no time has hitherto exterminated. Polid virg. hist. ang. 16.


8. Homage which the Feodists call also, Hominium, Hottom. disp. de feod. 3.
is a real Service, Bri^, c. 66. spec. J^s^. b. 3. Flet. l. 3. c. 26.
which the Feodary yields regularly to his Lord at his first institution; by
prostrating himself on both Knees at his Feet with his head uncovered, io^ning
his hands and putting them between his Lords, who remains sitting, and
pro^^uncing these words or to the same effect. Hear Sir, I become your man from
this day forward of Life and Limb, and of earthly worship, and shall bear you
Faith for the Lands I hold of you (and if it be not the King that receives the
Homage) saving always the faith which I owe unto our Sovereign Lord the King,
so God me help, and the Contents of this Book, which said, the Lord shall
kiss him. Bract. l. 2. c. 35. n. 8. 9, Lit. sect. 2. l. 1. Inst. Com. c. 23.
17. E. 2. Brit. c. 68.


9. Ranulphus de Glanville, denies, than Bishop who is consecrated, or a Woman
may do Homage. l 9 Spec. 9. Inst. l. 1.
But Fitzherbert N. B. 258. f.
according to the Rule in the Register affirms, that a woman if single may
swear Homage and Fealty to the King, when from him she receives Livery of her
Lands, and our more modern Authors hold, that both Clergy and Women are subject
to this Service, although the terms of expression is a little different. For a
Clergy man for that he has set himself a part for the more special service of
God uses these words. I do Homage to you and shall bear your Faith for the
Lands and Tenements which I hold of you, saving always the Faith which I owe
unto the King our Sovereign; Inst. Com. c. 23. Lit. l. 2. c. 1.
and a single woman doing Homage does not say unto her Lord, I become your
Woman, for that it is not convenient that she should be another man's woman,
then her Husbands, whom she shall marry. But she shall pronounce the same words
which are prescribed to the Clergy, Id. ib.
and a woman who is married shall do Homage by her Husband. Id. ib.


10. If it happen that any one h^lds diverse Fees by Knights Service of diverse
Lords, he ^all do Homage to them all, but shall use ^^ese words in the end,
saving the faith which owe unto our Sovereign Lord the King, and unto my other
Lords. id. ib.


11. Now it is to be understood that Ho^age is always annexed to Knights
service, ^ut not solely to it, for Tenant in Socage ^ay also do it. Brac. l. 2.
c. 35. n. 6.


12. Homage is divided into new, and an^ient [called Auncestrell] new is that
which (...) performed by him who has a new Fee, Instit Com. c. 28. Lit. l. 2.
c. 7.
^ncient by him who has an ancient one, and that ancient has a double effect,
one that the Lord shall secure to his Tenant his Estate or fee, or (as our
Authors say) shall war^ant it against all men: The other, that he shall save
him quiet and harmless from any Services of another Lord, at least in respect
or relation to that Fee.

13. Fealty which our Authors also call Fiducia, is a real Service Brit. c. 66.
due from every Tenant to his Lord at his first induction, whether the Fee be
noble or ignoble, for such is the disposition of this contract, that whoever
holds by Fealty, only holds the most freely of any, one except the King, Smith
Com. l. 3. c. 8.
for no Subject can hold without Fealty, Lit. l. 2. c. 5. west. Simbol. l. 2.
Sec. 303.
and anciently he that broke faith with his Lord did forthwith forfeit his
Estate. Bract. l. 5. tr. 3. c. 6. n. 3.


14. Fealty is double, one is general, confirmed by the Oath of every Subject
to the sepremacy. The other special; due unto the Lord of the F^e, Le grand
constumier de Normand B. Fle. l. 3. c. 16.
the first is constantly exacted at Sheriffs Courts, and view of frank-Pledge

who are twelve years old, otherwise they have no warrant to continue in their
Estates, Brac. l. 3. tr. 2. c 1. n 1.

fourteen or fifteen id. ib. Flet. l. 1. c. 27.
years of age, the form of which Bracton thus explaines. They shall swear that
they will not receive or entertain, persons outlawed, Murderers, Robbers, or
Burglaries. Nor that they will consent or connive at them or their Receivers,
and that if they shall know any such, they will atta^^ them: and that if they
shall hear any H^^ and Cry, they shall immediately follow with their Family and
Servants, Brac. cod. Flet. cod.
and Britt^^ more briefly, c. 12.
when he says that they shall swear to bear says unto the King, and that they
shall neither be Felons themselves nor consent to felonies.

15 The form of fealty special is double* One which is proper to freemen, the
other to Villains. When a freeman swears fealty to his Lord, he lays his
right hand upon the Book and says as follows, Know you this my Lord N. that
J. M. shall be faithful and true unto you, and faith to you shall bear for the
Lands which I hold of you at the times assigned; So help me God and all Saints.
Lit. l. 2. c. 2.
When a Villain swears fealty, he shall hold his right hand a little higher
then the Book, so that he touch it not, and shall say. Know you this my Lord
N. that J. M. shall from this day forward be true and faithful to you, and
faith to you, shall bear for the Land which I hold of you in Villainage, and I
shall be justified by you in body and goods, so help me God and all Saints. 14.

16. Custody or Guard is a real service proper to a Knights fee, by which the
Lord has the guard and care of the fee, and that to his own use, without
giving any account during the minority of the Infant, his Tenant: As also the
Education and Guard of the Body of the Heir. Now every one is with us an Infant
till 21. years of age, if a Male; for our Law presumes, that Knights service
cannot be duly performed till that age. Fortesc. c. 44.
But we have spoken enough of this already: Only this we shall add, That the
Lord may, if he please, alien this his title of Guardianship as well as any
other thing which he has; whence it is, that there is a double Guardian,
namely, one of Right, as the Lord of the fee: The other in Fait, which is, he
to whom the Lord has aliened the Guard of the Heir and Lands, or of the Heir
only. Inst. com. c. 24.


17. Releife is a real service or Patrimoniall (though some call it aptly a
fruit or beneficial profit of a service) Coo. l. 3. case Penantes, fo. 66. a.
due both to Knights service Brac. l. 2. c. 4. Lit. l. 2. c. 4. Brit. c. 66.

and Socage. By which the Feodary, Tenant by Knights service, whether male or
female, being at full age at the death of the Ancestor (viz. the male 27. the
female 14. years of age) is obliged to pay a certain sum of money. Tenant in
Socage paying so much for Releife as he pays Lit. l. 2. c. 5. 19. H. 7. c. 15.
Bro. Tenures, 76 Flet. l. 3. c. 17.
yearly by way of Rent to his Lord. At what age soever he be at the death of
his Ancestor, and that without delay, Dr. Stu. l. 1 c. 7. Flet. l. 1. c. 9.
so that the first year he pays his Rent double, one by way of Releif, the
other part by way of Rent Flet. l. 3. c. 17.
. For the Lord may immediately distrain, that is, take whatever he finds upon
the Estate by way of pledy, until he shall be satisfied for his Releife Littl.
l. 2. c. 5.
. So if one hold by fealty, and a pound of Pepper, the Heir shall pay the first
year two pounds of Pepper. And the Law is the same, where the Tenant pays for
his Rent yearly a certain number of Capons or Hens, or a pair of Gloves, or so
many bushels of Corn, or the like. But if in regard of the season the Tenant
cannot pay Releife presently, then the Lord ought to expect until a convenient
time. As in case he be bound to pay a Rose, or a bushel of Roses at the Feast
of St John Baptist: Here, if he dye in Winter, the Heir ought not to be
distreyned by the Lord, until the season come that Roses may be had Littl. ib.
. This the Feodists define to be a Present or Gratuity which the new Vassal
bestows upon his Lord for admission upon the death of another: Or for any other
cause which shall occasion the Estate to come unto him, in regard it is now
taken up by a new one Hotoman, verb. feodalis ver. Relevium.
.

18. And it is to be observed, that the Heirs of Earls or Barons, ar others,
that hold of the King in Capite (that is, in right of his Crown) by Knights
service. If they are at full age at the death of their Ancestors, shall pay
their accustomed Releife, Viz. an Earl 100. pounds, a Baron an Hundred Marks.
The Heir of a Knight for one Knights Fee 100. shillings: And if there be any
who hold ^y a double Knights fee 200. shillings, and ^o according to the rate,
Mag. Chapter c. 2. Instit. com. c. 24. Flet. l. 3. c. 17.
which is also ^rue in the cases of other Lords of Fees. Brac. l. 2. c. 36.
Brit. c. 69.


19. The Ancients derived this word Re^eife, a Relevando, because the
Inheritance which lay still by the death of the Ancestor, was raised up into
the hands of the Heir: And for this raising up, there should be a cer^ain fine
or acknowledgment paid by the Heir, and this they termed Releif. Brac. ib.
Brit. ib.


20. Marriage is a real service belonging ^o a Knights fee, by which the Lord
of the ^ee has a power of bestowing his Feodary in Marriage according to his
pleasure, or at least of claiming the value of the Marriage, ^f so be that he
be under age at the day of the death of his Ancestor; but of this we have
spoken enough before. Now Marriage is an Equivocall word, since it signifies
also the fee it self which is given in Matrymony Brac. l. 2. c. 34. and 39.
. And this shall suffice of services that are noble.

21. That service which ^s rural and ignoble, is by us called Socage, from the
French word (Soc) which signifies a Plough, or Soccage, as Sockage: The cause
of which Appellation was, that these kind of Tenants were by our Predecessors
bound to the service of the Soc, or Plough, and came yearly when the Season
required, with their Oxen to plough and sow some part of their Lords Land. But
by process of time it is now become so, that these kinds of works are in most
places changed into a certain Rent, although the ancient name of the service
remains still. Lit. l. 2. c. 5. Inst. com. c. 31.
So that this Tenure which at first was slightly esteemed of, is now accounted
mud the better; for the original labors are converted into a moderate sum
of money, only the value of the yearly rent is exacted for Relief, and it is
obliged neither to Gua^^ or Marriage. Dyer, fol. 362. n. 18.


22. Wherefore Socage which at first was purely a Villain and Rural service, is
now ^^vided into free and Villain. Free Socage (...) that which in lieu of
villain services pays (...) the Lord a certain annual rent. Brac. l. 2. c.
35. n. 1.
Vill^^^ Socage is double, that ancient, Viz. by which there is a certain
service performed by reason of the Fee, for this is even still in use Lit. l.
2. c. 5 Inst. corn. c. 31.
And the other which is pure villainage, in which there is obligation to
uncertain services, and undetermined, where one cannot tell over night what
service will be required next morning, Viz. where any one by reason of his fee
or person is engaged to do whatsoever is commanded him. Brac. l. 2. c. 8. n. 3.
vet. N. B fol. 49. Brac. l. 1. c. 11. n. 1. Bri. c. 66. fo. 165 b.
But our Moderns do not subject those who hold in Villainage to such uncertain
services. But call that villainage where a villain Tenant according to the
custom of a Manor or will of the Lord, or a Freeman by reason of his fee,
performs service duties to the Lord of the Fee: As to carry Dung out of a City,
or ou^ of the Manor of the Lord to his Lords lands, and the like. Lit. l. 2.
c. 11. Inst. com. c. 34. Bro. c. 66. n. 9.


23. That Fee therefore which is held by free Socage, enjoyes the best
Conditions of any other at this day, being freed from the encumbrances of Guard
and Marriage, Smith Com. l. 3. c. 5.
which to Tenants by Knights service often falls out most heavy. But this at
present, if taken according to the utmost latitude of its signification, is
understood to include all other kinds of Tenures, which are held by a certain
Rent, free from Guard and Marriage, Brit. c. 66.
as those which are held by Franckalmaign, Id. ib.
or in ancient Demesne of the King Id. lb. Lit. c. Socage.
by fee-farm, Brit. ib.
in free Banck Id. ib.
or Burgage. Bro. tenures n. 5. and 77.


24. The service of Franck-almaign, if at least we may call that a service,
which pays neither fealty nor any terrene duty to the Donor, is where a fee is
given to an Abbot or Prior and their Covent, or to a Dean and Chapter, to a Mr.
of an Hospital, or any Body or Person Ecclesiastical under that capacity or
notion: That they should pray for the souls of the Donor and his Family living
or dead. But this at present can be done only by the Supreme power; for that
there is a Statute Westminst.
which prohibits any from granting their fee-simple to be held of himself.
Wherefore whosoever from that time [the King excepted] gave an Estate in
Franck-almaign, did in vain add that word [Franck-almaign] because it wrought
nothing, but that the Donees held the same Estate of the Superior Lord by the
same services which the Donor held it, whose act could prejudice none but
himself. Bro. tenures 61.
But it seems the Capital Lord might remit these services, and so make it
Frank-almaign. Id. ib. 71. 97.


The service of ancient Demesne is that which the Tenants of the ancient
Demesn^^ of the King performed. Now ancient D^mesne is all that which was
immediately hel^ of the King St. Edward, o^ ^illiam the Conqueror. Term. law.
Ancient Demes.
For the later took an exact survey of the whole Kingdom, so that he^ might
know of what Lord every rodd (...) ground within it was holden: This survey he
caused to be entered into a book, which is yet remaining in the public
Exchequer, by him styled ^^nchester Roll, or Doom^day. Camd. Br. c. 94. Coo.
pref. to his 3 d. book.
Now by ancient Demesne, we understand all those Manors which were there
assigned and ascribed to the King, namely, because they were the Kings Demesne
(...) Ancient: and the service by which these Tenants hold of the King is
Socage. F. N. B. fo. 13. D. and 14. B. C.
But these had a double manner of holding, V^^. some by Charter, and were
called the Kings free Tenants: Others by Seals, which we call Copies of Court
Rolls: Or by the Verge, and these were styled the Kings free Sockmans. Brac. l.
2. c. 8. n. 4. Brit. c. 66. F. N. B. fol. 14. D. Flet. l. 1. c. 8.
Neither of these are Tenants at the will of the Lord, but by services first
due, according to the Custom of the Manno^. Kitch. fol. 99. Brit. c. 66.
Many Writers have treated of the liberties and privileges which these Tenants
had, that they might have the greater leisure to attend the Kings business.
Brit. ib. F. N. B. ib Lit. l. 2. ^^st. com. c. 35. Flet. l. 1 c. 8.


26. The service which is performed also by Tenants in Fee-farm, is Socage, in
regard Fee-farm cannot be where Guard and Marriage are reserved to the Lord by
Charter. Brit. ib.
And the same is to be understood of Tenants in Franck Banck. Brit. ib. Br. l.
4. tr. 6. c. 13. n. 2.


27. Burgage is a certain Rent payable by those which inhabit the ancient
Buroughs or Cities (which spring from them) of this Kingdom, either to the
King, or another Lord to whom the King has granted it: And this also is called
Socage. Littl. l. 2. c. 10.


28. Having passed so cursorily over these, we are to know, that there be many
more Fee-services behind, which are partly proper to Tenants in Knights
service, partly to Socage, and some common even to both, as secta ad curiam,
secta ad molendinum, Herriot, Aid, to make the Son a Knight, or to marry the
Daughter, Quit-Rents, and others, which for that they depend upon diverse
Customs of several places, and upon the several will of Lords, is impossible
punctually to reckon. Bro. Tit. Tenures, n. 50. and 53. and 58.


29. Secta ad Curiam is a service which binds the Tenant to frequent the Court
of his Lord: F. N. B. fol. 158.
But they are not Feodaries alone who are obliged to this; For we have mention
made of a fourfold suit of Court. One by Covenant and Oligation, Viz. when
another who is not the Lord of my Fee, Covenants with me or my Ancestors,
though not his Feodaries, to perform this suite of Court. Another by Custom,
where any one and his Ancestors time out of mind, were wont to come to the
Court of another and his Ancestors, though not Lord of their Fee. The third we
may call a Servile suit, which the Feodary performs to the Lord under the
notion of service. The fourth is Royal, by which are found to go twice a year
to the Sheriffs Courts, or Leet Courts, that they may not be ignorant of what
is done there for the peace of the Commonwealth. Now our Authors call it
Royal (though by corruption some rearm it real) because the maine reason of
it is, to perform Legiance to the King, for there all above 12. years old
Terms of the Law, Tit. sug.
take the Oath before mentioned.

30. Secta ad molendinum is a service by which the Feodaries, as bound by
Custom to carry their Corn to be ground at the Mill of their Lord. F. N. B.
sol. 122.


31. Heriot, otherwise Hariat, is compounded of the Saxon words (Here and Geat)
Here signifying an Army, and Geat a Journey: and it was a Tribute payedunto the
Lord when he went to War. Lamb. (...), Vero. Heriot.
Bracton says that Heriot is alone with Releife: L. 2. c. 36.
And Britton, C. 69. and Flet. l. 1. c. 18.
That it is the Gift of the Feodary at his Death, given to his Lord, by which
he leaves unto him the best Beast he has, or some other thing according to
Assignment. And he says, that this does not touch the Lord, nor the Heir or
Inheritance, not that it is to be likened to Releif. But that it rather springs
from the love and courtesy of the Tenant, coming either from a Right or
necessity of Duty, and that both from villains and Free-Tenants. Heriot is at
this day a service by which the Tenant is bound to leave to his Lord the best
Beast, or for defect of that, some other moveable which he has at the time of
his Death. And this is two-sold, namely, servile, which Tenant in Fee simple
pays, or constumary, which is ^yed by Tenant for life according to the
^ustome. Bro. Tit. Heriot. n. 5.


Of Uses and Profits.
TIT. IV.
IT appears from what has been said, that Services are either real or
personal, Brac. l. 4. tr. 1. c. 39.
(...) real we have already spoken, personal ^re such as are due unto the
person, Id. ibid.
and ^is kind is twofold, one due from the person of one, to the person of
another, of which ^lso we have made mention before, the other which is due from
an estate to a person, of which sort are profits, uses, Habitation; where^^re
uses and profits, in respect of the person to whom they are due is a Right in
re^pect of the thing which is due, a Ser^ice. Id. l. 4. tr. 1. c. 37. n. 1.


1. Since there are none in England besides the Sovereign power, who has a
plenary and absolute dominion over immoveables, it is not hard to discern who
they are, that are Possessors of estates, as to the profits, the estates being
not wholly theirs, which we shall term usufructuarii; and who nor, namely
whether all Subjects, by what Title soever they hold, or only some who hold by
this or that Title, for those which have a Fee, have only a power profitable,
Wesenbec. d^ feod. c. 1. n. 4.
which according to the Feodists cease, they violate the faith due to their
Lord, (...) not by our Law, save in Case of Felony; Stanf. plac. Coron. l. 3.
c. 30
now he which has any use or profits lo^^ has some way or other a power also,
Bra. l. 4, tr. 1. c. 36. n. 2.
Moreover he which has a Fee-farm, who^ the Civil Law of the Romans called
E^phytenticus, * vectigal ager.
which is one that has an^ state to improve, although he have a perp^tuity,
yet he pays a yearly Rent, by (...) of an acknowledgement of the Seign^rie.
Brit. c. 66.
Lastly, he that has a Freehold and abuses it, is liable to an Action (...)
Waste, F. n. b. fo. 55 Dr. Stu. l. 1. c 23 flet. l, 1. c. 12
which should not be, were (...) sole Lord, and had absolute power in (...)
disposing of it; but Bracton is very clear (...) declaring what Titles our
Lawyers inc^^^ under the notion of uses and profits, for (...) stinguishing
between a Freehold, and a^^ state in profits; he is much more diligent^
distinguishing between Fee, l, 4, tr, 1, c. 36 Plow, fo, 83,
and F^^ Farm, or farming of the profits, for the in those the possessor has a
perpetuity, in the^^ only an estate for life, whence it follows, the he only
is an usufructuary in an Estate (...) us, who has Lands or Tenements for Te^
of years, or at the will of another, or (...) who has Lands by way of pledge
or security which we call Mortgage, or by way of E^^cution, whom we call
(according to the ^^versity of the cause) Tenant by Elegit, Tenant by Statute
Staple, or Statute Merchant or lastly, he who has the Lands of an (...) in
Right of Guardianship, until he come to full age.

Now an estate of profits may be created with us, either by gift and bequest,
or by conditional agreement, Inst. com. c. 5 Flet l. 1. c. 12.
and it appears that our ancestors did sever the profits of a Fee from the
propriety, until it was changed by Act of Parliament, 27. H. 8. c. 10. Co^. l.
1. Chudleys Case.
but those estates which are held by Copy of Court Roll, or by the Verge, at
the will of the Lord, cannot be Leased out without the consent of the Lord,
above a year, Instit. com
nor can they be bequeathed or aliened by any agreement, without being first
surrendered into the hands of the Lord, and from thence received by him to whom
the former Tenant desires to alienate them. Id c. 15.


3. It is held also amongst us, that uses and profits may be of those things
which are extinguished by use and daily change, so that without all doubt one
may bequeath or by agreement create an use of Servants, Money, Oxen, Cowes,
Sheep, Corn, or any such like things. Bro: Tit Tenures 133: Plow: 542:


4. Now these kinds of uses and profits are dissolved, either by the death of
the Usufructuary, Instit: com. c: 5:
as Copyholds, or for Treason, in which Case the Delinquent loses all his
goods, and life also, F. n: b. 2. 3: 201
or by process of time, namely when the years for which they were made are
expired, by Consolidation, Co. l. 2: fo. 17: a, Plow: 419: 420:
when the Usufructuary purchases the property, and lastly through the default
of the usufructuary, as for waste, or letting his estate to another, contrary
to Right and Law. Flet, l: 1: c: 14 Mag: char: c: 4, Westmin, 1, c: 47: Stat,

Of Use and Habitation.
TIT. V.
USus has as large an extent with us, as usufructus has with the Civilian 27
H. 8. c. 10. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 22.
, but I do not see any cause why the same Law which the Romans had, both for
use and habitation, may not take place with us, there being nothing which I
have ever read which might either hinder the giving and bequeathing of them, or
purchasing them by agreements: but yet I find nothing specially or positively
determined by our Lawyers, from whence I may with confidence aver^e any thing.

Of Customs and Prescriptions.
TIT. VI.
IT has been said before, how that Title and Dominion over corporal things is
through a just act, and purchase transferred by Livery: Now we are to declare
how it may be transferred without by Custom, namely by a long, continual, and
peaceable and quiet possession, through usage and time, and without Livery,
Brac l. 2. c. 22. Flel. l. 3. c. 15.
for Prescription has sometimes the force of Livery. Brit. c. 4. Brac: l: 4:
tr, 1, c: 38 n, 13


1. Justinian for the most part puts a difference between Custom and
Prescription, as that the first should be of movables, the later of
immoveables, Prat us lexi. verb, p^aescrip,
yet they are often used promiscuously. Vultaeius com sup, Justin: n, 6, and 10,


2. Movables are not always taken the lame way by Custom, for such as are
bought in a public Fair or Market, although stolen, are immediately the buyers,
the sale being legal, viz. the Toll, if there be any due, paid, and a
coutract entered, so that the Owne^ can no way be evicted: but a Horse v, tit,
barg, and sale, l, tit, 24. Dier,
which is stolen, is thus by the Custom made ones own, viz. If it be ridden in
an open Market or Fair, by the space of a full hour, fo, 77. n, 66,
or otherwise shall be led there, continually and openly, that he may be shown,
and f 2 and 3, Pb, and Mary c: 7:
then the Seller coming to him that keeps the Toll book, showing the Horse, and
telling his own Christen name, and surname, as also his possession and place of
dwelling, proving all this by one witness, who is well known unto him that
keeps the Toll, he is to enter it into the Book. 31 Eliz, c. 12


3. Any Beast or Cattle found straying in the fee of another is by the
Custom, after public Proclamation made in the neighboring markets, due to
the Lord of the Fee, unless the owner challenge it within a year and a day,
Brit, Dr, Stu, 2, c, 3, and 51:
so also are such things which are left and forsaken, which we call waifes, Id.
ib:
as also such as are brought to Land from Shipwracks, if they fall not under
the notion of wrecks, (k) but all other things whether given or found, or
happening through their over heaviness do not follow the same rule, much less
things which are stolen; New book of Entries, verb. Pro. Brac. l. 2. c. 5. n. 2.
Brit. c. 17.
yet the Citizens of London are said to have a Privilege, that whatsoever any
one buys appertaining to his own Trade, and brought bona fide to his shop to
be bought, it becomes immediately his own without all fear of eviction. Dyer s.
121 n. 16.


4. Prescription is a legal definition, or limit of time ordained for this
end, that in all transactions for peace sake there may be an opportunity
observed, all Prescriptions tending to this, that nothing may be done in the
Common wealth later or sooner, then seems just and equal. Moreover in the
mannaging of affairs, it is fitting that we should have limits of time
prefixed, both to quicken industry, and avoid precipitation. Prataeus ubi supra.


5. But Prescription differs from Custom, that only coming from possession,
adding a new Right, and adjoining a new Title to the thing acquired, having
subtracted the other, whereas Custom does nothing so, for that it only
imparts its own Laws to those by whom it took its Original, and by whose
usage and consent it receives perfection. Conna. l. 1. Commen. Jur. Civil. 10.
n. 8.


6. Prescription although in the common acceptance it be such a portion of
time, as exceeds the memory of man; Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 8. Kitchen 104.
yet has it much of diversity amongst us; but for orders sa^^e we have thought
fit to divide it thus, viz. into that which works to the secure avoiding of a
loss, and that which works to the certain ^cquiring of a propriety.

7. For the avoiding of damage, this is ^heif, where any sum of money is
adjudged, ^o the King by any Statute for an offense, ^here the offenders may
after two years clap^ed, prescribe to themselves immunity, but in Case where it
is due to the King, and another as Informer, then against the suit of the King,
after two years, and against the Information of the common person after one
year, 31 Eliz. c. 5
unless such penal Statute does particularly prefixe a certain time, and in
this Case there is great difference in Statutes, some allowing one year, 3 H.
7. c. 1. 2 and 3 Ph. and Mar. c. 3. and and 5. c. 2. 1 Eliz. c. 7. 14. c. 11.

8. Things immovable, whether corporal or incorporall have diverse
Prescriptions. The most usual is that which is called the longest, and is
extended beyond the memory of man, for whosoever will prescribe against another
the maintaining of a Chaplain, to celebrate Divine Service in any Church, new
bo: Ent: Act. in Chaplein

12. Nor can a prescription be of those pertinencies whose principles have not
a perpetual and durable continuance, Dier. fo. 70. n. 40.

have lain dormant, or his Assise or Writ of entry to gain a possession as it
were lost by him to whom it appertained, Thaleat. Digest. br. l. 10. c. 21.

has provided and fitted apt remedies for the difference in each case. 32. H.

Of Gifts.
TIT. VII.
THere are many ways of Acquisition by the civil Law, viz. By way of Gift,
succession, Testament, and others as shall appear hereafter, Bract. l. 2. c. 4.
Flet. l. 3. c. 2.
but in regard, that amongst all the other causes, the most great, known and
famous is that of Donation or gift, therefore it does worthily challenge the
first place, for that by it, there is a more great and frequent acquisition
then any other. Brac. cod. c. 5. n. 2. Brit. c. 34.


1. Donation is a certain institution which proceeding out of mere Courtesy
and will without any coercive or compulsive Law or Right transfers a thing unto
another. And (to give) is to render a thing his that receivs it effectually,
otherwise that Donation or Giving were useless, which could be revoked and
made void. Bract. eod. n. 2. Brit. ib. Flet. l. 3.


2. Our Authors do frequently call a Donation a Feoffment, but the word
Donation has a greater latitude; for that it does not only comprehend a free
alienation of immoveables, but of some movables also, Bract. l. 2. c. 26.
yet in Lands, these appellations are distinguished thus. A Feoffment is of a
Fee simple to the Donee or Feoffee, and a Donation or Gift is of an Estate
tail. Lit. l. 1. c. 6.


3. Donation in the largest signification, is thus divided, viz. That it is
either amongst those who are still living, or upon occasion of Death. Of which
we shall speak hereafter. Brac. l. 2, c. 5. Flet. l. 2. c. 57.
Of gifts some are simple and pure; as namely, those which proceed, no Law or
right, either civil or natural enforcing, no Reward, Fear, or Force
interveneing, from the mere free bounty of the Donor, and where the Donor will
not in any case that the thing given should revert to him; Brac. l. 2. c. 5. n.
3. and l. 2. c. 10. Flet. l. 3. c. 3. and c. 8
another is from a future Cause, namely where any cause is interposed for which
a thing shall or shall not be, Dier fo. 33. n. 34.
under which kind, fall gifts by reason of Marririage, Dower, Glan. l. 7. c.
1. and c. 18. Bract. l. 2. c. 7. Flet. l. 3. c. 9.
or Death, etc. As if one gives any thing with such an intention that it shall
be the Donees when a subsequent thing is performed. And these kind of Gifts
are not properly Donations when they are conditional, Bract. ib. Bri. c. 34.
F. N. B. f. 205. h. Flet. l. 3. c. 11.
but Donation is sometimes with relation to a cause past, Brit. c. 35. lit. c.
5. fo. 76
and sometime, with relation both to past and future causes, Plowden fo. 455 n
Bract. l. 2. c. 5.
and some Donations are free and pure, some under conditions and suspended, 3.
Brit. c. 35. F. N. B. fo. 205. d. Plow. fo. 30. and. 32.
some absolute and large, some strict and limited to certain Heirs, and some
excluding Succession. Bract. l. 2. c. 7. Brit. c. 35. Doct. Stu. l. 1. c. 24.
l. 2. c. 6. Lit. l. 1. c. 23. Flet. l. 3. c. 3.
So also some Donations are by writing, some without. Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 16.
Bract. l. 2. c. 16. Brit. c. 39. Flet. l. 3. c. 9.


4. Wherefore we are to see who can give and who not, and it is generally to be
understood, that every one, who by Law and Right are not prohibited, may give,
Bract. cod. n. 4. Flet. l. 3. c. 3.
now all those are prohibited, who have not a general and free administration
of what they have, as Wards who are under tuition and pupillage, not being able
to govern themselves, yet they may receive and render their condition better,
but they cannot give either with or without the authority of their Guardians:
So neither one that is deaf and wholly deprived of his hearing, but it is
otherwise if he can hear, though with much difficulty, the same is also to be
understood of one that is dumb and cannot speak. Yet (according to the opinion
of some) they may consent by signs and nods, but it is generally held that he
who is dumb can not make a gift, because he cannot consent to it; so neither
can a mad man work that is not Compos mentis, unless he enjoy any Lucida
intervalla, Id. eod. Brit. c. 34.
but the Church executes in the stead of a Ward. Bract. eod. Brit. c. 54. Flet.
l. 3. c. 3.


5. He cannot make a gift who is a Captive so long as he is in the custody and
under the power of his Enemies, because he cannot possess who is possst by
others; not make a Gift effectually, seeing he possesses nothing, Bract. l. 2.
c. 8 n. 4. Dr. St. l. 2. c. 43.
the same also for the very same reason, may be said of a Servant; for that he
possesses nothing so long as himself is in the possession of others, Bract. l.
2. c. 16.
yet it seems he may give any such thing, whereof his Lord has not as yet
taken possession or Scisin. Lit. c. Vall.


6. Formerly a Leaper could not make a Gift, as being put out of the society of
men, Bract. l. 2. c. 5. Brit. c. 34.
nor has a Bastard any Heirs to whom he may give effectually under that
notion, unless it be those who are lawfully begotten of his own Body. Bract.
and Brit. ib. Perk. tit. Grant. 48.


7. He that is attainted of Treason, or convicted of any other capital
offense, cannot make a gift after the Felony committed; if so be he be
afterward iudicially convict and condemned by sentence, Bract. l. 2. c. 13.
Brit. c. 34 Stanf. Pla. co. l. 3. c. 32. Flet. l. 3. c, 7. and l. 3. c. 10.
Fulbeck. Seigniories f. 26. Perkins Grants 29.
yet in some cases he may before conviction make a gift of Chattells. Vid. next
Chapter.


8. Nor can any one give who has not Seisin of the thing given: except the
King only, Dyer fo. 108. n. 28. 29. 30.
which according to the ancients is true also, notwithstanding that he have
Dominion and receives Services. Eract. c. 5. Spec. Just. l. 2. c. de contractes
Flet. l. 5. c. 15.


9. Nor are gifts made between man and wife worth any thing, for a man cannot
give to his wife, nor e converso, during coverture: Because such gifts between
such persons are prohibited. But if they be made before marriage, or after
Divorce, they are valid, provided they be not upon the score of subsequent
marriage; yet a man may by his last Will and Testament, give a Fee simple to
his wife, and the reason of the difference is; because a will is not of force
before the death of the Testator, Lit. l. 2. c. 10. lib. Assis. pla. 60
and then the Husband and wife cease to be one and the same person. Bro. devise
34


10. Nor can any man effectually give that which is another; Bract. l. 2. c.
24. Plow. fol. 528.
nor can one who is beyond Sea according to some, Glan. l. 7. c. 1
make a gift, but others maintain the contrary, which is the better opinion.
Bract. c. 5. n. 8
The wife cannot make a gift without the Husband, nor can the Husband without
the wife of such lands as are the Wives. Brit. c. 34. F. n. b. f. 163. A. B. C.
D.


11. Moreover the Statutes of this Commonwealth have set such bounds to
Donations and Gifts that they permit not any man to make gifts to the
defrauding of his creditors, beyond his limits. 13 Eliz. c. 5. and 27 Eliz. c. 4


12. There are also some who cannot make Gifts without the consent of others,
as Arch-Bishopps Bishops, Abbots, and Priors, Cannot give Lands without the
consent of the King, or some other of their Lords. Because the consent of all
them whom the thing may any way concern is necessary and requisite, Bract. d.
c. 5. n. 7. Brit. d. c. 34. F. n. b. fol. 194. and 195.
whence it is that they who hold of the King cannot make a gift of their Lands,
without his consent, Flet. l. 3. c. 3.
nor can the Parsons of Churches because they hold nothing but in right of the
Church. Wherefore they cannot make a Gift, alienation, or change, without the
consent of the Bishop and Patron, unless it be so that the condition of the
Church be bettered thereby: Yet these want not some who affirm them incapable
of doing that without the aforesaid consent. Bract. l. 2. c. 11. Flet. l. 3. c.
4


13. All are capable of receiving Donations, unless prohibited by any express
Law or custom, nor only single persons but eve^ many together, Bract. l. 2. c.
5. n. 6. etc. 11 Brit. d. c. 34.
now these are Femes Coverts incapable to receive the Gift of their Husbands or
otherwise, during coverture, Mag. Chapter c. 36, Fl. l. 3. c. 5.
Religious persons, 7 E. 1. c. 2. and 34 E. 1. c. 4. 18. E. 3. Sta. 3. c. 3.
all Ecclesiastics in the name and right of their Church, 15. R. 2. c. 5. F.
N. B. fo. 221. Q.
Bodies politic, 15. ^. 2. c. 5.
for those Immoveables which are without lawful permission given to bodies
politic, are forfeited sometimes to the King, and sometimes to the next chief
Lord Bract. l. 2. c. 5. n. 6.
so neither can Jews Brac. ib.
nor any who are not under the Allegiance of the Supremacy, Bract. l. 5. tr. 5,
c. 25. Flet. l. 6. c. 48. Dier fo. 224. n. 29.
but in regard the thing taken, is also received, the acquisition is not to
themselves, but to the King as we have said, nor finally can persons uncertain,
as the Heirs of one that is living. Perk. grants. 52. Plow. 345.
Or the firstborn of any one who at the time of the gift has not Children,
Perk. ib. n. 54. Dier fo. 274. n. 43.
but a possession to A. the remainder to his Heirs, though uncertain is good,
Coo. l. 1. Ar^bors Case, f. 66.
he also who is wholly unfit and unable to execute an office in any of the
Courts of Justice is incapable of receiving the said Office. Dyer, fol. 151. n.
1.


14. Now all things whatsoever may be given, save those things which can no way
be possessed, those are things sacred and Religious, or as it were, Sacred; and
those are a Freeman, and that which appertains to the Kings Treasury, which
make the very Crown, and belong to the Public profit. Brac. l. 2. c. 5. n.
8. 13, 14. Brit. d c. 34. Flet. l. 3. c. 6.
To which also some add the Walls and Gates of Cities: Flet. ib.
But at this day there scarce seems to be any liberty appertaining to the
Crown or P^erogative in the Supremacy, which may not by Charter be granted to
a Subject. Kitch. fol. 30. b.


15. I cannot give the Right which I have in a thing which is in the possession
of another to a third person: Yet I may ^emit it, or [as we say] release it to
the Possessor by my writing: Perk. ib. 85, 86.
Nor can any one give an action which he has to any thing, as we have said
before Sup. cod.
except the King, Dyer, fol. 30. n. 208.
or to the K. Bro. chose in Action, 4.
yet one may give it to the party obliged. Perk. ib. 85, 86.
A man cannot give the reversion of an Office Eo Nomine, nor can any but the
King give, under the name of the Office. Dier, fol. 259. n. 18.


16. Now that a Donation may be valid, there are other things required: It
ought to be free and not compulsatory, nor extorted by force or fear. Brac. l.
2. c. 5. n. 8. 13. Brit. d. c. 34.
There ought also to be certainty in a Gift, for that there can be no Donation
of a thing uncertain, unless it may be some means be reduced to Certainty.
Perk. ib. 81, 86. Plow. fol. 6, 7. 12, 13.
There ought also certain words to intervene to a congruous Gift, Brac. ib. n.
12.
as to a Bargain, Id. ib. Dier, fo. 71. n. 10, 11
and that there be a joint consent as well of the Donee as of the Donor, Brac.
ib. n. 12. Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 33.
And that there may be no Error in the thing given, Brac. l. 2. c. 5. n. 12.
Flet. l. 3. c. 7.
nor fraud, Id. ib.
not prejudice to a third person. 13. Eliz. c. 9.
Yet a false or pretended cause adjoined to a Gift, does not vitiate or injure
it. Flet. l. 3. c. 6.


17. And here also there arises a difference amongst Donations, for that some
may be by word, some not without Writing or Deed [as we commonly speak] Brac.
l. 2. c. 5. n. 3.
all Chattells for the most part, either real or personal may be given by
word, Per. grants, 7.
unless they be given by a Body politic, whose Seal i^ necessary in every
Alienation. Id. ^od. 64.
If any one in Knights service be Guardian of Body and Lands, he may grant the
Custody of the Lands or the profits by word only, which some affirm also as to
the body or person of the Heir, Id. ib. 60.
though it be denied by others for this reason; That the transferring of the
Body does not consist properly in the delivering possession. Id. ib.
No man can grant Lands which one has in possession, to another, either for
life or for ever, without a Writing, but for years he may. Id. eod. 61.
Corn which is but growing may be granted by a Nude parol^ and that by Tenant
in Tail, although he dye before the Do^ee has severed it from the land Id.
eod. 57.
which notwithstanding is otherwise in fruits of Trees growing upon the Land.
Id. eod. 59.
And the reason of the differenceit may be, is, because Corn cannot grow
without the industry of man, but trees by nature: but Tenant in Fee-simple may
give even such Trees by his word only, Id. eod. 58.
because he has a larger power then Tenant in Tail. And lastly, Lands and
Tenements may be given amongst those who are living by word only: Id. cod. 62.
But in case of Death, not without a Will in writing. Seetit. of wills, etc.


18. Incorporall Rights are hardly given without Deeds (as we call them) such
as yearly Rents, Dier, fol. 139. n. 57. Dr. Stu. l 2. c. 16. fol. 80.
Common of Pasture, an Advowson, villain in gross, or the reversion of Lands
after the death of the present Possessor: Perk. gr. 61 Plow. fol. 150.
Of which nature also are Tithes according to the opinion of some, Perk. ib.
62. Plow. 233.
but a Rectory with it is Tithes may: Bro lease, fol. 15. 20.
to which may be added the Right of Guard and Marriage. Dier, fol. 370. n. 57.


19. If a Gift be in all things complete, it ought to be confirmed by Livery,
or something parallel. Brac. l. 2. c. 5. n. 12. 17, 18. Inst. com. c. 21. Lit.
l. 1. c. 7. Flet. l. 3. c. 2. and 9. Dier, f. 49. and fol. 91.
Now how Livery and Seifin is to be, we have spoken elsewhere.

20. There are three kinds or species of Donations in case of Death: One which
is made merely upon the thoughts of Death, when there is no fear or danger of
Death ^igh. Another, when the party being moved with the imminent fear of
present Death, so gives, that the Gift immediately becomes the Donees. The
third, when one being pricked with the danger, gives out so, that the gift is
forthwith the Donees, but after his deceale. Brac. l. 2. c. 26. Flet. l. 2. c.
57.


What persons may alienate, and what not.
TIT. VIII.
THis Chapter is so near the other, that we must necessarily repeat many
things which we mentioned there. But the word ^^lienating being more general
then giving those things which we shall set down he^ have a more universal
use.

It happens sometimes that he that is O^ner of an Estate cannot alienate it.
The King cannot alienate the ancient Mann^^ annexed to the Crown, but every King
is ^^liged to revoke the alienations of the Cro^^* Nor will an Obligation to
warranty hinder* unless it were upon Exchange: Or otherwise for the value in
Fee, or service: O^ ^^least, unless they were granted for the C^^modity and
Honor of the King, as the B^ronies of Bishops, Flet. l. 1. c. 8. and 17.
etc. But this Right (...) now almost wholly worn out, either by the
munificency of our Kings, or by the (...) much negligency of our Commonwealth:
And therefore King James did worthily study a wholesome remedy for so pernicious
(...) mischeife.

1. Nor can a Husband so alienate the Inheritance or Jointure of his Wife, but
tha^ it may be recovered by her or her Heirs after his Decease. Glan. l. 6. c
3. Brit. c. 34. F. N. B. fol. 193. d.


2. Those who hold of the King in Capit^, either by Knights service or Socage,
cannot without punishment alienate their Lands without license* Id. fo. 175. A
Bro. ali^nat. and tenures, 69. 32 H. 8. c. 1.
Yet some are of opinion that such alienation is good for the Buyer or Feoffee
against the Seller or Feoffor, although the King cannot be prejudiced by it.
Bro. Testaments, 34.


3. An Infant, F. N. B. fo. 192. g. Perk. 3. Grants. 15. ^9.
Madman, F. N. B. fo. 292. C.
Monk, Perk. ib. 3.
or Feme-covert, Id. ib. c. 11. Bro. Exec. 175.
cannot alienate: Nor can a villain, those things which himself has purchased,
F. N. B. 202. l.
if his Lord be possessed of them: Or if they be not possessed, in case he be
the Kings villain. Littl. l. 2. c. 12.


4. There is also an old Law lately revived by an Act of K. James, which to the
subversion of the Church was almost lost through neglect, wherein Archbishops
and Bishops are prohibited to alienate the Fees of their Churches. 1 Jac. ses.
1. c. 3.


5. Lastly, those who otherwise may alienate, in some cases cannot, namely
Lands or Tenements to a Body politic, whether Ecclesiastical or Seculer, 7.
E. 1. 18. E. 3. c. 3. 15. R. 2. c. 5. F. N. B. fol. 221. Q.
without obtaining the Kings license for alienating it in Mortmaine. And on the
other side, Religious Colleges which were founded by the Kings of England, are
prohibited to alienate their Lands without the Kings License and permission.
Westminst. 2 c. 41.


6. And on the contrary it sometimes happens, that he who is not Owner may
alienate; for a Creditor by contract may alienate a pawn, or mortgage,
although the thing be not his: As if it be agreed in the beginning, that it
shall be lawful for the Creditor to sell the Pawn if the money be not paid.
So also may a Wife, Apprentice, or any other Servant which a Merchant appoints
to sell Commodities in his Office or Shop, F. N. B. fol. 120. H. Bro. tit.
Contract, 37. 40.
or any other person who has command from the Owner. New book of Entries,
trespass in Agist. 1. and Ejectm. firm. 10.


7. And sometimes it falls out, that he who has a full power to alienate a
thing, cannot do it but after a certain form or manner: for the King can
neither purchase nor alienate without that special method of Entering, which we
call Record. Plow. 553.


By what person we may make acquisition or gain to our selves.
TIT. IX.
NOw we are to know by what persons we may purchase or gain to our selves:
And know that we may legally by our selves, our Wives, our Servants, Male or
Female, by Sons or Daughters which are under our protection, by Freemen who
serve us, provided their Deed be necessary, and warrantable and approved. Brac.
l. 1. c. 9. n. 3. l. 2 c. 11. n. 12 etc. 18. n. 6. and l. 3. tr. 1. c. 2. n.
12. Brit c. 35. and 38. Lit. l. 2. c. 11. Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 8. and l. 2. c. 18.
And also by those Servants Flet. l. 3. c. 13. etc. 15. and l. 4. c. 11. etc.
12.
who are not under our power, as well as by those who are, provided they be not
under another, yet so, as we take no benefit by them before it be determined
whose they are: so also by a Common Servant, and that as well by another as
ones own, which we do bona fide possess, and by such a one of whom we have an
use.

1. And this may be done also by Procurators, Tutors, Keepers, or Guardians,
who either bargain in our name, or are in possession: Brac. l. 2. c. 18. n. 6.
Flet. l. 3. c. 4. etc. 15.
And the same is to be understood of those who are naturally deaf and dumb.
Id. ib.


2. The Sons and Daughters also of Villains, which are under the power of their
Lord without manumission. If they make a purchase without the bounds of the
villainage, have no Heir but their Lord. If so be that he take possession of
such Tenements, either in the life of his Villain after his Death. Brac. l. 4.
^r. 3. c. 13. n. 1.


Of ordaining last Wills and Testaments.
TIT. X.
THe third kind of Donations which are by reason of Death, are last Wills and
Testaments. Brac. l. 2. c. 26. Flet. l. 2. c. 57.
Now a Testament is the determination of our Will, concerning that which one
would have done after his decease. l. 1. de ^. Testament.
And it is double, Viz. Proper, or Improper. That which is properly so called,
is that last Decree of a man, in which he names his Executor. Brc. Test. 20.
And he is in the place of him whom the Romans called Haeres, and is as the
Basis of the Testament, Swin. par. fo. 1. Sect. 3. n, 19.
representing the state of the Testator: That which is improperly called a
Testament, is any other las^ will, whether a Codicel or Donation by occasion of
Death or Letter. Vali^ius, in com. sup. Instit. tit. de Testam. ord. in pri. n.
9, 10, 11.
And either of these may be twofold, Viz. either written or Nuncupative: Perk.
Testam. 476.
but Lands cannot be given by a Nuncupative will. 32. H. 8. c. 1. Coo. l. 3.
Bakers case, fo. 31. Dier, fol. 53. n. 13. and fol. 72. n. 2. and fol. 143. n.
54, 55.


1. That rigorous way of Solemnity which the Romans used in making of Wills is
long since abrogated by the Canon Law, which counts two Witnesses before the
Parish Priest sufficient to maintain or prove a Will. C. cum esses, 10. extra
testamentis.
Nor does the Custom of England oblige so much as the Decretall; for with us
it is sufficient to pronounce a will before two Freemen, whether Clergy or
Lay: Brac. l. 1. c. 16. n. 2. Glan. l. 7. c. 6. Dier, fo. 52. n. 13.
Yet our Sages do, for very good reason, persuade men not to be too secure or
negligent in the making of Wills. Coo. l: 3: case Butler and Bak: fol: 36:


2. Nay so irksome does that Curiosity of the Ancients seem unto us, that we
esteem every probation of a Will equal, which is consonant with that original
simplicity of Jus Gen^um. Swinb: part 4: sect: 25:
Nor are there two Witnesses necessarily required, if there be other
circumstances to supply. Brit: 28: fo: 7: 7: a:


3. In the admitting or rejecting Witnesses, we do not much differ from the
Civil Law. For as the Heir there, so the Executor with us cannot be a
Witness, yet a woman is not admitted. Swin. part 4 Sect. 21.
Nor is it so essentially necessary that Witnesses should be interrogated in
their giving testimony, unless they be such as are capable of being removed by
other exceptions. Id. part, 1. Sect. 10.


4. Although Wills take their force from the Will of the Testator chiefly:
Perk. 555. Plo. 412, 413.
Yet an Executor cannot have his Action against the Debtors of the Testator
before he has entered the Will, and procured an Authority for it from an
Ecelesiasticall Judge. Perk. 482, 484, 486, Br^. Execut. 49, 19, 139.
And although some will not grant this to be of ancient custom, Bro. Testam.
in fine.
yet the contrary is most evident. Glan. l, 7, c, 7 Brac. l, 2, c, 26. n, 2.
Plo. 280. Flet. l, 2, c, 57.


5. But when an Executor comes to a Judge to publish a Will, he shall upon Oath
assert, That he does believe that Testament which he exhibites to be the true
and last Will of the Party deceased, and that at a time limited by the Judge
[unlesse he be then prepared] he will make: and render a true and faithful
Inventory of all and singular the Goods which the Testator had at his Death:
And that he will pay Debts and Legacies, and render a just account of the
execution of his Executor-ship, whenever he shall by the Judge be required
thereunto: Lym. prove. de testat. c. stat. bone memor.
and this finished, he becomes the same person with the Testator. 9. E. 3. c. 3.
Nor does he only challenge all things which were the Testators, but renders
himself also liable to his Debts according to the value of the Estate
received. 13, E. 1. c. 35. Dier, fol. 187. n. 6.


6. If there be many Executors named, they may all if they please undertake the
Office; but if one only be willing, he may do it. Perk. 486.


7. But if any one dies, having made a Will, and yet not named any Executor,
o^ otherwise altogether intestate, the proper care belongs to the
Ecclesiastical Judge; for that he is liable to all the Debts of the party
deceased, as far as the value of the Goods will extend, 13. E. 1. St. 2. c.
17. 21. H. 8. c. 3. Brac. l. 2. c. 26. n. 2. Glan. l. 7. c. 6. Dyer, f. 232. n.
5. and 171. n. 26. F. N. ^. fol. 120. D.
and is obliged to commit the Administration of the Goods to the Widow, or next
of Kin, or at least to such a Party as will undertake it, and put in good
security both to Administer faithfully, and to preserve the Ordinary
harmless. 31. E. 3. c. 11.
And here also he is to make Oath [as far as he knows or beleives] that the
Party deceased dyed, exhibiting a Will, in which there is not any Executor
named, or whose Executor named refuses to undertake the Office: Or [if the
case require it] that he dyed wholly intestate: And further, that he will make
and exhibit a just and fatihfull Inventory: That he will according to the
value of the Goods he shall receive, pay the Debts of the party dead: And the
portions also if there shall be any overplus assigned by the Judge to the
Children of the Party deceased [if he have any left or to the residue of his
Kindred. And lastly, that he will render a just account of his Office when the
Judge shall require it: which being finished, he obliges himself with good
security to a due Administration of the Goods, and is at length made
Administrator, Dyer, fo. 294. n. 7. and fo. 339. n. 46.
when he receives letters of Administration under the Authentic Seal of the
Ordinary.

8. But here it is questioned what is to be done in case no one will be
Executor or Administrator? And in this case the Judge ought to sequester the
Goods of the deceased: and calling the Creditors together by his command, give
them satisfaction as the Law prescribes. Perk. 483. Bro. Testa. 20. and Execut.
90. and 117. Fle. l. 2. c. 62. Dyer, fol. 232. n. 5. and fol. 256. n. 8. and
fol. 160. n. 42. Plo. fol. 277.


9. But who is competent Judge in this case? truly the Bishop of the Diocese
where the Party dyed is Regularly. Yet there are others, as well Lay, as
Clergymen, who have the prescription of this privilege or liberty [as we call
it] or else a grant of it be by ancient Charter, Perk. 486. Dr. Stu. l. 2. c.
28. Swin. de test. part 6. Sec. 11.
I say regularly, because it is true, in case the Party deceased have not an
Estate, or Goods in sundry Diocesles; Swin. ib.
for if so, then the probation and publication belongs to the Archbishop of
Canterbury or York [if it be in the Province of Yorke] by Prerogative. Lym.
provin. Statut. de testa. Perk. 489.


10. When we affirm the Bishop of the Diocese competent Judge, we intend the
same also of his Officialls, whether he be Vicar general, or Commissary, Bro.
Testam. 12.
or Archdeacon, who by prescription or composition claims this power. Id. ib.
25. Perk. 492, 493


Of the Military Testament.
TIT. XI.
OUr Law does not permit any privilege to that Testamentum Militare, which no
Pagan Law denies to last Wills: Swin. part 1. Sect. 19, and part 4, Sect. 17,
18.
For that all those Roman subtilties are dissolved into the ancient Law of
Nations.

Who they are that may make a Will.
TIT. XII.
SOme there are who by our Law are absolutely prohibited to make a Will, and
some who are prohibited as to certain things only.

1. An Infant is absolutely forbidden, but in this case Infant is taken doubly,
viz. A male under fourteen, and a female under twelve years of age. Otherwise
under twenty one for both sexes; those of the former rank cannot make a will at
all, Swin. part 2. Sect. 2. Perk. 503.
these of the later may of Chattells but not of Lands in Fee, 34. H. 8. c. 5.
Dr. and Stu. l. 1. c. 12.
unless any particular custom of a particular place permits it. Perk. 504.


2. An Idiot, 34. H. 8. c. 5.
viz. Such a one who cannot give a reasonable answer to any ordinary and easy
question, Swin. patt. 2. Sect. 4.
also a Servant for the same reason by which he is forbid to give, whilst
living, Sup. title Donation S. 5.
can dispose of nothing by his last will, whose possession is seized on by his
Lord, Perk. 29. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 43.
or claimed by word only, Bre. Villein 50
unless in case that he be Executor to another, in which case, he may
constitute another his Eextutor, even against the will of his Lord, for that
the goods which are contingent to this Office, are not his to his own use but
to another, Id. ib. 68. 73.
so also a Captive, because himself possesses nothing, but is in the
possession of another, Brac. l. 2. c. 16. n. 5.
which is true likewise in those whom we called Outlawed. Id. l. 3. tr. c. 13.
Dr. and Stu. l. 1. c. 6. and l, 2. c. 9.


3. Moreover, he that is guilty of Treason, has not a power to make a will:
Because if he be afterward convict of that Crime, he forfeits what ever he
possessed at the time of the Treason committed, to the King and the Exchequer,
5. E. 6. c, 11. Swn. par. 2. Sect. 12. 1. R. 3. c. 3.
nor he that is guilty of Felony: but here we must distinguish, for if such a
one dye before conviction, he may by his Will bequeath both his Lands and
Chattells, or if he be obstinate before the Tribunal, and refuse to put
himself upon the Trial of God and his Country, according to the Custom of the
Commonwealth, or shall stand mute, for in this case if he die intestate he
reservs his Lands entire to his next Heir or if testate he may dispose of them
to whom he please, and forfeits his Chattells only: Moreover, if he be Convict
he loses his Lands from the time of the fact committed; but his Chattells
only from the time of his Conviction, so that before Conviction he may give
them or alienate them at pleasure, Swin. par. 2. S. 17. Bro. Forfeitures 5. 28.
65. 89. 103. 113. 117.


4: He that murders himself, is by us termed Felo de se, and has no other
Successor, as to his Chattells, but the Exchequer, Bract. l. 3. tr. 2. c. 31.
yet it is much doubted at this day whether he forfeits his Lands or not, Stan.
pl. cor. l. 1. c. 3.
but that his Chattells come into the Exchequer is out of question. See tit.
Mur.


5. An Heretic by our ancient Law could not make a will, 2. H. 5. c. 7.
but that Law is now abrogated, 1. E. 6. c. 12.
so that here we have nothing certain but what we receive from the Canon Law.

6 A notorious Usurer, if he exact above ten pound Per cent. per an. is liable
to all the punishments which the Canon Law inflicts, 13. Eliz. c. 8.
and therefore seems incapable of making a Will. Swin. par. 2. S. 16.


7 Feme Covert is absolutely prohibited to dispose of Lands of Inheritance by
her last will, 34. H. 8. c. 5.
or of Goods or Chattells, without the license of her Husband, Swin. par. 2. S.
9. Bract. l. 2. c. 26. n* 1. Cov. Ognels case. 51
unless she were an Executrix of a former Husband or of any other person
before she entermarried with this Husband, or has any title to any sum of
Money as yet unpaid, for in these cases she may dispose of the Goods by will,
which he has by reason of that Office, or by right of Action: and constitute
either her Husband or any one else, her Executor, Bro. Testa. 9. 11. 13. and.
Execut. 132. 175. 178. Glan. l. 7. c. 5. Perk. 502.
but if we believe Bracton, it was an opinion that a Wife might make a will,
and dispose of her reasonable part, which she should have had, if she had
survived her Husband, and especially of such things as were permitted or given
her for Ornament, which they called her own, as Robes and Jewels, l. 2. c. 26.
n. 1. F. N. B. fo. 122. Flet. l. 2* c. 57.
but this Law was either customary in some particular place, or else it is long
since vanished:

8 Lastly, they which enter into Religion cannot make a will, for to those
Goods which they dispose not of before entrance, their next of Kin succeeds, as
if they had died intestate, Bro. Testam. 9.
but it is otherwise of Ecclesiastic Seculers, whose Goods are by the cust^^e
of England, reputed lay; whether they be acquired from the Church or otherwise,
Dr. and. Stu. l. 1. c. 39.
so also is Corn growing upon glebe Land and not yet gathered. 28. H. 8. c. 11.


9. The King however in a capacity to make a will, cannot by his Testament
dispose of his Kingdom or the Goods of his Kingdom, viz. his Crown or Regalia
to another. Fitz. Abridg. devise 5. and Execut. 108. Swin. p. 2. Sect. 28.


10. A Bishop or Abbot, in regard their Baronies were of the Alms and Charity
of the King and his Predecessors, cannot alienate any part of their Demesnes,
as to the Remainder, without the Assent and confirmation of the King. Glan. l.
7. c. 1.


11. So also a Bishop, Dean, or Master of any Society is prohibited to make a
will of any of those Goods which they held in common with the Chapter and
Society, Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 39. Bract. l. 2. c. 14. Perk. 469. 497. 499.


Of the Dis-inheriting of Children.
TIT. XIII.
OUr Law remits that positive dis-inheriting of Children, to which the Roman
Laws obliged their Citizens, to the affection of Parents, which it presumes,
nature to have engraven so firmly in the minds of all, that it is not possible
to be rooted out but by the extreme debeauchery of Children. Wherefore every
one has a free power of disposing of his goods, whether movables or
immoveables: And those whether purchased or descending from Ancestors certain,
unless it be of Fee-Taile; for that cannot be disposed of but where the
Entaile is cut off by fine and recovery. 4. H. 7. c. 24. 32. H. 8. c. ^. Plow.
356, etc. and Coo. l, 3. case of Fines.


1. Yet the ancient VVriters of our Law do scarce hold it lawful for a man to
bequeath by his Will an Inheritance received from his Ancestors to any one but
the next Heir, under which notion they will lay the burden of the Fathers
debts upon the Heir. Glan. l. 6. c. 17. and 18. and l. 7. c. 1. Brac. l. 2. c.
36. n. 1. and ^rit. c. 34.
But our later times have provided a sufficient remedy for this: 3^. H. ^. c. 1.
And therefore the Heir is not at this day liable to the debts of his Ancestor,
unless he be specially mentioned in the Instrument of Contract, and have an
Estate sufficient discending.

2. Bracton L. 2. c. 26. n. 1. Glan. l. 7. c. 8. Plow. fol. 418.
makes this distribution of Chattells, Viz. That Debts being paid, the overplus
should be divided into three parts, whereof one to be left to the Children, the
other to to the Wife, and the third at the will and pleasure of the Testator.
And if there be no Children, then one half to the liberty of the Testator, and
the other to the Wife: And if there be no Wife, then one moity to the Children,
and the other as the Testator shall please.

But this rather seems to be Counsel then Law; for a little after in the same
place he says, That neither the Wife nor Children ought to take more of the
Goods of the Father or Husband deceased, then what is particularly b^qu^athed
unto them, except it be upon some special grace, as having merited
extraordinarily of him in his life time. And he gives this reason, namely,
because there would scarce be found any one who would endeavor to lay up much,
if he should be compelled at his death to leave it to illiterate or debauched
children, or to an ill wife. And therefore it is very necessary, that in this
they should have a free power; for by this they prevent vice, and encourage
virtue, and give occasion both to Wife and Children of well doing: which could
not be, if they knew undoubtedly, that they should have a certain portion
whether the Testator will or not.

Of the instituting of Heirs.
TIT. XIV.
THe Civillians and we have a different acceptance of the word Heir; for
they call him an Heir whom the Testator nominates in his Will: Inst. de
Testam. ordinand.
And we him, who is next of Kin to the party deceased, to whom a Fee does of
right belong, after the death of the Ancestor. Glan. l. 7 c. 1. Brac. l. 2. c.
33. ^. 3. Brit. c. 118, 119.
So that we affirm it is not man, but God, who makes Heirs: Glan. and Brit. ib.
And that Here Is comes from Hereditate, where succession is by right of Blood.
Brit. ib.
Nor do we call all the Estate of the party deceased, his Inheritance, but only
his Fee, or at lest those Lands and tenements, with all things corporal and
incorporall, which the Party deceased, held by a perpetual Right. Iidem ib.
Wherefore it was necessity which in some sort constituted an Heir: who, as he
was wont to succeed his Ancestor in the premises, even against his will, so was
he obliged to pay his Debts, if he had Assets sufficient, and the Chattels did
not suffice, Glan. l. 7. c. 7. Brac. l. 2. c. 26. n. 1.
as we have in part declared before.

1. Wherefore an Heir with us does not succeed to the universal Right of the
Party deceased, but to the Fee assigned only; for as to the disposing of
Chattels, men nominate their Executors according to their pleasure Glan. l. 7.
^. 6 Brac. ib. Dr. Stu: l: 2: c: 10:
who as to that part of the Patrimony, supply the place of an Heir, and
represent the person of the Testator, if at least they accept the Office, Bro:
Executors, 5: 21, 22: 57: 77: 84: 122:
so that they may convert all those goods which are not bequeathed to their own
use, Plow: 943:
and take even the clothes of the widow, if they are more rich and sumptuous
then the condition of the Husband would bear. Bro. ib: 19:


An Executor may also be ordained either absosolutely or upon Condition, Id.
ib: 9: and administrat: 1: and 45:
and either from a certain time, or after a certain time, Bro: Exec: 155:
and either universally, or particularly, Id: ib: 2, and 155: L: Dier fo: 3, 4,
n: 7, 8:
and in the first degree, or by Substitution, Id: ibid:
and either one or more. Id: ibid: 13: 24 38: 117:


3. And those may be Executors, whom the Testator shall constitute, whether
they be strangers or Parents, of Kin, or not of Kin, Brac: l: 2: c: 26: n:
2:
and not only those who are free, but Servants also, and those whether our own
or of others; Lit: l: 2: c: 11: Bro: villains 68
nor only Laymen, but even of the Clergy also, and Religious, Bro: ib: 68: 77
if they have the permission of their Superiors, Fitz. abrid: Execut, 47:
so also may women, Bro. Execut: throughout
and Infants, Id: ib: 15:
and in fine, all who are not expressly forbidden by the Law. Glan: l: 7, c,
6, 4,


4. Not that any one is against his will forced upon this office, but that he
that will may refuse, and he who has once refused, may notwithstanding
afterward undertake it, Bro: ib: 38. 117 Perk: 4: 85.
though according to the opinion of some, he cannot during the life of his
Co-Executor, Dier, fo. 160: n: 42.
but being once undertaken it cannot be laid down again, and the undertaking of
it seems to be, when he does under that name intermeddle with any of the Goods
of the Testator. Id. f. 166. n. 10. 11.


If an Executor die before the Will proved, then Administration of the Goods
shall be granted by the ordinary to the widow, or next Kinsman of the Testator,
who shall be obliged to dispose of the goods of the Testator, according to the
Will, unless the Remainder of the Goods after the payment of Debts and
Legacies were bequeathed unto him; for in this Case, the Executors of that
Executor may justly challenge Administration which the Will annexed. Id. fo.
172 n. 8.


Of the ordinary Substitution.
TIT. XV.
Substitution is of no small use with us, though we do for the most part in
this, follow the Precepts and Rules of the Civil Law, yet we cannot so freely
dispose of those fees which we hold by Knights Service by our Testaments, but
that we are obliged to leave a third part to the heir 32. H. 8. c. 1. Glan. l.
7. c. 7
but for those which we hold in Soccage not intailed, Brac. l. 2: c. 30.
or tied by any particular Custom, Glan. ib.
we may bequeath them to whom we will, whether to a Kinsman or stranger, 32 H.
8. c. 1.
provided we hold no other Lands in Capite by Knights Service: and in each of
these Cases we may make Substitution, either vulgariter (as they term it) or
Pupillariter. Now this Substitution is nothing else, then the adding of a
Condition, which we commonly call Tail; namely a limitation of Heirs, to whom
we intend to have the Lands descend from the Testator, or remain, or otherwise
revert to us, and our Heirs.

1. Yet is not this Substitution the same with that of the Romans, because
that had this Condition annexed, viz. I ordain A. mine Heir, and if he will not
be Heir, then my will is, that B. shall be my Heir. Inflit. eod.
now this of ours i^ not bound, but is rather tacitly imposed contrary to the
Legator, as namely thus, I give and bequeath such a Fee to A. and if he accept
it* then I will that such or such shall be his Heir or Successor. Westminst. 2
c. 1. Dr. Stu. l. 7. c. 24.


2. In like manner if we bequeath any thing conditionally to any one, we make
Substitution to another, in Case the condition be not performed; for Example, I
give a hundred pounds to A. when he shall marry a Wife, or if he shall not get
a son of my Daughter lawfully, then I give the said hundred pounds to B.

Of Pupillary Substitution.
TIT. XVI.
IN this Substitution we do not so much regard the power of our Country, as
the liberty of the Testator, so that a Legate o^ may make a Substitution
Pupillary, either to his own chidren or to strangers, Legatees who are under
age: As I give to A. (my own child or another) a hundred pounds when he shall
come to age: and if he shall die before then, I bequeath the same one hundred
pounds to B. But in regard that Cases of Wills, are for the most part tried in
the Ecclesiastical Courts, and by the Rules of the Civil and Pontificiall
Law: Bra. l. 2. c. 26 n 2.
therefore our Law, has as it were, past by for the most part, this and other
things of the same nature, and leaves them to be determined by the Civil and
Pontificiall Law.

How Wills are invalidated.
TIT. XVII.
WIlls cannot be justly made ab initio, by those who are not permitted to make
Wills; those who are, we have mentioned before, they may also be nulled by a
later Will, Perk. 476. 479. 480. Fulb. paral Devises fo. 47.
or invalidated by Treason, etc. as where one is condemned for Treason or
Felony after his Will made; Stan. pl. corp. l. 3 c. 20. and c. 32.
or if the Testator revoke his Will, or be deprived of the Executor whom he
named. Bro. Exec. throughout.


1. Suppose A. make two Wills, one in the sixth, the other in the eighth year
of Eliz. at length he is sick and speechless: B. his familiar friend comes
unto him, gives him into his hands both the Wills, and desires him to return
that which he would have stand for his Will: A. returns that which was made the
sixth year, in this Case, that will which he returned shall be esteemed the
later. Perk. 479


2. And it happens sometimes, that a man's will, which according to the Civil
Law is ambulatory, or alterable, until Death, cannot be altered, in regard of
prejudicing another Contract, upon which account the will was made; for
Example, A. is seized of Lands in Fee, which he alienates to B. upon condition
that they shall be his for life, to the use of the said A. the Remainder (e) in
ip. Co. I am arcisc. and l. omnium. 19 C. de Testa. f Dier. fo. 49. n. 12.
to C. and his Heirs for ever, and upon this, A. makes his last will, after
having given the possession to B. This will (quatenus to the alienation) cannot
be nulled by a later, and the Reason is, because the use of the said Lands do
immediately belong to C. to whom the Remainder is transferred; so that he may
immediately sell them if he please, Id: fo. 325. n. 73. Perr. 480.


Of those Wills which were called by the Civilians Testamenta inofficiosa.
TIT. XVIII.
THe Plaint or Action in the Case of Testamentum inofficiosum is not in use
with us, for as concerning Lands holden by Knights Service, in case the Father
do not leave his lawful Heir, either while he lives or at his death, a third
part, according to the Statute, the will is void, as to that part, 32 H. 8. c. 1
so that the Heir may notwithstanding take possession thereof, or else if he
have gotten it, he may immediately himself refuse Brac. l. 2. c 30 n: 2:
the parcel bequeathed, or quit it, or remove it by Law. Id: ib:


1. For the disposing of Chattells, there are several Customs in several
places, of which there remain very clear signs, in the ancient writers of our
Law, Glan: l: 7: c: 5: and 7: Brac: l: 2: c: 26: n: 2:
but by the Common Law the Testator had always a Free will of disposing, Id:
ib:
wherefore that writ which is called Breve derationabili partebonorum, which
li^s for the wife or children against the Executors, for the recovery of part
of the Goods, Regist: fo: 142: b: F: n: 122: ^:
is not general, but peculiar to certain Countries, where the Custom is, that
Debts being paid, the Remainder should be divided into parts, viz. one part to
the wife, the other to the Children, and the third to be left at the will of
the Testator.

Of the Quality and difference of Heirs.
TIT. XIX.
HEirs as they are taken with us, were necessary in time past, as to the
driving an Inheritance from our ancient Predecessors to the next Ancestor,
Glan. l: 7: c: 1
(as they are now with us, as to part) 32 H: 8: c: 1:
and that not only as to a Succession in the Estate, but also as to the
drawing upon themselves the Debt of their Ancestor, Brac: l: 2: c: 16 n: 7:
and they were also for ever bound and obliged to warranties, that is, to the
assurances, which either they or their ancestors engaged and promised to those
to whom they sold any Land.

1. But for that it is evident, that children natural and legitimate are
preferred before others to Succession: it were not amiss to see the Estate and
difference of Children, which really is very much, for of Children, some are
natural and legitimate, and of this sort, some are Sons and Heirs, some Sons,
but not Heirs, some also are Heirs of the Father, some of the Mother, some both
of Father and Mother, some also are not Heirs although legitimate, and
natural, some by accident begin to be Heirs, and some cease to be so, so also
of natural and legitimate Issue, some are near, some more near, some are
removed, some more removed, Brac. l. 2. c. 29, 30. Brit. c. 118. Coo. l. 3.
Ratc. Case, fo: 40, 41, 42. Plow: 28. Flet. l. 6. c. 1.
but of this elsewhere.

Of Devises.
TIT. XX.
THat kind of Donation, which is in Case of Death, is, where the Testator had
rather that himself should enjoy the thing bequeathed, then that the party to
whom it is bequeathed should have it: and yet, that he had rather that the
party to whom it is bequeathed shall have it, then his own Heir. Brac. l. 2.
c. 21. n. 1.


1. Our Common Law, although for the most part it leaves the Cases of wills to
be tried by the Ecclefiasticall Courts according to the Rules of the Civil and
Common Law; yet are there certan particular Cases of Lands and Chattells
really, and which she has reserved to her self and those with as much brevity
as we can, we shall sum up.

2. And in the first place, all may give Legacies, who are capable of making
wills, and who they are we have formerly mentioned: but no man can rightly
bequeath Lands or Tenements who has not the possession of them at the time of
the making of the will, Fulb. Par. e. Devises fo. 37. a. 32. 34. H. 8.
which is to be understood if no other person be not also in possession in his
right or name, for one may bequeath a Reversion.

3. All men also are capable of Legacies who are not especially excepted by the
Law, which are religious persons, and persons not yet in being, although they
afterward shall be: As if one makes a bequest to such a College or Chantry;
of which name though there be not any at the time of the Testators death, yet
there happens to be one afterward Perk. 505 Fulb. ib. fo. 35. b.
but a Post humus, in favor of Testaments. Although he be in the Womb is
notwitstanding supposed to have being Terms v. devise


4 A Husband although he cannot make a Gift to his wife in his life time,
because they are both adjudged one and the same person during Matrimony, yet he
may give and bequeath Lands unto her by will in regard that Legacies take no
Effect before the death of the Testator by which this conjunction is dissolved.
Fulb. ib. 36. a.


5. One may also give a Legacy to an uncertain person which may afterward be
rendered certain, as an annuity is given to A. for life, and after his death to
him who shall first in the Morning enter Saint Paul's Church, and to his Heirs.

Corporation permitted Lit. l. 2. c. 18. F. N. B. 198. I.
unless the Heir consented to such bequests. Whosoever therefore would by his
will give Lands to another, did first infeoff one in them to the use of
himself, and his Heirs, Perk. 528.
and by this means he might bequeath the use of the said Lands, although he
could not the Lands themselves unto a third person, Id. ib. 97.
but later times have remedied this inconveniency, or rather, poor and weak
comment, and has deereed, that not only uses but even the Lands themselves
with some moderation may be bequeathed 32. H. 8. c. 1. Bro. testam. 19. Swinb.
part. 3. S. 4. Coo. l. 7. Case. Butler. fo. 30.
for of a Knights Fee we are yet obliged to leave the Heir a third part and we
are prohibited the bequeathing of Lands by a will nuncupative, in regard of the
deceit and fraud they are subject unto. Dier. 155. n. 21.


8. If a man and his Wife jointly purchase Lands to them and the Heirs of the
man, and the Husband bequeath them after the death of him and his wife to a
stranger, this is good: For in this case the Husband has the Fee-simple. Perk.
539.


9. If there be two Joynt-Tenants in Feesimple, where by the custom of the
place Lands and Tenements may be given by will and one of them bequeaths his
right to a third person, this is void. For since a Will is not in force until
the death of the Testator, the right of a Joynt-Tenant at the very instant of
his death is transferred by law unto his fellow, Inst. Jur. Com. c. 15
which notwithstanding is otherwise in Partners, because Partners have their
Lands by blood and Inheritance, and not by the Courtesy or pleasure of a Donor,
Joynt-Tenant have theirs. Ib.


10. A man may also appoint by his will that his Executors may sell those Lands
which he has in Fee, and which he may bequeath, and that the profits arising
from such Sail may be employed for pious uses, or for the good of his Soul:
Perk. 422. 541. 543. 21. H. 8. c. 4.

years, the Heir may enter upon them, and eject them. Fulb. par. c. Devises fo.

11. A. being Tenant in Socage gives the Lands which he has in Fee-simple to
his wife for term of life, the Remainder to B. his Brothers Son, and the
Heirs males of his Body; and if it shall happen the said B. to die without
Heirs of his Body begotten (not expressly nor implicitly naming males) there
the said Remainder to C. another Kinsman, and his Heirs males in Fee-simple,
and for defect of Heirs males of the said C. then to the next Heirs males of
the said lineage lawfully begotten. B. dies leaving only Issue, D. a Daughter,
the question is whether D. shall have the Lands by force of those words [and if
it shall happen, etc.] or some other Heir male more remote: But it was adjudged
that those words did not create a general Tail to the Heirs of B. or hinder the
Lands from remaining to the Heirs males, according as devised. Dier. 171. n. 7.


12. Chattells of any sort may be bequeathed by will, Perk. 511.
wherefore the profits arising either from the custody of a Body, or Lands of a
Ward, a Lease for years, Horses, Oxen, Sheep, Gold, Silver, either in Plate, or
Money, Rings, all manner of Vessels, without exception are diviseable: Id. 525.
unless the Testator had but a Joint possession of them at the time of his
death Dr. and. Stu. l 1. c. 6. Lit. l. 3. c. 3.
and unless they be affixed to the Fee or Freehold, and cannot, being reputed
parcel of it, be removed without wast. Bro. Execut. 65.


13. Moneys also due upon Bond or Condition may be devised, for that after they
are paid to the Executors, they are due to the Legatee. Perk. 527.


14. Chattells which a man has in right of his Wife, as Leases for years, etc.
are deviseable. Id. 560.


15. A thing uncertain may be also devised, so long as it may be reduced to
certainty by the Legatee. Fulb. par. 38. b.


16. There has been a great difference in opinions amongst our learned
Lawyers, and that according to the diversity of Species in the cases of Corn,
etc. sown by those who had Land in possession, and not severed from the Soil.
For example, Tenant in Dower sowes Corn, and dies before Harvest: She may
devise the Corn, though not yet ripe, Perk. 521. Stat. Merton. c. 2. Flet. l.
2. c. 37.
which is true also as to those Lands which she holds Jointly or severally
under the notion of Dower. Perk. 513. Fulb. 17. ^ural. Devises 38.


17. But if contrary to custom she be endowed by the Guardian of the Heir, and
dying, leaves Corn growing, her Executors may be ejected by the Heir when he
comes to age, and hindered from gathering the profits. Perk. 524.
So if the Heir coming of age recover Lands against his Mother, or Widow of
his Ancestor in a writ of Admeasurement of Dower; he shall recover not only the
Lands but the Corn also, which is by him deviseable. Id. ib.


18. Tenant by the Courtesey leaseth forth his Lands, and dies. The Lessee
shall reap his Corn, and may, if he dye before it be ripe, devise it, Id. 514.
which may also be done by a Parson of a Church as to his glebe Lands. 28. H.
8. c. 11.


19. So also he who has Lands in right of his Wife, his Wife dying after the
Corn sown, may reap the benefit, ar devise it, Perk. 518. Lit. l. 1. c. 8.
which his Lessee also [in case he have leased out the said Lands] may do.
Perk. 513. Fulb. par. fol. 37. b.


20. Execution is taken upon a Manor of the Debtors by virtue of a Statute
Merchant. The Creditor sowes the Land, and before Harvest, a Tenant of the said
Manor dies, the Custody of whose Heir [being under age] satisfies the Debt:
This will not hinder, but that the Creditor may also devise the Corn not yet
ripe, or gathered. Ib. 516.


21. Money is paid at the day upon a mortgage, yet it seems the Creditor
[although some are of a contrary opinion] may devise the Corn which he sowed,
and which as yet remains ungathered. Id. ib.


22. Tenant in Tail leaseth out his lands for life: The Lessee sowes Corn, the
Heir recovers upon a Formedon in the Descender, and dies before the Corn is
gathered. This Corn according to the opinion of some (though others contradict
it) he may devise by Will. Perk. 520. Fulb. fol. 37. b.


23. Tenant in Fee-simple dies, and leaves an only Daughter, and a Wife with
Child: The Daughter enters, and sowes the Land; but before Harvest the Wife is
delivered of a Son, to whose use the next Kinsman possesses himself of the
Estate: in this case the Daughter may devise the Corn. Perk. 521. Fulb. fol.
38. a
But we will put the case thus: The Mother before the Son is born recovers
Dower against the Daughter, and has that part assigned by the Sherifte which
the Daughter sowed. In this case she may devise the Corn, yet it is a Quaere.
Perk. ib.


24. Tenant for term of years commit waste, upon which the Lessor recovers
the Land. In this case the Lessee cannot devise the Corn: Id. 515.
Neither can he, if another upon a more ancient Title recovers the said Land
against the Lessor. Id. ib.


25. Lessee of a House for forty years devises the said House to A. without
mentioning the Title which he has, or gives. The Question is, what he
devises? And it is adjudged that the Testator devises that title which
himself has, Viz. The term of forty years. Dyer, fol. 307. n. 69.


26. Lessee for years be que at heth his Interest to A. the remainder of the
years to B. in case A. dye before the term expired. A. is in possession by
virtue of the Devise, and not long after Aliens his Right, and dies before the
term expired. The Question is, what remedy B has to recover his Right as to
the remainder of the years unexpired? And it was adjudged that he is without
Remedy: Id. fol. 75. n. 18. and f. 140. n. 41.
But if the Testator had devised so many years of the Lease to A as A should
live, and had ordered B. to succeed in the residue. In this case A. could not
have so alienated the Term, but that B. should have succeeded in the Remainder
unexpired. Dyer, fol. 358. n. 50, 51. and fo. 359. n. 52.


27. Disseisee recovers against the Disseisor: The Disseisee may devise the
Corn sown; but if it shall be severed from the ground, the Disseisor may take
it away, or devise it, Perk. 519.
yet he shall pay the Disseisee Damages. 6. Ed. 1. c. 1.


28. A Testator can neither devise Actions (if they be not Judgments) nor
instruments of Actions: Brac. l. 2. c. 26. a. 28. n. 2. and l. 5. tr. 5. c. 10.
n. 3. Fulb. fol. 30, 31.
but he may that which is due upon Action: Yet is this devise conditional,
namely, if the Debt be paid or recovered by the Executors. Perk. 527.


29. Our Law respects principally (as does the Civil Law and Reason likewise)
the will of the Testator Cook. l. 3. Bullers case, fo. 27. Fulb. fol. 46. Plow.
343.
(if not contrary to Law) If therefore a man having both a Son and Daughter
living, devises his Lands to his Daughter: Although the Son be more worthy,
yet the Daughter shall have the Lands. New terms v. devise.
If he adds and annexeth a Condition to the devise, which is neither impossible
in Nature or Law, this shall suspend the devise until it be performed: Brit.
c. 36. Perk. 570. Brac l. 2. c. 6. n. 1, 2, 3. Swinb. part 4. Sect. 13.
And this is so far true, that sometimes words are extended beyond their
natural intent; See the rest of his tit.
and sometimes for causes restrained, Fulb. 41. Pl^w. 540.
by reason of the conjectured will and meaning of the Testator.

30. A. devises Lands to B. conditionally, that he pay so much money: Although
by force of words B. has an Estate for life only, yet the Law adjudgeth him to
have a Fee-simple, Brac. Test. 18. Perk. 555.
for otherwise if B. should dye in a short time, He might receive more
prejudice then profit by the Devise.

31. A. devises all his Lands and Tenements to B. B. shall not only have all
the Lands and Tenements which A. had in possession, but the Reversion likewise.
Terms, v. Devises.


32. If Lands be bequeathed to One, to have any to hold to him for ever: Or to
have and to hold for him and his Assigns for ever: In both Cases the Devisee
has an Estate in Fee-simple, although there be no mention of Heirs, Id. ib.
which notwithstanding some affirm jointly. Perk. 557.


33. If a man bequeath Lands to another in these words, I give my Lands to A.
to give them, or sell, or dispose of them at his discretion: This is a
Fee-simple. Terms, ib.


34. A Testator bequeatheth Lands to A. and the Heirs Males of his Body: A.
has Issue only, a Daughter, and of her a Grandson. In this case the Grandson
shall succeed in the Lands by force of the Devise, rather then the Devise shall
remain ineffectuall; notwithstanding that in other Donations it is otherwise.
Id. ib.


35. If I devile Lands to my Son after the death of my Wife, although I do not
expressly give it to my Wife, yet our Law ^elpes her by a favorable
Construction. Id. ib. Pl. 414. Bro. Exec. 175. 13. H. 7. fol. 17.


36. I devise a Fee-simple to A. for a 100. years, upon this condition, if
that he shall pay ten pound yearly to B. the remainder of the said Lands to C.
and his Heirs. In this case, although A. shall break his Condition, yet the
Remainder as to C. is not hurt, although the Law be contrary in Contracts made
amongst those who are living. Perk. 504. 565, 566, 567, 568, 569.


37. A man devises all his Lands to A. upon condition that he give a 100.
pound: And in case the Condition be infringed, then to his own Family. In this
case our Law determines this Devise to belong to him who is next of Kin to
the Testator by blood. Fulb. 46.


38. A man devises to another all the Grain which he has in such a Barn: And
after the Will is made, he puts more Grain into the said Barn. In this case
the generality of the words is restrained to that which was there at the time
when he made his VVil, for that the Law presumes the Testator to have meant
only of that. Id. fol. 41. Plow. 341.


39. A. after many Legacies in his Will devises the Remainder and residue of
all his Goods to his Wife E. in these words: The residue of all my goods I
bequeath unto my dear wife E. [whom also I do ordain full and sole Executrix
of this my last will and Testament] to be disposed of by her for the good of my
soul, and the payment of my debts. E. takes upon her the Office of Execution,
and pays all Debts and Legacies. Afterward she entermarryeth with B. who
getting possession of the said Goods (having made his Will, and ordained his
Executors) dies before E. Here the question is, whether the Goods which E.
brought to her second Husband, shall revert to her? Or whether they belong to
the Executors of B. And it was determined, that they should revert to E.
because the residue of the Goods were destined to certain uses, and not left to
her disposing. Dyer, fol. 331. n. 21.


40. A. being possessed to the value of 100. pound, and indebted 20. pound,
divides his Estate by his Will: One moity to B. his Wife, the other moity to
his Executors. The question was, whether B. shall have 50 pound, or 40 pound,
and it was resolved that the might claim 50. pound: But if the Executors had
aliened any of the Goods in Specie, that then she could not challenge any of
those which were alienated, because they were alienated. Dyer, fol. 164. n. 57.


41. Devises and Legacies are to be sued for in the Ecclesiastical Court:
Glan. l. 7. c. 7.
Yet some restrain this assertion only to Chattels real and personal; Perk.

cite one before him in case of such a Devise as intrencheth upon the Common
Law. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 55.


Of the taking away, or translating Devises.
TIT. XXI.
WHereas the Civil Law does, ipso facto, null the Will for default of an Heir.
L. 10. ^. de jure codillorum.
Ours does not presently suffer Devises to become void for want of an Executor,
or for default of an Executors undertaking the Office, but appoints
Administration of the Goods to be committed to another, according to the
Judgment of the Ordinary, who obliges the Administrator to the payment of
Legacies, at least as far as the Estate will reach. Bro. Executors.


1. Lands, Tenements, and other Hereditaments whatsoever, devised by a
Testator: If they shall happen afterward to be alienated by him, and are again
redeemed: They are equally due to the Legaree, as if they had never been
alienated. Id. Devise, 8.


Of that Law which the Romans called Lex Falcidia.
TIT. XXII.
THe first duty of an Executor taking upon him the Office, is to satisfy the
Debts of the Testator: and therefore it will not be amiss to consider what
Antiquity has adjudged in these cases. If there be Debts owing to many [saith
Bracton] L. 2. c. 26. Glan. l. 7. c. 5. Flet. l. 2. c. 57.
one may be preferred before another. The King is first, and it shall be
lawful for the Sheriff, or any of the Kings Bailiffs [shewing the Kings
Letters Patents, De summonitionibus scaccarij] to take an Inventory of such
Goods and Chattels, as they shall find in the Lay-fee of the party deceased,
and to attach them to the value of the Debt which is coming unto the K. per
visum legalium hominum [as we call it] so that nothing be removed or taken
thence until such a Debt as shall appear due be paid, and the residue of the
Chattells to be left to the Executors. To the acquitting of which Debts or any
other, the Wife of the party deceased is not to contribute any thing out of her
Jointure, for that the Wives Jointure ought to be free, F. N. B. fo. 151, a.
which holds true, except where the Husband is indebted to the King before the
Title of Jointure. In the second place are to be deducted debts due to others,
such as are clear and acknowledged; amongst which are to be reckoned services
and Servants wages, provided they be certain: But if they be uncertain,
although they depend upon courtesy: Yet if their stipends shall be set by the
Will of the Testator or his Friends, they shall be deducted out of the Goods of
the deceased, so shall Funeral Charges. The Wife also shall have her
necessaries, even her lodging in her Husbands chief Mansion house for 40.
days, unless her Dower be sooner assigned.

1. But that the Estate of the Party deceased may the better appear, the
Executors or Administrators, with the privity, and by the assistance of two at
the least of the Creditors or Legatees: Or if they refuse, then two of the next
of Kin [provided they be unconcerned] of the Deceased: Or upon their denial,
then of any two honest men, who are obliged to take true and faithful
Inventory of all the Goods and Chattels, Movables and Immoveables, which the
Party deceased had at the time of his death, and to write all and singular the
said Goods justly apprized in 2. Charters or Tables indented: The one to be
reserved to themselves, the other to be delivered to the Ordinary; But if the
Testator had appointed any of his lands or Tenements to be sold, the money or
profits thence arising are not to be put into the Inventory. 21. H. 8. c. 5.
Swinb. part 6. Sect. 9.


2. But the Heirs are obliged to satisfy the Debts of their Ancestors, which
the Chattels will not suffice to do. Glan. and Brac. ubi sup.
Yet if the whole Estate of the Testator would not suffice to pay Debts then,
the Kings Prerogative excepted, there used in former times to be a defalcation
every where. Brac. ib.


3. And even at this instant the Law is, that Legacies are not to be paid
before debts be satisfied; for in such cases the Executor is bound to pay the
Creditors out of his own Estate, Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 11. Bro. Execut. 116.
Perk. 488.
yet is he not tied to pay every one that demands a Debt, but those only
against whom the Testator, had he lived, could not have waged his Law. Bro. ib.
79. 87. 127. 163. 172. Dr. and Stu l. 2. c. 11. Plo. 181. Dyer, fol. 23. n.
144, 145 and fol. 80. n. 53, 54, 55.


4. The ancient Law seems to be somewhat changed, as to the privilege of
Creditors: Yet even now it seems that the Executor may in the first place allow
moderat Funeral charges, and then satisfy Creditors according as the Law
prescribes: and of those, the King is first by his Prerogative. Mag. Char. c.
18.
Next him, those to whom the Testator was obliged by Statute-Merchant, or
Recognisance. In the third place, those who have Judgments against the
Testator. Swinb. part 6. Sect. 16.
Fourthly, penal Obligations: Bro. ib. n. 88. 172.
And of these those have priority, whose days for payment are lapsed, Dyer,
fo. 80. n. 54.
and of those [if there be many] they who sue first: But if they commence their
suits together: Or that days of payment be not yet come, then it is in the
power of the Executor to gratify whom he pleases. Next to penal Obligations
follow simple Bills, Swinb. ubi super.
as we call them. And lastly, Contracts without writing, against which the
Testator could not wage his Law. As Servants Sallaries, and Rent of Lands or
Houses, whereof the Testator was Lessee for years or life, and the like. Bro
ib. n. 33. 87. 127. 163.
But as for made Contracts, Executors are not obliged to pay them: Id. ib.
Yet according to the opinion of some, these have their remedy in an Action
upon the case upon a promise of the Testator. Terms, v. Execut.


5. If a Creditor be made Executor, he may in the first place satisfy
himself, after which he is bound to pay the other Creditors out of the
residue. Plow. fol. 185.


6. If after Debts paid, there remains enough to satisfy Legacies, every
Legatee may of right claim his whole Legacy; Otherwise only according to the
proportion of the Estate, and the quantity of all the Legacies: Yet so, that
the Executor may first deduct charges, bonafide expended, and desperate Debts:
But under the notion of lex falcidia, we have not any thing, nor is there any
thing in that nature required from the Office of a Judge: But as to those Goods
which are not devised, they are convertible to the use of the Executor. Perk.
525.


7. Executors of Executors are obliged to the payment of the first Testators
Debts, unless his Goods appear to be fully administered by their Testator.

TIT. XXIII.
THese Inheritances are out of use with us, yet those Trusts are something
parallel to them, by which we are used to give our Lands to Strangers to the
use of us and our Heirs, or to private persons to the use and profit of a Body

those which are appointed to the next Title] we have no mention in our Law,
they being left wholly to the Civil Laws definitions.

Of Codicills.
TIT. XXV.
THe term Codicillus is seldom used with us; wherefore in this we only follow
that which we borrow from the Civil and Common Law, unless it contain either
a Fee or a Freehold. In which cases they are to be proved only before an
Ecclesiastical Judge, and to receive their Interpretation according to the
Laws of the Land.

The End of the Second Book.

Of Inheritances which are conveyed from such as dye even Intestate.
TIT. I.
THERE is also another way of gaining Dominion, which is by Succession, and
which happens to all Heirs of such things whereof their Ancestors dyed, seized
in Fee, or whereof they were at any time seized, as of Fee by Right of
Inheritance, without having alienated them. And this Descent ought to be to the
next Heirs, Males or Females, in a direct or transverse line: Wherefore Right,
like all heavy things falls downwards dire^^ly or transversely, nor does it
ever ascend (...) same way, by which, by the death of the ^ncestor it discends,
yet does it collaterally ^scend, sometimes for want of Heirs to whom (...) may
descend. Glan. l. 7. c. 1. Brac. l. 2. c. 29. n. 1. Dr. and Stu. l. 1. c. 7.
Flet. l. 6. c. 1. and c. 2.


1. A Right discends to the Heir, where^^ever born, whether in the womb, or
beyond (...) on this side the Sea, and that whether within or without the
Dominions of the King. Provided, his Parents be the Kings Liege People, and
that the Mother went over Sea with her Husbands leave, nor can any man create
to himself an Heir, because God only makes them, and because, Haeres, is not ab
Haereditate, but Haereditas ab Herede.

2. Now Inheritance is a Succession to the whole right, which the Ancestor
deceased had in Fee, upon what cause soever, whether by Acquisition or
Succession, with Seisin or without, and if by Seisin, then at whatsoever he was
seized, either in his life time, or at his death, namely upon the day, on which
he died, and if the right descend to more Heirs, successively, and without
Seisin; yet the Heir has the same Seisin appertaining to him as the Ancestor
had in the time of his life, or at his death. And where there is a
participation or meeting of Propriety with the Seisin, the Heir has
immediately, Ipso facto, a Freehold. Glan. and. Bract. ib. 25. E. 3. Stat. 2.
and 42. E. 3. c. 10. Flet. l. 6. c. 1.


3. Our Authors do not make in the case of Heirs a like division, some
distinguish them into nere and more Remote, Glan. l. 7. c. 3
and some into near and more near, remote and more remote, Bract. l. 20. c. 30.
n. 1 Brit. c. 118. Flet. l. 6. c. 1. and 2.


4. If one have many Sonns they are all near Heirs, those that were last born,
and those that were born before them, Bract. ib.
and so are Daughters when Sons fail. Glan. ib.


The next Heir, is he who was born first, Bract. ib.
unless the custom of the place hinder, Glan. ib.
or that he be a stranger, and the younger Brother a Denizen, Dr. and Stu. l.
1. c. 7. and c. 20.


6. An Heir remote is where one has many Sons and Daughters, the Sons are near
heirs and the Daughters remote, this holding always for a Rule, that the males
shall be preferred before the females of the same degree, Bract. l. 2. c. 30.
n. 3.


7. If there be many Sons, and no Daughters, but Grandsons, the Sons shall be
near Heirs and the Grandsons remote, Id. ib.
if there be many Daughters and no Sons, they shall be all next Heirs. Glan. ib.


8. So may they be termed more remote in respect of the Inheritance, being
more remote as the lineall Nephew or Neices Son, his Grandson, his great
Grandson, his great, great Grandson, etc. In the direct line, or if there
want of that line, then in the transverse, Ad infinitum. Bract. l. 2. c. 20.


9. It is the ancient custom of England, that the eldest Son should succeed as
Heir to his Father, but where there is no Son but Daughters; then all the
Daughters shall be Coheirs, Dr. and. Stu. ib. Glan. ib. Flc. l. 6. c. 1.
which is also true in Nephews, and their Children, where males are wanting.

10. And this was always a Maxim, that a Fee-simple could never ascend from a
Son ^o a Father or Mother or any other Ancestor* ^n a direct line, Coo. l. 3.
fo. 40. Ratlifes case. Dr. and. Stu. ib. Bract. l. 2. c. 29. Lit. l. 1. c. 1.
Brit. c. 119.
nor can any one in a ^ransverse line, succeed, so long as there is an Heir, to
whom it may descend in the direct. Bract. l. 2. c. 31. n. 1. Flet. l. 6. c. 2.


11. That Issue which is born before marriage is by our Law a Bastard, nor can
it succeed in an Inheritance, nor can a Bastard have any Heir save of his own
Body. Dr. and Stu. ib. 20. H. 3. c. 4. Perk. 49. 50.


12. Chattells neither personal nor real come unto the Heir but by the
custom of the Kingdom to the Executors, or from an Intestate to the Ordinary;
and from him to the Administrators whom he shall appoint, Glan. l. 7. c. 16.
Perk. 48.
or if no body will administer, then ought the Ordinary to sequester them upon
his own peril. 13. E. 1. c. 19. 31. E. 3. c. 1^. 21. H. 8. c. 5. Flet. l. 2.
c. 57. Dier. fo. 277. n. 57.


13. The Lord of the Manor is in stead of Heir, when either through defect, or
in case of Felony, the blood is extinguished, Flet. l. 6. c. 1.
yet at this day this is not without distinction.

Of the legal Succession on the Fathers side.
TIT. II.
IN the transverse or collateral line, the Rule is, that those are Heirs who
partake of the whole Blood with the party deceased. For example, A. has Issue
B. a Son, and C. a Daughter by one Venture, and D. a Son by a second Venture, and
dies B. succeeds him and dies without Issue, in this case C. the Sister shall
succeed and not D. Lit. l. 1. c. 1. Brit. c. 119. n. 7. Flet. l. 6. c. 1.


1. So also A. having a Brother B. and two Sons, viz. C. by one Venture, and D.
by another dies, to whom C. succeeds and dies without Issue, in this case B.
the uncle who is of whole-blood shall succeed, and not D. the Brother, Lit. ib.
Coo. l. 3. Rat. case fo. 40.
but if B. die without Issue then D. shall succeed, being of entire blood with
him both by the Grandfathers side and Grandmothers: And therefore, if B. had
not been Brother to A. both by Fathers side and Mothers side, it should have
been otherwise.

2. The collateral line is double, one descending by the Brother to his
Children, the other ascending by the uncle, but none succeed on the ascending
line, but for default of Heirs on the descending. Bract. l. 2. c. 30. n. 1.
Brit. c. 119.


3. He is Heir in the collateral discending line, who is nearest in degree,
and if this line fail, then he who is next to the party deceased in the
ascending collateral line. Bract. ib. Flc. l. 6. c. 2.


4. If there be two in the same degree, and both males, the elder is to be
preferred; but if they be male and female, the male is Heir, as in the direct
and right line. Brit ib. n. 1. 2. and 7.


5. Where an Estate comes by the Mothers side, there the Son dying without
Issue, the next of kinn on the Mothers side is Heir, and not the Brother of the
Father, Id. ib.
but where the Son purchases an Estate with his own Money and dies without
Issue, there the next of kinn on the Fathers side shall succeed; and not on the
Mothers side, unless for defect of Heirs on the Fathers side, Lit. l. 1. c. 1.
Coo. l. 3. Rat. case. fo. 39.
but the Heir on the mothers side shall succeed, rather then the Land shall
escheat to the Lord. Plow. 444.


6. A. has two Sons, B. and C. B. in his Fathers life time commits Felony, and
is punished with Death, after which A. dies, the question is whether the Fee
whereof A. died seized, shall escheat to the Lord, or descend to C. the second
Son. And here it is to be considered, whether B. dyed without Issue, for then
it discends to C. otherwise it shall escheat, Dier. fo. 48. n. 15.
but if B. had been condemned living his Father, and survived him; In this case
notwithstanding his dying without Issue, the estate should have escheated and
not descended to C. Kitchen, tit. Escheat, f. 110.


Of the Tertullian Decree.
TIT. 3.
WE in the case of Fees follow the Rigor of the twelve Tables, which will by
no means suffer an ascending from Children to Parents, Bract. l. 2. c. 29. n. 1.
wherefore if this seem harsh to any one we shall wish him a Tertuilian, or
Claudius, to persuade our Senate to the contrary.

Of the Orphitian Decree.
TIT. IV.
CHildren with us do equally, succeed to Inheritances coming from the Fathers
or Mothers side, and that by the same rules, and in the same degrees, Flet. l.
6. c. 9.
wherefore we have no need here of an Orphitius.

Of the Succession of Cozens by the Mothers side.
TIT. V.
THe Romans called those particulerly, Cognati which were allied by the female
side, Ult. S. 1. ^. de gradibus affinitatis.
but there remains nothing to be spoken of them, the two former Titles being
considered, viz. The first and second of this book.
where we have shown: That these are never to succeed as Heirs, but for
default of Heirs on the Fathers side; which is so to be understood, that the
most remote Cozens on the Fathers side discending in a direct line, but not in
a collateral, are to be preferred before the nearest on the Mothers side, for
the great great Grandchild of my ^^neall Niece, or of my Sister, shall succeed
(...) before my Sons or Daughters, Cozen-^erman. Bract. l. 2. c. 30. and 31.


1. This briefly I thought also to insert, that (...) default of Heirs in a
right line discending (...) in each collateral line, the Land shall ^scheat to
the Lord of the Fee. Glan. l. 7. c. 17. Bract. l. 2. c. 29. n. 1. Lit. l. 1. c.
1. F. N. B. 143.


Of the degrees of Consanguinity.
TIT. VI.
HAving mentioned degrees, it is requisite to take a view of the persons who
are ^n possibility of succession, and who are preferred before others in
succession, from the first degree of the same line to the last. Bract. l. 2. c.
31. n. 2.


1. In the right line ascending are these, Grandfather, great Grandfather,
the great Grandfathers Father, the great Grandfathers Grandfather, the great
Grandfathers great Grandfather, and so ad infinitum. Id. ib. Flet. l. 6. c. 2.


2. In the right line discending, Father and Mother are first which make the
common root, then Son and Daughter, the Nephew and Neice, and so, Ad infinitum.
Brac. and Flet. ib.


3. In the collateral line ascending, Brother or sister, of Father or Mother
make the second degree, and so their Heirs, Ad infinitum. Id. ib.


4. In the collateral line discending are Brother and Sister, and their
Heirs, Ad infinitum. Id. ib.


Of the Consanguinity of those who are servile.
TIT. VII.
THis Title is with the ancient Civilians reckoned as part of the former
Wesenb. in the same Title.
no^ does our Law determine any thing in the cases of such as are manumitted,
contrary to the rules of those who are born free, there Marriages being a like
lawful.

Of the succession of such as are made free.
TIT. VIII.
PAtrons are not with us admitted to succeed those who are made free, in case
they die without Issue, wherefore if any one purchase a Fee after Manumission
and die without Heirs, the Lord of the Fee shall claim it by Escheat; and not he
who gave the party deceased his freedom, F. N. B fol. 143. T. etc.
the same rules are also for the Chattells of such dying Intestate as for those
who were born free.

Of the assignation of such as are made free.
TIT. IX.
THere is no difference with us between those who are manumitted, and those who
are born free, save that they some time were Servants, wherefore we have no use
of this kind of Assignation in our Commonweath.

Of the possession of Goods.
TIT. X.
THE supreme power with us gives the possession of a Fee to the Heirs of them
who hold the Fee of him by any kind of service in Capite, for he by his
Prerogative has the primer seisin of Lands, Stan. Prerog. c. 3. and 13. F. N.
B. fo. 255. and. 256. c.
nor can the Heirs receive them but by his hands, those who hold of other
Lords by Knights service (much more Tenant in Socage) so soon as they come of
age, enter upon their Estates by right, and in case their Lords hinder them,
may have their Action, having satisfied the value of their marriage. (b)

1. But for those goods which we call Chattells, the Ecclesiastical Judge, who
is in stead of the Ordinary, give possession of them according to the Will, or
at least confirm the possession being taken, to the Executors of the party
deceased, but if there be no Will, then he grants Administration to the widow
or next kinsman of the party deceased, yet so that the goods shall be
distributed according to his Judgment, either amongst 31 Ed. 3. c. 11.
them, or for pious uses. Linw. provin.


Of acquiring by Adrogation or Adoption.
TIT. XI.
THere is nothing hinders, but that the English may adrogate or adopt, and be
adopted, but in this Case, the consent of both parties is solely essential,
for our Law determines nothing of this kind of acquisition, unless that which
naturally falls out between party and party in contracts.

Of him to whom Goods are granted for Liberty.
TIT. XII.
AS for those Servants, who receive their Freedom from their Lords by
Testament, the chief thing is the performance of the Will, for it is not
material whether the Executor will accept the Office. For we have shown
before, how ungrateful that old solemnity of the Romans, in Case of Wills is
to us.

Of Successions which were amongst the Romans by the Sale of Goods according to
the Claudian Decree.
TIT. XIII.
WE have not this kind of acquisition amongst us, yet have we something like
unto it, for the Fees, and all other the Goods of Banckrupts (who having
consumed their fortunes withdraw themselves, That their Creditors may not
arrest them) wheresoever they be found are divided toward the satisfaction of
Creditors, by such Honorable persons, whom the Statutes in this Case mention,
34 H. 8. c. 4 13 Eliz. c. 7.
but above all, that most famous Act in King James his time does most carefully
provide in these Cases. 1 Jacob. Ses. 1. c. 15.


Of Obligations.
TIT. XIIII.
WE have before treated of persons and things, and are now to speak of Actions:
Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 1.
now an Action comes from precedent Obligations, as a Child from a Mother, Id.
ib. n. 2.
an Obligation is a legal Bond or tie, whereby we are necessarily bound to the
giving or doing of any thing. id. ib. c. 2. n.


All civil Obligations may be divided into two kinds, Obligations by the
Common Law, and by Statute. The Example of the former, is that which vulgarly
we call a penal Obligation, etc. and of the later, that which we term a
Statute Merchant, or whatever [d] West. Symb. l. 1. Sect: 156: etc
else takes its Original from any Statute of this Commonwealth. 1 E: 1 Stat:
1: 38 E: 3: c: 4 New book of Ent: Action sur ^e Statute: Flet: ^: 6: c: 64:


2. An Obligation from a precedent cause, that is either from a Contract, or
something of nature, or from a misdemeanour, or something of that nature. There
are former Species of obligations by Contract, by a thing done, by words, by
writing, by consent.

How an obilgation is contracted by a thing done.
TIT. XV.
AN Obligation is contracted by a thing done, as by mutual giving, which
consists in weight, number, and measure, in weight, as in things which are
weighed, as Brass, Silver, Gold. In number, as in Money numbered. In measure,
as in Wine, Oil, Corn: now these things which being weighed, numbered, or
measured, are given to this end, that the receiver has immediately a propriety
in them, make a mutual Contract, that being properly mutual, which Ex meo,
becomes Tuum, and when things of another nature are rendered to the Creditor,
and not of the same. Glan: l: 10: c: 3: Bra: l: 3. tr: 1: c: 2, New book En:
Debt. in Approm. 1, 2, 3, Flet, l, 2 36,


I^ a man by Error pays money to another to whom it is not due, he shall
recover it again by his Action upon the Case, and he who took what was not due,
is obliged. In tit: this Title, Sect, 1,


2. He to whom any thing is given for him to make use of, is obliged in the
thing lent, but there is a great difference between a thing mutual given, and
a thing lent, for he that receives a thing lent is bound to make restitution in
Specie, or to the value, if accidentally it happen to be lost or consumed, by
fire, ruin, shipwreck, Theives (...) the incursions of enemies, or lost any
other way: Nor is it sufficient, that he keep them with the same care and
diligence as his own if any other person could possibly have preserved it with
more safety, but no man is obliged against a greater force or casual ac^^dent,
unless they happen by his own neg^^gence; as if one take a thing lent, home
with him, himself being to go travel, and th^^ chances to be lost by the
Incursion of enemies, robbers, or by Shipwreck: there is n^ doubt, but in this
Case he is bound to restitution. Brac. ib. Brit. c. 28. Glan. l 10. c. 3. F. n.
b. 121. B. Dr. and Stn. l. 2 c. 138. Flet. l. 2. c. 56.


3. Now a thing that is lent is given (...) commodum, and is properly called
Resco^modata, there being no reward given for its use by way of hire, and
whatsoever is lent, ought to be lent gratis, for when any reward inte^veneth,
it is rather a locution or putting to hire, then a lending. Brac. ib. Glan. 30.
Flet. c. 13. ib.


4. He also with whom a man intrusts any thing is obliged, and bound to restore
it, as also if he have committed any fraud or deceit in Brac. ib. Terms v.
Garnishment. Dr. Stud. l. 2. 24. and 38. D. or Ent. Action sur le Case. Garder,

relation to it, but he is not obliged under the notion of a fault, as for
carelessness and negligence, for that whosoever commits any thing to a
negligent friend, it is to be imputed to his own folly, but this Law seems now
changed, unless he that received the thing in trust, promises expressly to
keep it as his own. Coo. l. 4. Southcots Case


5. A Creditor, who receives a Pledge, o Pawn is also obliged, and bound to
restore it and of such things are given for the convenience of both, viz. by
the Debtor for to procure the money to be lent him, and to the Creditor for his
security, it is sufficient to keep it with a due care, which if he shall
perform, and accidentally loose the thing before the debtor tender the money,
he is secured, nor shall he be hindered from recovering his Debt, Brac. ib.
Glan. ib. F. n. b. 86 C. boo. Ent. Action sur le Case Gage 1. and Terms v.
Mortgage. Flet. l. 2. c. 56.
now we call that a due care and diligence, which a man has toward his own
Goods. Coo l. 4. Southcots Case.


Of obligations by words.
TIT. XVI.
A Verbal Obligation is contracted or made by Covenant, now a Covenant is a
certain conception of words which consist of Question and answer, as if it be
said, do thou promise? I do promise. Will thou give? I will give. Will thou
do it? I will do it. Will thou engage? I will engage. Brac. ib. n. 2. Brit. c.
28. Flet. l. 2. c. 56.


1. Every Covenant is either pure or limited to a day, or conditional. Pure;
as where it is said, do thou promise to pay so much money? without adding any
day or condition, in which case the money may be demanded immediately, but if
there be a day added when it ought to be paid, it is immediately due, but
cannot be demanded before the day, nor upon the day, because the whole day is
left to the discretion of the Debtor, (b) nor is it certain that it will not be
paid that day, before the day be past, nor can any one in like manner demand if
one promised to pay this year, or this month, before every part of the year
or month be past. Brac. and Brit. ib.


2. A Covenant is made sometimes conditionally, as if it were said, if A. be
made Alderman, do thou promise to pay so much? where observe, that in this
which is conditional, there is only hope, and expectation, and conditions
which relate either to time past or present, do either totally adnull the
Obligation, or else not at all differ it, as if a promise be made to pay so
much, if A. were living, or be now living, for if he neither were living, nor
yet is living, the promise is void, because those things which in nature are
now certain, do not vitiate an Obligation by their being uncertain as to us.
Brac. ib. n. 3. Brit. ib. Flet. ib. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 35.


Things to be done, may also be resolved into promises, as a promise to do a
thing, or not to do a thing, in which Case it is best to add a penalty because
of incertainty, or least the Actor be forced to prove the value, now a penalty
is thus added, if this be not done, then thou promisest to pay so much, Nomine
pe^e. Brac. ib. n. 4. Flet. ib.


4. But it is to be observed, that this verbal Obligation is called a simple
contract, Dr. and Stu. l. 2, c. 24.
by out Authors, who weigh that which is done F. n. b. fo. 119. G. West. l. 2.
Contracts. Sect. 3. Sec Dier fo. 90. n. 8. and fo. 336. n. 34.
more strictly then the definitions of things and that they do not bind,
unless there be as consideration, or a quid pro quo, F. n. b. fo. 120. K. and
112 H. Bro. Con^racts 5 Dier 272. n. 31. 32, and fo. 296. n. 22.
as where a promise is the occasion, that any one ^oth hat which otherwise he
is not obliged unto. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 20, and 24.


A Covenant in the Civil law is perpe^all, but with us a Contract, though in
^riting does not oblige the Heirs, Execu^ors, or Successors, Dier, fo. 23. n.
142.
without which they be ^pecially named, or that the King be Cre^itor. Flet. l.
2. c. 6. Bro. Garranty 89. Coo. l. 2. Cromwells Case. Plow. 457. Dier 14. n.
67. and f. 42. n. 12.
Nor does it work anything, as to ^mmoveables, Plow. ib.
much less therefore will ^n Action lie against Heirs or Executors, upon a
verbal contract.

6. We do seldom contract upon a bare promise, especially in things of
consequence, because it is often made void by a wager in Law. B^o. Legager
throughout.


Of the two parties in a Covenant and Promise.
TIT. XVII.
THere may be two parts, covenanting in our Law also, and in this case either
of them may release, and the Survivor may claim the whole, if it be unpaid,
Bro. Executers 149.
but there are more frequently two or more in a Promise there being scarce any
one at this time who will lend any considerable Sum to one alone.

Of the Covenants of Servants
TIT. XVIII.
SErvants also with us may covenant in the person or stead of their Lords, to
whom the Fee and other things which they shall purchase, shall be due. Dr. and
Stu. l. 1. c. 8.


The Division of Covenants.
TIT. XIX.
A Covenant is either Judicial or by consent, Judicial is that which is by
command of a Judge, the other is by the consent of both parties, without
command of any Judge. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 2. n. 6. F. n. b. f. 123. C. and D.


Of void and unprofitable Covenants.
TIT. XX.
IF a man promises to give a thing which is not in Re^um natura, nor cannot be
possibly, it is Brac. ib. n. 5 Flet. l. 2. c. 60.
void, so if one promise that which is not any ones particularly, as a thing
sacred ^r public. Brac. ib.


2. So he that promises another man, who is not under his power shall give or
do (...) thing, is not obliged. Brac. ib. Perk. 759.


3. If one covenants for another, then ^or him whose Villain he is, it works
Brac. ib. Brit. c. 28. Flet. l. 2. c. 56.
nothing.

4. He who answers not according to demand, nor according to what he is asked,
(as if one covenant to pay me ten pounds, and another promises five pounds,
or if one covenant absolutely, and another conditionally) makes his covenant
nothing. Brac: ib: n: 4. Flet. ib.


5. Nor are Covenants or promises worth any thing, being made with or to them,
who are under our power. Brac: ib,


6. He that is mute can neither Covenant nor promise, since he cannot speak nor
utter words congruous to a Covenant, which is always received as to those who
are deaf, because he who covenants ought to hear the words of him that
promises, and he that promises of him that covenanteth, unless it may be
done, by signs or writing, nor is this spoken of those who hear with
difficulty, but of those who hear not at all. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 2. n. 8.
Brit. c. 28. Flet. ib.


7. A mad man cannot covenant, nor indeed do any thing, because he does not
understand what he does. Brac. ib. Brit. ib. Perkins, 3, 4, 5. Coo. l. 4.
Beverleys Case. f. 123.


8. Whatever also is covenanted with a Monk Brac. Brit. and Perk. ib.
feme covert, Id. ib. and Perk. 722. 735.
or servant Broo. Gontracts 40.
in and for their own persons, is invalid, as also by him who is condemned of
felony, as far as it redounds to the prejudice of the King, or Lord. Perk. 26,
27. etc.


9. Those Covenants and bargains which are extorted by force and fear are
invalid* as if any one by reason if Duresse of Imprisonment promises or
grants any thing b^ word or writing Brit. ib. Perk. 16. 19. Fulb. paral. c.
bargains fo. 15.
which is so to be understood if the pact or agreement do at all relate to the
thing for which the party is imprisoned, Perk. 18.
so if any one threaten to kill, imprison, or beat me, if I do but give or sell
him such a thing, it makes the gift invalid, unless the fear be less then
usually happens to a resolved man. Fulb. ib. Flet. l. 3. c. 7. Plow. fo. 19.


10. So neither can an Infant, or he that is next to an Infant, and who differs
not much from a madman, Covenant, unless it be for his own benefit: And by the
Authority of his Guardian, Bract. ib. 5. Brit. ib.
yet in some cases an Infant is bound. Plow. fo. 364.


11. A Covenant is made also invalid, by a condition which is naturally
impossible; as if the Covenant be to give me so much if I touch heaven with my
finger, Bract. and Brit. ib. Flet. l. 2. c. 56. Dyer. fo. 169. n. 1.
but if it were conditionally I did not touch Heaven with my finger, that were
good, and be coming absolute and pure, and the Money may be immediately
demanded. Bract. and. Fle. ib.


12. A Covenant is unprofitable also, if it be to pay so much to day, in case
such a ship shall come from Asia to morrow, yet although it is preposterous, it
shall not be rejected, Idem. ib.


13. But that Covenants, and Obligations may be in writing it is evident; for
if it be written in an Intrument, that a man promises, it is so to be
construed, as if it were in answer to a preceding question. Bract. ib. n. 8.
Flet. ib.


14. If where many things are reduced into a covenant, the Obligor promises
simply; so I promise to give: He is obliged to all; and if he promises one
thing solely of many or some certain things, the Obligation is contracted into
those to which he answers, Bract. ib. n. 5 Flet. ib.


15. But there are such Covenants and Obligations at this day found out for
this purpose, that every one may have and assure to himself his own Interest,
if there be any thing done against it which is mentioned in the Covenant, and
if the thing mentioned be given to another, yet notwithstanding the Covenanter
shall have his interest, because the Obligor is bound to the interest, or to
the penalty, if there be any, Bract. ib. n. 9. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c, 20. and 21,


16. If any one Covenants with another, himself being interested, it seems
that he is pleased; the Covenant shall be good, as if a Guardian Covenant with
his Ward. Brac. ib.


17. It is to no purpose for any one to Covenant, that that which is his own
shall be his own in the same manner and form as it is his, for that which is
once mine by one cause, and from one, during my possession, cannot be mine
again by the same cause, and from another.

18. If the Covenanter thinks and supposes one thing and the Obliger
another, the Covenant is no more valid then if there had been no answer at all
to the question. Brac. ib. n 4. Fleta ib.


19. Nor is it valid if any one covenanteth with thee to commit an Homicide or
Felony, etc. For thou shall not by this be obliged. Brac. and Brit. and Fleta,
ib. Perk. 723.


20. A Promise is invalid also to the Keeper of a Goal or Prison, that a
Prisoner upon Execution shall not escape or break Prison, for we suppose this
^o be against common Right and Law, which wills that men imprisoned for debt
should be kept more strictly, that they may more willingly and readily
endeavor to satisfy their Creditors, Bro. conditi. 45. 85. Cromp. Jurisd. fo.
10. Dyer fo, 118. n. 1. and fo. 34. n. 33.
which seems true in all cases, where the Prisoner is not baile-able. Plow. fo.
63. etc.


21. Where a man covenants under any Condition, and dies before the Condition
be performed, though the Condition be yet in being, yet our Law does not give
any Action to an Heir or against an Heir. Coo. l 2. case Crom. fo. 78. and 79.


22. If there be any day of payment mentioned which will never come, as
Doomesday, etc. it is immediately due, Bro. obligat. 58.
a Covenant for the person of a man or for an Estate is good. But the thing so
mentioned in the Covenant cannot be demanded, before so much time be past, as
wherein it may conveniently be delivered.

23. It does not seem that one can well be covenanted with by a Body politic,
because they obleige themselves to nothing, save under their common seal,
Bract. ib. n. 2. Bri. ib. Coo. l. 3. Butters case fo. 28. etc. Fulb para. c.
Barg. fo. 14. A.
but if one buyeth any thing which is converted into the use of a Body
politic, the whole Body seems to be bound. Broo. Corporations 53.


Of Sureties or Pledges.
TIT. XXI.
HE, whom the Civil Law calls Fide justor, we call Plegius or Surety, when any
thing is lent to another it is used to be ^one by the giving of surety, in
which case (...) the principal Debtor fail, so that he is ^nable to pay, then
we have recourse to the ^^reties Glan. l. 10. c. 3.
and not before Brit. ib. Flet. ib. F. N. B. 137. F.


1. Now Sureties, if there be many, are every one obliged in the whole, unless
it be ^therwise covenanted, when they become ^ledges, and that satisfaction was
to be requi^ed from them altogether, so that if many ^uretys were given, and
some or more of them ^ecame insolvent, the whole burden of ac^uitting belongs
to the rest either for the ^hole, or for so much as they have made de^ault.
Gla. l. 10: c. 5. F. N. B. 122. K.


2. But if in case of giving sureties, some ^ureties do oblige particulerly,
for certain ^arts, as for what shall happen as to those ^articulers whereto
they oblige, they are ^ot responsible for any more then those par^iculers to
which they do obleige. Glan. ib.


3. Now if sureties happen to be sued through default of their Principalls, and
be ^ompelled to make payment, they may have their Action, against him n. Bo.

Of obilgations by writing.
TIT. XXII:
ONE may be obliged also by writing, (...) if one writes that he owes another,
(...) is indebted to another, he is obliged by (...) writing, whether the Money
be numbered (...) not, nor can be except against the writing that the Money is
not numbered, because (...) has in writing acknowledged himself (...) debred.

1. Obligations in writing are of a higher nature and more binding with us then
Cor^nants; for in these there needs no consideration to be expressed, Plow: fo:
308:
if in any case there (...) be a verbal Contract which is afterwar^^ reduced
into an Obligation in writing, the former Contract is wholly extinct, nor wi^^
there arise any Action from it, but the Bo^^ only remains in force, F: N. B:
fo: 121: Bro: Obligat: 21:
which notwithstanding, in case of Debt upon record, (...) another former
Obligation in writing is ^therwise; Bro: ib: 23: Fulb: c. Borrowing, fo: 52.
Dier, fo. 21: n: 131.
nor is an Obligation in writing made void or discharged by any verbal promise
of not requiring the Money. Dier, fo: 51: n: 12:


2. Now of this there are two sorts: the first, is called simple, or single,
where in the Obligor or Debtor only acknowlegeth the Debt, and promises
payment: the other Conditional, which obliges to a greater (...) as namely
double) with a condition annex^d, which freeth from the penalty, provi^ed the
principal Debt be paid at a day as^gned.

3. And this is divided into Conventio^all and Judicial. Conventionall is that
which by consent of Parties is written and ^aled, and delivered before private
men. The Judicial is that which is entered into before a Judge, or one that is
in stead of a judge: Of which sort are Recognisances and Statutes Merchant, and
of the Sta^^le. N. B. Entr. Action sur le Statut.


4. A Recognisance is an Obligation in ^riting enrolled, or upon Record,
testifying ^he Debtor or Recognisor to owe such a sum ^f money to the Creditor
or Recognisee, and (...) acknowledged in a Court of Record, or before a Judge,
or publque Minister authori^ed to take it. Now these are the Masters of ^he
Chancery, the Justices of either Bench, ^he Barons of the Exchequer, Justices
of the ^eace, etc. And those are properly called Recognisances, which are not
sealed by the Recognisor, but written and enrolled in the Arches and Treasuries
of the Court. The power and force of which is such, that for non-payment
Execution is granted, and the Creditor has possession given him of all the
Chartels of the Recognisor (except his Oxen and other Instruments necessary for
Husban^ry) as also of the moity of his Lands until the Debt be satisfied.

5. A Statute Merchant is an Obligation in writing, sealed and enrolled, or
upon Record [as we say] witnessing the Debtor to owe unto the Creditor such a
sum: this is acknowledged before such persons as are appointed by the
Statute: As Clerks, who from their Offices are called Clerks of the Statute
Merchant, the Mayor, principal Guardian of London, or two Merchants (...) the
same City, especially appointed: Or else the Mayor, Recorder, and other fit men
of other Cities or Buroughs which have this power, and they are sealed both
with the Scale of the Debtor, and of the King, for the King has a special
Seal for this purpose, divided into two equal parts, whereof the one which is
least is committed to the care and custody of the Clerk of the Statutes, the
other to the Mayor or Guardian. The body of the Debtor is liable to be taken
upon execution of this Obligation, if he be a Layman, and can be apprehended:
But if he be not, or cannot be taken within 3 months to make satisfaction, his
Goods and Lands are liable: West. ib. sec. 151. 13. E. 1. st. 3. 5. H. 4. c. 12.
But if the Debtor be in prison, the Creditor must afford him Bread and Water.

6. A Statute of the Staple is double, one properly so called, the other
improperly. That which is properly so called, is an Obligation enrolled or
recorded, which is acknowledged in the presence of the Mayor, and of one or two
of the Constables, and sealed by him. Now by force of this Obligation, if the
Debtor make default in payment, the Creditor by authority of the Praetor
seiseth and detaineth the Body, Lands, and Goods of the Debtor until he be
satisfied, ^rovided he be found within the limits of the Staple, or that his
Goods may be taken. But if neither his Body, nor sufficient of Goods be found
there, the Chancellor of England upon Certificate of the business, un^er the
Seal of the Mayor, decrees further, That both his Body and Goods, wheresoever
they ^e found, shall be taken, and his Lands exten^ed until satisfaction made.
West. ib. sec. 173. 27. Ed. 3. St. 2. c. 9.


7. That which is improperly called a Sta^ute of the Staple, is an Obligation
acknow^edged before either of the Chief Justices, Or in their absence, before
the Mayor of the Staple of Westminster, and the Recorder of London, and it has
the same force in Execution as the other: But it is called so improperly,
because it is not only used as the other among Merchants, but according to that
Example, amongst all the Subjects of England. West. ib. sec. 55. 23. H. 8. c. 6.


8. It has been often questioned, whether that little piece of wood, which we
call a Tallie, with an Obligation written upon it, and sealed with the Seal of
the Debtor, may be called an Obligation in writing: But because letters written
in wood may be easily raced out, and altered, it was resolved unfit to allow
and open so apparent a way to decei^. Bro. oblig. 80. F. N. B. fol. 121. l.


9. These conventional Obligations ought to be in the first person, those which
are in the third being of no force, though some will have these being made
amongst Clerks in other Nations beyond Seas valid. 38. E. 3. c. 4 Bro. Oblig.
51. 65.


10. Amongst those Obligations in writing, which we call Faits or Deeds: there
are some things so essential, that an Obligation cannot be good without them,
other things less necessary and essential. Of the first sort are writing in
Paper or Parchment. Of the second, Inditing and Form: The omission of which
does not invalidate the Obligation. Coo. l. 2. Godwards ca^. fol. 5. Dyer, sol.
192. n. 26.


Of Obligations made by Consent.
TIT. XXIII.
OBligations are not only by writing and words, but by Consent; as in Contracts
which are bona fide, namely Bargains and Sales, Lendings and Borrowings,
Partnerships and Hirings. Wherefore these kind of Obligations are termed
Contracts by consent, in regard writing and Presence is not always necessary.
Glan. l. 10. c. 14. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1.. c 2: n. 9.


1. We must not here omit that our ancient Lawyers called those Obligations
which were contracted by the Thing, Words, and Writings, or Consent; not so
much Contracts, as the compleatings and perfectings of Contracts, to which they
add Livery and Joining; Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 2. n. 1. Brit c. 28.
that is, an accumulation of Agreements, or adding Agreement to Agreement.
Flet. l. 2. c. 60.
For a Contract cannot be without consent, and therefore possible it was for
that reason. The other Forms were rather Ornaments and Compleatings, because
the Consent is chiefly material, and is in all, as giving being to a Contract,
and something more, wherein the Consent is declared and proved.

2. We have spoken susticiently before of Livery. The joining which we here
intend, is, where many Agreements for one and the same thing are reduced into
one Covenant. For many Agreements and Parts may be reduced into one Covenant,
as well as many things. Brit. ib. Brac. ib. n. 11.


Of Bargain and Sale.
TIT. XXIV.
BArgain and Sale is, where there is an Agreement concerning a price between
the Contracters, there being something received by the Buyer by way of Earnest,
that being an Agreement of the Bargain and Sale contracted, unless there be a
day given for payment, in which case it is not necessary. Bro. Cont. 15. and
Action sur le case, 60.
But if there be any Writing intervening, the Bargain and Sale cannot be
perfect, unless it be delivered to the parties, and absolute: And where there
is neither writing, intervening, nor any Delivery follows, they are at
liberty, and the Contractors may without penalty recede. Glan. l. 10. c. 14.
Brac. l. 2. c. 27. n. 1. Flet l. 2. c. 58.
But if there be any thing given by way of Earnest before any Delivery, and the
Buyer repents of his Bargain, so that he desires to recede, he shall loose what
he gave: And in case the Vender repents, he shall make restitution double:
Glan. ib. and Brac. ib. n. 2.
But if the price be paid, or part of it, and Delivery follows, the Bargain
and Sale shall be perfect. Not can either party recede under pretense of
non-payment of the price in part, or in the whole: But the Vendor may have his
Action, and recover what is wanting of the price, but not the thing it self.
Id. ib.


1. Now it is necessary that the thing sold be certain or reducible to
certainty, and a certain price agreed upon: For there can be no Bargain without
a price certain. Nor can demand be of a thing uncertain: but if it be agreed
between the parties, that there shall be so much paid for the thing bought, as
such a one shall value it at, unless that party will sell the price: Or in
case he refuse, or be not able, there shall be no Bargain and Sale, as not
having agreed upon any price. Brac. ib. n. 1. Flet. l. 2. c. 58. Dyer, fol. 91.
n. 11.


2. And to the making up of a Bargain and Sale, it seems consistent with our
Law, that the price for the thing bought be in money numbered, otherwise it is
but a Contract in the nature of an Exchange: Fulb. par. c. Exch. 32. Perk. 244.
Although if such things be exchanged as cannot conveniently be transferred
without writing. The word Exchange ought necessarily to be inserted, to make an
Exchange: Fulb. ib. h Bro, Exch. 2. 12.
And it may be the reason is, because the word Exchange implies a warranty. (h)

3. In a Bargain and Sale before and after Delivery, he who has the thing runs
the hazard of it, unless it be otherwise agreed from the beginning; because
indeed he who has not as yet delivered the thing to the Buyer is still reputed
Master of it. For by Liveries and Uses the Owner-ship is transferred: For
Example, If an Ox dye before it be delivered, or a House be consumed with
Fire, or Land in part or whole be drowned and lost, it seems that all the
hazard shall be upon the Vendor. On the contrary, if after Sale, and before
Delivery any thing happen to be added to a Fe^, the profit shall redound to the
Vendor; For the Commodities ought to go the same way with the Discommodities,
and the profits ought to be his who runs the hazard and danger. Brac. and
Glan ib.
But there needs no Livery where Lands are sold by Deed enrolled, N. Terms,
Bargain. Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 7., Lit. l. 1. c. 8.
or alienated by Exchange.

4. Bargain and Sale may also be contracted among some, either Pure or
Conditionally: As if the Buyer like a thing in a certain time, it shall be his
for so much money, otherwise that it should be restored. Brac. l. 2. c. 27. n.
2. Flet. l. 2. c. 58.


5. But if one buy a thing sacred of a Vendor in regard the Contract cannot
stand, the Buyer shall recover as to his Interest against the Vendor, that he
be not deceived, although the Buyer be obliged to know what and whose the thing
is which he buyeth, whether sacred or not, and whether bound or not. Iidem. ib.


6. But if a Vendor sell any thing for sound, and without maime, which
afterward proves maimed and unsound, and that it can be proved by the Buyer to
have been so at the time of the Contract made, the Vendor is obliged to take it
again. But if it were sound and without maim at the sale, the Vendor is not
responsible for what shall happen afterward. Glan. l. 10. c. 14. Brac. l. 2.
c. 27. n. 2. F. N. B. 94. and Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 42. Flet. l. 1. c. 58.
Dyer, fol. 75. n. 23.


7. When any one sells a thing immovable, as Land, and in the Sale promises
it to be free, when as it is servile, or disingaged, and not bound, whereas it
is bound and engaged. The Contract is not broken by this, but the Buyer may
have his Action against the Vendor for nonperformance of promise, which is
alike good, if he assume to make good either for the quantity or quality, and
afterward the contrary be found. Fulb. par. Barg. 15.


8. The Vendor and his Heirs are bound to warrant to the Buyer and his Heirs
the thing sold, whether it be moveable or immovable. Glan. ib. c. 15. Brac.
ib. and l. 5. tr. 4. Dyer, 75. n. 23. Flet. l. 7. c. 38. and l. 6. c. 23.
Though some are of opinon that they are not obliged to warranty by the Law,
but in cases expressed by the Law. Fulb. ib. Coo. l. 3. Fermors ca^e, 78. and
l. 4. Nokes case, 80.


9. Things incorporeall cannot with us be sold or bought without writing. Dr.
and Stu. l. 1. c. 8.


10. Meats which stink, and are putrified, and Commodities which are fallacious
are prohibited to be exposed to sale; 13. H. 4. c. 1. 11. E. 4. c. 7. 1. R. 9.
c. 1. with others.
but these things belong to the public Law.

11. The property of things alienated in Fairs, or public Markets, are
altered, unless they be the Kings, or that the Contracts be by Covin and
Collusion: so that in this case the Buyer is free from all fear of Eviction,
Dr. and Stu. l. 1. c. 25. and l. 2. c. 47. and 49.
provided there be such things observed in the buying of Horses as the Law
requires. Brac. l. 2. c. 28. Cromp. Juri^d. 221. Dyer, fol. 99. n. 66.


12. And lastly, as Actions cannot be given, so neither can they be sold,
except it be to the King, or by the King. Plow. 79. Bro. chosein Action, 4.


Of Letting and Hiring.
TIT. XXV.
LEtting and Hiring is next to Bargain and Sale, because as Bargain and Sale
is contracted after the price is agreed upon, so Letting and Hiring is for a
set Hire or Rent: Glan. l. 10. c. 19 Brac. l. 2. c. 28.
For when a man lets his Estate to another for a certain Term and Rent, the
Lessor is bound to give the thing leased for use, and the Lessee to pay his
Rent. Brac. ib. Flet. l. 2. c. 59.


1. Rent does chiefly consist in moneys numbered, yet it may also be in Corn,
and the like: 34. Eliz. c. 11.
And sometimes the sole Reward or Hire is in Fealty. Lit. l. 1. c. 7.
But when Land is leased for Land, this is an Exchange. Id. ib.


2. Emphytensis, which the Romans took for either Bargain and Sale, or Letting
and Hiring promiscuously, we call Fee-farme, of which we have spoken enough
before.

3. We also do let and hire Movables, as Horses, Oxen, Sheep, F. N. B. 86 D.
Bro. Leases, 23.
and Immoveables, as Land: F. N. B. 146. K. Lit. l. 1. c. 8.
So also things incorporeall, as right of Pasture, F. N. B. fo. 86. B. Entries,
Agistment.
Tiths, Terms, v. lease.
but those not without writing, Bro. lease, 1. 5. 12. 17. and 21. 23. H. 6. c.
10.
(unless any corporeal thing, as a Church, Churh-yard, Glebe, Parsonage
houses, etc. be chiefly and particularly let; for so under the name of the
appurtinences, Tithes and Oblations pass likewise.) Bro. lease, 15. 20.
So also Services and Labors: Entries, Servant. Dr. and Stu. l. 2. c. 38.
but not safely, as to the quantity, for that Errors are easily this way
contracted.

4. He who hires Clothes, Gold, or Silver, or other Ornaments, or Oxen, either
giving or promising hire, such a care is required of him, as a diligent Master
of a Family would have; which being had, if the thing by accident happen to be
lost, he is not bound to make restitution, unless it be agreed otherwise. Nor
is it sufficient that he have such a care of them as of his own goods. Brac.
ib. Dr. and Stu. l. 1. c. 23. l. 2. 6. 4. Flet. l. 2. c. 59.


5. Letting of Lands and Immoveables is at this day the greatest occasion of
suits of all others, wherefore it is requisite that we should speak more
largely in this place of these particulars. Every one may make a lease of
Lands, who holds them in Fee, whether he have Fee-simple, or Fee-taile, and
whether he be possessed in his own Right, in the Right of his Wise, or of a
Church, 32. H. 8. c. 28.
which is also true in those who hold as Partners: Lit. l. 3. c. 3
So also Cestuy qui use, Id. ib. c. 5.
a body politic may make a lease, but not without writing. Bro. lease, 32. 42.
As also he who has a Freehold, Id. ib. 4.
or a Lease, provided he exceed not his term, and Guardians until their Pupils
and Wards come to age.

6. He that has a Fee-simple in his own Right, may make a lease for as many
years as he pleases, provided it be not to a Body politic, lest by exceeding
it seem a Demise in Mortmaine. Bro. ib. 47.
He who has a Fee-tail in his own, or Fee-simple in another Right, viz.
either in the right of a Church, or of his Wife, is tied a little more
strictly, for that they cannot lease Land by a new lease which is already let
for above the term of a year. Nor any which were not usually wont to be let
within the space of 20. years past, nor those for a less rent then they
formerly were let for, or for a longer term then 21. years, or three lives,
and that without permission of waste. To these also may be added, that he who
has a Fee in right of his Wife may let it jointly with his Wife, but has no
power to alienate the Rent, but it shall come to the right Heir of his wife
after her decease. 32. H. 8. c. 28.


7. Archbishops and Bishops cannot let the Lands of their Churches for above
21. years, or 3. lives, to be accounted from the beginning of the lease, nor
for less Rent then it formerly went for, nor for less then formerly it used
to be let for. 1 Eliz. not printed, Dyer, fo. 145. n. 65.


8. Masters and Fellows of Colleges, Deans and Chapters, Wardens of
Hospitalls, and all Ecclesiastical persons are prohibted 13. Eliz. c. 10.
to let their Church, or College Lands for more then 3. lives, or 21. years,
to be accounted from the beginning of the lease, [nor this without their
private Statutes permit.] Nor so, unless the lease which is on foot [if there
be any] be within three years of expiring. 18. Eliz. c. 11.


Besides, the Colleges of both Universities, as of Eaton and Winchester, are
obliged to take the third part of their Rent in Corn: 14. Eliz. c. 11.
Yet are they not prohibited from letting freely those Houses which they have
in any City, Borough, Town corporate, or public Market Town, with the Lands
belonging to them (provided they exceed not ten Acres) according to the Common
Law of England, if it be not contrary to the private Statutes of their
Colleges. Id. ib.


9. It is not without reason questioned, whether a Prebendary of a Cathedral
Church may lawfully let part of his Prebendary, procuring the said Lease to be
confirmed by the Dean and Chapter, without any consent of the Bishop, the
Bishop being both Patron and Ordinary of every Prebendary: but continual and
daily Custom has rendered his consent unnecessary and useless. Dy^r, fol. 61.
n. 30.


10. Those who have Benefices, cannot make a Lease for any time longer then
they reside there (the liberty of being absent 80. days every year, being
always permitted them) unless by the Laws they are permitted to have two; In
which case in regard he cannot possible continually reside at both, he may let
one to his Curate. 13. Eliz. c. 20.


11. Lands and Tenements are often let for the life of the Lessee, Lit. l. 1.
c. 6.
or another life, Id. ib.
or for more lives, Id. ib.
or for term of years, Id. ib.
or lastly for a life: and afterward [that being expired] for a term of years,
Bro. leas. 51.
and that either by writing, or without, Littl. ib.
nor by Indenture only but by Deed-Pol. F, N, B: 148:


12. But if any one lets his Lands by writing or without, not mentioning any
term but giving the Lessee possession, He is presumed to let them for the life
of the Lessee. Lit. l. 2: c. l, Plow. 152.


13. There is no need of giving possession to a Lessee for years, for he may
enter by virtue of his Lease (unless besides the Lease there be a Grant of a
Remainder to another for life, or in fee in the same Deed Lit. l. 1: c. 7.
for if a man makes a Lease of lands for years, though he were Lessee before,
yet he does rightly take possession of the said Lands by this means. Id: ib:


14. Lessor is bound to warranty to the Lessee; for the Lessee being ejected
before the term ended may have his Action of Covenant against the Lessor, F:
N: B: fo: 145: M: Dier 328: n: 8:
and that whether he be disseised by the Lessor himself or by a more ancient
Title, nor only he, but his Assignee. Id. ib:


15. But if a third person eject him against Right, he shall recover damages
against the Ejector Id: ib:
unless the Lessor agreed by Indenture, that in case the Lessee were ejected
he should have his action of Covenant against him. Id: id:


16. Lessee for life by Indenture, in regard he has a Freehold, shall not
have an action of Covenant against the Lessor, in case he eject him before his
term ended, but an Assise. Id. ib.


17. Where a Lease is but for a year, and so from year to year, the Lessor
cannot eject the Lessee at the end of the Term, nor can the Lessee go out
against the will of the Lessor, For whosoever of them would recede from the
agreement, ought to give the other warning, Bro. lease 13. 22.


18. Lessor cannot remove his Tenant at Will, so as to hinder him from taking
the profits of his Seed or Corn sown, or without granting him convenient time
to remove his Household stuff, because the time is well enough force-seen and
known to him. Lit. ib.


19. All persons may regularly take forms, except spiritual, who are
prohibited, unless it be for the maintenance of their Families. 21. H. 8. c.
13.


20. Lessee is obliged to pay his Rent to the Lessor, which if he shall fail
to do; the Lessor during the Term may distrain, and this seems true, whether
it be agreed so or not: For whatsoever is brought by the Lessee into the
Tenement is annexed as a pledge for the Rent, Dr. Stu. l. 2. c, 9. Lit. ib.
Brac l. 2. c. 28. n. 1.
but after the term he cannot, Lit. l. 1. c. 5. Flet. l. 2. c. 59.
the payment of Rent admits no satisfaction, for the Lessee is not freed by
paying before the day. Coo. Bevills case, fo. 10. a


If Tenant of a Fee-farm does not occupy the Land leased for the space of two
years, by reason whereof there can be no distress, the Lessor upon his Action
may recover it into his own hands. 6 E. 1. c. 4. Westminster. 2. c. 21. F: N: B: fo:

22. But in most Leases whether for years, (...) life, it is covenanted, that

23. If Husband and Wife hire land at too ^^ere a Rent, the Husband dying
before the ^earm, the Wife may leave it, and if the Hus^and survive the wife
and dye, his Execu^^rs have the same liberty. If the Testotors Goods are not
sufficient to satisfy the other Creditors (the Rent being computed for (...)
term of years. Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 33. Dier fo. 146. n. 70.


24. If a man make a Lease for a year, upon Condition that the Rent shall be
paid at Michaellmas, and in the mean time give a general release to the Lessee
of all Actions and Demands: this does not remit the rent Lit. l, 3. c, 8.
although it seems something strange.

25. A Lessee is not only bound to the payment of Rent, Dier. fo: 4, n: 1.
but also to use well the thing leased: Id. fo. 324. n, 34,
so that if either he, or a third person commits Waste, he is liable unto the
Lessor according to the penalty of the Statute, 6 E: 1, c, 5, Dier, fo, 90, n,
9, and 10, and fo, 108, n, 31, and fo: 198, n: 43.
and is left to take his remedy against the third person, Dr. Stu, l, 7, c, 31,
and l, 2, c, 4,
unless he be a^ Infant; Id, l, 1, c, 17,
but it is not waste, to fell timber for necessary reapa^tions. Id, ib,


26. In sel^ing and hiring, the Law is the same as to the mutual obligation of
persons, as in Covenants. And therefore if the Lessee undertakes for himself to
do, or not do anything, his Executors or Assigns not being named, himself is
only bound, and they free from any manner of Obligation; Dier, fo, 65, n, 8,
but this is sometimes disputable: A Lessee covenants with his Lessor, that if
either he, his Executors, or Assigns, alienate the Lands leased to another,
that then it shall be lawful for the Lessor or his Heirs to re-enter, and to
eject the Lessee, his Executors or Assigns; and not long after the Lessee falls
sick, and by his last will constitutes his wife his Executrix, and dies; the
wife marryes a second husband who alienates her right, and term in the said
Lands; and it was much questioned, whether in this case the Lessor may enter in
regard this second Husband was neither Executor nor Assignee of the first. But
in the end it was determined for the Lessor, because the second Husband was in
this case adjudged Assignee in Law though not in fact. Dier, fo. 6, n, 5,


27. If a Lessee oblige himself to leave houses in repair at the end of his
term, the Lessor cannot bring his action of Covenant until the Term be ended,
although the Lessee should pull the houses down, yet he may bring an Action of

Of Partners or Fellowship
TIT. XXVI.
OUr judicious Lawyers are very frequent in disputing the Rights of those
partners or fellows, who hold Lands or other things pro indiviso; and these
they call either Partners, Joint-tenants, or Tenants in Common. Little. l. 3.
c. 2, 3, 4.


1. Partners are either by the Law, or by Custom by law, Terms. v. Parceners
and Little. ib.
and two or more women of the same degree, who for defect of Heirs Males
succeed by equal Right in the inheritance of their Ancestors, or else the sons
of two women to whom Lands not formerly divided by their mothers, descend
Little. l. 3. c. 1. and 2.
by Custom, are those who from the Custom of diverse Provinces which we call
Gavell kind do equally succeed their Ancestors, whether they be brothers, (or
for default of them) sisters, N^ices or Aunts.

2. Joint-tenant are either called so properly, or improperly, Instit. Jur.
Com. c. 15. Dier fo. 67. n. 18. and fo. 160. n. 43.
properly are those who hold a Fee, or Freehold or any real* Chartell by force
of the same Title, pro indiviso, improperly are those which possess any
personal Chattell so, and those are thus joined, either by their own will
solely; as purchasing the Premises with their own m^nies, and so possessing
them pro, indiviso, or else by the will and bounty of others, as where one
gives any thing to two or more jointly, ( Lit. l. 3. c. 4.
unless the Donees be a Body Politic, and receive under that notion, or at
least one of them, in which case they are tenants in Common. Id. ibid.


3. Partners and joint-tenants differ two ways, the former being joined by
necessity, and are called Partners merely in respect of their inheritance:
Joint-tenants have their name either from purchase or Gift, and are joined
together by their own Wills, and not by necessity. See the former quotations


4. Thereare also some, who are Joint-tenants only for life, and yet have
several inheritances: as where Lands are given to two men, or two women, and
to the Heirs of their bodies, in this Cafe so long as they live, they are
called Joint-tenants, for one of them having Issue, and dying, his fellow shall
have the whole during his life, who also if he shall leave Issue and die, his
Heir with the Heir of him that died before, shall hold the said Lands in
common, I^st. c. 15.
and if one of the Donees die without Heir, his part for defect of an Heir,
shall after the death of his fellow revert to the Donor. Littl. l. 3. c. 3.


5. Tenants in common are they who hold the same thing, as Lands or Tenements,
Chattells personal or real, jointly, but by several Titles, Id. ibid. c. 4.
for if one parcener alienate or give his Right to a stranger, the stranger and
the rest are Tenants in Common, though the rest amongst themselves enjoy their
former appellation.

6. Wherefore Tenants in Common differ from partners in this, that these do not
possess any thing in Common by Right of inheritance, as do the others: nor are
they joined by any necessity, and from Joint-tenant, in that they hold a thing
in Common by diverse Titles, or at least the Tenants are naturally so unequal,
that they cannot admit of any conjunction, such are bodies politic among
themselves, or with single persons. Id. ibid.


7. First for partners, these though they die before Partition, transmit and
leave their part to their children if they have any, otherwise to the rest of
their fellows. Id. ibid. c. 2. Inst. c. 14.


8. Partition may be made, either by mutual consent, Dier fo. 179.
or (if some refuse) by the power of the Judge, for he who desires to have his
part divided, may have a Writ of Partition, by which he shall compel the rest
to divide, F. n. b. 61. K. and 259. C. 260. B 261. C.
but if one woman Partner entermarry, and having Issue dies, the Husband being
Tenant by the courtesy, may compel them to a Partition, if it be not already
made. Littl. l. 3. c. 2.


9. Littleton does very fully describe the manner of making Partition, both by
consent and compulsion, but this is rather matter of fact then of Law; that
only is observable, that if Partition be made by consent, one or more of the
Partners being under age, it may afterward be corrected when they come to full
age, provided they do not confirm it when they come of age by receiving the
profits: Id ib.
and if it be a Fee-Tail, although all be at age at the time of the Partition
made, yet their Heirs may disagree to (...)* id ib.
so also, if an unequal Partition be made by the Husband of Coheirs after
Marrimony, is dissolved, either of them may disagree. Id. ib. F. n. b. 62 E.


10. If after Partition, any part of either o^ the Partners Estate lie evicted
by Law, He or she whose part it was, may compel the rest to a new Partition,
and recover a lawful part in those Lands which the rest hold. Little. ib. c. 2.


11. If there be an Advowson in the inheritance, and the Partners will not
consent in the Presentation of a Clerk, then the eldest shall present in the
first vacancy, and the rest according to their Case: and to this they may be
compelled, if they refuse to agree, and every one has therr lawful remedy, if
they be hindered from presenting in their turn. F. n. b. 34: T: and 36: C.


12. If there be two Joint-tenants of a Fee simple withi a Borough, where
Lands and Tenemenrs are divisible by Will, and one of them devises his Right to
a stranger, and dies, this Devise is void, and the reason is, because that part
which by the Law at his death comes unto the other by the Right of ^^crease,
and out of Descent cannot any way (...) conveyed to another by a Will (which
^^es not its Operation till the Death (...) the Testator) from him that claims
the ^^ole. Littl: l: 3: c: 3:


13. Two take a Lease jointly for years ^^th this condition agreed to between
the ^^ssor and them, that if the Lessees die be^^^e the Term ended, the Lease
shall be ^^id. The Lessees make Division: and one (...) them alienateth his
part, and dies, the (...) Lessor cannot reassume the part of him ^^at died, but
the Alience shall hold it du^ing the life of him that surviveth: nor has
^ccupation in this Case any force; but it two ^^ke a Lease for theit lives, and
make par^^tion, either of them dying, his part imme^iately reverts to the
Lessor. Dier fo: 67. c: 18:


14. Two are Joint-tenants for life, one of which lets out his part by
Indenture to a third person for years, reserving a Rent from it to him and his
Heirs, and dies, the question is, whether by his death the ritle did wholly
vanish, or whether the surviving Jointtenant ought to hold the whole for his
life; and if he ought, then whether he were left to his own libertty,
notwitstanding the Lease of his fellow, or to take only the Rent reserved upon
that moity, and it was adjudged by the Justices, that the surviver ought to
hold the whole Lands for life, and that free and disobliged from the others
Lease. Id: fo: 178 n: 5:


15. And this is the difference between Jointtenants in Fee, and, Partners,
that neither of the Donees can charge his Lands whi^^ he holds, pro Indiviso,
with any Rent long^^ then for life, but a Partner may, and the r^^son is, it
cannot prejudice his fellow or (...) Heir, who derives his Right not from hi^
but from the Donor, but Partners succeedin^ one the other for defect of Heirs,
may from one anotherr derive their Right. Littl. ib. c. 3.


16. Which notwitstanding in letting (...) clearly otherwise, for if one of the
Donee^ who holds, pro Indiviso, to him and his Hei^^ let out his Right for a
complete Term, (...) dies, the Lessee after his death may retain (...) during
the Term, nay he may enter into t^^ Lands, although they were not delivered
unto him in the Lessors life time, or an^ ways possessed by him, Id. ib.
and the reason (...) diversity between a Rent Charge, and a Lease is
iudiciously given by Littleton, Id. ib.
which (...) leave to be considered by the studious.

17. If there be two Joint-tenants of a Silva c^dna, and either of them, the
Wood being sold, retain the whole money to himself, his fellow can have no
Action against him, (d) nor could Joint-tenants or Tenants Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 14.
in Common formerly be forced to make Partition, Little. ib.
unless it were by the Custom of the place, F. n. b. 62. C.
but this is otherwise at present, 31 H. 8. c. 1 32 H. 8. c. 32.
and yet Joint-tenant, or Tenant in Common being eiected by their fellow, may
have an Action of forcible Entry against him.

18. Tenants in Common, for that they are in by diverse Titles, if they be
eiected by a stranger, must bring their Actions severally, which in
Joint-tenants is otherwise, Little. ib.
yet Tenant in Common may sue jointly for a thing which cannot be divided. Bro.
Tenants in com. 2. 5. and. 25.


19. This is the difference between those who hold chattells real, and those
who hold chattells personal in common, that they being eiected by their
fellow, may have an Eiectione firm, or an Eiectione custodiae terrarum, as
their case requires, but the other cannot, but are left to take them
themselves, when opportunity happens. Little. ib.


20. Tenants in common of chattells, real or personal may leave their part to
their Executors. F. n. b. 118 H.


21. If two possess Goods in common, and one of them deliver them to a third
person, he only may have his Action of account against the detainer, and not
his fellow, Id. ib.


22. this is equally true amongst partners, Ioint-tenants, and Tenants in
common, that they must bear an equal burden for that which they possess in
common, for if one or more refuse to contribute, the rest may bring their
Actions against the refusers. Id. 162 and 127.


23. Lastly, there is another kind of Tenure in Common with us, which comes
either by reason of agreement, Common in Gross.
or of Tenements amongst those of the same Fee, Common appendant, or
appurtinent.
or sometimes of diverse, Common by reason of vicinage. Dier fo. 47. n. 12, 13.
for in many Manors, the Lord has spacious and large grounds, in which every
Tenant according to the rate of his Tenement, has a Right of pasture, or of
digging Turf. But in regard these kind of grounds for the convenience of the
Commonwealth, cannot admit of Partition, Every one who has such a Right in
them may, (if through covetousness they put in too great a number of Cattle)
be recalled to just and equal bounds. F. n. b. f. 125


Of Commandments and Attornments.
TIT. XXVII.
A Command may with us, as with the Civil Law be contracted six manner of
ways, viz. by the sole cause of the Commander, F. n. b. 121.
or of the Commander, and the party commanded, or of a third person, or of the
Commander, and a third person, or of him that is commanded, and a third person,
or lastly of the commander or master, the party commanded or servant, and a
third person Examples might be easily given, but men's endeavors are not always
accepted, and therefore this command is not much in use with us, wherefore
these are to be implied from the Examples of letting, and other Contracts. Glan
l. 11. Brit. c. 28. New Book of Ent. Account, Attorn Commandment, Terms of the
law, v. Account Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 24. Flet. l. 2. c, 71, 72.


1. The Servant cannot have his Action against his Master for commanding him
any thing unjust, Brit. c. 28. Flet. l. 6. c. 27.
but a third person may if the command bring him any prciudice, Brac. l. 4. tr.
1. c. 10. 26, 27.
for that the Law supposes the Act of the Servant to be the Act of the Master.
Plow. 289, 290.


2. There is nothing hinders with us, but that a command may be deferred until
a lay, or be done upon condition, and is extinguished either by the death of
the Master or Servant. Flet. l. 3. c. 15.


3. The ends of a Command are diligent^y to be looked after, and observed, and
^^pt. Perk. 118. Fulb. pural. c. Contracts, fol. 3. Plow. fo. 14.


Of Obligations which arise from employed Contracts.
TIT. XXVIII.
OBligations by our Law arise from employed Contracts many ways: As for
transacting business Tutelary, dividing of Common. But as for the transacting
of business, and the like: Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 51. Brac. l. 3. tr. ^. c. 2. n.
10. Flet. l. 2. c 60.
that which is done by the command, or for the sake of one that is absent [if
Lawyers have informed me aright,] is rather left to the conscience and
integrity of him whose business it is, then to an Action to be satisfied. Nay
(which is more to be admired) it often happens, that for doing well a man may
incur the guilt of a Trespass: As if he drive his Neighbors Cattle out of
another Corn, or carry Tithes exposed to Cattle into the Parsons Barn.
Dyer, fo. 36. n. 38, 39.


1. Gardians may lue the debtors of their Pupils: And the Guardianship being
ended, as they are liable to render accounts, so may they claim the Expenses
which they were at, by reason of their Office, of their Pupils. F. N. B. fol.
118. B. Terms, v. Gardain in socage, Flet. l. 3. c. 15.


2. A Donee also who sues a Donee for the partition of a thing given jointly to
both; and a Partner who brings a Writ of partition against his fellows, may be
referred hither. Flet. l. 2. c. 60.


3. Furthermore, Executors may sue the Debtors of their Testators, and may be
sued by the Creditors and Legatees, Id. fo. 119. M. 121. O. 145 D. H.
which is true also in the Administrators of those who dye intestate: Id. fo.
120. D.
And in these successions also, whole Predecessors owed money, or had moneys
owing to them in the name of their Abbeys: Id. fo. 121. K. and 122. E.
And in the Husband, whose Wife was indebted before Marriage, or had money
owing unto her. Id. 121. C.


4. A Keeper of a Prison, who ^ets a Prisoner for Debt at liberty, renders
himself bound to the Creditor for the said money. Id. 121. A. P. 131. B. V.
Dyer, 175. n. 46 47. and fol. 278. n. 5.


5. An Heir is bound also by the Obligation of his Ancestor, if he be named in
it, and receives sufficient from him to satisfy, F. N. B. 120. l.
which however I suppose to be true only where the Movables will not satisfy
debts, or where the Executors are not mentioned. An Heir also is bound to
warrant Lands alienated by his Ancestor, with Charter of warranty, if he be
named in the Charter. Id. 134. D.


6. If one lets Lands for a certain Rent, and devises the reversion of them
to another by Will, the Legatee may claim the Rent of the Lessee. Id. 121. N.

By what Persons an Obligation is acquired unto us.
TIT. XXIX.
AN Obligation is acquired unto us by Procurators, and by Children, which we
have under our power and jurisdiction; by our selves and children of our own,
and by Freemen who serve us, and that by two causes, Viz. by works of their
own, and for something which is ours. Also by our own proper servants, or
servants which are common, or in which we have an use, or others which we do
bona fide possess, provided they covenant and bargain in our names. Brac. l.
3. tr. 1. c. 2. n. 12. Flet. l. 2. c. 60.


By what means an Obligation is taken off.
TIT. XXX.
AN Obligation is taken off by Payment, because every Obligation is removed,
when that which was due is paid, whether he pays it who owes it, or another
for him: And that whether the Debtor know it or not, or whether he be willing
or not, Brac. ib. ^. 1. Flet. ib.
which is only true, according to some, where the writing [if there were any]
be cancelled, or an Acquittance be to be shown by the debtor. Dr. Stu. l. 1. t.
12.
To the explanation of which assertion, some put a difference between a simple
and Conditional Obligation, and affirm, that the payment of a conditional
Obligation may be proved by Witnesses, although the writing remain entire, and
no Acquittance be shown: And that because the Party being bound to a certain
time under a penalty, he cannot without danger expect the delivery of the
Writing or Acquittance, seeing he is more strictly bound, then if the
Obligation were simple: So if the party pay, his Surety is free: And so on the
contrary. Brac. ib.


1. An Obligation is taken off also by Releases, which is an imaginary payment:
As if it be said; have you received all that I owe you upon any cause
whatsoever? And it be answered, or (if the Debt be in writing) written, I have
acknowledged to have received all. Perk. 749, 750. Dyer, 222 n. 22.
And this may be done for part of a Debt, as well as for the whole: As also all
other things whatsoever are reduced into a Covenant, may be taken off thus, and
in the same way which Obligations are. They may also be renewed, and reduced
into another Obligation, or more into one, as if a certain sum of money be
promised for many Debts, Causes, and Obligations. Brac. ib. n. 13. Lit. l. 3.
c. 8.
There is also a Release in Law, as where a man makes his Debtor his Executor;
for in this case he for gives the Debt, Bro. Testam. 118.
which is so far true, that it is whether he take upon him the Execution of
the office, or not. Plow. 184.


2. Also if Lands be charged with an Annuity, and the Debtor neglect payment
for some years, and afterward upon the payment of one years Rent obtain an
Acquittance from the Creditor, the action for the residue is utterly
extinguished. Dyer, f. 271. n. 26.


3. So also by renewing of Altering, as where an Obligation is transferred from
one person to another, who cannot be bound, it is wholly lost: As from the
person of one who is of age to another who is an Infant: And in renewing or
altering, there may intervene a surety and a penalty, as also a Condition: That
if the Surety do not well and truly pay, the Princiall shall remain. Brac. l.
3. t^. 1. c. 2. n. 13.


4. In brief, it is to be observed, that an Obligation may be dissolved the
same way, and by the same means by which it is contracted, if it arise from a
Contract, or any such like thing, namely by the thing, as if the thing be
restored, by words, as if it be to the contrary, and in contrary words. Dyer,
fo. 75: n. 25, 26, etc.
By writing; As if I write my self to owe money, and the Debtor write that he
has received: By consent, as if they agree mutually to recede from the
Contract: By delivery, as in case the thing be re-delivered: By joining, as in
case it be done on the contrary. Brac. ib.


5. Bracton also declares that an Obligation may be taken away by sundry
exceptions, and that many ways, whom any one that pleases may read. Id. ib.


6. There is also another way with us, which we call waging of Law; for if any
one challenges money of me upon a simple contract, I may wage my Law against
him, Id. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 13. n. 3.
i. c. I may promise to come into the Court at a day judicially assigned, and
perform the Law. Now to perform the Law, is in this case; To do that which
the Law requires, namely to make Oath, that neither the sum required, nor any
part of it is due: And to bring others with me who shall affirm upon Oath
likewise, that they believe the Oath I have taken to be true. Brit. c. 28. F.
N. B. 122. l.
Now this is nothing else but a Judicial transaction which our Laws permit us.

The End of the Third Book.
THE Fourth Book of the Institutes of the Laws of ENGLAND.
Of Obligations arising from Crimes.
TIT. 1.
THERE are Obligations also which arise from Crimes, or from things of the same
nature. Now Crimes and Trespasses proceeding from words and facts, are to be
distinguished according to the intention and will where with they are
committed; for the will and the intention are the Interpreters of the facts:
And from these Delinquencies proceed greater crimes, as Treason, Homicide,
Theft, Rapine, etc. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 2. n. 14.
(of which we shall discourse hereafter.) Or lesser crimes, as Injuries and
Trespasses; for under these all our Writers comprehend Obligations arising from
private crimes.

1. The Civil Law punishes manifest Theft by adjudging restitution to be made
fourfold, and Theft less manifest by rendering two fold. But the Laws of
England punish neither with less then death, provided the thing stolen be to
the value of 12. pence. Fortes^ue, c. 46. Bro. Crown. 2.


2. Theft is divided into Larceny and Robbe^y: Larceny is defined: The taking
away of Chat^els personal in the absence of the Owner, and is either Crand or
Petite according to the thing taken. Grand, is when the Moveable that is
stolen exceeds the value of twelve pence. Petite is, when it is under the
value. Westminster. l. 2. tit. Indictments s. 58. Spec. Justic. l. 1. c. larc.
Robbery is, when it is taken from the person, or in the presence of the Owner.
West. ib. s. 60.


3. Every Theft with us is a public crime; for Petite Larceny, though it be
not punishable with death, but with imprisonment, and stripes, is according to
some, accounted Felony, Bro. Coron,
though others are of contrary Judgment, Stam. pl. coron. l. 1. c. 15.
Wherefore we shall refer this ^ather to the Order of public Judgments.

4. Yet we have thought fit to observe here, That it is in his choice who
loses any thing by Theft, whether he will prosecute the party civilly or
criminally. For dissembling the Theft, he may suppose the Theife to have found
the thing by accident, and so detain it to himself, and so recover the thing
it self, or its value. Trover. in Book of Entr. Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 31. n.
2. Flet. l. 1. c. 38. Dyer, fol. 50. n. 5.
But of criminal prosecutions we shall speak hereafter.

Of things taken by force.
TIT. II.
THe word Trespass has a very large latitude, and comprehends every violation
of the Law. But our discreet Lawyers call only private crimes Trespasses, and
make distinctions even amongst these; for those who are accompanied with force,
are Trespasses more properly: F. N. B. 85. G. Fle. l. 4. c. 4.
Yet they call others Trespasses likewise from the species of an unlawful act,
though not violent, but accidental; or (to use their own words) su^ casu, F.
N. B. fo. 92. E. Terms, v. Action, sur le case.
whence the form of Action in the first case has always these words, [vi and
armis] and in the second [contra pa^.] But the Plaintiff may if he please,
dissemble the force, as where he brings his Action in the Sheriffs Court, who
has no Cognizance, de vi and armis: And though he feign a lesser Trespass,
when really it was greater, yet he shall recover damages: and this seems the
reason why our Writers do so often confound, and treat promiscuously of these
trespasses which are of a different nature. N. boo. Entries, tresp. 85.
Trespass, sur le case. 92.
Now we have thought it congruous enough to refer violent Trespass to the
title of things taken by force, and the other to the two following Titles. For
since the Roman Law makes the subject of these Trespasses, which our Law of
England divides only into two heads if threefold; lest it not seem strange,
that I refer some Cases, which beside the force, affixe a contumely also upon
the person injured, to a third Title.

1. Now the Action for Goods taken by force, or de vi and a^m^s, lies as well
for things taken by force which are inanimate as Cats, Ploughs, etc. As things
animate, as Oxen, Sheep, and those not only tame, but wild also, if they be in
our Custody and Jurisdiction. As Conies which are in our Warren, F. N. B. 89. K.
and Pigeons in our Columbaries: Id. 86 A.
So also for our Servants, Id. 88. D. I.
and for Apprentices, Id. 91. I.
for Wives drawn away with their Husbands Goods, Id. 89. O.
for the stealing away of a Son or a Daughter, who is an Heir, and marrying
them with any one without our consent, Id. 90. H.
for quantity, as many, Id. 87. M.
for goods of Felons taken out of our Liberty, Id. 91. F.
for Weifs and Strays driven or carried out of our Fees. Id. 91. B. new ^oo.
Entr. Trespass, Bro. Tresp. Fulb. Wrongs.


2. And this Action is given for the repairing the loss lustained; and that
not only against the party that did it, but against those that commanded the
doing of it, as in every Trespass upon the case: Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 9.
But not against the Executor of the Trespassor Id. l. 2. c. 10.
nor his Heirs, Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 4. n. 4.
because it is personal and penal.

Of the Aquilian Law.
TIT. III.
Trespass upon the case, is that which either brings damage to the person
injured, or disgrace and contumely with the damage, and this the Civilians
comprehend under the Title of the Aquilian Law, be cause Cains Aquilius was the
Author, being Tribune of the People; of this popular Law, by which these
trespasses were punished; though they referr this to the Title of injuries.

1. Now he who damnifies the Estate of condition of another, commits a
Trespass upon the case: As for example; where a Sheriff by a Writ directed to
him, takes a Debtor and afterward lets him escape, F. n. b. fo. 93. A. C.
or upon his return makes false Information to the Court, that the party has
no Lands or any thing else in his Bailiwick, whereby he may be distrained, and
so becomes the occasion of the taking of his Body, Id. ib, B.
so also; he who fixes stakes in any water, whereby another Ship or Vessel
laden with Corn, or other Merchandise is overturned, Id. 92: F
moreover an Attorney or Counselor at Law, who through ignorance or deceit
Iooseth his Clients cause, Bo: Entr. Action Sur le case in Attorney:
a Barber who shaves another Beard ill, or with a foul Raisor, Id: in Barber:
a Physician or Surgeon, who either ignorantly or maliciously handles a sick
or wounded person, Id. in. Phisi.
a Jailer who uses a Prisoner more hardly then he ought, F. N. B. 93.
he who distraines the Cattle of another Plough, where he may make other
reasonable distress, Dier. fo. 312. n. 86.
or he who having justly taken another Cattle by distress does not carry
them to an open Pound, but to a place unknown, the Rectory of a Church, a
Fortress, or into another County that they cannot be redeemed or replevin'd by
their Owners, F. N. B. in the Writ of Repleg. aver^: fo: 68. and the Writ
Vetito nannio 73.
he who interverts the Course of a River which should drive a Mill, Dier 248.
n. 80. and fo. 320. n. 38.
a Lessee or freeholder who commits waste. Id. fo. 36. n. 38. and fo. 256. n.
10.

Of Trespasses and Injuries
TIT. IV.
WE have declared how that under this general notion of trespass we
comprehend every breach of the Law, but we shall treat here especially, of that
which redounds to the disparagement and contumely of the person injured, as
when one strikes, beats, wounds, or maines another, Bract. l. 3. c. 19. ^. 1.
Flet. l. 2. c. 1.
or where without any force he asperceth the credit and reputation of another
by approbrious words, Id. ib. tr. 2. c. 24. n. 3. Flet. l. 4. c. 40, 41. Dier,
fo. 105. n. 15.
or by dispersing libells or falsely imprisoning him, Dier fo. 72. n. 6. fo. 75.
n. 21. fo. 118 n. 77. fo. 236. n. 26.
or ill entreating him in any such like sort. Bract. l. 3. c, 19.


1. They seem also to be guilty of this trespass, who plot and imagine
uniustly against the lives or fortunes of others, whom our Lawyers call
Conspirators. Dier fo. 85. n. 87. fo. 244. n. 61. F. N. B 114 G. 115. A. L.
116. M. N.


2. Nor are we only capable of being injured in our selves, but also in the
persons of those who are under our power, as of wives, Bro. Tresp. 43. Fulb. 79.
Children, Id. 90.
and Servants, Id. 80. and Bo. Enter. Trespass in Servant,
and Villains. Bro. Villenage 24. Trespass 53. Villenage 24.


3. A Trespass may be either greater or lesser according to the circumstances,
now the circumstances we account seven, viz. the cause which moves the Actor,
the Person as well of him that commits, as of him who sufers the injury, the
Place, Time, Quality, Quantity, and event. And these are material, either as
to the aggravating or diminishing the punishment. Brac: l: 3: tr: 1: c: 6:
Flet: l: 1: c: 16: and: l: 2: c: 1:


4. We call a contumely, or slanderous and injurious words spoken against any
nob^^ man, Scandalum magnatum, which deserves (...) greater punishment then any
other; in regard of the Honor and Dignity of the person injured, 3: E: 1: c:
33: 1: R: 2: c: 5: and 12: R: 2: c: 11:
unless it can be any way justly excused, Dier: fo: 285: n: 37:
but it is much doubted whether slanders spoken against a Prince may be
referred hither or not. Id: 155: n: 19:

fault, and by whose will the Injury was done. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1 c. 6.
and is given for the repairing the damages of the party injured; as himself
esteems them, and the Jury who in this case are Judges shall give. Id. ib.


6. Nor will words which are too general Coo. l. 4. S^anhops case fo. 15: n: 4:
or which have a dubious Interpretation, Id. ib Hext c.
or false accusations before a competent Id. ib, Bucklers case n, 3.
Judge, give color to this Action, besides that it may be defended by
Justification, Flet. l. 4. c. 17:
and adnulled by the dissimulation or tergiverfation of the party injured,
Brac. l. 4. tr. 1. c: 28:


Of Obligations which arise from imputed Crimes.
TIT. V.
A Judge with us according to some makes the suit his own by mis-judging, Brac:
l, 5, tr, 5, c: 15.
but at this day the party who is prejudiced and wronged by a Judgment; rather
removes his cause to another Court, either by a Writ of Error, if the Court
were a Court of Record, or otherwise by a Writ of false Judgment, and requires
amendment and correction of the former sentance. 27, Eliz. c, 8,


1. Yet are there Obligations with us also from imputed crimes, as in case an
Undersheriff give false information to the Kings Court, or make default in
Executing the commands of the Justices, the Sheriff himself shall undergo the
penalty, and not he, Dr, Stu, l, 2, c: 24,
so also, if the Kings Cup Bearer do substitute others in his Office, he shall
be obliged for their defaults, 25, E, 3, Stat, 2, c, 21,
which holds true not only in the Exchequer, 14, E, 3, Stat, 1, c, 9, Dier,
161, n, 45, and 238, n 38,
but in other Courts likewise where the Officers Deputies do not perform their
duties, Crom^, Juris, 111
as also in Escheators who substitute another whose Act they refuse to be
obliged by. 12, E, 4, c, 9, Coo. l, 4, Mittan case, fo. 33,


2. In the like manner are Hundreds of Counties obliged to the compensation of
what is lost by Roberies committed within them; unless they apprehend the
Theife: (b) And the Neighboring Villiages, to any place, whose Trenches and
Hedges are illegally thrown down by persons unknown, Id: c. 45.


3. So if a Servant by negligence burn his masters House and the neighboring
House to it, the Master is obliged; in like manner, is the Master of a common
Inn, if his Servant Plowd. ^o. 9.
or any one else within his Inn, Dyer. fo. 158. n. 32. fo. 266. n. 9.
take Moneys from any Guest within the Inn, and the Keeper of a Prison, if any
of his Servants suffer a Prisoner to escape, Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 24.
but of this you shall find many other kinds in our learned Writers. Fulb.

Of Actions.
TIT. VI.
AN Action and a Writ are often times used promi^cuously for a Writ wherein a
party is summoned, contains a breise and short narration of the Fact, which
produ^^th an Action. But those Lawyers of ours who profess the Explication of
Writs, asfirm them to be of a far larger extent then Actions The Author of the
Register, F. N. B. Bract. 1. 5. tr. 5. c. 17.
for that they contain many extrajudiciall commands of the supreme power, in
those businesses which concern either it is self, F. N. B. 232. 251. 147.
the Commonwealth, Id. 170. 169. 164.
or private persons, Id. 79. 164.
but the chief part of them are in cases of Judgment. Of which some constitute
Judges, Id. 110.
some require those who are already constituted to administer Judgment to those
who demand, Id. 153. 240.
some free men for a certain time from Judgments, for some special cause, Id.
28.
some force those who are unwilling to give security to bear Judgment, Id. 85.
some permit those who are in Suit, to substitute others, to prosecute for
them, Id. 156.
some prohibit and keep within compass those Judges who stretch their
Jurisdictions too far, Id. 39.
some remove causes from one place to another. Id. 70. 69.
Lastly some inform and commence process, Regist. Origin.
and others prosecute and bring to an end those which are begun, Reg. Judiciale.
now those which begin process are called original Writs, and those which
promote and end process begun, judicial. Regist. Brev.


1. All Actions flow either from the common Law, or from Statutes, Bro. Action
populer and Sur le Statut.
but from which soever they flow, they are all either against the person, or
the Estate, or both. Brac. l. 2. c. 3. n. 234.


2. Personal Actions are those which arise against any one from a Contract
real or imputed, or from a crime real and proper or imputed. Now those Writs
which are Issued forth in either case upon Contracts are for the most part
these. A Writ of Covenant, F. N. B. fo. 145.
of Account, Id. 116.
of Debt, Id. 119.
of Detinue, Id. 138.
of Trespass, Id. 92.
upon the case, in which the assumption is contained. Bro. Acton Sur le case 24.


3. Those which are issued out in either case, as touching Crimes, are those of
Trespass, F. N. B. 85.
Deceit, Id. 95.
breaking of a Park, Id. 100.
or Enclosure, Rescous, Id. 105.
Attaint, Id. 105.
Conspiracy, Id. 114.
Champerty. Id. 171.


4. Real Actions are those who are maintainable against any one not obliged to
us by any Right, because our estate corporal or incorporall, which is
immovable is possessed by him, or as it were in his possession, which he may
either restore or name the party in whose name he possesses it: as if one
demands of any one a thing certain, viz. a Fee, Lands, an Advowson, pretending
ones self owner of it, and sues not for the value, or so much in the same kind,
but the same specificall thing, and for this, that the demandant supposes the
thing his, and brings his Action against the Tenant, who denies it, the Action
or Plea shall be against the thing it self. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 3. n. 3.


5. If the thing sued for be a moveabe, as an Ox, an Ass, a Garment, or
something consisting either in weight or measure; although the Action or Plea
at first seems to be as well against the thing, as the person, because a
certain thing is sued for, and for that he who possesses it is bound to
restitution: yet in truth the Action is against the person, because the party
sued is not precisely bound to restore the specificall thing, but under a
disjunction, either the thing or its value, and he is freed by paying the value
only, whether the thing be to be had or not, and therefore if any one claim a
thing moveable taken away upon any occasion, or lent, he ought in his Action to
ascertain a value, otherwise it is of no force, nor signifies any thing. Brac.
l. 3. tr. 1. c. 4. n. 4. Fleta. l. 2. c. 60.


6. Now of Actions civil, and for a particular thing, as the claim of a
particular thing, some are confessory, and some negative, confessory, as where
one affirms a corporal or incorporall thing to be his, as a Fee: also: where
he affirms himself to have a Right of going through his neighbors Fee, or of
drawing water, even whether his neighbor will or not, and it is therefore
styled an Action for a particular thing, because he requires his particular
incorporall thing, viz. his Right of a way through a Fee; and confessory,
because it is by words of affirmation. But an Action negative is that which the
Lord or owner of a Fee brings against one who is accustomed to have a way
through his Fee, denying that he has any such Right, and this Action is said
to be for a particular thing; Because by it the Lord of the Fee does by it
claim his Liberty: and these kind of Actions are not for the Dominion or
property of a thing, but only touching the Right of Estates. Brac. ib. n. 7.
Flet. l. 5. c. 37. 38, 39, 40.


7. We have also something parallel to that which was anciently called Actio
Rescissorla, for if any one be dispossessed of his Estate being in durance, and
the Lands descend to the Heir of the Disseisor: the Disseisee has liberty to
recover his possession by his own proper Act, or (as we term it) to re-enter,
and if Judgment be given against him, he may reverse it afterward by a Writ
of Error, because his absence was not through contempt, but by reason of
Durance and imprisonment; and therefore it seems contrary to reason, that he
should be prejudiced by any such Record, and there is the same law, for those
who are in the Kings service, or who are beyond the Seas in any business which
concerns the Common wealth, and are in the mean time disscised being unable to
make their continual claim, nay there are some who affirm that he who is
beyond Seas about Litt. l. 3 c. continual claim.
his own business if he be disseised, may upon his return upon his own
authority reenter upon the Heir of the Disseisor, without bringing his Assise.
id. ibid.


8. And there is something likewise which answers to that same, Actio Pauliana,
and which is afforded by a particular act of Parliament, 13 Eliz. c. 5.
which renders all manner of alienations of Lands and Goods, made by the Debtor
to defraud the Creditor, void, and of none effect, and moreover inflicts a
penalty upon all those who are guilty of it, and who defend it as lawful.

9. Nor do we want that which equals the ancient Actio Serviana, for the
Lestor may of proper Right distrain upon goods which are brought upon his Fee;
and detain them until his Rent be satisfied, because we also do tacitly
esteem these in the nature of Gages, or Pledges, although this be not without
Distinction. Bro. Distress 13. 57. 99.
To this also may be added that Actio hyp^thecaria, and quasi Serviana, for if
any one receive moneys borrowed of another under a Pledge or Pawn, and cannot
afterward receive his pawn upon tender of the moneys, the Creditor refusing to
redeliver it, the Debtor may in this Case have his Action, F. n. b. 86. G.
and he is said to sue upon an Action quasi Serviana, who being seized of
Lands, as by way Mortgage, is disseised or elected out of them.

10. Now writs which are proper to real Actions, are either to recover a
property, or a possession, Flet. l. 6. c. 1.
those which appertain to a property are writs of Right which are of diverse
kinds, F. n. b. 1. 6. 11. 19. 193.
and those also which are of the same nature. Id. 157. Plow. 357, 358


11. We may sue for a possession, or for that which is of the same nature,
whether they be lost by force, or detained, being committed voluntarily to
another against Right, in which the former Cases we may be relieved by ^^its
which we call Assizes, F. n. b. 177. 179 181, 183. 134. 88. 190. 191.
and those which are of the like nature. 13. Ed. 1. c. 25. Brac. l. 4.


12. And for the recovery of a possession which being voluntarily delivered to
another is uniustly detained. There are writs of Entry of diverse kinds, and
others like them. F. n. b. 201. 205. 206. Brac. l. 4. tr. 7.


13. Prejudicial Actions also are reckoned among real: now those are termed
prejudicial which arise from incident and emergent questions, in which it is
inquired, whether one be born free or not, if not, then whether he be actually
free or a Servant? a Son or not a Son? and if a Son, then whether legitimate or
Bastard, etc? Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 4. n. 9. Brit. c. 108.
and they are called prejudicial, because they are judged and determined
before the principal Action. Id. ib.


14. Actions which are mixed, being as well against the thing as the person, and
so called because they have a mixed cause relating to both, as the dividing an
Inheritance between Coheirs, the setting of Bounds amongst Neighbors, for if
we respect the persons, they are both complainants, and respondents, although
he is not properly said to be complainant, who cites the other to come to
Judgment. The Writs which are proper in these Cases, are these de Partitione,
F: n: b. 61.
de rationabilibus divisis, Id. 121.
de perambulatione facienda, Id. 133.
de Curia claudenda; Id. 127.
de reparatione facienda. Id. ib.


15. Furthermore there are Actions which are given either solely as penal,
Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 4. n. 5.
or as beneficial to both, which some call Civil, criminal, or mixed. Glan.
l. 1. c. 1. Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 31. Littl. c. Releases.


16. Those which relate merely to a particular thing, are all those which grow
from Contracts, or of the same nature, and claim nothing for wrongful
detaining, or nomine penae, as a punishment of the Crime, F. n. b. fo. 1.
and those are penal, which are ordained for the preventing of misdemeanors,
of which sort are those popular Actions which are given to Informers for the
benefit of the Exchequer, and themselves against the breakers of Statutes, Id.
171.
and those relate both to the thing, and person, which regard the thing as the
principal cause, and the person as to personal performance, Brac. l. 3. tr.
1. c. 4. n. 5.
of this sort is a writ of Assise which claims the thing, as to restitution,
and yet is against the disseisor, as to Damages for the injury, Id. l. 4. tr.
1 c. 6. n. 3. 20 H. 3. c. 4.
and a writ of waste, which requires the thing wasted, and trebble damages. 6
Ed. 1. c. 5.


17. There is also a third division of Actions, for that some give barely the
damages (k) Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 4. n. 6.
sustained, some double, some trebble, and some ten-fold. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c.
4. n 6.
Those which give barely ^he Damages sustained, are all Actions of Trespass.
New book of Entries, Trespass.
Those which give double damages, as against such as make an assault against
those who are called to the high Court of Parliament, 11. H. 6. c. 11.
and against him who prosecutes any Action in the Court of Admi^alty, which is
not within the jurisdiction of ^he Court: And lastly, against those who ^et too
high a rate upon Victuals. 2. H. 4. c. 11.
Treble damages are against those who unjustly ex^ct money for the probate of
Wills and Te^^aments. 23. Ed. 3. c. 6.
Or who cause Ryots. 3. and 4. E. 6. c. 5.
And ^en-fold the damages are recoverable against (...) Juror who receives a
Bribe for bringing in (...) Verdict. Ib. and 1. Mar. Parl a. 1. c. 2.


18. Besides, we have not unaptly said some Actions to be bona fidei, and some
of ^rict Right; for though no such distinction (...) expressly found amongst our
Lawyers, yet (...) find them frequent in practice. For the Damages which we
receive from Contracts or Trespasses are left and remitted to the e^^^ty of the
Jurors, what, and how much it (...), and Judgment is given according to their
estimation. Where on the contrary, in Actions which have reference principally
to the thing, unles the complainant prove the thing (...) Action to be due, and
to be his, the Action falls, because neither the Jurors nor the (...) have any
other power in these then to condemn the Defendant, as to the thing in Action,
or to free him. Whence it happens, that one and the same thing often occasions
a double Action, viz. a principal Action for the thing which is of strict
Right, and another which is accessory for the recovery of Damages, which is
bona fidei.

19. In the distinction of arbitrary Actions from Actions, bona fidei. The
Civilia^^ do not very punctually agree. Nor do we find any other of them in
use amongst us in England, more then these we have observed: Only this we may
add, That the Chancellor of England, or the Keeper of the Great Seal [whose
Authority is almost the same] to whose Conscience and Equity every one who is
without remedy in the Law may appeal from other Courts before Judgment given,
is not bound or prescribed by any Laws, but that he may decide and compose
all causes which are for this purpose brought before him, according to the
Judgment and Conscience of a Good man, and imprison him who is contumacious
and refractory to his Decrees, and detain him there until he becomes
conformable. Plowd. 532.


20. We have no use with us of that which was called Actio de Peculio, in
regard we are not obliged by their Contracts, who are under our power, unless
so far as they be in order to our Commands. Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 42.


What is said to be a Contract made by him who is under the power of another.
TIT. VII.
THose Contracts which are made by our Servants by our command, are binding ^o
us: V. n. b. 62. F. n. b. 120. G.
For if I make one of my Servants ^y Bailiffe, and give him a power of taking
Oren or other Cattle to graze in my pasture (...) a certain price, I cannot
have an Action (...) Trespass, or de conculcatione herbarum against him, who
shall upon such a Contract ^urn his Cattle into my Pasture. Bro. Entries,
Tresp. in Agist.


1. But if my Servant shall borrow moneys in my name, I am no way obliged,
except the moneys be employed for my use, and ^y my consent, V. n. b. ib.
which is also true in what Contract soever. Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 42.


2. But if I send my Servant to a Market, ^ad bid him buy certain things for
me, and do not design any person, I am obliged to him of whom he buyeth those
things in my ^ame. But if he buy them in his own name, without mentioning me,
then it is otherwise, unless the things so bought come to my use. Id. ib.


3. If also I send my Servant to a Market to sell something of mine which I
know to be unsound, to A. In this case I am obliged by such Bargain and Sale:
But if I give him order simply to fell it to whom he can, here no Action will
lie against me. Id. ib.


4. If a Wife buyeth any thing in a public Market, and the party of whom she
buyeth it trusts her for the payment of the price: In this case her Husband is
not bound* unless the thing bought be converted to his use. V. n. b. 62.


5. But in some Cases the Law presumes a Consent of the Master (although there
be none particularly expressed) in the contra^^ of a Servant; as in those whom
Merchant^ place in their Shops or Warehouses, as Factors: For that the daily
and continual presence, knowledge, and sufferance of the Master do
sufficiently argue his consent, whether it be Wife, Children, or Servant, wh^
so trade in his Commodities.

Of those Actions which by the Civil Law lay against the Lord for an Offense
or Crime done by his Servants or Cattle.
TIT. VIII.
THis Action which is called Noxalis Actio, and lies against the Lords for the
crimes of their Servants, is unknown to us in England; for that they themselves
may be convened for their proper Crimes (our Villains not being otherwise
Servi, then as they are Ascriptitij) unless that any one commands his Servant
to do an unlawful Act, for in this case he is no less concerned then if he
had commanded any other, who was not in his power, or under his subjection. Dr.
Stu. l. 1. c. 9.


1. Yet as to bruit Beasts, and things inanimate, by which a man happens to be
slain, we have something like to the Noxalis Actio in use with us. For if a
Horse by kicking, or a Bull running mad, or a Cart drawn with Oxen happen to
kill a man, this, whatsoever it be, is in a manner sacred, [unlesse it belong
to the King.) And I question whether it were not the ancient custom to burn
them: But at this day they escheat to the Supreme Power, yet so, as that the
thing being sold, the money for which it was sold is disposed of by the Kings
Almoner, and employed in pious uses, and it is for that Cause called Deodand.

IT is a rule with us, that every man is obliged to repair those damages which

Grass, Trees, of Fruit, either by eating, or treading of them. Dr. and Stu. l.

1. And he that is damnified by another Cattle, may detraine them in a
public Pound until he be satisfied as to the Damages: Id. l. 2. c. 28.
So that if they dye for hunger, it is at the Owners peril, and not at his who
did impound them. But if the Owner offer sufficient for satisfaction of the
Damages, and the other refuse, the Owner may release his Cattle by the office
and power of the Sheriff, giving security, that either they shall be
forthcoming, or that he will pay so much money as shall be adjudged due for
the Damages: F. N. B. Re^levin.
And if upon the trial of the business before the Sheriff no Damages
appear, then the Owner shall by this means recover Damages for the detinue.
F. N. B. 69. G.


2. If ones Dog chase another Sheep, or bite them, by which means they either
cast their Young, or dye, or take any other hurt, the Owner of the Dog is bound
to make satisfaction, Boo. Entries. Tresp. in Chein.
which notwithstanding some deny, unless the Owner of the Dog knew that he
would bite, Dyer, fol. 25. n. 162.
or else set him on. Id. fol. 29. n. 195.


3. But if any one be driving a Flock, or Herd of Cattle in a public way,
and they happen suddenly to break into another man's ground, the party following
them, and endeavoring to keep them from committing Damages, is no Trespasser,

Of those by whom we may sue.
TIT. X.
WArds and Infants ought to sue by their Tutors, Guardians, or Attorneys,
unless in such cases in which Infants are bound to answer, notwithstanding
their Minority; but what those are is to be enquired of others. Brac. l. 5. tr.
2. c. 1. n. 2.


1. It seems that in ancient time it was at the pleasure of the Judge whether
one should have his Attorney or not, because the Writ seems to require a
personal appearance. F. n. b. fol. 25. C.
But this is by deg^ees changed by Acts of Parliament; 20. H. 3. c. ^0. 9. Edw.
1. c. 8. 13. E. 1. c. 10. 27. E. 1. Stat. 2. 12. E. 2 St. 1: c. 1 15. E. 2. 7.

c. 10. 15. H. 6 c. 7.
so that at this day nothing is more frequent and common, then for every man in
what cause soever that is private, whether it be real or personal, to sue or
defend himself by his Attorney. Yet at this day we might find many cases, in
which we are wholly forbid: And others, in which it is not permitted to make
use of an Attorney without leave from the Justices. F. n. b. fol. 26. D. Bro.
Attorn. 69. 81.


2. An Attorney also, or Procurator, according to the ancient Authors, may make
Oath for his Master. Brac. l. 5. tr. 2. c. 2. n. 3.


Of giving of Pledges or Securities.
TIT. XI.
IT appears from the forms of most Original Writs, That the Plaintiff was
bound to put in security, and give Pledges for to prosecute, before the
Defendant could be distrayned, taken, or forced to put in Bail. Spec. Inst. l.
1. c. des. Artic, etc.
But this custom is long since ceased, and those words of the Writ are become
merely formal, as many Practicers have told me: For that the Sheriff in his
return of the Writ names Pledges for prosecution, not as to oblige them to any
Process, but to avoid Error, since that really there is no body obliged.

1. How the Defendant in former times gave caution, or put in Bail for his
appearance, many have declared at large, but that for the most part is altered.
Wherefore for the more full handling of this business, we have thought it
needful to run over and examine the custom of every Court.

2. The Upper Bench in the Infancy of the Law did for the most part handle
criminal causes: And [if that be true which we read] took little cognizance
of private contracts, unless it were out of particular favor, but left them to
be decided by the Justices of the Common Pleas, the Sheriffs in their County
Courts, and Barons, and Lords of Manors. Glan. l. 1. c. 2, 3, 4. and l. 8. c.
10. and l. 10. c. 10. 18.
But at this day it receives and determines all civil Actions which can but be
drawn within the compass of Trespasses, vi and armis, or contra pacem: Cromp.
fol: 47.
And the Defendant, if taken within the same County where the Court is (viz. in
Middlesex) is brought to answer any private Action whatsoever without
distinction. This writ is called a Bill of Middlesex.
But if it be not found in that County, then he is supposed, under the pretense
of fraud or contempt, to sculk in the County where he dwells, under which color
he is commanded to be taken, and to be committed to the Marshall of the Court
to be kept. In whose custody so soon as he shall come, because he is now in
the same County where the Court is, he may be compelled to answer any Action
whatsoever, Dyer, fo. 217 n. 1.
and to put in Bail to the Action, unless he will go to prison: And by a
Writ of Error every Action, together with the Records of the Court which
concerns it, may be called into this Court at this day, not withstanding that
it could not take its beginning there. F. N. B. Bro. Error. Crompt. fol. 47, 48.


3. In personal and civil Actions which are prosecuted in the Common Banck,
or Common Pleas. There first issues forth a Summons, Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 31.
n. 2.
which is taken out of the Chancery, as all original Writs are. And if the
Defendant be not found; or being found, do not appear, there is issued forth
a Capias, Alias, and Plures, yet so as there are fifteen days intervene each
Writ: And if he be taken, he is committed to prison to be kept till the day of
his appointed appearance, unless he give security to the Sheriff (who is the
person commanded to take him) for his appearance; which being done, he could no
longer detain him, except it were for some particular causes,: V. N. B. 41. F.
n. b. 66. E.
But if after the Plures they could not be taken, then an Exigent was issued to
the Sheriff, in which he is required to demand him in open and public County
Court for five Court days together, to make his appearance: And if he did not
appear then, he was deprived of the Kings protection, and lost the benefit of
a Subject, for he was proclaimed out-lawed, and all his Goods, Chattels, Rents,
and Profits of Lands, and whatsoever did naturally grow thereon were forseited
to the Exchequer, notwithstanding that the Action was personal. Bro.
forfeiture. fol. 30.


4. In real Actions, if the demand be of a Corporal thing. The Defendant is
first summoned: And if he appear not, then the thing in Action is seized into
the hands of the Supreme Power until he do appear, V. N. B. fo* 126. 161.
which is done also, if after his first appearance he delay to answer. Id. ib.
If it be a Right which is in question, and cannot conveniently be taken, then
the Defendant is summoned, and not appearing, his Goods are distrained: Id. 71.
27.
But I cannot affirm this rule so constant as not to fail. Assis. ult.
present. fol. 26.
But there is no great necessity of being exact here, in regard every Writ has
a form in it of taking security, by which the Defendant is bound in Law.
Regist. Origin.


5. There is no Process lies against the bodies of Parliament men, or of
Bodies politic, but they are first summoned: and upon their contempt, their
Goods distrained until they appear: For the Law presumes them who are
Parliament men are able enough: V. N. B. fol. 61.
And bodies Politic have not visible Existencies whereby they may be taken.
Plowd. 538, 539.
And Noble men and Prelates who claim the Titles of Peers, and who sit in
Parliament, have always had the privilege, That in Corporations and Buroughs
through which they pass, their Horses cannot be distrained for Debt upon a
Contract or Trespass, so long as they have other Chattels there by which they
may be distrained. F. N. B. fol. 93. I.


6. There are certain Cases wherein the Defendants body may be taken without
summons, and he be compelled to put in bail for his appearance, in which
cases his Goods may be distrained, though he be not personally taken, F. n. b.
Trcsp. fo. 85. 92. V. n. b. 49.
as Trespass and other cases of the same nature. V. n. b. 121. 57. 69. 92, 93.
And if the Defendant have not Goods, then is he sued to the Utlawry.

7. In the Chancery, in cases of Equity, there is first a Summons under a
pecuniary mulct of a hundred pound, to appear at a day prefixed; Which if they
neglect, then their bodies are taken, if found, and either they are committed
to prison, or forced to put in Bail: But if they be not taken, then
Proclamation issues forth, and is made in diverse places of the County
publicly, wherein they are summoned upon their Allegiance. And if upon this
they appear not, then a Commission is issued forth to certain Eminent men, in
which they are permitted to seize them as Rebels, and to bring them, or cause
them to be brought into the Chancery by a day prefixed in the Commission. West.
part, 2. Sect. 22, 23, 24.
But even here also Parliament men enjoy their privilege; That the Lords
Chancellors by their private Letters do gently entreat them to appear, and
answer by their Attorney. Id. ib. 21.
But if in this Court Process be according to the custom of the Common Law,
as upon an account, Cromp. 41, 42.
or an Audita Querela. Plowd. 72.
Then are they also compelled to appear by Writs fitted for the exigency of
the business.

8. In causes criminal which are capital, as in Treason or Felony, there is
first a Capias issued forth, then Alias, and Plures, then an Exigent, and upon
nonappearance, they are out-lawed, Lambert.
but if they be apprehended they are in some cases committed to prison; without
any hope of being released until Judgment past, 1. West. c. 15. 23. H. 6. c.
10. 1 and 2. Phil. and Mar. Lambert l. 3. c. 2. pa. 334
but if it be only for a slight suspicion of Felony, or for Petite Larceny,
the Sheriff may take Bail for appearance, and is compellable upon his
refusal. V. F. n. b. fo. 41


9. If the Offense be not capital, the Sheriff is commanded to cause the
Defendant to appear, at a certain day to answer certain Articles, and if he
come not; the Sheriff is to make his return, and certefy the Justices, whether
the party have sufficient Goods and Chattells, or whether he have nothing. For
if he have, his Goods are to be distrained, till he come, if not, then Process
issues forth until he be out-lawed. Lamb. in supplement process.


10. There are other particular ways of proceeding, in causes criminal,
expressly appointed in particular cases which are to be collected out of such
Statutes, wherein they are enjoined are prescribed. Lamb. l. 4. c. 8. p. 505.


11 There are also certain cases in which the Plaintiff upon his own Authority
seiseth the Goods of the Defendant, and requires him to come to make an
extrajudiciall satisfaction, or at least to come to Judgment: As for Rent which
is due; either as a Service, Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 7. V. F. n. b. fo. 42.
or as charged Lit. l. 2. c. Release:

Of Perpetual and Temporal Actions which descend to Heirs and against Heirs.
TIT. XII.
OF Actions there are some which are perpetual, and some which cease at a
certain time, for although Bracton asfirmes, l 3. tr. 1. c. 3. n. 5.
almost all Actions to be temporal for want of sufficient proof, yet this
happens not so much from the nature of the Actions, as from the difficulty of
proof.

1. I call those perpetual which cease only tacitly through continual
forbearance, and which have not any set time expressly allotted for their
continuance. Of the second sort there are many which arise both from the common
Law and Statutes. For these if they be not prosecuted within the time limited,
do cease and fall: For example, the Owner of a Park has an Action against any
one that hunts in his Park, if he sue within a year and a day, but if he let
that time pass, the King only may prosecute the Action. (b) I Westminster. c. 20.


2. But there are some which are so perpetual that no process of time can
extinguish them: As those which by the Law of Nations are inherent in the Crown
by reason of the Kings Privilege and Prerogative. As of things which have no
Owners: Also of Things, Liberties, and Dignities, which appertain to the Kings
Crown, and in which cases no time occurs against him, if he require them: Where
he has no need of proof, but may recover without proof, unless the party
impleaded may have a Warrant, i. e. a special liberty granted by the King,
because he makes no defense from prescription. Bract. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 3. n. 5.


3. There are also some so purely temporal that when the person dies they
neither descend to his Heirs or Executors, nor do they lie against Heirs or
Executors, As those which are penal, for a Penalty ought not to be extended to
any other then the Authors, nor to proceed further then the crime extends it
self. Id. c. 2. n. and 5. and l. 4. tr. 1 c. 20. n. 11. Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 10.


4. Nor can Heirs or Executors sue or be impleaded from Covenants in writing,
unless there be particular mention made of them in the Instruments of
Covenants. Now what Actions are temporal from the Statutes of the
Commonwealth we have shown before. Lit. uses and Prescriptions.


Of Pleas and Exceptions.
TIT. XIII.
HItherto we have spoken of Actions, it remains that we speak something of
Pleas for Pleas are in the place of Actions, and in respect of Actions are
termed Pleas or exceptions, in regard that one impugns the other, and as those
who so are armed with Actions are prepared as it were with Swords, so the
Defendants on the other side are guarded with Pleas as with sheilds and
bucklers, Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 17. Fleta l. 1. c. 32.


1. Now an Exception or Plea is as it were the cutting asunder of an Action, by
which an Action is destroyed and defeated. Id. ib. c. 1. Fl. l. 6. c. 36.


2. An Action is taken away by the Plea of Per metum, and dolum, as if one
pleads such an Obligation to have been extorted from him, Per metum and dolum,
Id. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 2. n. 13. Brit. c. 28. fo. 66.
so also by reason of not counting or telling Money: As if a man promise Money
to another from whom he expects to have the same in a small time counted to
him, he may have this Plea against him, afterward when he shall demand it, yet
it seems that this Plea will not prejudice an obligation in writing Brac. l, 3.
tr. 1. c. 2 n. 9.
unless the Defendant can also show an Acquittance in writing, New terms
Acquittance.
also by Contract, as if one first covenant that he may demand and then, that
he may not demand, Brac. ib.
or if one does make satisfaction and recompenceth any way a trespass committed
by him, and so takes away the cause of Action, New terms Record.
so also by an oath, according to our ancient writers, viz. When an Oath shall
be brought, or related, and afterward ^worn, Brac. ib.
and lastly, by pleading a former ^udgment, as if the Ancestor of the Plaintiff
^r any of his Heirs lost the thing in Action ^y a Judgment in case of
property; as by a Grand Assise, or by Battle, or by verdict of (...) Jury,
upon whom they had put themselves. Id. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 28. n. 7.


3. Of Pleas, some are dilatory, and some Peremptory: Brit. c. 29. Terms, v.
Bar Flet. l. 2 c. 54. and l. 6. c. 36.
and of those which are dila^ory; some are Peremptory, as to the Jurisdistion,
and dilatory as to the Action, and not peremptory: And in like manner some are
peremptory as to the Writ, and dilatory as to the Action: Terms, v. Addition
Flet. l. 4. c. 10. Sect. 1, 2. and l. 6. c. 36.
some Pleas also are general as to all Actions, and some special which are
allowed only to particular Actions. For ^ll Actions have their proper Pleas,
according to the form of the Actions. Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c. 1. in the beginning.


4. And there is a kind of Plea which we ^all a waging of Law, and which is
(as to Law) peculiar only to us English; for the Defendant is admitted for the
defeating of an Action of Debt which the Plaintiff proves only witness
without any specialty to wage his Law, i. e. to make his defense against the
Suit brought by the Plaintiff by two compur^ators for every witness that is
produced unto the full number of twelve: now in this case ^e himself first
makes oath, that he does not ^we the sum, demanded, nor any part or parcel of
it, and the Compurgators swear out of their own credulity, that they believe
the Defendant to have made a true Oath, Flet. 1. 2. 63.
but against an Instrument or Specialty (as we call it) a Wager in Law licth
not. Dicr s. 23. 143.


5. Genciall pleas are those which lie generally against all Actions: As the
Plea against Jurisdiction against the Person of the Plaintiff, against the
Writ, that Plea which arises from time, according to the diverse sorts of
Actions, and that which comes by reason of the place through the Error of
bringing the Action there; now all these are dilatory as to the Action, and as
it were beside the Action, and therefore they do not defeat the Action
although, Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c. I. ^pec. Just. l. 3. c. Exceptions dila^ory.
Fletal. 2. c 61. l. 4. C. 10.
they do defer it and abate it for a while.

6. Now one may use many Dilatory Pleas and several, provided they come in
their proper places, but if there happen to occur more then one, which are
peremptory, as to the Actions, the Defendant ought to propose and prove one as
contingent to the Actions, as where a man has many Actions one ought to
betryed, because if the Defendant should fail in proof of two Pleas, he may
have recourse to the rest, and prove them, as if he were to defend himself with
many weapons, which ought not to be, if the proof of one be sufficient. Brac.
ib. c. I. n. 7.


Of Replications.
TIT. XIV.
AGalnst a Plea or Exception which seems plausible, and full at the first
sight. The Plaintiff may relieve himself by a Replication, as if a man brings
his Acton: the Defendant may plead a Covenant intervening to hinder the demand
or Action, against which the Plaintiff may in his Replication produce a
Covenant inserted after that which does permit and enable him to sue and
demand. Brac. l. 5. tr. 5. c. I. n. 4. Fle. l. 6. ^. 36.


1. After a Replication follows a Duplication, after a Duplication, a
Triplication, after a Triplication a Quadruplication, as the Case requires, and
so ad infinitum. And lo it may fall out, that an Action, which prima fasie
seems good, may be defeated by a Plea, and in the same manner a Plea, which
seems good by a Replication, and so in the rest.

2. Out Lawyers, call a Duplication, as well in the Chancerv, as in other
Courts a Rejoinder, and a Triplication a Sur-reioinder. Wests Proceedings in
Chancery, Sect. 56, 57.


Of Prohibitions.
TIT. XV.
INterdicta are wholly out of use amongst the Civilians, so that at this day
they make no disterence between them and Actions. The Roman Pretors used them
chiefly to reprcsse tumultuary and sudden violence, especially in the Cases of
possessions, but in these Cases our Ancestors were wont to delegate and depute
Justices of Oyer and Terminer, and Justices of Assizes, and those not to
determine all causes at set times, as now, but upon every particular emergency,
so soon as it first arose, Brac. l. 3. c. 7 n. 2.
but as things now are these kinds of businesses are dispatched by Actions or
decrees, which we call judicial Writs, or at least by the help and assistance
of the Sheriff, and Justices of the Peace in every County: 13 R. 2. Stat. 1. c.
7. 15 R. 2. c. 2. 8 H. 6. c. 9. 13 H. 4. c. 7. 19 H. 7. c. 13. 2 H. 5. c. 8.
Lamb. l. 2. c. 4. and l. 3. c. 1.
but whosoever desires to read what our Sages of the Law have written
concerning or recovering of a possession, let them read Bracton, l. 2. c. 17.
and l. 4. c. 1.
Briton, c. 40.
and Fleta l. 3. c. 15. and l. 4. c. 1.
in their proper places.

Of the penalty of those who are rashly Litigious.
TIT. XVI.
AMongst the Ancient Writers of our Law there may be many marks found of the
severity wherewith our Ancestors punished, those whom the Issues and ends of
their suits proved and manifested to be litigious without cause, which although
it seems to be at the present more remiss, yet is it not wholly laid aside,
for if any be found raising suits against others maliciously, they are adjudged
to bring a scandal upon the Court, and are oftentimes for their offense
committed to Prison. Bro. Ent. tit. Attomey. F. n. b 114.


1. But this is for the most part the custom at this time, that the Plaintiff,
if he be cast, is adjudged to pay unto the Defendant the Costs of his Suit, 23
H. 8. c. 15 24. H. 8. c. 8.
and the Defendant if overthrown, pays to the Plaintiff the thing in Action
with damages and costs of Suit. And although it be the constant Custom to
pronounce the party cast to be in misericordia Regis, F. n. b. f. 77. K.
yet those words as to the Plaintiff, are of no use, and as to the Defendant
only, where he betrays too much contumacy in the maintenance of such a cause,
which is manifestly unjust: but if he appear malicious, then is he to be taken
and made to pay his Fine to the King for his contumacy, yet is this Fine for
the most part very easy when he is taken. Dier s. 67. n. 19.


2. The License and Liberty appears to be very great, which our Ancestors
permitted to those who were contentious, that they might merely through envy,
and the pleasure they took in being vexatious, take men upon Writs, and force
them to put in Bail in the Kings Bench, or Mar^^alls Court, and oftentimes to
appear, and yet be unpunished, though upon their appearance they objected
nothing against them. But this is prudently remedied by an Act of Parliament,
which renders all those who procure any one to be arrested, and upon their
appearance refuse to prosecute liable to pay them their Costs and Damages. And
for that the impudence of some had gone so far, as to feign sometimes such
persons, as were not in being, in whose names they caused others to be
arrested, that Statute condemns such Delinquents to six months imprisonment
without Bail or Mainprise. 8 Eliz. c. 1. 17 R. 2. c. 6.


3. But for the suppressing the Power of such litig^ous men, whom the bare
hopes of recovering their Costs of Suit, will stir up to sue even for a trifle,
it is decreed by Act of Parliament, that whosoever should bring a Personal
Action which concerned neither Title of Lands, free Tenement, Inheritance, or
Battery in any of the Courts at Westminster, in which Action the Judges of the
Court should value both the Debt and Damages to be under forty Shillings, that
the Costs of such Suit should not be assigned greater then the principal
value. And that whereas the Sheriffs and their Deputies were wont formerly to
cite and Summon the good people of England without any warrant or Writ to the
said Courts, or to imprison their bodies, or distrain their Goods, that from
thenceforth they should not dare to attempt the like, and he that made Default
in this, or caused another to do so, should be committed to Prison without Bail
or Mainprise, until he had, besides Damages and Costs of Suit, paid ten pounds
to the party injured, and twenty pounds to the Exchequer. 43. Eliz. c. 6


4. Nor shall a man escape unpunished, for moving or beginning every Suit
rashly, for in some Cases, if the Plaintiff upon the Defendants appearance
desist, he shall pay Costs, 23 H. 8. c. 15.
as Informers upon penal Statutes, if after the Suit begun, they delay,
discontinue, or be nonsuit in the same, or have the Trial or matter pass
against them, by Verdict or Judgment of Law, they shall pay unto the Defendant
his Damages, and Costs which shall be assigned him by the Court. 18. Eliz. c.
5.


5. So also they who indict or impeach any one under the pretense of any crime,
whereby their lives, credits, or Estates are in Jeopardy, are liable to an
Action of conspiracy, 33 E. 1. Sta. 3. 3 H. 7. c. 1.
which presumes malice: whereby they shall be compelled to pay the full Damages
sustained by such accusation or eviction, F. n. b f. 115. ^.
and in some Cases they shall pay treble Damages. 8 H. 6. c. 10.


6. And I have heard from some practisers, that if any one in forma pauperis
procure a Liberty of bringing his Action in the Upper Bench, Common Pleas, or
the Chancery, according to the Statute, 11. H. 7. c. 12.
and betray rather a Spirit of Contention in the end of the Suit, then a just
cause, that such person shall have corporal punishment. 23 H. 8. c. 15.


7. But our Ancestors were wont to deterr men from their light, and rash Suits
by an Oath, for it was prohibited every one to bring any Action of Battery
before the Kings Justices, (unless it were for wounds or maims) without they
first made Oath that his Plaint was true, or an Action of Trespass for goods
taken without making Oath that the Goods taken were worth forty shillings at
the least. 6 E. 1. c. 8.


8. There are many Statutes made by the no less prudence then equity of former
Parliaments, 32 H. 8. c. 30. 18 Eliz. c. 14. 27 Eliz c. 5, and. 6. Plow. 83.
522, 523.
for the speedy deciding of Suits, which that they might be preferred before
private ends and profit, were to be wished by all good men, in regard rhey do
principally recommend the truth of causes to the Justistices, rejecting all
malicious calumnies of those who are subtle, and litigious, and amongst these
that is worthy to be numbered, by which the crafts and knavery of
under-Sheriffs, and their Officers and Bailiffes are restrained. 27 Eliz. c. 12


Of the Office and Duty of a Judge.
TIT. XVII.
OUr Kings were wont formertly at their Inauguration, or Coronation, to take an
Oath to this Effect, viz. that they would keep inviolate all the Rights and
Liberties of Holy Church, which were granted unto her by the Christian Kings of
England, That they would keep without impairing or diminution, all and singular
the Land and Dignities appertaining to the Crown, and endeavor with all their
power the restitution of such as were impaired or lost, if any were: that they
would cherish the quiet and Peace of the Church, Clergy, and people; that they
would keep and observe the ancient Laws and Customs of the Kingdom which
were received and established by the consent of the whole people, and abrogate
all such Customs and Laws which were ill and naught. And lastly, that they
would to the utmost of their power, assure Peace to the People of their
Kingdom, and procure it from others. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 9. n. 2. F. n. b
232. A. Spec. Justic. l. 1. c. 1. Flet. l. 1. c. 7.


1. The Oath of the Justices of the Superior Courts, and of the Barons of the
Eychequer, are to this effect, viz. that they will well and truly serve the
King and his People, and not consent to any thing which may tend to their
prejudice or Exheredation, that they will not take Fee, nor Robe of any man but
the King, that they will not take any gift of any one whose cause is depending
before them, except meat and drink, and that of a small value, nor any thing
for any cause, after it is tried, Brac. ib. c. 8 n. 2, 3. and n. 9, 10.
that they will not give counsel to any one in any case which concerns the
King, under the pain of being at the Kings Will, as to Body and Goods, that
they will not be deterred by the Kings Letters from doing and administering
Justice to any one. Brac. ib. c. 8 n. 2, 3. and n. 9, 10.


2. This we have even from the very beginning 2 E. 3. c. 8. 20 E. 3. c. 1. Dier
138. n. 27
unto this present, that where any one is sued in case of property of a Fee
Simple, for Lands or Tenements, it is at his choice whether he will be tried by
his country or by Battle, if he prefers to be tried by his country, the
business is determined by a Grand Assise; but if by Battle, then a day is
appointed, Glan. l. 2. c. 6. and 7. Brit. c. 42.
upon which the Case is committed to two combatants whom we call Champions,
according to the Law of single Duel, between whom it is decided by the event.
Dierf. 301. n. 40. 41. 42.


3. The ancient custom of the Nation requires also that all Trialls of private
Actions (except a few) as to matter of Fact, Plowd. 92. 114.
should be determined by a Jury of twelve free, and lawful men of the same
vicinage, who are neither allied to either Party, Dr. Stu. l. 1. c. 7.
or hindered by any just exception. Dier 144. n. 59. 176. n. 27. 177. n. 33 316
n. 3. Bro. Tit. Challenge.


4. Those who are indicted for any capital crime, or Felony before a Judge,
unless any question arise touching matter of Law, are not allowed Council.
Yet the Laws require That the Judge himself should instruct the party in all
things appertaining to the form of his defense, lest an ignorant Innocence
endanger his life. Fortesc. c. 27. Dr. Stu. l. 2. c. 84. Stamf. pleas, l. 2. c.
63.
But in case of an Appeal, he may make use of others for his defense. And if
he be so poor, that through want he is not able to procure Counsel, the Judge
ought upon his request to assign him a Patron to plead for him. Dr. Stu. ib.


5. As for the sum in which any one supposes himself to be prejudiced, by
reason of a Trespass committed against him, the Justices do proportion it
either by the verdict of a Jury, or by virtue of their own Office: Brac. l. 3.
tr. 1. c. 1.
For they do, after that the costs are taxed by a Jury, augment them upon
cause shown.

6. If the Jurors being sworn, upon their going together, cannot agree upon
their verdict, so that there be any danger, that they may perish through
hunger, (because the Common Law prohibits them from eating and drinking without
the Judges leave, until they are agreed together upon their verdict) when any
such danger appears. The Judge may permit them to eat and drink, and remit
them again to consult; And if at length they can by no means agree, he may,
having amerced them, discharge them, and appoint others in their stead. Dr.
Stu. l* 2. c. 52.


7. We have before mentioned and declared, that that Action which was called
Nox^lis Actio, is wholly unknown to us. Tit. 8. of this Book.
Since therefore there is no Judge to appeal to in this case, we need not
trouble ourselves with Observation concerning it.

8. If in a real Action, Judgment shall pass for the Tenant, the Demandant
shall only be adjudged to pay costs of Suit: But i^ it pass for the Demandant,
the Judge shall condemn him to pay Damages, and costs o^ Suit, and shall
command the Sheriff Scire facias F. n. b. in the Index throughout, and in the
Register.
(or in case it touch any Benefice then the Ordinary) F. N. B. 38.
to put the Demandant into possession, which the Sheriff is bound to do
without delay. And this is true, whether the Demandant sue as Heir, or
otherwise* and whether the Tenant were an Intruder, or not. For if he be a
Disseisor, or forceable Intruder, he is worthy rather of punishment then
favor; but if he be not, then the Jury lay little or no Damages upon him.
Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 3. and 5.


9. An Action is chiefly in case of Movables; but as concerning Movables, we
never sue for them in Specie (as I said before) but only propose the value. And
having proved the thing in Action to be Ours, and the value so much, we
recover either the thing it self, or the value. I do not find that the
Defendant can be compelled by our Law to restore the thing in Action: Yet in
the case of Lands, or an incorporeall Right, the Demandant or Tenant may
require the view of the thing, if it be out of necessity, and not to protract.
In which case the Judge commands the Sheriff; That at a day assiigned, he cause
a view to be taken by such Viewers or Surveyers, as may certify the Court at
another day touching the quantity.

10. That which the Romans called Judicium familiae eriscundae, we term
Partition of an Inheritance: But whereas they divided as well Movables as
Immovables among Heirs, we only make partition of Immoveables amongst those
whom either the Common Law or the Custom of any place intitles to an equal
part of an Inheritance. Lit. l. 3. c. 1, 2.
Now this partition is made either by the consent of the Heirs, or by the
Authority of the Magistrate. That which is by consent, may either be so made,
that the Estate being divided into equal parts, the Eldest shall have the
first choice, and so the rest in their order, or else by Lots. Id. ib. Terms of
the Law, v. Partition.
The form of that which is by the authority of the Magistrate, we find
described at large by Bracton and Littleton. Brac. l. 2. c. 33, 34. Lit. ib.
In which this is lastly to be observed; That whatsoever is assigned to one in
one place over and above their due, shall be recompensed to the other in
another place. Brac. c. 33. n. 8.


11. Those who hold jointly, whether they be Joynt-tenants, or Tenants in
Common) cannot be forced by the common Law to make Partition; yet this is
changed by an Act of Parliament: 31. H. 8. c. 1 32 H. 8. c. 32.
wherefore at this day, if Partition be made amongst these, the same rules are
to be observed, which we mentioned in case of Coheirs. See this title Sect. 9.


12. Where either, or any of those, whose Fees or Villiages border upon each
other, desire to make distinctions of their bounds, they may have a Writ
directed to the Sheriff, that he shall determine and bound their limits
equally. By the assistance of a Jury of 12. men, the most discreet of the
Vicinage sworn for this purpose: F. n. b. fol. 134.
which Partition he shall certify under his own Seal, and the Seals of four
Knights, who were present at the business at a certain day assigned. And if
either be unwilling to have their bounds limited, as being the party who
happily does commit the Injury, the other may obtain a Writ directed to the
Sheriff, to require him to set equal bounds and limits. Terms of the law, v.
perambulation. F. n. b. fol. 128.


13. Now whatsoever shall be adjudged by the Supreme power, or the Justices
upon such certificate to each, that shall immediately become theirs to whom it
is adjudged. Lit. l. 3. c. 1

TIT. XVIII.
AS for those punishments which are inflicted upon Malefactors, some extend to
the loss of life, some of a Member, others of City, Borough, or Province,
some to perpetual banishment, or for a time, some to the restraining the body,
as by perpetual imprisonment, or imprisonment for a time; some to beating,
whipping, or the Pillory: Some also to the loss of Dignity and Order, or to a
privation or prohibition of any thing. Brac. l. 3. tr. 1. c. 6. Flet. l. 1. c.

1. Amongst these, that is reckoned chief, in regard of its Heinousness, Coo.
l. 4. Beverleys case, 124.
which we call Treason. Now Treason Flet. l. 1. c. 21.
is either High or Petite: High Treason is that which the Romans called Laesa
majestas: and this [before the alteration of our Government] was dierse ways
committed, as by killing, or imagining the Death of the King, the Queen, or
their Son and Heir apparent: By ravishing Spec. Just. l. 1. c. del peche de
majeste.
the Wife, or eldest Daughter of the King [if she were unmarried] or the wife
of the Kings Son and Heir apparent. By taking up Arms against the King
within his Kingdom. Dyer, fol. 98. n. 56.
By adhering unto, or bringing supplies unto the Kings Enemies. Coo. l. 4. fo.
57.
by counterfeiting the Kings Great, or small Seal, or his Coin, or by
bringing into the Kingdom wittingly, or putting away any counterfeit Coin. By
killing the Kings Chancellor, Treasurer, the Justices of either Bench, Justices
Itenerary, or of Assize, or Justices of Oyer and Terminer, when they sit in
Judgment, or are in pursuance of their duty. 25. E. 3. c. 2.
And to these they added him who being beyond the Seas, stirred up others to
invade the Kingdom with an Army. Dyer, fol. 298. n. 29. and f. 300. n. 38.


2. Furthermore, those who by force or fear did so restrain the Kings power,
that he could not exercise his Kingly Authority, or enjoy his Prerogative, were
by the opinions and Judgment of the Justices and other learned Lawyers,
adjudged guilty of Treason. 21. R. 2. in certain questions and answ. in that
Parliament.


3. They were also deemed guilty of this crime, who counterfeited the Kings
Seal Manual, Signet, or private Seal: Or who did counterfeit, wash, or clip
any Foreign Coin which was current in this Kingdom. 5 Eliz. c. 11. and 14.
Eliz. c. 3 18 Eliz. c. 1. 3 H. 5. c. 5. Flet. l. 1. c. 22.
They who did either by writing, word, or Act assert the Authority or
Jurisdiction of any Foreign Prince, Prelate, or Estate, in Causes Spiritual
within this Kingdom, or within any of the Kings Dominions: 1 Eliz. c. 1.
Those who denied the Oath of Supremacy upon the second tender 5 Eliz. c. 1.


4. Those also were formerly included under this crime, who detained any Castle
of this Kingdom, or any other of the Kings Realms forceably, any Tower, Fort,
Fortress, great Guns, or any Warlike Ammunition, and did not deliver them
within six days after by Proclamation, being required. Those who did
voluntarily burn any of the Kings Ships, or cause them to be burnt or
destroyed: Or did obstruct any Port or Haven belonging to his Dominions, or
cause them to be obstructed or stopped; or did ^bet, or counsel any other
person offending in the premises. 14 Eliz. c. 1
Those who did endeavor to rescue or release any one w^o was committed to
custody, or prison, for Treason against the Kings person, after having been
convicted; Or did divulge, or make public such endeavor by word or deed. 14.
Eliz. c. 2
But these dyed with Queen El^zabeth.

5. To these may be added those who did draw, entice, or persuade any of the
Kings Subjects, or any persons within the Kings Dominions from their natural
Obedience to the King: Or from the Religion established: Or did absolve them by
virtue, or under pretense of any Bull: And being absolved, did reconcile them
to the Religion or Sea of Rome. Or those who being reconciled to the Sea
aforesaid did promise Obedience to that, or any other power. 23 Eliz. c. 1. 13
Eliz. c. 2.
Those also who being Subjects of these Realms, took upon them the Orders of
Priests, Deacons; or Jesuits beyond the Seas, by authority derived from the
Pope, or entered into any other Religious Order, and returned into any of the
Kings Dominions: Or being Laymen, and brought up in any of the Jesuits
Colleges beyond the Seas, from the 5. year of Queen Elizabeth, did not return
home by a day prefixed, and giving in their names to the Diocesan of the place
where they lived, or to two Justices of the Peace, did not submit themselves to
Her Majesty, and take the Oath of Supremacy. 27 Eliz. c. 2.


6. He also is guilty of Treason, who finding another falling into the crime,
encourages him, or assisteth him with help or Council; Stan. Pleas, Crown, l.
1. c. 44.
For in case of High Treason are principalls. Id. ib. yet see 23. Eliz. c. 1.


7. But he that is only conscious and pri^y, not any ways assisting the
Traitors, he is not guilty of High Treason, but only of misprision of Treason,
for concealing the Traitors. 1 and 2 Ph. and Mar. c. 10. 5 and 6 Ed. 6. c. 11.
1 Ed. 6. c. 12. 23 Eliz. c. 1. 1 Eliz. c. 6.
He that privately coins monyes not current in this Kingdom, incurs the
penalty of Misprision of Treason, 14 Eliz. c. 3
which is also to be understood of those who did either release, or endeavor
to release them that were committed for Treason against the person of the King,
or for suspicion of such Treason, out of Prison or Custody. 14 Eliz. c. 2.
As also of those who take the Kings Great Seal affixed to Letters Patents, and
affixe them to others. Terms of the Law, v. misprision.


8. He that is condemned of Treason, forfeits all which he has, as well Lands
[and those notwithstanding that they be entailed] 26 H. 8. c. 13.
as Chattels and Rights Plow. 381 391. 33 H. 8. c. 20.
to the Exchequer, and to the Supreme Power for the most part. 18 Eliz. c. 1. 5
Eliz c. 1.
And being laid upon a Sledg in straw, he is drawn by a Horse to the place of
Execution: where, when he comes, he is hanged up by the neck, and let down
again to the ground alive: Then is his head cut off by the public
Executioner, his Privities b^ing first cut off, which together with his
Entralls and Heart are cast into a Fire, and his Trunck cut into four parts.
Flet. l. 1. c. 16.
Yet in some cases, They are only drawn and hanged until they be dead. Dyer,
fol. 230. n. 55.
And so far is the very memory of a Traitor condemned, that not only his
Head, and the other parts of his Trunck are publicly fixed upon stakes,
until they be devowred by Fowls, or rot and p^trifie. But even their Issue [if
they have any] are in most cases despoiled of their Nobility, and deprived of
all Privileges and Prerogatives due unto their Father. Ful^. para. seigno^ies,
fol. 26. 27. Plowd. 391.
Now Women who are convict of Treason, are bound to a stake, and burned. Flet.
l. 1. c. 22.


9. Misprision of Treason is punished with the confiscation of all their
Chattels, the loss of the profits of all his Lands during life, and the
Imprisonment of his body during the pleasure of the Supreme Power. Terms of the
Law, v. misprision.


10. Petit Treason is, where any does maliciously kill a Subject, under whose
power and subjection the party is, as a Wife her Husband, Dyer, 253. n. 103.
and fol. 333. n. 25.
a Religious person his Prelate, a Son his Father or Mother, according to the
opinion of some, though others contradict it, Lam. 248.
a Servant his Master or Mistriffe. Id. 240. Cromp. 18. Plow. 260. Dyer, 128.
n. 57 12 H. 7. c. 7.
To these Antiqiuty has added others, viz. not only those who killed their
Kinsmen, but even those also, who did by any capital deceit, plot any thing
against their Estates, Members, or Honors. As also those Servants who
committed any such crime against their Mastes: Or who lay with their Masters
Wives, Daughters, or Concubines, or counterfeited their Seals. Flet. l. 1. c.
37. Spec. Just. l. 2.
Now the punishment due to this crime, is, to be drawn from the Prison to the
place of Execution, and there to be hanged by the neck until they be dead;
Cromp. Just. fol. 18. Flet. l. 1. c. 37.
but a woman is punished for this in the case of High Treason. Their goods also
are forfeited to the Exchequer, and their Lands to the Lord of the Manor, yet
so as the King was wont to have a year and a day, and waste. Stanf. l. 1. 6. 2.


11. The residue of Capital Crimes are comprehended under that one name of
Felony. Although Felony in a more large signification includes Treason, Lamb.
l. 2. c. 7. Plow. 333.
and is sometimes more strictly extended to Murder. Perk. 349. 22 H. 8. c. 14.


12. Of Felonies, there are some which are against the Commonwealth, and some
which are against private persons principally, though by consequence they also
are against the Commonwealth. O^ the first sort are raising of Devils,
Witchcraft, Conjuring, by which any one is killed: Or any other whatsoever
after the first conviction, by means whereof the body of any party lies sick
and languishing, and these formerly went under the name of Felony. 5 Eliz. c.
16.
But at this day, those who use Invocations, Conjurations, or raising of
Devils: or who take counsel of Evil Spirits, make any bargain with them, or
deal with them by way of Commerce: Or who do any way command, cherish, or
reward them for any end or purpose. Those who dig up any dead body out of a
Grave, or Dormitory, or who draws off the skin or the bone of any dead body,
to use them in Enchantments. Lastly, those who practice any manner of
enchantment, charm, or sorcery, whereby any person shall be killed, destroyed,
wasted, consumed, pined, or lamed, That such Offenders, their Aiders, Abettors,
and Counselors, shall suffer pains of Death as Felons, without benefit of
Clergy. And it is further provided for the utter extirpation of such wicked
Blasphemy; that whosoever shall take upon them by Witchcraft, Enchantment,
Charm, or Sorcery, to tell or declare in what place any Treasure of Gold or
Silver may be found, or lies hid: Or to provoke any person to unlawful love:
Or to destroy and waste any ones Cattle or Goods or to destroy or hurt any
ones person, although the same be not effected or done, every such offender
shall suffer a year Imprisonment without Bail or Mainprise, and once in every
quarter of the said year, shall in some market town stand openly upon the
Pillory for the space of six hours, and there openly confess their error.
But if being once convicted, they do again commit the offense, they shall
suffer death without benefit of Clergy. 1. Jam. c. 12


13. And hither we may aptly refer, that Sodomiticall sin with bruit beasts,
25. H. 8. c. 16
the entertaining of Jesuits and Priests brought up in the Seminaries beyond
the Sea, 27. Eliz. c. 2.
the sefusing of Abjuration by Papists, and their return into England, after
having abjured, 35. Eliz. c. 1. 2.
the assembling of Rebels, 1. Mar. c. 12. which Statute is now expired
the art of multiplying Gold or Silver, 5. H. 4. c. 4.
the procuring or causing of Congregations of Masons to be assembled, 3, H. 6.

the breaking or cutting of the banks in Marshland, 2. and 3. Phil. and Mar.
c. 19.


14. And like unto these seem those Felonies which spring from breaking of
Prisons, as where one is imprisoned for Felony, or for suspicion of Felony, and
breaks ^orth; as also where a Jailer lets such a person forth freely which we
call a voluntary escape: Or lastly, the assistance and help in a third person,
which we call Rescous, Lamb. l. 2. c. 7. p. 224. 226. Dier, fo. 90. n. 60. fo.
165. n. 60.
the making, bringing into the Kingdom, or selling that kind of Money which
our Ancestors called Galley Halfe-pence, Su^kins, Dotkins, and Blanks, 3. H. 5.
c. 1.
the Imbecilling of a Record, 8. H. 6. c. 12.
the violent oppressing the Subject by the Kings Purveiours or others, 4. E. 3.

the compelling of any Prisoner by the Jailer, by duress of Imprisonment and
pain to become an Appellor against his will, 14. E. 3. c. 10.
and thus much of the first sort of Felonies.

15. Felonies which do primarily and chiefly concern private persons, are such
as reflect to the hurt and prejudice of the Body only, or the Body and Goods,
or the Goods only. Lamb. l. 2. c. 7. fo. 218.
Those which hurt the Body, are such which either take away life, or bring some
other enormous injury upon it, though not mortal; those which take away life,
are comprehended under the general name of Homicide, Flet. l. 1. c. 23.
but this has diverse appellations and causes from the diverse Intents of the
parties offending. For that which is committed through malice prepensed, is
called murder, Plow. 474. Glan. l. 11. c. 3. ^rac. l. 3. tr. 2. c. 4, n. 2.
Dier, (...) 69. n. 28. and ^9. fo. 186. n. 3
and is punished with death. And we are to take notice here, of the ancient
custom which our Ancestors used, that he who committed Murder was hanged up
alive by his whole Body upon a Gibber, and was not upon any condition to be let
down until he died through Hunger, but I read nothing of this: and if there
were any such custom it is long time changed: For at this day they, as other
Felons, are strangled with a Halter, and in this only they differ from other
Felons, that their Bodies are hanged up on high in some public Road, near the
place where the fact was committed, as an object to those which pass by, and
are not to be removed until they be consumed. Now there are others who show
more at large how and by what ways murder may be committed. Stan. Pleas Crow.
l. 1. c. 10. Lamb. l. 2. c. 7. fo. 230.


16. And it is murder also where any one kills himself. For such a person is
called, Felo de se: In which case Christian Burial is. forbidden and all the
parties Go ds and Chattells are forfeited to the supreme power, to be disposed
of to pious uses, Brac. l. 3. tr. 1 c. 31. P^ow. fo. 253.
yet some there are, who distinguish, whether the party laid violent hands upon
himself through fear of Judgment, or being weary of his life, or through the
violence of some disease: For in the first case, as other Felons, he loses
both his Land and Chattels, in the second, his Chattells only, and in the third
he forfeiteth nothing. Flet. l. 1. c. 36


17. That which is committed through sudden passion and Anger, is called
simple, Glan. l. 14. c. 3.
Homicide or manslaughter, and it is punishable with death also; yet such is
the commiseration of humane weakness with us, or the pious instigation to
learning, that he, who is convict of this Crime the first time, if he can read
perfectly, and distinctly, as a Clarke ought to do, is freed from death, and
(his lands and goods being forfeited) is only burnt in the hand; by which means
he may be known if he commit the like crime again, and committing it the second
time, he is to die without mercy, 18. Eliz, ^, 7:
but so great has been the bloody wickedness of these times, that this Law
has been somewhat more exasperated. For now by an Act of Parliament in K.
James his time it is decreed, that he who stabs another who has never a Weapon
drawn, or who does not provoke him by stricking first, shall loose the benefit
of Clergy, although there do no precedent malice appear, if the party die within
six Months, unless it be done in his own defense, or for the necessary
conservation of the public place, 1. Ja. c. 8.
now this favor of Clergy is not only granted to these, but even to all other
Felons, unless where it is denied by some particular Act of Parliament, 23. H.
8. c. 1. 25. H. 8. c, 3, 26, H. 8. c. 12.
the other kinds of Homicide are not accounted Felony. Lamb. l. 2. c. 7. fo.
248.


18. For every Homicide which is without malice is either necessary or casual,
West, Simbol, part. 2. fo: 48 49:
that which is necessary is likewise double, one which cannot be declined
without prejudice to public Justice, the other which cannot be avoided without
the death of the innocent, an example of the first sort may be given in the
case of killing a Robber or Theife, who cannot otherwise be apprehended, and of
the later, in case where one kills another in his own defense, the former is
free from all manner of punishment, Stanf, l, 1, c, 5,
the later not simply, for it is material, that the party who is slain set
upon the party that kills him in his own House, or near the Ordinary highway,
with a malicious intention to kill or rob him, or in case that he be moved with
sudden passion, and pursues the party defending himself with an intention to
fight with him, so far until he can fly no further, for in the one case he
kills him without incurring any punishment at all, 11, E: 1, 1, Mar, c, 12,
Stan, l, 1, c, 6, 7
but in the other case, he loses his Goods, 6 E, 1, c, 9:
nor is he received and taken into grace without the express pleasure and
Indulgency of the supreme power, (which notwithstanding is granted and obtained
of course.)

19. Casual Homicide is double likewise, one which is merely through
misfortune, the other which is mixed also with some fault in the party who
kills the other. That often happens in the Lawful prosecution of a lawful
Act, and often from a bruit or an inanimate thing. Of the first kind, is,
where any one is killed, with the fall of an Arm or Lopp of a Tree, or a Tile
from a House, after warning given by the parties who are either lopping or
tiling, West: Simbol: part, 2: Sec: 50, tit, Indictments
to which also may be added, that which may happen in Justs and Tournements, in
regard the parties who are there in Action are supposed to be making trialls of
their strength in the way of freindship. And therefore K. Henry the second
ordained, that those should be pardoned thereby giving them to understand how
much they were obliged to perform for the Kings sake when required. Spec,
Justic, l: 1: c: Del Office, del Coroner:
Of the second fort is, where any are suddenly drowned in falling from a Ship,
Boat, or Bridge, or slain with a Cart, Mill, or the like. In whch Cases we have
before related what our Law determines. Fleta. l. 1. c. 25.


20. Homicide, which is mixed with some fault of the party who kills the other,
and yet is casual or accidental, is, where one that is lopping of a Tree, or
tiling of an house, happens to kill another with a Lop or Tile, not having
given any warning, Stanf. Pleas Crown. l. 1. c. 8.
of which kind others draw many examples. Flet. l. 1. c. 31. 26 H. 8. c. 16. 5
Eliz. c. 17.


21. Felonies which are committed upon the Body, and yet deprive it not of
life, is where any one out of malice cuts out the tongue, either of a man or
beast, or pulls out the eyes of any Subject, 25 H. 8. c. 6. 5 Eliz. c. 17.
or commits the horrible and abominable sin of Sodomy with a man, Fleta l. 1.
c. 37.
(but those who committed any kind of Sodomy were used to be buried alive in the
Earth 3 H. 7. c. 2. Lamb. l. 2. c. 7.
(or having stolen away a Widow, Wife, or Virgin, who has an Estate in Lands or
Tenements, or who has goods, or Chattells, or who is Heir apparent to her
Ancestor, and marries her being so stolen away against her will, or commits a
Rape upon her; or he who assists Lamb. ib. 18 Eliz. c. 7.
any one in the committing of such crime. He also where any one has the
ca^nall knowledge of any woman who is under the age of ten years old whether it
be with her Will and consent or without: 12. H. 4. c. 13. Stanf. l. 1. c. 14.
Glan. l. 14 c. 6.
or lastly, where any one commits a Rape upon any woman whatsoever; to these we
may also add him who marries a second Wife in the life time of his first. 1
Jac. c. 11
Now that Felony seems to be of a mixed nature which is committed by him, who
having any deadly infectious disease by reason of which he is prohibited by the
Law to go out of his house, does notwithanding go aabroad, and trade, and
converse with others. 1 Jac. c. 21


22. Felonies which are committed both against body and Goods, are Piracies,
Burglaries, Robberies of houses, or Castles, Burning of Houses, and Robbery.
Now by Piracies we do not only mean Piraticall robbing upon the Sea, but all
manner of Felonies upon the Sea, or within the Jurisdiction of the High Court
of Admiralty. Burglary is a violent and forcible breaking into 27 H. 8. c. 4 28
H. 8. c. 5.
a House, either private or Sacred, (as into a Church) in the night time, with
an intention to kill, steal, or commit any Felony within the said place; West.

but how far this is extended we are to inquipe of others. Stanf l. 1. c. 24.
Lamb. fol. 254. Fulb. fo. 104. Coo. l. 4. Cases of Ap. peals, f. 40.


23. Now that which we of our Nation call House-robbing, I do not find
eypressed by our Civilians, but it signifies a breaking, or entering into
another house or dwelling place in the day time, and a taking away of Goods,
whilst there is some Body present in the House. 5 E. 6. c. 9. 39 Eliz. c. 15.
Lamb. fo. 260. Flet. l. 1. c. 37.


24. House-burning does not only extend to Houses and Barnes wherein Corn is
laid up; but also to those heaps which we call Mowes, Stacks, or Reeks, if they
be near unto Houses, and burnt though malice. Lamb. l. 2. c 7. fo. 269. 270
Fulb. fo. 109.


25. Robbery is the taking away of goods from any ones person, or o^ least the
person who is owner of them, being present and not assenting. Now this is
sometimes violent, and accompanied with terror, as when any man is robbed by
theives on the high way, by which his life is in danger: Dier 224. n. 3.
and sometimes secret and Clandestine, as when a man's Purse is cut or stolen
away against his privity, having in it twelve pence in moneys: Lamb. fo. 262,
263, 264, 265, 266.
some also affirm it to be Robbery where a man's Wife is taken or enticed away
with her Husbands Goods. Fleta l. 1. c. 39.


26. Amongst those Felonies which relate to Goods only, that methinks deserves
to be reckoned first, which we call forging of Deeds, being committed the
second time, for he who having been once convict of this crime, and is again
found guilty, either of malicious forging, or causing and procuring others to
forge Deeds, or knowingly to allege or plead them in Judgment, whereby any
one is prejudiced, or hurt in his Title to Lands or Goods, is declared guilty
of Felony, this being Felony by the Statute. 5 Eliz. c. 14


27. That which is Felony by the Common Law, and relates to the Goods only, is
termed Larceny, and is a fraudulent taking away of Goods moveable or personal,
in the absence and against the will of the owner, Lamb. 262 west. part. 4. tit.
Indi^tments Sec. 61.
of which those Servants are as much guilty, who take away the Goods of their
Masters who are dead, from the Executors, and are not reclaimed or drawn to
restore them after Proclamation made, 33 H. 6. c. 1.
as those who carry away Goods committed to their Custody by their masters to
the value of forty Shillings, unless they be under the age of eighteen years.
21 H. 8. c. 7 5 Dliz. c, 10. 27 H. 8. c. 17. 28 H. 8. c. 4.


28. But Larceny is either Grand or petty; Grand is where the Goods stolen
exceed the value of twelve pence, Petit, where they amount not to that value,
and therefore this is not by some called a Felony. Lamb. 267. Fulb. 101. Flet.
l. 1. c. 38.
The former is Capital; the latter punishable, only by whipping and
imprisonment.

29. By what ways, and how Larceny is committed were material to understand,
wherefore know that under those Goods, by the taking of which Larceny is
committed, are comprehended, moneys numbered, Vessels of Silver, Garments and
Clothes, meat, (unless where the Party that takes it, does it through
necessity, either to save his own life, or his Neighbors) all sorts of Grain,
Hay, fruit, separated from the ground, Horses, or Mares of any age, Oxen, Cows,
Sheep, Lambs, Hogs, Pigs, Hens, Ducks, Peacocks, Turkies, or other tame fowls:
and some things also which are wild, as young Pigeons which are in a
Dove-house, and cannot as yet fly, Hawks from their nests, and Fishes from a
Pool, or other place which is made to keep them in. Lamb. 269* 170. Stan. l. 1.
c. 15, 16.


30. Nor is he only guilty of Felony who takes a Dear which he knows to be
tame, but he also who takes Dear or Conies out of a Park or Warren in the
night, or he who hunts them either disguised or armed, if being apprehended and
examined, he denic the Fact. Lamb. fo. 271.
Lastly, he who shears Wool from the backs of Sheep, or flaies off the
skins, leaving their carcasses behind them, Id. 299.
or takes Apples or any other fruit separated from the Trees, or takes a Tree,
which either himself or another cut down from the Owner, with an intention to
steal it, is guilty of Felony. Id. 273.


31. A man may also commit Felony and theft upon that which is his own; as
where I lend Vessels of Gold, etc. to another, and fraudulently steal them
from him again, Lamb. l. 2. c. 7. fo. 280. Stanf. l. 1. c. 17. Fleta l. 1. c.
17.
or if I receive my own Goods which were stolen, without the Authority of the
Magistrate, Flet. l. 1 c. 27.
and being bribed, forbear to prosecute. Id. ^b.


32. In Felony, Lamb. l. 1. c. 43. Plow. fo. 475.
there are also sometimes some besides the principalls whom we call
accessories, no less guilty of Felony then the principalls, and those not
only by the Common Law, but by the Statutes also. Stanf. l. 1. c. 47.
Now there is a double kind of accessory, one before the Fact, the other after
accessory. Before the fact is, where any one commands or incites another to
commit a Felonious Act, which he does afterward perform: and this albeit, that
the party who so incites be not present at the Fact committed, Spec. Justic. l.
1. c. del Office del Coroner, where he makes nine sorts of accessories.
and the circumstances which in this Case render a Principal or an Accessory
only, Our Lawyers do with a great deal of Art and Judgment demonstrate.
Stanf. l 1. c. 43. Dier fol. 108 n. 57.
Accessory after the Fact, is, where any one wittingly, or ignorantly Dier fo.
355 n. 36.
receives, cherishes, assisteth, and comfort a Felon; Stanf. l. 1. c. 46.
or who receives stolen goods to keep them, or to dispose of them, together with
the Theife. Fulb. par. Theft, fo. 202. Lamb. fo. 295.
But a Wife who in this case conceales the secret of her Hushand is exculable
through the necessity of her Duty, Stanf. l. 1. c. 46.
which is also true, in case she commit the Fact upon his command. Id. ib. c.
19.
And there are also Accessories of Accessories, as where any one does wittingly
receive the Accessory of an Accessory. Id. ib.


33. The punishment due to Felons both principalls as Accessories, is to hang
by the neck until they dye, and to forfeit their Goods and Lands, if they have
any: 24 H. 8. c. 45 Coo. l. 4. Beverleys case, 124.
Only here is the difference; That the Accessory cannot be punished before the
Principal be convict and Attaint. Stanf. l. 1. c. 43. Plow. 97. Dye^, fol.
120. n. 10.
Now the Lands escheat to the Lord of the Manor, who notwithstanding was
formerly compelled to expect, until the King had received his year and his
day, and waste, unless the King himself ^ere Lord. Stanf. l. 3. c. 3. Flet.
l. 1. c. 28.
Moreover the Issue of Felons is so infected, that they are excluded from all
hope or possibility of succeeding in the Inheritances of their Ancestors, which
otherwise should have descended to them, unless there be any thing more
favorably enacted in case of any particular crime, contrary to the common and
ordinary form. 1 Mar. c. 14 1 Jam. c. 11, 12.


34. But these things which we have spoken concerning the punishments of
Treasons and Felonies, must have their distinctions, and therefore it were
requisite to explain them Now the way of impeaching any of these crimes is
double; one by Appeal, Stanf. l. 2. c. 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59.
the other by Indictment at the suite of the Supreme Power. Id. c. 59.
If they proceed by way of Appeal, and that it be an Accuser, who takes upon
him the proof of the crime, it is at the election of the Defendant (unless
he will confess the fact) to wage his Battle with the Appellor, or to be
tried by his Country. Or (in case he were a Peer of the Realm) to be tried by a
Verdict of his Peers, or Pares. Id. l. 3. c. 1. Flet. 1. c. 21. 31, 32.
But if he be indicted, he is left solely to the trial of his Country, or
Peers. And if in either case he be convict, he is punished with Death.

35. But it sometimes happens that the party accused through contumacy,
refuses to be tried either way, but either stands mute, or pleads not so: As
by his answer Issue may be joined to come to Trial. In which cases, if it be
by Appeal, he is immediately adjudged to dye. Dyer, 441. n. 49.
If by Indictment, then is it taken Pro Confesso, in case of Treason. And in
cases of Felony, he shall be impressed, viz he shall be committed to the Prison
from whence he was brought, where he shall be carried into some low dark
place, and being stripped naked, he shall be laid upon the bare ground, his
Pud^nd^e only covered, and his Arms and Legs pulled out by four ropes, fastened
to the four corners of the room, he shall be stretched out upon his back: Then
being bound in this manner, he shall have so great a weight of Iron or Stone
laid upon his Breast as he is able to bear, without confusion. The day
following he shall have 3. crusts of barley bread without drink; next day to
that he shall have three draughts of the water next to the Prison, (povided it
be not running water) but without Bread: And so by turns he shall be fed with
bread or water every day until he dye through the extremities of weight,
hunger, and cold. Flet. l. 1. c. 32. Stanf. l. 2. c. 60. Dyer. 241. n. 49.


36. Now a Woman who is condemned for any the aforesaid Crimes, if she be with
Child, has the Execution of Judgment deferred until she be delivered of her
Infant. Flet. l. 1. c. 38.


37. There is also a misprision of Felony; As in case any one knows another to
have committed Felony, and does not discover it unto the Supreme Power, or to a
Magistrate. Terms of the Law, v. misprision, Cromp. fol. 39.
Now the punishment for this crime, is, That the party shall be committed to
prison, until he have put in Security for the payment of such a Fine as the
Judges shall impose upon him before whom he is convened. Id. ib.
And it is to be observed; That in all Treasons and Felonies, there is a
misprision of Treason or Felony comprehended. And therefore it is in the power
of the Supreme Power (if in its clemency it thinks good so to do) to suppose
him guilty of misprision only, who really is guilty of a greater crime. Id. ib.


38. Next to these which are capital, are those crimes which used to be
punished with perpetual Exile and Banishment: As those persons, who having
committed Treason or Felony, and taken Sanctuary, were accustomed, having
confessed their crime before the Coroner, to abjure the Realm, and thereby avoid
a greater punishment; Stanf. l. 2. c. 38, 39. Terms of the Law, v. Abiuration.
but this is long since altered. 21 H. 8. c. 2. 22 H. 8. cap. 14. 33 H. c. 12.
And indeed there are few Facts at this day subject to this, and many even of
those are not so high: as he who kills Dear, and cannot find security to put
in for the payment of the Fine imposed, is compelled to abjure the
Commonwealth, Charta de Forest. c. 10. Dier, fol. 238. n. 34.
which also he is bound to do who marries a Woman-Heir, having stolen her
out of the custody of her Guardian, and is not able to satisfy for the value
of her Marriage. 13 E. 1 c. 45.
So also he who accepts of a Benefice, being elected by the Pope, 13. R. 2.
Stat. 2. c. 2.
And lastly, a Papist who refuses to come to Church according to Act of
Parliament. 35 Eliz. c. 1.


39. Our Statutes also inflict a great penalty upon those who sue or implead
any one in a Foreign Realm, when the Action belongs properly to the Cognizance
of our Courts, or where Judgment has in the same case been given by the
Justices here. As likewise upon those, who by prosecuting a Plaint in another
Court, endeavor to retard or impeach Judgment given in the Supreme Courts of
our Supreme Power. For such Offenders being summoned by distress, either upon
the Lands in question, or upon any other of their Lands, to be made by the
Sheriff to appear personally in the Chancery, or in either Bench, or before
Justices particularly for that purpose deputed to answer such contempt if they
appear not. Then are they, their Procurators, Attorneys, Executors, Notaries,
and Summoners deprived of protection, their Lands, Goods, and Chattels
forfeited to the Supreme Power, and their Bodies wheresoever found and taken,
kept in Prison until they have paid a Fine to be imposed upon them at the will
and pleasure of the Supreme Power. 27 E. 3. c. 1. Bro. tit. Praemanire. 10.


40. Those also are liable to this, who seek for any presentations to
Churches, Prebendaries, or other Ecclesiastical Benefices from Rome: Or who
seek and obtain any Process concerning the premises, any Excommucations,
Bulls, or other Instruments from thence. Nor they only, but their Procurers,
Executors, Notaries, Summoners, Promoters, and Assisters. 13 R. 2. c. 2.
So also those who procure any Provisions from the Pope, by which they become
absolved from their Obedience, or obtain any Office in any Religious House,
etc. 2 H. 4. c. 3.
As Archbishops, Bishops, Abbors, who paid a greater sum then usual to the
Pope for their Benefices, 6 H. 4. c. 1.
together with those Rectors and Vicars under the Jurisdiction of the
Archdeacon of Richmond, who impose too great exactions upon the Subject. 26 H.
8.


41. To which we may add, those who defend or promote any Authority or
Jurisdiction of the Pope (which he shall claim in ENGLAND) either by word,
writing, or Act: Or those who shall assist, help, or comfort any manner of way
any person or persons who shall defend or promote the same. 5 Eliz. c. 1. 28 H.
8. c. 10. 1 Eliz. c. 1.
Those who entertain or assist any who shall bring any Bulls, Writings, or
Instruments of Absolution or Reconciliation from the Sea of ROME, or from any
person exercising the Authority of the said Sea: Or who shall under such color
absolve or reconcile any person, or who shall accept of any such Absolution.
Lastly, those who shall bring over from the Pope or See of ROME, or from any
one claiming his Authority, any Agnus Dei, Crosses, Pictures, Beads, etc. and
shall deliver them to any Subject here, or procure them to be delivered or
offered, to the end that they should make use of them. And those also who shall
receive any such thing being offered, and not apprehend the person offering
them, or not deliver him to the Ordinary, or some Justice of Peace within three
days, together with the thing so received. 13 Eliz. c. 2.


42. They also come under the same notion, who being compellable, refuse the
Oath of Supremacy, being lawfully tendered. 1 Eliz. c. 1. 5 Eliz. c. 1.
Or who do directly, or indirectly give any money, or sustenance, or any other
thing to any Jusuite or Priest remaining in any Seminary, or to any other
Priest, Deacon, Religious, or Ecclesiastical person, or to the maintenance of
any of their Seminaries or Colleges beyond the Seas. 27 Eliz. c. 2.


43. And lastly, Those who take or procure for Usurers by way of Usury, though
under the notion of any Sale or Contract, above a tenth per annum. 19 Eliz. c.
8.
But some of our Lawyers through gain or ambition, have too violently extended
this strict punishment, by stretching the words of one Statute 16 R. 2. c. 5.
which are meant in the generality, to every light offense of Judges
[especially Ecclesiasticall] Cromp. fo. 52
to whom I shall only say: That that Candor of some were to be desired, and
that Ignorance of others lamented, which a very learned Man did lately most
accurately persuade and refute. Cosmus, part 3. c. 7 fol. 85.


44. Those Crimes which are punished with the loss of Protection are not to
be esteemed light. Now they incur this, who being five times lawfully summoned
in a full County, do not give their appearance to a personal Action or an
Indictment, 13 E. 1. c. 35 31 Eliz. cap. 3.
for they are pronounced Utlawed: And if it be a civil Action, they forfeit
all their Goods and Chattels, with the profits naturally arising from their
Lands. Bro. forfeitures, 30.
And if it be criminal, then they forfeit all their Lands and Tenements also
to the public Exchequer for ever, Terms of the Law, v. Utlawry.
and are ipso facto, deprived of the benefit of all Laws, and of the
privileges of Subjects, so that according to the Ancients any one might kill
them unpunished. Brac. l. 3. tr. 2. c. 11.
But this Law being altered, 5 Eliz. c. 1.
they are now referred to a pecuniary Fine. Those also are liable to this
punishment, who remove, or throw down the Sea-marks, by which Mariners are
secured from wandering, and directed to their Port, if the Offenders be not
worth a hundred pound, whereby they may with moneys satisfy for their
oftence. 8 Eliz. c. 13.


45. Perjury committed by any person who was of a Jury in any Court, was so
odious to our Ancestors, that it was decreed, that all such Offenders should
have their Meadows and Gardens dug up, their Houses pulled down, their
Woods extirpated and grub'd up, and all their Lands confiscate. Terms, v.
Altaint.
And moreover (according to some) they were io be committed to Prison, and for
ever rendered so infamous, that they were deprived of the benefit of the Laws,
and their Testimonies never to be admitted in any Cause. Fleta:


46. Those who committed perjury in any Court were fined twenty pound, and
suffered six months imprisonment without Bail or Maine prize, and made
incapable for ever after of bearing Witness in any Court of Record.

And if any person did procure or suborn another to commit perjury in any
Court, he is to be fined forty pound: And if he have not so much in Goods and
Chattells, he is then to suffer six months imprisonment without Bale, and to
stand in the Pillory in the same Town, or in some other in open Market for the
space of an hour, and furthermore is made incapable for ever of bearing
Witness in any Court of Record. 5 Eliz. c. 9
But perjury was wont frequently to be punished with en extraordinary Censure
in that Honorable Assembly of Peers in the Starr-Chamber. Dyer, fol. 242. n.
53.


47. Next to this are those Crimes which were punished with dis-membring, or
Mutilation of the Body: As the cutting off the hand 33 H. 8. 6. 12.
of him who presumed to strike another within the Verge of the Court of the
Supreme Power. The loss of his Ear, who maliciously struck another with a
Weapon in a Church or Churchyard, or who presumed to draw a Weapon for that
end. 5 E. 6. c. 4.
And if the person so offending happened to want his Ears, then was he bu^nt
with a hot Iron in the Cheek. But this punishment was sometimes joined with
another; for those who did either bring, send, or receive, or procure others to
bring, send, or receive any Sheep or Lambs alive into a Ship, to conveigh
them beyond the Seas, had their Goods confiscate, and lost also their left
Hands for the first Offense. 5 Eliz. c. 3.
And sometimes this Punishment was inflicted for want of Goods, and Chattells
to satisfy a Pecuniary Mulct. As those, Butchers, Brewers, Bakers, Poulterers,
Cooks, Coster-mongers, or Fruiterers, who conspire not to sell their Victuals,
but at a certain Rate agreed amongst themselves, or oblige themselves to it by
Oath or Promise made amongst themselves, and have not forty pounds to pay for
such Offense, they are to be punished with the loss of one Ear, and are for
ever rendered infamous in the Eye of the Law, to which Punishment those
Mechanics, and Laborers are Subject, who agree amongst themselves not to sell
their Wares, but at such a Rate which they set amongst themselves, or not to
work, but at appointed times, or not to exceeed so much work in a Day, or not
to finish a Work which another has begun. (u) (^) 2 E. c. 15.


Now, those who disperse false Rumors against Peers, either by word or
writing, to their prejudice, may in some sort be reckoned amongst private
offenders, for that they may be committed to Prison, until they produce those
whom they pretend to be the first Authors of such Rumors, nor shall they escape
public Justice. But without doubt, those who maliciously do commit any such
offense against the Supreme Power, are to be punished by the Magistrate. See
the Statutes cited l. 3. title injur.


49. Now of this rank also are those, who maliciously forge, or cause and
procure others to forge any Instrument or Writing to overthrow oh call in
question any ones Freehold or Inheritance, or to subvert any ones Right to a
Fee or Copyhold: or do wittingly plead or produce in Trial any such
Instrument to any such end, for such offenders shall forfeit treble Damages and
Costs totthe Party grieved, and shall be adjudged to have an ear cut off,
standing in the Pillory, as also to have their noses slit, and to be
stigmatized as an eternal mark of such falsehood and Villainy: and lastly they
shall forfeit the Revenues of their Lands for life, and suffer Imprisonment for
ever: but they who forge, or procure any one to forge any such Deed, orplead
ill to overthrow or question the Right which another has to Lands for Term of
life, or an Annuity, or who forge, or cause othets to forge any Obligation,
Acquittance, or a Release, or any other such like personal writing, out of
malice, shall pay to the party grieved double Costs and Damages, and shall also
stand in the Pllory, loose one Ear, and suffer a years imprisonment without
Bail or mainprise. 5 Eliz. c. 14. Dier, 288. n. 52. 322. n. 26
next to which are those who cheat any one of money, by forged, and counterfeit
Writings, the punishment of which is arbitrary: as are also many other
offenses, which many of our Authors mention. 33. H. 8. c. 1.


50. Nor can I here omit those Assemblies against the public Peace, which are
called Routs, Riots, and unlawful Assemblies: but as for the Differences,
Definitions, and Distinctions of them, shall, (for brevities sake) refer you to
others. Dier, fo. 188 n. 10.


51. To which I may add the Extortions of under-Sheristes, and their Officers.
Now Extortion is defined to be an unlawful exacting of money which any one
shall do or practice under color of his Office, Lamb. l. 2. c. 5. fo. 179.
Crompton fo. 53 8 H. 6. c. 9.
and this is sundry ways punished according to the quality of the offense.
Lamb. ib. c. 4. f. 414. Cromp. fo. 48.


52. Those maintenances also, which are used for the impeding of Judgment, are
to be accounted in the number of public Crimes, for Maintainers and Barretors
From the French word Barateur.
who are Common fomentors of Suits, and Champarters, F. n. b. 171, 172.
who prosecute other men's Suits at their own Charges upon an Agreement for the
thing in Action, and all unlawful desenders of personal Actions (such as
Imbraceors) Id. 171. A, B, C.
have punishment or dained for their offenses. Lamb. 4. 24. Cromp. 82. and 155.
Flet. l. 2. c. 36. Dier 95. n. 39. and fo. 52. n. 6. 33. H. 8. c. 9.


53. To which pack of Knaves, we may add Adulteries, 32 H. 8. c. 10. 18 Eliz.
c. 3. 27 Eliz. c. 11. Dier, fol. 106. n. 22.
who formerly were for the most part purged by Canonical Penance: [but this
Crime is by a late Act of this present Parliament deservedly made Felony.]
Usurers, 32 H. 8. c. 10. 18 Eliz. c. 3. 27 Eliz. c. 11. Dier ib. n. 22.
although these also if they exacted above ten pounds per Centum, per Annum,
were subject to Ecclesiastical Censu^es, 13 Eliz. c. 8
Monopolizers, who were called Ingro^ers, Fore-stallers, and Regrators, 5 Ed.
6. c. 14 and 15. 4 and 5 Ed. 6. c. 21. Lamb. l. 2. c. 4. fo. 432. Cromp. fol.
69.
and many others who are punishable by Imprisonment and the Pillory, and some
who are punishable also with many of the aforesaid punishments joined together:
but so great an Enumeration would not rightly, or aptly correspond with the
Brevity, which is required in the nature of Institutes or Institutions,
wherefore I shall leave them to the more large Discussions of others, and shall
only make it my Prayer, that since these Labors of ours are by Gods Mercy
finished, they may prove useful, and grateful to those, for whose Leasures
and vacant Hours, we intended this as a Recreation.
