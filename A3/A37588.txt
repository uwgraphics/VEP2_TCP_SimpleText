ANNO XVII. Caroli Regis.
An Act for the speedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in His Majesty's
Kingdom of Ireland to their due obedience to His Majesty and the Crown of
England.
WHereas the Lords and Commons, taking into their serious considerations, as
well the necessity of a speedy reducing of the Rebels of Ireland to their due
obedience, as also the great sums of money that the Commons of this Realm have
of late paid for the public and necessary affairs of this Kingdom, whereof the
Lords and Commons are very sensible, and desirous to embrace all good and
honorable ways, tending to His Majesty's greatness and profit, the settling
of that Realm, and the ease of His Majesty's Subjects of England;

And whereas diverse worthy and well-affected persons, perceiving that many
Millions of Acres of the Rebels Lands of that Kingdom, which go under the name
of profitable Lands, will be confiscate, and to be disposed of; And that in
case two Millions and a half of those Acres to be equally taken out of the four
Provinces of that Kingdom, may be allotted for the satisfaction of such persons
as shall disburse any sums of money for the reducing of the Rebels there,
would effectually accomplish the same, have made these Propositions ensuing
(viz.)

1. That two Millions and an half of those Acres may be assigned, allotted, and
divided amongst them after this proportion, (viz.) For each Adventure of two
hundred pounds, one thousand Acres in Ulster: For three hundred pounds, one
thousand Acres in Conaght: For four hundred and fifty pounds, one thousand
Acres in Munster: For six hundred pounds, one thousand Acres in Leinster. All
according to the English measure, and consisting of Meadow, Arable, and
profitable Pasture, the Bogs, Woods, and barren Mountains being cast in over
and above these two Millions and a half of Acres, to be holden in free and
common Soccage of the King, as of His Castle of Dublin.

2. That out of these two Millions and a half of Acres, a constant yearly rent
shall be reserved to the Crown of England, after this proportion, (viz.) out of
each Acre thereof in Ulster one penie; Out of each Acre in Conaght, three half
pence; Out of each Acre in Munster, two pence farthing; And out of each Acre in
Leinster, three pence; whereby His Majesty's Revenue out of those Lands will be
much improved, besides the advantages that he will have by the coming to his
hands of all other the Lands of the Robells, and their personal Estates,
without any charge unto His Majesty.

3 That for the erecting of Manors, settling of Wastes, and Commons, maintaining
of preaching Ministers, Creating of Corporations, and Regulating of the
several plantations, one, or more Commissions be hereafter granted by
authority of Parliament.

4 That Moneys for this great occasion may be the more speedily advanced, All
the Undertakers in the City of London, and within twenty miles distant
thereof, shall underwrite their several sums before the twentieth day of
March, one thousand six hundred forty one, and all within sixty miles of
London, before the first day of April, one thousand six hundred forty two,
and the rest of the Kingdom before the first day of May, one thousand six
hundred forty two.

5 That the several sums to be underwritten, shall be paid in at four
paiments, (viz.) One fourth part within ten days after such underwriting, and
the other three parts at three Months, and three Months, all to be paid into
the Chamber of London.

6 That for the better securing of the said several sums accordingly, every
one that does so Vnderwrite shall at the time of his Subscription pay down the
twentieth part of the total sum that shall be by him then underwritten. And in
case that the residue of his first fourth part be not paid in to such person,
or persons as shall be appointed to receive the same, within the ten days
before limited, then such party shall not only forfeit the twentieth part of
the sum total formerly deposited, but so much more of his first fourth payment
to be added thereunto, as shall make up the one Moyetie of the said fi^^t
payment. And if the same person shall fail in any other of the three paiments,
he shall then forfeit his entire first fourth part, and all the benefit of his
Subscription, which forfeiture shall accrue to the common benefit of the rest
of the underwriters.

And whereas as well our Sovereign Lord the King, as the Lords and Commons have
approved of the said Propositions, and assented that the said Propositions, and
all other things necessarily conducing thereunto, shall be ratifyed and
confirmed by authority of Parliament;

Be it therefore Enacted by Our Sovereign Lord the King, with the assent of the
Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by authority of
