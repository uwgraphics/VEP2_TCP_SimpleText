THE Convert SCOT, AND Apostate English.
1.
CLeveland; thy Ashes (sure) will Rise:
The Scots, are Proselites become,
Here were those Rebels in Disguise;
And now thou would reverse their Doom.
2.
'Twas our Fanatic Presbyter,
The Devils Factors made the Plot,
By them misled, the Scots did Err;
Which then thou call'dst, Apostrate Scot.
3.
The Proverb; From the North no Good,
Is now turned South, where Perjured Slaves
Swear us to Gaols; and in a Flood
of Butchery, scarce give us Graves.
4.
The Damned Crew of Angels Fall,
Whose Pride first moved them to Rebel,
But You Incarnate, worst of all,
Through Malice, God and Man would Sell.
5.
Devil to Devils all were True,
But Man to Man, no Thought can reach,
Nature, would cease to be, if You
Might cut off all you would Impeach.
6.
The Laws constructiondoth lie
In Judges Breasts; the Letter Kills;
Justice, such Evidence throws by,
Whose Lives are Infamous for Ills.
7.
There Is seven of them, and seven more,
Have Covenanted all with Hell,
To make seven Deadly Sins their Whore;
None ever knew her half so well.
8.
These Villains charge themselves with Crimes
They have not done; Damned Policy!
That what they Swear at other Times
May be Believed, though Perjury!
9.
To which a Pardon being had,
Then Hang who e're they will Accuse;
And make the Raging Rabble mad,
When any man for Justice Sues.
10.
Reason is Witchcraft; or else why
Can any man of Sense believe
Such Basket-Crew, e're came so nigh
To Courts and Councils to deceive.
11.
Commissions, Armies, Fleets, and France,
All this Intrigue discovered by
O --, B --, D --, D -- and P --,
Who can believe so strange a Lie?
12.
Did ever men Sell their belief
To Gaols and Pillories? who yet
Gives Credit to a Common Thief,
Or Branded Rogue on mischief set?
13.
Plague of the Innocent, the Nations Curse,
The hand of Heaven will cut down;
Since God made Man, none ever worse,
Pretended yet to save a Crown.
14.
But these the Vulgar Hireling Slaves,
The Bashaws use, to storm their Works,
And raise themselves upon their Graves,
Such are our English (Nobles) Turks.
15.
Justice awake, Scroggs sit thou fast,
Thou were o'r-rul'd by Perjuries:
But Langhorn's Case urges thy have,
To clear Fair Truth from Forgeries.
16.
Now Undeceived, be Just and Bold,
You dare enough, do then as well,
And growing Good, as you grow Old,
Ages to come your Justice tell.
17.
Our Laws are founded, or should be,
On Laws of God, Who never Kill
When they can Save; and yet you see
How Blood of Innocents we Spill.
18.
The Law Condemns a Priest to Die,
But Supreme Law commands them so,
That for their Lives they must not Fly;
One of the two they must forego.
19.
Our Faith in many points agree,
Our Birthrights we may claim of old;
What is it then to any he
If Ancient Verity I hold.
20.
Likely, You Err, for upward look,
What Ages past believed as I,
And nearer to the Spring; the Brook
Far distant, does in Puddles die:
If at the Fount, I Drink or Wash,
The Crystal Spring has used no dash.
21.
Has Charity deserved to Die,
Our Savior Suffered for that;
We sometimes Kill an Enemy,
Not Murder Friends for none knows what.
22.
Our Laws receive their force from Power,
And the Offenders Forfeit Life;
Here it is, where Law does Law devour,
And why, such Law, would end the Strife?
23.
Men long in Peace, deserving well
From King and Country, now surpised,
And Charged with Crimes, no Age can tell,
But those who have this Plot devised.
24.
Now worthy Scroggs, your Brethren too;
Unbiased, let your Judgments fall;
We dare the World, what they can do,
May we have Justice, when we call.
25.
O! Cleavland, had thou lived this Age,
Thou could not Write, unless to Lie;
For none but Devils Tredd our Stage:
Where speaking Truth, you surely Die
For public Good or Popery.
26.
A King to Govern, or else none,
A Linsey-woolsey Government;
It Is Rabble-property they own,
And say it is Law, or so it is mean^.
27.
They stalk with one, Ambitions Fool,
Affecting Popularity;
Make use of Him as a Close-stool,
First fill Him up, then throw Him by.
28.
The Monster Mobile, then Roars,
Prepared by 'th Mountebank of State,
We Will have no Fools, nor Sons of Whores,
A Commonwealth shall end their Date.
29.
Nor King, nor Parliament, nor Laws,
Kill all Pretenders to the Crown;
Nor Lords, nor Bishops; those py'd Daws,
With all Adherents shall go down.
30.
Then up go we, we will share the Land;
Too long they have usurped our Right:
And now by turns, we will all Command,
And show the World our last New-light.
31.
Are we not good as Fishermen?
Our Hogon-Mogon Neighbors now,
They were called Traitors; and what then?
Their King that was, now them allow.
32.
They did Reform, it thrived, So good,
God did intend what they should be;
They were enforced to let some Blood
(As We) to purge Idolatry.
33.
Your Elders Laws, have that vast scope,
Preliminary to all Power;
Each in his Parish would be Pope,
Like Baal's Priests all things Devour.
34.
These are your Saintships Rules of State,
And Lucifer has Lectur'd you;
All above you, ye Deadly hate,
And would not God should have his due.
35.
Must still the Van, Religion,
Led on by Lies, and false pretense,
Bring up the Rear, Rebellion;
And blind our Reason without Sense.
36.
Set up an Idol-Parliament,
Which with False Worship men adore,
As if Religion were meant,
The House of Commons, Common-whore.
37.
The slights of Hocus not so plain,
Though Cheat our sight, yet none believe,
But Hocus still he does remain,
Through fine Conveyance in his Sleeve.
38.
Thus Captain Satan leads you on;
Your Pride and Malice makes you Swell,
Then Captain leaves ye all alone,
You Will find the way your selves to Hell.
39.
Damned Hypocrites, Rebellious Race,
In Power Impudent and Bold;
Pale Whining Cowards, Face to Face
Your God and Hopes lies in your Gold.
40.
Short-sighted Fools, can your base Coin
Corrupt that God who Kings protects,
Or suffer you to break that Line,
Which he has made, and still directs.
41.
It Is not to cast down Popery.
But by your Counterfeited Zeal;
To raise New-Englands Anarchy,
Devolving to a Commonweal.
42.
Too long on Caterpillars, I
Digression make; but now to Men
Whose Honor, in Antiquity
Deserves to be revived again.
43.
Religion early there Embraced
By Race of Kings, Christians bold,
Brave men at Arms, and not debased;
And now this Age revives the Old.
44.
How Sweet blows the Northern Air,
Dispelling Mists, and no Clouds there;
The Rebel Covenant washed Fair,
No thoughts against Apparent Heir.
45.
Brave Scots go on, a Braver man
Never wanted yet Protection
Then our Great Duke of York; what can
But this, Merit Oblivion?
All that is past of Guilty fact,
Lies buried here, in this one Act.
46.
None live Unblemished, or who not deceived,
Who ever Trusts unhappily,
May err; If none must be believed,
We must forsake Society.
47.
Frailties to all men are allowed;
We Plume not here on Angels Wings;
The weak or fearful in a Cloud,
Cannot distinguish best of Things.
49.
Repentance wipes out Blackest Spots,
If ye relapse, you are sick to death,
Be henceforth called the Convert-Scots,
This Covenant sign now with your Breath.
50.
A Glorious occasion now
Courts ye, with opportunity:
Let after-ages say of you,
When all men failed us, you stood by.
51.
Your King, your Country, all their Friends
now need your Duty, and your Love,
Bravely appear, and make amends;
Let Us Hand in Hand together move.
52.
Down with your Kirk-Roost, Curb them so
They cannot hurt; take Sword in Hand,
Defend your King from Inbred Foe.
And York Conduct you in Command.
53.
The Law of Nature binds Mankind,
And that Religion is true,
To give and take, with equal mind,
To God and Caesar what is due.
54.
Rouse then Brave men, let the World see,
What you dare do for Royal Blood;
Your Lives and Country are not free;
'Less you maintain Monarchy Good.
54.
But if ye fail, all Good men's Curse
On you and your Posterity:
May ye be Slaves, and what is worse.
Beg Bread of your Presbytery.
A Postscript upon the D. of Y's. Return to Scotland.
NOw York again Shines in your Sphere,
A Constant Daylight, true born Son;
Which does forebode a Happy Year,
Now finish what you have begun.
2.
If your wild Spiritists, possessed
With Hellish Principles Rebel,
And against Legal Power protest,
Send them the shortest way to Hell.
3.
For speedy Justice in a Storm,
And Mutiny more Souls does Save,
Then slow Proceeding by Laws Form,
Lost time, a Master's made a Slave.
4.
Examples made to terrify,
Makes men consider what they do;
Where no Reprieve is, but must Die,
Men are unapt t'engage that Foe.
5.
Let your Great Council make an Act,
And by that Act all Subjects Bind,
To take an Oath, or else be Rackt,
Till the Succession they have Signed.
6.
Our Lofty Shrubbs raised by the King,
That on his Seat, Justice Outface,
Must tumble down, that no such thing
Be ever named; but with Disgrace.
7.
Ungrateful Brutes, baser then Slaves,
The fallen Angels is your sin,
Who for your Makers do dig Graves;
But in those Pits your selves fall in.
8.
Foolish Achitophels; his Fate
Follows your Steps, and you must Die
For the same Cause, and at the Gate,
Where Treason 's joined with Perjury.
9.
The Protestant Religion
Is the false cry, and common Cheat
Of all your Atheism; who have none,
Nor will, till brought to Judgment Seat.
10.
There by Confession, purge your Guilt,
Mercy may meet you at the Stage,
Tell Godfrey 's Death, and what Bloods Spilt
By your Designs, and peoples Rage.
11.
Then, not till then, three Kingdoms may,
In Unity give Praise to God;
And all good men rejoice, and say,
Charles's Scepter is like Aarons Rod.
12.
Then all True Subjects will obey,
The wild Fanatics will Conform;
Then all the World with us will say,
God Saved us in a mighty Storm.
13.
If you deny, all thinking Men
Conclude an Arbitrary Power,
Designed by You, to save you, when
You Are no where Safe but in the Tower.
