THE SOVLDIERS Alarm Bell, To awaken all such Who are lulled asleep in the
supposed security of a Parliamentary Conventicle unlawfully sitting at
Westminster.

By B.C.

Printed in the Year 1659.

Dear Friends and Fellow Soldiers,
WE did believe and were fully persuaded that at our general meeting in
Shoe-lane, the first of July instant, you had clearly perceived and understood
by our Timely Advice directed formerly to you, the sole intent and way laid out
therein by our present Pseudo-Masters, wholly to destroy us from being what we
are, and have deserved, by our former gallantry and stoutnesse upon all
designs under the Conduct of a most Illustrious undaunted prosperous General,
whom the great God of all victories owned, with our service, in every design;
we mean Oliver late Protector, who freed not only this very nation of England
from a long endured slavery, and yoke of Tyrannical bondage: But also Ireland
and Scotland, and of whom the worst of Sycophants cannot in truth speak evil.

Now the scope of this our second writing is as well to rowse you up, and
invest your selves with your former undauntednesse of spirit and resolution,
that our intended work may take effect: As also to show the truth unto you
which is much endeavored to be obscured from your and our knowledge; (but we
have a faithful Agitator) as namely and formerly held forth unto you, the
timely preventing of our own ruin, by our new usurped Masters, the present
Pseudo-Parliament, who have no power but what they borrow from us, and have not
we an equal birthright in all? especially by the many hazards of our dearest
lives and fortunes: then let none of us all be faint-hearted, let us knit our
selves together, and labor for our own preservations, while we have advantage,
and the cause good let us strike; least the world should have just Cause to
say, we have sold our former magnanimous spirits, and undaunted resolutions for
a dish of broth and a halfpenny loaf; though many raw Soldiers who are lately
crept into Regiments, never suffered the miseries or underwent the many dangers
we have done in the first and latter war, may peradventure serve without pay
for bread and cheese.

And does not the intentions of this Parliamentary-Conventicle now appear, when
their present resolves are first, to have us give them three months of our
pay, not regarding the many necessities we, our wives and children have been
put unto, barely to live, and many of us much indebted to Sutlers and
Landlords, who (if we should so childishly give away, what we have earned,
with much penury, our pay) would quickly bring the lash of a Sergeant, and
stink of a prison upon us, to the absolute ruin, and destruction of most of
us, our wives and children; After which done according to their present
resolves, to send some of us to Iamaica, others into remote Countries at their
pleasures, and disband the rest upon settling the Militia; thus clandestinely
under the notion of sugared dissembling promises, and smooth words from oyled
tongues, we shall suddenly be betrayed and destroyed.

Is it not also manifest unto you, what small provision they make for us, now
they have gotten the Staff into their own hands, endeavoring to make us
despicable creatures, by bringing beggary upon us, the absolute scorn of a
stout and valiant Soldier; is not also the matter of that pretended Good Old
Cause, now turned into a new cheat? then as the case stands upon our present
decaying Interest, is it not high time to relieve and restore our selves to what
of right we should be? Soldiers not fearing the face of man, and in whom the
power of this Common wealth, and change of Government shall rest, and if we
truly love God and our Country, let us not suffer our own subversions, nor
any thing that may tend to destruction of us, or our gained and dearly bought
liberties.

Was not Oliver late Protector, that ever undaunted Spirit of Magnanimity, That
absolute Honor of Mars, That burning fiery flame to the great Turk, the great
terror of all Princes and Countries, a second Solomon for wisdom, while our
General, after all his hazards, expenses, charges of a long, dangerous and
doubtful War, most passionately grieved, and troubled that this then sitting
pseudo Parliament, who still strove (as now) to perpetuate themselves, would
never labor the settlement of our long contended for liberties; till by
providence, our consents, and the advice of all the Judges of these Nations,
the Government was settled in a single person, as most agreeable to the laws
and nature of Englishmen, and owned in him, sitting too few years at the stern
with hand continually upon the helm, for the good government of these Nations,
according to law and Justice: And where he found a good and just rule, he
altered not, where he found none, or a broken, weak defective one, he was ever
most strong and earnest for reformation thereof. Was not many abuses in the
laws by him regulated for the ease and relief of the people, was not many
poor, despicable, starving creatures by him constantly relieved; did not very
many in these three Nations who had long suffered, under wrong, injustice and
oppression, by him obtain relief; did he not spend what he had in relieving the
needy and oppressed? did he not spend himself, his whole strength of nature in
studying and endeavoring the preservation of these Nations in peace; did he
not always take some reasonable care and time for paying us, did he not own
us, and succor us. And can either you or we, any way discover the like care to
be amongst the present pseudo Governors, does not then those many undue
Reflections, Calumnies, and unchristian scoffs, cast upon the said late
Protector, rather argue the ventositie of men's brains, the baseness and
vanity of their minds, with their dunghill spirits then either the solidity of
their Jugements or the gravity of their conditions and behavior being well
known by all knowing rational men in the world, not any can justly Calumniate
him.

Does not also those Counties, Cities, Towns corporate, magistrates, ministers,
the Council, the whole Army of the three nations, the Judges of the land who
made their respective Addresses, and owned Richard the Protector as lawful
Successor to his late Father in the office of Protector according to an
authentic Act of Parliament, desiring him to protect those that are good, to
punish those that are bad, to maintain the just rights and privileges of the
people of God, and the whole nation, engaging to assist him with their lives
and fortunes, and also imploring the assistance and blessing of God upon his
endeavors herein, sufficiently declare him to be supreme Governor of these
nations? And he who took such special care with the late Parliament for paying
us off, would also have been, and we are assured will still be as careful of
us, and our preservations, so soon as we shall have reestablshed him Protector,
without whom we are absolutely ruined and our posterities, being well assured,
that this present Parliamentary Conventicle, who aim at nothing more then their
own perpetuity, will be our destruction, nor indeed and in truth were it not a
great unworthiness in us who ought to have the greatest share of worthiness,
to own Richard Protector, as well for his owning our fellow soldiers at
Dunkirk and Mardike in procuring there full pay to be paid unto them, a perfect
example of his future care over us and ours, having been so careful for them,
he can nor will be less mindful of us; who has also been at that great
charge in his own expenses to give redcoats to us all, a pattern beyond
example, and which our present usurped Masters will never do, but rather work
our destruction for their own advantage and pepetuity.

Now understand, that as it has been always resolved, by the Judges and laws
of this Nation, that the deposition, or death of a King, does actually dissolve
a Parliament, nor can the succeeding King, or successor whatsoever hold or
continue the said Parliament, or prorogue it; so by the same law was this
pseudo Parliament dissolved, and made no Parliament, by the late Kings death,
and not by us, or any part of the Army though falsely by many so asserted.

Also, that this present Pseudo-Parliament was summoned particularly by the
late King CHARLES in his natural, as well as politic capacity, but not for
him, his heirs or successors; for he ceased to be both Charles and a King of
this Realm by his death, and the Council by whose advise it was first summoned
was his own, not his heirs and Successors, besides it was summoned by the King
himself, to treat, consult, and give their advice with him personally which by
his death was impossible, and so determined, expired, and dissolved; even as a
natural ceases to be a living man, when the head is cut off; or, as if a man
should by his will or deed authorize any three persons, jointly to sell lands,
give livery and seisin, and one of them dye, the other two jointly or severally
can do nothing, because their trust and authority was joint, not several; and
so jointly not separately to be executed; therefore no lawful call for this
Parliamentary Conventicle to sit, nor as they are not a house under the number
of forty, so they can make no lawful Act under the number of one hundred and
fifty.

Thus as it is evident that the present convened Parliamentary Conventicle at
Westminster is no Parliament, by all the laws of this Nation, as in part
before mentioned; nor ought of right to sit, being the only men contriving our
destruction, let us not boggle, or carry the hearts of women to dissolve and
turn them out of doors, with greater scorn, infamy and derision, then they
endeavor to bring us into: let you and us go on together, in this work
courageously without fear or dispondencie; let us not own them, nor their
encroached Parliamentary power, acts, or impositions, least through our
unworthy Cowardice and negligence in this kind, we suddenly become a prey, to
these self ended perpetuateing Princes, nothing at all caring for us or the
public good, but likely to transform the City and Country into a place of
scorn and beggary.

And though the Lord Henry Cromwell has very suddenly made his appearance at
Westminster contrary to expectation; yet let that be no cause for you to
prevaricate or turn back from the work intended, for the old soldiers of the
Army in Ireland, have assured us that he left them without consent, and they
desire us to hold our resolutions and they will own and stand with us; as also
the City of London have many thousands well prepared to join with us, then what
cause of fear, or whose commands shall we break in performing the work of
dissolving them, are not they under our power?

Thus have we again discovered unto you our fellow Soldiers, as to our selves,
what of necessity requires a remedy with all speed: Before a disease has
brought the body low, it will endure heates and colds and many distempers, and
alter little or nothing visibly, but the dregs remain and bring the disease by
degrees to a height, and then every slight offense is taken, and strong
distempers appear to danger and ruin; And it may be rationally judged our
Pseudo-Governors labor under a Critical sign, the disease is grown so strong,
it has such a height, that we must all unanimously intervene for our own
preservations, else danger is at hand; And this thing now presented to you, is
an evident Symptom, what will speedily be done against us, by those who have
no power to Sit, but from us, and may we not then call home that which we have
lent?

The sole way of all our preservations being in reestablshing Richard
Protector; For it is most necessary, one absolute head in any Government must
be; and who more right to it then Richard Protector? both for his great care
over us, for the preservation of all us, and ours, and his endeavors to have
the Laws and our Liberties performed and kept; Therefore, we think most fit,
and least without suspicion, that upon Tuesday the (...) instant, when you are
all met for the Church at Westminster, that you faithfully resolve like men to
prepare your selves with us to dissolve and turn them out of doors, when,
undoubtedly expect us, fully to complete these our resolutions, which by Law,
Reason and Equity, must speedily be acted, to make our selves safe under the
Protector, which no where else is to be had.
