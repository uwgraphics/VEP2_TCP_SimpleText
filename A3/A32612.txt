A PROCLAMATION Prohibiting the keeping of Barnwell Fair near Cambridge.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, out of His Princely and Christian care of
His loving Subjects, that no good means may be neglected to stay the further
spreading of the present Infection and Contagion, does find it convenient to
prevent all occasions of public Concourse: And therefore being informed that
there is at hand a Fair of special note, usually kept on the Four and twentieth
of June, called Midsummer-day, at the said Town of Barnwell, unto which there
is great resort out of many parts of this Kingdom, the holding whereof at this
time, may be occasion of danger and Infection to the Town and University of
Cambridge, and other places, which by Gods mercy are now clear and free; has
with the Advice of His Privy Council, thought good by this His Royal
Proclamation, not only to admonish and require all His loving Subjects to
forbear to resort for this time to the said Fair, but also to enjoin the Lord
thereof, and others Interessed therein, to forbear holding the said Fair for
this present year, upon pain of punishment, as for a Contempt so much
concerning the safety of the people, they shall be adjudged to deserve; which
they must expect to be inflicted with all Severity. And His Majesty does hereby
Declare, That the Lord of the said Fair, or any others Interessed in the
Profits thereof, shall not by this temporary Restraint receive any prejudice in
the right of his Fair, or Liberties thereunto belonging; Any thing herein
before contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

Given at the Court at Whitehall the 25th day of May, 1666. in the 18th year of
His Majesty's Reign.
