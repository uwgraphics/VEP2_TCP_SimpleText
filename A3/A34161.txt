I.
^Ou^^ you be a Man of Fashion,
Would you lead a Life Divine?
^ou'd you be a Man of Fashion,
^ou'd you lead a Life Divine?
^ke^ a little Dram of Passion,
^n a lusty Bowl of Wine.

^we was but put in for fashion,
Wine will do the Work alone.
II.

Gown-Fop Whigs that loves to prate?
Would you have, etc.
Gown-Fop, etc.
Take a Dram of Tony's Notion,
in a Coffee-Dish of State:
^f the Poison will not warm you,
take ye Tea, 'twill do the thing;
There are Statesmen can inform you
how to Rule without a King.
III.
Would you then be thought most witty,
would you be a Man of parts?
Would you be, etc.
would you, etc.
Aid the Factious of the City,
till your Hanged for your Deserts:
If your Virtue's not Rewarded,
for the glorious thing you aimed;
And a another Saint Recorded,
Ca -- and Cu -- both be damned.
IV.
Would you have a New Religion,
founded on a Plot of State?
Would you have, etc.

Whisper but with Pra -- Pidgeon,
in a Dungeon through a Grate:
If your Soul finds no impression,
Murdered Godfreys will appear;
Though there needs no more Confession,
kiss the Book, and all is clear.
V.
Would you have a true Narration,
how the City first was fired;
Would you, etc.
how, etc.
Let the Monuments relation,
prove the Man, and those they hired:
If the Phaenix was consumed,

All her pride was reassumed
by the Ignoramus-Whigs.
VI.
Would you have another Charter,
you that should be Men of sense?
Would, etc.
you that, etc.
Talk no more of Magna-Charta,
but rely upon your Prince:
If you can Repent sincerely,
Caesar has a God-like mind;
Purge out Factiousness severely,
Caesar will be always kind.
