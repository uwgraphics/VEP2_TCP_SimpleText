the Honorable City of LONDON.

Written upon the perusing of the special PASSAGES of the two Weeks, from the
29 of November, to the 13 of December, 1642. And Dedicated to the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen of the said City.

By a Countryman, a Well-willer of the City, and a Lover of TRUTH and PEACE.

London, Printed Anno 1642.

HE has not the heart of an Englishman, or of a Christian in his breast, whose
bowels do not roll within him, when he considers the miserable Distractions
of this divided Kingdom, threatening a Germane desolation thereof, and of the
Church of God therein. I have therefore much wondered to see so many religious
men, and good Patriots, more ready to bring Fuel and Breath to the kindling
and increasing, then tears to the quenching, or hands to the putting out of
that fire, which in a short time, has already seized on all the Parts of the
Kingdom, and if it burn a while after the rate it has begun, is like soon to
make us the scorn, as we have long been the envy of all our Neighbors. But I
was altogether astonished to find the sheet of the special Passages of the
other week, to begin with these words; This Week has produced matters much
conducing to the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom; A Petition against an
Accommodation (unless the King come to the Parliament) from diverse
well-affected Citizens of LONDON. And yet I would not be thought to differ from
men so well-affected in this judgment, That the Kings return to that his
great, and most faithful Counsel were not the most sure and speedy way to
recover a right understanding between His Majesty and His Parliament; and that
happiness of a well established Peace throughout the whole Kingdom, which no
man without breach of Charity, can suspect His Majesty does not most sincerely
affect, and so much more then any one of His Subjects, as His interest therein
is greater. But because I conceive it as hard to induce His Majesty thereunto,
as to persuade the Parliament to adjourn to another place, till those vehement,
though groundless Jealousies which either of them has of each other, be
extinguished, or at least allayed: I can therefore by no means approve of the
counsel for good, being, as I doubt, impracticable, though I believe as much
as another of the good intentions of the persons that gave it. For if there be
cause to fear, That the King will never be drawn to agree to any reasonable
terms of Accommodation, while His Majesty is imprisoned by the Cavaliers, and
encircled by those wicked Counselors, who by this Writer are presumed to be
about him, and to have power to seduce Him: Can it be reasonably thought, That
the Cavaliers will be less vigilant to keep His Majesty from making an escape,
Or those Counselors to charm Him from stirring from them, though it be for the
Peace of the Kingdom, till their own be first made with the Parliament? But the
Petitioners advice is, To have those Cavaliers and Counselors pursued, and His
Majesty freed from them by that means; perhaps this may prove a thing easier to
say then to do, as experience has showed. Let us not so soon forget what we
have lately learned, at our great charge. His Majesty had erected His Standard
at Nottingham, to which there was no such mighty nor hasty confluence as was
expected. The Cavaliers (which term I would not consent to abuse, if it were
not at the present impossible to reduce it to the right use again) had
attempted Warwick and Coventry, and failed in both. They had marched against
the Forces of the Parliament near Southam, in no very unequal strength, though
the numbers were somewhat unequal, and had fallen off in a disorderly Retreat,
without striking stroke. This was likely to give so much discouragement to the
Kings Party (not too forward to show it self before) that it was thought a
matter of much difficulty, if not impossibility, for His Majesty to raise His
Forces, then very weak, to a complete Army, in time to oppose that of the
Parliament, then ready to march, and abundantly provided of all necessaries for
the War. Hereupon the Parliament rejected a reiterated Offer of His Majesty's
to treat, and with high Wisdom, as then in hope the King might have been
necessitated to have abandoned certain Delinquents, or they the Kingdom,
besides the weighty Reasons expressed in their Answers. But whether by Gods
blessing upon the sincerity of His Majesty's Protestation, most solemnly
renewed near Wellington, with a necessary Exception thereunto; Or by the
Industry and courage of some persons active enough before, but then quickened by
their desperate Condition; Or by what other more secret providence or means I
know not; sure I am, That in a very short space of time, the Scale was so far
turned, even beyond the expectation of Cavaliers and Counselors, as may be
showed under their hands, that His Majesty's Army gave Battle to that of the
Parliament, fought it so well, that it is not yet agreed who had the Victory.
But if the Cavaliers were defeated, they marched within seven miles of the
Parliament after their Defeat, there stood in Battle again, and thence made
one of the most resolute, if not the most souldierly Retreats has been heard
of in our Age; so improsperous is the excess of confidence in the success of
War, as well as of Duells: and let us therefore beware of stumbling again at
that stone, as the Petitioners might have observed the Parliament to be. Why
His Majesty has no Money; and without the strength of that sinew of War, His
Cavaliers, as gallant as they are, can have but paralitique Arms. A vain
conceit, That silver and gold should not soon be brought under the power of
Brass and Iron; Or that he that is grown well-nigh Master of the Field, should
not in humane reason soon become Master of this whole Kingdom for want of Money
or Ammunition: I forbear to say by what means, lest I should be thought to have
a mind to give crafty counsel to the wicked Counselors, of which they have
no need, nor I any disposition, if I had ability, to help them. And besides,
may it not be feared, That the Parliament may ere long have no superfluity of
that all-working Engine, when the Petitioners, who have born the greatest part
of the charge of the War, and whose Purses have been so open hitherto, upon
the security of the public Faith only, are now fallen so much from their
former speed, that the Parliament has found it necessary to promise a speedy
re-embursement of the Moneys now desired to be advanced, out of the first that
shall come in upon the Ordinance of Assessement; of which, what the effect will
be, upon that generation of men that were not forward to set up their rest upon
this War, when the Game was much fairer then now it is, peradventure there may
be some little question. O but if we should chance to need any help, the
Petitioners have been assured it is ready to come from Foreign parts: For the
Penner of the Passages had told them, before he told us, in the beginning of
his second half Sheet, That the States of Holland and Zealand, and the States
general, have unanimously agreed on a Declaration to be sent into England,
desiring to join with this Kingdom in mutual assistance each of other, and
with Scotland likewise. Then which (understanding it (as this Writer does) of
those States, so joining with the Parliament, standing in the terms it does
with the King) I had rather see any tolerable Accommodation of the differences
between the Parliament and His Majesty; and yet I wish His Majesty, by advice
of His Parliament, were in such a League with those States, as much as any
other man does, that has an eye therein to the public Interest only. So much
is the master of the Passages above the reach of my understanding in Affairs of
State, if he have not overreached his own, when he conceived of this
Production of this Week, as of a thing much conducing to the Peace and Safety
of this Kingdom: of which stretches (the Issue of partiality and a good wit) I
presume every intelligent Reader has observed many in his former weekly
Accounts, which is all I know of him, not having the least imagination who the
man is. But the best is, that he has been abused by his Intelligencer on the
other side, as well in the News, as in the goodness of it; which I would not so
confidently affirm, having my self no Correspondent there, if it were a thing
unknown to any man that knows the Fundamental Constitution of that State,
and the present temper thereof, That an unanimous concurrence in any matter of
this nature among any of those States, against the mind of the Prince of
Orange, is a thing only not impossible. And howsoever the wisdom of the
Parliament of England is too great to be caught, with the Bait of such an
Overture, which under the show of helping us to bear our burdens, would
shuffile an incomparable heavier of their own upon our shoulders, of which we
should quickly come to bear more then our part. I will therefore here pray the
Petitioners to beware of believing all they read in Print hereafter; and so I
leave them, I hope not ill satisfied with me, when I have here publicly
professed my sincere concurrence with them in the main matter of the chief of
their former Petitions, though I cannot subscribe to this.

The unadvisednesse of this Petition, and it may be the seeming inequality,
between being assessed and forced to pay Moneys in a great proportion, toward
the maintenance of this War, without any hope of re-payment (for ought can be
discerned by the Ordinance) and the Loan of like, or it may be less sums, upon
engagement of the public Faith for re-embursement with Interest, seems to
have stirred up a great multitude of disaffected persons (as they are styled
by the Contriver of the Passages) to subscribe a Petition for Peace in more
absolute terms then it may be was altogether fit, yet may better be excused,
then the petitioning against Peace in the most complying Language can be
devised.

And the direct contradiction of these two exorbitant Petitions, and the high
Contestation of the Petitioners about them, seems to have moved the wise
Senate, and Common-Counsell of the City to enter into a deliberation about the
framing of of a third (mentioned in the Passages of this last week) which I
would not be thought to have the presumption to censure further then this, That
(knowing what I know) I do much doubt, the infusion of the grievances annexed
thereunto, may make it too strong a Medicine for our disease, considering his
stomach from which it must receive all the operation it can have toward our
cure.

The News of these three diverse Petitions all on foot at the same time, in the
same City, has stirred thoughts in me of the danger of a City divided in it
self, and of another of greater consequence, particularly and inseparably
involved in the division of the City of London, that being such an Epitome of
the whole Kingdom of England, That out of the History of what is doing there,
whether good or evil, a wise man may ever write an infallible Prophecy of
what will ere long be in agitation in the whole Land. And the consideration of
the aforesaid dangers, joined to the hope I have, That in contemplation of
them, the City will think it no presumption in us good people of the poor
plundered Country, in such an overgrown storm as this, to desire to be allowed
an Oar in the rowing of that Boat to shore, in which we, and all that we have,
are embarked, as well as they, have raised up my spirits to make an Essay
whether it may be possible to project such a way, tending to the bringing of
the King and Parliament together again, as may be suitable to the several
Intentions of the respective Petitioners of the City; and so by Gods blessing,
a means to reduce them, and by them, the whole Body of the Kingdom to that
Unity, which if I might but live to see, I should then cheerfully sing my Nunc
dimittis. And because experience has taught me, that the rarity and greatness
of affairs and accidents of State, does I know not how dazzle the eyes of men
unaccustomed, and unacquainted with the judging and handling of them, and that
the best way to dispell this mist, is to look on such things and courses which
are usual in common life, and by them to take the right proportions, and
measure, and way of managing of the other less known, my first endeavors
shall be to find out such a parallel for that business now in hand. And as I
know no comparison does run better, or more fit then that of a man and his wife
with the King and his Parliament, so I would our present distempers were not
too like the condition of a Woman and her Husband first parted upon Jealousy,
and other discontents between them, and then not knowing how with credit to
come together again, when the great increase of both their discomforts,
occasioned by their separation, has sufficiently disposed them unto it. For in
this case, which is of too common knowledge if through the working of their
own good nature, of the solicitation of others, they shall take a resolution
to make haste to meet again at one great stop by passing over all that has
passed between them in silence, (which seems to be the way on which the
opposite Petitioners are yet agreed) it is a hundred to one, that once within a
month, or a year or two, some new falling out upon old reckonings will happen
between them, and then this second breach will be harder to make up then the
former. On the otherside, if they shall resolve to live asunder till
satisfaction shall be given for every cause of distaste, and till every ground
of difference between them shall be fully reconciled, by the going of friends,
or sending of Papers between them (which is the way of the third Petition) the
adventure is no less, that pick thank tale-bearers, and such other persons,
as either are gainers by their being at odds, or in danger by their
reconcilement, will give so many cunning interruptions to the length of such a
Negotiation, that one of their lives will be ended before the Treaty be
concluded; in this case therefore it has ever been found best to go a middle
way by compounding all the principal grounds of their separation before their
return into the same house, and to leave the rest to be agreed between
themselves, which after they have had a new taste of the contentment of living
as they ought together, will easily be done in that field where all quarrels
between Husband and Wife should be fought out. In imitation of which
proceeding approved by many experiments, let us first enquire after the
Original grounds of the present wide differences between the King and his
Parliament, and then, after the most probable expedients, to agree them. And if
I be not mistaken, this great inundation, which in a short time has almost
overwhelmed the whole Kingdom, has arisen from theree so small springs, that
a man, who has not observed the times, and places, at which other rivers and
torrents fell into their channells, would be astonished to behold the height of
the deluge they are now risen to. They were the misunderstanding between his
Majesty and the Parliament touching the perpetuation, and freedom thereof, and
about the Protection of reputed delinquents on the one side and on the other.
And in the present conjuncture of affairs, I can imagine no possible means of
overcoming these three Fundamental and mother points of difference, before the
whole Kingdom be overrun with plundering, but by passing three new Acts of
Parliament: The first of them may be drawn up two ways, either in the form
of a general Amnestie from the beginning of the world without any exception of
any persons. Or else if this motion shall be rejected on both sides (as it may
be it will) then to insert a limitation of time from which the Amnestie shall
begin, and to which it shall extend, as to certain crimes to be particularly
specified, and excepted in the Act, as it uses to be done in general pardons,
and the trial of persons that may happen to be charged with them, to be
therein also particularly referred to such Judges to whom by Law it does
appertain, which in appearance can be no new, nor moot case. For in the
present equality of Forces; I despair of agreement, if any persons shall be
excepted by name.

The second is an act for the securing of the Parliament, and all the Members
thereof, as well against all tumultuary Assemblies of the people, as from all
attempts by way of force, though under pretense of authority from the King. In
which act it must be remembered to be particularly specified, that the person
of the King, for the time being is, and ever shall be taken as a part of the
Parliament, as indeed it ought to be taken in, whenever the Parliament is
spoken of as an entire body, which must have a head, though as the head and
body may be contradistinguished at other times, so may the King and Parliament
be also by the same reason.

The third is an act for the assurance of an Annual Parliament in the same
manner that a Trienniall is now assured, but with two additions: One for the
security of the Members of both Houses to be conducted to the place appointed
for the holding of the Parliament, and for their safe remaining thereby the
Sherifes of the respective Counties through which they are to pass, and in
which the Parliament shall happen to be kept, or by such other Officers as may
be thought more fit, which under correction was an omission in the act for the
Trienniall Parliament. And another, as well for the prevention of the
unseasonable dissolution of Parliaments, without the consent of both Houses, as
for the assurance of the dissolution of every Parliament within the space of
one year, in which there may be two Sessions thereof at such times, and of
such length as shall be judged most convenient. I do expect, that this overture
should be abominated by some on both sides, and that is an argument to me, that
it is the most equitable proposition can be made for the agreeing of this
supreme point of difference to the benefit of His Majesty, of the Parliament,
and people of this Kingdom, as will be found upon a just calculation of the
conveniences thereof in relation to the inconveniences of present
constitutions. For as all the incommodities which the King and Kingdom have
felt by the too long intermission, and abrupt breaking up of Parliaments, will
be prevented by this order for the frequency, and continuance of them; so the
determining of them at a certain time, and the making of two Sessions in each
of them, may by Gods blessing prove an effectual Antidote against those high
distempers, of which the King, and Parliament, and Kingdom do all complain
now, whosoever has been in the fault, or whatsoever has been the true cause
of them. And I cannot conceive why His Majesty's voluntary yielding to this
abridgement of the Right of the Crown, in the point of dissolving of
Parliaments, for the good of his people, should be esteemed more dishonorable
to him, then it was to his most famous Progenitors, to assent to several Laws
for the yearly calling of Parliaments, and other Regulatings of their power for
the same reason.

After the passing of these three Acts to the purpose aforesaid, I do with all
humble submission propound to consideration, Whether His Majesty and the
Parliament may not with Honor securely meet to establish the purity of
Religion, and of the true Worship of God, and right Government of his Church in
such a manner as may be most for his glory, and the peace of his people: To
settle the Rights of the Crown, the Privileges of Parliament, the Freedom of
Elections thereunto, and of proceeding therein, and all other the Liberties of
the Subject in such a manner, that there may never hereafter be any more such
mistakings about them, as we groan under at present. And at the same time hand
in hand to settle such a constant, Royal Revenue upon the Crown, as has been
often promised by this Parliament, and to deliberate, and resolve upon the most
easy, ready, and equal way to raise such sums of money upon emergent
occasions as may be for the security of all the professors of the Protestant
Religion against all Antichristian Power, etc. Which are matters of such
difficulty, and length, that if the Armies now on foot shall be maintained
till they be all agreed by Treaty, the whole Kingdom is in danger of being
ruined before it be concluded.

You have the raving thoughts of a simple Countryman wedded to a solitaty life
in a desert, which he has long and often there revolved in his own mind, and
at length conferred them with diverse wiser men, whose having approved of them
upon their second thoughts, more then at the first, has much confirmed him
that he is in the right, and that encouraged him to take the present occasion,
humbly to recommend them to the serious, and mature consideration of the
Honorable City of London, which has hitherto ever had the honor to settle
the troubles of this Kingdom on that side to which it has inclined; but he is
very jealous it may be in danger to lose now, unless it be reduced to unity in
it self. And if peradventure any part of that he has written should have the
happiness to receive such approbation of so wise a Senate, that they should
think of conveying it higher, he does then further humbly propound, Whether the
Petitioning for a day of most solemn Fast to be specially designed for the
seeking of Gods face in the behalf of this Kingdom (which it has been strange
to him we have hitherto been content to do, by the voluntary devotion of
private men upon the Monthly Fasts, without any public direction from King,
Church or State, as if this Kingdom were an Appendixe of Ireland, and not that
of England) and a Declaration that the monthly Fast is also jointly intended to
be kept for the purpose any other request may be made for the procuring of a
speedy and aforesaid, may not be a fit addition to lasting peace.

For conclusion, since it is the part of wise men, in every business of great
concernment, to fore cast the contrary events may fall out, and the respective
issues of them: I shall only humbly beseech my Lord Major, and the sage Court
of Aldermen, first to anticipate in their thoughts upon the one hand, that it
is not more impossible the Kings Forces should ere long obtain the remainder of
those advantages toward the several Seas, and upon the several Rivers of
this Kingdom, or those other within the Land, which it is apparent they aim
at, then it was for them a while since, to prevail in any of those they have
already gotten; and then to ask themselves what the consequence is like to be,
if the body of the City or Country should grow weary of this war before such a
peace be made, as is desired by all good men, and in reason may be attained
while the affairs stand yet in balance by their means, who by bearing the
greatest purse in this State, may ever have the lowdest voice in all Counsels
to which they shall be admitted. And then upon the other hand to figure to
themselves by strength of imagination, That the Forces of the Parliament have
freed the King from the restraint he is supposed to be in now, and to have him
so freed in their power, and then to put this question to themselves, What use
they can make of this Victory, if his Majesty (who by all that know him, is
known to be the most intelligent, and most resolved King this day living in the
whole Christian world) should by the power of his own understanding continue as
fixed in his resolution, not to make any greater or other alteration in Legibus
Angliae, concerning Church or State, then he has already declared himself
willing to do in his several Answers and Declarations set forth before, and
since the beginning of these troubles, and particularly in His Majesty's Answer
to the Nineteen Propositions, when he was environed with Evil Counselors, and
Cavalliers; And yet more particularly to put these two questions to themselves,
How His Majesty imagined to be in the hands of the Parliaments Forces, shall
be gotten to London against his will: And whether it be for the good of their
City, that His Majesty should for ever make his residence other where,
especially if he should do it upon any alienation of his affection from the
Inhabitants thereof, or any sort of them. After the debating of which matters
within themselves, I shall only take the boldness to exhort them to carry
themselves like wise men; which short word is enough to the wise.

And yet I would not have the Counselors or Cavaliers grow insolent by running
away too fast in their phancies with any of the things I have mentioned. For if
the design or hope of any of them be at last to introduce an Arbitrary
Government, by dissolving this Parliament by force, without the consent of the
Houses, which is Treason by the known Law of the Land, and a Treason
infinitely aggravated by the many public, and I doubt not most sincere
Protestations of his Majesty made to the contrary, they may read their destiny
in the Lord Straffords fortune. Or if there be any of them, who perchance
having as much care as another to preserve the temporal Liberties of the
Subject entire, may yet have a mischievous machination in his head either to
re-introduce a great part of the doctrine and practice of Popery into this
Church under the name of the Protestant profession: or but to hinder such a
further Reformation as is yet necessary for the setting up of the power of
Godliness in the hearts of the people of this Land and of the Kingdom annexed
thereunto, which is to undermine his Throne who is King of kings, and Lord of
lords: let them remember what King David a truly brave Cavalier sung to his
Harp in the first Psalm of his making, He that fitteth in Heaven shall laugh
them to scorn, the Lord shall have them in derision! and that which Solomon
his son, the wisest Counselor that ever was on earth, has left us upon record
in his Proverbs, There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor council against
the Lord. The Horse is prepared against the day of battle; but safety is of
the Lord.

My humble advise therefore to them shall be, that while it is yet time they
would lay the prudent advise of the wise Gamaliel to heart. And now I say unto
you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone. For if this Counsel or this
work be of men, it will come to naught; but if it be of God, ye cannot
overthrow it, least happily ye be found even to fight against God.

FINIS.
