The Constant Maidens Resolution: Or Silver and Gold can^t buy true Love.
Wherein is showed an old man's fondness the maidens constancy unto her dearest
Friend, being a rare pattern for all maids to take example by the same.

To the Tune of, laugh and lie down.




I Am a young Damsel
that is plunged in Woe.
And how to remove it
I do not well know:
My friends they would tie me
unto an Old Man,
That has store of Riches
but love him who can.
It Is not Father nor Mother
my mind shall remove.
For I am resolved
to have him that I love.

There lived a spruce Old Man
near unto this Girl,
Who wooed her and sued her
like Lord or yet Earl,
Of wealth he had plenty
in Riches did swim,
But ^r all he would such dainty
shed not fancy him.
But still she replied
my mind shall not remove,
For, etc.
The Old man. My joy and my Honey
these words then spoke he,
If thou will but set thy
affecion on me,
In Laid I will seat thee
worth thirty a year,
And a house that is worth twenty
i will m^^e it appear.
Then be ^ot so coy Love
althou^h I am old,
For my ^^^e is fervent
and so (...) all hold,

The maid. HAd you never so much Riches
or never so much Gold
You never shall get my
heart in your hold,
For I am resolved
sink or yet svim,
To have the Man I can love
though I do ^eg with him.
For what joy or what comfort
has any young bride,
To have an old sapling
to lie by her side.
Where their's ^auking and spitting
and coughing all night,
Grunting and Groaning
instead of delight:
Scratching and Scrubbing
their Wrinkled Skin,
When Rest should be had
then they are making a din.
And I wonder such old men
as you cannot see,
But will marry young wenches
a Cuckold to be.

The Old Man. My Dearest w^y do thou
despise an Old Man,
That will bravely maintain thee
with Wood and Fan:
Gloves, Ribbous and Scarves
thou daily shall Wear,
Larks, Chickens and Capons
it shall be thy fare,
Thou had bette^ an
Old Man's darling to be,
Then to marry with one
that will never love thee.

The Maid. It Is not your Ric^ dainties
nor your brave ^ttire,
Shall make me co^descend
unto your desire
Where my mind cannot fancy
I Will never be tide,
Although every day in my Coah
I might Ride.
No Gold nor yet, Silver,
my mind, etc.

The Maid. Therefore take your answer
and from me depart.
For I cannot love you
with a serious heart:
No Old Man's Darling
I mean for to be,
Cause Old flesh with young flesh
will never agree.
Come wealth or come woe
my mind, etc.

The Old Man. I Wonder sweet Lady
you should be so strange,
That us Love nor persuasions
your mind it can change:
If you felt but the Torments
the which I abide,
You soon would yield to me
whatever betide.
My hearts so perplexed
all joys from me fly,
To think of thy beauty
I surely shall dye.

The Maid. Fie leave off your doting
you silly Old Sot,
My beauty's like others
therefore praise it not:
I do not regard you
nor pity your moan,
Because that I have a true
love of my own.
And no man on Earth
my mind, etc,
