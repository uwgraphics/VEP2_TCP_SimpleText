The CHURCH in no Danger. A New SONG.
^

I.
WHile Fanatics, and Papists, and Quakers agree,
And the pious Old Cause are promoting,
While the Guardians of England Corrupted will be,
And our S -- s paid for their V --.
While our Reverend Fathers for Schism appear,
And Countenance Schools of Confusion,
It is easy to guess what we justly may fear,
And must be the fatal Conclusion.
II.
While Dissenters are put into Places of Trust,
And Conformity-Bills are Rejected,
While C -- s never think of the Thing that is Just,
And no honest Man's duly E --.
While Volpone's esteemed at St. Germans a Friend,
Yet Governs with Absolute Power,
And may by some ACT of Security send
The Bishops again to the Tower.
III.
While the Scots are in Arms, and prepared to Invade,
With Thousands upon an Occasion,
That are ready to Join 'em Here in the Old Trade,
Of the Covenant and Reformation:
While our Successor still is kept out of the Land,
To our Laws and Religion a Stranger,
By Magnus Apollo let this be Explained,
And the Church in no manner of Danger.
FINIS.
