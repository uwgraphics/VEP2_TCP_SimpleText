A MESSAGE FOR INSTRUCTION, TO All the Rulers, Judges, and Magistrates, to whom
the Law is committed, showing what just Government is, and how far the
Magistrates power reaches, and what the Sword of Justice is to cut down, and
what it is to defend.

Whereby they may learn and be directed to discern betwixt the guiltless and
the guilty; and betwixt a matter of wilful wrong by evil doers, which they
are to punish, and a matter of conscience, by men that fears God, which they
are to be a praise unto, and not a terror; and in particular diverse causes are
discovered; which are proved to be matters of conscience, and not of wilful
wrong; though many therefore are unjustly persecuted and afllicted as evil
doers.

With an exposition of some parts of the Law; for the edification of such, as
desires to judge righteously between man and man, who would discern of
different causes; and justify the Righteous, and condemn the evil doers.

By a friend to righteousness, and a lover of just judgment, who desires the
increase of good Government.

A MESSAGE FOR INSTRUCTION, etc.
Concerning government and Magistracy this I have to say;
IT is an ordinance of God, ordained of him for the preserving of peace among
men, for the punishing and suppressing of evil doers, and for the praise and
safety of them that do well; that men's persons and estates may be preserved
from the violence and wrong dealing of evil men; And for this end government
was ordained of God, to be set up in the earth by the Institution of the Lord;
that righteousness should go free, and the wicked be bound and limited. Now
such as handle the Law, and are executors thereof, who are ordained of God to
judge and govern the people; ought to be just men; fearing God, and walking in
his Law, and hating and denying every false way, that people may receive
examples of righteousness, and holy and lawful walking from their
Conversations; and they that are set to govern the people ought to have the
spirit of true and sound Judgment to try into the root of all causes, whereby
they may be able to discern of different causes; and to give just Judgment in
all things; and such will judge by equal measure for God, and not for man, but
without respect of persons; and such will be a terror to transgressors, and
will strengthen and encourage them that do well; and then the execution of the
Law will answer the end wherefore it was added; for because of transgression
was the law added to slay transgression, and to bind under the transgressor,
and to make him stand in awe and be afraid; for the just law, reaches to the
just witness of God, and answers it in every man, and he that walks in the
law of God, and has his heart therein exercised, the law of man has no power
over him, to condemn him, but it justifies him, and defends him, and preserves
him from all wrong; but who does not walk in the law of God, but is excercised
in evil, and transgresses the light and pure law of God in his conscience by
doing evil and by wrong and unjust dealing; then the law of man takes hold
upon him, and binds him, and judges him, and Condemns him; for the evil done by
him, contrary to the light in his own conscience, which answers to the just
execution of the law in condemning of him: And this is the work of the law in
the hand of faithful executors, who justly executes the just law, in
defending and preserving the just and Innocent men from wrong doing, and in
condemning and judging the ungodly and evil men, for wrong doing; whereby the
witness of God in them both may answer to the Just government in defending the
one, and in condemning the other; and this is a good savor to God where the
just laws are justly executed, by ius^ men, But where unrighteous men are in
power, and the execution of the law in their hands, that are themselves
transgressors, such will not judge for God, but the good laws will be subverted
unto wrong ends, from their proper virtue; and the hands of the wicked will be
strengthened, and the evil doers will escape unpunished, and the Innocent will
suffer, and Justice and true Judgment will be turned backward, for when the
wicked bears rule, the people cannot rejoice, nor Justice and true Judgment
cannot be received from men, who are themselves unjust and unrighteous; for
though the laws may be good and just; yet the executioners thereof being evil,
and themselves transgressors, worthy of condemnation by the law; the
transgression of the law in others cannot justly be Judged by such, who are
themselves guilty of Judgment, and therefore the laws will be subverted, and
justice and true judgment neglected, because such as handle the law knows not
God, but are in the transgression of the righteous law, and of the judgment
thereof are themselves guilty; So therefore they that handle the law should be
men justified according to the law, and free from the transgression; that they
may the more justly punish, reprove and condemn it in others; and may minister
Justice and true Judgment through the law to all people under them; and no man
ought to be respected in Judgment, but every man's cause ought to be heard, the
poor as well as the rich; and their matters diligently sought into, and all
ought to receive just judgment from Just men by the just law; for the law is a
defense about all the righteous, to defend and preserve them; in peace and
freedom, from all their enemies, who are to be limited by the law, as I have
said: And they that are reconciled to God, whose consciences are excercised
toward God in all things, they are not under the law, nor the law has no
power over them, for the law is fullfilled in them, by Christ who teaches them
in all things to walk without offense toward God and all men, in truth and in
righteousness, to God and all men; and such the law of man is to defend and not
to Judge them; to justify them, and not to condemn them; and to be a praise to
them, and not a terror, and such sets to seal that the law is just and good
and holy; who walks in iustness, in goodness and holiness; and does not
transgress the good laws of any nation, but walk void of offense toward all,
for they walk not in the flesh, but in the spirit, and are doers of the law,
and not breakers of it; and so comes not under the guilt of condemnation, in
any thing, but are justified in all things; for the light of Christ leads
them into all truth; and so out of all condemnation; their ways are righteous
and pure, and their works are just and equal toward God and all men* and
they seek not the wrong of any man's person or estate, but seeks the good of
all, forgiving their enemies, and praying for them, and seeks not vengeance
upon their adversaries, but they bear all things patiently, and such are the
servants of God, and not transgressors of his law, nor the just laws of man;
And if such do suffer by a law, that law is unjust, and so is that Magistrate
that executes that law; and that suffering is not for evil doing, but for a
good conscience sake, and the Innocent can rejoice in such suffering, but the
executioners thereof shall howl and weep; So that in all ages there was such
suffering, which was not for evil doing, but for the exercise of a pure
conscience; and such sufferings there are at this day; and this is because the
unrighteous and the unjust bears rule which subverts the law, and turns true
Judgment backward, and oppresses the seed of God, and rules over it in Tyrany;
and this is where darkness rules in the heart, and Ignorance in the mind; and
true Judgment is wanting, for light is called darkness, and darkness light; and
good is put for evil, and evil for good; and truth is called heresy, and
error is called truth; and because of this the righteous are Judged uniustly,
and falsely condemned; and the guilty are set free, and thus is Judgment turned
quite backward; where the seed of enmity rules above the seed of God; and such
a government is not blessed, but made a curse unto that dominion; where it is
seated, and this is because such are set to rule and govern; who are not ruled
and governed by the Lord, but are in the transgression of the Just and
righteous law; and are unjust men, and not reconciled unto God; upon whose
shoulders the government lies, and the execution of the law in their power; who
cannot minister true Judgment, nor discern of different causes among men.

And therefore all magistrates are to weigh and be considerate in all these
things, and so to act and Judge among men, as they may give a good account unto
God and all men; and when a cause is brought before them to give Judgment of,
or any accused unto them; that they should execute the law upon; they should by
the spirit of the Lord first try into the ground and nature of such matters, to
know whether it be a wilful and purposed wrong or injury done between man and
man, or it be of ignorance or want of better knowledge, or such like: or
whether it be a matter of conscience, or about religion, or the worship of God
whereupon the controversy depends, and if it be a matter of wilful and
purposed wrong, or of ignorance, then good reason and justice will teach a
Magistrate to defend the Innocent from wrong, or to restore his wrong by true
judgment, that his person and estate be freed from all wrong, and preserved,
and that the wrong dealer be restrained and punished and judged justly
according to his offense: but if it be a matter of conscience about religion or
the worship of God, then the magistrates with their law ought not to meddle
therein; or to judge of such matters; for these things concerning the things
that are spiritual are out of their Jurisdiction, and not in their power to
judge of; and if the controversy between man and man depend about such causes,
not having reflection upon persons or estates, but only about spiritual
matters, then magistrates with their laws ought not to Judge in these causes;
but spiritual men ought only to give their judgments hereof, as they have
received from God; and though men be in controversy about religion and the
worship of God, yet if they be men of peace not wronging one another in their
persons or estates, they ought to be both protected in a good government by the
just and righteous laws, and here the sword of Justice is laid only upon the
evil doer, to be a terror and a punishment to him, and to limite and restrain
him from wrong dealing, and this is the end wherefore it was ordained of God to
be among men, and not to be laid upon the conscience to oppress and afflict the
tender consciences of the upright; whose minds are exercised in the law of God,
for such should have praise that do well by the sword of Justice while it is a
terror to all evil doers whatsoever, and this is the perfect and wherefore the
law was added, and the practice of it herein by faithful and Just executors,
is well pleasing and acceptable to the Lord.

And now as concerning this one thing, which is oppression in the Nation,
brought forth through the unjust and false execution of the laws, whereby many
tender consciences are afflicted; and not for any wrong or evil doing, but for
the exercise of a pure conscience; Whereas many for conscience sake does deny
and cannot pay any thing, to maintain a steeple-house or place of worship,
which the people of the world do worship in, and where they commit Idolatry,
neither can they for conscience sake pay any thing to uphold such worship, and
such a ministry and ministers, which are not of Christ, nor ever were sent of
him; but of Antichrist and such by which the people are led in blindness and
error, as manifestly does appear through the whole land. And yet the
magistrates some of them being blind and Ignorant as the people, does compel
many people by their Writs and orders and Judgments to maintain a Priest and
steeple-house, which for conscience sake they deny to maintain, and yet by
authority from the magistrates are the Innocent men's goods spoiled by distress,
and great oppression excercised upon many poor people, to maintain and uphold
the ministry and worship of this generation, which is not of God, but against
him, and many hereupon are cast into prison, and others have their goods taken
from them by violence, and great havoc is made in the countries about this
matter, Now first it may be considered that to deny, uphold, and maintain a
steeple-house and place where Ignorant people in tradition do meet to worship;
is not a matter of wilful or purposed wrong dealing, or the breach of any
bargin or contract between man and man, but it is a matter of conscience to the
people of God; and for a good consciencie fake, they cannot do such a thing as
to maintain a place of worship, which abomination is committed in by Ignorant
and rude people, who are without the fear of God, as daily is manifest, and it
is not manifest that by denying of this they Iniure any man's person or estate,
in any thing which belongs unto him by lawful bargin and contract or
otherwise, neither is there any reason or equity in this matter that any should
be forced and compelled by Injustice and oppression to uphold a house of
worship which others worship in, and not they, and they knowing that worship to
be abomination to the Lord also, and not the true worship of the true God, and
their is no Justice nor religion in it, that any should be caused by force to
uphold a house, for other people to commit and practice idolatry in, if the
house were for any good purpose or honest practice, as for poor or impotent
people to dwell in, or such like, who had not houses of their own, because of
their poverty, then that were a deed of charity to uphold it, and the people of
God would not deny it, but could freely give their money to such an use and end;
but because it is not to such an use, but only a place to commit Idolatry in,
and to worship God ignorantly in superstitions; therefore it is a matter of
conscience unto many; and for a good conscience sake, they rather suffer the
spoiling of their goods, and afflictions upon their bodies; then to pay their
money for such an use and end, and herein the Magistrates does great injustice
in the sight of God and his Saints, and contrary to reason and a good
conscience; in causing Innocent men's goods to be spoiled by cruelty to uphold a
place of Idolatrous worship, contrary to men's tender consciences, for as I have
said they do no wrong to any man, but only peoples wills are offended; and
their blind zeal turned into rage and fury against the just, who worships God
in spirit and in the truth, and cannot uphold the houses of false worship; and
it is a shame unto the people and ministers themselves; who cannot uphold their
own worshipping houses, and it is a reproach upon their God and their Religion
who causes others to maintain their worshipping houses; by injustice and great
oppression, and will not themselves maintain the houses where they worship
their God, but people who fear God, are greatly oppressed diverse ways to
uphold worshipping places for others to worship in, as in many parts of this
nation is woeful testimony, which is a shame to the Magistates by whose
authority these things are done; and a great reproach to the very name of
Christanity that people against a pure conscience, and contrary to good reason,
should be compelled to uphold and maintain a worship and ministry which they
do not partake off, but their very enemies that persecute them; whose
consciences are defiled and not excercised; and their worship and ministry,
which stands not in the exercise of a pure conscience, but in vain traditions
and superstitious Idolatry; are the people of God forced to maintain with
maintenance, by oppression contrary to their consciences; and the unjustness of
these things cries for vengeance from heaven upon the ungodly rulers and
people; who causes the just and upright to groan by oppression; and thus the
law is subverted, contrary to that end wherefore it was added; and the
government is abused contrary to that purpose wherefore it was ordained of God;
for the guiltless are condemned and judged, and the guilty are set free; the
exercise of pure consciences are oppressed, and the false abominations and
Idol worships are strengthened and defended; and because of these things is
the wrath of God kindled, and shall not be quenched, till it have consumed the
wicked from off the face of the earth, that the just God may be feared, and his
people enjoy their freedom and liberty in the practice of the pure religion,
and the exercise of their pure consciences; and this will the Lord bring forth
in his appointed time according to his promise; that his people may rejoice in
him over all their oppressors, and cruel taskemasters which does uniustly
oppress the seed of God.

And as concerning the maintaining of Ministers, it is the same in nature, and
as unjust and unequal as upholding of worshipping houses; for though many out
of a good conscience do deny to maintain a professed Minister by paying to him
so much or such a sum, yet they do not hereby wrong him wilfully, contrary to
right, in breaking any contract or Covenant, formerly made with him by
themselves or predecessors: nor they do not withhold from him any thing which
properly belongs to him as debt, or due for his labor; by any Covenant binding
thereunto; only the most that can be said is, that such a sum, or gift was
formerly given* out of that estate to a man belonging to such a Parish; and
therefore now it is claimed as due, by custom of many generations practice,
and so ought to be done; as the maintenance to that man because of his labor
in his Ministry; now to this I answer, what though it was formerly done, such a
sum paid, and such a gift freely given by our Ancestors in the times of
Ignorance and darkness; that practice of theirs then does not bind any now to
do the same, seeing no record can appear that they bound themselves and their
heirs for ever so to do; and now has the clear light of the gospel sprung
forth, and the light of the day has discovered all the works of Ignorance;
and though the man that claims such a gift or hire as debt to him because of
his labor, let them pay him, for whom he does labor; and who does partake of
his Ministry and labor, and let others be free, who for conscience sake,
cannot do it; who knows his labor not deserving of wages, but to be deceit
and abomination, and deceiving of souls; and sees himself to be a proud,
covetous man, and an Idle person; who maintains himself by the fruit of other
men's labors, in the vanity of life and without the fear of the Lord, and this
makes the thing a matter of conscience to many, that for no better use nor to
no other end, they should pay their money, (which cannot be justly claimed as a
just debt, but as a gift at most) to the upholding of such men and such
practices, which are not according but contrary to God, in labor, life, and
practice, and to uphold and maintain a man as a Minister of Christ which is not
so, but the contrary as by his fruits is made manifest, and that in ministry
and worship, which is not the worship and ministry of the true God, but the
contrary as does appear, this many of the people of God cannot do for a good
conscience sake, except they should transgress the light of Christ and the law
of God, in their own hearts and consciences, and so bring themselves into
condemnation by the Lord; so let all men take notice hereof, that though the
people of God do deny to pay any thing to uphold and maintain such a worship
and such ministers, which are not the ministers of Christ, nor the worship of
the true God; but rather gives their goods to the spoyler and their bodies to
the prison; yet this is only for the exercise of a good and pure conscience,
and not out of wilful wrong and injury; and their suffering is not as they are
evil doers, but as they are Saints for a good conscience sake, because they
cannot be subject to the wills of unjust men in upholding and maintaining such
things against their consciences; but are willing rather to suffer then to
offend the Lord, and their own consciences, neither is there good reason or
equity in it; nor any part of a good conscience; that people by injustice
should be compelled to maintain a minister whom they know is not the minister
of Christ by his fruits and effects and works and practices, and so are forced
against their own conscience to uphold a man in pride, in idleness, in
coveteousness and in a vain and evil life, by unrighteous wages, now if their
money were to maintain a man that's poor, or if that man had not of his own
sufficiently to preserve his wife and Children from want, then it were a work
of charity to give something if it were every year or oftener, to maintain him
and his family, and the people of God would not refuse to give something for
this end, no man should compel them nor have cause to spoil their goods for
it, but as he professes himself a minister of Christ, and a labourer in the
gospel, but is not so, but lives in pride and the vanities of this world, upon
such an account they cannot maintain him nor give him any thing at all with a
safe conscience, neither is there any reason in it that they should for they
receive not his ministry, neither does hear him, neither does own him as a
minister of Christ, nor does not partake of his labors, nor does not set him
on laboring, and this is greatly unjust that any man should pay or be
compelled to pay (by force and oppression,) wages to a man as his labourer and
as his servant who does not at all labor for him, or do him any service,
neither does the man partake of his works or labors, neither has any benefit
thereby, but rather loss and disadvantage because of his labors, which he does
for others, and not for him, nor by any order from him; for he knows his
labouts to be nothing but vanity, and a cheat and deceiving of people, and for
him to be compelled to maintain such a man, in such ill employment against his
conscience, this is unjust and unreasonable; and what man in the world would do
it or be compelled thereunto, without crying out of great oppression; as to
maintain a man with great wages, as his labourer and servant who does not
labor for him, nor serve him, but labors against him as much as is possible;
and this is the very cause, between the Priests of England in their maintenance
in claiming of it, and receiving of it, and the people of the Lord who does
deny to maintain them; or confess any lawful due they have to challenge any of
them. And also it is a very shame to the people of this Nation for whom such
ministers do labor, who cannot maintain their own ministers themselves, who
labors for them, and of whose labors they do partake, but others are
compelled by injustice, to maintain them, who does not partake of any of their
labors, nor set them to labor, but denies them and their labor on that
account, and yet are forced to pay them wages; and this is unjust and
unreasonable, that men should be constrained by force to pay other men's
servants, which works and labors for other and not for them; and what man in
the world having reason in him, would do it or be forced to do it, without
complaining of heavy injustice as to maintain another man's servant with wages,
who works for others, and not for him, neither was hired by him, nor set on
work nor receives any benefit by him, but another hires him and partakes of
his labors, and yet he is compelled against all reason, and equity to give him
his wages; all will conclude this were unjust and not according to God but
against him; and this is the very cause between the people of God, who cannot
pay to maintain false teachers and the people of the Nation, who hires such
teachers and receives of their labors and teaching and yet compells others to
give them wages, contrary to good reason and Justice, and against the exercise
of a pure conscience, And above all the magistrates blindness and Ignorance,
and the uniustness and wickedness of some of them does appear, to their shame,
by whose authority these things are done, reaching out their power in those
things, further than they have received power from God, and abusing the law and
just government, and subverting it to another end than wherefore God has
ordained it; for the magistrates power and authority, is not to be laid on men's
consciences to oppress and Imbondage the tender consciences of the lords
people; in forcing things to be done contrary to good reason and against a good
conscience; and by these things is the land filled with violence and
oppression, and the Innocent and just does deeply groan; till the Lord arise to
plead their cause, and to bring deliverance unto them, through the destruction
of all their enemies; and he will break down all the bonds of cruelty and
oppression, and will take away every yoke that does burden and oppress the
upright, that his people may be a free people, from all unjust men, and the
people of the Lord does claim this as their privilege, belonging to them by
the just Laws of God and men, to worship God in spirit and in truth, and to
uphold and maintain that worship only, without being compelled by force to
maintain any other whatsoever, and they claim as right unto them to maintain
what Ministers, and uphold what ministry, as they know is sent of God, by which
people are profited, and which they have received the knowledge of God through
by his spirit, and to be free to maintain how and as the Lord leads them unto,
without being forced by any Law, or unequal authority, to maintain the false
Prophets and hirelings, and deceivers, who lives in pride and excess, through
the oppression of the poor and innocent, and such (as Ministers of the Gospel
of Christ,) the people of the Lord cannot maintain, but rather gives
themselves to suffer heavy and cruel things by unjust and wicked men, who
violates the just Laws of God and man; and the suffering is for a good
conscience sake, and for righteousness sake, and not for any wrong or evil
doing, and for a testimony that they are of God, and for a witness against
their enemies, that they are of the Devil; who does his works, and these makes
war against the Saints and the Lamb, and the Beast seeks to kill all that will
not worship him, for he has been great in the earth, and his seat upon
Nations, and who has been able to make war against him, for many generations:
again there is another suffering great and grievous which is unjustly laid
upon the people of God, which suffering is not for evil doing, but for a good
conscience sake as is manifest; as because many are moved of the Lord by his
spirit, to go into the Steeple Houses and meeting places, or other places to
reprove sin, and among people, or to exhort them unto good, and to follow
Christ, and to deny the wickedness of this world, or such like, as they are
moved, some are moved to reprove a hireling teacher, who deceives the people,
and walks in the steps of the false Prophets, and lives in pride and vanity and
evil, contrary to the doctrine and practice of Christ and the Apostles, and
this practice of the servants of the Lord in reproving evil and exhorting to
good, is called a disturbance of the peace, and an unlawful practice, and such
like; it is falsely judged by unjust men* who knows not the spirit of the Lord,
nor the moving thereof, and because of this, many innocent men are caused
deeply to suffer, contrary to a good conscience, and some are sent to the house
of Correction, there suffering cruel things from hard-hearted men, and some
are put in the Stocks and whipped, and others fined and cast into prison, and
such like sufferings are unjustly imposed upon them, and not for evil doing,
as I have said, for though they reprove sin in teachers or in people, or
exhorts them to good, whether in Steeple Houses, Markets or other places, yet
they do not hereby wrong any man's person or estate; neither is this any matter
of wilful wrong, or to such an intent, neither does it disturb the peace, nor
is any unlawful practice; but only out of a good conscience to God and man,
is it done; and it is a matter of conscience to the servants of the Lord, to do
so, and they cannot leave it undone least they should transgress the law of God
in their own consciences; because they are commanded of God so to do, that
people may be Instructed in the right way to God, and be converted out of every
false way; and this is the very end, of their work and their intent in doing
it; and they ought not in justice to suffer for it, for it is according to the
law of God, and in reason and a good conscience, and the Lord justifies them in
it, then that law and Judgment must needs be corrupt and unjust, which
condemns the people and servants of the Lord, as for evil doers, for obeying
the commands of God and for the exercise of their pure consciences, and no man's
person or estate being wronged or Injured but only sin and wickedness reproved
and exhorted from; And hereby thus is the law perverted, and true Judgment
turned backward, and the guiltless is condemned guilty, and the guilty is set
free; and the obeying the commands of God and the exercise of a good
conscience is unjustly judged a transgression; and this is a shame, and will be
great condemnation to such, in the day of the Lord by whose Authority this is
done; even that the exercise of a good conscience, even reproving of sin and
exhorting unto that which is good* to follow that and to forsake all evil;
should be judged and punished as a hanious transgression in a nation and
Commonwealth professing Christianity and pure Religion; and this makes the sin
much more great and unpardonable, because the practice and faithful exercise
in Christianity, and in the pure and true Religion, is adjudged transgression
and condemned by such who professes the same thing in words, and yet persecutes
and punishes the exercise of it in others; and this shows them unjust judges
and hypocrites; who causes the Servants of the Lord to suffer; for the practice
of that which themselves profess in words, to wit Religion and Christianity,
for I affirm against all opposers whatsoever, that it is, a practice in
Religion according to the Scriptures, to go into the Steeple Houses, meeting
places, Markets, Highways, or other places, and reprove sin and wickedness, and
cry against evil in Priests and people, and exhort to good and to forsake
evil, and therefore it ought not to be prosecuted and punished, but defended
and maintained, by the just Government of a Commonwealth, and by just Laws and
Magistrates; for this the Lord requires that justice and truth, and true
judgment be exalted, and the innocent and upright defended, in all their ways
of a good conscience, and that evil doers and sinners and transgressors, be
condemned and righteously judged.

Also many of the servants of the Lord do deeply suffer, and is deeply
afflicted by injustice, for the exercise of a good conscience in other things,
as because they cannot put off their Hats and bow in respect to men's persons,
according to the vain customs of the Heathen, and because they cannot swear
upon a Book, by kissing it and laying the hand upon it according to the
idolatrous form, and for such like causes, because many cannot fulfill the
lusts and wills of men, that lives in pride and evil ways, in these and other
things, therefore are the people of God put to great sufferings, though they
deny not the honor due to all men in the Lord, without bowing the Hat, nor to
affirm the truth in every cause, in faithfulness without an oath; now to keep
on the Hat, which is a cover for the head, to keep from cold or heat for
healths sake, before any man whatsoever, though never so great or noble, is not
any wrong or injury to the man's person or estate before whom it is done, but
only the high mind and the proud nature, and that which is exalted above the
fear of God, which would be Lord over his fellow creatures, that same is
offended and troubled, which bears not the image of God, but of the Devil, as
Hamman was, and would be bowed to, and had in honor, and respected, because of
knowledge or parts, and proud gestures or apparel, and the Children of the
Lord cannot do it, nor give honor to him, nor be subject, and pleasing to
that man, who is of that spirit and of that nature which is not of God, but
exalted in pride, and vainglory above the fear of God and against him, and
would be worshipped, and had in honor and reverenced of his fellow creatures,
who has not so much riches in this world as he, nor is so proud in apparel as
he, and because of that he looks to be bowed unto with Hat or Knee, and is
offended if he be not, and then in his pride he rages and is vexed, and seeks
revenge against such as cannot honor him, and respect him in his pride and
vainglory; but as I said this is not done as a matter of wrong unto any,
though the Hat be not bowed or put off, but it is a matter of conscience unto
the people of God, and for a good conscience sake they do deny, and may not
give obedience, and honor, and respect, out of the fear of God, to proud
flesh, and to men which is not in the fear of God, which expects reverence out
of the Lord, and they know it is nothing else that is offended but proud flesh
and an exalted mind, and a man that fears not God, neither walks in his ways; I
say it is nothing else nor any besides, that is offended or troubled, because
the hat is not put off and bowed, and the people of God are not careful to
please or offend, that in men, and men as such* for they know nothing of God,
nor any man that truly fears God will be offended at the want of a hat bowed to
him, and thus it is a matter of conscience unto many, and for a good conscience
sake they do deny to honor and subject themselves by obedience to any man, as
he is a man out of the fear of God, and in the glory of the vain world;
expecting reverence out of the fear of God, and contrary to his Law, which
forbids the respect to persons, and all honor which is not according to God;
for who does fear to offend a man, as a man without the fear of God, and does
obey and honor any man, by putting off the Hat before him or otherwise, and
not only in the Lord; such are servants to the wicked one, and not unto God;
who fears the wrath of the wicked, and subjects in honor to please the wicked
by putting off and bowing the Hat and such like; and such knows not the
exercise of a pure conscience to God; so this is a matter of conscience to
deny to honor, and to please wicked men, as such, by bowing the Hat, and no man
in justice ought to be made to suffer because of it, for the Law of God
justifies it, and that Law and judgment is corrupt, and perverted which
condemns it,

And likewise though many deny to swear at all; though not to testify the
truth, yet they do not wilfully wrong hereby to any man's person or estate, but
it is a matter of conscience unto them, and with a good conscience they cannot
swear, but does deny it upon all conditions, because Christ has commanded not
to swear at all, and the Apostle does exhort above all things not to swear; and
therefore it is a matter of conscience unto many and not a matter of purposed
wrong toward any man, and though here it may be objected; But for want of oath
a just man may loose his just cause, because judgment depends upon witness by
oath; to that I answer, that is because, the Law is not according to Christ, by
which the judgment comes, but is uniustly grounded upon the breach of Christ's
command, viz. swearing, and whether ought the man to be blamed or condemned as
a transgressor, who keeps Christ's command and cannot swear at all upon any
terms, or whether that Law ought not to be corrected and regulated to be
according to the Law of Christ, and all that which is contrary in the execution
thereof to be condemned and removed; that a just man's witness may be given and
taken upon occasion without an oath; and his just cause may go on against his
enemies by just judgment, grounded upon the naked truth in plainess testified
without swearing, this is to be considered, and though it be again objected,
but many, say some makes more conscience and are more afraid to testify falsely
upon oath, then upon bare words without an oath, so to have the truth known
wholly, that is the end of the oath; to this I answer, a man that truly and
uprightly fears God, will be as much afraid and make as much conscience of
speaking falsely, as of swearing falsely, and out of a good conscience will
testify as truly, as if he swore, and for others who fears to swear falsely,
and does not so much fear to speak falsely without oath, this is because there
is a greater punishment to such, and it is accounted a greater offense among
men, to swear falsely then to speak falsely, and for the correcting of that the
punishment and offense should be changed, and such as testify falsely without
oath, may be accounted offenders and punished, as such who swears falsely, and
this will bind the wicked in a sufficient fear, and cause them to be afraid, of
testifying falsely, even as much as of swearing falsely, if the testimony in
causes among men, of such evil persons who cannot make conscience of lying;
nor speak the truth without swearing, it ought the rather to be had, and to be
done, by binding by a Law and punishing, if he testify a lie, then by causing
him to continue in the breach of Christ's command; but however still I say such
who out of a good and tender conscience, do deny to swear, ought not to be
persecuted and punished as great offenders; for while this is done, the Law and
good Government is perverted, and authority is greatly abused, to another end
then wherefore it was ordained of God, and that Law and authority must needs be
unjust which oppresses or punishes the exercise of a good conscience, as for
evil doing, and this shows the blindness and ignorance of men in authority to
whom the Law is committed who discerns not, neither makes a difference betwixt
things done in the fear of God, and in the exercise of a good conscience
toward him, and things done out of an evil mind to evil intents, purposely
and wilfully to wrong and injury men's persons and estates; for all Magistrates
ought to learn this and to distinguish, that their power and authority may
justify the one, and condemn the other, that true justice and sound judgment,
may spring forth in the earth, and in the Nations, that all the upright and
well doers may rejoice, and live in rest and peace, and all the workers of
iniquity, and such as do evil may be afraid, and fear to offend just men and
just Laws, and thus would the name of the Lord be great in the earth among men;
and such a Government renowned for ever, and such Magistrates would be a praise
to generations after them; and a blessed example to ages to come; But now some
may say and object, how shall this be known, and who can tell and discern of
such causes, and who it is that does their works, out of the exercise of a
good conscience, and who does their deeds out of an evil mind and to an evil
intent, and so is wrong dealing, and worthy of punishment, this is a doubtful
cause may some say, and difficult to be known and understood; But to this I
answer and say, To all such as have the spirit of the Father, and are led
thereby, and in their judgment guided therewith; this is an easy thing to
discern, and an easy matter to know and find out, and such as cannot discern
and distinguish in such matters, has not the spirit of God, nor the spirit of
true and sound judgment, neither is indeed ordained of God, nor fit to judge
the people, nor the honor of a ruler and judge, belongs not to such a one who
cannot find out a matter, nor know and judge between the precious and the vile;
how to justify the one and how to condemn the other; and indeed this is the
reason, and cause of so much injustice and oppression brought forth at this
day; because the spirit of sound judgment is wanting, and such as are set to
judge has it not, to try and discern and give judgment by it, and therefore,
light is put for darkness, and darkness for light, and good is called evil and
evil good, and true justice and judgment is perverted and turned backward,
and the guiltless is condemned guilty. But I say, if the work be done by a man,
out of a good conscience, and as a matter of conscience, then he does it in the
fear of God, and in the Cross to his own will, and in meekness and tenderness
of heart, not seeking himself in what he does, but is willing to suffer for the
truths sake, and for what he does, and will not resist evil, or the false
judgments of men; but patiently and quietly bears all things; for the Lords
sake, and in all what he does or suffers, he gives the glory to the Lord, who
works his works in him, and gives him strength and patience willing to suffer
for them; But again I do answer, by men that has the spirit of sound
judgment to rule and guide them; this cause is easy to be discerned, and the
difference may be known, betwixt a thing done out of a good conscience, and for
a good conscience sake, and a thing done out of an evil mind and purpose and
to an evil end, to the wrong and injury of another, for the ground from whence
the works do proceed, are contrary, and the spirit by which the works are
wrought, are contrary, and the purpose and end to which they are wrought are
contrary, and the spirit of God and of sound judgment, may and does put a
difference betwixt the ground, acting, and end of all works, for it is the
ground from whence all works does spring, and the end unto which they are
brought forth, that makes all men's works good or evil, to be justified or to
be condemned, and where the measure of the spirit and power of God, is the
ground of, and leader, in a work, that work as I have said, is done in the fear
of God, and in uprightness of heart and in love and tenderness, and meekness
and patience, without seeking or exalting self, but the glory of the Lord is
only sought by that man in all such his works; But on the contrary, where an
evil heart and mind, brings forth works to an evil end, and to the wrong of
others such works, are maliciously and wilfully, and enviously, and peevishly
done, in frowardness, and headiness, and not in the fear of God nor in
uprightness of heart; but with a double mind and in secret, or without the
Counsel of God, seeking himself in his works, and not the Lord, and such works
are wicked, and wrought by wicked men who transgresses both the Law of God and
of men; and must receive according to their deeds; and the Law that is equal
must pass upon them which the light of Christ in their own consciences, may
answer to, when they are condemned for their ungodly works; against which light
they act, and that is the reason and cause, wherefore their works are evil,
and to be condemned by the Law; for who acts according to the light of
Christ, and is led thereby, fulfilleth the Law, or it is fulfilled in him; and
his works are wrought in God, and are the testimony unto men that he is of a
good conscience, and for a good conscience sake his works are done, and such
men and works are not to be condemned but justified; And this is for
instruction to all them that bear rule, who are Magistrates and Governors, and
Judges of the people, that they may now be wise and learn wisdom, how to
judge righteously and justly among the people, that they may fulfill the will
of God, in what he has called them unto, even that they may cherish and defend
and strengthen such as do well, and all whose pure consciences are purely
excercised, may live in peace and rest under such a Government, and all evil
doers may be bound, limited and judged, and may stand in awe and be afraid, and
thus justice and true judgment would be advanced, and equity would run down as
a mighty stream; and the Nation would be blessed, and yield content and
satisfaction to her Inhabitants; and hereby might the Rulers and Judges gain
unto themselves a good report, and an honor and renown would the Lord Crown
them with all in generations to come.

Wherefore all ye Rulers, and all ye that are set to judge the people, be now
awakened to just judgment, and to a sound discerning, and put on the spirit of
true judgment, even the spirit of the Lord that you may receive it, to be
taught in all things, how to walk with God, that you may answer his call, and
the end of your authority, in judgeing justly all sorts of men, rendering to
every man according to his deeds, even condemnation and judgment to evil
doers, and a praise and defense, to all that do well, and this is written in
love to you all; showing you how to put a difference betwixt the precious and
the vile, and between the just and unjust, that you may be the more happy if
this you observe, not leaving your names a reproach and a scorn to after-ages,
which is the effect, which does follow, all such as perverts Justice, and turns
true judgment backward, with misery and destruction, upon themselves and
posterity, for evermore*

A true and faithful Exposition of some part of the Laws of England.
ALl ye Magistrates, Justices of the Peace, Mayors, and all other Ministers of
the Law, and all ye to whomsoever the Law is committed, I do warn you all to
take heed to your selves, that ye fulfill the will of the Lord in iudgeing
righteously, and executing true justice and judgment, and let not envy, nor
false suspicions, nor iealousies have any place in you, but with a single eye
try all things, and with an upright heart judge for God, and not for man; and
beware of causing the innocent to suffer, whose consciences are exercised
toward God, though they be contrary to the world in their ways, and judgments,
for if you cause such to suffer, you do not execute true judgment, but
subverts the Law, and the Lord will require that suffering of his people at
your hands. Now consider the Law was not made for a righteous man, but for
transgressors, such whose consciences are not exercised toward God, and such
your sword is to be laid upon, to be a terror to them, and not to the
innocent; for they should have praise that do well; and you must take heed,
least you abuse your power to another end, then wherefore God has ordained it;
for the Law was added because of transgression to slay the transgressour, and
that is the end of the Law; Now you must take heed of causing any to suffer
upon bare suspicion or evil iealousies, when as no transgression is truly
charged, nor justly proved against them before you, and you are not to be both
accusers, and Judges of any one, in any cause.

You have a late act for the taking up, and punishing of idle, loose, and
dissolute persons, such as are vagrants, and wandering Rogues, vagabonds, and
sturdy beggars; Now this Law is good, if it be duly and justly executed upon
such as are truly guilty herein; and it is right that sturdy Beggars, and
Rogues, and idle and disorderly persons, should be taken up from wandering, and
set on work in some good employment in the Creation, which may maintain
themselves, and prevent them from worse things; But now you must take heed of
judging any to be such, who are not really so; for many of the servants of the
Lord now, as it was in generations past, are moved to leave their own Country
and dwellings, and relations, and go abroad in the Nations to preach the
Gospel of Christ; and to bear witness of his name in the world, to the turning
of people from the ways of sin and death, to the way of righteousness and
truth; and it may be such cannot give you an account or sufficient cause of
their traveling abroad (so as to satisfy you) For that is lawful in the
sight of God, which you may not judge to be so; for Gods ways are not man's
ways; neither his thoughts; as man's thoughts; Therefore I say unto you; if you
cause any such of the servants of the Lord to suffer by that Law; you abuse
your power; and subverts the Law; for such are not vagabonds, nor idle
dissolute persons, nor Rogues, nor sturdy beggars; No more than Christ was; who
had no where to lay his head; and the Prophets and Apostles were, some of which
had no certain dwelling place, but left their Countries and relations, and
wandered up and down the world from town to town; and from one Country to
another, even as the servants of the Lord does by the same spirit at this day,
who can no more be truly judged for Vagabonds and Rogues, etc. than Christ and
his Apostles could be, who were a perfect example to us in these things; For it
is a lawful occasion in the sight of God, whatever you judge of it, to travel
up and down (not being burdensome, or chargeable to any) to bear witness for
the name of the Lord, and against all sin and iniquity, that people may be
reformed, and instructed in the right way; Therefore you must make a special
distinction in your judgments between such as are Rogues, and idle and
dissolute persons, who are hurtful to the Creation, and such as are innocent
and harmeless, and not of evil behavior, (though you may through prejudice
otherwise judge of them) this is to inform you herein, that your judgments
may be according to God, and not according to man, neither with respect of
persons.

Also you have another late Act for the Observation of the Lords day, wherein
is inserted that none shall wilfully, maliciously, or of purpose disturb, or
disquiet the public preacher, or to make any public disturbance in the
Congregations; Now the Law is good, and it is right that all such be punished,
who does maliciously, wilfully, or of an evil purpose disturb, or disquiet
any man or people, to the danger of breach of public peace, and let all such
be punished according to their desert; But yet you must take heed in this
cause, for many of the servants of the Lord are, and may be moved by the power
of the Lord to come into a Congregation, or an assembly of people to declare
against sin and iniquity, and the ways of wickedness in people, or to ask a
question soberly of the teacher, or to instruct people to edification in the
way of the Lord, or such like may they do, as they are moved, and yet not
maliciously, nor wilfully, nor of wicked purpose; For it was the Apostles
practice, and the practice of the Saints to go in the Synagogues and meeting
places, and to dispute with the Teachers on the Sabbath days, and sometimes
they spoke to the people by way of exhortation, and the people bid them speak
on; and yet these were not disturbers of the assembly, neither were they
malicious men, or wilful, neither did they these things to any evil purpose,
and it was the practice of the Saints, that all may speak one by one in the
Church, when they were assembled together; and this is the practice of the
servants of the Lord now, and yet they cannot justly be condemned by your Law,
though they come into your assembly, as they are moved of the Lord, to object
or reprove, or exhort, for they do it not in malice toward any, but in love
toward all, and they can no more justly be condemned than the Apostles, and
Saints in the Primitive times, who were unto us a just example in these
practices, as you may read in the Scripture; and you may as justly condemn
them, as us, who are guided by the same spirit in the same things; Therefore
you have need to take heed of condemning the innocent by a Law, least you bring
innocent blood upon you; and you must make a perfect difference between such as
comes among you, wilfully and maliciously, and on evil purpose to disturb,
and molest any man, or Congregation, and such who comes in the name and fear of
the Lord, who are moved of him contrary to their own wills, and in love to all
people; And in these causes you have need of discerning and sound judgment,
least you condemn the guiltless, and abuse your power, and subvert the Law, and
so bring condemnation upon your selves; And as you will answer it before the
Lord in his dreadful day; cause not any to suffer through your envy, and
surmizings or false suspicion, through overreaching the words of the Law to a
wrong sense, and to a wrong end.

Also it is inserted in the same Act against many evil things, as drinking in
Taverns, Innes, Alehouses, strong-water houses, or to tipple unnecessarily, or
any other house, etc* and also against traveling, and walking on that day
vainly and profanely, etc. Now the Law is good that evil exercise be
prevented, and profaneness in every respect on that day, and on every day, and
that such be punished that are found in any evil exercise whatsoever; But yet
you must take heed that none of the innocent suffer hereby; for many of the
people of God may, and does travel on that day to meet together to worship
God, and to wait upon him, to find his presence, and to receive of his
refreshments to their souls, But this cannot be judged an evil practice, or
profane traveling, or breach of the Sabbath; For we read of a Sabbath days
journey, Acts 1. and 12. where some of the servants of the Lord returned from
Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, which is a Sabbath days iourny, so that such, who
now travels to wait upon the Lord on that day, though it be several miles to,
and from the place of meeting, cannot justly be judged to be Sabbath Breakers,
no more than the Apostles, who traveled a Sabbath days journey in obedience to
the Lord to wait upon him; So that you must take heed* and make a noted
distinction betwixt such who travels on a profane, and an evil exercise* or
about the affairs of this world, and such who travels on a good exercise to
wait upon the Lord and to serve him; For the Law it self excepts such from
being taken up, or judged Sabbath Breakers; So take heed that you subvert not
the Law, and abuse your power through false judgment, through your own envy,
and so you smite the guiltless, and brings destruction upon your selves; For
herein we own the Law of God to walk by, and the Apostles for an example,
though we may suffer uniustly by you.

Also there is a late Act for discovering and repressing of Popish Recusants,
by presenting, to such as are suspected to be Popish, or Popishly affected, an
oath, as is therein described; to renounce the Popes authority, and to deny all
his Doctrines, and to testify against the authority of the Church of Rome, and
against any license given thereby, to bear Arms or raise tumults, or by
violence to hurt the chief Magistrate, or Government of these Nations, etc. And
such as denies the taking of that oath are to be adjudged Popish Recusants, and
to be proceeded against accordingly; Now that Law is good that such, who are
adherent to the Pope, and by his authority would raise Armies and tumults, and
offer violence to the hurt of the chief Magistrate, or Government, or people of
these Nations, etc. As it is signified in the said Oath, should be discovered
and repressed; But yet you must take heed, and wait for sound judgment in the
prosecution of the same: For all are not to be condemned that cannot swear or
take an Oath; For many of the servants of the Lord, who are followers of
Christ, cannot swear for conscience sake, because Christ has commanded not to
swear at all, Though such does deny the Pope and all his authority and
doctrines, and whatsoever else is signified in that Oath, who cannot justly be
suspected to be any way adherent to the Pope in Doctrines or practices, except
through wicked envy you seek occasion against them thereby, and you abuse your
power and subverts the Law, If you judge such to be Popish Recucusants, because
they will not swear, because they cannot for conscience sake, but walks in
Christ's doctrine, who commanded not to swear, and follows the Apostles example,
who said above all things my Brethren swear not at all, and such cannot justly
be suspected or judged for Popish Recusants; who are followers of Christ, and
keeps his commands; Therefore you must be considerate, and search deep into
those things that are thus weighty, least you cause the guiltless to suffer,
and thereby vex the Lord against your selves; and you must make a special
difference betwixt such as will not swear because they are guilty, and such as
cannot swear for conscience sake, though they are not guilty, but clear, and
free in the sight of the Lord of such things, as may be falsely suspected, and
charged against them by envious men, which may watch for evil, and give
Informations against the people of God unto you; But let your eye be single in
all these things, that you may save your selves from wrath, and condemnation,
which will be a reward of all such, who subverts good Laws to a wrong end, and
seeks to cover themselves in their persecution of the innocent by making the
Law a Cloak, But such coverings will not hide in the day of the Lord.

And my friends in the execution of these and other Laws, let the fear of God
guide you, and true judgment and found discerning, that you may try into the
nature and ground of every thing, and may not judge only by outward
appearance, but judge righteous judgment; And this is a great transgression in
the sight of the Lord at this day, even the false execution of good Laws, and
the subversion of them to wrong ends and uses by some wicked men, who are in
authority, to whom the Law is committed: and this we know by experience; Be the
Law never so just and good, yet if the executioners of the Law be unjust and
unrighteous, True justice and judgment is turned backward, and for want
thereof the harmless, and innocent daily suffers, which kindles and increases
the fierce anger of the Lord against these Nations.

And likewise all you that are in power and authority, you ought not to command
any thing of any man, which the Law gives you no power to command, for doing
so, you make your selves transgressors, as for instance, you have no power by
any Law to command men to put off their Hats, when they come before you,
neither by any Law can you justly punish them, if they do it not, neither can
you justly punish such by any law, who denies to swear because for conscience
sake they cannot; But what has been inflicted upon some in such cases has
been by will and malice, and not by any law, and the Lord does account such
thing against the wicked, who causes such sufferings; and of these things I
have given you warning, and it is in perfect love unto you all, as to inform
you truly, least you cause the innocent to suffer.

I am a real friend to the Commonwealth, and a lover of justice and true
judgment, and fully affected toward just Government, and wishes well to
Magistrates. E. B.
