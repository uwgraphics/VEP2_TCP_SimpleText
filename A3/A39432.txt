By the Kings most Excellent Majesty, and the Lords of His Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Council.
WHereas His Majesty by His late Royal Proclamation, bearing date the Thirtieth

on or before the Seventh day of this instant November, from His Majesty's Royal
Palaces of Whitehall, Somerset House, S. James, the Cities of London and
Westminster, and from all other Places within Ten miles distance of the same;
His Majestly upon further Consideration, was Graciously pleased to Declare in
Council, That the said Proclamation was not meant to extend to any Merchants
Strangers of the Romish Religion, residing in or near this City, upon account
of Trade, who in all times past have had the freedom of remaining here, so as
they give in their Names, and Places of Habitation respectively, to the Lord
Mayor of the City of London, within Six days after notice of this Order;
Neither to Strangers (other then Popish Priests and Jesuits) who out of
curiosity come into this Kingdom as Travelers, so as they give in their Names,
together with the Places where they Lodge, within Six days after the date of
these Presents, or after their Arrival here, to one of His Majesty's Principal
Secretaries of State; But that such Merchants Strangers and Foreiners as
aforesaid, have the same Liberty of residing at, or coming to the Places above
mentioned, as if the aforesaid Proclamation had never been Issued.
