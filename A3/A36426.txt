THE SERPENTS Excommunication.

In ESSEX where cutting down a Wood, diverse of these Sprouts of the Warlike
Ash, or Branches grew.



John 3. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness more then light. Printed in the Year, 1651.

Caeli Jubilate, etc. July, Anno 1651.
Their Sealed Pardon.
ALl join in Consort him to praise,
ye roaring Sea and Earth:
Not silent, lo with Tree(...)s wild,
yield loud extolling mirth.
Yea all his works in* places all,
whose goodness has no end,
Diverts his presence not, which does
from age to age descend.
Magnificat, a Song full New,
who has his wonders shown:
Vipers before visible such,
Witness, the like unknown.
Fiery Serpents in likeness whose.
a Generation fresh:
Fuel a Judgment bids beware
the Rod: betokens no less.
To stiff Necks all, stopping the Ear,
more Pharaohs Sirs then one:
Extol him then ye Tokens and Signs,
a second Egypt grown.
A fresh as though him Crucified:
bound with the heavy Belt:
Pierced with Males: The Millstone like
as much; such Hearts do melt.
Poor folk, informed though Moses were
and Christ on Earth again:
No want of Faith; such Manna now
but froath, worth not a Grain.
The Tree (reserved) of Life it is dead,
poisoned, thus cold and young:
Ensign of Peace, a Brazen ONE,
figured to look upon.
The second Part.
LO on a pole, a living Tree,
Moses as made for them:
Like Mutineers erected for,
or Age of grateful Men.
The Doctrine of refreshing Times,
bids not to day despise,
When creeping things his Ministers,
bidden Serpents like, be wise.
Pointing thus unto him who had
decreed Moses to drowned:
About his neck in Cradle whose
before was ever crowned.
Far better hanged a Cable then,
as needless now to whom:
Was Stonage commended t'explain,
or whose that thundering doom.
So virtue of this Edens Plant,
what Daphneys such Divine:
Apollo's Leaches bitten by,
dismissed from this time.
Prescribed their Swellings to abate,
Antidotes in season:
No more the Dragon Red to adore,
in time awakens Reason.
The everlasting Rod when buds,
Contrition where the Bayl:
Neither to be deferred: Submit,
none other will avail.
Set in array his to aff^ont,
their Manhoods then brings down
Such sucklings by, driven to their heels,
do them Victorious crown.
Tongues Satan's two edged Swords withdrawn,
Serpents no more appear:
The Ax behold, laid to the Root,
no nesting 'or you here.
Hi^ Cities waste he will repair,
Vine-dressers other choose,
Fruits in due season to forecast,
do not their Trusts abuse.
Sing unto him; so to him sing,
his acts let blocks display,
Who hatching theirs, Cockacrice Balms,
all one do him obey.
B^^ Frogs and Lice, corrupting Flies
compared with the true,
Feeds itching E^rs; with flying News,
Egypts Spells bidden adieu.
The Twelve alloted years expired,
so Woman r^leas'd here.
Stancht tedious Issues thine; Peace too,
be henceforth of good cheer.
Thou Rulers Daughter LO arise,
Friends return to your Rest:
T^pes both, how long of Iuries such,
until be dispossessed.
By the Lady ELEANOR.
Respice Finem.
DROIT and AVAUNT.
RECTE and PERGE.
He that does bear three Lions, or Passant,
Must Lion like pass on, Droit and Avaunt.
Aliter,
Are thy ways right? let not thy spirits faint,
Start not aside, be bold, if Droit Avaunt.
PSALMVS DAVISI
Madam;
YOur Rod indeed has swallowed mine,
Hermes may now turn Hermit; and the Nine
Virgins turn Vestals to attend that fire,
Which in your Altars Incense moves higher
Than e're Apollo's Harp was heard: Your Brass
Does far my Caducaean Staff surpass.
As Arch-Types do Types: Whilst I look on
Your Streams, I loath the Lake of Helicon.
The most Devoted to Honor You, and unworthiest to be Honored by You as a
Kinsman, M: TUKE.

Je Le tien.
Hold fast thy Right, that no man take thy Crown:
Unto the Death, give Fortune leave to frown.
ANd thou, O Tuke Tipyfi'd! Lo
in that one grateful Man,
Whose fellow Lepers have out-lept,
with that Samaritan.
Then Favorit Irish Bryon Tuke,
Gifts those to thine but lame,
Conferred on thy Grandsir: to these
of thy Returns again.
E: Do:

FINIS.
