WHereas certain Information is given from several parts of the Kingdom, That
diverse Troops of Horse are employed in sundry Counties of the Kingdom, and that
others have Commission to raise both Horse and Foot, to compel His Majesty's
Subjects to submit to the Illegal Commission of Array, out of a Traiterous
intent to subvert the Liberty of the Subject, and the Law of the Kingdom; and
for the better strengthening themselves in this wicked attempt, do join with
the Popish and Jesuiticall Faction, to put the Kingdom into a combustion and
Civil War, by leavying forces against the Parliament; and by these Forces to
alter the Religion, and the ancient Government, and lawful Liberty of the
Kingdom; and to introduce Popery and Idolatry, together with an Arbitrary Form
of Government: And in pursuance thereof, have Traitorously and Rebelliously,
leavyed War against the King, and by force, robbed, spoiled, and slain diverse
of His Majesty's good Subjects, traveling about their lawful and necessary
occasions, in the Kings Protection according to Law; and namely, That for
the'nd and purpose aforesaid, The Earl of Northampton, the Lord Dunsmore, Lord
Willoughby of Eresby, Son to the Earl of Linsey, Henry Hastings Esquire: and
diverse other unknown Persons in the Counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, Leicester,
Warwick, Oxford, and other places, the Marquess of Hertford, the Lord Paulet,
Lord Seymer, Sir John Stawell, Sir Ralph Hopton, John Digby Esquire. and other
their Accomplices, have gotten together great Forces in the County of
Sommerset. The Lords and Commons in Parliament, duly considering the great
dangers which may ensue upon such their wicked and Traiterous designs, and if
by this means the Power of the Sword should come into the Hands of Papists and
their Adherents, nothing can be expected but the miserable ruin and desolation
of the Kingdom, and the bloody massacre of the Protestants: They do Declare
and Ordain, That it is, and shall be lawful, for all His Majesty's loving
Subject^, by force of Arms to resist the said several Parties, and their
Accomplices, and all other that shall raise or conduct any other Forces for
th'ends aforesaid, and that the Earl of Essex Lord General, with all his
Forces raised by the authority of Parliament: as likewise the Lord Say,
Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, Earl of Peterborough, Lieutenant of Northamtonshire,
Lord Wharton, Lieutenant of Bu^kinghamshire, Earl of Stamford Lieutenant of
Leicestershire, Earl of Pembrook Lieutenant of Wiltshire and Hampshire, Earl of
Bedford Lieutenant of Sommersetshire and Devon, Lord Brook Liev^enant of
Warwickshire, the Lord Cramborne Lieutenant of Dorsershire, the Lord Willoughby
of Parham Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, and all those who are, or shall be
appointed by Ordinance of both Houses, to perform the Place of Deputy

the City, and Deputy Lievtenants there, and all other Lievtenants of Counties,

their several Counties, as well Trained Bands as others, and shall have power
to conduct, and lead the said Forces of the said Counties against the said

as by Force shall oppose them and the Persons of the said Traitors, and their
Adherents, and Accomplices, to Arrest and Imprison, and them to bring up to the
Parliament, to answer this their Traiterous and Rebellious Attempts according
to Law, and the same or any other Forces, to transport and conduct from one
County to another, in aid and assistance one of another, and of all others that

Abettors, and Adherents, requiring all Lieu^enants of Counties, Sheriffs,
Majors, Justices of Pe^ce, and other His Majesty's Officers and loving
Subjects, to be ayding and assisting to one another in the Execution hereof,
and for their so doing, all the parties above mentioned, and all others that

His Majesty's Declaration, in Answer to a Declaration of the Lords and Commons
Assembled in Parliament, for the raising of all Power and Force, as well Trained
Bands, as others, in several Counties of the Kingdom, to lead against all
Traitors and their Adherents, etc.
AS much experience as we have had of the inveterate rancour and high Insolence
of the malignant party against us, we never yet saw any expression come from
them, so evidently declaring it, as the Declaration entitled, A Declaration of
the Lords and Commons Assembled in Parliament, for the raising of all Power and
Force, as well Trained Bands, as others in several Counties of this Kingdom, to
lead against all Traitors, and their Adherents, etc. In which, That Faction
has as it were distilled, and contracted all their falsehood, Insolence, and
Malice; There being in it not one period which is not either slanderous or
treasonable; and nothing can more grieve us, then that by their infinite Arts
and Subtilty (employed by their perpetual and indefatigable industry) and by
that rabble of Brownists and other Schismatickes declaredly ready to appear at
their call, they should have been able so to draw away some, and drive away
others of our good Subjcts from our Parliament, as to prevail with the Major
Part remaining of both Houses (how much soever that Major part be the smaller,
in comparison of the whole) to suffer that name (whose reverence by all means
we desire to preserve) to be so soyl'd, as to be prefixed to a Paper of this
unsufferable nature; That tends not only to the destruction of our Person, but
to the dissolution of this Government, and of all Society; If at least this
Declaration (which we rather see cause to hope it has not) have so much as
been seen in the Houses, and be not the single Work of the same Omnipotent
Committee, to which is devolved the whole power of the Parliament; and which,
as We understand, is trusted (without acquainting the Houses) to break up any
Man's House, and take away the Arms and Money intended to defend and feed him (if
they shall see cause to suspect that he meant to assist His Sovereign with
them) and may well be as fully and implicitly trusted to Declare, as to Act
whatsoever they please. And though We doubt not, but to their utmost, they will
continue that Injury to Us, and that violation of the Subjects Liberty, and of
public Right, to vex and Imprison those, who shall publish any of our
Answers, to their Declarations, (and indeed whilst they affirm against all
Truth, and command against all Law, it concerns them to take care that nothing
be heard, but what they shall say) yet Our comfort is, That Our Intentions, and
the Duty of Our Subjects are so well, and so generally known to Our People,
that We cannot Fear (from whomsoever it come, and though no Answer came out
with it) that, either what is there said, should be believed, or what is there
commanded, should be obeyed. Who knows not, That Our Commissions for Horse and
Foot were not granted out, till not only Our Prerogative, but Our Propriety,
Our Goods, Arms, Towns, Militia; and negative Voice were taken from Us; and all
the Kingdom commanded to be in Arms, and Invited to bring in Horse, Plate, and
Money, to frame an Army against Our Command and Proclamation, and till Horse
were raised, and Mustred accordingly? And then, with no Intention (nor has any
Action in any of Our Ministers, given the least suspicion of such an Intention)
by them to compel Our Subjects, to submit to Our Commissions of Array, or make
use of them against the Parliament, but to re-gain Hull, held out in Rebellion
against Us; And to suppress all such, as without Our Authority, and against
Our Commands, should raise Forces in this Our Kingdom, and leavie War against
Us, under pretense of any Order, or Ordinance of one or both Houses; and such
Traiterous Assemblies and Marches have been the only lawful and necessary
occasions of Our good Subjects, which have been so much as interrupted by any
Troops of Ours; And what is affirmed of the spoiling and killing them, as they
were so Traveling under our Protection, and according to Law, is a most
malicious Affirmation, as well without Truth, as without Instance, invented at
once to make Our Troops terrible, and Us odious to Our People. What care have
We taken, That (by this means) the power of the Sword should not come into the
Hands of Papists, who have by Our Proclamation strictly charged, That no
Papist should presume to list himself, either as Officer or Soldier in this
Our Army, having directed how he should be discovered, if he did presume; and
suffer, if he were discovered? What care have we taken to avoid combustion and
Civil War, offering to lay down Our Arms, when they shall have laid down
theirs (in whom it was Treason to take them up) and restored Us those things
which could not without Treason, as well as Injustice be sorced away; and kept
from Us, Our Arms, Ships, Town, etc. And when We might meet both Our Houses in
a safe and secure place, to debate freely of all the differences in a
Parliamentary way; And by whose influences these Propositions were rejected,
and whether the Proposer or Rejecters were most careful to avoid this ruin
and desolation of the Kingdom, We leave all the World to Judge; and whether
they, who divert the Men and Money collected for the relief of distressed
Ireland, to raise sorces against their Prince (who asks them nothing but what
is Legal, nor will deny them any that is) do not join with the Popish and
Jesuiticall faction in the bloody Massacre of many thousand Protestants in that
miserable Kingdom. We propose likewise to every Man's Judgment; whether the
Declaring those to be Traitors, who execute Our Commission of Array (issued in
so many Kings Reign, agreed upon by Parliament, and there yielded to by the
King, to be settled as now it is, as a matter of great grace. And since that
time, which was in 5. Hen. 4. in no Parliament complained of) whilst Our good
subjects are vexed and Imprisoned, not only for resisting, but for humbly
Petitioning so as may seem but to insinuate something against their most
illegal commands concerning the Militia (to which power of commanding, no
Title can be made by any Statute, or any Precedent, nor can We ever find by
search, nor obtain to be told what these fundamental Laws are, by which it is
pretended; so deep those foundations are laid, beyond all means of discovery.)
And the Declaring, That those who raise Men by virtue of Our Command and
Commission (the only Legal way) Traitorously and Rebelliously leavie War
against the King; and ordaining it to be lawful for all Our Subjects by force
of Arms to resist them, and their accomplices; and the raising forces by
authority of Parliament (that is, by the remaining part of both Houses) never
in the most outrageous times before attempted, and commanding several Persons
whom they call Lievtenants, to lead, and giving them power to transport from
one County to another, the Forces of several of Our Counties against them, and
to kill and slay all such, as by force shall oppose them, Our Self not
excepted; commanding all Our Officers and Subjects to be assisting to them, and
undertaking to secure them for so doing, by the Power and Authority of
Parliament (which is first to allow, and next to command, and then to pardon
Treason) be not to have already subverted, as much as in them lies, the Liberty
of the Subject, the Law of the Land, and altered the Ancient Government of the
Kingdom, leaving Our Subjects without all Rule to walk by, when the most
clear Laws cannot direct and secure them; and they see all those ancient bounds
passed over, which were ever as much known to be the Duty of both Houses to
observe, as it was evident that there were, and that it was necessary that
there should be two Houses of Parliament, and at once behold the Law (which is
to Defend and Protect the Subject) and Us (who are to Protect and Defend the
Law) need Defense and Protection. We doubt not therefore, but all Our good
Subjects will come in to Our Assistance, and that this wicked charge of
intending to introduce Popery, Idolatry, and Arbitrary government laid by
implication upon us, (because we defend our selves, and would recover our own)
will be so far from being a motive against us, that this intolerable
indignity and damnable scandal (so daily and visibly confuted by all Our
Professions and Actions) will increase Our good Subjects zeal toward Us, and
their indignation against the Contrivers; And they will esteem themselves
obliged by the Religion of Almighty God, to oppose this War so impiously, so
treasonably and so groundlesly made upon Us their King and his Anointed: We
therefore require all Our Commissioners of Array, Sheriffs, and all Our other
Officers and Ministers to raise all the power and forces of their several
Counties to ass^st the Marquess of Hertford, the Earl of Northampton, the
Lord Willoughby of Eresby, the Lord Pawlet, the Lord Seymour, the Lord
Dunsmore, Henry Hastings Esquire; Sir John, Stowell, Sir Ralph Hopton, John Digby
Esquire; and all other in the legal and necessary executing of our Commissions of
Array, and in the raising and conducting of such Horse and Foot as shall be
raised by Our Commission, and by force of Arms to oppose the Earl of Essex,
the Lord Say, and all other that shall raise or conduct any forces raised by
pretense of Authority of both Houses, and the Persons of all such Traitors,
and their Adherents, and Accomplices, to arrest and imprison; To the end they
may be brought to a fair and legal trial, by their Peers, and according to
the Law: And this we require from them, as they tender the Defense of Our
Person, the true Religion, the Law of the Land, the Liberty and property of
the Subject, and the true and just Privileges of Parliament. And for so doing
they shall be defended and secured by Us, and by the Law; with whom, and with
which, we doubt not, but Our Subjects will sooner choose to live and die, then
with the Earl of Essex and his Adherents.
