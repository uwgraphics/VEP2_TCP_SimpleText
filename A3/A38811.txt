TO THE KING.
SIR,
THis Second Edition of SYLVA, after more than a Thousand Copies had been
Bought up, and dispersed of the First Impression, in much less time than two
Years space (which Booksellers assure us is a very extraordinary thing in
Volumes of this bulk) comes now again to pay its Homage to your Serene Majesty,
to whose Auspices alone it owes the favorable Acceptance which it has received
in the World. But it is not That alone, which it presumes to tell your Majesty,
but to acquaint You, that it has been the sole Occasion of furnishing your
almost exhausted Dominions, with more (I dare say) than two Millions of
Timber Trees; besides infinite Others, which have been Propagated within the
three Nations, at the Instigation, and by the Direction of this Work; and that
the Author of it is able (if need require) to make it out, by a competent
Volume of Letters, and acknowledgments, which are come to his hands from
several Persons of the most eminent Quality; many of them Illustrious, and
diverse of them unknown to him, in justification of what he asserts, which he
the rather preserves with the more care; because they are Testimonials from so
many honorable Persons, of the Benefit they have received from the Endeavors
of the Royal Society, which, now adays, passes through so many Censures; but,
she has yet your Majesty for her Founder and Patron, and is therefore the less
concerned; since no man of worth can likely speak ill of an Assembly, which
your Majesty has thought fit to dignifie, by so signal a Relation to it.

It is now about five years past, that your Majesty was pleased to declare your
favorable Acceptance of a Treatise of Architecture which I then presented to
you, with many gracious expressions, and that it was a most useful Piece. Sir,
That Encouragement (together with the success both of the Book it self, and of
the first Edition of this) has animated me to make a second Oblation to you of
these Improvements: Nor was it certainly, without some Provident Conduct, that
we have been thus solicitous to begin as it were, with Materials for Building,
and Directions to Builders; if due Reflections be made on that deplorable
Calamity, the Conflagration of your Imperial City; which nevertheless by the
Blessing of GOD, and your Majesty's gracious Influence, we despair not of
seeing Rise again, a New, and much more Glorious PHOENIX.

This TRIBUTE, I now once more lay at the Feet of our ROYAL FOVNDER: May your
Majesty be pleased, to be Invoked by that no Inglorious TITLE in the
profoundest Submissions of

Gracious Sir, Your Majesty's Ever Loyal, most obedient, and Faithful Subject,
and Servant, J. EVELYN.
Says-Court Aug. 24 1669.
TO THE READER.
AFter what the Frontispiece and Porch of this Wooden Edifice presents you, I
shall need no farther to repeat the Occasion of this following Discourse; I am
only to acquaint you, That as it was delivered to the Royal Society by an
unworthy Member thereof, in Obedience to their Commands; by the same it is now
Re-publish'd without any farther Prospect: And the Reader is to know, That if
these dry sticks afford him any Sap, it is one of the least and meanest of
those Pieces which are every day produced by that Illustrious Assembly, and
which enrich their Collections, as so many Monuments of their accurate
Experiments, and Public endeavors, in order to the production of real and
useful Theories, the Propagation and Improvement of Nutural Science, and the
honor of their Institution. If to this there be any thing subjoyned here,
which may a while bespeak the Patience of the Reader, it is only for the
encouragement of an Industry, and worthy Labor, too much in our days
neglected, as happily reputed a Consideration of too sordid and vulgar a nature
for Noble Persons, and Gentlemen to busy themselves withal, and who oftener
find ways to Fell down, and Destroy their Trees and Plantations, than either
to repair or improve them.

But we are not without hopes of taking off these Prejudices, and of
reconciling them to a Subject and an Industry which has been consecrated (as I
may say) by as good, and as great Persons, as any the World has produced: and
whose Names we find mingled amongst Kings, and Philosophers, grave Senators,
and Patriots of their Country: For such were of old Solomon, Cyrus, and Numa,
Licinius surnamed Stolo, Cato, and Cincinnatus; the Piso's, Fabii, Cicero, the
Plinies, and thousands more whom I might enumerate, that disdained not to
cultivate these Rusticities even with their own hands, and to esteem it a great
Accession, to dignifie their Persons, and adorn their purple with these Rural
Characters of their affections to Planting, and love of this part of
Agriculture, which has transmitted to us their venerable Names through so many
Ages and Vicissitudes of the World.

That famous Answer alone which the Persian Monarch gave to Lysander, will
sufficiently justify that which I have said; besides what we might add, out of
the Writings and Examples of the rest: But since these may suffice, after due
reproofs of the late impolitique Wast, and universal sloth amongst us; we would
now turn our Indignation into Prayers, See Petrarch de Remed. utriusque
fortunae L. 1. Dial. 57.
and address our selves to our better natured Countrymen; that such Woods as
do yet remain entire, might be carefully Preserved, and such as are Destroyed,
sedulously repaired: It is what all Persons who are Owners of Land may
contribute to, and with infinite delight, as well as profit, who are touched
with that laudable Ambition of imitating their Illustrious Ancestors, and of
worthily serving their Generation. To these my earnest and humble Advice should
be, That at their very first coming to their Estates, and as soon as they get
Children, they would seriously think of this Work of Propagation also: For, I
observe there is no part of Husbandry, which men commonly more Fail in,
neglect, and have cause to repent of, than that they did not begin Planting
betimes, without which, they can expect neither Fruit, Ornament, or Delight
from their Labors: Men seldom Plant Trees till they begin to be Wise, that is,
till they grow Old, and find by Experience the Prudence and Necessity of it.

My next Advice is, that they do not easily commit themselves to the Dictates
of their ignorant Hinds and Servants, Vide and Curtium, l. 7. etc.
who are (generally speaking) more fit to Learn than to Instruct. Male agitur
cum Domino quem Villicus docet, was an Observation of old Cato's; and 'twas
Ischomachus who told Socrates (discoursing one day upon a like subject) That it
was far easier to Make than to Find a good Husbandman: I have often proved it
so in Gardeners; and I believe it will hold in most of our Country
Employments: We are to exact Labor, not Conduct and Reason, from the greatest
part of them; and the business of Planting is an Art or Science (for so Varro
has solemnly defined it) and that exceedingly wide of Truth, De R.R.
which (it seems) many in his time accounted of it; facillimam esse, nec ullius
acuminis Rusticationem, an easy and insipid Study. It was the simple Culture
only, with so much difficulty retriv'd from the late confusion of an intestine
and bloody War, like Ours, and now put in Reputation again, which made the
noble Poet write -- How hard it was
Low Subjects with illustrious words to grace.
-- Verbis ea vincere magnum
Quam sit, and angustis hanc addere rebus honorem.
Georg. 3. Seeing, as the Orator does himself express it, In agris erant tunc
Senatores. Cic. de Senect.
Nihil est homine libero dignius; there is nothing more becoming and worthy of
a Gentleman. Palissy, le Moye^ de Devenir Rich.
It was indeed a plain man (a Potter by Trade) but let no body despise him
because a Potter (Agathocles, and a King was of that Craft) who in my Opinion
has given us the true reason why Husbandry, and particularly Planting, is no
more improved in this Age of ours: especially, where Persons are Lords and
Owners of much Land. The truth is, says he, when men have acquired any
considerable Fortune by their good Husbandry, and experience (forgetting that
the greatest Patriarchs, Princes, their Sons and Daughters, belonged to the
Plough, and the Flock) they account it a shame to breed up their Children in
the same Calling in which they themselves were educated, but presently design
them for Gentlemen: They must forsooth, have a Coat of Arms, and live upon
their Estates; So as by that time his Beard grows, he begins to be ashamed of
his Father, and would be ready to defy him, that should upon any occasion mind
him of his honest Extraction: And if it chance that the good man have other
Children to provide for; This must be the Darling, be bred at School, and the
University, whilst the rest must to Plow with the Father, etc. This is the
Cause, says my Author, that our Lands are so ill Cultivated. Every body will
subsist upon their own Revenue, and take their Pleasure, whilst they Resign
their Estates to be managed by the most Ignorant, (which are the Children whom
they leave at home, or the Hinds to whom they commit them.) When as in truth,
and in reason, the more Learning the better Philosophers, and the greater
Abilities they possess, the more, and the better are they qualified, to
Cultivate, and improve their Estates: Methinks this is well and rationally
argued.

And now you have in part what I had to produce in extenuation of this my
Adventure; that Animated with a Command, and Assisted by diverse Worthy Persons
(whose Names I am prone to celebrate with all just Respects) I have presumed to
cast in my Symbol; and which, with the rest that are to follow, may (I hope) be
in some degree serviceable to him (who e're the happy Person be) which shall
oblige the World with that complete Systeme of Agriculture, which as yet seems
a desiderate, and wanting to its perfection. It is (I assure you) what is one
of the Principal Designs of the ROYAL SOCIETY, not in this Particular only, but
through all the Liberal and more useful Arts; and for which (in the estimation
of all equal Judges) it will merit the greatest of Encouragements; that so, at
last, what the Learned Columella has wittily reproached, and complained of, as
a defect in that Age of his, concerning Agriculture in general, and is
applicable here, may attain its desired Remedy and Consummation in This of Ours.

Sola enim Res Rustica, quae sine dubitatione proxima, Praefat. ad P. Sylvium;
which I earnestly recommend to the serious perusal of our Gentry. Et mihi ad
sapientis vitam proxime videtur accedere. Cic. de Senectute.
and quasi consanguinea Sapientiae est, tam discentibus eget, quam magistris:
Adhuc in Scholis Rhetorum, and Geometrarum, Musicorumque, Vel quod magis
mirandum est, contemptissimorum vitiorum officinas, gulosius condiendi cibos,
and luxuriosius sercula struendi, capitumque and capillorum concinnatores non
solum esse audivi, sed and ipse vidi; Agricolationis neque Doctores qui se
profiterentur, neque Discipulos cognovi. But this I leave for our Gallants to
Interpret, and should now apply my self to the Directive Part, which I am all
this while bespeaking, if after what I have said in the several Paragraphs of
the ensuing Discourse upon the Argument of Wood, (and which in this Second
Edition coming Abroad with innumerable Improvements, to at the least, a
full-half Augmented, and that with such Advantages, as I am not afraid, to
pronounce it almost altogether a New-Work, so furnished, as I hope shall
neither reproach the Author, or repent the Reader) it might not seem
superfluous to have praemised any thing here for the Encouragement of so
becoming an Industry. There are diverse Learned, and judicious Men who have
praeceded Me in this Argument; as many, at least, as have undertaken to Write
and Compile vast Herbals, and Theaters of Plants; of which we have some of our
own Countrymen, who have (I dare boldly affirm it) surpassed any, if not all
the Forriners that are extant: In Those it is you meet with the Description of
the several Plants, by Discourses, Figures, Names, Places of Growth, time of
Flourishing, and their Medicinal Virtues; which may supply any deficiency of
mine as to those Particulars; if the forbearing that Repetition, should by any
be imputed for a defect, though it were indeed none of my design: I say, these
things are long since performed to our hands: But there is none of these (that
I at least know of, and are come to my perusal) who have taken any considerable
pains how to Direct, and Encourage us in the Culture of Forest-Trees (the grand
defect of this Nation): besides some small sprinklings to be met withal in
Gervas Markham, Old Tusser, and the Country-Farm long since Translated out of
French; and by no means suitable to our clime and Country: Neither have any of
these proceeded after my Method, and so particularly, in Raising, Planting,
Dressing and Governing, etc. or so sedulously made it their business, to
specify the Mechanical Uses of the several kinds, as I have done, which was
hitherto a great desiderate: and in which the Reader will likewise find some
things altogether New and Instructive; and both Directions and Encouragements
for the Propagation of some Forain Curiosities of Ornament and Use, which were
hitherto neglected. If I have upon occasion presumed to say any thing
concerning their Medicinal properties, it has been Modestly and Frugally, and
with chief, if not only respect to the poor Wood-man, whom none I presume will
envy, that living far from the Physician, he should in case of Necessity,
consult the reverend Druid, his Ne Sylvae quidem, horridiorque naturae facies
Medicinis carent, Sacra illa parente rerum omnium, nusquam non remedia
disponente homini, ni Medicina, sieret etiam solitudo ipsa, etc. Hinc nata
M^dic^na, etc. Haec sola natura placuerat esse remedia parata vulgo, inventu
facilia, ac sine impendio, ex quibus vivimus, etc. Plin. L. 24. c. 1.
Oaks, and his Elm, Birch or Elder, for a short Breath, a Green Wound, or a
sore Leg; Casualties incident to this hard Labor. These are the chief
Particulars of this ensuing Work, and what it pretends hitherto of Singular, in
which let me be permitted to say, There is sufficient for Instruction, and more
than is extant in any Collection whatsoever (absit verbo invidia) in this way,
and upon this Subject; abstracting things Practicable, of solid use, and
material, from the Ostentation and impertinences of diverse Writers; who
receiving all that came to hand on trust, to swell their monstrous Volumes,
have hitherto imposed upon the credulous World, without conscience or honesty.
I will not exasperate the Adorers of our ancient and late Naturalists, by
repeating of what our Verulam has justly pronounced concerning their Rhapsodies
(because I likewise honor their painful Endeavors, and am obliged to them for
much of that I know,) nor will I (with some) reproach Pliny, Porta, Cardan,
Mizaldus, Cursius, and many others of great Names (whose Writings I have
diligently consulted) for the Knowledge they have imparted to me on this
Occasion; but I must deplore the time which is (for the most part) so miserably
lost in pursuit of their Speculations, where they treat upon this Argument: But
the World is now advised, and (blessed be God) infinitely redeemed from that
base and servile submission of our noblest Faculties to their blind Traditions.
This, you will be apt to say, is a haughty Period; but whiles I affirm it of
the Past, it justifies, and does honor to the Present Industry of our Age, and
of which there cannot be a greater and more emulous Instance, than the Passion
of His Majesty to encourage His Subjects, and of the Royal Society, His
Majesty's Foundation, who receive and promote His Dictates, in all that is
laudable and truly emolumental of this Nature.

It is not therefore that I here presume to instruct Him in the management of
that great and august Enterprise of resolving to Plant and repair His ample
Forests, and other Magazines of Timber, for the benefit of His Royal Navy, and
the glory of His Kingdoms; but to present to His Sacred Person, and to the
World, what Advises I have received from others, observed my self, and most
Industriously Collected from a studious propensity to serve as one of the least
Intelligences in the ampler Orb of our Illustrious Society, and in a Work so
Important and Necessary.

The Table to the Calendar.
It might seem impertinent to have added a Table to a Book of so small a
Volume, and which seems to be of it self but a Table: But since it may prove
advantageous for the saving of time, at once to learn the whole Culture of any
Plant, as the Particulars are sprinkled the several Pages; the Author has
thought fit to Collect, and annex it.

The Introduction.
1. Introduction.
SInce there is nothing which seems more fatally to threaten a Weakening, if not
a Dissolution of the strength of this famous and flourishing Nation, then the
sensible and notorious decay of her Wooden walls, when either through time,
negligence, or other accident, the present Navy shall be worn out and impaired;
it has been a very worthy and seasonable Advertisement in the Honorable the
principal Officers and Commissioners, what they have lately suggested to this
Illustrious Society, for the timely prevention and redress of this intolerable
defect. For it has not been the late increase of Shipping alone, the
multiplication of Glass-works, Iron-Furnaces, and the like, from whence this
impolitick diminution of our Timber has proceeded; but from the
disproportionate spreading of Tillage, caused through that prodigious havoc
made by such as lately professing themselves against Root and Branch (either to
be re-imburs'd of their Holy purchases, or for some other sordid respect) were
tempted, not only to fell and cut down, but utterly to grub up, demolish, and
raze, as it were, all those many goodly Woods, and Forests, which our more
prudent Ancestors left standing, for the Ornament, and service of their
Country. And this devastation is now become so Epidemical, that unless some
favorable expedient offer it self, and a way be seriously, and speedily
resolved upon, for the future repair of this intolerable defect, one of the
most glorious, and considerable Bulwarks of this Nation, will, within a short
time, be totally wanting to it.

2. To attend now a spontaneous supply of these decayed Materials (which is the
vulgar, and natural way) would cost (besides the Enclosure) some entire Ages
repose of the Plow: Therefore, the most expeditious, and obvious Method, would
(doubtless) be by one of these two ways, Sowing, or Planting. But, first, it
will be requisite to agree upon the Species; as what Trees are likely to be of
greatest Use, and the fittest to be cultivated; and then, to consider of the
Manner how it may best be effected. Truly, the waste, and destruction of our
Woods, has been so universal, that I conceive nothing less then an universal
Plantation of all the sorts of Trees will supply, and well encounter the
defect; and therefore, I shall here adventure to speak something in general of
them all; though I chiefly insist upon the propagation of such only as seem to
be the most wanting, and serviceable.

3. And first by Trees here, I consider principally for the Genus
generalissimum, such Lignous and woody Plants, as are hard of substance,
procere of stature; that are thick and solid, and stiffly adhere to the Ground
on which they stand: These we shall divide into the Greater and more Ceduous,
Fruticant and Shrubby; Feras and wild; or more Civilized and domestique; and
such as are Sative and Hortensial subalternate to the other; But of which I
give only a touch, distributing the rest into these two Classes, the Dry, and
the Aquatic; both of them applicable to the same civil uses of Building,
Vtensils, Ornament, and Fuel; for to dip into their Medicinal virtues is none
of my Province, though I sometimes glance at them with due submission, and in
few Instances.

4. Among the dry, I esteem the more principal, and solid, to be the Oak, Elm,
Beech, Ash, Chess-nut, Wall-nut, etc. The less principal, the Service, Maple,
Lime-tree, Horn-beam, Quick-beam, Birch, Hasel, etc. together with all their
sub-alternate, and several kinds.

-- Which of how many sorts they are,
We cannot at present here stand to declare.
Sed neque quam multa species, nec nomina quae sint,
Est numerus,
Geor. 2. 5. Of the Aquatical, I reckon the Poplars, Asp, Alder, Willow,
Sallow, Osier, etc. Then I shall add a word or two, for the encouragement of
the planting of Fruit Trees, together with some less vulgar, but no less useful
Trees, which, as yet are not endenizon'd amongst us, or (at least) not much
taken notice of: And in pursuance hereof, I shall observe this order: First, to
show how they are to be Raised, and then to be Cultivated; By raising, I
understand the Seed and the Soil; by Culture the Planting, Fencing, Watering,
Dressing, Pruning and Cutting; of all which briefly.

6. And first for their Raising, some there are, Spring of themselves unforc't
by human ear,
-- Nullis hominum cogentibus, ipsae
Sponte sua veniunt --
Specifying according to the various disposition of the Air and Soil; Some from
their Seeds arise.
Pars autem posito surgunt de semine*
As the Oak, Chess-nut, Ash, etc. Some to th^^ Groves from their own Roots do
spring,
Pullulat ab radico ali^s deusissima Sylva*
As the Elm, Alder, etc. and there are others, Grow without Root
Mil radicit egeut --
as Willows, and all the Vimineous kinds, which are raised of Sets only.

These ways first Nature gave,
Hos natura modos primum dedit --
For thus we see there are more ways to the Wood than one; and she has
furnished us with variety of expedients.

7. And here we might fall into a deep Philosophical Research, whether the
Earth it self in some place thereof or other, even without Seed, Branch or
Root, etc. would produce every kind of Vegetable, as it manifestly does, diverse
sorts of Grass and Plants? (viz.) the Tre-fole or Clover in succulent land; In
dry ground May and Ra^-weeds; In the very moist, Argentina, Flaggs, etc. And
the very barren Fern, Broom, and Heath, etc. So Virgil notes sterile places
for the Pitch-tree; we our wett and Vligi^ous for Birch, Alder, etc. The more
lofty, poor and perflatile for Eugh, Guiniper, Box, and the like; and we read
in the Natural Histories of diverse Countries, that the Cedar, Palmetos
Queen-Pines, Ebony, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, etc. For Trees; the Tulip, Hyacinth,
Crocus, etc. For Flowers, are sometimes, and in some regions Aborigines,
descended immediately from the Genius of the Soyls, Climate, Sun, Shade, Air,
Winds, Water, Niterous-Salts, Rocks, Banks, Shores, and (as the Negros-Heads
in the Bachados) even without Seed, or any perceptible rudiment. But with all
this we are not satisfied without supposing some previous seminal disposition
lurking, and dispersed in every part of the Earth, in what Moleculae or subtle
contextures we shall not enquire, but though happly not at first so perfect as
the maturer Seeds of their after peculiar Plants; yet such as are fit for the
Sun and Influences to operate on, 'til they have prepared, discussed, and
excited their Seminal and Prolifique virtue to exert it self and awake out of
sleep, in which they lay as in their causes; And free themselves from those
impediments which hindered their Specification and Nativity: This Conception the
learned Gassendus would illustrate by the latent fire in Flints, which never
betrays it self 'til it be forced out by Collision; but which yet methinks,
does not so fully inlighten this Hypothesis, which we only hint for Method and
Introduction only: For the design of this Discourse is not to persuade Men to
sit still, and let Nature work alone, but to aid and assist her as much as they
are able from Seeds and Plants already perfected, and qualified for more speedy
Propagation. Most Ingenious, in the mean time is what some upon an accurate and
narrow guess, have not feared to pronounce; namely, that all planting by Seed,
was but a kind of Inoculation; and propagation by Cyons and Sprouts, but a
Subterranean Graffing: And upon this account I am the more willing to assent,
that in Removing of wild Trees, taken out of encumbered places, (so it be
performed with all due circumstances) there may happen considerable
Improvements; since, as there is something in Super graffing, or the repetition
of Graffing for the enlargement, and melioration of Fruit; so there may be also
in a careful Removal; especially the Tree being of a kind apt to dilate its
Roots, and taken whilst those Roots may be safely, and entirely transferred;
and likewise, because it is presumed that most Trees propagated by Seeds, emitt
a principal Root, very deep into the Earth, which frequently extracting but a
courser Nutriment (though it may happly yield a close, and firmer Timber) yet
is not so apt to Shoot and spread, as what are by Removal deprived of that
Root, and by being more impregnate with the Sun, Dews and heavenly Influences
near the surface, enabled to produce larger, more delicate and better tasted
Fruit; supposing Nutts, Mast, or Berries, for we would not go out of our Forest
for instances. And yet even in these desents of the Top-Root, it sometimes
penetrating to a Vein of some rich Marle or other Mould, the extraordinary
flourishing and expedition of growth, will soon give notice of it. But to make
some Trial of this, 'twere no difficult matter, when one plants a Nursery or
Grove, to experiment what the Earth, as far as the Roots are like to reach,
will advance and discover to us.

8. In the mean time, it has been stiffly controverted by some, whether were
better to raise Trees for Timber, and the like uses, from their Seeds and first
Rudiments; or to Transplant such as we find have either raised themselves from
their Seeds, or spring from the Mother roots. Now, that to produce them
immediately of the Seed is the better way, these Reasons may seem to evince.

First. because they take soonest. Secondly, because they make the straightest,
and most uniform shoot. Thirdly, because they will neither require staking, nor
watering (which are two very considerable Articles) and lastly, for that all
transplanting (though it much improve Fruit trees) unless they are taken up the
first Year, or two, is a considerable impediment to the growth of Forest-trees.
And, though it be true, that diverse of those which are found in Woods,
especially Oaklings, young Beeches, Ash, and some others, spring from the
self-sown mast and keys; yet, being for the most part dropped, and disseminated
amongst the half rotten sticks, musty leaves, and perplexities of the
mother-roots, they grow scraggy; and being over-dripp'd become squalid and
mossie, Which checks their growth, and makes their bodies pine.
Crescentique adimunt foetus, uruntque ferentem.
Geo. 2. Nor can their roots expand, and spread themselves as they would do if
they were sown, or had been planted in a more open, free, and ingenuous Soil.
And that this is so, I do affirm upon Experience, that an Acorn sown by hand in
a Nursery, or ground where it may be free from these encumbrances, shall in two
or three Years outstrip a Plant of twice that age, which has either been
self-sown in the Woods, or removed; unless it fortune, by some favorable
accident, to have been scattered into a more natural, penetrable, and better
qualified place: But this disproportion is yet infinitely more remarkable in
the Pine, and the Wall-nut tree, where the Nut set into the ground does usually
overtake a Tree of ten years growth which was planted at the same instant; and
this is a Secret so generally misrepresented by most of those who have treated
of these sort of Trees, that I could not suffer it to pass over without a
particular remark; so as the noble Poet (with pardon for receding from so
venerable Authority) might be mistaken, when he delivers this observation as
universal, to the prejudice of Sowing, and raising Woods from their Rudiments:
Trees which from scattered Seeds to spring are made
Come slowly on; for our Grand-childrens shade.
Nam quae seminibus jactis se sustulit arbos
Tarda venit; seris factura nepotibus umbram.
Geor. l. 2. And indeed I know diverse are of this opinion; and possibly in some
luckier Soils, and where extraordinary care is had in Transplanting, and
removing cumbrances, etc. There may be reason for it; But I affirm it (...),
and for the most part, and find I have the suffrage of another no inelegant
Poet, if not in a full assent to my Assertion, yet in the choice of my
procedure for their perfection.

-- Though Suckers which the Stock repair,
Will with th^ck Branches crowd the empty Air,
Or the Ground-Oak transplanted, boughs may shoot;
Yet no such Grov's does with my fancy suit
As what from Acorns set on even rows
In open fields at their due distance grows.
What though your Ground long time must fallow ly,
And Se^dling-Oakes yield but a slow supply?
No walks else can be for like beauty praised
For, certain it is, that Plants from Acorns raised,
As to the Center deeper fivers spread,
So to the Zenith more advance their head:
Be it that Plants for natural moisture pine,
And as exposed at Change of Soil decline;
Or that the Acorn with its native mould
Does thrive, and spread, and firm alliance hold.
-- Quamvis ipsa de stirpe parentis
Pullulet, and tenues tollat se quercus in auras,
Aut mutata solo, ramis exultet opacis;
Forma tamen nemoris non sit mihi gratior ulla,
Quam quod per campos, posito de semine, crevit
Et quamquam sit agro praelongum tempus inerti
Durcendum, ac tardae surgant de semine quercus:
His tamen, his long veniunt felicius umbrae.
Nam certum est de glande satas radicibus imis
Altius in terram per se descendere plantas:
Majoresque adeo in coelum profundere ramos.
Seu quod dediscant mutatam semina matrem,
Dgen remque ferant alieno ex ubere prolem:
Sive quod ipsa ^bi cognatae inolescere terrae
Glans primo melius paulatim assuevit ab ortu.
Rapinus Hort. l. 2. CHAP. I. Of the Soil, and of Seed.
Soil.
1. HEre, for Methods sake, something it were expedient to premise concerning
the Soil; and indeed I do acknowledge to have observed so vast a difference in
the Improvement of Woods, by that of the Ground, that it is at no hand to be
neglected: But this being more than Transitorily touched in each Chapter of the
ensuing Discourse, I shall not need to assign it any apart, when I have
affirmed in General, that most Timber Trees grow and prosper well in any
tolerable Land which will produce Corn or Rye, and which is not in excess
Stony; in which nevertheless there are some Trees delight; or altogether Clay,
which few, or none do naturally affect; And yet the Oak is seen to prosper in
it, for its toughness preferred before any other by many Workmen, though of
all Soyls the Cow-pasture do certainly exceed, be it for what purpose soever of
planting Wood. Rather therefore we should take notice how many great Wits and
ingenious Persons, who have leisure and faculty are in pain for Improvements of
their Heaths and barren Hills, cold and starving places, which causes them to
be neglected and despaired of; whilst they flatter their hopes and vain
expectations with fructifying liquors, Chemical Menstrues and such vast
conceptions; in the mean time that one may show them as Heathy and Hope-less
grounds, and barren Hills as any in England, that do now bear, or lately have
born Woods, Groves and Copses which yield the Owners more wealth, than the
richest and most opulent Wheat-Lands: And if it be objected that it is so long a
day before these Plantations can afford that gain; The Brabant Nurseries, and
diverse home-plantations of Industrious Persons are sufficient to convince the
gain-sayer. And when by this Husbandry a few Acorns shall have peopled the
Neighboring Regions with young Stocks and Trees; the residue will become Groves
and Copses of infinite delight and satisfaction to the Planters. Besides, we
daily see what Course Lands will bear these Stocks (suppose them Oaks,
Wall-nutts, Chess-nutts, Pines, Firr, Ash, Wild-Pears, Crabbs, etc.) and some
of them, as for instance the Pear and the Firr or Pine, strike their Roots
through the roughest and most impenetrable Rocks and clefts of Stone it self;
and others require not any rich or pingued, but very moderate Soil;
especially, if committed to it in Seeds, which allies them to their Mother and
Nurse without renitency or regrett: And then considering what assistances a
little Care in easing and stirring of the ground about them for a few years
does afford them: What cannot a strong Plow, a Winter mellowing, and summer
heats, incorporated with the pregnant Turfe, or a slight assistance of Lime
perform even in the most unnatural and obstinate Soil? And in such places
where anciently Woods have grown, but are now unkind to them, the fault is to
be reformed by this Care; and chiefly, by a Sedulous extirpation of the old
remainders of Roots, and latent Stumps, which by their mustiness, and other
pernicious qualities, sour the ground, and poison the Conception; And herewith
let me put in this note, that even the Soil it self does frequently discover
and point best to the particular Species, though some are for all places alike:
but I shall say no more of these particulars at this time, because, the rest is
sprinkled over this whole Work in their due places; Wherefore we hasten to the
following Title, namely, the choice and ordering of the Seeds.

2. Choose your Seed of that which is perfectly mature, Seed.
ponderous and sound; commonly that which is easily shaken from the boughs, or
gathered about November, immediately upon its spontaneous fall, or taken from
the tops and summities of the fairest and soundest Trees, is best, and does
(for the most part) direct to the proper season of interring, etc. According to
Institution. For, Nature her self who all created first,
Invented sowing, and the wild Plants nurs't:
When Mast and Berries from the Trees did drop,
Succeeded under by a numerous Crop.
Nam specimen sationis, and insitionis origo
Ipsa fuit rerum primum natura creatrix:
Arboribus quoniam baccae, glandesque caducae
Tempestiva dabant pullorum examina subter, etc.
Lucret. l. 5. Yet this is to be considered, that if the place you sow in be
too cold for an Autumnal semination, your Acorns, Mast, and other Seeds may be
prepared for the Vernal by being barrel'd, or potted up in moist Sand or Earth
stratum S.S. during the Winter; at the expiration whereof you will find them
sprouted; and being committed to the Earth, with a tender hand, as apt to take
as if they had been sown with the most early, nay with great advantage: by this
means, too, they have escaped the Vermin (which are prodigious devourers of
Winter fowing) and will not be much concerned with the increasing heat of the
Season, as such as being crude, and unfermented are newly sown in the beginning
of the Spring; especially in hot and loose Grounds; being already in so fair a
progress by this artificial preparation; and which (if the provision to be made
be very great) may be thus managed. Choose a fit piece of Ground, and with
boards (if it have not that position of it self) design it three foot high; lay
the first foot in fine Earth, another of Seeds, Acorns, Mast, Keys, Nuts, Haws,
Holly-beries, etc. Promiscuously, or separate, with (now, and then) a little
Mould sprinkled amongst them: The third foot wholly Earth: Of these preparatory
Magazines make as many, and as much larger-ones as will serve your turn,
continuing it from time to time as your store is brought in. The same for ruder
handlings, may you also do by burying your Seeds in dry Sand, or pulverized
Earth, Barrelling them (as I said) in Tubs, or laid in heaps in some deep
Cellar where the rigor of the Winter may least prejudice them; and I have
filled old Hampers, Bee-hives, and Boxes with them, and found the like
advantage, which is to have them ready for your Seminary, as before has been
showed, and exceedingly prevent the season. There be also who affirm, that the
careful cracking and opening of Stones which include the Kernels, as soon as
ripe, precipitate Growth and gain a years advance.

3. But to pursue this to some farther Advantage; as to what concerns the
election of your Seed, It is to be considered, that there is vast difference,
(what if I should affirm more than an hundred years) in Trees even of the same
growth and Bed, which I judge to proceed from the variety and quality of the
Seed: This, for instance, is evidently seen in the heart, procerity and stature
of Timber; and therefore choose not your Seeds always from the most
Fruitful-trees, which are commonly the most Aged, and decayed; but from such as
are found most solid and fair: Nor, for this reason, covet the largest Acorns,
etc. (but as Husband men do their Wheat) the most weighty, clean and bright:
This Observation we deduce from Fruit Trees, which we seldom find to bear so
kindly, and plentifully, from a sound stock, smooth Rind, and firm Wood, as
from a rough, lax, and untoward Tree, which is rather prone to spend it self in
Fruit, (the ultimate effort, and final endeavor of its most delicate Sap,)
than in solid and close substance to increase the Timber. And this shall
suffice, though some happily might here recommend to us a more accurate
Microscopical examen, to interpret their most secret Schematismes, which were
an over nicity for these great Plantations.

4. As concerning the medicating, and insuccation of Seeds, or enforcing the
Earth by rich and generous Composts, etc. for Trees of these kinds, I am no
great favourer of it; not only, because the charge would much discourage the
Work; but for that we find it unnecessary, and for most of our Forest-trees,
noxious; since even where the ground is too fertile, they thrive not so well;
and if a Mould be not proper for one sort it may be fit for another: Yet I
would not (by this) hinder any from the trial, what advance such Experiments
will produce: In the mean time, for the simple Imbibition of some Seeds and
Kernels, when they prove extraordinary dry, and, as the Season may fall out, it
might not be amiss to macerate them in Milk, or Water only, a little
impregnated with Cow Dung, etc. during the space of twenty four hours, to give
them a spirit to sprout, and chet the sooner; especially, if you have been
retarded in your sowing without our former preparation.

5. Being thus provided with Seeds of all kinds, I would advise to raise Woods
by sowing them apart, in several places destined for their growth, where the
Mould being prepared (as I shall show hereafter) and so qualified (if election
be made) as best to suit with the nature of the Species, they may be sown
promiscuously, which is the most natural and Rural; or in straight and even
lines, for Hedg-rows, Avenues, and Walks, which is the more Ornamental: But,
because some may choose rather to draw them out of Nurseries; that the Culture
is not much different, nor the hinderance considerable (provided they be early,
and carefully Removed) I will finish what I have to say concerning these Trees
in the Seminary, and show how they are there to be Raised, Transplanted, and
Governed till they can shift for themselves.

CHAP. II. Of the Seminary.
1. QVi Vineam, vel Arbustum constituere volet, Seminary.
Seminaria prius facere debebit, was the precept of Columella, l. 3. c. 5.
speaking of Vineyards and Fruit Trees: and, doubtless, we cannot pursue a
better Course for the Propagation of Timber Trees: For though it seem but a
trivial design that one should make a Nursery of Foresters; yet it is not to be
imagined, without the experience of it, what prodigious Numbers a very small
spot of Ground well Cultivated, and destined for this purpose, would be able to
furnish toward the sending forth of yearly Colonies into all the naked
quarters of a Lordship, or Demeasnes; Being with a pleasant Industry liberally
distributed amongst the Tenants, and disposed of about the Hedge-rows, and
other Waste, and uncultivated places, for Timber, Shelter, Fuel, and Ornament,
to an incredible Advantage. This being a cheap, and laudable Work, of so much
pleasure in the execution, and so certain a profit in the event; to be but once
well done (for, as I affirmed, a very small Nursery will in a few years people
a vast extent of Ground) has made me sometimes in admiration at the universal
negligence.

2. Having therefore made choice of some fit place of Ground, well Fenced,
respecting the South-east, rather than the full South, and well protected from
the North and West; He that for wood his Field would sow,
Must clear it of the Shrubbs that grow;
Cut Brambles up, and the Fern mow.
Qui serere ingenuum volet agrum,
Liberat prius arva fruticibus;
Falce rubos, filicemque resecat.
Boeth. l. 2. Me^* This done, let it be Broken up the Winter before you sow, to
mellow it; especially if it be a Clay, and then the furrow would be made
deeper; or so, at least; as you would prepare it for Wheat: Or you may Trench
it with the Spade, by which means it will the easier be cleansed of whatsoever
may obstruct the putting forth, and insinuating of the tender Roots: Then
having given it a second stirring, immediately before you sow, cast, and
dispose it into Rills, or small narrow Trenches of four, or five inches deep,
and in even lines, at two foot interval, for the more commodious Runcation,
Hawing, and dressing the Trees: Into these Furrows (for a Conseminea Sylva)
throw your Oak, Beech, Ash, Nuts, all the Glandiferous Seeds, Mast, and
Key-bearing kinds, so as they lie not too thick, and then cover them very well
with a Rake, or fine-tooth'd Harrow, as they do for Pease: Or, to be more
accurate, you may set them as they do Beans (especially, the Nuts and Acorns)
and that every Species by themselves, for the Roboraria, Glandaria, Vlmaria,
etc. which is the better way: This is to be done at the latter end of October,
for the Autumnal sowing; and in the lighter ground about February for the
Vernal.

Then see your hopeful Grove with Acorns sown,
But e're your Seed into the Field be thrown
With crooked Plough first let the lusty Swain
Break-up, and stubborn Clodds with Harrow plain.
Then when the Stemm appears, to make it bare
And lighten the hard Earth with Hough, prepare.
Hough in the Spring: nor frequent Culture fail,
Lest noxious Weeds 'ore the young Wood prevail:
To barren ground with toil large meanour add,
Good-husbandry will force a Ground that is bad.
Proinde nemus sparsa cures de glande parandum:
Sed tamen ante tuo mandes quam semina campo;
Ipse tibi duro robustus vomere fossor
Omne solum subigat late, explanetque subactum.
Cumque novus fisso primum de germine ramus
Findit humum, rursus ferro versanda bicorni
Consita vere novo tellus, cultuque frequenti
Exercenda, herbae circum ne forte nocentes
Proveniant, germenque ipsum radicibus urant.
Nec cultu campum cunctantem urgere frequenti,
Et saturare fimo pudeat, si forte resistat.
Culturae: nam tristis humus superanda colendo est.
Rapinus l. 2. Note that 6 Bushells of Acorns will sow or plant an Aker, at one
foots distance.

3. Your Plants beginning now to peep should be earthed up, and comforted a
little; especially, after breaking of the greater Frosts, and when the swelling
mould is apt to spue them forth; but when they are about an inch above ground
you may in a moist season, draw them up where they are too thick, and set them
immediately in other lines, or Beds prepared for them; or you may plant them in
double fosses, where they may abide for good and all, and to remain till they
are of a competent stature to be Transplanted; where they should be set at such
distances as their several kinds require; but if you draw them only for the
thinning of your Seminary, prick them into some empty Beds (or a Plantarium
purposely designed) at one foot interval, leaving the rest at two or three.

4. When your Seedlings have stood thus till June, bestow a slight digging upon
them, and scatter a little mungy, half rotten Litter, Fearn, Bean-hame, or old
Leaves among them, to preserve the Roots from scorching, and to entertain the
moisture; and then in March following (by which time it will be quite consumed
and very mellow) you shall chop it all into the earth, and mingle it together:
Continue this process for two or three years successively; For till then, the
substance of the Kernel will hardly be spent in the plant, which is of maine
import; but then (and that the stature of your young Impes invite) you may
plant them forth, carefully taking up their Roots, and cutting the Stem within
an inch of the ground (if the kind, of which hereafter, suffer the knife) set
them where they are to continue: If thus you reduce them to the distance of
forty foot; the Intervals may be planted with Ash, which may be felled either
for Poles, or Timber without the least prejudice of the Oak, some repeat the
cutting we spoke of the second Year, and after March (the Moon decreasing)
re-cut them at half a foot from the surface; and then meddle with them no more:
but this (if the process be not more severe than needs) must be done with a
very sharp Instrument, and with care, least you violate, and unsettle the Root;
which is likewise to be practiced upon all those which you did not Transplant,
unless you find them very thriving Trees; and then it shall suffice to prune
off the Branches, and spare the Tops; for this does not only greatly establish
your Plants by diverting the Sap to the Roots; but likewise frees them from the
injury and concussions of the Winds, and makes them to produce handsome,
straight shoots, infinitely preferable to such as are abandoned to Nature, and
Accident, without this discipline: By this means the Oak will become excellent
Timber, shooting into straight and single Stems,: The Chess-nut, Ash, etc.
multiply into Poles, which you may reduce to standards at pleasure: To this I
add, that as often as you make your annual Transplanting, out of the Nursery, by
drawing forth the choycest Stocks, the remainder will be improved by a due
stirring and turning of the mould about their Roots.

5. Theophrastus in his third Book de Causes c. 7. gives us great caution in
planting to preserve the Roots, and especially the Earth, adhering to the
smallest Fibers, which should by no means be shaken off, as most of our
Gardners do to trim and quicken them as they pretend, which is to cut them
shorter, etc. not at all considering, that those tender Hairs are the very
mouths and Vehicles which suck in the nutriment, and transfuse into all the
parts of the Tree, and that these once perishing, the thicker and larger Roots,
hard and less spungie, signify little but to establish the Stem; as I have
frequently experimented in Orange Trees, whose Fibers are so very obnoxious to
rot, if they take in the least excess of wet: And therefore Cato advises us to
take care that we bind the mould about them, or transfer the Roots in Baskets,
to preserve it from forsaking them; For this Earth being already applied and
fitted to the overtures and mouths of the Fibers, it will require some time to
bring them in appetite again to a new mould, by which to repair their loss,
furnish their stock, and proceed in their wonted Economy without manifest
danger and interruption: Nor less ought our care to be in the making and
dressing of the pits and fosses into which we design our Transplantation, which
should be prepared and left some time open to macerating Rains, Frosts and Sun,
that may resolve the compacted Salt, render the Earth friable, mix and qualify
it for aliment, and to be more easily drawn in and digested by the Roots and
analogus Stomach of the Trees: This to some degree may be artificially done, by
burning of straw in the newly opened Pits, and drenching the mould with Water;
especially in over dry seasons, and by meliorating barren-ground with sweet,
and comminuted letations.

6. The Author of the Natural History, Pliny, tells us it was a vulgar
Tradition, in his time, that no Tree, should be Removed under two years old, or
above three: Cato would have none Transplanted less than five fingers in
diametre; But I have showed why we are not to attend so long for such as we
raise of Seedlings: In the interim, if these directions appear too busy, or
operose, or that the Plantation you intend be very ample, a more compendious
Method will be the confused sowing of Acorns, etc. in Furrows, two foot
asunder, covered at three fingers depth, and so for three years cleansed, and
the first Winter covered with fearn, without any farther culture, unless you
Transplant them; but, as I showed before, in Nurseries they would be cut an
inch from the Ground, and then let stand till March the second year, when it
shall be sufficient to disbranch them to one only shoot, whether you suffer
them to stand, or remove them elsewhere. But to make an Essay what Seed is most
agreeable to the Soil, you may by the thriving of a promiscuous Semination make
a judgment of, What each Soil bears, and what it does refuse.
Quid quaque ferat regio, and quid quaque recuset.
Transplanting those which you find least agreeing with the place; or else, by
Copsing the starvlings in the places where they are new sown, cause them
sometimes to overtake even their untouched contemporaries.

7. But here some may inquire what distances I would generally assign to
Transplanted Trees? To this somewhat is said in the ensuing Periods, and as
occasion offers; though the promiscuous rising of them in Forest-Work, wild,
and natural is to us I acknowledge more pleasing, than all the studied accuracy
in ranging of them; unless it be, where they conduct and lead us to Avenues,
and are planted for Vistas (as the Italians term is) in which case, the
proportion of the Breadth and Length of the Walks, etc. should govern, as well
as the Nature of the Tree, with this only note; That such Trees as are rather
apt to spread, than mount, as the Oak, Beech, Wall-nutt, etc. be disposed at
wider intervals, than the other, and such as grow best in Consort, as the Elm,
Ash, Lime-tree, Sycomore, Firr, Pine, etc. Regard is likewise to be had to the
quality of the Soil, for this work: V.G. If Trees that affect cold and moist
grounds, be planted in hot and dry places, then set them at closer Order; but
Trees which love scorching and dry Grounds at farther distance: The like rule
may also guide in situations exposed to impetuous Winds and other accidents
which may serve for general Rules in this piece of Tacties.

8. To leave nothing omitted which may contribute to the stability of our
Transplanted Trees, something is to be premised concerning their staking, and
securing from external injuries, especially from Winds and Cattle, against both
which, such as are planted in Copses, and for ample Woods, are sufficiently
defended by the Mounds and their closer order; especially, if they rise of
Seed: But where they are exposed in single rows, as in Walks and Avenues, the
most effectual course is to empale them with three good quarter stakes of
competent length set in triangle and made fast to one another by short pieces
above and beneath; in which a few Brambles being stuck, secure it abundantly
without that choking or fretting, to which Trees are obnoxious that are only
single Staked and Bushed as the vulgar manner is; Nor is the charge of this so
considerable, as the great advantage, accounting for the frequent reparations
which the other will require. Where Cattle do not come, I find a good piece of
Rope, tied fast about the neck of Trees upon a wisp of straw to preserve it
from galing; and the other end tightly strein'd to a hook or peg in the ground
(as the Shrouds in Ships are fastened to the Masts) sufficiently stablishes my
Trees against the Western blasts without more trouble; for the Winds of other
quarters seldom infest us. But these Cords had need be well pitched to preserve
them from wett, and so they will last many Years: I cannot in the mean time
conceal what a noble Person has assured me, that in his goodly Plantations of
Trees in Scotland, where they are continually exposed to much greater, and more
impetuous Winds than we are usually acquainted with; he never stakes any of his
Trees; but upon all disasters of this kind, causes only his Servants to
redress, and set them up again as often as they happen to be overthrown; which he
has affirmed to me, thrives better with them, than with those which he has
staked; and that at last they strike root so fast, as nothing but the Axe is
able to prostrate them; and there is good reason for it in my opinion, whilst
these concussions of the Roots, loosning the mould, not only make room for
their more easy insinuations, but likewise opens, and prepares it to receive,
and impart the better nourishment: It is in another place I suggest that
Transplanted Pines and Firrs, for want of their penetrating Tap roots, are
hardly consistent against these Gusts after they are grown high; especially
where they are set close, and in Tufts, which betraies them to the greater
disadvantage; And therefore such Trees do best in Walks, and at competent
distances, where they escape tolerably well: Such therefore as we design for
Woods of them, should be sowed, and never removed; but of this hereafter. I now
proceed to particulars.

CHAP. III. Of the Oak.
Oak.
1. RObur, the Oak, I have sometimes considered it very seriously, what should
move Pliny to make a whole Chapter of one only Line, which is less then the
Argument alone of most of the rest in his huge Volumn: but the weightiness of
the Matter does worthily excuse him, who is not wont to spare his Words, or his
Reader. Glandiferi maxim generis omnes, quibus honos apud Romanos perpetuus.
Mast-bearing-trees were principally those which the Romans held in chiefest
repute, lib. 6. cap. 3. And in the following where he treats of Chaplets, and
the dignity of the Civic Coronet, it might be composed of the Leaves or
Branches of any Oak, provided it were a bearing Tree, and had Acorns upon it.
It is for the esteem which these wise, and glorious people had of this Tree
above all others, that I will first begin with the Oak.

2. The Oak is of four kinds; two of which are most common with us; (for we
shall say little of the Cerris, goodly to look on, but for little else) the
Quercus urbana, which grows more up-right, and being clean, and lighter is
fittest for Timber: And the Robur or Quercus Sylvestris, (taking Robur for the
general name, at least, as contradistinct from the rest) which is of an hard,
black grain, bearing a smaller Acorn, and affecting to spread in branches, and
to put forth his Roots more above ground; and therefore in the planting, to be
allowed a greater distance; viz. from twenty five, to forty foot; (nay
sometimes as many yards) whereas the other shooting up more erect will be
contented with fifteen: This kind is farther to be distinguished by his
fullness of leaves, which tarnish, and becoming yellow at the fall, do commonly
clothe it all the Winter, the Roots growing very deep and straggling. The Author
of Britannia Baconica speaks of an Oak, in Lanhadron Park in Cornwall, which
bears constantly leaves speckl'd with White; and of another called the
Painted-Oak, which I only mention here, that the variety may be compared by
some ingenious person thereabouts, as well as the truth of the fatal
prae-admonition of Oaks bearing strange leaves.

3. It is in the mean time the propagation of this large spreading Oak, which
is especially recommended for the excellency of the Timber, and that his
Majesty's Forests were well and plentifully stored with them; because they
require room, and space to amplify and expand themselves, and would therefore
be planted at more remote distances, and free from all encumbrances: And this
upon consideration how slowly a full-grown Oak mounts upwards, and how speedily
they spread, and dilate themselves to all quarters, by dressing and due
culture; so as above forty years advance is to be gained by this only Industry:
And, if thus his Majesty's Forests, and Chases were stored; viz. with this
spreading Tree at handsome Intervals, by which Grazing might be improved for the
feeding of Deer and Cattle under them, (for such was the old Saltus) benignly
visited with the gleams of the Sun, and adorned with the distant Landskips
appearing through the glades, and frequent Valleys.

-- betwixt
Whose rows the azure Sky is seen immix'd,
With Hillocks, Vales, and Fields, as now we see
Distinguished in a sweet variety;
Such places which wild Apple Trees throughout
Adorn, and happy Shrubs grow all about.
Caerula disting^ens inter plaga currere posset
Per tumulos, and convalles, camposque profusa:
Vt nunc esse vides vario distincta lepore
Omnia, quae pomis intersita dulcibus ornant
Arbustisque tenent felicibus obsita circum.
Lucret. l. 5. As the Poet describes his Olive-groves. Nothing could be more
ravishing; for so we might also sprinkle Fruit Trees amongst them (of which
hereafter) for Sider, and many singular uses, and should find such goodly
Plantations the boast of our Rangers, and Forests infinitely preferrable to any
thing we have yet beheld, rude, and neglected as they are: I say, when his
Majesty shall proceed (as he has designed) to animate this laudable pride into
fashon, Forests and Woods (as well as Fields and Enclosures) will present us
with another face than now they do. And here I cannot but applaud the worthy
Industry of old Sir Harbotle Grimstone, who (I am told) from a very small
Nursery of Acorns, which he sowed in the neglected corners of his ground, did
draw forth such numbers of Oaks of competent growth; as being planted about his
Fields in even, and uniform rows, about one hundred foot from the Hedges;
bush'd, and well watered till they had sufficiently fixed themselves, did
wonderfully improve both the beauty, and the value of his Demeasnes. But I
proceed.

4. Both these kinds would be taken up very young, and Transplanted about
October; some yet for these hardy, and late springing Trees, defer it till the
Winter be well over; but the Earth had need be moist; and though they will grow
tolerably in most grounds; yet do they generally affect the sound, black, deep
and fast mould, rather warm than over wet and cold, and a little rising; for
this produces the firmest Timber; though my L. Bacon prefer that which grows in
the moister grounds for Ship timber, as the most tough, and less subject to
rift: but let us hear Pliny. This is a general Rule, says he; What Trees
soever they be which grow tolerably either on Hills, or Valleys, arise to
greater stature, and spread more amply in the lower ground: But the Timber is
far better, and of a finer grain, which grows upon the Mountains; excepting
only Apple, and Pear trees. And in the 39 cap. lib. 16. The Timber of those
Trees which grow in moist and shady places is not so good as that which comes
from a more exposed situation, nor is it so close, substantial and durable;
upon which he much prefers the Timber growing in Tuscany, before that toward
the Venetian side, and upper part of the Gulf: And that Timber so growing was
in greatest esteem long before Pliny, we have the spear of Agamemnon -- (...):
from a Tree so exposed; and Dydimus gives the reason. (...) (says he) (...),
etc. For that being continually weather-beaten they become hardier and tougher.
The result of all is, that upon occasion of special Timber, there is a very
great and considerable difference; so as some Oaken Timber proves manifestly
weaker, more spungie, and sooner decaying than other: The like may be affirmed
of Ash, and other kinds; and generally speaking, the close-grain'd is the
stoutest, and most permanent: But of this let the industrious consult that
whole tenth Chapter in the second Book of Vitruvius, where he expressly treats
of this Argument, De Abiete supernate and infernate, cum Apennini descriptione:
Where we note concerning Oak, that it neither prospers in very hot, nor
excessive cold Countries; and therefore there is little good of it to be found
in Africa, or indeed, the lower, and most southern parts of Italy (for the
Venetians have excellent Timber) nor in Denmark or Norway comparable to ours;
it chiefly affecting a temperate Climate, and where they grow naturally in
abundance, it is a promising mark of it; If I were to make choice of the place,
or the Tree, it should be such as grows in the best Cow-pasture, or, up-land
Meadow, where the mould is rich and sweet (Suffolk affords an admirable
instance) and in such places you may also Transplant large Trees with
extraordinary success; And therefore it were not amiss to bore, and search the
ground where you intend to plant or sow before you fall to work; since Earth
too shallow or rockie is not so proper for this Timber; the Roots fix not
kindly, and though for a time they may seem to flourish, yet they will dwindle.

5. But to discourage none, Oaks prosper exceedingly even in gravel, and moist
Clays, which most other Trees abhor; yea, even the coldest Clay grounds that
will hardly graze: But these Trees will frequently make Stands, as they
encounter variety of footing; and sometimes proceed again vigorously, as they
either penetrate beyond, or out-grow their obstructions, and meet better
Earth,; which is of that consequence, that I dare boldly affirm, more than an
hundred years advance is clearly gained by Soil and Husbandry. I have yet read,
that there grow Oaks (some of which have contained ten loads apiece) out of the
very Walls of Silcester in Hantshire, which seem to strike root in the very
Stones; and even in our renouned Forest of Dean it self, some goodly Oaks have
been noted to grow upon Ground, which has been as it were a Rock of ancient
Cinders, buried there many ages since. It is indeed observed, that Oaks which
grow in rough stony grounds, and obstinate clays, are long before they come to
any considerable stature; for such places, and all sort of Clay, is held but a
stepmother to Trees; but in time they afford the most excellent Timber, having
stood long, and got good rooting: The same may we affirm of the lightest sands,
which produces a smoother-grain'd Timber, of all other the most useful for the
Joyner; but that which grows in Gravel is subject to be Frow (as they term it)
and brittle. What improvement the stirring of the ground about the roots of
Oaks is to the Trees I have already hinted; and yet in Copses where they stand
warm, and so thickn'd with the under wood, as this culture cannot be practiced,
they prove in time to be goodly Trees. I have of late tried the Graffing of
Oaks, but as yet with slender success; Ruellius indeed affirms it will take
the Pears and other Fruit, and if we may credit the Poet, The sturdy Oak does
Golden Apples bear.
-- Aurea durae
Mala feraut quercus.
Ecl. 8. And under Elmes swine do the Mast devour.
Glandemque sues fregere sub Vlmo.
Geor. Which I conceive to be the more probable, for that the Sap of the Oak is
of an unkind tincture to most Trees. But for this Improvement, I would rather
advise Inoculation, as the ordinary Elm upon the Witch-Hasel, for those large
leaves we shall anon mention, and which are so familiar in France.

6. That the Transplanting of young Oaks gains them ten years Advance some
happy persons have affirmed: from this belief, if in a former Impression I have
desired to be excused, and produced my Reasons for it, I shall not persist
against any sober man's Experience; and therefore leave this Article to their
choice; since (as the Butchers phrase is) change of Pasture makes fat Calves;
and so Transplantations of these hard wood-trees, when young, may possibly, by
an happy hand, in fit season, and other circumstances of Soil, Sun, and Room
for growth, be an improvement: But as for those who advise us to plant Oaks of
too great a stature, they hardly make any considerable progress in an Age, and
therefore I cannot encourage it unless the ground be extraordinarily
qualified: Yet if any be desirous to make trial of it let their Stems be of the
smoothest, and tenderest Bark; for that is ever an indication of youth, as well
as the paucity of their Circles, which in disbranching, and cutting the head
off, at five or six foot height (a thing, by the way, which the French usually
spare when they Transplant this Tree) may (before you stir their Roots) serve
for the more certain Guide; and then plant them immediately, with as much Earth
as will adhere to them, in the place destined for their station; abating only
the tap roots, which is that down right, and stubby part of the Roots (which
all Trees raised of Seeds do universally produce) and quickening some of the
rest with a sharp knife (but sparing the Fibrous, which are the main Suckers
and Mouths of all Trees) spread them in the fosse, or pit which has been
prepared to receive them. I say in the fosse, unless you will rather trench the
whole Field, which is incomparably the best; and infinitely to be preferred
before narrow pits and holes (as the manner is) in case you plant any number
considerable, the Earth being hereby made loose, easier and penetrable for the
Roots, about which you are to cast that Mould which (in opening of the Trench)
you took from the Surface, and purposely laid apart; because it is sweet,
mellow, and better impregnated: But in this Work, be circumspect never to inter
your Stem deeper than you found it standing; for profound buryings very
frequently destroys a Tree; though an Error seldom observed: If therefore the
Roots be sufficiently covered to keep the Body steady and erect, it is enough;
and the not minding of this trifling Circumstance does very much deceive our
ordinary Wood-men: For most Roots covet the Air (though that of the Quercus
urbana least of any, for like the Aesculus How much to heaven her towering head
ascends,
So much toward hell her piercing root extends.
-- Quod quantum vertice ad auras
(Aethereas, tantum radicem Tartara tendit)
Geo. 2. And the perfection of that does almost as much concern the prosperity
of a Tree, as of Man himself; since Homo is but Arbor inversa; which prompts me
to this curious, but important Advertisement; That the Position be likewise
sedulously observed.

7. For, the Southern parts being more dilated, and the pores exposed (as
evidently appears in their Horizontal Sections) by the constant Excentricity of
their Hyperbolical Circles, being now on the sudden, and at such a season
converted to the North, does sterve, and destroy more Trees (how careful
soever men have been in ordering the Roots, and preparing the Ground) than any
other Accident whatsoever (neglect of staking, and defending from Cattle
excepted) the importance whereof caused the best of Poets, and most experienced
in this Argument, giving advice concerning this Article, to add.

The Card'nal points upon the Bark they sign,
And as before it stood, in the same line
Place to warm south, or the obverted polo;
Such force has custom, in each tender soul.
Quinetiam Coeli regionem in cortice signant,
Vt quo quaeque modo steterit, qua part calores
Austrinos tulerit, quae terga obverterit axi;
Restituant: Adeo in teneris consuescero multum est.
Geor. li. 1. Which Monition, though Pliny, and some others think good to
neglect, or esteem indifferent, I can confirm from frequent losses of my own,
and by particular trials; having sometimes Transplanted great trees at
Mid-somer with success (the Earth adhearing to the Roots) and miscarried in
others where this Circumstance only was omitted.

To observe therefore the Coast, and side of the stock (especially of
Fruit Trees) is not such a trifle as by some pretended: For if the Air be as
much the Mother or Nurse, as Water and Earth, (as more than probable it is)
such blossoming Plants as court the motion of the Meridian Sun, do as 'twere
evidently point out the advantage they receive by their position by the
clearness, politure, and comparative splendour of the South side: And the
frequent mossinesse of most Trees on the opposite side, does sufficiently note
the unkindnesse of that Aspect; and which is most evident in the bark of Oaks
white and smooth; The Trees growing more kindly on the South side of an Hill,
than those which are exposed to the North, with an hard, dark, rougher, and
more mossie Integument, as I can now demonstrate in a prodigious coat of it,
investing some Pyracanths which I have removed to a Northern dripping shade. I
have seen (writes a worthy Friend to me on this occasion) whole Hedge-rows of
Apples and Pears that quite perished after that shelter was removed: The good
Husbands expected the contrary, and that the Fruit should improve, as freed
from the predations of the Hedge; but use and custom made that shelter
necessary; and therefore (says he) a stock for a time is the weaker, taken out
of a Thicket, if it be not well protected from all sudden and fierce invasions
either of crude Air or Winds: Nor let any be deterred, if being to remove many
Trees, he shall esteem it too consumptive of time; for with a Brush dipped in
any white color, or Oaker, a thousand may be marked as they stand, in a
moment; and that once done, the difficulty is over. I have been the larger upon
these two Remarks, because I find them so material, and yet so much neglected.

8. There are other Rules concerning the situation of Trees; the former Author
commending the North-east-wind both for the flourishing of the Tree, and
advantage of the Timber; but to my observation in our Climates, where those
sharp winds do rather flanker than blow fully opposite upon our Plantations,
they thrive best; and there are as well other Circumstances to be considered,
as they respect Rivers and Marshes obnoxious to unwholsom and poisonous Fogs;
Hills, and Seas, which expose them to the weather; and those sylvifragi venti,
our cruel, and tedious Western-winds; all which I leave to Observation, because
these Accidents do so universally govern, that it is not easy to determine
farther than that the Timber is commonly better qualified which has endured
the colder Aspects without these prejudices: And hence it is, that Seneca
observes Wood most exposed to the Winds to be the most strong and solid, and
that therefore Chiron made Achilles's Spear of a Mountain-tree; and of those
the best which grow thin, not much sheltered from the North. Again,
Theophrastus seems to have special regard to places; exemplifying in many of
Greece, which exceeded others for good Timber, as doubtless do our Oaks in the
Forest of Dean all others of England: and much certainly there may reasonably
be attributed to these advantages for the growth of Timber, and of almost all
other Trees, as we daily see by their general improsperity where the ground is
a hot gravel, and a loose earth: An Oak or Elm in such a place shall not in an
hundred years overtake one of fifty planted in its proper Soil; though next to
this and (happily) before it, I prefer the good Air: But thus have they such vast
Junipers in Spain; and the Ashes in some parts of the Levant (as of old n^er
Troy) so excellent, as it was after mistaken for Cedar, so great was the
difference; as now the Cantabrian or Spanish exceeds any we have else where in
Europe. And we shall sometimes in our own Country see Woods within a little of
each other, and to all appearance, growing on the same Soil, that Oaks of
twenty years growth, or forty, will in the same bulk of Timber, contain their
double in Heart and Timber; and that in one the Heart will not be so big as a
man's Arm, when the trunk exceeds a man's body: This ought therefore to be
weighed in the first plantation of Copses, and a good Eye may discern it in the
first Shoot; the difference proceeding doubtless from the variety of the Seed,
and therefore great care should be had of its goodness, and that it be gathered
from the best sort of Trees, as was formerly hinted, c. 1.

9. Veterem Arborem Transplantare was said of a difficult enterprise; Yet
before we take leave of this Paragraph, concerning the Transplanting of great
Trees, and to show what is possible to be effected in this kind, with cost, and
industry; Count Maurice (the late Governor of Brasil for the Hollanders)
planted a Grove near his delicious Paradise of Friburge, containing six hundred
Coco-trees of eighty years growth, and fifty foot high to the nearest bough:
these he wafted upon Floats, and Engines, four long miles, and planted them so
luckily, that they bare abundantly the very first year; as Gasper Barlaeus has
related in his elegant Description of that Princes expedition: Nor has this
only succeeded in the Indies alone; Monsieur de Fiat (one of the Marshals of
France) has with huge Oaks done the like at de Fiat: shall I yet bring you
nearer home? A great person in Devon, planted Oaks as big as twelve Oxen could
draw, to supply some defect in an Avenue to one of his houses; as the Right
Honorable the Lord Fits-Harding, late Treasurer of his Majesty's household,
assured me; who had himself likewise practiced the Removing of great Oaks by a
particular address extremely ingenious, and worthy the communication.

10. Choose a Tree as big as your thigh, remove the earth from about him; cut
through all the collateral Roots, till with a competent strength you can
enforce him down upon one side, so as to come with your Ax at the Tap-root; cut
that off, redress your Tree, and so let it stand covered about with the Mould
you loosened from it, till the next year, or longer if you think good; then
take it up at a fit season; it will likely have drawn new tender Roots apt to
take, and sufficient for the Tree, wheresoever you shall Transplant him: Pliny
notes it as a common thing, to re-establish huge Trees which have been blown
down, part of their Roots torn up, and the body prostrate; and, in particular,
of a Firr, that when it was to be Transplanted had a tap-root which went no
less than eight cubits perpendicular; and to these I could superadd, but I
proceed. To facilitate the Removal of such monstrous Trees, for the Adornment
of some particular place, or the rarity of the Plant, there is this expedient.
A little before the hardest Frosts surprise you, make a square Trench about
your Tree, at such distance from the Stem as you judge sufficient for the Root;
dig this of competent depth, so as almost quite to undermine it; by placing
blocks, and quarters of wood, to sustain the Earth; this done, cast in as much
Water as may fill the Trench, or at least sufficiently wet it, unless the
ground were very moist before. Thus let it stand, till some very hard Frost do
bind it firmly to the Roots, and then convey it to the pit prepared for its new
station; but in case the mould about it be so ponderous as not to be removed by
an ordinary force; you may then raise it with a Crane or Pully hanging between
a Triangle, which is made of three strong and tall Limbs united at the top,
where a Pully is fastened, as the Cables are to be under the quarters which bear
the earth about the Roots: For by this means you may weigh up, and place the
whole weighty Clod upon a Trundle to be conveyed, and Replanted where you
please, being let down prependicularly into the place by the help of the
foresaid Engine. And by this address you may Transplant Trees of a wonderful
stature, without the least disorder; and many times without topping, or
diminution of the head, which is of great importance where this is practiced to
supply a Defect, or remove a Curiosity.

11. Some advise, that in planting of Oaks, etc. four, or five, be suffered to
stand very near to one another, and then to leave the most prosperous, when
they find the rest to disturb his growth; but I conceive it were better to
plant them at such distances, as they may least incommode one another: For
Timber Trees, I would have none nearer then forty foot where they stand
closest; especially of the spreading kind.

12. Lastly, Trees of ordinary stature Transplanted (being first well watered)
must be sufficiently staked, and Bush'd about with thorns, or with some thing
better, to protect them from the concussions of the Winds, and from the casual
rubbing, and poisonous brutting of Cattle and Sheep, the oylinesse of whose
Wool is also very noxious to them; till being well grown, and fixed (which by
seven years will be to some competent degree) they shall be able to withstand
all accidental invasions, but the Axe; for I am now come to their Pruning and
Cutting, in which work the Seasons are of main importance.

13. Therefore, if you would propagate Trees for Timber, cut not off their
heads at all, nor be too busy with lopping: but if you desire Shade, and Fuel,
or bearing of Mast alone, lop off their tops, sear, and unthriving Branches
only; If you intend an outright felling, expect till November; for this
praemature cutting down of Trees before the Sap is perfectly at rest will be to
your exceeding prejudice, by reason of the Worm, which will certainly breed in
the Timber which is felled before that period: But in case you cut only for the
Chimney, you need not be so punctual as to the time; yet for the benefit of
what you let stand observe the Moons increase. The Reason of these differences,
is; because this is the best reason for the growth of the Tree which you do not
fell, the other for the durablenesse of the Timber which you do: Now that which
is to be burnt is not so material for lasting, as the growth of the Tree is
considerable for the Timber: But of these particulars more at large in Cap. 30.

14. The very stumps of Oak, especially that part which is dry, and above
ground being well grubb'd, is many times worth the pains and charge, for sundry
rare, and hard works; and where Timber is dear. I could name some who
abandoning this to workmen for their pains only, when they perceived the great
advantage, repented of their Bargain, and undertaking it themselves, were
gainers above half: I wish only for the expedition of this knotty work, some
effectual Engine were devised; such as I have been told a worthy Person of this
Nation made use of, by which he was able with one man to perform more than with
twelve Oxen; and surely, there might be much done by fastening of Iron hooks and
fangs about one Root to extract another; the hoock chayn'd to some portable
Screw or Winch: I say such an invention might effect wonders not only for the
extirpation of Roots, but the prostrating of huge Trees: That small Engine,
which by some is called the German-devil, reformed, after this manner, and duly
applied, might be very expedient for this purpose, and therefore we have
exhibited the following figure and submit it to improvement.



A The hand that keeps the Rope, b close upon the Cylinder c which is moved by
a Pinnion of three or four teeth: d which moves a larger Iron Wheel f. e the
Handle put upon the Spindle of the Pinnion, to turn it withal.

The whole Frame is let into a bigger piece of Wood, viz. h being about four
foot in length, and one in breadth, and the other end of the Roller or
Cylinder, is sustein'd by a lesser block of Wood (i) g the Plate which holds
the Wheel and Pinnion in the larger block. Note,

That the Cylinder may be made of good tough Iron, about four inches in
diameter, and fourteen or sixteen inches in length, and the toothed Wheel f of
the like stuff, and of a thickness proportionable.

But this is to be practiced only where you design a final extirpation; for
some have drawn suckers even from an old stub root; but they certainly perish
by the Moss which invades them, and are very subject to grow rotten. Pliny
speaks of one Root which took up an entire Acre of Ground, and Theophrastus
describes the Lycean Platanus to have spread an hundred foot; if so, the
Argument may hold good for their growth after the Tree is come to its period.
They made Cups of the Roots of Oak heretofore, and such a curiosity Athenaeus
tells us was carved by Thericleus himself; and there is a way so to tinge Oak
after long burying and soaking in Water, which gives it a wonderful politure,
as that it has frequently been taken for a course Ebony.

15. There is not in nature a thing more obnoxious to deceit, then the buying
of Trees standing, upon the reputation of their Appearance to the eye, unless
the Chapman be extraordinarily judicious; so various are their hidden, and
concealed Infirmities, till they be felled, and sawn out: so as if to any thing
applicable, certainly there is nothing which does more perfectly confirm it
then the most flourishing outside of Trees, Fonti nulla fides. A Timber-tree
is a Merchant Adventurer, you shall never know what he is worth, till he be
dead.

16. Oaks are in some places (where the soil is specially qualified) ready to
be cut for Cops in fourteen years and sooner; I compute from the first
semination; though it be told as an instance of high encouragement (and as
indeed it merits) that a Lady in Northamptonshire sowed Acorns, and lived to
cut the Trees produced from them, twice in two and twenty years; and both as
well grown as most are in sixteen or eighteen. This yet is certain, that Acorns
set in Hedg-rows have in thirty years born a stem of a foot diametre.
Generally, Copps-wood should be cut close, and at such Intervals as the growth
requires; which being seldom constant, depends much on the places, and the
kinds, the mould and the air, and for which there are extant particular
Statutes to direct us, of all which more at large hereafter. Oak for Tan-bark
may be felled from April to the last of June, by a Statute in the 1 Jacobi.

17. To enumerate now the incomparable Uses of this Wood, were needless: But
so precious was the esteem of it, that of Old there was an express Law amongst
the Twelve Tables concerning the very gathering of the Acorns, though they
should be found fall^n into another man's Ground: The Land and the Sea do
sufficiently speak for the improvement of this excellent material; Houses, and
Ships, Cities, and Navies are built with it; and there is a kind of it so
tough, and extremely compact, that our sharpest Tools will hardly enter it, and
scarcely the very Fire it self, in which it consumes but slowly, as seeming to
partake of a ferruginous, and mettallin shining nature, proper for sundry
robust Uses; It is doubtless of all Timber hitherto known, the most
universally useful and strong; for though some Trees be harder, as Box,
Cornus, Ebony, and diverse of the Indian Woods; yet we find them more fragil,
and not so well qualified to support great incumbencies and weights, nor is
there any Timber more lasting which way soever used: There has (we know) been
no little stir amongst Learned men of what material the Cross was made, on
which our blessed Savior suffered: The contentions about it are very great:
but, besides Lipsius, Angelus Rocca, Alphonsus Ciaconus, and diverse others,
writing on this subject, and upon accurate examination of the many fragments
pretended to be parcells of it; it is generally concluded to have been the Oak,
and I do verily believe it; since those who have described those Countries,
assure us there is no Tree more frequent, which with relation to several
celebrations and Mysteries under Oaks in the Old Testament, has been the
subject of many fine discourses. That which is twined, and a little wreathed
(easily to be discerned by the texture of the Bark) is best to support
Burdens, for Posts, Columns, Summers, etc. for all which our English Oak is
infinitely preferrable to the French, which is nothing so useful, nor
comparably so strong; insomuch as I have frequently admired at the sudden
failing of most goodly Timber to the Eye, which being employed to these Uses
does many times most dangerously fly in sunder, as wanting that native spring,
and toughness, which our English Oak is indu'd withal. And here we forget not
the stresse which Sir H. Wotton and other Architects put even in the very
position of their growth, their native straightness and loftiness, for
Columns, Supporters, Cross-beams, etc. and it is found that the rough grained
body of a stubbed Oak, is the fittest Timber for the Case of a Sider-Mill, and
such like Engines, as best enduring the unquietness of a ponderous
Rolling-stone. For Shingles, Pales, Lathes, Coopers ware, Clap-board for
Wainscot, and some pannells, are curiously vein'd, of much esteem in former
times, till the finer grained Norway Timber came amongst us, which is likewise
of a whiter color: It is observed that Oak will not easily glue to other Wood;
no not very well with its own kind; and some sorts will never cohere tolerably,
as the Box and Horn-beam, though both hard woods; so nor Service with Cornell,
etc. Oak is excellent for Wheel-spokes, Pinns and Peggs for Tyling, etc. Mr.
Blithe makes Sparrs and small building- Timber of Oaks of eleven years growth,
which is a prodigious advance, etc. the smallest and streightest is best;
discovered by the upright tenor of the Bark, as being the most proper for
cleaving: The knottiest for Waterworks, Piles and the like; because 'twill
drive best, and last longest, the crooked, yet firm, for knee-timber in
Shipping, Mill-wheels, etc. Were planting of these Woods more in use, we should
banish our hoops of Hasel, etc. for those of good coppet Oak, which being made
of the younger shoots, are exceeding tough and strong: One of them being of
Ground-Oak will out-last six of the best Ash; but this our Coopers love not to
hear of, who work by the great for Sale, and for others. The smaller
trunchions, and spray, make Billet, Bavine and Coals; and the Bark is of price
with the Tanner and Dyer, to whom the very Saw-dust is of use, as are the Ashes
and Lee to cure the roapishness of Wine: And it is probable the Cups of our
Acorns would tan Leather as well as the Bark. The Ground-Oak while young is
used for Poles, Cudgels and walking-staffs, much come into mode of late, but to
the wast of many a hopeful Plant which might have proved good Timber; and I
the rather declaime against the Custom, because I suspect they are such as are
for the most part cut and stolen by idle Persons, and brought up to London in
great bundles, without the knowledge or leave of the Owners, who would never
have gleaned their Copses for such trifling uses: Here I am again to give a
general notice of the peculiar excellency of the Roots of most Trees, for fair,
beautiful, chamleted, and lasting Timber, applicable to many purposes; such as
formerly made Hafts for Daggers, Hangers, Knives, Handles for staves,
Tobacco-Boxes, and elegant Joyners-work, and even for some Mathematical
Instruments of the larger size, to be had either in, or near the Roots of many
Trees; however it is a kindness to premonish Stewards and Surveyors, that they
do not negligently wast those materials: Nor may we here omit to mention the
Galls, Missletoe, Polypod, Agaric (used in Antidots) Vuae, Fungus's to make
Tinder, and many other useful Excrescencies, to the number of above twenty,
which doubtless discovers the variety of transudations, percolations and
contextures of this admirable Tree. Pliny affirms that the Galls break out
altogether in one night about the beginning of June, and arrive to their full
growth in one day; this I recommend to the experience of some extraordinary
vigilant Wood-man. Galls are of several kinds, but grow upon a different
species of Robur from any of ours, which never arive to any maturity; the white
and imperforated are the best. What benefit the Mast does universally yield for
the fatting of Hogs and Deer I shall show upon another occasion, before the
conclusion of this Discourse. A Peck of Acorns a day, with a little Bran, will
make an Hog ('it is said) increase a pound-weight per diem for two months
together. They give them also to Oxen mingled with Bran, chopped or broken;
otherwise they are apt to sprout and grow in their bellies. Others say, they
should first be macerated in water, to extract their malignity; cattle many
times perishing without this preparation. Cato advises the Husbandman to
reserve ^40 bushels of Acorns for his Oxen, mingled with a like quantity of
Beans and Lupines, and to drench them well. But in truth they are more proper
for Swine, and being so made small will fatten Pigeons, Peacocks, Turkies,
Pheasants, and Poultry: nay it is reported, that some Fishes feed on them,
especially the Tunny, in such places of the coast where trees hang over Arms of
the Sea. Acorns were heretofore the food of Men, nay of Jupiter himself, (as
well as other productions of the Earth) till their luxurious palats were
debauched: and even in the Romans time, the custom was in Spain to make a
second service of Acorns and Mast, (as the French now do of Marrons and
Chestnuts) which they likewise used to roast under the embers.

-- Fed with the Oaken Mast
The aged Trees themselves in years surpassed.
-- Et querna glande repasta
Aequasse annosas vivendo corpora Quercus.
And men had indeed hearts of Oak; I mean, not so hard, but health, and
strength, and lived naturally, and with things easily parable and plain. Blessed
Age of the World, just Nymph, when Man did dwell
Under thy shade, whence his provision fell;
Sallads the meal: Wildings were the Dissert,
No Tree yet learned by ill-exampled Art
With in^ititious fruit to symbolize,
As in an Emblem, our Adulteries.
Foelix illa aetas mundi justissima Nymphe,
Cum dabat umbra domum vivam tua, cum domus ipsa
Decidua Dominos pascebat fruge quietos,
Solaque praebebaut Sylvestria poma secundas
Gramineis epulas mensis; nondum art magistra
Arbor Adulteriis praeluserat iusita nostris, etc.
Couleii Pl. L. 6. as the sweet Poet bespeaks the Dryad; But it is in another
place where I show you what this Acorn was; and even now I am told, that those
small young Acorns which we find in the Stock-doves Craws, are a delicious
fare, as well as those incomparable Salads of young herbs taken out of the maws
of Partridges at a certain season of the year, which gives them a preparation
far exceeding all the art of Cookery. Oaks bear also a knur, full of a cottony
matter, of which they anciently made Wick for their Lamps and Candles; and
among the Selectiora Remedia of Jo. Praevotius there is mention of an Oil e
querna glande Chymically extracted, which he affirms to be of the longest
continuance, and least consumptive of any other whatsoever, for such lights,
ita ut uncia singulis mensibus vix absumatur continuo igne. The leaves of Oaks
abundantly congested on Snow, preserves it as well for wine, as a deep pit, or
the most artificial Refrigeratory. Varro affirms, they made Salt of Oak ashes,
with which they sometimes seasoned meat, but more frequently made use of it to
sprinkle among and fertilize their seed-corn: which minds me of a certain Oak
found buried somewhere in Transylvania, near the Salt Pits, that was entirely
converted into an hard salt, when they came to examine it by cutting. This
experiment (if true) may possibly encourage some other attempts for the
multiplying of Salt. Of the Galls is made the ground and basis of Inks and
several Dies, especially sadder colors, and are a great revenue to those who
have quantities of them. The very Moss of the Oak, viz. that which is white,
composes the choicest Cypresse-powder, which is esteemed good for the head: but
Impostors familiarly vend other Mosses under that name, as they do the Fungi
for the true Agaric, to the great scandal of Physic. Young red Oaken leaves
decocted in wine, make an excellent gargle for a sore mouth: and almost every
part of this Tree is sovereign against Fluxes in general. The dew that impearls
the leaves in May, insolated, meteorizes and sends up a liquor, which is of
admirable effect in Ruptures: And a water distilled from the Acorns are good
against the Phthisick, Stitch in the side, and heals inward Ulcers, breaks the
Stone, and refrigerates Inflammations, being applied with Linen dipped therein:
nay, the Acorns themselves eaten fasting kill the worms, provoke urine, and
(some affirm) break even the Stone it self. The Coals of Oak beaten and mingled
with honey, cures the Carbuncle; to say nothing of the Viscous's, Polypods, and
other Exerescences, of which innumerable Remedies are composed, noble
Antidotes, Syrups, etc. Nay, it is reported, that the very shade of this tree is
so wholesome, that the sleeping or lying under it becomes a present remedy to
Paralyticks, and recovers those whom the mistaken malign influence of the
Walnut-tree has smitten. To conclude, and upon serious meditation of the
various uses of this and other trees, we cannot but take notice of the
admirable Mechanism of Vegetables in general; as in particular in this species;
that by the diversity of Percolations and Strainers, and by mixtures as it were
of divine Chemistry, various concoctions, etc. the sap should be so green on
the indented leaves, so lustily esculent for our hardier and rustic
Constitutions in the fruit; so flat and palid in the Atramental Galls; and
happily so prognostic in the Apple; so Suberous in the Bark (for even the Cork
tree is but a courser Oak) so Oozie in the Tanners pit; and in that subduction
so wonderfully specific in corroborating the Entrails, and Bladder, Reins,
Loins, Back, etc. which are all but the gifts and qualities, with many more,
that these robust sons of the Earth afford us; and that in other specific's,
even the most despicable and vulgar Elder imparts to us in its rind, leaves,
buds, blossoms, berries, ears, pith, bark, etc. Which hint may also carry our
remarks upon all the varieties of Shape, Leaf, Seed, Fruit, Timber, Grain,
Color, and all those other forms that Philosophers have enumerated; but which
were here too injurious for us to repeat. Let us end with the Poet: When Ships
for bloody combat we prepare,
Oak affords plank, and arms our Men of War;
Maintains our fires, makes plows to till the ground,
For use no Timber like the Oak is found.
Si quando armandae naves, and bella paranda,
Det quercus nautis tabulata, det arma furore
Bellantum; det ligna foco, det aratra colono,
Aut aliis alios porro sumatur in usus.
Rapinus.

CHAP. IV. Of the Elm.
Elm.
1. ULmus the Elm, There are four, or five sorts, and from the difference of the
Soil and Air diverse spurious: Two of these kinds are most worthy our culture,
the vulgar, viz. the Mountain Elm, which is taken to be the Oriptelea of
Theophrastus; being of a less jagged and smaller leaf; and the Vernacula or
French Elm, whose leaves are thicker, and more florid, glabrous and smooth,
delighting in the lower and moister grounds, where they will sometimes rise to
above an hundred foot in height; and a prodigious growth, in less than an Age;
my self having seen one planted by the hand of a Countess yet living, which is
near twelve foot in compass, and of an height proportionable; notwithstanding
the numerous progeny which grows under the shade of it, some whereof are at
least a foot in Diameter, that for want of being seasonably transplanted, must
needs have hindered the procerity of their ample and indulgent Mother: I am
persuaded some of these are Viviradices and Traduces produced of the falling
seeds.

2. For though both these sorts are raised of Appendices or Suckers (as anon we
shall describe) yet this latter comes well from the Samera or Seeds, and
therefore I suppose it to be the ancient Attinea, for such an Elm they
acknowledge to be raised of Seeds, which being ripe about the beginning of
March (though frequently not till the following Month) will produce them; as we
see abundantly in the Gardens of the Thuylleries, and that of Luxembourg, at
Paris, where they usually sow themselves and come up very thick; and so do they
in many places of our Country, though so seldom taken notice of, as that it is
esteemed a fable, by the less observant and ignorant vulgar; let it be tried
in season, by turning and raking some fine earth, often refreshed under some
amply spreading Tree, or to raise them of their Seeds (being well dried a day
or two before) sprinkled in Beds prepared of good earth, and siefting some of
the finest mould thinly over them, and watering them when need requires. Being
risen an inch above ground (refreshed and preserved from the scraping of Birds
and Poultry) comfort the tender seedlings by a second siefting of more sine
earth, to establish them; thus keep them clean weeded for the first two years;
or till being of fitting stature to remove, you may thin, and Transplant them
in the same manner as you were directed for young Oaks; only they shall not
need above one cutting, where they grow less regular and hopeful. But because
this is an Experiment of some curiosity, obnoxious to many casualties, and that
the producing them from the Mother-roots of greater Trees is very facile and
expeditious (besides the numbers which are to be found in the Hedge-rows, and
Woods, of all plantable sizes) I rather advise our Forester to furnish himself
from those places.

3. The Suckers which I speak of are produced in abundance from the Roots,
whence, being dexterously separated, after the Earth has been well loosned, and
planted about the end of October, they will grow very well: Nay, the stubs
only, which are left in the ground after a felling (being fenced in as far as
the Roots extend) will furnish you with plenty, which may be transplanted from
the first year or two, successively, by slipping them from the Roots, which
will continually supply you for many years after that the body of the
Mother-tree has been cut down: And from hence probably is sprung that (I fear)
mistake of Salmasius and others, where they write of the growing of their Chips
(I suppose having some of the Bark on) scattered in hewing of their Timber; the
Error proceeding from this, that after an Elm-tree has been felled, the
numerous Suckers which shoot from the remainders of the latent Roots, seem to
be produced from this dispersion of the Chips: Let this yet be more accurately
examined; for I pronounce nothing Magisterially, since it is so confidently
reported.

4. I have known Stakes sharpened at the ends for other purposes, take root
familiarly in moist grounds, and become Trees; and diverse have essayed with
extraordinary success the trunchions of the Boughs and Arms of Elms cut to the
scantling of a man's arm, about an ell in length. These must be chopp'd on each
side opposite, and laid into trenches about half a foot deep, covered about two
or three fingers deep with good mould. The season for this work is toward the
exit of January, or early in February if the Frosts impede not, and after the
first year, you may cut or saw the trunchions off in as many places as you find
cause, and as the shoots and rooted Sprouts will direct you for
transplantation. Another expedient for the propagation of Elms is this; let
trenches be sunk at a good distance ( viz. twenty or thirty yards) from such
Trees as stand in Hedge-rows, and in such order as you desire your Elms should
grow; where these gutters are, many young Elms will spring from the small roots
of the adjoining Trees, divide (after one year) the shoots from their
Mother-roots, which you may dexterously do with a sharp spade: These
transplanted, will prove good Trees without any damage to their Progenitors. Or
do thus, Lop a young Elm, the lop being about three years growth, do it in the
latter end of March, when the Sap begins to creep up into the Boughs, and the
Buds ready to break out; cut the Boughs into lengths of four foot slanting,
leaving the knot where the bud seems to put forth in the middle: Interr these
short pieces in trenches of three or four inches deep, and in good mou^d well
trodden, and they will infallibly produce you a Crop, for even the smallest
Suckers of Elms will grow being set when the Sap is newly stirring in them:
There is yet a fourth way no less expeditious, and frequently confirmed with
excellent success: Bare some of the Master-roots of a vigorous Tree within a
foot of the Trunk, or thereabouts, and with your Ax make several Chops, putting
a small stone into every clest, to hinder their closure, and give access to
the wet; then cover them with three, or four inch thick of Earth; and thus they
will send forth Suckers in abundance (I assure you one single Elm thus well
ordered, is a fair Nursery) which after two or three years, you may separate,
and plant in the Vlmarium, or place designed for them; and which if it be in
Plumps (as they call them) within ten or twelve foot of each other, or in
Hedge-rows, it will be the better: For the Elm is a Tree of Consort, Sociable,
and so affecting to grow in Company, that the very best which I have ever seen
do almost touch one another: This also protects them from the Winds, and causes
them to shoot of an extraordinary height; so as in little more than forty
years, they even arrive to a load of Timber; provided they be sedulously and
carefully cultivated, and the Soil propitious. For an Elm does not thrive so
well in the Forest, as where it may enjoy scope for the Roots to dilate and
spread at the sides, as in Hedge-rows and Avenues, where they have the Air
likewise free.

5. There is besides these sorts we have named, one of a more Scabrous harsh
leaf, but very large, which becomes an huge Tree, and is distinguished by the
name of the Witch-hazel in our Statute Books, as serving formerly to make long
Bows of; but the Timber is not so good as the first more vulgar; but the Bark
at time of year, will serve to make a course bast-rope with.

6. Of all the Trees which grow in our Woods, there is none which does better
suffer the Transplantation then the Elm; for you may remove a tree of twenty
years growth with undoubted success: It is an Experiment I have made in a Tree
almost as big more as my waste; but then you must totally disbranch him,
leaving only the Summit entire; and being careful to take him up with as much
Earth as you can, refresh him with abundance of water. This is an excellent,
and expeditious way for great Persons to plant the Accesses of their Houses
with; for being disposed at sixteen, or eighteen foot interval, they will in a
few years bear goodly heads, and thrive to admiration. Some that are very
cautious, emplaster the wounded head of such overgrown Elms with a mixture of
clay and horse-dung, bound about them with a wisp of Hay or fine Moss, and I do
not reprove it, provided they take care to temper it well, so as the Vermin
nestle not in it. But for more ordinary plantations, younger Trees, which have
their bark smooth and tender, about the scantling of your leg, and their heads
trimmed at five or six foot height, are to be preferred before all other. Cato
would have none of these sorts of Trees to be removed till they are five or six
fingers in diameter; others think they cannot take them too young; but
experience (the best Mistress) tells us, that you can hardly plant an Elm too
big. There are who pare away the Root within two fingers of the stem, and quite
cut off the Head; but I cannot commend this extreme severity, no more than I do
the strewing of Oats in the pit; which fermenting with the moisture, and
frequent watering^, is believed much to accelerate the putting forth of the
Roots; not considering, that for want of air they corrupt, and grow musty,
which more frequently suffocates the Roots, and endangers the whole Tree.

7. I have affirmed how patient this Tree is of Transplantation; not only for
that I observe so few of them to grow wild in England, and where it may not be
suspected; but they, or their predecessors have been planted by some
industrious hand; but for that those incomparable Walks and Vistas of them
both at Aranivez, Casa del Campo, Madrid, the Escurial, and other places of
delight belonging to the King and Grandees of Spain, are planted with such as
they report Philip the second caused to be brought out of England; before which
(as that most Honorable Person the Earl of Sandwich now his Majesty's
Ambassador Extraordinary, at that Court writes to me) it does not appear there
were any of those Trees in all Spain. In that Princely Seat it is, that double
rows of them are planted in many places for a league together in length, and
some of them forty yards high, which are kept stripped up to the very top
branch, which must needs render a most glorious, and agreeable effect; no Tree
whatsoever, becoming long Walks and Avenues, comparably to this Majestic
plant: But hear it as sweetly advised as described; An Elm for graceful
verdure, bushy bough,
A lofty top, and a firm rind allow.
Plant Elm in borders, on the Grasse-plots list,
Branches of Elm into thick Arbours twist;
A Gallery of Elm draw to the end
That Eyes can reach, or a breathed race extend.
Vt viror est ulmo laetus, ramique comantes,
Arduus, alta petens and levi cortice truncus.
Vlmum adhibe ordinibus, quoties fundenda per hortum,
Sunt serie spatia ingenti, texendaque totis,
Aestivos contra soles umbracula campis:
Vna alias inter texendis aptior ulmus
Marginibus spatiorum, exornandoque vireto.
Seque adeo series, plano super aequore, tendat
Vlmorum tractu longo; quantum ipsa tuentum
Lumina, vel gressus valiant lustrare sequentum.
Rapinus.

8. The Elm delights in a sound, sweet, and fertile Land, something more
inclined to moisture, and where good pasture is produced; though it will also
prosper in the gravelly, provided there be a competent depth of mould, and be
refreshed with Springs; in defect of which, being planted on the very surface
of the ground (the swarth pared first away, and the earth stirred a foot deep
or more) they will undoubtedly succeed; but in this trial, let the Roots be
handsomely spread, and covered a foot, or more in height, and above all, firmly
staked. This is practicable also for other Trees, where the Soil is over moist,
or unkind: For as the Elm does not thrive in too dry, sandy, or hot grounds, no
more will it abide the cold and spungy; but in places that are competently
fertile, or a little elevated from these annoyances; as we see in the Mounds,
and castings up of Ditches, upon whose banks the Female sort does more
naturally delight; though it seems to be so much more addicted to some places
than to others, that I have frequently doubted, whether it be a pure Indigene
or translatitious; and not only because I have hardly ever known any
considerable Woods of them (besides some few Nurseries near Cambridge, planted
I suppose for store) but almost continually in Tufts, Hedg-rowes, and Mounds;
and that Shropshire, and several other Counties, have rarely, any growing in
many miles together.

9. The Elm is by reason of its aspiring, and tapering growth (unless it be
topped to enlarge the Branches, and make them spread low) the least offensive
to Corn and Pasture grounds, to both which, and the Cattle, they afford a
benign shade, defense, and agreeable Ornament.

10. It would be planted as shallow as might be; for, as we noted, deep
interring of Roots is amongst the Catholic mistakes; and of this, the greatest
to which Trees are obnoxious. Let new planted Elms be kept moist by frequent
refreshings upon some half-rotten Fern, or Litter laid about the foot of the
stem; the earth a little stirred and depressed for the better reception, and
retention of the Water.

11. Lastly, your Plantation must above all things be carefully preserved from
Cattle, and the concussions of impetuous Winds, till they are out of reach of
the one, and sturdy enough to encounter the other.

12. When you lop the side-boughs of an Elm (which may be about January for the
Fire, and more frequently, if you desire to have them tall; or that you would
form them into Hedges (for so they may be kept plashed, and thickened to the
highest twig; affording both a magnificent, and august defense against the
Winds and Sun) I say, when you trim them, be careful to indulge the tops; for
they protect the body of your Trees from the wet, which always invades those
parts first, and will in time perish them to the very heart; so as Elms
beginning thus to decay, are not long prosperous. Sir Hugh Plat relates (as
from an expert Carpenter) that the boughs and branches of an Elm should be left
a foot long next the trunk when they are lop'd; but this is to my certain
observation a very great mistake either in the Relator, or Author; for I have
noted many Elms so disbranched, that the remaining stubs grew immediately
hollow, and were as so many Conduits or Pipes, to hold, and convey the Rain to
the very body and heart of the Tree.

13. There is a Cloister of the right French Elm in the little Garden near to
her Majesty's the Queen Mothers Chapel at Somerset House, which were (I
suppose) planted there, by the industry of the F.F. Capuchines, that will
perfectly direct you to the incomparable use of this noble Tree for shade and
delight, into whatever figure you will accustom them. I have my self procured
some of them from Paris, but they were so abused in the Transportation, that
they all perished save one, which now flourishes with me: I have also heard of
graffing Elms to a great improvement of their heads: Virgil tells us they will
join in Marriage with the Oak, and they would both be tried; and that with the
more probable success, for such lignous kinds, if you graff under the Earth,
upon, or near the very Root it self, which is likely to entertain the Cyon
better than when more exposed, till it be well fixed, and have made some
considerable progress.

14. When you would Fell, let the Sap be perfectly in repose; as it is commonly
about November or December, after the frost has well nipp'd them: I have
already alleged my reason for it; and I am told, that both Oak and Elm so
cut, the very Saplings (whereof Rafters, Spars, etc. are made) will continue as
long as the very heart of the Tree, without decay. In this work, cut your kerse
near to the ground; but have a care that it suffer not in the fall, and be
ruined with its own weight: This depends upon your Wood-mans judgment in
disbranching, and is a necessary caution to the Felling of all other
Timber Trees. If any begin to dote, pick out such for the Ax, and rather trust
to its Successor.

15. Elm is a Timber of most singular use; especially where it may lie
continually dry, or wet in extremes; therefore proper for Waterworks, Mills,
Pipes, Pumps, Aquae-ducts, Ship-planks beneath the Waterline; and some that has
been found buried in Bogs has turned like the most polished, and hardest Ebony,
only discerned by the grain: Also for Wheel-wrights, Handles for the single
Hand-saw, the knotty for Naves, the straight and smooth for Axel-trees, and the
very Roots for curiously dappled works, scarce has any superior for Kerbs of
Coppers, Featheridge, and Weather-boards, Chopping-blocks, Blocks for the
Hatmaker, Trunks, and Boxes to be covered with leather; for Dressers, and
Shovel-board-Tables of great length, and a lustrous Color if rightly seasoned;
also for the Carver, by reason of the tenor of the grain, and toughness which
fits it for all those curious works of Frutages, Foleage, Shields, Statues, and
most of the Ornaments appertaining to the Orders of Architecture; and for not
being much subject to warping; I find that of old they used it even for hinges
and hooks of Doors; but then, that part of the Plank, which grew toward the
top of the Tree, was in work to be always reversed: But besides these and
sundry other employments, it makes also the second sort of Charcoal; and
finally (which I must not omit) the use of the very leaves of this Tree,
especially of the female, is not to be despised; for being suffered to dry in
the Sun upon the Branches, and the spray stripped off about the decrease in
August (as also where the suckers and stolones are super-numerary, and hinder
the thriving of their Nurses) they will prove a great relief to Cattle in
Winter, and scorching Summers, when Hay and fodder is dear; they will eat them
before Oats, and thrive exceedingly well with them; remember only to lay your
Boughs up in some dry and sweet corner of your Barn: It was for this the Poet
praised them, and the Epithet was advised, Fruitful in leaves the Elm.
-- foecundae frondibus Vlmi.
Georg. 2.

In some parts of Herefordshire they gather them in Sacks for their Swine, and
other Cattle according to this Husbandry. But I hear an ill report of them for
Bees, that surfeiting of the blooming Seeds, they are obnoxious to the Lask, at
their first going abroad in Spring, which endangers whole Stock^, if Remedies
be not timely adhibited; therefore it is said in great Elm Countries they do not
thrive, but the truth of which I am yet to learn. The Green leaf of the Elms
contused, heales a green wound or Cut, and boiled with the Bark consolidates
fractur'd bones.

CHAP. V. Of the Beech.
1. THe Beech, [Fagus] (of two or three kinds) and numbered amongst the
glandiferous Trees, Beech*
I rank here before the martial Ash, because it commonly grows to a greater
stature. But here I may not omit a Note of the accurate Critis Palmerius,
Exercit. in Theophrast. l. 3. c. 9.
upon a passage in Theophrastus, where he Animadverts upon his Interpreter, and
shows that the ancient (...) was by no means the Beech, but a kind of Oak; for
that the figure of the fruit is so widely unlike it; that being round, this
triangular; and both Theophrastus and Pausanias make it indeed a Species of
Oak, In Arcad.
wholly differing in Trunk, as well as Fruit and Leaf, to which he adds (what
determines the Controversy) (...), etc. That it is of a firm Timber, not
obnoxious to the Worm, neither of which can so confidently be said of the
Beech. Yet La Cerda too seems guilty of the same mistake: But leaving this,
there are of our Fagi, too or three kinds with us; the Mountain (where it most
affects to grow) which is the whitest, and most sought after by the Turner; and
the Campestral or wild, which is of a blacker color, and more durable. They
are both to be raised from the Mast, and governed like the Oak (of which amply)
and that is absolutely the best way of furnishing a Wood: But they are likewise
to be planted of young seedlings to be drawn out of the places where the
fruitful Trees abound. In transplanting them cut off only the boughs and
bruised parts, two Inches from the stem, to within a yard of the top; but be
very sparing of the Root: This, for such as are of pretty stature. They make
spreading Trees, and noble Shades with their well-furnished and glistering
leaves, being set at forty foot distance; but they grow taller, and more
upright in the Forests, where I have beheld them at eight and ten foot, shoot
into very long Poles; but neither so apt for Timber, nor Fuel: In the Valleys
(where they stand warm and in Consort) they will grow to a stupendous
procerity, though the soil be stony and very barren: Also upon the declivities,
sides, and tops of high Hills, and Chalkie Mountains especially; for they will
strangely insinuate their roots into the bowels of those seemingly impenetrable
places, not much unlike the Firr it self, which, with this so common Tree, the
great Caesar denies to be found in Britanny, Materia cujusque generis, ut in
Gallia, praeter Fagum and abietem: But certainly from a grand mistake, or
rather, for that he had not traveled much up into the Country. Virgil reports
it will graff with the Chestnut.

2. The Beech serves for various Uses of the Housewife; Hence in the Worlds
best years the humble Shed,
Was happily, and fully furnished:
Beech made their Chests, their Beds and the Joyn'd-stools,
Beech made the Board, the Platters, and the Bowls.
Hinc olim juvenis Mundi melioribus annis
Fortunatarum domuum non magna Supeliex
Tota petebatur; Sellas, Armaria, Lectos.
Et Mensas dabat, and Lances, and pocula Fagus, etc.
Couleij Pl. l. 6. with it the Turner makes Dishes, Trays, Rimbs, for Buckets,
and other Utensils, Trenchers, Dresser-boards, etc. likewise for the Wheeler,
Joyner, and Vpholster for Sellyes, Chairs, Stools, Bedsteads, etc. for the
Bellows-maker, and Husbandman his Shovel and Spade-graffs; Floates for Fishers
Nets instead of Corks, is made of its Bark; for Fuel, Billet, Bavin and Coal
though one of the least lasting: Not to omit even the very Shavings for the
fining of Wines. Peter Cresentius writes, that the Ashes of Beech with proper
mixture, is excellent to make Glass with. If the Timber lie altogether under
water, it is little inferior to Elm, as I find it practiced and asserted by
Shipwrights: Of old they made their Vasa Vindimiatoria and Corbes Messoriae (as
we our pots for Strawberries) with the Rind of this Beech, nay, and Vessels to
preserve Wine in, and that curiously wrought Cup which the Shepherd in the
Buchollicks wagers with all, was engraven by Alcimedon upon the Bark of this
tree: And an happy age it seems: -- No Wars did men molest,
When only Beechen-Bowles were in request.
-- nec bella fuerunt,
Faginus astabat dum Scyphus ante dapes.
Tibul. Of the thin Lamina or Scale of this wood (as our Cutlers call it) are
made Scabards for Swords and Bandboxes, superinduced with thin leather or
Paper, Boxes for Writings, Hat-cases, and formerly Book-covers. I wonder we
cannot split it our selves but send into other Countries for such trifles. In
the Cavities of these Trees, Bees much delight to Hive themselves: Yet for all
this, you would not wonder to hear me deplore the so frequent use of this Wood,
if you did consider that the industry of France furnishes that Country for all
domestic Vtensils with excellent Wallnut; a material infinitely preferrable to
the best Beech, which is indeed good only for shade and for fire, as being
brittle, and exceedingly obnoxious to the Worm, where it lies either dry, or
wet and dry, as has been noted; but being put ten days in water, it will
exceedingly resist the worm. Ricciolus much commends it for Oars, and some say
that the vast Argo was built of the Fagus, a good part of it at least, as we
learn out of Apolonius; this will admit of Interpretation. But whilst we thus
condemn the Timber, we must not omit to praise the Mast, which fats our Swine
and Deer, and has in some Families even supported men with bread: Chios
endured a memorable Siege by the benefit of this Mast; and in some parts of
France they now grind the Buck in Mills: It affords a sweet Oil, which the poor
People eat most willingly: But there is yet another benefit which this Tree
presents us; that its very leaves which make a natural, and most agreeable
Canopy all the Summer; being gathered about ^^e Fall, and somewhat before they
are much frost-bitten, afford the best and easiest Mattrasses in the world to
lay under our Quilts instead of straw; because, besides their tenderness and
loose lying together, they continue sweet for seven or eight years long; before
which time straw becomes musty and hard; they are thus used by diverse persons
of quality in Dauphine; and in Swizzerland I have sometimes lain on them to my
great refreshment; so as of this Tree it may properly be said, The Wood's an
House, the leaves a Bed.
-- Sylva domus, cubilia froudes.
Juvenal.

The stagnant water in the hollow Trees cure the most obstinate Tettars, Scabs,
and Scurfs, in Man or Beast, fomenting the part with it; and the Leaves chewed,
are wholesome for the Gums and Teeth, for which the very Buds, as they are in
Winter hardened and dried upon the twiggs, make good Tooth pickers. Swine may be
driven to Mast about the end of August.

CHAP. VI. Of the Ash.
Ash.
1. FRaxinus the Ash, is with us Male and Female, the one affecting the higher
grounds: The other the plains, of a whiter wood, and rising many times to a
prodigious stature; so as in forty years from the Key, an Ash has been sold
for thirty pound sterling: And I have been credibly informed, that one Person
has planted so much of this one sort of Timber in his life time, as has been
valued worth fifty thousand pounds to be bought. These are pretty
encouragements, for a small, and pleasant industry. That there is a lower, and
more knotty sort, every Husbandman can distinguish.

2. The Keys being gathered when they begin to fall (which is about the end of
October, and the ensuing Month) are to be sowed; but not altogether so deep as
your former Masts: Thus they do in Spain: from whence it were good to procure
some of the keys from their best trees: A very narrow Seminary will be
sufficient to store an whole Country: They will lie a full year in the ground
before they appear; therefore you must carefully Fence them all that time and
have patience: But if you would make a considerable Wood of them at once, Dig,
or Plow a parcel of ground, as you would prepare it for Corn and with the Corn
(or what other Grain you think fittest) sow also good store of Keys, some
Crab-kernels, etc. amongst them: Take off your Crop of Corn, or Seed in its
Season, and the next year following it will be covered with young Ashes, which
will be fit either to stand (which I prefer) or be transplanted for diverse
years after; and these you will find to be far better then any you can gather
out of the Woods (especially Suckers, which are worth nothing) being removed at
one foot stature (the sooner the better) provided you defend them well from
Cattle: The reason of this hasty transplanting, is to prevent their obstnate,
and deep rooting; tantus amor terrae -- which makes them hard to be taken up
when they grow older, and that being removed they take no great hold till the
second year, after which, they come away amain: Yet I have planted them of five
and six inches diametre, which have thriven as well as the smaller wands. Cut
not his head at all (which being young is pithy) nor, by any means, the fibrous
part of the Roots; only, that downright, or Tap-root (which gives our
Husbandmen so much trouble in drawing) is to be totally abated: But this work
ought to be in the increase of October, or November, and not in the Spring. We
are (as I told you) willing to spare his head; because being yet young, it is
but of a spongie substance; but being once well fixed, you may cut him as close
to the earth as you please; it will cause him to shoot prodigiously; so as in a
few years to be fit for Pike-staves. Young Ashes are sometimes in Winter
frost-burnt, black as Coals, and then to use the knife is seasonable, though
they do commonly recover of themselves slowly. In South-Spain (where as we said
are the best) after the first dressing, they let them grow till they are so
big, as being cleft into four parts, each part is sufficient to make a
Pike-staff: I am told there is a Flemish Ash planted by the Dutchmen in
Lincolnshire, which in six years grows to be worth twenty shillings the Tree;
but I am not assured whether it be the Ash or Abeele; either of them were, upon
this account, a worthy encouragement. From these low Cuttings come our
Ground-Ashes, so much sought after for Arbours, Espaliers, and other
Pole-works: They will spring in abundance, and may be reduced to one for a
Standard-tree, or for Timber, if you design it; for thus Hydra like, a
Ground-cut-Ash, By havoc, Wounds, and Blows,
More lively and luxuriant grows.
Per damna, per caedes, ab ipso
Ducit opes auimumque ferro.
Ho^. Ash will be propagated from a Bough slipped off with some of the old-wood,
a little before the Bud swells. Such as they reserve for Spears in Spain, they
keep shrip'd up close to the stem, and plant them in close order, and moyster
places. These they cut above the knot (for the least nodosity spoils all) in
the decrease of January, which were of the latest for us: It is reported that
the Ash will not only receive its own kind, but graff, or be inoculated with
the Pear and Apple, but to what improvement I know not.

3. It is by no means convenient to plant Ash in Plow-lands; for the Roots will
be obnoxious to the Coulter; and the shade of the Tree is malignant to Corn
when the head and branches over-drip it; but in Hedge-rowes, and Plumps, they
will thrive exceedingly, where they may be disposed at nine or ten foot
distance, and sometimes nearer: But in planting of a whole Wood of several
kinds of Trees for Timber, every third set at least, would be an Ash. The best
Ash delights in the best Land (which it will soon impoverish) yet grows in any;
so it be not over-wet, and approaching to the Ma^shy, unless it be first well
drained: By the Banks of sweet and crystal Rivers and Streams, I have observed
them to thrive infinitely. One may observe as manifest a difference in the
Timber of Ashes, as of the Oak; much more than is found in any one kind of Elm,
caeteris paribus: For so the ground-Ash (like the Oak) much excells a bough, or
branch of the same bulk, for strength and toughness; and in yet farther
emulation of the Oak, it has been known to prove as good, and lasting Timber
for Building, nay, preferred before it, where there has been plenty of Oak;
vast difference there is also in the strength of Ground, and quartered Ash:
It Is likewise remarkable that the Ash, like the Cork tree, grows when the Bark
is quite peeled off, as has been observed in several Forests, where the Deer
have bared them as far as they could climb: Some Ash is curiously camleted and
vein'd, I say, so differently from other Timber; that our skilful
Cabinet-makers prize it equal with Ebony, and give it the name of green Ebony,
which the Customer pays well for; and when our Woodmen light upon it, they may
make what money they will of it: But to bring it to that curious luster, so as
it is hardly to be distinguished from the most curiously diaper'd Olive, they
Varnish their Work with the China-varnish (hereafter described) which
infinitely excells I^ynseed-oyl, that Cardan so commends, speaking of this Root.

4. The use of Ash is (next to that of the Oak it self) one of the most
universal: It serves the Soldier -- and Fraxinus utilis hastis* Ovid. The
Carpenter, Wheel-wright, Cart-wright, for Ploughs, Axel trees, Wheelrings,
Harrows, Bulls, Oars, the best blocks for Pullys and Sheffs, as Seamen name
them; Also for the Cooper, Turner, and Thatcher: Nothing like it for our Garden
Palisad-hedges, Hop-yards, Poles, and Spars, Handles, Stocks for Tools,
Spade-trees, etc. In sum, the Husbandman cannot be without the Ash for his
Carts, Ladders, and other tackling: From the Pike, to the Plow; Spear, and Bow,
for of Ash were they formerly made, and therefore reckoned amongst those woods,
which after long tension has a natural Spring, and recovers its position; so as
in Peace and War it is a Wood in highest request: There is extracted an Oil
from the Ash, by the process on other Woods, which is excellent to recover the
Hearing; some drops of it being distilled warm into the Ears, and for the
Caries or rot of the Bones, Toothache, pains in the Kidneys, and Spleen, the
anointing therewith is most sovereign. Lastly, the white, and rotten dottard
part composes a ground for our Gallants Sweet-powder, and the Truncheons make
the third sort of the most durable Coal, and is (of all other) the sweetest of
our Forest-fuelling, and the fittest for Ladies Chambers: To conclude, the very
dead leaves afford (like those of the Elm) relief to our Cattle in Winter; and
there is a dwarf sort in France (if in truth it be not, as I suspect, our
Witchen-tree) whose Berries feed the poor People, in scarce years, but it bears
no Keys, like to ours, which being pickled tender, afford a delicate Salading.
But the Shade of the Ash is not to be endured, because it produces a noxious
Insect; and for displaying themselves so very late, and falling very early, not
to be planted for Vmbrage, or Ornament; especially near the Garden, since
(besides their predatitious Roots) the deciduous leaves descending with so long
a Stalk, are drawn by clusters into the Worm holes, which foul the Allies with
their falling Keys, and suddenly infect the ground. Note, that the Season for
felling of this Tree must be when the Sap is fully at rest; for if you cut it
down too early, or over late in the year, it will be so obnoxious to the Worm,
as greatly to prejudice the timber; therefore to be sure, fell not till the
three Mid-winter Months, beginning about November. I am astonished at the
universal Confidence of all our Botanists, that a Serpent will rather creep
into the Fire, than over a twig of Ash; this is an old Imposture of Plinys, who
either took it up upon trust, or we mistake the Tree.

CHAP. VII. Of the Chestnut.
1. THe next is the Chestnut, Chess-nut.
[Castanea] of which Pliny reckons many kinds, especially about Tarentum and
Naples; but we commend those of Portugal or Bayone, choosing the largest brown
and most ponderous for fruit, such as Pliny calls Coctivae, but the lesser ones
to raise for Timber. They are produced best by sowing; previous to which, let
the Nuts be first spread to sweat, then cover them in sand, a Month being past,
plunge them in Water, reject the swimmers; being dried for thirty days more,
sand them again, and to the water-ordeal as before. Being thus treated till the
beginning of Spring, or in November, set them as you would do Beans; and as
some practice it, drenched for a night or more, in new Milk: They should be put
into the holes with the point upmost as you plant Tulips; Pliny will tell you
they come not up, unless four, or five be pil'd together in a hole; but that is
false, if they be good, as you may presume all those to be which pass this
examination; nor will any of them fail: But being come up they thrive best
unremoved, making a great stand for at least two years, upon every
transplanting; yet if needs you must alter their station, let it be done about
November, and that into a light friable ground, or moist Gravel, however, they
will grow even in Clay, Sand, and all mixed Soils, upon exposed, and bleak
places, and the pendent declivities of Hills to the North, in dry airy places,
and sometimes near Marshes and Waters; but they affect no other compost, save
what their own leaves afford them, and are more patient of cold than heat.

2. If you desire to set them in Winter, or Autumn, I counsel you to inter them
within their Husks, which being every way armed are a good protection against
the Mouse, and a providential integument. Pliny l. 15. c. 23. from this natural
Guard, concludes them to be excellent food, and doubtless Caesar thought so,
when he transported them from Sardis first into Italy, whence they were
propagated into France, and thence among us; another encouragement to make such
Experiments out of forain Countries. Some sow them confusedly in the Furrow
like the Acorn, and govern them as the Oak; but then would the ground be broken
up 'twixt November and February; and when they spring, be cleansed at two foot
asunder, after two years growth: Likewise may Copses of Chestnuts be wonderfully
increased, and thickened, by laying the tender and young branches; but such as
spring from the Nuts and Marrons are best of all, and will thrive exceedingly,
if being let stand without removing, the ground be stirred and loosned about
their Roots, for two or three of the first years, and the superfluous wood
pruned away; and indeed for good Trees, they should be shrip'd up after the
first years removal: Thus will you have a Copse ready for a felling, within
eight years, which (besides many other uses) will yield you incomparable Poles
for any work of the Garden, Vineyard, or Hopyard, till the next cutting: And if
the Tree like the ground, will in ten or twelve years grow to a kind of Timber,
and bear plentiful fruit.

3. I have seen many Chess-nut-trees transplanted as big as my arm, their heads
cut off at five and six foot height; but they came on at leisure: In such
Plantations, and all others for Avenues, you may set them from thirty, to ten
foot distance, though they will grow much nearer, and shoot into Poles, if
(being tender) you cultivate them like the Ash, the nature of whose shade it
resembles, since nothing affects much to grow under it: Some Husbands tell me,
that the young Chess-nut-trees should not be pruned or touched with any knife
or edgetool, for the first three or four years, but rather crop'd or broken
off, which I leave to farther Experience.

4. The Chessnut being graffed in the Wall-nut, Oak, or Beech (I have been
told) will come exceeding fair, and produce incomparabl^ Fruit; for the
Wall-nut, and Chessnut in each other, it is probable; but I have not as yet
made a full attempt; they also speak of Inoculating Cherrys in the
Chessnut-stock for a later fruit. In the mean time, I wish we did more
universally propagate the Horse-Chessnut, which being easily increased from
layers, grows into a goodly Standard, and bears a most glorious flower, even in
our cold Country: This Tree is now all the mode for the Avenues to their
Country Palaces in France, as appears by the late superintendents Plantation
at Vaux. It was first brought from Constantinople to Vienna, thence into Italy,
and so France; but to Us from the Levant more immediately, and flourishes so
well, and grows so goodly a Tree in compent time, that by this alone, we might
have ample encouragement to Denizen other strangers amongst us.

5. The Chess-nut is (next the Oak) one of the most sought after by the
Carpenter and Joyner: It has formerly built a good part of our ancient Houses
in the City of London, as does yet appear. I had once a very large Barn near
the City framed entirely of this Timber: And certainly they grew not far off;
probably in some Woods near the Town: For in that description of London written
by Fitz-Stephens, in the Reign of Hen. 2. he speaks of a very noble and large
Forest which grew on the Boreal part of it: Proxime (says he) patet foresta
ingens, saltus nemorosi ferarum, latebrae cervorum, damarum, aprorum, and
taurorum Sylvestrium, etc. A very goodly thing it seems, and as well stored
with all sorts of good Timber, as with Venison and all kind of Chase. The
Chess-nut affords the best Stakes and Poles for Palisades, Pedaments for
Vine-props, and Hops, as I said before: Also for Mill-timber and Waterworks,
or when it may lie buried; but if water touch the Roots of the growing Trees,
it spoils both Fruit and Timber: It Is likewise observed, that this Tree is so
prevalent against cold, that where they stand, they defend other Plantations
from the injuries of the severest frosts: I am sure being planted in
Hedge-rowes, and circa agrorum itinera, or for Avenues to our Countrey-houses,
they are a magnificent, and royal Ornament: This Timber also does well for
Columns, Tables, Chests, Chairs, Stools, Bedsteads; for Tubs, and VVine-Cask,
which it preserves with the least tincture of the wood of any whatsoever: If
the Timber be dipped in scalding Oil, and well Pitched, it becomes extremely
durable: Beams made of Chessnut tree have this property, that being somewhat
brittle, they give warning, and premonish the danger by a certain crackling
which it makes: Formerly they made Consultatory Staves of this Tree; and the
Variegated Rods which Jacob peeled to lay in the Troughs, and impresse a fancy
in his Father-in-law's conceiving Ewes, were of this material. The Coals are
excellent for the Smith, being soon kindled, and as soon extinguished; but the
Ashes of Chessnut-wood are not convenient for to make a Lee with, because it is
observed to stain the Linen. As for the Fruit, it is better to beat it down
from the Tree, some little time before they fall off themselves; thus, they
will the better keep, or else you must smoke-dry them. But we give that fruit
to our Swine in England, which is amongst the delicacies of Princes in other
Countries; and being of the larger Nut, is a lusty, and masculine food for
Rustics at all times; and of better nourishment for Husbandmen than Cole and
rusty Bacon, yea, or Beans to boot, instead of which, they boil them in Italy
with their Bacon; and in Virgil's time, they ate them with Milk and Cheese. The
best Tables in France and Italy make them a Service, eating them with Salt, in
Wine, or juice of Lemon and Sugar; being first roasted in Embers on the
Chaplet; and doubtless we might propagate their use, amongst our common
people, (as of old the (...)) being a food so cheap, and so lasting. In Italy
they also boil them in Wine, and then smoke them a little, these they call
Anseri or Geese, I know not why: Those of Piemont add Fennel, Cinnamon and
Nutmeg to their Wine, but first they peele them. Others macerate them in
Rose Water; the Bread of the flower is exceeding nutritive; it is a robust food
and makes Women well complexion'd, as I have read in a good Author: They also
make Fritters of Chessnut flower, which they wet with Rosewater, and sprinkle
with grated Parmegiano, and so fry them in fresh Butter, a delicate: How we
here use them in stew'd-meats, and Beatille-Pyes, our French Cooks teach us;
and this is in truth the very best use of their Fruit, and very commendable;
for it is found that the eating of them raw or in Bread (as they do much about
Limosin) is apt to swell the belly, though without any other inconvenience that
I can learn, and yet some condemn them as dangerous for such as are subject to
the Gravel in the Kidneys. The best way to preserve them, is to keep them in
Earthen vessels in a cold place; some lay them in a Smoke-loft, others, in dry
Barly-straw, others, in Sand, etc. The leaves of the Chess-nut tree makes very
wholesome Mattrasses to lie on, and they are good Litter for Cattle: But those
leafie-beds, for the crackling noise they make when one turns upon them, the
French call Licts de Parliament: Lastly, the flower of Chessnuts made into an
Electuary with Honey, is an approved Remedy against spitting blood, and the
Cough; and a decoction of the Rind of the Tree, tinctures hair of a golden
Color.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Wall-nut.
Wall-nut.
1. JVglans, quasi Jovis glans, the Wall-nut, is of several sorts; the soft
shell, and the hard, the whiter, and the blacker grain: This black bears the
worst Nut, but the Timber much to be preferred, and we might propagate more of
them if we were careful to procure them out of Virginia, where they abound, or
from Grenoble, which our Cabinet-makers so prize. It is said that the Wallnut
kernel wrapped in its own leaf, being carefully taken out of its shell, brings a
Nut without shell; but this is a trifle; the best way to elevate them is, to
set them as you do the Chessnut, being planted of the Nut, or set at the
distance you would have him stand; for which they may be prepared by beating
them off the Tree (as was prescribed of the Chessnut) some days before they
quit the Branches of themselves, and kept in their husks, or without them, till
Spring, or by bedding them (being dry) in sand, or good Earth, till March, from
the time they fell, or were beaten off the Tree: Or if before, they be set with
husk and all upon them; for the extreme bitterness thereof is most exitial,
and deadly to Worms; or it were good to strew some Furzes (broken or chopp'd
small) under the ground amongst them, to preserve them from Mice and Rats, when
their shells begin to wax tender; especially if as some, you supple them a
little in warm Cows milk; but being treated as before, you will find them
already sprouted, and have need only to be planted where they are to abide;
because (as we said long since) they are most impatient of transplanting: But
if there be an absolute necessity of removing, let your Tree be about four
years old, and then by no means touch the head with your Knife, nor cut away so
much as the very Tap-root, if you can well dispose of it, since being of a
pithy and hollow substance, the least diminution, or bruise, will greatly
endanger the killing: But see here what we have said of the Chess-nut; I have
been told, that the very Tops, and palish Buds of this Tree, when it first
sprouts, though as late as April, will take hold of the ground, and grow to an
incredible improvement; but first they steep them in Milk and Saffron; but this
attempt did not succeed with us, yet it will be propagated by a Branch slipped
off with some of the old wood, and set in February: An industrious and very
experienced Husbandman told me, that if they be transplanted as big as ones
Middle, it may be done safer than when younger; I do only report it: What they
hint of putting a Tile-shard under the Nuts when first set, to divaricate and
spread the Roots (which are otherwise apt to penetrate very deep) I like well
enough; it is said they will receive their own Cyons being Graffed, but that it
does not at all improve their Fruit: The best compost is the strewing of Ashes
at the foot of the Trees, the Salt whereof being washed into the Earth, is the
best dressing, whilst the juice of the fallen leaves, though it kill the Worm,
is noxious to the Root.

2. The Wallnut delights in a dry, sound, and rich land; especially if it
incline to a feeding Chalk, or Marle; and where it may be protected from the
cold (though it affect cold rather then extreme heat) as in great Pits,
Valleys, and Highway sides; also in Stonie-grounds, and on Hills, especially
Chalkie: likewise in Cornfields: Thus Burgundy abounds with them, where they
stand in the midst of goodly Wheat-lands, at sixty, and an hundred foot
distance; and it is so far from hurting the crop, that they look on them as a
great Preserver, by keeping the grounds warm; nor do the roots hinder the Plow.
When ever they fell a Tree (which is only the the old, and decayed) they
always plant a young one near him; and in several places 'twixt Hanaw, and
Francfort in Germany, no young Farmer whatsoever is permitted to Marry a Wife,
till he bring proof that he has planted, and is a Father of such a stated
number of Walnut-trees, as the Law is inviolably observed to this day, for the
extraordinary benefit which this Tree affords the Inhabitants: And in truth,
were this Timber in greater plenty amongst us, we should have far better
Vtensils of all sorts for our Houses, as Chairs, Stools, Bedsteads, Tables,
Wainscot, Cabinets, etc. in stead of the more vulgar Beech, subject to the
worm, weak, and unsightly; but which to counterfeit and deceive the unwary,
they wash over with a decoction made of the Green husks of Walnuts, etc. I say,
had we store of this material, we should find an incredible improvement in the
more stable Furniture of our Houses, as in the first frugal, and better days
of Rome, when Tables made here at home, those times beheld,
Of our own Wood, for that same purpose felled,
Old Walnut blown down, when the Wind set East.

Juv. l. 4. Sat. 11. for if it had been cut in that season, it would not have
proved so sound, as we show in our Chapter of Felling. It is certain, that the
Mensae nucinae, were once in price even before the Citrin, as Strabo notes; and
nothing can be more beautiful, than some Planks, and Works which I have beheld
of it, especially that which comes from Grenoble, of all other the most
beautiful and esteemed.

3. They render most graceful Avenues to our Country dwellings, and do
excellently near Hedge-rows; but had need be planted at forty, or fifty foot
interval, for they affect to spread both their Roots and Branches. The
Bergstras (which extends from Heidelberg to Darmstadt) is all planted with
Walnuts; for so by another ancient Law, the Bordurers were obliged to nurse up,
and take care of them; and that chiefly, for their ornament and shade; so as a
man may ride for many miles about that Country, under a continued Arbor, or
Close-walk; The Traveller both refreshed with the Fruit, and the shade, which
some have causlesly defamed for its ill effects on the head, for which the
Fruit is a specifique and a notable signature; although I deny not, but the
sent of the fallen leaves, when they begin to be damped with lying, may emit
somewhat a heady steam, which to some has proved noxious; but not whilst they
were fresh, and lively upon the Trees. How would such public Plantations
improve the Glory and Wealth of a Nation! but where shall we find the spirits
among our Countrymen? Yes, I will adventure to instance in those Plantations of
Sir Richard Stidolph, upon the Downs near Lether-head in Surry; and so about
Cassaulton, where many thousands of these Trees do celebrate the industry of
the Owners; and will certainly reward it with infinite improvement, as I am
assured they do in part already, and that very considerably; besides the
Ornament which they afford to those pleasant tracts, for some Miles in
circumference. I remember Monsieur Sorbiere, in a Skeptical discourse to
Monsieur de Martel, speaking of the readiness of the People in Holland to
furnish and maintain whatsoever may conduce to the public Ornament, as well as
convenience; tells us, that their Plantations of these, and the like Trees,
even in their very Roads, and common Highwayes, are better preserved, and
entertained (as I my self have likewise been often an eyewitness) then those
about the Houses, and Gardens of pleasure belonging to the Nobles and Gentry of
most other Countries: And in effect it is a most ravishing object, to behold
their amenities in this particular: With us says he (speaking of France) they
make a jest at such political Ordinances, by ruining these public and useful
Ornaments, if happily some more prudent Magistrate, do at any time introduce
them. Thus in the Reign of Henry the fourth, during the Superintendency of
Monsieur de Sulli, there was resolution of adorning all the Highways of
France with Elms, etc. but the rude and mischievous Paysans, did so hack,
steal, and destroy what they had begun, that they were forced to desist from
the thorough prosecution of the design; so as there is nothing more exposed,
wild, and less pleasant then the Common Roads of France for want of shade, and
the decent limits which these sweet, and divertissant Plantations would have
afforded; not to omit that Political use, as my Lord Bacon hints it, where he
speaks of the Statues and Monuments of brave men, and such as had well deserved
of the Public, erected by the Romans even in their Highways, since
doubtless, such noble, and agreeable objects, would exceedingly divert,
entertain, and take off the Minds and Discourses of Melancholy people, and
pensive Travelers, who having nothing but the dull and enclosed Ways to cast
their eyes on, are but ill Conversation to themselves, and others, and instead
of Celebrating, Censure their Superiors. It is by a curious Person, and
industrious Friend of mine, observed, that the Sap of this Tree rises, and
descends with the Suns diurnal course (which it visibly slackens in the Night)
and more plentifully at the Root on the South Side, though those on the North
were larger, and less distant from the Body of the Tree; and not only
distilled from the ends, which were next the Stem, but from those which were
cut off and separated; which was never observed to happen in the Birch, or
other Sap-yielding Trees.

4. What universal use the French make of the Timber of this sole Tree, for
domestic affairs, may be seen in every Room both of Poor and Rich: It is of
singular account with the Joyner, for the best grained and colored Wainscot,
with the Gunsmith for Stocks, for Coach wheels excellent, and the Bodies of
Coaches, the Drum-maker for Rimbs, the Cabinet-maker for Inlayings, especially
the firm and close Timber about the Roots, which is admirable for fleck'd and
chambletted works, some wood especially, as that which we have from Bologne
very black of Color, and so admirably streaked, as to represent natural
flowers, Landskips, and other Fancys: To render this the better colored,
Joyners put the boards into an Oven after the batch is forth, or lay them in a
warm Stable, and when they work it, polish it over with its own Oil very hot,
which makes it look black and sleek, and the older it is the more esteemable;
but then it should not be put in work till thoroughly seasoned, because it will
shrink beyond expectation. It is only not good to confide in it much for beams,
or Joysts, because of its brittleness, of which yet, it has been observed to
give timely notice, by the crackling before it breaks. Besides the uses of the
Wood, the fruit with husk and all when tender and very young, is for preserves,
for food, and Oil, of extraordinary use with the Painter, in whites, and other
delicate Colors, also for Gold-size, and Vernish; and with this they polish
Walking-staves, and other works which are wrought in with burning: For Food
they Fry with it in some places, and use it to burn in Lamps; the younger
Timber is held to make the better colored work (and so the Oak) but the older
more firm and close, is finer Chambleted for Ornament; and the very husks and
leaves being macerated in warm Water, and that Liquor poured on the Carpet of
Walks, and Bowling-greens, does infallibly kill the Worms without endangering
the grass; not to mention the Dye which is made of this Lixive, to Color
Wool, Woods, and Hair, as of old they used it. The water of the Husks is
sovereign against all pestilential infections, and that of the leaves to
mundifie, and heal inveterate Ulcers. That which is produced of the
thick-shell, becomes best Timber, that of the thinner better Fruit, Columella
has sundry excellent Rules how to ascertain, and accelerate the growth of this
Tree, and to improve its qualities, and I am assured, that having been Graffed
on the Ash (though others say no Insition improves it) they thrive exceedingly,
become handsome Trees, and what is most estimable, bears its fruit within four
years; all which I recommend to the farther Industrious. The green husk dried,
or the first peeping red Buds and leaves reduced to powder, serves in stead of
Pepper, to condite meats and sauces. It Is better to cudgel off the Fruit, than
to gather it by hand; and in Italy they arm the tops of long Poles with nails
and iron for the purpose, and believe the beating improves the Tree: Those Nuts
which come not easily out of their husks, should be laid to mellow in heaps,
and the rest exposed in the Sun, till the Shells dry, else they will be apt to
perish the Kernel: Some again preserve them in their own leaves, or in a Chest
made of Walnut-tree wood; others in Sand: Old Nuts are not wholesome till
macerated in warm and almost boiling water; but if you lay them in a Leaden
pot, and bury them in the Earth, so as no Vermin can attaque them, they will
keep mervellously plump the whole year about, and may easily be blanched: In
Spain they use to strew the gratings of old and hard Nuts (first peeld) into
their Tarts and other Meats. For the Oil, one Bushel of Nuts will yield fifteen
pounds of peeld and clear Kernels, and that half as much Oil, which the sooner
it is drawn, is the more in quantity, though the dryer the Nut the better in
quality; the Lees, or Marc of the Pressing, is excellent to fatten Hogs with.
After the Nuts are beaten down, the leaves would be swep'd into heaps, and
carried away, because their extreme Bitterness impairs the ground, and as I am
assured, prejudices the Trees: The Green husks boiled, make a good Color to
dye a dark Yellow, without any mixture; and the distillation of its leaves with
Honey and Urine, makes Hair spring in bald-heads: Besides its use in the Famous
Salernitan Antidote; if the Kernel a little masticated, be applied to the
biting of a suspected Mad-dog, and when it has lain three hours, be cast to
Poultrey, they will dye if they eat of it. In Italy, when a Country man finds
any pain in his Side, he drinks a Pint of the fresh Oil of this Nut, and finds
immediate ease: The Kernel being rubbed upon any crack or chink of a Leaking or
crasy Vessel, stops it better than either Clay, Pitch, or Wax: In France they
eat them blanched and fresh with Wine and Salt, having first cut them out of
the shells before they are hardened, with a short broad brasse-knife, because
Iron rusts, and these they call Cernois, from their manner of scooping them out.

CHAP. IX. Of the Mulberry.
1. MOrus, the Mulberry: Mulberry.
It may possibly be wondered by some, why we should insert this Tree amongst
our Forest Inhabitants; but we shall soon reconcile our industrious Planter,
when he comes to understand the incomparable benefit of it, and that for its
Timber, durablenesse, and use for the Joyner and Carpenter, and to make Hoops,
Bows, Wheels, and even Ribs for small Vessels in stead of Oak, etc. though the
Fruit and the leaves had not the due value with us, which they diservedly enjoy
in other places of the World.

2. But it is not here I would recommend our ordinary black fruit bearers,
though that be likewise worth the propagation; but that kind which is called
the White Mulberry, one of them of a broad leaf, found in Province, whose Seeds
being procured from Paris, where they have it from Avignion, should be thus
treated in the Seminary.

3. In Countries where they cultivate them for the Silkworm, and other uses,
they sow the perfectly mature berrys of a Tree whose Leaves have not been
gathered; these they shake down upon an old Sheet, spread under the Tree, to
protect them from Gravel and Ordure, which will hinder you from discerning the
Seed: If they be not ripe, lay them to mature upon Shelves, but by no means
till they corrupt; to prevent which, turn them daily; then put them in a fine
Siev, and plunging it in Water, bruise them with your hand; do this in several
Waters, then change them in other clear Water, and the Seed will sink to the
bottom, whilst the pulp swims, and must be taken off carefully: This done, lay
them to dry in the Sun upon a linen Cloth, for which, one hour is sufficient,
then Van and sieft it from the husks, and reserve it till the season. This is
the process of curious persons, but the sowing of ripe Mulberries themselves
is altogether as good, and from the excrement of Hogs, and even Dogs (that will
frequently eat them) they will rise abundantly: Note, that in sowing the Berry
it is good to squash and bruise them with fine siefted Mould, and if it be rich,
and of the old bed, so much the better: They would be interred, well moystned
and covered with straw, and then rarely watered till they peep; Or you may
squeeze the ripe Berrys in Ropes of Hair or Bast, and bury them as is
prescribed for Hipps and Haws; the Earth in which you sow them, should be fine
Mould, and as rich as for Melons, raised a little higher then the Area, as they
make the Beds for ordinary Pot Herbs, to keep them loose and warm, and in such
beds you may sow Seeds as you do Purslane, mingled with some fine Earth, and
thinly covered, and then for a fortnight strewn over with straw, to protect
them both from sudden heat, and from birds: The Season is April or May, though
some forbear even till July and August, and in the second quarter of the Moon,
the Weather calm and serene; at the beginning, keep them moderately fresh (not
over wet) and clean weeded, secured from the rigor of Frosts; the second year
of their growth about the beginning of October, or early Spring, draw them
gently out, prune the Roots, and dipping them a little in Pond-water,
transplant them in a warm place or Nursery; it is best ranging them in Drills,
two foot large, and one in depth, each rill three foot distance, and each Plant
two. And if thus the new Earth be somewhat lower then the Surface of the rest,
'twill the better receive the Rain: Being Planted, cut them all within three
Inches of the ground. Water them not in Winter, but in extreme necessity, and
when the weather is warm, and then do it in the Morning. In this cold Season
you shall do well to cover the ground with the Leaves of Trees, Straw, or short
Littier, to keep them warm; and every year you shall give them three Dressings
or half diggings; viz. in April, June, and in August; this, for the first year,
still after Rain: The second Spring after Transplanting, purge them of all
superfluous shoots and Scions, reserving only the most towardly for the future
Stem; this to be done yearly, as long as they continue in the Nursery; and if
of the principal Stem so left, the frost mortify any part, cut it off, and
continue this government till they are near six foot high, after which suffer
them to spread into head by discreetly pruning, and fashioning them: But if you
plant where Cattle may endanger them, the stem had need be taller, for they are
extremely liquorish of the leaves.

4. When now they are about five years growth, you may transplant them without
cutting the Root (provided you irradicate them with care) only trimming the
head a little; the Season is from September to November in the New Moon, and if
the holes or pits you set them in were dug and prepared some months before, it
would much secure their taking; some cast horns, bones, Shells, etc. into them
the better to loosen the earth about them, which should be rich, and well
refreshed all Summer. A light, and dry Mould is best, well exposed to the Sun
and Air, which above all things this Tree affects, and hates watery low
grounds: In sum, they thrive best where Vines prosper most, whose society they
exceedingly cherish; nor do they less delight to be amongst Corn, no way
prejudicing it with its shade. The Distance for these Standards would be
twenty, or twenty four foot every way, if you would design Walks or Groves of
them; if the environs of Fields, Banks of Rivers, Highways, etc. twelve or
fourteen foot may suffice, but the farther distant, the better.

5. Another Expedient to increase Mulberries is, by Layers from the Suckers at
the foot, this done in Spring, leaving not above two Buds out of the Earth,
which you must diligently water, and the second year they will be rooted: They
will also take by passing any branch or Arm slit, and kept a little open with a
wedge, or stone, through a basket of Earth, which is a very sure way: Nay, the
very Cuttings will strike in Spring, but let them be from Shoots of two years
growth, with some of the old Wood, though of seven or eight years; these set in
Rills like Vines, having two or three Buds at the top, will root infallibly,
especially if you twist the old Wood a little, or at least hack it, though some
slit the foot, inserting a stone, or grain of an Oate, to suckle and entertain
the Plant with moisture.

6. They may also be propagated by Graffing them on the black Mulberry in
Spring, or inoculated in July, taking the cyons from some old tree, that has
broad, even, and round leaves, which causes it to produce very ample and tender
leaves, of great emolument to the Silk-master.

7. Some experienced Husbandmen advise to poll our Mulberries every three or
four years, as we do our Willows: others not till 8 years: both erroneously.
The best way is yearly to prune them of their dry and superfluous branches, and
to form their heads round and natural. The first year of removal where they are
to abide, cut off all the shoots to five or six of the most promising: the next
year leave not above three of these, which dispose in triangle as near as may
be, and then disturb them no more, unless it be to purge them (as we taught) of
dead Scare-wood, and extravagant parts, which may impeach the rest; and if
afterward any pruned branch shoot above three or four Cyons, reduce them to
that number. One of the best ways of Pruning is, what they practice in Sicily
and Province, to make the head hollow and like a bell, by cleansing them of
their inmost branches; and this may be done, either before they bud, viz. in
the New Moon of March, or when they are full of leaves in June or July, if the
season prove any thing fresh. Here I must not omit what I read of the Chinese
culture, and which they now also imitate in Virginia, where they have found a
way to raise these Plants of the Seeds, which they mow and cut like a crop of
grass which sprout and bear leaves again in a few months.

8. The Mulberry is much improved by stirring the Mould at root, and Lestulion.

9. We have already mentioned some of the Uses of this excellent tree,
especially of the white, so called because the fruit is of a paler color,
which is also of a more luscious taste, and lesser than the black; The rind
likewise is whiter, and the leaves of a mealy clear green color, and far
tenderer, and sooner produced by at least a fortnight, which is a mavelous
advantage to the newly disclosed Silkworm; Also they arrive sooner to their
maturity, and the food produces a finer web. Nor is this tree less beautiful to
the eye then the fairest Elm, very proper for Walks and Avenues: The timber
(amongst other properties) will last in the water as well as the most solid
Oak, and the bark makes good and tough Bast-ropes. It suffers no kind of Vermin
to breed on it, whether standing or felled, nor dares any Caterpillar attaque
it save the Silkworm only. The Loppings are excellent fuel: but that for which
this tree is in greatest and most worthy esteem, is for the Leaves, which
(besides the Silkworm) nourishes Cows, Sheep, and other cattle; especially
young Porkers, being boiled with a little bran: and the fruit excellent to feed
Poultry. In sum, what ever eats of them, will with difficulty be reduced to
endure any thing else, as long as they can come by them; to say nothing of
their other sovereign qualities, as relaxing of the belly being eaten in the
morning, and curing Inflammations and Ulcers of the mouth and throat, mixed
with Mel Rosarum, in which Receipt they do best, being taken before they are
over-ripe.

10. To proceed with the Leaf (for which they are chiefly cherished) the
benefit of it is so great, that they are frequently let to farm for vast
sums; so as some one sole tree has yielded the proprietor a rent of twenty
Shillings per Annum, for the Leaves only; and six or seven pounds of Silk,
worth as many pounds Sterling, in five or six weeks, to those who keep the
worms. We know that till after Italy had made Silk above a thousand years, they
received it not in France; it being hardly yet an hundred since they betook
themselves to this manufacture in Province, ^anguedoc, Dauphine, Lionnois, etc.
and not in Tourain and Orleans till Hen. the fourth's time; but it is
incredible what a Revenue it amounts to in that Kingdom. About the same time,
or a little after, it was that King James did with extraordinary care recommend
it to this Nation, by a Book of Directions, Acts of Council, and all other
Princely assistance. But this did not take no more then that of Hen. the
fourth's Proposal about the Invirons of Paris, who filled the Highways, Parks,
and Gardens of France with the trees, beginning in his own Gardens for
encouragement: Yet, I say, this would not be brought into example, till this
present great Monarch, by the indefatigable diligence of Monsieur Colbert (
Superintendent of His Majesty's manufactures) who has so successfully revived
it, that it is prodigious to consider what an happy progress they have made in
it, to our shame be it spoken; who have no other discouragements from any
insuperable difficulty whatever, but our sloth and want of industry: since
where ever these trees will grow and prosper, the Silkworms will do so also;
and they were alike averse, and from the very same suggestions where now that
manufacture flourishes in our neighbor Countries. It is demonstrable, that
Mulberries in four or five years may be made to spread all over this Land, and
when the indigent and young daughters in proud Families are as willing to gain
three or four Shillings a day for gathering Silk, and busying themselves in
this sweet and easy employment, as some do to get four pence a day for hard
work at Hemp, Flax, and Wool; the reputation of Mulberries would spread in
England and other Plantations. I might say something like this of Saffron,
which we yet too much neglect the culture of; but, which for all this I do not
despair of seeing reassumed when that good Genius returns. In order to this
hopeful Prognostic we will add a few Directions about the gathering of their
Leaves, to render this chapter one of the most accomplished; for certainly one
of the most accomplished and agreeable works in the world.

11. The Leaves of the Mulberry should be collected from trees of seven or
eight years old; if of such as are very young, it impairs their growth, neither
are they so healthful for the worms, making them hydropical and apt to burst:
As do also the Leaves of such trees as be planted in a too waterish or
over-rich soil, or where no Sun comes; and all sick and yellow leaves are
hurtful. It is better to clip, and let the leaves fall upon a subtended sheet
or blanket, than to gather them by hand; and to gather them, than to strip
them, which marrs and gauls the branches, and bruises the leaves that should
hardly be touched. Some there are who lop off the boughs, and make it their
pruning, and it is a tolerable way, so it be discreetly done in the over-thick
parts of the tree; but these leaves gathered from a separated branch will die,
and wither much sooner than those which are taken from the tree immediately,
unless you set the stem in water. Leaves gathered from boughs cut off will
shrink in three hours; whereas those you take from the living tree will last as
many days; and being thus a while kept are better than over-fresh ones. It is a
Rule, Never to gather in a rainy season, nor cut any branch whilst the wet is
upon it; and therefore against such suspected times you are to provide before
hand, and to reserve them in some fresh but dry place: the same caution you
must observe for the dew, though it do not rain, for wet-food kills the worms.
But if this cannot be altogether prevented, put the leaves between a pair of
sheets well dried by the fire, and shake them up and down 'till the moisture be
drunk up in the Linen, and then spreading them to the air a little, on another
dry cloth, you may feed with them boldly. The top-leaves and oldest would be
gathered last of all, as being most proper to repast the worms with toward
their last change. The gatherer must be neat, and have his hands clean, and his
breath sweet, and not poisoned with Onions or Tobacco, and be careful not to
press the leaves by crouding them into the Bags or Baskets. Lastly, that they
gather only (unless in case of necessity) leaves from the present, not from
the former years sprigs, or old wood, which are not only rude and harsh, but
are annexed to stubb'd Stalks, which injure the worms, and spoil the denudated
branches.

12. This is what I thought fit to premonish concerning the gathering of the
Leaves of this tree for Silkworms, as I newly find it in Monsieur Isnard's
Instructions, in that exact Discourse of his published some three years since,
and dedicated to Monsieur Colbert, who has, it seems, constituted this
industrious and experienced person, Surveyor of this Princely manufacture about
Paris; and because the book it self is rare, and known of by very few. I have
no more to add, but this for our encouragement, and to encounter the
Objections which may be suggested about the coldness and moisture of our
Country; That the Spring is in Province no less inconstant than is ours in
England; that the colds at Paris are altogether as sharp; and that when in May
it has continued raining for nine and twenty days successively, Monsieur Isnard
assures us, he proceeded in his work without the least disaster; and in the
year 1664 he presented the French King his Master with a considerable quantity
of better Silks, than any Messina or Boulonia could produce, which he sold raw
at Lions, for a Pistol the pound; when that of Avignion, Province, and Dauphine
produced little above half that price. But you are to expect the complete
History of the Silkworm from that incomparable Treatise, which the learned
Malpighius has lately sent out of Italy, and dedicated to the Royal Society
(now ready to be published) as a specimen, and noble effect of its universal
correspondence and concernments for the improvement of useful knowledge.

CHAP. X. Of the Service.
Service.
1. SOrbus, the Service tree (of which there are four sorts) is raised of the
Chequers or Berries, which being ripe (that is) rotten, about September, may be
sown like Beech-Mast: It is reported that the Sower never sees the fruit of his
labor; either for that it bears only being very old, or that Men are commonly
so, before they think of planting Trees: But this is an egregious mistake; for
these come very soon to be Trees, and being planted young, thrive exceedingly;
I have likewise planted them as big as my arm successfully: The best way is
therefore to propagate them of Suckers or Sets; they delight in reasonable good
ground, rather inclining to cold, then over hot; for in places which are too
dry, they never bear kindly. The Torminalis is the kind most frequent with us;
for those of the narrower and less indented Leaf, is not so common in England
as in France, bearing a sort of Berry of the Pear shape, and is there called
the Cormier; this Tree may be Graffed either with it self, or on the
White-thorn, and Quince.

2. The Timber is useful for the Joyner, for the Engraver of Woodcuts, Bows,
Pulleys, Skrews, Mill-Spindles and other, Goads to drive Oxen with, etc.
Pistol, and Gun-stocks, and for most that the Wild-Pear-tree serves; and being
of a very delicate Grain, for the Turner, and diverse curiosities, and looks
delicately, and is almost everlasting, being rubbed over with Oil of Linseed,
well boiled, and may be made to counterfeit Ebony, or almost any Indian Wood,
colored according to Art: Also it is taken to Build with, yielding Beams of
considerable substance: The shade is beautiful for Walks, and the Fruit not
unpleasant, especially the second kind, of which with new Wine and Honey, they
make a Condilum of admirable effect to corroborate the Stomach; and the Fruit
alone is good in Dysenteria and Lasks. The water distilled from the Stalks of
the Flowers and Leaves on M.B. and twice Rectified upon fresh matter, is
incomparable for Consumptive and Tabed Bodies, taking an Ounce daily at several
times: Likewise it cures the Green-sicknesse in Virgins, and is prevalent in
all Fluxes; distilled warm into the Ears it abates the pain: The Wood, or Bark
contus'd and applied to any green Wound, heals it; and the Powder thereof drank
in Oil Olive, consolidates inward Ruptures: Lastly, the Salt of the Wood taken
in decoction of Althaea to three Grains, is an incomparable Remedy to break and
expel Gravel. The Service gives the Husbandman an early presage of the
approaching Spring, by extending his adorned Buds for a peculiar entertainment,
and dares peep out in the severest Winters.

CHAP. XI. Of the Maple.
1. Maple.
THe Maple [Acer minus] (of which Authors (see Salmasius upon Solinus. c. 33.)
reckon very many kinds) was of old held in equal estimation almost with the
Citron; especially the Bruseum, the French-Maple, and the Peacocks-tail Maple,
which is that sort so elegantly undulated, and crisped into variety of curles.
It were a most laudable attempt, if some would enquire out, and try the
planting of such sorts as are not Indigenes amongst us; such as is especially
the German Air, and that of Virginia, not yet cultivated here, but an
excellent Tree: And if this were extended to other Timber and exotic Trees,
likewise it would prove of extraordinary benefit and Ornament to the Public,
and were worthy even of the Royal Care. They are all produced of the Keys, like
the Ash; and like to it, affect a sound, and a dry, mould; growing both in
Woods and Hedge-rows, especially in the latter; which if rather hilly then low,
affords the fairest Timber. By shreding up the boughs to a head, I have caused
it to shoot to a wonderful height in a little time; but if you would lop it for
the fire, let it be done in January. The timber is far superior to Beech for
all uses of the Turner, who seeks it for Dishes, Cups, Trays, Trenchers, etc.
as the Joyner for Tables, Inlayings, and for the delicateness of the grain,
when the knurs and nodosities are rarely diapred, which does much advance its
price. Also for the lightness (under the name Air) employed often by those who
make Musical Instruments. But there is a larger sort, which we call the Sycomor.

2. But the description of this lesser Maple, and the ancient value of it, is
worth the citing. Acer operum elegantia and subtilitate Cedro secundum; plura
ejus genera: Album, quod praecipui candoris vocatur Gallicum: In Transpadana
Italia, transque Alps nascens. Alterum genus crispo macularum discursu, qui
cum excellentior fuit, a similitudine caudae pavonum nomen accepit. The Maple
(says Pliny) for the elegancy and fineness of the wood is next to the very
Cedar it self: There are several kinds of it, especially the White, which is
wonderfully beautiful; this is called the French Maple, and grows on that part
of Italy, that is on the other side of Po beyond the Alps: The other has a
curled grain, so curiously maculated, that from a near resemblance, it was
usually called the Peacocks-tayl, etc. He goes on to commend that of Istria, and
that growing on the Mountains for the best: But in the next chapter;
Pulcherrimum vero est Bruscum, multoque excellentius, etiamnum Mollusculum
tuber utrumque arboris ejus Bruscum intortius crispum, Mollusculum simplicius
sparsum; Et si magnitudinem mensarum caperet, haud dubie praeferretur Cedro,
nunc intra pugillares, lectorumque silicios aut laminas, etc. e Brusco fiunt
mensae nigrescentes, etc. Plin. l. 16. c. 15, 16. The Bruscum, or Knur is
wonderfully fair, but the Molluscum is counted most precious; both of them
Knobs and swellings out of the Tree. The Bruscum is more intricately crisp'd;
the Molluscum not so much; and had we Trees large enough to saw into Planks for
Tables, 'twould be preferred before Cedar (or Citron, for so some Copies read
it) but now they use it only for small Table-books, and with its thin boards
to Wainscot Bed-Testers with, etc. The Bruscum is of a blackish kind, with
which they make Tables. Thus far Pliny. And such spotted Tables were the famous
Tigrin, and Pantherine Curiosities of, not so called from being supported with
figures carved like those Beasts, as some conceive, and was in use even in our
Grandfathers days, but from its natural Spots and maculations; such a Table
was that of Cicero's, which cost him 10000. Sesterces; that of King Juba, sold
for 15000. and another which I read of, valued at 140000 H.S. which at about 3
d. sterling, arives to a pretty Sum; and yet that of the Mauritanian Ptolomie,
was far richer, containing four Foot and an half diameter, three Inches thick,
which is reported to have been sold for its weight in Gold: Of that value they
were, and so madly luxurious the age, that when they at any time reproached
their Wives for their wanton Expensivenesse in Pearl and other rich trifles,
they were wont to retort, and turn the Tables upon their Husbands. The Knot of
the Timber was the most esteemed, and is said to be much resembled by the
Female Cypress; we have now, I am almost persuaded, as beautiful Planks of some
Wallnut-trees, near the Root; and of Eugh, Ivy, Rose-wood, and Olive, I have
seen incomparable pieces; but the great Art was in the Seasoning, and Politure,
for which last, the rubbing with a Man's hand who came warm out of the Bath, was
accounted better then any Cloth, as Pliny reports. Some there be who contend,
this Citern was a part near the Root of the Cedar, which, as they describe
that, is very Oriental and Oderiferous, but most of the Learned favor the
Citern, and that it grew not far from our Tangier, about the foot of Mount
Atlas, when happily some industrious Person might procure of it from the Moors;
and I have not forgotten to put his Excellency my Lord H. Howard in mind of it,
who will have all the opportunities of satisfying our Curiosity, that by
comparing it with those elegant Woods, both our own Countries, and the Indies
furnish, we might pronounce something in the Controversy. Here I think good to
add what honest Palissy Philosophises after his plain manner, about the reason
of those pretty undulations and chamfers, which we so frequently find in
diverse Woods; which he takes to be the descent as well as ascent of Moisture:
For what else (says he) becomes of that water which we often encounter in the
Cavities, when many branches divaricate and spread themselves at the tops of
great Trees (especially Pollards) unless (according to its natural appetite)
it sink into the very Body of the Stem through the Pores? For example, in the
Wall-nut, you shall find, when it is old, that the Wood is admirably figured,
and as it were marbl'd, and therefore much more esteemed by the Joyners,
Cabinet-makers, etc. then the Young, which is paler of Color, and without any
notable Grain, as they call it. For the Rain distilling along the Branches,
when many of them break out into clusters from the stem, sinks in, and is the
Cause of these marks; since we find it exceedingly full of pores: Do but Plane
off a thin chip, or sliver from one of these old Trees, and interposing it
'twixt your Eye and the Light, you shall observe it to be full of innumerable
holes (much more perspicuous and ample, by the application of a good
Microscope) But above all, notable for these extravagant Damaskings and
Characters, is the Maple; and it is notorious, that this Tree is very full of
Branches from the Root to its very Summit, by reason that it produces no
considerable Fruit: These Arms being frequently cut, the Head is more
surcharged with them, which spreading like so many Rays from a Center, form
that hollownesse at the top of the Stem whence they shoot, capable of
containing a good quantity of Water every time it Raines: This sinking into the
pores, as was before hinted, is compelled to divert its course as it passes
through the Body of the Tree, wherever it encounters the knot of any of those
Branches which were cut off from the stem; because their Roots not only deeply
penetrate toward the heart, but are likewise of themselves very hard and
impervious; and the frequent obliquity of this Course of the subsiding moisture
by reason of these obstructions, is, as may be conceived, the cause of those
curious works, which we find remarkable in this, and other woods, whose
Branches grow thick from the Stem. We have showed how by Culture and stripping
up, it arrives to a goodly Tree; and surely, there were some of them of large
bulk, and noble Shades, that Virgil should choose it for the Court of his
Evander, one of his Worthiest Princes in his best of Poems sitting in his
Maple-Throne; and when he brings Aeneas into the Royal Cottage, he makes him
this memorable Complement; Greater, says great Cowley, than ever was yet
spoken at the Escurial, the Louvre, or Whitehall.

This humble Roof, this Rustique Court, said he,
Received Alcides crowned with Victory:
Scorn not (great Guest) the steps where he has trod,
But contemn Wealth, and imitate a God.
-- Haec (inquit) limina Victor
Alcides --
CHAP. XII. Of the Sycomor.
Sycomor.
1. THE Sycomor, falsely so called, is, our Acer majus, one of the Maples, and
is much more in reputation for its shade than it deserves; for the leaves which
fall early (like those of the Ash) turn to Mucilage, and putrefie with the
first moisture of the season; so as they contaminate and mar our Walks, and are
therefore by my consent to be banished from all curious Gardens and Avenues.

2. There is in Germany a better sort of Sycomor then ours, wherewith they make
Saddle trees, and diverse other things of use; our own is excellent for
Trenchers, Cart, and Plow-timber, being light, tough, and not much inferior to
Ash it self; and if the trees be very tall and handsome, are the more tolerable
for distant Walks, especially where other better trees prosper not so well, or
where a sudden shade is expected.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Horn-beam.
1. OStrys the Horn-beam, in Latin ignorantly the Carpinus, Horn-beam.
is planted of Sets; though it may likewise be raised from the Seeds, which
being mature in August, should be sown in October; but the more expeditious way
is by Sets, of about an inch diametre, and cut within half a foot of the earth:
thus it will advance to a considerable Tree. The places it chiefly desires to
grow in are in cold hills, and in the barren and most exposed parts of woods.

2. Amongst other uses which it serves for, as Mill-cogs, etc. (for which it
excells either Yew or Crab) Yoak-timber (whence of old 'twas called (...))
Heads of Beetles, Stocks and Handles of Tools; It is likewise for the Turners
use excellent: Good Firewood, where it burns like a candle, and was of old so
employed; Carpinus taedas fissa facesque dabit. (For all which purposes its
extreme toughness and whiteness commends it to the Husbandman.) Being planted
in small Fosses or Trenches, at half a foot intervall, and in the single row it
makes the noblest, and the stateliest Hedges for long Walks in Gardens, or
Parks, of any Tree whatsoever whose leaves are deciduos, and forsake their
Branches in Winter; because it grows tall, and so sturdy, as not to be wronged
by the Winds: Besides, it will furnish to the very foot of the Stem, and
flourishes with a glossie and polished verdure which is exceeding delightful,
of long continuance, and of all other the harder Woods, the speediest Grower;
maintaining a slender, upright- stem, which does not come to be bare and sticky
in many years. That admirable Espalier-hedge in the long middle-walk of
Luxembourg Garden at Paris (than which there is nothing more graceful) is
planted of this Tree; and so is that Cradle, or Close walk, with that perplexed
Canopy, which covers the seat in his Majesty's Garden at Hampton Court. These
Hedges are tonsile; but where they are maintained to fifteen, or twenty foot
height (which is very frequent in the places before mentioned) they are to be
cut, and kept in order with a Sithe of four foot long, and very little
falcated; this is fixed on a long sneed or straight handle, and does
wonderfully expedite the trimming of these, and the like Hedges.

3. They very frequently plant a Clump of these Trees before the Entries of
most of the great Towns in Germany, to which they apply Timber-Frames for
convenience, and the People to sit and solace in. Scamozzi the Architect,
says, that in his time he found one whose Branches extended seventy foot in
breadth: This was at Vuimfen near the Necker, belonging to the Duke of
Witemberg: But that which I find planted before the Gates of Strasburgh, is a
Platanus and a Lime tree growing hard by one another, in which is erected a
Pergolo eight foot from the ground, of fifty foot wide, having ten Arches of
twelve foot height, all shaded with their folige; and there is besides this, an
Overgrown Oak, which has an Arbor in it of 60 foot diameter: hear we Rapinus
describe the use of our Horn-beam for these and other Elegancies.

In Walks the Horn-beam stands, or in a Maze
Through thousand self-entangling Labyrinths strays:
So clasp the Branches lopped on either side,
As though an Alley did two Walls divide:
This Beauty found, Order did next adorn
The Boughs into a thousand figures shorn,
Which pleasing Objects weariness betrayed,
Your feet into a Wilderness conveyed.
Nor better Leaf on twining Arbor spread,
Against the scorching Sun to shield your head.
In tractus longos facilis tibi Carpinus ibit,
Mill per errores, indeprehensosque recessus,
Et molles tendens secto seu pariete ramos,
Praebebit viridem diverso e margin scenam.
Primus honos illi quondam, post aditus ord^ est,
Attonsaeque coma, and formis quaesita voluptas
Innumeris, fartoque viae, obliquoque recessu:
In tractus acta est longos and opaca vireta.
Quinetiam egregiae tendens umbracula frondis
Temperat ardentes ramis ingentibus aestus.
CHAP. XIV. Of the Lime-Tree.
Lime-Tree.
TIlia the Lime-Tree, or [Linden] is of two kinds; the Male (which some allow
to be but a finer sort of Elm) is harder, fuller of knots, and of a redder
color; but producing neither Flower, nor Seed, as does the Female, whose
Blossom is very odoriferous, perfuming the Air: The Wood is likewise thicker,
of small pith, and not obnoxious to the Worm, so as it seems Theophrastus, de
Pl. l. 3. c. 10. said true, that though they were of both Sexes (...) etc. yet
they totally differed as to their form. We send commonly for this Tree into
Flanders and Holland, to our excessive cost, whiles our own Woods do in some
places spontaneously produce them, and though of somewhat a smaller leaf, yet
altogether as good, apt to be civilized, and made more florid. From thence I
have received many of their Berries; so as it is a shameful negligence, that we
are no better provided of Nurseries, of a Tree so choice, and universally
acceptable. For so they may be raised either of the Seeds in October, or (with
better success) by the Suckers, and Plants, after the same method, and in as
great abundance as the Elm, like to which it should be cultivated. But not
only by the Suckers, at the Roots, but even by Branches lop'd from the head,
may this Tree be propagated; and peeling off a little of the Bark, at a
competent distance from the Stem or Arms, and covering it with Lome mingled
with rich Earth, they will shoot their fibers, and may be seasonably separated:
But to facilitate this and the like attempts, it is advisable to apply a
ligature above the place, when the Sap is ascending, or beneath it, when it
descends.

2. The Lime-tree affects a rich feeding Soil; in such Ground their growth will
be almost incredible for speed and spreading. They may be Planted as big as
ones Leg; their Heads topp'd at about six foot bole; thus it will become (of
all other) the most proper and beautiful for Walks, as producing an upright
Body, smooth and even Bark, ample Leaf, sweet Blossom, and a goodly Shade at
distance of eighteen or twenty foot.

3. The Prince Elector did lately remove very great Lime-trees out of one of
his Forests, to a steep Hill exceedingly exposed to the heat of the Sun at
Hidelbourg; and that in the midst of Summer: They grow behind that strong Tower
on the South-west, and most torrid part of the eminence; being of a dry reddish
barren Earth; yet do they prosper rarely well: But the Heads were cut off, and
the Pits into which they were transplanted, were (by the industry and direction
of Monsieur de Son, a Frenchman, that admirable Mechanicean, who himself
related it to me) filled with a composition of Earth and Cow Dung, which was
exceedingly beaten, and so diluted with Water, as it became almost a liquid
pap: It was in this that he plunged the Roots, covering the surface with the
Turf: A singular example of removing so great Trees at such a season, and
therefore by me taken notice of here expressly.

4. The Timber of a well-grown Lime is convenient for any use that the Willow
is; but much to be preferred, as being both stronger, and yet lighter; whence
Virgil calls them tilias leves; and therefore fit for Yokes, and to be turned
into Boxes for the Apothecaries; and Columella commends Arculas tiliaceas. And
because of its Color and easy working, Architects make with it Modells for
their designed Buildings; and small Statues, and little curious Figures have
been Carved of this wood. With the twigs they made Baskets, and Cradles, and of
the smoother side of the Bark, Tablets for Writing; for the ancient Philyra is
but our Tilia. Bellonius says, that the Grecians made Bottles of it, which
they finely Rozin'd within side, also Lattices for Windows. The Gravers in Wood
do sometimes make use of this fine material; and even the coursest membrane, or
slivers of the Tree growing 'twixt the Bark and the main Body, they now twist
into Bass-ropes; Besides the Truncheons make a far better Coal for Gunpowder
than that of Alder it self: And the extraordinary candor and lightness, has
dignified it above all the VVoods of our Forest, in the hands of the Right
Honorable the VVhite-stave Officers of His Majesty's Imperial Court. Those
royal Plantations of these Trees in the Parks of Hampton Court, and St.
James's, will sufficiently instruct any man how these (and indeed all other
Trees which stand single) are to be governed, and defended from the injuries of
Beasts, and sometimes more unreasonable Creatures, till they are able to
protect themselves. In Holland (where the very High ways are adorned with
them) they frequently clap three, or four Deal-boards (in manner of a close
trunk) about them; but it is not so well; because it keeps out the Air, which
should have free access, and intercourse to the bole, and by no means be
excluded from flowing freely about them, or indeed any other Trees; provided
they are secured from the violence of impetuous winds, etc. as his Majesty's
are, without those close Coffins, in which the Dutchmen seem rather to bury
them alive: In the mean time, is there a more ravishing, or delightful object
then to behold some entire streets, and whole Towns planted with these Trees,
in even lines before their doors, so as they seem like Cities in a VVood? this
is extremely fresh, of admirable effect against the Epilepsie, for which the
delicately sented blossoms are held prevalent; and skreens the Houses both from
Winds, Sun, and Dust; then which there can be nothing more desirable where
Streets are much frequented.

The stately Lime, smooth, gentle, straight, and fair,
(With which no other Dryad may compare)
With verdant locks, and fragrant Blossoms decked,
Does a large, even, odorate Shade project.
Stat Philyra; haud omnes formos^or altera surgit
Inter Hamadryades; mollissima, candida, lavis,
Et viridante coma, and beneolenti flore superba,
Spargit odoratam late, atque aequaliter umbram.
Coulei l. 6. Pl. The distance for VValks may in rich ground be eighteen foot,
in more ordinary Soil, fifteen, or sixteen.

CHAP. XV. Of the Quick-Beam.
Quick-beam.
1. THe Quick-beam [ Ornus, or as the Pinax more peculiarly, Fraxinus bubula,
others, the Wild Sorb] or (as some term it) the Witchen, is a species of
wild-Ash. The berries which it produces in October, may then be sown; or rather
the Sets planted: It rises to a reasonable stature, shoots upright, and
slender; and consists of a fine smooth bark. It delights to be both in
Mountains and VVoods, and to fix it self in good light ground; Virgil affirms,
'twill unite with the Pear.

2. Besides the use of it for the Husbandmans Tools, the VVheel-wright commends
it for being all heart; and our Fletchers for Bows next to Eugh, which we
ought not to pass over, for the glory of right English Ancestors: In a Statute
of Hen. 8. you have it mentioned: It is excellent Fuel; but I have not yet
observed any other use, save that the Blossoms are of an agreeable scent, and
the Berries such a tempting Bait for the Thrushes, that as long as they last,
you shall be sure of their Company. Some highly commend the Juice of the
berries, which (fermenting of it self) if well preserved, makes an excellent
Drink, against the Spleen and Scorbut: Ale and Beer Brewed with these Berries,
being ripe, is an incomparable Drink

CHAP. XVI. Of the Birch.
1. THe Birch [Betula] is altogether produced of Suckers, Birch.
(though it sheds a kind of Samera about the Spring) which being planted at
four or five foot interval, in small Twigs, will suddenly rise to Trees;
provided they affect the ground, which cannot well be too Barren; for it will
thrive both in the dry, and the Wet, Sand, and Stony, Marshes, and Bogs; the
Water-galls, and uliginous parts of Forests that hardly bear any Grass, do
many times spontaneously produce it in abundance, whether the place be high, or
low, and nothing comes amiss to it. Plant the small Twigs, or Suckers having
Roots, and after the first year, cut them within an inch of the surface; this
will cause them to sprout in strong and lusty tufts, fit for Coppse, and
Spring-woods; or, by reducing them to one stem, render them in a very few years
fit for the Turner. For

2. Though Birch be of all other the worst of Timber, yet has it its various
uses, as for the Husbandmans Ox-yokes; also for Hoops, Paniers, Brooms, Wands,
bavin bands, and Wythes for Fagots; and claims a memory for Arrows, bolts,
Shafts, our old English Artillery; also for Dishes, Boules, Ladles, and other
domestic Utensils, in the good old days of more simplicity, yet of better and
truer Hospitality: Also for Fuel, great and small-Coal, which last is made by
charring the slenderest brush, and summities of the twigs; as of the Tops and
loppings M. Howards new Tanne. The inner silken-bark was anciently used for
Writing-Tables, even before the Invention of Paper; and of the out-ward
thicker, and courser part, are diverse Houses in Russia, and those poor Northern
Tracts covered, in stead of Slates, and Tyle: It Is affirmed by Cardan, that
some Birch-roots are so very extravagantly rein'd, as to represent the Shapes
and Images of Beasts, Birds, Trees, and many other pretty resemblances. Lastly,
of the whitest part of the old Wood, found commonly in doting Birches, is made
the grounds of our Gallants sweet-Powder; and of the quite consumed and rotten,
such as we find reduced to a kind of reddish Earth in superexannuated
hollow-trees, is gotten the best Mould for the raising of diverse Seedlings of
the rarest Plants and Flowers; to say nothing here of the Magisterial Fasces,
for which anciently the Gudgels were used by the Lictor; as now the gentler
Rods by our tyrannical Paedagogues.

3. I should here add the uses of the Water too, had I full permission to
tamper with all the Medicinal virtues of Trees: But if the sovereign effects of
the Juice of this despicable Tree supply its other defects (which makes some
judge it unworthy to be brought into the Catalogue of Woods to be propagated) I
may for once be permitted to play the Empiric, and to gratify our laborious
Woodman with a Draught of his own Liquor: And the rather, because these kind of
Secrets are not yet sufficiently cultivated; and ingenious Planters would by
all means be encouraged to make more trials of this nature, as the Indians, and
other Nations have done on their Palms, and Trees of several kinds, to their
great emolument. The Mystery is no more than this: About the beginning of March
(when the Buds begin to be proud and turgid) with a Chizel and a Mallet, cut a
slit almost as deep as the very Pith, under some bough, or branch of a well
spreading Birch; cut it oblique, and not long-wayes (as a good Surgeon would
make his orifice in a Vein) inserting a small stone or chip, to keep the Lips
of the wound a little open: Sir Hugh Plat, giving a general Rule for the
gathering of Sap, and Tapping of Trees, would have it done within one foot of
the ground, the first rind taken off, and then the white Bark slit overthwart,
no farther then to the Body of the Tree: Moreover, that this wound be made
only in that part of the bark which respects the South west, or between those
quarters; because (says he) little, or no Sap rises from the Northern. In this
slit, by the help of your knife to open it, he directs that a leaf of the Tree
be inserted, first fitted to the dimensions of the slit, from which the Sap
will distill in manner of filtration: Take away the leaf, and the bark will
close again, a little Earth being clapped to the slit: Thus the Knight for any
Tree: But we have already showed how the Birch is to be treated: Fasten
therefore a Bottle, or some such convenient Vessel appendant: This does the
effect as well as perforation or tapping: Out of this aperture will extil a
limpid and clear Water, retaining an obscure smack both of the taste and odor of
the Tree; and which (as I am credibly informed) will in the space of twelve, or
fourteen days preponderate, and outweigh the whole Tree it self, Body, and
Roots; which if it be constant, and so happen likewise in other trees, is not
only stupendous, but an experiment worthy the Consideration of our
profoundest Philosophers: an ex sola aqua fiunt Arbores? whether Water only be
the Principle of Vegetables, and consequently of trees: For evident it is, that
we know of no tree which does more copiously attract, be it that so much
celebrated Spirit of the World (as they call it) in Form of Water (as some) or
a certain specifique liquor richly impregnated with this Balsamical property:
That there is such a Magnes in this simple tree as does manifestly draw to it
self some occult and wonderful virtue, is notorious; nor is it conceivable,
indeed, the difference between the efficacy of that Liquor which distills from
the bole, or parts of the tree nearer to the Root (where Sir Hugh would
celebrate the Incision) and that which weeps out from the more sublime
Branches, more impregnated with this Astral Virtue, as not so near the Root,
which seems to attract rather a cruder and more common water, through fewer
strainers, and neither so pure and Aerial as in those refined percolations, the
nature of the places where these trees delight to grow (for the most part
lofty, dry, and barren) considered. But I refer these Disquisitions to the
Learned; especially, as mentioned by that incomparable Philosopher, and my most
noble Friend, the honorable Mr. Boil, in his Second part of the usefulness
of Natural Philosophy Sect. 1. Essay 3d. where he speaks of the Manna del
Corpo, or Trunk-Manna, as well as of that Liquor from the bough; so of the Sura
which the Coco-trees afford; and that Polonian secret of the Liquor of the
Wallnut-tree Root; with an encouragement of more frequent Experiments to educe
Saccharine substances upon these occasions: But the Book being published so
long since this Discourse was first ready, I have only here the liberty to
refer the Reader to one of the best Entertainments in the world.

4. But whilst this Second Edition is now under my hand, there comes to me
diverse Papers upon this subject experimentally made by a worthy Friend of mine,
a Learned and most industrious Person, which I had here once resolved to have
published, according to the generous liberty granted me for so doing; but
understanding he was still in pursuit of that useful, and curious Secret, I
changed my resolution into an earnest address, that he would communicate it to
the World himself, together with those other excellent Enquiries, and
observations which he is adorning for the benefit of Planters, and such as
delight themselves in those innocent Rusticities. I will only by way of
Corolarie, hint some particulars for satisfaction of the Curious; and
especially that we may in some sort gratify those earnest suggestions and
Queries of the most obliging Publisher of the Philosophical Transactions, to
whose indefatigable pains the Learned World is infinitely engaged. In
compliance therefore to his Queries, Monday October. 19. 1668. Numb. 40. p. 797,
821, etc. these Generals are submitted: That in such Trials as my Friend
essai'd, he has not yet encountered with any Sap but what is very clear and
sweet; especially that of the Sycomor, which has a dulcoration as if mixed with
Sugar, and that it runs one of the earliest: That the Maple distilled when
quite reseinded from the Body, and even whilst he yet held it in his hand: That
the Sycomor ran at the Root, which some days before yielded no Sap, from his
branches; the Experiment made at the end of March: But the accurate knowledge
of the nature of Sap, and its periodic Motions and properties in several Trees,
should be observed by some at entire leisure to attend it daily, and almost
continually, and will require more than any one persons industry can afford:
For it must be inquired concerning every tree, its age, soil, situation, etc.
the variety of its ascending Sap depending on it; and then of its Sap ascending
in the branches and Roots; descending in cut branches; descending from Root and
not from branches; the Seasons and difference of time in which those Accidents
happen, etc. He likewise thinks the best expedient to procure store of Liquor,
is, to cut the Trees almost quite through all the Circles on both sides the
Pith, leaving only the outmost Circle and the barks on the North, or North-East
side unpierced; and this hole the larger it is bored, the more plentifully
'twill distill; which if it be under, and through a large Arm, near the Ground,
it is effected with greatest advantage, and will need neither stone nor Chip to
keep it open, nor Spigot to direct it to the Recipient. Thus it will in a short
time, afford Liquor sufficient to Brew with; and in some of these sweet Saps,
one Bushel of Malt will afford as good Ale as four in ordinary Waters, even in
March it self; in others, as good as two Bushels; for this, prefering the
Sycomor before any other: But to preserve it in best condition for brewing,
till you are stored with a sufficient quantity, it is advised that what first
runs, be insolated, till the remainder be prepared to prevent its growing
sour: But it may also be fermented alone by such as have the Secret: To the
Curious these Essays are recommended. That it be immediately stopped up in
bottles in which it is gathered, the Corks well waxed and exposed to the Sun,
till (as was said) sufficient quantity be run; then let so much Rye-bread
(toasted very dry, but not burnt) be put into it as will serve to set it a
working; and when it begins to ferment, take it out, and Bottle it immediately.
If you add a few Cloves, etc. to steep in it, 'twill certainly keep the year
about: It Is a wonder how speedily it extracts the taste, and tincture of the
spice: Mr. Boil proposes a sulphurous fume to the bottles: Spirit of Wine may
happily not only preserve, but advance the Virtues of Saps; and Infusions of
Raisins are obvious, and without decoction best, which does but spend the more
delicate parts. Note that the Sap of the Birch will make excellent Meade.

5. To these Observations, that of the Weight, and Virtue of the several Juices
would be both useful and Curious: As whether that which proceeds from the bark,
or between that and the Wood be of the same nature with that which is supposed
to spring from the pores of the woody Circles? and whether it rise in like
quantity upon comparing the incisures? All which may be tried, first attempting
through the bark, and saving that apart, and then perforating into the Wood to
the thickness of the bark or more, with a like separation of what distills.
The period also of its current would be calculated; as how much proceeds from
the bark, in one hour, how much from the Wood or Body of the Tree, and thus
every hour, still a deeper incision with a good large Augre, till the Tree be
quite perforated: Then by making a second hole within the first, fitted with a
lesser pipe, the interior heart-sap may be drawn apart, and examined by Weight,
Quantity, Color, Distillation, etc. And if no difference perceptible be
detected, the presumption will be greater, that the difference of heart and Sap
in Timber, is not from the Saps plenty or penury, but the Season; and then
possibly, the very season of squaring, as well as Felling of Timber, may be
considerable to the preservation of it.

6. The notice likewise of the Saps rising more plentifully, and constantly in
the Sun, than Shade; more in the Day than Night, more in the Roots than Branch,
more Southward than Northward, etc. may yield many useful Observations: As for
Planting, to set thicker, or thinner (si coetera sint paria) namely the nature
of the Tree, Soil, etc.) and not to shade over much the Roots of those Trees
whose stems we desire should mount, etc. That in transplanting Trees we turn
the best, and largest Roots toward the South, and consequently the most ample
and spreading part of the head correspondent to the Roots: For if there be a
strong Root on that Quarter, and but a feeble attraction in the Branches, this
may not always counterpoise the weak Roots on the North-side, damnified by the
too puissant attraction of over large Branches: this may also suggest a cause
why Trees flourish more on the South Side, and have their Integument and Coats
thicker on those aspects annually, with diverse other useful speculations, if in
the mean time they seem not rather to be puntillos, over nice for a plain
Forester.

7. To show our Reader yet, that these are no novel Experiments, we are to
know, that a large Tract of the World almost altogether subsist on these Treen
Liquors; Especially, that of the Date, which being grown to about seven or
eight foot in height, they wound, as we have taught, for the Sap, which they
call Toddy, a very famous Drink in the East-Indias. This Tree increasing every
year about a foot, near the opposite part of the first Incisure, they pierce
again, changing the Receiver; and so still by opposite wounds and Notches, they
yearly draw forth the Liquor, till it arrive to near thirty foot upward, and of
these they have ample Groves and Plantations which they set at seven or eight
foot distance: But then they use to percolate what they extract, through a
Stratum made of the Rind of the Tree, well contus'd and beaten, before which
preparation it is not safe to Drink it; and it is observed, that some Trees
afford a much more generous Wine, than others of the same kind. In the Coco and
Palmeto Trees, they Chop a Bough as we do the Betula; but in the Date, make the
Incision with a Chisel in the Body very neatly, in which they stitch a Leaf of
the Tree as a lingula to direct it into the appendent Vessel, which the
subjoined Figure represents, and illustrates with its improvement to our former
Discourse:

Note, If there be no fitting Arms, the hole thus obliquely perforated, and a
Faucet or pipe inserted, will lead the Sap into the Recipient.

(a. b.) the body of the Tree (g.) boar'd at that part of the Arm (f.) joined
to the Stem, with an Augre of an inch or more diameter, according to the
bigness of the Tree. (c.) a part of the Bark bent down into the mouth of the
Bottle (e.) to conduct the Liquor into it. (d.) the String about the Arm (f.)
by which the Bottle hangs.



8. The Liquor of the Birch is esteemed to have all the Virtues of the Spirit
of Salt, De Lithias^ c. 8. n. 24.25. etc.
without the danger of its acrimony; most powerful for the dissolving of the
Stone in the Bladder: Helmont shows how to make a Beer of the Water; but the
Wine is a most rich Cordial, curing (as I am told) Consumptions, and such
interior Diseases as accompany the Stone in the Bladder or Reins: This Wine,
exquisitely made, is so strong, that the common sort of stone-bottles cannot
preserve the spirits, so subtle they are and volatile; and yet it is gentle,
and very harmless in operation within the body, and exceedingly sharpens the
Appetite, being drank ante pastum: I will present you a Receipt, as it was sent
me by a fair Lady.

9. To every Gallon of Birch-water put a quart of Honey well stirred together;
then boil it almost an hour with a few Cloves, and a little Limon-peel, keeping
it well scumm'd: When it is sufficiently boiled, and become cold, add to it
three, or four spoonfulls of good Ale to make it work (which it will do like
new Ale) and when the Yest begins to settle, bottle it up as you do other winy
Liquors. It will in a competent time become a most brisk, and spiritous Drink,
which (besides the former virtues) is a very powerful opener, and doing wonders
for cure of the Ptisick: This Wine may (if you please) be made as successfully
with Sugar in stead of Honey, lbj. to each Gallon of Water; or you may dulcifie
it with Raisins, and compose a Raisin-wine of it. I know not whether the
quantity of the sweet Ingredients might not be somewhat reduced, and the
operation improved: But I give it as received.

10. But besides these, Beech, Alder, Ash, Elder, etc. would be attempted for
Liquors: Thus Crabs, and even our very brambles, may possibly yield us medical
and useful Wines. The Poplar was heretofore esteemed more Physical than the
Betula. The Sap of the Oak, juice, or decoction of the inner bark cures the
Fashions, or Farcy, a virulent and dangerous infirmity in Horses, and which
(like Cancers) were reputed incurable by any other Topic, then some actual, or
potential cautery: But, what is more noble; a dear Friend of mine assured me,
that a Country Neighbor of his (at least fourscore years of age) who had lain
sick of a bloody Strangury (which by cruel torments reduced him to the very
article of Death) was, under God, recovered to perfect, and almost miraculous
health, and strength (so as to be able to fall stoutly to his labor) by one
sole Draught of Beer, wherein was the decoction of the internal bark of the
Oak-tree; And I have seen a Composition of an admirable sudorific, and diuretic
for all affections of the Liver, out of the like of the Elm, which might yet be
drank daily as our Cophee is, and with no less delight; but Quacking is not my
Trade: I speak only here as a plain Husband man, and a simple Forester, out of
the limits whereof I hope I have not unpardonably transgressed. Pan was a
Physician, and he (you know) was President of the Woods. But I proceed.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Hasel.
Hasel.
1. NVx Sylvestris, or Corylus, the Hasel, is best raised from the Nuts, which
you shall sow like Mast in a pretty deep furrow toward the end of February:
Light ground may immediately be sown and harrow'd in very accurately; but in
case the mould be clay, plow it earlier, and let it be sufficiently mellow'd
with the Frosts; and then the third year, cut your Trees near to the ground
with a sharp bill, the Moon decreasing.

2. But if you would make a Grove for Pleasure, Plant them in Fosses at a yard
distance, and cut them within half a foot of the earth, dressing them for three
or four Springs and Autumns, by only loosning the Mould a little about their
roots. Others there are, who set the Nuts by hand at one foot distance, to be
transplanted the third year at a yard asunder: But this work is not to be taken
in hand so soon as the Nuts fall, till Winter be well advanced; because they
are exceedingly obnoxious to the Frosts; nor will they sprout till the Spring;
besides, Vermin are great devourers of them: Preserve them therefore moist,
not moldy; by laying them in their own dry leaves, or in Sand, till January.

Hasels from Sets and Suckers take.
Plantis and durae Coryli nascuntur --
Georg 2. 3. From whence they thrive very well, the shoots being of the
scantlings of small wands, and switches, or somewhat bigger, and such as have
drawn diverse hairy twiggs, which are by no means to be disbranch'd no more than
their Roots, unless by a very sparing and discreet hand. Thus your Coryletum or
Copse of Hasels being Planted about Autumn, may (as some practice it) be cut
within three or four inches of the ground the Spring following, which the new
Cyon will suddenly repair, in clusters and tufts of fair poles of twenty, and
sometimes thirty foot long: But I rather should spare them till two, or three
years after, when they shall have taken strong hold, and may be cut close to
the very Earth; the improsperous, and feeble ones especially. Thus, are
likewise Filberts to be treated, both of them improved much by transplanting,
but chiefly by Graffing, and it would be tried with Filberts, and even with
Almonds themselves, for more elegant Experiments.

4. For the Place, they above all affect cold, barren, dry, and Sandy grounds;
also Mountains, and even Rockie Soils produce them; but more plentifully, if
somewhat moist, dankish, and Mossie, as in the fresher bottoms, and sides of
Hills, and in Hedge-rowes. Such as are maintained for Coppses, may after Twelve
years be felled the first time; the next at seven or eight, etc. for by this
period their Roots will be completely vigorous. You may Plant them from October
to January, provided you keep them carefully Weeded till they have taken fast
hold.

5. The use of the Hasel is for Poles, Spars; Hoops, Forks, Angling rods,
Faggots, Cudgels, Coals, and Springes to catch birds; and it makes one of the
best Coals, once used for Gunpowder, being very fine and Light, till they
found Alder to be more fit: There is no Wood which purifies Wine sooner, than
the Chipps of Hasel: Also for VVith's and Bands, upon which I remember Pliny
thinks it a pretty Speculation, that a Wood should be stronger to bind withal
being bruised and divided, then when whole and entire; lastly, for Riding
Switches and Divinatory Rods for the detecting and finding out of Minerals; at
least, if that Tradition be no imposture. But the most signal Honor it was
ever employed in, and which might deservedly exalt this humble, and common
Plant above all the Trees of the Wood, is that of Hurdles; not for that it is
generally used for the Folding of our Innocent Sheep, an Emblem of the Church;
but for making the Walks of one of the first Christian Oratories in the World;
and particularly in this Island, that venerable and Sacred Fabric at
Glastenbury, founded by S. Joseph of Arimathea, which is storied to have been
first composed but of a few small Hasel-Rods interwoven about certain Stakes
driven into the ground; and Walls of this kind, in stead of Laths and
Punchions, superinduced with a course Mortar made of Loam and Straw, does to
this day, enclose diverse humble Cottages, Sheads, and Outhouses in the
Country; and it is strong and lasting for such purposes, whole, or Cleft, and I
have seen ample enclosures of Courts and Gardens so secured.

6. There is a compendious expedient for the thickning of Copses which are too
transparant, by laying of a Sampler, or Pole of an Hasel, Ash, Poplar, etc. of
twenty, or thirty foot in length (the head a little lopped) into the ground,
giving it a Chop near the foot, to make it succumb; this fastened to the earth
with a hook or two, and covered with some fresh mould at a competent depth (as
Gardeners lay their Carnations) will produce a world of Suckers, thicken, and
furnish a Copse speedily. But I am now come to the VVaterside; let us next
consider the Aquatic.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the Poplar, Aspen, and Abele.
Poplar.
1. POpulus. I begin this second Class (according to our former distribution)
with the Poplar, of which there are several kinds; White, Black, etc. (which in
Candy it is reported bears seed) besides the Aspen. The white is the most
ordinary with us, to be raised in abundance by every set or slip. Fence the
ground as far as any old Poplar roots extend, they will furnish you with
suckers innumerable, to be slipped from their mothers, and transplanted the
very first year. You shall need no other Nursery. When they are young, their
leaves are somewhat broader and rounder then when they grow aged. In moist and
boggie places they will flourish wonderfully, so the ground be not spewing; but
especially near the margins and banks of Rivers, Populus in fluviis -- and in
low, sweet and fertile grounds. Also trunchions of seven or eight foot long,
thrust two foot into the earth, (a hole being made with a sharp hard stake,
filled with water, and then with fine earth pressed in and close about them)
when once rooted, may be cut at six inches above ground; and thus placed at a
yard distant, they will immediately furnish a kind of Copse. But in case you
plant them of rooted trees, or smaller sets, fix them not so deep; for though
we bury the trunchions thus profound, yet is the root which they strike
commonly but shallow. They will make prodigious shoots in 15 or 16 years; but
then the heads must by no means be diminished, but the lower branches may, yet
not too far up: the foot would also be cleansed every second year. This for the
White. The Black Poplar is frequently pollar'd when as big as ones arm, eight
or nine foot from the ground, as they trim them in Italy for their Vines to
serpent on, and those they poll or head every second year, sparing the middle,
straight and thrivingest shoot, and at the third year cut him also.

2. The shade of this tree is esteemed very wholesome in Summer, and the leaves
good for cattle, which must be stripped from the cut boughs before they are
faggotted. This to be done in the decrease of October, and reserved in bundles
for the winter fodder. The wood of white Poplar is sought of the Sculptor, and
they saw both sorts into boards, which, where they lie dry, continue a long
time. Of this material they also made Shields of defense in Sword and Buckler
days. Dioscorides writes, that the bark chopped small, and sowed in rills, well
and richly manured and watered, will produce a plentiful crop of Mushrums. It
is to be noted, that those Fungi, which spring from the putrid stumps of this
tree, are not venomous (as of all or most other trees they are) being gathered
after the first Autumnal rains.

3. They have a Poplar in Virginia of a very peculiar shaped leaf, as if the
point of it were cut off, which grows very well with the curious amongst us to
a considerable stature. I conceive it was first brought over by John Tradescant
under the name of the Tulip-tree, but is not that I find taken notice of in any
of our Herbals; I wish we had more of them.

4. The Aspen only (which is that kind of Libica or white Poplar, Aspen.
bearing a smaller and more tremulous leaf) thrusts down a more searching foot,
and in this likewise differs, that he takes it ill to have his head cut off:
Pliny would have short trunchions couched two foot in the ground (but first two
days dried) at one foot and half distance, and then molded over.

5. There is something a finer sort of white Poplar, Abele.
which the Dutch call Abele, and we have much transported out of Holland: these
are also best propagated of slips from the roots, the least of which will take,
and may in March, at three or four years growth be transplanted.

6. In Flanders (not in France, as a late Author pretends) they have large
Nurseries of them, which first they plant at one foot distance, the mould light
and moist, by no means clayie, in which though they may shoot up tall, yet for
want of root they never spread; for, as I said, they must be interred pretty
deep, not above three inches above ground; and kept clean by pruning them to
the middle shoot for the first two years, and so till the third or fourth. When
you transplant, place them at eight, ten, or twelve foot intervall: They will
likewise grow of layers, and even of cuttings in very moist places. In three
years they will come to an incredible altitude; in twelve, be as big as your
middle; and in eighteen or twenty, arrive to full perfection. A specimen of
this advance we have had of an Abele tree at Sion, which being lopped in Febr.
1651, did by the end of October 52 produce branches as big as a man's wrist, and
17 foot in length: for which celerity we may recommend them to such late
builders, as seat their houses in naked and unsheltered places, and that would
put a guise of Antiquity upon any new Enclosure; since by these, whilst a man
is in a voyage of no long continuance, his house and lands may be so covered,
as to be hardly known at his return. But as they thus increase in bulk, their
value (as the Italian Poplar has taught us) advances likewise; which after the
first seven years is annually worth twelve pence more; So as the Dutch look
upon a plantation of these trees as an ample portion for a daughter, and none
of the least effects of their good Husbandry; which truly may very well be
allowed if that calculation hold, which the Knight has asserted, who began his
plantation not long since about Richmond, that 30 lib. being laid out in these
plants, would render at the least ten thousand pounds in eighteen years; every
tree affording thirty plants, and every of them thirty more, after each seven
years improving twelve pence in growth, till they arrived to their acme.

7. The Black Poplar grows rarely with us; it is a stronger and taller tree
then the White, the leaves more dark, and not so ample. Diverse stately ones of
these I remember about the banks of Po in Italy; which river being the old
Eridanus, so celebrated by the Poets, in which the temerarious Phaeton is said
to have been precipitated, doubtless gave argument to that fiction of his sad
Sisters Metamorphosis into these trees; but for the Amber of their precious
tears I could hear of no such matter, whiles passing down that River toward
Ferrara, I diverted my self with this story of the ingenious Poet. I am told
there is a Mountain Poplar much propagated in Germany about Vienna, and in
Bohemia, of which some trees have yielded Planks of a yard in breadth.

8. The best use of the Poplar and Abele (which are all of them hospitable
trees, for any thing thrives under their shades) is for Walks and Avenues about
Grounds which are situated low, and near the water, till coming to be very old,
they are apt to grow knurry, and out of proportion. The timber is incomparable
for all sorts of white wooden vessels, as Trays, Bowls, and other Turners ware;
and of especial use for the Bellows-maker, because it is almost of the nature
of Cork, though not very solid, yet very close: also for wooden heels, etc.
Vitruvius l. 2. de materia caedenda reckons it among the Building Timbers, quae
maxim in aedificiis sunt idoneae. Likewise to make Carts, because it is
exceeding light; for Vine, and Hop-props, and diverse viminious works. The
loppings in January are for the fire; and therefore such as have proper
Grounds, may with ease and in short time store themselves for a considerable
family, where fuel is dear: but the truth is, it burns untowardly, and rather
moulders away than maintains any solid heat. Of the twigs (with the leaves on)
are made Brooms. The Brya or Catkins attract the Bees, as do also the leaves
(especially of the black) more tenacious of the Mel^dews then most other
Forest-trees, the Oak excepted.

Of the Aspen our Wood-men make Hoops, Firewood, and Coals, etc.

The juice of Poplar leaves dropped into the ears asswages the pain; and the
buds contus'd and mixed with Honey, is a good Collyrium for the eyes.

CHAP. XIX. Of the Alder.
1. ALnus, Alder.
the Alder is of all other the most faithful lover of watery and boggie places,
and those most despised weeping parts or water-galls of Forests; -- crassisque
paludibus Alni. They are propagated of Trunchions, and will come of seeds (for
so they raise them in Flanders, and make wonderful profit of the plantations)
like the Poplar; or of Roots, which I prefer, being set as big as the small of
ones leg, and in length about two foot; whereof one would be plunged in the
mud. This profound fixing of Aquatick trees being to preserve them steady, and
from the concussions of the winds, and violence of waters in their liquid and
slippery foundations. They may be placed at four or five foot distance, and
when they have struck root you may cut them, which will cause them to spring in
clumps, and to shoot out into many useful Poles. But if you plant smaller Sets,
cut them not till they are arrived to some competent bigness; and that in a
proper season: which is, for all the Aquatics not till Winter be well advanced,
in regard of their pithy substance. Therefore, such as you shall have occasion
to make use of before that period, ought to be well-grown, and fell^d with the
earliest, and in the first quarter of the increasing Moon; that so the
successive shoot receive no prejudice. But there is yet another way of planting
Alders after the Jersey manner, and as I received it from a most ingenious
Gentleman of that Country, which is, by taking trunchions of two or three foot
long, at the beginning of Winter, and to bind them in faggots, and place the
ends of them in water 'till toward the Spring, by which season they will have
contracted a swelling spire or knurr about that part, which being set, does
(like the Gennet-moil Apple) never fail of growing and striking root. There is
a black sort more affected to Woods and drier grounds.

2. There are a sort of Husbands who take excessive pains in stubbing up their
Alders, where ever they meet them in the boggie places of their grounds, with
the same indignation as one would exstirpate the most pernicious of Weeds; and
when they have finished, know not how to convert their best lands to more
profit then this (^eeming despicable plant might lead them to, were it rightly
understood. Besides, the shadow of this tree does feed and nourish the very
grass which grows under it; and being set and well plashed, is an excellent
defense to the banks of Rivers; so as I wonder it is not more practiced about
the Thames, to fortify and prevent the mouldring of the walls, and the violent
weather they are exposed to.

3. You may cut Aquatic-trees every third or fourth year, and some more
frequently, as I shall show you hereafter. They should also be abated within
half a foot of the principal head, to prevent the perishing of the main Stock;
and besides, to accelerate their sprouting. In setting the Trunchions it were
not amiss to prepare them a little after they are fitted to the size, by
laying them a while in water; this is also practicable in Willows, etc.

4. Of old they made Boats of the greater parts of this Tree, and excepting
Noah's Ark; the first Vessels we read of, were made of this VVood.

When hollow Alders first the Waters tried,
Tunc alnos primum fluvii sensere cavatas.
Georg. 1. And down the rapid Poe light Aldars glide.
Nec non and torrentem undam levis innatat alnus
Missa Pado --
2. And as then, so now, are overgrown Alders frequently sought after, for
such Buildings as lie continually under water, where it will harden like a very
stone; whereas being kept in any unconstant temper it Rots immediately, because
its natural humidity is of so near affinity with its adventitious; as Scaliger
assigns the cause. Vitruvius tells us, that the Morasses about Ravenna in
Italy, were pil'd with this Timber, to superstruct upon, and highly commends
it. I find also they used it under that famous Bridge at Venice, the Rialto
which passes over the Gran-Canal bearing a vast weight.

5. The Poles of Alder are as useful as those of Willows; but the Coals far
exceed them; especially for Gunpowder: The wood is likewise useful for Piles,
Pumps, Hop-poles, Water-pipes, Troughs, Sluices, small Trays, and Trenchers,
Wooden-heels; the bark is precious to Dyers, and some Tanners and
Leather-dressers make use of it; and with it, and the Fruits (in stead of
Galls) they make Ink. The fresh Leaves alone applied to the naked soal of the
Foot, infinitely refresh the surbated Traveller; and the swelling bunches which
are now and then found in the old Trees, afford the Inlayer pieces curiously
chambletted and very hard, etc. but the Fagots better for the Fire than for the
draining of Grounds, by placing them (as the guise is) in the Trenches; which
old rubbish of Flints, Stones, and the like gross materials, does infinitely
exceed, because it is for ever, preserves the Drains hollow, and being a little
molded over will produce good grass, without any detriment to the ground; but
this is a secret, not yet well understood, and would merit an express
Paragraph, were it here seasonable, -- and jam nos inter opacas
Musa vocat Salices --


CHAP. XX. Of the Withy, Sally, Ozier, and Willow.
1. SAlix, W^t^*
since Cato has attributed the third place to the Salictum, preferring it even
next to the very Ortyard; and (what one would wonder at) before even the Olive,
Meadow, or Corn-field it self (for Salictum tertio loco, nempe post vineam,
etc.) and that we find it so easily raised, of so great and universal Use, I
have thought good to be the more particular in my Discourse upon them;
especially, since so much of that which shall Publish concerning them, is
derived from the long Experience of a most Learned and ingenious Person, from
whom I acknowledge to have received many of these hints. Not to perplex the
Reader with the various names, Greek, Gallic, Sabinic, Amerine, Vitex, etc.
better distinguished by their growth, and bark; and by Latin Authors all
comprehended under that of Salices; and our English Books reckon them
promiscuously thus; The Common-white Willow, the Black, and the Hard-black, the
Rose of Cambridge, the Black-Withy, the Round-long Sallow; the longest Sallow,
the Lesser-broad-leav'd Willow, Silver Sallow, Upright broad-Willow, Repent
broad-leaf'd, the Red-stone, the Lesser Willow, the Strait-Dwarf, the Creeper,
the Black-low-Willow, the Willow-bay, and the Ozier. I begin with the Withy.

2. The Withy is a reasonable large Tree, and fit to be planted on high Banks;
because they extend their Roots deeper then either Salleys or Willows. For this
reason you shall Plant them at ten, or twenty foot distance; and though they
grow the slowest of all the Twiggie Trees; yet do they recompense it with the
larger crop; the wood being tough, and the Twigs fit to bind strongly; the very
peelings of the branches being useful to bind Arbor-poling, and in Topiary
works, Vineyards, Espalier-fruit, and the like. There are two principal sorts
of these Withies, the hoary, and the red Withy which is the Greek; toughest,
and fittest to bind, whiles the Twigs are flexible and tender. Sally.


3. Sallyes grow much faster, if they are Planted within reach of water, or in
a very Moorish ground, or flat plain; and where the Soil is (by reason of
extraordinary moisture) unfit for Arable, or Meadow; for in these cases it is
an extraordinary improvement: In a word, where Birch, and Alder will thrive.
Before you Plant them, it is found best to turn the ground with a Spade;
especially, if you design them for a flat. We have three sorts of Sallyes
amongst us (which is one more than the Ancients challenged, who name only the
Black, and White which was their Nitellina) the vulgar, which proves best in
dryer Banks, and the hopping-Sallyes which require a moister Soil, growing with
incredible celerity: And a third kind, of a different color from the other
two, having the twigs reddish, the Leaf not so long, and of a more dusky green;
more brittle whilst it is growing in twigs, and more tough when arrived to a
competent size: All of them useful for the Thatcher.

4. Of these, the hopping-Sallyes are in greatest esteem, being of a clearer
terse grain, and requiring a more succulent Soil; best planted a foot deep, and
a foot and half above ground (though some will allow but a foot) for then every
branch will prove excellent for future setlings. After three years growth
(being cropped the second and third) the first years increase will be 'twixt
eight and twelve foot long generally; the third years growth strong enough to
make Rakes, and Pike-staves; and the fourth for M. Blithes's tren^hing Plow,
and other like Vtensils of the Husbandman.

5. If ye Plant them at full height (as some do, at four years growth, setting
them five, or six foot length, to avoid the biting of Cattle) they will be
less useful for straight staves, and for setlings, and make less speed in
their growth; yet this also is a considerable improvement.

6. These would require to be Planted at least five foot distance, (some set
them as much more) and in the Quincunx order: If they affect the Soil, the Leaf
will come large, half as broad as a Man's hand, and of a more vivid green,
always larger the first year than afterward: Some Plant them sloping, and
cross-wise like a Hedge, but this impedes their wonderful growth; and (though
Pliny seems to commend it, teaching us how to excorticate some places of each
set, for the sooner production of shoots) it is but a deceitful Fence, neither
fit to keep out Swine, nor Sheep; and being set too near, inclining to one
another, they soon destroy each other.

7. The worst Sallyes may be planted so near yet, as to be instead of Stakes in
a Hedge, and then their Tops will supply their dwarfishnesse; and to prevent
Hedge-breakers many do thus Plant them; because, they cannot easily be pulled
up, after once they have struck root.

8. If some be permitted to wear their Tops five or six years, their Palms will
be very ample, and yield the first, and most plentiful relief to Bees, even
before our Abricots Blossom. The hopping-Sallys open, and yield their Palms
before other Sallys, and when they are blown (which is about the exit of May,
or sometimes June) the Palms (or (...), frugiperdae as Homer terms them for
their extreme levity) are four inches long, and full of a fine lanuginous
Cotton: A poor Body might in an hours space, gather a pound or two of it, which
resembling the finest Silk, might doubtless be converted to some profitable
use by an ingenious House-wife, if gathered in calm Evenings, before the Wind,
Rain and Dew impair them; I am of opinion, if it were dried with care, it might
be fit for Cushions, and Pillows of Chastity, for such of old was the
reputation of those Trees.

9. Of these hopping Sallys, after three years Rooting, each Plant will yield
about a score of Staves of full eight foot in length, and so following, for
use, as we noted above: Compute then how many fair Pike-staves, Perches, and
other useful Materials, that will amount to in an Acre, if Planted at five foot
interval: But a fat, and moist Soil, requires indeed more space than a lean or
dryer; namely six, or eight foot distance.

10. You may Plant setlings of the very first years growth; but the second year
they are better, and the third year better then the second; and the fourth as
good as the third; especially, if they approach the Water. A bank at a foot
distance from the water, is kinder for them then a Bog, or to be altogether
immersed in the water.

11. It Is good to new- mould them about the Roots every second or third year;
but Men seldom take the pains. It seems that Sa^lys are more hardy then even
Willows and Oziers, of which Columella takes as much care as of Vines
themselves. But ^is cheaper to supply the vacuity of such accidental decays by
a new Plantation, then to be at the charge of digging about them three times a
year, as that Author advises; seeing some of them will decay, whatever care be
used.

12. Sallys may also be propagated like Vines, by courbing, and bowing them in
Arches, and covering some of their parts with mould, etc.

13. For Setlings, those are to be preferred which grow nearest to the Stock,
and so (consequently) those worst, which most approach the Top. They should be
Planted in the first fair, and pleasant Weather in February, before they begin
to bud; we about London begin at the latter end of December. They may be cut in
Spring for Fuel, but best in Autumn for use; but in this work (as of Poplar)
leave a twig or two; which being twisted Archwise, will produce plentiful
sprouts, and suddenly furnish a head.

14. If in our Coppses one in four were a Sally set, amongst the rest of
varieties, the profit would recompense the care.

15. The swift growing Sally is not so tough, and hardy for some uses as the
slower, which makes Stocks for Gardeners Spades; but the other are proper for
Rakes, Pikes, Mops, etc. Sally-Coal is the soonest consumed; but of all others
the most accommodate for Painters to design their Work, and first draught on
Paper with, etc. as being fine, and apt to slit into Pencils.

16. To conclude, there is a way of Graffing a Sally trunchion; take it of two
foot and half long as big as your wrist; Graff at both ends a Figure, and
Mulberry Cyon of a foot long, and so, without claying, set the Stock so far
into the ground as the Plant may be three or four inches above the Earth: This
will thrive exceedingly the first year, and in three, be fit to transplant. The
Season for this Curiosity is February.

Oziers.
17. Oziers or the Aquatic Salix, are of innumerable kinds, commonly
distinguished from Sallyes, as Sallyes are from Withies; being so much smaller
then the Sallyes, and shorter lived, and requiring more constant moisture, yet
would be Planted in rather a dryish ground, than over moist and spewing, which
we frequently cut Trenches to avert: It likewise yields more limber, and
flexible twigs for Baskets, Flaskets, Hampers, Cages, Lattices, Cradles, the
Bodies of Coaches, and Wagons, for which it is of excellent use, light, durable,
and neat, as it may be wrought and covered: For Chairs, Hurdles, Stays, Bands,
etc. likewise for Fish Wairs, and to support the Banks of impetuous Rivers: In
fine, for all Wicker and Twiggie Works: Viminibus Salices --

18. But these sort of Oziers would be cut in the new shoot; for if they stand
longer they become more inflexible; cut them close to the head (a foot or so
above earth) about the beginning of October; unless you will attend till the
Cold be past, which is better; and yet we about London, Cut them in the most
piercing Seasons, and Plant them also till Candlemass, which those who do not
observe, we Judge ill Husbands, as I learn from a very Experienced
Basket-maker; and in the decrease, for the benefit of the Workman, though not
altogether for that of the Stock, and succeeding Shoot: When they are cut, make
them up into bundles, and give them shelter; but such as are for White-work (as
they call it) being thus fagotted, and made up in Bolts, as the term is,
severing each sort by themselves, should be set in water, the ends dipped; but
for black, and unpeel'd preserved under Covert only, or in some Vault or
Cellar, to keep them fresh, sprinkling them now and then in excessive hot
Weather: The peelings of the former are for the use of the Gardener, and
Cooper; or rather the splicings.

19. We have in England these three vulgar sorts; one of little worth, being
brittle, and very much resembling the forementioned Sally, with reddish twigs,
and more greenish, and rounder Leaves: Another kind there is, called Perch, of
limber and green twigs, having a very slender leaf; the third sort is totally
like the second, only the twigs are not altogether so green, but yellowish,
and near the Popinjay: This is the very best for Use, tough, and hardy. But the
most usual names by which Basket makers call them about London, and which are
all of different species, therefore to be Planted separately, are, the hard
Gelster, the Horse Gelster, Whyning, or shrivelled Gelster, the Black Gelster,
in which Suffolk abounds. Then follow the Golstones, the Hard and the Soft
Golston (brittle, and worst of all the Golstones) the sharp, and slender top'd
yellow Golston; the fine Golston: Then is there the Yellow Ozier, the
Green-Ozier, the Snake or speckled Ozier, Swallow-tayl, and the Spaniard: To
these we may add amongst the number of Oziers (for they are both governed and
used alike) the Flanders Willow, which will arrive to be a large Tree as big
as ones middle, the oftener cut the better: With these our Coopers tie their
Hoops, to keep them bent. Lastly, the white-Sallow, which being of a Year or
two growth, is used for Green-work; and if of the toughest sort, to make
quarter-Can-hoops, of which our Seamen provide great quantities, etc.

20. These choicer sorts of Oziers, which are ever the smallest; also the
golden-yellow, and white, which is preferred for propagation, and to breed of,
should be Planted of slips of two, or three years growth a foot deep, and half
a yard length, in Moorish ground, or banks, or else in furrows; so that (as
some direct) the Roots may frequently reach the water; for Fulminibus Salices
-- though we commonly find it rots them, and therefore never choose to set them
so deep as to sent it, and at three, or four foot distance.

21. The Season for Planting is January, and all February, though some not till
mid- February, at two foot square; but Cattle being excessively liquorish of
their leaves and tender buds, some talk of a graffing them out of reach upon
Sallys, and by this, to advance their sprouting; but as the work would consume
time, so have I never seen it succeed.

22. Some do also Plant Oziers in their Eights like Quick-sets, thick, and
(near the water) keep them not more than half a foot above ground; but then
they must be diligently cleans'd from Moss, Slab, and Ouze, and frequently
pruned (especially the smaller spires) to form single shoots; at least, that
few, or none grow double: These, they head every second year about September,
the Autumnal cuttings being best for use: But generally

23. You may cut VVithies, Sallys, and VVillows, at any mild and gentle season
between leaf and leaf, even in VVinter; but the most congruous time both to
Plant, and to cut them is Crescente Luna Vere, circa calendas Martias; that is,
about the new Moon, and first open weather of the early Spring.

24. It is in France, upon the Loire, where these Eights (as we call them) and
Plantations of Oziers and VVithies are perfectly understood; and both there,
and in diverse other Countries beyond Seas, they raise them of the Seeds,
contained in their Juli or Catkins, which they sow in Furrows or shallow
Trenches, and it springs up like Corn in the blade, and come to be so tender
and delicate, that they frequently mow them with a Scyth: This we have
attempted in England too, even in the place where I live, but the obstinate,
and unmerciful Weed did so confound them, that it was impossible to keep them
clean with any ordinary Industry, and so they were given over: It seems either
weeds grow not so fast in other Countries, or that the People (which I rather
think) are more patient and laborious. The Ozier is of that Emolument, that in
some places I have heard twenty-pounds has been given for one Acre; ten is in
this part an usual price; and doubtless, it is far preferrable to the best
Corn-land; not only for that it needs but once Planting, but because it yields
a constant Crop and revenue to the Worlds end; and is therefore in esteem of
knowing Persons, valued in Purchase accordingly; considered likewise, how
easily it is renewed, when a Plant now and then fails, by but pricking in a twig
of the next at hand, when you visie to cut them: We have in this Parish where I
dwell, improved Land from less than one pound, to near ten pounds the Acre:
And when we shall reflect upon the infinite quantities of them we yearly bring
out of France and Flanders, to supply the extraordinary expense of Basket-work,
etc. for the Fruiterers, Lime-burners, Gardners, Coopers, Packers up of all
sorts of Ware, and for general Carriage, which seldom last above a Journey or
two; I greatly admire Gentlemen do no more think of employing their moist
grounds (especially, where Tides near fresh Rivers are reciprocal) in Planting
and propagating Oziers. To omit nothing of the Culture of this useful Ozier,
Pliny would have the place to be prepared by trenching it a foot and half deep,
and in that, to fix the sets or cuttings of the same length at six foot
interval. These (if the sets be large) will come immediately to be Trees; which
after the first three years, are to be abated within two foot of the ground.
Then, in April, he advises to dig about them: Of these they formerly made
Vine-props, and one Acre has been known to yield Props sufficient to serve a
Vineyard of twenty five Acres.

25. John Tradescant brought a small Ozier from S. Omers in Flanders, which
makes incomparable Net-work^, not much inferior to the Indian twig or
bent-work^ which we have seen; but if we had them in greater abundance, we
should happily want the Artificers who could employ them.

Willow.
26. Our common Salix or Willow, is of two kinds, the white and the black: The
white is also of two sorts, the one of a yellowish, the other of a browner
Bark: The black Willow is Planted of stakes of three years growth, taken from
the head of an old Tree, before it begins to sprout: Set them of six foot high,
and ten distant. Those Woody sorts of Willow delight in Meads and Ditch-sides,
rather dry, then over wet (for so they last longest) yet the black sort, and
the reddish do sometimes well in more boggie grounds, and would be Planted of
Stakes as big as on's Leg, cut as the other, at the length of five or six foot,
and fixed a foot or more into the earth; the hole made with an Oken-stake and
beetle, or with an Iron crow (some use a long Augur) so as not to be forced in
with too great violence: But first, the Trunchions should be a little slop'd at
both extremes, and the biggest planted downwards: To this, if they are soaked
in water two or three days (after they have been sized for length, and the
twigs cut off ere you plant them) it will be the better. Let this be done in
February; the mould as well closed to them as possible, and treated as was
taught in the Poplar. If you Plant for a kind of VVood or Coppse (for such I
have seen) set them at six foot distance, or nearer, in the Quincunx, and be
careful to take away all Suckers from them at three years end: You may abate
the head half a foot from the Trunk, viz. three, or four of the lustiest
Shoots, and the rest cut close, and bare them yearly, that the three or four
you left, may enjoy all the Sap, and so those which were spared, will be
gallant Pearches within two years. Arms of four years growth will yield
substantial sets to be Planted at eight, or ten foot distance; and for the
first three years well defended from the Cattle, who infinitely delight in
their leaves, green or withered. Thus, a Willow may continue twenty, or five
and twenty years, with good profit to the industrious Planter, being headed
every four or five years; some have been known to shoot no less then twelve
foot in one year, after which the old, rotten Dotards may be felled, and easily
supplied. But if you have ground fit for whole Coppses of this wood, cast it
into double Dikes, making every fosse near three foot wide; two and half in
depth; then leaving four foot at least of ground for the earth (because in such
Plantations the moisture should be below the Roots, that they may rather see
than feel the Water) and two Tables of Sets on each side, plant the Ridges of
these Banks with but one single Table, longer, and bigger than the Collateral,
viz. three, four, five or six foot high, and distant from each other about two
yards. These banks being carefully kept weeded for the first two years, till
the Plants have vanquished the Grass, and not cut till the third; then lop
them traverse, and not obliquely, at one foot from the ground, or somewhat
more, and he will head to admiration: But such which are cut at three foot
height, are most durable, as least soft and aquatic: They may also be Graffed
'twixt the Bark, or budded; and then they become so beautiful, as to be fit
for some kind of delightful Walks; and this I wish were practiced among such as
are seated in low, and Marshy places, not so friendly to other Trees. Every
Acre at eleven, or twelve years growth, may yield you near an hundred Load of
Wood: Cut them in the Spring for dressing; but in the Fall for Timber and Fuel:
I have been informed, that a Gentleman in Essex, has lopped no less than 2000
yearly, all of his own planting. It is far the sweetest of all our English
Fuel, provided it be sound and dry, and emitting little Smoke is the fittest
for Ladies Chambers; and all those Woods and Twiggs would be cut either to
Plant, Work with, or Burn in the dryest time of the day.

27. There is a sort of Willow of a slender and long Leaf, resembling the
smaller Ozier; but rising to a Tree as big as the Sally, full of knots, and of
a very brittle spray, only here rehearsed to acknowledge the variety.

28. There is likewise the Garden-willow, which produces a sweet and beautiful
flower, fit to be admitted into our Hortulan ornaments, and may be set for
partitions of squares; but they have no affinity with other. There is also in
Shropshire another very odoriferous kind.

29. What most of the former enumerated kinds differ from the Sallys, is indeed
not much considerable, they being generally u^eful for the same purposes; as
Boxes, such as Apothecaries and Goldsmiths use; for Cart-Saddle-trees, yea,
Gun-stocks, and Half-Pikes, Harrows, Shooe-makers Lasts, Heels, Clogs for
Pattens, Forks, Rakes, especially the Tooths, which should be wedged with Oak,
but let them not be cut for this when the Sap is stirring, because they will
shrink, Pearches, Hop-poles, Ricing of Kidny-beans, and for Supporters to
Vines, when our English Vineyards come more in request: Also for Hurdles,
Sieves, Lattices; for the Turner, Kyele-pins, great Town-Topps; for Platters,
little Cashes and Vessels; especially to preserve Verjuices in the best of any:
Pailes are also made of cleft Willow, Dorsers, Fruit-baskets, Canns, Hives for
Bees, Trenchers, Trays, and for polishing and whetting Table-Knives, the Butler
will find it above any Wood or Whet-stone; also for Coals and Bavin, not
forgetting the fresh boughs, which of all the Trees in nature, yield the most
chaste and coolest Shade in the hottest season of the day; and this Umbrage so
wholesome, that Physicians prescribe it to Feverish persons, permitting them
to be placed even about their Beds, as a safe and comfortable refrigerium. The
wood being preserved dry will dure a very long time; but that which is found
wholly putrifi'd, and reduced to a loamy earth in the hollow trunks of
superannuated Trees, is, of all other, the fittest to be mingled with fine
mould, for the raising our choicest Flowers, such as Anemonies, Ranunculus's,
Auriculas, and the like.

What would we more? low Broom, and Sallys wild,
Or feed the Flock, or Shepherds shade, or Field
Hedges about, or do us Honey yield.
Quid majora sequ^r? Salices, humilesque genista.
Aut illae pecori frondem, aut pastoribus umbram
Sufficient, sepemque satis, and pabula melli.
Georg. 2. 30. Now by all these Plantations of the Aquatic Trees, it is
evident, the Lords of Moorish Commons, and unprofitable Wastes, may learn some
Improvement, and the neighbor Bees be gratified; and many Tools of Husbandry
become much cheaper. I conclude, with the Learned Stephanus's note upon these
kind of Trees, after he has enumerated the universal benefit of the Salictum:
Nullius enim tutior reditus, minorisve impendii, aut tempestatis securior.

CHAP. XXI. Of Fences, Quick-sets, etc.
1. OUr main Plantation is now finished, Fences.
and our Forest adorned with a just variety: But what is yet all this labor,
but loss of time, and irreparable expense, unless our young, and (as yet)
tender Plants be sufficiently guarded from all external injuries for, as old
Tusser, If Cattle, or Cony may enter to Crop,
Young Oak is in danger of losing his Cop.
But with something a more polished style, though to the same purpose, the best
of Poets, Plash Fences thy Plantation round about,
And whilst yet Young, be sure keep Cattle out;
Severest Winters, scorching Sun infest,
And Sheep, Goats, Bullocks, all young Plants molest;
Yet neither Cold, nor the hoar rigid Frost,
Nor Heat reflecting from the Rocky Coast,
Like Cattle Trees, and tender Shoots consound,
When with envenomed Teeth the twigs they wound.
Texendae sepes etiam, and pecus omne tenendum est:
Praecipue, dum frons tenera, imprudensque laborum
Cui, super indignas hyemes, solemque potentem,
Sylvestres Vri assidue, capreaeque sequaces
Illudunt: Pascuntur Oves, avidaeque juven^ae.
Frigora nec tantum cana concreta pruina,
Aut gravis incumbens scopulis arentibus astas,
Quantum illi nocuere greges, durique venenum
Dentis, and admorso signata in stirpe cicatrix.
Georg. 2.

2. For the reason that so many complain of the improsperous condition of their
Wood-lands, and Plantations of this kind, proceeds from this neglect; though (
Sheep excepted) there is no employment whatsoever incident to the Farmer, which
requires less expense to gratify their expectations: One diligent, and skilful
Man will govern five hundred Acres: But if through any accident a Beast shall
break into his Masters Field; or the wicked Hunters make a Gap for his Dogs and
Horses, what a clamor is there made for the disturbance of a years Crop at most
in a little Corn? whiles abandoning his young Woods all this time, and perhaps
many years, to the venomous bitings and treading of Cattle, and other like
injuries (for want of due care) the detriment is many times irreparable: Young
Trees once cropp'd hardly ever recovering: It is the bane of all our most
hopeful Timber.

3. But shall I provoke you by an instance? A Kins-man of mine has a Wood of
more than 60 years standing; it was, before he purchased it, exposed and
abandoned to the Cattle for diverse years: some of the outward skirts were
nothing save shrubs and miserable starvlings; yet still the place had a
disposition to grow woody; but by this neglect continually suppressed. The
industrious Gentleman has Fenced in some Acres of this, and cut all close to
the ground; it is come in eight or nine years, to be better worth than the Wood
of sixty; and will (in time) prove most incomparable Timber, whiles the other
part so many years advanced, shall never recover; and all this from no other
cause, than preserving it fenced: Judge then by this, how our Woods come to be
so decried: Are five hundred Sheep worthy the care of a Shepherd? and are not
five thousand Oaks worth the fencing, and the inspection of a Hayward? And
shall men doubt to Plant, and careful be?
Et dabitant homines serere, atque impendere curam?
Georg. 2. Let us therefore shut up what we have thus laboriously Planted, with
some good Quick-set hedge. Which, -- All Countries bear, in every ground
As Denizen, or Enter-loper found:
From Gardens and tilled fields expelled, yet there
On the extremes stands up, and claims a share.
Nor Mastiff-dog, nor Pike-man can be found
A better Fence to the enclosed Ground.
Such breed the rough and hardy Cantons rear,
And into all adjacent Lands prefer,
Tough rugged Churles; and for the Battle fit,
Who Courts and States with Complement or Wit
To civilize nor to instruct pretend;
But with stout faithful service to defend.
This Tyrants know full well, nor more confide
On Guards that serve less for Defense than Pride:
Their Persons safe they do not judge amiss,
And Realms committed to their Guard of Swisse.
-- Omne solum natale est, intrat ubique
Ardelio; illa quidem culiis excluditur agris
Plerumque, atque hortis; sed circumsepit utrosque
Atque omnes adytus servat fidissima custos,
Vtilior latrante Cane, armatoque Priapo.
Aspera frigoribus saxisque Helvetia tales
Educat, and peregis terras emittit in omnes
Enormes durosque viros, sed fortia bell^
Pectora; non illi cultu, non moribus Aulas,
Atque Vrbes decorare valent, sed utrasque fideli
Defendunt opera; nec iis, gens cauta, Tyranni,
Praeponunt speciosa magis, multumque sonora
Praefidia; his certi vitam tutantur opesque, etc.
Couleii pl. l. 6. For so the ingenious Poet has metamorphos'd him, and I could
not withstand him.

Quick-sets.
4. The Hei-thorne, and indeed the very best of common hedges, is either raised
of Seeds or Plants; but then it must not be with despair, because sometimes you
do not see them peep the first year; for the Haw, and many other Seeds, being
invested with a very hard Integument, will now and then suffer imprisonment two
whole years under the earth; and impatience of this does often frustrate the
expectation of the resurrection of diverse seeds of this nature; so as we
frequently dig up, and disturb the beds where they have been sown, in despair,
before they have gone their full time; which is also the reason of a very
popular mistake in other Seeds: Especially, that of the Holly, concerning which
there goes a tradition; that they will not sprout till they be passed through
the Maw of a Thrush; whence the saying, Turdus exitium suum cacat (alluding to
the Viscus made thereof, not the Missleto of Oak) but this is an error, as I
am able to testify on experience; they come up very well of the Berries, and
with patience; for (as I affirmed) they will sleep sometimes two entire years
in their Graves; as will also the seeds of Yew, Sloes, Phillyrea angustifolia,
and sundry others, whose shells are very hard about the small kernels; but
which is wonderfully facilitated, by being (as we directed) prepared in beds,
and Magazines of Earth or Sand for a competent time, and then committed to the
ground before the full in March, by which season they will be chitting, and
speedily take Root: Others bury them deep in the ground all Winter, and sow
them in February: And thus I have been told of a Gentleman who has considerably
improved his Revenue, by sowing Haws only, and raising Nurseries of Quick-sets,
which he sells by the hundred far and near: This is a commendable industry; any
neglected corners of ground will fit this Plantation.

5. But Columella has another expedient for the raising of our spinetum, by
rubbing the now mature Hips and Haws into the crevices of Bass ropes, and then
burying them in a Trench: Whether way you attempt it, they must (so soon as
they peep, and as long as they require it) be sedulously cleans'd of the weeds,
which, if in beds for transplantation, had need be at the least three or four
year; by which time even your seedlings will be of stature fit to remove; for I
do by no means approve of the vulgar praemature Planting of Sets, as is
generally used throughout England; which is to take such only as are the very
smallest, and so to crowd them into three or four files, which are both
egregious mistakes.

6. Whereas it is found by constant experience, that Plants as big as ones
thumb, set in the posture, and at the distance which we spoke of in the
Horn-beam; that is, almost perpendicular (not altogether, because the Rain
should not get in 'twixt the Rind and wood) and single, or at most not
exceeding a double row, do prosper infinitely, and much outstrip the densest,
and closest ranges of our trifling Sets, which make but weak shoots, and whose
roots do but hinder each other, and for being couched in that posture on the
sides of Banks and Fences (especially where the earth is not very tenacious)
are bared of the mould which should entertain them, by that time the Rains and
Storms of one Winter, have passed over them. In Holland, and Flanders (where
they have the goodliest Hedges of this kind about the Counter-scarps of their
invincible fortifications, to the great security of their Musketeers upon
occasion) they Plant them according to my description, and raise Fences so
speedily, and so impenetrable, that our best are not to enter into the
comparison. Yet, that I may not be wanting to direct such as either affect the
other way, or whose Grounds may require some Bank of Earth, as ordinarily the
verges of Coppses, and other Enclosures do: You shall by line cast up your
fosse of about three foot broad, and about the same depth, provided your mould
hold it; beginning first to turn the turf, upon which, be careful to lay some
of the best Earth to bed your Quick in, and there lay, or set the Plants; two
in a foot space is sufficient; being diligent to procure such as are fresh
gathered, straight, smooth, and well rooted; adding now and then, at equal
spaces of twenty or thirty foot, a young Oakling or Elme-sucker, Ash or the
like, which will come in time to be ornamental Standards, and good Timber: If
you will needs multiply your rows, a foot or somewhat less: Above that, upon
more congested mould, plant another rank of sets, so as to point just in the
middle of the vacuities of the first, which I conceive enough: This is but for
the single Fosse; but if you would fortify it to the purpose, do as much on
the other side, of the same depth, height, and planting; and then last of all,
cap the top in Pyramid with the worst, or bottom of the Ditch: Some, if the
mould be good, plant a row or two on the Edge, or very crest of the mound,
which ought to be a little flatned: Here also many set their dry-Hedge, to
defend, and shade their under-plantation, and I cannot reprove it: But great
care is to be had in this work, that the main bank be well footed, and not made
with too sudden a declivity, which is subject to fall-in after frosts and wet
weather; and this is good husbandry for moist grounds; but where the Land lies
high, and is hot and gravelly, I prefer the lower fencing; which, though even
with the area it self, may be protected with stakes and a dry hedge, the
distance competent, and to very good purposes of educating more frequent Timber
amongst the rows.

8. Your Hedge being yet Young, should be constantly weeded, (of Brambles
especially, the great Dock, and Thistle, etc.) though some admit not of this
work after Michaelmas, for Reasons that I approve not: It has been the practice
of Herefordshire, in the plantation of Quick-set-hedges, to plant a Crab-stock
at every twenty-foot distance; and this they observe so Religiously, as if they
had been under some rigorous Statute requiring it: But by this means, they were
provided in a short time with all advantages for the graffing of Fruit amongst
them, which does highly recompense their industry. Some cut their Sets at three
years growth even to the very ground, and find that in a year or two, it will
have shot, as much as in seven, had it been let alone.

9. When your Hedge is now near six years stature, plash it about February or
October; but this is the work of a very dextrous and skilful Husbandman; and
for which our honest Countryman M. Markam gives excellent directions; only I
approve not so well of his deep cutting, if it be possible to bend it, having
suffered in some thing of that kind: It is almost incredible to what perfection
some have laid these Hedges, by the rural way of plashing, better than by
clipping; yet may both be used for ornament, as where they are planted about
our Garden-fences, and fields near the Mansion. In Scotland, by tying the young
shoots with bands of hay, they make the stems grow so very close together, as
that it encloseth Rabbets in Warrens instead of pales.

10. And now since I did mention it, and that most I find do greatly affect the
vulgar way of Quicking (that this our Discourse be in nothing deficient) we
will in brief give it you again after Geo. Markams description, because it is
the best and most accurate, although much resembling our former direction, of
which it seems but a Repetition, 'till he comes to the plashing. In a Ground
which is more dry then wet (for watery places it abhors) plant your Quick thus:
Let the first row of Sets be placed in a trench of about half a foot deep, even
with the top of your ditch, in somewhat a sloping, or inclining posture: Then,
having raised your bank near a foot upon them, plant another row, so as their
tops may just peep out over the middle of the spaces of your first row: These
covered again to the height or thickness of the other, place a third rank
opposite to the first, and then finish your bank to its intended height. The
distances of the plants would not be above one foot; and the season to do the
work in, may be from the entry of February, till the end of March; or else in
September, to the beginning of December. When this is finished, you must guard
both the top of your Bank, and outmost verge of your Ditch, with a sufficient
dry-hedge interwoven from stake to stake into the earth (which commonly they do
on the bank) to secure your Quick from the spoil of Cattle. And then being
careful to repair such as decay, or do not spring, by suppling the dead, and
trimming the rest; you shall after three years growth, sprinkle some
Timber Trees amongst them; such as Oak, Beech, Ash, Maple, Fruit, or the like;
which being drawn young out of your Nurseries, may be very easily inserted. But
that which we affirmed to require the greatest dexterity in this work, is, the
artificial plashing of our Hedge when it is now arrived to a six or seven years
head; though some stay till the tenth or longer. In February therefore, or
October, with a very sharp hand-bill cut away all superfluous sprays and
straglers which may hinder your progress, and are useless. Then, searching out
the principal stems, with a keen and light Hatchet, cut them slant-wise close
to the Ground, about three quarters through, or rather, so far only, as till
you can make them comply handsomely, which is your best direction, and so lay
it from you sloping as you go, folding in the lesser branches which spring from
them; and ever within a five, or six foot distance, where you find an upright
set (cutting off only the top to the height of your intended hedge) let it
stand as a stake to fortify your work, and to receive the twinings of those
branches about it. Lastly, at the top (which would be about five foot above
ground) take the longest, most slender and flexible twigs which you reserved
(and being cut as the former where need requires) bind in the extremities of
all the rest, and thus your work is finished: This being done very close, and
thick, makes an impregnable Hedge, in few years; for it may be repeated as you
see occasion; and what you so cut away, will help to make your dry-hedges for
your young Plantations, or be profitable for the Oven, and make good Bavin. For
stakes in this work, Oak is to be preferred, though some will use Elder, or
the Black-Thorn droven well in at every yard of interval; and even your
plash'd-hedges need some small thorns to be laid over to protect the Spring
from Cattle and Sheep, 'till they are somewhat fortified; and the doubler the
winding is lodged, the better; which should be beaten, and forced down together
with the stakes, as equally as may be. Note, that in sloping your Windings, if
it be too low done (as very usually) it frequently mortifies the tops;
therefore, it ought to be so bent, as it may not impead the mounting of the
Sap: If the plash be of a great, and extraordinary age, wind it at the nether
boughs all together, and cutting the sets as directed, permit it rather to hang
downwards a little, than rise too forwards; and then twist the branches into
the work, leaving a set free and unconstrained at every yard space; besides
such as will serve for stakes, abated to about five-foot-length (which is a
competent stature for an Hedge) and so let it stand. One shall often find in
this work, especially in Old neglected Hedges, some great Trees, or stubs, that
commonly make gaps for Cattle: Such, should be cut so near the Earth, as 'till
you can lay them thwart, that the top of one, may rest on the root, or stub of
the other, as far as they extend, stopping the cavities with its boughs and
branches; and thus Hedges which seem to consist but only of Scrubby-Trees and
stumps, may be reduced to a tolerable Fence. We have been the longer on these
descriptions, because it is of main importance, and that so few Husbandmen are
perfectly skilled in it.

10. The Roots of an Old Thorn is excellent both for Boxes and Combs, and is
curiously and naturally wrought: I have read, that they made ribs to some small
Boats or Vessels with the White-Thorn. The Black-Crab rightly seasoned and
treated, is famous for Walking-staves* and if overgrown used in Mill-work.
Here we owe due Elogy to the Industry of that honorable Person my Lord Ashley,
who has taught us to make such Enclosures of Crab-stocks only, planted close
to one another, as there is nothing more impregnable and becoming; or you may
sow Sider-kernels in a rill, and fence it for a while with a double dry Hedge,
not only for a sudden and beautiful, but a very profitable Enclosure;
because, amongst other benefits, they will yield you Sider-fruit in abundance:
But in Devonshire, they build two walls with their stones, setting them
edgeways, two, and then one between; and so as it rises, fill the intervall or
Cofer with Earth (the breadth and height as you please) and continuing the
stone-work, and filling, and as you work beating in the stones flat to the
sides, which causes them to stick everlastingly: This is absolutely the
neatest, most saving, and profitable Fencing imaginable, where slaty stones are
in any abundance; and it becomes not only the most secure to the Lands, but
the best for Cattle to lie warm under the Walls; when other Hedges, (be they
never so thick) admit of some cold winds in Winter time that the leaves are of:
Upon these Banks they plant not only Quick sets, but even Timber Trees which
exceedingly thrive, being out of all danger.

11. The Pyracanth, Paliurus, and like pretioser sorts of Thorn might easily
be propagated into plenty sufficient to store even these vulgar Uses were Men
industrious; and then how beautiful, and sweet would the environs of our Fields
be? for there are none of the spinous shrubs more hardy, nor fitter for our
defense. Thus might Berberies now and then be also inserted among our hedges,
which, with the Hips, Haws, and Cornel-berries, do well in light lands, and
would rather be planted to the South than North or West, as usually we observe
them.

13. Some (as we noted) mingle their very hedges with Oaklings, Ash, and Fruit
trees sown, or planted, and it is a laudable improvement; though others do
rather recommend to us Sets of all one sort, and will not so much as admit of
the Black-Thorne to be mingled with the White, because of their unequal
progress; and indeed, Timber Trees set in the Hedge (though contemporaries with
it) do frequently wear it out; and therefore I should rather encourage such
Plantations to be at some Yards near the Verges, than perpendicularly in them.

14. In Cornwall they secure their Lands and Woods with high Mounds, and on
them they plant Acorns, whose roots bind in the looser mould, and so form a
double, and most durable Fence, incircling the Fields with a Coronet of Trees.
They do likewise (and that with great commendation) make hedges of our Genista
Spinosa, prickly Furzes, of which they have a taller sort, Furzes.
such as the French employ for the same purpose in Bretaigne, where they are
incomparable husbands.

15. It is to be sown (which is best) or planted of the roots in a furrow: If
sown, weeded till it be strong: both Tonsile, and to be diligently clipped,
which will render it very thick, an excellent and beautiful hedge: Otherwise
permitted to grow at large, 'twill yield very good Faggot: It is likewise
admirable Covert for wildefowle, and will be made to grow even in moist, as
well as dry places: The young, and tender tops of Furzes, being a little
bruised, and given to a lean sickly Horse, will strangely recover and plump
him. Thus, in some places, they sow in barren grounds (when they lay them down)
the last crop with this seed, and so let them remain till they break them up
again, and during that interim, reap considerable advantage: Would you believe
(writes a worthy Correspondent of mine) that in Herefordshire (famous for
plenty of wood) their Thickets of Furzes ( viz. the vulgar) should yield them
more profit, then a like quantity of the best Wheat land of England? for such
is theirs, if this be questioned, the Scene is within a mile of Hereford, and
proved by anniversary experience, in the Lands, as I take it, of a Gentleman
who is now one of the Burgesses for that City. And in Devonshire (the seat of
the best Husbands in the World) they sow on their worst Land (well plowed) the
seeds of the rankest Furzes, which in four or five years becomes a rich Wood:
no provender (as we say) makes Horses so hardy, as the young tops of these
Furzes; no other Wood so thick, nor more excellent Fuel; and for some purposes
also, yielding them a kind of Timber to their more humble buildings, and a
great refuge for Fowl and other Game: I am assured, in Bretaigne it is sometimes
sown no less then twelve yards thick, for a speedy, profitable, and
impenetrable Mound: If we imitated this husbandry in the barren places of
Surrey, and other parts of this Nation, we might exceedingly spare our woods;
and I have bought the best sort of French seed at the shops in London. It seems
that in the more Eastern parts of Germany, and especially in Poland, this
vulgar trifle, and even our common Broom is so rare, that they have desired the
seeds of them out of England, and preserve them with extraordinary care in
their best Gardens; this I learn out of our Johnsons Herbal; by which we may
consider, that what is reputed a curse and a cumber in some places, is esteemed
the ornament and blessing of another: But we shall not need go so far for this,
since both Beech and Birch are almost as great strangers in many parts of this
Nation, particularly Northampton and Oxfordshire.

Broom.
15. This puts me in mind of the Broom; another improvement for Barren grounds,
and saver of more substantial Fuel: It may be sown English, or (what is more
sweet, and beautiful) the Spanish, with equal success. In the Western parts of
France, and Cornwall, it grows with us to an incredible height (however our
Poet give it the epithete of humilis) and so it seems they had it of old, as
appears by Gratius his Genistae Altinates, with which (as he affirms) they used
to make staves for their Spears, and hunting Darts.

Elder.
16. Lastly, a considerable Fence may be made of the Elder, set of reasonable
lusty trunchions; much like the Willow, and (as I have seen them maintained)
laid with great curiosity, and far excelling those extravagant plantations of
them about London, where the lops are permitted to grow without due and skilful
laying. There is a sort of Elder which has hardly any Pith; this makes
exceeding stout Fences, and the Timber very useful for Cogs of Mills, Butchers
Skewers, and such tough employments. Old trees do in time become firm, and
close up the hollowness to an almost invisible pith. But if the Medicinal
properties of the Leaves, Bark, Berries, etc. were thoroughly known, I cannot
tell what our Countryman could aile for which he might not fetch a Remedy from
every Hedge, either for Sickness or Wound: The inner Bark of Elder, or, in
season, the Buds, boyld in Water-grewel for a Breakfast, has effected wonders
in the Fever; and the decoction is admirable to assuage Inflammations and
tetrous humors, and especially the Scorbut: But an Extract or Therica may be
composed of the Berries, which is not only efficacious to erradicate this
Epidemical inconvenience, and greatly to assist Longaevity (for famous is the
story of Naeander) but is a kind of Catholicon against all Infirmities
whatever: The Water of the leaves and Berries are approved in the Dropsy, every
part of the Tree is useful: The Ointment made with the young buds and leaves in
May with Butter, is most sovereign for Aches, shrunk sinnues, etc. And less
than this could I not say (with the leave of the charitable Physician) to
gratify our poor Wood-man; and yet when I have said all this, I do by no
means commend the sent of it, which is very noxious to the Air, and therefore,
though I do not undertake that all things which sweeten the Air are
salubrious, nor all ill savors pernicious; yet, as not for its beauty, so
neither for its smell, would I plant Elder or much Box near my Habitation: The
Elder does likewise produce a certain green Fly, almost invisible, which is
exceedingly troublesome, and whose sting is plainly venomous, smarts
vehemently, and gathers a fiery redness where it ataques.

19. There is a Shrub called the Spindle-Tree, Evonymus or Fusanum, Evonymus.
commonly growing in our Hedges, which bears a very hard wood, of which they
sometimes made Bows for Viols, and the Inlayer used it for its color, and
Instrument-makers for Toothing of Organs and Virginal-keys, Tooth-pickers, etc.
What we else do with it I know not, save that, according with its name abroad,
they make spindles with it. Here might come in (or be named at least) the
Wild-Cornel, good to make Mill-Cogs, Pestles, Bobins for Bonelace, Cornel.
etc. Lastly, the Viburnum, or Wayfaring tree, growing also plentifully in
every corner, makes the most plyant and best bands to Faggot with.

20. Yucca.
The American Yucca is a hardier plant then we take it to be; for it will
suffer our sharpest Winter, as I have seen by experience, without that trouble,
and care of setting it in Cases in our Conservatories for hyemation; such as
have beheld it in Flower (which is not indeed till it be of some age) must
needs admire the beauty of it; and it being easily multiplied, why should it
not make one of the best, and most ornamental Fences in the world for our
Gardens, with its natural palisados, as well as the more tender, and impatient
of moisture the Aloes does for their Vineyards in Languedoc, etc. but We
believe nothing improvable, save what our Grand fathers taught us. Finally, let
trial likewise be made of that Thorn mentioned by Cap. Liggon in his History of
Barbados; whether it would not be made grow amongst us, and prove as convenient
for fences as there; the Seeds or Sets transported to us with due care. And
thus, having accomplished what (by your Commands) I had to offer concerning the
propagation of the more Solid, Material, and useful Trees, as well the Dry, as
Aquatical; and to the best of my talent fenced our Plantation in, I should here
conclude, and set a bound likewise to my Discourse, by making an Apology for
the many errors and impertinencies of it; did not the zeal, and ambition of
this Illustrious Society to promote and improve all Attempts which may concern
the Public utility or Ornament, persuade Me, that what I am adding for the
farther encouragement to the planting of some other useful (though less Vulgar)
Trees, will at least obtain your pardon, if it miss of your Approbation.

21. To discourse in this style of all such Fruit Trees as would prove of
greatest emolument to the whole Nation, Fruit Trees.
were to design a just Volume; and there are directions already so many, and so
accurately delivered and published (but which cannot be affirmed of any of the
former Classes of Forest-trees and other remarkes, at the least to my poor
knowledge and research) that it would be needless to Repeat.

22. I do only wish (upon the prospect, and meditation of the universal
Benefit) that every person whatsoever, worth ten pounds per annum, within his
Majesty's Dominions, were by some indispensable Statute obliged to plant his
Hedg-rows with the best, and most useful kinds of them; especially, in such
places of the Nation, as being the more inland Counties, and remote from the
Seas and Navigable Rivers, might the better be excused from the planting of
Timber, to the proportion of those who are more happily and commodiously
situated for the transportation of it.

22. Undoubtedly, if this course were taken effectually, a very considerable
part both of the Meat and Drink which is spent to our prejudice, might be saved
by the Country People, even out of the Hedges and Mounds, which would afford
them not only the pleasure and profit of their delicious Fruit, but such
abundance of Sider and Perry, as should suffice them to drink of one of the
most wholesome and excellent Beverages in the World. Old Gerard did long since
alledg us an example worthy to be pursued; I have seen (says he, speaking of
Apple Trees, lib. 3. cap. 101.) in the Pastures and Hedgrows about the Grounds
of a Worshipful Gentleman dwelling two miles from Hereford, called Mr. Roger
Bodnome, so many Trees of all sorts, that the Servants drink for the most part
no other drink but that which is made of Apples: The quantity is such, that by
the report of the Gentleman himself, the Parson has for Tithe many Hogs-heads
of Sider: The Hogs are fed with the fallings of them, which are so many, that
they make choice of those Apples they do eat, who will not taste of any but of
the best. An Example doubtless to be followed of Gentlemen that have Land and
Living; but Envy says, The Poor will break down our Hedges, and we shall have
the least part of the Fruit; but forward in the Name of God, Graff, Set, Plant,
and nourish up Trees in every corner of your Ground; the labor is small, the
cost is nothing, the commodity is great; your selves shall have plenty, the
poor shall have somewhat in time of want to relieve their necessity, and God
shall reward your good minds and diligence. Thus far honest Gerard. And in
truth, with how small a charge, and infinite pleasure this were to be effected,
every one that is Patron of a little Nursery can easily calculate: But by this
Expedient, many thousands of Acres, sowed now yearly with Barley, might be
cultivated for Wheat, or converted into Pasture to the increase of Corn, and
Cattle: Besides, the Timber which the Pear Tree, Black-Cherry afford, and many
thorny plums (which are best for grain, color and gloss) afford, comparable
(for diverse curious Uses) with any we have enumerated. The Black-Cherry-Wood
grows sometimes to that bulk, as is fit to make stools with, Cabinets,
Tables, especially the redder sort, which will polish well; also Pipes, and
Musical Instruments, the very bark employed for Bee-Hyves: But of this I am to
render a more ample Account in the Appendix to this Discourse. I would farther
recommend the more frequent planting, and propagation of Fir, Pine-trees, and
some other beneficial Materials both for Ornament and profit; especially, since
we find by experience, they thrive so well, where they are cultivated for
Curiosity only.

CHAP. XXII. Of the Fir, Pine, Pinaster, Pitch-tree, etc.
1. ABies, Pinus, Pinaster, Picea, etc. Fir.
are all of them easily raised of the Kernels, and Nuts, which may be gotten
out of their Cones and Clogs, by exposing them a little before the fire, or in
warm water, till they begin to gape, and are ready to deliver themselves of
their numerous burden.

2. There are of the Fir two principal species; the Male which is the bigger
Tree most beautiful and tapering, and of a harder wood; the Female, which is
much the softer, and whiter. Though Whiteness be not the best character; that
which knowing Workmen call the Dram, and that comes to us from Bergen,
Swinsound, Moss, Longlound, Dranton, etc. long, strait, clear, and of a yellow
more Cedrie color, is esteemed much before the White for flooring and
wainscot; For Masts, etc. Those of Prusia, which we call Spruse, and Norway
(especially from Gottenberg) are the best; unless we had more commerce of them
from our Plantations in New England, which are preferrable to any of them. In
the Scottish High-lands are Trees of wonderful altitude (though not altogether
so tall, thick and fine as the former) which grow upon places so unaccessable,
and far from the Sea, that (as one says) they seem to be planted of God on
purpose for Nurseries of Seed, and monitors to our Industry, reserved with
other Blessings, to be discovered in our days amongst the new-invented
Improvements of Husbandry, not known to our Southern people of this Nation,
etc. Did we consider the pains they take to bring them out of the Alps, we
should less stick at the difficulty of transporting them from the utmost parts
of Scotland. To the former sorts we may add the Esterund Firs, Tonsberry,
Fredrick-stad, Hellerone, Holmstrand, Landifer, Stavenger, Lawrwat, etc. They
may be sown in beds, or cases, at any time during March; and when they peep,
carefully defended with Furzes, or the like fence, from the rapacious birds,
which are very apt to pull them up, by taking hold of that little infecund part
of the seed, which they commonly bear upon their tops: The Beds wherein you sow
them had need be sheltered from the Southern Aspects with some skreen of Reed,
or thick hedge: Sow them in shallow rills, not above half-inch-deep, and cover
them with fine light mould: Being risen a finger in height, establish their
weak stalks, by siefting some more earth about them; especially the Pines,
which being more top-heavy, are more apt to swag. When they are of two, or
three years growth, you may transplant them where you please; and when they
have gotten good root, they will make prodigious shoots; but not for the three,
or four first years comparatively. They will grow both in moist, or barren
Gravel, and poor ground, so it be not over sandy and light; but before sowing
(I mean here for large designs) turn it up a foot deep, sowing or setting your
Seeds an hand distance, and riddle Earth upon them; In five or six weeks they
will peep: When you transplant, water them well before, and cut the clod out
about the root as you do Melons out of the Hot-bed, which knead close to them
like an Egg: Thus they may be sent safely many miles, but the top must neither
be bruised, much less cut, which would dwarf it for ever.

3. The best time to transplant, were in the beginning of April; they would
thrive mainly in a stiff hungry Clay; but by no means in over light, or rich
Soil: Fill the holes therefore with such barren Earth, if your ground be
improper of it self; and if the Clay be too stiff and untractable, with a
little sand, removing with as much Earth about the roots as is possible, though
the Fir will better endure a naked transplantation, than the Pine: You may
likewise sow in such earth about February, they will make a shoot the very
first year of an Inch; next an handful, the third year three foot, and thence
forward, above a yard annually. A Northern Gentleman, who has obliged me with
this process upon his great Experience, assures me, that there are trees
planted in Northumberland, which are in few years grown to the magnitude of
Ship-masts; and from all has been said, deduces these Encouragements; 1. The
facility of their propagation, 2. The nature of their growth, which is to
affect places where nothing else will thrive: 3. Their uniformity and beauty,
4. Their perpetual Verdure; 5. Their sweetness, 6. Their Fruitfulness,
affording seed, gum, fuel, and timber of all other woods the most useful and
easy to work, etc. All which highly recommend it as an excellent Improvement of
Husbandry, fit to be enjoined by some solemn Edict to the Inhabitants of this
our Island, that we may have masts, and those other materials of our own growth.

4. The Pine (of which are reckoned no less then ten several sorts, preferring
the Domestic or Sative for the fuller growth) is likewise of both Sexes,
whereof the Male growing lower, has its wood more knotty and rude than the
Female. They would be gathered in June, before they gape, yet having hung two
years (for there will be always some ripe, and some green on the same Tree)
preserve them in their nuts, in Sand, as you treat Akorns, etc. 'till the
season invite, and then set, or sow them in Ground which is cultivated like the
Fir, in most respects; only you may bury the Nuts a little deeper. By a friend
of mine they were rolled in a fine compost made of Sheeps-dung, and scattered
in February, and this way never failed Fir and Pine; they came to be above Inch
high by May; and a Spanish Author tells us, that macerated five days in a child's
urine, and three days in water, is of wonderful effect; This were an
expeditious process for great Plantations; unless you would rather set the
Pine as they do Pease; but at wider distances, that when there is occasion of
removal, they might be taken up with earth and all, I say, taken up, and not
removed by Evulsion; because they are (of all other Trees) the most obnoxious
to miscarry without this caution; and therefore it were much better (where the
Nuts might be commodiously set, and defended) never to remove them at all, it
gives this Tree so considerable a check. The safest course of all, were to set
the Nuts in an Earthen-pot, and in frosty weather, showing it a little to the
fire, the entire Clod will come out with them, which are to be reserved, and
set in the naked Earth, in convenient and fit holes, so soon as the thaw is
universal: Some commend the strewing a few Oats at the bottom of the fosses or
pits in which you transplant the naked roots, for a great promotement of their
taking; and that it will cause them to shoot more in one year than in three;
but to this I have already spoken.

5. I am assured (by a person most worthy of credit) that in the Territory of
Alzey (a Country in Germany, where they were miserably distressed for Wood,
which they had so destroyed as that they were reduced to make use of Straw for
their best Fuel) a very large Tract being newly plowed, but the Wars
surprising them, not suffered to sow, there sprung up the next year a whole
Forest of Pine-trees, of which sort of Wood there was none at all within less
then fourscore miles; so as it is verily conjectured by some, they might be
wafted thither from the Country of Westrasia, which is the nearest part to that
where they grow: If this be true, we are no more to wonder, how, when our
Oak-woods are grubb'd up, Beech, and Trees of other kinds, have frequently
succeeded them: What some impetuous Winds have done in this nature, I could
produce instances almost miraculous: I shall say nothing of the opinion of our
Master Varro, and the learned Theophrastus, who were both of a faith, that the
seeds of Plants dropped out of the Air: Pliny in his 16. Book, Chap. 33. upon
discourse of the Cretan Cypress, attributes much to the indoles and nature of
the soil, virtue of the Climate, and Impressions of the Air: And indeed it is
very strange, what is affirmed of that Pitchy-rain, reported to have fallen
about Cyrene, the year 430. U. C. after which, in a short time, sprung up a
whole wood of the Trees of Laserpitium, producing a precious Gum not much
inferior to Benzoin, if at least the story be warrantable: But of these Aerial
irradiations, various conceptions, and aequivocal productions without seed,
etc. upon another occasion, if life and leisure permit me to finish what has
been long under the hand and file, to gratify our Horticultores; this present
Treatise being but an imperfect limb of that more ample Work.

6. In transplanting of these Coniferous Trees, which are generally
Resinaceous, viz. Fir, Pine, Larix, Cedar, and which have but thin and single
Roots, you must never diminish their heads, nor be at all busy with their
roots, which pierce deep, and is all their foundation, unless you find any of
them bruised, or much broken, therefore such downright Roots as you may be
forced to cut off, it were safe to sear with an hot Iron, and prevent the
danger of bleeding, to which they are obnoxious even to destruction, though
unseen and unheeded: Neither may you disbranch them, but with great caution, as
about March, or before, or else in September, and then it is best, to prune up
the side- branches close to the Trunk, cutting off all that are above a year
old; if you suffer them too long, they grow too big, and the cicatrice will be
more apt to spend the Tree in gum; upon which accident I advise you to rub
over their wounds with a mixture of Cow Dung; the neglect of this cost me dear,
so apt are they to spend their Gum. Some advise us to break the shells of Pines
to facilitate their delivery, and I have essayed it, but to my loss; Nature
does obstetricate, and do that office of her self, when it is the proper
season; neither does this preparation at all prevent those which are so buried,
whiles their hard Integuments, protect them both from rotting, and the Vermin.

7. The domestic Pine grows very well with us both in Mountains and Plains; but
the Pinaster or wilder (of which are four sorts) best for Walks, because it
grows tall, and proud, maintaining their Branches at the sides, which the Pine
does less frequently.

8. The Fir grows tallest, being planted reasonable close together; but suffers
nothing to thrive under them. The Pine not so Inhospitable; for (by Plinies
good leave) it may be sown with any Tree, all things growing well under its
shade, and excellent in Woods; hence Claudian, The friendly Pine the mighty Oak
invites.
Et comitem quercum Pinus amica trahit.


9. They both affect the cold, high, and rockie grounds, Abies in montibus
altis; yet will grow in better, but not in over rich, and pinguid. The worst
Land in Wales bears (as I am told) large Pine; and the Fir according to his
aspiring nature, loves also the Mountain more than the Valley; but (...), It
cannot endure the Shade, as Theophrastus observes, de Pl. l. 4. c. 1. But this
is not rigidly true; for they will grow in Consort, till they even shade, and
darken one another, and will also descend from the Hills, and succeed very
well, being desirous of plentiful waterings, till they arrive to some competent
stature; and therefore they do not prosper so well in an over sandy, and hungry
Soil, or gravel, as in the very entrails of the Rocks, which afford more drink
to the Roots, that penetrate into their meanders, and winding recesses. But
though they require this refreshing at first, yet do they perfectly abhor all
stercoration; nor will they much endure to have the earth opened about their
Roots for Ablaqueation, or be disturbed. This is also to be understood of
Cypress. A Fir for the first half dozen years seems to stand, or at least make
no considerable advance; but it is when thoroughly rooted, that it comes away
miraculously. That Honorable Knight Sir Norton Knatchbull (whose delicious
Plantation of Pines, and Firs I beheld with great satisfaction) having assured
me that a Fir Tree of his raising, did shoot no less than sixty foot in
height, in little more than twenty years, is a pregnant instance, as of the
speedy growing of that material; so of all the encouragement I have already
given for the more frequent cultivating this ornamental, useful, and profitable
Tree.

10. The Picea is another sort of Pine, Pitch.
and to be cultivated like it, the cold grounds which these Plants most affect,
though it be hard to discover, Yet sometimes Pitch-trees and the noxious Yew,
Or the dark Ivy will dire Symptoms show.
-- Piceae tantum, taxique nocentes
Interdum, aut ederae pandunt Vestigia nigrae.
Georg. 2. And therefore I am not satisfied why it might not prosper in some
tolerable degree in England, as well as in Germany, Russia, the Colder Tracts,
and abundantly in France: It grows on the Alps among the Pine, but neither so
tall nor so upright, and produces a Gum almost as white and firm as
Frankincense: But it is the Larix (another sort of Pine) that yields the
Venetian Turpentine.

11. There is also the Piceaster (a wilder sort) out of which the greatest
store of Pitch is boiled. The Teda likewise, which is a sort abounding in
Dalmatia, more unctious, and more patient of the warmer situations, and so
inflamable, that it will slit into Candles, and therefore some will by no means
admit it to be of a different Species, but a metamorphosis of overgrown
fattinesse, to which the most Judicious incline.

12. The Bodies of these being cut, or burnt down to the ground, will emit
frequent Suckers from the Roots; but so will neither the Pine nor Fir: But the
Fir may be propagated of Layers, which I divulge, as a considerable Secret that
has been essayed with success.

13. That all these, especially the Fir, and Pine, will prosper well with us is
more than probable, because it is a kind of Demonstration that they did
heretofore grow plentifully in Cumberland, Cheshire, Stafford, and Lancashire,
if the multitudes of these Trees to this day found entire, and buried under the
Earth, though supposed to have been or'ethrown and covered so ever since the
universal Deluge, be indeed of this Species: That incomparable Naturalist, the
Learned Dr. Merre^t, in his Pinax, speaks of several places of this Nation,
where subterraneous Trees are found; as namely, in Cornwall, ad finem terrae, in
agris Flints; in Penbrok-shire toward the shore, where they so abound, ut
totum littus (says the Doctor) tanquam Sylva caedua apparet; in Cheshire also,
as we said, Cumberland, and Anglesey, and several of our Euro-boreal tracts,
and are called Noahs-Ark. By Chatnesse in Lancashire (says Cambden) the low
Mossie ground was no very long time since, carried away by an impetuous flood,
and in that place now lies a low irriguous Vale, where many prostrate Trees
have been dug out: These Trees were (some think) carried away in times past
by some accident of Innundation, or by Waters undermining the ground, till
their own weight, and the Winds bowed them down and overwhelmed in the Mud: For
it is observed, that these Trees are no where found but in Boggie places; but
that the burning of these Trees so very bright, should be an Argument they were
Fir, is not necessary, since the Bitumineous quality of such Earth may have
imparted it to them; and Cambden denies them to be fir-trees, suggesting the
Querie; Whether there may not possibly grow Trees even under the Ground, as
well as other things? There are in Cumberland, on the Seashore, Trees
sometimes discovered at Low Water, and at other times that lie buried in the
Sand; and in other Mossie places of that Shire it is reported, the People
frequently dig up the Bodies of vast Trees without Boughs, and that by
direction of the Deaw alone in Summer; for they observe it never lies upon that
part, under which those Trees are interred. These particulars I find noted by
the Ingenious Author of the Britannia Baconica: But we shall enquire farther
concerning these Subterranean Productions anon, and whether the Earth, as well
as the Water, have not the virtue of strange Transmutations: These Trees are
found in Moors by poking with Staves of three or four foot length, shod with
Iron.

14. In Scotland (as we noted) there is a most beautiful sort of Fir growing
upon the Mountains; of which from the late Marquess of Argyle, I had sent me
some seeds, which I have sown with tolerable success; and I prefer them
before any other, because they grow both very erect, and fixing themselves
stoutly, need little or no support. And there near Loughbrun, 'twixt the Lough
and an Hill, they grow in such quantity; that from the spontaneous Fall, Ruin,
and Decay of the Trees lying cross one another to a Man's height, partly
covered with Moss, and partly Earth and Grass, which rots, fills up, and
grows again, a considerable Hill has in process of time been raised to almost
their very tops, which being an Accident of singular remark, I thought fit to
mention.

15. For the many, and almost universal use of these Trees, both Sea and Land
will plead, The useful Pine for Ships --
-- dant utile Lignum
Navigiis Pines --
Georg. 2. Hence Papinius 6. Thebaid. calls it audax abies. They make our best
Mast, Sheathing, Scaffold-poles, etc. heretofore the whole Vessel. It is pretty
(says Pliny) to consider, that those Trees which are so much sought after for
Shipping, should most delight in the highest of Mountains, as if it fled from
the Sea on purpose, and were afraid to descend into the Waters. With Fir we
likewise make all intestine works, as Wainscot, Floors, Pales, Balks, Laths,
Boxes, Bellies for all Musical Instruments in general, nay the Ribs and Sides
of that enormous Stratagem, the so famous Trojan Horse, may be thought to be
built of this Material, and if the Poet mistake not.

-- The Ribs with Deal they fit:
-- Sectaque intexunt Abiete costas.
Aen. 2. It is exceeding smooth to polish on, and therefore does well under
Gilding work, and takes black equal with the Pear Tree: Both Fir, and
especially Pine, succeed well in Carving, as for Capitols, Festoons, nay
Statues, especially being Gilded, because of the easiness of the Grain, to
work and take the Tool every way; and he that shall examine it nearly, will
find that famous Image of the B. Virgin at Loretto (reported to be Carved by
the hands of S. Luke) to be made of Fir, as the grain easily discovers it. The
Torulus (as Vitruvius calls it) and heart of Deal, kept dry, rejecting the
Albumen and white is everlasting; nor does there any Wood so well agree with
the glue, as it, or so easy to be wrought: It is also excellent for Beams, and
other Timber-work in Houses, being both light, and exceedingly strong, and
therefore of very good use for Bars and bolts of Doors, as well as for Doors
themselves, by reason of a natural Spring which it has, not easily violated:
You shall find, that of old they made Carts, and Coaches of it: For Scaffolding
also there is none comparable to it; and I am sure we find it an extraordinary
saver of Oak where it may be had at reasonable price. I will not complain what
an incredible mass of ready Money is yearly exported into the Northern
Countries for this sole Commodity, which might all be saved were we industrious
at home. Likewise from Fir we have the most of our Potashes: Of Fir are made
our Torch or Funebral-staves; nay, and of old, Spears of it, if we may credit
Virgil's Amazonian Combat, -- She pressed
A long Fir Spear through his exposed Breast.
-- Cujus apertum
Adversi longa transverberat abiete pectus.
Aen. 11. Lastly, the very Chips, or Shavings of Deal-boards, are of other use
than to kindle Fires alone: Thomas Bartholinus in his Medicina Danorum Dissert.
7. etc. where he disclaims the use of Hops in Beer, as pernicious and
malignant, and from several instances how apt it is to produce and usher in
Infections, nay, Plagues, etc. would substitute in its place, the Shavings of
Deal-boards, as he affirms, to give a grateful odor to the Drink; and how
soverain those resinous woods, the Tops of Fir and Pines, are against the
Scorbut, we generally find: It is in the same Chapter that he commends also
Wormwood, Marrubium, Chamelaeagnum, Sage, Tamarisc, and almost any thing rather
than Hopps. The Pine, or Picea buried in the Earth never decay: From the latter
transudes a very bright and pellucid Gum; hence we have likewise Rosin; also of
the Pine are made Boxes, and Barrels for dry Goods; yea, and it is cloven into
Shingles for the covering of Houses in some places; also Hoops for
Wine-Vessels, especially, of the easily flexible Wild-Pine; not to forget the
Kernels (this Tree being always furnished with Cones, some ripe, others green)
of such admirable use in Emulsion, and the Tooth-pickers for which even the
very leaves are commended: In sum, they are Plantations which exceedingly
improve the Air by their oderiferous, and balsamical emissions, and for
ornament, create a perpetual Spring where they are plentifully propagated. And
if it could be proved that the Almugim-trees, Recorded 1 Reg. 10.12. and
whereof Pillars for that famous Temple, and the Royal Palace, Harps, and
Psalteries, etc. were made, were of this sort of Wood (as some doubt not to
assert) we should esteem it at another rate; yet we know Josephus affirms they
were a kind of Pine Tree, though somewhat resembling the Fig Tree wood to
appearance, as of a most lustrious Candor. In the 2 Chronicles. 2.8. there is
mention of Almug-trees to grow in Lebanon; and if so, methinks it should rather
be a kind of Cedar; (yet we find Firr also in the same period) for we have seen
a whiter sort of it, even very white as well as red; though some affirm it to
be but the Sap of it (so our Cabinet-makers call it) I say, their were both Fir
and Pine-trees also growing upon those Mountains. Mr. Purchase informs us, that
Dr. Dee Writ a laborious Treatise almost wholly of this Subject (but I could
never have the good hap to see it) wherein, as Commissioner for Solomon's
Timber, and like a Learned Architect, and Planter, he has summoned a Jury of
twelve sorts of Trees. namely, 1. the Fir, 2. Box, 3. Cedar, 4. Cypress, 5.
Ebony, 6. Ash, 7. Juniper, 8. Larch, 9. Olive, 10. Pine, 11. Oak, and 12.
Sandal-trees, to examine which of them were this Almugim, and at last seems to
concur with Josephus, in favor of Pine or Fir; who possibly from some ancient
Record, or fragment of the Wood it self, might learn something of it; and it is
believed, that it was some material both odoriferous to the Sent, and beautiful
to the Eye, and of fittest temper to refract Sounds; besides its
serviceablenesse for Building, all which Properties are in the best sort of
Pine or Thyina, as Pliny calls it; or perhaps some other rare Wood, of which
the Eastern Indias are doubtless the best provided; and yet I find, that these
vast beams which sustained the Roof of S. Peter's Church at Rome, laid (as
reported) by Constantine the Great, were made of the Pitch tree, and have
lasted from Anno 336. down to our days, above 1300. years.

16. But now whiles I am reciting the Uses of these beneficial Trees, Mr.
Winthorp presents the Royal Society with the Process of making the Tar and
Pitch in New England, which we thus abbreviate. Tar is made out of that sort of
Pine Tree from which natually Turpentine extilleth; and which at its first
flowing out is liquid and clear; but being hardened by the Air, either on the
Tree, or wherever it falls, is not much unlike the Burgundy Pitch; and we
call them Pitch pines out of which this gummy substance transudes: They grow
upon the most barren Plains, on Rocks also and Hills rising amongst those
Plains, where several are found blown down, that have lain so many Ages, as
that the whole Bodies, Branches and Roots of the Trees being perished, some
certain knots only of the Boughs have been left remaining entire (these knots
are that part where the bough is joined to the body of the Tree) lying at the
same distance and posture as they grevv upon the Tree for its whole length.
The Bodies of some of these Trees are not corrupted through age, but quite
consumed and reduced to ashes, by the annual burnings of the Indians, when they
set their grounds on fire; which yet has, it seems, no power over these hard
knots, beyond a black scorching; although being laid on heaps, they are apt
enough to burn. It is of these knots they make their Tar in New England and the
Country adjacent, whiles they are well impregnated with that Terebinthine, and
Resinous ^atter, which like a Balsam preserves them so long from putrefaction.
The rest of the Tree does indeed contain the like Terebinthine Sap, as appears
(upon any slight incision of bark on the stem, or boughs) by a small crystaline
pearl which will sweat out; but this, for being more watery, and undigested by
reason of the porosity of the Wood, which exposes it to the impressions of the
Air and Wet, renders the Tree more obnoxious; especially, if it lie prostrate
with the bark on, which is a receptacle for a certain Intercutaneous Worm, that
accelerates its decay. They are the knots then alone which the Tar-makers amass
in heaps, carrying them in Carts to some convenient place not far off, where
finding Clay, or Loam fit for their turn, they lay an Hearth of such ordinary
stone as they have at hand: This they build to such an height from the level of
the ground, that a Vessel may stand a little lower then the Hearth, to receive
the Tar as it runs out: But first, the Hearth is made wide according to the
quantity of knots to be set at once, and that with a very smooth floor of Clay,
yet somewhat descending, or dripping from the extreme parts to the middle, and
thence toward one of the sides, where a gullet is left for the Tar to run out
at. The Hearth thus finished, they pile the knots one upon another, after the
very same manner as our Colliers do their wood for Char-coal; and of a height
proportionable to the breadth of the Hearth; and then cover them over with a
coat of loam or clay (which is best) or in defect of those, with the best, and
most tenacious Earth the place will afford; leaving only a small spiracle at
the top, whereat to put the fire in; and making some little holes round about
at several heights, for the admission of so much air as is requisite to keep it
burning, and to regulate the fire by opening, and stopping them at pleasure.
The process is almost the the same with that of making Char^coal, as will
appear in due place; for when it is well on fire, that middle hole is also
stopped, and the rest of the Registers so governed, as the knots may keep
burning and not be suffocated with too much smoke, whiles all being now through
heated, the Tar runs down to the Hearth, together with some of the more watery
Sap, which hasting from all parts toward the middle, is conveyed by the
forementioned gutter into the Barrel, or Vessel placed to receive it: Thus,
the whole Art of Tarmaking is no other, than a kind of rude distillation per
descensum, and might therefore be as well done in Furnaces of large capacity,
were it worth the expense. When the Tar is now all melted out, and run, they
stop up all the vents very close; and afterward find the knots made into
excellent Char-coal, preferred by the Smiths before any other whatsoever which
is made of wood; and nothing so apt to burn out when their blast cease;
neither do they sparkle in the fire, as many other sorts of Coal do; so as, in
defect of Sea-coal, they make choice of this as best for their use, and give
greater prices for it. Of these knots likewise do the Planters split out small
slivers about the thickness of one's finger, or somewhat thinner, which serve
them to burn in stead of Candles; giving a very good light. This they call
Candle-wood, and it is in much use both in New England, Virginia, and amongst
the Dutch planters in their Villages; but for that it is something offensive,
by reason of the much fuliginous smoke which comes from it, they commonly burn
it in the chimney-corner upon a flat stone or Iron; except, occasionally, they
carry a single stick in their hand, as there is need of light to go about the
house. It must not be conceived, by what we have mentioned in the former
description of the knots, that they are only to be separated from the bodies of
the trees by devouring time, or that they are the only materials out of which
Tar can be extracted: For there are in these Tracts millions of Trees which
abound with the same sort of knots, and full of Turpentine fit to make Tar: But
the labor of felling these Trees, and of cutting out their knots, would far
exceed the value of the Tar; especially in Countries where Workmen are so very
dear: But those knots above mentioned, are provided to hand, without any other
labor then the gathering only. There are sometimes found of those sort of
Pine-trees the lowest part of whose stems toward the root is as full of
Turpentine as the knots; and of these also may Tar be made: but such Trees
being rarely found, are commonly preserved to split into Candle-wood; because
they will be easily riven out into any lengths, and scantlings desired, much
better then the knots. There be who pretend an art of as fully impregnating the
body of any living Pine Tree for six or eight foot high; and some have reported
that such an art is practiced in Norway: But upon several experiments, by
girdling the Tree (as they call it) and cutting some of the bark round, and a
little into the wood of the Tree, six or eight foot distant from the ground, it
has yet never succeeded; whether the just season of the year were not observed,
or what else omitted, were worth the disquisition; if at least there be any
such secret amongst the Norwegians, Swedes, or any other Nation. Of Tar, by
boiling it to a sufficient height, is Pitch made: and in some places where
Rosin is plentiful, a fit proportion of that may be dissolved in the Tar whiles
it is boiling, and this mixture is soonest converted to Pitch; but it is of
somewhat a differing kind from that which is made of Tar only, without other
composition. There is a way which some Ship-Carpenters in those Countries have
used, to bring their Tar into Pitch for any sudden use; by making the Tar so
very hot in an Iron-kettle, that it will easily take fire, which when blazing,
and set in an airy place, they let burn so long, till, by taking out some small
quantity for trial, being cold, it appears of a sufficient consistence: Then by
covering the Kettle close, the fire is extinguished, and the Pitch is made
without more ceremony. There is a process of making Rosin also out of the same
knots, by splitting them out into thin pieces, and then boiling them in water,
which will educe all the Resinous matter, and gather it into a body which (when
cold) will harden into pure Rosin. It is moreover to be understood, that the
Fir and most Coniferous Trees, yield the same Concretes, Lachrymae,
Turpentines, Rosins, Hard, Naval or stone and liquid Pitch and Tar for
innumerable uses; and from the burning, and fuliginous vapor of these,
especially, the Rosin, we have our Lamp and Printers black, etc. I am persuaded
the Pine, and Fir trees in Scotland, might yield his Majesty plenty of
excellent Tar, were some industrious Person employed about the work.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Larch, Platanus, Lotus, Cornus, etc.
1. LArix, though of the Coniferous family, looses its leaf, Larch.
and therefore we separate him from the Firs and Pines; but why we might not
hope as well of the Larch as from any of them I know not: I read of Beams of no
less then 120. foot in length made out of this goodly Tree, which is of so
strange a composition, that 'twill hardly burn, as Caesar found in a Castle he
besieged built of it; (the story is recited at large by Vitruvius l. 2. c. 9.)
but see what Philander says upon the place, on his own experience: yet the
Coals thereof were held far better then any other for the melting of Iron.
There is abundance of this Larch timber in the Buildings at Venice, especially
about the Palaces in Piazza San Marco, where I remember Scmozzi says he himself
used much of it, and infinitely commends it: Tiberius we find built that famous
Bridge to his Naumachia with it; and it seems to excel for Beams, Doors,
Windoes, and will support an incredible Weight; which (and for its property of
long refecting fire) makes Vitruvius wish they had greater plenty of it at Rome
to make Goists of. From this Tree it is that useful Drug Agaric is gathered;
and the timber of it is so exceedingly transparant, that Cabanes made of the
thin boards, when in the dark night, they have lighted candles, people, who are
at a distance without doors, would imagine the whole room to be on fire, which
is pretty odd, considering there is no material so unapt to kindle. That which
now grows some where about Chelnsford in Essex, arrived to a flourishing, and
ample Tree, does sufficiently reproach our negligence and want of industry, as
well as the incomparable and shady.

Platanus*
2. Platanus, that so beautiful and precious Tree, so doated on by Xerxes, that
Aelian and other Authors tell us he made halt, and stopped his prodigious Army
of seventeen hundred thousand soldiers which even covered the Sea, exhausted
Rivers, and thrust Mount Athos from the Continent, to admire the pulchritude
and procerity of one of these goodly Trees, and became so fond of it, that
spoiling both himself, his Concubines, and great Persons of all their jewels,
he covered it with Gold, Gems, Neck-laces, Scarfs and Bracelets, and infinite
riches; In sum, was so enamored of it, that for some days neither the
concernment of his grand Expedition, nor interest of honor, nor the necessary
motion of his portentous Army, could persuade him from it: He styled it his
Mistress, his Minion, his Goddess; and when he was forced to part from it, he
caused the figure of it to be stamped in a Medail of Gold, which he continually
wore about him. These Trees the Romans first brought out of the Levant, and
cultivated with so much industry and cost, for its stately and proud head only;
Mac^ob. Saturnal. 3.
that great Orators and Statesmen, Cicero and Hortensius would exchange now
and then a turn at the Bar, that they might have the pleasure ^o step to their
Villas, and refresh their Platans, which they would often irrigate with Wine
instead of Water; and so prized the very shadow of it, that when afterward
they transplanted them into France, they exacted a Tribute of any of the
Natives who should presume but to put his head under it. Pliny tells us there
is no Tree whatsoever which so well defends us from the heat of the Sun in
Summer; nor that admits it more kindly in Winter. And for our encouragement, I
do upon experience assure you, that they will flourish and abide with us,
without any more trouble than frequent, and plentiful Watering, which from
their youth they excessively delight in, and gratefully acknowledge by their
growth accordingly; so as I am persuaded, that with very ordinary Industry,
they might be propagated to the incredible Ornament of the Walks and Avenues to
Great-mens houses. The Introduction of this true Plane amongst us, is due to
that honorable Gentleman Sir Geo. Crook of Oxfordshire, from whose bounty I
received an hopeful plant now growing in my Villa.

3. There was lately at Basil in Switzerland an ancient goodly Platanetum, and
now in France they are come again in vogue: I know it was anciently accounted
(...); but they may with us be raised of their seeds with care, in a moist
soil, as here I have known them: But the reason of our little success, is, that
we very rarely have them sent us ripe; which should be gathered late in Autumn,
and brought us from some more Levantine parts than Italy. They come also of
Layers abundantly; affecting a fresh and feeding ground; for so they plant them
about their Rivulets, and Fountains. The West-Indian Plane is not altogether so
rare, but it rises to a goodly Tree, and bears a very ample, and less jaged
leaf: That the Turks use their Platanus for the building of Ships, I learn out
of Ricciolus Hydrog. l. 10. c. 37.

Lotus.
4. The same opinion have I of the noble Lotus, (another lover of the Water)
which in Italy yields both an admirable shade, and Timber immortal. Of this
Wood are made Pipes and Wind-Instruments, and of its Root, Hafts for knives,
and other Tools, etc. The offer of Crassus to Domitius for half a dozen of
these Trees growing about an house of his in Rome, testifies in what esteem
they were had for their incomparable beauty and use. The Cornel-tree, Cor^u^.
though not mentioned by Pliny for its Timber, is exceedingly commended for
its durablenesse, and use in Wheel-work, Pinns, and Wedges, in which it lasts
like the hardest Iron; and it will grow with us to good bulk and stature; and
the preserved, and pickled berries, are most refreshing, and an excellent
condiment.

CHAP. XXIV. Of the Cypress-tree and Cedar.
CVpressus, the Cypresse-Tree, is either the Sative or Garden tree, Cypress.
the most pyramidal and beautiful; or that which is called the Male, (though
somewhat prepostrously) which bears the Cones, but is of a more extravagant
shape: should we reason only from our common experience, even the Cypresse-tree
was, but within a few years past, reputed so tender, and nice a Plant, that it
was cultivated with the greatest care, and to be found only amongst the
Curious; whereas we see it now, in every Garden, rising to as goodly a bulk and
stature, as most which you shall find even in Italy it self; for such I
remember to have once seen in his late Majesty's Gardens at Theobalds, before
that Princely seat was demolished. I say, if we did argue from this Topic:
Methinks it should rather encourage our Countrymen to add yet to their
Plantations other Foreign and useful Trees, and not in the least deter them,
because many of them are not as yet become endenizon'd amongst us.

2. We may read that the Peach was at first accounted so tender and delicate a
Tree, as that it was believed to thrive only in Persia; and even in the days of
Galen, it grew no nearer then Egypt, of all the Roman Provinces, but was not
seen in the City till more then thirty years before Pliny's time; whereas there
is now hardly a more common and universal in Europe: Thus likewise, the
Avellana from Pontus in Asia; Thence into Greece, and so Italy, to the City of
Abellino in Campania.

Vna tantum litera immutata, Avellina dici, quae prius Abellina. I might affirm
the same of our Damasco Plum, Quince, Medlar, Figue, and most ordinary Pears,
as well as of several other Peregrine Trees, Fruit-bearers, and others; For
even the very Damask-rose it self, (as my Lord Bacon tells us Cent. 2. Exp.
659.) is little more than an hundred years old in England: Methinks this should
be of wonderful incitement. It was 680 years after the foundation of Rome, ere
Italy had tasted a Cherry of their own, which being then brought thither out of
Pontus (as the abovementioned Filberts were) did afterward travel ad ultimos
Britannos.

3. Josephus tells us, That the Cedar in Judea was first planted there by
Solomon, who doubtless tried many rare Experiments of this nature; and none
more Kingly then that of Planting to Posterity. I do not speak of those which
grow on the Mountains of Libanus, In Itinerario.
in the colder and Northern tracts of Syria: But as I am informed by that
curious Traveller, Ranwolfius. i. Since also confirmed by that Virtuoso
Monsieur Monconys, there remaining now not above twenty four of those stately
Trees in all those goodly Forests, where that mighty Prince set fourscore
thousand Hewers at work for the Materials of one only Temple and a Palace,
it is a pregnant Example what Time, and Neglect will bring to ruin, if due, and
continual care be not taken to propagate Timber.

4. Nor is it any wonder if we find the whole Species of some Trees so totally
lost in a Country, as if there had never been any such planted in it: Be this
therefore applied to Fir, Pine, and many others with us; since it was so long
ere Rome was acquainted with them, or indeed with any of the Pitch-bearers.

5. We had our first Myrtils out of Greece, and Cypress from Creete, which was
yet a mere stranger in Italy, as Pliny reports, and most difficult to be
raised; which made Cato to write more concerning the culture of it then of any
other Tree: Notwithstanding we have in this Country of ours, no less then
three sorts, which are all of them easily propagated, and prosper very well if
they are rightly ordered; and therefore I shall not omit to disclose one
secret, as well to confute a popular Error, as for the Instruction of our
Gardeners.

6. The Tradition is, That the Cypress (being a Symbol of Mortality, they
should say of the contrary) is never to be cut for fear of killing it. This
makes them to impale, and wind them about like so many Egyptian Mummies; by
which means the inward parts of the Tree being heated, for want of Air and
Refreshment, it never arrives to any perfection, but is exceedingly
troublesome, and chargeable to maintain; whereas indeed, there is not a more
tonsile and governable Plant in nature; For the Cypress may be cut to the very
Roots, and yet spring afresh: And this we find was the husbandry in the Isle of
Aenaria, where they used to fell it for Copse: For the Cypress being raised
from the Nursery of Seeds sown in September (or rather March,) and within two
years after transplanted, should at two years standing more, have the master
stem of the middle shaft cut off some hand-breadth below the summit, the sides,
and smaller sprigs shorn into a conique or pyramidal form, and so kept clipped
from April to September, as often as there is occasion; and by this Regiment they
will grow furnished to the foot, and become the most beautiful Trees in the
world, without binding or stake; still remembering to abate the middle stem, and
to bring up the collateral branches in its stead to what altitude you please;
but when I speak of shortning the middle shoot, I do not intend the dwarfing of
it, and therefore it must be done discreetly, so as it may not over-hastily
advance, till the foot thereof be perfectly furnished: But there is likewise
another, no less commendable expedient, to dress this Tree with all the
former advantages; if sparing the shaft altogether, you diligently cut away all
the forked branches, reserving only such as radiate directly from the body,
which being shorn, and clipped in due season, will render the Tree very
beautiful; and though more subject to obey the shaking winds, yet the natural
spring of it, does immediately redress it, without the least discomposure; and
this is a secret worth the learning of Gardeners, who subject themselves to the
trouble of stakes and binding, which is very inconvenient. Thus likewise may
you form them into Hedges and Topiary works, or by sowing the Seeds in a
shallow furrow, and plucking up the Supernumeraries where they come too close
and thick: For in this work it shall suffice to leave them within a foot of
each other; and when they are risen about a yard in height (which may be to the
half of your Palisado) cut off their tops, as you are taught, and keep the
sides clipp^d, that they ascend but by degrees, and thicken at the bottom as
they climb. Thus, they will present you in half a dozen or eight years, with
incomparable hedges, preferable to all others whatsoever, because they are
perpetually green and able to resist the Winds better then any which I know,
the Holly only excepted, which indeed has no peer.

7. When I say Winds, I mean their fiercest gusts, not their cold: For though
it be said, Brumaque illaesa Cupressus, and that indeed no frost impeaches them
(for they grow even on the snowy tops of Ida,) yet our cruel Eastern winds do
sometimes mortally invade them which have been late clipped, seldom the
untouched, or that were dressed in the Spring only: The effects of the late
March and April Winds (in the years 1663. and 1665.) accompanied with cruel
Frosts and cold blasts, for the space of more then two months night and day,
did not amongst near a thousand Cypresses (growing in my Garden) kill above
three or four, which for being very late cut to the quick (that is, the latter
end of October) were raw of their wounds, took cold, and gangreen'd; some few
others which were a little smitten toward the tops, might have escaped all
their blemishes, had my Gardener capp'd them but with a wisp of hay or straw,
as in my absence, I commanded. As for the frost of those Winters (then which I
believe there was never known a more cruel and deadly piercing since England
had a name) it did not touch a Cypress of mine till it joined forces with that
destructive Wind: Therefore for caution, clip not your Cypresses late in
Autumn, and cloth them (if young) against these winds; for the frosts they
only discolor them, but seldom, or never hurt them, as by long experience I
have found.

8. If you affect to see your Cypress in Standard, and grow wild (which may in
time come to be of a large substance, fit for the most immortal of Timber)
plant of the reputed Male sort; it is a Tree which will prosper wonderfully;
and where the ground is hot, and gravelly, though (as we said) he be nothing
so beautiful; and it is of this, that the Venetians make their greatest profit.

9. There is likewise the Tarentine Cypress, so much celebrated by Cato; I do
not mean our Savine, (which some erroneously take for it, though there be a
Berry-bearing Savine, much resembling the Cypress, which comes to prove a
gallant, upright Tree, fit for the Standard.) Both that, and the Milesian, are
worthy our culture.

10. I have already showed how this Tree is to be raised from the seed; but
there was another Method amongst the Ancients, who (as I told you) were wont to
make great Plantations of them for their Timber: I have practiced it my self,
and therefore describe it.

11. If you receive your seed in the Nuts which uses to be gathered thrice a
year, (but seldom ripening with us) expose them to the Sun till they gape, or
near a gentle fire, or put them in warm water, by which means the seeds will
be easily shaken out; for if you have them open before, they do not yield you
half their crop. About the beginning of April (or before, if the weather be
showery) prepare an even Bed, which being made of fine earth, clap down with
your Spade, as Gardeners do for Purselain-seed: of old they rolled it with some
Stone or Cylinder) Upon this strew your seeds pretty thick; then sieft over
them some more mould somewhat better than half an inch in height: keep them
duly watered after Sunset, unless the season do it for you; and after one
years growth (for they will be an inch high in little more than a Month) you
may transplant them where you please. In watering them, I give you this caution
(which may also serve you for most tender and delicate seeds) that you deaw
them rather with a broom or spergatory, then hazard the beating them out with
the common watering-pot; and when they are well come up, be but sparing of
water: Be sure likewise that you cleanse them when the weeds are very young and
tender, least in stead of purging, you quite erradicate your Cypress: We have
spoken of Watering, and indeed whilst young, if well followed, they will make a
prodigious advance: when that long, and incomparable walk of Cypress at
Frascati near Rome was first planted, they drew a small stream (and indeed
Irrigare is properly thus, aquam inducere riguis (i.e.) in small gutters and
rills) by the foot of it, (as the Water there is in abundance tractable) and
made it arrive to seven or eight foot height in one year; but with us, we may
not be too prodigal; since, being once well taken, they thrive best in our
sandy, light, and warmest grounds, whence Cardan says, juxta aquas arescit,
meaning in low and moorish places, stiff and cold earth, etc. where they never
thrive.

12. What the Uses of this Timber are, for Chests and other Vtensils, Harps,
and diverse other Musical Instruments (it being a very sonorous wood, and
therefore employed for Organ-pipes, as heretofore for supporters of Vines,
Poles, Rails, and Planks, (resisting the Worm, Moth, and all putrefaction to
eternity) the Venetians sufficiently understand; who did every twenty year, and
oftener (the Romans every thirteen) make a considerable Revenue of it out of
Candy: And certainly a very gainful commodity it was, when the Fell of a
Cupressetum was heretofore reputed a good Daughters Portion, and the Plantation
it self called Dotem filiae. But there was in Candy a vast Wood of these Trees
belonging to the Republique, by malice or accident set on Fire, which Anno
1400. burnt for seven years continually, before it could be quite extinguished;
fed so long a space by the unctuous nature of the Timber, of which there were
to be seen at Venice planks of above four foot in breadth; and formerly the
Valves of Saint Peter's Church at Rome were framed of this Material, which
lasted from the great Constantine to Pope Eugenius the Fourths time, almost six
hundred years; and then were found as fresh and entire as if they had been new:
But this Pope would needs change them for Gates of Brass, which were cast by
the famous Antonio Philarete; not in my opinion so venerable as those other of
Cypress. It was in Coffins of this material, that Thycidides tells us, the
Athenians used to bury their Heroes.

13. The Timber of this wood was of infinite esteem with the Ancients: That
lasting Bridge built over the Euphrates by Semiramis was made of this wood; and
it is reported, Plato chose it to Write his Laws in before Brass it self, for
the diuturnity of the matter: It is certain, that it never rifts or cleaves,
but with great violence; and the bitterness of its juice preserves it from all
Worms, and putrefaction. To this day those of Creet, and Malta make use of it
for their Buildings; because they have it in plenty, and there is nothing
out-lasts it, or can be more beautiful, especially than the Root of the wilder
sort, incomparable for its crisped undulations. Diverse Learned Persons have
conceived the Gopher mentioned in holy Writ, Genesis 6.14. and of which the Ark
was built, to have been no other than this (...), Cupar or Cuper, by the easy
mutation of Letters; and beside, it is known that in Creet they employed it for
the same use in the largest contignations, and did formerly build Ships of it:
And Epiphanius Haeres. l. 1. tells us, some Relics of that Ark lasted even to
his days, and was judged to have been of Cypress. Some indeed suppose that
Copher was the Name of a Place a Cupressis, as Elon a Quercubus; and might
possibly be that which Strabo calls Cupressetum near Adiabens in Assyria: But
for the reason of its long lasting, Coffins, as noted, for the dead were made
of it, and thence it first became to be Diti Sacra; and the Valves or Doors of
the Ephesine Temple were likewise of it, as we observed but now were those of
St. Peter's at Rome: Works of Cypress wood, permanent ad diuturnitatem, says
Vitruvius l. 2. and the Poet -- perpetua nunquam moritura Cupresso.

Mart. E. 6.6.

But to resume the disquisition, whether it be truly so proper for Shipping is
controverted, though we also find in Cassiodorus Vor. l. 5. Ep. 16. that
Theodoric caused store of it to be provided for that purpose; and Plato (who we
told you made Laws and Titles to be Engraven in it) nominates it inter Arbores
(...) utilis. l. 4. leg. and so does Diodorus l. 19. And as Travelers observe,
there is no other sort of Timber fit for Shipping, so frequent as this Tree
about those parts of Assyria, where the Ark is conjectured to have been built;
so as those vast Armadas that Alexander the Great caused to be Equipped and set
out from Babylon, consisted only of Cypress, as we learn out of Arrian in
Alex. l. 7. and Strabo l. 16. Paulus Colamenus in his (...) literaria cap. 24.
perstringes the most Learned Is. Vossius, that in his Vindiciae pro LXX.
Interp. he affirms Cypress not fit for Ships: But besides what we have
produced, Fuller, Bochartus, etc. Lilius Gyraldus (lib. de Navig. c. 4.) and
diverse others, sufficiently evince it, and that the Vessel built by Trajan was
of that material; lasting incorrupt near 1400 years, when it was afterward
found in a certain Lake; if it were not rather (as I suspect) that which Aeneas
Silvius reports to have been discovered in his time, lying under Water in the
Numician Lake, crusted over with a certain feruginous mixture of Earth and
Scales, as if it had been of Iron; but it was pronounced to be Larix, and not
Cypress, employed by Tiberius. Finally (not to forget even the very chips of
this precious wood, which gives that flavor to Muscadines and other rich
Wines) I commend it for the improvement of the Air, and a specific for the
Lungs, as sending forth most sweet, and aromatic emissions, when ever it is
either clipped, or handled, and the chips, or cones being burnt, extinguishes
Moths, and expells the Gnats and Flies, etc. not omitting the Gum which it
yields, not much inferior to the Terbintine or Lentisc. But, Quid tibi odorato
referam sudantia ligno, if I forget

14. The Cedar? which grows in all extremes: In the moist Barbados, the hot
Bermudas, the cold New England; even where the Snow lies as (I am assured)
almost half the year: Why then it should not thrive in Old England, I conceive
is from our want of industry: It grows in the Bogs of America, and in the
Mountains of Asia; it seems there is no place affrights it; I have frequently
raised it of the Seeds, which I set like the Bay Berries; and we might have of
the very best kind in the World from the Summer Islands, though now almost
utterly exhausted there also, and so the most incomparable of that sacred wood
like to be quite destroyed by our negligence, which is by nature almost eternal.

15. Thus I read that in the Temple of Apollo at Vtica, there was found Timber
of near two thousand years old; and in Sagunti of Spain a Beam in a certain
Oratory consecrated to Diana, which had been brought from Zant two hundred
years before the Destruction of Troy.

16. And here I cannot omit my Wishes, that since this precious material may be
had at such tolerable rates, as certainly it might from Cape Florida, the
Bermudas, and other parts of the West Indias: I say, I cannot but suggest, that
our more Wealthy Citizens of London, now Building, might be encouraged to use
of it in their Shops; at least for Shelves, Comptoires, Chests, Tables,
Wainscot, etc. It might be done with moderate Expense, especially, in some
small proportions, and in Faneering, as they term it, and mouldings, since
beside the everlastingnesse of the wood not obnoxious to the Worms, and which
would also be a means to preserve cloth, and other Ware from Moths and
corruption; it would likewise be a Cure to reform the Malignity and
corrosivenesse of the Air, and even preserve the whole City as if it stood
amongst the Spices of the happy Arabia, or the prospects of Mount Libanus.
Note, that the Cedar is of so dry a nature, that it will not well endure to be
fastened with Nails, from which it usually shrinks, and therefore pinns of the
same wood, are better.

17. The Sittim mentioned in holy Writ, is believed to have been a kind of
Cedar, of which the most precious Vtensils were formed; so that when they said
a thing was cedro digna, the meaning was, worthy of eternity.

CHAP. XXV. Of the Cork, Ilex, Alaternus, Phyllyrea, Granad, Lentisc, Myrtle,
Jasmine, etc.
Cork.
1. THe Cork [Suber] of which there are two sorts (and diverse more in the
Indias) one of a narrower less jagged leaf and perenneal; the other of a
broader, falling in Winter; grows in the coldest parts of Biscany, in the North
of New England, in the South-West of France, especially the second Species,
fittest for our Climate; and in all sorts of ground, dry Heaths, Stony, and
Rockie-Mountains, so as the Roots will run even above the Earth where they have
little to cover them; all which considered, methinks we should not despair: We
have said where they grow plentifully in France; but by Pliny, Not. Hist. l.
16. c. 8. it should seem they were since transplanted thither; for he affirms
there were none either there or in Italy, in his time: But I exceedingly wonder
that Carolus Stephanus, and Crusius should write so peremptorily, that there
were none in Italy, where I my self have traveled through vast Woods of them
about Pisa, Aquin, and in diverse tracts between Rome and the Kingdom of Naples.
The Spanish Cork is a species of the Enzina, differing chiefly in the Leaf,
which is not so prickly; and in the bark, which is frequently, four or five
inches thick: The manner of decortication whereof is once in two, or three
years to strip it in a dry season; otherwise, the intercutaneous moisture
indangers the Tree; when the bark is off, they unwarp it before the fire, and
press it even, and that with weights upon the unequal part, and so it continues
being cold.

2. The uses of Cork is well known amongst us both at Sea and Land for its
resisting both Water and Air: The Fishermen who deal in Nets, and all who deal
with Liquors cannot be without it: Ancient Persons prefer it before Leather for
the soles of their Shoes, being light, dry, and resisting moisture, whence the
Germans name it Pantoffel-holts (Slipper-wood) perhaps from the Greek (...) and
(...), for I find it first applied to that purpose by the Grecian Ladies,
whence they were called light-footed; I know not whether the Epithet do still
belong to that Sex; but from them its likely the Venetian Dames took it up for
their monstrous Choppines; affecting, or usurping an artificial eminency above
Men, which Nature has denied them. Of one of the sorts of Cork are made pretty
Cups, and other Vessels, esteemed good to drink out of for Hectical persons:
The Egyptians made their Coffins of it, which being lined with a r^sinous
composition, preserved their Dead incorrupt: The poor People in Spain lay broad
Planks of it by their Beds-side, to tread on (as great Persons use Turkey and
Persian Carpets) to defend them from the floor, and sometimes they line, or
Wainscot the Walls, and inside of their Houses built of Stone, with this Bark,
which renders them very warm, and corrects the moisture of the Air: Also they
employ it for Bee-Hives, and to double the insides of their Contemplores, and
leather Cases wherein they put Flasquera's with Snow to refrigerate their Wine.
This Tree has beneath the Cortex or Cork, two other Coats, or Libri, of which
one is reddish, which they strip from the bole when it is felled only; and this
bears good price with the Tanner: The rest of the wood is very good firing, and
applicable to many other uses of Building; Palisade work, etc.

Ilex.
3. Ilex major glandifera or great Scarlet Oak, thrives manifestly with us;
witness His Majesty's Privy Garden at White Hall, where once flourished a
goodly Tree of more than fourscore years growth, though there be now but a
sickly Impe of it remaining.

4. By what I have touched in the Chapter of the Elms, concerning the
peregrination of that Tree into Spain (where even in Plinie's time there were
none, and where now they are in great abundance) why should we not more
generally endeavor to propagate the Ilex amongst us; I mean, that Baccifera,
which the Spaniards call the Enzina, and of which they have such Woods, and
profitable Plantations? They are an hardy sort of Tree, and familiarly raised
from the Acorn, if we could have them sound and well put up in Earth or Sand,
as I have found by experience.

5. The wood of these Ilex's is serviceable for many uses, as stocks of Tools,
Mallet-heads, Mall-balls, Chairs, Axeltrees, Wedges Beetles, Pins, and above
all for Palisadoes used in Fortifications. Besides, it affords so good fuel,
that it supplies all Spain almost with the best and most lasting of Charcoales,
in vast abundance. Of the first kind is made the Paynten Lac extracted from the
berries; to speak nothing of that noble Confection Alkermes: The Acorns of the
first yield excellent nourishment for Rustics, sweet, and little, if at all,
inferior to the Chesse-nut; and this, and not the Fagus, was doubtless the
true Esculas of the Ancients, the Food of the Golden Age. The wood of the
Enzina when old, is curiously chambletted, and embroidered with Natural
vermiculations as if it were painted.

6. The Alaternus, Alaternus.
which we have lately received from the hottest parts of Languedoc (and that is
equal with the heat of almost any Country in Europe) thrives with us in
England, as if it were an Indigene and Natural.

7. I have had the honor to be the first who brought it into Use and
reputation in this Kingdom for the most beautiful, and useful of Hedges, and
Verdure in the world (the swiftness of the growth considered) and propagated
it from Cornwall even to Cumberland: The seed grovvs ripe with us in August;
and the hony-breathing blossoms, afford an early, and mervellous relief to the
Bees.

8. All the Phillyrea's are yet more hardy; Phillyrea.
which makes me vvonder to find the Angustifolia planted in Cases, and so
char^ly set into the Stoves, amongst the Oranges and Lemmons; when by long
experience, I have found it equal our Holly in suffering the extremest rigours
of our cruellest Frosts, and Winds, which is doubtless (of all our English
Trees) the most insensible and stout.

9. They are (both Alaternus and this) raised of the Seeds (though those of the
Phillyrea will be long under ground) and being transplanted for Espalier
hedges, or Standards, are to be governed by the Shears, as often as there is
occasion: The Alaternus will be up in one Month after it is sovvn: Plant it
out at two years growth, and clip it after rain in the Spring, before it
grovvs sticky, and vvhiles the shoots are tender; thus will it form an hedge
(though planted but in single rows, and at two foot distance) of a yard in
thickness, twenty foot high (if you desire it) and furnished to the bottom:
But for an hedge of this altitude, it would require the friendship of some
Wall, or a Frame of lusty Poles, to secure against the Winds one of the most
delicious objects in nature: But if we could have store of the Phillyrea folio
leviter serrato (of which I have raised some very fine Plants from the Seeds)
we might fear no weather, and the verdure is incomparable.

10. Granad^*
The Culture of the Granade (of which are three sorts) does little differ from
that of the Alaternus, of which we might raise considerable Hedges on all our
Southern Aspects: They have supported that most unmerciful Winter in sixty
three, without any artifice; and if they yield us their flowers for our pains
of well pruning and Recision (for they must diligently be purged of their wood)
it is a glorious recompense: I plant them in my Hedgerows even amongst the
Quick; but to have them thrive, you must loosen the Earth at Roots, and enrich
it both Spring and Autumn, leaving but a few woody branches: There is no Tree
so Adulterous as this Shrub, and best by Layers Approach and Inarching, as they
call it; and thence it is said to marry with Lawrells, Damson, Ash, Almond,
Mulberry, Citron, etc. too many (I fear) to hold: If you will plant them in
Gardens to best advantage, keep them to one Stem, and enrich the mould with
Hogs dung well consumed, which they greatly delight in.

Myrtil.
11. The vulgar Italian wild Myrtil (though not indeed the most fragrant) grows
high, and supports all weathers. I know of one near fifty years old, which has
been continually exposed; unless it be, that in some exceeding sharp Seasons,
a little dry straw has been thrown upon it; and where they are smitten, being
cut down near the ground, they put forth and recover again; which many times
they do not in Pots, and Cases, where the Roots are very obnoxious to perish
with mouldiness. The shelter of a few Mats, and Straw, secured very great Trees
(both leaf and color in perfection) this last Winter also, which were planted
abroad; whiles those that were carried into the Conserve, were most of them
lost. Myrtils may be raised of Seeds, but with great caution; and they seldom
prove hardy, nor is it worth the time, being so abundantly increased of Layers.

Lentisc.
12. Lentiscus, the Lentisc, a very beautiful ever-green, will thrive abroad
with us, with a little care and shelter, amongst other exposed Shrubs, and may
be propagated of Suckers and Layers; and the like may be done by the Olive,
though it bear no other Fruit than the perennial verdure of the leaves: Of the
Lentisc are made the best Tooth-pickers in the world, and the Mastic, or Gum is
of excellent use, especially for the Teeth and Gums.

13. I might to these add Lignum vitae, the Aethiopic Seseli, Halimus
Latifolius, Laurus Tinus, Celast^us, etc. fittest for the Shrubby part and
under-furniture of our ever green Groves, and near our Gardens of Pleasure. But

14. I produce not these particulars, and other amoena vireta already
mentioned, as signifying any thing to Timber, the main design of this Treatise
(though I read of some Myrtils so tall, as to make Spear shafts) but to
exemplify in what may be farther added to Ornament and Pleasure, by a cheap,
and most agreeable industry. The Berries of Myrtil were used of old in stead of
Peper.

Jasmine.
15. The common white and yellow Jasmine would flower plentifully in our Woods,
and as hardy as any of the Periclimena: How it is propagated by submersion, or
layers, every Gardener skills; and if it were as much employed for Nose gays,
etc. with us, as it is in France and Italy, they might make money enough of the
Flowers: One sorry Tree in Paris, where they abound, has been worth to a poor
Woman near twenty shillings in a year.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Acacia, Arbutus, Bays, Box, Yew, Holly, Juniper, and
Laurel-trees.
1. THe French have lately brought in the Virginian Acacia, Acacia.
which exceedingly adorns their Walks: The Tree is hardy against all the
invasions of our sharpest seasons, but our high Winds; which by reason of its
brittle nature it does not so well resist; and the Roots (which insinuate and
run like liquorize under ground) are apt to emaciate the Soil, and therefore
happily not so commendable in our Gardens, as they would be agreeable for variety
of Walks and shade: They thrive well in his Majesty's new Plantation in St.
James's Park.

2. But why do we thus neglect the Arbutus, Arbutus*
and make that such a rarity, which grows so common, and so naturally in
Ireland? It is indeed with some difficulty raised from the Seeds; but it may be
propagated from the Layers, grows to a goodly Tree; is patient of our severest
Weather, and may be contrived into most beautiful Hedges: Virgil reports it
will inoculate with the Nut; and I find Bauhinus commends the Coals for
Goldsmiths works, and the Poet Arbutean Harrows and the mystic Van.
Arbuteae crates, and mystica Vannus Jacchi.
Georg. 1.

3. Bays are increased both of their Suckers, and Seeds, Bays.
which should be dropping-ripe ere gathered: Pliny has a particular process for
the ordering of the Seeds, and it is not to be rejected: Which is, the
gathering the Berries, in January, and spreading them till their sweat be over;
then he puts them in dung and sows them: As for the steeping in Wine, Water
does altogether as well; others wash the seeds, from their mucilage, by
breaking and bruising the glutinous berries; then sow them in March by scores
in a heap; and indeed so they will come up in clusters, but nothing so well,
nor fit for transplantation, as where they are interred with a competent
scattering, so as you would furrow Pease: Both this way, and by setting them
apart (which I most commend) I have raised multitudes, and that in the Berries
without any farther preparation; only for the first two years they would be
defended from the piercing winds which frequently destroy them; and yet the
scorching of their tender leaves ought not make you despair, for many of them
will recover beyond expectation.

4. This aromatic Tree greatly loves the Shade, yet thrives best in our hottest
gravel, having once passed those first difficulties: Age and Culture about the
Roots wonderfully augment its growth; so as I have seen Trees near thirty foot
high of them; and almost two foot diameter. They are fit also both for Arbor
and Palisade-work, so the Gardener understand when to prune, and keep it from
growing two woody.

Box.
5. The Box which we begin to proscribe our Gardens (and indeed Bees are no
friend to it) should not yet be banished from our care; because the excellency
of the wood does commute for the unagreeablenesse of its smell: therefore let
us furnish our cold, and barren Hills, and declivities with this useful Shrub,
I mean the taller sort, for I meddle not here with the dwarf and more tonsile;
It will increase abundantly of slips set in March.

6. The Turner, Ingraver, Carver, Mathematical-Instrument, Comb and Pipe-makers
(Si buxos inflare juvat -- Virg.) give great prizes for it by weight, as well
as measure; and by the seasoning, and diverse manner of cutting, vigorous
insolations, politure and grinding, the Roots of this Tree (as of even our
common and neglected Thorn) do furnish the Inlayer and Cabinet-makers with
pieces rarely undulated, and full of variety. Also of Box are made Wheels or
Shivers (as our Ship-Carpenters call them) and Pinns for Blocks and Pullies;
Pegs for Musical Instruments, Nutcrackers, Weavers Shuttles, Hollar-sticks,
Bump-sticks, and Dressers for the Shoemaker, Rulers, Rolling-pins, Pestles,
Mall-balls, Beetles, Topps, Tables, Chess-men, Skrews male and female, Bobins
for Bonelace, Spoons, nay the stoutest Axle-trees; but above all, -- Box-Combs
bear no small part
In the Militia of the Female Art;
They tie the Links which hold our Gallants fast,
And spread the Nets to which fond Lovers have.
-- Non ultima belli
Arma Puellaris; Laqu^os haec nectit Amantum,
Et venatricis disponit retia Formae.
Couleii Pl. l. 6

7. The Chemical oil of this wood has done the feats of the best Guajacum
(though in greater quantity) for the Cure of Venereal Diseases, as one of the
most expert Physicians in Europe has confessed.

Eugh.
8. Since the use of Bows is laid aside amongst us, the propagation of the
Eugh-tree (of which we have two sorts, and other places reckon more, as the
Arcadian black, and red; the yellow of Ida, infinitely esteemed of old) is
likewise quite forborne; but the neglect of it is to be deplored; seeing that
(besides the rarity of it in Italy, and France, where but little of it grows)
the barrenest grounds, and coldest of our Mountains (for

-- Aquilonem and frigora taxi) might be profitably replenished with them: I
say, profitably, for, besides the use of the wood for Bows

-- Ityraeos taxi torquentur in arcus. (for which the close, and more deeply
died is best.) The forementioned Artists in Box most gladly employ it: And for
the Cogs of Mills, Posts to be set in moist grounds, and everlasting
Axle-trees, there is none to be compared with it; likewise for the bodies of
Lutes, Theorbas, Bowls, Wheels, and Pinns for Pullys; yea, and for Tankards
to drink out of; whatever Pliny report concerning its Shade, and the stories of
the Air about Thasus, the Fate of Cativulcus mentioned by Caesar, and the ill
report which the Fruit has vulgarly obtained in France, Spain, and Arcadia;
But, How are poor Trees abused!
Quam multa Arborihus tribuuntur crimina falsa!


9. The Toxic quality was certainly in the Liquor which those good Fellows
tippl'd out of those Bottles, not in the nature of the wood; which yet he
affirms is cured of that Venenous quality, by driving a brazen-wedge into the
Body of it: This I have never tried, but that of the Shade and Fruit I have
frequently, without any deadly, or noxious effects: so that I am of opinion
that Tree which Sestius calls Smilax, and our Historian thinks to be our Eugh,
was some other wood; and yet I acknowledge that it is esteemed noxious to
Cattle, when it is in the Seeds, or newly sprouting.

10. This Tree is easily produced of the Seeds, washed and cleans'd from their
mucilage; and buried in the ground like Haws; It will commonly be the second
VVinter ere they peep, and then they rise with their caps on their heads: Being
three years old you may transplant them, and form them into Standards, Knobs,
VValks, Hedges, etc. in all which works they succeed mavelous well, and are
worth our patience for their perennial verdure, and durablenesse.

11. He that in winter should behold some of our highest Hills in Surrey clad
with whole Woods of these two last sort of Trees, for diverse Miles in circuit
(as in those delicious Groves of them, belonging to the Honorable, my noble
Friend Sir Adam Brown of Bech-worth-Castle, from Box-hill, and near our famous
Mole or Swallow) might without the least violence to his Imagination, easily
fancy himself transported into some new or enchanted Country; for, if any
spot of England, -- It Is here
Eternal Spring, and Summer all the year.
Hic ver perpetuum, atque alienis mensibus aestas.


12. But, Holly.
above all the natural Greens which enrich our homeborn store, there is none
certainly to be compared to the Agrifolium, or Acuifolium rather, our Holly,
insomuch as I have often wondered at our curiosity after foreign Plants, and
expensive difficulties, to the neglect of the culture of this vulgar, but
incomparable tree; whether we will propagate it for Use, and Defense, or for
sight and Ornament.

A Hedge of Holly, Thieves that would invade,
Repulses like a growing Palizade;
Whose numerous leaves such Orient Greens invest
As in deep Winter do the Spring a rest.
-- Mala furta hominum densis mucronibus axcens
Securum defendit in expugnabilis Hortum*
Exornatque simul, toto spectabilis anno,
Et numero and viridifoliorum luce nitentum.
Couleii Pl. l. 6. 13. Is there under Heaven a more glorious and refreshing
object of the kind, than an impregnable Hedge of one hundred and sixty foot in
length, seven foot high, and five in diameter, which I can show in my poor
Gardens at any time of the year, glittering with its armed and vernish'd
leaves? the taller Standards at orderly distances blushing with their natural
Coral: It mocks at the rudest assaults of the Weather, Beasts, or
Hedge-breakers, Et illum nemo impune lacessit. It is with us of two eminent
kinds, the prickly, and smoother leaved, or as some term it, the Free-holly,
not unwelcome when tender, to Sheep, and other Cattle.

14. I have already showed how it is to be raised of the Berries (of which
there is a sort bears them yellow) when they are ready to drop, this only
omitted, that they would first be freed from their tenacious and glutinous
Mucilage by being washed, and a little bruised, then dried with a Cloth; or
else bury them as you do Hipps; and let our Forester receive this for no common
secret, and take notice of the effect: Remove them also after three or four
years; but if you plant the Sets (which is likewise a commendable way, and the
Woods will furnish enough) place 'em Northwards, as they do Quick. Of this
might there living Pales and Enclosures be made (such as the Right Honorable
my Lord Dacres, somewhere in Sussex, has a Park almost environed with, able to
keep in any Game, as I am credibly informed) and cut into square Hedges, it
becomes impenetrable, and will thrive in hottest as well as the coldest places.
I take thousands of them four inches long out of the Woods (amongst the fallen
leaves whereof, they sow themselves) and so Plant them; but this should be
before the Cattle begin to crop them, especially Sheep, who are greedy of them
when tender: Stick them into the ground in a moist season, Spring, or Autumn;
especially the Spring, shaded (if it prove too hot and scorching) till they
begin to shoot of themselves, and in very sharp Weather, and during our Eastern
Etesians, covered with dry straw or Haume; and if any of them seem to perish,
cut it close, and you shall soon see it revive. The lustyer and bigger the Sets
are, the better, and if you can procure such as are a Thumbs-breadth thick,
they will soon furnish into an Hedge. At Dengenesse in Kent they grow naturally
amongst the very beach and pibbles: And this rare Hedge, the boast of my Villa,
was planted upon a burning Gravel, exposed to the meridian Sun.

15. True it is, that time must bring this Tree to perfection; it does so to
all things else, and posteritati pangimus. But what if a little culture about
the Roots (not dunging, which it abhors) and frequent stirring of the mould
doubles its growth? We stay seven years for a tolerable Quick, it is worth
staying it thrice for this, which has no Competitor.

16. And yet there is an expedient to effect it more insensibly, by planting it
with the Quick: Let every fifth or sixth be an Holly-set, they will grow up
infallibly with your Quick, and as they begin to spread, make way for them, by
extirpating the White-thorn, till they quite domineer: Thus was my Hedge first
Planted, without the least interruption to the Fence, by a most pleasant
Metamorphosis. But there is also another, not less applauded, by laying along
of well rooted Sets (a yard or more in length) and stripping off the leaves and
branches: these covered with a competent depth of earth, will send forth
innumerable Suckers, which will suddenly advance into an Hedge.

17. The Timber of the Holly (besides that it is the Whitest of all hard woods,
and therefore used by the In-layer, especially, under thin plates of Ivory to
render it more conspicuous) is for all sturdy uses; the Mill-Wright, Turner and
Engraver prefer it to any other: It makes the best handles, and stocks for
Tools, Flayles, Riding-rods the best, and Carters whips; Bowls, Shivers, and
pins for Blocks; Also it excels for Dore-bars and bolts; and as of the Elm, so
of this especially, they made even hinges and hooks to serve instead of Iron,
and of the Bark is composed our Bird-lime.

18. Pill a good quantity of the Bark about Midsommer, fill a Vessel with it,
and put to it Spring Water; then boil it, 'till the gray and white bark rise
from the green, which will require near 12 hours boiling; then taking it off
the fire, separate the barks, the water first well drained from it: Then lay
the green bark on the Earth in some cool Vault or Cellar, covering it with any
sort of green and rank weeds, such as Dock, Thistles, Hemlock, etc. to a good
thickness: Thus let it continue near a fort-night, by which time 'twill become
a perfect mucilage: then pound it all exceedingly in a stone mortar 'till it be
a tough past, and so very fine, as no part of the bark be discernable: This
done, wash it accurately well in some running stream of Water, as long as you
perceive the least ordure or motes in it, and so reserve it in some earthen pot
to purge and ferment, scuming it as often as any thing arises for four or five
days, and when no more filth comes, change it into a fresh Vessel of earth, and
reserve it for use, Thus: Take what quantity you please of it, and in an
earthen pipkin add a third part of Capons or Goose-grease to it, well
clarified; or Oil of Walnuts which is better: Incorporate these on a gentle
fire, continually stirring it 'till it be cold, and thus your Composition is
finished. But to prevent Frosts (which in severe weather will sometimes invade
it on the Rods) take a quarter of as much Oil of Petrolium as you do of
Grease, and no cold whatever will congeale it. The Italians make their Vischio
of the Berries of the Misselto of Trees, treated much after the same manner,
but then they mix it with Nut-Oyle an ounce to a pound of Lime, and taking it
from the fire, add half an ounce of Terpentine which qualifies it also for the
Water. Great quantities of Bird-lime is brought to us out of Turkey, and from
Damascus, which some conceive to be made of Sebestens, finding sometimes the
kernels: This lime is of a greener color, subject to Frosts, and impatient of
Wet, nor will last above a year or two good: Another sort comes also out of
Syria of a yellow hue; Likewise from Spain, whiter than the rest, will resist
the water, but is of an ill sent. I have been told that the Cortex of our
Lantona or Wayfaring shrub, will make as good Bird-lime as the best. But, let
these suffice, being more than as yet, any one has published. The superior
Leaves of Holly Trees dried to a fine powder, and drunk in White Wind is
prevalent against the Stone, and cures Fluxes; and a dozen of the mature
Berries being swallowed, purge Phlegm without danger.

Juniper.
19. Of Juniper we have three sorts, (Male, Female, Dwarf) whereof one is much
taller, and more fit for Improvement: The wood is yellow, and sweet as Cedar,
whereof it is accounted a spurious kind.

20. I have raised them abundantly of their seeds (neither watring nor dunging
the soil) which in two months will peep, and being governed like the Cypress,
apt for all the employments of that beautiful Tree: To make it grow tall, prune
and cleanse it to the very stem, the male best. The discreet loosening of the
Earth about the Roots also makes it strangely to prevent your expectations by
suddenly spreading into a bush fit for a thousand pretty Employments; for
coming to be much unlike that which grows wild, and is subject to the treading
and cropping of Cattle, etc. it may be formed into most beautiful and useful
Hedges: My Brother having cut out of one only Tree an Arbor capable for three
to sit in: It was at my last measuring seven foot square, and eleven in height;
and would certainly have been of a much greater altitude and farther spreading,
were it not continually kept shorn: But what is most considerable is the little
time since it was planted, being yet hardly ten years, and then it was brought
out of the Common a slender Bush of about two foot high: But I have
experimented a proportionable improvement in my own Garden, where I do mingle
them with Cypress, and they perfectly become their stations. I wonder Virgil
should condemn its shadow, I suspect him mis-reported: For,

21. The Berries afford (besides a tolerable Pepper) one of the most universal
Remedies in the world to our crazy Forrester; The Berry swallowed only,
instantly appeaseth the Wind-Collique, and in decoction most sovereign against
an inveterate Cough: They are of rare effect being steeped in Beer. The Water
is a most singular specifique against the Gravel in the Reins; But all is
comprehended in the virtue of the Theriacle or Electuary, which I have often
made for my poor Neighbors, and may well be termed the Forresters Panaaea
against the Stone, Rheum, Ptisic, Dropsy, Jaundies, inward Impostumes, nay,
Palsy, Gout and Plague it self taken like Venice-Treacle. Of the extracted
Oil (with that of Nuts) is made an excellent good Vernish for Pictures, for
Wood-work and to preserve polished Iron from the rust. The Gum is good to rub
on parchment to make it bear Ink, and the Coals, which are made of the Wood,
endure the longest of any. See Saint Hierom. ad Fabiolam upon that expression
Psalm. 120. v. 4. If it arrive to full growth it is Timber for many curious
works; for Tables, Chests, small Carvings and Images, spoons, wholesome to the
mouth; spits to roast meat on, to which it gives a rare taste, but it should be
old and dry wood; nay, I read of some large enough for beams and rafters. The
very Chips render a wholesome perfume within doors, as well as the dusty
blossoms in Spring without.

22. And since we now mentioned Pepper, it is by the most prudent, and princely
care of his Majesty that I am assured of a late solemn Act of Council,
enjoining the preserving of that incomparable Spice which comes to us from
Jamaica under that denomination; though in truth it be a mixture of so many
Aromatics in one, that it might as well have been called Cinnamon, Nutmeg or
Mace, to every of which it seems something alied: And that there is not only
prohibited the destruction of these Trees (for it seems some Prodigals used to
cut them down for the more easy gathering) but order taken likewise for their
propagation, and that Assays and Samples be from time to time sent over, what
other Fruits, Trees, Gums and Vegetables may there be found, and which I
prognostic will at last also incite his Majesty, and the Planters there to
think of procuring Cinnamon, Cloves and Nutmeg-trees indeed from the
East-Indias, and what other useful Curiosities will not approach our Northern
Bear (and that are incicurabiles amongst us) and to plant them in Jamaica, and
other of his Majesty's Western Islands, a more safe and frugal expedient to
humble our emulous Neighbors; since there is nothing in their Situation, or
defect of Natures benignity, which ought in the least to discourage us: And
what if some of the Trees of those Countries (especially such as aspire to be
Timber, and may be of improvement amongst us) were more frequently brought to
us likewise here in England; since we daily find how many rare Exotics and
strangers with little care, become endenizon'd, and so contented to live
amongst us, as may be seen in the Platanus, Constantinople-Chess-nut, the
greater Glandiferos Ilex, Cork, Nux Vesicaria (which is an hard Wood fit for
the Turner, etc.) the Styrax, Bead tree, the famous Lotus, Virginian Acatia,
Guaicum Patavinum, Paliurus, Cypress, Pines, Fir, and sundry others, which grow
already in our Gardens exposed to the Weather; and so doubtless would many
more: So judiciously observed is that of the learned Author of the History of
the Royal Society, Part. 3. Sect. 28. That whatever attempts of this nature
have succeeded, they have redounded to the great advantage of the Undertakers.
The Orange of China being of late brought into Portugal, has drawn a great
Revenew every year from London alone. The Vine of the Rhene taking root in the
Canaries, has produced a far more delicious juice, and has made the Rocks and
Sunburned Ashes of those Islands, one of the richest spots of Ground in the
World. And I will also instance in that which is now in a good forwardness:
Virginia has already given Silk for the clothing of our King; and it may
happen hereafter to give Clothes to a great part of Europe, and a vast
Treasure to our Kings: If the Silkworms shall thrive there (of which there
seems to be no doubt) the profit will be inexpressible. We may guess at it, by
considering what numbers of Caravans, and how many great Cities in Persia are
maintained by that Manufacture alone, and what mighty Customs it yearly brings
unto the Sophi's Revenew. Thus He; And to return to that of Trees and Plants,
the Industry we have recommended, would questionless in less than half an Age
produce us wonders, by introduction, if not of quite different; yet of better
kinds, and such variety for pulchritude and sweetness; that when by some
Princely Example, our late Pride, Effeminacy and Luxury (which has to our vast
charges excluded all the Ornaments of Timber, etc. to give place to Hangings,
Embroderies and foreign Leather) shall be put out of Countenance, we may hope
to see a new face of things for the encouragement of Planters, the more
immediate Work of Gods hands; and the natural, wholesome, and ancient use of
Timber, for the more lasting occasions and furniture of our Dwellings: And
though I do not speak all this for the sake of Joyne-stools, Benches,
Cup-boards, Massy Tables and Gygantic Bed-steds, the hospitable Vtensils of our
fore- Fathers; Yet I would be glad to encourage the Carpenter and the Joyner,
and rejoice to see, that their Work and Skill do daily improve; and that by the
Example and application of his Majesty's Universities, and Royal Society the
Restoration and Improvement of Shiping, Mathematical and Mechanical Arts, the
use of Timber grows daily in more reputation: And it were well if Great Persons
might only be indulged to enrich and adorn their Palaces with Tapistry, Damasc,
Velvet, and Persian furniture, whilst by some wholesome Sumptuary Laws, the
universal excess of those Costly and Luxurious Movables were prohibited meaner
Men, for diverse politic Considerations and Reasons which it were easy to
produce; but by a less influence than severer Laws, it will be very difficult,
if not altogether impossible, to recover our selves from a softness and vanity
which will in time not only effeminate, but undo the Nation.

23. Laurel.
But to Crown all, I will conclude with the Laurel, which by the Use we
commonly put it to, seems as if it had been only destined for Hedges, and to
cover bare Walls; whereas, being planted upright, and kept to the Standard, by
cutting away the collateral Branches, and maintaining one stem, it will rise to
a very considerable Tree; and (for the first twenty years) resembling the most
beautiful headed Orange in shape and verdure, arrive in time to emulate even
some of our lusty Timber Trees; so as I dare pronounce the Laurel to be one of
the most proper, and ornamental Trees for Walks and Avenues of any growing.

24. Pity it is they are so abused in the Hedges, where the lower Branches
growing stickie and dry, by reason of their frequent and unseasonable cutting
(with the genius of the Tree, which is to spend much in wood) they never
succeed after the first six or seven years; but are to be new planted again, or
abated to the very Roots for a fresh shote.

25. But would you yet improve the Standard which I celebrate, to greater and
more speedy exaltation? bud your Laurel on the Black-Cherry stock to what
height you please; if at least the report be true, which I had from an ocular
testimony, and am now making an essay of, because I am more then somewhat
doubtful of such Allyances, though something like it in Palladius speaks it not
so impossible; A Cherry Grast on Laurel-stock does stain
The Virgin Fruit in a deep double grain.
Inseritur lauro Cerasus, partuque coacto
Tingit adoptivus virginis ora pudor


26. They are raised of the Seeds or Berries with extraordinary facility, or
propagated by Layers Taleae, and cuttings wherever there is shade and
moisture. I find little concerning the Mechanical uses of the Laurel; but than
its Attributes of old there was nothing more glorious and magnificent; For,
From Laurel chewed the Pythian Priestess rose,
Events of future Actions to disclose.
Laurel Triumphant Generals did wear,
And Laurel Heralds in their hands did bear:
Poets ambitious of unfading praise,
Phoebus, the Muses all are crowned with Bays.
And Virtue to her sons the Prize does name Symbol of Glory, and immortal Fame.
Tu sacros Phoebi tripodas, ta Sidera sentis,
Et casus aperis rerum praesaga futuros.
Te ju^at armorum strepitus, clangorque Tubarum:
Perque acies medias, saevique pericula belli,
Accendis bellantum animos; te Cynthius ipse,
Te Musae, Vatesque sacri optav^re Coronam:
Ipsa suis Virtus te spem proponit alumnis,
Tantum servatus valuit pudor, and bona famu*
Rapinus.

I have now finished my Planting: A word or two concerning their Preservation,
and the Cure of their Infirmities.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the Infirmities of Trees.
THe Diseases of Trees are various, Infirmities*
according to the Rustic Rhyme, The Calf, the Wind-shoc and the Knot,
The Canker, Scab, Scurf, Sap and Rot.
Affecting the several parts: These invade the Roots; Weeds, Suckers, Fern,
Wet, Mice, Moles, Winds, etc. to these may be added Siderations and even
Plagues, Tumors, Distortions, Lacrimations, Tophi, Goutes, Carbuncles, Ulcers,
Crudities, Fungosities, Gangreens, and an Army more, whereof some are hardly
discernable; yet Enemies, which not foreseen, makes many a bargain of
standing-wood (though seemingly fair) very costly ware.

1. Weeds are to be diligently pulled up by hand after Rain, whiles your
Seedlings are very young, and till they come to be able to kill them with shade
and over-dripping: And then are you for the obstinate to use the Haw, Fork, and
Spade, to extirpate Dog-grass, Bear-bind, etc.

2. Suckers shall be duly eradicated, and with a sharp spade dexterously
separated from the Mother-roots, and Transplanted in convenient places for
propagation, as the Season requires.

3. Fern is best destroyed by striking off the Tops, as Tarquin did the heads
of the Poppies: This done with a good wand or cudgel, at the decrease in the
Spring, and now and then in Summer, kills it in a year or two beyond the vulgar
way of Mowing, or burning, which rather increases than diminishes it.

4. Overmuch Wet is to be drained by Trenches, where it infests the Roots of
such kinds as require drier ground: But if a drip do fret into the body of a
Tree by the head (which will certainly decay it) cutting first the place
smooth, stop and cover it with loam and hay till a new bark succeed. These
infest the Bark; Bark-bound, Teredo, or Worm, Conys, Moss, Ivy, etc.

5. The Bark-bound are to be released by drawing your knife rind-deep from the
Root, as far as you can conveniently; and if the gaping be much, filling the
rift with a little Cow Dung; do this on each side, and at Spring, February or
March; also cutting off some branches is profitable; especially such as are
blasted or lightning-struck.

6. The Teredo, Cossi, and other Worms, lying between the Body and the Bark,
poison that passage to the great prejudice of some Trees; but the holes being
once found, they are to be taken out with a light Incision; and the
Wood-pecker, and other Birds often pitching upon the stem, as you may observe
them, and knocking with their bills, is a mark that the Tree is infected, at
least, between the Bark.

7. Conies and Hares by barking the Trees in hard Winters, spoil very many
tender Plantations: Next to the utter destroying them, there is nothing better
then to anoint that part which is within their reach, with stercus humanum,
tempered with a little Water or Urine, and lightly brushed on; this renewed
after every great Rain: But a cleanlier than this, and yet which Conies, and
even Cattle most abhor, is to water, or sprinkle them with Tanners Liquor, viz.
That, which they use for dressing their hides.

8. Moss is to be rubbed and scraped off with some fit instrument of Wood,
which may not excorticate the Tree, or with a piece of Hair-cloth after a
sobbing Rain: But the most infallible Art of Emuscation is taking away the
cause, which is superfluous moisture in clayie and spewing grounds.

9. Ivy is destroyed by diging up the Roots, and loosning its hold: And yet
even Ivy it self, the destruction of many fair Trees, if very old, and where it
has long invested its support, if taken off, does frequently kill the Tree, by
a too sudden exposure to the un-accustom'd cold: Of the Roots of Ivy (which
with small Industry, may be made a beautiful Standard) are made curiously
polished and fleck'd cups and boxes, and even Tables of great value. Missleto
and other Excrescences to be cut and broken off. But the Fungi (which
prognosticate a fault in the Liver and Entrails of Trees as we may call it) is
remedied by Abrasion, Friction, Interlucation and exposure to the Sun.

10. The Bodies of Trees are visited with Canker, Hollowness, Hornets, Earwigs,
Snails, etc.

11. The Wind-shock is a bruise and shiver throughout the Tree, though not
constantly visible, yet leading the Warp from smooth renting; caused by
over-powerful Winds, when young, and perhaps, by subtle Lightnings: The best
prevention is shelter, choice of place for the Plantation, frequent shreading
whilst they are yet in their youth.

12. Cankers (caused by some stroke or galling) are to be cut out to the quick,
the scars emplaistred with Tar mingled with Oil, and over that a thin spreading
of loam; or else with clay and Horse-dung; but best with hogs-dung alone, bound
to it in a rag: or by laying Wood-ashes, Nettles, or Fern to the roots, etc.
But if the Gangreen be within, it must be cured by nitrous, sulphurous and
drying applications, and by no means, by any thing of an unctious nature, which
is exitial to Trees. Tar as was said, only excepted, which I have
experimentally known to preserve Trees from the envenomed teeth of Goats, and
other injuries; the entire stem smar'd over, without the least prejudice to my
no small admiration.

13. Hollowness is contracted, when by reason of the ignorant or careless
lopping of a Tree the wet is suffered to fall perpendicularly upon a part,
especially the Head: In this case if there be sufficient sound wood, cut it to
the quick and close to the body, and cap the hollow part with a Tarpaulin, or
fill it with good stiff loam, and fine hay mingled. This is one of the worst of
Evils, and to which the Elm is most obnoxious.

14. Hornets and Wasps, etc. by breeding in the hollowness of Trees infect
them, and are therefore to be destroyed by stopping up their entrances with Tar
and Goos-dung, or by conveying the fumes of brimstone into their Cells.

15. Earwigs and Snails do seldom infest Forest-trees, but those which are
Fruit-bearers, and are destroyed by enticing them into sweet waters, and by
picking the Snails off betimes in the Morning, and rainy Evenings: I advise you
to visit your Cypresse-Trees on the first Rains in April; you shall sometimes
find them covered with young snailes no bigger than small pease: Lastly,
Branches, Buds, and Leaves extremely suffer from the Blasts, Jaundies, and
Caterpillars, Rooks, etc.

16. The blasted parts of Trees are to be cut away to the quick; and to prevent
it, smoke them in suspicious weather, by burning moist straw with the wind, or
rather the dry and superfluous cuttings of Aromatic plants, such as Rosemary,
Lavender, Juniper, Bays, etc. I use to whip, and chastise my Cypresses with a
wand, after their Winter-burnings, 'till all the mortified and scorched parts
fly off in dust, as long almost as any will fall, and observe that they
recover and spring the better. Mice, Moles, and Pismires cause the Jaundies in
Trees, known by the discolor of the Leaves and Buds.

17. The Moles may be taken in Traps, and killed, as every Wood-man knows: It
is certain that they are driven from their haunts by Garlic for a time, and
other heady smells buried in their passages.

18. Mice with Traps, or by sinking some Vessel almost level with the surface
of the ground, the Vessel half full of Water, upon which, let there be strewn
some hulls or chaff of Oats; also with Bane.

19. Destroy Pismires with scalding water, and disturbing their hills, or
rubbing the stem with Cow Dung, or a decoction of Tithy-male, washing the
infested parts; and this will insinuate, and chase them quite out of the chinks
and crevices, without prejudice to the Tree, and is a good prevention of other
Infirmities.

20. Caterpillars, by cutting off their webs from the twigs before the end of
February, and burning them; the sooner the better: If they be already hatched
wash them off with Water, in which some of the Caterpillars themselves, and
Garlic have been bruised, or the juice of Rue, or choke and dry them with
smoke of Galbanum, Shooe-soles, Hair, and some affirm that planting the Pionie
near them is a certain remedy; but there is no remedy so facile as the burning
them often with small wisps of dry straw, which in a moment rids you.

21. Rooks do in time, by pinching off the buds and tops of Trees for their
Nests, cause many Trees and Groves to decay: But if Cattle break in before the
time, conclamatum est, especially Goats, whose mouths and breath is poison to
Trees; they never thrive well after, and Varro affirms, if they but lick the
Olive tree, they become immediately barren.

22. Another touch at the Winds; For though they cannot properly be said to be
Infirmities of Trees; yet they are amongst the principal causes that render
Trees infirm. I know no surer protection against them, than (as we said) to
shelter and stake them whilst they are young, 'till they have well established
Roots; And with this caution, that in case any goodly Trees (which you would
desire especially to preserve and redress) chance to be prostrated by some
impetuous and extraordinary storm; you be not over hasty to carry him away, or
despair of him; but first let me persuade you to poll him close, and so let him
lie some time; for by this means many vast Trees have raised themselves by the
vigor only of the remaining Roots, without any other assistance; so as people
have pronounced it Miraculous, as I could tell you by several Instances;
besides what Theophrastus relates c. 19. of that huge Platanus, which rise in
one Night in his observation; and the like I find hapn'd in more than one Tree
near Bononia in Italy, An. 1657. when of late a turbulent Gust had almost quite
irradicated a very large Tract of huge Poplars, belonging to the Marchioness
Elephantucca Spada, that universally erected themselves again after they were
beheaded as they lay even prostrate: What says the Naturalist? Prostratas
restitui plerunque, and quadam terrae cicatrice reviviscere vulgar est: It Is
familiar (says Pliny) in the Platanus, which are very obnoxious to the Winds,
by reason of the thickness of their branches, which being cut off, and
discharged, restore themselves. This also frequently happens in Wall-nuts,
Olive Trees, and several others, as he affirms; l. 16. c. 31. These (amongst
many others) are the Infirmities to which Forest-Trees are subject whilst they
are standing; and when they are felled, to the Worm; especially if cut before
the Sap be perfectly at rest: But to prevent or cure it in the Timber, I
recommend this Secret as the most approved.

23. Let common yellow Sulphur be put into a cucurbit-glasse, upon which pour
so much of the strongest Aqua fortis as may cover it three fingers deep: Distill
this to dryness, which is done by two or three Rectifications: Let the Sulphur
remaining in the bottom (being of a blackish or sad red color) be laid on a
Marble, or put into a Glass, where it will easily dissolve into Oil: With this
anoint what is either infected or to be preserved of Timber. It is a great and
excellent Arcanum for tinging the Wood with no unpleasant color, by no Art to
be washed out; and such a preservative of all manner of Woods, nay, of many
other things; as Ropes, Cables, Fishing-Nets, Masts of Ships, etc. that it
defends them from putrefaction, either in Waters, under, or above the earth, in
the Snow, Ice, Air, Winter or Summer, etc. It were superfluous to describe the
process of the Aquafortis; It shall be sufficient to let you know, That our
common Coperas makes this Aquafortis well enough for our purpose, being drawn
over by a Retort: And for Sulphur the Island of Saint Christophers yields
enough, (which hardly needs any Refining) to furnish the whole world. This
Secret (for the Curious) I thought fit not to omit; though a more compendious,
three or four anointings with Linseed Oil, has proved very effectual: It was
experimented in a Wall-nut Table, where it destroyed millions of Worms
immediately, and is to be practiced for Tables, Tubes, Mathematical
Instruments, Boxes, Bed-steads, Chairs, Rarities, etc. Oil of Wall-nuts will
doubtless do the same, is sweeter, and a better Vernish; but above all is
commended Oil of Cedar, or that of Juniper.

24. Hitherto I have spoken of Trees, their kinds, and propagation in
particular: Now a word or two concerning their ordering in general, as it
relates to Copses, Lopping, Felling, etc. Then I shall add something more
concerning their Uses, as to Fuel, etc. and cast such accidental Lessons into
a few Aphorisms, as could not well be more regularly inserted.

Lastly, I shall conclude with some more serious Observations in reference to
the main Design and project of this Discourse, as it concerns the Improvement
of his Majesty's Forests, for the honor and security of the whole Kingdom.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Copses.
Copses.
1. SYlva Caedua is (as Varro defines it) as well Copse to cut for fuel as for
use of Timber; and we have already showed how it is to be raised, both by
Sowing and Planting. I shall only here add, that if in their first
Designation, they be so laid out, as to grow for several Falls; they will both
prove more profitable, and most delightful: Most profitable, because of their
annual Succession; and most pleasant, because there will always remain some of
them standing; and if they be so cast out, as that you leave strait, and even
Intervals of eighteen, or twenty foot for grass, between Spring-wood and
Spring-wood, securely Fenced, and preserved; the Pastures will lie both warm,
and prove of exceeding delight to the Owner. These Spaces likewise useful and
necessary for Cart-way, to fetch out the wood at every Fall. There is not a
more noble, and worthy Husbandry, than is this, which rejects no sort of
Ground, as we have abundantly showed; since even the most boggy places, may so
be drein'd and cast, as to yield its increase, by Planting the dryer sorts upon
the Ridges and banks which you cast up, where they will thrive exceedingly: And
then Willow, Sallow, Alder, Poplar, Sycomor, etc. will shoot tollerably well on
the lower and more Vliginous; with this caution, that for the first two years,
they be kept diligently weeded and cleansed, which is as necessary as fencing
and guarding from Cattle. Our ordinary Copses are chiefly upon Hasel, or the
Birch; but if amongst the other kinds store of Ash, Chessnut, and Sallow (at
least one in four) were sprinkled in the Planting, the profit would soon
discover a difference, and well recompense the industry. Others advise us to
Plant shoots of Sallow, Willow, Alder, and of all the swift growing Trees,
being of seven years growth, sloping off both the ends toward the ground, to
the length of a Billet, and burying them a reasonable depth in the earth. This
will cause them to put forth seven or eight branches, each of which will become
a Tree in a short time, especially, if the soil be moist. The nearest distance
for these Plantations ought never to be less than five foot at first, since
every felling renders them wider for the benefit of the Timber, even to thirty
and forty foot in five or six fellings.

2. Though it be almost impossible for us to prescribe at what Age it were best
Husbandry to fell Coppses (as we at least call best Husbandry) that is, for
most, and greatest gain; since the Mercats, and the kinds of Wood, and emergent
uses do so much govern; yet Copses are sometimes of a competent stature after
eight or nine years from the Acorn, and so every eight or ten years
successively, will rise better and better: But this had need be in
extraordinary ground, otherwise you may do well to allow them twelve or fifteen
to fit them for the Ax; but those of twenty years standing are better, and far
advance the price; especially if Oak, and Ash, and Chessnut be the chief
furniture. Some of our old Clergy spring-Woods heretofore have been let rest
till twenty five or thirty years, and have proved highly worth the attendance;
for by that time even a Seminary of Acorns will render a consideble advance, as
I have already exemplified in the Northamptonshire Lady. And if Copses were so
divided as that every year there might be some felled, it were a continual, and
a present Profit: Seventeen years growth affords a tolerable Fell; supposing
the Copse of seventeen Acres, one Acre might be yearly fell^d for ever; and so
more, according to proportion; but the seldom Fall, yields the more Timber.

3. As to what Numbers and Scantlings you are to leave on every Acre, the
Statutes are our general guides, at least the legal. It is a very ordinary
Copse which will not afford three or four Firsts, that is, Bests; fourteen
Seconds, twelve Thirds, eight Wavers, etc. according to which proportions the
sizes of young Trees in Copsing are to succeed one another. By the Statute of
35 Hen. 8. in Copses or Underwoods felled at twenty four years growth, there
were to be left twelve Standils, or stores of Oak, upon each Acre; in defect of
so many Oaks, the same number of Elms, Ash, Asp, or Beech; and they to be such
as are of likely Trees for Timber, and of such as have been spared at some
former Felling, unless there were none, in which case they are to be then
left, and so to continue without Felling till they are ten inch square within a
yard of ground. Copses above this growth felled, to leave twelve great Oaks; or
in defect of them other Timber Trees (as above) and so to be left for twenty
years longer, and to be enclosed seven years.

4. In sum, you are to spare as many likely Trees for Timber as with
discretion you can. And as to the felling (beginning at one side, that the
Carts may enter without detriment to what you leave standing) the Underwood
may be cut from January at the latest, till mid- March, or April; or from mid-
September, till near the end of November; so as all be avoided by Midsummer at
the latest, and then fenced (where the Rows and brush lie longer unbound or
made up, you endanger the loss of a second Spring) and not to stay so long as
usually they are a clearing, that the young, and the Seedlings may suffer the
least interruption: And if the Winter previous to your felling Copses, you
preserve them well from Cattle, it will recompense your care.

5. It is advised not to cut off the browse-wood of Oaks in Copses, but to
suffer it to fall off, as where Trees stand very close it usually does: I do
not well comprehend why yet it should be spared so long.

6. When you espy a cluster of Plants growing as it were all in a bunch, it
shall suffice that you preserve the fairest Sapling, cutting all the rest away.
And if it chance to be a Ches-nut, Service, or like profitable Tree, clear it
from the droppings and encumbrances of other Trees, that it may thrive the
better: Then as you pass along, prune, and trim up all the young Wavers,
covering such Roots as lie bare and exposed, with fresh mould.

7. Cut not above half a foot from the Ground, and that to the South slopewise;
stripping up such as you spare from their extravagant branches, water-boughs,
etc. that hinder the growth of others: Always remembering (before you so much
as enter upon this work) to preserve sufficient Plash-pole about the verge and
bounds of the Copse for fence, and security of what you leave; and for this
something less than a Rod may suffice: Then raking your Wood clear of Spray,
Chips, and all encumbrances, shut it up from the Cattle; the longer the better.

8. By the Statute Men were bound to enclose Copses after Felling, of or under
fourteen years growth for four years: Those above fourteen years growth to be
sixteen years Enclosed; And for Woods in common, a fourth part to be shut up;
and at Felling the like proportion of great Trees to be left, and seven years
Enclosed: This was enlarged by 13 Eliz. Your elder Underwoods may be grazed
about July: But for a general Rule, newly-weaned Calves are the least noxious
to newly-cut Spring-woods, where there is abundance of Grass; and some say,
Colts of a year old; but then the Calves must be driven out at May at farthest,
though the Colts be permitted to stay a while longer: But of this every man's
experience will direct him; and surely the later you admit Beasts to graze, the
better. For the Measure of Fuel these proportions were to be observed.

9. Statutable Billet should hold three foot in length, and seven inch and half
compass; ten; or fourteen as they are counted for one, two, or three, etc. A
Stack of Wood (which is the boughs and offal of the Trees to be converted to
Char-coal) is four yards long, three foot and half high (in some places but a
yard) and as much over: In other places the Cord is four foot in height, and
four foot over; or (to speak more Geometrically) a Solid made up of three
dimensions, four foot high, four foot broad, and eight foot long; the content
128 cubique feet. Fagots ought to be a full yard in length, and two foot in
circumference, made round, and not flat; for so they contain less Fuel, though
equal in the bulk appearing. But of these particulars when we come to speak
expressly of Fuel.

10. In the mean time it were to be wished, that some approved Experiments were
sedulously tried (with the advice of skillful and ingenious Physicians) for the
making of Beer without Hopps; as possibly with the white Marrubium (a Plant of
singular virtue) or with dried Heath-tops ( viz. that sort which bears no
berries) or the like far more wholesome, and less bitter than either, Tamarisk,
Carduus, or Broom, which diverse have essayed; it might prove a means to save a
world of Fuel, and in diverse places young Timber and Copse-wood, which is
yearly spent for Poles; especially in Countries where Wood is very precious.

Note, that the Wood-land-measure by Statute, is computed after eighteen foot
the Perch.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Pruning.
1. PRuning I call all purgation of Trees from what is superfluous. Pruning.
The Ancients found such benefit in Pruning, that they feigned a Goddess
praesided over it, as Arnobius tells us: And in truth, it is in the discreet
performance of this work, that the improvement of our Timber and Woods does as
much consist as in any thing whatsoever. A skillful Planter should therefore be
early at this Work: Shall old Gratius give you Reason and Direction?

And his incomparable Interpreter thus in English.

Twigs of themselves never rise strait and high,
And Under-woods are bowed as first they shoot.
Then prune the Boughs; and Suckers from the root
Discharge. The leavy wood fond pity tires,
After, when with tall rods the Tree aspires,
And the round staves to Heaven advance their twigs,
Pluck all the buds, and strip off all the sprigs;
These issues vent what moisture still abound,
And the veins unimploy'd grow hard and sound.
Wase. Nunquam sponte sua procerus ad era terms
Exiit, inque ipsa curvantur stirpe genistae.
Ergo ^ge luxuriam primo foetusque uocenteis
Detrahe: frondosas graevat indulgentia silva^.
Post ubi proceris generosa stirpibus arbor
Se dederit, teretesque ferent ad sidera virgae,
Stringe notas circum, and gemmanteis exige versus.
His, si quis vitium nociturus sufficit humor,
Visceribus fluit, and venas durabit i^ertes.
Gra. fall. Cynaeget. 2. For it is a misery to see how our fairest Trees are
defaced, and mangled by unskilful Wood-men, and mischievous Bordurers, who go
always armed with short Hand-bills, hacking and chopping off all that comes in
their way; by which our Trees are made full of knots, boils, cankers, and
deformed bunches, to their utter destruction: Good Husbands should be ashamed
of it; though I would have no VVood-man pretend to be without all his necessary
Furniture, when he goes about this work; which I (once for all) reckon to be
the Hand bill, Hatchet, Hook, Hand saw, an excellent Pruning- Knife, broad
Chizel and Mallet, all made of the best steel and kept sharp; And thus he is
provided for greater, or more gentle Executions, Purgations, Recisions, and
Coersions; and it is of main concern, that the proper and effectual Tool be
app^ied to every work; since heavy and rude Instruments do but mangle and
bruise tender Plants; and if they be too small, they cannot make clear and even
work upon great arms and branches: The Knife is for Twigs and Spray; The Chizel
for larger Arms, and such Amputations as the Ax, and Bill cannot well operate
upon. As much to be reprehended are those who either begin this work at
unseasonable times, or so maim the poor branches, that either out of laziness,
or want of skill, they leave most of them stubs, and instead of cutting the
Arms and Branches close to the boal, hack them off a foot or two from the body
of the Tree, by which means they become hollow and rotten, and are as so many
Conduits to receive the Rain and the Weather, which perishes them to the very
Matrix and Heart, deforming the whole Tree with many ugly botches, which
shorten its life, and utterly mar the Timber: I know Sir H. Platt tells us,
the Elm should be so lopped, but he says it not of his own Experience as I do.

3. By this Animadversion alone it were easy for an ingenious man to
understand how Trees are to be governed; which is in a word, by cutting clean,
smooth, and close, making the stroke upward, and with a sharp Bill, so as the
weight of an untractable bough do not splice, and carry the bark with it, which
is both dangerous and unsightly. The Oak will suffer it self to be made a
Pollard, that is, to have its Head quite cut off; but the Elm so treated, will
perish to the foot, and certainly become hollow at last, if it escape with life.

4. The proper Season for this work is for old Trees earlier, for young later,
as a little after the change in January or February, some say in December: Then
shave their locks, and cut their branchy tresse
Severely now, luxuriant boughs repress.
-- Tunc stringe comas, tunc brachia tonde:
-- Tunc de^ique dura
Exerce Imperia, and ramos compesce fluenteis.
Georg. 2.

But this ought not to be too much in young Fruit-tres, after they once come to
form a handsome head; in which period you should but only pare them over about
March, to cover the stock the sooner, if the Tree be very choice: To the aged,
this is plainly a renewing of their Youth, and an extraordinary refreshment, if
taken in time, and that their Arms be not suffered to grow too great and
large: Besides, for Interlucation, exuberant branches, and spissae nemorum
comae, where the boughs grow too thick and are cumbersome, to let in the Sun
and Air, this is of great importance; and so is the sedulous taking away of
Suckers, Water-boughs, Fretters, etc. And for the benefit of tall Timber, the
due stripping up the branches, and rubbing of the buds to the heights you
require: Yet some do totally forbear the Oak, especially if aged, observing
that they much exceed in growth such as are pruned; and in truth such Trees as
we would leave for shade, and ornament, should be seldom cut; but the
browse-wood cherished, and preserved as low toward the Ground as may be, for a
more venerable and solemn shade: and therefore I did much prefer the walk of
Elms at S. James's Park, as it lately grew branchy, intermingling their
reverend tresses, before the present trimming them up so high; especially,
since I fear, the remedy comes too late to save their decay, if the amputations
of such overgrown parts as have been cut off, should not rather accelerate it,
by exposing their large and many wounds to the injuries of the weather, which
will endanger the rotting of them, beyond all that can be applied by Tar, or
otherwise to protect them: I do rather conceive their Infirmities to proceed
from what has not long since been abated of their large spreading Branches, to
accommodate with the Mall; as any one may conjecture by the great impression
which the wet has already made in those incurable scarrs, that being now
multiplied, must needs the sooner impair them: The roots having likewise
infinitely suffered, by many disturbances about them. In all events this Walk
might have enjoyed its goodly Canopy with all their branchy furniture for some
Ages to come; since it is hardly one, that first they were planted: But his
Majesty will have providently, and nobly supplied this defect, by their
successors of Lime-trees, which will sooner accomplish their perfection.

5. Diverse other precepts of this nature I could here enumerate, had not the
great experience, faithful, and accurate description how this necessary work is
to be performed, set down by our Countryman honest Lawson ( Orchard, cap. 11.)
prevented all that the most Inquisitive can suggest: The particulars are so
ingenious, and highly material, that you will not be displeased to read them in
his own style.

All ages (says he) by Rules and experience do consent to a pruning, and
lopping of Trees: Yet have not any that I know described unto us (except in
dark, and general words) what, or which are those superfluous boughs, which we
must take away; and that is the most chief, and most needful point to be known
in lopping. And we may well assure our selves ( as in all other Arts, so in
this) there is a vantage and dexterity by skill; an habit by practice out of
experience, in the performance hereof, for the profit of mankind: Yet do I not
know ( let me speak it with patience of our cunning Arborists) any thing within
the compass of humane affairs so necessary, and so little regarded; not only
in Orchards, but also in all other Timber Trees, where, or whatsoever.

Now to our purpose:

How many Forests, and Woods, wherein you shall have for one lively thriving
Tree, four (nay sometimes twenty four) evil thriving, rotten and dying Trees,
even whiles they live; and instead of Trees, thousands of bushes and shrubs?
what rottenness? what hollownesse? what dead arms? withered tops? curtailed
trunks? what loads of Moss? drouping boughs: and dying branches shall you see
every where? and those that in this sort are in a manner all unprofitable
boughs, cankered arms, crooked, little and short boals. What an infinite
number of Bushes, Shrubs, and Skrags of Hasels, Thorns, and other unprofitable
wood, which might be brought by dressing to become great, and goodly Trees?
Consider now the Cause.

The lesser Wood has been spoiled with careless, unskilful, and untimely
slowing; and much also of the great Wood. The greater Trees at the first rising
have filled and overladen themselves with a number of wasteful boughs and
suckers, which have not only drawn the sap from the boal, but also have made
it knotty, and themselves, and the boal mossie, for want of dressing; whereas,
if in the prime of growth, they had been taken away close, all but one top, and
clean by the bulk, the strength of all the sap should have gone to the bulk,
and so he would have recovered, and covered his knots, and have put forth a
fair, long, and straight body, for Timber profitable, huge great of bulk, and
of infinite last.

If all Timber Trees were such (will some say) how should we have crooked wood
for Wheels, Coorbs, etc?

Answ. Dress all you can, and there will be enough crooked for those uses.

More than this; in most places they grow so thick, that neither themselves,
nor earth, nor any thing under or near them can thrive; nor Sun, nor Rain, nor
Air can do them, nor any thing near, or under them, any profit or comfort.

I see a number of Hags, where out of one root you shall see three or four (nay
more, such is men's unskillful greediness, who desiring many, have none good)
pretty Oaks, or Ashes straight and tall; because the root at the first shoot
gives sap amain: But if one only of them might be suffered to grow, and that
well, and cleanly pruned, all to his very top, what a Tree should we have in
time? And we see by those roots continually, and plentifully springing,
notwithstanding so deadly wounded, what a Commodity should arise to the Owner,
and the Commonwealth if wood were cherished, and orderly dressed. The waste
boughs closely, and skillfully taken away, would give us store of Fences and
Fuel; and the bulk of the Tree in time would grow of huge length and bigness:
But here (methinks) I hear an unskilful Arborist say, that Trees have their
several forms, even by Nature; the Pear, the Holly, the Aspe, etc. grow long in
bulk, with few and little Arms. The Oak by nature broad, and such like. All
this I grant: But grant me also, that there is a profitable end and use of
every Tree, from which if it decline (though by nature) yet Man by Art may (nay
must) correct it. Now other end of Trees I never could learn, than good Timber,
Fruit much and good, and pleasure: Uses Physical hinder nothing a good form.

Neither let any Man ever so much as think, that it is unprofitable, much less
unpossible, to reform any Tree of what kind soever: For (believe me) I have
tried it: I can bring any Tree (beginning betime) to any form. The Pear, and
Holly may be made spread, and the Oak to close.

Thus far the good Man out of his eight and forty years experience concerning
Timber Trees: He descends then to the Orchards; which because it may likewise
be acceptable to our industrious Planter, I thus contract.

6. Such as stand for Fruits should be parted from within two foot (or
thereabouts) of the earth; so high, as to give liberty to dress the Root, and
no higher; because of exhausting the sap that should feed his Fruit: For the
boal will be first, and best served and fed, being next to the root, and of
greatest substance. These should be parted into two, three, or four Arms, as
your graffs yield twigs; and every Arm into two, or more Branches, every Branch
into his several Cyons: still spreading by equal degrees; so as his lowest
spray be hardly without the reach of a man's hand, and his highest not past two
yards higher: That no twig (especially in the midst) touch his fellow; let
him spread as far as his list without any master-bough, or top, equally; and
when any fall lower then his fellows (as they will with weight of Fruit) ease
him the next spring of his superfluous twigs, and he will rise: When any mount
above the rest, top him with a nip between your fingers, or with a knife: Thus
reform any Cyon; and, as your Tree grows in stature, and strength, so let him
rise with his tops, but slowly, and easily; especially in the midst, and
equally in breadth also; following him upward, with lopping his under-growth,
and water-boughs, keeping the same distance of two yards, not above three, in
any wise, betwixt the lowest and highest twigs.

1. Thus shall you have handsome, clear, healthful, great and lasting Trees.

2. Thus will they grow safe from Winds, yet the top spreading.

3. Thus shall they bear much Fruit; I dare say, one as much as five of your
common Trees, all his branches laden.

4. Thus shall your Boal being low, defraud the branches but little of their
sap.

5. Thus shall your Trees be easy to dress, and as easy to gather the Fruit
from, without bruising the Cyons, etc.

6. The fittest time of the Moon for the Pruning is (as of Graffing) when the
sap is ready to stir (not proudly stirring) and so to cover the wound; and
here, for the time of day, we may take Columella, Frondem medio die arborator
ne caedito. l. 11. Old Trees would be pruned before young Plants: And note,
that wheresoever you take any thing away, the sap the next Summer will be
putting; be sure therefore when he puts to bud in any unfit place, you rub it
off with your finger: Thus begin timely with your Trees, and you may bring them
to what form you please. If you desire any Tree should be taller, let him
break, or divide higher: This for young Trees: The old are reformed by curing
of their diseases, of which we have already discoursed. There is this only to
be considered, in reference to Foresters, out of what he has spoken concerning
Fruit Trees; (that as has been touched) where Trees are planted for shadow, and
mere ornament, as in Walks, and Avenues, the Browse-wood (as they call it)
should most of it be cherished; whereas in Fruit, and Timber Trees ( Oak
excepted) it is best to free them of it: As for Pollards (to which I am no
great friend, because it makes so many scrags and dwarfes of many Trees which
would else be good Timber, endangering them with drips and the like injuries)
they should not be headed above once in ten or twelve years, at the beginning
of the Spring; or end of the Fall. And note, that all Copsing, and cutting
close, invigorates the Roots, and the stem of whatsoever grows weak and
unkindly; but you must then take care it be not overgrown with Weeds or Grass:
Nothing (says my Lord Bacon Exp. 586. and truly) causes Trees to last so long,
as the frequent Cutting; every such diminution being a re^invigoration of the
Plants juice, that it neither goes too far, nor rises too faintly, as when it is
not timely refreshed with this Remedy; and therefore we see, that the most
ancient Trees in Churchyards, and about Old Buildings, are either Pollards or
Dottards, seldom arising to their full altitude.

7. For the improvement of the speedy growth of Trees, there is not a more
excellent thing then the frequent rubbing of the Boal or Stem, with some piece
of hair-cloth, or ruder stuff, at the beginning of Spring: some I have known
done with Seals-skin; the more rugged bark with a piece of Coat of Maile, which
is made of small wyres; this done, when the body of the Trees are wet, as after
a soaking Rain; yet so, as not to excorticate, or gall the Tree, has
exceedingly accelerated its growth, (I am assured, to a wonderful and
incredible improvement) by opening the pores, freeing them of moss, and killing
the worm.

8. Lastly, Frondation or the taking off some of the luxuriant branches, and
sprays, of such Trees, especially whose leaves are profitable for Cattle
(whereof already) is a kind of pruning: and so is the scarifying, and cross
hatching of some Fruit-bearers, and others, to abate that (...) which spends
all the juice in the leaves, to the prejudice of the rest of the parts.

9. This, and the like, belonging to the care of the Wood-ward, will mind him
of his continual duty; which is to walk about, and survey his young Plantations
daily; and to see that all Gaps be immediately stopped; trespassing Cattle
impounded; and (where they are infested) the Deer chased out, etc. It is most
certain, that Trees preserved, and governed by this discipline, and according
to the Rules mentioned, would increase the beauty of Forests, and value of
Timber, more in ten, or twelve years, than all other imaginable Plantations
(accompanied with our usual neglect) can do in forty or fifty.

10. To conclude, in the time of this Work would our ingenious Arborator
frequently incorporate, mingle, and unite the Arms and Branches of some young,
and flexible Trees which grow in consort, and near to one another; by entering
them into their mutual barks with a convenient insition: This, especially,
about Fields, and Hedge-rows for Fence and Ornament; also by bowing, and
bending of others, especially Oak and Ash, into various flexures, curbs and
postures, obliged to ply themselves into different Modes, which may be done by
humbling and binding them down with tough bands and withs, or hooks rather, cut
Skrew-wise, or slightly hagled and indented with a knife, and so skrewed into
the ground, till the tenor of the sap, and custom of being so constrained, did
render them apt to grow so of themselves, without power of redressing; This
course would wonderfully accommodate Materials for Knee-timber and Shipping,
the Wheel-wright and other uses; conform it to their Moulds, and save infinite
labor, and abbreviate the work of hewing and waste, -- adeo in teneris
consuescere multum est. the Poet, it seems, knew it well, and for what
purposes, When in the woods with mighty force they bow
The Elm, and shape it to a crooked plow.

CHAP. XXX. Of the Age, Stature, and Felling of Trees.
1. IT is not till a Tree is arrived to his perfect Age, and full vigor,
Felling.
that the Lord of the Forest should consult, or determine concerning a Felling.
For there is certainly in Trees (as in all things else) a time of Increment, or
growth; a Status or season when they are at best (which is also that of
Felling) and a decrement or period when they decay. To the first of these they
proceed with more, or less velocity, as they consist of more strict and
compacted particles, or are of a slighter, and more laxed contexture; by which
they receive a speedier, or slower defluction of Aliment: This is apparent in
Box, and Willow; the one of a harder, the other of a more tender substance: But
as they proceed, so they likewise continue. By the state of Trees I would
signify their utmost effort, growth, and maturity, which are all of them
different as to time, and kind; yet do not I intend by this any period or
instant in which they do not continually either Improve or Decay (the end of
one being still the beginning of the other) but farther than which, their
Natures do not extend; but immediately (though to our senses imperceptibly)
through some infirmity (to which all things sublunary be obnoxious) dwindle and
impair, either through Age, defect of Nourishment, by sickness, and decay of
principal parts; but especially, and more inevitably, when violently invaded by
mortal and incurable Infirmities, or by what other extinction of their native
heat, substraction, or obstruction of Air and Moisture, which making all
motions whatsoever to cease and determine, is the cause of their final
destruction.

2. Our honest Countryman, to whose Experience we have been obliged for
something I have lately Animadverted concerning the Pruning of Trees, does in
another Chapter of the same Treatise, speak of the Age of Trees. The Discourse
is both learned, rational, and full of encouragement: For he does not scruple
to affirm, That even some Fruit Trees may possibly arrive to a thousand years
of Age; and if so Fruit Trees, whose continual bearing does so much impair and
shorten their lives, as we see it does their form and beauty; How much longer
might we reasonably imagine some hardy and slow-growing Forest-trees may
probably last; I remember Pliny tells us of some Oaks growing in his time in
the Hercynian Forest, which were thought co^evous with the World it self; their
roots had even raised Mountains, and where they encountered, swelled into
goodly Arches like the Gates of a City: But our more modern Author's
calculation for Fruit Trees (I suppose he means Pears, Apples. etc. his
allowance is three hundred years for growth, as much for their stand (as he
terms it,) and three hundred for their Decay, which does in the total amount to
no less than nine hundred years. This conjecture is deduced from Apple Trees
growing in his Orchard, which having known for forty years, and upon diligent
enquiry of sundry aged Persons of eighty years and more, who remembered them
Trees all their time, he finds by comparing their growth with others of that
kind, to be far short in bigness and perfection, ( viz. by more then two parts
of three) yea albeit those other Trees have been much hindered in their
stature, through ill government and mis-ordering.

3. To establish this, he assembles many Arguments from the age of Animals,
whose state and decay double the time of their increase by the same proportion:
If then (says he) those frail Creatures, whose bodies are nothing (in a
manner) but a tender rottenness, may live to that age; I see not but a Tree of
a solid substance, not damnified by heat or cold, capable of, and subject to
any kind of ordering or dressing, feeding naturally, and from the beginning
disburthen'd of all superfluities, eased of, and of his own accord avoiding the
causes that may annoy him, should double the life of other Creatures by very
many years. He proceeds, What else are Trees in comparison with the Earth, but
as hairs to the body of Man? And it is certain, that (without some distemper,
or forcible cause) the hairs dure with the body, and are esteemed excrements
but from their superfluous growth: So as he resolves upon good Reason, that
Fruit Trees well ordered, may live a thousand years, and bear Fruit; and the
longer the more, the greater, and the better (for which an Instance also in Dr.
Beale's Herefordshire Orchards, page 21, 22.) because his vigor is proud and
stronger, when his years are many. Thus shall you see old Trees put forth their
Buds and Blossoms both sooner, and more plentifully than young Trees by much;
And I sensibly perceive (says he) my young Trees to enlarge their Fruit as
they grow greater, etc. And if Fruit Trees continue to this Age, how many Ages
is it to be supposed strong and huge Timber Trees will last? whose massy
bodies require the years of diverse Methusela's before they determine their
days; whose Sap is strong and bitter; whose Bark is hard and thick, and their
substance solid and stiff; all which are defenses of health and long life.
Their strength withstands all forceable Winds; their Sap of that quality is not
subject to Worms and tainting; their Bark receives seldom or never by casualty
any wound; and not only so, but he is free from Removals, which are the death
of millions of Trees; whereas the Fruit-tree (in comparison) is little, and
frequently blown down; his Sap sweet, easily and soon tainted; his Bark tender,
and soon wounded; and himself used by Man, as Man uses himself; that is, either
unskilfully, or carelessly. Thus he. But Vossius de Theolog. Gent. l. 5. c. 5.
gives too little age to Ashes, when he speaks but of one hundred years; and to
the Medica, Pyrus, Prunus, Cornus but sixty: he had as good have held his
peace: Even Rosemary has lasted amongst us a hundred years.

4. I might to this add much more, and truly with sufficient probability, that
the Age of Timber Trees, especially of such as be of a compact, resinous, or
balsamical nature (for of this kind are the Eugh, Box, Horn-beam, White-thorn,
Oak, Walnut, Cedar, Juniper, etc.) are capable of very long duration and
continuance: Those of largest Roots (a sign of Age) longer lived than the
shorter; the dry than the wet; and the gummy, than the watery, sterile, than
the fruitful: For not to conclude from Pliny's Hercynian Oaks, or the
Terpentine Tree of Idumaea, (which Josephus ranks also with the Creation:) I
mentioned a Cypress yet remaining somewhere in Persia near an old Sepulcher,
whose stem is as large as five men can encompass, the boughs extending fifteen
paces every way; this must needs be a very old Tree, believed by my Author
little less then 2500. years of age: The particulars were too long to recount.
The old Platanus set by Agamemnon, mentioned by Theophrastus, and the Herculean
Oaks; the Laurel near Hippocren, the Vatican Ilex, the Vine which was grown to
that bulk and Woodinesse, as to make Columns in Juno's Temple: Pliny mentions
one of six hundred years old in his time; and at Eguan the late Duke of
Montmoramys house, is a Table of a very large dimention made of the same plant.
And the old Lotus Trees, recorded by Valerius Maximus, and the Quercus Mariana
celebrated by that Prince of Orators: Plinies huge Larix, and what grew in the
Fortunate Islands, with that enormous Tree Scaliger reports was growing in the
Troglodyfic India, etc. were famous for their age: Saint Hierome affirms he saw
the Sycomor that Zaccheus climbed up, to behold our LORD ride in Triumph to
Jerusalem: And now in the Aventine Mount they show us the Malus, Medica,
planted by the hand of Saint Dominic: In Congo they speak of Trees capable to
be excavated in Vessels that would contain two hundred men a piece. To which
add those superannuated Tilia's now at Basil, and that of Auspurg, under whose
prodigious shade they so often feast, and celebrate their Weddings; because
they are all of them noted for their reverend Antiquity; for to such Trees it
seems they paid Divine honors, as the nearest Emblems of Eternity, and tanquam
sacros ex vetustate, as Quintilian speaks: And like to these might that
Cypress be, which is celebrated by Virgil, near to another Monument.

5. But we will spare our Reader, and refer him that has a desire to multiply
examples of this kind, to those undoubted Records our Naturalist mentions in
his 44. Chap. Lib. 16. where he shall read of Scipio Africanus's Olive Trees;
Dianus Lotus, the Ruminal Fig Tree lasting (as Tacitus calculated 840 years:
The Ilix of prodigious antiquity, as the Hetruscian Inscription remaining on it
imported; But Pausanias in his Arcadics, thinks the Samian Vitex (of which
already) to be one of the oldest Trees growing, and the Platan set by Menelaus;
to these he adds the Delian Palm, co^evous with Apollo himself; and the Olive
planted by Minerva according to their tradition; the overgrown Myrtil; the
Vatican Holm, those of Tyburtine, and especially, that near to Tusculum, whose
body was thirty five foot about; besides diverse others which he there
enumerates in a large Chapter: And what shall we conjecture of the age of
Xerxes's huge Platanus, in admiration whereof he staid the march of so many
hundred thousand men for so many days; by which the wise Socrates was used to
swear? And certainly a goodly Tree was a powerful attractive, when that prudent
Consul, Passienus Crispus fell in love with a prodigious Beech of a wonderful
age and stature, and that wise Prince Francis the First, with an huge Oak,
which he caused to be so curiously immured at Bituriges.

6. We have already made mention of Tiberius's Larch, employed about the
Naumachiaria, which being of one hundred and twenty foot in length, bare two
foot diameter all that space, not counting the top: To this might be added the
Mast of Demetrius's Galeasse, which consisted of one Cedar. And that of the
Float which wasted Caligulas Obelisks out of Egypt, four fathoms in
circumference: We read also of a Cedar growing in the Island of Cyprus, which
was 130 foot long, and 18 in diameter; of the Plane in Athens, whose roots
extended 36 Cubits farther then the boughs, which were yet exceedingly large;
and such another was that most famous Tree at Veliternus, whose arms stretched
out 80 foot from the stem: But these were solid: Now if we will calculate from
the hollow besides those mentioned by Pliny, in the Hercynian Forest; the
Germans (as now the Indians) had of old some Punti or Canoes of excavated Oak,
which would well contain thirty, some forty persons: And the Lician Platanus
recorded by the Naturalist, and remaining long after his days, had a room in it
of eighty one feet in compass, adorned with Fountains, stately Seats and Tables
of stone; for it seems it was so glorious a Tree both in body, and head, that
Licinius Mutianus (three times Consul, and Governor of that Province) used to
feast his whole Retinue in it, choosing rather to lodge in it, then in his
golden-roofed Palace; And of later date, that vast Cerrus in which an Eremite
built his Cell and Chapel, so celebrated by the noble Fracastorius in his Poem
Malteide. Cant. 8. Stro. 30.

7. Compare me then with these, that nine-fathom'd-deep Tree spoken of by
Josephus a Costa; the Mastick-tree seen, and measured by Sir Francis Drake,
which was four and thirty yards in circuit; Those of Nicaragua and Gambra,
which 17 persons could hardly embrace. In India, (says Pliny) Arbores tantae
proceritatis traduntur, ut sagittis superari nequeant (and adds, which I think
material, and therefore add also) Haec facit ubertas soli, temperies caeli, and
Aquarum abundantia. Such were those Trees in Corsica, and near Memphis, etc.
recorded by Theophrastus, etc, and for prodigious height, the two and three
hundred foot unparalled Palms-royal described by Captain Ligon, growing in
our Plantations of the Barbados; or those goodly Masts of Fir, which I have
seen, and measured, brought from New England: and what Bembus relates of those
twenty-fathom'd Antartic-Trees; or those of which Cardan writes, called Ciba,
which rising in their several Stems each of twenty foot, in compass, and as far
distant each from other, unite in the bole at fifteen foot height from the
ground, composing three stately Arches, and thence ascending in a shaft of
prodigious bulk and altitude; Such Trees of 37 foot diameter (an incredible
thing) Scaliger (his Antagonist) speaks of ad Gambrae fluvium. Mathiolus speaks
of a Tree growing in the Island of Cyprus, which contained 130 foot high sound
Timber: And upon Mount Aetna in Sicily is a place called by them, the Ire
Castayne from three Chesnut-Trees there standing, where in the cavity of one
yet remaining, a considerable Flock of Sheep is commonly folded: Kerchers words
are these, as seen by himself, Et quod forsan (...) videri possit, ostendit
mihi viae dux, unius Castaneae Corticem tantae amplitudinis, ut inta eam
integer pecorum grex a pastoribus, tanquam in Caula, commodissima noctu
includeretur. China Illust. p. 185. And what may we conceive of those Trees in
the Indias, one of whose Nuts hardly one man is able to carry; and which are so
vast, as they depend not like other Fruit, by a Stalk from the boughs, but are
produced out of the very body and stem of the Tree, and are sufficient to feed
twenty persons at a meal.

We read of a certain Fig in the Caribby Islands, which emits such large
buttresses, that great Planks for Tables and Flooring are cleft out of them,
without the least prejudice to the Tree; and that one of these do easily
shelter 200 men under them: Strabo, I remember, Geog. l. 15. talks of fifty
Horsemen under a Tree in India; his words are (...), and of another that shaded
five stadia at once; and in another place of a Pine about Ida, which held 24
foot diameter, and of a monstrous height: But this, and all we have hitherto
produced, is nothing to what I find mentioned in the late Chineze History (as
it is set forth upon occasion of the Dutch Embassy) where they tell us of a
certain Tree called Ciennich (or the Tree of a thousand years) in the Province
of Suchu near the City Kien, which is so prodigiously large, as to shrowed 200
Sheep under one only branch of it, without being so much as perceived by those
who approach it. And to conclude with yet a greater wonder, of another in the
Province of Chekiang, whose amplitude is so stupendiously vast, as fourscore
persons can hardly embrace: not to omit the strange, and incredible bulk of
some Oaks standing lately in Westphalia, whereof one served both for a Castle
and Fort, and another there which contained in height 130 foot, and (as some
report) 30 foot diameter: I have read of a Table of Walnut-tree to be seen at
Saint Nicholas's in Lorraine, which held 25 foot broad, all of a piece, and of
competent length and thickness, rarely flek'd and watered; Scamozzi the
Architect reports he saw it: Such a monster, that might be, under which the
Emperor Fred. the third held his magnificent Feast 1472. For in this resention
we will endeavor to give a taste of more fresh observations, and to compare
our modern Timber with the Ancient, and that, not only abroad, but without
traveling into foreign Countries for these wonders.

8. What goodly Trees were of old adored, and consecrated by the Dryads I leave
to conjecture from the stories of our ancient Britains, who had they left
Records of their prodigies in this kind, would doubtless have furnished us
with examples as remarkable for the growth and stature of Trees, as any which
we have deduced from the Writers of foreign places, since the remains of what
are yet in being (notwithstanding the havoc which has universally been made,
and the little care to improve our woods) may stand in fair competition with
any thing that Antiquity can produce.

9. There is somewhere in Wales an Inscription extant, cut into the wood of an
old Beam, thus, SEXAGINTA PEDES FVERANT IN STIPITE NOSTRO, EXCEPTA COMA QVAE
SPECIOSA FVIT. This must needs have been a noble Tree, but not without later
parallels; for to instance in the several species, and speak first of the bulks
of some immense Trees; there was standing an old and decayed Chessnut at
Fraiting in Essex, whose very stump did yield thirty sizable load of Logs; I
could produce you another of the same kind in Glocestershire which contains
within the bowels of it a pretty wain-scotted Room inlighten'd with windows,
and furnished with seats, etc. to answer the Lician Platanus lately mentioned.

10. But whilst I am on this period; see what a Tilia that most learned, and
obliging person, D. Brown of Norwich, describes to me in a Letter just now
received.

An extraordinary large, and stately Tilia, Linden or Lime-tree, there grows
at Depeham in Norfolk, ten miles from Norwich, whose measure is this. The
compass in the least part of the Trunk or body about two yards from the ground
is at least eight yards and half: about the root nigh the earth, sixteen yards,
about half a yard above that, near twelve yards in circuit: The height to the
uppermost boughs about thirty yards, which surmounts the famous Tilia of Zurich
in Switzerland; and uncertain it is whether in any Tilicetum, or Lime-walk
abroad it be considerably exceeded: Yet was the first motive I had to view it
not so much the largeness of the Tree, as the general opinion that no man
could ever name it; but I found it to be a Tilia faemina; and ( if the
distinction of Bauhinus be admitted from the greater, and lesser leaf) a Tilia
Platyphyllos or Latifolia; some leaves being three inches broad; but to
distinguish it from others in the Country, I called it Tilia Colossaea
Depehamensis. Thus the Doctor.

A Poplar-tree not much inferior to this he informs me grew lately at Harlingly
Thetford, at Sir William Gawdies gate, blown down by that terrible Hurrocan
about four years since.

11. I am told of a very Withy-tree to be seen somewhere in Barkshire, which is
increased to a most stupendous bulk: But these for arriving hastily to their
Acme, and period, and generally not so considerable for their use; I pass to
the Ash, Elm, Oak, etc.

There were of the first of these diverse which measured in length one hundred
and thirty two foot, sold lately in Essex: and in the Manor of Horton (to go no
farther than the Parish of Ebsham in Surrey, belonging to my Brother Richard
Evelyn Esquire) there are Elms now standing in good numbers, which will bear almost
three foot square for more then forty foot in height, which is (in my
judgment) a very extraordinary matter. They grow in a moist Gravel, and in the
Hedge-rows.

Not to insist upon Beech, which are frequently very large; there are Oaks of
forty foot high; and five foot diameter yet flourishing in diverse old Parks of
our Nobility and Gentry.

A large and goodly Oak there is at Reedham in Sir Richard Berneys Park of
Norfolk, which I am informed was valued at forty pounds the Timber, and twelve
pounds the lopping wood.

12. Nor are we to over-pass those memorable Trees which so lately flourished
in Dennington Park near Newberry; amongst which, three were most remarkable
from the ingenious Planter, and dedication (if Tradition hold) of the famous
English Bard, Jeofry Chaucer; of which one was called the Kings, another the
Queens, and a third Chaucers Oak. The first of these was fifty foot in height
before any bough or knot appeared, and cut five foot square at the butt-end,
all clear Timber. The Queens was felled since the Wars, and held forty foot
excellent Timber, straight as an arrow in growth and grain, and cutting four
foot at the stub, and near a yard at the top; besides a fork of almost ten foot
clear timber above the shaft, which was crowned with a shady tuft of boughs,
amongst which, some were on each side curved like Rams-horns, as if they had
been so industriously bent by hand. This Oak was of a kind so excellent,
cutting a grain clear as any Clap-board (as appeared in the Wainscot which was
made thereof) that a thousand pities it is some seminary of the Acorns had not
been propagated, to preserve the species. Chaucers Oak, though it were not of
these dimensions, yet was it a very goodly Tree: And this account I received
from my most honored friend Phil. Packer Esquire whose Father (as now the
Gentleman his Brother) was proprietor of this Park: But that which I would
farther remark, upon this occasion is, the bulk, and stature to which an Oak
may possibly arrive within less then three hundred years; since it is not so
long that our Poet flourished (being in the Reign of King Edward the fourth) if
at least he were indeed the Planter of those Trees, as it is confidently
affirmed. I will not labor much in this enquiry; because an implicit faith is
here of great encouragement; and it is not to be conceived what Trees of a good
kind, and in apt soil, will perform in a few years; and this (I am informed) is
a sort of gravelly clay, moistn'd with small and frequent springs. In the mean
while, I have often wished, that Gentlemen were more curious of transmitting to
Posterity, such Records, by noting the years when they begin any considerable
Plantation; that the Ages to come, may have both the satisfaction, and
encouragement by more accurate and certain Calculations. I find a Jewish
tradition, cited by the learned Bochart, That Noah planted the Trees (he
supposes Cedars) of which he afterward built the Ark that preserved him. But
to proceed.

13. There was in Cuns-burrow (sometimes belonging to my Lord of Dover) several
Trees bought by a Couper, of which he made ten pound per yard for three or four
yards, as I have been credibly assured: But where shall we parallel that mighty
Tree which furnished the Mainmast to the Sovereign of our Seas, which being
one hundred foot long save one, bare thirty five inches diameter. Yet was this
exceeded in proportion, and use, by that Oak which afforded those prodigious
beams that lie thwart her. The diameter of this Tree was four foot nine inches,
which yielded apiece beams of four and forty foot long each of them. The
Oak grew about Framingam in Suffolk; and indeed it would be thought fabulous,
but to recount only the extraordinary dimensions of some Timber Trees growing
in that County; and of the excessive sizes of these materials, had not mine own
hands measured a Table (more then once) of above five foot in breadth, nine and
an half in length, and six inches thick, all entire and clear: This plank cut
out of a Tree felled down by my Fathers order, was made a Pastry board, and
lies now on a frame of solid Brick work at Wotton in Surrey, where it was so
placed before the room was finished about it, or wall built, and yet abated by
one foot shorter, to confine it to the intended dimensions of the place; for at
first, it held this breadth, full ten foot and an half in length. Mersennus
tells us that the Great Ship called the Crown, which the late French King
caused to be built, has its keel-timber 120 foot long; and the Mainmast 12
foot diameter at the bottom, and 85 in height.

14. To these I might add that superannuated Eugh tree growing now in Braburne
Churchyard, not far from Scots hall in Kent, which being 58 foot 11 inches in
the circumference, will bear near twenty foot diameter, as it was measured
first by my self imperfectly, and then more exactly for me, by order of the
Right Honorable Sir George Carteret, Vice-Chamberlain to his Majesty, and late
Treasurer of the Navy: not to mention the goodly planks, and other considerable
pieces of squared, and clear Timber, which I observed to lie about it, that had
been hewed, and sawn out of some of the Arms only, torn from it by impetuous
winds. Such another Monster I am informed is also to be seen in Sutton Church
yard, near Winchester: But these (with infinite others, which I am ready to
produce) might fairly suffice to vindicate, and assert our Proposition, as it
relates to modern examples, and sizes of Timber Trees, comparable to any of the
Ancients, remaining upon laudable and unsuspected Record; were it not great
ingratitude to conceal a most industrious, and no less accurate Account, which
comes just now to my hands from Mr. Halton, Auditor to the Right Honorable,
the most Illustrious, and Noble, Henry Lord Howard of Norfolk.

In Sheffield Lordship.
15. In the Hall Park, near unto Rivelin, The names of the persons who gave
intelligence of the particulars. Edw. Rawson.
stood an Oak which had eighteen yards without bough, or knot; and carried a
yard and six inches square at the said height, or length, and not much bigger
near the root: Sold twelve years ago for 11 li. Consider the distance of the
place, and Country, and what so prodigious a Tree would have been worth near
London.

In Firth's Farm within Sheffield Lordship, about twenty years since, a Tree
blown down by the wind, made, or would have made two Forge-hammer-beams, and in
those, and the other wood of that Tree, there was of worth, or made 50 li. and
Godfrey Frogat (who is now living) did often say, he lost 30 li. by the not
buying of it. Cap. Bullock.


A Hammer-beam is not less then 7 yards long, and 4 foot square at the barrel.

In Sheffield Park, below the Manor, a Tree was standing which was sold by one
Giffard (servant to the then Countess of Kent) for 2 li. 10 s. to one Nich.
Hicks; which yielded of sawn Wair fourteen hundred, and by estimation, twenty
Chords of wood.

A Wair is two yards long, and one foot broad, Ed. Morphy, Wood-ward.
sixscore to the hundred: so that, in the said Tree was 10080 foot of Boards;
which, if any of the said Boards were more then half-inch thick, renders the
thing yet more admirable.

In the upper end of Rivelin stood a Tree, called the Lords-Oak, of twelve
yards about, and the top yielded twenty one Chord, cut down about thirteen
years since.

In Sheffield Park, An. 1646. stood above 100 Trees worth 1000 li. and there
are yet two worth above 20 l. still note the place, and market.

In the same Park, about eight years ago, Ralph Archdall cut a Tree that was
thirteen foot diameter at the Kerf, or cutting place near the Root.

In the same Park two years since, Mr. Sittwell, with Jo. Magson did choose a
Tree, which after it was cut, and said aside flat upon a level ground, Sam.
Staniforth a Keeper, and Ed. Morphy, both on horseback, could not see over the
Tree one another Hat-crowns. This Tree was afterward sold for 20 li.

In the same Park, near the old foord, is an Oak-tree yet standing, of ten
yards circumference.

Jo. Halton.
In the same Park, below the Conduit Plain, is an Oak-tree which bears a top,
whose boughs shoot from the boal some fifteen, and some sixteen yards.

Then admitting 15 yards for the common, or mean extent of the boughs from the
boal, which being doubled is 31 yards; and if it be imagined for a diameter,
because the Ratio of the diameter to the circumference is 113/355 it follows
113.355. 31.97 44/113 yards which is the circumference belonging to this
diameter. Then farther it is demonstrable in Geometry, that half the diameter
multiplied into half the circumference produces the Area or quantity of the
Circle, and that will be found to be 754347/452 which is 755 square yards fere.
Then lastly, if a Horse can be limited to three square yards of ground to stand
on (which may seem a competent proportion of three yards long, and one yard
broad) then may 251 Horse be well said to stand under the shade of this Tree.
But of the more Northern Cattle certainly, above twice that number.
Worksopp-Park.
16. In this Park, at the corner of the Bradshaw-rail, lies the boal of an
Oak-tree which is twenty nine foot about, and would be found thirty, if it
could be justly measured; because it lies upon the ground; Kenhelm Homer.
and the length of this boal is ten foot, and no arm, nor branch upon it.

In the same Park, at the white gate, a Tree did stand that was from bough end
to bough end (that is, Jo. Magson. Geo. Hall.
from the extreme ends of two opposite boughs) 180 foot; which is witnessed by
Jo. Magson and Geo. Hall, and measured by them both.

Then because 180 foot, or 60 yards is the diameter; 30 yards will be the
semidiameter: And by the former Analogies 113.355 60.188 and 1.30 94.2827

That is, the Content of ground upon which this Tree perpendicularly drops, is
above 2827 square yards, which is above half an Acre of ground: And the
assigning three square yards (as above) for an Horse, there may 942 be well
said to stand in this compass.

In the same Park (after many hundreds sold, and carried away) there is a Tree
which did yield quarter-cliff bottoms that were a yard square: and there is of
them to be seen in Worksopp at this day, Jo. Magson.
and some Tables made of the said quarter-cliff likewise.

In the same Park, in the place there called the Hawks-nest, are Trees forty
foot long of Timber, which will bear two foot square at the top-end or height
of forty foot.

If then a square whose side is two foot, be inscribed in a Circle, the
proportions at that Circle are

feet
Diameter 2: 8284 Circumference 8: 8858 Area 6: 2831


And because a Tun of Timber is said to contain forty solid feet: one of these
Columns of Oak will contain above six Tun of Timber and a quarter: in this
computation taking them to be Cylinders, and not tapering like the segment of a
Cone.

Welbeek-Lane.
17. The Oak which stands in this Lane called Grindal Oak, has at these
several distances from the ground these Circumferences,

foot foot inch at 1 33: 01 at 2 28: 05 at 6 25: 07

The breadth is from bough-end to bough-end (i.) diametrically 88 foot; the
height from the ground to the top-most bough 81 foot [this dimension taken from
the proportion that a Gnomon bears to the shadow] there are three Arms broken
off and (...) and eight very large ones yet remaining, which are very (...)
good Timber.

88 foot is 29 yards, which being in this case admitted for the diameter of a
circle, the square yards in that circumference will be 676 fere; and then
allowing three yards (as before) for a beast, leaves 225 beasts, which may
possibly stand under this Tree.

But the Lords-Oak, that stood in Rivelin, was in diameter three yards, and
twenty eight inches; and exceeded this in circumference three feet, at one foot
from the ground.

Shire-Oak.
Shire-Oak is a Tree standing in the ground late Sir Tho. Hewets, Hen. Home^*
about a mile from Worksopp-Park, which drops into three Shires, viz. York,
Nottingham, and Derby, and the distance from bough-end to bough-end, is ninety
foot, or thirty yards.

This circumference will contain near 707 square yards, sufficient to shade 235
horse.
Thus far the accurate Mr. Halton.
18. Being informed by a person of credit, that an Oak in Sheffield-Park,
called the Ladies-Oak, felled, contained forty two Tun of Timber, which had
Arms that held at least four foot square for ten yards in length; the Body six
foot of clear Timber: That in the same Park one might have chosen above 1000
Trees worth above 6000 li. another 1000 worth 4000 li. and sic de caeteris: To
this M. Halton replies, That it might possibly be meant of the Lords-Oak
already mentioned to have grown in Rivelin: For now Rivelin it self is totally
destitute of that issue she once might have gloried in of Oaks; there being
only the Hall-Park adjoining, which keeps up with its number of Oaks. And as to
the computation of 1000 Trees formerly in Sheffield-Park worth 6000 li. it is
believed there were a thousand much above that value; since in what is now
enclosed, it is evident touching 100 worth a thousand pounds. I am informed
that an Oak (I think in Shropshire) growing lately in a Coppse of my Lord
Cravens, yielded 19 Tun and half of Timber, 2^ Cord of Firewood, 2 load of
Brush, and 2 load of Bark. And my worthy friend Leonard Pinckney Esquire late first
Clerk of his Majesty's Kitchen (from whom I received the first hints of many of
these particulars) did assure me, that one John Garland built a very handsome
Barn, containing five Baies, with Pan, Posts, Beams, Spars, etc. of one sole
Tree, growing in Worksopp-Park. I will close This with an Instance which I
greatly value, because it is transmitted to me from that honorable and noble
Person Sir Ed. Harley: I am (says he) assured by an Inquisition taken about 300
years since, that a Park of mine, and some adjacent Woods, had not then a Tree
capable to bear Acorns; Yet, that very Park I have seen full of great Oaks, and
most of them in the extremest Wane of decay. The Trunk of one of these Oaks
afforded so much Timber, as upon the place would have yielded 15 li. and did
completely seat with Waine-scot Pues a whole Church: You may please (says he,
writing to Sir Rob. Morray) to remember when you were here, you took notice of
a large Tree, newly fallen; When it was wrought up, it proved very hollow and
unsound: One of its cavities contayn'd two Hogs-heads of Water, Another was
filled with better stuff, Wax and Honey; Notwithstanding all defects, it
yielded, besides three Tun of Timber, 23 Cords of Wood: But my own Trees are
but Chips in comparison of a Tree in the Neighborhood, in which every foot
forward one with another, was half a Tun of Timber, It bore 5 foot square, 40
foot long; It contained 20 Tun of Timber, most of it sold for 20 s. per Tun;
besides that the Boughs afforded 25 Cords of Fuel-wood; This was called the
Lady-Oak: Is It not pity such goodly creatures should be devoted to Vulcane?
etc. So far this noble Gent. to which I would add Dirae, a deep Execration of
Iron-Mills, and I had almost said Iron-Masters too Quos ego; sed motos praestat
componere -- for I should never finish to pursue these Instances through our
once goodly Magazines of Timber for all uses, growing in this our native
Country, comparable (as I said) to any we can produce of elder times; and that
not only (though chiefly) for the encouragement of Planters, and Preservers of
one of the most excellent, and necessary Materials in the World for the benefit
of Man; but to evince the continued vigor of Nature, and to reproach the want
of Industry in this Age of ours; and (that we may return to the Argument of
this large Chapter) to assert the procerity, and stature of Trees from their
very great Antiquity: For certainly, if that be true, which is by diverse
affirmed concerning the Quercetum of Mambre (where the Patriarch entertained
his Angelical Guests) recorded by Eusebius to have continued till the time of
Constantine the Great, we are not too prejudicately, to censure what has been
produced for the proofs of their Antiquity; nor for my part, do I much question
the Authorities: But let this suffice; what has been produced being only an
historical speculation, of more encouragement happily then other use, but such as
was pertinent to the subject under consideration, as well as what I am about to
add concerning the Texture, and similar parts of the body of Trees, which may
also hold in shrubs, and other lignous plants; because it is both a curious,
and Rational account of their Anatomization, and worthy of the sagacious
Inquiry of that incomparably learned Person, Dr. Goddard, as I find it entered
amongst other of those precious Collections of this Illustrious Society.

19. The Trunk or bough of a Tree being cut transversely plain and smooth
shows several Circles or Rings more or less Orbicular, according to the
external figure, in some parallel proportion, one without the other, from the
center of the Wood to the inside of the Bark, dividing the whole into so many
circular spaces. These Rings are more large, gross, and distinct in color and
substance in some kind of Trees, generally in such as grow to a great bulk in a
short time, as Fir, Ash, etc, smaller or less distinct in those that either not
all, or in a longer time grow great; as Quince, Holly, Box, Lignum-vitae,
Ebony, and the like sad colored and hard woods; so that by the largeness, or
smallness of the Rings, the quickness, or slowness of the growth of any Tree
may perhaps at certainty be estimated.

These spaces are manifestly broader on the one side, then on the other,
especially the more outer, to a double proportion, or more; the inner being
near an equality.

It is asserted, that the larger parts of these Rings are on the South and
sunny side of the Tree (which is very rational and probable) insomuch, that by
cutting a Tree transverse, and drawing a diametre through the broadest and
narrowest parts of the Rings, a Meridian line may be described.

The outer spaces are generally narrower then the inner, not only in their
narrower sides, but also on their broader, compared with the same sides of the
inner: Notwithstanding which, they are for the most part, if not altogether,
bigger upon the whole account.

Of these spaces, the outer extremities in Fir, and the like woods, that have
them larger and grosser, are more dense, hard, and compact; the inner more soft
and spungy; by which difference of substance it is, that the Rings themselves
come to be distinguished.

According as the bodies and boughs of trees, or several parts of the same, are
bigger, or lesser, so is the number, as well as the breadth of the circular
spaces greater or less; and the like, according to the age, especially the
number.

It is commonly, and very probably asserted, that a Tree gains a new one every
year. In the body of a great Oak in the New-Forest, cut transversly even (where
many of the Trees are accounted to be some hundreds of years old) three, and
four hundred have been distinguished. In a Fir Tree, which is said to have just
so many rows of boughs about it, as it is of years growth, there has been
observed just one less, immediately above one row, then immediately below:
Hence some probable account may be given of the difference between the outer,
and the inner parts of the Rings, that the outermost being newly produced in
the Summer, the exterior superficies is condensed in the VVinter.

20. In the young branches and twigs of Trees there is a pith in the middle,
which in some, as Ash, and especially Elder, equals, or exceeds in dimensions
the rest of the substance, but waxes less as they grow bigger, and in the
great boughs and trunk scarce is to be found: This gives way for the growth of
the inward Rings, which at first were less than the outer (as may be seen in
any shoot of the first year) and after grow thicker, being it self absum'd, or
perhaps converted into VVood; as it is certain Cartilages or Gristles are into
bones (in the bodies of Animals) from which to sense they differ even as much
as pith from VVood.

These Rings or spaces appearing upon transverse Section (as they appear
eliptical upon oblique, and strait lines upon direct Section) are no other than
the extremities of so many Integuments, investing the whole Tree, and (perhaps)
all the boughs that are of the same age with any of them, or older.

The growth of Trees Augmentation in all dimensions is acquired, not only by
accession of a new Integument yearly, but also by the Reception of nourishment
into the Pores, and substance of the rest, upon which they also become thicker;
not only those toward the middle, but also the rest, in a thriving Tree: Yet
the principal growth is between the bark and body, by accession of a new
Integument yearly, as has been mentioned: Whence the cutting of the bark of
any tree or bough round about, will certainly kill it.

The bark of a Tree is distinguished into Rings, or Integuments no less than
the Wood, though much smaller or thinner, and therefore not distinguishable,
except in the thick barks of great old Trees, and toward the inside next the
wood; the outer parts drying and breaking with innumerable fissures, growing
wider and deeper, as the body of the Tree grows bigger, and mouldering away on
the out side.

Though it cannot appear by reason of the continual decay of it upon the
account aforesaid; yet it is probable, the bark of a Tree has had successively
as many Integuments as the wood; and that it does grow by acquisition of a new
one yearly on the inside, as the wood does on the outside; so that the chief
way, and conveyance of nourishment to both the wood and the bark, is between
them both.

The least bud appearing on the body of a Tree, does as it were make
perforation through the several Integuments to the middle, or very near; which
part is as it were, a Root of the bough into the body of the Tree; and after
becomes a knot, more hard then the other wood: And when it is larger,
manifestly showing it self also to consist of several Integuments, by the
circles appearing in it, as in the body: more hard, probably; because
straightened in room for growth; as appears by its distending, buckling, as it
were, the Integuments of the wood about it; so implicating them the more;
whence a knotty piece of wood is so much harder to cleave.

It is probable, that a Cience or Bud upon Graffing, or Inoculating, does, as
it were, Root it self into the stock in the same manner as the branches, by
producing a kind of knot. Thus far the accurate Doctor.

21. To which permit me to add only (in reference to the Circles we have been
speaking of) what another curious Inquirer suggests to us; namely, That they
are caused by the Pores of the wood, through which the Sap ascends in the same
manner as between the Wood and the Bark; and that in some Trees, the bark
adheres to the wood, as the Integuments of Wood cleave to one another, and may
be separated from each other as the bark from the outward-most; and being thus
parted, will be found on their outsides to represent the Color of the
outer-most, contiguous to the bark; and on the inner sides, to hold the Color
of the inner side of the bark, and all to have a deeper, or lighter hue on
their inner-side, as the Bark is on that part more or less tinged; which
tincture is supposed to proceed from the ascendent Sap. Moreover, by cutting
the branch, the ascending Sap may be examined as well as the Circles: It is
probable, the more frequent the Circles, the larger, and more copiously the
liquor will ascend into it; the fewer, the sooner descend from it. That a
Branch of three Circles cut off at Spring, the Sap ascending will be found at
Michaelmasse ensuing; cut again in the same branch, or another of equal
bigness, to have one more than it had at Spring; and either at Spring or Fall
to carry a Circle of Pricks next the bark, at other seasons a circle of wood
only next it. But here the Comparison must be made with distinction; for some
Trees do probably shoot new tops yearly till a certain period, and not after;
and some have perhaps their Circles in their branches decreased from their
Bodies to the extremity of the branch, in such Economy and Order; that (for
instance) an Apple Tree shoot of this year has one Circle of Pricks or wood
less, than the Graft of two years growth; and that of two years growth, may the
next year have one Circle more than it had the last year; but this only till
that Branch shoot no more Grafts, and then it is doubtful whether the outmost
twig obtain any more Circles, or remain at a stay, only nourished, not
augmented in the Circles. It would also be inquired, whether the Circles of
Pricks increase not till Midsummer and after, and the Circles of Wood from
thence, to the following Spring? But this may suffice, unless I should subjoyn.

22. The vegetative motion of Plants, with the diagrams of the Jesuit Kercher,
where he discourses of their stupendous Magnetisms, etc. could there any thing
material be added to what has already been so ingeniously inquired into:
therefore let us proceed to their Felling.

Felling.
23. It should be in this status, vigor and perfection of Trees, that a Felling
should be celebrated; since whiles our Woods are growing it is pity, and indeed
too soon; and when they are decaying, too late: I do not pretend that a man
(who has occasion for Timber) is obliged to attend so many ages ere he fell his
Trees; but I do by this infer, how highly necessary it were, that men should
perpetually be Planting; that so posterity might have Trees fit for their
service of competent, that is, of a middle growth and age, which it is
impossible they should have, if we thus continue to destroy our Woods, without
this providential Planting in their stead, and felling what we do cut down,
with great discretion, and regard of the future.

24. Such therefore as we shall perceive to decay are first to be picked out
for the Ax; and then those which are in their state, or approaching to it; but
the very thriving, and manifestly improving, indulged as much as possible. But
to explore the goodness and sincerity of a standing-Tree, is not the easiest
thing in the world; we shall anon have occasion to mention my L. Bacon's
Experiment to detect the hollownesse of Timber: But there is doubtless none
more infallible, than the boring it with a middling Piercer made Auger fashion,
and by frequent pulling out, and examining what substance comes along with it,
as those who bore the Earth to explore what Minerals the place is impregn'd
with, and as sound Cheeses are tasted: Some again there are who by digging a
little about the Roots will pronounce shrewdly concerning the state of a Tree;
and if they find him perished at the top (for Trees dye upward as Men do from
the feet) be sure the cause lies deep, for it is ever a mark of great decay in
the Roots. There is also a swelling Vein which discovers it self eminently
above the rest of the stem, though like the rest, invested with barks, and
which frequently circles about and embraces the tree, like a branch of Ivy,
which is an infallible indication of Hollownesse and hypocrisy within.

25. The time of the year for this destructive work is not usually till about
the end of April (at which season the bark does commonly rise freely) though
the opinions and practice of men have been very different: Vitruvius is for an
Autumnal fall; others advise December and January: Cato was of opinion trees
should have first born their fruit, or, at least, not till full ripe, which
agrees with that of the Architect: And though Timber unbarked be indeed more
obnoxious to the Worm, and to contract somewhat a darker hue (which is the
reason so many have commended the season when it will most freely strip) yet
were this to be rather considered for such trees as one would leave round, and
unsquar'd; since we find the wild Oak, and many other sorts, felled over late,
and when the sap begins to grow proud, to be very subject to the worm; whereas,
being cut about mid-Winter, it neither casts, rifts, nor twines; because the
cold of the Winter does both dry, and consolidate; whiles in spring, and when
pregnant, so much of the virtue goes into the leaves and branches: Happy
therefore were it for our Timber, some real Invention of Tanning without so
much Bark (as the Honorable Mr. Charles Howard has most ingeniously offered)
were become universal, that Trees being more early felled, the Timber might be
better seasoned and conditioned for its various Uses. But as the custom is, men
have now time to fell their Woods, even from Mid-winter to the spring; but
never any after the Summer Solstice.

26. Then for the Age of the Moon, it has religiously been observed; and that
Dianas presidency in Sylvis was not so much celebrated to credit the fictions
of the Poets, as for the Dominion of that moist Planet, and her influence over
Timber: For my part, I am not so much inclined to these Criticisms, that I
should altogether govern a Felling at the pleasure of this mutable Lady;
however there is doubtless some regard to be had, Nor is it in vain Sigus fall
and rise to note.
Nec frustra fignorum obitus speculamur, and ortus*


The Old Rules are these:

Fell in the decrease, or four days after conjunction of the two great
Luminaries; some the last quarter of it; or (as Pliny) in the very article of
the change, if possible; which happening (says he) in the last day of the Winter
Solstice, that Timber will prove immortal: At least should it be from the
twentieth to the thirtieth day, according to Columella: Cato four days after
the Full, as far better for the growth: But all viminious Trees silente Luna;
such as Sallies, Birch, Poplar, etc. Vegetius for Ship timber, from the
fifteenth to the twenty-fifth, the Moon as before; but never during the
Increase, Trees being then most abounding with moisture, which is the only
source of putrefaction: And yet it is affirmed upon unquestionable Experience,
that Timber cut at any season of the year, in the Old Moon, or last Quarter,
when the Wind blows Westerly; proves as sound, and good as at any other period
whatsoever; nay, all the whole Summer long, as in any Month of the Year; which
for that it may be of great use on some public emergencies, I thought fit to
communicate.

27. Then for the temper, and time of day: The Wind low, neither East nor West
(but West of the two) the East being most pernicious, and exposing it to the
worms; and for which the best cure is, the plentiful sobbing it in water;
neither in frosty, wet, or dewy weather; and therefore never in a Fore-noon.
Lastly, touching the species; Fell Fir when it begins to spring; not only
because it will then best quit its coat and strip; but for that they hold it
will never decay in water; which howsoever Theophrastus deduce from the old
Bridge made of this material over a certain River in Arcadia, cut in this
season, is hardly sufficient to satisfy our inquiry.

28. Previous to this work of Felling is the advice of our Countryman Markham,
and it is not to be rejected: Survey (says he) your Woods as they stand,
immediately after Christmas, and then divide the species in your mind; (I add
rather in some Note-Book, or Tablets) and consider for what purposes every
several kind is most useful, which you may find in the several Chapters of this
Discourse under every Head. After this, reckon the bad and good together, so as
one may put off the other, without being forced to glean your Woods of all your
best Timber. This done (or before) you shall acquaint your self with the
marketable prices of the Country where your Fell is made, and that of the
several sorts; as what so many inches or foot square and long is worth for the
several employments: What Planks, what other scantlings, for so many Spoaks,
Naves, Rings, Pales, Spars, etc. as suppose it were Ash, to set apart the
largest for the Wheel-wright, the smallest for the Cooper, and that of ordinary
scantling for the Ploughs, and the brush to be kidded, and sold by the hundred,
or thousand, and so all other sorts of Timber, viz. large, middling stuff, and
Poles, etc. allowing the waste for the charges of Felling, etc. all which you
shall compute with greater certainty, if you have leisure, and will take the
pains to examine some of the trees either by your own Fathom; or (more
accurately) by girting it about with a string, and so reducing it to the
square, etc. by which means you may give a near guess: or, you may mark such as
you intend to Fell; and then begin your sale about Candlemas till the Spring;
before which you must not (according as our Custom is) lay the Ax to the Root;
though some for particular employments, as for Timber to make Plows, Carts,
Axel-trees, Naves, Harrows, and the like Husbandry-tools, do frequently cut in
October.

Being now entering with your Workmen, one of the first, and most principal
things, is, the skilful disbranching of the Boal of all such Arms and Limbs as
may endanger it in the Fall, wherein much forecast and skill is required of the
Wood-man; so many excellent trees being utterly spoiled for want of this only
consideration: And therefore in arms of Timber, which are very great, chop a
nick under it close to the Boal, so meeting it with the downright strokes, it
will be severed without splicing.

29. Some there are who cut a kerf round the body, almost to the very pitch, or
heart, and so let it remain a while; by this means to drain away the moisture,
which will distill out of the wounded Veins, and is chiefly proper for the
moister sort of Trees: And in this work the very Ax will well tell you the
difference of the Sex; the Male being so much harder, and browner than the
Female: But here (and wherever we speak thus of Plants) you are to understand
the analogical, not proper distinction.

30. But that none may wonder why in many Authors of good note, we find the
Fruit-bearers of some Trees called Males, and not rather Females, as
particularly the Cypress, etc. This prepostrous denomination had I read it
sourse from very ancient Custom, and was first begun in Egypt ( Diodorus says
in Greece) where we are told, that the Father only was esteemed the sole
Author of Generation; the Mother contributing only Receptacle and Nutrition to
the Offspring, which legitimated their mixtures as well with their Slaves as
Free-women: And upon this account it was, that even Trees bearing Fruit, were
amongst them reputed Males, and the sterile and barren ones, for Females; and
we are not ignorant, how learnedly this doctrine has been lately revived by
some of our most celebrated Physicians: But since the same Arguments do not
altogether quadrate in Trees, where the Coition is not so sensible (whatever
they pretend of the Palms, etc. and other amorous intertwining of Roots) in my
opinion we might with more reason call that the Female which bears any eminent
Fruit or Seed, and them Males who produce none: But sometimes too the
rudeness, or less asperity of the leaves, bark, and grain, nay their Medical
operations, may deserve the distinction; to which Aristotle adds Branchinesse,
less moisture, quick maturity, etc. l. 1. de Pl. c. 3. All which seems to be
most conspicuous in Plum-trees, Hollys, Ashes, Quince, Pears, and many other
sorts; not to insist on such as may be compelled even to change, as it were,
their Sex by Graffing and artificial Improvements: But I only hint it, and
return to

31. Felling, which should be as close to the ground as possible may be, if you
design a renascency from the Roots; unless you will grub for a total
destruction, or the use of that part we have already mentioned, so far
superior in goodness to what is more remote from the Root, and besides the
longer you cut and convert the Timber, the better for many uses. Some are of
opinion, that the seedling Oak should never be cut to improve his boal;
because, say they, it produces a reddish wood not so acceptable to the Workman;
and that the Tree which grows on the head of his Mother does seldom prove good
Timber: It is observed, indeed, that one foot of Timber near the Root (though
diverse I know who otherwise opine) and (which is the proper kerfe, or cutting
place) is worth three farther off: And happily, the successor is more apt to be
tender, then what was cut off to give it place; but let this be inquired into
at leisure.

32. When your Tree is thus prostrate, strip off the bark; and set it so as it
may best dry; then cleanse the Boal of the branches which were left, and saw it
into lengths for the squaring, to which belongs the Measure, and Girth (as our
Workmen call it) which I refer to the Buyer, and to many subsidiary Books
lately Printed, wherein it is taught by a very familiar Calcule Mechanical and
easy Method.

33. But by none in my apprehension set forth, in a more facile and accurate
way than what that Industrious Mathematician Mr. Leybourn has Published, in his
late Line of Proportion made Easy, and other his Labors; where he treats as
well of the Square as the Round, as it is applicable to Boards and Superficials,
and to Timber which is hewed or less rough, in so Easy a Method, as nothing
can be more desired. I know our ordinary Carpenters, etc. have generally upon
their Rulers a Line, which they usually call Gunters-Line; but they few of
them, understand how to Work from it: And diverse Country Gentlemen, Stewards,
and Wood-men, when they are to Measure Rough Timber upon the Ground, confide
much to the Girt, which they do with a string at about four, or five foot
distance from the Root or Great Extreme: Of the Strings length, they take a
quarter for the true Square, which is so manifestly erroneous, that thereby
they make every tree so measured, more than a fifth part less than really it
is. This mistake would therefore be reformed; and it were (I conceive) worth
the Seller's while to inspect it accordingly: Their Argument is, That when the
Bark of a Tree is stripped, and the Body hewed to a Square, it will then hold
out no more measure; that which is cut off being only fit for Fuel, and the
Expense of Squaring costs more than the Chips are worth. But let us however
Convince them of this Error by confronting Mr. Leybourns Tables.

PROB. I.

A Tree being 68 Inches about, to find how much thereof in Length will make one
foot square.

SOL.

A fourth part of 60 Inches, is 15, which they take for the due Square;
wherefore look for 15 Inches ( viz. one foot three Inches) in the first Column
of the first Table, and opposite to it in the second Column, you shall find 7
Inches, 6 tenth parts of an Inch (which is somewhat above half an Inch) will
make one foot square. Again,

PROB. II.

A Tree being 136 Inches about, and 9 Foot in length, to know how many solid
Feet the Tree contains?

SOL.

The fourth part of 136 is 34 inches in the first Column of the second Table,
and 9 foot in the head of it; and opposite to the 34 inches, and under 9 foot,
you shall find 72.25. ( viz. 72 foot) and for so much you may sell it, and no
more, which is yet less than the true content by above a fifth part.

But supposing (as they ought to do) there were no such Waste as is pretended;
you will find by the third Table, how much in length of any Cylendrical Timber,
whose Girt is known, will make a foot solid, and consequently, detect the Error
of the former customary practice.

PROB. III.

A Tree being 60 Inches circumference, to know how much thereof will make a
cubical foot.

SOL.

Find 60 inches in the first Column; and opposite to it in the second Column,
you shall find 0-6-0 which is to say, 6 inches only: The Consectarie is, that
6 inches in length of a Tree 60 inches circumference, will make a foot solid:
Whereas by the other usual procedure, you found there must be 7 inches and
above half an inch, to make so much; which is above an inch and half too much
in every foots length, and what that amounts to in many feet it is easy to
imagine.

So suppose a Tree be but 29 inches in circumference, the same Table will in
like manner show, that it requires but 1 foot 2 inches and 3 tenth parts of an
inch in length, to make it a foot solid of Timber; and thus of any number as
far as you will enlarge your Table.

But then imagine that the sides of the square at the extremities of squared
Timber are unequal, as frequently it happens, by sometimes 5, 6, 10, or more
inches difference: Some Artificers think they encounter this well enough by
adding the two sides together, and taking the moitie of the side for the true
square: But this is as erroneous as the other; especially, if the sides differ
considerably. v. g. Let one side be 30 inches, and the other 138, these added,
make 213, the half whereof is 106, which they estimate for the true square;
whereas in truth, the right square is 74 inches, and one tenth part; which
demonstrates the error to be 32 inches and 4 tenths.

To reform therefore this egregious mistake, the fourth Table may be
calculated to what number of inches you desire: Example,

PROB. IV.

One side of a square of Timber containing 16 inches, and the other 25: to find
the side of a square equal unto it.

SOL.

First, find 16 inches in the fourth Table, opposite to it you have this number
120411. Then find out 25 inches, and opposite to that occurs 139794 which
added, produces 260205, and the half of it 130102. Find in the Table this
Number (or the nearest you can to it) and you will see it to stand against 20
inches; which is the true square of such an unequal'd-sided piece of Timber.

16 -- 120411 25 -- 139794 sum -- 260205 20 -- 130102
Note, In these Instances it is supposed the Tree measured to carry the same
Proportion of square throughout the Piece, which in almost all Trees that are
considerably long, does not hold, by reason of its continual tapering, which
must needs cause a great difference in the squares at either extreme. Our
common Workmen do, to adjust this, for the most part, choose the most likely
place about the middle of the Tree, and take its square there; But this is also
an Error: Therefore in such Trees, measure the square at both ends, and add the
sides of the two squares together, and half that length shall be the true
square which the Tree does carry throughout. E. g.

Suppose a Tree have that side of the square at the But-end 32 inches, and at
the smaller end 22 only; Those added, will make 55 inches, and the moitie of
that 27, which is the true side of the square, with which, and the length, you
may find by the second Table the just content.

And, in case your Tree be longer than the Table provides for (as for example
in this second Table it proceeds but to 10 foot) take the half, or so many
times 10 foot, as its length contains, and the odd feet, if they happen, by
themselves. V. g.

Suppose a Tree being 31 inches square, is 47 foot long; have recourse to 10
foot in the second Table, and opposite to 31 in the inch Column, you will find 64
foot, 60 parts under the Column 10: put this down as many times as any tens
occur in your 47 foot (which was the length of that Tree, and by the same Table
the odd 7 will give you 45 feet 22 parts, which sum'd together, amount to 303
feet, 62 parts, viz. half a foot and half a quarter of a foot. By this Method
proceed for any length whatsoever.

There remains but one operation more, which our Timber man can much stand in
need of direction in; and that is, for the Measure of Planks; because we have
occasion sometimes to saw them in the Wood: We will therefore add one Table
more of that, and so dismiss him.

PROB. V.

A Plank or Board being 9 inches broad: to find how much in length will make
one foot.

SOL.

First find out 9 inches in the first Column; opposite to that, in the second
Column, you shall meet 1.4.0. which imports 1 foot, 4 inches: so much then in
length of a Plank or Board 9 inches broad, must go to make a foot: So as every
16 inches in length, is a foot of Plank, and consequently, every 8 inches, half
a foot; every 4 inches a quarter, etc. Thus again, if a Board hold 2 foot and 3
inches in breadth; 5 inches and 3 tenth parts of an inch in length will make a
square superficial foot of Plank, and sic de caeteris.

34. If you are to remove your Timber, let the Dew be first off, and the
South Wind blow before you draw it: neither should you by any means put it to
use for three, or four months after, unless great necessity urge you, as it did
Duilius, who in the Punic War built his Fleet of Timber before it was seasoned,
being not above two months from the very Felling to the Launching: and as were
also those Navies of Hiero after forty days; and that of Scipio, in the third
Carthaginean War, from the very Forest to the Sea. July is a good time for
bringing home your felled Timber: But concerning the Time and Season of
Felling, a just Treatise might be written: Let the Learned therefore consult
Vitruvius particularly on this subject. l. 2. c. 19. Also M. Cato c. 17. Plin.
l. 16. c. 31. Constantinus and Heron. l. 3. de RR. Veget. l. 4. c. 35.
Columella l. 3. c. 2. but especially the most ample Theophrastus (...). l. 5.
Note, that a Tun of Timber is forty solid Feet, a Load fifty.

35. To make excellent Boards and Planks, it is the advice of some, you should
Bark your Trees in a fit season, and so let them stand naked a full year before
the felling; and in some cases, and grounds, it may be profitable: But let
these, with what has been already said in the foregoing Chapters of the several
kinds, suffice for this Article: I shall add one Advertisement of Caution to
those Noble persons, and others who have Groves and Trees of ornament near
their houses, and in their Gardens in London, and the Circle of it; especially,
if they be of great stature, and well grown; such as are the Groves in the
several Inns of Court; nay, even that (comparatively, new Plantation) in my
Lord of Bedfords Garden, etc. and wherever they stand in the more interior
parts of the City; that they be not over hasty, or by any means persuaded to
cut down any of their old Trees, upon hope of new more flourishing Plantations;
thickning, or repairing deformities; because they grew so well when first they
were set: It is to be considered how exceedingly that pernicious smoke of the
Sea-coal is increased in, and about London since they were first planted, and
the buildings environing them, and enclosing it in amongst them, which does so
universally contaminate the Air, that what Plantations of Trees shall be now
begun in any of those places, will have much ado, great difficulty, and require
a long time, to be brought to any tolerable perfection: Therefore let them make
much of what they have; and though I discourage none, yet I can animate none to
cut down the old.

36. And here might now come in a pretty speculation, what should be the Reason
after general Fellings and Extirpations of vast Woods of one species, the next
spontaneous succession should be of quite a different sort? We see indeed
something of this in our Gardens and Corn fields (as the best of Poets
witnesses) but that may be much imputed to the alteration, by improvement, or
detriment of the Soil and other Accidents: whatever the Cause may be, since it
appears not in any universal decay of Nature (sufficiently exploded) I shall
only here produce matter of Fact, and that it ordinarily happens. As in some
goodly Woods formerly belonging to my Grandfather that were all of Oak; after
felling, they universally sprung up Beech; and it is affirmed by general
Experience, that after Beech, Birch succeeds; as in that famous Wood at Darnway
on the River Tindarne in the Province of Moray in Scotland, where nothing had
grown but Oak in a Wood three miles in length, and happily more Southerly, it
might have been Beech, and not Birch 'till the third degradation. Birches
familiarly grow out of old and decayed Oaks; but whence this Sympathy and
affection should proceed, is more difficult to resolve, in as much as we do not
detect any so prolifical, and eminent Seed in that Tree. Some Accidents of this
nature may be imputed to the Winds, and the Birds who frequently have been
known to waste and convey Seeds to places widely distant, as we have touched in
the Chapter of Firs, etc. Sect. 4. Holly has been seen to grow out of Ash, as
Ash out of several Trees, especially Hei-Thorn; nay, in an old rotten
Ash-stump, in a place where no Ashes at all grew by many miles in the whole
County: And I have had it confidently asserted by Persons of undoubted truth,
that they have seen a Tree cut in the middle, whose heart was Ash-wood, and the
exterior part Oak, and this in Northamptonshire: And why not as well (though
with something more difficulty?) as through a Willow, whose Body it has been
observed to penetrate even to the Earth? obtruding the Willow quite out of its
place, of which a pretty Emblem might be conceived: But I pursue these
Instances no farther, concluding this Chapter with the Norway Engine, or
Saw-Mill, to be either moved with the force of Water, or Wind, etc. for the
more expedite cuting and converting of Timber, to which we will add another,
for the more facile perforation and boring of Elms, or other Timber to make
Pipes and Aquaeducts, and the excavating of Columns to preserve their Shafts
from splitting, to which otherwise they are obnoxious.

The Frames of both these Instruments discover themselves sufficiently to the
eye, and therefore will need the less description; There is yet this
reformation from those which they use both in Norway and Switzerland; That
whereas they make the Timber approach the Sawes, by certain indented Wheels
with a Rochet (which is frequently out of order) there is in the first Figure a
substitution of two Counterpoises of about three hundred pound weight, each, as
you may see at A.A. fastening the Cords to which they append, at the extremes of
two movable pieces of Timber, which slide on two other pieces of fixed Wood, by
the aid of certain small Pullys, which you may imagine to be within an Hinge in
the House or Mill, by which means the Weights continually draw, and advance the
moving pieces of Wood, and consequently the Timber to be slit, fastened 'twixt
the said Pieces, toward the Teeth of the Saws, rising, and falling as the
motion of the Wheel directs; And on this Frame you may put four or five Saws,
or more if you please, and place them at what intervals you think fit,
according to the dimensions which you design in cutting the Timber for your
use; and when the piece is sawn, then one or two men with a Lever, must turn a
Roller, to which there is annexed a strong Cord, which will draw back the Piece,
and lift up the Counter-poise; and so the piece put a little toward one side,
direct the Saws against another.

The second Figure for Boring, consists of an Ax-tree, to which is fastened a
Wheel of six and thirty Teeth, or more, as the velocity of the Water-motion
requires; for if it be slow, more Teeth are requisite; There must also be a
Pinion of six, turned by the said indented Wheel: Then to the Ax-tree of the
Pinion is to be fixed a long Auger, as in letter A, which must pass through the
hole B, to be opened and closed as occasion requires, somewhat like a Turners
Lathe: The Tree or piece of Timber to be Bored, is to be placed on the Frame
CD, so as the Frame may easily slide by the help of certain small Wheels, which
are in the hollow of it, and turn upon strong Pins, so as the Workman may
shove forwards, or draw the Tree back, after it is fastened to the Frame; that so
the Auger turning, the end of the Tree may be applied to it; still remembering
to draw it back at every progress of three or four inches which the Auger
makes for the clensing it from the Chips, least the Auger break: Continue this
work till the Tree, or piece of Timber be bored as far as you think convenient,
and when you desire to enlarge the hole, change your Auger Bits as the Figure
represents them.



To these we might add several more, as they are described by Besson, Ramelli,
Cause, and others; as likewise Cranes and Machines for the easier Elevation,
Moving, and Transporting of Timber, but they are now become familiar, and
therefore I omit them.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Timber the Seasoning and Uses, and of Fuel.
Seasoning.
SInce it is certain and Demonstrable that all Arts and Artisans whatsoever,
must fail and cease, if there were no Timber and Wood in a Nation (for he that
shall take his Pen, and begin to set down what Art, Mystery, or Trade
belonging any way to human life, could be maintained and exercised without
Wood, will quickly find that I speak no Paradox) I say, when this shall be well
considered, it will appear, that we had better be without Gold, than without
Timber: This contemplation, and the universal use of that precious Material
(which yet is not of universal use 'till it be duly prepared) has moved me to
design a solemn Chapter for the seasoning, as well as to mention some farther
particular Applications of it. We have before spoken concerning some
preparations of standing Trees designed for Timber, by a half-cutting,
disbarking, and the seasons of drawing, and using it.

2. Lay up your Timber very dry, in an airy place (yet out of the Wind or Sun)
and not standing upright, but lying along one piece upon another, interposing
some short blocks between them, to preserve them from a certain mouldinesse
which they usually contract while they sweat, and which frequently produces a
kind of fungus, especially if there be any sappy parts remaining.

3. Some there are yet, who keep their Timber as moist as they can, by
submerging it in Water, where they let it imbibe to hinder the cleaving; and
this is good in Fir, both for the better stripping and seasoning; yea, and not
only in Fir, but other Timber: lay therefore your Boards a Fortnight in the
Water, and then setting them upright in the Sun and Wind, so as it may freely
pass through them, (especially during the heats of Summer, which is the time
of finishing Buildings) turn them daily; and thus treated, even newly sawn
Boards, will Floor far better than a many years dry Seasoning, as they call it.
But to prevent all possible accidents, when you lay your Floors, let the joints
be shot, fitted, and tacked down only for the first year, nailing them for good
and all the next; and by this means they will lie Stanch, close, and without
Shrinking in the least, as if it were all of one piece. Amongst Wheele-Wrights
the Water- seasoning is of especial regard, and in such esteem amongst some,
that I am assured the Venetians for their Provision in the Arsenal, lay their
Oak some years in it, before they employ it.

Elm felled never so green for sudden use, if plunged four or five days in
water (especially Salt, which is best) obtains an admirable seasoning, and may
immediately be used. Some again commend buryings in the Earth; others in wheat;
and there be seasonings of the fire, as for the scorching and hardening of Piles
which are to stand either in the water, or the earth; -- The Oak
Explore, suspended in the Chimney smoke.
Et suspensa focis exploret robora fumus.

Georg. ^. For that to most Timber it contributes much to its duration. Thus do
all the Elements contribute to the Art of Seasoning. The Learned Interpreter of
Antonio Neris Art of Glass c. 5. speaking of the Difference of Vegetables, as
they are made use of at various seasons, observes from the Button-mould-makers
in those woods they use, that Pear Trees cut in Summer work toughest, but Holly
in the VVinter, Box hardest about Easter, but mellow in Summer, Hawthorn kindly
about October, and Service tree in the Summer.

4. And yet even the greenest Timber is sometimes desirable for such as Carve
and Turn; but it choaks the teeth of our Saws; and for Doors, Windows, Floors,
and other close Works, it is altogether to be rejected; especially, where
VVallnut-tree is the material, which will be sure to shrink: Therefore it is
best to choose such as is of two, or three years seasoning, and that is neither
moist nor over-dry; the mean is best. Sir Hugh Plat informs us that the
Venetians use to burn, and scorch their timber in a flaming fire, continually
turning it round with an Engine, till they have gotten upon it an hard, black,
coaly crust; and the Secret carries with it great probability; for that the
Wood is brought by it to such a hardness and dryness, ut cum omnis
putrifactio incipiat ab humido, nor Earth, nor Water can penetrate it; I my
self remembering to have seen Charcoals dug out of the ground amongst the ruins
of ancient Buildings, which have in all probability lain covered with earth
above 1500 years.

5. Timber which is cleft, is nothing so obnoxious to rift and cleave as what
is hewn; nor that which is squared, as what is round; and therefore where use
is to be made of huge and massy Columns, let them be boared through from end
to end; it is an excellent preservative from splitting, and not
un-philosophical; though to cure this accident, the rubbing them over with a
wax-cloth is good, Painters Putty, etc. or before it be converted, the smearing
the timber over with Cow Dung, which prevents the effects both of Sun and Air
upon it; if of necessity it must lie exposed: But besides the former remedies,
I find this, for the closing of the chops and clefts of Green-timber, to anoint
and supple it with the fat of powdered beef-broth, with which it must be well
soaked, the chasm's filled with spunges dipped into it; this, to be twice done
over: Some Carpenters make use of grease and sawdust mingled; but the first is
so good a way (says my Author) that I have seen Wind-shock-timber so
exquisitely closed, as not to be discerned where the defects were: This must be
used when the timber is green.

6. We spoke before of Squaring, and I would now recommend the Quartering of
such trees as will allow useful and competent Scantlings, to be of much more
durablenesse, and effect for strength, than where (as custom is, and for want
of observation) whole Beams and Timbers are applied in Ships or Houses, with
slab and all about them, upon false suppositions of strength beyond these
Quarters: For there is in all trees an evident Interstice or separation between
the heart and the rest of the body, which renders it much more obnoxious to
decay and miscarry, than when they are treated, and converted as I have
described it; and it would likewise save a world of Materials in the Building
of great Ships, where so much excellent timber is hewed away to spoil, were it
more in practice. Finally,

7. I must not omit to take notice of the coating of timber in Work, used by
the Hollanders for the preservation of their Gates, Port-cullis's,
Draw-bridges, Sluices, and other huge beams and Contignations of timber exposed
to the Sun, and perpetual injuries of the Weather, by a certain mixture of
Pitch and Tar, upon which they strew small pieces of Cockle and other shells,
beaten almost to powder, and mingled with Sea-sand, or the Scales of Iron,
beaten small and siefted, which incrusts, and arms it after an incredible
manner against all these assaults and foreign invaders: But if this should be
deemed more obnoxious to Fireing, I have heard that a Wash made of Alume, has
wonderfully protected it against the assaults even of that devouring Element,
and that so a wooden Tower or Fort at the Piraeum an Athenian Port, was
defended by Archelaus a Commander of Mithridates, from the great Sylla.

8. Timbers that you have occasion to lay in Mortar, or which is in any part
contiguous to Lime, as Doors, Window-Cases, Ground-sils, and the extremities of
Beams, etc. should be cap'd with molten Pitch, which will be a mavelous
preserver of it from the burning, and destructive effects of the Lime; and in
defect of Pitch, Loam, or Clay will prove a tolerable defense.

9. For all uses, that Timber is esteemed the best, which is the most pondrous,
and which lying long, makes deepest impression in the Earth, or in the Water
being floated; also what is without knots, yet firm, and free from sap; which
is that fatty, whiter, and softer part, called by the Ancients Alburnum, which
you are diligently to hew away; here we have much ado about the Porulus of the
Fir, and the (...) by both Vitruvius and Theophrastus, which I pass over. You
shall perceive some which has a spiral convolution of the veins; but it is a
vice proceeding from the severity of unseasonable Winters, and defect of good
nutriment.

10. My Lord Bacon Exp. 658. recommends for trial of a sound or knotty piece of
Timber, to cause one to speak at one of the Extremes to his Companion listening
at the other; for if it be knotty, the sound says he, will come abrupt.

11. Moreover, it is expedient that you know which is the Grain, and which are
the Veins in Timber (whence the term fluviari arborem) because of the
difficulty of working against it: Those therefore be the veins which grow
largest, and are softer for the benefit of Cleaving, and Hewing; that the Grain
or Pectines which runs in waves, and makes the diverse and beautiful chamfers
which some woods abound in to admiration. The Grain of Beech runs two contrary
ways, and is therefore to be wrought accordingly.

12. Here it may be fitly inquired, whether of all the sorts we have
enumerated, the old, or the younger Trees do yield the fairest Color, pleasant
Grain and Gloss for Wainscot, Cabinets, Boxes, Gun-stocks, etc. and what kind
of Pear and Plum-tree give the deepest Red, and approaches nearest in beauty to
Brasil: It Is affirmed the Old-Oake, Old Walnut, and young-Ash, are best for
most uses; black, and thorny Plum-tree is of the deepest, Oriency; but whether
these belong to the Forest, I am not yet satisfied, and therefore have assigned
them no Chapter apart.

13. I would also add something concerning what VVoods are observed to be most
sonorous for Musical Instruments: We as yet detect few but the German Fir,
which is a species of Maple, for the Rimms of Viols, and the choicest and
finest grained Fir for the Bellyes: The finger-boards, Back, and Ribbs, I have
seen of Eugh, Pear Tree, etc. But Pipes, Recorders, and wind-Instruments, are
made both of hard, and soft woods; I had lately an Organ with a set of
Oaken-pipes, which were the most sweet and mellow that were ever heard; It was
a very old Instrument, and formerly, I think, belonging to the Duke of Norfolk.

14. For the place of growth, that Timber is esteemed best which grows most in
the Sun, and on a dry and hale ground; for those trees which suck, and drink
little, are most hard, robust, and longest lived, instances of Sobriety; The
Climate contributes much to its quality, and the Northern situation is
preferred to the rest of the quarters; so as that which grew in Tuscany was of
old thought better than that of the Venetian side; and trees of the wilder
kind, and barren, than the over much cultivated, and great bearers: but of this
already.

15. To omit nothing, Authors have sum'd up the natures of timber; as the
hardest Ebeny, Box, Larch, Lotus, Terebinth, Cornus, Eugh, etc. which are best
to receive politure; and for this, Lin-seed, or the sweeter Nut oil does the
effect best: Pliny gives us the Receipt, with a decoction of VValnut-shales,
and certain wild pears: Next to these, Oak for Ships, and Houses (or more
minutely) the Oak for the Keel, the Robur for the Prow, VValnut the Stern, Elm
the Pump; Furnerus l. 1. c. 22. conceives the Ark to have been built of several
woods; Cornel, Holly, etc. for Pins, Wedges, etc. Chessnut, Hornbeam Poplar,
etc. Then for Bucklers, and Targets, were commended the more soft and moist;
because apt to close, swell, and make up their wounds again; such as Willow,
Lime, Birch, Alder, Elder, Ash, Poplar, etc.

The Robur, or Wild-Oak Timber, best to stand in ground; the Quercus without:
The Cypress, Fir, Pines, Cedar, etc. for Posts, and Columns, because of their
erect growth, natural and comely diminutions. Then again it is noted, that
Oriental Trees are hardest toward the Cortex or Bark; our Western toward the
middle, which we call the Heart; and that Trees which bear fruit, or but
little, are more durable than the more pregnant. It is noted, of Oak, that the
knots of an inveterate Tree, just where a lusty arm joins to the Stem, is as
curiously vein'd as the Wall-nut, which omitted in the Chapter of the Oak, I
here observe.

Pines, Pitch, Alder, and Elm, are excellent to make Pumps and Conduit-pipes,
and for all Waterworks, etc. Fir for Beams, Bolts, Bars; being tough, and not
so apt to break as the hardest Oak: In sum, the more odoriferous Trees are the
more durable and lasting.

16. Here farther for the uses of timber, I will observe to our Reader some
other Particulars for direction both of the Seller and Buyer, applicable to the
several Species: And first of the two sorts of Lathes allowed by Statute, one
of five, the other of four foot long, because of the different Intervals of
Rafters: That of five has 100 to the Bundle, those of four 120; and to be in
breadth 1 Inch and, and half Inch thick; of either of which sorts there are
three, viz. Heart-oak, Sap-Lathes, and Deal-Lathes, which also differ in Price:
The Heart-oak are fittest to lie under tyling, the second sort, for plastring
of side-walls, and the third for Ceilings, because they are straight and even.

17. Here we will gratify our curious Reader with as curious an Account of the
Comparative strength and fortitude of the several usual sorts of timber, as
upon Suggestions previous to this Work, it was several times Experimented by
the Royal Society, though omitted in the first Impression, because the trials
were not complete as they now thus stand in our Register.

March 23. 1663.
The Experiment of breaking several sorts of Wood was begun to be made: And
there were taken three pieces of several kinds; of Fir, Oak, and Ash, each an
Inch thick, and two foot long, the Fir weighed 81/16 Ounces, and was broken
with 200 l. weight: The Oak weighed 12 (...), broken with 250 weight: the Ash
weighed 10 (...), broken with 325 weight.

Besides there were taken 3 pieces of the same sorts of wood each of inch
thick, and 1 foot long: the Fir weighed j(...), and was broken with of an 100:
The Oak weighed 1 (...) broken with of an 100: the Ash weighed 1 (...) broken
with 100 l.

Again, there was a piece of Fir Inch square, and two foot long, broken with 33
l. A piece of Inch thick 1 Inch broad, and 7 foots long, broken with 100 weight
edge-wise; And a piece of inch thick, 1 broad, 2 foot long, broken with 125
weight, also edge-wise.

The Experiment was ordered to be repeated by the President, to Sr. William
Petty, and Mr. Hook; and it was suggested by some of the Company, that in these
trials consideration might be had of the age, knottinesse, solidity, several
Soyls, and parts of trees, etc. and Sr. Robert Morray did particularly add,
that it might be observed how far any kind of Wood bends before it breaks.

March -- 64.
The Operator gave an Account of more pieces of wood broken by weight, viz. a
piece of Fir 4 foot long 2 Inches, 53 Ounce weight, broken with 800 l. weight,
and very little bending with 750; by which the Hypothesis seems to be
confirmed, that in similar pieces, the Proportion of the breaking-weight is
according to the basis of the wood-broken: Secondly, of a piece of Fir 2 foot
long, 1 Inch square, cut away from the middle both ways to half an Inch, which
supported 250 l. weight before it broke, which is more by 50 l. than a piece of
the same thickness every way was formerly broken with; the difference was
guessed to proceed from the more firmness of this other piece.

His Lordship was desired to contribute to the Prosecution of this Experiment,
and particularly, to consider what line a Beam must be cut in, and how thick it
ought to be at the Extreme, to be equally strong: Which was brought in April
13, but I find it not entered.

April 20. 1664.
The Experiment of breaking VVood was prosecuted, and there were taken two
pieces of Fir, each two foot long, and 1 Inch square, which were broken, the
one long-wayes with 300 l. weight, the other transverse-wayes with 2 hundred:
Secondly, two pieces of the same wood, each of of an Inch square, and two foot
long, broken, the one long ways with 1 hundred; the other transverse with 100
l. weight: Thirdly, one piece of 2 foot long Inch square, broken longwayes with
81 l. Fourthly, one piece cut out of a crooked Oken-billet, with an arching
Grain, about Inch square, two foot long, broken with hundred.

June 29. 1664.
There were made several Experiments more of breaking wood: First, a piece of
Fir Inch diameter, and 3 Inches long, at which distance the weight hung, broke
in the Plane of the Grain horizontally, with 66 l. whereof 15 l. Troy;
Vertically, with 2 l. more. Also Fir of a Inch diameter, and 1 Inch long, broke
vertically with 20 l. and horizontally, with 19 l. Elm of Inch diameter, and
three inches long, broke horizontally, with 47 l. Vertically with 23 l. Elm of
inch diameter, and 1 Inch long, broke horizontally with 12 l. Vertically with
10 l. which is Note-worthy.

July 6. 1664.
The Experiment of breaking Woods prosecuted: A piece of Oak of Inch diameter
and three Inches long, at which distance the weight hung, broke horizontally
with 48 l. Vertically with 40 l. Ash of Inch diameter, and 3 Inch long,
horizontally with 77 l. Vertically, with 75 l. Ash of Inch diameter, and 1 Inch
long, horizontally with 19 l. Vertically, with 12 l. etc. Thus far the Register.

18. Here might come in the Problemes of Cardinal Cusa in Lib. 4. Idiotae dial.
4 to concerning the different velocity of the Ascent of great pieces of Timber,
before the smaller, submerged in water; as also of the weight; as v. g. Why a
piece of Wood 100 l. weight, poising more in the Air than 2 l. of Lead, the 2
l. of Lead should seem to weigh (he should say Sink) more in the Water? Why
Fruits being cut off from the Tree, weigh heavier, than when they were growing?
with several the like Paradoxes, happily more curious than useful, and therefore
we purposely omit them.

the legal Proportions, and which Builders ought not to vary from.

But Carpenters also work by Square, which is 10 foot in Framing and Erecting
the Carcass (as they call it) of any Timber Edifice, which is valued according
to the goodness and choice of the Materials, and curiosity in Framing;
especially Roofs and Stayre-cases, which are of most charges. And here might
also something be added concerning the manner of framing the Carcases of
Buildings, as of Floors, pitch of Roofs, the length of Hips, and Sleepers,
together with the names of all those several Timbers used in Fabrics totally
consisting of Wood; but I find it done to my hand, and Published some years
since, at the end of a late Translation of the first Book of Palladio, to which
I refer the Reader. And to accomplish our Artist in Timber, with the utmost
which that material is capable of; to the Study and Contemplation of that
stupendous Roof, which now lies over the ever renowned Sheldonean Theater at
the University of Oxford; being the sole Work and Contrivement of that my most
Honored Friend Dr. Chr. Wren, now worthily dignified with the Superintendency
of his Majesty's Buildings.

20. We did, in Chap. 21. mention certain Subterranean Trees, which Mr. Cambden
supposes grew altogether under the ground: And truly, it did appear a very
Paradox to me, till I both saw, and diligently examined that piece ( Plank,
Stone, or both shall I name it) of Lignum fossile taken out of a certain Quarry
thereof at Aqua Sparta not far from Rome, and sent to the most incomparably
learned Sir George Ent, by that obliging Virtuoso Cavalier dal Pozzo. He that
shall examine the hardness, and feel the ponderousness of it, sinking in
water, etc. will easily take it for a stone; but he that shall behold its
grain, so exquisitely undulated, and varied together with its color, manner of
hewing, chips, and other most perfect resemblances, will never scruple to
pronounce it arrant wood.

Signor Stelluti (an Italian) has published a whole Treatise expressly to
describe this great Curiosity: And there has been brought to our notice, a
certain relation of an Elm growing in Bark-shire near Farringdon, which being
cut toward the Root, was there plainly Petrified; the like, as I once my self
remember to have seen in another Tree, which grew quite through a Rock near the
Sepulcher of Agrippina (the Mother of that Monster Nero) at the Baia by Naples,
which appeared to be all Stone, and trickling down in drops of Water, if I
forget not. But, whiles others have Philosophiz'd according to their manner
upon these extraordinary Concretions; see what the most industrious, and
knowing Mr. Hook, Curator of this Royal Society, has with no less Reason, but
more succinctnesse, observed from a late Microscopical Examen of another piece
of petrifid wood; the Description, and Ingenuity whereof cannot but gratify
the Curious, who will by this Instance, not only be instructed how to make
Inquiries upon the like occasions; but see also with what accuratenesse the
Society constantly proceeds in all their Indagations, and Experiments; and with
what Candor they relate, and communicate them.

21. It resembl'd wood, in that

First, all the parts of the petrifi'd substance seemed not at all dislocated,
or altered from their natural position whiles they were wood; but the whole
piece retained the exact shape of wood, having many of the conspicuous pores of
wood still remaining pores, and showing a manifest difference visible enough
between the grain of the wood and that of the bark; especially, when any side
of it was cut smooth and polite; for then it appeared to have a very lovely
grain, like that of some curious close wood.

Next (it resembled wood) in that all the smaller and (if so I may call those
which are only to be seen by a good glass) microscopical pores of it, appear
(both when the substance is cut and polished transversly, and parallel to the
pores) perfectly like the Microscopical pores of several kinds of wood,
retaining both the shape, and position of such pores.

It was differing from wood.

First, in weight, being to common water, as 3 to 1. whereas there are few of
our English woods that, when dry, are found to be full as heavy as water.

Secondly, in hardness, being very near as hard as a flint, and in some places
of it also resembling the grain of a flint: it would very readily cut Glass,
and would not without difficulty (especially in some parts of it) be scratched
by a black hard flint: it would also as readily strike fire against a Steel, as
also against a flint.

Thirdly, in the closeness of it; for, though all the microscopical pores of
the wood were very conspicuous in one position, yet by altering that position
of the polished surface to the light, it also was manifest that those pores
appeared darker than the rest of the body, only because they were filled up
with a more dusky substance, and not because they were hollow.

Fourthly, in that it would not burn in the fire; nay, though I kept it a good
while red-hot in the flame of a Lamp, very intensly cast on it by a blast
through a small pipe; yet it seemed not at all to have diminished its
extension; but only I found it to have changed its color, and to have put on
a more dark, and dusky brown hue. Nor could I perceive that those parts which
seemed to have been wood at first, were any thing wasted, but the parts
appeared as solid, and close as before. It was farther observable also, that as
it did not consume like wood; so neither did it crack and fly like a flint, or
such like hard stone; nor was it long before it appeared red-hot.

Fifthly, in its dissolublenesse; for putting some drops of distilled Vinegar
upon the stone, I found it presently to yield very many bubbles, just like
those which may be observed in spirit of Vinegar when it corrodes Coral; though
I guess many of those bubbles proceeded from the small parcels of Air, which
were driven out of the pores of this petrifi'd substance, by the insmuating
liquid menstruum.

Sixthly, in its Rigidnesse, and friability; being not at all flexible, but
brittle like a flint; insomuch that with one knock of a Hammer I broke off a
small piece of it, and with the same Hammer quickly beat it to pretty fine
powder upon an Anvil.

Seventhly, it seemed also very differing from wood to the touch, feeling more
cold then wood usually does, and much like other close Stones and Minerals.

The Reasons of all which Phenomenon seem to be.

That this petrifi'd wood having lain in some place where it was well soaked
with petrifying water (that is, such a water as is well impregnated with stony
and earthy particles) did by degrees separate, by straining and filtration, or
perhaps by praecipitation, co-haesion or coagulation, abundance of stony
particles from that permeating water, which stony particles having, by means of
the fluid Vehicle, conveyed themselves not only into the microscopical pores,
and perfectly stopped up them; but also into the pores, which may perhaps be
even in that part of the wood which through the microscope appears most solid;
do thereby so augment the weight of the wood, as to make it above three times
heavier than water, and perhaps six times as heavy as it was when wood: next,
they hereby so lock up and fetter the parts, of the wood, that the fire cannot
easily make them fly away, but the action of the fire upon them is only able
to char those parts, as it were, like as a piece of wood if it be closed very
fast up in Clay, and kept a good while red hot in the fire, will by the heat of
the fire be char'd, and not consumed; which may perhaps be the reason why the
petrifi'd substance appeared of a blackish brown color after it had been
burnt. By this intrusion of the petrifi^'d particles it also becomes hard, and
friable; for the smaller pores of the wood being perfectly stuffed up with
these stony particles, the particles of the wood have few, or no pores in which
they can reside, and consequently, no flexion or yielding can be caused in such
a substance. The remaining particles likewise of the wood among the stony
particles may keep them from cracking and flying, as they do in a flint.

22. The casual finding of Subterraneous-Trees has been the occasion of this
curious Digression: Now it were a strange Paradox to affirm, that the Timber
under the ground, should to a great degree, equal the value of that which grows
above the Ground; seeing though it be far less, yet it is far Richer; the
Roots of the vilest Shrub, being better for its toughness, and for Ornaments,
and delicate uses much more preferrable than the Heart of the fairest and
soundest Tree: And many Hills, and other waste-places, that have in late and
former Ages been stately Groves and Woods, have yet this Treasure remaining,
and perchance sound and unperish'd, and commonly (as we observed) an hinderance
to other Plantations; Engines therefore, and Expedients for the more easily
extracting these Cumbrances, and making riddance upon such Occasions, besides
those we have produced, would be excogitated, and inquired after, for the
dispatch of this difficult Work.

Fuel.
23. Finally, for the use of our Chimneys, and maintenance of fire, the plenty
of wood for fuel, rather than the quality is to be looked after; and yet there
are some greatly to be preferred before others, as harder, longer-lasting,
better heating, and cheerfully burning; for which we have commended the Ash,
etc. in the foregoing Paragraphs, and to which I pretend not here to add much,
for the avoiding repetitions; though even an History of the best way of Charing
would not mis-become this Discourse.

But something more is to be said sure, concerning the felling of Fuel-wood:
Note therefore, that you first begin with the under-wood: Some conceive between
Martle-mas and Holy-Rood; but, generally with Oaks as soon as 'twill strip, but
not after May; and for Ashes, 'twixt Michael-mas and Candle-mas; and so felled,
as that the Cattle may have the browsing of it, for in Winter they will not
only eat the tender twiggs, but even the very Moss; but fell no more in a day
than they can Eat for this purpose: This done, kid or bavin them, and pitch
them upon their ends to preserve them from rotting: Thus the Underwood being
disposed of, the rest will prosper the better, and besides it otherwise does
but rot upon the Earth, and destroy that which would spring. If you head or top
for the fire, it is not amiss to begin three or four foot above the Timber, if
it be considerable; but in case they are only shaken-Trees and Hedge-rows,
strip them even to thirty foot high, because they are usually full of boughs;
and 'twere good to top such as you perceive to wither at the tops a competent
way beneath, to prevent their sickness downwards, which will else certainly
ensue; whereas by this means even dying Trees may be preserved many years to
good emolument, though they never advance taller; and being thus frequently
shred, they will produce more, than if suffered to stand and decay: This is a
profitable note for such as have old, doting, or any ways infirm Woods: In
other Fellings, some advise never to commence the disbranching from the top,
for though the incumbency of the very boughs upon the next, cause them to fall
off the easier, yet it endangers the splicing of the next, which is very
prejudicial, and therefore advise the beginng at the nearest. And in Cutting
for fuel you may as at the top, so at the sides, cut a foot, or more from the
Body; but never when you shred Timber Trees: We have said how dangerous it is,
to cut for wood when the Sap is up, it is a mark of improvident Husbands;
besides it will never burn well, though abundance be congested: Lastly,
remember that East and North-winds are unkind to the succeeding Shoots. Now for
directions in Stacking (of which we have said something in Chap. of Copses)
ever set the lowest course an end, the second that on the sides and ends, viz.
sides and ends outward; the third thwart the other on the side, and so the
rest, till all are placd, spending the up-most first.

Thus we have endeavored to prescribe the best directions we could learn
concerning this necessary Subject. And in this penury of that dear Commodity,
and to incite all ingenious persons, studious of the benefit of their Country,
to think of ways how our Woods may be preserved, by all manner of Arts which
may prolong the lasting of our fuel, I would give the best encouragements.
Those that shall seriously consider the intolerable misery of the poor Cauchi
(the then Inhabitants of the Low Countries) described by Pliny, lib 16. cap. 1.
(how opulent soever their late Industry has rendered them) for want only of
wood for fuel, will have reason to deplore the excessive decay of our former
store of that useful Commodity; and by what shifts our Neighbors the
Hollanders, do yet repair that defect, be invited to exercise their ingenuity:
For besides the Dung of Beasts, and the Peat and Turf for their Chimneys, Cow
sheardes, etc. they make use of Stoves both portable and standing; and truly
the more frequent use of those Inventions in our great, wasting Cities (as the
Custom is through all Germany) as also of those new, and excellent Ovens
invented by Dr. Keffler, for the incomparably baking of Bread, etc. would be an
extraordinary expedient of husbanding our fuel; as well as the right mingling,
and making up of Char-coal-dust, and loam, as it is hinted to us by Sir Hugh
Plat^ and is generally used in Mastricht, and the Country about it; than which
there is not a more sweet, lasting, and beautiful fuel; The manner of it is
thus:

24. Take about one third part of the smallest of any Coal, Pit, Sea, or Char
coal, and commix them very well with loam (whereof there is in some places to
be found a sort somewhat more combustible) make these up into balls (moistened
with a little Urine of Man or Beast) as big as an ordinary Goose-egge, or
somewhat bigger; or if you will in any other form, like brick-bats, etc. expose
these in the Air till they are thoroughly dry; they will be built into the most
orderly fires you can imagine, burn very clear, give a wonderful heat, and
continue a very long time. But first you must make the fire of Char-coal, or
Small-coal, covering them with your Eggs or Hovilles (as they are called) and
building them up in Pyramid, or what shape you please; they will continue a
glowing, solemn and constant fire for seven or eight hours without being
stirred, and then they encourage and recruite the innermost with a fevv fresh
Eggs, and turn the rest, which are yet quite reduced to Cinders.

Two or three short Billets covered with Char-coal last much longer, and with
more life, than twice the quantity by it self, whether Char-coal alone, or
Billet; and the Billets under the Char-coal being undisturbed, will melt as it
were into Char-coals of such a lasting size.

If Small-coals be spread over the Char coal, where you burn it alone, 'twill
bind it to longer continuance; and yet more, if the Small coal be made of the
roots of Thorns, Briers, and Brambles. Consult L. Bacon, Exp. 775.

25. The Quercus Marina, Wrack, or Sea-weed which comes in our Oyster barrels,
laid under New-Castle-coal to kindle it (as the use is in some places) will (as
I am informed) make it out-last two great fires of simple Coals, and maintain a
glowing luculent heat without wast: The manner of gathering it is to cut it in
Summer time from the Rocks whereon it grows abundantly, and bringing it in
Boats or otherwise to Land, spread and dry it in the Sun like hay, turning and
cocking it till it be fully cured: It makes an excellent fire alone, and roasts
to admiration; and when all is burnt, the Ashes are one of the best manures for
Land in the world, for the time it continues its virtue, which should be
frequently supplied with fresh; and as to the Fire mingled with other
Combustibles, it is evident that it adds much life, continuance and aid, to our
sullen Sea-coal Fuel; and if the main Ocean should afford Fuel (as the
Bernacles and Soland-Geese are said to do in some parts of Scotland with the
very sticks of their Nests) we in these Isles may thank our selves if we be not
warm: These few particulars I have but mentioned to animate Improvements, and
ingenious Attempts of detecting more cheap, and useful processes, for ways of
Charing-Coals, Peat, and the like fuliginous materials; as the accomplished Mr.
Boil has intimated to us in the Fifth of those his precious Essays concerning
the usefulness of Natural Philosophy, Part 2. cap. 7. etc. to which I refer
the Curious.

26. By the Preamble of the Statute 7 Ed. 6. one may perceive (the Measures
compared) how plentiful fuel was in the time of Ed. the 4 th, to what it was in
the Reigns of his Successors: This suggested a review of Sizes, and a
reformation of Abuses; in which it was Enacted, that every Sack of Coals should
contain four Bushels; Every Taleshide to be four foot long, besides the carf;
and if named of one, marked one, to contain 16 inches circumference, within a
foot of the middle; If of two marks, 23 inches; of 3.28. of 4.35; of 5.38.
inches about, and so proportionably.

27. Billets were to be of three foot, and four inches in length: the single to
be 17 inches and an half about; and every Billet of one cast (as they term the
mark) to be ten inches about: of two cast, fourteen inches, and to be marked
(unless for the private use of the Owner) within six inches of the middle: of
one cast within four inches of the end etc.

Every bound Faggot should be three foot long; the band twenty four inches
circumference, besides the knot.

In the 43. Eliz. the same Statute (which before only concerned London and its
Suburbs) was made more universal; and that of Ed. 6. explained with this
addition: For such Taleshides as were of necessity to be made of cleft-wood, if
of one mark, and half round, to be 19 inches about; if quarter-cleft 18 inches:
Marked two, being round it shall be 23 inches compass: half-round 27:
quarter-cleft 26: marked three, round 28: half-round 33: quarter-cleft 32:
marked four, being round 33 inches about: half-round 39: quarter-cleft 38:
marked five round, 38 inches about: half-round 44: quarter-cleft 43: the
measure to be taken within half a foot of the middle of the length mentioned in
the former Statute.

Then for the Billet, every one named a single, being round, to have 7 inches
circumference; but no single to be made of cleft wood: If marked one, and
round, to contain 11 inches compass: if half-round 13: quarter-cleft 12.

If marked two, being round, to contain 16 inches: half-round 19: quarter-cleft
18: the length as in the Statute of King Edward 6.

28. Fagots to be every stick of three foot in length, excepting only one
stick of one foot long, to harden and wedge the binding of it: This, to prevent
the abuse (too much practiced) of filling the middle part, and ends with trash,
and short sticks, which had been omitted in the former Statute: concerning this
and of the dimensions of wood in the Stack, see Chap. 28. to direct the less
instructed Purchaser: and I have been the more particular upon this occasion;
because, than our Fuel bought in Billet by the Notch (as they call it in
London) there is nothing more deceitful; for by the vile iniquity of some
Wretches, marking the billets as they come to the Wharf, Gentlemen are
egregiously cheated. I could produce an instance of a Friend of mine (and a
Member of this Society) for which the Wood-monger has little cause to brag;
since he never durst come at him, or challenge his Money for the Commodity he
bought; because he durst not stand to the measure.

At Hall near Foy, there is a Faggot, which consists but of one piece of Wood,
naturally grown in that form, with a band wrapped about it, and parted at the
ends into four sticks, one of which is subdivided into two others: It was
carefully preserved many years by an Earl of Devonshire, and looked on as
portending the fate of his Posterity, which is since indeed come into the hands
of four Cornish Gentlemen, one of whose Estates is likewise divided 'twixt two
Heirs. This we have out of Cambden, and I here note, for the Extravagancy of
the thing; though as to the verity of such Portents from Trees, etc. I do not
find (upon enquiry, which I have diligently made of my Lord Brereton) that
there is any certainty of the rising of those Logs in the Lake belonging to
that Noble Person, so as still to premonish the Death of the Heir of that
Family, how confidently soever reported. Sometimes it has happn'd, but the
Tradition is not constant: To this Class may be referred what is affirmed
concerning the fatal Prediction of Oaks bearing strange leaves, which may be
enquired of.

29. But I will now describe to you the Mystery of Charing (whereof something
was but touched in the Process of extracting Tar out of the Pines) as I
received it from a most industrious person, and so conclude the Chapter.

There is made of Char coal usually three sorts, viz. one for the Iron-works, a
second for Gunpowder, and a third for London and the Court, besides
Small-coals, of which we shall also speak in its due place.

We will begin with that sort which is used for the Iron-works, because the
rest are made much after the same manner, and with very little difference.

The best Wood for this is good Oak, cut into lengths of three foot, as they
size it for the Stack: This is better than the Cord-wood, though of a large
measure, and much used in Essex.

The Wood cut, and set in Stacks ready for the Coaling, choose out some level
place in the Copse, the most free from stubs, etc. to make the Hearth on: In
the midst of this area drive down a stake for your Center, and with a pole,
having a ring fastened to one of the extremes (or else with a Cord put over the
Center) describe a Circumference from twenty, or more feet semidiameter,
according to the quantity of your Wood designed for Coaling, which being near
may conveniently be Chared in that Hearth; and which at one time may be 12, 16,
20, 24, even to 30 stack: If 12 therefore be the quantity you will Coal, a
Circle whose diameter is 24 foot, will suffice for the Hearth; If 20 stack, a
diameter of 32 foot; If 30, 40 foot, and so proportionably.

Having thus marked out the ground, with Mattocks, Haws, and fit Instruments,
bare it of the Turf, and of all other combustible stuff whatsoever, which you
are to rake up toward the Peripherie, or outside of the Circumference, for an
use to be afterward made of it; plaining, and levelling the ground within the
Circle: This done, the Wood is to be brought from the nearest parts where it is
stack'd, in Wheel-barrows; and first the smallest of it placed at the utmost
limit, or very margin of the Hearth, where it is to be set long-wayes, as it
lay in the stack; the biggest of the Wood pitch, or set up on end round about
against the small-wood, and all this within the circle, till you come within
five, or six foot of the Center; at which distance you shall begin to set the
Wood in a Triangular form (as in the following Print, a) till it come to be
three foot high: Against this again, place your greater Wood almost
perpendicular, reducing it from the triangular to a circular form, till being
come within a yard of the Center, you may Pile the Wood long-wayes, as it lay
in the Stack, being careful that the ends of the Wood do not touch the Pole,
which must now be erected in the Center, nine foot in height, that so there may
remain a round hole, which is to be formed in working up the Stack wood, for a
Tunnel and the more commodious firing of the pit, as they call it, though not
very properly. This provided for, go on to Pile, and set your Wood upright to
the other, as before; till having gained a yard more, you lay it long-wayes
again, as was showed: And thus continue the Work, still enterchanging the
position of the Wood, till the whole Area of the Hearth and Circle be filled,
and pil'd up at the least eight foot high, and so drawn in by degrees in
Piling, that it resemble the form of a copped brown Houshold-loaf, filling all
inequalities with the smaller Trunchions, till it lie very close, and be
perfectly, and evenly shaped. This done, take straw, haume, or fern, and lay
it on the outside of the bottom of the heap, or wood, to keep the next cover
from falling amongst the sticks: Upon this, put on the Turf, and cast on the
dust and Rubbish which was grubb'd, and raked up at the making of the Hearth,
and reserved near the circle of it; with this cover the whole heap of Wood to
the very top of the Pit, or Tunnel, to a reasonable, and competent thickness,
beaten close and even, that so the fire may not vent but in the places where
you intend it; and if in preparing the Hearth, at first, there did not rise
sufficient Turf and Rubbish for this Work, supply it from some convenient place
near to your heap: There be who cover this again with a sandy, or finer mould,
which if it close well, need not be above an inch or two thick: This done,
provide a Screene; by making light hurdles with slit rods, and straw of a
compent thickness, to keep off the Wind, and broad, and high enough to defend
an opposite side to the very top of your Pit, being eight or nine foot; and so
as to be easily removed as need shall require for the luing of your pit.

When now all is in this posture, and the Wood well ranged, and closed, as has
been directed, set fire to your heap: But first you must provide you of a
Ladder to ascend the top of your Pit: this they usually make of a curved Tiller
fit to apply to the unequal shape of the Heap, and cut it full of notches for
the more commodious setting their Feet, whiles they govern the Fire above;
therefore now they pull up, and take away the Stake which was erected at the
center to guide the building of the Pile, and cavity of the Tunnel. This done,
put in a quantity of Char-coals (about a peck) and let them fall to the bottom
of the Hearth; upon them cast in coals that are fully kindled; and when those
which were first put in are beginning to sink, throw in more fuel; and so, from
time to time, till the Coals have universally taken fire up to the top: Then
cut an ample and reasonable thick Turf, and clap it over the hole, or mouth of
the Tunnel, stopping it as close as may be with some of the former dust and
rubbish: Lastly, with the handles of your Rakers, or the like, you must make
Vent-holes, or Registers (as our Chemists would name them) through the stuff
which covers your Heap to the very Wood, these in ranges of two or three foot
distance quite round within a foot (or thereabout) of the top, though some
begin them at the bottom: A day after, begin another row of holes a foot and
half beneath the former; and so more, till they arrive to the ground, as
occasion requires. Note, that as the Pit does coal and sink toward the center,
it is continually to be fed with short, and fitting Wood, that no part remain
unfir'd; and if it chars faster at one part than at another, there close up the
vent-holes, and open them where need is: A Pit will in this manner be burning
off, and charing, five, or six days, and as it coals, the smoke from thick and
gross clouds, will grow more blew, and livid, and the whole mass sink
accordingly; so as by these indications you may the better know how to stop,
and govern your spiracles. Two or three days it will only require for
cooling, which (the vents being stopped) they assist, by taking now off the
outward covering with a Rabil or Rubber; but this, not for above the space of
one ya^d breadth at a time; and first they remove the coursest, and grossest of
it, throwing the finer over the heap again, that so it may neither cool too
hastily, nor endanger the burning and reducing all to Ashes, should the whole
Pit be uncovered and exposed to the Air at once; therefore they open it thus
round by degrees.

When now by all the former Symptoms you judge it fully chared, you may begin
to draw; that is, to take out the Coals, first round the bottom, by which means
the Coals, Rubbish and Dust sinking and falling in together may choke, and
extinguish the fire.

Your Coals sufficiently cooled, with a very long-tooth'd Rake, and a Vann, you
may load them into the Coal-Wains, which are made close with boards, purposely
to carry them to Market: Of these Coals the grosser sort are commonly reserved
for the Forges, and Iron-works; the middling and smoother put up in Sacks, and
carried by the Colliers to London and the adjacent Towns; those which are
char'd of the Roots, if picked out, are accounted best for Chemical fires, and
where a lasting, and extraordinary blast is required.

30. Coal for the Powder Mills is made of Alder-wood (but Lime-tree were much
better had we it in that plenty as we easily might) cut stack'd, and set on the
Hearth like the former: But first, ought the wood to be wholly disbark'd (which
work is to be done about Mid-summer before) and being thoroughly dry, it may be
Coaled in the same method, the Heap or Pits only somewhat smaller, by reason
that they seldom coal above five, or six stacks at a time, laying it but two
lengths of the wood one above the other, in form somewhat flatter on the top
than what we have described. Likewise do they fling all their Rubbish and Dust
on the top, and begin not to cover at the bottom, as in the former example. In
like sort, when they have drawn up the fire in the Tunnel, and stopped it, they
begin to draw down their dust by degrees round the heap; and this
proportionably as it fires, till they come about to the bottom; all which is
dispatched in the space of two days. One of these Heaps will char threescore
Sacks of Coal, which may all be carried at one time in a Wagon; and some make
the Court-coals after the same manner. Lastly,

31. Small-coals are made of the Spray, and Brush-wood which is shripped off
from the branches of Copse-wood, and which is sometimes bound up into Bavins
for this use; though also it be as frequently chared without binding, and then
they call it cooming it together: This, they place in some near floor, made
level, and freed of encumbrances, where setting one of the Bavins or part of
the spray on fire, two men stand ready to throw on Bavin upon Bavin (as fast as
they can take fire, which makes a very great and sudden blaze) till they have
burnt all that lies near the place, to the number (it may be) of five, or six
hundred Bavins: But ere they begin to set fire, they fill great Tubs or Vessels
with water, which stand ready by them, and this they dash on with a great dish
or scoup, so soon as ever they have thrown on all their Bavins, continually
plying the great heap of glowing Coals, which gives a sudden stop to the fury
of the Fire, whiles with a great Rake they lay, and spread it abroad, and ply
their casting of Water still on the Coals, which are now perpetually turned by
two men with great Shovels, a third throwing on the water: This they continue
till no more Fire appears, though they cease not from being very hot: After
this, they shovel them up into great heaps, and when they are thoroughly cold,
put them up in Sacks for London, where they use them amongst diverse Artificers,
both to kindle greater Fires, and to temper, and aneal their several Works.

32. The best Season for the fetching home of other Fuel, is from June; the
Ways being then most dry, and passable, yet I know some good Husbands will
begin rather in May; because Fallowing and stirring of Ground for Corn, comes
in the ensuing Months, and the Days are long enough, and Swains have then
least to do.

Wood placed about it in Triangle. c The Coal Wood pil'd up before it be covered

33. And thus we have seen how for House-boot, and Ship-boot, Plow boot,
Hey-boot, and Fire-boot, the Planting, and Propagation of Timber and Forest
Trees is requisite, so as it was not for nothing, that the very Name (which the
Greeks generally applied to Timber) (...), by Senechdoche, was taken always pro
Materia; since we hardly find any thing in Nature more universally useful; or,
in comparison with it, deserving the name of Material.

34. Lastly, to complete this Chapter of the universal Use of Trees, and the
Parts of them, something I could be tempted to say concerning Staves, Wands
etc. Their Antiquity, Use, Divine, Domestic, Civil, and Political; the time of
Cutting, manner of Seasoning, Forming, and other curious particulars (how dry
soever the Subject may appear) both of Delight and Profit: but we reserve it
for some more fit opportunity, and perhaps, it may merit a peculiar Treatise,
as acceptable, as it will prove divertisant. Instead of this, we will therefore
gratify our Reader with some no inconsiderable Secrets: But first we will
begin with a few plain Directions for such Persons and Country Gentlemen, as
being far distant from, or unhandsomely imposed upon by common Painters, may be
desirous to know how to Stop, Prime, and Paint their Timber-work at home, and
save the Expense of Work by any of their Servants indu'd with an ordinary
Capacity.

Putty to stop the chaps and cracks of wrought Timber, is made of White and
Red-lead, and some Spannish-white (not much) tempered, and bruised with so much
Lin-seed Oil as will bring it to the Consistence of a Past. Then,

Your first Priming shall be of Oaker and Spanish-white, very thinly ground:
The second with the same, a little Whiter; but it matters not much. The third
and last, with White-lead alone; some mingle a little Spanish-white with it,
but it is better omitted. If you desire it exquisite, instead of Lin-seed-Oyl,
use that of Wall-nuts: But the ordinary Stone-colour for gross work, exposed
to the Air, may be of less Expense, with the more ordinary Oil, to which you
may add a little Char-coal in the Grinding.

Blew, is made of Indigo, with a small addition of Red-lead, or Verdigreese for
a dryer; unless you will use drying-Oyl, which is much preferrable, and is
made of Lin-seed Oil boiled with a little Vmber bruised small: I speak nothing
here of Smalt and Byce, which is only done by Strewing.

Green, with Verdigreece ground with Lin-seed Oil pretty thick, and then
tempered with Joyners Vernish in a glazed Pot of Earth (the best to preserve
your Colors in) till it run somewhat thin; and just touch it with your Brush,
when you lay it on, having Prim'd it the second time with White.

Note, that every Primer must be dry, before you go it over again.

If you will Re-vaile, as they term it, and shadow, or Vein your Stone-colour,
there is a Color called Shadowing-Black; or you may now and then lightly touch
it with a little Red-lead; or work with Vmber.

It will also behove you to have a good smooth Slat, and a Pibble Muller well
polished, which may be bought at London; as likewise a dozen of large, and
lesser Brushes, and Glazed Pots; and to grind the Colors perfectly well. The
Spanish-white requires little labor; the Shadowing Black, none at all.

When you have finished, wash your Brushes with warm-Water and a little Soap:
Preserve your Oil in Bladders; and what Color you leave, plunge the Pots into
fair Water, so as they may stand a little covered in it, which will keep them
from growing dry, till you have occasion for them. That you may not be
altogether ignorant of the charge, and Price of the Ingredients, which seldom
varies: Clear, and sweet Lin-seed Oil is usually had for 4 s. per Gallon.
Spruce-Oaker, of all sorts to Prime with, 3 s. per Pound. Spanish white, for
half a Penny: White-lead 3 d. per Pound.


Vert-de-Greece, clean and bright, 3 s. per Pound. Black to shadow with,
exceeding cheap. Joyners Vernish, 6 d. per Pound. So as for farther direction;
of White-lead six pound, Span. white six pound, Spruce-Oker three pounds,
Vert-de-Greece half a pound, Vernish one pound, Shadowing-black half a pound,
etc. will serve one for a pretty deal of Work, and easily inform what
quantities you should provide for a greater, or lesser occasion.

We will next impart a Receipt for a cheap Black-dye, such yet as no Weather
will fetch out, and that may be of use both within and without doors, upon
Wainscot, or any fine Timber, as I once applied it to a Coach with perfect
success.

Take of Galls, grossly contus'd in a Stone Mortar one pound, boil them in
three quarts of White Wind Vinegar to the diminution of one part, two
remaining: With this, rub the Wood twice over; Then, take of the Silk Diers
black, liquid (cheap, and easy to be had) a convenient quantity, mix it at
discretion with Lamp-black and Aqua-vitae, sufficient to make it thin enough to
pass a Strainer: With this, die over your Work again; and if at any time it be
stained or spotted with dirt, etc. rubbing it only with a Wollen-cloth dipped in
Oil, it will not only recover, but present you with a very fair and noble
polish. There is a Black which Joyners use to tinge their Pear Tree with, and
make it resemble Ebony, and likewise Fir, and other Woods for Cabinets,
Picture-Frames, etc. which is this.

Take Log-wood q. s. boil it in ordinary Lie, and with this paint them over:
when it is dry, work it over a second time with Lamp-black and strong Size: That
also dry, rub off the dusty Sootiness adhering to it, with a soft Brush, or
Cloth; then melt some Beeswax, mixing it with your Lamp-black and Size, and
when this is cold, make it up into a Ball, and rub over your former Black:
Lastly, with a Polishing brush (made of short stiff Boars Bristles, and fastened
with Wyre) labor it till the Luster be to your liking. But,

The black Putty, wherewith they stop, and fill up cracks and fissures in
Ebony, and other fine wood, is composed of a part of the purest Rosin,
Beeswax, and Lamp-black: This they heat and drop into the Crannies; then with
an hot-Iron, glaze it over, and being cold, scrape it even with a sharp Chisel,
and after all, polish it with a Brush of bents, a wollen-cloth, Felt, and an
Hogs-hair Rubber: Also Mastic alone, mingled with a proper Color is of no
less effect.

35. We conclude all, with that incomparable Secret of the Japon or
China-Vernishes, which has hitherto been reserved so choicely among the
Virtuosi; with which I shall suppose to have abundantly gratified the most
curious employers of the finer woods.

Take a Pint of Spirit of Wine exquisitely dephlegm'd, four Ounces of Gum-Lacq,
which thus cleanse: break it first from the sticks and rubbish, and roughly
contusing it in a Mortar, put it to steep in Fountain water, ti'd up in a bag
of course Linen, together with a very small morsel of the best Castle-Sope,
for 12 hours; then rub out all the tincture from it, to which add a little
Alum, and reserve it apart: The Gum-lacq remaining in the bag, with one Ounce
of Sandrac (some add as much Mastic and White-Amber) dissolve in a large Matras
(well stopped) with the spirit of Wine by a two days digestion, frequently
agitating it, that it adhere not to the Glass: Then strain, and press it
forth into a lesser Vessel; Some, after the first Infusion upon the Ashes,
after twenty four hours, augment the heat, and transfer the Matras to the
Sandbach, till the Liquor begins to simper; and when the upper part of the
Matras grows a little hot, and that the Gum-lacq is melted, which by that time
(if the Operation be heeded) commonly it is, strain it through a Linen Cloth,
and press it 'twixt two sticks into the glass, to be kept for use, which it
will eternally be, if well stopped.

The Application.

The Wood which you would Vernish, should be very clean, smooth, and without
the least freckle or flaw; and in case there be any, stop them with a past made
of Gum Tragacanth, incorporated with what Color you design: Then cover it with
a layer of Vernish purely, till it be sufficiently drenched with it: Then take
seven times the quantity of the Vernish, as you do of Color, and bruise it in
a small earthen dish glazed, with a piece of some hard wood, till they are well
mingled: Apply this with a very fine and full Pencil; a quarter of an hour
after, do it over again, even to three times successively; and if every time it
be permitted to dry, before you put on the next, 'twill prove the better:
Within two hours after these four layers (or sooner if you please) Polish it
with Preslc (which our Cabinet-makers call as I think, Dutch-Reeds) wet, or
dry; nor much imports it, though in doing this, you should chance to discover
any of the wood; since you are to pass it over four or five times as above;
and if it be not yet smooth enough, Preslc it again with the Reeds; but now
very tenderly: Then rub it sufficiently with Tripoly, and a little Oyl-Olive,
or Water: Lastly, cover it once or twice again with your Vernish, and two days
after, polish it as before with Tripoly, and a piece of Hatters Felt.

The Colors.

To make it of a fair Red, Take Spanish Vermilion, with a quarter part of
Venice-Lacke.

For Black, Ivory calcined (as Chemists speak) 'twixt two well luted Crucibles,
which being grown'd in water, with the best and greenest Coppros, and so let
dry, reserve.

For Blew, take Vltra-Marin, and only twice as much Vernish, as of Color. The
rest, are to be applied like the Red, except it be the Green, which is hard to
make fair and vivid, and therefore seldom used.

Note, The right Japon, is done with three or four Layers of Vernish with the
Colors; then two of pure Vernish un-colour'd (which is made by the former
Process, without the Sandrac which is only mingled and used for Reds) which
must be done with a swift, and even stroke, that it may not dry before the
Aventurin be seifted on it; and then you are to cover it with so many Layers of
pure Vernish, as will render it like polished Glass. Last of all fourbish it
with Tripoly, Oil, and the Felt, as before directed. Note,

By Venturine is meant the most delicate and slender Golden-wyre such as
Embroiderers use, reduced to a kind of powder, as small as you can clipp it:
this strewn upon the first Layer of pure Vernish, when dry, superinduce what
Color you please; and this is pretily imitated with several Talks.

This being the first time that so rare a Secret has been imparted, the Reader
will believe that I envy him nothing which may be of use to the Public: And
though many years since we were Master of this Curiosity, Athanasius Kercher
has set down a Process in his late China Illustrata pretty faithfully; yet,
besides that it only speaks Latin (such as it is) it is nothing so perfect as
ours. Howbeit, there we learn, that the most opulent Province of Chekiang is
for nothing more celebrated, than the excellent Paper which it produces, and
the Gum called Cie (extilling from certain Trees) with which they compose
their famous Vernish, so universally valued over the World; because it is found
above all other Inventions of that nature, to preserve, and beautify wood,
above any thing which has hitherto been detected: And it has accordingly so
generally obtained with them, that they have whole Rooms and ample Chambers,
Wainscotted therevvith, and diverse of their most precious Furniture; as
Cabinets, Tables, Stools, Beds, Dishes, Skreens, Staves, Frames, Pots, and
other Vtensils: But long it was ere we could for all this, approach it in
Europe to any purpose, till F. Eustachius Imart an Augustine-Monk, obtained the
Secret, and obliged us with it.

I know not whether it may be any Service to speak here of Colored Woods, I
mean such as are naturally so, because besides the Berbery for Yellow, and
Holly for White, we have very few: Our Inlayers use Fustic, Locust, or Acacia;
Brasile, Prince and Rosewood for Yellow and Reds, with several others brought
from both the Indies; but when they would imitate the natural turning of
Leaves in their curious Compartiments and bordures of Flower-works, they effect
it by dipping the pieces (first cut into shape and ready to In-lay) so far into
hot Sand, as they would have the Shadow, and the heat of the Sand darkens it so
gradually, without detriment or burning the thin Chip, as one would conceive it
to be natural: Note, that the Sand is to be heated in some very thin Brasse-pan
like to the bottom of a Scale or Balance: This I mention because the burning
with Irons, or Aquafortis, is not comparable to it.

I learn also, that soft Woods attain little politure without infinite labor,
and the expedient is, to Plane it often, and every time you do so, to smeare it
with strong Glue, which easily penetrating, hardens it; and the frequenter you
do this, and still Plane it, the harder, and sleeker it will remain.

And now we have spoken of Glue, it is so common and cheap, that I need not tell
you it is made by boiling the sins, etc. of Sheeps trotters, parings of raw
Hides, etc. to a Gelly, and straining it: But the finer, and more delicate Work
is best fastened with Fish Glue, to be had of the Drougist by the name of
Ichthyocolla; and here I conclude.

36. Let us now then sum up all the good qualities, and transcendent
perfections of Trees, in the harmonious Poets, Consort of Elogies.

-- Pines are for Masts an useful Wood,
Cedar and Cypress, to build Houses good:
Hence covers for their Carts, and spokes for Wheels
Swains make, and Ships do form their crooked Keels:
The Twiggy Sallows, Elms with leaves are frait;
Myrtles stout Spears, and Cornel good for fight:
The Yews into Ityrean Bows are bent;
Smooth Limes, and Box, the Turners Instrument
Shaves into form, and hollow Cups does trim;
And down the rapid Po light Alders swim:
In hollow Bark Bees do their honey stive,
And make the Trunk of an old Oak their Hive.

Georg. 2. and the most ingenious Ovid, where he introduces the miraculous
Grove raised by the melodious Song of Orpheus, -- Nor Trees of Chaony,
The Poplar, various Oaks that pierce the sky,
Soft Linden, smooth-rind Beech, unmarried Bays,
The brittle Hasel, Ash, whose spears we praise,
Unknotty Fir, the solace shading Planes,
Rough Chessnuts, Maple Fleet with different granes,
Stream-bordering Willow, Lotus loving takes,
Tuffe Box, whom never sappy spring forsakes,
The slender Tamarisk, with Trees that bear
A purple Fig, nor Myrtles absent were.
The wanton Ivy wreathed in amorous twines,
Vines bearing grapes, and Elms supporting Vines,
Straight Service-Trees, Trees dropping Pitch, fruit-red
Arbutus, these the rest accompanied.
With limber Palms, of Victory the prize:
And upright Pine, whose leaves like bristles rise,
Prized by the Mother of the Gods. --

Spencer, where he brings his gentle Knight into a shady Grove, praising -- the
Trees so straight, and high,
The sailing Pine, the Cedar proud, and tall,
The Vine-prop Elm, the Poplar never dry,
The builder Oak, sole King of Forests all;
The Aspine, good for Staves; the Cypress funeral:
The Laurel, meede of mighty Conquerours
And Poets sage; The Fir that weepeth still;
The Willow, worn of forlorn Paramours;
The Eugh, obedient to the benders will;

The Myrrh sweet bleeding in the bitter wound;
The Warlike Beech; the Ash for nothing ill;
The fruitful Olive; and the Platane round;
The Carver Holm; the Maple, seldom inward sound.
Canto. 1^ And in this Symphony might the noble Tasso bear likewise his part;
but that these are sufficient, and tria sunt omnia.

37. For we have already spoken of that modern Art of Tapping Trees in the
Spring, by which doubtless some excellent and specific Medicines may be
attained; as from the Birch for the Stone; from Elms and Elder against Fevers;
so from the Vine, the Oak, and even the very Bramble, etc. besides the wholesome
and pleasant Drinks, Spirits, etc. that may possibly be educed out of them all,
which we leave to the Industrious, satisfying our selves, that we have been
among the first who have hinted, and Published the ways of performing it.

What now remains concerns only some general Precepts, and Directions
applicable to most of that we have formerly touched; together with a Brief of
what farther Laws have been enacted for the Improvement, and preservation of
Woods; and which having dispatched, shall with a short Paraenesis touching the
present ordering, and disposing of his Majesty's Plantations for the future
benefit of the Nation, put an end to this rustic Discourse.

CHAP. XXXII. Aphorisms, or certain general Precepts of use to the foregoing
Chapters.
1. TRy all sorts of Seeds, and by their thriving you shall best discern what
are the most proper kinds for Grounds, Quippe solo natura subest -- and of
these design the main of your Plantation.

2. Keep your newly sown seeds continually fresh, and in the shade (as much as
may be) till they peep.

3. All curious Seeds, and Plants are diligently to be weeded, till they are
strong enough to over-drop or suppress them: And you shall carefully haw,
half-dig, and stir up the earth about their Roots during the first three years;
especially, in the Vernal, and Autumnal Aequinoxes: This work to be done in a
moist season for the first year to prevent the dust, and the suffocating of the
tender buds; but afterward, in the more dry weather.

4. Plants, raised from seed, shall be thinn'd where they come up too thick;
and none so fit as you thus draw to be transplanted into Hedge-rowes,
especially, where ground is precious.

5. In transplanting, omit not the placing of your Trees toward their
accustomed Aspect.

6. Remove the softest wood to the moistest grounds, Divisae arboribus partiae
--

7. Begin to Transplant Forest-trees when the leaves fall after Michaelmasse;
you may adventure when they are tarnish'd, and grow yellow: It is lost time to
commence later, and for the most part of your Trees, early Transplanters seldom
repent; for sometimes a tedious band of Frost prevents the whole season, and
the baldness of the Tree is a note of deceit; for some Oaks, and most Beeches,
preserve their dead leaves till new ones push them off.

8. Set deeper in the lighter grounds than in the strong; but shallowest in
Clay: five inches is sufficient for the dryest, and one or two for the moist,
provided you establish them against winds.

9. Plant forth in warm, and moist seasons; the Air tranquil and serene; the
wind westerly; but never whiles it actually freezes, Raines, or in Misty
Weather; for it moulds, and infects the Roots.

10. What you gather, and draw out of VVoods, plant immediately, for their
Roots are very apt to be mortified by the winds, and cold air.

11. Trees, produced from Seeds must have the Tap-roots abated (the
VVallnut-tree, and some others excepted, and yet if Planted merely for the
Fruit, some affirm it may be adventured on with success) and the bruised parts
cut away; but sparing the fibrous, for they are the principal feeders; and
those who cleanse them too much, are punished for the mistake.

12. In Spring, rub off some of the collateral Buds, to check the exuberancy of
Sap in the branches, till the Roots be well established.

13. Transplant no more then you well Fence; for that neglected, Tree-culture
comes to nothing: Therefore all young set Trees should be defended from the
winds, and Sun; especially the East, and North, till their Roots are fixed;
that is, till you perceive them shoot; and the not exactly observing of this
Article, is cause of the perishing of the most tender Plantations; for it is
the invasion of these two assailants which does more mischief to our new set,
and less hardy Trees, then the most severe and durable Frosts of a whole
VVinter.

14. The properest Soil, and most natural, apply to distinct species, Nec vero
terrae far omnes omnia possunt. Yet we find by experience, that most of our
Forest-Trees grow well enough in the coursest Lands; provided there be a
competent depth of mould: For albeit most of our wild Plants covet to run just
under the surface, yet where there is not sufficient depth to cool them, and
entertain the Moisture and Influences, they are neither lasting, nor prosperous.

15. VVood well Planted, will grow in Moorish, Boggy, Heathy, and the stoniest
grounds: Only the white, and blew clay (which is commonly the best Pasture) is
the worst for wood; and such good Timber as we find in any of these ( Oak^
excepted) is of an excessive age, requiring thrice the time to arrive at their
stature.

16. If the season require it, all new Plantations are to be plied with
waterings, which is better poured into a circle at some distance from the
Roots, which should continually be bared of Grass, and if the water be rich,
or impregnated, the shoots will soon discover it; for the Liquor being
percolated through a quantity of earth will carry the nitrous virtue of the
soil with it; by no means therefore water at the stem; because it washes the
mould from the Root, comes too crude, and endangers their rotting: But,

17. For the cooling and refreshing Tree-roots, the congesting of Pot-sheards,
Flints, or Pibb^es near the foot of the stem, is preferable to all other; and
so the Poet, Lime-stones, or squallid Shells, that may the Rain,
Vapors, and gliding moisture entertain.
Aut lapidem bibulum, aut squallenteis infode conchas,
Inter enim labentur aquae, tenuisque subibit
Halitus --
Georg. 2. But remember you remove them after a competent time, else the
Vermin, Snails, and Insects which they produce and shelter, will gnaw, and
greatly injure their Bark.

18. Young Plants will be strangled with Corn, Oats, Pease, or Hemp, or any
rankly growing Grain, if a competent circle and distance be not left (as of
near a yard, or so) of the Stem; this is a useful remark.

19. Cut no Trees (especially, having an eminent Pith in them, being young and
tender too) when either heat, or cold are in extremes; nor in very wet, or
snowy weather; and in this work it is profitable to discharge all Trees of
unthriving, broken, wind-shaken browse, and such as our Law terms Cablicia, and
to take them off to the quick, -- ne pars sincera trahatur. And for
Ever-greens, especially such as are tender, prune them not after Planting, till
they do Radicare, that is, by some little fresh shoot, discover that they have
taken.

I will Conclude with the Tecnical names, or dissimiler parts of Trees, as I
find them enumerated by the Industrious and Learned Dr. Merett. Scapus,
Truncus, Cortex, Liber, Malicorium, Matrix, Medulla and Cor, Pecten, Circuli,
Surculi, Rami, Sarmenta, Ramusculi, Spadix, Vimen, Virgultum and Cremium,
Vitilia, Talea, Scobs, Terms, Turiones, Frondes, Cachryas and Nucamentum,
Julus and Catulus, Comae: The Species Frutex, Suffrutex, etc. all which I leave
to be put into good and proper English, by those who shall once oblige our
Nation with a full, and absolutely complete Dictionary, as yet a great
desiderate amongst us.

To this I shall add, the Time, and Season of the flourishing of Trees,
computing from the entry of each Month as the figures denote; that is, from
March (where the Doctor begings) inclusively. March, Acer 3. ((i) from March to
May, viz. one Month; and sic de coeteris) Populus 2. Quercus 5. Sorbus 2. Vlmus
2. April, Alnus 2. Betula 2. Castanea 4. Euonymus 2. Fagus 2. Fraxinus 2.
Nux-Juglans 3. Salix 2. Sambucus 2. May, Cornus 2. Genista 4. Juniperus, Morus
2. Tilia 4. June, Aquifolium 2. July, Arbutus 2. Feb. Buxus 2.

Many more useful Observations are to be collected, and added to these, from
the diligent experience of Planters.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of the Laws and Statutes for the Preservation, and Improvement
of Woods, etc.
1. It Is not to be passed by, that the very first Law we find which was ever
promulg'd, was concerning Trees; and that Laws themselves were first Written
upon them, or Tables composed of them; and after that Establishment in
Paradise, the next we meet withal are as Ancient as Moses; you may find the
Statute at large in Deuteronomy. c. 20. v. 19, 20. Which though they chiefly tended to
Fruit Trees, even in an Enemies Country, yet you will find a case of
necessity, only alleged for the permission to destroy any other.

2. To Sum up briefly the Laws, and Civil Constitutions of great Antiquity,
by which Servius informs us 'twas no less than Capital, alienas arbores
incidere; the Lex Aquilia, and those of the xii. Tabb. mentioned by Paulus,
Cajus, Julianus, and others of that Robe, repeated diverse more.

It was by those Sacred Constitutions provided, that none might so much as
Plant Trees on the Confines of his Neighbors Ground, but he was to leave a
space of at the least five foot, for the smallest Tree, that they might not
injure him with their shadow. Si Arbor in Vicini agrum impenderit, eam
sublucato* etc. and if for all this, any hung over farther, 'twas to be stripped
up fifteen foot; And this Law Baldwinus, Olderdorpius, and Hotoman recites out
of Vlpian L. 1. F. de Arb. Caedend. where we have the Praetors Interdict
expressed, and the impendent Wood adjudged to appertain to him whose field, or
fence was thereby damnified: Nay, the Wise Solon prescribed Ordinances for the
very distances of Trees; as the divine Plato did against stealing of fruit, and
violating of Plantations: And the interdiction de Glande legenda runs thus in
Vlpian, AIT PRAETOR, GLANDEM, QVAE EX ILLIVS AGRO IN TVVM CADIT, QVO MINVS ILLI
TERTIO QVOQVE DIE LEGERE AVFERRE LICEAT, VIM FIERI VETO. And yet, though by the
Praetors permission he might come every third day to gather it up without
Trespass, his Neighbor was to share of the Mast which so fell into his
Ground; and this Chapter is well supplied by Pliny l. 16. c. 5. and Cajus upon
the Place, interprets Glandem to signify not the Acorns of the Oak alone, but
all sorts of fruit whatsoever, l. 136. F. de Verb. Signif. L. Vnis ff. de
Glande leg. as by usage of the Greeks, amongst whom (...) imports all kind of
Trees.

Moreover, no Trees might be Planted near Public Aquae-ducts, least the Roots
should insinuate into, and displace the Stones: Nor on the very margent of
Navigable Rivers, lest the Boats and other Vessels passing to and fro, should
be hindered, and therefore such impediments were called Retae, quia Naves
retinent, says the Gloss; and because the falling of the leaves corrupted the
Water. So nor within such a distance of High ways (which also our own Laws
prohibit) that they might dry the better, and less cumber the Traveller. Trees
that obstructed the Foundation of Houses were to be felled; Bartol. L. 1. doct.
c. de Interdict. Vlp. in L. priore ff. de Arborum caedend. Trees spreading
their Roots in neighbour-ground, to be in common; See Cujas and Paulus in L.
Arb. ff de Communi dividend. where more of the Alienation of Trees felled, and
not standing but with the Funds, as also of the Vse-fruit of Trees and the
difference 'twixt Arbores Grandes, and Cremiales or Ceduae, of all which
Vlpian, Ba^dus, Alciat, with the Laws to govern the Conlucatores and
Sublucatores, and Pruners; vide Pan. s. c. Sent. l. 5. Festus, etc. for we
pass over what concerns Vines and Olive Trees, to be found in Cato de R.R.
etc. Nor is it here that we design to enlarge, as those who have philologiz'd
on this occasion de Sycophantis, and other curious criticismes; but pass now
on, and confine my self to the prudent Sanctions of our own Parliaments: for
though according to the old and best Spirit of true English, we ought to be
more powerfully led by his Majesty's Example, than to have need of more cogent
and violent Laws; yet that our Discourse may be as ample, and as little
defective as we can render it, something it is fit should be spoken concerning
such Laws and Ordinances as have been from time to time constituted amongst us
for the Encouragement, and Direction of such as do well, as for the
Animadversion and Punishment of those who continue refractory, which I deduce
in this order.

3. From the time of Edward the fourth, were enacted many excellent Laws for
the Planting, securing, cutting, and ordering of Woods, Copses, and Under
woods, as then they took cognizance of them; together with the several
penalties upon the Infringers; especially from the 25 of Hen. 8 17. etc.
confirmed by the 13 and 27. of Q Eliz. cap. 25.19. etc. which are diligently to
be consulted* revived, put in execution, and enlarged where any defect is
apparent; as in particular the Act of exempting of Timber of 22 years growth
from Tithe, for a longer period, to render it complete, and more effectual to
their Improvement: And that Law repealed, by which Willows, Sallows, Oziers,
etc. which they term Sub-bois, are reputed but as Weeds.

4. Severer punishments have lately been ordained against our Wood-stealers,
destroyers of young Trees, etc. by an ancient Law of some Nation, I read he
forfeited his Hand, who beheaded a Tree without permission of the Owner; and I
cannot say they are sharp ones, when I compare the severity of our Laws
against Mare stealers; nor am I by inclination the least cruel; but I do
affirm, we might as well live without Mares, as without Masts and Ships, which
are our wooden, but no less profitable Horses.

5. And here we cannot but perstringe those Royotous Assemblies of Idle People,
who under pretense of going a Maying (as they term it) do oftentimes cut down,
and carry away fine straight Trees, to set up before some Alehouse, or
Revelling-place, where they keep their drunken Bacchanalias: For though this
Custom was, I read, introduced by the Emperor Anastasius, to abolish the Gentil
Majana of the Romans at Ostia; which was to transfer a great Oaken-Tree out of
some Forest into the Town, and erect it before their Mistris's Door; yet I
think it were better to be quite abolished amongst us, for many reasons,
besides that of occasioning so much wast and spoil as we find is done to Trees
at that Season, under this wanton pretense, by breaking, mangling, and tearing
down of branches, and entire Arms of Trees, to adorn their Wooden-Idol. The
Imperial Law against such disorders we have in L. ob. id. sl. ad legem Aquill.
and in ff. l. 47. Tit. 7. Arborem furtim caesarum: See also Triphon. L. ig. de
Bon. off. cont. tab. vel in ligna focaria. L. Ligni ff. de Lege 3. etc.

To these I might add the Laws of our King Inas or as the Learned Lambert calls
them, (...) de priscis Anglorum legibus, whose Title is, Be (...): of Burning
Trees: The Sanction runs thus.

If any one set fire of a felled Wood, he shall be punished, and besides pay
three pounds, and for those who clandestinely cut Wood ( of which the very
sound of the Axe shall be sufficient Conviction) for every Tree, he shall be
mulcted thirty shillings. A Tree so felled under whose Shadow thirty Hoggs can
stand, shall be mulcted at three pounds, etc.

6. I have heard, that in the great Expedition of 88, it was expressly enjoined
the Spanish Commanders of that signal Armada; that if when landed they should
not be able to subdue our Nation, and make good their Conquest; they should yet
be sure not to leave a Tree standing in the Forest of Dean: It was like the
Policy of the Philistines, when the poor Israelites went down to their Enemies
Smiths to sharpen every man his Tools; for as they said, lest the Hebrews make
them Swords, or Spears; so these, lest the English build them Ships, and Men of
War: Whether this were so, or not; certain it is, we cannot be too jealous for
the preservation of our Woods; and especially of those eminent, and, with care,
inexhaustible Magazines: I dare not suggest the encouragement of a yet farther
restraint, that even Proprietors themselves should not presume to make havoc
of some of their own Woods, to feed their prodigality, and heap fuel to their
vices; but it is worthy of our observation, that (in that in-imitable Oration,
the second Philippic) Cicero does not so sharply reproach his great Antagonist
for any other of his Extravagancies (which yet he there enumerates) as for his
wasteful disposure of certain Wood-lands belonging to the Commonwealth,
amongst his jovial Bravo's, and lewd Companions: tua ista detrimenta sunt
(meaning his Debauches) illa nostra; speaking of the Timber.

7. But to the Laws: it were to be wished that our tender, and improvable
Woods, should not admit of Cattle, by any means, till they were quite grown out
of reach; the Statutes which connive at it, in favor of Custom, and for the
satisfying of a few clamorous and rude Commoners, being too indulgent; since it
is very evident, that less then a 14. or 15. years enclosure is, in most
places, too soon; and our most material Trees would be of infinite more worth
and improvement, were the Standards suffered to grow to Timber, and not so
frequently cut, at the next felling of the Wood, as the general custom is. In
22 Edw. 4. the liberty arrived but to seven years after a felling of a Forest
or Purlieu; and but three years before, without special license: This was very
narrow; but let us then look on England as an overgrown Country.

8. Wood in Parks was afterward to be four years Fenced, upon felling: and
yearling Colts, and Calves might be put into enclosed Woods after two: By the
13 Eliz. five years, and no other Cattle till six, if the growth was under
fourteen years; or until eight, if exceeding that age till the last felling:
All which Statutes being by the Act of Hen. 8. but temporal, this Parliament of
Eliz. thought fit to make perpetual.

9. Then, to prevent the destructive razing, and converting of Woods to
Pasture: No wood of two Acres, and above two furlongs from the Mansion House,
should be indulged: And the prohibitions are good against Assarts made in
forests, etc. without license: The Penalties are indeed great; but how seldom
inflicted? and what is now more easy, than Compounding for such a license?

In some parts of Germany, where a single Tree is observed to be extraordinary
fertile, a constant, and plentiful Mast-bearer; there are Laws to prohibit
their felling without special leave: And it was well Enacted amongst us, that
even the Owners of woods within Chases, should not cut down the Timber without
view of Officers; this Act being in affirmance of the Common Law, and not to be
violated without Prescription: See the Case cited by my Lord Cook in his
Comment on Littleton. Tenure Burgage. L. 2. Sect. 170. Or if not within Chases,
yet where a Common-person had liberty of Chase, etc. and this would be of much
benefit, had the Regarders performed their duty, as it is at large described in
the Writ of the 12 Articles; and that the Surcharge of the Forests had been
honestly inspected with the due Perambulations, and ancient Metes: Thus should
the Justices of Eire dispose of no Woods without express Commission, and in
convenient places: Minuti blaterones quercuum, culi, and curbi, as our Law
terms wind-falls, dotterels, scrags, etc. and no others.

10. Care is likewise by our Laws to be taken that no unnecessary Imbezelment
be made by pretenses of Repair of Paling, Lodges, Browse for Deer, etc.
Wind-falls, Root-falls; dead, and Sear-trees, all which is subject to the
Inspection of the VVarders, Justices, etc. and even trespasses done de Viridi
on boughs of Trees, Thickets, and the like; which (as has been showed) are very
great impediments to their growth and prosperity, and should be duly looked
after, and punished; and the great neglect of Swainmote-Courts reformed, etc.
See Consuet. and Assis. Forest. Pannagium, or Pastura pecorum and de Glandibus,
Fleta, etc. Manwoods Forest-lawes: Cook pla. fol. 366. li. 8. fol. 138.

11. Finally, that the exorbitance, and increase of devouring Iron-mills were
looked into, as to their distance, and number near the Seas, or Navigable
Rivers; And what if some of them were even removed* into another world? 'twere
better to purchase all our Iron out of America, than thus to exhaust our woods
at home, although (I doubt not) they might be so ordered, as to be rather a
means of conserving them. There was a Statute made by Queen Eliz. to prohibit
the converting of Timber trees to Coal, or other Fuel for the use of
Iron-mills; if the Tree were of one foot square, and growing within fourteen
Miles of the Sea, or the greater Rivers, etc. it is pity some of those places in
Kent, Sussex, and Surrey were excepted in the Proviso, for the reason expressed
in a Statute made 23 Eliz. by which even the employing of any under-wood, as
well as great Trees, was prohibited within 22 miles of London, and many other
Navigable Rivers, Creeks, and other lesser distances from some parts of
Sussex-Downs, Cinque Ports, Havens, etc.

There are several Acres of wood-land of no mean circuit near Rochester, in the
County of Kent, extending as far as Bexley, and indeed, for many miles about
Shoters-Hill, near the River of Thames, which, were his Majesty owner of, might
in few years, be of an un-valuable Improvement and benefit, considering how apt
they are to grow Forest, and how opportune they lie for the use of his Royal
Navy at Chatham.

12. But yet to prove what it is to manage VVoods discreetly; I read of one Mr.
Christopher Darell a Surrey Gentleman of Nudigate, that had a particular
Indulgence for the cutting of his Woods at pleasure, though a great Iron:
Master; because he so ordered his Works, that they were a means of preserving
even his VVoods; notwithstanding those unsatiable devourers: This may appear a
Paradox, but is to be made out; and I have heard my own Father (whose Estate
was none of the least wooded in England) affirm, that a Forge, and some other
Mills, to which he furnished much fuel, were a means of maintaining, and
improving his woods; I suppose, by increasing the Industry of Planting, and
care; as what he has now left standing of his own Planting, enclosing, and
cherishing, in the possession of my most honored Brother, George Evelin of
Wotton in the same County, does sufficiently evince; a most laudable Monument
of his Industry, and rare Example, for without such an Example, and such an
Application, I am no Advocate for Iron-works, but a declared denouncer: But
Nature has thought fit to produce this wasting-Oare more plentifully in
Wood-land, than any other Ground, and to enrich our Forests to their own
Destruction, O Poverty, still safe! and therefore found
Insep'rably with Mischiefs under ground!
Woods tall, and Reverend from all time appear
Inviolable, where no Mine is near.
O semper bona pauperies! and conditus alta
Thesaurus tellure nocens! O semper ovantes,
Integra, salvaque solo non divite Sylva!
Couleii Pl. l. 6. for so our sweet Poet deplores the Fate of the Forest of
Dean.

13. The same Act we have Confirmed, and enlarged in the Seventeenth of the
said Queen, for the preserving of Timber Trees, and the Penalties of impairing
VVoods much increased; the Tops and offals only permitted to be made use of
for this employment.

14. As to the Law of Tithes, I find Timber Trees pay none, but others do, both
for Body, Branches, Bark, Fruit, Root, and even the Suckers growing out of
them; and the Tenth of the Body sold, or kept: And so of VVillows, Sallows, and
all other Trees not apt for Timber: Also of Sylva caedua, as Coppices, and
Underwoods, pay the tenth when ever the Proprietor receives his nine Parts.
But if any of these we have named un-exempted are cut only for Mounds,
Fencing, or Plow-boot within the Parish in which they grow, or for the Fuel of
the Owner, no Tithes are due, though the Vicar have the Tyth-wood, and the
Parson that of the places so enclosed; nor are Underwoods grub'd up by the
Roots Tythable, unless for this, and any of the former cases there be
Prescription. But for Timber Trees, such as Oak, Ash, Elm (which are accounted
Timber in all places after the first twenty years) also Beech, Horn-beam,
Maple, Aspen, and even Hasel (many of which are in some Countries reputed
Timber) they are not to pay Tithes, unless they are felled before the said age
of twenty years from their first Planting. Note here,

If the Owner fell a fruit-tree (of which the Parson has had tithe that year)
and convert the wood into fuel, the tithe shall cease; because he cannot
receive the tithe of one thing twice in one year.

Beech, in Countries where it abounds, is not tythable; because in such places
it is not accounted Timber. 16 Jac. Co. B. Pinders Case.

Cherry-trees in Buckinghamshire have been adjudged Timber, and Tythe-free.
Pasch. 17 Jac. B.R.

If a Tree be lop'd under twenty years growth, and afterward be permitted to
grow past twenty years, and then be lop'd again, no tithe is due for it, though
at the first cutting it were not so.

If wood be cut for hedges, which is not tythable, and any be left of it
un-employ'd, no tithe shall be paid for it.

If wood be cut for Hop-poles (where the Parson or Vicar has tithe Hops) in
this case he shall not have tithe of Hop-poles.

If a great wood consist chiefly of Under wood Tythable, and some great trees
of Beech, or the like grow dispersedly amongst them; Tithe is due, unless the
Custom be otherwise of all both great and lesser together: And in like manner
if a wood consist for the most part of Timber trees, with some small
scatterings of Underwood amongst them, no Tithe shall be paid for the Under
wood or Bushes. Trin. 19 Jac. B.R. Adjudg. 16 Jac. in C.B. Leonards case.

No Tithe is to be paid of Common of Estovers, or the wood burnt in ones House.
Now as to the manner of Payment.

To give the Parson the Tenth Acre of Wood in a Coppice, or the tenth Cord
(provided they are equal) is a good payment, and setting forth of Tithe,
especially if the Custom confirm it.

The Tithe of Mast of Oak, or Beech, if sold, must be answered by the tenth
Penny: if eaten by Swine, the worth of it. And thus much we thought sit to add
concerning Predial Tithes; who has desire to be farther informed may consult my
Lord Cook's Rep. 11.48, 49.81. Plow. 470. Brownlows Rep. 1 part. 94. 2 part.
150. D. and St. 169. etc: But let us see what others do.

15. The King of Spain has near Bilbao, sixteen times as many Acres of
Copse-wood as are sit to be cut for Coal in one year; so that when it is ready
to be felled, an Officer first marks such as are like to prove Ship-timber,
which are let stand, as so many sacred, and dedicate Trees: But by this means
the Iron works are plentifully supplied in the same place, without at all
diminishing the stock of Timber. Then in Biscay again, every Proprietor, and
other, Plants three for one which he cuts down; and the Law obliging them is
most severely executed. There indeed are few, or no Copses; but all are
Pollards; and the very lopping (I am assured) does furnish the Iron works with
sufficient to support them.

16. What the practice is for the maintaining of these kind of Plantations in
Germany, and France, has already been observed to this Illustrious Society by
the Learned Dr. Meret; viz that the Lords and (for the Crown Lands) the Kings
Commissioners, divide the Woods, and Forests, into eighty partitions; every
year felling one of the divisions; so as no wood is sell'd in less than
fourscore years: And when any one partition is to be cut down, the Officer, or
Lord contracts with the Buyer that he shall at the distance of every twenty
foot (which is somewhat near) leave a good, fair, sound and fruitful Oak
standing. Those of 'twixt forty, and fifty years they reckon for the best, and
then they are to fence these Trees from all sorts of Beasts, and injuries, for
a competent time; which being done, at the season, downfall the Acorns, which
(with the Autumnal rains beaten into the earth) take root, and in a short time
furnish all the Wood again, where they let them grow for four, or five years;
and then grub up some of them for Fuel, or Transplantations, and leave the most
provable of them, to continue for Timber.

17. The French King permits none of his Oak woods, though belonging (some of
them) to Mounsieur (his Royal Brother) in Appenage, to be cut down; till his
own Surveyors, and Officers, have first marked them out; nor are any felled
beyond such a Circuit: Then are they sufficiently fenced by him who buys; and
no Cattle whatsoever suffered to be put in, till the very seedlings (which
spring up of the Acorns) are perfectly out of danger. But these, and many other
wholesome Ordinances, especially, as they concern the Forest of Dean, we have
comprised in the late Statute of the twentieth of his Majesty's Reign, which I
find Enacted five years after the first Edition of this Treatise: And these
Laws are worthy our perusal; as also the Statute prescribing a Scheme of
Proportions for the several scantlings of Building-Timber (besides what we have
already touched Chap. 31.) which you have 19 Car. 2. entitled, An Act for the
Re-building of London; to which I refer the Reader.

CHAP. XXXIV. The Paraenesis and Conclusion, containing some Encouragements and
Proposals, for the Planting, and Improvement of his Majesty's Forests.
1. SInce our Forests are undoubtedly the greatest Magazines of the Wealth, and
Glory of this Nation; and our Oaks the truest Oracles of its perpetuity and
happiness, as being the only support of that Navigation which makes us feared
abroad, and flourish at Home; it has been strangely wondered at by some good
Patriots, how it comes to pass that many Gentlemen have frequently repaired,
or gained a sudden Fortune, with Plowing part of their Parks, and setting out
their fat grounds to Gardeners, etc. and very wild wood-land parcels (as may be
instanced in several places) to dressers of Hop-yards, etc. whiles the Royal
portion lies folded up in a Napkin, uncultivated, and neglected; especially,
those Great, and ample Forests; where though plowing, and sowing has been
forbidden, a Royal Command, and Design, may well dispense with it, and the
breaking up of those Intervals, advance the growth of the Trees to an
incredible Improvement.

2. It is therefore insisted on, that there is not a cheaper, easier, or more
prompt expedient to advance Ship timber, than to solicit, that in all his
Majesty's Forests, VVoods, and Parks, the spreading Oak, etc. (which we have
formerly described) be cherished, by Plowing, and sowing Barley, Rye, etc.
(with due supply of culture and Soil, between them) as far as may (without
danger of the Plow-share) be broken up. But this is only where these Trees are
arrived to some magnitude, and stand at competent distances; a hundred, or
fifty yards (for their Roots derive relief far beyond the reach of any boughs)
as do the Wallnut-trees in Burgundy, which stand in their best Plowed lands.

3. But, that we may particularize in his Majesty's Forests of Dean, Sherewood,
etc. and in some sort gratify the Quaeries of the Honorable, the principal
Officers and Commissioners of the Navy, I am advised by such as are every way
judicious, and of long experience in those parts; that to enclose would be an
excellent way: But it is to be considered, that the People, viz. Foresters, and
Bordurers, are not generally so civil, and reasonable, as might be wished; and
therefore to design a solid Improvement in such places, his Majesty must assert
his Power, with a firm and high Resolution to reduce these men to their due
Obedience, and to a necessity of submitting to their own, and the public
utility; though they preserved their industry this way, at a very tolerable
rate upon that condition, whiles some person of trust, and integrity, did
regulate, and supervise the Mounds and fences, and destine some portions
frequently set apart, for the raising, and propagating of Woods, till the whole
Nation were furnished for posterity.

4. And which Work if his Majesty shall resolve to accomplish, he will leave
such an everlasting Obligation on his People, and raise such a Monument to his
fame, as the Ages for a thousand years to come, shall have cause to celebrate
his precious Memory, and his Royal Successors to emulate his Virtue. For thus
(besides the future expectations) it would in present, be no deduction from his
Majesty's Treasure, but some increase; and fall in time to be a fair and worthy
Accession to it; whiles this kind of propriety would be the most likely
expedient to civilize those wild and poor Bordurers; and to secure the vast and
spreading heart of the Forest, which with all this Indulgence, would be ample
enough for a Princely Demeasnes: And if the difficulty be to find out who
knows, or acknowledges what are the Bordures; this Article were worthy, and
becoming of as serious an Inquisition, as the Legislative Power of the whole
Nation can contrive.

5. The Sum of all, is; get the Bordures well Tenanted, by long Terms, and
easy Rents, and this will invite and encourage Takers; whilst the middle, most
secure, and interior parts would be a Royal portion. Let his Majesty therefore
admit of any willing Adventurers in this vast Circle for such Enclosures in the
Precincts; and rather of more, than of few, though an hundred or two, should
join together for any Enclosure of five hundred Acres more, or less; that
multitudes being thus engaged, the consideration might procure, and facilitate
a full discovery of latter Encroachments, and fortify the recovery by
favorable Rents, Improvements, and Reversions by Copyhold, or what other
Tenures and Services his Majesty shall please to accept of.

6. Now for the Planting of Woods in such places (which is the main Design of
this whole Treatise) the Hills, and rough Grounds will do well; but they are
the rich fat Vales, and flats which do best deserve the charge of walls; such
as that spot affords; and the Haw-thorn well plash'd (single or double) is a
better, and more natural fence, than unmorter'd walls, could our industry
arrive to the making of such as we have described: Besides, they are lasting,
and profitable; and then one might allow sufficient Bordure for a Mound of any
thickness, which may be the first charge, and well supported, and rewarded by
the culture of the Land thus enclosed.

7. For Example, suppose a man would take in 500 Acres of good Land, let the
Mounds be of the wildest ground, as fittest for wood: Two hedges with their
Vallations, and Trenches will be requisite in all the Round; viz. one next to
the Enclosure, the other about the Thicket to fence it from Cattle: This,
between the two hedges (of whatsoever breadth) is fittest for Plantation: In
these Hedges might be tried the Plantation of Stocks, in the intervals all
manner of wood-seeds sown (after competent Plowings) as Acorns, Mast, Fir,
Pine, Nuts, etc. the first year chasing away the Birds, because of the Fir and
Pine Seeds, for reasons given: the second year loosning the ground, and
thinning the supernumeraries, etc. this is the most frugal way: Or by another
Method, the waste places of Forests and Woods (which by through experience is
known and tried) might be perfectly cleansed; and then allowing two or three
Plowings, well rooted stocks be set, cut and trimmed as is requisite; and that
the Timber Trees may be excellent, those afterward Copsed, and the choicest
stocks kept shreaded. If an Enclosure be sowed, the Seeds may be (as was
directed) of all the species, not forgetting the best Pines, Fir, etc. whiles
the yearly removal of very encumbrances only, will repay the Workmen, who sell
the Quick, or reserve it to store other Enclosures, and soften the circumjacent
grounds, to the very great improvement of what remains.

8. And how if in such fencing-works, we did sometimes imitate what Quintus
Curtius, lib. 6. has Recorded of the Mardorum gens, near to the Confines of
Hyrcania, who did by the close Planting of Trees alone upon the Bordures, give
so strange a check to the Power of that great Conqueror Alexander? They were a
barbarous People indeed, but in this worthy our imitation; and the Work so
handsomely, and particularly described, that I shall not grieve to recite it.
Arbores densae sunt de industria consitae, quarum teneros adhuc ramos manu
flectunt, quos intortos rursus inserunt terrae: Inde, velut ex alia radice,
laetiores virent trunci: hos, qua natura fert, adolescere non sinunt: quippe
alium alii, quasi nexu conserunt: qui ubi multa fronde vestiti sunt, operiunt
terram. Itaque occulti ramorum velut laquei perpetua sepe iter claudunt, etc.
The Trees (says he) were Planted so near and thick together of purpose, that
when the boughs were yet young and flexible, bent, and wreathed within one
another, their Tops were bowed into the earth (as we submerge our Layers)
whence taking fresh roots, they shot up new stems, which not being permitted to
grow as of themselves they would have done, they so knit, and perplexed one
within another, that when they were clad with leaves, they even covered the
ground, and enclosed the whole Country with a kind of living net, and
impenetrable hedge, as the Historian continues the description; and this is not
unlike what I am told is frequently practiced in diverse places of Devon; where
the Oaks being planted very near the foot of those high Mounds by which they
separate their Lands; so Root themselves into the Bank, that when it fails and
crumbles down, the Fense continues still maintained by them with exceeding
profit. Such works as these would become a Cato, or Varro indeed, one that were
Pater Patriae, non sibi soli natus, born for Posterity; but we are commonly of
another mould, -- and fruges consumere nati.

9. A fair advance for speedy growth, and noble Trees (especially for Walks and
Avenues) may be assuredly expected from the Graffing of young Oaks, and Elms
with the best of their kinds; and where the goodliest of these last are
growing, the ground would be plowed, and finely raked in the season when the
Scales fall; that the showers and dews fastening the Seed where the wind drives
it, it may take Root, and hasten (as it will) to a sudden Tree; especially, if
seasonable shreading be applied, which has sometimes made them arrive to the
height of Twelve foot by the first three years, after which they grow a main.
And if such were planted as near to one another as in the Examples we have
alleged, it is almost incredible, what a paling they would be to our most
exposed Plantations, mounting up their wooden walls to the clouds: And indeed
the shelving, and natural declivity of the Ground more or less to our unkind
Aspects, and bleak Winds, does best direct to the thickning of these
protections; and the benefit of that, soon appear, and recompense our industry
in the smoothness and integrity of the Plantations so defended.

10. That great care be had of the Seeds which we intend to sovv has been
already advised; for it has been seen, that Woods of the same age; planted in
the same soil, discover a visible difference in the Timber and growth; and
where this variety should happen, if not from the seed, will be hard to
interpret; therefore, let the place, soil and growth of such Trees from whence
you have your seeds, be diligently examined; and why not this, as well as in
our care of Animals for our breed and store?

11. As to the Form, obey the natural site, and submit to the several guizes;
but ever declining to enclose High ways, and Common-Roads as much as possible.
For the rest, be pleased to reflect on what we have already said, to encourage
the Planting of the large spreading Oak above all that species; the amplitude
of the distance which they require resigned to the care of the Verderer for
grazing Cattle, Deer, etc. and for the great and masculine beauty which a wild
Quincunx, as it were, of such Trees would present to your eye.

12. But to advance his Majesty's Forests to this height of perfection, I
should again urge the removal of some of our most mischievously placed Iron
mills; if that at least be true which some have affirmed, that we had better
Iron, and cheaper from Foreigners, when those works were strangers amongst us.
I am informed, that the New-English (who are now become very numerous, and
hindered in their advance and prospect of the Continent by their surfeit of the
Woods which we want) did about twelve years since, begin to clear their High
ways by two Iron-mills: I am sure their zeal has sufficiently wasted our
stately Woods, and Steel in the bowels of their Mother old England; and 'twere
now but expedient, their Brethren should hasten thither to supply us with Iron
for the peace of our days; whilst his Majesty becomes the great Sovereign of
the Ocean, free Commerce, Nemorum Vindex and Instaurator magnus. This were the
only way to render both our Countries habitable indeed, and the fittest
Sacrifice for the Royal Oaks, and their Hamadryad's to whom they owe more than
a slight submission: And he that should deeply consider the prodigious waste
which these voracious Iron, and Glasse-works have formerly made but in one
County alone, the County of Sussex, for 120 Miles in length, and thirty in
breadth (for so wide, and spacious was the ancient Andradswald, of old one
entire Wood, but of which there remains now little, or no sign) would be
touched with no mean Indignation: Certainly, the goodly Rivers and Forests of
the other World, would much better become our Iron, and Saw-mills, than these
exhausted Countries; and we prove gainers by the timely removal: I have said
this already, and I cannot too often inculcate it for the Concerns of a Nation,
whose only Protection (under God) are her Wooden Walls.

13. Another thing to be recommended (and which would prove no less than
thirty years, in some places forty, and generally twenty years advance) were a
good (if well executed) Act to save our Standards, and borduring Trees from the
Ax of the Neighborhood: And who would not preserve Timber, when within so few
years the price is almost quadrupl'd? I assure you standards of twenty, thirty,
or forty years growth, are of a long day for the Concernments of a Nation.

14. And though we have in our general Chapter of Copses, declared what by our
Laws, and common usage is expected at every Fell (and which is indeed most
requisite, till our store be otherwise supplied) yet might much even of that
rigor be abated, by no unfrugal permissions to take down more of the Standards
for the benefit of the Underwoods (especially where, by over dropping, and
shade they interrupt the kindly Dews, Rains, and Influences which nourish them)
provided that there were a proportionable number of Timber Trees duly, and
thoroughly Planted, and preserved in the Hedge-rows and Bordures of our grounds;
in which case, even the total clearing of some Copses would be to their great
advance, as by sad experience has been taught some good Husbands, whose
necessities sometimes forced them to violate their Standards, and more grown
Trees during the late Tyranny.

15. Nor will it be here unseasonable to advise, that where Trees are
manifestly perceived to decay, they be marked out for the Ax, that so the
younger may come on for a supply; especially, where they are chiefly Elms;
because their successors hasten to their height and perfection in a competent
time; but beginning once to grow sick of Age, or other infirmity, suddenly
impair; and lose much of their value yearly: besides, that the increase of
this, and other speedy Timber, would spare the more Oak for Navigation, and the
sturdier uses.

How goodly a sight were it, if most of the Demesnes of our Country Gentlemen
were crowned and incircl'd with such stately rows of Limes, Firs, Elms, and
other ample, shady and venerable Trees as adorn New-Hall in Essex, the Seat of
that Suffolk Knight near Yarmouth, and our neighboring Pastures at Barnes? Yet
were these Plantations but of late years in comparison: It were a noble, and
immortal providence to imitate these good Husbands in larger, and more august
Plantations of such useful Trees, for Timber and Fuel, as well as for Shade,
and Ornament to our Dwellings.

16. But these incomparable undertakings will best of all become the Inspection
and care of the Honorable Lieutenants, and Rangers, when they delight
themselves as much in the goodlinesse of their Trees, as other men generally do
in their Dogs, and Horses, for Races, and Hunting; neither of which Recreations
is comparable to that of Planting, either for Virtue, or Pleasure, were things
justly considered according to their true estimation: Not yet that I am of so
morose an humor, that I reprove any of those noble, and manly Diversions,
seasonably used; but because I would court the Industry of great and opulent
persons, to profitable, and permanent delights: For, suppose that Ambition were
changed into a laudable emulation, who should best, and with most artifice,
raise a Plantation of Trees, that should have all the proper Ornaments, and
perfections their nature is susceptible of, by their direction and
encouragement; such as Aelian sums up lib. 3. c. 14. (...), etc. kind, and
gentle Limbs, plenty of large leaves, an ample, and fair body, profound, or
spreading Roots, strong against impetuous Winds (for so I affect to read it)
extensive, and venerable Shade, and the like: Methinks there were as much a
subject of Glory as could be phancied of the kind; and comparable, I durst
pronounce, preferrable, to any of their Recreations; and how goodly an Ornament
to their Demesnes and Dwellings, let their own eyes be the judges.

17. One Encouragement more, I would reinforce from an History I have read of a
certain frugal, and most Industrious Italian Nobleman, who, after his Lady was
brought to Bed of a Daughter, considering that Wood and Timber was a Revenue
coming on whilst the Owners were asleep: commanded his Servants immediately to
Plant in his Lands (which were ample) Oaks, Ashes, and other profitable, and
Marketable Trees, to the number of an Hundred thousand; as undoubtedly
calculating, that each of those Trees, might be worth twenty pence, before his
Daughter became Marriageable, which would amount to 100000 francs (which is
near ten thousand pounds sterling) intended to be given with his Daughter for a
Portion. This was good Philosophy, and such as I am assured is frequently
practiced in Flanders upon the very same account: Let us see it once take
effect amongst our many slothful Gentry, who have certainly as large Demesnes,
and yet are so deficient in that decent point of timely providing for their
numerous Children: And those who have none, let them the rather Plant: Trees
and Vegetables have perpetuated some Names longer, and better than a Pedigree
of a numerous Offspring; and it were a pledge of a Noble Mind, to oblige the
future Age by our particular Industry, and by a long lasting train, with the
living work of our own hands: But I now proceed to more general Concerns, in
order to the Quaeries, and first to the proportion.

18. It were but just, and infinitely befitting the miserable needs of the
whole Nation, that every twenty Acres of Pasture, made an allowance for half an
Acre of Timber, the Ground dug about Christmas, casting the Grassy-side
downwards 'till June, then dug again, and about November stirred afresh, and
sown with Mast, or planted in a clump, well preserved, and fenced for 14, or 15
years; unless that Sheep might happily Graze after 4 or 5 years: And where the
young Trees stand too thick, there to draw, and transplant them in the
Hedge-rows, which would also prove excellent shelter for the Cattle: This
Husbandry would more especially become Northhamptonshire, Lincolnshire,
Cornwall, and such other of our Countries as are the most naked of Timber,
Fuel, etc. and unprovided of covert: For it is rightly observed, that the most
fruitful places, least abound in wood, and do most stand in need of it.

19. Such as are ready to tell ye their Lands are so wet, that their Woods do
not thrive in them; let them be converted to Pasture; or bestow the same
industry on them which good husbands do in Meadows by draining: It is a
sloathfullnesse unpardonable; as if the pains would not be as fully recompensed
in the growth of their Timber, as in that of their grass: Where poor hungry
Woods grow, rich Corn, and good Cattle would be more plentifully bred; and it
were beneficial to convert some Wood-land (where the proper virtue is
exhausted) to Pasture and Tillage; provided, that fresh land were improved also
to wood in recompense, and to balance the other.

20. Where we find uliginous and starved places (which sometimes obey no Art or
Industry to drain, and of which our pale and fading Corn is a sure indication)
we are as it were courted to obey Nature, and improve them for the propagation
of Sallyes, VVillows, Alders, Abele, Sycomore, Aspine, Bircb, and the like
hasty and profitable growers, by ranging them, casting of Ditches, Trenches,
etc. as before has been taught.

21. In the mean while, it is a thing to be deplored, that some persons bestow
more in grubbing, and dressing a few Acres which has been excellent wood, to
convert it into wretched pasture, not worth a quarter of what the Trees would
have yielded, well ordered, and left standing; since it is certain, that barren
land planted with wood, will trebble the expense in a short time. Of this, the
R. Honorable the L. Vicount Scudamor may give fair proof, who having felled
(as I am credibly informed) a decayed Wood, intended to be set to Tennants; but
upon second thoughts (and for that his Lordship saw it apt to cast Wood)
enclosed and preserved; it yielded him, before thirty years were expired, near
1000 pound upon Wood-Falls, whereas the utmost Rent of the whole price of Land
yearly, was not above 8 pound 10 shillings. The like I am able to confirm by
instancing a noble Person, who (a little before our unhappy Wars) having sown
three or four Acres with Acorns, the fourth year transplanted them which grew
too thick all about his Lord-ship: These Trees are now of that stature, and so
likely to prove excellent Timber, that they are already judged to be almost as
much worth as the whole Demesnes; and yet they take off nothing from other
profits, having been discreetly disposed of at the first designment. And
supposing the Longuaevity of Trees should not extend to the Periods we have
(upon so good account) produced; Yet, neither is their arrival to a very
competent perfection, so very discouraging; since I am credibly informed, that
several Persons have built of Timber (and that of Oak) which were Acorns within
this forty years; and I find it credibly reported, that even our famous Forest
of Dean, has been utterly wasted no less than three several times, within the
space of Nine-hundred years. The Prince Elector Frederic IV, in the year 1606.
sowed a part of that most barren Heath of Lambertheim, with Acorns after
plowing, as I have been informed; it is now likely to prove a most goodly
Forest, though all this while miserably neglected by reason of the Wars. For
the care of Planting Trees, should indeed be recommended to Princes and great
Persons, who have the Fee of the Estate; Tennants upon the Rack by reason of
the tedious expectation, and jealousy of having their Lands enhanc'd, are for
the most part averse from this Husbandry; so that unless the Landlord will be
at the whole Charge of Planting, and Fencing (without which as good no
Planting) little is to be expected; and whatsoever is proposed to them above
their usual course, is looked upon as the whim and fancy of speculative
Persons, which they turn into ridicule when they are applied to Action; and
this, says an ingenious and excellent Husband (whose Observations have afforded
me no little treasure) might be the reason, why the prime Writers of all Ages,
endeavored to involve their Discourses with Allegories, and Aenigmatical
terms, to protect them from the contempt, and pollution of the Vulgar, which
has been of some ill Consequence in Husbandry; for that very few Writers of
Worth, have adventured upon so plain a Subject, though doubtless to any
Considering Person, the most Delightful kind of Natural Philosophy, and that
which employs the most useful part of the Mathematics.

The Right Honorable my Lord Viscount Mountague has Planted many thousands of
Oaks, which I am told, he draws out of Copses, big enough to defend themselves;
and that with such success, as has exceedingly improved his Possessions; and it
is a worthy Example. To conclude, I can show an Avenue Planted to a House
standing in a barren Park, the Soil a cold Clay; it consists totally of Oaks,
one hundred in number: The person who first set them (dying very lately) lived
to see them spread their branches 123 foot in compass, which at distance of 24
foot, mingling their shady tresses for above 1000 in length, form themselves
into one of the most venerable, and stately Arbor Walks, that in my life I ever
beheld: This is at Baynards in Surrey, and belonging to my most honored
Brother (because a most industrious Planter of Wood) Richard Evelyn Esquire The
Walk is broad 56 foot, and one Tree with another containing by estimation three
quarters of a load of Timber in each Tree, and in their lops three Cord of
firewood: Their Bodies are not of the tallest, having been topped when they
were young, to reduce them to an uniform height; yet is the Timber most
excellent for its scantling, and for their heads, few in England excelling
them: where some of their contemporaries, were planted single in the Park
without cumber, they spread above fourscore foot in arms.

22. I have produced these Examples, because they are conspicuous, full of
encouragement, worthy our imitation; and that from these, and sundry others
which I might enumerate, we have made this Observation, that almost any Soil is
proper for some profitable Timber Trees or other, which is good for very little
else.

23. The bottoms of Downs, and like places well Plowed, and sown will bear
lusty Timber, being broken up, and let lie till Mid-summer, and then stirred
again before sowing about November.

An old, and judicious Planter of Woods, prescribes us these Directions, for
improving of Sheep-walks, Downs, Heaths, etc. Suppose, on every such Walk on
which 500 Sheep might be kept, there were Plowed up twenty Acres ( Plowed
pretty deep, that the Roots might take hold, and be able to resist the Winds)
this should be sowed with Mast of Oak, Beech, Chats of Ash, Maple-keys, Sloes,
Service-berries, Nuts, Bullis, etc. bruised Crabs, and Haws; mingled and
scattered about the sides and ends of the Ground, near a yard in breadth. On
the rest sow no Haws, but some few Crabkernells: Then begin at a side, and
sow five yards broad, Plowing under the Mast, etc. very shallow; then leave
six yards in breadth, and sow, and Plow five yards more, and so from side to
side; remembering to leave a yard and half at the last side; let the rest of the
head-lands lie, till the Remainder of the Close be sown in March with Oats,
etc. to preserve it from hurt of Cattle, and potching the Ground, when the
Spring is of two years growth, draw part of it for Quick-sets; and when the
rest of the Trees are of six years shoot, exhaust it of more; and leave not
above forty of either side, each row five yards distant; and here, and there a
Crab stock to graff on, and in the invironing Hedge (to be left thick) let each
Tree stand four yards asunder; which if forty four were spared, will amount to
about 4000 Trees: At twenty years end stock up 2000 of them, lop a thousand
more every ten years, and reserve the remaining thousand for Timber: Judge what
this may be worth in a short time, besides the Grass, etc. which will grow the
first six or seven years, and the benefit of shelter for Sheep in ill Weather,
when they cannot be folded; and the Pasture which will be had under the Trees,
now at eleven yards interval, by reason of the stocking up those 2000 we
mentioned, excepting the Hedges; and if in any of these Places any considerable
waters fortune to lie in their bottoms, Fowl would abundantly both breed, and
harbor there. These are admirable Directions for Park-lands where shelter and
Food is scarcy.

But even this Improvement yet does no way reach, what I have met withal in the
most accurate, and no less laborious Calculation of Captain Smith upon this
very Topic; where he Demonstratively asserts, that a thousand Acres of Land,
Planted at one foot interval, in 7201 rows; taking up 51854401 Plants of Oak,
Ash, Chessnut (or to be sown) taking up 17284800 of each sort, and fit to be
transplanted at three years period (if set in good ground) are worth eighteen
pence the hundred; and there being 345696 hundred, it amounts to no less then
25927 l. 4 s. besides the Chessnuts, of which there being 1728480 l. (valued
at, and worth half a Crown the Hundred) they come to 21606 l. and the total of
all, to 47533 l. 4 s.

This being made out, consider what an immense sum, great Trees would amount
to, and in a large quantity of Land; such as were worthy a Royal undertaking:
It is computed, that at three foot distance, the first Felling (that is, eight,
or nine years after their Planting) would be worth in Hoops, Poles, Firing,
etc. 55015 l. and the second Fell, 28657 l. 19 s. 5 d. And the fourth (which
may be about thirty two years from their Semination) 90104 l. 17 s. and so
forward.

At four foot interval, and Felling, according to the same proportion, you may
likewise reckon; and in 11 years with three years Crop of Wheat (sowed at first
between) it will amount to 34001 l. 9 s. 4 d. And the next, very much more; in
regard the Wood will spring up thicker: So as at the fifth Fell, the account
stands 126 992 l. 10 s. 2 d. etc. and at the seventh (whoever lives to it)
200000: And if planted at wider distance, viz. 18 foot (according to the
Captains method) at 30, or 40 years growth you may compute them worth 19296^ l.
6 s. And in seventy years, 201001; besides the three years crop of Wheat, in
all 410312 l. 16 s. which at 36 foot interval (accounted the utmost for Timber)
takes up (for 1000 Acres) 40401 Trees for the first 100 years. Then,

To make room, as they grow larger, grubbing up every middle Tree, at 9 l. per
Tree, 19800 Trees amount to 99000 l. and the remaining 20601 at 220 years
growth, at but 8 l. per Tree, comes to 164808 l. besides the inferior Crop of
Meadow, or Corn in all this time, sown in the distances; reckoning for three
years product 90000 Bushels at 5 s. per Bushel, which will amount to 22500 l.
besides the Straw, Chaff, etc. which at 5 s. a Load, and 3 d. a Bush. Chaff,
comes to 2025 l. So as the total Improvement (besides the 217 years emolument
arising from the Corn, Cattle, etc.) amounts to 288333.

And these Trees (as well they may) coming to be worth for Timber, 20 l. an
Oak; the 20601 Trees amount to 412020 l. and the total Improvement of the 1000
Acres (the Corn Profits not computed) ascends to 675833 l. So as admit there
were in all England (and which his Majesty might easily compass, even for his
own Proportion, and for Posterity) 20000 Acres thus Planted, at two foot
diameter (and as may be presumed thirty foot high, which in 150 years, they
might well arrive to) they would be worth 13516660 l. an immense and
stupendous Sum, and an everlasting supply for all the Uses both of Sea and
Land: But it is to Captain Smith's laborious Works (to which I wish all
encouragement) that we have the total Charge of this noble Undertaking from the
first Semination, to their maturity; by which it will be easy to compute what
the Gains will be for any greater or lesser quantity.

But now to return to the Place of Planting (from whence this Calculation has
more than a little diverted) we shall find, as we said, that even in the most
craggie, uneven, cold and exposed places, not fit for Arable, as in Biscay,
etc. and in our very Peaks of Derbyshire, and other Rockie places, Ashes grow
about every Village, and we find that Oak, Beech, Elm, and Ash, will prosper in
the most flinty Soils. And it is truly from these Indications, more than from
any other whatsoever, that a broken, and decaying Farmer, is to be
distinguished from a substantial Freeholder, the very Trees speaking the
conditions of the Master: Let not then the Royal Patrimony bear a Bankrupts
reproach: But to descend yet lower;

24. Had every Acre but three, or four Trees, and as many of Fruit in it as
would a little adorn the Hedge-rows, the Improvement would be of fair advantage
in a few years; for it is a shame that Turnip-planters, should demolish, and
undo hedge-rows near London, where the Mounds and Fences are stripped naked, to
give Sun to a few miserable Roots, which would thrive altogether as well under
them, being skilfully pruned and lopped: Our Gardeners will not believe me, but
I know it to be true, though Pliny had not affirmed it: As for Elms (says he)
their Shade is so gentle and benign, that it nourishes whatsoever grows under
it: And ( lib 17. c. 22.) it is his opinion of all other Trees (very few
excepted) provided their Branches be pared away, which being discreetly done,
improves the Timber as we have already showed.

25. Now let us calculate a little at adventure, and much within what is both
faisible, and very possible; and we shall find, that four Fruit Trees in each
Acre throughout England, the product sold but at six pence the Bushel (but
where do we now buy them so cheap?) will be worth a Million yearly: What then
may we reasonably judge of Timber, admit but at the growth of four pence per
Acre yearly (which is the lowest that can be estimated) it amounting to near
two Millions? if (as it is supposed) there may be five or six and twenty
Millions of square Acres in the Kingdom (besides Fens, Highways, Rivers, etc.
not counted) and without reckoning in the Mast, or loppings, which whosoever
shall calculate from the annual Revenue, the Mast only of Westphalia, a small
and wretched Country im Germany, does yield to that Prince, will conclude to
be no despicable Improvement.

26. In this poor Territory, every Farmer does by ancient custom, Plant so many
Oaks about his Farm, as may suffice to feed his Swine: To effect this they have
been so careful, that when of late years, the Armies infested the poor
Country, both Imperialists, and Protestants; the only Bishopric of Munster
was able to pay One hundred thousand Crowns per mensem (which amounts of our
money to about 25000 l. sterling) besides the ordinary entertainment of their
own Prince and private families. This being incredible to be practiced in so
extreme barren a Country, I thought fit to mention, either to encourage, or
reproach us: General Melander was wont to say, The good Husbandry of their
Ancestors had left them this Stock pro sacra Anchora; considering how the
People were afterward reduced to live even on their Trees, when the Soldiers
had devoured their Hogs; redeeming themselves from great extreamities, by the
Timber which they were at last compelled to cut down, and which, had it
continued, would have proved the utter desolation of that whole Country. I
have this Instance from my most worthy, and honorable Friend Sir William
Curtius (his Majesty's Resident in Germany) who received this particular from
the mouth of Melander himself: In like manner, the Princes, and Freedoms of
Hesse, Saxony, Thuringia, and diverse other places there, make vast incomes of
their Forest-fruit (besides the Timber) for Swine only. I say then, whosoever
shall duly consider this, will find Planting of Wood to be no contemptible
Addition; besides the Pasture much improved, the cooling of fat, and heavy
Cattle, keeping them from injurious motions, disturbance, and running as they
do in Summer to find shelter from the heat, and vexation of flies.

27. But I have done, and it is now time for us to get out of the Wood, and to
recommend this, and all that we have proposed, to His most Sacred Majesty, the
Honorable Parliament, and to the Principal Officers, and Commissioners of the
Royal Navy; that where such Improvements may be made, it be speedily, and
vigorously prosecuted; and where any defects appear, they may be duly reformed.

28. And what if for this purpose there were yet some additional Office
Constituted, which should have a more universal Inspection, and the charge of
all the Woods and Forests in His Majesty's Dominions? This might easily be
performed by Deputies in every County; Persons judicious, and skilful in
Husbandry; and who might be repaired to for advice and direction: And if such
there are at present (as indeed our Laws seem to provide) that their Power be
sufficiently amplified where any thing appears deficient; and as their zeal
excited by worthy encouragements, so might neglects be encountered by a
vigilant and industrious Cheque. It should belong to their Province, to see
that such Proportions of Timber, etc. were Planted, and set out upon every
hundred, or more of Acres, as the Honorable Commissioners have suggested; or,
as might be thought convenient, the quality, and nature of the places prudently
considered: It should be their Office also, to take notice of the growth, and
decay of Woods, and of their fitness for public uses and sale, and of all
these to give Advertisements, that all defect in their ill governing may be
speedily remedied; and the Superior Officer, or Surveyor, should be
accomptable to the Lord Treasurer, and to the principal Officers of his
Majesty's Navy for the time being: And why might not such a Regulation be
worthy the establishing by some Solemn, and public Act of State, becoming our
glorious Prince, SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS, and his prudent Senate, this present
Parliament?

29. We find in Aristotle's Politics, the Constitution of Extraurban Magistrates
to be Sylvarum Custodes; and such were the Consulares Sylvae, which the great
Caesar himself (even in a time when Italy did abound in Timber) Instituted;
and was one of the very first things which he did, at the settling of that
vast Empire, after the Civil Wars had exceedingly waste the Country:
Suetonius relates it in the Life of Julius; and Peter Crinitus in his fifth
Book De honesta disciplina, c. 3. gives this reason for it, Vt materies (says
he) non deesset, qua videlicet Navigia publica possent a praefecturis fabrum,
confici: True it is, that this Office was sometimes called Provincia minor;
but for the most part, annexed, and joined to some of the greatest Consuls
themselves; that facetious sarcasme of the Comoedian (where Plautus names it
Provincia caudicaria) referring only to some under Officer, subservient to the
other: And such a Change is at this day extant amongst the noble Venetians,
who have near Trivisi (besides what they nourish in other places) a goodly
Forest of Oaks, preserved as a Jewel, for the only use of the Arsenal, called
the Montello, which is in length twelve Miles, large five, and near twenty
miles in compass; carefully supervised by a certain Officer, whom they name
il Capitano; and we might Instance in many other prudent States; not to
importune you with the express Laws which Ancus Martius the Nephew of Numa,
and other Princes long before Caesar, did ordain for this very purpose; since
indeed, the care of so public, and honorable an Enterprise as is this of
Planting, and Improving of Woods, is a right noble, and Royal undertaking; as
that of the Forest of Dean, etc. in particular (were it bravely managed) an
Imperial design; and I do pronounce it more worthy of a Prince; who truly
consults his glory in the highest Interest of his Subjects, than that of
gaining Battles, or subduing a Province: And if in saying so, or any thing else
in this rustic Discourse, I have used the freedom of a plain Forester; it is
the Person you command me to put on, and my plea is ready, (...).
Praesente Quercu, ligna quivis colligit.
for who could have spoken less upon so ample a Subject? and therefore I hope
my zeal for it in these Papers, will (besides your Injunctions) excuse the
prolixity of this Digression, and all other the Imperfections of my Services.

Si canimus Sylvas, Sylvae sunt Consule dignae. CHAP. XXXV. An Historical
Account of the Sacredness, and Use of standing Groves, etc.
1. ANd thus have we finished what we esteemed necessary for the Direction of
Planting, and the Culture of Trees and Woods in general; whether for the
raising of new, or preservation of the more Ancient and venerable shades,
crowning the brows of lofty Hills, or furnishing, and adorning the more
fruitful and humble Plains; Groves and Forests, such as were never Profaned by
the Inhumanity of Edge-tools: Woods, whose Original are as unknown as the
Arcadians; like the goodly Cedars of Libanus, Psalm. 104. Arbores Dei according
to the Hebrew, for something doubtless which they noted in the Genius of those
Venerable places besides their mere bulk and Stature: And verily, I cannot
think to have well acquitted my self of this useful Subject, till I shall have
in some sort vindicated the honor of Trees, and Woods, by showing my Reader of
what Estimation they were of old for their Divine, as well as Civil Uses; at
least refresh both Him, and my Self, with what occurs of Historical and
Instructive amongst the Learned concerning them.

2. Though Sylva was the more general Name, denoting a large Tract of Wood, or
Trees, the inciduae and coeduae; yet there were several other Titles attributed
to greater or lesser assemblies of them: As when they Planted them for
Pleasure, and shade only, they had their Nemora; and as we our Parks, for the
preservation of Game, and particularly Venizon, etc. their Saltus, and Sylva
invia, secluded for the most part from the rest, etc. But among Authors, we
meet with nothing more frequent, and indeed more celebrated, than those
Arboreous amenities and Plantations of Woods, which they called Luci; and which
though sometimes we confess, were restrained to certain peculiar places: Yet
were they also promiscuously both used, and taken for all that the wide Forest
comprehends, or can signify. To dismiss a number of Critics, The name Lucus is
derived by Quintilian and others a minime Lucendo because of its densitie --
nullo penetrabilis astro. whence Apuleius used Lucum sublucidum; and the Poets,
Sublustris umbra: Others (on the contrary) have taken it for Light in the
Masculine; because there they kindled Fires, by what accident unknown --
Whether it were
By Lightning sent from Heaven, or else there
The Salvage-men in mutual Wars and Fight,
Had set the Trees on Fire, their Foes to affright.
-- Seu Coeli fulmine misso
Sive quod inter se bellum Sylvestria gentes
Hostibus intulerant ignem, formidinis ergo, etc.
Lucret. l. 5.

Or whether the Trees set Fire on themselves When clashing boughs thwarting,
each other fret.
Mutua dum inter se rami stirpesque teruntur.
For such Accidents, and even the very heat of the Sun alone has kindled
wonderful conflagrations: or happly to consume their Sacrifices, we will not
much insist: The Poets it seems, speaking of Juno, would give it quite another
original, and tune it to their Songs invoking Lucina, whilst the main and
principal difference consisted not so much in the Name, as the Use and
Dedication, which was for silent, awful and more solemn Religion, to which
purpose they were chiefly manu consiti, such as we have been treating of,
entire, and never violated with the Ax: Fabius calls them Sacros ex Vetustate
venerable for their Age; and certain it is, they had of very great Antiquity
been Consecrated to Holy uses, not only by Superstitious Persons to the
Gentile Deities and Heroes; but the true God, by the Patriarchs themselves, who
ab initio (as is presumed) did frequently retire to such places to serve him
in, Compose their Meditations, and celebrate Sacred Mysteries, Prayers, and
Oblations following the Tradition of the Gomerites or Descendants of Noah who
first Peopled Galata after the universal Deluge. From hence some presume that
even the ancient Druids had their origin: But that Abraham might imitate what
the most Religious of that Age had practiced before him may not be unlikely;
for we read he soon Planted himself and Family at the Quercetum of Mambre, Genesis
13. where as Eusebius, Ecc. Hist. l. 1. c. 18. gives us the account, He spread
his Pavilions, erected an Altar, Offered and performed all the Priestly Rites;
and there, to the immortal glory of the Oak, or rather Arboreous Temple, he
entertained God himself. Isidor, St. Hierom, and Sozomenus report confidently,
that one of the most eminent of those Trees remained till the Reign of the
great Constantine, who Founded a venerable Chapel under it; and that both the
Christians, Jews, and Arabs, held a solemn Anniversarie or Station there and
believed that from the very time of Noah it had been a Consecrated place: sure
we are it was about some such assembly of Trees, that God was pleased first of
all to appear to the Father of the Faithful when he established the Covenant
with him, and more expressly, when removing thence (upon confirming the League
with Abimelech, Genesis 21. and settling at Bersheba) he designed an express
place for Gods Divine Service: For there, says the sacred Text, He Planted a
Grove, and called upon the Name of the Lord. Such another tuft we read of (for
we must not always restrain it to one single Tree) when the Patriarch came to
(...) Elon Moreh, ad Convallem illustrium: But whether that were the same in
which the High Priest reposited the famous Stone after the Exhortation
mentioned Joshua 24.26. we do not contend; under an Oak says the Scripture,
and it grew near the Sanctuary, and probably might be that which his Grand
child Consecrated with the Funeral of his beloved Rebecca, Genesis 35. For it is
apparent by the Context, that There, God appeared to him again: So Grotius upon
the words (Subter quercum) Illam ipsam (says he) cujus mentio, Genesis 35.4. in
historia Jacobi and Judae; and adds, Is locus in honorem Jacobi diu pro Templo
fuit. That the very spot was long after used for a Temple in honor of him.

3. If we would track the Religious esteem of Trees and Woods, yet farther in
Holy Writ, we have that glorious Vision of Moses in the fiery Thicket, and it
is not to abuse or violate the Text, that Moncaeus and others, interpret it to
have been an entire Grove, and not a single Bush only, which he saw as
burning, yet unconsum'd. Puto ego (says my Author) rubi vocabulo non quidem
rubum aliquem unicum and solitarium significari, verum rubetum totum, aut
potius fruticetum, quomodo de Quercu Mambre pro Querceto toto Docti
intelligunt. Now that they Worshipped in that Place soon after their coming out
of Egypt, the following story shows; and the Feast of Tabernacles had some
resemblance of Patriarchal Devotion under Trees, though but in temporary Groves
and Shades in manner of Booths, yet Celebrated with all the refreshings of the
Forest; and from the very Infancy of the World in which Adam was entertained in
Paradise, and Abraham (as we noted) received his Divine Guests, not in his
Tent, but under a Tree, an Oak, Triclinium Angelicum the Ancients Dining Room;
all intelligent persons have embraced the solace of shady Arbours, and all
devout Persons found how naturally they dispose our Spirits to Religious
Contemplations: For this, as some conceive, they much affected to Plant their
Trees in Circles, and gave that capacious Form to the first Temples* observed
not only of old, but even at this day by the Jews, as the most accommodate for
their Assemblies; or, as others, because that figure most resembl'd the
Universe, and the Heavens: Templum a Templando says a knowing Critic, and
another, Templum est nescio quid immane, atque amplum; such as Arnobius speaks
of, that had no Roof but Heaven, till that sumptuous Fabric of Solomon was
confined to Jerusalem, and the goodliest Cedars, and most costly Woods were
carried thither to form the Columns, and lay the Rafters; and then, and not
till then, was it so much as Schism that I can find, to retire to Groves for
their Devotion, or even to Bethel it self.

4. In such Recesses were the ancient Oratories and Proseuchae built even
amongst the Gentiles, as well as the People of God (nor is it always the less
authentical for having been the guise of Nations) hence that of Philo, speaking
of one who (...), etc. that had felled all the Trees about it; and such a place
the Satyrist means, where he asks, In qua te quaero proseucha? because it was
the Rendezvous also, where poor People used to frequent to beg the Alms of
devout and Charitable Persons; and it was esteemed piacular for any to cut down
so much as a stick about them, unless it were to build them, when with the
Psalmist, men had honor according to their forwardness of repairing the
Houses of God in the Land, upon which account it was lawful to lift up Axes
against the goodliest Trees in the Forest; but those zealous days are past,
Now Temples shut, and Groves desertedly,
All Gold adore, and neglect Piety.
Et nunc desertis cessant sacraria Lucis
Aurum omnes victa, jam Pietate colunt.
Propert.

5. They came afterward indeed to be abused to Superstition, but what good, or
indifferent thing has not been subject to perversion? It is said in the end of
Isaiah, Exprobratur Hebraeis quod in Opisthonais Idolorum horti essent in
quorum medio februabantur; but how this is applicable to Groves does not appear
so fully; though we find them interdicted, Deuteronomy. 16.21. Judge. 6.26. 2 Chronicles:
31.3. etc. and forbidden to be Planted near the Temple; and an impure Grove on
Mount Libanus dedicated to Venus, was by an Imperial Edict of Constantine
extirpated; but from the abuse of the thing to the non-use, the Consequence is
not always valid, and we may note as to this very particular, that where in
diverse places of Holy Writ, the denuntiation against Groves is so express, it
is frequently to be taken but catachrestically, from the Wooden Image or Statue
called by that name, as our Learned Seldom makes out by sundry Instances in his
Syntagma de Diis Syris.

The Sum of all is, Paradise it self was but a kind of Nemorous Temple or
sacred Grove, Planted by God himself, and given to Man, tanquam primo
sacerdoti, the Word is (...) which properly signifies to Serve or administer
res divinas, a place Consecrated for sober Discipline, and to Contemplate those
mysterious and Sacramental Trees which they were not to touch with their hands;
and in memory of them, I am inclined to believe, Holy Men (as we have showed in
Abraham and others) might Plant and cultivate Groves, where they traditionally
invoked the Deity; and St. Hierom, Chrysostom, Cyprian, Augustine, and other
Fathers of the Church greatly magnified these pious advantages; and Cajetan
tells us, that from Isaac to Jacob and their Descendants they followed Abraham
in this Custom: In such places were the Monuments of their Saints, and the
Bones of their Heroes deposited; for which David celebrated the Humanity of the
Galaadites, In Nemora Jabes as the most sacred and inviolable: In such a place
did the Angel appear to Gideon, and in others Princes were Inaugurated; so
Abimelec, Judic. 9. And the Rabbines add a reason why they were reputed so
Venerable; because more remote from Men and Company, more apt to compose the
Soul and fit it for divine Actions, and sometimes Apparitions, for which the
first enclosures were attributed to Groves, Mountains, Fountains of Water, and
the like solemn objects; as of peculiar Sanctity, and as the old sense of all
words denoting Sanctity did import separatenesse and uncommon propriety: See
our Learned Meade. For though since the Devils intrusion into Paradise, even
the most holy and devoted Places were not free from his Tentations and ougly
Stratagems: Yet we find our Blessed Savior did frequently retire into the
Wilderness, as Elijah and St. John did before him, and diverse other Holy men:
The reason is obvious, and I shall show when I come to speak concerning the use
of Gardens in another Work (long since attempted, and now in some forwardness)
how the Air of such retired places may be assistant and influential for the
inciting of Penitential expressions and affections; especially where one may
have the additional assistances of solitary Grotts, murmuring Streams, and
desolate Prospects: I remember that under a Tree was the place of that
admirable St. Augustines solemn Conversion, after all his importunate
reluctances: I have often thought of it, and it is a mealting passage as
himself has recorded it, Con. l. 8. c. 8. and he gives the reason, Solitudo
enim mihi ad negotium flendi aptior suggerebatur. And that indeed such
opportunities were successful for Recollection, and to the very reformation of
some ingenious Spirits from secular Engagements to excellent and mortifying
Purposes, we may find in that wonderful relation of Pontianus's two Friends,
great Courtiers of the time, as the same Holy Father relates it, previous to
his own Conversion.

6. We shall now in the next place endeavor to show how this innocent
veneration to Groves passed from the People of God to the Gentiles, and by what
degrees it degenerated into dangerous Superstitions: For the Devil was always
Gods Ape, and did so ply his Groves, Altars, and Sacrifices, and almost all
other Rites belonging to his Worship, that every Green Tree was full of his
Abominations, and places devoted to his impure Service, Hi fuere (says Pliny,
speaking of Groves) quondam Numinum templa, etc. These, were of old the Temples
of the Gods, and after that simple (but ancient Custom) men at this day
Consecrate the fairest and goodliest Trees to some Deity or other; nor do we
more adore our glittering Shrines of Gold and Ivory, than the Groves, in which
with a profound and awful silence, we worship them. For in truth the very Tree
it self was sometimes Deified, and that Celtic Statue of Jupiter no better than
a prodigious tall Oak, whence it is said the Chaldean Theologues derived their
superstition toward it; and the Persians we read, used that Tree in all their
mysterious Rites; so as to some they proceeded to the offering even of humane
Sacrifices, Each Tree besprinckled was with humane gore.
Omnis and humanis lustrata cruoribus arbos.
Lucan l. 3.

Procopius tells us plainly that the Sclavii worshipped Trees and whole Forests
of them: See Jo. Dubravius l. 1. Hist. Bohem. and that formerly the Gandenses
did the like, Surius the Legendary 6. Feb. reports in the life of S. Amadus: So
did the Vandals says Albert Crantz; and even those of Peru, as I learn from
Acosta l. 5. c. 11. But one of the first Idols which procured particular
veneration in them was the Sidonian Ashtaroth who took her name a Lucis, as the
Jupiter (...) amongst the Rhodians, the Nemorensis Diana or Arduenna, and
others who had peculiar Worship in the Groves; so soon had Men degenerated into
this irrational and stupid Devotion, that Arch- Fanatic Satan (who began his
pranks in a Tree) debauching the Contemplative use of Groves and other
Solitudes. Nor were the Heathens alone in this crime, the Basilidians and other
Haeretics even amongst the Christians, did consecrate to the Woods and the
Trees their Serpent-footed and barbarous (...), as it is yet to be seen in some
of their mysterious Talismans and Periapta's which they carried about.

In opere Pas^bali.
But the Roman madness (like that which the Prophet derides in the Jews) was
well perstring'd by Sedulius and others for imploring these Stocks to be
propitious to them, as we learn in Cato de R.R. c. 113.134. etc. And it was not
long after, when they were generally Consecrated by Faunus, that they boldly
set up his Oracles and Responses in these nemorous places: Hence the Heathen
Chapels had the name of Fana, and from their wild and extravagant Religion,
the Professors of it Phanatics; a name well becoming some of our late
Enthusiasts amongst us; who, when their Quaking fits possess them, resemble
the giddy motion of Trees, whose heads are agitated with every wind of Doctrine.

7. Here we may not omit what Learned men have observed concerning the Custom
of Prophets and Persons inspired of old, to sleep upon the Boughs and branches
of Trees (I do not mean on the tops of them, as the Salvages somewhere do in
the Indies for fear of Wild Beasts in the night time) but on Matrasses and Beds
made of their Leaves, ad Consulendum to ask advise of God. Naturalists tell us,
that the Laurus and Agnus Castus were Trees which greatly composed the Phansy,
and did facilitate true Visions; and that the first was specifically
efficacious (...) (as my Author expresses it) to Inspire a Poetical fury: Such
a Tradition there goes of Rebecca the Wife of Isaac, See S. Hier. in Trad.
Heb. 3 Reg. c. 4.
in imitation of her Father in Law: The Instance is recited out of an ancient
Ecclesiastical History by Abulensis; and (what I drive at) that from hence the
Delphic Tripos, the Dodonaean Oracle in Epirus, and others of that nature had
their Originals: At this decubation upon Boughs the Satyrist seems to hint
where he introduces the Gypsies.

-- with fear
The poor she Jew begs in my Ladies ear,
The Groves high Priestesse, Heavens true messenger,
Hierusalem's old Laws expounds to her.
Stapylton. Arcanam Judaea tremens mendicat in aurem
Interpres Legum Solymarum, and magn Sacerdos
Arboris, ac summi fida internuncia Coeli.
Juv. Sat. 6. For indeed the Delphic Oracle (as Diodorus l. 16. tells us) was
first made e Lauri ramis of the Branches of Laurel transferred from Thessaly,
bended, and arched over in form of a Bower or Summer House, a very simple
Fabric you may be sure: And Cardan I remember in his Book de Fato, insists very
much on the Dreams of Trees for portents and presages, and that the use of some
of them do dispose men to Visions.

8. Vide Annium viterb. l. 17. fol. 158.
From hence then began Temples to be erected and sought to in such Places, and
as there was hardly a Grove without its Temple, so had every Temple almost, a
Grove belonging to it, where they placed Idols, and Altars and Lights endowed
with fair Revenues which the devotion of Superstitious persons continually
augmented; and I remember to have seen something very like this in Italy, and
other Parts, namely, where the Images of the B. Virgin and other Saints have
been enshrined in hollow and umbragious Trees frequented with much veneration,
which puts me in mind of what that great Traveller Pietro della Valla relates,
where he speaks of an extraordinary Cypress, yet extant, near the Tomb of
Cyrus, to which at this day many Pilgrimages are made, and speaks of a Gummy
transudation which it yields, that the Turks affirm to turn every Friday into
drops of Blood: The Tree is hollow within, adorned with many Lamps, and fitted
for an Oratory, and indeed some would derive the name Lucus a Grove, as more
particularly to signify such enormous and cavernous Trees quod ibi lumina
accenderentur Religionis causa: But our Author adds, The Ethnics do still
repute all great Trees to be divine, and the habitation of Souls departed:
These the Persians call Pir and Imam. Perhaps such a hollow Tree was that
Asylum of our Poets Hero, when he fled from his burning Troy, -- an ancient
Cypress near
Kept by Religious Parents many a year.
-- ju^^aque antiqua Cupressus
Religione Patrum multos servata per annos.
Aen. 2. For that they were places of Protection, and priviledg'd like
Churches, and Altars, appears out of Livy and other good Authority: Thus where
they introduce Romulus encouraging his new Colony, So soon as ere the Grove he
had immured
Have hither (says he) here you are secured.
-- ut saxo Lucum circumdedit alto
Quilibet, huc, dicit, Confuge, tutus eris.
Such a Sanctuary was the Aricina, and Suburban Diana, called the Nemorale
Templum, and diverse more which we shall reckon up anon.

9. The Mysteries which the famous Druids celebrated in their Woods and
Forests, are at large to be found in Caesar, Pliny, Strabo, Diodorus, Mela,
Apuleius, Ammianus, Lucan, Aventinus, and innumerable other Writers, where you
will see that they chose the Woods and the Groves, not only for all their
Religious Exercises, but their Courts of Justice; as the whole Institution and
Discipline is recorded by Caesar, l. 6. and as he it seems found it in our
Country of Britain, from whence it was afterward translated into Gallia: For
he attributes the first rise of it to this once happy Island of Groves, and
Oaks; and affirms that the ancient Gauls traveled hither for their initiation.
To this Tacitus assents, 14 Annal. and our most Learned Critics who vindicate
it both from the Greeks and French, who frequently challenge it: But the very
Name it self, which is purely Celtic, does best decide the Controversy: For
though (...) be Quercus; yet Vossius skilfully proves that the Druids were
altogether strangers to the Greeks; but what comes yet nearer to us, Dru, fides
(as one observes) begetting our now antiquated Trou, or True, makes our title
the stronger: Add to this, that amongst the Germans it signified no less than
God it self; and we find Drutin or Trudin to import Divine or Faithful in the
Othfridian Gospel, both of them Sacerdotal expressions. But that in this Island
of ours men should be so extremely devoted to Trees, and especially to the Oak,
the strength and defense of all our enjoyments, environed as we are by the
Seas, and Martial Neighbors, is less to be wondered, Our British Druids not
with vain intent,
Or without Providence did the Oak frequent;
That Albion did that Tree so much advance
Nor Superstition was, nor ignorance
Those Priests divining even then, bespoke
The mighty Triumphs of the Royal Oak.
When the Seas Empire with like boundless fame
Victorious CHARLES the Son of CHARLES shall claim,
Non igitur Dryadae nostrates pectore vano
Nec sine consulto coluerunt Numine Quercum,
Non illam Albionis jam tum celebravit honor
Stulta Superstitio, venturive inscia secli
Angliaci ingentes puto praevidisse triumphos
Roboris, Imperiumque maris quod maximus olim,
CAROLIDES vasta Victor ditione teneret.
Couleii L. 6. Pl. as we may find the Praediction gloriously followed by our
ingenious Poet, where his Dryad consignes that Sacred Depositum to this Monarch
of the Forest the Oak, than which nothing can be more sublime and rapturous.

10. From those Sylvan Philosophers and Divines (not to speak much of the
Indian Brachmans descended of the ancient Gymnosophists) it is believed that the
great Pythagoras might Institute his silent Monastery; and we read that Plato
entertained his Auditors amongst his Walks of Trees, which were afterward
defaced by the inhumanity of Sylla, when as Appian tells us, he cut down those
venerable shades to build Forts against Pyraeus: And another we find he had,
Planted near Anicerides with his own hands, wherein grew that celebrated
Platanus under which he introduces his Master Socrates discoursing with Phaedon
de Pulchro: Such another place was the Athenian Cephisia as Agellius describes
it: Democritus also taught in a Grove, as we find in that of Hippocrates to
Damagetus, where there is a particular Tree designed ad Otium literarum; ad
Mart.
and I remember Tertullian calls these places Studia opaca: I could here tell
you of Palaemon, Timon, Apollonius, Theophrastus, and many more that erected
their Schools in such Colleges of Trees, but I spare my Reader; I shall only
note that it is reported of Thucydides that he compiled his noble History in the
Scaplan Groves* as Pliny writes; and in that matchless piece de Oratore, we
shall find the Interlocutors to be often under the Platanus in his Tusculan
Villa, where invited by the freshness and sweetness of the place Admonuit
(says one of them) me haec tua Platanus quae non minus ad opacandum hunc locum
patulis and diffusa ramis quam illa, cujus umbram secutus est Socrates, quae
mihi videtur non tam ipsa aquula, quae describitur, quam Platonis oratione
crevisse, etc. as the Orator brings it in, in the person of one of that meeting.

I confess Quintilian seems much to question whether such places do not rather
perturb and distract from an Orators Recollection, l. 10.
and the depths of Contemplation: Non tamen (says he) protinus audiendi, qui
credunt aptissima in hoc Nemora, sylvasque, quod illa coeli libertas,
locorumque amaenitas, sublimem animum, and beatiorem spiritum parent: Mihi
certe jucundus hic magis; quam studiorum hortator videtur esse secessus: Namque
illa ipsa quae delectant, necesse est avocent ab intention operis destinati:
He proceeds -- Quare Sylvarum amoenitas, and praeter labentia flumina, and
inspirantes ramis arborum aurae, volucrumque cantus and ipsa late
circumspiciendi libertas, ad se trahunt; ut mihi remittere potius vo^uptas ista
videatur cogitationem quam intendere. But this is only his singular suffrage,
which as conscious of his Error, we soon hear him retract, when he is by and by
as loud in its Praises, as the Places in the World, the best fitted for the
diviner Rhetorique of Poetry: But let us admit another to cast in his Symbol
for Groves: Nemora (says he) and Luci, and secretum ipsum, tantam mihi
afferunt voluptatem ut inter precipuos Carminum fructus, majorem, quod nec in
strepitu, nec sedente ante hostium litigatore, nec inter Sordes and lacrymas
reorum comprimantur: Sed secedit animus in loca pura, atque innocentia,
fruturque sedibus Sacris.

And indeed the Poets thought of no other Heaven upon Earth, or elsewhere; for
when Anchises was setting forth the felicity of the other life to his Son, the
most lively description he could make of it was to tell him, -- We dwell in
shady Groves,
-- Lucis habitamus opacit
and that when Aeneas had traveled far to find those happy Abodes, They came
to Groves, of happy Souls the Rest
To Ever-greens, the dwellings of the Blessed.
Devenere locos latos, and amoena vireta
Fortunatorum Nemorum, Sedesque beatas.
Such a prospect he gives us of his Elysium; and therefore wise and great
Persons had always these sweet opportunities of Recesse, their Domos Sylvae,
as we reed, 2 Reg. 7.2. which were thence called Houses of Royal Refreshment,
or as the Septuagint (...), not much unlike the Lodges in diverse of our
Noble-mens Parks, and Forest-Walks; which minds me of his choice in another
Poem, In lofty Towers let Pallas take her rest,
Whilst shady Groves above all things please us best.
-- Pallas quas condidit arces,
Ipsa colat, nobis placeant ante omnia Sylvae.
Eclog. 2. And for the same reason Mecoenas -- Chose the broad Oak --
Maluit umbrosam Quercum --
and as Horace bespeaks them, Me the cool Woods above the rest advance
Where the rough Satyrs with the light Nymphs dance.
-- Me gelidum nemus
Nympharumque leves cum Satyris Chori,
Secernunt populo --
and Virgil again, Our sweet Thalia loves, nor does she scorn
To haunt umbragious Groves --
Nostra nec ^rubuit Sylvas habitare Thalia.
or as thus expressed by Petrarch, -- The Muse her self injoys
Best in the Woods, verse flies the City noise.
Sylva placet Musis, urbs est inimica Poetis. So true is that of yet a better
Poet of our own; As well might Corn, as Verse in Cities grow,
In vain the thanklesse Glebe we Plow and Sow,
Against the unnatural Soil in vain we strive,
It Is not a ground in which these Plants will thrive.
Conley. When it seems they will bear nothing but Nettles, and Thorns of
Satyrs, and as Juvenal says, by Indignation too; and therefore almost all the
Poets, except those who were not able to eat Bread without the Bounty of Great
men; that is, without what they could get by flattering them (which was Homer's
and Pindar's case) have not only withdrawn themselves from the Vices and
Vanities of the great World, into the innocent felicities of Gardens, and
Groves, and Retiredness, but have also commended and adorned nothing so much
in their never-dying Poems. Here then is the true Parnassus, Castalia, and the
Muses, and at every call in a Grove of Venerable Oaks, methinks I hear the
answer of an hundred old Druyds, and the Bards of our inspired Ancestors.

Innumerable are the Testimonies I might produce in behalf of Groves and Woods
out of the Poets, Virgil, Gratius, Ovid, Horace, Claudian, Statius, Silius, and
others of latter times, especially the divine Petrarch; were I minded to swell
this Charming Subject, beyond the limits of a Chapter: I think only to take
notice, that Theatrical Representations, such as were those of the Ionian
called Andria; the Scenes of Pastorals, and the like innocent Rural
Entertainments were of old adorned and trimmed up e ramis and frondibus, cum
racemis and corymbis, and frequently represented in Groves, as the Learned
Scaliger shows: Poetices l. 1.^. 21.
And here the most beloved of Apollo rooted his coy Mistress, and the noblest
Raptures have been conceived in the Walks and shades of Trees, and Poets have
composed Verses which have animated men to Heroic and glorious Actions; here
Orators (as we showed) have made their Panegyrics, Historians grave Relations,
and the Profound Philosophers loved here to pass their lives in repose and
Contemplation, and the frugal Repasts -- mollesque sub arbore somni were the
natural and chaste delights of our Forefathers.

12. Nor were Groves thus only frequented by the great Scholars, and the great
Wits, but by the greatest Statesmen and Politians also; and the Athenians were
wont to Consult of their gravest matters and Public Concernments in them.
Famous for these Assemblies were the Ceraunian, and at Rome the Lucus
Petilinus, the Farentinus, and others, in which there was held that renowned
Parliament after the Defeat of the Gauls by M. Popilio: For 'twas supposed
that in places so Sacred, they would Faithfully and Religiously observe what
was Concluded amongst them.

In such green Palaces the first Kings reigned,
Slept in their Shades, and Angels entertained:
With such old Counselors they did advise,
And by frequenting Sacred Groves, grew Wise;
Free from the impediments of Light and Noise,
Man thus retired, his nobler thoughts imploys.
Mr. Wallet. As our excellent Poet has described it: and amongst other weighty
matters they treated of Matches for their Children, and the Young people made
Love in the cooler Shades, and ingrav'd their Mistris's Names upon the Bark, L.
16. c. 44. Arist. l. Ep. 10.
tituli aereis literis insculpti as Pliny speaks of that Ancient Vatican Ilex,
and Euripides in Hippolyto, where he shows us how they made the incision,
whisper their soft Complaints like that of Aristaenetus (...), etc. and wish
that it had but a Soul and a Voice to tell Cydippe, the fair Cydippe, how she
was beloved: Vide Symmach. l. 4. Ep. 28.
And doubtless this Character was Antienter than that in Paper; let us hear
the Amorous Poet leaving his young Couple thus Courting each other. My name on
Bark engraven by your fair hand,
Oenone, there, cut by your knife does stand;
And with the Stock my Name alike does grow,
Be It so, and my advancing honor show.
Incisae servant a te mea nomina fagi
Et Legor Oenone falce notata tua,
Et quantum trunci, tantum mea nomina crescunt,
Crescite, and in titulos surgite rite meos.
Ovid. Ep. which doubtless he learnt of Maro describing the unfortunate
Gallus. There on the tender bark to carve my Love;
And as they grow, so shall my hopes improve.
Ogilby. -- tenerisque meos incidere amores

Eclog. 10. and these pretty Monuments of Courtship I find were much used on
the Cherry-tree (the Wild one I suppose) which has a very smooth Rind, as the
witty Calfurnius, Repeat, thy words on Cherry-bark I Will take,
And that red skin my Table Book will make.
Dic age, nam Cerasi tua cortice verba notab^
Et decisa feram rutilanti carmina libro.


I omit Olympius Nemesianus, and others, for we have dwelt too long on this
trifle, but we will now change the Scene as the Egyptians did the mirth of
their Guests when they served in a Scull to make them more serious. For,

13. Amongst other Uses of Groves, I read that some Nations were wont to hang,
not Malefactors only, but their departed Friends, and those whom they most
esteemed upon Trees, as so much nearer to Heaven, and dedicated to God;
believing it far more honorable than to be buried in the Earth; and that some
affected to repose rather in these Woody places Propertius seems to bespeak.

The Gods forbid my Bones in the high-Road
Should lie* by every wandering vulgar trod;
Thus buried Lovers are to scorn exposed,
My Tomb in some by Arbor be enclosed.
Di faciant mea ne terra locet ossa frequenti
Qua facit assiduo tramite vulgus iter,
Post mortem tumuli sic infamantur amantum,
Me tegat arborea devia terra coma.
The same is affirmed of other Septentrional People by Chr. Cilicus de Bello
Dithmarsico l. 1. We have already mentioned Rebeccah, and read of Kings
themselves that honored such places with their Sepulchers: What else should be
the meaning of 1 Chro. 10.12. when the valiant men of Jabesh interred the Bones
of Saul and Jonathan under the Oak. Famous was the Hyrnethian Caemeterie where
Daiphon lay; Ariadnes Tomb was in the Amathusian Grove in Crete, now Candie:
For they believed that the Spirits and Ghosts of Men delighted to expatiate and
appear in such solemn places, as the Learned Grotius notes from Theophylact,
speaking of the Demons, upon Mat. 8 20. for which cause Plato gave permission,
that Trees might be Planted over Graves, to obumbrate and refresh them.

Our Blessed Savior chose the Garden sometimes for his Oratory, and dying, for
the place of his Sepulcher; and we do avouch for many weighty causes, that
there are none more fit to bury our Dead in, than in our Gardens and Groves,
where our Beds may be decked with verdant and fragrant Flowers, Trees and
Perennial Plants, the most natural and instructive Hieroglyphics of our
expected Resurrection and Immortality, besides what they might conduce to the
Meditation of the living, and the taking off our Cogitations from dwelling too
intently upon more vain and sensual Objects; that Custom of Burying in
Churches, and near about them (especially in great and populous Cities) being
both a Novel Presumption, undecent, and very unhealthful.

14. To make this Discourse the more absolute, we shall add a short recital of
the most famous Groves which we find Celebrated in Histories; and those,
besides many already mentioned, were such as being Consecrated both to Gods and
Men, bore their Names: Amongst these are reckoned the Sacred to Minerva, Isis,
Latona, Cybele, Osiris, Aesculapius, Diana, and especially the Aricinian, in
which there was a goodly Temple erected, placed in the midst of an Island, with
a vast Lake about it, a Mount, and a Grotto adorned with Statues, and irrigated
with plentiful Streams: and this was that renouned Recesse of Numa, where he so
frequently conversed with his Aegeria, as did Minos in the Cave of Jupiter, and
by whose pretended Inspirations they gained the deceived People, and made them
receive what Laws he pleased to impose upon them. To these we may join, the
Groves of Vulcan, Venus, and the little Cupid: Mars, Bellona, Bacchus,
Sylvanus, the Muses, and that near Helicon from the same Numa, their great
Patron; and hence had they their Name Camoenae. In this was the noble Statue of
Eupheme Nurse to those Poetical Ladies; but so the Feranian and even Mons
Parnassus, were thick shaded with Trees. Nor may we omit the more impure
Lupercal Groves Sacred, or Profaned rather, yet most famous for their
affording shelter and foster to Romulus, and his Brother Rhemus.

That of Vulcan was usually guarded by Dogs, like the Town of S. Malos in
Bretaigne: The Pinea Sylva appertained to the Mother of the Gods, as we find in
Virgil. Venus had several Groves in Egypt, and in the Gnidian Island, where
once stood those famous Statues cut by Praxiteles; another in Pontus, where (if
you will believe it) hung up the Golden Fleece for the bold Adventurer. Nor was
the Watry-King Neptune without his Groves, the Helicean in Greece was his: So
Ceres, and Proserpine, Pluto, Vesta, Castor and Pollux had such shady Places
Consecrated to them; add to these the Lebadian, Arfinoan, Paphian, Senonian,
and such as were in general dedicated to all the Gods.

-- The Gods have dwelt in Groves.
-- Habitarunt dii quoque Sylva^.
And these were as it were Pantheons. To the memory of famous Men and Heroes
were Consecrated the Achillean, Aglauran, and those to Bellerophon, Hector,
Alexander, and to others who disdained not to derive their Names from Trees and
Forests; as Sylvius the Posthumus of Aeneas; diverse of the Albanian Princes,
and great Persons; Stolon, Laura, Daphnis, etc. And a certain Custom there was
for the Parents to Plant a Tree at the Birth of an Heir or Son, presaging by
the growth and thriving of the Tree the prosperity of the Child: Thus we read
in the life of Virgil, and how far his Natalitial Poplar had out-strip'd the
rest of its Contemporaries. And the reason doubtless of all this was, the
general repute of the Sanctity of those Places; for no sooner does the Poet
speak of a Grove, but immediately some Consecration follows, as believing that
out of those shady Profundities some Deity must needs emerge, Quo possis viso
dicere Numen inest. so as Tacitus (speaking of the Germans) says, Lucos and
Nemora consecrant, Deorumque nominibus appellant secretum illud, quod sola
reverentia vident; and the Consecration of these Nemorous places we find in
Quintus Curtius, and in what Paulus Diaconus de Lege relates of the Longobards
where the Rites are express, allured as it is likely by the gloominesse of the
Shade, procerity and altitude of the Stem, floridnesse of the leaves and other
accidents, not capable of Philosophising on the Physical Causes, which they
deemed supernatural, and plainly divine; so as to use the words of Prudentius,
Here all Religion paid; whose dark Recesse
A sacred awe does on their mind impresse,
To their Wild Gods --
Quos penes omne sacrum est, quicquid formid^ trem^udu^^
Suaserit horrificos, quos prodigialia cogun^
Monstra Deos --
L. 2. Cout. Sym. And this deification of their Trees, and amongst other
things, for their Age and perennial viridity, says Diodorus, might spring from
the manifold use which they afforded, and happly had been taught them by the
Gods, or rather by some God-like persons, whom for their worth and the public
benefit they esteemed so; and that diverse of them were voyc'd to have been
Metamorphoz'd from Men into Trees, and again out of Trees into Men, as the
Arcadians gloried in their Birth, when Out of the teeming Bark of Oaks men
burst.
Geusque virum, truncis, and rupto robore nati,
which perhaps they fancied, by seeing men creep sometimes out of their
Cavities, in which they often lodged and secured themselves; For in the Earths
nonage under Heavens new frame,
They stricter lived, who from Oaks rupture came.
Stapylton. Quippe aliter tunc orb novo coeloque recenti
Vivebant homines qui rupto robore nati, etc.
Juven. l. 2. S. 6. Or as the sweet Papinius, Fame goes that thou brake forth
from the hard rind,
When the new earth with the first feet was signed?
Fields yet nor Houses doleful pangs relieved
But shady Ash the numerous births received,
And the green Babe dropped from the pregnant Elm,
Whom strange amazement first did over-whelm
At break of day, and when the gloomy night
Ravished the Sun from their pursuing sight,
Gave it for lost --
-- Nemorum vos stirpe rigen^i
-- Fama satos, cum prima pedum vestigia tellus
Admirata tulit, nondum arva, domusque ferebant
Cruda puerperia, ac populos umbrosa creavit,
Fraxinus, and foeta viridis puer excidit Orno:
Hi Lucis stupuisse vices, noctisque feruntur,
Nubila, and occiduum Long Titana secuti
Desperasse diem --
almost like that which Rinaldo saw in the Enchanted Forest. An aged Oak beside
him cleft and rent,
And from his fertile hollow womb forth went
(Clad in rare weeds, and strange habilement)
A full grown Nymph. --
Quercia gli appar, che per se ste^^^ incis^
Apre feconda il cavo ventre, e figlia:
En' esce fuor vestita in strania guisa
Ninfa d' eta cresciuta. --
Canto 18. And that every great Tree included a certain tutelar Genius or Nymph
living and dying with it, the Poets are full; a special instance we have in
that prodigious Oak which fell by the fatal stroke of Erisichthon; but the
Hamadryads it seems were immortal, and had power to remove, and change their
wooden habitations.

15. We might here produce wonderful strange Apparitions of this nature,
interceding for the standing, and life of Trees, when the Ax has been ready for
Execution, In Phoe. and Arcad.
as you may see in that Hymn of Callimachus, Pausanias, and the famous story of
Paraebius related by Apollonius in 2. Argonaut. with the fearful Catastrophe of
such as causelessly and wantonly violated those goodly Plantations (from which
fables arose, that of the Dodonean and vocal Forests, frequent in Heathen
Writers) but by none so Elegantly as the witty Ovid, describing the Fact of the
wicked Erisichthon.

-- Who Gods despised,
Nor ever on their Altars sacrificed,
-- Qui numina divum
Sperneret, and nullos aris adoleret honores etc.
Who Ceres Groves with steel profaned: Where stood
An old huge Oak; even of it self a Wood.
Wreaths, Ribands, grateful Tables decked his boughs
And sacred Stem; the Dues of powerful Vows.
Full often the Dryades, with Chaplets crowned,
Danced in the shade; full often they tript a Round
About his bole. Five Cubits three times told
His ample Circuit hardly could infold.
Whose stature other Trees as far exceeds,
As other Trees surmount the humble Weeds.
Yet this his Fury rather did provoke:
Who bids his Servants fell the Sacred Oak.
And snatches, while they paused, an Ax from one,
Thus storming: Not the Goddess loved alone;
But, though this were the Goddess, she should down,
And sweep the Earth with her aspiring Crown.
As he advanced his Arms to strike, the Oak
Both sighed and trembled at the threatening stroke.
His Leaves and Acorns, pale together grew,
And colour-changing-branches sweat cold deaw:
Then wounded by his impious hand, the Blood
Gushed from the incision in a purple flood:
Much like a mighty Ox, that falls before
The Sacred Altar, sprouting streams of gore.
On All amazement seized: When One of all
The Crime deters, nor would his Ax let fall.
Contracting his stern brows; Receive, said he,
Thy Pieties Reward; and from the Tree
The stroke converting, lops his Head; then struck
The Oak again; from whence a Voice thus spoke:
A Nymph am I, within this Tree inshrin'd,
Beloved of Ceres, O profane of mind,
Vengeance is near thee: With my parting breath,
I Prophecy, a Comfort to my Death.
He still his guilt pursues; who over-throws
With Cables, and innumerable blows
The sturdy Oak; which nodding, long, down rushed,
And in his lofty fall his fellows crushed.
Sandys. But a sad Revenge follows it, as the Poet will tell you; and one might
fill a just Volume with the Histories of Groves that were violated by wicked
Men, who came to fatal periods.

It is reported that the Minturensian Grove was esteemed so venerable, that a
stranger might not be admitted into it; and the great Xerxes himself when he
passed through Achaia, would not touch a Grove which was dedicated to Jupiter,
Commanding his Army to do it no Violence, and the honors he did to one single
(but a goodly) Platanus we have already mentioned. The like to this we find
when the Persians were put to flight by Pausanias; though they might have saved
their lives by it, as appears in the Story. The same reverence made that
Hercules would not so much as taste the Waters of the Aegerian Groves after he
slew Cacus, though extremely thirsty.

-- The Priestesse se'd
(A purple Fillet binding her gray head)
Stranger, pry not, but quit this shady Seat,
Avaunt, and whiles thou safely may, Retreat,
To men forbid, and by hard Sanction bound*
Far better other Springs were by you found.
Punicco canas stamine vincta comas,
Parce oculis hospes, Lucoque abscede verend^
Cede agedum, and tuta limina linque fuga,
Interdicta viris, metuenda lege piatur
Di tibi dent alios fontes --
Propert. l. 4. Nor indeed in such places was it lawful to Hunt, unless it
were to kill for Sacrifice, as we read in Arrianus; whence it is reported by
Strabo, that in the Aetolian Groves Sacred to Diana, the Beasts were so tame,
that the very Wolves and Staggs fed together like Lambs, and would follow a man
licking his hands, and fauning on him. Such a Grove was the Crotonian, in which
Livy writes, there was a spacious Field stored with all sorts of Game. There
were many Forests consecrated to Jupiter, Juno, and Apollo; especially the
famous Epidaphnes near the Syrian Antioch, which was most incomparably
pleasant, adorned with Fountains and rare Statues. There was to be seen the
Laurel which had been his chaste Mistress, and in the Center of it his Temple
and Asylum: Here it was Cosroes and Julian did Sacrifice upon several
occasions as Eusebius relates, but could not with all their impious Arts
obtain an Answer; because the holy Babylas had been interred near that Oracle,
for which it was reputed so venerable, that there remained an express Title
in the Code de Cupressis ex Luco Daphnes non excidendis, vel venundandis, that
none should either fell, or sell any of the Trees about it, which may serve for
another Instance of their Burying in such places. The truth is, so exceedingly
Superstitious they were and tender, that there was almost no meddling with these
devoted Trees, and even before they did but conlucare and prune one of them,
they were first to Sacrifice, least they might offend in something ignorantly:
But to Cut down was Capital, and never to be done away with any Offering
whatsoever; and therefore Conlucare in Authors is not (as some pretend)
Succidere, but to prune the Branches only, and yet even this gentle tonsure of
superfluities was reputed a kind of Contamination; and hence Lucus coinquinari
dicitur, unless in the case of Lightning when Caelo tacti, a whole Tree might
quite be felled, Salmut. exer* Plin. Sol^^.
as marked by Heaven for the Fire. But of this sufficient: We could indeed fill
many sheets with the Catastrophe of such as maliciously destroyed Groves to
feed either their revenge or avarice: See Plutarch in Pericles, and the saying
of Pompeius: Cicero sharply reproves G. Gabinius for his prodigious spoil in
Greece, and it was of late days held a piece of Inhumanity in Charles the
French King, when he entered the Frisons after he had slain their Leader, to cut
down their Woods, a punishment never inflicted by sober Princes but to prevent
Idolatry in the Old Law; and to show the heinousness of disloyalty and Treason
by latter Sanctions, in which case, and for Terror, even a Traitors Woods have
become Anathema, as were easy to instance out of Histories.

16. But what shall we say then of our late prodigious Spoilers, whose furious
devastation of so many goodly Woods and Forests, have bequeathed an Infamy on
their Names and Memories not quickly to be forgotten! I mean our unhappy
Usurpers, and injurious Sequestrators; not here to mention the deplorable
necessities of a Gallant and Loyal Gentry, who for their Compositions were
(many of them) compelled to add yet to this Wast, by an inhumane and
unparalled Tyranny over them, to preserve the poor remainder of their
Fortunes, and to find them Bread.

Nor was it here they desisted, when, after the Fate of that once beautiful
Grove under Greenwich-Castle, the Royal Walk of Elms in St. James's Park.

That living Galery of aged Trees, was once proposed to the late Council of
State (as they called it) to be cut down and sold, that with the rest of his
Majesty's Houses already demolished, and marked out for Destruction, his Trees
might likewise undergo the same destiny, and no footsteps of Monarchy remain
unviolated.

17. It is from hence you may calculate what were the designs of those
excellent Reformers, and the care these great Statesmen took for the
preservation of their Country, when being Parties in the Booty themselves, they
gave way to so dishonorable and impolitic a Wast of that Material, which being
left entire, or husbanded with discretion, had proved the best support and
defense of it. But this (say they) was the Effect of War, and in the height of
our Contentions. No, it was a late and cold deliberation, and long after all
had been subdued to them; nor could the most implacable of Enemies have
expressed a Resolution more barbarous.

We have spoken of the great Xerxes, that passing Conqueror through Achaia, he
would not suffer his Army to violate so much as a Tree of his Adversaries; and
have sufficiently observed from the Ancients, that the Gods did never permit
them to escape unpunished who were injurious to Groves. What became of
Agamemnon's Host after his Spoil of the Woods at Aulis? Histories tell us
Cleomenes died mad: The Temesaean Genius became proverbial; and the destructive
fact that the enraged Caesar perpetrated on the Massilian Trees, went not long
unrevenged, thus related by the Poet, and an illustrious Record of all we have
hitherto produced, to assert their Veneration.

Lucus erat longo nunquam violatus ab aevo, etc.

Lucan. l. 3. A Wood untouched of old was growing there
Of thick-set Trees, whose boughs spreading and fair
Meeting, obscured the enclosed Air,
And made dark shades exiling Phoebus Rays:
There no rude Fawn, nor wanton Sylvan plays;
No Nymph disports, but cruel Deities
Claim barbarous Rites, and bloody Sacrifice:
Each Tree defiled with humane blood; if we
Believe Traditions of Antiquity:
No Bird dares light upon those hollowed boughs,
No Beasts make there their dens; no wind there blows;
No lightning falls: a sad religious awe,
The quiet Trees unstirr'd by wind do draw.
Black water Currents from dark Fountains flow:
The Gods unpolished Images do know
No art, but plain, and formlesse trunks they are.
Their moss and mouldinesse procures a fear:
The common figures of known Deities
Are not so feared: not knowing what God it is,
Makes him more awful: by relation
The shaken Earths dark caverns often did groan:
Fallen Yew-trees often of themselves would rise:
With seeming fire often flamed th'unburned Trees:
And winding dragons the cold Oaks embrace,
None give near worship to that baleful place;
The People leave it to the Gods alone.
When black night reigns, or Phoebus gilds the Noon,
The Priest himself trembles, afraid to spy
In th'awful Woods its Guardian-Deity.
But now Erisichthon-like, and like him in Punishment; for his was Hunger,
Caesar's Thirst, and thirst of Humane Blood, revenged soon after in his Own.

The Wood he bids them fell, not standing far
From all their Work: untoucht in former War,
Among the other bared Hills it stands
Of a thick growth; the Soldiers valiant hands
Trembled to strike, moved with the Majesty,
And think the Ax from off the Sacred Tree
Rebounding back, would their own bodies wound:
The amazement of his Men when Caesar found;
In his bold hand himself an Hatchet took,
And first of all assaults a lofty Oak,
And having wounded the Religious Tree,
Let no man fear to fell this Wood (quoth he)
The guilt of this Offense let Caesar bear. etc.
May and so he did soon after, carrying to the Grave ('it is thought) the
Maledictions of the incensed Gauls to his Funeral-pile, -- For who
The Gods thus injured, unrevenged does go?
-- Quis enim laesos impune putar^^
Esse Deos --


18. But least this be charged with Superstition, because the Instances are
Heathen: It was a more noble and remarkable, as well as recent Example, when at
the Siege of Breda, the late Famous General Spinola Commanded his Army not to
violate a Tree of a certain Wood belonging to the Prince of Orange there,
though a reputed Traitor, and in open defiance with his Master. In sum, we
read, that when Mithridates but deliberated about the cutting down of some
stately Trees which grew near Patara, a City of Lycia, though necessitated to
it for the building of Warlike Engines with them, being terrified in a Vision,
he desisted from his purpose. It were to be wished these, or the like Examples,
might have wrought some Effects upon the Sacrilegious Purchasers, and disloyal
Invaders in this Iron-Age amongst us, who have lately made so prodigious a
spoil of those goodly Forests, Woods, and Trees (to gratify an impious and
unworthy Avarice) which being once the Treasure and Ornament of this Nation,
were doubtless reserved by our more prudent Ancestors for the repairs of our
floating Castles, the safeguard and boast of this renowned Island, when
Necessity, or some imminent Peril should threaten it, or call for their
Assistance; and not to be devoured by these improvident Wretches, who, to their
eternal Reproach, did (with the Royal Patrimony) swallow likewise Gods own
Inheritance; Quae tibi factorum poenas instare tuorum Vaticinor --
but whose Sons and Nephews we have lived to see hastily disgorge them again;
and with it all the rest of their Holy Purchases, which otherwise they might
securely have enjoyed. But this, in terrorem only, Vide Met. l. 8. Apollon. l.

and for Caution to Posterity, whiles we leave the Guilty, and those who have
done the Mischiefs, to their proper Scorpions, and to their
Erisichthonian-fate, or that of the inexorable Paraebius, the vengeance of the
Dryads, and to their Tutelar better Genius, if any yet remain, who love the
solid Honor and Ornament of their Country: For what could I say less, (...),
and At Wooton in Surrey: For so in all ages from Trees have been denominated
whole Countries, Regions, Cities and Towns; as Cyparissa in Greece, Cerasus in
Pontus, Laurentum in Italy, Myrrhinus in Attica. Ports, Mountains and eminent
Places; as the Viminalis, Aesculetum, etc. The reason is obvious, from the
spontaneous growth and abounding of such Trees in the respective Soyles.
Wood-born as I am, in behalf of those Sacred Shades, which both grace our
Habitations, and Protect our Nation?

19. But I acknowledge how easy it is to be lost in this Wood, and that I have
hardly power to take off my Pen whilst I am on this delightful Subject: For
what more august, more charming and useful, than the culture and preservation
of such goodly Plantations.

That shade to our Grandchildren give.
-- Seris factura nepotibus umbram.
and afford so sweet, and so agreeable refreshment to our Industrious Wood-man.

Claud. Or some other goodly spreading Trees, such as we told you stopped the
Legions of a proud Conqueror, and that the wise Socrates swear by: That
Passenius Crispus did Sacrifice to, and the honors of his Gods.

20. But, whilst we condemn this Excess in them; Christians, and true
Philosophers may be instructed to make use of these Enjoyments to better
purposes, by contemplating the Miracles of their Production and structure: And
what Mortal is there so perfect an Atomist, who will undertake to detect the
thousandth part, or point of so exile a Grain; as that insensible rudiment, or
rather halituous spirit, which brings forth the lofty Firr-Tree, and the
spreading Oak? That Trees of so enormous an height and magnitude, as we find
some Elmes, Planes, and Cypresses; some hard as Iron, and solid as Marble (for
such the Indies furnish many) should be swadl'd and involved within so small a
dimension (if a point may be said to have any) without the least luxation,
confusion or disorder of Parts, and in so weak and feeble a substance; being at
first but a kind of tender mucilage, or rather rotteness, which so easily
dissolves and corrupts Substances so much harder, when they are buried in the
moist Womb of the Earth, whilst this tender, and flexible as it is, shall be
able in time to displace and rent in sunder whole Rocks of stones, and
sometimes to cleave them beyond the force of Iron Wedges, so as even to remove
Mountains? For thus no Weights are observed able to suppress the victorious
Palm; And thus, our Tree (like Man whose inverted Symbol he is) being sown in
corruption, rises in glory, by little and little ascending into an hard erect
Stem of comely dimensions, into a solid Tower as it were; and that which but
lately a single Ant, would easily have born to his little Cavern, now capable
of resisting the fury, and braving the Rage of the most impetuous storms, Magni
mehercle artificis, Epist. 53
clausisse totum in tam exiguo (to use Seneca's expression) and horror est
consideranti.

21. Contemplate we again, What it is which begins this motion or flame,
causing it first to radiate in the Earth, and then to display its Top in the
Air, so different Poles (as I may call them) in such different Mediums? How it
elects, and then intro-sumes its proper food, and gives suck, as it were, to
its yet tender Infant, till it have strength and force to prey on, and digest
the more solid Juices of the Earth; for then, and not 'till then, do the Roots
begin to harden: Consider how it assimilates, separates, and distributes these
several supplies; how it concocts, transmutes, augments, produces and nourishes
without separation of Excrements (at least to us visible) and generates its
like, without violation of Virginity: By what exquisite percolations, and
fermentations it proceeds; for the Heart, Fibers, Veins, Rind, Branches,
Leaves, Blossoms, Fruit; for the strength, Color, Taste, Odor and other
stupendous Qualities, and distinct Faculties, some of them so repugnant and
contrary to others; yet in so uniform, and successive a Series, and all this
performed in the dark, and those secret Recesses of Nature. Quid Foliorum
describam diversitates? What shall we say of the Mysterious forms, variety, and
variegation of the Leaves and Flowers, contrived with such Art, yet without
Art; some round, others long, Oval, Multangular, indented, crisped, rough,
smooth and polished, soft and flexible at every tremulous blast, as if it would
drop in a moment, and yet so obstinately adhering, as to be able to contest
against the fiercest Winds, that prostrate mighty Structures, raising
Hurrocanes, the violence whereof whole Fleets and Countries do often feel; yet
I say, continually making War, and sometimes joining Forces with steeming
showers, against the poor Leaf, tied on by a slender stalk; there it abides
'till God bids it fall: For so the wise Disposer of Things has placed it, not
only for Ornament, but use and protection both of Body and Fruit, from the
excessive heat of Summer, and colds even of the sharpest Winters, and their
immediate impressions; as we find it in all such Places and Trees, as like the
blessed and good man, have always Fruit upon them, ripe, or preparing to
mature; such as the Pine, Fir, Arbutus, Orange and most of those which the
Indies and more Southern Tracts plentifully abound in; where Nature provides
this continual shelter, and clothes them with perennial Garments.

22. Let us again examine with what care the Seeds, those little Souls of
Plants, Quorum exilitas (as one says) vix locum inveniat (in which the whole
and complete Tree; though invisible to our dull sense, is yet perfectly and
entirely wrapped up) are preserved from avolation, diminution and detriment;
exposed, as they seem to be, to all those accidents of Weather, storms and
rapacious Birds, in their spinic, armed and compacted Receptacles; where they
sleep as in their Causes, 'till their Prisons let them gently fall into the
embraces of the Earth, now made pregnant with the Season, and ready for another
Burden: For at the time of Year she fails not to bring them forth; and with
what delight have I beheld this tender and innumerable Offspring repullulating
at the Feet of an aged Tree! from whence the Suckers are drawn, transplanted
and educated by humane Industry; and forgetting the ferity of their Nature,
become civilized to all his Employments.

23. Can we look on the prodigious quantity of Liquor, which one poor wounded
Birch will produce in a few hours, and not be astonished how some Trees should
in so short a space, Weep more than they weigh? and that so dry, so feeble and
wretched a branch as that which bears the Grape, should yield a Juice that
Cheers both God and Man? That the Pine, Fir, Larch, and other Resinous Trees,
Planted in such rude, and uncultivated places, amongst Rocks and dry Pumices,
should transude into Terpentine, and pearl out into Gums, and precious Balms?

24. There are ten Thousand Considerations more, besides that of their
Medicinal and Sanative properties, and the Mechanical Uses mentioned in this
Treatise, which a Contemplative Person may derive from the Groves and the
Woods; all of them the Subject of Wonder; And though he had only the Palm or
the Cocco, which furnishes a great Part of the World with all that even a
Voluptuous Man can need, or almost desire, it were sufficient to employ his
Meditations and his Hands, as long as he had to live, though his years were as
many as the most aged Oak: But a Wise, and a Thinking Man can need none of
these Topics, in every Hedge, and every Field they are before him; and yet we
do not admire them, because they are Common, and obvious: Thus we fall into the
just reproach given by one of the Philosophers (introduced by the Orator) to
those who slighted what they saw every-day, Cic. d^ Not. Deor. L. 2.
because they every-day saw them; Quasi Novitas nos magis quam magnitudo rerum,
debeat ad exquirendas causas excitare: As if Novelty only should be of more
force to engage our enquiry into the Causes of Things, than the Worth and
Magnitude of the Things themselves.

LONDON, Printed by John Martyn and James Allestry, Printers to the Royal
Society. MDCLXX.

To the Right Honorable THOMAS Earl of SOUTHAMPTON, Lord HIGH TREASURER OF
ENGLAND, etc.
My Lord,
IF great Examples did not support it, the dignity and greatness of your Person
would soon have given cheque to this presumption: But since Emperors and Kings
have not only gratefully accepted Works of this nature, but honored them
likewise with their own sacred hands, that Name of yours, (which ought indeed
never to appear but on Instruments of State and fronts of Marble, consecrating
your Wisdom and Virtues to Eternity) will be no way lessened by giving
Patronage to these appendant Rusticities. It is from the Protection and
Cherishment of such as your Lordship is, that these Endeavors of ours may hope
one day to succeed and be prosperous. The noblest and most useful Structures
have laid their Foundations in the Earth: if that prove firm here (and firm I
pronounce it to be, if your Lordship favor it) We shall go on and flourish. I
speak now in relation to the Royal Society, not my self, who am but a Servant
of it only, and a Pioner in the Works. But be its fate what it will, Your
Lordship, who is a Builder, and a lover of all Magnificences, cannot be
displeased at these agreeable Accessories of Planting, and of Gard'ning. But,
my Lord, I pretend by it yet some farther service to the State than that of
merely profit, if in contributing to your divertisement I provide for the
Public health, which is so precious and necessary to it in your excellent
Person. Vouchsafe POMONA your Lordships hand to kiss, and the humble Presenter
of these Papers the honor of being esteemed,

My Lord, Your most humble, and most obedient Servant J. EVELYN.

POMONA, Or An APPENDIX Concerning FRUIT TREES, In relation to CIDER: The
Making, and several ways of Ordering it.
THE PREFACE.
SAt Quercus was the Proverb; (...): in eos qui relicto victu sordido, ad
elegantiorem lautioremque digrediuntur.
and it is now time to walk out of the Woods into the Fields a little, and to
consider what Advancement may be there likewise made by the planting of
FRUIT TREES. For after the Earth is duly cultivated, and pregnant with a Crop
of Grain; it is only by the Furniture of such Trees as bear Fruit, that it
becomes capable of any farther Improvement. If then by discovering how this may
best be effected I can but raise a worthy emulation in our Countrymen; this
addition of noble Ornament, as well as of Wealth and Pleasure, Food and Wine,
may (I presume) obtain some grateful admittance amongst all Promoters of
Industry.

But before I proceed, I must, and do ingenuously acknowledge, that I present
my Reader here with very little of my own, save the pains of collecting and
digesting a few dispersed Notes (but such as are to me exceedingly precious)
which I have received; some from worthy, and most experienced Especially, from
the most excellently learned Dr. Beale of Yeavil in Somersetshire, a Member of
the Royal Society.
Friends of mine; and others, from the well-furnish'd Registers, and Cimelia of
the ROYAL SOCIETY. Especially, those Aphorisms, and Treatises relating to the
History of Cider, which by express commands they have been pleased to enjoin I
should publish with my Sylva.

It is little more than an Age, since Hops (rather a Medical, than Alimental
Vegetable) transmuted our wholesome Ale into Beer; which doubtless much altered
our Constitutions: That one Ingredient (by some not unworthily suspected)
preserving Drink indeed, and so by custom made agreeable; yet repaying the
pleasure with tormenting Diseases, and a shorter life, may deservedly abate our
fondness to it; especially, if with this be considered likewise, the casualties
in planting it, as seldom succeeding more than once in three years; yet
requiring constant charge and culture; Besides that it is none of the least
devourers of young Timber.

And what if a like care, or indeed one quarter of it, were (for the future)
converted to the propagation of Fruit Trees, in all parts of this Nation, as it
is already in some, for the benefit of Cider? (one Shire alone within twenty
miles compass, making no less, yearly, than Fifty thousand Hogsheads) the
commutation would (I persuade my self) rob us of no great Advantage; but
present us with one of the most delicious and wholesome Beverages in the World.

It was by the plain Industry of one Harris (a Fruiterer to King Henry the
Eighth) that the Fields, and Environs of about thirty Towns, in Kent only, were
planted with Fruit, to the universal benefit, and general Improvement of that
County to this day; as by the noble example of my Lord Scudamor, and of some
other publick-spirited Gentlemen in those parts, all Herefordshire is become,
in a manner, but one entire Orchard: And when his Majesty shall once be
pleased, to command the Planting but of some Acres, for the best Cider-fruit,
at every of his Royal Mansions, amongst other of his most laudable
Magnificences; Noblemen, wealthy Purchasers, and Citizens will (doubtless)
follow the Example, till the preference of Cider, wholesome, and more natural
Drinks, do quite vanquish Hopps, and banish all other Drogues of that nature.

But this Improvement (say some) would be generally obstructed by the Tenant,
and High-shoon-men, who are all for the present profit; their expectations
seldom holding out above a year or two at most.

To this it is answered; That therefore should the Lord of the Manor not only
encourage the Work by his own Example, and by the Applause of such Tenants as
can be courted to delight in these kinds of Improvements; but should also
oblige them by Covenants to plant certain Proportions of them, and to preserve
them being planted.

To fortify this profitable Design, It were farther to be desired, that (if
already there be not effectual provision for it which wants only due execution
and quickening) an Act of Parliament might be procured for the Setting but of
two or three Trees in every Acre of Land that shall hereafter be enclosed,
under the Forfeiture of Sixpence per Tree, for some public and charitable
Work, to be levied on the Defaulters. To what an innumerable multitude would
this, in few years, insensibly mount; affording infinite proportions, and
variety of Fruit throughout the Nation, which now takes a Potion for a
refreshment, and drinks its very Bread-corn!

I have seen a Calculation of twenty Fruit Trees to every Five-pounds of yearly
Rent; forty to Ten; sixty to Fifteen; eighty to Twenty; and so according to the
proportion. Had all our Commons, and Waste-lands one Fruit-tree but at every
hundred foot distance, planted, and fenced at the public charge, for the
benefit of the Poor, (whatever might die and miscarry) enough would escape able
to maintain a Stock, which would afford them a most incredible relief. And the
Hedg-rows, and the Champion-grounds, Land-divisions, Mounds, and Head-lands
(where the Plough not coming, it is ever abandoned to Weeds and Briars) would
add yet considerably to these Advantages, without detriment to any man.

As touching the Species, if much have been said to the preference of the
Red-strake before other Cider-Apples, this is to be added; That as the best
Vines, of richest liquor, and greatest burden, do not spend much in wood and
unprofitable branches; so nor does this Tree: for though other Cider may seem
more pleasant (since we decline to give Judgment of what is unknown to us) we
yet attain our purpose, if This shall appear best to reward the Planter, of any
in present practice; especially, for the generality; because it will fit the
most parts which are addicted to these Liquors, but miss of the right kinds,
and prove the most secure from external injuries and Invaders.

But not to refine any farther upon the rare effects of Cider, which is above
all the most eminent, soberly to exhilerate the Spirits of us Hypocondriacal
Islanders, and by a specific quality to chase away that unsociable Spleen,
without excess; we must not forget that the very Blossom of the Fruit perfumes,
and purifies the Ambient Air, which (as Dr Beal well observes in his
Hereford-shire Orchards) is conceived conduces so much to the constant Health
and Longaevity, for which that Country has been always celebrated, fencing
their Habitations and sweet Recesses from Winds, and Winter-invasions, the heat
of the Sun, Hereford-sh. Orch. p. 8.
and his unsufferable darts: And if (says he) we may acknowledge grateful
trifles, for that they harbor a constant Aviary of sweet Singers, which are
here retained without the charge of Italian wires: To which I cannot but add
his following option, That if at any time we are in danger of being hindered
from Trade in Foreign Countries, our English indignation may scorn to feed at
their Tables, to drink of their Liquors, or otherwise to borrow or buy of Them,
or of any their Confederates, so long as our Native Soil does supply us with
such excellent Necessaries.

Nor do we produce these Instances to redeem the Liquor from the superstition,
prejudice, and opinions of those Men who so much magnify the juice of the
Grape above it: But we will here add some Experiments from undeniable success
(in spite of Vintners, and Bauds to men's Palats) were they sufficient to
convince us, and reclaim the vitiated; or that it were possible to dispute of
the pleasantness, riches, and praecedency of Drinks and Diets, and so to
provide for fit, competent, and impartial Judges; when by Nature, Nation, or
Climate (as well as by Custom and Education) we differ in those Extremes.

Most parts of Africa and Asia prefer Coffee before our Noblest Liquors* India,
the Roots and Plants before our best Cooked Venison; Almost all the World crude
water, before our Country Ale and Beer; and we English being generally more for
insipid, luscious, or gross Diet, than for the spicy, poignant, oily, and
highly relished, (witness our universal hatred of Oils, French-wine, or Rhenish
without Sugar; our doting on Currants, Figgs, Plum-pottage, Pies, Pudding,
Cake, etc.) renders yet the difficulty more arduous. But to make good the
Experiment

About thirty years since one M. Tailor (a person well known in Hereford-shire)
challenged a London-Vintner (finding him in the Country) That he would produce
a Cider which should excel his best Spanish or French-wine: The Wager being
deposited, He brings in a good Red-strake to a private House: On that Scene,
all the Vintner could call to be Judges pronounce against his Wine; Nor would
any many there drink French-wine (without the help of Sugar) nor endure Sack
for a full draught; and to those who were not accustomed to either, the more
racy Canaries were no more agreeable than Malaga, too luscious for the
repetition. But this Wager being lost, our Vintner renews his Chartel, upon
these express terms, of Competent and Indifferent Arbitrators: The Gentleman
agrees to the Articles; and thus again after mutual engagements i^ must be
debated who were Competent Judges, and absolutely Indifferent. M. Tailor
proposes Three, whereof the odd Number should by Vote determine: They must be
of the fittest Ages too, or rather the fittest of all Ages, and such as were
inured neither to Cider nor any Wine; and so it was agreed. The Judges convene;
viz. A Youth of ten years old, a Man of thirty, and a Third of sixty; and by
All these also our Vintner lost the Battle. But this is not enough; It Is
assayed again by Nine Judges, the Ternary thrice over; and there it is lost
also: To this we could add another, even of the Cider of Ledbury (which is not
yet the best of Herefordshire) which, when an experienced London-Vintner had
tasted, he wished had been Poison; for that if it were known where he dwelt, it
would utterly undo his Trade. And here I will conclude; for I think never was
fairer Duel; nor can more be reasonably pretended to vindicate this Blessing of
God, and our Native Liquor from their contempt, and to engage our Propagators
of it.

Tot veneficiis placere cogitur, and miramur noxium esse Vinum? Plin.

As it is most ingeniously cited by Dr Charleton, in his excellent Discourse of
the Adulterations of Wine, entered into the Register of the Royal Society; and
(with those other most useful Pieces subjoined) worthy to be published, etc.
See Regist. To. Society, Number. 2.17. December. 28. Jan. 1662. page 67.116. etc.


To sum up all: If Health be more precious than Opinion, I wish our Admirers of
Wines, to the prejudice of Cider, beheld but the Cheat themselves; the
Sophistications, Transformations, Transmutations, Adulterations, Bastardizings,
Brewings, Trickings, not to say, even Arsenical Compassings of this
Sophisticated God they adore; and that they had as true an Inspection into
those Arcana Lucifera, which the Priests of his Temples (our Vintners in their
Taverns) do practice; and then let them drink freely that will; (...): -- Give
me good Cider.

It is noted in our Aphorisms how much this Beverage was esteemed by His late
Majesty, and Court, and there referred to all the Gentry of the invironing
Country, (no strangers to the best VVines) when for several Summers in the City
of Hereford (so encompassed with store of it, and brought thither without
charge, or extraordinary subductions) it was sold for sixpence the
VVine-Quart, not for the scarcity, but the excellency of it: And for the
Red-strake, that it has been seen there hundreds of times (with vehement and
engaged competition) compared with the Cider of other the most celebrated
Fruit, when after a while of vapor, no man stood for any other Liquor in
comparison.

But it is from these Instances (may some say) when the World shall have
multiplied Cider-Trees, that it will be time enough to give Instructions for
the right Pressing and Preserving of the Liquor. The Objection is fair: But
there are already more Persons better furnished with Fruit, than with
Directions how to use it as they should; when in plentiful years so much Cider
is impaired by the ignorant handling, and becomes dead and sour, that many even
surfeit with the Blessing; it being rarely seen in most Countries, that any
remains good, to supply the defects of another year; and the Royal Society
would prevent all this hazard by this free Anticipation. And yet when all this
is said, we undertake not to divine what excellent Cider other soils may bear;
nor do we positively extol the Red-strake farther than the bounds and confines
of Herefordshire, for the Experiments we have produced; but because there are
doubtless many such soils sparsedly throughout this Nation; why should it not
incite our Industry to its utmost effort, and the commendable emulation of
endeavoring to raise a yet kindlier Cider-fruit if it be possible, and which
may prove in it self as good, and as agreeable to the Soil where we plant it?
And certainly, much of this may fairly be expected, from the Trials, Culture,
and Propagation of Kernel-Fruits of innumerable sorts, and from hopeful
VVildings, and the peculiarity of Grounds.

It now remains, that I should make some Apology for my self, to extenuate the
tumultuary Method of the ensuing Periods. Indeed it was not intended for a
queint or elaborate piece of Art; nor is it the design of the Royal Society to
accumulate Repetitions when they can be avoided; and therefore in an Argument
so much beaten as is that of dressing the Seminary, Planting, and modes of
Graffing, it has been with Industry avoided; such rude, and imperfect draughts
being far better in their esteem (and according to my Lord Bacon's) than such
as are adorned with more pomp, and ostentous circumstances, for a pretense to
Perfection. The Time may come when the richness, and fullness of their
Collections may worthily invite some more Industrious Person to accomplish that
History of Agriculture, of which these Pieces (like the limbs of Hippolitus)
are but scattered parts: And it is their greatest ambition for the Public
Good, to provide such Materials, as may serve to Raise, and Beautify that most
desirable Structure.

EVELYN.
POMONA.
CHAP. I. Of the Seminary.
WE had not the least intention to enlarge upon this Title, after we had well
reflected on the many and accurate Directions which are already published, as
well in our French-Gardiner, as in sundry other Treatises of that nature, Dr.
Beale of Yeavil in Somersetshire.
had not a most worthy Member of the Royal Society (to whom we have infinite
Obligations) furnished us with some things very particular and remarkable, in
order to the improvement of our Seminaries, Stocks, etc. which are indeed the
very Basis and Foundation of Cider-Orchards. It is from those precious papers
of his, and of some others (whose Observations also have richly contributed to
this Enterprise) that we shall chiefly entertain our Planter in most of the
following Periods.

Whosoever expects from the kernel of a rich or peculiar Apple or Pear to raise
Fruit of the same kind, is likely to find many obstructions and
disappointments: For the Wilding, ( Crab or Pear) Pomus Sylvestris, being at
the best the natural product of the soundest kernel in the firmest land, and
therefore the gust of the Fruit more strongly austere, fierce, and sharp, and
also the Fruit less and more woody; and the pleasanter or plumper and larger
Apple being the effect of some inteneration, which inclines to a kind of
rebatement of the natural strength of the Tree; the best choice of kernels for
Stocks indefinitely, (and on which we may graff what we please) should be from
the soundest Wilding. For,

A kernel taken from any graffed-Apple, as Pepin, Pear-main, etc. does most
naturally propend to the wildness of the Stock on which 'twas inserted, as
being the natural mother of the kernel, which is the very heart of the Apple;
and also from a more deep and secret Reason, to be hereafter unfolded.

Apples and Pears requiring rather a vulgar and ordinary Fieldland, than a rich
Garden-mould, (as has been often seen to succeed by frequent Observations) it
has been found that kernels sowed in a very high compost, and rank earth, have
produced ( large indeed) but insipid Fruit, hastily rotting on the Trees,
before all the parts of it were mature. Vid. Aphor. 33.

And sometimes when they seemed in outward figure to bear the shape of graffed
Apples, from whence the kernels came, yet the gust did utterly deceive, wanting
that vivacity and pungent agreeableness.

If the kernels of natural Apples (or of ungraffed Trees) should produce the
same, or some other variety of Apples, (as sometimes it succeeds) yet would
this care be seldom operae pretium, and at best but a work of Chance, the
disappointment falling out so often through the fickleness of the Soil: Or
admit that the most proper and constant, yet would the very dews and rain, by
various and mutable Seasons, and even by the Air it self, (which operates
beyond vulgar perception, in the very changes as well of the mould, as of the
seeds and fruit) create almost infinite alterations: And the choice having been
in all places (apparently for some thousands of years) by propagating the most
delicate of Fruits by the Graffs, it is almost a desperate task to attempt the
raising of the like, or better Fruit from the rudiments of the Kernel.

Yet since our design of relieving the want of Wine, by a Succedaneum of Cider,
(as lately improved) is a kind of Modern Invention, We may encourage and
commend their patience and diligence who endeavor to raise several kinds of
Wildings for the trial of that excellent Liquor; especially since by late
experience we have found, that Wildings are the more proper Cider-Fruits; some
of them growing more speedily, bearing sooner, more constantly, and in greater
abundance in leaner Land, much fuller of juice, and that more masculine, and of
a more Winy vigor.

Thus the famous Red-strake of Hereford-shire is a pure Wilding, and within the
memory of some now living surnamed the Scudamores Crab, and then not much known
save in the Neighborhood, etc. Yet now it would be difficult to show that
Red-strake which grew from a kernel in that whole Tract, all being since become
graffed Trees. Thus it is also believed, That the Bromsbury Crab (which carries
the fame in some parts of Gloucestershire) and many of the White Musts, and
Green Musts, are originally Savages; as now in Somersetshire they have a
generous Cider made of promiscuous kernels, or ungraffed Trees, which fills
their confidence that no other Cider does exceed it; and it is indeed strong,
and of a generous vigor.

Nor dare we positively deny, but that even the best of our Table-fruit came
also originally from the kernel: For it is truly noted by my L. Bacon, That the
Fruit does generally obey the Graff, and yields very little to the Stock; yet
some little it does.

The famous Bezy de Hery, an excellent Musky Pear, was brought into the best
Orchards of France from a Forest in Bretainy, where it grew wild, and was but
of late taken notice of.

But now to the deep Reason we lately threatened: We have by an Experiment found
some near affinity between the Kernel of the Apple and the heart or interior
of the Stock: For I saw (says Dr. Beale) an old rotten Kernel-Tree bearing a
delicate Summer-fruit, yielding store of smooth Cider, ( it is called the
French-Kernel-Tree, and is also a Dwarf, as is the Red-strake;) and examining
diverse Kernels, many years successively, of that hollow and decayed Tree, I
found them always very small of growth, and empty, mere skins of Kernels, not
unlike to the emasculated Scrotum of an Eunuch; another younger Tree, issuing
from the sounder part of a Root of the same old Tree, had full and entire
Kernels.

And from some such Observation might the production of Berberies, etc. without
Stones, be happily attempted; an Instrument fitted to take out the marrow or
pith of the Branches, (as the same Dr Beale performed it;) for from the
numerical Bush of that Fruit he found some Branches produce Berberies that had
no stones, others which had; and in searching for the cause of the effect,
perceived, that the pith or heart was taken from the radicat, or main Branches,
as the other was full of pith, and consequently the fruit in perfection; of all
which (he writes me word) he made several trials on other fruit, but left the
place before he could see the event. But he adds;

These many years ( almost twenty) I have yearly tried Kernels in Beds of clean
Earth, Pots, and Pans, and by the very leaves ( as they appeared in first
springing for one month) I could discern how far my Essays had civilized 'em:
The Wilder had shorter, stiffer, brown, or fox-colour'd leaves, The more
ingenuous had more tender, more spreading leaves; and approaching the lighter
verdure of the Berbery leaf when it first appears. He adds,

Some Apples are called Rose-Apples, Rosemary-Apples, Gillyflower-Apples,
Orange-Apples, with several other adjuncts, denominating them, from what Reason
I know not. But if we intended to try such infusions upon the Kernels (as
should endeavor to alter their kinds) we should not approve of the bedabbling
them with such infusions, (for over- moisture would rather enervate than
strengthen them) but rather prepare the Earth the year before, with such
insuccations, and then hinder it from producing any Weeds, till ready for the
Kernels, and then in dewy times, and more frequently when our Climate were
surcharged with rain, cover the Beds and Pots with the small leaves of
Rosemary, Gillyflowers, or other oderiferous Blossoms, and repeat it often, to
the end the dews may meteorize, and emit their finer Spirits, etc. Or if any
shall please to be so-liberal of their Salts and Calcinations of peculiar
Virtues (though possibly the Essay may endanger their seeds) yet the mixture of
such Salts finely reduced and strewed discreetly on their Beds, may be a more
probable means, than those Liquid Infusions which have hitherto been so
confidently boasted. For thus also we are in this Age of ours provided of more
vigorous Ingredients for trials than were known to the Ancients. Finally,

From what has been deduced from the Wilding of several parts, it may
manifestly appear, how much more congeneal some soil is than other, to yield
the best Cider-fruit from the Kernel; and the hazzle ground, or quicker mould,
much better than the more obstinate clay or ranker earth: In hot
Gravelly-Grounds, where almost no sort of Fruit will grow, Pears will thrive;
and a Friend of mine assures me, of One that clave a Rock, and filling it with
a little good Earth, planted a Pear Tree therein, which prosper'd exceedingly:
I add this, that none may go hence without encouragement.

CHAP. II. Of Stocks.
THe former thus established, after all humors and varieties have been
sufficiently wearied, we shall find the Wilding to be the hardiest and most
proper Stock for the most delicate Fruit: This confirmed by Varro, lib. 1. cap.
40. In quamcunque arborem inseras, etc. and it is with reason: However they do
in Hereford-shire, both in practice, and opinion, limit this Rule; and to
preserve the gust of any delicate Apple (as of the Pear-main, Quince-Apple,
Stockin, etc.) rather graff upon a Gennet-Moyle or Cydoddin-Stock, (as there
called) than a Crab-stock; but then indeed they conclude the Tree lasts not so
long; and it is observed, That Apples are better tasted from a clean, light
land, etc. than from stiffer clay, or the more pinguid and luxurious soil,
whence we may expect some assistance from the civility of the Stock, which is a
kind of prepared Soil, or foundation to the Graff; even as our very
Transplantations into better ground is likewise a kind of Graffing.

Thus in like manner our Master Varro, loco citato concerning Pears; Si in
Pyrum Sylvaticam, etc. The Wild-stock does enliven the dull and phlegmatic
Apple, and the Stock of a Gennet-Moyle sweeten and improve an Apple that seems
over-tart, as the Pome-roy, or some Greening, etc. or may rather seem to abate
at least some Apple over-tart and severe.

Your Crab-stock would be planted about October, at thirty two Foot distance,
and not graffed till the third Spring after, or at least not before the second.

But if your design be for Orchard only, and where they are to abide, an
interval of sixteen Foot shall suffice for the Dwarfish kind, or in the Grounds
where the Red-strake, or other Fruit Trees are of small bulk, provided the
ground be yearly turned up with the Spade, and the distance quadrupled where
the Plough has privilege; this being the most expedite for such as have no
Nursery ground.

CHAP. III. Of Graffs and Insitions.
MAke choice of your Graffs from a constant and well-bearing Branch.

And as the Stock has a more verdant rind, and is capable to yield more plenty
of juice, so let the Graff have more Eyes or Buds: Ordinarily three or four
Eyes are sufficient to give issue to the Sap; but as well in Apples, and Pears,
as in Vines, those Graffs or Cions are preferred in which the buds are not too
far asunder, or distant from the foot thereof: and such a number of buds
usually determining the length of the Graff, there may diverse Cions be made of
one Branch, where you cannot procure plenty of them for severals.

As to the success of graffing, the main point is, to join the inward rind of
the Cion to the inward rind of the Stock, so that the sap of the One, may there
meet with the sap of the Other, and these parts should be joined closely, but
not too forceably; that being the best and most infallible way, by which most
of the quick and juicy parts are mutually united, especially toward the bottom.

If the Stock be so big as to endanger the pinching of your Graff, when the
wedge is drawn out of the cleft, let the inner side of the Graff, which is
within the wood of the Stock, be left the thicker, that so the woody part of
the Cion may bear the stress, and the sappy part be preserved from bruising.
Some by an happy-hand, do with good success Graff without cleaving the Stock at
all, only by Incisions in the Rind, as the Industrious Mr. Austin teaches us:
But since this is not for every Rustic hand, nor seems to fortify so strongly
against impetuous Winds, before the Union be secure, there had need be some
extraordinary defense.

Choose the streightest and smoothest part of the Stock for the place where you
intend to graff: If the Stock be all knotty (which some esteem no impediment)
or crooked, rectify it with the fittest posture of the Graff.

For a Graff covet not a Cions too slender; for the Sun and Wind will sooner
enforce it to wither: Yet are we to distinguish, that for Inoculation, we take
the Bud from a sprig of the last years shoot; and most allow that the Cions
should also have some of the former with it, that it may be the stronger to
graff, and abide to be put close into the Stock, which is thought to advance it
in bearing.

In Hereford-shire they do frequently choose a Graff of several years growth;
and for the graffing of such large Stocks as are taken out of the Woods or
Nurseries, and fitted into rows for Orchards, they choose not the Graffs so
small as in other Countries they require them; which has, it seems, occasioned
some complaint from them that understand not the Reason of the first branch of
this Note. Once for all, the stumpy Graff will be found much superior to the
slender one, and make a much nobler and larger Shoot. This upon experience.

Graff your Cions on that side of the Stock where it may receive the least hurt
from the South-west Wind, it being the most common, and most violent that blows
in Summer; so as the wind may blow it to the Stock, not from it: And when the
Zephyres of the Spring are stirring, choose that Season before all others for
this work.

Some there are who talk of removing the Stock about Christmas, and then also
graff it; which there be that glory they can succesfully do even by the fire
side, and so not be forced to expect a two or three years rooting of the Stock;
But in this Adventure it is advisable to plunge the Graff three or four inches
deep in the Stock. Lastly,

Be careful that the Rain get not into the clefts of your young graffed Stocks:
Yet it has been noted, That many old Trees (quite decayed with an inward
hollowness) have born as full burdens, and constantly, as the very soundest,
and the Fruit found to be more delicate than usually the same kind from a
perfect and more entire Stock.

Except some former case requires it, leave not your Graffs above four, five,
or (at most) six inches of length above the Stock; for by the length it draws
more feebly, and is more exposed to the shocks of the Wind, or hurt by the
Birds; and you shall frequently perceive the summities and tops of such young
Graffs to be mortified and die.

The Genet-moyle is commonly propagated by cutting off the Branch a little
below a Burr-knot, and setting it without any more Ceremony; but if they be
also graffed first as they grow on the Tree, and when they have covered the
head, cut off below the Burr, and set, it is far better: In this separation cut
a little beneath the Burr, and peel off, or prick the Bark, almost to the knot:
Thus also if the Branch have more knots than one, you may graff, and cut off
yearly, till within half a foot of the very stem, which you may graff likewise,
and so let stand.

Now for encouragement in transporting Graffs at great distance, we find that
with little care (their tops uncut and unbruis'd) they will hold good, and may
support the transportation by Sea or Land from October or November to the very
end of March: See Sir H. Plat's Offers, Paragr. 75. To which may be added, That
if the Graff receives no hurt by lying in the Stock exposed to all rain, dews,
and severities of Winter frosts from December to Spring, (as has been
experimentally noted); then (by a stronger presumption) in oyled, or rather
waxen Leather, it may undoubtedly escape. Some prescribe, That the ends shall
be stuck in a Turnip: and many excellent Graffers ( Gentlemen some of very good
credit) have assured us, That the Graffs which seemed withered, and fit to be
cast away, have proved the best when tried. Thus in honest Barnaby Googes noble
Heresbachius you will find it commended to gather your Cions in the wane of the
Moon, at least ten days before you graff them; and Constantine gives this
reason for it, That the Graff a little withered, and thirsty, may be the better
received of the Stock: I know some who keep them in Earth, from the end of
October, till the Spring, and will hardly use them before. There are also other
inducements for this practice, as Simon Harwood, page 4. has showed us; but
none beyond our own experience, who have known Graffs gathered in December
thrive and do perfectly well.

The best expedient to convey Graffs is to stick the cut-ends in Clay,
envelop'd with a clout to preserve it from falling off; and to wrap the other
part of the Twigs in dry Hay or straw-bands, which will secure them both from
the Winds, Galling, and other injuries in Transportation: Nay, I have known
them sent many hundred Miles from beyond the Seas accommodated to an ordinary
Letter, and though somewhat short, and with very few Buds, yet with excellent
success; and if this course were more universally considered, we might be
furnished with many great Curiosities with little difficulty or charge.

CHAP. IV. Of Variety and Improvements.
IF any man would have variety of unexpected and unknown Apples and Pears, for
the improvement of Cider, or Palate-fruit, there is more hope from Kernels
raised in the Nursery (as has already been directed) than from such trials of
graffings as we have yet seen in present use.

But if we would recover the patience, and the sedulity of the Ancient (of
which some brief account will follow) or listen to some unusual Proposals, then
may we undertake for some variety by Insitions.

To delude none with Promises, we do much rather recommend the diligence of
enquiring from all Countries the best Graffs of such Fruits as are already
found excellent for the purpose we design: As from the Turgovians for that Pear
of which Dr. Pell gives so good and weighty informations; and of which I had
presented me some Graffs, together with a taste of the most superlative Perry
the World certainly produces; both which were brought near 800 Miles, without
suffering the least diminution of Excellency, by my Worthy Friend Mr. Hake a
Member of the R. Society, in the year 1666, and tasting as high, and as rich as
ever to the present year I am writing this Paragraph.

But as some sorts are to be enquired after for the Palate and the Table, so
it is now our main business to search after such as are excellent for their
Liquor, either as more pleasant, more winy, or more lasting; of which sort the
Bosbury bare-land-Pear excels. The Red struck, Bromebury-Crab, and that other
much celebrated Wilding called the Oaken-pin, as the best for Cider; though for
sufficient reasons we do yet prefer the Red struck, to oblige the emulation of
other Countries, 'till they find out a Fruit which shall excel it, and which
we do most heartily wish.

But to pursue the diligence of the Ancients, we direct the eye to a general
expedient for all kind of varieties imaginable, and which we hold far better
than to present the World with a List of the particulars either known, or
experimented: For who indeed but a Fool will dare to tell Wonders in this
severe Age, and upon an Argument which is so environed with Imposture in most
Writers old or new? Much less pretend to Experiments which may fail to succeed
by default of an unhappy occasion, when the conclusion must be Penes Authorem
sit fides!

And truly men receive no small discouragement from the ugly affronts of
Clowns, and less cultivated persons, who laugh and scorn at every thing which
is above their understanding: For example; I knew a man (writes Dr. Beale to
me) and he a most diligent Planter and Graffer, who for thirty or forty years
made innumerable Essays to produce some change of an Apple by Graffing: It
seems he was ambitious to leave his Name on such a Fruit, if he could have
obtained it; but always failed; for he perpetually made his Trials upon
Crab-stocks, or such (at least) as did not greatly differ from the kind; and he
ever found that the Graff would praedominate. And how infinitely such Men
having lost their own aims, will despise better Advice, we leave to observation.

However, let us add, That where nothing is more facile than to raise new kinds
of Apples (in infinitum) from Kernels: Yet in that Apple-Country (so much
addicted to Orchards) we could never encounter more than two or three persons
that did believe it: But in other places we meet with many that, on the other
side, repute Wildings, or (as they call them) Kernel-fruit, at all adventure,
and without choice, to be the very best of Cider-fruit, and to make the most
noble Liquor. So much does the common judgment differ in several Countries,
though at no considerable distance, even in matters of visible Fact, and
epidemical experience.

It has been soberly affirmed, that by graffing any White Apple upon an Elm, it
changes the Apple, and particularly to a red color: I have a Direction where
we may be eyewitnesses of the proof; whatever the Truth of it be, we are not
over-hastily to erect Hercules's Pillars; but rather to encourage the
Experiment.

To gratify yet the Ingenious, instruct others, and emancipate us all from
these bastinado-Clowns, we are furnished with many Arguments and proofs to
assure a good success, at least for variety and change, if not for infinite
choice: Two or three ancient References being duly praemis'd; namely, First,

1. That it is in vain to expect change of Apples from Graffing upon differing
Stocks of Crabs or Apples.

2. In vain also are we to look for a kind Tree from a very much differing
Stock; as an altered Pear to grow kindly on a Crab or Apple-stock, and contra.
There go about indeed some jugglings, but we disdain to name them.

It is one thing to find the kindest Stock for the Improvement of any Fruit; as
the Crab-stock for the delicate Apple, the Wild or Black-Cherry-Stock, for the
graffs of the fairest Cherries; the largest Vine, (whose root makes best shift
for relief) to accept the Graff of the more delicate Vine; the White Pear-Plum
Stock, for the Abricot, etc. And another thing it is to seek the Stock which
begets the wonder, variety, and that same transcendent and particular
excellency we inquire after: For this must be at more remote distance; and we
offer from the Ancients to show, how it may be at any distance whatsoever: But
the whole expedient seems to be hinted by Sir H. Plat, page 72. where he
affirms, that If two Trees grow together, that be apt to be graffed one into
another, then let one branch into another, workmanly joining Sap to Sap. This
our Gardiners call Graffing by Approach, and is explicated at large by
Columella.

But in this express Rule he is too narrow for our purpose, and far short of
old experience; as we find in Parag. 63. where he affirms, We may not graff a
contrary Fruit thereon. Against this we urge; That any contrary Fruit may be
adventured, and any Fruit upon any fruitless Stock growing in propinquity in
the same Nursery; as it is not only affirmed, but seriously undertaken, and
experimentally proved by the sober Columella, in several of his Treatises; Turn
to the eleventh Chapter of his fifth Book, ( Stephens Ediiion:) Sed cum antiqui
negaverint posse omne genus surculorum in omnem Arborem inseri, and illam quasi
finitionem, qua nos paulo ante usi sumus, veluti quandam legem sanxerint, eos
tantum surculos posse coalescere, qui sint cortice, ac libro, and fructu
consimiles iis arboribus quibus inseruntur, existimavimus errorem hujus
opinionis discutiendum, tradendamque posteris rationem, qua possit omne genus
surculi omni generi Arboris inseri. And the example follows in a Graff of an
Olive into a Fig-stock by Approach (as we call it,) which he also repeats in
the twenty seventh Chapter of his Book De Arboribus, without altering a
syllable. But possibly in this check at the Ancient he might aim at old Varro,
whom we find threatening no less than Thunderbolts and Blasts to those who
should attempt these strange Marriages, and did not sort the Graff with the
Tree; consult lib. 1. cap. 40. And yet you may see this Art assumed by
Columella for his own invention (1500 years since) to be no news to Varro 200
years older; where he goes on, Est altera species ex arbore in arborem
inserendi nuper animadversa in arboribus propinquis, etc. Though here again we
may question our Masters nuper animadversa too; since before he was born Cato
relates it as usual to Graff. Vines in the manner by them prescribed, cap. 41.
Tertia insitio est: Terebra vitem quam inseres, etc. Which by the way makes us
admire how the witty Walchius in his Discourse De vitibus fructuariis, page
265. could recount the graffing of Vines amongst the wonders of Modern
Inventions.

But it seems Varro and his Contemporaries did extend the practice beyond Cato;
and Columella proceeded further than Varro, even to all sorts of Trees, however
differing in nature, quality, bark, or season: And then Palladius assumes the
result, and gives us the particulars of the success in his Poem, De
Infitionibus. And to these four as in chief (no fantastical or counterfeit
persons) we refer the Industrious.

But be pleased to take this note also: As soon as your Graff has attained to
a second, or at farthest a third years growth, take it off the Stock, and then
graff it upon a Stock of a more natural kind: For in our own Trials we have
found a graff prosper the second year exceeding well; yet the third the whole
growth at once blasted quite to the very Stock, as if Varro's Augurs had said
the word.

To this add, the making use of such Stocks as in this Experiment may
contribute some special aid to several kinds of humane Infirmities: As suppose
the Birch Tree for the Stone, the Elm for Fevers, etc. For it is evident, that
by such Insitions, the Branch may convert the Sap of the Root even of another
species into its own nature, and alter all its properties; though in some they
dominere, as the Branch of the Apple in the Rhamnus, or Mezerea, acquires a
Purgative quality. And by these means why may not the Fruit by effectual
Marriages be rendered Cordial, Astringent, Purgative, Sudorific, Soporiferous,
and even Deliterious and Mortal: But this we only hint.

Moreover, To graff rather the Wilding, or Crab, than the Pepin, because the
Wilding is the more natural; and Nature does more delight in progress, than to
be Retrograde and go backwards.

I should also expect far more advance from a more pungent sap, than from
Insipid; as generally we see the best and vigorous juices to salute our Palats
with a more agreeable piquancy and tartness; for so we find the relish of the
Stocking-Apple, Golden Pepin, Pearmain, Eliot, Harvy, and all (both Russetings
and Greenings) to be more poignant than of others.

And here we note from Palladius, That the Ancients had the success which we
all, and particularly Sir H. Plat, does so frequently deny, as in the
particular of graffing the Apple on the Pear, and contra. Let us hear him de
Pomo.

The Graffed-Crab its bushy Head does rear,
Much Meliorating the inserted Pear:
Its self to leave its Wildness does invite,
And in a Nobler issue to delight.
Insita proceris pergit concrescere ramis,
Et sociam mutat malus amica Pyrum:
Seque feros sylvis hortatur linquere mores,
Et partu gaudet nobiliore frui.
Pallad. de Insitionib. lib. 14. But possibly Palladius assumed this Poetical
expression, upon presumption, that no man in his days durst degrade the most
excellent Quince to support the Cyon of another Fruit, which then must be of
less esteem, but we by our luxury have found the success.

And we have good argument to believe; That Virgil, and Columella, in several
of their wonderful Relations of these kinds of mixture, (which but for the
prolixity we might now recite) did not so far affect Wonders as to desert the
truth.

You may also observe, That as well the French Gardener, and our Modern
Planters, have found the same benefit from the Stock of the Quince, as old
Palladius did, it seems, acknowledge; yet (as he conceived) more hospitable
still with its own kindred, and that Though the Quince-stock admit all other
Fruit,
Its Cyon with no other stock will suit:
Scorning the Bark of Foreign Trees, does know
Such lovely Fruit on no mean stem can grow:
But the Quince-Graff, to the Quince-stock is joined,
Contented only to improve its kind.
Cum praestet cunctis se fulva cydonia pomis,
Alterius nullo creditur hospitio.
Roboris externi librum aspernata superbit,
Scit tantum nullo crescere posse decus:
Sed propriis pandens cognata cubilia ramis,
Stat, contenta suum nobilitare bonum*
Pallad. de Malo Cydonio.

Lastly, We did by unexpected chance find the facility of graffing the very
youngest Stocks, even of one years growth, by the Root: At a second removal of
the Stocks (being then of two years growth) we observed some Roots so fast
closed together into one, as not to be divorced: Hereupon we concluded, If
casualty, or negligence, chance of spade, or oppression of neighborhood did
this, by Art it might be done more effectually, and possibly to some desirable
purpose; for that then the stock was more apt to receive a mastering
Impression; and any Garden Plant whatsoever might by this process interchange
and mingle their Roots. But this can extend no farther than the Stock may
prevail with the Graff.

And thus we have presented our diligent Ciderist with what Observations and
Arguments of Encouragement, grounded on frequent Experience, we have received
from our most ingenious Correspondents, especially the Learned and truly Candid
Dr Beale, in whose Person we have so long entertained you: and to these we
could add sundry others, were it not now time (whiles we discourse of
possibilities) to conclude with something certain, and to speak of what we have.

For the kinds then of Cider-Apples in being; Gloucestershire affects the
Bromsbury Crab; It affords a smart, winy Liquor, and is peculiarly hardy, but
not so proper for a cold and late-bearing Climate, it being not ripe in hot
Land till the end of Autumn, nor fit to be ground for Cider till Christmas,
lying so long in heaps and preparation.

It is in the same Shire that they likewise much esteem of the white and red
Must-Apple, the sweetest as well as sowrest Pepin, and the Harvy-Apple, which
(being boiled) some prefer to the very best of all Ciders; though from any
experience we have yet seen, we cannot recommend it, and it will want more
particular and infallible Directions before we can be reconciled to the
Adventure, which we have observed so frequently to miscarry.

But about London, and the more Southern Tracts, the Pepin, and especially the
Golden, is esteemed for the making of the most delicious of that Liquor, most
wholesome, and most restorative; and indeed it may (in my poor judgment)
challenge those perfections with very good reason.

By others the Pearmain alone is thought to come in competition with the best;
but, say they, the Cider is for the most part found of the weakest, unless
encouraged with some agreeable Pepin to inspirit it; whereas this is to be
taken according to the constitution of the Fruit; for even Pepins do differ as
much from Pepins in Taste and Liquor, as the Kind, and the Soil dispose them;
nay, though of the same Species; so as the Cider of the Pearmain (though
likewise very different) does not seldom exceed it in that briskness which
others attribute to the Pepin, which is for the most part more smooth and less
poinant: I conceive a good way of extracting the Spirits of these Fruits, might
prove a likely Criterion to ground our judgments on in all these niceties;
whilst by the way, we may note, that of all Apples, that bear one general Name,
the Pepin seems the most to differ; and the Cider from the genuine Cider-Fruit,
keeps nearest to the same strength and relish.

Some commend the Fox-Whelp; and the Gennet-Moyle was once preferred to the
very Red-strake, and before the Bromsbury-Crab; but upon more mature
consideration, the very Critics themselves now Recant, as being too effeminate
and soft for a judicious Palate.

The Red-strake then amongst these accurate Tasters has obtained the absolute
praeeminence of all other Cider-fruit, especially in Hereford-shire, See Aph.
42, 45, 37.
as being the richest and most vinous Liquor, and now with the more earnestness
commended to our practice, for its celerity in becoming an Orchard, being
ordinarily as full of Fruit at ten years growth as other Trees are at twenty;
the Pepin or Pearmain at thirty: And lastly, from that no contemptible quality,
That though the smiles of it entice even on the Tree, as being indeed better
than most other Table-fruits whilst hanging, yet it needs no Priapus for
Protector, since (as beautiful as it is) it has no such temptation to the Taste,
'till it be either baked, or converted into Cider. The same may be affirmed
also of the Broms-bery-Crab, Bareland-Pear, and many other Wildings, who are no
less at their Self-defence; yet the Gennet-Moyle at due maturity, has both a
gentle, and agreeable relish; their unagreeableness to the Palate (as
elsewhere noted) proceeding only from the separation the juice makes from the
Pulp, which even Children do remedy by contusing them on their sharpened Elbows;
which (if thoroughly weighed) seems to dispute, if not overthrow some Hypotheses
of Fermentation.

In sum, The Red-strake will at three years graffing give you fair hopes, and
last almost an hundred years; if from sundry men's Experience of more than 60
years, we may divine, and that it agree with the Soil. And the Gennet-Moyles
hasten to an Orchard for Cider without trouble of Art or Graffing: But note,
See C. Taylor's Discourse of Cider.
That this Tree is very apt to contract a bur-knot near its Trunk, where it
begins to divide; and being cut off under that boss, commonly grows (if so set)
and becomes speedily a Tree, except it encounter an extraordinary dry Summer
the first year to give it check. And though the knack of graffing be so
obvious, yet this more appearing facility does so please the lazy Clowns, that
in some places they neither have nor desire any other Orchards; and how this
humor prevails you may perceive by the hasty progress of our Kentish Codlin in
most parts of England. But this hasty growth and maturity of the Tree is by
another Instance confirmed to us from that worthy Gent. Mr. Blount of Orleton,
who writes me word, that some of the rejected Spray, or Prunings of the
Gennet-Moyle, taken by chance to rice a Plot of Pease (though stuck into the
Earth but at April) put forth root, grew, blossomed, and bore Apples the same
year.

But to advance again our Red-strake, even above the Pepin, and the rest
(besides the celerity of the improvement and constant burden) consider we the
most incredible product, since we may expect from each Apple more than double
the quantity; so as in the same Orchard, under the same culture, thirty
Red-strake Trees shall at ten years graffing yield more Cider than a hundred of
those Pepins, and surmount them in proportion during their period at least
sixty or seventy years: So that granting the Cider of the Golden-Pepin should
excel, (which with some is precarious) yet it is in no wise proper for a
Cider-Orchard, according to our general design, not by half so soon bearing,
nor so constantly, nor in that quantity, nor fullness or security.

Concerning Perry, the Horse-Pear and Bare-land-Pear are reputed of the best,
as bearing almost their weight of spriteful and vinous Liquor. The Experienced
prefer the tawny or ruddy sort, Aph. 43. Aph. 34.
as the color of all other most proper for Perry: They will grow in
common-fields, gravelly, wild, and stony ground, to that largeness, as one only
Tree has been usually known to make three or four Hogsheads: That of Bosbury,
and some others, are so tart and harsh that there is nothing more safe from
plunder, when even a Swine will not take them in his mouth. But thus likewise
would the abundance preserve these Fruits, as we see it does in Normandy.

CHAP. V. Of the Place and Order.
WE do seriously prefer a very wild Orchard, as mainly intended for the public
utility, and to our purpose of obliging the People, as with a speedy Plantation
yielding store for Cider: Upon this it is that we do so frequently inculcate,
how well they thrive upon Arable, whilst the continuing it so accelerates the
growth in almost half the time: And if the Arable can be so levelled (as
commonly we see it for Barly-land) then without detriment it may assume the
Ornament of Cyrus, and flourish in the Quincunx.

If it be shallow Land, or must be raised with high Ridges, then it is necessary
to have more regard of planting on the tops of those eminencies, and to excuse
the unavoydable breach of the decussis, as my Lord Verulam excuses the defect
of our humane phansies in the Constellations, which obey the Omnipotent order
rather than ours: Add to this the rigor of the Royal Society, which approves
more of plainness and usefulness, than of niceness and curiosity; whiles many
putting themselves to the vast charge of levelling their grounds, oftentimes
make them but the worse; since where the places are full of ghastly
inequalities, there may be planted some sorts of Cider-fruit, which is apt by
the great burden to be pressed down to the ground, and there (whiles it hides
Irregularities) to bear much better, and abundantly beyond belief; for so have
been seen many such recumbent Pear Trees bear each of them two, three, yea,
even to six or more Hogsheads yearly.

And for this Cider, whiles we prefer some sorts of Wildings which do not tempt
the palate of a Thief, by the caution we shall not provoke any man to repent
his charge from the necessity of richer and more reserved Enclosures; Though we
have frequently seen diverse Orchards successfully planted on very poor Arable,
and even in stony Gleab, gravel and clay, and that pretty high, on the sides
and declivities of Hills, where it only bears very short grass, like to the
most ordinary Common, not worth the charge of Tillage: And yet even there the
Tenants and Confiners sometimes enclose it for the Fruit, and find their
reward, though not equally to such Orchards as are planted on better ground,
and in the Valleys. Hence we suggest, That if there be no Statute for it,
'twere to be wished there were a Law which should allow endeavors of this
nature out of the Common-field, to enclose for these Encouragements, since both
the Public and the Poor (whatever the clamor is) are advantaged by such
Enclosures, as Tusser in his old Rhimes, and all indifferent observers
apprehend with good reason.

True indeed it is, That all Land is not fit for Orcharding, so as even where
to form just Enclosures, being either too shallow and dry, or too wet and
sterving: But this (says the judicious Mr Buckland) we may aver, That there
are few Parishes, or Hamlets in England where there are not some fat and deep
Headlands capable of Rows of Trees; and that (as has been said) the raised
Banks of all Enclosures generally by the advantage of the depth, fatness, and
health of their Mould, yield ready opportunity for planting; ( yea, and in many
Countries multitudes of Crab-stocks fit to be graffed;) in which latter (says
he) I have frequently observed very goodly Fruit-bearing Trees, when in the
same soil Trees in Orchards have been poor and worth nothing. To conclude,

If the soil be very bad and unkind, any other Fruit (which it may more freely
yield without requiring much depth, and less Sun) may be planted instead of
Apples.

CHAP. VI. Of Transplanting, and Distance.
THe most proper season for Transplanting is before the hard Frosts of Winter
surprise you, and that is a competent while before Christmas: And the main
point is, to see that the Roots be larger than the Head; and the more ways that
extends, the better and firmer.

If the Stock seems able to stand on its own three or four legs (as we may call
'em,) and then after settlement some stones be heaped or laid about it, as it
were gently wedging it fast, and safe from Winds (which stones may after the
second or third year be removed) it will salve from the main danger: For if the
Roots be much shaken the first Spring, it will hardly recover it.

You may transplant a Fruit-Tree almost at any tolerable season of the Year,
especially if you apprehend it may be spent before you have finished your work,
having many to remove: Thus, let your Trees be taken up about Allhallontide,
(or as soon as the leaf begins to fall); then having trimmed and quickened the
Roots, set them in a Pit, forty, fifty, or a hundred together, yet so as they
may be covered with mould, and kept very fresh: By the Spring they will be
found well cured of their wounds, and so ready to strike root and put forth,
that being Transplanted where they are to stand, they will take suddenly, and
seldom fail; whereas being thus cut at Spring they recover with greater hazard.

The very Roots of Trees planted in the ground, and buried within a quarter of
an Inch, or little more, of the level of the Bed, will sprout, and grow to be
very good Stocks. This and the other being Experiments of our own, we thought
convenient to mention.

By the often removal of a Wild-stock, cutting the ends of the Roots, and
dis-branching somewhat of the Head at every change of place, it will greatly
abate of its natural wildness, and in time bring forth more civil and ingenuous
Fruit: Thus Gillyflowers do (by often removals, and at full-Moon especially)
increase and multiply the leaves.

Plant not too deep; for the over-turf is always richer than the next Mould.
How material it is to keep the coast or side of the Stock, as well in
Fruit Trees as in Forest, we have sufficiently discussed; nor is the Negative
to be proved.

See Aph. 35.
For the distance in Fields, they may be set from thirty two to sixty Foot, so
as not to hinder the Plough, nor the benefit of manure and soil; but in
hedg-rows as much nearer as you please, Sun and Air considered.

CHAP. VII. Of the Fencing.
SEeing a Cider-Orchard is but a wild Plantation, best in Arable well enclosed
from Beasts, and yet better on the Tops, Ridges, and natural Inequalities,
(though with some loss of Order, as we showed,) one of the greatest
discouragements is the preserving of our Trees being planted, the raising of
them so familiar.

We have in our Sylva treated in particular of this, as of one of the most
material obstacles; wherein yet we did purposely omit one Expedient, which came
then to our hands from the very Industrious Mr. Buckland to the Learned Dr.
Beal: You shall have it in his own words.

This of Fencing single Trees uses to be done by Rails at great charges; or by
Hedges and Bushes, which every other year must be renewed, and the materials
not to be had in all places neither. I therefore prefer and commend to you the
ensuing form of Planting and Fencing, which is more cheap and easy, and which
has other Advantages in it, and not commonly known. I never saw it but once,
and that imperfectly performed; but have practiced it my self with success:
Take it thus.

Set your Tree on the Green-swarth, or five or six inches under it if the soil
be very healthy; if moist or weeping, half a foot above it; then cut a Trench
round that Tree, two foot or more in the clear from it: Lay a rank of the
Turfs, with the grass outward, upon the inner side of the Trench toward your
Plant, and then a second rank upon the former, and so a third, and fourth, all
orderly placed, ( as in a Fortification) and leaning, toward the Tree, after
the form of a Pyramide, or larger Hop-hill: Always as you place a row of Turfs
in compass, you must fill up the inner part of the Circle with the loose Earth
of the second spit which you dig out of your Trench, and which is to be two
foot and half wide, or more, as you desire to mount the hillock, which by this
means you will have raised about your Plant near three foot in height. At the
point it needs not be above two foot or eighteen inches diametre, where you may
leave the Earth in form of a Dish, to convey the Rain toward the body of the
Tree; and upon the top of this hillock prick up five or six small Briars or
Thorns, binding them lightly to the body of the Plant, and you have finished
the work.

The commodities of this kind of Planting are,

First, Neither Swine, nor Sheep, nor any other sort of Cattle can annoy your
Trees.

Secondly, You may adventure to set the smaller Plants, being thus raised, and
secured from the reach of Cattle.

Thirdly, Your Trees faston in the Hillock against violence of Winds, without
Stakes to fret and canker them.

Fourthly, If the soil be wet, it is hereby made healthy.

Fifthly, If very dry, the hillock defends from the outward heat.

Sixthly, It prevents the Couch-grass, which for the first years insensibly
robs most plants in sandy grounds apt to graze. And,

Lastly, The grazing bank will recompense the nigardly Farmer for the waste of
his Ditch, which otherwise he will sorely bethink.

In the second or third year (by what time your Roots spread) the Trench, if
the Ground be moist, or Seasons wet, will be near filled up again by the
treading of Cattle; for it need not be cleansed; but then you must renew your
Thorns: Yet if the Planter be curious, I should advise a casting of some small
quantity of rich Mould into the bottom of the Trench the second year, which may
improve the growth, and invite the Roots to spread.

In this manner of Planting, where the soil is not rich, the exact Planter
should add a little quantity to each Root of Earth from a frequented Highway,
or Yard where Cattle are kept; One Load will suffice for six or seven Trees;
this being much more proper than rotted soil or loose Earth; the fat Mould best
agreeing with the Apple Tree.

The broader and deeper your Ditch is, the higher will be your Bank, and the
securer your Fence; but then you must add some good Earth in the second year,
as before.

I must subjoyn, That only Trees of an upright growth be thus planted in open
grounds; because spreading of low growing Trees will be still within reach of
Cattle as they increase: Nor have I met with any inconvenience in this kind of
Transplanting (which is applicable to all sorts of Trees) but that the Mole and
the Ant may find ready entertainment the first year, and sometime impairs a
weak rooted Plant; otherwise it rarely miscarries. In sum,

This manner of Fencing is soon executed by an indifferent Workman, who will
easily set and guard six Trees in a Winter day. Thus far Mr. Buckland: To which
we shall only add, That those which are planted in the Hedg-rows need none of
these defenses; for (I am told) in Hereford-shire in the Plantations of their
Quick-sets, or any other, all men did so superstitiously place a Crab-stock at
every twenty foot distance, as if they had been under some rigorous Statute
requiring it; and I am of Opinion, that 'twere better to be content with Fruit
in the bordering Mounds, than to be at all this trouble to raise Tumps, or
temporary banks in the midst of an In^^osure; or if Pears will thrive in the
Plain of the Ortyard, as we frequently see them, (where neither Apple or other
Fruit could in appearance be expected) then Crabs, which may be raised on the
Mounds, will kindly mix the Liquor into very good Beverage.

CHAP. VIII. Of Pruning and Use of the Fruit Trees.
THe Branches are to be lopped in proportion to the bruises of the Roots, whose
fibers else should only be quickened, not altogether cut off nor entangled: For
the Top, let a little of each arm be lopped in Cider-fruit only; but for the
Pears, cut two or three buds deep at the summities of their aspiring Branches,
just above the eye slanting; this will keep them from overhasty mounting,
reduce them into shape, and accelerate their bearing.

To this we add again out of Dr. Beals Herefordshire Orchards, page 23. In a
graffed plant every Bough should be lopped at the very tops, in Apples and
Pears, as in Cherries and Plums, if Transplanted without violation of Roots,
which only indeed renders it less necessary.

In most kinds of natural Plants the Boughs should not at all be lopped, but
some taken off close to the Trunk, that the Root at first Transplantation be
not engaged to maintain too many Suckers, this to be understood, though of such
as grow naturally from the Kernel, or the Bur-knot; especially if removed after
they are well rooted. And this must be done with such discretion, that the
Top-branches be not too close together; for the natural Plant is apt to grow
spiry, and thereby fails, of fruitfulness. Therefore let the reserved Branches
be divided at a convenient roundness.

The Branches of those we call natural Plants (for usually the Graffed
generally fail) that are cut off, may be set, and will grow, though slowly.

If the Top prove spiry, or the fruit unkind, then the due remedy must be in
re-graffing. See Chap. xxviij. in Sylva.

Besides the Perrys, dried and preserved Fruit, useful is the Pear Tree ( and
best the most barren, or Pig-taile, as they call it, which is the Wild
Pyraster) for its excellent colored Timber, hard and levigable ( seldom or not
ordinarily worm-eaten) especially for Stools, Tables, Chairs, Pistol-Stocks,
Instrument-Maker, Cabinets, and very many works of the Joyner, ( who can make
it easily to counterfeit Ebony) and Sculptor, either for flat, or embossed-
Works, and to Engrave upon, because the Grain intercepts not the Tool. And so
is likewise both the Black-Cherry ( especially for the Necks of
Musical-Instruments) and the Plum-Tree.

ANIMADVERSION.
IF some of the following Discourses seem less constant, or (upon occasion)
repugnant to one another, they are to be considered as relating only to the
several gusts, and guizes of Persons and Countries, and not to be looked upon
as recommended Secrets, much less imposed, farther than upon Trial they may
prove grateful to the Public, and the different inclinations of those who
affect these Drinks: nor in reason ought any to decry what is proposed for the
universal Benefit; since it costs them nothing but their civility to so many
obliging Persons.

GENERAL ADVERTISEMENTS CONCERNING CIDER: By Dr BEALE.
1. HE that would treat exactly of Cider and Perry, must lay his foundation so
deep as to begin with the Soil: For as no Culture or Graffs will exalt the
French Wines to compare with the Wines of Greece, Canaries, and Montefiasco; so
neither will the Cider of Bromyard and Ledbury equal that of Ham lacy, and
Kings-Capell, in the same small County of Hereford.

2. Yet the choice of the Graff or Fruit has so much of prevalency, that the
Red-strake-Cider will every where excel common Cider, as the Grape of
Frontignac, Canary, or Baccharach, excels the common French Grape; at least,
till by time and traduction it degenerateth.

3. I cannot divine what Soil or what Fruit would yield the best Cider; or, how
excellent Cider or Perry might be if all Soils in common and all Fruit were
tried; but for thirty years I have tried all sorts of Cider in Hereford-shire,
and for three years I have tried the best Cider in Somersetshire; and for some
years I have had the best Cider of Kent and Essex at my call; yet hitherto I
have always found the Cider of Hereford shire the best, and so adjudged by all
good Palates. But I shall rejoice to be better informed, and truly from all
other Countries; and do both wish and hope, that in a short time, we shall
every where be rich in many Improvements.

4. I cannot undertake to particularize all kind of Soil, no more than to
compute how many syllables may be drawn from the Alphabet; the number of
Alphabetical Elements being better known than the Ingredients and Particles of
Soil, as Chalk, Clay, Gravel, Sand, Marle, (the tenaciousness, color, and
innumerable other qualities, showing endless diversities;) and the Fruit of
Crabs, Apples, and Pears, being as various as of Grapes, Figs, and Plums.

5. Yet in gross, this I note; That as Bacchus amat colles, and a light ground,
so our best Cider comes from the hot Rie-Lands: In fat Wheat-Land it is more
sluggish; and in white, stiff Clay-Land (as in Woollhope in Hereford-shire) the
common Cider retains a thick whey-colour, and not good: Only such as rises
there (by the diligence or some Art of the Inhabitants) is bright and clear,
and so lively, that they are apt to challenge the best.

6. Some Cider mixeth kindly with Water in the Cider-mill, and will hold out a
good small Wine, and less inflaming, all the following Summer. Some Cider (as
of Long-hope, a kind of sour Wood-Land Country of Herefordshire) will not bear
any mixture of Water, but soon decay, and turn more harsh and sour: And thus we
noted in France, some course Wines stuck like paint in the Glass, unwilling to
incorporate with the Water: Vin d' Aye, and other delicate Wines, did spread
themselves more freely, as gold is more ductile than baser metals.

7. Some would, for a fit, extol the Cider of Pearmains, some of Pepins; (and
of Pepins I have found a congenial Liquor, less afflicting splenetick persons,
as in mine own experience I conceived:) And Sir Henry Lingen once extolled the
Cider of Eleots (as richly bedewing the Glass like the best Canaries;) and full
Hogsheads of the Stocking-Apple have been tried amongst us, but disappointing
our expectation, though perhaps by evil ordering: Yet Mr. Gritten highly
boasted a Mixture of Stocking-Apples and May-Pears, tried (as I take it) by
himself: After many years trial of those and many other kinds, the Red-strake
carried the common fame, and from most of those reduced admirers. The
Gennet-Moyl Cider was indeed more acceptable to tender Palats; and it will
require Custom and Judgment to understand the preferrency of the Red-strake,
whose mordicant sweetness most agreeably gives the farewell, endearing the
relish to all flagrant Palats; which both obliges, whets, and sharpens the
stomach with its masculine and winy vigor; and many thousands extol it for
exceeding the ordinary French-Wine: But grant it should not be so strong as
Wine; let me ask how many sober persons abroad addict themselves to mere Wine?
Then compare this with diluted Wine, as usually for temperate men, and then let
the trial be made, whether the Pepin-Cider or Red-strake will retain the winy
vigor in greater proportion of Water. Add to this, That they commonly mingle
Water in the Press with Apples (a good quantity) whiles they grind the Apple;
and the Water thus mixed, at that time, does so pleasingly incorporate in the
grinding, fermentation, and maturity of Vesseling, that it is quite another and
far more pleasant thing than if so much or half so much Water were mingled in
the Cup at the drinking time; as Salt on the Trencher will not give Beef, Pork,
or Neats-Tongue, half that same relish which duly powdered and timely seasoned.

8. I did once preser the Gennet-moyl Cider, but had only the Ladies on my
side, as gentler for their sugary palats, and for one or two sober draughts;
but I saw cause to recant, and to confess the Red-strake to warm and whet the
Stomach, either for meat or more drink.

9. The right Cider-fruit is far more succulent, and the Liquor more easily
divides from the pulpe of the Apple, than in best Table-fruit, in which the
juice and the pulp seem friendly to dissolve together on the tongues end.

10. The Liquor of best Cider-fruit in the Apple, in best season of ripeness,
is more brisk and smart than that which proves duller Cider: And generally the
fiercest Pears, and a kind of tamer Crabs, (and such was the Red-strake called
in my memory) makes the more winy Cider.

11. Palladius denies Perry to bear the heat of Summer; but there is a Pear in
Bosbury, and that Neighborhood, which yields the Liquor richer the second year
than the first, and so by my experience very much amended the third year: They
talk much higher; but that is beyond my account.

12. As Cider is for some time a sluggard, so by like care it may be retained
to keep the Memorials of many Consuls; and these smoaky bottles are the nappy
Wine. My Lord Scudamore seldom fails of three or four years; and he is nobly
liberal to offer the Trial.

13. As red Apples, so red Pears (and amongst them the red Hors-pear next to
the Bosbury) have held out best for the stomach and durance: But Pears do less
gratify the stomach than Apples.

14. The season of grinding these harsh Pears is after a full maturity, not
till they have dropped from the Tree, and there lain under the Tree, or in heaps,
a week, or thereabouts.

15. And so of Cider-Apples, as of Grapes, they require full maturity, which is
best known by their natural fragrancy; and then also, as ripe Grapes require a
few mellowing days, so do all Apples, as about a week or little more, so they
be not bruised, which soon turns to rottenness; and better sound from the Tree
than rotten from the heap; though yet the juice of Apples and Pears (yea, of
Cherrys or Grapes) is not altogether destroyed, or quite putrified, as soon as
the Pulp seems to be corrupted; neither happily needs there such curiosity, to
cull and pick them so accurately, as some prescribe, though doubtless the
cleaner, and less contaminated, the better.

16. That due maurity, and some rest on the heap, does make the Liquor taste
rather of Apples than winy, has no more truth, (if the Cider be kept to fit
age) than that very old Cheese does taste of a Posset.

17. The harsher the wild-fruit is, the longer it must lie on heaps; for of the
same fruit, suddenly ground, I have tasted good Ver juice; being on heaps till
near Christmas, all good-fellows called it Rhenish wine.

18. The Grinding is somewhat considerable, rather too much than too little;
here I saw a Mill in Somersetshire which grinds half a Hogshead at a grist, and
so much the better ground for the frequent rolling.

19. See for This, excellent directions in Mr. Newburghs preserving of the
surface; C. Tailors Vessel, and Dr Smiths closing of it up.
Soon after grinding it should be pressed, and immediately be put into the
Vessel, that it may ferment before the spirits be dissipated; and then also in
fermenting time the Vent-hole should not be so wide as to allow a prodigal
waste of the spirits; and as soon as the ferment begins to allay, the Vessels
should be filled of the same, and well stopped.

20. Of late it is much commended, that before it be pressed the Liquor and Must
should for four and twenty hours ferment together in a Vat for that purpose,
covered, as Ale or Beer in the Yest-vat, and then tunned up. This is said to
enrich the liquor, and to give it somewhat of the tincture of some red Apples,
as I have seen, and very well approved.

21. As Sulphur has some use in Wines, so some do lay Brimstone on a ragge,
and by a wire let it down into the Cider-Vessel and there fire it; and when the
Vessel is full of the smoke, the liquor speedily poured in ferments the better.
I cannot condemn this, for Sulphur is more kind to the Lungs than Cider, and
the impurity will be discharged in the ferment.

22. Apples overlong hoarded before grinding will for a long time hold the
liquor thick; and this liquor will be both pleasant, and as I think, wholesome;
and we see some rich Wines of the later Vintage, and from Greece, retain a like
crassitude, and they are both meat and drink.

23. I have seen thick harsh Cider the second Summer become clear and very
richly pleasant; but I never saw clear acid Cider recover.

24. Wheat or Leven is good and kind in Cider, as in Beer; Juniper Berries
agree well and friendly for Coughs, weak Lungs, and the aged, but not at first
for every Palate: The most infallible and undiscerned improver, is Mustard a
Pint to each Hogshead, bruised, as for sauce, with a mixture of the same Cider,
and applied as soon as the Vessel is to be closed after fermenting.

25. Bottleing is the next improver, and proper for Cider; some put two or
three Raisins into every Bottle, which is to seek aid from the Vine. Here in
Somersetshire I have seen as much as a Wall nut of Sugar, not without cause,
used for this Country Cider.

26. Crabs do not hasten the decay of Perry, but preserve it, as Salt preserves
flesh. But Pears and Crabs being of a thousand kinds require more Aphorisms;
this only I would Note, that Land which refuses Apples, is generally civil to
Pears, and Crabs mingled with them, make a rich and wholesome Cider, and has
sometimes challenged even the best Red-strake.

27. Neither Wheat, Leven, Sulphur, nor Mustard, are used but by very few; and
therefore are not necessary to make Cider last well, for two, three, or four
years.

28. The time of drawing Cider into Bottles is best in March, it being then
clarified by the Winter, and free from the heat of the Sun.

29. In drawing, the best is nearest the heart or middle of the Vessel, as the
Yelk in the Egg.

30. Red-strakes are of diverse kinds, but the name is in Herefordshire
appropriated to one kind, which is fair and large, of a high purple color, the
smell Aromatical, the Tree a very shrub, soon bearing a full burden, and seldom
or never failing till it decays, which is much sooner than other Apple Trees.
It Is lately spread all over Hereford-shire; and he that computes speedy return,
and true Wine, will think of no other Cider-Apple, till a better be found.

31. I said the Red struck is a small shrub, it is of small growth where the
Cider proves richest, for ought we have yet seen in Herefordshire, viz. in
light quick land; and if the land be very dry, jejune and shallow, that and
other Cider-fruit (especially the Gennet-moyle) will suspend the store of fruit
alternatively every other year; except some Blasts or surprising Frosts in the
Spring alter that Method; for two bad years seldom come together, very hardly
three.

32. In good soil, I mean of common field (for fat land is not best for
Cider-fruit, but common arable) I have seen the Trees of good growth, almost
equalling other Cider-trees, the Apple larger and seldom failing of a good
burden: thus in the Vales of Wheat-lands, in strong Glebe or Clay, where the
Cider is not so much extolled: but still Sack is Sack, and Canary differs from
Claret; so does the Red-strake-Cider of the Vale excel any other Cider of the
foresaid soil, such as is already celebrated for its kindness to good Cider.

33. Yet this distinction of Soil requires much experience, and great heed, if
we insist upon accurate directions; for as Lauremberg says, in pingni solo non
seruntur omnia recte, neque, in macro nihil. And for Gardens, Flowers, and
Orchards, I would choose many times such lands as do not please the Husbandman,
either for Wheat or sweet Pasture, which are his chief aims; and thus
Lauremberg, In Arida and tenui terra faelicius proveniunt Ruta, Allium,
Petroselinum, Crocus, Hyssopus, Capparis, Lupini, Satureia, Thymus; Arbores
quoque, tenue and macilentum solum amane; itemque, frutices plerique Hujusmodi
arbores sunt, Pomus, Pyrus, Cerasus, Prunus, Persica, Cotonea, Morus, Juglans,
Corylus, Staphylodendrum, Mespilus, Ornus, Castanea, etc. Frutices, scil.
Vitis, Berberis, Genista, Juniperus, Oxyacantha, Periclymenum, Rosa, Ribesium,
Vva, Spina, Vaccinia, etc.

34. But here also we must distinguish, that Pears will bear in a very stony,
hungry, gravelly-land, such as Apples will not bear in; and I have seen Pears
bear in a tough binding hungry Clay, when Apples could not so well bear it (as
the smooth rinds of the Pear Trees, and the Mossie and cankered rinds of the
Apple trees did prove) the root of a Pear Tree being it seems more able to
pierce a stony and stiff ground. And Cherries, Mulberries and Plums can rejoice
in a richer soil, though by the smalness of the Roots, the shallower soil will
suffice them. And the Quinces require a deeper ground, and will bear with some
degrees of hungry land, if they be supplied with a due measure of succulency,
and neighboring moisture; and the other shrubs, according to the smalness of
their roots, do generally bear a thinner land. I have seen a soil so much too
rank for Apples and Plums, that all their fruits from year to year were always
worm-eaten, till their lives were forfeited to the fire.

35. To take up from these Curiosities, the most useful result to our purpose;
we have always found these Orchards to grow best, last longest, and bear most,
which are frequently tilled for Barley, Wheat, or other Corn, and kept (by
Culture and seasonable rest) in due strength to bear a full crop. And
therefore, whereas the Red-strake might otherwise without much injury be
planted at fifteen or twenty foot distance, and the best distance for other
Cider-fruit has heretofore been reputed thirty, or two and thirty foot; very
good husbands do now allow in their largest Enclosures (as of 20, 40 or 100
Acres) fifty or sixty foot distance, that the Trees may not much hinder the
Plow, and yet receive the benefit of Compost; and a Horse-teem well governed
will (without any damage of danger) plow close to the Trees.

36. In such soil as is here required, namely of good Tillage, an Orchard of
graffed Red-strakes will be of good growth, and good burden, within ten or
twelve years, and branch out with good store to begin an encouragement at three
years graffing; and (except the land be very unkind) will not yield to any
decay within sixty or eighty years, which is a man's age.

37. In some sheets I rendered many Reasons against Mr. Austin of Oxford, why we
should prefer a peculiar Cider-fruit, which in Herefordshire are generally
called Musts; (so we name both the Apple and the Liquor, and Pulpe as mingled
together in the contusion) as from the Latin Mustum. White-Musts of diverse
kinds, Red-cheek'd and Red-strak'd Musts of several kinds, Green-Musts called
also Green-fillet, and Blew-spotted: Why, I say, we should prefer them for
Cider, before Table-fruit, as Pepins, Pearmains, etc. And I do still insist on
them: 1. The Liquor of these Cider-fruits and of many kinds of austere fruit,
which are no better than a sort of full succulent Crabs, is more sprightful,
brisk and winy. For Essay, I sent up many bottles to London, that did me no
discredit. Secondly, One bushel of the Cider-fruit yields twice or thrice as
much liquor. Thirdly, The Tree grows more in three or four years than the other
in ten years, as I often times remarked. Fourthly, The Tree bears far greater
store, and does more generally escape Blasts and Frosts of the Spring. I might
add, that some of these, and especially such Pears as yield the best Perry,
will best escape the hand of the Thief, and may be trusted in the open field.

38. By the first, second and fourth of these Reasons, I must exclude the
Gennet-Moyle from a right Cider fruit, it being dry and very apt to take frosty
blasts; yet it is no Table-fruit, but properly a baking fruit, as the ruddy
color from the Oven shows.

39. I said that the right Cider-fruit generally called Musts, and deserving
the Latin name Mustum, is of diverse kinds; and I have need to note more
expressly that there is a Red-strak'd Must (as I have often seen) but not
generally known, that is quite differing from the famous Red-strake, being much
less, somewhat oblong and like some of the white Musts in shape, and full of a
very good winy liquor. I could willingly name the persons and place where the
distinct kinds are best known: it was first showed me by John Nash of Ashperton
in Herefordshire; and for some years they did in some places distinguish a
Red-strake, as yielding a richer Red-strak'd Cider of a more fulvous or ruddy
color; but this difference, as far as I could find, is but a choice of a
better insolated or ruddy fruit of the best kind, as taken from the South part
of the Tree, or from a soil that renders them richer. But my Lord Scudamore's
is safely of the best sort; and M. Whingate of the Grange in Dimoc, and some of
King's-capel, do best know these and other differences, Straked-Must, right
Red-strake, Red-Redstrake, etc.

40. The greenish Must, (formerly called in the Language of the Country, the
Green-fillet) when the Liquor is of a kindly ripeness, retains a greeness equal
to the Rhenish-glass; which I note for them that conceive no Cider to be fit
for use till it be of the color of old Sack.

41. To direct a little more caution, for enquiry of the right Red-strake, I
should give notice that some Months ago, M. Philips of Mountague in
Somersetshire, showed me a very fair large Red-strake Apple, that by smell and
sight seemed to me and to another of Herefordshire then with me to be the best
Red struck; but when we did cut it, and taste it, we both denied it to be right
(the other with much more confidence than my self) but M. Philips making Cider
of it, this week invited me to it, assuring that already it equals or resembles
High-country-wines. It had not such plenty of juice as our Red strakes with us,
and it had more of the pleasantness of Table-fruit, which might be occasioned,
for ought I know, by the purer and quicker soil. This Apple is here called
Meriot-Ysnot, and great store of them are at Meriot, a Village not far distant:
Possibly, this Meriot may prove to be the Red-strake of Somersetshire, when
they shall please to try it apart with equal diligence and constancy as they do
in Hereford-shire: This fruit is of a very lovely hue, and by some conceived to
be of Affinity to the Red-Jersey-Apple, which is reported to tinge so deeply:
In truth, there can hardly be a deeper Purple, than is our right Herefordshire
Red-strake, having a few streaks toward the Eye, of a dark color, or
Orange-tawny intermingled: But, it is no wonder if an Apple should change its
Name in traveling so far beyond the Severn, when even in this Country, most
sorts of Apples, and especially, Cider-fruit, loses the Name in the next
Village.

42. I may now ask why we should talk of other Cider-fruit or Perry, if the
best Red-strake have all the aforesaid pre-eminencies of richer and more winy
liquor, by half sooner an Orchard, more constantly bearing, etc. An Orchard of
Red-strakes is commonly as full of fruit at ten years, as other Cider-fruit at
twenty years, or as the Pepin and Pearmain at thirty or thereabout.

43. To this may be Answered, that all soils bear not Apples, and to some soils
other Apples may be more kind, and if we be driven to Perry, much we may say
both in behalf of the Perry, and of the Pear; of the fruit, and of the Tree; It
is the goodlier Tree for a Grove, to shelter a house and walks from Summers
heat and Winters cold Winds, and far more lasting; the pleasantest Cider-pear
of a known name amongst them, is the Horse-pear. And it is much argued, whether
the White-horse-pear, or the Red-horse-pear be the better; where both are best,
within two Miles they differ in judgment. The Pear bears almost its weight of
sprightful winy Liquor; and I always preferred the tawny or ruddy Horse-pear,
and generally that color in all Pears that are proper for Perry.

44. I rejected Palladius against the durableness of Perry; his words are,
Hyeme durat, sed prima acescit aestate, Tit. 25. Febr. possibly so of common
Pears, and in hotter Countries; but from good Cellars I have tasted a very
brisk lively and winy liquor of these Horse-pears during the end of Summer; and
a Bosbury-pear I have named and often tried, which without bottleing, in common
Hogsheads of vulgar and indifferent Cellars, proves as well pleasanter as
richer the second year, and yet also better the third year. A very honest,
worthy and witty Gentleman of that neighborhood would engage to me, that in
good Cellars, and in careful custody, it passes any account of decay, and may
be heightened to a kind of Aqua-vitae. I take the information worthy the style
of our modern improvements.

The Pear Tree grows in common fields and wild stony ground, to the largeness
of bearing one, two, three or four Hogsheads each year.

45. This Bosbury-tree, and such generally that bear the most lasting Liquor
and winy, is of such unsufferable taste, that hungry Swine will not smell to
it; or if hunger tempt them to taste, at first crush they shake it out of their
mouths; (I say not this of the Horse-pear) and the Clowns call other Pears, of
best Liquor, Choak-pears, and will offer money to such as dare adventure to
taste them, for their sport; and their mouths will be more stupefied than at
the root of Wake-robin.

46. A row of Crab-trees will give an improvement to any kind of Perry; and
since Pears and Crabs may be of as many kinds as there are kernels, or
different kinds or mixtures of soils; in a general Character I would prefer the
largest and fullest of all austere juices.

47. M. Lill of Mark-hill (aged about 90 years) ever observed this Rule, to
graff no wild Pear Tree till he saw the fruit; if it proved large, juicy, and
brisk, it failed not of good Liquor. But I see cause to say, that to graff a
young tree with a riper graff, and known excellency, is a sure gain and hastens
the return.

48. M. Speak (last high Sheriff of Somersetshire) showed me in his Park some
store of Crab-trees, of such huge Bulk, that in this fertile year he offered a
wager, that they would yield one or two Hogsheads of Liquor each of them; yet
were they small dry Crabs.

49. I have seen several sorts of Crabs (which are the natural Apple, or at
worst but the Wild-Apple) which are as large as many sorts of Apples, and the
Liquor winy.

50. I have disclaimed the Gust of Juniper Berries in Cider; I tried it only
once for my self, and drank it before Christmas: possibly in more time the
relish had been subdued or improved, as of Hops in stale Beer, and of Rennet
in good Parmasan. Neither was the Gust to me otherwise unpleasant than as
Annise-seeds in Bread, rather strange than odious; and by custom made grateful,
and it did hasten the clarification, and increase the briskness to an endless
sparkling: thus it indulgeth the Lungs, and nothing more cheap; where Juniper
grows a Girl may speedily fill her lap with the Berries.

If Barbados Ginger be good, cheaper, and a more pleasant preserver of Beer, it
must probably be most kind for Cider: For first, of all the improvers that I
could name, bruised Mustard was the best; and this Ginger has the same quick,
mordicant vigor, in a more noble and more Aromatique fragrancy. Secondly,
Cider (as I often complain) is of a sluggish and somewhat windy nature; and for
some Months the best of it is chained up with a cold ligature, as we fancy the
fire to be locked up in a cold Flint. This will relieve the prisoner. And
thirdly, will assist the winy vigor for them that would use it instead of a
sparkling Wine. Fourthly, It Is a good sign of much kindness, and great
friendship: it will both enliven the ferment for speedier maturity, and also
hold it out for more duration, both which offices it performs in Beer.

51. Cider being windy before maturity, some that must not wait the leisure of
best Season do put sprigs of Rose-mary and Bays in the Vessel; the first good
for the head, and not unpleasant; the second, an Antidote against Infections;
but less pleasant till time has incorporated the Tastes.

52. And why may we not make mention of all these Mixtures, as well as the
Ancients of their Vinum Marrubii, Vinum Abrotonites, Absynthites, Hyssopites,
Marathites, Thymites, Cydonites, Myrtites, Scillites, Violaceum, Sorbi, etc.

53. And, for mixtures, I think we may challenge the Ancients, in naming the
Red-raspy; of which there is in this County a Lady that makes a Bonella, the
best of Summer drinks. And more yet if we name the Clove-july-flower, or other
July-flowers, a most grateful Cordial, as it is infused by a Lady in
Staffordshire, of the Family of the Devereux's, and by some Ladies of this
Country.

54. I could also give some account of Cherry-wine, and Wine of Plums; the last
of which (in the best Essay that I have yet seen) is hardly worthy to be named:
But, I conceive, and have ground for it, that some good Liquor and Spirits may
be drawn from some sorts of them, and in quantity: And the vast store of
Cherrys in some places, under a penny the pound, and of Plums that bend the
Trees with their burdens, and their expedite growth makes it cheap enough, and
as in the other, so in these, the large English or Dutch sharp Cherry, makes
the Cherry-wine, and the full black, tawny Plum, as big as a Walnut (not the
kind of Heart-Cherrys, nor the Plum which divides from the stone) make the
Wine. Their cheapness should recommend them to more general use at Tables, when
dried like Prunellas (an easy art) and then wholesomer.

55. To return for Red-strake; it is a good drink as soon as well fermented, or
within a Month, better after some Frosts, and when clarified; rich Wine, when
it takes the color of old Sack. In a good Cellar it improves in Hogsheads the
second year; in Bottles and sandy Cellars keeps the Records of late revolutions
and old Majoralties. Quaere the manner of laying them up in sand-houses.

56. I tried some Bottles all a Summer in the bottom of a Fountain; and I
prefer that way where it may be had. And it is somewhat strange if the Land be
neither dry for a sand-house, nor fountainous for this better expedient. When
Cider is settled, and altogether, or almost clarifi'd, then to make it
sprightful and winy, it should be drawn into well cork'd and well bound
bottles, and kept some time in sand or water; the longer the better, if the
kind be good. And Cider being preserved to due age, bottl'd (and kept in cool
places, conservatories, and refrigerating springs) it does almost by time turn
to Aqua-vitae; the Bottles smoke at the opening, and it catches flame speedily,
and will burn like spirit of Wine, with a fiery taste; and it is a laudable
way of trying the vigor of Cider by its promptness to burn, and take fire, and
from the quantity of Aqua-vitae which it yields. Cider affords by way of
Distillation, an incomparable and useful Spirit, and that in such plenty, as
from four Quarts, a full Pint has been extracted.

57. I must not prescribe to other Palats, by asserting to what degree of
Perfection good Cider may be raised, or to compare it with VVines: But when the
late King (of blessed memory) came to Hereford in his distress, and such of the
Gentry of Worcestershire as were brought thither as Prisoners; both King,
Nobility, and Gentry, did prefer it before the best VVines those parts
afforded; and to my knowledge that Cider had no kind of Mixture. Generally all
the Gentry of Herefordshire do abhor all mixtures.

Yet if any man have a desire to try conclusions, and by an harmless Art to
convert Cider into Canary-wine; let the Cider be of the former year, Masculine
and in full body, yet pleasant and well tasted: into such Cider put a spoonful,
or so, of the spirit of Clary, it will have so much of the race of Canary, as
may deceive some who pretend they have discerning Palats.

Sir PAVL NEIL 's DISCOURSE OF CIDER.
My Lord,
IN obedience to the Commands of this Honorable Society, I have at length
endeavored to give this brief Account of that little which I know concerning
the Ordering of Cider; and in that I shall propound to my self six things.

First, To show that Cider made of the best Eating-apples must needs be once
the best; (that is to say) the pleasantest Cider.

Secondly, That hitherto the general opinion has been otherwise, and that the
reason of that mistake was the not apprehending the true cause why the
Pepin-cider, etc. did not retain its sweetness, when the Hard-apple-cider did.

Thirdly, What is the true cause that Pepin-cider, used in the ordinary me^hod,
will not retain its sweetness.

Fourthly, How to cure that evil in Pepin cider.

Fifthly, A probable conjecture, how in some degree by the same Method to amend
the Hard-apple-cider, and French-Wine.

Sixthly, That what is here propounded cannot choose but be wholesome, and may be
done to what degree every man's Palate shall wish.

Having now told your Lordship, what I will endeavor to do before I enter upon
it, I must declare what I will not in the least pretend to do.

1. I do not pretend to any thing concerning the planting and graffing of
Trees, etc.

Nor what Trees will soonest bear or last longest.

Nor what sorts of Trees are the best bearers, and may with least danger grow
in Common fields.

Nor what sort of fruit will yield the greatest store of Cider.

Nor what Cider will keep the longest, and be the strongest, and wholesomest to
drink constantly with meat.

The only thing I shall endeavor, being to prescribe a way to make a sort of
Cider pleasant and quick of taste, and yet wholesome to drink, sometimes, and in
a moderate proportion: For, if this be an Heresy, I must confess my self
guilty; that I prefer Canary-wine, Verdea, the pleasantest Wines of Greece, and
the High-country-wines before the harsh Sherries, Vin de Hermitage, and the
Italian and Portugal rough Wines, or the best Graves-wines; not at all
regarding that I am told, and do believe, that these harsh wines are more
comfortable to the stomach, and a Surfeit of them less noxious, when taken; nor
to be taken but with drinking greater quantities than can with safety be taken
of those other pleasant Wines: I satisfying my self with this, that I like the
pleasant Wines best; which yet are so wholesome, that a man may drink a moderate
quantity of them without prejudice.

Nor shall I at all concern my self, whether this sort of Cider I pretend to is
so vinous a liquor; and consequently will yield so much spirit upon
Distillation, or so soon make the Countryman think himself a Lord, as the
Hard-apple-cider will do: nor whether it will last so long; for it is no part
of my design to persuade the World to lay by the making of Hard-apple-cider;
but rather in a degree to show how to improve that in point of pleasantness,
and that by the making and rightly ordering of Cider of the best Eating-Apples;
as Golden-pepins, Kentish-pepins, Pear-mains, etc. there may be made a more
pleasant liquor for the time it will last, than can be produced from those
Apples which I call Hard-Apples, that is to say, Red-strakes, Gennet-moyles,
the Broms^ury-Crab, etc. which are so harsh that a Hog will hardly eat them.

Nor shall I at all meddle with the making of Perry, or of any mixed drink of
the juice of Apples and Pears; though possibly what I shall say for Cider may
be aptly applied to Perry also.

For the first particular, I asserted that the best Apples would make the
pleasantest, which in my sense is the best Cider; (and I account those the best
Apples, whose juice is the pleasantest at the time when first pressed, before
fermentation) I shall need (besides the experience of the last ten years) only
to say, that it is an undeniable thing in all Wines, that the pleasantest
Grapes make the richest and pleasantest Wines; and that Cider is really but the
Wine of Apples, and not only made by the same way of Compression; but left to
it self has the same way of Fermentation; and therefore must be liable to the
same measures in the choice of the materials.

To my second Assertion, that this truth was not formerly owned, by reason that
in Herefordshire, and those Countries where they abound both with Pepins and
hard-apples of all sorts, they made Cider of both sorts, and used them alike;
that is, that as soon as they ground and pressed the Apples and strained the
Liquor, they put it into their Vessels and there let it lie till it had
wrought, and afterward was settled again and fined; as not thinking it wholesome
to drink till it had thus (as they call it) purged it self, and this was the
frequent use of most men in the more Southern and Western parts of England
also. Now when Cider is thus used, it is no wonder that when they came to
broach it, they for the most part found their Pepin-cider not so pleasant as
their Moyle or Red strake-cider; but to them it seemed a wonder, because they
did not know the reason of it (which shall be my next work to make out) for
till they knew the reason of this ^ffect, they had no cause but to think it was
the nature of the several Apples that produced it; and consequently to prefer
the Hard-Apple-cider, and to use the other Apples (which were good to eat raw)
for the Table: which was an use not less necessary, and for which the
hard-apples were totally improper.

To my third Assertion, which is, that in Herefordshire they knew not what was
the true cause why their Pepin-cider (for by that name I shall generally call
all sorts of Cider that is made of Apples good to eat raw) was not, as they
used it, so good as the Cider made of hard-apples (for by that name, for
brevities sake, I shall call the Cider of Moyle, Red-strake, and all other
sorts of harsh Apples, not fit to eat raw.) First, I say, for all liquors that
are Vinous, the cause that makes them sometimes harder or less pleasant to the
taste, than they were at the first pressing, is the too much fermenting: If
Wine or Cider by any accidental cause do ferment twice, it will be harder than
if it had fermented but once; and if it ferment thrice, it is harder and worse
than if it had fermented but twice: and so onward, the oftener it ferments and
the longer it ferments, it still grows the harder. This being laid as a
foundation, before we proceed further we must first consider what is the cause
of fermentation in Wine, Cider, and all other Vinous Liquors. Which (in my poor
opinion) is the gross part of the Liquor, which scapes in the straining of the
Cider (for in making of Wine, I do not find that they use the curiosity of
straining) and which is generally known by the name of the Lee of that ( Wine
or) Cider. And this Lee I shall, according to its thickness of parts,
distinguish into the gross Lee, and the flying Lee.

Now, according to the old method of making and putting up of Cider, they took
little care of putting up only the clear part of the Cider into their Vessels
or Cask; but put them up thick and thin together, not at all regarding this
separation; for experimentally they found that how thick soever they put it up,
yet after it had thoroughly wrought or fermented and was settled again, it would
still be clear; and perchance that which was put up the soonest after it was
pressed and the thickest, would, when the fermentation was over, be the
clearest, the briskest, and keep the longest. This made them confidently
believe that it was not only not inconvenient to put it up quickly after the
pressing, but in some degree necessary also to put it up soon after the
pressing, so that it might have so much of the Lee mixed with it, that it might
certainly, soon, and strongly put it into a fermentation, as the only means to
make it wholesome, clean and brisk; and when it either did not (or that they had
reason to doubt) that it would not work or ferment strongly enough, they have
used to put in Mustard or some other thing of like nature to increase the
fermentation.

Now that which in Cider of Pepins has been a cause of greater fermentation
than in Cider of Hard-Apples, being both used after the former method, is this,
that the Pepins being a softer fruit are in the Mill bruised into smaller
particles than the harder sorts of Apples; and consequently more of those small
parts pass the strainer in the Pepin-Cider than in the Cider of Hard-apples,
which causes a stronger fermentation, and (according to my former principle) a
greater loss of the native sweetness than in that of Hard-apple-cider; and not
only so, but the Lee of the Hard-apple-cider being compounded of greater
particles than the Lee of the Pepin-cider, every individual particle is in it
self of a greater weight than the particles of the Lee of the Pepin-cider; and
consequently less apt to rise upon small motions, which produces this effect;
that when the fermentation of the Hard-apple-cider is once over, unless the
Vessel be stirred, it seldom falls to a second fermentation; but in Pepin-cider
it is otherwise: For if the gross Lee be still remaining with the Cider, it
needs not the motion of the Vessel to cause a new fermentation, but every
motion of the Air by a change of weather from dry to moist will cause a new
fermentation, and consequently make it work till it has destroyed it self by
losing its native sweetness. And this alone has been the cause, why commonly
when they broach their Pepin-cider they find it so unpleasant, that generally
the Hard-apple-cider is preferred before it, although at first it was not so
pleasant as the Pepin-cider. Yet after this mischief has prevailed over the
Pepin-cider, it is no wonder to find the Hard-apple-cider remaining not only
the stronger, but even the more pleasant tasted. This to me seems satisfactory
for the discovery of the cause, why in Herefordshire the Hard-apple-cider is
preferred before the Pepin-cider. But perhaps it may by some be objected, that
they have before the ten years, in which you pretend you found this to be the
cause of spoiling the Pepin-cider, been in Herefordshire, and tasted the best
Cider that Country did afford; and yet it was not like the Pepin-cider they had
before then tasted in other parts. To this I do answer, at present, briefly,
that by some mistake, or chance, the maker of this Pepin-cider, which proved
good, had done that, or somewhat like that, which under the next Assertion I
shall set down, as a Method to cure the inconveniences which happen to
Pepin-cider, by the suffering it to ferment too often, or too strongly; but
till that be explained it would be improper to show more fully what these
particular accidents might possibly be, which (without the intention of those
persons which made the Cider) caused it to prove much better than their
expectation, or indeed better than any could afterward make: they possibly
assigning the goodness of that Cider to somewhat that was not really the cause
of that effect.

To justify my fourth Assertion, and show a Method how to cure the
inconveniency which happens to Pepin-cider by the over-working, I must first
take notice of some things which I have been often told concerning Wine, and
which indeed gave me the light to know what was the cause which had made
Pepin-cider that had wrought long, hard when it came to be clear again. The
thing I mean, is, that in diverse parts, and even in France they make three
sorts of Wine out of one and the same Grapes; that is, they first take the
juice of the Grapes without any more pressing than what comes from their own
weight in the Vat, and the bruising they have in putting into Vessel, which
causes the ripest of those Grapes to break, and the juice without any pressing
at all makes the pleasantest and most delicate Wine: And if the Grapes were
red, then is this first Wine very pale. The second sort they press a little,
which makes a redder Wine, but neither so pleasant as the first, nor so harsh
as the last, which is made by the utmost pressing of the very skins of the
Grapes, and is by much more harsh, and of deeper color than either of the
other two. Now I presume the cause of this (at least in part) to be, that in
the first sort of Wine, which has little of the substance, beside the very
juice of the Grape, there is little Lee, and consequently little fermentation;
and because it does not work long, it loses but little of the original
sweetness it had: The second sort being a little more pressed has somewhat
more of the substance of the Grape added to the juice; and therefore having
more of that part which causes fermentation put with it, ferments more
strongly, and is therefore, when it has done working, less pleasant than the
first sort, which wrought less. And for the same reason the third sort being
most of all pressed, has most of the substance of the Grape mingled with the
Liquor, and works the longest: but at the end of the working when it settles
and is clear, it is much more harsh than either of the two first sorts. The
thought of this made me first apprehend that the substance of the Apple mingled
with the juice, was the cause of fermentation, which is really nothing else but
an endeavor of the Liquor to free it self from those Heterogeneous parts which
are mingled with it: And where there is the greatest proportion of those
dissimilar parts mingled with the Liquor, the endeavor of Nature must be the
stronger, and take up more time to perfect the separation: which when finished
leaves all the Liquor clear, and the gross parts settled to the bottom of the
Vessel; which we call the Lee. Nor did this apprehension deceive me; for when I
began (according to the Method which I shall hereafter set down) to separate a
considerable part of the Lee from the Cider before it had fermented, I found it
to retain a very great part of its original sweetness, more than it would have
done if the Lee had not been taken away before the fermentation; and this not
once, but constantly for seven years.

Now the Method which I used, was this: When the Cider was first strained, I
put it into a great Vat, and there let it stand twenty four hours at least
(sometimes more, if the Apples were more ripe than ordinary) and then at a tap
before prepared in the Vessel three or four inches from the bottom I drew it
into pails, and from thence filled the Hogshead (or lesser Vessel) and left the
greatest part of the Lee behind; and during this time that the Cider stood in
the Vat, I kept it as close covered with hair-clothes or sacks as I could; that
so too much of the spirits might not evaporate.

Now possibly I might be asked why I did not, since I kept it so close in the
Vat, put it at first into the Vessel? To which I answer, that had I put it at
first into the Vessel, it would possibly (especially if the weather had chanced
to prove wet and warm) have begun to ferment before that time had been expired;
and then there would have been no possibility to have separated any part of the
gross Lee, before the fermentation had been wholly finished; which keeping it
only covered with these clothes was not in danger: For, though I kept it warm
in some degree, yet some of the spirits had still liberty to evaporate; which
had it been in the Hogshead with the Bung only open, they would not so freely
have done; but in the first 24 hours it would have begun to ferment, and so my
design had been fully lost: For those spirits if they had been too strongly
reverberated into the Liquor, would have caused a fermentation before I could
have taken away any part of the gross Lee. For the great mystery of the whole
thing lies in this, to let so many of the spirits evaporate, that the liquor
shall not ferment before the gross Lee be taken away; and yet to keep spirits
enough to cause a fermentation when you would have it. For if you put it up as
soon as it is strained, and do not let some of the spirits evaporate, and the
gross Lee by its weight only to be separated without fermentation, it will
ferment too much and lose its sweetness; and if none be left, it will not
ferment at all; and then the Cider will be dead, flat and sour.

Then after it is put into the Vessel, and the Vessel filled all but a little
(that is, about a Gallon or thereabout) I let it stand (the Bunghole being left
only covered with a paper, to keep out any dust or filth that might fall in)
for 24 hours more; in which time the grossest part of the Lee being formerly
left in the Vat, it will not ferment, but you may draw it off by a Tap some two
or three inches from the bottom of the Vessel, and in that second Vessel you
may stop it up, and let it stand safely till it be fit to Bottle; and possibly
that will be within a day or more: but of this time there is no certain measure
to be given; there being so many things that will make it longer, or less while
before it be fit to bottle. As for Example, If the Apples were over-ripe when
you stamped them, or ground them in the Mill, it will be the longer before it
will be clear enough to Bottle; or if the weather prove to be warmer or moister
than ordinary: or that your Apples were of such kinds, as with the same force
in the stamping or grinding they are broken into smaller particles than other
Apples that were of harder kinds.

Now, for knowing when it is fit to Bottle, I know no certain Rule that can be
given, but to broach the Vessel with a small Piercer, and in that hole fit a
peg, and now and then (two or three times in a day) draw a little, and see what
fineness it is of; for when it is bottled it must not be perfectly fine; for if
it be so, it will not fret in the bottle, which gives it a fine quickness, and
will make it mantle and sparkle in the glass, when you pour it out: And if it
be too thick when it is bottled, then, when it has stood some time in the
bottles it will ferment so much that it may possibly either drive out the
Corks, or break the bottles, or at least be of that sort (which some call
Potgun-drink) that when you open the bottles it will fly about the house, and
be so windy and cutting that it will be inconvenient to drink: For the right
temper of Bottle-Cider is, that it mantle a little and sparkle when it is put
out into the glass; but if it froth and fly, it was bottled too soon: Now the
temper of the Cider is so nice, that it is very hard when you bottle it to
foretell which of these two conditions it will have: but it is very easy
within a few days after (that is to say, about a week, or so) to find its
temper as to this point. For first, if it be bottled too soon; by this time it
will begin to ferment in the Bottles, and in that case you must open the
Bottles, and let them stand open two or three minutes, that that abundance of
spirits may have Vent, which otherwise kept in would in a short time make it of
that sort I called before Potgun-drink; but being let out, that danger will be
avoided, and the Cider (without danger of breaking the bottles) will keep and
ferment, but not too much. Now this is so easy a remedy, that I would advise
all men rather to err on the hand of bottling it too soon, than let it be too
fine when they bottle it; for if so, it will not fret in the bottle at all; and
consequently, want that briskness which is desirable.

Yet even in this case there is a Remedy, but such a one as I am always very
careful to avoid, that so I may have nothing (how little soever) in the Cider
but the juice of the Apple: But the remedy is, in case you be put to a
necessity to use it, that you open every bottle after it has been bottled
about a week or so, and put into each bottle a little piece of white Sugar,
about the bigness of a Nutmeg, and this will set it into a little fermentation,
and give it that briskness which otherwise it would have wanted. But the other
way being full as easy, and then nothing to be added but the juice of the
Apple to be simply the substance of your Cider, I choose to prefer the error of
being in danger to bottle the Cider too soon, rather than too late: Nay
sometimes in the bottling of one and the same Hogshead (or other Vessel) of
Cider, there may the first part of it be too fine; the second part well; and
the last not fine enough: and this happens when it is broached first above the
middle, and then below; and then when it begins to run low, tilted or raised at
the further end, and so all drawn out. But to avoid this inconvenience, I
commonly set the bottles in the order they were filled, and so we need not open
all to see the condition of the Cider; but trying one at each end, and one in
the middle, will serve the turn: And to prevent the inconveniency, broach not
at all above the middle, nor too low; and when you have drawn all that will run
at the Tap, you may be secure it is so far of the same temper with the first
bottle. And then tilt the Vessel; but draw no more in three or four hours at
the least after, and set them by themselves, that so, if you please, you may
three or four days after pour them off into other bottles, and leave the gross
behind: And by this means though you have a less number of bottles of Cider
than you had, yet this will continue good, and neither be apt to fly, nor have
a sediment in the bottle, which after the first glass is filled will render all
the rest of the bottle thick and muddy.

By all this which I have said, I think it may be made out that those persons
which I mentioned in the end of the last Paragraph, that sometimes had
Pepin-cider better than ordinary, and indeed then they could make again, were
beholding to chance for it; either that their Apples were not so full ripe at
that as at other times, and so not bruised into so small parts; but the
fermentation was ended in the Vessel, and the Lee being then gross settled
before the Cider had fermented so long as to be hard.

Or else, by some Accident they had not put it so soon into the Vessel, but
that in part it was settled before they put it up, and the grossest part of the
Lee left out of the Vessel.

Or else, the Bung being left open some part of the spirits evaporated; and
that made the fermentation the weaker, and to last the less time.

Or else, they put it up in such a season that the weather continued cold and
frosty till the fermentation was quite over; and then it having wrought the
less time, and with the less violence, it remained more pleasant and rich than
otherwise it would have done.

Now for the time of making Pepin-cider, I choose to do it in the beginning of
November, after the Apples had been gathered and laid about three weeks or more
in the loft, that so the Apples might have had a little time to sweat in the
house before the Cider was made, but not too much; for if they be not full ripe
before they be gathered, and not suffered to lie a while in the heap, the Cider
will not be so pleasant; and if they be too ripe when they are gathered, or lie
too long in the heap, it will be very difficult to separate the Cider from the
gross Lee before the fermentation begins: and in that case it will work so
long, that when it fines the Cider will be hard; for when the Apples are too
mellow, they break into so small particles, that it will be long before the Lee
settles by its weight only: and then the fermentation may begin before it be
separated, and so destroy your intention of taking away the gross Lee. And if
the Apples be not mellow enough, the Cider will not be so pleasant as it ought
to be.

This being said for the time of making the Pepin-Cider, may (mutatis mutandis)
serve for all other sorts of Summer-fruit; as the Kentish codling, Marigolds,
Gilly-flowers, Summer-pearmains, Summer-pepins, Holland-pepins, Golden-pepins,
and even Winter-pearmains. For though they must not be made at the same time of
the year, yet they must be made at the time when each respective fruit is in
the same condition that I before directed that the Winter-pepin should be. Nay,
even in the making of that Cider, you are not tied to that time of the year to
make your Cider; but as the condition of that particular year has been, you
may make your Cider one, two, three or four weeks later; but it will be very
seldom that you shall need to begin to make Kentish-pepin-Cider before the
beginning of November, even in the most Southern parts of England.

The next thing I shall mention, is, the ordering of your bottles after they
are filled; for in that consists no small part of causing your Cider to be in a
just condition to drink: For, if it does ferment too much in the bottle, it
will not be so convenient to drink, neither for the taste, nor wholsomness; and
if it ferment not at all, it will want that little fret which makes it grateful
to most Palates. In order to this, you must observe, first, whether the Cider
were bottled too early, or too late, or in the just time: If too early, and
that it has too much of the flying Lee in it, then you must keep it as cool as
you can, that it may not work too much, and if so little that you doubt it will
not work at all, or too little; you must by keeping it from the inconvenience
of the external air, endeavor to hasten and increase the fermentation. And
this I do, by setting it in sand to cool, and by covering the bottles very well
with straw, when I would hasten or increase the fermentation.

And if I find the Cider to have been bottled in its just time, then I use
neither, in ordinary weather; but content my self that it stands in a close and
cool Cellar, either upon the ground, or upon shelves; saving in the time that I
apprehend frost, I cover it with straw, which I take off as soon as the weather
changes; and consequently about the time that the cold East winds cease; which
usually with us, is in the beginning of April; I set my bottles into sand up to
the necks. And by this means I have kept Pepin-cider without change till
September, and might have kept it longer, if my store had been greater: For by
that time the heats were totally over, and consequently, the cause of the turn
of Cider.

Having now declared what is (according to my opinion) to be done to preserve
Cider, if not in it is original sweetness, yet to let it lose as little as is
possible; I shall now fall upon my fifth Assertion, which is, that it is
probable that somewhat like the former Method may in some degree mend
Hard-Apple-cider, Perry, or a drink made of the mixtures of Apples and Pears;
and not impossible that somewhat of the same nature may do good to French-wines
also.

First, for French-wines, I think what I have in the beginning of this
discourse declared, as the hint which first put me upon the conceit, that the
over- fermenting of Cider was the cause that it lost of its original sweetness
( viz. the making of three sorts of Wine, of one sort of Grapes) is a testimony
that the first sort of Wine has but little of the gross Lee, and consequently,
ferments but little, nor loses but little of the original sweetness; which
makes it evident that the same thing will hold in Wine, which does in Cider;
but the great difficulty is (if I be rightly informed) that they use to let the
Wine begin to ferment in the Vat before they put it into the Hogsheads or other
Vessels; and thus they do, that the Husks and other Filth (which in the way
they use, must necessarily be mingled with the Wine) may rise in a skum at the
top, and so be taken off: Now if they please, as soon as it is pressed, to pass
the Wine through a strainer, without expecting any such purgation, and then use
the same Method formerly prescribed for Cider, I do not doubt but the gross
part of the Lee of Wines, being thus taken away, there will yet be enough left
to give it a fermentation in the bottles, or second vessel, where it shall be
left to stand, in case you have not bottles enough to put up all the Wine from
which you have thus taken away the gross Lee.

This Wine I know not whether it will last so long as the other used in the
ordinary way, or not; but this I confidently believe, it will not be so harsh
as the same would have been if it had been used in the ordinary way; and the
pleasantness of Taste, which is not unwholesome, is the chief thing which I
prefer both in Wine and Cider.

Now for the Hard-apple-Cider, that it will receive an improvement by this way
of ordering, has been long my opinion; but this year an accident happened,
which made it evident that I was not mistaken in this conjecture. For there was
a Gentleman of Herefordshire, this last Autumn, that by accident had not
provided Cask enough for the Cider he had made; and having six or seven
Hogsheads of Cider for which he had no Cask, he sent to Worcester, Gloucester,
and even to Bristol, to buy some, but all in vain; and when his servants
returned, the Cider that wanted Cask had been some five days in the Vat
uncovered; and the Gentleman being then dispatching a Barque for London with
Cider, and having near hand a convenience of getting Glass-bottles, resolved to
put some of it into bottles; did so, and filled seven or eight Hampers with the
clearest of this Cider in the Vat, which had then never wrought, nor been put
into any other Vessel but the Vat; the Barque in which his Cider came had a
tedious passage; that is, it was at least seven weeks before it came to London,
and in that time most of his Cider in Cask had wrought so much that it was much
harder than it would have been if it had according to the ordinary way lain
still in the Country, in the place where it was first made and put up, and
consequently, wrought but once.

But the other, which was in Bottles, and escaped the breaking, that is, by
accident, had less of the Lee in it than other bottles had, or was not so hard
stopped, but either before there was force enough from the fermentation to
break the bottle, or that the Cork gave way a little, and so the air got out;
or that the Bottles were not originally well corked, was excellent good, beyond
any Cider that I had tasted out of Herefordshire; so that from this Experience
I dare confidently say, that the using Hard-apple-cider after the former
Method, prescribed for Pepin-cider, will make it retain a considerable part of
sweetness more than it can do after the Method used hitherto in Herefordshire.
Nor do I doubt but my Method will in a degree have the same effect in Perry,
and the drink (as yet without a name that I do know of) which is made of the
Juice of Wardens, Pears, and Apples, by several persons, in several
proportions; for the Reason being the same, I have no cause to doubt, but the
effect will follow, as well in those Drinks, as in Cider and Wines.

I am now come to my last Assertion; that Cider thus used cannot be unwholesom,
but may be done to what degree any man's Palate desires.

First, It cannot be unwholesome, upon the same measure that stummed Wine is
so; for that unwholesomness is by leaving the cause of fermentation in the
Wine, and not suffering it to produce its effect before the Wine be drank, and
it ferments in man's body: and not only so, but sets other humors in the body
into fermentation; and this prejudiceth their health that drink such Wines.

Now though Cider used in my method should not ferment at all, till it come
into the bottle, and then but a little; yet the cause of fermentation being in
a great degree taken away, the rest can do no considerable harm to those which
drink it, being in it self but little, and having wrought in the bottle before
men drink it; nor indeed do I think, nor ever find, that it did any
inconvenience to my self, or any person that drank it when it was thus used.

Secondly, because the difference of men's palates and constitutions is very
great; and that accordingly men like or dislike drink that has more or less of
the fret in it; and that the consequences in point of health are very
different, in the method by me formerly prescribed: it is in your power to give
the Cider just as much fret as you please, and no more; and that by several
ways: for either you may bottle it sooner or later, as you please: or you may
bottle it from two Taps in your Vessel, and that from the higher Tap will have
less fret, and the lower more: or you may bottle your Cider all from one Tap,
and open some of the bottles about a week after for a few minutes, and then
stop them up again; and that which was thus stopped will have the less fret: or,
if your Cider be bottled all from one Tap, if you will (even without opening
the bottles) you may make some difference, though not so considerable as either
of the former ways, by keeping part of the bottles warmer, for the first two
Months, than the rest; for that which is kept warmest will have the most fret.

Sir PAVL NEILE'S second Paper.
My Lord,
THe Paper which by the Command of the Royal Society I delivered in the last
year, concerning the ordering of Cider, I have by this years experience found
defective in one particular, of which I think fit by this to give you notice,
which is thus: Whereas in the former Paper I mention, that after the
Pepin-Cider has stood 24 hours in the Vat, it might be drawn off into Pails,
and so put into the Vessel; and that having stood a second 24 hours in that
Vessel, it might be drawn into another Vessel, in which it might stand till it
were fit to Bottle; for the particulars of all which proceeding I refer to the
former Paper; and shall now only mention, That this last year we were fain to
draw it off into several Vessels, not only as is there directed, twice, but
most of our Cider five, and some six times; and not only so, but we were after
all this fain to precipitate the Lee by some of those ways mentioned by Dr.
Willis in the 7th Chap. of his Treatise De fermentatione. Now though this be
more of trouble than the Method by me formerly mentioned; yet it does not in
the least destroy that Hypothesis which in the former Discourse I laid down,
(viz.) That it was the leaving too much of the Lee with the Cider, which upon
the change of air, set it into a new fermentation, and consequently made it
lose the sweetness; for this change by the indisposition of the Lee to settle
this year more than others, has not hindered the goodness of the Cider; but
that when it was at last mastered, and the Cider bottled in a fit temper, it
was never more pleasant and quick than this year: but I find that this year our
Cider of Summer-Apples is already turned sour, although it be now but the
first of January; and the last year it kept very well till the beginning of
March; which makes me fear that our Pepin-Cider will not keep till this time
twelve-moneth, as our Pepin-Cider of the last year does till this day, and
still retains its original pleasantness without the least turn toward
sowreness.

And I am very confident, the difference of time and trouble, which this year
we found in getting the Cider to fine and be in a condition to Bottle, was only
the effect of a very bad and wet Summer, which made the Fruit not ripen kindly;
and to make it yet worse, we had just at the time when we made our Cider, this
year, extreme wet and windy weather, which (added to the unkindliness of the
Fruit) was the whole cause of this alteration: And however my Hypothesis as yet
remains firm, for if by taking any part of the Lee from the Cider you can
preserve it in its original sweetness, it is not at all material whether it be
always to be done by twice drawing off from the Lee, or that it must sometimes
be done with more trouble, and by oftener repeating the same Work, so that
finally it be done, and by the same means, that is, by taking away part of the
Lee, which otherwise would have caused too much fermentation; and consequently
have made the Cider lose part of its original sweetness.

My Lord, I should not have presumed to have given you and the Society the
trouble of perusing this Paper, but that, if possible, I would have you see,
that what I think an error in any opinion that I have held, I am willing to
own; and yet I desire not that you should think my mistake greater than in
Reality it is.

OBSERVATIONS Concerning the Making, and Preserving OF CIDER: BY JOHN NEWBVRGH
Esquire
1.
IF the Apples are made up immediately from the Tree, they are observed to
yield more, but not so good Cider, as when hoarded the space of a Month or six
weeks; and if they contract any unpleasing taste (as sometimes it is confessed
they do) it may be imputed to the Room they lie in, which if it has any thing
in it, of either too sweet or unsavory smell, the Apples (as things most
susceptible of impression) will be easily tainted thereby.

One of my acquaintance, when a child, hoarding Apples in a Box where
Rose-Cakes and other sweets were their companions, found them of so unsavory
taste, and of so rank a relish derived from the too near neighborhood of the
Perfumes, that even a childish palate (which seldom mislikes any thing that
looks like an Apple) could not dispense with it.

2.
It is therefore observed by prudent Fruiterers, to lay their Apples upon clean
new made Reed, till they grind them for Cider, or otherwise make use of them.
And if, notwithstanding this caution, they contract any rottenness before they
come to the Cider-press, the damage will not be great, if care be had before
the Apples be ground, to pick out the finnewed and the black-rotten; the rest,
though somewhat of putrefaction has passed upon them, will not render the
Cider ill conditioned, either in respect of taste, or duration.

A Friend of mine having made provision of Apples for Cider, whereof so great a
part were found rotten when the time of grinding them came, that they did, as
'twere wash the Room with their Juice, through which they were carried to the
Wring, had Cider from them not only passable, but exceeding good; though not
without previous use of the pre-mention'd Caution. I am also assured by a
Neighbor of mine, That a Brother of his who is a great Cider-Merchant in
Devonshire, is by frequent experience so well satisfied of the harmlesness of
Rotten-Apples, that he makes no scruple of exchanging with any one that comes
to his Cider-press, a Bushel of sound-Apples for the same measure of the other.
Herein, I suppose, (if in other respects they be not prejudicial) he may be a
gainer by the near compression of the tainted Fruit, which, as we speak in our
Country Phrase, will go nearer together than the other. His advantage may be
the greater, if the conceit which goes current with them be not a bottomless
fancy, That a convenient quantity of rotten-Apples mixed with the sound, is
greatly assistant to the work of fermentation, and notably helps to clarify
the Cider.

3.
It matters not much whether the Cider be forced to purge it self by working
downwards in the Barrel, or upwards at the usual Vent, so there be matter
sufficient left on the top for a thick skin or film, which will sometimes be
drawn over it when it works, after the usual manner, as when it is presently
stopped up with space left for fermentation, to be performed altogether within
the Vessel.

The thick skin, or Leathern-coat, the Cider oftentimes contracts, as well
after it has purged it self after the usual manner, as otherwise, is held the
surest preservation of its spirits, and the best security against other
inconveniences incident to this, and other like vinous Liquors, of which the
Devonshire Cider-Merchants are so sensible, that, beside the particular care
they take, that matter be not wanting for the Contexture of this upper garment
by stopping up the Vessel as soon as they have filled it; (with the allowance
of a Gallon or two upon the score of Fermentation) they cast in Wheaten Bran,
or Dust, to thicken the Coat, and render it more certainly Air-proof. And I
think you will believe their care in this kind not impertinent, if you can
believe a story which I have to tell of its mavelous efficacy: A near
neighbor of mine assures me, that his Wife having this year filled a Barrel
with Mead, being strong, it wrought so boistrously in the Vessel, that the good
Woman casting her eye that way, accidentally, found it leaking at every chink,
which ascribing to the strength of the Liquor, she thought immediately by
giving it vent, to save both the Liquor and the Vessel, but in vain; both the
Stopples being pulled out, the leakage still continued, and the Vessel not at
all relieved, till casually at length putting in her finger at the top, she
brake the premention'd film; which done, a good part of the Mead immediately
flying out, left the residue in peace, and the leakage ceased. It may seem
incredible that so thin a skin should be more coercive to a mutinous Liquor,
than a Barrel with Oaken-Ribs, and stubborn Hoops: But I am so well assured of
the veritableness of my Neighbors Relation, that I dare not question it: The
reason of it let wiser men determine.

4.
If the Apples be abortive, having been (as it usually happens) shaken down
before the time by a violent Wind, it is observed to be so indispensably
necessary that they lie together in hoard, at least till the usual time of
their maturity, that the Cider otherwise is seldom, or never found worth the
drinking.

A Neighbor told me, That making a quantity of Cider with Wind-falls which he
let ripen in the Hoard, near a month interceding between the time of their
decussion, and that which Nature intended for their maturity; his Cider proved
very good, when all his Neighbors who made up their untimely fruit as soon as
it fell, had a crude, austere, indigested Liquor, not worth the name of Cider.

5.
No Liquor is observed to be more easily affected with the savor of the Vessel
it is put into, than Cider; therefore singular care is taken by discreet
Cider-Masters, That the Vessel be not only tasteless, but also well prepared
for the Liquor they intend to fill it with. If it be a new Cask, they prepare
it by scalding it with Water, wherein a good quantity of Apple-pomice has been
boiled: if a tainted Cask, they have diverse ways of cleansing it. Some boil an
Ounce of Pepper in so much Water as will fill an Hogshead, which they let stand
in a Vessel of that capacity two or three days, and then wash it with a
convenient quantity of fresh Water scalding hot, which they say is an undoubted
cure for the most dangerously infected Vessel. A Friend and Neighbor of mine
herewith cured a Vessel of so extreme ill savor, as it was thought it would
little less than poison any Liquor that was put into it. Others have a more
easy, and perhaps no less effectual Remedy. They take two or three stones of
Quicklime, which in six or seven Gallons of Water they set on work in the
Hogshead being close stopped, and tumbling it up and down till the commotion
cease, it does the feat. Of Vessels that have been formerly used, next to that
which has been already acquainted with Cider, a White Wind, or Vinegar Cask is
esteemed the best; Claret or Sack not so good. A Barrel newly tenanted by small
Beer suits better with Cider than a strong- Beer Vessel.

6.
Half a peck of unground Wheat put to Cider that is harsh and eager, will renew
its fermentation, and render it more mild and gentle. Sometimes it happens
without the use of any such means to change with the season, and becomes of
sharp and sour unexpectedly benign and pleasant. Two or three Eggs whole put
into an Hogshead of Cider that is become sharp and near of kin to Vinegar,
sometimes rarely lenifies and gentilizes it. One pound of broad-figs slit, is
said to dulcifie an Hogshead of such Cider.

A Neighbor Divine, of my acquaintance, assured me, That coming into a
Parsonage-house in Devonshire, where he found eleven Hogsheads of Cider; being
unwilling to sell what he never bought, he was three years in spending that
store which the former Incumbent had left him; and it greatly amused him (as
well it might, if he remembered the old Proverb, He mends as sour Ale in
Summer) to find the same Cider, which in Winter was almost as sharp as Vinegar,
in the Summer become a potable and good-natured Liquor.

7.
A little quantity of Mustard will clear an Hogshead of muddy Cider. The same
Virtue is ascribed to two or three rotten Apples put into it. Mustard made with
Sack preserves boild Cider, and spirits it egregiously.

8.
Cider is found to ferment much better in mild and moist, than in cold and dry
weather. Every ones Experience has taught him so much in the late frosty
season. If it had not wrought before, it was in vain to expect its working or
clearing then, unless by some of the artificial means premention'd, which also
could not be made use of in a more inconvenient time.

9.
The latter running of the Cider bottled immediately from the Wring, is by some
esteemed a pure, clear, small, well relisht Liquor; but so much undervalued by
them who desire strong drinks more than wholesome, that they will not suffer it
to incorporate with the first running.

In Devonshire where their Wrings are so hugely great, that an Hogshead or two
runs out commonly before the Apples suffer any considerable pressure, they
value this before the other, much after the rate which we set upon life-honey
(that which in like sort drops freely out of the Combs) above that which
renders not it self without compression. In Jersey they value it a Crown upon
an Hogshead dearer than the other: (This I take from the Relation of one of my
Neighbors, who sometimes lived in that Island, which for Apples and Cider is
one of the most famous of all belonging to his Majesty's Dominions) Yet even
upon this, and their choicest Ciders, they commonly bestow a pail of water to
every Hogshead, being so far (it seems) of Pindar's mind, that they fear not
any prejudice to their most excellent Liquors by a dash of that most excellent
Element: Insomuch that it goes for a common saying amongst them, That if any
Cider can be found in their Island, which can be proved to have no mixture of
Water, it is clearly forfeited. It seems they are strongly conceited, that this
addition of the most useful Element, does greatly meliorate their Cider, both
in respect of Color, Taste, and Clarity.

10.
The best Cider-fruit with us in this part of Dorsetshire (lying near
Bred-port) next to Pepin and Pearmain, is a Bitter-sweet, or (as we vulgarly
call them) Bitter-scale, of which for the first, the Cider unboil'd keeps well
for one year; boiling it you may keep it two years or longer.

About seven years since I gave my self the Experience of Bitter-scale Cider
both crude and boiled. I called them both to account at twelve Months end. I
then found the crude Cider seemingly as good, if not better, than the boiled.
But, having stopped up the boiled, I took it to task again about ten Months
after. At which time, I found it so excessively strong, that five persons would
hardly venture upon an ordinary Glass full of it. My friends would hardly
believe but I had heightened it with some of my Chemical Spirits. The truth is,
I do not remember that I ever drunk any Liquor, on this side Spirits, so highly
strong, and spirituous; but wanting pleasantness answerable to its strength, I
was not very fond of my Experiment. In which I boiled away, as I remember, more
than half.

11.
A Neighbor having a good Provent of pure-Lings (an Apple of choice account
with us) making up a good part of them to Cider, expected rare Liquor, but it
proved very mean and pitiful Cider, as generally we find that to be, which is
made without mixture. We have few Apples with us, beside the Bitter-scale,
which yield good Cider alone; next to it is a Deans-Apple, and the Peleasantine
I think may be mentioned in the third place; neither of which need the Addition
of other Apples to set off the Relish, as do the rest of our choicest Fruits.
Pepins, Pearmains, and Gilliflours commixt, are said to make the best Cider in
the world. In Jersey it is a general observation, as I hear, That the more of
red any Apple has in its rind, the more proper it is for this use.
Paleface't-Apples they exclude as much as may be from their Cider-Vat. It Is
with us an observation, That no sweet-Apple that has a tough rind, is bad for
Cider.

12.
If you boil your Cider, special care is to be had, That you put it into the
furnace immediately from the Wring; otherwise, if it be let stand i^ Vats or
Vessels two or three days after the pressure, the best, and most spirituous
part will ascend, and vapor away when the fire is put under it; and the longer
the boiling continues, the less of goodness, or virtue will be left remaining
in the Cider.

My Distillations sufficiently instruct me, That the same Liquor which (after
fermentation has passed upon it) yields a plentiful quantity of spirit, drawn
off unfermented, yields nothing at all of spirit. And upon the same account it
is undoubtedly certain, That Cider boiled immediately from the Wring, has its
spirits comprest, and drawn into a narrower compass, which are for the most
part washed and evaporated by late unseasonable boiling.

CONCERNING CIDER,
By Doctor SMITH.
THE best time to grind the Apples is immediately from the Tree, so soon as
they are thoroughly ripe: for, so they will yield the greater quantity of
Liquor, the Cider will drink the better, and last longer than if the Apples
were hoarded: For Cider made of hoarded Apples will always retain an unpleasing
taste of the Apples, especially if they contract any rottenness.

The Cider that is ground in a Stone-case is generally accused to taste
unpleasantly of the Rinds, Stems, and Kernels of the Apples; which it will not
if ground in a Case of Wood, which does not bruise them so much.

So soon as the Cider is made, put it into the Vessel (leaving it about the
space of one Gallon empty) and presently stop it up very close: This way is
observed to keep it longer, and to preserve its spirits better than the usual
way of filling the Vessel quite full, and keeping it open till it has done
fermenting.

Cider put into a new Vessel will often taste of the Wood, if it be pierced
early; but the same stopped up again, and reserved till the latter end of the
year, will free it self of that taste.

If the Cider be sharp and thick it will recover it self again: But if sharp
and clear, it will not.

About March (or when the Cider begins to sparkle in the glass) before it be
too fine, is the best time to bottle it.

Cider will be much longer in clearing in a mild and moist, then in a cold and
dry Winter.

To every Hogshead of Cider, designed for two years keeping, it is requisite to
add (about March, the first year) a quart of Wheat unground.

The best Fruit (with us in Gloucestershire) for the first years Cider, are the
Red-strake; the White and Red Must-apple, the sweet and sour Pepin, and the
Harvey-apple.

Pearmains alone make but a small liquor, and hardly clearing of it self; but,
mixed either with sweet or sour Pepins, it becomes very brisk and clear.

Must-apple-cider (though the first made) is always the last ripe; by reason
that most of the pulp of the Apple passes the strainer in pressing, and makes
it exceeding thick.

The Cider of the Bromsbury-Crab, and Fox-whelp, is not fit for drinking, till
the second year, but then very good.

The Cider of the Bromsbury-Crab yields a far greater proportion of spirits, in
the distillation, than any of the others.

Crabs and Pears mixed make a very pleasing Liquor, and much sooner ripe than
Pears alone.

OF CIDER.
By Capt. SYLAS TAILOR.
HErefordshire affords several sorts of Cider-apples, as the two sorts of Red
strakes, the Gennet-moyle, the Summer-violet, or Fillet, and the Winter-fillet;
with many other sorts which are used only to make Cider. Of which some use each
sort simply; and others mix many sorts together. This County is very well
stored with other sorts of Apples; as Pepins, Pearmains, etc. of which there is
much Cider made, but not to be compared to the Cider drawn from the
Cider-apples; among which the Red-strakes bear the Bell; a Fruit in it self
scarce edible; yet the juice being pressed out is immediately pleasant in
taste, without any thing of that restringency which it had when incorporated
with the meat, or flesh of the Apple. It is many times three Months before it
comes to its clearness, and six Months before it comes to a ripeness fit for
drinking; yet I have tasted of it three years old, very pleasant, though
dangerously strong. The color of it, when fine, is of a sparkling yellow, like
Canary, of a good full body, and oily: The taste, like the Flavor or perfume
of excellent Peaches, very grateful to the Palate and Stomach.

Gennet-moyles make a Cider of a smaller body than the former, yet very
pleasant, and will last a year. It is a good eating pleasant sharp fruit, when
ripe, and the best Tart-apple (as the Red-strake also) before its ripeness. The
Tree grows with certain knotty extuberancies upon the branches and boughs;
below which knot we cut off boughs the thickness of a man's wrist, and place the
knot in the ground, which makes the root; and this is done to raise this fruit;
but very rarely by graffing.

Of Fillets of both sorts ( viz. Summer and Winter) I have made Cider of that
proportionate taste and strength, that I have d^ceived several experienced
Palates, with whom (simply) it has passed for White Wind; and dashing it with
Red-Wine, it has passed for Claret; and mingled with the Syrup of Rasp'yes it
makes an excellent woman's wine: The fruit is not so good as the Gennet-moyle to
eat: The Winter-fillet makes a lasting Cider, and the Summer-fillet an early
Cider, but both very strong; and the Apples mixed together make a good Cider.

These Apples yield a liquor more grateful to my Palate (and so esteemed of in
Herefordshire by the greater Ciderists) than any made of Pepins and Pearmains,
of which sorts we have very good in that Country; and those also both Summer
and Winter of both sorts, and of which I have drank the Cider; but prefer the
other.

Grounds separated only with a Hedge and Ditch, by reason of the difference of
Soils have given a great alteration to the Cider, notwithstanding the Trees
have been graffed with equal care, the same Graffs, and lastly, the same care
taken in the making of the Cider. This as to the Red-strake; I have not
observed the same niceness in any other fruit; for Gennet-moyles, and Fillets
thrive very well over all Herefordshire. The Red-strake delights most in a fat
soil: Hamlacy is a rich intermixed soil of Red-fat-clay and Sand; and
Kings-capel a low hot sandy ground, both well defended from noxious Winds, and
both very famous for the Red-strake-cider.

There is a Pear in Hereford and Worcester-shires, which is called
Bareland-pear, which makes a very good Cider. I call it Cider (and not Perry)
because it has all the properties of Cider. I have drank of it from half a
year old to two years old. It keeps it self without Roping (to which Perry is
generally inclined) and from its taste: Dr. Beal, in his little Treatise called
the Herefordshire-Orchard, calls it deservingly a Masculine Drink; because in
taste not like the sweet luscious feminine juice of Pears. This Tree thrives
very well in barren ground, and is a fruit (with the Red-strake) of which Swine
will not eat; therefore fittest to be planted in Hedge-rows.

Red strakes and other Cider-apples when ripe (which you may know partly by the
blackness of the Kernel's, and partly by the color and smell of the fruit)
ought to be gathered in Baskets or Bags, preserved from bruising, and laid up
in heaps in the Orchard to sweat; covered every night from the dew: Or else, in
a Barnfloor (or the like) with some Wheat or Rye-straw under them, being kept
so long till you find, by their mellowing, they are fit for the Mill.

They that grind, or bruise their Apples presently upon their gathering,
receive so much liquor from them, that between twenty or twenty two Bushels
will make a Hogshead of Cider: but this Cider will neither keep so well, nor
drink with such a fragrancy as is desired and endeavored.

They that keep them a month or six weeks hoarded, allow about thirty bushels
to the making of a Hogshead; but this has also an inconvenience; in that the
Cider becomes not fine, or fit for drinking, so conveniently as a mean betwixt
these two will afford.

Keep them then about a fort-night in a hoard, and order them to be of such a
cast by this Mellowing, that about twenty five Bushels may make a Hogshead,
after which mellowing proceed thus.

1. Pick and clear your Apples from their stalks, leaves, moaziness, or any
thing that tends toward rottenness or decay.

2. Lay them before the stone in the Cider-Mill, or else beat them small with
Beaters (such as Paviers use to fix their pitching) in deep troughs of Wood or
Stone, till they are fit for the Press.

3. Having laid clean wheat-straw in the bottom of your Press, lay a heap of
bruised Apples upon it, and so with small handfuls or wisps of straw, which by
twisting takes along with it the ends of the straw laid first in the bottom,
proceed with the bruised Apples, and follow the heaps with your twisted straw,
till it comes to the height of two foot, or two foot and a half; and so with
some straw drawn in by twisting, and turned over the top of it (so that the
bruised Apples are set as it were into a deep Chees-vat of straw, from which
the Country people call it their Cider-Cheese) let the board fall upon it even
and flat, and so engage the force of your skrew or Press so long as any Liquor
will run from it. Instead of this Cheese others use baggs of Hair-cloth.

4. Take this Liquor thus forced by the Press, and strain it through a strainer
of hair into a Vat, from whence straight (or that day) in pails carry it to the
Cellar, tunning it up presently in such Vessels as you intend to preserve it
in; for I cannot approve of a long evaporation of spirits, and then a
disturbance after it settles.

5. Let your Vessels be very tight and clean wherein you put your Cider to
settle: The best form is the Stund or Stand, which is set upon the lesser end,
from the top tapering downwards; as suppose the head to be thirty inches
diametre, let the the bottom be but eighteen or twenty inches in diametre; let
the Tun-hole or Bung-hole be on the one side outward, toward the top. The
reason of the goodness of this form of Vessel is, because Cider (as all strong
Liquors) after fermentation and working, contracts a cream or skin on the top
of them, which in this form of Vessel is as it sinks contracted, and fortified
by that contraction, and will draw fresh to the last drop; whereas in our
ordinary Vessels, when drawn out about the half or middle, this skin dilates
and breaks, and without a quick draught decays and dies.

6. Reserve a Pottle or Gallon of the Liquor to fill up the Vessel to the brim
of the Bung-hole, as often as the fermentation and working lessens the Liquor,
till it has done its work.

7. When it has completed its work, and that the Vessel is filled up to the
bung-hole, stop it up close with well mixed clay, and well tempered, with a
handful of Bay Salt laid upon the top of the clay, to keep it moist, and
renewed as often as need shall require; for if the clay grows dry it gives vent
to the spirits of the Liquor, by which it suffers decay.

I am against either the boiling of Cider, or the hanging of a bag of Spices in
it, or the use of Ginger in drinking it; by which things people labor to
correct that windiness which they fancy to be in it: I think Cider not windy;
those that use to drink it are most free from windiness; perhaps the virtue of
it is such, as that once ripened and mellowed, the drinking of it in such
strength combats with that wind which lies insensibly latent in the body. The
Cider made and sold here in London in Bottles may have that windiness with it
as Bottle-beer has, because they were never suffered to ferment: But those
that have remarked the strength and vigor of its fermentation, what weighty
things it will cast up from the bottom to the top, and with how many bubbles
and bladders of wind it does work, will believe that it clears it self by that
operation of all such injurious qualities.

To preserve Cider in Bottles I recommend unto you my own Experience, which is,
Not to bottle it up before fermentation; for that incorporates the windy
quality, which otherwise would be ejected by that operation: This violent
suppression of fermentation makes it windy in drinking, (though I confess brisk
to the taste, and sprightly cutting to the Palate:) But after fermentation, the
Cider resting two, three, or four Months, draw it, and bottle it up, and so lay
it in a Repository of cool springing water, two or three foot, or more, deep;
this keeps the spirits, and the best of the spirits of it together: This makes
it drink quick and lively; it comes into the glass not pale or troubled, but
bright yellow, with a speedy vanishing nittiness, (as the Vintners call it)
which evaporates with a sparkling and whizzing noise; And than this I never
tasted either Wine or Cider that pleased better: Insomuch that a Noble man
tasting of a Bottle out of the water (himself a great Ciderist) protested the
excellency of it, and made with much greater charges, at his own dwelling, a
water Repository for his Cider, with good success.

An ACCOUNT of Perry and Cider Out of GLOUCESTERSHIRE, Imparted by DANIEL
COLLWALL Esquire
ABout Taynton, Five Miles beyond Gloucester, is a mixed sort of land, partly
Clay, a Marle, and Crash, as they call it there, on all which sorts of land,
there is much Fruit growing, both for the Table and for Cider: But it is Pears
it most abounds in, of which the best sort, is that they name the Squash-Pear,
which makes the best Perry in those Parts. These Trees grow to be very large,
and exceeding fruitful, bearing a fair round Pear, red on the one side, and
yellow on the other, when fully ripe: It oftentimes falls from the Tree, which
commonly breaks it; but it is of a nature so harsh, that the Hogs will hardly
eat them.

They usually plant the stocks first, and when of competent bigness (and tall
enough to prevent Cattle) graff upon them: It Is observed, that where land is
Plowed and dressed for Corn, the Trees thrive much better than in the
Pasture-grounds, so as diverse Orchards are yearly plowed and sown with Corn,
which for the most part, they suffer their Swine to eat upon the ground,
without cutting; and such Plantations seldom or never fail of plentiful Crops,
especially in the Rye-land, or light Grounds.

About Michaelmas is made the best Cider, and that of such Fruit as drops from
the Trees, being perfectly mature; and if any are gathered sooner, they let
them lie in the house 8 or 9 days for the better mellowing.

The best Mills to grind in, are those of Stone, which resembles a Mill stone
set edge-ways, moved round the Trough by an Horse till the Fruit be bruised
small enough for the Press: This done, then put it up into a Crib made with
strong studds, and Oken or Haisel twigs about 3 foot high, and 2 wide, which is
placed on a Stone or Wooden Cheese-fat, a foot broader than the Crib, fitted to
a round Trough for the Liquor to pass into the Cistern which is a large Vessel:
When the Crib is filled with the foresaid ground Fruit, they put a Stone upon
it, but first they fit a Circle of fresh straw about the Crib, to preserve the
Must (which is the bruised Fruit) from straining through the Crib when they
apply the Skrews, which being two in number, and of a good size, turn in a
great beam, and so are wrung down upon the Crib, within which they place two
wide and thick Cheese-fats, and several blocks upon the Fruit, to crush it down
with the more force, by which means it is wrung so dry, as nothing can be had
more out of it. A Crib will contain at once, as much ground Fruit, as will make
above an Hogs-head of Cider, and there may be dispatched six or seven such
Vessels in one day.

When the Pressing is finished, they take out the Fruit, and put it into a
great Fat, pouring several Payls of Water to it, which being well impregn'd, is
ground again slightly in the Mill, to make an ordinary Cider for the servants;
this they usually drink all the Year about.

When the best Liquor is ^un'd up, they commonly leave the Bung-hole open, for
nine or ten days, to ferment and purify; for though in most places they add
straining to all this, yet some of the Husks and Ordure will remain in it. The
Vessel after a day or two standing, is filled up, and still as the Cider wastes
in working, they supply it again, till no more filth rises; and then stop it
up very accurately close, leaving only a small breathing hole to give it air
for a Month after, and to prevent the bursting of the Vessel.

Note, That they sometimes put Pears, and of Apples.

The usual Names of Gloucestershire Cider-Fruit.
Red-streaks, growing chiefly in the Rye-Lands, sweet White-Musts, Red-Must,
the Winter-Must, the Streak-Must, the Gennet-Moyl, the Woodcock-Apple, the
Bromsgrove-Crab, the Great-white-Crab, the Heming, and diverse other sorts, but
these are the principal.

The Pears for Perry are,
The Red Squash-pear esteemed the best, the John-pear, the Harpary Green-pear,
the Drake-pear, the Green Squash-pear, the Mary-pear, the Lullam-pear: these
are the chief.

Another Account of CIDER from a Person of great Experience.
CIder-Apples for strength, and a long lasting Drink, is best made of the
Fox-Whelp of the Forest of Deane, but which comes not to be drunk till two or
three years old.

2. Bromsborrow-Crab the second year; In the Coast and Tract 'twixt Hereford
and Ledbury.

3. Vnder-leaf, best at two years, a very plentiful bearer has a Rhenish-wine
flavor; the very best of all Ciders of this kind, hoarded a little within
doors. The longer you would keep, the longer you must hoard your Fruit.

4. The Red-strake of Kings-Capel, and those parts, is in great variety: Some
make Cider that is not of continuance, yet pleasant and good; others, that
lasts long, inclining toward the Bromsborrow-Crab rather than a Red-strake.

5. A long pale Apple, called the Coleing, about Ludlow, an extraordinary
bearer.

6. The Arier-Apple, a constant bearer, making a strong and lasting Cider; some
^all them Richards, some Grang-apples; and indeed (...) ^e so (...) Drink, that
they are worthy to be reco^ (...).

(...) ^live^ ^nk^own about Ludlow, may, I conceive be ac^ (...) the
^int^^-Cider Apples, of which it is the constant re^ (...) an Hogs-head of the
Fruit will yield an Hogs-head of ^ider.

The Summer-Ciders are,
1. The Gennet-Moyl of one year: The best Baking-Apple that grows, and keeps
long baked; but not so unbaked without growing mealy: it drys well in the Oven,
and with little trouble. The Gennet-Moyl Cider, when the Fruit is well hoarded
and mellow, will body, and keep better.

2. The Summer Red-strake, of a wonderful fragrant and Aromatique quality.

3. Sir Ed. Harley's little Apple, esteemed to make one of the richest Ciders
in the World. Also, his,

4. Great Summer-Apple, resembling the Red-strake, juicy and Aromatique.

5. The White-Must, streaked Must, etc. great bearers, and their Cider early
ripe.

6. Pearmains, have made excellent Cider, as good, if not superior to any other
in some years; and though it be true, that every sort of Fruit makes better
Drink some years than others; yet, for the most part, the goodness and
perfection of Cider results from the lucky, or intelligent Gathering, or
Hoarding of the Fruit, or from both; and this knowledge must be from Experience.

7. Generally, the Cider longest in fining, is strongest and best lasting,
especially if the fruit have been well hoarded for some time.

8. Cider made of Green, and immature Fruit, will not fine kindly, and when it
does, it abides not long good, but suddenly becomes ^agre.

9. Cider kept in very cool Cellars, if made of ripe Fruit, renders it long in
fining, and sometimes Cider by exposing abroad in the Sun, and kept Warm, has
sooner matur'd, and continued long good: But the best Drink is that which fines
of it self, preserved in an indifferent temper.

10. All Cider suffers Fermentation when Trees are blossoming, though it be
never so old; and Cider of very ripe Fruit, if Bottl'd in that season, will
acquire a fragrancy of the Blossom.

11. New Cider, and all diluted and watered Ciders, are great Enemies to the
Teeth, and cause violent pains in them, and Rheums in the Head.

12. One Rotten-Apple, of the same kind with the sound, corrupts a whole
Vessel, and makes it Musty. But,

To Conclude this Treatise,
We will gratify the Cider-Master with the Construction of a new kind of Press
brought into the R. Society, by their Curator, the ingenious Mr. Hook, and, if
perfectly understood by him that shall imitate it, recommended not only for its
extraordinary Dispatch, but for many other virtues of it, chiefly, the
accurately grinding of the Pulp, and keeping the Husks from descending with the
Liquor.
