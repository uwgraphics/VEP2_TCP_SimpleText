HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE

BY THE KING.
A Proclamation to give Assurance unto all His Majesty's Subjects in the
Islands and Continent of America, of His, Majesty's Royal Care over them, and
to preserve them in their due Obedience.
CHARLES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defendor of the Faith etc. Whereas We have seen a Paper, called an Ordinance of
the pretended Houses of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, ordered to be
Printed the second day of this instant November, Whereby Robert Earl of
Warwick is made Governor in chief, and Lord High Admiral of all those Islands
and other Plantations inhabited, Planted, or belonging to any of Our Subjects
within the Bounds, and upon the Coasts of America, and a Committee appointed to
be assisting unto him in the Government thereof: The intention of which
Ordinance cannot reasonably be conceived to be other, then to spread the
contagion of this horrid Rebellion, even unto those remoter parts, and that the
continuers thereof (foreseeing how little prosperous their wicked Designs are
likely to prove here in Our Realm of England) may provide for themselves a
place of Retreat and Security in those Western Countries; The consequences
whereof would be the disturbance of that quiet, which chose Our Subjects in
America do yet enjoy under Our Government, and instead of Peace, to introduce
amongst them the like Oppressions, Bloodshed, Rapine, Disorders and Confusion
in Church and State, as they have brought already into some parts of this Our
Kingdom, and would have gone farther on, if the Goodness of Almighty God,
giving strength to Our Forces, and success to Our Enterprises, had not given a
stop to their Malicious and Rebellious attempts. To prevent which
inconveniences from those Western parts, out of Our Royal care of Our good
Subjects there, We have thought good hereby to give timely notice unto them,
not only that the said Ordinance was made without Our Royal assent, and
therefore that it ought not to bind any of Our Subjects, but also that the said
Earl of Warwick: has been justly Proclaimed a Traitor by Us, and that he
still persists in his Treason and Rebellion against Us; and therefore We do
require and Command all Our Subjects whatsoever, That they do not give
obedience to the said Ordinance, nor unto him the said Earl, as their
Governor, or Admiral, nor to any other by pretense of any Authority from him,
or from any of the said Committee, but that they shall endeavor the
suppression of all such Rebellious Attempts, as they shall have means and
Opportunity to do it. And We do farther declare, That as We have given unto
all Our faithful Subjects in general all possible testimonies and assurances
of Our care of their welfare and happiness, in preservation of the true
Protestant Religion established by the Laws, the Liberty of their Persons, the
Propriety of their Goods, and the just Privileges of Parliaments, which We
have done by such Professions before Almighty God, and such Acts of Grace, as
have exceeded all the Precedents of former times: So shall Our Subjects in the
said Islands, and Continent of America in particular, find the constant fruits
and effects of Our gracious Government and Protection, and of those assurances,
in as full and ample measure as any other Our Subjects whatsoever. And
therefore We do strictly charge and Command all Governors and Magistrates, who
exercise any authority under Us in the said Islands and Plantations, That they
do not only publish unto Our good People there, these Our gracious intentions
toward them, but that they let them feel the benefit thereof, by due
administration of Justice amongst them, and by seasonable Provisions of all
things needful for their defense and prosperity. And We do in like manner
require all Our said Subjects, that they persist in their due Allegiance and
Obedience unto Us, whereto they are obliged by all Laws Divine and Humane; and
that they receive not any Governors nor Commanders, or obey any Ordinances
contrary to, or without Our Royal consent, but that they pursue and apprehend
them as Traitors to Our Royal Person and Dignity; and that as they tender
their duty to God, the avoiding of Our High Displeasure, and the preservation
of their own Peace and Happiness.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the Twenty fourth day of November, in the
Nineteenth year of Our Reign. 1643.
God save the King.
