The Caping Trade.
A New Song, much in Request.
To an Excellent New Tune.
[1]
COme all brave Boys of the Caping Trade,
This stately Vessel we will invade,
We Will pin her Cargo to her Load,
No quarters we will afford her;
But standing Stiff and Still good fate.
Although our Seas be sailed of late.
Come helm a Lee and low your Top,
For I Will lay my Life I Will board her.
[2]
The first Attempt may prove in vain,
Tho it be neither shame nor Stain;
The Brave may lose as well as gain.
We Will do it with Bravadoes,
We Will turn about and undertake
To board her under Quarter Deck,
With Blunderbosh and Ported-pike,
And with two hand Grenades.
[3]
I have been at the Caping-Trade,
And Foreign Blood I often have shed,
But it is true that of Old was said,
True Honor's got by Danger,
I Will Stay at Home put up my Pike,
No prizes move will to me Strike,
For a Stately Vessel's beat me back,
I Am sure's was in all England.
[4]
Declining Days comes on apace,
How dare I look mine Enemy in the face,
Since I came off with so great disgrace,
And all for lake of Powder.
My Ammunition's spent and gone,
A little Gun scarce half foot long,
Two little Balls not well worth one,
So I am no more for Boarding.
[5]
Cheer up anon you're mad to think,
That you are in danger for to sink,
But with broad side closs to her clink,
Deal Thumps and turn all over.
Your Blind may splite upon her Stern,
If you receive no greater harm,
A Cup of Brandy your Heart being warm,
Will soon that loss recover.
[6]
All you that Caping take in hand,
See that your Main Mast straight does stand,
Your Soldiers all at your Command
To fire at once make ready.
Stand to it then for evermore,
See that your Faults be never before,
Style first a Gun to the Cabin door,
Faint Heart never wan fair Lady.
FINIS.
