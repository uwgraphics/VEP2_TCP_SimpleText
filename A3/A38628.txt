Writings of the New Testament.

God is in the Midst of Her, Psalm. 46.5. The Third Edition.

LONDON, Printed for John Marshall, at the Bible in Grace Church Street. 1700.

TO THE READER.
YOUR Candor and Attention are desired in the reading the ensuing Pages, which
were written for the Satisfaction of Friends, and made Public some time since
at their Desire, without any Design of Reflecting upon the present State and
Constitution of Modern Churches: For the Author's Undertaking was purely to
give the World such a Draught of a particular Christian Church, as upon his
best Enquiry, appeared to be most conformable to the Model of the Apostolic
Times, when the Purity of the Christian Faith was yet untainted, and the
Shining Examples of a Holy Religious Life, rendered the Christian Religion the
most eligible Institution in the World.

And the Publisher is very much persuaded, that if the Frame, Government, and
Discipline of the Modern Societies of Christians, were more agreeable to the
Rules and Observations contained in this small Discourse, the Peace and
Happiness of the whole present Visible Church, would be very much secured and
promoted; which is earnestly desired, and the only thing proposed in the
Publication hereof by

AN ESSAY OF THE Form and Constitution Of a Particular Christian CHURCH.
A Man may be a Member of the Visible Church, and no Member of the Catholic
Church, John 17.12. Genesis 4.11, 1. Heb. 12.17. 2 Samuel 7.15.

A Man may be a Member of the Catholic Church, and no Member of the Visible
Church, 1 Kings 14.13. Rev. 18.4. Romans 11.4. 1 Kings 19.18.

The Catholic Church is the Company of the Elect, John 17.20. and it is
Invisible, Col. 1.20.

The Visible Church is a Society of Saints in Visible Communion, Matthew. 18.12.
Act. 2.41, 42, 46. and 1.15. and 19.7. 1 Cor. 1.2. Phil. 1.2. all which are to
be accounted Faithful and Elect, Ephesians. 1.2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 14. till they by
obstinacy in Sin and Apostasy declare the contrary, 1 John 2.19. 2 Timothy 4.10.
and 1 Timothy 1.19, 20. 2 These. 3.14, 15. 2 Timothy 2.17, 18, 21.

It is one thing to be a Saint, another thing to be of the Visible Communion of
Saints, 1 Kings 14.13. compared with 2 Chronicles. 13.8, 12.

The Communion of Saints, is either Invisible or Visible, Ephesians. 3.17. Matthew.
18.10. Heb. 1.14. 1 Cor. 3.13. -- 9.13.

The Invisible Communion is with Christ and the Elect, 1 Cor. 15.28. Ephesians. 3.17.
1 Cor. 1.13.

Invisible Communion with Christ, is by the Spirit and Faith, Ephesians. 3.17. and
4.4. and 2.22.

Invisible Communion with the the Elect, is with Men and Angels, Heb. 1.14. 1
Cor. 13.13.

Men Elect, are Dead and Living: Elect living, are Uncalled and Called.

Communion with the Elect living, is Prayer proceeding from love, John 17.20.

For them that are Uncalled, that they may be Called, Romans 10.1.

For them that are Called, that they may be Confirmed, Col. 1.9, 12.

Communion with the Elect Angels, is the help of their Ministry, Matthew. 18.10.
Heb. 1.14. Genesis 28.12. and 32.1, 2. Psalm. 34.7. Reverence of them, 1 Cor.
11.10. and love unto them, 1 Cor. 13.13.

A Visible Communion of Saints, is of two, three, or more Saints joined
together by Covenant with God and themselves, freely to use all the holy things
of God, according to the Word, for their mutual Edification, and God's Glory,
Matthew. 18.20. Deuteronomy. 29.12. etc. Psalm. 147.19. and 149.6, 9. Rev. 1.16.

This Visible Communion of Saints, is in a Visible Church, Matthew. 18.20. Act.
1.15. and 2.1, 41, 42, 46.

The Visible Church is the only Religious Society that God has ordained for
Men on Earth, John 14.6. Matthew. 18.20. and 13.14. 2 Chronicles. 13.8, 12. Act. 4.12.
Rev. 18.4. 2 Cor. 6.16, 18.

Religious Societies, such as Abbeys, Monasteries, Nunneries, and the like, are
unscriptural, and not of Christ's Institution.

But the Visible Church is Christ's Institution, and a Means to Worship God in,
Ephesians. 4.6. -- 6. Mark 13.34. 2 Chronicles. 13.10, 11. Heb. 3.6. compared with Heb.
8.5. and 3.2, -- 6.

No Religious Communion to be had, but with Members of a Visible Church, Matthew.
18.17, 20. 1 Cor. 5.12. Act. 4.11, 12. 2 Cor. 6.16, 18. Rev. 18.4.

Whatsoever Company or Communion of Men, do Worship God, being not of the
Communion of a Visible Church, sin, 2 Chronicles. 13.9, 10. Matthew. 15.9. 1 Cor.
5.12, 13.

The true Visible Church is the narrow way that leads to Life, which few
find, Joh. 14.6. Matthew. 7.14.

Other Religious Communions are the broad way that leads to Destruction,
which may find, Matthew. 7.13. Acts 4.12.

God's Word does absolutely describe unto us the only true Form of a true
Visible Church, Mark 13.34. 1 Cor. 12.5. Heb. 8.5. and 3.2, 6. Rev. 22.18, 19.
2 Timothy 3.16, 17. Romans 14.23. Heb. 11.6.

There is one only true Form of a Visible Church, Joh. 14.6. Ephesians. 4.4, 5. 1
Cor. 1.10, 13. Joh. 17.17.

Forms of Visible Churches, or Religious Communions to worship God in or by,
devised by Men, are intellectual Idols, Exodus 20.4, 5. Matthew. 15.9, 2. Chron.
17.8, 12. 1 Kings 12.33.

Visible Churches or Religious Communions, constituted according to the
Invention of Men, are real Idols; and to join to them, and to worship God in
them, is to join to Idols, or to worship God in or by Idols, by consequence
from the former.

Visible Churches or Religious Communions, are either true or false, Joh. 14.6.
Psalm. 119.23. 2 Chronicles. 1.8, 12. Ephesians. 4.4, 5, 6.

The Visible Churches are such as have the true Essential Causes and
Properties, which God's Word ascribes to the true Visible Church from the
Definition. False Churches are the contrary to the true by Proportion.

To a true Visible Church are requisite three things: First, True Matter. 2dly,
True Form. 3dly, True Properties.

The true Matter of a true Visible Church, are Saints, Exodus 28.9, 10, 15, 21.
compared with Rev. 21.14, 21. and 1 Kings 5.17. compared with 1 Pet. 2.5.
Levit. 11. to 13, 43, 44. compared with Rev. 18.2. 1 Pet. 2.9. Deuteronomy. 14. 2.
Romans 1.7. 1 Cor. 1.2. Ephesians. 1.1. Phil. 1.1. 1 Pet. 1.2. Heb. 3.1.

Saints are Men separated from all known Sin, practicing the whole Will of God
known unto them, Col. 1.2. and 2.11, 13. Romans 1.7. and 6.2, 12, 22. growing in
Grace and Knowledge, 2 Pet. 3.18. continuing to the end, 1 John 2.19.

The true Form of a true Visible Church, is partly inward, partly outward.

The inward part of the Form consists in Three things: First, The Spirit.
2dly, Faith. 3dly, Love.

The Spirit is the Soul animating the whole Body, Ephesians. 4.4. 1 Cor. 12.4, 11,
13.7.10. 1 Cor. 6.17.

Faith uniteth the Members of the Body to the Head Christ, Ephesians. 3.1. and 4.13,
15. and 5.30, 33. 1 Cor. 6.17.

Love uniteth the Members of the Body each to other, Ephesians. 2.20, 21. and 4.16,
23. Col. 3.14, 15.

The outward part of the true Form of the true Visible Church, is a Vow,
Promise, Oath or Covenant, betwixt God and the Saints, by proportion from the
inward Form. See also Genesis 17.1, 2. and 15.18. Deuteronomy. 29.1, 9, 13. 1 Chronicles.
29.10. and 34.30, 32. Psalm. 119.106. Nehem. 9.38. and 10.29. 1 Cor. 12.25, 26.
Romans 12.5, 15, 1^. Matthew. 18.15, 17.

This Covenant has Two Parts: 1. Respecting God and the Faithful. 2.
Respecting the Faithful amongst themselves.

1. That part of the Covenant which respects God, consists in their Solemn
Personal Engagement and Profession to be his in Faith, and Holy entire
Obedience, Esa. 55.3.56. 1. Ezekiel. 16.60. 2 Chronicles. 7.18.

2. That which regards the Faithful, is a Solemn Declaration of their
Submission to the same Lord, Faith and Baptism, under the same Church Order,
Josh. 22.2-5. Romans 1.5.6.16, 17, 18, 19. Ephesians. 5.24.

The Privileges the Saints enjoy by thus entering into Covenant are Twofold,
1. Communion in all holy Things of God. 2. The Power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 John 1. and 3. 1 Cor. 10.16. and 5.4, 5. Mat. 18.20. Esaias 55.33. Act. 15.34.

The holy Things of God are, 1. Christ. 2. Benefits by Christ. Romans 8.32.

The true Church has Title to, Possession, and Use of Christ, Esaias 9.6. Song
2.16. Mat. 18.20. 1 Cor. 3.21, 23. Ephesians. 5.30.

The Benefits which the true Church has by Christ, are the Means of Salvation:
And the Privileges the Members enjoy in the Church is receiving of Alms, 1 Timothy 14.8. 2 Pet. 1.3.

The Means of S^lvation are the Word, Sacraments, Prayers, Censures, and the
Ordinances of Christ, for the Dispensing of them all, Romans 3.2. and 4.11. Luke
19.46. Mat. 18.15, 17. Acts 2.42. 1 Cor. 11.23, 26. Mat. 28.19. Psalm. 149.6, 9.

Alms are the Works of Mercy yielded to the Saints in Distress, Acts 2.44, 45.
and 5.4. Mat. 25.34, 40. Heb. 13.1, 3. 1 Timothy 3.2. and 5.10.

The Power of the Lord Jesus Christ given to the Church has three Parts.

Viz. Power to, 1. Receive in, Joh. 10.3. Act. 9.26, 27. and 18.27. and 6.5.
2dly. Preserve and keep within, 1 John 2.19. 1 Pet. 1.5. 3dly. To cast out, 1
Cor. 5.13.

The true Visible Church has Power to receive in, 1. Members into Communion,
Act. 2.41. and 18.27. and 9.26, 27. And, 2dly. Officers into Office, Act. 6.5.
and 14.23.

The Way or Door whereby both Members and Officers enter in, is Christ; that
is, the Way taught by Christ in his Word, Joh. 14.6. and 17.17. Mark 13.34, 37.

The Qualification of Members to be admitted in the Church, is Faith testified
by Obedience, Acts 8.36, 37. Mat. 3.6. Luke 7.29, 30.

Faith is the Knowledge of the Doctrine of Salvation by Christ, 1 Cor. 12.9.
Gal. 3.2.

Obedience is a godly, righteous and sober Life, Tit. 2.11, 12. Romans 1.5.

Members thus received into Communion are of two sorts. 1st. Prophets, 2dly.
Private Persons. 1 Cor. 14.24. 1 Samuel 19.24, 23.

Prophets or Teachers are Men endued with Gifts proper for Edification,
Exhortation and Consolation, 1 Cor. 14.3. Acts 13.1. Romans 12.6.

These Persons must first be appointed to this Exercise by the Church, 1 Cor.
24.49. Acts. 13.1.

The Prophets or Teachers Care must be to Teach according to the Proportion or
Rule of Faith, Romans 12.6. 1 Cor. 14.26.

Let the Prophets speak two or three, and the rest judge, 1 Cor. 14.29.

If any thing be revealed to him that sits by, let the first hold his Peace,
1 Cor. 14.30, 40.

All that have Gifts may be admitted to Prophecy, 1 Cor. 14.31.

Private Persons are, 1st. Men. 2dly. Women, Believers.

Private Men present at the exercise of Prophecy, may modestly propound their
Doubts, which are to be resolved by the Prophets: Luke 2.46, 47. 1 Samuel 19.20,
23. 1 Cor. 4.30.

Women are not permitted to speak in the Church in Time of Prophecy, 1 Cor.
14.34. 1 Timothy 2.12. Revel. 2.20.

If Women doubt of any thing delivered in Time of Prophecy, and are willing to
learn, they must ask them that can teach them in Private, as their Husbands at
home, if they be Faithful, or some other of the Church, 1 Cor. 14.35. 1 Timothy
2.12.

To hear this exercise of Prophecy may be admitted Unbelievers, or they that
are without, 1. Cor. 14.24. Acts 2.6, 13.

The Exercise of Prophecy, or the Preaching of the Word by them that are sent,
is that ordinary Means God has appointed to convert Men, 1 Cor. 14.24, 25.
Romans 10.14, 14.

They are sent by God to preach whom the Church sends, Acts 13.2, 4. and
8.14, 15.

If any Man be converted by other Means, it is not Ordinary, Romans 10.14, 15.
John 4.39, 41. Acts 9.5, 6.

Therefore they that are converted in false Churches, are not converted by
ordinary Means, 1 King. 14.13. and 19.18. Romans 11.3, 4. Rev. 18.4.

The Way of receiving Officers into Office is, 1. Election. 2dly. Approbation.
3dly. Ordination: Which must be performed with Fasting and Prayer, Acts 6.5.
and 14.23. 1 Timothy 3.10. and 5.22. and 4.14. Tit. 1.5. Acts 13.3.

The Person to be admitted into Office must first be a Member of that Visible
Church whence he has his Calling, Acts 1.21, 22. and 6.3.5. and 18.27, 28. 1
Cor. 11.12. and 3.6. 1 Timothy 3.2, 3-10.

Election is by most Voices of the Members of the Church in full Communion,
Acts 6.5. and 14.23.

Query, Whether Women, Servants and Children, admitted into full Commonion, yet
under Age, may not give Voice in Elections, Excommunications, and other public
Affairs of the Church? 1 Pet. 3.7. Ephesians. 4.4. 1 Timothy 5.9, 10. Numb. 30.5 --
10, 16. 1 Cor. 14.34. Genesis 3.16. 1 Cor. 11.3, 10. Genesis 18.19. Josh. 24.15.

Approbation is the examining and finding the Officer-elect, to be according to
the Rules of his Office, 1 Timothy 3.10. and 5.9, 10. Acts 6.3.

In Approbation every Member is bound to object what he can, especially they
that denied their Voices, Acts 15.37, 38. 1 Timothy 3.2, 3, 10. Acts 6.3.

Approbation must be after Election, lest without Cause the Infirmities of the
Brethren be discovered: For there are Faults, disabling Men to Offices, which
do not disable them to be Members of the Church, Ezekiel. 44.9, 15. Acts 15.37,
38. Mat. 18.21, 22. compared with Prove. 10.12. 1 Pet. 4.8.

It the things objected bear Weight against the Officer-elect, the Election is
void, and they may proceed to the Choice of another, 1 Timothy 3.4.5. and 5.11.
Acts 15.37, 38. Ezekiel. 44.10. 2 King. 22.9.

Defects or Faults that cast Men out of Office, are sufficient to hinder Men
from entering into Office: By Proportion.

If the things objected be Frivelous the Election is approved, 1 Timothy 3.10. and
they that dissented are to consent to the rest, that so the whole Church may
agree in one Person, 1 Cor. 1.10. Ephesians. 4.3. compared with Acts 1.26.

If the Parties objecting still dissent without an approved Reason, they are to
be reformed by Censure, 1 Cor. 11.17, 18. Mat. 18.15, 17.

Ordination is the Dedication of the Officer thus approved, to his Office,
Exodus 29.44. and 40.12, 16. Numb. 8.6, 15. Heb. 5.4, 5. Mat. 3.15, 17. Acts
13.3, 4. 1 Timothy 4.14. Heb. 6.2. Ordination has three parts.

The first is the Power which the Church commits to the Officer approved: To
administer according to his Office, John 20.21, 23. Mat. 18.15, 20. compared
with Exodus 29.1, 38. Numb. 8.10, 11. Acts 6.3, 5. and 14.23. and 20.28. 1 Timothy
4.14. 2 Timothy 1.6, 14.

The second is Prayer made by the whole Church, for the Officer invested with
this Power, that he may faithfully administer, Acts 6.6. and 13.3. and 14.23. 1
Cor. 4.2.

The third is a Charge given to the Officer thus admitted to look unto his
Office in all the parts thereof, Mat. 28.18, 19. 1 Timothy 5.21. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2. 1 Timothy 6.13, 14. compared with Deuteronomy. 1.16.

The Ceremony used by the Apostles in Ordination is Imposition of Hands: Which
Ceremony first of all was used in the Old Testament, Number. 8.10. then in the
New: By Christ in praying for Children, Mark 10.16. by God the Father in
ordaining Christ to his Office of Mediator, Luke 3.21, 22. by Christ in
ordaining the Apostles, Acts 2.3, 4. and 1.4, 8. by the Apostles in giving the
Holy Ghost, Acts 8.15, 17. in ordaining Evangelists, 2 Timothy 1.6. and in
ordaining ordinary Ministers, Acts 6.6. and 14.23. by the Eldership or Church
in ordaining Officers, Acts 13.3. 1 Timothy 4.4. by the Evangelists in ordaining
Officers, 1 Timothy 5.22. Tit. 1.5. and so may lawfully be retained and used in
the Church still, Heb. 6.2.

The Use of Imposition of Hands, is twofold.

First, To point out the Officer in time of Prayer made for him; as if it
should be said, This is the Man, by Proportion from 1 Samuel 10.24. Mat. 3.17.

Secondly, To signify and to assure the Officer to be ordained, that the Lord
by the Church gives him Power to administer, Acts 13.3, 4. and 20.28. John
20.21.

Ordination, and so Imposition of Hands, appertains to the whole Church, as
does Election and Approbation, Acts 13.3. Number. 8.9, 10. yet for order sake the
fittest Members lay on Hands, and perform all other Particulars of Ordination
for and in the Name of whole Church, 1 Cor. 14.40. compared with Numb. 8.9, 10.
and Acts 13.3. and 1 Timothy 4.14. and by proportion from Lev. 4.15.

The fittest Persons are Elders when the Church has them, 1 Timothy 4.14. when
the Church wants Elders, Men of best Gifts appointed by the Church, Numb.
8.9, 10.

Thus after the Apostasy of Antichrist arises a true Ministry in the Church,
Rev. 18.4.

The Officers of a true Visible Church thus admitted, are then to administer
faithfully, 1 Timothy 3.10. 1 Cor. 4.2.

The Officers of the true Visible Church, are all absolutely described in the
Word of God, Heb. 3.2, 5. and 8.5. Romans 12.7, 8 Mark 13.34.

These Officers are of two sorts: 1st, Bishops. 2dly, Deacons, Phil. 1.1.

The Bishops are also called Elders or Presbyters, Acts 20.17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.1.

The Bishops or Elders jointly together are called the Eldership or Presbytery,
1 Timothy 4.14. and 5.17. compared.

The Eldership consists of three sorts of Persons or Officers: Viz. the
Pastor, Teacher, and Governor, 1 Timothy 4.14. and 5.17.

All the Elders or Bishops must be apt to teach, 1 Timothy 3.2. Tit. 1.9.

The Pastor is a Bishop excelling in the Word of Wisdom or Exhortation, Romans
12.8. 1 Cor. 12.8. he is called the Angel of the Church, Rev. 2. and 3.

The Teacher is a Bishop excelling in the Word of Knowledge or Doctrine, Romans
12.7. 1 Cor. 12.8.

The Governor is a Bishop excelling in the quality of Wise Government, 1 Timothy
5.17. Romans 12.8.

The Pastor and Teacher have also Power to administer the Sacraments, Mat.
28.19. Ephesians. 4.12. 1 Cor. 11.23.

All the Bishops deal by Office in the Government of the Church, 1 Timothy 5.17.
and are conversant about the Soul and Spiritual Part, Joh. 18.36. 2 Cor. 10.3.

The Deacons are Officers employed about the Works of Mercy respecting the Body
or outward Man, Acts 6.2.

The Deacons are, 1st, Men. Or, 2. Women Deacons or Widows, Acts 6.2. Romans 16.1.

Men Deacons ought to Collect and Distribute with Integrity the Churches
Treasure, according to the Churches Necessities, and the Saints Occasions, Romans
12.8. 2 Cor. 8.2, 8. 1 Cor. 16.2, 3.

The Churches Treasure is Silver, Gold, or Money worth, freely given by the
Members of the Visible Church for the Common Good, Lev. 27. toto. 2 Kings
12.14-16. Luke 21.4. Acts 4.34, 35. 2 Cor. 8.2-8. and 9.7.

The Churches Treasure is holy, Mat. 27.6. Luke 12.4.

Query, Whether those that are without may cast of their Goods into the
Treasury, lest the Treasury be polluted? 2 Cor. 8.4. Josh. 6.17-19.

Nothing that is gotten by Fraud, Violence, or any wicked Means, may be cast
into the Churches Treasury, Deuteronomy. 23.18. Micah 1.7. Esa. 67.3.

Query, Whether the use of the Churches Treasure is peculiar to the Saints; and
consists in provision for holy Things, or holy Persons? Deuteronomy. 14.2, 3, 21.
Exodus 30.12 -- 16.

Holy Things, such as Bread and Wine for the Lord's Supper, with Places and
Instruments serviceable to holy Uses, Exodus 25.2, 8. Mat. 27.7. per contrarium.

Holy Persons, as the Maintenance of Church Officers, and the poor Brethren
either of that Particular Visible Church, or of any other True Church, 1 Cor.
16.2, 3. 2 Cor. 8.7. 1 Cor. 9.6, 14. 1 Timothy 5.17, 18.

In the Necessity of the Church, if they that are without bestow any thing upon
the Saints, they may receive and use it with Thanksgiving, 1 Cor. 10.25, 26.

If it be manifested by Evidence, that the Goods of them that are without
offered to the Saints, be the Treasures of Wickedness; the Saints are not to
receive nor use them, to avoid offense, 1 Cor. 10.28, 29.

Women-Deacons or Widows are, of Sixty Years of Age, qualified according to the
Apostle's Rule, 1 Timothy 5.9. relieving the Bodily Infirmities of the Saints with
Cheerfulness, Romans 12.8. and 16.1.

Hitherto of the Churches Power of receiving in; now follows the Churches
Power of preserving and keeping within.

The Power of preserving within, is manifested by the heedful use of all the
holy things of God by the whole Church jointly, and by every Member
particularly, Mark 13.33-37. Heb. 10.24. 1 These. 5.14. Mal. 18.15, 17. Acts 6.1.

The Pastors chief Endeavor must be to make the Church Zealous, Holy and
Obedient, Romans 12.8. 1 Cor. 12.8. Apoc. 3.19. by proportion.

The Teachers chief Care must be to preserve the Church from Ignorance and
Error, 1 Cor. 12.8. Romans 12.7. 1 Cor. 3.10, 12. compared with Tit. 1.9.

The chief Office of the Governors consists in preserving Peace and Order in
the Church, 1 Cor. 14.40. Romans 12.8. 1 Timothy 5.17.

The D^acons chief Care must be that none of the Saints want Bodily
Necessaries, and that due Provision be made for holy Things and Persons, Romans
12.8. John 13.29. and that with Simplicity of heart, John 12.6.

The Widows chief Office is to Visit and Relieve the Widow, Fatherless, Sick,
Lame, Blind, Impotent, Women with Child, and Diseased Members of the Church, 1 Timothy 5.9. Romans 12.8. Mat. 15.35-40.

The Care of the Eldership must be to order, direct and moderate the public
Actions of the Church, 1 Cor. 14.40. 1 Timothy 5.17.

The Prophets chief Care must be to resolve Doubts, Difficulties, and Dark
Places, and to give true Fxpositions, Translations, and Reconciliations of
Scripture, 1 Cor. 14.29, 30. Luke 2.46, 47.

The Office of the Pastor and Teacher in the Exercise of Prophecy, is to
moderate and determine all Matters out of the Word, 1 Cor. 14.32. 1 Samuel 19.20.

The Care of the whole Church jointly, must be to keep her Power given her by
Christ, and not to suffer any open known Sin, or any Tyranny or Usurpation over
them, Mat. 18.15-17. Mark 13.37. Col. 4.17. 3 John 9, 10. Rev. 2.2. Gal. 1.8, 9.

The chief Care of every Member as a Member, must be to watch over his Brother,
Mark 13.37. Heb. 10.24. in bearing one another's Burden, Gal. 6.2. 1 Cor.
10.24, 28, 29. admonishing the Unruly, comforting the Feeble-minded, 1 These.
5.14. admonishing the Excommunicate, 2 These. 3.15. restoring them that are
Fallen, Gal. 6.1.

Here special Care must be had of Admonishing, Mat. 18.15-17.

Admonition must be administered with Prayer and in Love, 1 Timothy 4.5. Gal. 6.1.
Lev. 19.17. 1 Timothy 1.5. Romans 13.8.

Prayer is needful that it may please God to give his Blessing to the
Admonition administered, Mat. 7.7, 8. Jam. 1.5. and 4.2, 3.

Love must be manifested to the Offender that he may be the better won, Ephesians.
4.2. Col. 3.14. Lev. 19.17. 1 Pet. 4.8.

Admonition is either private or public, Mat. 18.15, 17.

Private Admonition is either Solitary, or before Witness, ibid.

Private Admonition that is solitary, is performed by one particular Brother
offended, to another Brother offending, and that in secret, Mat. 18.15.

The Admonisher must not tell the Fault of the Offender to another, but himself
must admonish the Offender, Psalm. 15.3. 1 Pet. 4.8. Prove. 25.9.

If the Offender repent upon Admonition, the Fault must be covered, Prove.
10.12. if not, the Admonisher must proceed to the second degree of Admonition;
viz. to admonish the Offender before Witness, Mat. 18.6.

The fittest Witnesses must be chosen, 1 Kings 21.10, 13. Mat. 26.59-61. and
28.12-15. The sit Witnesses for the most part are the Elders, who for their
Wisdom and Authority can best sway with the Delinquent.

If the Offender repent upon Admonition before Witness, the Fault must yet be
covered also, Prove. 10.12. 1 Pet. 4.8. Jam. 5.20.

If the Offender admonished before Witness deny the Fact, then Protestation or
an Oath of God must end the Matter, Exodus 22.11.

Though the Admonisher know the Fact to be so, and the Offender deny the Fact
before Witness, yet the Admonisher is not to forsake the Offender's Communion,
John 5.31. and 13.26. notwithstanding he must still seek to bring him to
Repentance, Levit. 19.17.

If the Offender acknowledge the Fact, and repent not, the Admonisher and
Witnesses must bring the Matter to the Church, Mat. 18.17.

In bringing the Matter to the Church, if the Elders be not already Interessed
in the Cause, it is meet to use the advice and help of the Eldership, who are
fittest to deal in all public Businesses, 1 Cor. 14.33, 40. 1 Timothy 5.17.

The Matter being before the Church, the Offender is to be dealt with by all
possible Means, that he may come to Repentance, as by Admonition, by Threat, by
Entreaty, by Prayer for him, etc. Gal. 6.1. 2 Cor. 2.6.

If the Offender repent upon the Churches Admonition, he is still to be
continued, and accounted a Brother, 2 Cor. 2.6. Mat. 18.17.

Thus the Church, and all the Members thereof, shall be preserved and kept pure
within, and their Communion shall be holy, Lev. 19.17. 1 Timothy 5.22. 1 Cor.
5.20. and 5.6. and so shall increase with the increasing of God, 1 Cor. 11.17.
2 Pet. 3.18.

All the degrees of Admonition must be administered upon the Offender before the
Church have any Communion with him, Mat. 18.15-17. 1 Cor. 11.17. 1 Timothy 5.22.
Levit. 19.18. Mat. 22.29.

If a Man see his B^other sin, and admonish him not, but suffer his Sin
unreproved, he is defiled therewith, Lev. 19.17. Mat. 18.15. and 22.33. 1 Timothy
5.22.

In solitary Admonition, if the Admonisher stay in the first degree of
Admonition, the Offender not repenting, he is defiled with the Sin.

In Admonition before Witness, if the Admonishers cease and stay in the second
degree of Admonition, the Offender not repenting, they are defiled with the Sin.

In Admonition before the Church, if the Church bear with the Party offending,
and bring him not to repent, but leave him in Sin and Impenitency, and yet hold
him still in Communion, then the whole Church is defiled; and so that is
verified, a little Leaven leaveneth the whole lump, 1 Cor. 5.6. and 11.17. Mat.
13.33.

If a Sin be publicly known in a Church, or if more Sins be openly known and
suffered, the whole Church is defiled and leavened. Ibid.

No Communion can be had with, nor no joining can be to, a Church thus
leavened, without manifest consenting to Sin, ibid.

Therefore if the Church will not Reform open known Corruptions after due
proceeding, Separation must be made from her till Reformation come.

Therefore Separation may be made from true Churches for Incorrigible
Corruptions; and to separate from a Defiled Church that is Incorrigible, is not
to forsake the Communion of Holy Things, but the Pollution and Profanation of
Holy Things.

Thus much for the second part of the Churches Power of preserving and keeping
within.

The Churches Power of casting out follows, which is twofold.

First of Officers out of Office, Acts 14.23. compared with Col. 5.17. Rev.
2.2. Gal. 1.8, 9.

Second of Members out of Communion, Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. 2 These. 3.6,
14. 1 Timothy 1.20.

The Cause of casting Officers out of Office, are Apostasy or Disability, Ezekiel.
44.10. Numb. 8.23-26.

Apostasy is when the Officers shall fall to open Idolatry, Atheism, Heresy,
or other Sins against the first and second Table of the like Nature, Ezekiel.
44.10. and by proportion drawn from 2 King. 23.9. 1 Timothy 3.2. Lev. 22.1-5. and
21.16-24. Ezra 2.61, 62.

Query, Whether the Officer upon Repentance, after Apostasy, or Sin equivalent
thereto, may be retained as a Member of the Church, but not as an Officer?
Ezekiel. 44.13, 14. Mat. 26.69-75. compared with John 21.15-18. Acts 15.38.

Disability is either of Age, or Sickness, or Maiming, etc.

Disability of Age is when the Officer can no longer, by reason of old Age,
discharge the Works of his Office, then he may retain his Dignity, and ought to
be honored of all, Numb. 8.23-26. Philemon 9.

Disability by Sickness, as Frenzy, Madness, Malancholy, or by Maiming as Loss
of the Tongue in the Pastor or Teacher, etc. or by any other Infirmity,
disabling him to the Actions of his Office, Lev. 16.24. compared with 1 Timothy
3.2. Tit. 1.6, 9.

Query, whether an Officer may refuse an Office imposed upon him by a lawful
Calling? Exodus 4.14. Jer. 1.6, 7, 17.

Query, Whether the Church may suffer her Officer to be translated from her
self to other Churches upon any good Ground, Acts 20.28. 1 Pet. 5.2. Acts 13.4.
yea though it be granted that she have Members as fit for Offices as her
Officers are in present: Yea though the Life of the Officer be endangered, Acts
9.25. Mat. 10.23. 1 King. 18.4.

The Cause of casting Members out of Communion is only one: Viz. Sin
obstinately stood in without Repentance and Confession after due Conviction,
Mat. 18.17. Job 31.33. Prove. 28.13.

Due Conviction is the Discovery of the Sin by manifest Evidence, Job 19.4. and
32.12, 13. and 39.37.

Manifest Evidence is either to the Fact, or Sinfulness of the Fact.

The Fact is evident either by Confession of the Party that committed the Fact,
or by sufficient Witness, Mat. 26.65. Deuteronomy. 19.15. John 5.31.

Query, Whether the Testimony of them that are without is Sufficient or no?

The Sinfulness of the Fact is Evident either by direct Scripture, or by
necessary Consequence from the Scripture, Mat. 22.31, 32. and 4.4.

Due Conviction is perceived two Ways; First, By the Delinquents Shifting,
Cavils, Excursions, Tergiversations, etc. 1 Timothy 1.6. Tit. 3.11. Secondly, By
the Conscience of them that have Power to censure the Fact, Psalm. 36.1. Prove.
27.19. Tit. 3.10. 1 Cor. 2.15. and 12.10.

Obstinacy in Sin is the continuance in refusing to confess and forsake the
Crime, Prove. 28.13. Mat. 18.17. Josh. 7.1, 9.

If the Matter be not Evident, but Doubtful and Controversal, Communion still
must be preserved peaceably, notwithstanding Diversity of Judgment, till the
Truth be discovered, Phil. 3.15, 16. 1 Cor. 13.49.7.9.

Persons that differ in Judgment are either Strong or Weak, Romans 15.1.

The Strong must not maintain Controversies with the Weak, nor Despise them,
but bear their Infirmity and Burden, Romans 15.1. and 14.1, 3. Gal. 6.2. 1 Cor.
13.5, 7. and 9.22. and 10.23, 34.

The Weak must not Censure or Judge the Strong as Delinquents, but meekly
desire Instruction and Satisfaction, Romans 14.3. Mat. 7.1-3.

Thus must Men walk in Diversity of Opinion, during which time, all Men must
carefully search out the Truth, and labor for Information, 1 Cor. 1.10. 2 Pet.
3.18. Phil. 3.15. Jam. 1.5.

The Power given the Church for casting out obstinate convicted Offenders, is
the Power of Excommunication, 2 Cor. 18.3, 6. and 1.5.4.5. 1 Timothy 1.20. Gal.
5.12. 2 Thessalonians. 3.6, 14. Mat. 18.17.

Query, Whether delivering to Satan be not, or does not contain some bodily
Punishment to be inflicted upon the Offender? See Acts 5.5, 10. 1 Cor. 12.10.

Excommunication is the depriving of the Offender of the Visible Communion of
Saints, and the Benefit of the Holy Things of God given to the Church, 1 Cor.
5.4, 5, 11, 13. 2 Thessalonians. 3.6, 14. Mat. 18.17.

Query, Whether separating, withdrawing, turning away from false Teachers and
wicked Livers, be the same with Excommunication? 2 These. 3.6. 1 Timothy 5.6. and
2.3, 5. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5.

Excommunication duly administered is ratified and confirmed in Heaven, Mat.
18.18. John 20.23.

Therefore the Party Excommunicate is in the Hands of Satan, and out of the
Lord's Protection and Blessing, being deprived of all the public Means of
Salvation, Mat. 18.17. Cor. 5.5. Esa. 4.5, 6.

In Excommunication consider two Things: First, The decreeing of it, which must
be done by the whole Church, 1 Cor. 5.4. wherein the Church must proceed as in
approving her Officers. Secondly, The pronouncing of Excommunication, which
must be performed by the fittest Person deputed thereto by the Church, 1 Cor.
14.40.

The End of Excommuication is not the Destruction of the Offender, but the
Mortification of his Sin, and the Salvation of his Soul, 1 Cor. 5.5. 2 These.
3.14, 15. 1. Tim. 1.23.

Query, Whether the Party Excommunicated is to be counted as an Enemy, or to be
admonished as a Brother? 2 Thessalonians. 5.15.

The Members of the Church are to avoid Religious and Civil Communion with him
that is Excommunicated, Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.11. except that Subjects,
Servants, Children, Parents, Wife or Husbands, etc. that are bound to him, may
perform Civil and Natural Offices to him, 1 Cor. 7.5, 12, 13. and by Proportion.

The Party Excomunicated upon Repentance is to be admitted again into the
Communion of the Visible Church, 2 Cor. 2.6-8. yet so as that the Church always
have an especial Eye to him, as being a suspicious Person that durst despise
the Church, Mat. 18.17. Ezekiel. 44.10. 2 Pet. 2.22. Heb. 10.26. by Proportion.

Query, Whether an Officer Excommunicated upon Repentance may be again admitted
into Office? And whether he must have a new Vocation by Election, Approbation,
Ordination?

The Visible Church walking in this Holy Order has in it the Presence and
Protection of Christ, Esa. 4.5, 6. Mat. 28.20. and 18.20.

To such a Visible Church must all sorts of Persons resort that desire to be
saved, Acts 4.12. Mat. 7.13, 14. John 15.6.

True Visible Churches are of two sorts: First, Pure, where no open known Sin
is suffered, Rev. 2.7-13. and 3.8-11. Secondly, Corrupt, wherein some one or
more open known Sin is tolerated, Rev. 3.1, 6. 1 Cor. 11.17, 21, 22.

True Visible Churches are so far good as they agree to the Pattern of the
Word, Heb. 8.5. Rev. chap. 2, and 3.1 Cor. 11.2, 17, 22.

Every true Visible Church has Title to whole Christ and all the Holy Things
of God. Esa. 9.6, 7. Cant. 2.16. Ephesians. 1.22, 23.

Any one true Visible Church is of equal Power with any other Visible Church,
Apoc. cap. 2. and 3. 1 Cor. 5. and has Power to reform all Abuses within it
self, 1 Cor. 11.2, 17. which Power is Spiritual, as is Christ's Kingdom, not
Worldly, Bodily, nor Carnal, John 18.36. 2 Cor. 10.3, 5.

The erecting of Visible Churches appertains to Princes and private Persons.

Princes must erect them in their Dominions and command all their Subjects to
enter into them, being first prepared and fitted thereto. 2 Chronicles. 29. and 34.
and 17.

Private Persons separating from all Sin, and joining together to obey Christ
their King, Priest and Prophet, as they are bound, are a true Visible Church,
and have a Charter given them by Christ thereto, being but two or three, Mat.
18.20. Acts 14.19, 20. Heb. 11.38. and further power than to reform themselves
they have none.

Every Man is bound in Conscience to be a Member of some Visible Church
established in this true Order, Mat. 7.13. Rev. 18.4.

Because every Man is bound to obey Christ in his Kingdom and spiritual
Regiment, and no other, Luke 19.14, 27. and the true Visible Church is Christ's
Kingdom and House, Mark 13.34. Luke 19.14, 27. Acts 1.3. Heb. 12, 28. and 3.6.

Therefore they that are not Members of this Visible Church, are no Subjects of
Christ's Kingdom, Luke 19.17. 1 Cor. 5.12.

This true Visible Church is called Christ, 1 Cor. 12.12.

Thus much concerning the true Church: The false Church of Antichrist follows
to be considered.

Whatsoever thing is contrary to this Order of the Visible Church is
Antichristian, by Notation of the Word compared with 1 Cor. 12.12.

Whosoever takes upon him to erect new Forms of Visible Churches, and to
appoint new Officers, Laws, Ministry, Worship, or Communion in the Church, is
Antichrist, 1 John 4.3. 2 These. 2.4. Rev. 13.16, 17.

Whosoever yields or submits to any other Constitution, Laws, Officers,
Ministry or Worship, than that of Christ's Appointment, is the Subject, Servant
of Antichrist, by necessary Consequence from the former, and Romans 6.16.

A Man cannot be both the Servant of Christ and of Antichrist, Mat. 6.24.
