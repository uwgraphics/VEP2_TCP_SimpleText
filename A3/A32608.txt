A PROCLAMATION Prohibiting the Importation of Foreign Playing-Cards, and for
Seizing such as are or shall be IMPORTED.
CHARLES R.

WHereas by the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm, all Foreign Playing-Cards
(amongst diverse other Foreign Manufactures) are Prohibited to be Imported,
under Penalty of Forfeiture; Yet notwithstanding, as We are given to understand
by the Humble Petition of the Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Company of
Card-makers of London, diverse of Our Subjects and others, are so hardy, to
bring into this Kingdom great quantities of Foreign Playing-Cards, and
publicly to expose the same to Sale, in contempt of Us and Our Laws, and to
the great Impoverishment of the Poor Artificers of the said Company, and other
Our Subjects employed in making the said Manufacture; We taking the same into
Our serious Consideration, and being desirous in this particular, as We always
hitherto have been, in the whole course of Our Government, to encourage
Manufactures within this Our Kingdom, whereby Our Subjects are maintained in
good Estate, and Trade increased, are Graciously pleased, with the Advice of
Our Privy Council, by this Our Royal Proclamation, to Command and Direct, That
all Laws now in force, Prohibiting the Importation of any Foreign
Playing-Cards, be duly put in Execution by all Our Officers and other persons
concerned: And that all Foreign Playing-Cards already Imported, be forthwith
Searched for, Seized and Condemned, and all such as make Resistance therein,
proceeded against according to the utmost rigor of Law: Hereby strictly
Commanding and Requiring all Justices of the Peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffs,
Constables, and other Officers whatsoever, to be from time to time Aiding and
Assisting in all things requisite for and touching the due observation and
execution of the said Laws, and of this Our Royal Proclamation, at their Perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Seventh day of November 1684. In the six
and thirtieth Year of Our Reign.
