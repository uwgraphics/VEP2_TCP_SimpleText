TA DIAPHEPONTA, OR Divine Characters IN TWO PARTS, Acutely Distinguishing the
more Secret and Undiscerned Differences Between

1. The HYPOCRITE in his best Dress of Seeming Virtues and formal Duties.

And the True Christian in his Real Graces and Sincere Obedience.

As also between 2. The blackestweeds of daily Infirmities of the truly Godly,
eclipsing saving grace, And The Reigning Sins of the Unregenerate that
pretend unto that Godliness they never had.

Differencing The HYPOCRITE in his best Dress of Seeming Virtues and formal

THE Publishers of the ensuing TREATISE To the Candid and Judicious Readers,
Grace, Mercy, and Peace.
THis Excellent and most Useful Piece, so long desired, and so much longed for
by very many Eminent Pillars in the Church, as well as by multitudes of other
discerning Christians, is now made yours. But before you enter it, we hold it
needful to pray you to take a few things in your way: not touching the
superlative worth of that blessed and glorious star (a), the Renowned Author
of this Work, Dan. 12.3.
which you already have, in a little Tract of his Life and Death, printed Anno
1651. Nor, concerning the Scope and Method of it, which is done by himself in
his own Preface: but, something by way of Premonition, and something by way of
Apology, for our just vindication, and your better satisfaction.

We are troubled at the many slips of the Press, in these loose days too
Errors in printing, which you shall after find noted, to make the sense more
facile, and your reading of it more delightful. The false pointings are more,
and more troublesome than the noted faults, and cannot be particularly ranged
inter Errata, but must be amended in the reading. The pages also are, diverse of
them, false numbered. These, (together with the Contents in the front of each
page of the Natural, and Moral Hypocrites, without our direction) gives us just
cause to complain that, what once by the like supine carelessness and
unfaithfulness, befell the Holy Bible it self, printed in 80 Anno 1612.
wherein (among many other faults of that Edition) in steed of those words in
the 119 Psalm. Princes have persecuted me, etc. the words, in many Books of that
impression, ran thus, Printers have persecuted me without a cause, is now
become the sad fate of this Book, and might well be the closure of it, if the
Printer would do it and us right.

Our next Premonition concerns the publication, which has not been Mormo of
former times:) or, as thinking there is now no need of it; for, there was never
more. But, observing the boundless liberty taken up in these times of reigning
hypocrisy, by every Rabshekeh, and black-mouthed blasphemer, to reproach and
revile not only the most eminent servants, but even the clearest and most
fundamental Truths of Christ, through the sordid obstetrication of every
basely-mercenary Press; we could not satisfy our own discretions in
publishing such an elaborate Tractate in such unhallowed Saint-seeming
Dog-dayes.

Lucan.
-- rapidus queis Sirius ignes
Exerit,
it being a kind of disparagement to an Orthodox and grave Divine to appear in
print among the wild rabble of fancy-drunken scriblers; unless some
extraordinary emergency compel him to it.

Howbeit, meeting the last year with a misshapen Pamphlet, entitled
Hypocrisy unmasked, containing Characters of several Hypocrites, (fathered
upon Mr. Samuel Crook (that precious name) and published, (crassa minerva) by
John Dolling, we could not but kindle at such a mangled Piece, patcht up out of
some imperfect notes, first surreptitiously purloyned, and then as injuriously
dismembered, and thrust upon the World as the perfect issue of the Author.
Wherein, that Publisher has dealt not unlike to Joseph's Brethren, who first
made money of him; and then, in steed of their Brother, returned only his
coat, (dyed in blood, as they pleased) unto their Father. Or, as the Sorceresse
Medea, that being (for her wickedness) forced to fly, snatched up, and cut her
Brother in pieces, strowing them in her fathers way, to retard his pursuit of
Jason, who had, by her means, robbed him of his Golden Fleece. So that now we
held our selves bound to publish the whole as it was digested by the Reverend
Author; whose Characters, by that imperfect Piece, were almost reduced to as
much dishonor, as Jezabels carcass, of which no more was left but the skull,
the feet, and the palms of her hands 2 Kings 9.35
, to know her by.

If any think this to be gratis dictum, let him compare those Characters of the
Natural, Moral and Civil Hypocrites of Dollings Edition, with these here
published, ad verbum, according to the perfect Copy, and he shall soon find,
in many places, many lines together left out in that Pamphlet.

In the Praying Hypocrite, and the Fained Lover, he has wronged our Author yet
more, by obtruding those as perfect draughts, which are more imperfect than the
other. For, he never fingered, or so much as saw the last and more perfect
Copies of those two Chapters. Therein, the industrious Author, upon a review,
altered some things, and added more, either in the Title-leaf before each
Chapt. or in the adverse pages of each leaf (left blank for that purpose;) or
else, referd to other notes formerly preached on those subjects. All which are
now orderly put together.

We leave therefore every one to consider what regard is to be given to that
Publisher either in what He has set forth already, or further intimates to
his Reader, touching this, and certain select Sermons of the same Author,
licensed by the Vice Chancellor of Oxford, to be printed there: the rather,
because he acknowledges the full notes to be in one of our hands, and not in
his.

Nor needs any wise man to stumble at this; it being usual with Depeculators
hastily to catch up what lies in the way, although but an imperfect part,
whereby they mar all by rending in pieces what should not be divided. Hence,
that they so get, does them little good; and, what they leave, is of as little
use, until the torn parts be again conjoined, and the whole presented
together, which here is done.

And now we buckle on our Armor to obviate those reflections which Envy,
Incogitancy or Ignorance may seek to cast upon this Work: Against which
Ingratitude, we send out this little Apology, and Defense.

There is in it, say some, too great an affectation of Scripture Phrase,
insomuch

So say they who care not for the Scriptures, nor heed the applying of them.
Our Author is indeed much in Scripture Language, being an eloquent man, and
mighty in the Scriptures Acts 18.24
: not out of affectation, but as apprehending those expressions to transcend
all other; and, to let all men see wherein he most delighted, and how
exquisitely he could discern between the Waters of Jordan and the Rivers of
Damascus 2 Kings 5, 12
. Therefore he drew so much out of the purest fountain, and so little out of
the pudly rivulets of Plutarch, Seneca and other the most applauded Moralists.
Sometimes he makes use of their sayings, yet (no more than Paul, before him)
seldom vouchsafes them the honor to quote the particular places out of which
he had them to show how little weight he placed in them, and how far he was
from ostentation for being verst in them, as Moses, in all the learning of the
Egyptians Acts 7.22.
; and the Apostle, in Heathen Poets 1 Cor. 15.33 Ex Menandro. Titus 1.12 Ex
Epimenide
.

And albeit he alleges the same Texts often; yet, very rarely, if at all, to
the same purpose, and upon the same occasion; but, for several and distinct
uses. Nor is it a blot, but an excellency, to be able to make most use of what
is Excellent. The same Scriptures often afford variety of instructions; and
therefore a greater multiplicity of apt applications; where a wise man has the
handling of them. All Scripture (says Scripture it self) is profitable for
Doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness 2 Timothy
3.16
. If then, our Author who was wise, (still teaching the people knowledge, and
giving good heed to seek out, and to set in order many Proverbs Eccles. 12.9 10
, or excellent sayings) sought to find out acceptable words, even words of
truth, the words of God himself, He is not to be blamed, if he often produce
the same words, sometimes by way of doctrine, sometimes for reproof, or
redargution of error (...). Graec. Schol. apud Occumen.
; sometimes for correction of vice, and sometimes for instruction in
righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto
all good works. Nor is he to be taxed of tautologies, and vain repetitions, if
he use the same Scripture by way of assertion in one place, and by way of
allusion in another.

But, say others, not only the same words, but the same things (for which

This exception is soon wiped off by this one consideration, that even those
same things are ever produced to several purposes, and in a different manner.
Or, it happens by reason of the affinity of the Subjects, whereof he
treats. There is so much likeness and correspondency between some several
sorts of hypocrites, that what is spoken of one, agrees well enough to the
other. Upon this account the same things may be again alleged; yet with
variety of application. If then to write to you the same things, to him was not
grievous, why should it be irksome to you, for whom it is safe Phil. 3.1.
?

Therefore he does this ex industria, of set-purpose, so often, as the cause
required, that every part might be entire, without forcing the Reader to laquy
up and down to find out the meaning of one place by recourse to another. Every
several Chapter and Character here is like Solomon's Proverbs, independent,
although not inconsistent. Some of them are so large also, that every Reader
will not, and some cannot go over the whole. And, to refer such to another
place, is but to vex them by putting them to a double labor, first to search,
then to compare the places sought out, to pick out the sense of what they were
reading. It was therefore the wisdom of our considerate Author to make every
piece complete in it self, that he who will not, or cannot read all, might not
lose his labor in reading but a part.

two great Commandments of the Law, tending mainly to turn the inside of
Hypocrites outward, who, as the self-justifying Ruler, suppose they have kept
the whole Law, and call for more work; and look upon humble Christians as
despised Publicanes: that hereby they may see how grossly they deceive
themselves and others. It is that Test of the life of Religion, wherein Christ
himself spent the greatest part of his preaching Ministry, for unm^sking of
hypocrites, and to give warning of them. In a word, it is (next to the making
sure of Christ) the most needful work of a Christian to put himself upon the
most discriminating way of Trial of his sincerity, and upon the laying open of
whatever hypocrisy is in him, that he may with more care and speed bewail and
casheire it.

Nor has any man that knew our Christian Gamaliel, and envyeth not his high
esteem in the Church, any cause to complain that he has not said enough of,
and for Christ. For even such as never had the happiness to partake of his
preaching (wherein none sought more to set forth and to extol Christ) cannot be
such strangers in our Israel (if men of parts and industry) as not to take
notice of that orthodox and exquisite work of his, so often printed, and
reprinted, entitled, A Guide to true blessedness, in which every man (of
salt, and forehead) must needs acknowledge to the honor of God, his accurate
pains, and more than ordinary dexterity in setting forth Christ in his natures,
person, offices and works, as fully (though not in so many lines) as any man
taking liberty thus to object, has done, or can do.

It is not requisite, but would be very incongruous to go over the doctrine of
faith in a treatise of manners. But it is very necessary, and most profitable,
that he who has done the one, should, if he can, add the other, that so the
rule of faith, and the power of godliness may be advanced together. This last
(which we here offer to you) is his present subject, which the good Lord set on
effectually upon you and us, that this famous and most deservedly-honoured
Lamp, as well as we, may the more rejoice in that great day of our Lord Jesus
Christ, in whom we cordially sign our selves

THE FIRST PART.
CHAP. I. The PREFACE, Showing the Argument, Necessity, Vtility, Difficulty,
and Project of this Work.
THat great Saint Augustine, Aug. de Civit. Dei, Initio.
with singular judgment fashioneth his admired defense of the Christian faith,
against the calumnies of Heathens, in a delineation of two opposite Cities; the
one heavenly, the other of the earth; the one the City of God, the other of
Satan: Upon the enmity of these two Cities and and citizens thereof, a great
part of the Scripture discourses, as being a perpetual Comment upon that first
Gospel Genesis 3.15
delivered in Paradise immediately after the fall, declaring the effects of
that hostility in the successive encounters of the seed of the woman with the
seed of the Serpent. Whereof Saint John in his Revelation (the last book of
Scripture) seems to give account, thus deciphering the state of the latter
times; Rev. 12 17
Then the Dragon was wroth with the woman, and went and made war with the
remnant of her seed, which keep the Commandments of God, and have the Testimony
of Jesus Christ: An enmity, not only between their persons; but also and more
frequently between their courses and qualities. A war waged not only in set
battles, under banners displayed, as between Exodus 17. fin.
Israel and Amaleck; or in single encounters, as between 1 John 3.12
Abel and Cain, Gal. 4.29
Isaac and Ishmael; but more commonly, and with no less fury, in the confines
of divine virtue and vice; where both the wicked usurp upon the portion of the
godly, and the children of God (through infirmity) partake with the men of this
world; and as the Psalmist says Psalm 73.10
turn hither; to see these opposites as it were in the middle of conflict,
mixed pell mell one among another, it were no very easy thing to distinguish
them; But to see them, as in a time of truce, pass too and fro out of the one
Camp into the other, yea, and that in the arms and abiliments each of other
(yet with hearts as far asunder, as if they were in the skirmish;) here to
discern between Christ's party and Satan's, is worth the while, but this is not
a task for every looker on. For their sakes therefore, who desire to understand
the difference between these parties, in their nearest approaches and
resemblances, I have taken in hand this work. Wherein, leaving the apparent
contrarieties of virtues and vices (so evident in the examples of holy and of
wicked men) I propound to my self nicer differences, concerning the seeming
virtues of the wicked, and the infirmities of Gods children. Here we shall see
how the wicked at their best, come short of true goodness; and how Gods
children, at their worst, are exempted from reigning wickedness. The sum of
the whole.
Here the mock-vertues of wicked men are propounded for our caution, and the
infirmities of the faithful for our consolation. Divided into two parts.
But, first we will compare the hypocrite in his best shows, with a regenerate
man living according to his rule; to frustrate the wicked man's encroachments on
the lot of the righteous: and after (in another part) we will compare the
child of God in his infirmities with the wicked man living under the power of
sin; that we may distinguish the weaknesses of Saints, from the wilful
wanderings of the ungodly; Heb 6.3
and this will we do if God permit.

Let no man think this a needless or unseasonable argument; say not, these are
days wherein none will be hypocrites, The necessity of this Argument.
for what shall they get to dissemble? Hypocrisy has more irons in the fire
then one; and even they, who boast of plain dealing, and greatest sincerity,
are many times the greatest dissemblers. Never, I am sure, was there more need
to discern, and divide our selves Numb. 16.26
from the Tabernacles of wicked men; for now the Z^ch. 5.8
Ephah of wickedness is full and overfloweth. Never more cause for them that
Mal. 3.16
fear the Lord, to speak in his behalf every one to his neighbor, because
iniquity never stood more boldly in competition with goodness, nor hypocrisy
more gaudy in the colors of sincerity: Indeed evil days can ill brook
differences, and the worse, the less. For they that are vile in Gods eyes, are
always precious in their own, and therefore whatever discovers, offends. But
our warrant is beyond exception. The Lord that put the enmity between the seed
of the woman, and the seed of the Serpent, has commanded, not only Pastors in
preaching, if they will be Jer. 15.19
after his mouth, but also private Christians, as many as will Psalm 15.4
dwell in his holy hill, to put a difference between the precious and the vile,
to despise the one, and honor the other.

But what! is not Numb 16.3
all the Congregation holy? yea every one of them; I grant, Jerem. 2.3.
Israel is an hallowed thing, but herein are found many unhallowed ones: not
only the world swarmeth with Gods enemies, but even the Church visible is too
shamefully fruitful of a wicked and adulterous seed. Many borne in marriage,
but not of marriage; Esaias 57 3.
they call the Church their Mother, but are not of that Fatherhood, of which
are all the Elect Ephesians. 3.15
both in heaven and earth. No such enemies to him that is borne of the Spirit,
as they, who in the same Family, are borne after the flesh. It cannot be (says
our Savior Luke 13.33 Aug. in Apoc. hom. 14.
that a Prophet shall perish out of Jerusalem; that is (as Saint Augustine
interprets) that good Christians should suffer any persecution, but from evil
Christians. Wherefore not only the wild boars must be chased, but we must also
draw the Cant. 2.15.
foxes out of their earths; even the little foxes, which though they turn not
up the roots, yet they also are spoilers of the vines, seeing our vines have
tender grapes.

The utility.
Hypocrisy is a crime, concerning which, most men are apt to abuse themselves;
and the worst men, others: Themselves in discharging, others in charging: For,
of this sin every wicked person securely discharges himself, and with this
he boldly charge his neighbor And it is a ready salve for a nonplus
(recommended by the practice of Satan Job 1.9.
) and serves every man's turn that is worse then other. For an hypocrite, by
such a man's definition, is he that presumes to be better then I. The not
seeing of hypocrisy in themselves, is the chain whereby Satan holds seduced
souls to the stake of sin; and the reproach of hypocrisy from others, is his
hook in their nostrils, to keep them from true piety. It will therefore be, I
am sure a charitable, Lethargici excituntur phrenetici ligantur, ulcerosi
secantur uruntur, and tamen amantur, Aug. in Ps. 34
and I hope an acceptable aid to such as desire to know themselves, and to be
comely in the eyes of Christ, to hold out this true glass unto them, though
the proud deformed of the world abhor to look into it. Christ has two Dyets of
judgment, the first of distinction, in the preaching of the Gospel, the latter
of retribution in the final day of doom. The judgment of distinction, if we
submit unto it, shall give us assurance of favor in the judgment of
retribution. And it is no small comfort in this confused mixture and Chaos of
men, when Genesis 1.2
darkness is upon the deep, to see yet the Spirit of God moving upon the
waters, making a distinction between the City and citizens of Sion, and of
Babel, and to borrow of the Poet, Secretosque pios, his dantem jura Jehovam.
That seeing we cannot separate in body from wicked men, for the time of this
world, we may so much the rather sever our selves from them in manners, that we
be not hereafter joined with them in punishment. Every man has two things to
look unto more then all the world besides; a body, and a soul: For the one,
every one is either a fool or a Physician; for the other, either a Devil or a
Divine; a Divine, I say in this point especially, that he may be able to
approve himself the Psalm 32.2
^lessed man, to whom the Lord imputes not his sin, and in whose spirit
there is no guile. Unto blessedness therefore is required the judgment and
hatred of hypocrisy, whereto I here endeavor to lend a willing, though a weak
hand.

A subject of no small difficulty; The difficulty
For we do not now lead men through the known regions of virtues and vices, but
rather attempt the discovery of an unknown world, and when we have all done we
shall leave a large Terra incognita for the exercise of after comers. We do not
compare Jacob and Laban, as it were chiding Genesis 31
and opposing; but, we undertake to sever them in their mere stones and
confines. Here evil must be discovered under the show of good, and grace must
be discerned under the cloud of infirmity. As good does not always appear in
the same beauty and brightness, being partly clouded with corruption, partly
Cant. 1.6
Sunburned with affliction: No more does evil always show her self in her
native loathsomeness, but as an old Jezabel fills up her wrinkles with
artificial dawbery. It is not of every judgment to discern good when it is
tainted with evil; or evil, when painted with the color of good; to see grace,
sanctifying grace in Gods child falling, lying, sowning; to see sin, reigning
sin in the hypocrite professing, praying, repenting; deformity is hardly
known under a visor, or beauty under a mask. Solomon himself entering into the
inquest of wisdom and folly, found it very hard and troublesome Eccles. 7.28
; if he (a horseman in comparison) could not attain unto it, what can we
promise, who are feign to walk on foot; or rather, to creep? When two men stand
out one against another at the swords point, what need of senses exercised?
half an eye can see that they are enemies; but fraud in fellowship, enmity
under brotherhood, is not so easily descryed. In matter of faith, some deny the
Son of God, and dene him; not admitting the letter of the word. Infidels
reject both the Old Testament and the New: Jews despise the New, retaining the
Law, but not with reference to the Gospel. The Turks make the New Testament
Old, and Christ, as it were, a Moses unto their Mahomet. In these, who sees
not the contrariety; But there are others, who divide Christ rather then deny
him; admit him in name and profession, but overthrow him in his offices;
receive the Word in the letter and volume, but deny it in the proper and
spiritual sense; in these it is more difficult to distinguish. Likewise in
matter of manners: some professedly abandon all goodness, and delight to be
accounted of the profane and damned crew. Their answer unto Christ is, Matthew.
21.24
I will not: who sees not their wickedness? Other hide their sin under the
vizar of obedience: They say, Ibid. verse 30
I will Sir, yet stir never the more: The former are black devils, these are
white, yet devils too; but because they are white, not so easily discerned.
Nay, they will plead for the price of religion with the most sincere hearted
Christians, as the false 1 Kings 3.
Harlot with the true Mother for the living child.

Wherefore he that will give true judgment, Remedies against that difficulty
must discover the Mother by the affection; which he shall the better do, if he
bring affections of his own to the enquiry. Love and hatred are sharp sighted
in their proper objects. Let us therefore also bring love unto sincerity, and
so shall we the better acknowledge it; 1. To sharpen our sight with love of
goodness and hatred of evil.
and hatred to hypocrisy, so shall we the better detect it.

But because it is hard diving into the hearts of other men; least we should
rove in our discovery, or draw immaginary models, and landskips, wherein a man
sees somewhat, but learns nothing; 2. To use the helps afforded, which are, 1
The light of Scripture
we must make use of such helps as the Lord has afforded for the furnishing of
this card of navigation.

First, we have the lively and operative Word of God, who perfectly sees the
heart of man, and discovers in his Word much of that which he sees. He made
us such as we were, and now discerns what we are; and reveals both unto
them that will search for both in his Word. There is the map of this Microcosme
of ours. The rule and the aberration go together. Arist. Rhet. lib. 1. cap. 1
Verum and verisimile ad eandem pertinent facultatem. Reason can discover no
more but the Coasts of this Country; but Christ can let us see the inland, for
he John 2.25
knows what is in man: Moonlight or candlelight will not distinguish
colors, distances, paintings; by that light all is gold that glistereth: Esaias
8.20
Only daylight discovers counterfeits; only the morning light of the Word
enableth us to detect this imposture of hypocrisy. As those therefore who work
in mines under ground, so must we labor to bring our light from above.

2. The knowledge of our selves.
Secondly, we must search diligently into our own hearts; that, as Physicians
know other men's bodies, so we may know the state of other men's souls the
better, by studying our own, making use of the Wise man's Aphorism Prove. 27.19
As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man. If we say with
Solomon, I and mine heart Eccles. 7.25.
compassed; we shall be able to say with David, Psalm 36.1
wickedness says to the wicked man, in my heart there is no fear of God
before his e es.

3. Inspection of examples.
Thirdly, we must take view of examples recorded, as of Anatomies, wherein by
the dissection of some, the disposition of all men is discovered.

4. Collation of contraries. Eccles. 7.25
Fourthly, as contraries make one another more manifest (for which cause
Solomon, with the study of wisdom, joyneth the search of folly) so here
sincerity being compared with hypocrisy, either part will help us the better
to understand the other. Hypocrisy serving as a foil to the luster of virtue;
and grace as a candle to lighten the dark corners of sin.

5. Discoveries of former travailers.
Fifthly, we may not disavow the help of other labors, who have profitably
touched upon this subject; though none (that I know) in this order, or so
fully. Howsoever, I have been content to come behind, either as a gleaner, or
as he that binds up the sheaves.

6. Prayer for spiritual illumination.
Unto all, and above all we must add fervent prayer unto Christ (who only is
able to take away both scales and mist) that he would vouchsafe once and again
to touch our eyes, that we may see, not as he, who saw men like trees,
confusedly Mar. 8, 24, 25
; but that, Phil. 2.9, 10
abounding in knowledge and all judgment, we may discern of things that
differ; and under the most deceivable appearances, distinguish between good and
evil.

Advertiseme^ts touching the work.
Lastly, to give some account of my pains and project in this work; though
there be no want of books in in this lettered age, wherein Scribimus indecti
may serve for a common Apology: yet books of this nature, which teach a man to
try and know himself, sure I am, there are not too many; wherefore as I hasted
not unto the Press, but rather pressed my talent at home to another, and
another year; so I held it no charity to suppress it. Understand this of the
time wherein he first drew this draught, not of this time of publishing of it.
After two and twenty years employed in the Ministry, wherein many things have
been set to the account of conscience; at last I adventured to commit somewhat
to the charge of memory. Writing is that voice whereby many a faithful witness
being dead, yet speaks; as Elijah 2 Chr. 21.13
after his death prophesied to Jehoram. For though the living confer not to the
dead, yet the dead do thus communicate to the living. I held it time therefore
for me to make up my fardels, and to see if any thing were found worthy to be
made, over to the use of posterity.

Aug. Epist. 1. ad volus.
If any man think the book too large, it is in his own power not to overcharge
himself: considering that (as Saint Augustine writes to Volusian) that which
is written is always at hand to be read, when the Reader is at leisure.
Neither is that a burden, which a man may take up when he pleases, and lay
down when he list. Whereto also the divisions and variety of h^ads (not
depending one on another) will afford commodity. I have endeavored b^evity as
much as might be, without affectation or obscurity; the one odious to my self,
the other prejudicial to the Reader. Indeed I presume a Reader somewhat entered
into the Art and mystery of godliness; and who, having laid the foundation of
saving knowledge, desires to be led forward to perfection. Heb. 6.1


If some things pass the weaker understandings, yet the substance may be
conceived. If most, or all, come short of judicious apprehensions; yet even
they happily may take occasion to set awork their more accurate judgments. If
I have abounded, I hope it is in the matter, not in the style; for I would be
loath to set words on horseback, and let matter lacquey by on foot. Yet some
care of words was requisite for their sakes, who affect not the matter for it
self. For as he says, Pauca meo Gallo, sed quae legate ipsa Lycoris, etc. So to
the cause of piety something is due, but it had need be such as captious
impiety cannot justly contemn. Once it shall content me, that I have not given
words to the world, nor served the Lord and his Church, with that which cost me
nothing. They that find lack of words for explication, may do well to think
there is both an hint for meditation, and place left for a second reading. As
pictures made by Art optique, do only seem to present the image in bulk, but
with the help of the glass, discover many particularities: So these
descriptions, though they may seem a rude draught, being viewed through the
glass of meditation, will happily discover more traces of truth, and tracks of
error then were at first sight apprehended.

If some things seem more proper to another place or Treatise, know that I
would not so abhor from that which they call (...), as to make a raw bone
(...) of Art, consisting only of partitions; or like Procrustes, to frame the
body to the bed, not the bed to body. Many things arise out of the subject
matter; many others fall in by the way of amplification, application, allusion,
etc.

If some things shall (as they are) appear defective, I have to plead for my
self (besides the difficulty before mentioned) the unintermitted course of my
Ministry; which would not allow me that leisure and vacancy, which had
requisite; so that the plough could not stand still for the harrow; but I must
at once, as it were, sorbere and flare. Besides; it was not a single labor,
first to fill the mould till it run over; then to pare away; first to weave,
then to full; first to see what might be said, and then what not to say.

If any shall think that diverse other heads of hypocrisy might have been added
as well as these; let him give one man leave not to say all. It is enough for
me, that I have nailed up the counterfeits that came to my hands, and those
more by many then I at first discovered; this Hydra multiplying her heads in
the very cutting off.

If any shall find lack of application, let such consider, that the whole
Treatise is a direction for the examination of our selves, whether, and how far
forth these weeds are found growing in our gardens. Psalm 110.3
And when we see on the one side true virtues, as the army of Christ marching
in holy beauty, on the other side hypocrisy, 1 Kings 9
the devils Jezabel with her painted visage: Who can but think, that the Lord
calls, saying, Who is on my side, who? that if any belong to this, Jehu,
(though before a servant to that strumpet) he may put to his hand to throw her
down to the ground.

Neither did I much travail to bring confusion into a method, being rather to
bind thorns, then to lay bricks; and finding these hypocrites, in the
driving, to be wild things, like beasts in a fair, many times one on another
back. I have therefore so divided these heads, as to distinguish not men, but
vices; or rather several acts and scenes of the same vice. Wherefore it is not
to be wondered, though many of these characters be coincident to one and the
same wicked man (as one Actor in diverse habits, may play diverse parts;) yea,
sundry of them in measure found in Gods dear children, in whose spirit, though
there be no guile harbored, yet there are relics of hypocrisy (as of all
other sins) not thoroughly abolished. All that I did as touching order, was
for mine own ease; for which I was feign to make use of the stratagem of
Horatius against the Curiatii, to single out and encounter one enemy after
another. For this cause I have cast this former part into several ranks;
referring unto one such hypocrites as do err in the whole kind (as they say)
mistaking or supposing some other thing for Religion; and upon that so bearing
themselves, as if there were no need of Religion. Unto another, such as lay
claim to the virtues and graces that are in Gods children. Unto a third, such
as seem to partake, or rather justle with them in the practice of holy duties.

Here, which to deal with in the first place I greatly reckoned not;
considering that it well enough befitteth a monster to be borne into the world,
and a carcass to be carried out, with his heels forward. But at length it
befell me, as to that noble Roman; the strongest and best breathed enemy came
first to the encounter; to wit, that pack of hypocrites, which foisteth in some
other thing in the stead of Religion; with whom I am now to join issue; but
first, I hope it will not seem absurd, if (after old Homers manner in
describing duels) I bestow a few words upon the nation and pedigree of the
enemy; that is, upon the nature of hypocrisy in general, and upon Satan the
father of hypocrites.

CHAP. II. Of hypocrisy, and of the hypocrite in general.
The names.
THe names of hypocrisy, and Hypocrites are borrowed from the Greek, In which
tongue they primarily signify the profession of a Stage Player, which is to
express in speech, habit and action, not his own person and manners, but his
whom he represents. But in the New Testament, these words are familiarly used
to note the sin and sinner, Pronunciatores personarum alienarum, etc. Aug
of whom we here entreat. Indeed a very Stage Player, acting the part of a
member of Christ, without any portion of sound and saving grace. The Hebrew
words are fetched from a root that signifies to be impi^us or profane, Jer.
3.1, 2
to pollute or defile, to dissemble or counterfeit; whence that of the Prophet
is diversely translated. The earth is defiled, or the earth has deceived, or
dealt hypocritically, Is. 24.5 and 32.6 From (...).
(...) Caneph therefore signifies indifferently an Hypocrite or a wicked man.

The definition. Quisquis se vult videri quod non est hypocrita est. Aug. Aliud
simulans aliud agens, etc. Hi^r n.
We may define an hypocrite to be such a one as covers wickedness under a
cloak of goodness. Tegit sub persona quod est (says Saint Austin) and
ostentat in persona quod non est. Abscondit quod est (says Bernard) quod non
est mentitur. He hides as under a visor or counterfeit, that which he is, that
he may seem in that visor that which he is not: The holy Ghost compares such
to clouds without rain wells without water, trees without fruit. Others have
likened them to harlots, who cover a wrinkled face with parjetting; Jude 12
Greg. Sicut lamiae quibus humana facies, corpus bestiale sic hypocritae etc.
Hieron. Explained in the matter.
to the Ostrich, which has great feathers, but flies not; to flags and
bul-rushes, which grow green to the eye, but bear no fruit.

The matter is large, and of contrary parts, first virtue, and especially
piety, which it seems to put on: Secondly, vice and iniquity which it
concealeth: For hypocrisy is vice in a visor; the face covered is vice; the
visor pretended is virtue; and not any one vice or virtue but all hypocrisy is
a case for all vices, a counterfeit of all virtues.

This is that which has given us occasion to name our hypocrite, sometimes
from the virtue which he counterfeiteth, sometimes from the vice which he
concealeth: This is that which gives Hypocrites place in the Church visible
amongst Gods people, etsi non per virtutem, certe per speciem pietatis, not as
partakers, Aug. in Ps. 106
but as counterfeiters of piety; not as innocent, but as unconvicted of their
iniquity. For hypocrisy is both the Ape of piety, and the mask of sin; for
goodness, the hypocrite is like the Bankrupt, the less substance he has, the
more show he makes; or like the Alchymist, that blows himself and all away in
smoke, to make, not gold, but counterfeit gold, fit for nothing but the Rev. 9.7
locusts crowns. But though hypocrisy err in imitation of virtue, it fails
not in giving perfection to sin: for in every web of sin, whatsoever be the
warp, hypocrisy is the woof; and whatsoever be the dye, this strikes it in
grain. It is a leaven that joyneth it self with the whole mass of iniquity
till all be leavened. Dolus and scelus, subtilty and mischief go together: but
subtilty is the sheet wherein Micah 7.3
men wrap up mischief. As with every mortal disease (they say) a fever is
joined, so with every reigning sin, hypocrisy. Look through all the dominions
of sin, and you shall see that what vice soever is the devils Viceroy,
hypocrisy is his chiefest Statesman.

But above all descriptions our Saviors similitude of a painted Sepulcher,
brings us nearest to the repugnant constitution of this sinner. A painted
T^mb! what so glorious? nature teaches men to put comeliness upon that which
is least comely. I need not mention those Mausoloea and Pyramides, at which the
world to this day wondreth; every man is willing his Tomb should be fairer then
his house, yea, then the rest of the Churches wherein they stand: so Hypocrites
make a fairer show, not only then the common sort of men, but then other
professors; but open these Sepulchers, and their inside is most horrible and
loathsome. No filth like carrion, no carrion like that of a man, death
revelling on him, as the Greeks on dead Hector, so that Abraham had reason to
seek a place to bury his dead out of his sight, whom living, he could not
endure out of his eye. The Hypocrite is both the Tomb and the corpse. Mat. 23.28
ye appear righteous to men (says our Savior) there is the goodly Tomb, but
inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity (there is the carrion
carcass;) Hypocrites, like Tombs, love to be near the Church, but the humble
Luke 18.13
Publican standing afar off is nearer to God then they. Tombs preserve the name
while the man consumes: so hypocrisy maintains a bruit of goodness, while
the wicked hypocrites Rev. 3.1
rot above ground. Tombs give a spectacle to the eye of the beholder, but
cannot give life to the interred; so hypocrisy makes Gal. 6.12
a fair show in the flesh, but the hypocrite remains dead in regard of the
life of God.

The form The form
of hypocrisy consists in apt imitation, and cunning dissimulation. The
hypocrite seeks not to put off sin (that is death to hypocrisy;) but to put on
a cloak or a visor upon sin. Thus the dead bury their dead; dead men bury
their dead works out of other men's sight, not out of their own, much less out
of Gods. An Hypocrite is a man of both worlds; he converseth with the living by
that which he pretends, and with the dead, by that which he concealeth. But
always that is best loved which is concealed, yea, only loved, for the other
is exposed for the safety of this. Herein hypocrisy goes beyond flat lying,
because it is a lie with a pretense, and that you may not find out the truth,
gives you a stale or a mask to gaze upon the whiles. Gehazi was a simple liar,
Thy servant went no whether; Adam was more cunning with his apron of
fig leaves, and excuse upon the woman. He had need be cunning that should
conceal, not only his sin, but the art also whereby he would conceal that
Plurimum artis habere solet simulatio, etc. Hilar. in M^t. Canon. 22
; not only his iniquity, but also his Mat. 23.28
hypocrisy. Tully said of Pompey, that he was a great dissembler, but not able
to hide his dissimulation, but if any want wit, that is not his fault, he wants
no will to hide both. The Ass may be an hypocrite as well as the Fox, though
he cannot so well cover his ears. The devil will bear with him that serves
him as far as he can. Many hypocrites were in our Saviors days, but the
Scribes and Pharisees carried away the prize; many now a days; but the Monks
and Friars bear the bell among the Papists, etc.

all for himself as a perfect self-seeker; seen he would be of men, and that in
the ways of God, not that God may be honored, not that men may be edified,
but that himself may be commended, Quasi in Deum intendit, sed non propter
Deum. He seems to apply himself toward God, but not for God. Hence he is
called (...), James 1.8
a double minded man: and if a man's mind be himself (as the Philosopher says)
then must he be a double man that has an heart and a heart.

The subject of hypocrisy.
The extent of this sin in regard of the subject is very large: For it is a
circumstance of evil cleaving to all sorts of sinners. Hypocrisy is proper to
such quarto modo (as Logicians speak) that is to all, only, and always.

1 All sinners
First, to all, and therefore a wicked man and an hypocrite are not only joined,
but confounded, as we showed in the Etymology of the Hebrew word Caneph: The
holy Ghost speaking by David the most pious, man calls the evil man the
wicked: by Solomon the wisest, he calls him the fool; by Job the most
upright, he terms him the hypocrite: to show that these three, Piety, Wisdom
and Sincerity; and contrariwise wickedness, folly, and hypocrisy, import
under diverse names, one and the same thing; so that in Job Job 17.8
the hypocrite and the innocent are opposed. Take men therefore as men in the
state of corruption, and they are all wicked, all fools, all hypocrites; Psalm
4.2
O ye sons of men, says David, how long will ye love vanity and seek lies?
Esaias 9.17
Every one (says the Prophet) is an hypocrite and wicked; and again, and 33.14
The sinners in Sion are afraid, fear has surprised the hypocrites. All
sinners are hypocrites, (for Jer. 17.9
the heart of man is wicked and deceitful) but most of all the sinners in Sion,
who Esaias 26.10
in the land of uprightness do wickedly. The world is full of hypocrites, for
Psalm 12.2
every man speaks vanity to his neighbor, and the Church is not without
them, for even there also are Deuteronomy. 32.23
children in whom there is no faith. All that are in Covenant with the Lord
should be, (and therefore are styled Deu^. 32.15
) Jeschurum, or upright Esaias 63.8^
children that will not lie: but alas Deuteronomy. 32.5
they have corrupted themselves by their vice, not being his children.
Hypocrisy like Genesis 6
the daughters of men, with a false show of beauty, has corrupted for the most
part the sons of God, and made them also an Esaias 10.6 Est ergo ecclesiae quod
ferat foris gemat intus, Aug. in Ps. 141 2 Only sinners
hypocritical Nation. All they who are only outwardly called, not regenerate,
not sanctified, are among hypocrites. The Church does not only suffer from
enemies abroad, but sorrow for false children at home.

Secondly, only wicked unsanctified men are hypocrites. Satan's City is Esaias
24.10
a City of vanity; but Gods Jerusalem is Zeek. 8.3
a City of truth. A true Israelite is he, John 1.47
in whose spirit is no guile. Thus it pleases the Lord to style and
acknowledge his children, not that they are perfectly purged from this leaven,
but because it prevails not in them. The wicked are not that, the godly are
not all that which they seem. Hypocrisy counterfeiteth grace in the wicked,
weakeneth and disturbeth grace in the regenerate; in them it serves instead of
grace; in these it shouldereth in with grace. If it be hypocrisy (as Saint
Austin says) peccatum vultu tegere, not to be known of our sins by our
looks; we may well add, with the same father, to be without some spot of
hypocrisy is scarce incident to mortality. Hence Satan thinks he has
somewhat to object, even to the best of men. For when he could charge Job with
nothing else, he accused him of hypocrisy, and it had gone ill with that
upright man, if God had not been his merciful Judge. Hence it is that we can
the better look into the close cabinet of the hypocrites false heart; we have
that insight which Adam in innocence had not; we our selves in our state of
nature have plowed with the same heifer. We have a counterpane of the same
instrument, though by a grace in great part cancelled. But hypocrisy reigns
not in Gods children: Hence it is a character of the blessed and justified man,
in whose spirit there is no guile, a true Israelite, one of Gods Israel is he,
that is Psalm 73.1 and 125.4
pure and true in heart. Thus hypocrisy is among natural men, an hereditary;
and (I may say) ecumenical disease; in men outwardly called, belonging only to
the Church visible, an epidemical disease, common, yet adventitious, not of the
nature of their calling; in the regenerate it is an ill humor, but not a
disease or sickness, because it prevails not to overthrow the functions of
spiritual life. Every man therefore in the world is either an Israelite or an
hypocrite: Every man in the Church is either of Gods Israel, or of the devils
army, but the Church hypocrite is of the Rev. 11.7
Dragons Angels.

Thirdly, the wicked man is perpetually an hypocrite. Hypocrisy is both
natural and native in him. The wicked (says David Psalm 58.3
) are strangers from the womb, 3. Sinners always hypocrites
from the belly have they strayed, speaking lies. It is a wonder to see how
soon little ones can learn to sew their fig leaves, and the elder still the
more cunning. The whole life of man unregenerate, is an interlude. Augustus
dying, asked his friends, what think you? have we well acted the interlude of
life? The New Birth only makes a man live in good earnest; puts on Romans 12.9
love without dissimulation, James 3 17
wisdom without hypocrisy. Grace is unto the soul a change of raiment; the
skin of the Lamb for fig leaves, sincerity for hypocrisy; else nothing but
death and judgment can pull off the visor, and strip conscience of this linsey
woolsey coat. Till then the whole life is a lie; for as a lie is the hypocrisy
of the tongue, so hypocrisy is the lie of the life. A false heart finds
means to tell a lie to the eye as well as to the ear.

The greatness of this sin The greatness of this sin.
is too much for our survey. The matter formerly handled shows it to be a
double iniquity, sin upon sin, a sinful covering of evil with pretense of
good; and what more sinful then to make good a cover for evil? They Esaias 30.1
cover (says the Lord) with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may
lay sin upon sin; a covering indeed not of Gods Spirit, whose office is
John 16.8.
to discover sin. God hates all simulation and counterfeisance; most of all,
that of his own image. The Author of truth brooks no forgery. Tertul. de
spectac.
Adulterium est apud illum omne quod fingitur, says Tertullian. All
counterfeiting is with him, adultery, the abuse of his own bed. Our Savior in
the Gospel never speaks of hypocrisy without detestation; never calls any
man hypocrite but with indignation. Other sins, in comparison, he accounts
M^t. 7.5
moats; but this is a beam in the eye. Si trabs in oculo, strues in cord; a
beam in the eye betokens a heap in the heart: If the receiver be worse then the
thief; hypocrisy must be worse then any sin, yea, then all sins, for it is
the common abettor, concealer, patron, and pandar of sins; It is a color for
covetousness, a canopy for uncleanness, Prove. 26.84
a dark lantern for malice, a vault for treason, a disguise for Ambition, a
visor for Atheism; in a word, a horse full of Greek, or rather a Sinon to
bring in the horse. Every sin is made worse by hypocrisy; for this makes of an
enemy a traitor, Every reigning sin is a Jebusite, but hypocrisy is a
Jesuit; not only a traitor, but making all traitors that entertain him.

It is a manifest wrong to our neighbor whom we delude, In regard, 1 Of other
men
as the witch did Saul with 1 Samuel 28
a devil instead of a Samuel. Every man bears some respect to the opinion of
others, and would (if it might be) approve himself; which because wicked men
will not do by goodness, they seek to do that by a show of goodness;
therefore even the whorish woman when she has eaten Prove. 30.20
she wipeth her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness. It crosses the
royal Law, do as ye would be done by, I have known many (says Saint Augustine)
were willing to deceive, Confess. lib. 10 cap. 23
but never any willing to be deceived. And which is farthest from ingenuity, it
abuses rather friends then enemies; for they are aptest to err on the
favorable side. Neither is the delusion without danger, for as the Apostle
says of sin, it Romans 7.11
deceives, that it may kill: so hypocrisy deludes, that it may corrupt. And
(as those locusts) it has not only the Rev. 9.7, 8, 10
face of a man, and hair of a woman, that it may insinuate, but also the teeth
of a lion, and tail of a scorpion, that it may destroy.

It is that by which a man chiefly wrongeth himself, deluding his own
conscience, 2. Of the sinner himself
or rather deriding her to her face, by calling evil good, and good evil; for
as it gives an outside of virtue to the world instead of vice; so it gives an
inside of vice to the conscience instead of virtue. There is no hypocrite so
cunning as to hide himself absolutely from himself, but that he sees his heart
abhorres from the Lord, Ab intima luce, ad fraudulenta^ simulatioues, etc. Aug.
de Genes. contr. Manich. l. 2. c. 15
and that he does but dally with him, giving that which his heart tells him,
God is not satisfied with, and withholding that which his heart tells him God
chiefly calls for, that is the heart it self. He knows he ought to be what he
seems, else why should he affect it? He knows he is not what he ought to be,
else why should he counterfeit it? Thus mentitur iniquitas sibi. Esaias 28.20
The bed is shorter then that he can stretch himself on it, and the covering
narrower then that he can wrap himself in it.

3. Of God.
But above all consider how audatious this sin is, that undertaketh to delude
the Lord himself. For with him the heart has to do. Acts 5 4 Esaias 57.11 and
59.13
Thou have not lied (says the Apostle) unto men, but unto God. Adam had no
sooner sinned, but he had learnt to hide his head in a bush, his shame with
fig leaves, and his sin with an excuse, To sin, and to hide his sin, are
two lines of the same first lesson of Satan, two properties of an heart
estranged from God, and now at once become wicked and deceitful. The hypocrite
(as a powder-traitor Esaias 29.15
) diggeth deep to hide his counsel from the Lord; he is not afraid to face down
the Lord with a lie, to hide sin under Gods Mal. 2.16
own garment, pretending Law for lust. No sinner brings sin so near the
Lord, and as it were under his nose, as the hypocrite does. It opposes God in
his being, for this is but a show; in his simplicity, for this is double; in
his truth, for this is a lie; in his judiciary power, for this makes man his
Judge; in his holiness, for this is impurity; and that (which is most
abominable) covered with holiness. The Lord in the old Law could not abide any
emblems of hypocrisy; Deuteronomy. ^2.11 Lev. 11.4 and 19.19.
the linsey-woolsey coat; the hollow footest beast; the missellane corn, the
plowing with an ox and ass together; the ingendring of beasts of diverse
kinds; all to show how much he abhors the mixture of contrarieties or
dissentanies in our profession and practice.

Of all sinners the hypocrite most hardly and most rarely repents; The
hypocrite rarely repents
He Jer 8.5
holds fast deceit, and refuses to return; He makes Esaias 28.15.
falsehood his refuge: He has so many prentences and evasions, that he shifteth
off the necessity of repentance. It is no easy matter to convince an
hypocrite, especially of his hypocrisy. It is like an apostume in the breast,
so much the more dangerous as it is more inward; and as rocks under water are
more perilous then those which appear; so this covert makes sin the less
heeded, and the more pernicious. David from adultery, Peter from apostasy; yea,
Manasseh from idolatry returned to God by repentance. But Judas, Simon Magus,
Demas never returned. Mat. 21.31
Publicans and harlots are more easily converted, because more easily
convinced. Hypocrisy is most like an hectique fever, hard to be cured; whiles
it is curable, it is hard to be discovered; when easy to be discovered, it is
hard to be cured, for being discovered, it degenerateth into prophannesse and
Atheism, or into despair, with the hypocrite, shame once found, is ever lost:
For how can that man look God in the face, with whom he has so shamefully
dissembled?

Reasons why the Lord tolera^eth hypocrites.
But some may say, why then does the Lord suffer hypocrites, especially in his
Church, seeing they are so hurtful, and not unknown unto him? To whom I answer,
the Lord has more Reasons of his actions then he always will impart unto us
Job 33.13
; notwithstanding of this, he reveals many, of which these are some.

Nil ultra, thus far and no farther; there the true Christian must write Plus
ultra, I have not yet attained, there is more to be done: Mat. 5.20
Except your righteousness (says our Savior) exceed the righteousness of
the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven.

way-marks toward Heaven, though not as way-mates: like Lots wife in the way
to Zoar; though with her face to Sodom.

Elias, that he were left alone to defend the cause of God.

the Table; so hypocrites are an outward strength to Christ's party in this
world, though excluded out of heaven

Fifthly, as Apes (some say) in the East countries are made to gather spices,
and Judas preaching, Wise men (much more the only wise God) can make use of
such as are sufficient, though unfaithful.

Sixthly, as there are many counterfeit gemmes, yet retained for ornament, so
the Esaias 49.18
dress his Spouse to the eye of the world. Gemmes of use (as watches and
coins) must be true, or else they are nothing worth; but these that are for
show only, may serve, though they be counterfeit; even as similitudes, as well
borrowed from a fiction, as taken from a thing in being, serve to illustrate.

Seventhly, they serve to give testimony to the truth. Goodness gains so much
Numb. 23.10
the lot of the righteous: And it is a powerful proof that comes from the
mouth of an enemy, when they who refuse to be, yet choose to seem virtuous.

Eighthly, They serve to show Gods bounty and hospitality, who in the Church
Mat. 22.10 Luke 14.23
, as well foes as friends, that the house may be filled, and the wedding
furnished.

Ninthly, they serve to terrify the enemy, for which purpose, as the
Canaanites Exodus 23.29
; so hypocrites are tolerated in the Church least infidels should break in; and
as in a siege, sometimes they have set up men's clothes stuffed with hraw to make
the enemy afraid of their number; so hypocrites help to amuse the assailants,
and hide the paucity of true defendants; and it is well if a Poppet may excuse
a David, Genesis 14
Aner, Eshcol and Mamre helped Abraham, though they went for the spoil, and he
for the cause.

Lastly, as in Rome the wise Senators would not have the slaves distinguished
in attire

For these and the like Reasons the Lord vouchsafes a connivance to hypocrites
in the time of this life, saving that he brings to light now one of them, Why
at times the Lord discovers them.
and then another, as Judas, Simon Magus, Ananias) to serve, as malefactors
unto the Anatomists, that by dissection of some, the disease of many may be
discovered, and the cure facilitated: Or as men use crows when they have killed
them, to hang them up to make others afraid. For as concealed, they are nausea
Christi, the abhorrency of Christ; so discovered, they are vomitus Ecclesiae,
the vomit of the Church.

And this is my intent in this whole Treatise, Application
that by the discovery of hypocrisy in many particular kinds and subjects, we
may all learn how to carry our selves as far as may be from the contagion of
this sin.

To this end, first, we must not hastily call any man hypocrite, 1. Charge no
man rashly with this sin.
till we see the beam in his eye; for that were to enter upon Gods Prerogative
Jerem. 17.10
who only knows the heart. None so ready to fasten this imputation on others,
as they that are privy to it in themselves. We use to say, it is ill halting
before creeples, and women whose beauty is counterfeit, and honesty justly
suspected, are ready to say others are painted, and to call whore first; Satan
the arch-hypocrite charged Job with Job 1.9.
dissimulation. And we see the world (whether out of ignorance, emulation, or
malice) does thus nip in the head all forwardness of profession. But I hope to
show that hypocrisy is most common and most powerful where it is least
mistrusted. Not they that are white are hypocrites, but they that are whited;
not the fair, but they whose beauty is painted. If any be an hypocrite, and
thou discern him not, he abuses thy judgment of charity; but at his own
peril, not thine; nay, it is a comfort to Gods party, and a token of good times
when there are many hypocrites. When David prospered and prevailed, the Psalm
18.14
strange children (though fainedly) submited themselves unto him. The Cukoe and
the Swallow are not the best birds yet few birds are better welcome, because
they give us the good time of the year; the evil and dangerous days are those
wherein vice pulls off her visor, when wicked men carry their condemnation in
their forehead, when they Esaias 3.9.
declare their sin as Sodom, and hide it not; in the mean time, as blessed
Paul rejoiced that Phil. 1.18.
Christ was any way preached; so let us be glad that Religion is in any sort
professed. Let the hypocrite (if he will needs) condemn himself whiles he
admonishes us. He is condemned of himself, because (for his credit) he will
not seem what he is: He admonishes us what we ought to be, because he thinks
it for his credit, to seem what he is not. The first is a secret confession of
his own wickedness, the latter is a testimony unto goodness, even from the
enemy of goodness. If her enemies commend and court her, let her friends and
subjects both love and serve her.

Secondly, because hypocrisy is so general (and as I may say generical) let us
for our own safety Mat. 10.17
beware of men; 2 Beware of men.
our Savior did not commit himself to men John 2. fin.
; because he knew what was in man: we have need of the same caution for a
contrary reason, because we know not what is in man; hope the best according to
charity; judge in favor according to probability; but keep thy self out of
danger of the worst, according to the rule of Christian prudence; for it is
better thou should lose the fruit of thy charity, then forfeit thy safety.

Thirdly, above all hypocrites abroad, take heed of the hypocrite at home. 3.
Take heed of the hypocrite at home.
Take heed (says Moses, Deuteronomy. 11.16
) least your own hearts deceive you; there is the greatest danger, because that
is the greatest impostor. If a cunning counterfeit abuse thee, he cannot hurt
thee; but if a Esaias 44.20
seduced heart deceive thee, thou must needs feed on ashes. How can thou
deliver thine own soul? or as much as say, is there not a lie in my right hand?
Neither man, woman, nor devil can deceive thee with danger to thy soul, unless
thine own heart be in the plot: Only by this a man becomes a seducer, a devil
to himself. Prove. 4.23
Keep thine heart, therefore, above all keepings, and from this above all
corruptions. Thou art Gods Temple, make not thy self a Tomb, drive not out of
doors the quickening spirit of grace and truth to make room for a rotten
carcass of sin, an evil heart of unfaithfulness Heb. 3.12
. Be as the Kings daughter, glorious within Psalm 45.13
, whatsoever face thou show to the world: and as the rich Merchant who has
little in his shop, but much in his warehouses and counting house. Be content
(with the Church) rather to be Cant. 1.4, 5
black and Sunburned, then to wear this mask of hypocrisy; remember, Christ
looks in at the casement of conscience, and says, I know thy works. Cast off
the cloak of shame, no man pretends Religion without truth, but to hide some
monster of impiety which he is ashamed the world should see; and art thou not
ashamed that Christ should see it? Fear thou not those eyes like flames of
fire, to none more terrible then to the hypocrite, if ever thou meanest to
repent, take off this bolt that shuts out grace, demolish this fort of Satan,
stop up these starting holes of sin. Be once persuaded that there is nothing so
good, as to be truly good, and whatsoever thou would seem to others that be
in the sight of God, and of thine own conscience; for this (as Socrates wisely
admonished) is the most compendious way to virtue.

CHAP. III. Of Satan the Arch-hypocrite, and Father of hypocrites.
WHen the multitude wondering at the sudden chang, said, 1 Samuel 10.11 12
is Saul also among the Prophets? one of the same place answered, But who is
their Father? intimating that God, the Father of Prophets, was able to make
Saul himself to Prophecy. Semblably, if any shall stand amazed at this
multiplicity of hypocrites, let him consider but who is their Father, and he
shall see a sufficient reason, both why they are so many, and why so wily.
Hypocrisy is the devils dance, the Devil therefore may well lead the ring,
which consists only of his own children: It is Pompa diaboli, the Devils
pageant, therefore well may he be the Choragus, the leader of it. The Devil, I
say, is both the architect and archetipe; the first forger, and the prime
pattern or idea of this Mystery; John 8.44
a liar, and the Father thereof.

But we must sever these Propositions, and handle them apart: Showing, First,
how he is the chief hypocrite. Secondly, how he makes and begets hypocrites.

Touching the former, it is manifest, that howsoever from men we rise to Satan
to search the fountain of hypocrisy; yet from him to any other we cannot
ascend. First Satan the Arch-hypocrite His fall.
He corrupts men, (as we shall hear) but who corrupted him? none but himself,
not he that made him, for the Lord made all things good, and Angels in the
highest degree of created goodness; yea, of truth also; for in that John 8.44
he abode not in the truth, it follows that he was initiated and had his
original in the truth: But from that truth he fell of his own accord and motion
without any tempter, or devil to seduce him; from whence it seems reasonable
that God should leave him and his cursed accomplices without any means of remedy,
or hope of redemption, though the same God afforded favor to man who had been
seduced by that evil one.

Being thus fallen from the integrity of his creation, and become an enemy to
his Creator; he with his party of evil Angels, His malice against God.
attempted to set up a contrary Kingdom of sin unto that of God and goodness;
whereto not being able to draw any of those blessed spirits which had not
joined with him in his apostasy; he (being confined to these Ephesians. 2.2 2. Man
for Gods sake. Diabolus invidia, and periit primus, and perdidit, Cypr. Epist.
18 But covered with hypocrisy.
elementary and sublunary natures) fixed the eye of his envy upon man, as best
resembling, in wisdom and holiness, that God that had created him: him
therefore he hated as a Satan; hating, he sought to destroy him, as Abaddon and
Apollyon. And because he could not lay hands on him without sentence from the
Judge, he determined, as a devil to accuse him, and that he might have whereof
to accuse him, he as the tempter resolved to seduce him. Finally, that his
tentations might pass unsuspected, unheeded, as the Arch-hypocrite, he covered
them with fraud and dissimulation: ^o here the generation of hypocrisy; Satan's
envy at man's felicity begat malice; malice begat mischief; mischief required
accusation; accusation demanded temptation, temptation called in hypocrisy.
For if he should have told what he was, whence he came, and whereabout he went,
Mat. 4. Zech. 3 Disguising, 1. Himself.
he well knew he should have received no better answer from man then he had
from Michael our Prince: Avoid Satan, the Lord reprove thee Satan; he therefore
disguised both himself and his errand: Himself in the body of the Serpent, a
creature, as in harmless subtilty more near to man, so (by likelihood) in his
mixture of colors more specious and delightful to the eye then the rest of
bodily creatures. This instrument he managed, not as a trunk through which, but
as the mouth by which he spoke; he being as the soul, the Serpent as his body.
Therefore the holy Ghost by Moses taking him in this disguise, says of him,
The Serpent spoke, the Serpent was accursed, and (by the Apostle) the Serpent
beguiled Eve by his subtilty. The Serpent ever since has born that reproach,
not only inheriting the hatred of mankind, but also in being an everlasting
emblem of diabolical malice and subtilty.

In like manner he disguised his errand: 2 His errand.
for coming to murder, it behoved him to lie; for he knew he could not murder
man without his own consent, and that must be won with a color of friendship.
Wherefore he pretends greater care of our felicity then was in God himself;
and what the Lord had (as should seem) through envy concealed, he (as a perfect
friend that slighted his Lords favor in behalf of his fellow servant) came
secretly to intimate: who would have dreamt of a devil in all this?

But this is not all, for being fleshed with success of his first attempt in
the fall of mankind, Since the promise of redemption, he redoubleth his
malice and fraud.
though that pleased God to propound an antidote against this poison, unto the
seed of the woman from out of the seed of the woman, yet he gave not over his
cursed enterprise, but has ever since endeavored by the same Art to increase
transgressors amonst men, and transgressions against God: Therefore he is said
(by our Savior) to be a manslayer, not in the beginning only, but also John
8.44
from the beginning; man is the perpetual object of his malicious assaults, and
now the more hated, because God showed more love in giving his Son, not only to
take Prove. 8.31
delights, but also (in the fullness of time Heb. 2.16
) to take part with the children of men, Falen Angels, being for ever left
forlorn.

This made him to set a work all his engines for the advancement of his damned
party, and to make use of all his furniture for so desperate a design, that he
might be a Mediator of death, (as Saint Austine speaks) in opposition In
opposition to Christ.
to him that was to be the Mediator of life. He therefore labored, not only
to lead into captivity particular souls, but also to disturb and distract all
societies of men. For it his task and trade to sow dissension in families,
sedition in States, schism in Churches. And here especially he enforces
himself to Mat. 13.19
pick up the seed of the Word as much as he can come by, to 1 These. 5.3
resist and hinder the sowers, to mix his own Mat. 13.25
tares of error with the Lords pure wheat of truth and sound doctrine, for the
dismaying of the weak, and the perverting of unstable souls.

Unto this war with the seed of the woman, his furniture His furniture of
is exceeding great and dreadful; being a Luke 11.21
strong man armed, and not without associates, and (which is above all) expert
in all kinds of stratagems to circomvent and destroy.

His strength 1. Strength
consists in the ability of his angelical nature, which (though much empaired
by his fall, as we may conjecture by what we lost in Adam our selves, and
therefore far short of the power of elect Angels) remains too strong and
powerful for us to encounter. By this, though he be not wise, yet he is
exceeding cunnig and crafty to do mischief, Aug. in Psalm. 90 Daemones vafri
sunt, non sapientes.
subjecting his wit to his will; and of Demon a spirit, becoming a Cacodaemon,
an evil spirit; by this he is able to insinuate himself, not only into
elementary bodies, as he did into the Serpents, but also into the closet of
reasonable souls. For though he knows not properly and directly the thoughts
of man's heart, yet by many conjectures he can perilously aim at them, and by
fantasmes and familiar suggestions offer what he pleases unto the view of our
understanding.

Unto this his native strength is every day added the Armor 2. Armor
of experience, which by long use, as by much hammering, is more and more
confirmed. What may not he now hope to effect upon us, who prevailed with our
first parents, when they were wiser, and himself a novice. And if a little
tract of age and exercise gives us more insights into humane affairs, must
not he needs be more cunning then any Friar, who knows both his own sins, and
most of ours also; and is unto all wicked men, from father to son as wicked
men, a ghostly father?

Neither is he without the assistance of auxiliary forces, he has in every of
his our own flesh as a traiterous party to favor his attempts, whereby he
pleads a kind of possession in all the sons of Adam. Only the second Adam was
able to say, Now comes the Prince of this world and has naught in me John
14.30
; as for the world it is his Arsenal of munition, his shop of vanity, his pack
of trumpery. As Ulysses in Scyros, among other knacks for Ladies, had a sword
to discover Achilles, and train him to Troy: so Satan has in this his
warehouse of the world a lure for every gazing soul; for the sensual pleasure,
for the muckworm wealth, for the ambitious honor, for the curious science,
that none who may either increase or advance his Kingdom, may escape.

But his art in disguising his malicious purpose, and in fitting his several
tentations, His arts in disguising his tentations.
is most observable; herein his hypocrisy chiefly appears, and that he is
the chief of hypocrites; For as his will to do mischief is more, so is his wit;
and as he has more wickedness to conceive, so is he more cunning to conceal
it. If all hypocrites be actors, he is a very Roscius. When he speaks a lie,
then he speaks of his own (says our Savior); but it is either not as a lie;
or not as his own. The lie owneth him, but he will not be seen to own the lie,
yet he makes it so much the more his own, by laying a counterfeit color of
truth upon that. An Angel of darkness he is, but seldom so appears; nay, he
transformes himself into an Angel of light; we must not imagine that he so seems
by assuming any visible shape, but by guilding over his suggestions, that they
may seem and savor not of hell, but of heaven; not of diabolical darkness and
filthiness, but of angelical purity and light. If light be made to serve unto
darkness, oh how great is that darkness? Let us therefore take a view of some
of his most noted and usual artifices by which he both shrewdeth from, and
insinuates himself unto those whom he would deceive.

First, he hides his malicious purpose, 1. Hiding his purpose.
till it be too late to prevent it. We have heard partly before, how first, he
plays the Tempter; secondly, the Devil; thirdly, the Satan. First, he eggeth
men to sin as a pandar. Secondly, he accuses them as a Promotor. Thirdly, he
tormenteth them as an Executioner. First, he makes use of sin which is the
sting. Secondly, of the Law, which gives strength to sin. Thirdly, of death
and hell, which is the hire of sin and curse of the Law; Else his labor were
in vain; for without sin no Law 1 Timothy 1.9
, without Law no condemnation; There is much subtilty in this ordering of his
battalions; but yet this is not all, for he can craftily cover all these, and
in all play all hide. He can cover hatred by dissimulation, accusation by
soothing, and temptation by a show of truth and goodness, as shall appear. In
the mean time we see how he does Serpere creep and grow upon us ere we be
aware, and as we hear the noise of the Organ, but see not the Organist; so we
shall hear from his Instruments, what is for his purpose, but have no sight of
him, till he sees his time.

Secondly, per aliena (says Saint Augustine) ducit ad sua. He borrows
somewhat of Gods 2. Borrowing of Gods. Aug. in Encherid. cap. 30.
to draw us unto himself. As Sophisters take premises of truth to infer a false
conclusion. When the fallacy is in the form, it is not so easily perceived. He
has John 8.44
no truth in him, yet he utters many truths, but always with purpose to
conclude a lie; and puts on truth, as the false Prophets did Zech. 13.4
a rough garment to deceive. No counterfeit will pass without some mixture or
superinducture of pure metal; no falsehood without some tincture of truth; no
evil without some luster of good.

Thirdly, he tempereth counterfeit honey with true and proper gall; 3.
Tempering honey with his gall. Bern. Ep. 82
Omni absynthio amariorem dulcedinem infundit (says Saint Bernard;) and hereby
many times he beguileth the taste even of spiritual men, promising doubtful
delights, to debar them from certain comforts; not purposing to give them what
they vainly expect, but to take from them what they fruitfully enjoy and by
seeming good, to embark them into certain evil: Peter wist not what he said,
when he would make Tabernacles on Mount Tabor; not they what they do, who upon
less cause have undervalued the profitable pains of action for the affected
ease and imaginary glory of contemplation. But Satan well knows what he
maliciously intends, which is, Aug. Hom. 35 Praepinavit per astutias suas
mortem homini.
to defraud the Church of their service, and themselves of their reward; yea,
by this subtilty he caroused death to us all in Adam, under color to bring us
nearer unto God; as the traiterous Monk poisoned his Liege Lord by drinking an
health to him.

4 Using stratagems, as a Fowler.
Fourthly, he makes not a fair open war against us, but (as those that make
booty their only end) descends to all kinds of theevish stratagems. Solomon
compares the robber to a Prove. 1.16, 17
fowler: Let us see a little how this fowler bestirreth himself.

1. He has his nets and pitfals His nets and pit-fals.
in every path, or by the high-way-side at least, to catch them who never so
little straggle from the path of uprightness. And as men (says Saint
Augustine) by casting stones into the hedge, Aug. in Ps. 90
drive the bird into the net that stands by; so Satan, by the reproaches,
either of malicious enemies, or loose professors, drives many a one out of the
way of righteousness into the Acts 8.23. Prove. 29.6 Prove. 5.22.
bands of iniquity; wherein, without the special mercy of God they are holden
unto destruction.

2. He has his calls His calls.
of evil counselors, Prove. 1.10
Come with us, cast in thy lot, etc. by which he brings many to the bush.

3. He has his several baits His baits.
of pleasure, profit, honor to inveigle us; yea, and (in show) of honesty too
to delude us.

4. He has his stales, His stales.
not only dead stales, sinners taken and slain, and now stuffed and set up to
take others (as Eccles. 9.18
one sinner destroys much good) but also living stales, Diab ut plurimos
fallat, etiam bonos in potestate se habere confingit Aug Quae. ex vet. Testam.
cap. 27.
that is, the Examples of the falls of Gods children, Noah, Lot, David, Peter,
and others, of whom he makes the world believe that they were willingly in his
power, and do invite others to the like liberty in sinning; whereas they were
with him but as Romans 7.24
prisoners striving and mourning to be delivered, and are now by Gods Spirit
set forth unto us, not as warrants to practice, but as warnings to avoid the
like errors. Thus he is like Pirates that rob under the colors of those whom
they have surprised.

5. He has his stalking horses His stalking horses.
to hide him while he shoots at us. Even good men are abused to bring his
tentations the nearer, as Mat. 16.22, 23
Peter to withdraw our Savior from his passion; and Jobs three friends to
remove him from his patience.

His gazing stocks.
6. He brings men to agaze, that while they look at others passing by, he may
have the fairer mark at them. Thus the Pharisee gazing at the Luke 18.11
Publican, and denying his sins, was not aware of pride that pierced him to the
heart. Thus many fall into schism, while they have their eye upon nothing, but
either the heresies of the Romanists, or the defects of Churches Evangelical.

5. Working on predispositions.
Fifthly, it is a special point of his policy, either to prepare, or to expect
some predispositions in the subject, before he do give the assault: Courtiers
and Politicians make great use of this art to know those, Molles aditus,
seasonable and advantageous accesses, which give opportunity to designs. Joab
was not to seek of this craft when he would bring Absolon to 2 Samuel 14
Court; for first, he perceived that the Kings heart was toward him, and yet
for all that he thought fit to prepare him with a made tale of a woman of
Tekoah: but Satan is his Crafts-master in this point, and the opportunities he
expects, or works, are

1. Ignorance, or (which is all one) forgetfulness, Ignorance or forgetfulness.
whereby he takes or makes men disarmed of that sword of the Spirit which
should repel him; and either finds them blind, or 2 Cor. 4.3, 4
blindes the eyes of their minds, that the light may not shine unto them which
should discover him. The Philistines had too much advantage of the Israelites
when they kept them all without weapons, and it is wisdom (as we say) to
assault on the blind side.

2. Security; Security.
when Prove. 28.14
fear, the watchman of the soul is asleep, the Fowler first emboldeneth the
birds, and then spreads his nets; so Satan first removed the fear of death,
Genesis 3.
ye shall not surely die; and then laid for the prey. There is always some
mischief in hatching, when Satan is quiet and stirs not.

3. Idleness, Idleness.
when the bow of the mind is unbent, and men give themselves to keep the
devils holiday. 2 Samuel 11.
Res age, tutus cris; business is a barricado to tentations. When David went
not forth to the war 2 Samuel 11.
but sent Joab and made much of himself at home, then Satan drew him into the
snare of lust.

4. Unwarrantable solitariness; Solitariness:
woeful experience approves that of the Wise man, Woe to him that is alone:
Deserts are the devils dunghill upon which our Savior (I know not whether any
other) found, and foiled him; he had need be an Angel that chooses always to
be alone, lest Satan make a Devil of him.

5. Some notable distress: Distress.
As the Fowler takes the opportunity of hard weather, so does Satan of
weakness, terror, astonishment. Simeon and Levi slew the Shechemites, when
they were sore of their circumcision: So did Satan Achitophel and Judas, when
they were wounded in conscience. Peter was drawn to deny his Lord in the
Priests Hall, beset with enemies and Inquisitors; and David in his fear said,
All men are liars: Count worldly troubles forerunners of spiritual, and
tribulations of tentations; for Satan watches as the Crow upon the sick Sheep.

6. Scruple of conscience; Scruple of conscience.
When a man is afraid of one extreme, Satan thrusts him forward to the other;
If he cannot keep him in security and impenitency, he will urge him to
despair; as we see in the Apostles care for 2 Cor. 2.7, 11
the incestuous; If he cannot put out the fire of zeal in the hearth, he will
labor to make it break out of the chimney: If he cannot turn a man back, he
will seek to shove him on his nose.

His sixth policy is to sort his tentations according to the subject 6. Sorting
his tentations to the subject.
he would work upon: He striveth not against the stream, but uses the tide of
our affections; and chooses to drive the nail that will go; he tempts
ordinarily the young man, not to covetousness, but to pleasures; the old, not
to wantonness, but to worldliness; the rich, not to pilfering, but to
oppression; the poor, not to usury, but to theft; the valiant, not to be base,
but to spoil; the coward, not to ambition, but to treason; the wise, not to
ignorance, but to subtilties; the ignorant, not to curiosity, but to a stupid
and implicit faith; the sick, not to riot, but impatience; the healthful, not
to frowardness, but to intemperance.

Seventhly, he cunningly orders his tentations, 7. Ordering his tentations.
so as the least suspected may make way for the other: His approaches are per
cuneos and cuniculos; As a wood-cleaver first enters a small wedge to let in a
greater till the tree be in pieces; or as one that kindles a fire first, with
a small breath cherishes the weak embers (Impositum cinerem, and sopitos
suscitat ignes) till all be on a light fire, in like manner deals Satan; with
Cain, envy made way to malice, malice to murder, murder to despair: with Judas,
covetousness let in theft theft treason, treason despair, and despair
self-murder: Yea, holy David was thus circumvented; idleness was the harbinger
for lust, lust for adultery, adultery for murder, and murder for dissimulation.
No less, in blessed Saint Peter, presumption produced curiosity, curiosity
fear, fear denial, denial perjury As a Serpent having gotten in his head,
traileth in his whole body; so does Satan easily wind in the greater sins:
when we once have given entrance to the less; so dangerous a thing it is to
hatch the Cockatrices eggs, and to neglect the introductions unto sin by
which, ere men be aware, the conscience is split and wrackt.

Eighthly, when he sees men stand upon their strength, 8. Offering parley.
he seeks to overreach them by conference. Like the great thieves of the
world, who labor to get by treaties what they cannot seize upon by main force.
Take heed of him when he falls to parley, and count the truth half lost, if
thou yield to have it disputed; our mother Eve could never make her party good,
when once she had yielded to put it to the question, Has God said indeed, etc?
Parley cherishes traitors, and be sure the devil intends thereby to sift thee,
and either (as Rabshakeh) to dismay the well affected, or rather (as Jud. 9.1,
etc.
Abimelech) to find or raise up a treacheous party within thee; it is no
wisdom nor safety to capitulate with an irreconcilable enemy.

Lastly, even in seeming to go out, he enters the farther in, 9. Feigning
flight.
hypocrical profession is like Popish exorcisme, or holy water, at which the
devil laughs when he seems to fly: He retires himself (it is true) and gives
thee leave to shut the door after him; but he leaves an unsanctified heart to
keep possession for him, and to make clean the house against his return; so
going out, not by compulsion, but composition; not by fine force, but by
compact, he returns as into his own, with seven spirits worse then the
former, which Saint Augustine Aug. Quaest super Evangae. 9
calls Septinariam simulationem, sevenfold hypocrisy. Thus diverse turning
Protestants for preferment, become seven times more the children of hell then
they were before: It is a notable deceit to make men in love with bondage under
the name of 2 Pet. 2.19
liberty. Satan plays fast and loose with loose hearts, and in seeming to
loose, binds them the faster; as the Jesuit, (and their spawne the Quakers)
draw all to their Covents that they can lay hands on, under pretense of
preaching and teaching gratis; but know, the devil is never so dangerous, as
when he is most tame; he will give thee leave to defy and spit at him, to
insult and tread upon him, to bridle and saddle him, so he may carry thee to
hell: We may shut up this point of the stratagems of Satan with the words of
the holy Ghost touching the watchmen of Ephraim; Hos. 9 8.
He is a snare of a Fowler in all his ways and hatred against the house of God.

Notwithstanding we must not think that he has only stratagems and policies
to use: there are times also wherein he uses plain dealing, At times he uses
plain dealing.
and pulling off his visor professes himself to be the destroyer and devourer
of souls. Those times are, as I conceive, these four;

First, when he thinks his authority shall weaken the credit of the truth. 1.
When his testimony may discredit truth.
For then the more he shows himself in his colors, the less is that
believed which he seems to affirm. Thus raging in the man possessed, he
confessed Christ Mat. 8.29, 31
to be the Son of God, and after left the print of his malice in the drowned
swine, not to give credit to that Doctrine, but to make it be accounted a
doctrine of devils. In like manner by the mouth of the Pythonesse, Acts 16.17.
he acknowledged the truth of the Gospel, and the calling of the Apostles,
knowing that nothing could so much undermine the authority of that truth, as
his confession and approbation, who was the known enemy thereof. Nothing is
more pernicious then plain dealing policy.

Secondly, when he has wicked men at a vantage, 2. When he has men at a
vantage.
and now fears they may bethink themselves, for then he hurrieth them into
the snares of perdition, as Huntsmen with loud cries do force their prey into
their nets. Thus he dealt with Saul, Achitophel, Judas, not giving them time to
bethink themselves, but urging and precipitating them to a speedy resolution of
self murder, like the swine that were carried violently into the sea.

Thirdly, when he makes himself now sure of his prey, 3. When he is sure of
his prey.
then for their greater terror and his greater glory, he lets them see the
face, and feel the force of their tyrannous conqueror. As Hunters, when the
beasts are hampered in the toil, come with their darts and instruments of
death: For so Satan has not only his nets, but also his darts; fiery darts,
not only insinuating, but also commanding tentations; the former to win them
into his power; the latter to exercise his hellish power over them; the former
to disarme them of wholesome and timely fear; the latter to insult over them,
when they are now past hope.

Fourthly, when rage deprives him of reason, and fury drives him from his
fence. 4. When rage puts him out of his fence.
For as men in desperation forget their cunning, so does Satan; when he saw
that Christ began that judgment, whereby he was to be cast out: his malice
made him do that, which apparently tended to the prejudice of his kingdom in
hastening the death of him, who was by dying to destroy both death and him. And
in like manner in these last days seeing his Rev. 12.12, etc
time to be but short, he waxes wrath and woad, and in great rage persecuteth
the woman and her seed which keep the Commandments of God, and have the faith
of Jesus Christ.

Secondly, Satan the father.
Thus we have seen how Satan is the arch-hypocrite, and now it remains to show
how he is the Father of all hypocrites.

That all wicked men are in the power of Satan, 1. O all wicked men who are his
subjects.
it needs no proof seeing the Apostle says, 1 John 5.19.
the whole world lies in evil, or in that evil one. He Ephesians. 2.2.
works in them, and leads them 2 Timothy 2.26
according to his will. He 2 Cor. 4.4
blinds them as horses, that they may turn the better in his mill; they are
his slaves body and soul, John 8.44
because his lusts they not only do, but will do. They are his tenants, and
hold of him both their present portion in this world, and their place assigned
in the world to come. Living, they pay him the rent of a guilty conscience, and
dying the heriot of a damned soul.

But there is yet a nearer relation betwixt him and them. For they are not only
his Subjects, but his John 8.44
children and Genesis 3.15
seed: His seed.
not only of his party, but of his nature. Therefore the first division of
mankind is into the seed of the woman, and the seed of the Serpent. Saint
Augustine fetches the foundation of his two adverse Cities farther off, to
wit, from the division of good and evil Angels. But there is some difference;
good Angels differ from good men, because those were never pilgrims; and evil
Angels from evil men, because those are all gone forth, never to return. Again,
good Angels unto good men are only companions, and guards in the way of
well-doing: But evil Angels unto wicked men, are among the causes and
counselors of evil; wherefore wicked men are said to 1 John 3.8
be of the devil; but good men, not of good Angels, but of God, and of Christ:
And how wicked men are of the devil, our Savior shows when he tells the
malicious Jews what was their proper pedigree; Ye are of your Father the devil;
and the blessed Apostle, John 8.44
when he blasoneth the arms of Acts 13 10
Elymas, O full of all subtilty and mischief, thou son of the devil; wicked men
therefore are of the devil, not as made by him, but as marred and made wicked by
him; not as naturally begotten, but as spiritually corrupted by him; for sin
is the devils seed, as grace is called 1 John 3.9
the seed of God. Of that seed are wicked men begotten, not as men, but as
wicked; and from that seed we all by nature bear the image and superscription
of Satan; and in whomsoever that seed is not mortified, they show themselves
children of that Father by imitation; ye do that, says our Savior, Non
nascendo; sed imitando, Aug.
which ye have seen with your Father; Fathers affect to bring up their children
in their own trade, and children are apt to do what their fathers do before
them, imitation is enough to denominate even strange children; for which cause
all heardsemen are said to be the sons of Jabal, and all Musicians the sons
of Jubal, which phrase is interpreted when Tubal-Cain is said to be the Genesis
4.20, 21 22
instructor of all artificers; How much more may Satan be called the father of
wicked men, who first were corrupted in Adam by his poisonous tentation;
Secondly, begotten in his likeness; Thirdly, brought up in his School;
Fourthly, remain still practitioners in his hellish Mystery, who see him, and
love to see and follow him, appearing familiarly to them in unghostly
counselors, in sensual objects, in diabolical suggestions? And so great is the
communion between him and them, that the Holy Ghost forbeareth not to give unto
the devil the name of man Mat. 13.28
; and unto a man the name of Devil John 6.70
; to show, that men ruled by the devil, are devils incarnate.

But of all wicked men hypocrites may best claim this kindred, or rather wicked
men, as in regard of all sins, so especially of their hypocrisy. 2. More
specially of hypocrites.
Other sins transform men into beasts, as drunkenness into swine, cruelty
into lions, craft into foxes lust into horses, etc. but hypocrisy into devils,
therefore Judas is called a devil; and false teachers compared to Satan 2 Cor
11 3
the subtle Serpent, transforming himself into an Angel of light: Mischief is
not all, there must be subtilty Act 13.10
quartered with mischief to blason a son of the Devil; a lie is not enough, it
must be 1 Timothy 4 1, 2.
a lie through hypocrisy, to note a doctrine of devils; this makes men a
Deuteronomy. 32.5.
perverse and crooked generation, resembling the crooked Serpent of whom they
are descended; by this, Satan fills their hearts to lie unto God, as is said
of Ananias; Satan so taught Adam Job 31.33
, and Adam mankind, though some exceed others in the practice of that common
lesson: for Satan has not only his vulgar professors, but his Prophets, his
Apostles and Martyrs too. He would seem an Angel of light, whose office is to
have the Testimony of Jesus, no marvel then if his champions have assumed the
titles of Angelical and Seraphical Doctors: By these he 2 Cor. 11.3
corrupts the minds of men from the simplicity that is in Christ; or this
double Serpent cannot abide simplicity, either in doctrine, worship, or
conversation. Of him men learn to be one to another, as Dan. Genesis 49 17
a Serpent by the way, an Adder in the path to bite the horse heels, that the
Rider may fall backwards. Of him they learn to hate the image of God in Gal.
4.29
such as are born after the Spirit, and yet to Prove. 26.26
cover their hatred by deceit. Of him they learn to 2 Timothy 3.3
accuse and calumniate, whence we read of men-devils, and women-devils. Of him
they learn to be tempters and 1 Timothy 3.11
seducers one to another. The Serpent was a devil to the woman, and the woman a
Serpent unto the man, and since that time every man is by nature a tempter, a
Serpent, a devil both to himself and others; To himself; for, James 1.14
whosoever is tempted, is drawn away by his own concupiscence and entised; To
others; for company, counsel, example in sinning are forcible persuasions, Homo
homini aut Deus est, aut Demon. He that is not Gods instrument for the good of
his brother, is the Devils agent for his destruction, as Ahabs Prophets helped
their Master to hell, and Rev. 2.14.
Balaam that taught Balack to lay a stumbling block before the children of
Israel. Satan has so strong a party in mankind, that he need not now to tempt
any more by the Serpent. The hypocrite will serve that turn, who associateth,
and as it were incorporateth into himself the unclean spirits, and (as Saint
Bernard speaks) una cum eis efficitur Demon; He is both the devils child,
and his harlot (as Lucretia to Pope Alexander) to make him a fruitful father of
lies.

But in enlarging these things, I find my self in danger to touch upon diverse
particulars which will more fitly and fruitfully offer themselves in their
proper places; Wherefore it shall suffice that hypocrisy is the devils craft,
in which wicked men are free by their fathers copy, and that he sends up out
of hell these false Samuels, as walking Ghosts and phantasmes to delude the
credulous world. Application.
Whence it follows that we have need in the through-fare of this world (which
is the devils dominion) of a threefold Caution.

The first, in regard of Satan himself, The great Imposter of the world, least
he circumvent us with his methods and wiles. 1. Beware of his wiles.
We had need go study this black art, not to practice, but to avoid it; The
knowledge of his art of offense is unto us the art of defense; O what wisdom
is required in a Christian that must take heed of an Angel of darkness, under
the show of 2 Cor. 11.14
an Angel of light: O what watchfulness, that must not take an Angel of light
Gal. 1.8
upon his own report; the wound of the Scorpion is cured by his own blood; So
the wisdom of the Serpent is needful against this Serpent, and spiritual
prudence to discern and withstand these spiritual wickednesses; No trust in
revelations either against or besides the word. We must question such
apparitions, as Joshuah did the Angel Josh. 5.13.
Art thou for us or for our adversaries? so is this the persuasion of him that
has called us? He that speaks not according to that rule, Hic niger est, Esaias
8.20
there is no morning light in him. Say not as the seduced charmer, I am in
league with him, he will do me no harm; it is not safe Esaias 28.15
covenanting with hell, nor taking Physic of an enemy. He has nothing to give
thee but death. Can any good come out of Heb. 2.14
deaths dominion? say not, I hate and defy him with all my heart, yet living
in a course of sin He is a base tyrant that seeks not thy love, but thy
service, and that unto thine own destruction. He is content thou should spit
at his name, so thou cherish his nature, and wrong the Lord to do him a
pleasure: Say not, he is an enemy indeed, but far off. Alas his home, his hold
(till Christ cast him out) is within thee, thine heart is his forge, thy
corruptions his instruments, thy lewd companions his very black Angels and
sub-devils. Fear him not so much for his horns and claws, as for his
tentations. Many make God the author of their sin, and Satan of their
punishment; but it is Satan that craftily seduceth thee, and God that justly
punishes thee, and that by delivering thee into his hands to torment thee. If
thou willingly admit him as a tempter, thou shall surely fall into his hands as
thy tormentor; say unto the Lord, the adversary and enemy is this wicked Satan;
but dwell thou Psalm. 91.1, 3. Aug. in Ps. 130
in the secret of the most high, and he will deliver thee from the snare of
this Hunter. A Christian (as the woman in the Revelation) has wings given him
to fly above the reach of this dragon, and may say (with Doedatus) non possidet
aethera Satan; yea, the Lord will turn his malice into good unto thee. Little
knows Satan (says Saint Augustine) what good comes of him, even when he
rages most like himself. The Lord though he suffer him to sift, yea and buffet
his dear children, yet will not give the soul of his turtle into the power of
the dog.

Our second caution must be to take heed of petty hypocrites, vice-devils. 2.
Take heed of sub-devils.
Evil men are the suburbs of hell, but hypocrites are his exchange. Every
wicked man is the devils customer, but hypocrites are his brokers, his chapmen,
his retailers they buy of him to sell unto others: Every sinner is deceived by
him, but the hypocrite is his apprentise in the art of deceit; 2 Timothy 3 13
deceiving and being deceived, no marvel they make so good a show, and pass so
current in the world, seeing Satan joyneth with them, to advance his party and
kingdom; but he crosses and disgraceth all that ever he can the sincere
Christian. Hence we see that Papists (with all the mischief they do) can hardly
get enemies, nor true hearted professors, friends. Men are ready to plead for
them. Mal. 2.10
Have we not all one Father? and it is true enough in the sense before
delivered; but according to their understanding of a Father; Mat. 3.9
God is able of stones, of infidels to raise better children unto Abraham; we
should therefore learn rather of the Prophet, to handle roughly the Ministers
of 2 King. 6.32
this murderer, and give them their answer without the door, for certainly the
sound of their Masters feet is behind them: Let not shows and titles deceive
us. Satan smiles to see Gods image derided under his name; and his embraced
under the name of Christ. Reject not truth because he alleges it (for that he
aims at;) but reject his authority and communion, as having Acts 8.
neither part nor lot in that business. See God in every truth, though uttered
by 2 Chr. 35.21
Pharaoh; and Satan in every falsehood, though fathered upon Peter. Mat. 16.23


Our third and most important Caution respects our selves, that we make our
selves free, not of, but from this trade of devils: 3. Be not of the devils
trade.
this sin of hypocrisy; I would not (says the 1 Cor. 10 20
Apostle) that ye should have fellowship with devils. Hypocrisy is not only a
communion, but a fornication with the unclean spirits. Will thou make thy soul
his harlot? thy wit his bawd? thy profession his midwife? thy practice his
bastard? Shall he make thy mind his tiring house? thy life his pageant? thy
heart his quiver? thy tongue his bow Jer. 9.3
? Will thou do as some foolishly proud, who spoil a good complexion by
painting? The King of heaven will never take pleasure in a borrowed beauty. He
had rather see in thee ingenuous defects, then counterfeit perfections.
Painting is not intended to please chaste eyes, Psalm 49.11
and therefore is but an harlotry varnish; no more is hypocrisy accommodated
unto the pure eyes of Christ, and therefore it is but a devilish dawbery;
though it make many a sinne-burnt soul seem fair to carnal beholders.

In fine, our sinful nature is a Pasiphae; the devil not only a Taurus to
adulterate her, but a Dae^alus to build for every Minotaure a labyrinth of
hypocrisy, but the knowledge of our selves and of God must be the clew of
Ariadne to bring us in; and the power of the Word and Spirit of God more then
the force of Theseus to subdue these monsters.

CHAP. IV. The natural hypocrite is he, in whom nature usurpeth the room of
grace.
THough every hypocrite (as an hypocrite) be an artificial piece, yet there is
a natural hypocrite among the rest; Definition.
so called, not because he is without art, but because his art is to give
nature the place and prize of religion. That there are certain eminencies and
advantages of natural parts in some men above others, cannot be denied.
Experience shows that men, as blades all made of the same metal, yet differ
much by means of temper: Some more soft smooth and ducible, others more stiff
and stubborn, that will break rather then bend. This difference Plutarch
observes in the natural disposition of Marcus Brutus, Plut. in Bruto.
compared with Junius his Ancestor, and with Cassius his fellow in conspiracy.
Reason confirms the same, because though the soul of Solomon (as it is
created and infused) differs nothing from the soul of Nabal; yet being to
work by bodily organs, even in the perfecting of her self, her actions resemble
her instruments; and as in generation the birth usually resembles the mother;
so in disposition, the soul takes her temper from the body. (...).
Hence we see some of condition ingenuous, shamefast, fit to be taken with the
love of virtue; others of a baser cast, fit to be ruled, not by shame, but by
fear; not by praise, but by punishment; not by reason, but by constraint.
Naturalists observe that phlegm predominating makes a man slow, stupid, and
servile: choler heady, various and violent; melancholy timorous, close, sour
and inexorable; blood voluptuous, riotous and retchlesse. Therefore the
sanguine with a moderate mixture of melancholy to qualify the motion of the
blood, is commended as the temper that gives best counterpoise, both to the
humors of the body, and passions of the mind. The Scripture notes a
difference of natures in Esau and Jacob; the one cunning, the other plain Genesis
25.27
; the one a ranger, a man of the field; the other loved home, and went not out
of the tent. If we compare the nature of Ishmael a Gen 16.12
wild ass man, his hand against every man, etc. and every man's hand against
him: with Jonathan so amiable, 2 Samuel 1 26.
passing the love of women; how great will the distance appear? Now they that
have these seeds of nature, as they are generally gracious in the eyes of
others, so are they apt to think highly of themselves, and many times they
enter into comparison with the children of God, and bear away the prize from
some of them: For good nature without grace makes a fairer show to the world
then grace with an ill nature, as a cur outrunneth a grayhound with a clog: But
when all is done nature is but nature, and gives one man no more advantage of
another, then tame beasts have of wild, which are beasts also no less then
the wild, or then the flower has of the herb, which is grass no less then
the herb. To this 1 Pet. 1.24
flower of the grass the Apostle Peter compares all natural excellency, which
he calls a mortal seed; and (to our purpose) avoucheth that ver. 22.
love without hypocrisy, cannot spring from that root. Without regenerating
grace there is no sincerity in men's affections, therefore neither in their
actions: He therefore that is in his pure naturals, is in the list and roll of
hypocrisy; he that bears himself on them, marches under her banner; he that
opposes them to grace, fights in her quarrel.

Difference.
But the child of God is he in whom the best nature is renewed and refined by
grace. He is a new creature 2 Pet. 1 4
partaker of the divine nature, and therefore abstaineth from the corruption
that is in the world through lust. Among worldly corruptions hypocrisy is not
the least; and it is grace, only grace that freeth from hypocrisy. The Apostle
commands, Rom 12.9.
that love be without hypocrisy: But whence may that be had? Saint Peter
shows, that 1 Pet. 1 22
love unfeigned supposes regeneration through the Spirit by the incorruptible
seed of the Word. In like manner Saint James James 3.17
commending Christian wisdom, among other epithites says, it is without
hypocrisy; but withal he tells us, this wisdom is not from beneath, but
James 1.17
from above, even from the Father of lights. Natural parts and perfections may
be either found or wanting in a child of God; but if they be found, they are
made servants and instruments unto grace; if wanting, grace has the more
trouble, and must do her work her self: yet better is grace without these good
helps, then natural parts without grace; as Prove. 12.9
the poor man that has a servant is better then he that boasts himself and
lacks bread. Grace has the poor man's blessing, not to be without a servant,
for her children serve her, yea she can be her own servant.

In the one therefore generation stands instead of regeneration, in the other
regeneration makes use of the good, and supplieth the defects of generation.

The natural hypocrite deriveth his honors from his birth.

The great men among the Heathens had some reason to solemnize their birth
days, because the advantages they had of others that came from that mould not
only in regard of honors and titles, but even of virtues also. Wherefore moral
Philosophers required in their Disciples a predisposition of nature, as without
which they perceived they should do little good upon them. They must be nati or
else they could not be facti; tempered before they could be framed, composed
that they might be disposed. This hypocrite therefore has his virtue, as many
have their nobility without their own labor or merit, and therefore without
true honor. Vix ea nostra voco, such accessions are scarcely to be called our
own.

Contrariwise, Difference
the new creature deriveth his honor from his new birth as a Son of God.

That which is born of the flesh (says our Savior John 3.6
) is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit: Behold in a
regenerate man two births, two originals; The former he remembers with honor
to God (who has made him Psalm. 139.14.
fearfully and wonderfully;) but with shame to himself, saying, Psalm 51.5
Behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me. The work
of procreation is it, wherein the old Adam, even to this day, Gen 5.3.
begets a Son in his own likeness. If any have been good Jerem. 1.5
from the womb, it was not of the womb. The womb might be the term from whence
goodness (by the extraordinary work of the Spirit) began; but not the cause or
fountain of goodness. Grace comes never the sooner for good nature; For, 1
Cor. 1.26
not many wise, not many noble after the flesh are called; but it is the gift
and calling of God. A man must be born again (though Nicodemus cannot relish
it) that shall be good in the sight of God A Christians birthday, is that
wherein Gal. 4.19
Christ is formed in him, and the travel of nature is blessed with Luke 19.9
the issue of grace.

Thus the one receives his honors his arms from his Ancestors; the other
wins them in the field. The one has eldership as Esau; but the other, as
Jacob, goes away with the blessing.

The natural hypocrite has his perfections from his body.

A base perfection that has its original from the basest part, like the motion
of the Serpent, when the tail would lead the way to the head. We count those
creatures base, whose form arises out of the potentiality of the matter so
those men must needs be of mean worth, whose perfection comes from their
complexion; and in whom the body gives laws to the soul. Popular States may
decree honest things; but Eccles. 10.17
blessed art thou O land, when thy King is the son of Nobles: Bodily temper may
incline men to some things that are good; but virtue loses her dignity, yea
and her name, when she comes not armed with the command of reason. What
commendation or thank is it for a man to do that whereto his nature enclineth
him? we may praise a man for being tall, fair, welfavoured, as we may praise
the snow for being white, yet no external feature of the body Ps. 147.10, 11
how comely so ever), but only the endowment of grace commends a man unto
God. The gifts of the body are no more ours, then those of fortune (as they are
called;) nay less, for many times unto these our industry concurreth; unto
those never, for who Mat. 6.27
by taking care can add unto his stature? or alter the color of his hair?
Many things are beautiful, proceeding from reason and grace, which if they come
of nature alone, are rather defects. An Eunuch, so born, is a Esaias 56.3.
dry tree; but he that by grace Mat. 19.12
makes himself such for the Kingdom of heaven, has a Esaias 56.5.
name better then of sons and daughters. The gift of continency 1 Cor. 7.7.
it self is a bodily privilege, (and therefore makes Verse 28
marriage as not necessary, so neither unlawful;) but it is temperance of mind
that deserves the name of virtue, not temper (much less distemper) of body.
That is not virtue that is born with a man from the womb of his mother, nor a
temperature not easily liable to temptation; but grace subduing temptation.
Plutar. in Solon.
And what virtues are they which may be lost by age or sickness? yea, that may
be gotten by disease or decay of nature? It is noted of Charles the fifth, that
by age he grew more phlegmatic, and thereby more moderate; a good turn for his
Subjects, and for neighboring Princes; but no commendation to himself.

Differ.
But the new creature is perfected from his better part.

The better part of a man is his soul, and the better part of a Christian is
this Spirit or new man. As it is meet therefore that Art (the rule of reason)
should perfect nature; so is it also meet that grace should perfect both nature
and reason. A man of a cheerful spirit, though somewhat corpulent, moves
nimbly, because he has animam pro vehiculo, an active soul for his chariot; so
a Christians motion being from the soul of new life, is more then according to
the activity of nature. As in evil the titillation is from sense and appetite;
but the reasonable will consenting, makes it a vice: so unto good there may be
an inclination by nature; but the royal assent of the inner man makes it a
virtue. Natural inclinations bear great sway in humane actions; because few
men examine, fewer correct or cross them. Some naturalists have been very
partial in behalf of natural causes. What will not he ascribe to nature, who
can find in his heart to affirm, that a man unlettered by mere alteration of
the temper of his brain, may come to speak the Latin tongue? Atque idem jungat
vulpes, etc.
But in the child of God, with a new Lord, there are new laws: the Law of
grace improveth natural inclinations, if they be good, keeping the same course
upon better grounds; reproves them if they be evil; shaping her course, not
according to the wind, but according to the compass. And as Seamen have an
art to catch a cross wind, and make it serve their turn; so the child of God
makes happy use of bodily distempers; making choler serve unto zeal; phlegm
unto patience; melancholy unto contemplation; and lively blood unto spiritual
rejoicing.

Thus the hypocrite is as the Centaure, in whom the horse is the better half of
the man; and take away the horse, the man is spilt; but the Christian is good
on foot, as well as mounted. If his horse be gentle, he rides him; if jadish, he
breaks him; if weary he can lead or drive him; if stark tired, he can go
without him. He that has good legs finds less lack of an horse, and where
grace is in breath, natural parts are less missed.

The natural hypocrite is good, but not always.

As the cause is, such is the effect. The cause of any goodness of nature is
appetite; the cause of appetite, temperament; the cause of temperament, bodily
constitution. All these are mutable, and finally mortal; like Comets that
kindle without expectation, As Quakers, momento turbi nis.

Nova nunc religio in te istaec incessit. Terent.


and go out without warning. For that which begins without reason, will end
without occasion. Some men turn good so suddenly, that we may say, how came
this new Religion to seize upon them? But the good humor lasts not long,
there is a dump and a damp coming after. The very flood it self bodes an ebb.
Or if the beginning were more ancient even from the very conception; yet
nature, like the first matter, hates to be tied always unto one form. Her
pastime and recreation is in succession, and vicissitude, and that of
contraries. Summer and Winter are not more ordinary, then to see a man outlive
his good nature. For either it is soured by afflictions, or made brackish by
encounter with others ill conditions; or time it self turns it into vinegar.
Naturalists distinguish man's life into several ages, according to the
alteration of humors in the body, and mutation of temperature thereon
depending. Hence those years are called climaterical, wherein the soul changes
climate, as it were, in her passage through the little world of her body. From
the torrid zone of youth, to the temperate of middle age, and from thence by
the frozen zone of age, to the pole of death. In the mean time, Non eadem est
aetas, non men's. Hor.
age it self is a kind of death, as to youth, so to the inclinations arising
therefrom Thus we see youthful fervency end in coldness: liberality in
sparingness; modesty in unshamefastnesse, and the like. Time devoureth both
himself and his issue, and whatsoever is bred of nature has his worm in it
self. Nature is always in love with her present humor, as with her living
husband, and proves a stepmother to the children of her former disposition.

Contrariwise, the new creature is constantly good, Differ.
and unchangeably the same.

Grace being an immortal seed gives a perpetual and immortal temper. It is as
the Prove. 4.18
morning light that shines more and more unto the perfect day. A morning that
fears no evening, only it looks for an everlasting noontide in heaven,
where the Cant. 2.17
shadows shall fly away for ever. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, all the
Saints, whose histories are recorded, were no less amiable in age, then in the
flower of their years. David was no less affable and popular at the last act,
then in the beginning of his reign; witness that his last and most glorious
Parliament, unto which he prefaceth with this gracious compellation, 1 Chr.
28.2, etc.
Hear me my brethren and my people. Saint Paul aged, and a prisoner too (if
either years or troubles might have leavened his condition) yet retains his
accustomed spirit of love and tenderness, as appears in his most Fatherly
Epistle to Philemon. Age has much to answer for depopulating the beauties of
youth; but it has this to say for it self, that it takes no spoils, but of
nature; against whom it has letters of mart, under the seal of the God of
nature. He has pronounced Eccl. 11.10
childhood and youth to be vanity; upon that vanity age feeds. But it shall
never come in question for decay of grace. For the regenerate Ps. 92.14.
bring forth more fruit in their age, fat and flourishing. Here the proverb
has place, Prove. 31.21
Of fair things even the Autumn is beautiful. Grace, (...).
as the good houswife, looks for Winter, but fears it not; and therefore
fears it not, because she looks and prepares for it; getting change of
raiment, double raiment, to encounter with all changes of weather and seasons.
Yea, she makes a Summer in the midst of Winter, and renueth that youth in the
2 Cor. 4.16
inner man, which decays in the outward.

Thus the ones goodness is a Hosea 6.4
morning cloud, or dew. the others is the early and Verse 3.
latter rain. The ones good parts are his movables; the others lands, which
some call Hispan. roots, rayzes; the one holds by lease, the other by
inheritance; the one is good at random, the other by rule; the one at pleasure,
the other at command.

The natural hypocrite is good without election.

Nature knows no choice of things, no difference of persons, no distinction
of times or occasions, no bounds between measure and extremities. When Brutus
pleaded before Caesar, he said of him, I know not what this young man would
have, but quicquid vult, valde vult; whatsoever he would have, he would feign
have it. Nature is a blind guide, and impetuous; and he that is led thereby,
is affected vehemently, but uncertainly; like 2 Samuel 18.22, 23
Ahimaaz, that had rather a mind to run and show his footmanship, then
discretion to consider of the errand. Nature and counsel are contrary agents;
the one rules the actions of beasts, the other of men: And men that are led by
nature differ little from beasts; nay the beast has the advantage; nature
preferring her own issue before her noursling. If forwardness and
fearlesseness be taken for valor, a mad, or a drunken man shall be more
valourous then a wise man; yea, a horse then a man: for Job 39.25
he mocketh at fear, and turns not back from the sword. If willingness to
part with that a man has, be liberality, the fool is the most liberal person,
for he gives as well to them that deserve not, as to them that deserve, a fool
and his money is soon parted.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the new creature is good with discretion.

A wise Christian is not only forward and fervent, but with choice and
consideration. And when there is just cause to alter his outward course, he is
not afraid to be accounted light. Nature is as an horse, whose pace is
affection; if the Rider be sanctified reason, sometime there is use of the
bridle to hold it in; for nature is apt to exceed, even in the pursuit of good,
as well as in the hatred of evil; sometime there is need of the spur to put on,
for the forwardest natures are apt to wax dull in the rough ways of some
duties. But above all, the eye and hand of grace is necessary to keep nature in
the right way, which if it have a disposition to go, yet is ignorant of the end
of the journey. There is no proof of grace more certain, or more beautiful then
this, that it moderateth and regulateth natural inclinations; taking
bitterness from zeal, adding wisdom unto meekness. It makes all that are
truly godly, of one heart, and of one temper, notwithstanding differences of
climates and complexions.

The Esaias 11.6.
lion becomes a companion for the lamb; and the bear for the calfe, and the
communion of Saints reconcileth natural antipathie; so that whereas by nature,
you shall hardly see two men of a condition; by grace they agree, and seem all
(according to the proverb) one man's children. Blessed Saint Paul, before his
conversion was a wild boar, wasting the Church; but being converted, he put
on the 1 Cor. 4.15.
bowels of a Father, the Gal. 4.19.
travels of a mother, the 1 These. 2.7, 11
tenderness of a nurse. Saint John Luke 9.54.
one of the sons of Zebede, fiery by nature, no marvel if he proved a Mar.
3.17.
son of thunder; but he was also so qualified by grace, that in his writings he
breaths nothing but love.

The one of these therefore is good by disposition; the other by election; the
one by humor, the other by counsel.

The natural hypocrite works at ease and with facility.

Works agreeable to nature, are not only easy and familiar, but pleasant. All
this hypocrites ways are down-hill, so that he rather rolls, then walks. He
goes down the stream, and so has no need of arms, or oars. But he is not
soundly good that is good without pains and strife. (...).
Therefore the virtuous man in Greek is named by a word, which signifies
industrious. You shall see some courteous, liberal, patient, because they can
be no other; but set them to work out a new nature by prayer, and practice of
mortification to reform what is evil, to confirm what is good, to conform
themselves to Christ in the mind, as well as in the work; here they give off;
nature accompanies them not beyond the sphere of her own activity. But God is
not served with that which cost us nothing; neither is such goodness a lasting
fruit. For as many an one left rich by his friends, has a ready way to thrift,
yet seldom thriveth; so this hypocrite, finding a stock of good nature to his
hand, has a fair occasion of virtue, yet seldom makes use of it. Ease in the
entrance takes away the edge of industry, the only mother both of thrift and of
virtue.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the new creature works with study, strife, and industry.

The Christian not only works, but wrestleth; being like those that repaired
the walls of Nehem. 4.17
Jerusalem, who with one hand did the work, and with the other held the sword.
Such a wrestler was Saint Paul, who cries out, Romans 7.24.
O wretched man that I am, who shall rescue me from the body of this death? who
also tells us, that while the flesh and the Spirit are together, they will be
Gal. 5.17.
contrary each to other, so that we cannot do the things that we would. Neither
is our strife with flesh, as it is sinful only, but also as it is natural.
Therefore the Apostle compares Christians to such as 1 Cor. 9.25
try masteries, and by his own example teaches us to Verse 27.
beat down this our body as with a cudgel, importing a necessity to displease
our selves in our appetites and inclinations. And if any of Gods children shall
seem to perform with ease some spiritual duties, as agreeable to their nature,
we are to consider,

First, that all men's strife is not alike, nor any one Christians alike in all
duties. Some, as smooth trees, are sooner squared, yet the ax must pass upon
them. Into a soft nature, grace slideth, sinketh, soaketh; and is hardly
perceived. And as fire in warm weather; so grace in such is not so fervent, by
reason of weaker opposition. But that which gives facility for the most part,
denies perfection, for that is reserved as a garland for industry. As in arts,
they have most excellent, who have striven with some natural defects (as
Demosthenes with an ill utterance) so in the profession of godlinsse, they have
been most eminent, and have proved the greatest Worthies, who have had the
strongest corruptions to tug withal, as we ^ee in holy David, and blessed Saint
Paul.

Secondly, though natural disposition may remove some rubs, and prepare a fair
way for grace; though it may give some encouragement and acceptance unto
goodness, though it may be both an ornament and an instrument thereto, yet
there is always work enough left for grace: For no temperature of nature will
free a man from self-love, profaneness, and such like spiritual distempers.

Thirdly, even in that which a Christian does by help of nature, there wants
not strife. The motion and action is apparent, but lookers on see not the
inward contention. As when a nimble man runs, we see his speed, but discern not
his travel; so in a Christians race, we see how he gets ground, but perceive
not with what sighs and earnings he fetches daily supplies of grace from
above; we see not how much ado he has to shake off (whatever it be) Heb. 12.1
the sin that cleaves most close and fast unto him.

Thus the one is a piece of cast metal, soon made, but hardly mended: the
other as in the bar or wedge, needs much of the hammer to bring him to his
due shape.

The natural hypocrite is disposed to some virtues, but not to all.

Nature affects some virtue, not because it is virtue, but because it is
agreeable;

Contrariwise, the new creature is framed and apt to every good work.

As of Arts, so of graces, there is an (...), a ring, a chain, out of which,
Differ.
if one link be wanting, all the rest are dissevered. For he is no true
Christian, in whom is not found, even in this life the perfection of parts.
Therefore the Apostle, not only professes of himself, I Phil. 4.12.13
can abound, I can want, I can do all things; but also encourages his
Scholars, undertaking (as it were) for them. 2 Cor. 9.8.
God is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that ye always, having
all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work. To the same
purpose he prays for the Ephesians, that they might be Ephesians. 3.19
filled with all the fullness of God. It is true, that nature makes some
duties more familiar then other, and goes more willingly about them (as an
horse travelleth more freely to his known baits;) but the wise Christian makes
choice of his way himself, and makes nature carry him, even against her mind,
whithersoever duty and conscience call him.

Thus in the field of graces, the one as a passenger picketh a sallat, or
culleth out a garland; but the other comes, as the owner to mow down, and
carry away the whole crop.

The natural hypocrite abhors from some vice, but not from all.

Nature has two tasters, sympathy, and antipathy; which discern not things
good symptoms then virtues; effects of humor, then acts of reason. She hates
evil, not as the enemy of virtue, but as her own enemy. And seeing there is no
temper of nature, to which all vices are displeasing; therefore no nature
abhors all vices: but some nature, one vice, and some another. None, because
it is sin; but each one, because it is not his sin. Thus we see some abhor
from wantonness, who embrace drunkenness; as Alexander of Macedon: others
hate drunkenness, and yet exceed in uncleanness; as Julius Caesar. Sueton in
Julio cap. 53.
These men abhor from sin no otherwise then the Elephant from a mouse; save
that sometime their nature ranging them in one extreme, bandieth them against
the other; as the coward hates fighting, and the old churl cannot see with
patience the lavishnesse of young folk: and so much are these deceived, that
they wonder all are not of their mind; and none so sharp censurers, as they of
those vices from which nature has exempted them. Chaste by nature do wonder
that any should fall by incontinency; as well may a left handed man wonder that
any should have the use of the right.

Differ.
Contrarily, the new creature abhors from every way of evil.

It is the intent of the godly nature 2 Pet. 1.4.
to abstain from the corruptions that are in the world through lust. The whole
world of lust is his enemy; and not the least part thereof, the little world of
lust, that is within himself; against this he principally wardeth and fights.
Psalm 18.23
I have been upright in his sight (says David) and have kept me from my
wickedness; what that special wickedness was, not only the story manifests,
but himself elsewhere points at it, Ps. 119.36, 37
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness: Turn away
mine eyes from regarding vanity, and quicken me in thy way. He that is truly
good, pitieth others, who fall through natural impulsion; but himself fights
against this Goliath, as against the Devils Champion, in whom he hops to
discomfit the whole Army of Philistines.

This hypocrite is so eager to shut one gate, that he gives the enemy leave to
enter at another; but the regenerate maintains every gate, every quarter, every
posterne against the siege of sin.

The natural hypocrite overweeneth the advantages of nature to the prejudice of
grace.

It were not difficult to demonstrate this in many instances of dispositions,
arising from differences of complexion. For, how easily may a man mistake
(especially in the judgment of himself) a still nat^re, for meekness,
fervency for zeal, want of affections for discretion, stupidity for patience,
lenity for easiness to be entreated, obstinacy for constancy, and the like.
And so far does this prejudice prevail with such men, that when they see
Gods children break out by violence of pungent humors, stirring passions,
keen affections; they bless themselves and say, how long shall it be ere you
see me in such a mood? with like error (or rather more dangerous) the
abilities of the soul are overweened. It is well known that the pride of reason
has been the fountain of all heresies, and the magnifying of free will has
brought forth, in Philosophers, the ignorance; in Pelagians, the denial; and in
Papists, the extenuation of original sin. But I have confined my self in this
particular kind of hypocrite, to such perfections of nature as arise from
bodily temperature; and even to those, so far forth only, as may be without
prae-occupating the subject of the Treatises ensuing. Here therefore I will
content my self to insist in the overweening of natural wit and capacity.
Which as it arises from a good temperament of the brain, with plenty of animal
spirits; so it is a servant of special use unto understanding and discourse. A
gift not bestowed on all alike; and many times they have a double share herein,
who have no part in God. But without sanctification, the more wit, the more
enmity against God. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge they have caused thee to

the counsel of Ged against themselves. It is the Lords candle, but it oftener
gives light unto his enemy. It is like the body of the Moon, not light of it
self; but apt to be made light, if Christ the Sun of righteousness vouchsafe
to shine upon it. Without this it has no morning light, and is but as a dark
lantern in the hand of a night-walker, to abuse others, but most of all
himself.

Contrarily, Differ.
the new creature prizeth not himself according to his natural endowments.

He is afraid to be mistaken in those dispositions that have a semblance of
virtue. Some he ascribes to defect, or redundancy, and hides them as his
shame, putting the comeliness of grace upon them. Others he cherishes as
instruments of virtue, yet considers that tools make not an Artificer, with
skill and industry. He walks understandingly in the way of virtue. True
virtue is the object of spiritual sense. This sense therefore is not deceived
in her proper object; especially because it is daily Heb. 5. fin.
exercised to discern good and evil. Grace afordeth, not only a foot to move,
but an eye to direct; so that here neither the lame need borrow of the blind,
nor the blind of the lame. He knows that though there be Job 32.8.
a spirit in man; yet it is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives
understanding. He acknowledges no true light in himself, which comes not from
the beams of the Sun of righteousness shining in the word. It is the Psalm
19.7.
Law that gives understanding to the simple, and to the child Prove. 1.4.
sharpness of wit; that translateth men from Acts 26.18.
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God.

Thus the one makes a good wit his Well; the other his waterpot or bucket to
draw so much the deeper out of the Well of Divine wisdom.

The natural Hypocrite is inclinable, as well to vice, as to virtue.

It is said of the French, that he as soon forgets a benefit as an injury;
because he forgets an injury, not out of judgment and consideration, but
out of a sudden and variable disposition; not out of a good mind, but because
he cannot be long of a mind: So soon pleased, are soon angry. In like manner
some are by nature constant or forward: but it is alike, either to good or
evil. If to good, it may be ascribed to occasion rather then to election; and
it may be said of them, it was happy they took a good way. Alexander the Great
was eminent, as in virtues, so in vices. Good natures once corrupted, prove
worst of all others, Augustus Sueton in Aug. c. 27.
at the first was loath to consent to the proscription; but once in, he was
more inexorable then his merciless companions. None have done more vile
things, then men (accounted) of good natures, when once the temptation has
prevailed upon them. Herod Agrippa slew James Acts 12.2, 3
, and would have slain Peter also; and all out of popularity. What could
Antipas, that fox; or his father, that lion have done more? Among wild men
(such as Ishmael) there is more apparent danger; as Psalm 57.4
among lions, then among oxen. Among tame ones, as there is no good to be
gotten (no more then wisdom Eccles. 38.25.
among oxen;) so oftentime more harm; as more men are hurt by horses and oxen,
then by lions and bears. These we fly from, or pen them up; those we trust
oftentimes too far. If it had been mine Psalm 55.12
enemy (says David) I could have hid me from him, but it was thou my
companion. Reason subdued under lust, is not only led by lust, but becomes a
leader unto lust. Hence man being reasonable, is (if not better) worse then the
beast, for the reasonable appetite perverted, brings unsatiablenesse to evil,
and cannot be Genesis 11.6.
stinted. It seeks after objects, not only absent, but impossible; and being
a spirit, becomes (like the devil) a spiritual wickedness A man is never the
more out of the devils way for natural parts, but rather more for his use. It
is hard for a man to have them, and not to be proud of them; to have them, and
not to be the idler for them; to have them, and not to abuse them. As beauty
and chastity, re seldom married together. Evil counsel has great advantage
upon those that are of a pliant and pleasing disposition And as it prevails
powerfully upon them; so it comes most perniciously, because most perswadingly
from them. Satan knows this, Naturali excellentia male usus est, Aug. de
Eccl. dogm. c. 60
and therefore as he himself became a Devil by the abuse of his natural
perfections; so he aims principally at such as these we now speak of, to make
them, first subjects themselves, and afterward instruments of his tentations
to others. Every man is not fit timber to make an heritick of (says Saint
Hierome Hieron in Hose, cap. 10.
) but he that is of a fiery wit, and pregnant parts of nature. If thou be such;
ornari abs te Diabolus quaerit, the devil seeks to credit himself by thee,
says Saint Augustine. Aug. Epist. 41


Differ.
Contrariwise, the new creature is disposed to virtue only, and not to vice.

Natural disposition, as the sea, would Psalm. 104.6
stand above the mountains: but grace sets it Ver. 9.
a bound which it shall not pass, nor return to cover the earth. It keeps
nature in her due channel, that she may serve to transport us to all the
regions of virtue, and not carry us away with a deluge of vice. If nature be
stormy, and tempestuous, grace calmeth and composeth it. The Jews were worst of
nature of all peoples, (as appears by their histories and offspring) yet by
grace how were they mollified and sweetened? what stories, what ages can
parallel the sweet dispositions of Moses, of David, of Jonathan, etc? If nature
be of her own accord tractable and gentle; grace humbles the Christian so
qualified, making him consider;

First, that it was the favor of the God of nature, to give him so good parts.

Secondly, that there is daily need of new favor from the God of grace, to
sanctify them, which else he is apt to abuse unto evil. There is no eminent
thing in him, which is not either the offspring, or the Scholar and servant of
the grace of Christ. Prou. 17.27
The man of understanding (says Solomon) is of an excellent spirit; for
excellent is that Spirit of God that lives and rules in him. In him those
things meet, which seem in nature to be incompatible; as to be Psalm 103.8
slow to anger, and ready to forgive; the godly nature 2 Cor. 3.18.
transforming him into the image of God.

Thus in the one, good parts are as weapons in a Cutlers shop; as ready for the
thief, as for the true man; in the other, they be as in the hands of Justice,
for the terror of evil works, and to give strength to well-doing.

CHAP. V. The moral hypocrite is he, in whom reason puts Religion out of
office.
WHere nature ends, reason and morality (the improvement of reason) begin;
Defin.
adding a new luster, and, as it were, temper unto nature. The reasonable soul
(says the wise King Prove. 20.27
) is the Lords candle, searching all the bowels of the belly. It may be called
the light, John 1.9.
that enlightneth every man that comes into the world. It is 1 Cor. 2.11
the spirit of man, which (in man) knows the things of man. In this spirit
there are two faculties; the one discovering and discerning between good and
evil; the other choosing and refusing; the one being the mind, the other the
will. The Latins seem to have joined both under one appellation of Liberum
arbitrium; which is commonly, but not conveniently Englished, free will; for it
imports free choice upon deliberation; wherein the deliberation is of the
mind, the free election is of the will. These two are the great idols of
Moralists.

First, light of reason which out-faceth illumination, counting 1 Cor. 2.14
the things of God foolishness, because reason cannot comprehend them; for it
scorneth to be beholding to faith, the only perfecter of understanding. It has
indeed some relics of the knowledge of God imprinted in creation, and
preserved in the fall, to leave men without excuse; some common notions of good
and evil (especially in duties of the second table) reserved to maintain peace
and humane society. But as the light of the snow from the ground, so this James
3.15.
wisdom from beneath does rather dazzle, then direct men in the way to life.
For 1 Cor. 2.14 (...)
the natural man (that has no more then a reasonable soul to enlighten him)
perceives not the things of the Spirit of God; neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned. As for him his cogitations Ephesians 4.18.
are darkened, and so Jerem. 10.14.
every man is a beast by his own knowledge.

Secondly, freedom of will perketh up in the place of sanctification, and is
accounted of our moralists the fountain of virtues. Liberty it has by nature;
but goodness (that is application of that liberty to the choice of good
things) it has (say they) from it self. Si nobis libera voluntas ex Deo est,
quaea il^uc poten esse vel bona mala; bona vero voluntas ex nobis est: melius
est i^, quod a nobis, qua^ quod ab illo est. Aug. de Peccat meritis, etc. l. 2.
c. 18 Romans 2.14, 15. and 1.20.
But that one Argument of Saint Augustine is sufficient to possess us of the
absurdity of this opinion. If our will be free of Gods making, and good of our
own making; better is that which we have of our selves, then that which we have
of God. Many by free will have done some things of the Law, and have been a law
unto themselves. A Law sufficient not to perfect, but reprove; not to save, but
to condemn them; in some things excusing, but in many accusing the best that
ever have been out of Christ. A Law not conforming them to the Law of God, but
rather through pride of reason, maintaining them in rebellion against him. For
the Romans 8.7 Nouhabent illae paginae vultum pictatis hujus. Contes. l. 7. c. 21
wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the Law of
God, neither indeed can be. This hypocrite then is a Law to himself; what, tell
you him of another Law? Fancy in some beasts is the ape of reason, and reason
in the Moralist is the ape of Religion. But the imitation is ridiculous. Those
pages, those pageants have not the face of this piety, says Saint Augustine,
of Platoes writings, the mirror, the miracle of morality. Yea, as nothing
makes an ape so deformed, as that he is so like a man, yet without reason; so
nothing makes our moralist, so misshapen, as that he comes so near grace, and
yet is utterly destitute thereof.

Contrariwise, the Disciple of grace is he, Difference
in whom Religion brings Reason under command.

Religion, the anointed Sovereign of souls, is neither so young as to need a
Protector, or so remote, as to govern by a Viceroy; much less so weak, as to
endure an Usurper. She displaceth not the noble faculties of the reasonable
soul, but disposes them in subordination to her supremacy; Heb. 11.3.
understanding, to says in things to be known; free will to Phil. 2.13.
grace, in things to be done. It is not in this government, as in the
usurpation of reason. For there, the more reason, the less grace; because
reason will abide no Superior: but here, the more grace, the more true reason;
Rationem recta^ agnosco nullam nisi a Deo directam. Lips. de Constable.
because grace, though she can endure no equal, yet perfecteth whatsoever
comes under her command. Who can sufficiently conceive the glory of that
State, where Religion reigns as a rightful Prince, having Reason illuminated
for her counselor, and free will sanctified for her Minister?

The one of these therefore walks by torch-light, the other by daylight. In
the one, an aspiring servant abuses a weak Prince; in the other, a prudent
Prince governs by able instruments.

The moral hypocrite fetches his perfection out of himself.

He is both the patient, and the Physician; he is reformed from within himself,
and good of his own making: Yet he goes a step beyond the natural hypocrite.
For he uses only Kitchen Physic; nature is both his Cook and his Apothecary:
but the moral hypocrite uses exotical drugs, and compositions of famous
Physicians, that is, Philosophers; But as all drugs come from the earth; so
even the best of Philosophy is but humane; and as Physic is but a servant to
nature; so Philosophy does but teach a man to make use of that which is within
him. It is like exercise that stirs up the natural heat, or happily hectical,
such as it finds. Or like clothes that cherish and call forth the heat from
within, but cannot give heat. There is (as Philosophers suppose) some divine
thing in man, which to employ and improve, is the top of virtue. The Epicurean,
placing man's felicity in the body, and the Stoic, Aug. de Civ. Dei, l. 8. c.
8. Sive ergo a part qualibet, sive a toto homine, non nifi ab homine.
that placed it in the soul, differ in this, that one placed it in the worst,
the other in the better part of man. The Peripatetick placed it in both, so
differing from both the former, but all agreeing to put their confidence in
man, fall under the Prophets malediction Jer. 17.5. Aug. Ibid. c. 9
Cursed be the man that trusts in man. And though some Philosophers have gone
beyond their fellows (in so much that Plato said, to be a Philosopher was to
know God, to imitate God, to be in love with God;) yet because they sought not
(much less found) God, save in themselves, and in the model of their own
reasons; they Romans 1 21.
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were full of
darkness. For the spirit of man discerns only the things of man; 1 Cor. 2.11
but the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God. Neither were they
full of darkness only, but of pride also; as wanting that only curb of pride, 1
Cor. 4.7.
What have thou that thou have not received? They therefore that saw no virtue
in themselves, but as the issue of their own endeavor; no defect, but as
within the power of their own cure: what could hinder them from being proud?
Now whatsoever nourishes in man a proud conceit of his own goodness, is a
strong block-house against grace, which cannot enter til these 2 Cor. 10.5.
high things be cast down, these proud thoughts be brought into captivity.
Grace has no fiercer enemies then those that confine upon her. In this kind
therefore, the better men are, the worse they are; as Pharisees were worse then
the Publicans, because not so easily convinced, and made out of love with
themselves. And as a ship under sail, though in a contrary course, is sooner
brought about then she that lies a ground in the harbor can be lanched forth:
so he that is in motion, though in an evil way, will sooner be reduced then the
hypocrite that is mored in his morality. And as we may sooner overtake a swift
horse running from us, then our shadow that tarrieth fast by us: so it is more
possible to recover a gross offender, then this shadow of the moralist; who,
although he never run so far from grace as the other, yet will be sure to
keep his distance.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the Disciple of grace has his perfection from above himself.

The voice of grace is; Prove. 20.9.
Who can say I have made my heart clean? Job 9.30, 31.
If I wash my self with snow water, and make my hands never so clean, yet shall
thou plung me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall make me abominable; from
within is that which defiles a man; but from without comes that which cleanses
him. Morality as Physic, helps nature to do her own work; but grace, Ephesians.
2.1.
gives life, Psalm. 51.10.
creates a clean heart, translateth men Act 26.18
from darkness to light, transformeth them 2 Cor. 3.18.
into the image of God. Morality pruneth men, but grace graffeth upon them;
which cannot be done without cutting off the goodly top of nature by denial of
themselves. The Moralist drinks the water of his own cistern; but the true
Israelite 1 Cor. 10.4
drinks of the rock that followed the Elect people in the wilderness, that is,
of Christ. Morality is a pit within man, that will hold no water; but grace is
a draught given by Christ; which John 4.14
becomes a well of water, springing up to everlasting life. Look what
difference there was between Egypt, and Canaan; the same is between Morality
and Christianity. The one is Deuteronomy. 11.10
watered by the foot of man, deriving the exundation of other men's wits into our
private trenches; the other by the dew of heaven descending from the bottels of
God. The one is an effect of study and travel, the other a grace obtained by
prayer; and may therefore be called (like Sampsons well) (k) Euhakkore, Jud.
15.19.
the well of him that cried, or prayed. David cried for this well, when he
said, Psalm 51.10
Create in me a clean heart O God, renew a right Spirit within me.

This hypocrite therefore is like grounds that have springs rising in them;
which prove but a weeping sorry soil; but the Christian receives his moisture
from above, from those footsteps of God Psalm 65.11 Vestis accipitur, non cum
capillis nascitur: pecora de suo vestiuntur. Aug. de verb. Epist. Sermon. 15
that drop fatness. The one is as the beast, clad with his own skin; but the
other as the Priests of God, Psalm 132.9
clothed with righteousness.

The Moral hypocrite places perfection in conformity to his mere naturals.

so shall give no man cause to complain of him. Hominem naturae obedientem
homini nocere non posse. Cic. Aug. de vera Relig. cap. 3.
If any bold Philosopher adventured a little beyond the lists of nature, it
behoved him to sacrfice to nature for amends; as Saint Augustine notes of
Plato. As for any natural (that is native and original) pravity, our Moralist
is neither able to see it, nor willing to take notice of it. How should he see
it, being the very beam in his own eye? They that have laesum principium, a
cracked brain, cannot be brought to see their own defect; for what eyes have
they, save those that are preoccupate with conceit of perfection? Liberum
arbitrium in non renatis. amat languores suos; and pro sanitate habet, quod
aegrotare se nescit. Prosper Respon. ad capitula Gallorum. cap. 6.
Hence Prosper both truly and sweetly says, free will, in the unregenerate is
in love with her own disease, and instead of health has this unhappiness,
that she feels not her own sickness. Morality therefore can undertake none
but personal diseases, arising from passion; not natural, common, and
hereditary: as Physic may cure a man that has lost the use of his eyes, or
lamenesse by accidentary distemper; but not him that is born blind, or a
creeple from his mothers womb. Nay, as among Moors, blackness is counted a
beauty, because it is common, and they see no other: so with men unregenerate,
the vitiosity of nature passes for a seed of virtue; because it is universal,
and makes them like to all other men. He that is as all men are, does as all
men do, cannot err in the moralists opinion. But the Scripture says Hosea 6.7.
They have transgressed like men.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the Disciple of grace aspireth to what he was by creation.

As the young men that had seen no other, shouted for joy at the re-edifying of
the Ezra 3. fin.
Temple, under Zorobabel; but the ancient men who had seen that of Solomon,
wept to think of the former glory now greatly abated; so is it with the
moralist and the disciple of grace. Both behold nature, as now it is, but with
dfferent apprehensions. One magnifieth the remainders of natural light and
power; because he knows not that ever it was better. But the other acquainted
with our woeful downfall in Adam, and beholding darkness instead of light,
corruption instead of innocence; and for freedom unto good, captivity under
evil; cannot but with mourning acknowledge God has Eccles. 7. fin.
made man righteous, and he has sought many inventions: Romans 3.23.
All have sinned, and are deprived of the glory of God. Only our comfort is,
(as theirs also was) that the Lord Jesus will vouchsafe to Hag. 2.9. Mal. 3.1.
come into and dwell in this secondary and inferior Temple; whereby the glory
of man regenerate, far exceeds that of his first creation. The Moralist
looking neither back to Adam, nor forward to Christ, sees neither the evil of
the disease, nor the comfort of the remedy; and so knows neither himself, nor
God. But the Disciple of grace is acquainted with perfect innocence and
integrity, once had by creation, then lost by sin, unrecoverable by nature,
yet restored in part by grace, and to be accomplished in glory. He is neither
mistaken in the knowledge of God, nor of himself. He sees in the perfect
mirror of the Law of liberty, both his own deformities to bewail and correct
them; and the image of Christ (the absolute Idea of all virtue) and is 2 Cor.
3.18.
transformed into the same image from glory to glory:

Thus the one, not minding the tree, deceives himself in the fruit: but the
other warranteth the fruit, by making the tree good first. The one reduces man
to nature; but the other reformeth nature according to the image of God.

The moral hypocrite cures himself, by restoring to reason, the command of
appetite.

I speak here of the wiser sort of Moralists. Not of those who placed felicity
in sensual pleasure; whom Saint Hierome Hieron. in Eccl. cap. 9.
wittily called pecudes Philosophorum, the Beasts of Philosophers: Nor of those
who made it to consist of pleasure, and virtue; which Saint Augustine aptly
calls scillaeum bonum, Contra Jul. Pelag. l. 6. c. 5.
a monster compact of the natures of man, and beast: But of those who soared
highest above sense, and ascribed most to reason. Such could not but see
somewhat amiss, or apt to be amiss in the state of their souls: Some
obliquity of unruly affections, some usurpation of inordinate appetites,
rebelling against reason, and often captiving her so, as she became a drudge to
her own servants. Wherefore that they labored in, was to set up this Princess
in her Throne of Sovereignty; to range all affections and appetites under her
command; and to keep them ever after in due obedience thereto. In all this they
perceive not that the rule it self is crooked, which they apply; that the Col.
2.18.
mind it self is fleshly, and the Jam 3.15.
wisdom it self sensual which they measure by, no less then the affections
which they would measure. Such can never know how bad, and how base they are;
because they see not the blemish of their principal part. All is supposed there
to be safe and sound, fair and regular. An opinion bred of blind nature,
broached by Philosophy the School-Mistresse of nature; and from thence (in
despite of Scripture) inserted into the Romish natural, and Philosophical
faith.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the Disciple of grace subdueth all, that is man, to the rule of
grace.

In this family, Grace is the Sarah, and Reason her self is the Agar, apt to
rebel and run away from her Mistress, if God look not out after her, and
reclaim her. Reason indeed should be as pure water to wash us, but being mixed
with the earth of fleshly corruption, it becomes a very mire; and is so far
from cleansing appetite, that now the one is the fouler for the other: and we
may say as Diogenes of a foul bathe; Where must they wash, that have been
washed here? Original corruption, as the flood of Noah, has overflowed even
the highest mountains of nature. And now in the School of grace, reason is
taught, first to reform her self, and appetite after. First, to see her own
weakness, or rather crookedness (which none under heaven Eccl. 1.15.
can make straight) and how she is not only depressed by violence of appetite,
but also depraved in her self, and disabled for government; not only
hoodwinked, but blinded in the things of God; not only weakened but vitiated;
not only clogged, but corrupted, and become willing to live in fleshly
captivity. Among other lessons, she learneth this also, that reason is not
sufficient to reform appetite. Philosophers have taken great pains to keep in
this wild beast. But all comes to this, they have made a park to enclose
passions, but they are wild still, and many times break forth, and must be
hunted in. The Stoics therefore, as in despair knocked them all on the head.
Only Christianity tameth them, bringing them under the yoke of grace, and
sacrificing them alive in her Romans 12.1
reasonable service of God.

Thus the one talks of right reason; the other rectifieth it. The one keeps
affections as his game, or destroys them as noisome beasts: the other yoaketh
them in the plough of grace.

cannot be wrought upon, without the concurrence of natural inclination.

Si natura paululum obstiterit, etc. Lact. l. 3. cap. 25.
If nature be a little averse, the Philosopher is at a stand. He can neither
prevail with others, nor himself. The like may be said of condition of life,
of sex, of country, of age, and what not? Philosophy flees from the rude
multitude; yea, rather the Philosophers through envy and avarice made a
monopoly thereof. Three bolts they clapped on successively to keep off the
vulgar. Multitudinem consulto fugit Philosophia Cic.
First, they wrote in verse unto the days of Socrates. Plato (the Secretary of
Socrates) took off the bolt of verse, and put on a second of fables. That liked
not Aristotle; so he took away that of fables, and added another of his own
devise; which was made of word and of art, and Mathematical demonstrations.
Thus they debarred the far greatest part of mankind, and pronounced them
incapable of that which might make them happy. Neither women, nor servants, nor
husbandmen and artificers, nor of any condition, the young man, have been
accounted meet disciples for moral Philosophy. Lact. l. 3. c. 24
One only woman Themiste, one only servant Phaedo, one only Barbarian
Anacharsis, are said to have attained this laurel. And who can doubt,
considering the different and strange sects of Philosophers, but that nature
disposed them, some this way, and others that? who can doubt but that Diogenes
shaped his discipline according to his currish nature? Leo Hebr. Dial de Amore.
or that Cato, stern of disposition, even from a child was borne a Stoic?
Physic works not, save where nature leads the way. But the weakness of
this Physic is such, that it must not only crave aid of the patient, but also
beg leave of the disease. When youth is past, and the fervor of nature alayed,
then is the time to hear the precepts of morality. But what if will be wanting?
Philosophy can no more impose necessity; then it can create aptness and
sufficiency. Tam se hominem putat esse, qui audit, quam est ille, qui praecipit
Lact l. 3. c. 26 Arist. Eth. lib. 10. cap. 9
He is a man reasonable that must receive the rule, and he is no more that
gives it. May not I as well give my self a dispensation, as another man may
give me a Law? I mean for private regiment. Aristotle therefore does wisely
call in aid of civil law, and the power of Magistracy; because all men are not
fit to be made virtuous out of ingenuity, and love of commendation, which are
all the coards morality has to hold men by.

Contrariwise, the Disciple of grace is made fit, by grace, Differ.
to receive her impression.

If morality find some men averse, and untractable, grace finds all, not
only indisposed, but in terms of hostility. But this is the proper and most
glorious trophe of Christianity, that crossing nature, it does not only subdue,
Volentes per populos dat jura.
but also win and reconcile it. What it meets withal, directly opposite, it
destroys as sin; what it finds untoward, it corrects as nature; what it
finds not, it creates as spiritual habits. Grace does not only cure the
sick, but revive the dead; not only give knowledge to the capable, but also
sharpness of wit to the simple; not only deed to the will; but first will, and
then deed: By grace, not only pliable conditions are trained, but also the
wild are tamed, the sturdy mollified, the dull quickened; servants are made
ingenuous, plebeians generous, women clothed with Prove. 31.25.
strength, and Psalm 119.9
young men mortified. It comes armed, not with the authority of some wise man,
but with Romans 16.26.
the Commandment of the everlasting God; not with conditions of praise, or
dispraise; but upon peril of life and death. It summoneth not to the censure of
grave men, but to the day and Eccles. 11.9 Acts 17.31.
doom of Christ. It calls forth conscience as the Eunuchs of Jezabel, to
cast down the most potent corruptions, the best beloved sins to be trodden under
foot by Jehu, that is, by the Lord Jesus. Thus armed, give me (says
Lactantius) Lactant. lib. 3 de salsa sapient. cap. 25.
an angry man, and I will make him gentle; a covetous man, and I will make him
liberal; a timorous man, and I will make him valiant; a lustful man, and I will
make him temperate; a cruel man, and I will make him merciful; an unjust man;
and I will make him honest.

Thus the one is so taught, the other is so made. Morality seeks disciples,
but grace forms them. Morality hireth an house, but grace (as the soul)
fashioneth her own habitation.

The moral hypocrite makes duty to man a discharge from piety toward God.

Morality being humane has care of none but man. The things of God are (...),
things beyond the sphere of morality. Let God and Religion look to themselves.
Herein it is that the moralist differs from the Religious hypocrite. Both
these set the two tables of the Law at ods. The one is holy, what need he be
righteous? the other is so righteous, what need he be holy? It is hard to say
whether is better or worse, his unrighteousness holiness, or this man's
unhallowed righteousness; unless the party wronged give the advantage of evil
unto our moralist. For the other defraudeth them, but this man God. The other
pretends a protection from the Prince, to wrong the subject; but this man
makes a party among the subjects, to rise up against the Prince. For moraltiy
rested in, maintains a faction against Religion. And Socrates the father of
this faculty, was condemned for Atheism. That which is noted of strong wines
and waters, that they undo the Physician, because they either cure or kill; yea
rather kill by overcuring; may be not unfitly applied to morality. It makes
Religion, and spiritual Physic seem needless to this hypocrite; so
medicining him, that at last he dies, not so much of the disease, as of the
cure. What tell you him of prayer, hearing, reading and such like niceties?
Give him a man that keeps his word, pays his debts, tempereth his passions,
etc. These these things he does, and if he did them on good grounds, he were
half a Christian. But the Lord, when he sees fit, meets with this mate, and
because he makes conscience to pay men their dues; but pays no dues to God,
therefore God gives him over (through losses, suretiship, or improvidence) to
the misery of debt. Wherein (like Pharaoh in the red sea, when his wheels were
taken off) he drives a while with much ado, till at last the waves of bankrupt
swallow up both his estate and conscience; and he becomes that very reproach,
which he alone abhorred, even the wicked man, that has Job 20.19
undone many; that Psalm 37.21
borrows, and pays not again. Or if he fall not into this gulf; yet the
Lord has more ways then one to be even with him. He will suffer him to see or
leave children behind him, as far from thrift, as he was from grace; as far
from morality, as he from piety.

Differ.
Contrariwise, The disciple of grace performs duties to man, out of piety
toward God.

He dares not undo the sacred knot of the love of God and man; which the Lord
himself has knit in those two great Commandments; but by the one, adds
strength, and dignity to the other. Righteousness seals his holiness, and
holiness sanctifies his righteousness. 1 John 4.^
His love of God is approved by love unto man, and his love to man hallowed by
the love of God Tit. 2.11, 12
The grace of God that brings salvation, teaches him to walk righteously,
soberly, and godly in this present world: to Micah 6.8
do justice, and to love mercy, and to humble himself, to walk with his God: To
James 1.27.
visit the fatherless and widows in their adversity, and to keep himself
unspotted of the world, is a part and a proof of the purity of his Religion,
but not the whole of his Religion. Compare the continency of Alexander and
Scipio, with that of Joseph, and there is no comparison. They solicited not
their captives; but he yielded not, being solicited by his Mistress, that was

his Master, and for the fear of God. Lucretia (if both stories be true) is not

the one admitted the sin to avoid the shame; the other adventured upon death
with dishonor, not to sin against God. Diverse Heathen Princes have been
counted gracious Lords, and Fathers of their people: but Nehem. 5.15
Nehemiah took not the bread of the Governor, because of the fear of God. I
have not observed a greater act of humanity and magnanimity among all the

who in extremity of thirst, having water brought unto him, and perceiving how
his Captains put forth their necks, as he put the helmet to his mouth, poured
it on the ground, saying, If I should drink, the hearts of these men would
faint. But in the like case, the fact of 2 Samuel 23.16, 17
David carries apparent pre-eminence; for he added Religion to his abstinence,
and fear of God to his humanity. The jeopardy of blood was too costly a draught
for him; therefore he poured it forth, as a drink offering to the Lord. If any
will not be religious for his own good; God make him moral for the good of
others: but he is not happy that is not more then moral, to wit, religious.

The moralist therefore loves man instead of God: the Christian loves for
Gods sake. The one pleads honesty to shift off godliness: the other adorneth
godliness with the fruits of honesty.

moral hypocrite has for virtues only some shining and glittering vices.

Aug. Contr. Jul. Pelag. l. 4. c. 3.
Saint Augustine disputing against Julian the Pelagian Heretic (who maintained
the virtues of Heathens) with invincible Reasons proves, that true virtue
cannot be in any that are out of Christ. He admits their definition of
virtue, who say, it is an habit of the mind, agreeable to the measure and
model of humane nature: but he excepteth, that infidels understand not what is
agreeable and requisite, for the restoring and making happy of this nature of
ours: For that is performed by Christ alone, and him crucified; by whose death,
death is subdued; by whose wounds our mortally wounded nature is cured. To the
same purpose Saint Hierome Hieron. in Ep. ad Tit. c. 3
affirms, that there can be no virtues without Christ, who is the virtue and
power of God. For, how can there be any virtue in that is not just? or, how can
a man be just, unless he Heb. 2.^. Non bone bonum facit, quia non bonus facit,
quod non bona voluntate facit. Aug ub^ supra.
live by faith? Though the thing done may be good (as to relieve a distressed
man) yet the action, or doing, remains evil; because he does good not well,
who works, not being good himself by reason of his unsanctified will. Though
the soul seem to rule the body, and reason to have command over passions, yet
if both soul and reason be not servants unto God, their government is not
regular. For as it is not from the body, but above the body, Aug. de Civit.
Dei, l. 19. c. 25
that gives life to the body; so is it not from man, but above man, that
enableth man to live blessedly. They were not therefore true virtues, but vices
bordering upon virtue, and attired in the outward habit of virtues that made
such a glittering glorious show among the ancient Heathens; and at this day
seem, in some, to outface the profession of piety. For.

First, what virtues can they be, that have for their fountain reason
unsanctified? For though Pythagoras, and Plato allowed none for true virtues,
but such as were imprinted in the soul by God; Aug. ubi supra.
yet even they also were ignorant of true righteousness, because that is of
faith; faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of Christ. But unto such
as these the humility of Christ was vile, and his wisdom foolishness; so much
the farther from the truth by pride, by how much they came nearer in
understanding.

Secondly, what virtues are those, which instead in Gods glory (the aim of all
good actions) have any other end, and especially the honor of him that
performs them? For where some Philosophers (as the Epicureans Virtutes
Epicurus induxit voluptatis ancillas Aug.
and Pyrrhonians) sowed pillowes under men's elbows, making virtues handmaids
to pleasure; others were more cunning dawbers (as Pythagoras and Zeno) who for
their austerity, were the miracles of their times: yet if we distinguish (as we
ought) between virtues and vices, non officiis sed finibus, not by the acts
done, but by the intents of doing; we shall find even these latter to fall
into the same predicament of vice with the former. For what charity is it in a
covetous man, not to sue his neighbor at the Law, because he will spare his
own purse? what temperance, to abstain from pleasures to avoid expense? What
fortitude, to endure labor, hunger, (what not?) to compass profit? what
prudence to whet his wits to make benefit of all the ways of gain? But above
all shadows, the affectation of glory is most deceivable, and with many passes
for the very substance of virtue. Yet who sees not, that if men abstain from
all excess in natural delights, only to be well thought of, or (as those that
were wont to try masteries) to gain 1 Cor. 9.25
a corruptible garland, that unto such may be applied that of our Savior; Mat.
6.16
I say unto you they have their reward? And what is the liberality of the moral
man, but a negotiation of vain glory? his fortitude, but an honorable manner
of doing wrong? his temperance, but a singularity to procure reputation? his
prudence, but an artificial converting of occurrents to his own advancement?
Pleasure and profit are baits for base minds; honor is the idol of noble
spirits. Yet it is shrined no less in a tub, then in a chair of State.
Alexander and Diogenes were well met, when the one would be Diogenes, if he
were not Alexander; the other would be Alexander, if he were not Diogenes. Each
would have learned ambition of the other, but that his own pleased him better.
Each would give the other the second place, so he might keep the first for
himself.

Contrariwise, the disciple of grace has the truth of virtue, Differ.
though not the perfection.

The perfection of virtues he striveth, and sigheth after the truth he has
already attained to; because 1. John 5.20
he is in him who is true. In him he has found the true cure of his disease:
In him he has found whatsoever is requisite to make him truly virtuous, and so
truly blessed. Faith in Christ possesses him of true fortitude, to overcome
all difficulties in the way of well-doing, of true temperance, to obstain from
all allurements unto evil; of true justice, to give both to man the things that
are man's, and to God the things that are Gods; of true prudence to discern
things good and evil. These virtues are in him, Christ's army Psalm 110.3.
in the beauties of holiness, under the conduct of faith, Lieuetenant-general
under Christ; Virtus ei militat, a quo datur. Aug. in Ps. 45.
unto whom they serve as soldiers of his own making, which way soever faith,
working by love, advances the royal standard. For if prudence be the form of
moral, faith is the soul of Christian virtues. These, though invisible, make
him not only glorious within; but also comely in his outward carriage. Glorious
in the eyes of God, who acknowledges his own graces; comely in the eyes of
men, who see the light of his good works, and glorify his Father which is in
heaven. If he want glory in any eyes, it is in his own. For he has learned
that singular lesson (which morality never taught) to seem least, and lowest in
his opinion; and aiming at perfection of beauty, to see those deformities in
himself, which neither God will, nor man ought strictly to observe. Needs must
those be true virtues, which have the Father of lights for their Author; faith
in Christ; for their form; the glory of God, for their end; and humility for
their inseparable property.

Thus, in morality ye may discover some fair parts, or rather colors; but,
totum illud, Martial Ep.
formosa, nego; but in the Christian is rather comeliness of all parts, then
fairness of face. The moralist shines like rotten wood, but the Christian is
obscure as gold in the ore: The one seems better then he is, the other is
better then he seems.

moral hypocrite honors virtue, and discrediteth vice, rather by speech then
by practice.

The aim of hypocrisy is popular applause. Hereto for the most part, there is
not much cost or travel required. With some the beard is sufficient to make a
Philosopher; a loud voice and a voluble tongue, a preacher, and they that are a
little wiser, are yet caught with words. This the ancient Greek Sages did well
understand; and therefore gave words to the world good store, but they did but
verba dare, besprinkle with words; not so much to persuade others, as to
commend themselves. As for deeds, they left them to men unlettered, such as the
old Romans were; of whom (in comparison with the former) the Orator says (but
a Roman.) We have heard of their sayings, Illorum dicta accipimus, nostroris
facta vidimus.

but we have seen our own men's doings. And as they differed in sects, so their
contentions were waged collatis verbis, by force of eloquence, being in the
same taking with the Parasite; who, when he heard of other ridiculous Parasites
brought from beyond sea, had no help but to go home and search his books, that
he might be sure to bring better sayings then they. Here Plato clearly won the
spurs from all his Corrivals; yet so, that his writings were rather pleasant to
read, then powerful to persuade, as Saint Augustine notes. The Stoics by
degrees wan ground by their acuteness in disputation, austerity in manners,
and strictness of precepts. Of whom Plutarch wisely notes, that they squared
the level to the stone, not the stone to the level; that is, the rules of
virtue to their notion, not their notion to the rule; making the pitch of
Philosophy, not what a man could do, but whatsoever they could say. Thus they
seemed paratragaediare, rather to furnish a scene, then to keep a School. From
them proceeded those prodigious, and barbarous paradoxes. As that no man being
virtuous, is more virtuous; or, vicious, more vicious then another; that unto
tranquillity of mind, all natural affections, and passions are to be quite
taken away; that the way for a man to encounter or rather decline all troubles,
is to kill himself, and such like. This sect after the former crept in among
the Romans, but wrought no better effect. For (as one well observes) with the
Greek eiterature, the Greekish levity also found entire into that masculine
people; and virtue vanished into a wind of words. From thenceforth their
actions were such, as were rather to be talked of, then to be drawn into
example. For neither Cato, with all his rigidity, was tolerant enough to
reserve himself for better days; nor tongue-valiant Cicero resolute enough to
keep the Commonwealth from falling (and that through his fearfulness) into
the power of the Caesarians; nor Seneca (the Salamon of our moralists) with all
his sentences, wise enough to forbear that wealth which made his ravenous
disciple long to be his heir. Neither did this verbal Philosophy die with that
age. Even in our days Philologie has given the mate to real Philosophy, and
the notions of virtue serve rather for ornaments of discourse, then for
utensils of life. Who can endure to see him pass for a wise man, whose actions
sink as far beneath the vulgar in discretion, as he soareth above them in a
theatrical pomp of sentences? who can endure that in this light of heavenly
truth, vertures should be drawn (as nimph-like pictures) clad in witty
moralities, naked of divine habiliments, as fearing the fashion would change,
and the world turn Heathen again? Whereto these moralists seem to lead the
way, being so devoted to those idols of Gentilisme, that in manners they affect
to be their apes; in precepts, their parrats? who then can wonder, that such in
Religion prove themselves Ephesians. 4.14.

rather by his deed then by his word.

I must crave here to be understood (as also throughout this whole first part
of differences) of a Christian walking according to his rule; save which heaven
sees not upon earth any thing that is truly glorious and celestial: Far
beyond the spectacle of Cato Vticensis, tearing out his own intrals, De
Provident. cap. 2.
which Seneca supposed to be the best sight that ever Jupiter beheld. As for
those who live not after their rule, it is pity they should honor themselves
with the name of Christians, whiles they abase Christianity beneath heathenish
morality. For a mean and defective rule, being followed, produces a better
form then the best rule, when it is neglected. Of such a Christian therefore I
say, that first he fills his heart with virtue, and then Mat. 12.35
out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forth good things: First, he
kills vice in the nest, and then throws her out on dunghill. If you look for
Temples of virtues amongst Christians, you must look inward. For Psalm. 45.13.
The Kings daughter is glorious within; not like our moral Pharisees, who first
kill virtues in their hearts, and then build monuments for them in public;
Quae cord gestanda sunt, in lapidibus adorare malucrunt. Aug de doct. Christ.
lib 2. cap. 18. Aug. Contr. Adimant. cap. 11.
and choose rather to worship them in statues of stone, then to shrine them in
their bosoms. But there is a procession also of virtues, out of the heart of a
Christian into his life; that men may see and be directed by his light. For
words, they are his last and least care. For, as holy Writers differ from
profane, so do Christians from moralists. Their care was principally of things;
but these men's almost wholly of words. And easy kind of Philosophy. For what
is more easy, then to give virtue a good word, and let her go; or to reprove
vice, and not remove her; Facilius est improbare vitia, quam deserere
Facillimum excorari carnem, difficillimum non carnaliter sapere. Aug.
or to detest and speak evil of this flesh, and yet to remain fleshly minded?
It is therefore the last part of a Christians care to speak well of virtue, and
ill of vice; but yet a part of his care. For thus the graces of God are
notified, and vices discovered: yea, thus graces are communicated, and vices,
if not decryed, yet discredited. For this cause the Christian sings with David,
Psalm 45.1. Virtutum conscientiam magis quam jactantiam novimus.
My heart enditeth a good matter, my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

Thus the one has the vaunt of virtues, the other the conscience. The one
speaks great things, the other lives them.

The moral hypocrite does not blot out vice, but blauch it over.

Philosophy (says Lactantius) cutteth not off, but covers vices. It is a
color, Non loquimur magna, sed vivimus. Cyp. de bono Patient. Non exscindit
vitia, sed abscondit, Lact. lib. 3. cap. 25. Sibi objecit [paupertatem]
quisquis abscondit. Sen.
It may hide some deformities of nature, but it amendeth them not. Nay, it
makes them worse by hiding, as silly women do their faces by painting. And
when the parjet is off, the chinks will be the more apparent; yea, and to wise
judgments, even while it is on. For hiding is a kind of confession to them
that understand; at least, whatsoever a man hides, he lays it to his own
charge, as a thing whereof he thinks he has cause to be ashamed. Morality is
but network; it neither covers nor defends, but makes the sluttishnesse of
vice the more noted, when there is so much wiping used. Who could but take
notice of the skarre in Alexanders face, when he was drawn with his finger upon
it? Pride in Diogenes was but put up in a slovens case, when he trampled upon
Platoes carpets. And that renouned Curious, Curious dentatus, parvo quae legerat

though he supped upon roots yet ambition was his sauce. Ambition, that
preferred before gold the command of them that had gold; ambition, that
enlarges her desire as hell, and if it had as much territory as the Prince of
darkness, would yet remain unsatisfied. No marvel if gluttony, or avarice
yield to such a fury, as the pain of the gout, to that of the stone. Once as
surgery without Physic, may close the sore, but will never dry up the issue;
so morality, without grace, may peradventure keep the outside fair, but
cleanses not the heart, the Mat 15.19.
fountain of ill humors. Stoics think they have a trick beyond their fellows,
to take away, not the cause only, but the subject of vice. Not perceiving the
root of it to be deeper then passion, and that by such stupifying medicines,
they only dull the sense, but remove not the sourse of the disease.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the disciple of grace begins his reformation at the root of
nature.

As morphew in the face, so outward vices have their causes in the inner parts.
The cure therefore must be rather by potion, then by emplaister. Such
applications reach not to the heart. What can Philosophy help, when Tit. 1 15.
the mind and conscience is defiled? What can any thing help, but grace, that
can unmake a man, and make him new again? Christ's Physic works properly
upon that which is Mat. 15 18
within, and defiles a man; therefore must be taken inward, and from thence
the operation finds ready passage to the outward parts. As in the case of the
Lev. 14.44
fretting leprosy, it was not enough to take out some stones, or timbers, to
scrape, or plaster the walls: so in this fretting leprosy of sin, the whole
house of our infected nature must be demolished. A fault in the foundation is
not mended by rough-cast, or filling up the chinks: so in this case, not
reparation, but re-edification is required. Diruit, aedificat, he pulls down,
that he may build, is the Christians Motto. First, down with the whole pile of
sin; deny sense, appetite, will, reason and all; then erect the new fabric of
holy life, upon the ground of a sanctified heart. David in the expectation and
pursuit of a Kingdom, avoucheth nevertheless before the Lord, that his heart,
his eyes, his actions were, as of a Psalm 131.
weaned child, far from all haughtiness and ambition. Who ever so aspired
unto Sovereignty?

Thus the one is a Acts 23.3

sure foundation. Morality shreddeth sin as a garden knot; but Religion
stubbeth it up by the roots.

moral hypocrite keeps himself from some gross sins, but harbors
spiritual corruptions.

All that Philosophy can do, is to reflect corrupt reason upon her self; which
as it occasions her to look with loathing upon apparent crimes; so it helps
her to cherish, Apertissima vitia aliis vitiis vincuntur occultis, quaeque
putantur esse virtutes: in quibus regnat superbia, and quaedam sibi placendi
altitudo ruinosa. Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. 21. cap. 16.

and hatch up her most secret and ghostly corruptions. It is good being a
Physician where the disease is palpable, and the patient obnoxious. For who
will defend theft, adultery, drunckennesse, and such like loud-crying sins?
But there is a kind of still music of sin, admirably pleasing to the
unsanctified soul, to wit, the consort of spiritual vices, affected ignorance
of God, unthankfulness, vainglory; and above all, self-love, which bears the
base, and is the ground upon which the rest do descant. Open sins in them
(says Saint Augustine) are cried down by others more secret, which are
esteemed virtues; amongst which reigns pride, and a certain lofty humor of
self-pleasing, but portending ruin. Self-love the fountain of spiritual
pollution, is the ground of all Philosophical perfection. This instead of
resisting, they nourished in themselves: This instead of repressing, they
stirred up in their Scholars: this was their (...), their instrument for all
purposes, their topique place for all arguments unto virtue. Their goodly
(...), know thy self, imported a contemplation; not how bad, but how good they
were; did they search after truth? It was out of a mimical affectation to
corrupt the truth, and make it serve unto their own vain glory. Did they
subdue any sensual appetites, or passions? It was only, as taking their own
part; only to shake off those impediments of their tranquillity, those foiles of
their glory; so being afraid of the knife, they surfetted freely upon the meat;
and flying from ill neighbors, or malapert servants, they put themselves into
the hands of this worst of tyrants. Did they perform any virtuous actions, and
that (as they pretended) for love of the virtue it self? It was to make them
the more in love with themselves, when with the neglect of the opinion of
others, they rested in the conscience of their own worth. The Stoics Stoicorum
sapipiens, animal gloriae. Lud. vives in Aug. de Civ Dei. l. 9 cap 13.

defined their wise man, a living creature affected with glory. And a late
vain glorious animal of their cast sets up (as his Trinity) God, virtue,
and himself. Where it is manifest the two former served, but (as the Popes in
nomine's) to usher in the third.

Contrariwise, the disciple of grace cleanses himself from all, especially
spiritual pollutions.

The seed of God is a counter-poison against every sort, and lineage of sins.
Differ.
A rebellion there, is but no reign; a return there may be even of some
gross sins in the regenerate, but no quiet possession. We read not that ever
Aristides, or Phocion, did so foul a fact, as David did one, after his
conversion; And yet sin was suppressed in him, which in them was but repressed.
In them it had no vent, for want of occasion; and in him it brake forth by
inadvertence or violence of temptation. The sanctified soul is like the body of
Mithridates; Epoto saepe veneno toxica non poterant saeva nocere. Mart.
so attempered to the antidote of grace, that no poison of sin can kill it.
Therefore he recovereth, though of strong sicknesses; but the moralist
perishes with good signs. Above all, the Christian has this advantage, that
he alone is freed from himself, and is master of himself, because he only has
learned to deny himself. And where morality, as the North wind, makes men wrap
the cloak of self-love the closer about them; grace, as the Sunshine, giving a
greater heat, which is the love of God, makes us cast off the love of our
selves. Hereto both our often slips and falls conduce, making us see our own
weakness (and how much happier is he, that is humbled by falling, then he that
is proud of his standing?) and the beginnings of goodness, which put us in
mind how much we owe to him, by 1 Cor. 15.10
whose grace we are, whatsoever we are.

Thus the Moralist is like Jer. 48.11.
Moab, settled on the lees of self-love, and therefore in him his sent
remains: but the Christian is emptied out of himself into Christ, and so his
savor is changed. The one perishes of an impostume undiscerned: but the other
(with Hezekiah) recovereth, though of a plague sore, because his vital parts
are secured.

The moral hypocrite compares his rational course with Religion, taken at the
disadvantage.

If he will compare with the religion of Heathens, we will easily adjudge him
the better. For (as Saint Augustine Aug. de Civ. Dei. l. 2. c. 26
wisely notes) their precepts of morality were better then their Religion; and
their moral men far honester then their gods. The devils (cunning as they were)
whispered honesty to some few in secret cloisters, but kept open Schools of
filthiness in their public festivals and spectacles; Ego homuncio non
facerem. Tert. Eun.
content that those things should be fathered on them which they never did, to
draw the multitude to imitate them. Whence it came to pass, that their
Philosophy, that is, their wisdom, was one thing, and their religion another;
and the wiser sort worshipped those for gods, whose manners they were ashamed
to imitate. He is a bad Schoolmaster of virtue, that teaches not better
lessons then the devil. If he compare with those, who (Christians in name) have
defiled themselves with monstrous opinions, and gross superstitions, it is no
hard matter for him to excel. For reason at liberty, is in better case to be
her own guide, then conscience, Supra. char. 5.
clogged with a Talmud of unreasonable traditions. If he compare with such as
under pretense of piety, neglect justice and charity, he has met with his
match, as has been showed before. Aug. in Psalm. 25. fin.
If he compare with loose professors, who hold the truth of doctrine, but
openly deny the power of it; he has the same advantage over such, that a man
has, whose eyes are open in the twilight, over him that winketh in broad
daylight. The one follows a rule, such as it is; the other disgraceth his
rule, and serves but to pull down his own party. Non quod boni, sed quod
medioc^iter mali. Aug ubi sup.
These are the days wherein (if ever) moral men may justify themselves,
because, though they be not good, yet (comparatively) they are less evil, then
thousands of professors; and though not holy, yet not so filthy. But if the
Moralist presume to compare with those who are truly religious, he certainly
loses; yet he craftily makes choice of such, as through some personal
infirmities, or insufficiencies make not so fair a show to the world, but let
those things he as they may, and as the Lord in wisdom permits; as Ester
6.13.
Haman was told by his wise men, if Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, thou
shall surely fall before him; so say I, if this man be a true Israelite, thou
Moralist shall not Psalm 1.5.
stand with him in the Congregation of the righteous. The haughty Moralist
understands not, or over-looketh with disdain that which is precious in a
child of God; and therefore, if he profess not Atheism (which gives
greatest scope to worldly wisdom) he enclineth to Popery, which maintains a
pomp of ceremonious gravity, but troubles not the conscience with the power of
true piety.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the disciple of grace exalts Religion above the best of
morality.

Bring the whitest devil that ever deluded the world, and he shall appear
black, in his right color, compared with this true Israelite. The choicest
Heathens are but foiles to his virtues. He is more temperate then Curious; for
he denies not only his appetite, but his reason also. He is more tolerant then
Cato: for he can endure to see himself in the power of a tyrant; having learned
of his master, both to Heb. 12.2
endure the cross, and to despise the shame. He is more just then Aristides:
for he does right to God, as well as to man; and to the souls of men, as well
as to their bodily estate. He is more prudent then Phocion, or Epaminondas (the
masterpiece of morality) because he orders his actions to a supernatural and
spiritual end. He is more continent then Demecritus, Incontinentiam emendatione
proficetur. Tert. in Apolog.
that put out his eyes, because he could not look upon a woman without
concupiscence; for his eyes are safe under Job 31.1. Animo adversas libidinem

Caesar or Alexander, for he has overcome, not the fear of death only, but of
judgment; not others only, but himself; yea sin, and Satan, those others

he is more then a conqueror. Compare him with Scribes and Pharisees, and his

best righteousness. Above all these, and above all others not regenerate, he
has (...), Ibid. ver. 47
(as our Savior calls it) some apparent advantage. Apparent I say, not unto
the carnal view, but to him that sees as God sees. He has a sweet child-like
1 Cor. 14.20
simplicity, and uprightness of heart: a desire with denial of himself, to be
led Psalm 143.10
by the Spirit of God in the land of righteousness; a soul humbled with the
conscience of his own unworthiness; Genesis 32.10
and that sets all good things (wrought in him, and bestowed upon him) on
the account of 2 Cor. 3.5.
mercy.

To conclude, the Moralist is like the stars which appear not but by night, or
when the Sun is totally eclipsed; but the child of God is as the Sun going
forth in his might, before whom the brightest of those Jud. 5.31
twinkling stars, erratique in the sphere of morality, do lose their glimmering
light.

CHAP. VI. The Civil hypocrite is he, in whom respect of man stands instead
of conscience toward God.
THe natural and moral hypocrites receive their perfection (such as it is) from
themselves; the one from bodily temper, Defin.
the other from improvement of reason. But this hypocrite is framed by other
men; and embraces a show of virtue for their sakes to whom he bears respect.
The Moralist affects the commendation of a good man; but this man would be
counted a good member. And without question the respect unto man is a great
means, either to cherish the good of an ingenuous nature, or to curb the
rudeness of a vicious disposition; But,

First, this works not on all; some are so hardened in folly, that though you
should Prove. 27.22
bray them in a mortar, their foolishness will not depart from them. Civility,
as well as Morality, presupposes some pliablenesse of nature. He must not be
like blockish Nabal 1 Samuel 25.17
, so wicked, that no man may speak unto him; nor like the Luke 18.2
unjust Judge, that neither feared God, nor reverenced man, upon whom this
Physic shall work. Such are past humane cure (save that, as frantique persons,
they may be held in by force, or trained by deceit) and are uncurable, unless
by that grace which works as by miracle, and turns Esaias 11.
lions into lambs.

Secondly, where respect of man prevails, it works not a through cure. It
is but a fleshly circumcision, framing men to outward honesty, leaving the root
of a profane heart unwilling to be at Christ's command; as we see in the forward

Augustine shows out of Varro, that among the ancient Romans there was a
civil theology, that is, a Religion accommodate to the City, and to which the
Citizens were to conform themselves; so where there is good government, it
produces in the greatest number a kind of civil Religion, or Religion of
civility, which being entertained without the power of godliness, gives
definition to our Civil hypocrite. A Religion not freeing him from the bonds of
iniquity, but teaching him to line his fetters that they may not clink, and to
cast a long cloak over them that they may not appear. A Religion which may make
him carry the fruits of Canaan Numb. 13.24
(as the spies did) on a dry staff; but never to bear them from a living root.

in whom conscience toward God sanctifies his respect unto man.

He respects man, as is meet; but conscience (nearer then man) he respects
more; and God (greater then conscience) most of all. Here Civilty and awe of
man may be the porter, but grace is the householder. Princes and men of power
need not disdain to do the office of door-keeepers Psalm 84.10
in the house of Christ; nay, it is the proper service of Princes, by religious
government, to set open the gates unto this King of glory; by ruling the Jerem.

in all godliness, and then in all honesty. As that godliness is ungodly
which extends not to honesty, so that honesty deserves not the name of
honest, that either issues not from godliness, or is not referred thereto.
Christian Religion is not like that of Heathens Aug. de Civ. Dei. l. 6. c. 3.
, who first built Cities, and then instituted a Religion fit for the
inhabitants; nay rather, it first builds the heavenly City of the Church, and
then rules it, as the Law of Christ the founder and King thereof. A Christian
therefore is either made civil by grace, or his civility is made gracious by
Religion. No defect of nature is able to hinder this heavenly cure: no force of
government can claim the credit of this supernatural effect. He does not fear
God for respect of man, but respects man out of conscience toward God. Let
the hypocrite drive as fast as he will, carried on the wheels of humane
regard, the true Christian had rather limp in the right way, then run in the
wrong.

Thus the hypocrite is civil, that he may not need to be Religious: the child
of God is civil, because he is Religious. In the one civility is the the rival
of Religion, in the other the handmaid.

Civil hypocrite is all that he is by virtue of sober and good education.

There are four things by which men do sway one another; Education, Government,
Company and Example. From these the several characters or kinds of this Civil
hypocrite do arise; some from each of these severally, and other jointly from
them all. This Character may style our subject the well-bread hypocrite, who
for all the savor he has of virtue, or piety (though without substance) is
beholding to good Parents, Guardians, Schoolmasters, Tutors. The vessel still
reteineth some sent of the first liquor: so they that have been seasoned in
tender years, cannot lightly be without some relish, and as it were, tincture
of their good education. The want of this is a great disadvantage unto virtue,
a maime hardly cured; never so cured, but that it both leaves a skar, and makes
a man limp as long as he lives. It suffers the canker of self-will to fret so
deep, that Reason, Law, Religion, have much ado to bring such to the denial of
themselves. 1 Kings 1.5, 6
Adonijah used to have his will (his father never displeasing him, so much as
to say, Why do thou so?) at last said, and 2.13, etc.
I will be King, and nothing could make him let fall that pursuit, till he lost
his head. Plutarch Plut. in Coriol.
notes of Coriolanus, that though not of the worst nature (as appears by the
account he made of his mother) yet for want of education, he was so impatient
and wilful, that no man could converse or be acquainted with him. The neglect
of education therefore is an infallible presage of ruin, not only to persons,
but also to families and States. On the contrary side, good education gives
fashion and beauty, not only to particular members, but to families,
communities, kingdoms, and whatever bodies do consist of members so educated
and instructed. And to come nearer to our purpose, it makes men either not so
bad as others; or that it does worse become them to be evil; or at least, that
they sin not without many a check of conscience more then others have. But
what is all this to true goodness? nay, it shows a greater power of sin,
which easily forces these weak rampires; yea, and can make use of them to keep
our true goodness from her rightful possession. And as weak remedies use to
do, so these lenitives do give more mastery to the disease. They alter not the
evil of nature, but restrain it for a time, and make it afraid to discover it
self, as the Comic Poet Terent. Andr.
says.

Who could guess to what riper years would draw him,
While childhood, fear and masters eye did awe him?

their disciples to that plausible carriage, wherewith they have in great part
cousened and captivated the Christian world.

Contrariwise, in the well nurtured Christian, Differ.
education receives power and perfection from grace.

Grace does not bear children, and then put them out to nurse, but affords
the milk as well as the seed. Yea rather, it nurseth them first, and after
brings them forth; making use of good education, as of the womb, wherein they
are prepared and formed unto the spiritual birth; and so they are commonly
brought forth with less pain and difficulty: Education without grace, proves
but an abortive conception; for it is grace which actuateth all means and
instruments of goodness; A blessing which the Lord, though sometimes in his
unsearchable wisdom he withholdeth, yet ordinarily affords to the
conscionable care of faithful Parents. For, as Abraham and Lot by hospitality
lodged Angels; so these, by virtuous education, entertain Angels fellows,
heirs of heaven, into their houses. If grace enter in tender years, it is by
that door; if not, yet they shall not want their reward, who have given their
attendance, and opened the door for the King of glory. Whiles Parents and
Tutors are careful to season those tender vessels, the Lord replenisheth them
with goodness from above, and sends down a soul of grace to animate, and
enliven them. Herein the spiritual generation resembles the natural; spiritual
parents (indeed all natural parents should be such) can give but the body of
Christian instruction; but the soul of sanctifying grace is by God only and
immediately infused. The moment of this infusion is hard to discern; for holy
education, as it cherishes, so it obscureth the beginings of grace; as we see
in Timothy 2 Timothy 1.5.
, who being trained up in the faith by his grandmother Lois, and his mother
Eunice, is said to have 2 Timothy 3.15
known the Scriptures of a child. But of things in being, we may presume a
beginning. And though the cause do not always conclude the effect, yet the
effect appearing (which is here the new creature) both the instrument is
apparent, which is Christian education, and the Author most evident, who is the
God of grace. Of him in a special and spiritual sense, we are said to be both
James 1.18.
begotten and taught. He is both our Father and our Teacher John 6.45
, a teacher of none but to whom he is a Father: so surpassing all other fathers
and instructers, that in the Kingdom of grace, no man is to be called Father
Matthew 23.9
, or Doctor, but he; no man is said (comparatively) to have need Jerem. 31.35
to be taught by other, because 1 John 2.27
the anointing which is the holy Ghost, teaches all and all things.

Thus the one has education instead of grace; the other has grace with, by,
and beyond education. The one by parents, Potius ate subdita parentibus, quam a
parentibus tibi Aug. de matre sua Conf. l. 9. c. 9,
is subdued unto God; the other by God himself is made subject to the
discipline of parents.

The Civil hypocrite is good by Law.

We may call him in this place the hyrocrite at Law, or the Legal hypocrite. He
lives Philosopher Arist. Ethic. lib. 10. c. 9.
wisely pondereth the necessity of Laws for the ordering of such, with whom
respect of shame, honor and reason will not prevail; especially such laws as
impose penalties directly opposite to the pleasure men take in sinning; For,
seeing counsel, or command of parents, and private governors may be rejected,
there is need of a more potent and coactive power. Yea, whereas a private man
crossing our appetite (though on never so good ground) is counted an evil
willer, law is supposed to be indifferent to all, and has approbation even
from those who are lawless. So then, where education fails, the force of law
begins, and undertakes such as will not otherwise be ruled; being compared by
Saint Augustine Leges humanae mundatoria instrumenta sunt. Aug. de verb. Ap.
Sermon. 24.
to brooms which serve to sweep in the corn that flies out of the floor, but
they cannot make corn of seeds, or of chaff. Laws (though good) may well make
good subjects, good citizens; but cannot make good men. For he is never truly
good, who makes the authority of man, both the ground and measure of his
goodness. Thus does this hypocrite; For the ground, he professes the Religion
established by Law; but it is for fear of the Law, not for love of the
Religion. And were it not for the Law, he would as readily be of another, or of
no Religion; for, he that takes upon trust, must be no chooser. Thus (though in
the true Religion) he differs not from the blind heathens, who observed many
unreasonable forms of worship; not as pleasing to the Gods (so speaks one
Tanquam legibus jussa, non tanquam diis grata.

Magis ad morem, quam ad rem. Senec. citante Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. 6. c. 10


of themselves) but as required by the Laws, not so much for the thing, as for
the fashion. Upon the same trust he takes the measure of his Religion. And
because wholesome Laws of men (though intending the truth of piety in the inner
man) can exact no more but outward conformity; there this hypocrite sets up
his rest; resolved to allow as hard a penniworth of obedience as may be; as he
that has no other use of Religion then a malefactor has of his Psalm of
mercy, to save his best joint. Neither is he scrupulous to take any allowance
of Religion from authority. If Solomon should (for trial) propound to divide
this living child (this faith by which we live) his voice should be dividatur;
and better would he like it in halves then whole, as preferring a middle
lukewarm course, before either cold or hot. But if authority adjudge the child
to the true mother, that is, faith to the Scripture; none shall magnify more
then he the wisdom of such a Solomon; such were the Israelites Josh. 24.31
who in the days of Joshua; and of the Elders that outlived Joshuah, made a
shift to serve the Lord, Such was Joab, who living under a pious master, put on
a face of piety, so far as to reprove David 2 Samuel 24.3
himself about the numbering of the people. But, how slender (says one Quam
angusta innocentia est ad legem bonum esse? Senec. de Ira. l. 2. c. 27
) is that innocence, for a man to be no further good, then the letter of Law
requires? then the eye of Law discovers? The fear of Laws restrains not
wickedness, but licentiousness in sinning; driving them to that Popish shift,
if not chastely, yet charily, and with convenient caution. Notwithstanding, who
shall hinder the Lord in the wisdom of his providence, to make use of such
Aners and Eshcols, as of mercenaries in his wars? who shall hinder wise men
from holding them in the same rank with good men upon the Exchange; who though
they be not just dealers out of the love of virtue, yet there is means to make
them so? And if we must needs have to do with men without conscience; better it
is to fall into their hands, who consult with many, then of those who take
counsel of none but themselves. For he that advises with his lusts, is a
beast; he that calls none to counsel but his own reason, is but an odling;
but he that consulteth with Law (which is the common voice of the wiser sort)
shall be sure to do all things decently and plausibly.

Differ.
Contrariwise, The Citizen of heaven obeys man as a subject of Christ's
Kingdom.

In none but him do these two properties meet, a good man and a good Citizen;
nay (to speak properly) though others may be useful servants to the Government
under which they live, Vir bonus bonus colorius.
yet he is the only good Citizen and subject; because he only is subject to the
power, not for fear, but for conscience. The Roman Emperors (though enemies to
the faith) had no such subjects, no such soldiers, as the Christians. He only
gives to Caesar all that is Caesar's, who gives unto God that which is Gods.
For, Gods Law is spiritual, requiring the obedience of the inner man, even in
things belonging unto man; condemning carnal observers, as breakers even of the
Laws of man. Religion properly and primarily obliges man to God, and after to
man for Gods sake. Surely, if there be (as there is) a beauty in the due
subjection of man unto man, needs must the sub-ordination of all degrees of men
under God, surpass in glory: Those Courts wherein the Kings person is
represented, have greater majesty then others. And if there be an heaven upon
earth, it is among them who apply themselves in earthly affairs to the Laws of
heaven; whose treasure is in heaven, their heart in heaven, their conversation
(...) Phil. 3.20
in heaven, their hope in heaven, and their everlasting habitation prepared in
heaven. For this cause (says Saint Augustine) God showed in the flourishing
Roman Empire the validity of civil virtues, even without Religion, that men
might conceive how happy they should be, who by the additament of Religion,
should become Citizens of a better City, whose King is truth, whose Law is
love, whose Bounds are eternity. Where these two Cities meet in one, and the
Law of man gives strength to that of God; the Christian acknowledges it a
blessed direction (like the star to the wise men) both moving to seek, and
helping him to find the King of Israel. He follows authority therefore
willingly, but not blindfold, and the more he discerns his way, the more
rejoices he in his guide; being as glad of the occasion of virtue, as of
protection in a virtuous course. Hereto he adds sincerity, which the Law of
man may intend, but only conscience unto God can exact. And such is the power
of sincerity, that what he does in obedience to the Law of man, he would do
though there were no Law of man to enjoyne it. Yea, if God suffer him, for
trial, to live under Laws contrary to piety, yet will he perform obedience to
God and man. But then his obedience must be parted according to the divided
power of God, and of Caesar. God shall have his active obedience, for it is
meet to obey God rather then men. No threats of Superiors, no fiery furnace,
no den of lions shall make him deny the service of his supreme Lord. Never will
he consent the living child should be divided; rather let it live in
persecution under a false mother. Unto the Civil Magistrate he will afford
obedience passive, suffering him to dispose of his body and outward estate,
(which is all that he can take hold upon) nether obeying with impiety, nor
opposing with resistance; not at command in things against God, and yet always
under command.

Thus the one gives himself first unto man, and after to God by the will of
man; but the other gives himself first unto the Lord 2 Cor. 8.5.
, and after to man by the will of God. The one regards the letter of humane
Laws, the other the intent. The one acknowledges Christ for the authority; the
other in the authority. The one serves God because of the Law; the other
according to the Law, beyond the Law, without the Law, and (if the case be so
hard) even against the Law of man.

The Civil hypocrite is good for company.

We may here style him the good fellow hypocrite; a name (as now it is used)
not too good for so bad a subject For it signifies not a fellow in good, but
him that is good, to make a fellow in evil. He holds himself bound to do as the
company, because else he should seem to condemn, or contemn them; and it is held
incivility to cross the company, yea, not to join with those with whom a man
converseth, especially if they be many, if his friends, if his betters, etc.
And they that know a man by no nearer marks, may make more then a conjecture of
him by the company he keeps; that such as he is willing to seem, such he is,
or will shortly be if they be wicked; for, therefore he brings his tow to
their fire. Such he is, or would seem to be, if they be good; for, therefore he
lights himself by their candle. This man goes to Church, and to the Tavern
all with one devotion, that is, to the Company. And is like the sheep that
rusheth after her fellows, as well into the shambles, as into the fresh
pasture. An humor that has made many do amiss. Herod had not been guilty of
the blood of a Prophet, but for the respect he bare to his guests Mat. 14.9.
. And those two hundred men 2 Samuel 15.11
had not embarked themselves in the treason of Absalom, but that they were
trained to Hebron for company, under color of a feast. But sometimes this
blind guide chances to put men into the right way; no otherwise then some are
carried to Church in a throng, when their errand was to the Alehouse.
Ahitophel had been no servant for David, if he had not been one of the
multitude, whom he led into the house of God Psalm 55 14
; neither yet so, had he been a friend for David, unless he had more privately
conversed and conferred with him about holy things. Above all respects, the
respect of safety prevails with this man. For when it is dangerous not to
profess, he thrusts himself (like the hunted dear) into the heard of
professors: as many Heathens in the days of Queen Ester became Jews, because
the fear of the Jews fell upon them Esth. 8.17
. Such service is of base account in the eyes of the Lord. And well worthy; for
he that serves for company, affords but some sparings of time, some parings of
attendance. He must take heed he be no better then the prevailing lukewarmnesse
of the times will comport. He may meet the Lord at Church for the other company
that goes with him; but he will shun closet duties, because there none but the
Lord beholds him. He is a retainer, and will wear Christ's livery on holydays,
days of waiting; but in his ordinary conversation casts it off, or rather
turns the inside outward, which is the lining of a profane heart. Yea, and if
his great friends be Popish, he must have a dispensation also, now and then to
go into the house of Rimmon.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the sociable Christian both reapes, and sowes good in company.

As he is the better for good company, so he makes the company better where he
comes. He is glad when men say unto him Psalm 122.1
, We will go into the house of the Lord; and he is as ready to say unto them;
Esaias 2.3.
Come ye O house of Jacob, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. It is a
great achievement of Christian prudence to make discreet difference, and
choice of company. That one work well done, much after-labour is saved, much
trouble and contradiction spared, much strength and furniture unto virtue
stored. If his lot cast him upon evil company, how heavily he lamenteth! Woe is
me that I remain in Meshek, and dwell in the tents of Kedar Psalm 120.5
: Then he is a Lot in Sodom, a Joseph in Egypt, another Joseph of Arimathea
among the Pharisees, a Denis among the Areopagites. But, if they fear God (be
they otherwise what they may be) them he honors, them he inviteth as by
proclamation, Psalm 119.
I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and that keep thy precepts. He
alone is truly good in company, because he brings goodness into the company,
because goodness brings him into good company; because he is not without
goodness, when he is out of good company; for his Father who sees in secret,
is to him of more esteem and regard then all humane company. That of the sage
Isocrates ad Demon.
Orator with good Application is not to be contemned. Worship God at all times,
specially in public; so shall thou at once perform divine worship, and
conform thy self to thy fellow Citizens.

Thus the hypocrite suiteth or strippeth himself of goodness according to the
company; the Christian seeks company to his virtuous disposition. The one is
no changling, like himself in lewd company, but out of his element in good; the
other is always himself, at home in good company, and ill at ease in bad.

puts on goodness for the fashion.

We may call him in this regard the fashionable hypocrite. His Motto is, more
fit. Examples are very forcible, especially of the most and greatest. But it is
not true goodness, that enters only by the eye. As apes and dottrels imitate
the gestures of reasonable men, but without reason; so does this hypocrite the
actions of good men, yet without goodness. Summer brings in, not only flowers
and fruits, but also butterflies and caterpillars, which feed upon them, and
dress themselves up in the livery of the season: so the Halcyon days of
Religion; Solomon's days produce not only piety in common profession, but also
a many of these Summer-birds, these butterflies (gay, but unprofitable) which
make their advantage of the Churches prosperity. And though the fewest number
(at any time) be in love with Religion, yet in such times many will court her.
Joab a mere worldling, and a man of blood, yet living in good days had the
phrase and form of goodness. 1 Chr. 19.13.
Be of good courage, and let us play the men, for our people, and for the
Cities of our God; and the Lord do that which seems him good. The hypocrite
puts on goodness as many do the fashion, who yet are sick of it, and
beshrew the founder. No man more fashionable then he, but no fashion more
variable; he that has no ground of virtue, but example, shall have the same,
for vice more plentiful and more plausible.

Differ.
Contrariwise, The conformable Christian takes in goodness as an internal habit.

Example, and the current of good days may occasion him to come and see John
1.46
. But when grace (as the mantle of Elijah) has once overspread him, it is too
late to bid him return to what he was before; goodness has gotten a perpetual
servant of him. From thenceforth he is resolved and settled, not only to
flourish in good days, but also to hold fast in evil; If he cannot bring
goodness into fashion, yet to maintain in himself the forlorn fashion of
being good. Such are the Lords Jewels, for whom a book of remembrance is kept
before him; who, when wicked men open their mouth against heaven, do
nevertheless, not only fear the Lord, and think upon his name Mal. 3.16.
; but also speak in his behalf every one to his neighbor. Who Phil. 2.15.
in the midst of a nauhty generation, yet shine as lights in the world, and so
prove themselves the sons of God; but if not, yet cleave to the counsel given
to the holy Prophet. Jer. 15.19.
Let them return unto thee, but return not thou to them.

The one of these therefore puts on the habit of goodness; the other is
endued therewith, and habitutated therein: the one takes it up as the current
fashion, the other as his Lords perpetual livery.

The civil hypocrite often covers mischief under the cloak of legal
honesty.

Civility is not only a counterfeit of virtue: it serves also for a cover unto
wickedness. Sin is ashamed of the light, and walks abroad as thieves do,
with visors or false beards. And so easily are men deceived in the judgment of
good and evil that he seems to do well, who does evil in a civil fashion. A
wise man noted of Caesar, that he alone went soberly to work to overthrow the
State of Rome; not as Cateline and his accomplices, for they were not their
Crafts-masters. It is reported of Caesar's murderers, that the morning before
they were to do that inhumane fact, they sat in their seats of justice, and
dispatched businesses without show of perturbation. Cato, when he addressed
himself to that horrible sin of self-murder, was careful of the safety his
friends and followers; Ahitophel first set his house in order; Judas first
restored the thirty pieces of silver, a civil preamble to the hanging of
themselves; Simeon and Levi, under pretense of confederacy, butchered the
Shechemites; Herod and Pilate were reconciled and friendly joined together, in
the putting to death of the Lord of life. Pilate himself washed his hands, and
(as he thought) rid his hands of innocent blood, putting it off to the peoples
account, and that with their own consent. As malefactors and outlaws have
laws among themselves, which they must keep, or else cannot they stand: so this
sort of hypocrites do make Laws to themselves of outward honesty; being before
God a generation of outlaws and rebels; and many times toward men hatching
seven abominations; a generation (like the Jesuits) then least to be tursted,
when they speak most fair, when they look most demure.

not perfected; and their happiness in this, that sin is not imputed.

badge of true meaning.

bears himself upon his civil carriage in opposition to Religion.

It is pity so fair a thing (and in these days so rare a thing (as Civility
should be so much abused, that we should have occasion to find fault with it.
But experience makes us see, that as they who have resembled dead Princes
supposed alive, have been fit stales for rebellion: so this dangerous
counterfeit has given occasion to profaneness, to rise up in arms against
grace, and to carry away a great part of the world after deceitful illusion;
dangerous I may well say, both to himself and others. To himself, because he
sets this as a bolt upon his heart, and uses it as a strong fence to ward
off Religion. He justifies himself, and despises true purity of heart,
because he sees not that evil outside in himself, which happily appears in
some that make profession. And because he seems near to the Kingdom of God,
he never cares to come to it; being like a parallel line, that keeps a
scantling with the way of goodness, but never meets with it. How can he go
right toward happiness that neither discerns of the way, nor follows the
true guide? For in the sea of this world there is no good sailing without the
sight of heaven, much less toward heaven. He that has earth, that is, earthly
respects, always in his view, does but creep along the coast, and will never
arrive in the opposite harbor. To others, because he objecteth himself as a
Paragon to the view of the world, to pull down the price of true piety. Let
them compare with me (says he, or Satan that sets him to Job) such as make
scruple of an oath, or conscience of the Sabbath; such as cannot live without
the Word preached, nor satisfy themselves without private prayer. Thus as
Pharaohs Magicians by counterfeiting the miraculous works of God, hardened the
heart of that King; so this man by some resemblances, of good actions without
piety, occasioneth many to contemn true piety, and to condemn the generation
of Gods children. But if heed be taken, ye shall always discover some fallacy
or other in the comparison.

For first he compares himself with such as make only a profession of
Religion, without the practice and power thereof. Here it is not hard for him
to excel. For a mean trade practiced with diligence, gives more hope of
thriving, then the best neglected through idleness; and bad spices beaten,
yield more smell then the best, barrelled up. Let a Christian professor live
where he will among civil men, Papists, Turks, Infidels, if he be not far
better then they, he will be shamefully worse. The experience is too frequent,
and lamentable of this heavy curse of God on idle and barren profession.

Secondly, he compares himself with such professors, in whom there is a
notorious disadvantage. Religion in many begins late; and has to do with
corruptions habituated, and confirmed by long time, or by loose education: But
precepts of civility begin betimes whiles nature is tender and fit for
impression.

Thirdly, he shuneth the comparison of the best, and (as a coward) makes
choice of a weak adversary. And it is no marvel if civility get the start
lighting on wiser heads, more active spirits, together with a more favorable
aspect of the times. For men do more willingly and mor in differently behold
this civil shadow, then the substance of true piety. In them that are
religious, even virtues are counted faults; but in men without conscience,
spiritual faults and defects are counted virtues. Besides, Satan labors not
either to interrupt with tentations, or disgrace with oppositions, men that
live in a civil course, but rather cherishes this counterfeit, to confront
piety; whereas in them that fear God, he stirs up passions, and sharpeneth
them with injuries, to bring an ill savor upon their profession.

Finally, to our corrupt and carnal nature, this humane discipline is more
natural, then that of Religion; which propounds to correct nature, reason,
custom and all; and, to bring a man to that, from which nature is so averse;
that is, the dislike, and denial of himself.

Contrariwise the Citizen of heaven makes civilitie march under the standard
of Religion.

He provideth for things honest in the sight of God and man. 2 Cor. 8 21.
But mark the order; First, in the sight of the Lord, and after in the eyes of
men. Things of good report, and men, are his secondarie care. Even of those,
there is in him a truth and substance, which the hypocrite wants. In all
things he desires his best and fairest side may be inward toward God, and his
own conscience, for these are the best eyes to discern it. But he rests
neither in outward civilitie, which may be in an hypocrite: nor in the truth of
justice, and society, which makes him but half a Christian. Piety toward God
is the Queen of virtues, and all must come under her command, without piety
whatsoever virtue seems to perke up, is but an Agar, an usurper. Herewith a
child of God (with any indifferency of common gifts) proves a non-pareil,
matching and mating all the glorious paragons of men out of Christ. For, who
shall stand in comparison with Abraham, David, Paul, or any of these, in whom
grace has had her perfect work? Nay, that which was spoken of the Lord
contending with his enemies, is true (in a measure) of every child of his in
this competition: for, wherein they deal proudly, even in that is he above
them. Exodus 18.11.
;

Thus, the one uses civility as a bar against piety, the other, as an
officer, or mace-bearer. The one, to cry down the price of Religion: the other
to take away occasion from them that seek occasion to blaspheme her.

The Civil hypocrite soon changes his copy.

As he is taught by man, so may he be easily untaught. The respect of man
gives but a humane, and therefore an uncertain and unlasting ground of
goodness. Joash, after the death of good Jehoiada, hearkened to flatterers,
corrupted Religion, and became a persecutor of him in his son, whom he
reverenced in his person; It is not humane respect, that can long keep nature
(especially in great ones) from returning to her beat; Yea, such heat makes
men but the apter to take cold. Tamed beasts have their time of rage, and then
none more outrageous: so in this hypocrite (howsoever restrained for a time)
his madness will break forth, and be made manifest to all men; There is a day
wherein a fool will be known, when the best of Civil men will prove but a
bryar, Mic. 7.4.
and the most righteous of them but as an hedge of thorns. Prove him a little
in his profit, cross him in his appetite, and you shall see him turn Tigre, or
rather show himself to have been no other, then a Panther, which (they say)
will never be tame; There is much art in this hypocrite: but where is no godly
nature, there can be no spiritual life. A man cannot live by accident, or by
things ministered from without. Education, law, company, example, are but like
strong water, which may force a little cheer, but cannot infuse an inward
principle of life: Civility therefore without Religion cannot be long lived;
And it is greatly to be feared, least we (in this land) contenting our selves
with Civility without Religion, do forfeit Civility, and all. Yea rather, this
is more then a fear: the neglect of conscience so far prevailing that it is
now a kind of wonder to see a man, I say not, Religious, but wise and sober.

Contrariwise the fixed Christian never alters his well-chosen Principles.
Differ.


Whosoever first entered him into the rudiments of virtue, he is now become Gods
own Scholar. For they shall be all taught of God Joh. 6.45.
says our Savior. And not only in the axioms of faith, but also in the
precepts of love; For (says the Apostle) ye are taught of God to love one
another. 1 These. 4.9.
now, whatsoever is wrought of God cannot be undone; Deuteronomy. 32.4.
This is the difference between Gods works, and the works of man; I know
(says Solomon) that whatsoever God does shall be for ever. Eccles. 3.14.
Perpetual are even his works of providence, if we consider the perpetual
succession of them; much more if we consider how they are all referred unto the
everlasting estate of man after this life; But especially such are his works of
grace. He does not only enlighten his children, but enlive and quicken them. He
gives not only directions unto them, but according to his most great and
precious promises makes them partakers of the godly nature. And that godly
nature is a seed not only reforming them for the present, but also remaining in
them to keep them from falling back into the state of sin. Thus there is a
chang wrought in the child of God, not subject to any farther chang, as being
the work of him, in whom is no shadow of change. Jam. 1.17.
The gifts of God unto his child are without repentance. Rom 11.29.
his obedience unto his heavenly father is without weariness. God is always
present before him, always present within him.

The hypocrite therefore puts on Civility as a masking suit; what marvel then
to see him put it off; But the child of God is like the good huswife, and
grace, his scarlet or double raiment Prove. 31.21.
, which (the word importing double may signify scarlet, or double dye, as
some; or double raiment, as others more agreeably to the scope do interpret)
adorneth him in summer, and makes him not afraid of the snow in winter; The
one slippeth the collar of Civility when occasion is offered: the other, makes
verity his girdle, with which he is always girded.

CHAP. VII. The politic Hypocrite, or Hypocrite of State. Is he whose piety
is policy. Defin.

AS temperature, is the fountain, of natural inclinations; reason, of moral
resolutions; education, of the first impressions; custom, of habits; civil
government, of behaviors; company, of fashions, so is State, of pretenses. The
Civil hypocrite, and This, of State, do both respect men; but, with difference.
He, for the power they have over him. This, for the power he would have, and
exercise over them. For seeing his ends are to be achieved or advanced by
others, he must therefore necessarily conform himself to the regiment and
opinion of others, as the ladder by which he climbs.

Wherefore, though in his heart he says, as Pharaoh, Exodus 5.2.
who is the Lord? yet he must pretend with Herod Mat. 2.8. (...).
that he has an intent to worship him. His Religion therefore is formed in the
flexible mould of State, as best fits the kind of government that he manageth;
So, it becomes a Municipal Religion, wherein he follows reasons of State, not
rules of conscience, and yet he has learnt from his Master Matchiavel, to
manage that with such a politic prudence, that though he neglect it, he will
seem to tender it, in himself and others. His piety, as it is out of policy, so
it yields thereto, at his beck; withdraw thine hand, said Saul, 1 Samuel 14.29.
to the Priest, this is no time to ask Gods counsel.

It is to be bewailed that the spiders web of hypocrisy, takes hold not only in
cottages, but on Palaces. Prove. 30.28. Job 34.30.
and it were to be wished, that all the Palaces of Princes were ceiled with
Irish oak, that abides no spider; But alas! we see even under David's roof an
Ahitophel, and a Joab; and shortly after, upon his throne, a Rehoboam, a Joash,
an Ahaz; So hardly are these spiders either swept away, or kept away from the
high places of the earth, where they transfuse their venom into the body of
State, and infect in a manner all that do, or would bear rule.

Indeed Religion hardly grows on high grounds. The great men (says the
Prophet Jer. 5.5.
) have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds; and again 2.31.
we are Lords, we will come no more unto thee; Yet, it is much for their avail
to pretend piety, and rather to seem, then to be Religious.

Thus, the whole Religion of the Church, or rather Court of Rome, is nothing
but a mere pageant of State; The royal magnificence of their Temples, the rich
ornaments of their Altars, the affected gravity of their Priests, the
counterfeit holiness of their Monks, the theatricall pomp of their whole
service, their ridiculous rules of gesticulation, their various colors, and
different fashions of apparel; etc. all being a mere juglery and collusion.
Wherein their admired Emperor Charles the fifth was so well instructed, that
he did Cum cretensibus cretizare, jugled with them in their own box, Hist.
Conc. Trid.
when he held Pope Clement the seventh prisoner with his Forces; he seemed to
mourn for his captivity, commands his triumphs to cease, which were kept at
Valledolit for the birth of his son, enjoynes prayers to be made for his
enlargement through his Dominions, and yet kept him six months in hold, and
thought to carry him prisoner into Spain, had he not been dissuaded upon
reason of State, and not Religion. So Philip his son appointed solemn
supplications for his safe voyage into the Low Countries, Strada Bell. Belg.
Sueton.
when he never meant to go. They had a holy president of old from Heathen Rome
to warrant this mockery, Tiberius pro itu and reditu supplicationes indixit cum
non intenderet. A common trick for great men in power, among their peccadillos
to mock God.

On the contrary, The true Christians policy is real piety. Differ.


Herein agreeing with Christ his Prototype or pattern, who was prudent Isai.

or of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord. Princes, says David, Psalm.
119.23, 24.
did sit and speak against me, but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes
Also, thy testimonys are my delight and my counselors. When it was told David
2 Samuel 16.31, 32.
that Ahitophel had conspired with Absalom, he encountered him; First, with
prayer to God to infatuate his crafty counsel; and after, by wholesome policy
labored to prevent his design: the occasion whereof, by the coming of Hushai,
the Lord offered unto him immediately, as an answer to his prayer. It is not
flesh and blood, but the Word and Spirit of God that gives counsel unto the
faithful statist, whereby his reins teach him in the night; Psalm. 16.7.
and, he is made wiser then his enemies. Though a shell of Religion may be
conducible to outward ends, and aims, a child of God knows that God cannot be
deluded therewith, and that he abhors nothing more. Psalm. 119.98.
Thus while the State Hypocrite, as Hos. 11.12.
Ephraim compasses God about with lies; and, the house of Israel with deceit;
the true Christian Statist, as Judah, rules with God, and is faithful with
the Saints.

The Hypocrite of State. Howsoever he be affected, yet desires that the people
should

External shows of Religion procure an awful regard. Polit. lib. 5.
Therefore Aristotle advises a Prince to seem religious, at least, partly that
the people may not fear evil from him being a friend to the Gods; partly that
they may not dare to rebel against him who has the Gods for his friends.
Honor me, says Saul, before the Elders of my people, and before Israel, and
turn again with me that I may worship. 1 Samuel 15.30.
But the end of his worship of God, was his own worship; and, as some say, ad
faciendum populum, to make him self popular. Let the people know no other, but
that God and I am good friends; let me make as if I did worship. Thus Absalom
counterfeited, not only humility, but piety also, to hide his treason, 2 Samuel
15.7.
he had a vow to perform in Hebrew, who, notwithstanding this great show of
devotion, with the same conscience afterward lay with his fathers Concubines
in Jerusalem cap. 17.22.
Jeroboam 1 Kings 12.28, 29.
to confirm his new Kingdom, would not seem to abolish Religion, or to alter
it; but, to ease the labor of the people in going up to Jerusalem: he would
worship God, in other places more fit, and with less toil to his subjects.
Saul in show encouraged David to fight the Lords battles, 1 Samuel 18.17.
when indeed his design was to engage him in that hot service that he might
fall by the hand of the Philistines. In the height of his piety he makes use of
profitable impiety, Et quodcunque juvat hoc putat esse pium; Whatever furthers
his design must needs be pious; And therefore blesses the Ziphites in the
Name of the Lord, for giving malicious intelligence of David's abode, 1 Samuel
23.21.
when he hid himself from Saul, that thereby Saul might have an opportunity to
surprise and destroy him. Not so much as Rabshekeh, but would pretend that he
came from God, and was for God, against Hezekiah 2 King. 8.3.25.
that had taken away his Altars. And thus Simeon and Levi, brethren in evil,
pretended Religion, Genesis 34.15.
when they intended the slaughter of the Shechemites.

Contrarily. Differ:
A Christian Statist makes true Religion the basis of all his actions and
undertakings.

Whatsoever he shows before the people in reference to heaven, is from an
honest and an upright heart. He can truly profess with good Hezekiah, 2 King.
20.3.
Lord, I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and done
that which is good in thy sight. He knows how odious it is in Gods pure eyes to
dissemble piety before the people, and in secret to act strongly against it.

It was the happiness and glory of Queen Elizabeth's days, that though her
Court had hypocritical Statists too many, S. E. W. T. R. Camdeas Anual.
yet some she had, who being most vigilant for her safety against numerous
treasons; and, most sagacious discoveries of hidden plots, at exceeding great
charges, yet they ever held up both the reputation and sincerity of Religion in
all those their actings. And yet notwithstanding they thought it meet and
necessary before their deaths, not only to leave the wiles and fetches of
Statesmen; but to ask God forgiveness for whatever use they had made thereof.

Thus the Hypocrite of State, is all for specious pretenses that may exalt
himself, by a show of that outwardly, which in heart he despises; the true
Christian Statesman abhors all shows and pretenses that may lift up any man, or
promote any designs, but in subordination to God and the true Religion. The
one seeks to advance himself by the show of piety; the other to exalt God by
the truth and power of godliness.

has a conscience and religion for all times and turns.

He has Religionem innumerato conscientiam versatilem, so much just as will
serve his turn, and a conscience turning any way as the times change, after
the manner of a Windmill, that turns and makes use of every wind; or like the
naked English man, with cloth in one hand, and a pair of sheers in the other;
so is he in doubtful times. His Conscience as the sheers, and his Religion as
the cloth, fit to be cut out into any fashion. But till the fashion be resolved
on, his soul is naked of any good therein, like a white paper, in which write
what ye list, and be receives it: say what Religion, or irreligion shall take
place, and he is presently in the fashion: Now a Papist in Henry the eighth, by
and by a Protestant in Edward the sixth; then if Queen Mary come, Papist again.
Let her be but dead, Queen Elizabeth reduces him into Protestant again. In the
mean time he is of no Religion in truth, but like the Chamelion takes his
color from whatsoever he stands next unto. He alike favors, and
countenanceth true Religion, and false: with him, Orthodox, or Heterodox
matters not: if he like any better than other, it is that which best serves his
own occasions and ends. But wise men may easily perceive that his heart is
against the truth, rather then for it; for Baal rather then for God. Thus, as
some Seamen, he boasts that he can sail with all winds. He can do any thing
against the truth by tolerating any errors, to promote his own interest, even
while he goes out to do all things for it under pretense of conscience.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian is settled and fixed in his Religion.

Good times help him, but evil times cannot remove him from his God, or his
truth. In the one he flourishes Psalm. 72.7.
as the tree in summer; In the other, he holds the sap of grace in the root
of an honest heart, as the tree in winter. Good times do rather find him then
make him virtuous; and evil times do exercise, but not turn him off from
truth, or change him from goodness. He is as the compass at sea, which
discovers the wind, but points only to the pole.

Thus, the one traveleth for pleasure, according to the company or weather, and
in matter of Religion, he is as the wandering beggar, never out of his way; the
other sets out and holds on as a man in business, that must go the same way
fair or foul, in company, or alone; Josh. 24.11.
needs must he go, yea run whom Christ draws; Cant. 1.3.
and in that way he fears no Lions; or, to be slain in the streets, because he
holds it needful that he go not needful that he live. The worldly Politian is
resolved to be nothing, but what h^ is ready not to be; that he may be fitter
for those in power and place whom he has ine admiration for advantage sake;
the true Christian Statesman abhors all changes of Religion which may argue the
least unfaithfulness to his Prince the Lord Jesus Christ: and chooses rather
to suffer afflictions with the people of God in greatest disgrace with the
Pharaohs of the time, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin, or the favors of
sinful men that lay Religion waste to exalt their own designs with sleighting
of God, or trampling upon the faithful of the Lord.

This hypocrite entertaineth Religion at the staves end.

He is afraid it stould come within him, or too near him, and so get the
advantage of him. Therefore he deals with it, as the Germans do with the
Italians; or as the Low Country men with the Spaniards with whom they enter not
too near familiarity, although they hold an outward cold correspondence with
them. As Jacob and Laban set up stones, Genesis 31.52.
of division, that one might not come too near the other: or, as Elisha gave
order, to shut the door 2 King. 6.32.
upon the messenger, of Jehoram, and to give him a short and sharp answer, lest
his master should press in with him.

Contrarily, the true Christian embraces Religion as a bosom friend. Differ.


Wisdom enters into his heart, and knowledge is pleasant to his soul, Prove.
2.10.
He thinks it can never come near enough; His delight is in the Law of the
Lord, and in his Law does he meditate day and night; Psalm. 1.2.
Gods testimonies are his counselors, and hereby he has more understanding;
Psalm. 119.24
then Machiavel, or Malvezzi, or all the precepts of profane policy in the
world could ever infuse into their disciples, I understand more then the
ancients, because I keep thy poecepts, says he, Psalm. 119.100
that had seen an end of all other perfections, and was as an Angel of God to
discern good and evil, 2 Samuel 14.17.
and none could turn to the right hand or to the left of all that he had
spoken; ver. 19.
by way of discovery of the wiliest Joab, in the tongue of a simple woman.

Thus, the one says to Religion (where it is in power, and cross to his
designs) stand apart, for I am (if not holier, yet) wiser then thou; to the
other Religion is as the garment which covers him, and for a girdle wherewith
he is girded continually. To the one, Religion is as the Philactaries upon the
skirts of the garment; But, far from the heart; to the other, it is (as the
Corinthians, to Paul, 2 Cor. 7.3.
) in his heart to live and die together.

The hypocrite of State has his Conscience most exercised about smaller
matters.

In things of light moment, he will deal squarely, seem jealous of his word
and faith; and careful to walk in or above the common road, and rule of
honesty. But there are many reserved cases, of an higher nature then either his
Religion or honesty cares for: When it stands upon the advancement of some
pernicious designs of State, then has he other principles to walk by; then
his positions are, Regni causa violandum est jus, no matter for right or
justice when a Kingdom is in his eye; No faith is to be kept with Heretics,
that hinder his gain or his greatness, if he get them into his net. No promise
must bind a man to his inconvenience, if he find more benefit by breaking of
it, then his plea is, I was mistaken, God has opened mine eyes to see a
clearer light. Thus is he penny true and pound false: and his true dealing in
petty things serves but to purchase him credit, that he may the better deceive
in great matters; But woe worth those Ahitophels that have made Politiques to be
anomalous from Christians Ethics; and Politicians to become outlaws from the
Commonwealth of God.

Contrarily, a true Christian keeps a good Conscience in all things. Differ.


Lesser, and Greater, are but circumstances of wrong, which either extenuate or
aggravate the offense toward men; but, before God, where the conscience is
corrupt and ever is designed, the sin is great even in the smallest matters;
And he that makes bold with God and conscience in smaller, will quickly fall to
higher faults; For he that wittingly and willingly offends the Law in one point
is guilty of all. Jam. 2.10.
To deny obedience in any thing, is to obey in nothing; and is a great sin
against the dignity and authority of the whole Law. One allowed deliberate
violation of the royal Law, even by the least sin, is an aggravation rather
then an excuse; forfeiteth all our righteousness, and makes us obnoxious to
the whole Law Therefore a true child of God will have respect to all Gods
Commandments, Psalm. 119.6.
and walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances of God, blameless. Luke 1.6.
He will pass over nothing, which he ought to have done in the matter of
Judgment, or the love of God, nor will he leave the tithing of mint, rue, or
any manner of herbs undone. Luke 11.42.
So far as the Laws either of God or man requires it of him. He dares not set
policy on horseback, and make Religion go on foot; nor to use his Conscience as
Balaam did his ass- Number. 22.23, etc.
to carry him on whither covetousuesse and ambition would willingly lead him;
much less will he smite her, when, for going that way, she crush his foot
against a wall; or, threaten to kill her for refusing to go further therein.

Thus the one will do something that he may not be thought to do nothing,
(although his something be nothing in comparison of what he owes) the other
will not only be careful of the maine, but not omit the least duty that may
give proof of his conscionable observance of the whole Royal Law.

favors Religion; but, against Religion.

He sets up Altar against Altar, Preacher against Preacher, and Sect against
Sects, countenances all. Henry 8.
Thus many Princes, not loving the Gospel, yet were willing to join against
the Pope, as an enemy to their temporal State and quiet. And some have parted
stakes with Antichrist, abjuring his jurisdiction, but retaining his
superstition.

Thus some of meaner rank, not well affected to the preaching of the Gospel,
can be content to countenance some one Minister to the disparagement of others;
and, to commend one whom they love not, 2 Chro. 25 16
to detract from others whom they hate. This man will have a pretense of
goodness, though against goodness. Therefore he calls good evil, and evil
good, as either the one or the other serve his turn: he charge duty with
undutifulnesse; zeal, with faction; Jer. ^9.26 and 38.4. Amos 7.10. etc.
and sedition and justice with cruelty. Numb 16 41


Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian Statist favors true Religion out of Religion,

He favors men for their Religion; but, Religion for it self. All Saints are
to him excellent, Psalm. 16 3.
all that fear God are his companions; Psalm. 119.63.
if not in acquaintance, yet in the Communion of love and mutual prayers; all
of them that bring the glad-tydings of the Gospel, are to him beautiful. Romans
10.15
He joins himself to all that are religious, that he may be directed, or
accompanied in the way of piety, and probity; remembering that of the wiseman.
Prove. 13.20.
He that walks with wise men shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be
destroyed; with him, every wicked man is a fool. Psalm. 73.3.


Thus the State hypocrite courts Religion (whiles beautiful, and observed) as
his Courtesan, to satisfy his lust; the other, marries her, and that for ever.
To the one, when cast off by the world, her old age is a Cooler; To the other,
her antiquity is an incentive to his chaste affection. If she come into the
assembly with a Gold ring and in goodly apparel, the one says, sit thou here
in a good place. Jam. 2.2, 3.
But to the other she is precious, even in vile raiment and rags. Nor does he
love her the less, if besmeared all over with dirt and filth by a lewd world,
but embraces her as heartily on the dunghill, as on the throne; in an iron
chain, as in one of gold.

The hypocrite of State is a temporizer.

He serves God for the times sake, and the time for his own sake; He likes
that reading of (...) instead of (...) Romans 12.11.
(...) serving the time, rather, then the Lord; and could wish it so through
out the Bible. The true Religion with him is like those meats and cates that
are not always grateful. But in their proper season like Ahitophels counsel,
not good at this time. 2 Samuel 17.7.


He remembers that old Marquess of W. who stood unshaken in the vicissitudes
of four Princes of alternate principles, by mere temporizing; being made of
the plyant willow; not stubborn oak. He will be always of the prevailing
faction and fashion, for his Religion. If Religion be like Esther to Ahusuerus,
in request, where he as high and proud as Haman, he will glory in her favors.
Esth. 4.12.
and petition her even as for his life. Esth. 7.7.
At another time, he is as ready to do by Religion as Jezabels Eunuchs by her,
even to cast her headlong out of the window, if a ruffling Jehu require it. 2
King 9.32, 33.


Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian Statist serves God in all times.

He espouses Religion, as his honor and comfort in prosperity and adversity.
He serves the Lord for his one sake, and the times for the Lords sake, as
David served his time. Act. 13.36.
and as Noah was said to be just in his generations. Genesis 6.9.
a wicked man in his lusts and plots; he will not serve, knowing that he who is
once a knave, shall be ever a slave. While the hypocrite writes for his motto,
in season; the true Christian writes, for his, In season and out of season. No
time is to him unseasonable to show his love to God by serving him on any
terms: The will of God he is content to do. Psalm. 40.8.
though it cost him his life. Heb. ^0 9.10 Phil. 2.17.
When God has any work for him to do, it is meat and drink to him to be at it.
Joh. 4.34.
And this meat he will hold himself to, although others that have (as they
think) prepared him better fare, know not of it, ver. 32.
because the same mind is in him that was in Christ Jesus, Phil. 2.5.
to esteem every word of Gods mouth more then his necessary food. Job 23.12.


Therefore the Statist of the time, feeds upon Religion as the Locust, while
it is summer; and starves at winter. The true Christian Statesman, as the
Pismire, gathers so much of Religion in summer, that he has enough to preserve
himself and Religion too in the sharpest winter.

The hypocrite of State in public affairs has private respects.

One while he does things generally good and profitable; But, for several ends
respecting himself. Another while he urges Religion and justice upon others,
himself being exempt by his own reservation. Thus the unghostly high Priest
charged our blessed Savior by the living God, Mat. 26.63.
to confess that whereupon he meant to condemn him. And those Knights of the
post that were hired to witness against him, put on the habit of just men, that
they might bring our Savior into a praemunire at least concerning Caesar. In a
word, he is one of those who press many Laws upon others (and those very
strict) but keep none themselves; binding heavy burdens, and grievous to be
borne, on other men's shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one
of their fingers. Mat. 23.4.


He severeth the public good far from the private; and, by the one, overthrows
the other. Justice to private persons whom he has a mind to crush or
oppress, is born out with a preference of public safety; It is, says he,
expedient that one man die for the people, Joh. 11.50.
and with this maxim he thinks he may safely ruin, yea, murder any man that
stands in his way. Likewise public mischeifes and depopulations are admitted
and excused upon the same account, when in truth and indeed, nothing but
private benefit Certe homines, plerique omnes, quicquid praese ferunt, non plus
in publicis sentiunt, quam quantum ad res privitas pertineat. Camb. Annal.
is the first wheel that moves in those eccentrick motions. And as he is in
his own personal actings; So such as are employed under him, either are, or
quickly will be. If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked, Prove.
29.12.
that they may make the King glad with their wickedness, and the Princes with
their lies; Hos. 7.3.
If he be for bribes, and with shame loves, give ye, he will not be without fit
hands to receive them. Galba had his favorites, Vinius, Laco, and Icelus, his
man; so will these, their instruments, that, Hos. 4.18.
with the horse-leeches daughters, Prove. 30.15.
without shame, will cry, give give: and he will suffer himself to be sold
every hour, that he and his may thereby enrich themselves at the charge and

The religious Statist constantly carries a single eye to the public good in
his most earnest prosecutions of his own private interest.

He seeks not to make the State little, and himself great; Judge. 8.12, 13
to make it poor, and himself rich; Neh. 5.10. Esther 10.3.
to make it base, and himself honorable; but, his courses are (like
Demosthenes counsels to the Athenians, not always good for him to give, but
always good for them to take;) not always good for his own private gain, yet
always good for the public emolument. He is a corrupt Politician, that refers
all things to himself; that never cares what becomes of the Argo of the public
interest, so he may save himself in the cock-boat of his own private fortunes.
But if the ship of the State must needs miscarry, he had rather perish in the
unhappy wrack, then save himself by any base inglorious shift, or subterfuge.

the less he be loved; And while the Politician will not suffer his Prince to do
a benefit to a private man, but he will have a feeling of it, if his Master
shall be so noble as to bestow a benefit gratis, as Elisha sometimes in the

to say (and swear too) as the Lord lives I will run after him and take
somewhat of him. The godly Statist when the State is low, and the people in
straites, will rather forbear his own just allowance, not eating the bread of
the Governor Neh. 5.14, 15
, although set out by public agreement, and formerly enjoyed by preceding
Governors. And as he is careful that himself do not poll or oppress; so he
provides that none do it about him bid.

has been over-seen and abused, as David by Ziba 2 Samuel 16.3, 4

sycophants and liers Psalm. 101.
. For well he knows that a Statesman, if he permit those whom he ought to
have bridled, to take bribes, or any way to wrong the public for the advantage
of private men; or if he shall suffer himself to be ignorant of what he ought
to have known, he thereby opens a way to his own destruction, although innocent
of much evil that passes under his name.

Thus the worldly Politician is as the Hedg-hog that never goes abroad, but to
gather what he can for himself, who ever suffer by it; the true Statesman, is
as the Pelican, that draws out her own blood for the good of others.

brings in religion to countenance mischief.

He imputes to God what he owes to the devil, his own lust or the sin of
others. Thus Saul religiously, or rather impiously makes use of the Name of
God, and blesses the Ziphites from God (as was noted before) for their
mischievous information against David; Blessed be ye of the Lord, ye have had
compassion on me 1 Samuel 23.21.
! Thus the Pope establishing, Stews by a Law, thinks himself discharged, by
sending Priests to exhort those strumpets to repentance. Pope Sixtus Quintus,
in a solemn Oration touching the slaughter of Henry the third King of France,
instead of detesting the parricide, a work of the devil, wondreth at that work
of God! that an unarmed Friar should kill so mighty a King! Jezabel 1 King.

pretended also to worship Christ, when he should know where he was, but his
intent was to kill him. Thus Jehu says to Jehonadab, Come and see my zeal for
the Lord King. 10.16.
; his word was the Lord, but his aim was the Kingdom. He pretended nothing but
God, in destroying Ahab root and branch; but both might have lived, had it not
been for hope the Crown to be set on his own head; and upon this account his
zeal extends to the destroying of Baal too, the sin of Ahab, but retains and
maintains the Calves of Dan and Bethel; the sin of Jeroboam, as a fundamental
Law of that State, not that he cared for either, more than Judas for the poor,
but out of State Policy to secure (as he thought) his Crown the better. But
after all his vain boasting of false zeal, though he did not only Gods will,
but his command, yet God discovers him to be but a Politic murderer in heart,
when with his hand he executed all that was in the heart of God 2 King. 10.30
. Therefore God threatens, Yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of
Jezreel up- the house of Jehu Hosea 1.4.
. He looked at himself and his own ends; for accomplishment whereof, when God
was in his mouth, the devil and mischief were in his heart: therefore that God
who gave him a temporal greatness for doing Gods work against Ahab, followed
him and his house with an everlasting curse, for intending his own greatness
instead of Gods justice upon Ahab.

Differ.
On the Contrary, a true Christian Statist makes Religion a contramure and
bulwark to keep off from mischief and sin, even when it is in his hand to
commit it.

He says as Joseph, How can I do (or suffer) this great wickedness, and sin
against the Lord Genesis 39.7.
. It was Religion, not simplicity that stayed David from killing Saul, 1 Samuel
14.3, 4
when providence brought him into the Cave where David and his men were Genesis
39.7.
. He dares not countenance evil, that good may come thereof, much less pretend
good to produce evil. Fox Mart.
It was the noble resolution of our English Josiah King Edward the sixth, much
pressed to allow Mass in his sister Mary's family, by reasons of policy, from
his danger of denying it, the breach of amity with the Emperor, who solicited
it, and other mischiefs; to expose his State and life to danger, rather then to
grant any thing contrary to the truth, Camd. Annal. S. A. P.
and dishonorable to God. And, as Christian-like an answer was that of a
worthy Knight and Statist, who being desired to connive at the corrupting of
one of his servants, to betray a great Personage, that he might preserve a
greater; said, Nolle se quenquam e famulis suis per simulationem praeditorem
fieri; no servant of his should by hypocrisy be made a traitor to prevent
treason.

Thus, as the toade sucks the herb to convert it into poison; so the Politician
makes use of Religion to destroy, not to do good to himself or others; but the
true Christian Sates-man, as Daniel makes use even of the oil of Scorpions,
and of the greatest venom of evil men against Religion, to support and
preserve it.

The hypocrite of State forbeares a small evil that he may do a greater.

Haman thought scorn to lay his hands upon one single Mordecai Esth. 3.6.
, but refrained himself till he might be revenged on the whole Nation of the
Jews at once. Simeon and Levi would not slay Sechem only, etc. Genesis 34.13.

even the smallest as well as the greatest.

He knows that an evil foundation will never support a lasting frabrick, since
God is the avenger of all such things. He will rather with Joseph, suffer any
extremity, then commit any sin, how common soever the world make it, and how
little soever they do account it. He will endure the greatest evil of
affliction, rather then have his hand in the least iniquity; and will abstain,
not only from real evil; but, from all appearance of it 1 These. 5.2^.
, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh Jude 23.
, as well as the flesh it self that cast on those spots.

Thus the State hypocrite makes choice of sins, rejecting some as contrary, not
unto God, but to his design; the other abhorres all, how conducible soever to
his carnal ends, because contrary to God.

The hypocrite of State embraces Religion with respect to worldly greatness.

The Scribes and Pharisees, who were hypocrites, seemed the most religious, and
were the strictest Sect among all the Nation of the Jews. What drew them on so
far? The love of salutations in the market places, the chief seats in the
Synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at Feasts Mat. 12.39, 40
; and, to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi Mat. 23.7.
; aiming rather to be great, then good. And if such men find themselves
deceived in their expectation, and that Religion advances them not, they can
soon take leave of it, and betake themselves to any other ladder to climb up to
their affected height, though they fall and perish in the attempt, as Simon
Magus Acts 8.
who would purchase that with money to make him more famous, which he saw his
counterfeit conversion and external baptism was not likely to produce. If
Constantine embrace the Gospel, how many of his ambitious Officers and
Courtiers will turn Christians too? yea, it is reported Magdebur. Cent. 4.
cap. 1. out of Nicephorus. Lips. de Constable.
that the same year wherein Constantine was baptized, twelve millions of men,
besides women and children were baptized also. But, if Julian apostatize, they
will not be long behind him; who have hopes that apostasy may raise their
fortunes under the Apostate. Thus Lipsius turned Romanist, partly admiring the
old Empire of Rome, and partly flattering the new rising Monarchy of Spain. On
the other side, some upon hope of advancement, or fear of mischief have come
over from Popery unto the reformed Religion Arch. bishop of Spalato.
, who, if baited with greater promises and hopes by the other side, will soon
return with the dog to his vomit, and with the sow that was washed, to the
wallowing in the mire. Such State Converts were never known to be good,
whatever pretenses they made to goodness, but ever retain, Samaritan-like,
too strong a savor of the old leaven, being by ambition metamorphised into a
new shape, but far from being changed into a new nature. They still retain the
substance of their old Atheism, varnished over with a light tincture of
Religion.

Differ.
Contrarily; A Christian Statist prefers goodness before greatness, and
Religion before riches.

If the tide of Religion lift up goodness unto greatness, he rejoices that
God has raised him up for such a time as this, whereby he has the greater
opportunity to advance the Throne of Christ, to do good to them that fear God,
to countenance the faithful in the land, and to cut off wicked doers from the
City of the Lord Psalm 101.6
. If the torrent of troublesome and ungodly times sweeps away all piety, so
that he that departs from iniquity, makes himself a prey Isa. 59.15
, yet his resolution is like holy Joshuah's, I and my house will serve the Lord
Josh. 24.15
; no decrees of men shall make Daniel even at the top of honor in Darius his
Court, to neglect his duty to God, although he know that for so doing, He shall
be cast into the den of lions Dan. 6.7
. And when persecution is at the hottest, Obadiah will preserve (what he may)
the Prophets of the Lord, not fearing the fury of Jezabel in her bloody pursuit
of them all 2 King. 17.4
Jonathan will plead the innocence of David to his enraged father in despite
of the javelin 1 Samuel 21.32, 33.
. He will ever show himself to be on the Lords side, and for his servants in
their greatest disgraces and reproaches of men. He will no more have the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons James 2.1.
, then of times.

Therefore the common Statist entertaineth Religion as his ladder to rise
higher in the world; the Christian Statesman, as Jacobs ladder, thereby to get
heaven. The one makes it Jehu's stirrup when he has a mind to ride Post to
preferment; the other, as Solomon's bed, wherein he desires to repose himself
with Christ, when weary of carnal policy.

Jews, because the fear of the Jews fell upon them Hest. 8.17.

in heart, yet made a show of subjection. A thing ordinary seen in the conquest
of truth, that they that cannot make their party good against it, will seem out
of conscience to subscribe unto it, being as cunning as Marcellus, who when he
was to strike a battle with the Gauls, his horse starting forth in despite of
him, and carrying him from his company, when he recovered the command, he
wheeled to the East, and worshipped the Sun rising, that his soldiers might
impute unto devotion that which began in necessity, and could not by him be
avoided. Or as Caesar who casually falling flat on the ground at his arrival in
Africa, cunningly turned that ominous chance into a pretendedly voluntary
design, saying, I take possession of thee O Africa.

best choice.

, all other things as accessories. The first work of good Rulers has been the
Reformation of Gods house, the Church 2 Chr. 29 3, 4 34.3, 4.
delighting in the beauty thereof. Thus David professes, I have chosen the way
of truth Psa. 119.30. ver. 173.
and I have chosen thy precepts Luke 10.42
; understanding is rather to be chosen then silver. This is that better part,
which shall not be taken from him Luke 10.42

This was David's vow for reformation of himself, his family, and Kingdom, as
appears upon record Psalm. 101.

spur to stir him up to virtue, and keep him close to the duties therein
promised; which we find accordingly performed Ps. 119.106.
. I have sworn and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.

Thus the Politician makes Religion his muce hole, when he can no otherwise
prevent a mischief; the Christian makes use of it as his citadel wherein he is
sure to be safe.

makes Religion a mere instrument of State.

Thus Jehu will go beyond Ahab in serving of Baal, to make the Fast he
proclaimed, 2 King. 10.18
an engine to get all the Prophets of Baal into his pit-fall! Jeroboam held up
the calves, that he might hold up his new-gotten Kingdom 1 Kings 12.
. And indeed few there are who look further in embracing Religion, then to use
it either as a means of correspondence with neighbor Princes and States; or as
a course to reconcile to bring under his Subjects, or as a support to his own
State and greatness. Thus Numa Pompilius, Lycurgus, and other ancient
State-founders have pretended acquaintance with the gods, to make the people
receive their Laws with greater admiration and subjection. Thus the French
story aptly terms Henry the fourth, his revolt to the Romish Religion, a
great action of State. Such are least to be trusted in matter of Religion, and
little more in matter of State, seeing they dissemble the one, to deceive in
the other. As the loadstone seems to point to the North, but yet has his
proper pole, and that in the earth, not in the heaven, (so that some have
maintained that it points only to the main land;) so it is with the State
hypocrite, howsoever he seems to respect Religion, it is evident to them who
look advisedly, to discern as it were polum magnetis, a bye respect of earthly
ends in all his proceedings.

It is reported of Phidias, that he did so cunningly enchace his own picture
into the shield of Minervah, that it could not be taken out, Plutat.
without the defacing of that sacred monument. So this hypocrite, knowing
Religion to be a sacred and stable thing, uses it as a spell, or as a noli me
tangere, to his own reputation. Thus the Pope has in his own conceit so
incorporated his own Grandeur into the faith of Christians, that no man can
touch his reputation, but he is pronounced Sacrilegious against Christ, against
Peter, and against the Church.

Contrarily; Differ.
the heavenly minded Statist makes Religion a stair to mount himself and others
to heaven that he may more fully enjoy God.

Heaven is his Harbor, and Religion is his Cynosure, by which he sails safely
through the boistrous storms, and rolling waves he meets with in the sea of
this world. He has his habitation on earth for a while, and is therefore
willing to serve the State wherein he is placed, in any warrantable way of
justice and truth, but even then he has his conversation in heaven, (...)
Phil. 3.20.
; and though it be well with him in this world, and this world be the better
for him, yet he is not a man of this world; not cosmopolites a Citizen of the
world, but, uranopolites, a Denizon of heaven Psalm. 17.14. Diog. Laert.
. He is of Anaxagoras his mind; Caelum mihi patria cujus cura summa est, heaven
is my country which takes up my chiefest care; nay this serves not his turn;
for unless he may have God into the bargain, heaven it self will not suffice
him; much less the whole earth or any thing in it, Whom have I in heaven but
thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire before thee Psalm. 73.25.
? This holy and wise resolution advances him, not only to a standing
happiness, but a growing greatness; Thy gentleness has made me great, says
David, Psalm. 18.35.19.11.
higher then the Politicians and Princes of the earth, for in keeping of Gods
Commandments there is great reward.

Thus while the common Statist makes use of Religion as a spade to dig deep,
and root himself further in the earth; the true Christian uses it as the
mantle of Elijah, to fill him more fully with all the fullness of God.

habit, and gesture.
IT is true, that every hypocrite is a Stage Player; but acts not the same
part. This Hypocrites part lies most in mimical countenances, guises and
gesticulations, by which he endeavors to proclaim himself Religious. And
althongh sometimes he seem to affect a carelessness of behavior, pretending to
content himself with the uprightness of his heart, (to which he is wholly a
stranger;) yet for the most part he takes more care of a gaudy sign at his
door, then to have good wine in the Cellar. For Deuteronomy. 32.32, 33.
his vine is the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; his grapes are
grapes of gall, and his clusters bitter; his wine is the poison of Dragons, and
the cruel venom of Aspes. And whereas some others will rather do service to
the Lord, than wear his livery; This hypocrite affects to wear his cloth and
badge in his outward guise, but not to do service. When he whom he calls
Father, bids him work in his vineyard Mat. 21.28, 29.30.
, his face and countenance says, I go Sir, but his heart says, I will not. He
places all his perfection in the outward garb and deportment. He is an ape in
a childs habit. He fasteth, but wherein does his Fast appear? in the hanging
down of the head like a bulrush Esaias 58.5.
, in a sad countenance Mat. 6.16.
, and disfiguring of the face, that he may appear unto men to fast. But as
those diseases are for the most part most ominous and most of all dreaded that
disfigure the patient, so is this sort of hypocrisy, which alters the shape of
a man into a changling or mongrel Christian.

Indeed there are times wherein iniquity like the harlot Prove. 7.13.
, steeleth her face, and puts on a brow of brass, wherein drunkenness,
swearing, and profaneness are more in fashion than common civility, and then
this hypocrite will pull off his vizar; then, Esaias 3.8, 9.
the trial of his countenance will quickly testify against him; he will
declare his sins as Sodom, and not hide them. But for the most part, as whores
in old time Genesis 38.14
, did put on vails, covering their shamelessness with a more then ordinary
semblance of shamefac'tnesse, and by that affected modesty were commonly
discovered and reputed to be immodest and light; so, while virtue has any
sway, Religion any force to keep men sober and grave, never an harlot in the
world shall be more disguised, nor more curiously pranked in a religious
dress, nor more cunningly set her countenance to allure, then this
smooth-boots in his looks, vesture and gesture, to seem honest, religious,
wise, grave, and what not, but what he is? He covers a foul heart under a fair
face; an ulcerous soul under neat clothes, a wanton heart under a modest habit,
and a world of spiritual wickedness under an affected gravity of carriage and
behavior: yet, as the absurd Actor (when he thinks to do best) commits a
solicisme with his hand; so this hypocrite, with his face. He is a large and a
curious buble, very smooth and shining without, but empty of all but wind
within; or like some vainglorious Italians that have their rooms of
entertainment richly hung and furnished, but little store of solid provision in
the Kitchen or pantry, or of money in the purse to buy it.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian has his greatest perfection within.

Whatever shines in his face is from his inward integrity of heart. Not that
all appears that is within, here is the hidden man of the heart, showing it
self most to him that searches it and has set up his throne there; but no
beauty appears in the face as a Christian, but what is from the spiritual life
within. He looks humbly, is attired modestly, does all things gravely and
soberly, follows things that are comely and of good report Phil. 4.8.
, and walks honestly as in the day Romans 13.13
, but all from a living principle within, that moves and acts him Romans 8.14.
. That outside comes not out of a box, as the Lamia's eyes; but out of the
bowels, as the spiders web. As in the state of innocence, the natural skin was,
of it self, clothing sufficient until sin brought in a necessity of apparel to
cover that nakedness which sin, not nature had made, when man being ashamed of
h^s own skin, by turning beast Psalm. 49.20.
, must be beholding to the skins of beasts to cover his shame; so is it in a
manner in the state of grace. Where grace has once entered the heart, there
needs no exterior counterfeit covering. Inward holiness gives outward
comeliness; grace in the soul shines in the face, and makes the countenance
lovely. As nature makes the skin, and after nourishes and repaireth it from
within; so grace makes the best beauty without, and cherishes it so, that it
never fades nor withers, but it recovers again and grows more amiable. This
makes a man a new creature, whose outward skin is a part of the man, not as
apparel that may be cast off: or, if it be apparel, it first appareleth the
inner man 1 Pet. 3.3, 4.
; then, the outward. It first sets him into Christ, and then helps him to put
on Christ; first within, then without. Clothes are shifted, and the fashion
altered; so are the outward semblances and behavior of the hypocrite; he will
be in the fashion, whatever it cost him; and off goes the old apparel, although
but lately put on, when a newer fashion is more in request. But the true
Christian being first made like unto Christ, continues ever after like
himself. He will never cast off those garments which are all glorious within,
nor his external garb that holds proportion with the inward clothing, let
others change fashion never so often. His very outward countenance and
complexion as a Christian, is the same with that grace which is within. How
leprous soever he was before, yet grace is to him what the waters of Jordan
were to Naaman, causing his flesh (that is his outward part of the Christian)
to come again unto him as the smooth flesh of a thriving child ^ King. 5.14.
. And as the pulse maintained and increased the beauty of Daniel and his
fellows Dan. 1.15.
, rendering them fairer and fatter then all the rest of the children which did
eat of the Kings meat, which would have defiled them; so does the Word and
Sacraments make and preserve the choicest beauty, the best complexion and
loveliest countenance in a Christian. He knows that men learn much by signs
and heroglyphicks; and that as in Oratory Pronunciation; so in Christianity,
example may challenge, and win the first, second and third place, as a special
means to instruct and quicken the beholders to piety. Therefore he is careful
even of his outside also; but first he makes the inside clean; as well
knowing that otherwise the outside will never be purified according to the
purification of the Sanctuary to be accepted of God, and that it will never
become him, or at least not hold long with him.

The hypocrite may for a while outshine him in the eyes of some men, who take
all for gold that glitters; yet as artificial things differ from natural, and
fictions of men from works of God, so does the hypocrite from him that partakes
of the divine nature, what show soever he make outwardly to the world. And as
Artificials, the nearer we come to them, and the further we look into them, the
less perfection is found in them; but natural, the more inward, the more
admirable. The image that had so much cost and curiosity bestowed upon it, was
at length neglected, because it wanted something within to make it act and
move, in which respect a living dog is better then a dead lion. But when we
look into any thing of Gods making, whether natural or supernatural, we cannot
but break out with admiration, as David, and say, I am fearfully and
wonderfully made Psalm. 139.14.
. His very outside is excellent, but his inside admirable.

Thus the hypocrite is fair afar off, he must have distance to grace him: the
Christian is most lovely at hand; and the nearer you come to him, and the more
exactly you search him, the more beautiful he will appear. The one has as it
were a good color, the other a good complexion. The one has his face well
painted, the other has his blood well purged and defecated: The one is as a
glorious purse, but no money within it: the other, as the leather bag that is
filled with silver and gold.

This hypocrite is what he is by imitation.

He strives to imitate whatever he vainly imagines to be commendable in
others; wherein, it is many times a sport to a curious observer, to see how
apish he is, especially in his behavior toward those whom he imitateth. If
Moses do wonders, he will show tricks so well as he can, although smitten with
boiles Exodus 9.11.
for his pains. But as Pharaohs Magitians striving to imitate Moses in all
things, really performed nothing, but counterfeited in all, so does this
hypocrite. Would his heart be first in the work he imitateth, his imitation
were commendable. Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ, 1 Cor. 11.1.
is an Apostolical precept; a Christian duty; but when it is no otherwise done,
than it is practiced by the man of sin 2 These. 2.3, etc
, with signs and lying wonders, and ^^^h all deceivablenesse of
unrighteousness; this makes the hypocrite an abhorring to the Lord, for which
he will one day find himself a son of perdition.

They say, Apes are taken by putting on childrens stockins and shoes, which
being on, they cannot climb, and so are surprised; so this hypocrite is
discovered and taken as one of no worth, by putting on fashions of others,
wherein he cannot climb to heaven, and which he is no better able to manage to
any spiritual advantage, then little David was to fight, in the Armor of Saul:
so that those outward gestures and deportments which are commendable in a
Christian, because springing from an inward principle of grace, are in the
hypocrite intolerable, because but the counterfeitings of a graceless heart.

And as the vanity of our travelers into foreign countries is become a
disease almost universal to be in the fashions of those people among whom they
travel; they must have France on their backs, Altero ad frontem sublato, altero
admentum depulso supercilio.
Spain in their face and countenance, Italy in their wrything brows and
gesticulations, Piso like, according to Tullies description; to the great
dishonor of our Nation to which it boads ruin: [For, as the Chaldean
Astrologers Curtius l. 3.
; when Darius changed the fashion of his scabbard from the Persian manner into
the mode of the Greeks, they prognosticated that the Persian Monarchy should be
translated to them, whose fashion he counterfeited; so we may justly fear a
scourge from those Nations whose fashions we follow, as God of old plagued his
people by those whose manners they took up, not only in the matter of idol
worship Isa. 2.6, 7, 8
; but in their Zeph. 1.8.
clothing with strange apparel, although Princes, and Kings children that were
found so doing.] So this hypocrite is a great follower of fashions of other men
in matters of Religion; being as inquisitive after every mode to gratify (as
he thinks) those Christians whose garb he counterfeiteth, as some London
Tailors are to enquire after the newest fashions of the French, or others, to
please their fantastic Customers, for their own advantage and gain, without
any care or consideration of the displeasure of God who has threatened, Nah.
3.13.
thy people in the midst of thee are women, the gates of thy land shall be
set wide open unto thine enemies, the fire shall devour thy bars; so is it
with our Ape. But, as it is both disgraceful and dangerous to lay aside manly
virtue and masculine solidity, and for women to put off matronly modesty and
maidenly bashfulnesse, for an exoticke fashion; so is it dishonorable and
damnable to put on the external fashion and habit of sober, grave and devout
Christians, without the inward substance and virtue, without which, all the
outward comportment is but as strange apparel to him that uses it.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian is content with, and constant in that carriage
and behavior which nature, religious education, and God has made his own.

He is not abhorrent from all imitation of others; as well knowing that, as in
rhetoric, and oratory, so in Religion, there is a commendable use of
imitation; he that has denounced so many woes against hypocrites, has yet
commanded all to learn of him Mat. 11.29.
, not only what to believe, but what to be, and do, and how to walk as he has
walked 1 John 2.6.
, that they may be followers of God as dear children Ephesians. 5.1.
. Hence it is that he can and will follow and imitate others wherein they
imitate Christ, and Phil. 3.17.
mark them which walk so, as he has the Apostles and other solid Christians
for an ensample; not in their haltings, but in their walkings, wherein they
make strait paths unto their feet Heb. 12.13
. He will not imitate David counterfeiting madness 1 Samuel 21.13.
; nor Peter Mat. 36.74
, in denying his Lord, much less in swearing and cursing to make out that
denial. As for his habit and attire, it shall be sober, grave, and suitable to
his rank and calling, therein propounding the best and gravest of his own rank
and condition for his pattern, to keep himself free from just censure of
fantastic levity, or affected gravity. In like manner the women also will
adorn themselves in modest apparel with shameface'tnesse and sobriety 1 Timothy
12.9
, and in behavior, as becomes holiness Tit. 2.3.
. And as for his gestures, he will have them grave, not affected; his own, if
natural and usual in the place where he lives. Natural gestures become well
enough, which being affected prove ridiculous; the cast of the eye, the bowing
of the head or body, when not done to deceive, or in an apish imitation of
strangers or other Nations to whom it is natural, are not to be slighted, or
censured. The Spanish gravity and slow pace in them is not unseemly, because
national; but in an English man, uncomely and odious. In a word, his gestures
shall be such as show devotion, not affectation; but whatever they be, they
shall never go without the heart. Hands or eyes shall never be lifted up to
heaven alone Lam. 3.41
; rather, the heart without them Psalm. 25.1.
. He had rather appear what he is, then be what such appear, because in him
those gesticulations are absurd, how natural soever to them. He will in all
things walk exactly Ephesians 5.15
, not exotickly; gravely, but not affectedly.

Thus this hypocrite will be every man's ape, but no man's follower; the
Christian is every good man's follower but no man's ape. The one counterfeits in
outward formality, the other really imitateth without counterfeiting.

The hypocrite puts a face of wisdom upon a foolish heart.

He first is wise in his own eyes Prove. 26.12
; although his foolish heart depart not from evil; Then he labors to make
others of the same opinion, although there be more hope of a fool that sees his
folly, then of him. His tongue boasts of wisdom, and his great ambition is
to seem wiser then he is. He talks much of the price in his hand to get
wisdom, but he has no heart unto it Prove. 17.16
. Yea, this fool despises that wisdom Prove. 1.7
which he so much courteth, and pretends to be married unto. This man is a
fool, yet, in his own conceit, he is wiser then seven men that can render a
reason Prove. 26.16.
. His show of wisdom is showed most, either in advancing himself with a
bragging tongue, and undervaluing others with a foolish heart. He entertaineth
with a scornful hum, what is said by others which himself understands not, that
he may seem wiser then they whom others not without just cause applaud: whereas
it is the highest degree of folly to make show of that wisdom which he knows
he has not. The way of this fool is right in his own eyes Prove. 12.15
, but he never was so wise, as to hearken unto counsel; or else he seems very
wise in trifles, with neglect of things of greater concernment. It is the
humor of many that ambitiously affect to be accounted wise, with great
solemnity to do nothing; or to make great preparation, and to raise high
expectation of bringing forth some great matter, when all these seeming
mountains of wisdom they are in travail with, comes to the birth, it proves
but a ridiculous mouse; so that this hypocrite is not unlike to Caligula, who
with banners displayed, and sound of trumpets, caused his Army to gather
cockleshels. He is a Mountebank in wisdom, such as Hanno the Carthaginian
Admiral, wise in aspect, and formal in portraiture, and exceeding skillful in
the Art of seeming Reverend.

On the contrary, the Christian is a true Philosopher. Differ.


He is one that not only affects the name, but loves the substance of true
wisdom. He is wise in heart Prove. 16.21.
, therefore he only deserves to be called Prudent. And while the mouth of a
fool pretends to wisdom, which never was in his heart: the Christians heart
teaches his mouth Prove. 16.23
. And so his tongue uses knowledge aright Prove. 15.2
. He would not that any show of what he has not, should hinder the attaining
of what he might have. Wherefore he rather complains of ignorance that he might
be instructed. [ I Prove. 30.2, 3
have not the understanding of a man, I neither learned wisdom, nor have the
knowledge of the holy,] than to be vainly admired even for what he has. What
he has, he modestly puts on, for Prove 17.14
wisdom is before him that has understanding; and that both for his own just
ornament, for Eccles. 8.1
a man's wisdom makes his face to shine; and for the instruction of others,
for the lips of the wise disperse knowledge Prove. 15.7.
, to guide them to the same happiness to which himself looks.

Thus the hypocrite seems wiser then he is, the Christian is wiser then he
seems; the one basely beggeth an esteem for wisdom which he has not, the other
modestly puts from him the praise of what he has, and chooses rather to hang
out but a small part of that which is in him, than to make show of more.

This hypocrite hides a crafty head under a show of simplicity.

His plain habit is but a vail to cover his fraud and cunning. He will
sometimes counterfeit ignorance, that he may more craftily overreach, and use
plainness of speech, that his wiles may be less discerned. He will seem
honest that he may deceive; he is like the wily Gibeonites, Josh. 9.
in old shoes and clouted, and in old garments to circumvent, not only common
Israelites, but Joshuah himself; like Saul 1 Samuel 28.8
, in a disguise to delude the witch at Endor; or, the wife of Jeroboam, 1 King.
14.2.
to keep her self unknown from Ahijah; or like false prophets Mat. 7.15.
, who being wolves, come to us in sheeps clothing. This, the Popish Priests
and Regulars have verified beyond all example, who under their hair-cloth and
freeze, bare feet, and shaven crowns, have subdued Kings and Kingdoms; not
unto Christ, but to their own avarice and ambition. Yet, too many among our
selves write too much after their copy, for lower ends; that, as the russet
coat often deceives under that show of simplicity, those of better education;
so this hypocrite, under a guise of simplicity, deceives unsuspected; and, as
the proverb says, laughs in his sleeve at those who pretending to more ocular
sharpness, are fooled by him.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian is a Nathaniel in whom is no guile.

He is as Jacob, Genesis 25 27
a plain man, dwelling in tents. He is what he shows; his dealing is as
downright as his speech and behavior. You shall know his heart by his tongue;
at least, his tongue shall not belie his heart. If he have any policy, it is
defensive to save himself, as David 1 Samuel 21.13.
, that scrabled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon
his beard, to avoid ruin by their hands, to whom he was now forced to fly for
shelter from the malice of Saul; or, as Paul, that set the Pharisees and
Sadduces by the ears, Acts 23.6.
to free himself from the fury of both, divided, which would have destroyed
him, if they had continued united. In a word, his habit is according to his
estate; and his tongue agreeable to his mind. If he seem to deny what is in
him, it is not to deceive, but to learn. If he use plainness of speech, it is
but the dictates of a plainer heart. He had rather be circumvented then
deceive, and to be overreached himself, then to go beyond others. If his word
be passed, it is his bond, or the accepting of a Bill of exchange, which his
heart and hand will make good whatever it cost him.

Thus the hypocrite by a show of simplicity circumventeth by craft; the
Christian, 2 Cor. 12.
in sincerity and godly simplicity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace
God maintains his plainness, as most abhorrent from deceit. The one is a true
Israelite in whom is no guile, the other a Gibeonite, that minds nothing more.

This Hypocrite puts a fair face upon a foul heart.

He harbors a profane heart under a demure countenance; much of his Religion
lies in forms, without the power of godliness; in his habit, rather then his
heart, and seldom lasts so long as to get into his heart, but vanishes into
smoke as a vapor that makes show of mounting to heaven, but dissolves by the
way. He is an Apothecaries shop, wherein all the pots and glasses are curiously
painted, or richly gilded, but have nothing within but dust, or trash. His
face shines, but his breath stinketh through rotten lungs. Jezabels paint, and
Naboths blood, do ill agree, yet meet in the same party; the one in the the
face, the other in the heart; and both in this hypocrite: His face shines
through the oil he has borrowed; his heart is black and rotten through want
of the wine of grace to cheer and revive it. If Ananias and Saphira Act. 5 1,
2, etc.
, can but first delude those that received part of the price instead of all,
they will not fail to bear down Peter himself with a good face, that they have
sold their land, but for so much and no more. He looks not at God who is
invisible, and therefore thinks of no more then what is obvious to the eye. If
he affect gravity, he will but purchase the vizard of a Spanish face, and write
upon it his own name, and his buisinesse is done. If he would be thought wise,
it is but drawing his picture by that of Solon, Plato or Lycurgus, and he has
enough. If his heart be set upon uncleanness, let him put on Herod's face and
reverence the Baptist, and this will suffice him, till he be compelled to show
his heart by taking off his head. The Romanists allow uncleanness, so it be
cleanly covered; and this hypocrite, if he can but have the time to wipe his
mouth Prove. 30.20
he will tell you confidently, he has not sinned.

Thus our hypocrite is (as Alexander said of Antipater, commended for his
plainness in apparel) all plain without, but all purple within.

Contrarily; the Christians chief beauty of his face, Differ.
is from his heart within.

His Religion begins in his heart, he has not only a form, but real piety. The
new creature, Christ in his image is formed in him; Gal. 4.19
he conveyeth sobriety from his heart to his countenance: And while others
vaunt of their outward cleanness his prayer is, Psalm. 51.10
Create in me a clean heart O God. He is loath the show of what he is not,
should bring into question the truth of what he is and has; he neglects not,
but studies all outward behavior and comeliness that may bring honor to his
profession; but when he is most exact in his outward garb, it is not with a
purpose to deceive, or of men to seek glory; but to approve himself to God and
men by showing forth outwardly some part of the treasure that is in the heart;
and that all his conversation may only be such as becomes the Gospel of
Christ Phil. 1.27
.

Thus the hypocrite is as the Pharisees Tomb, very gay without, but foul
within; the true Christian, as the Kings daughter, whose clothing is of
worught gold, and her self all glorious within Psalm. 45.13
. The one has a smoothed face, and a withered heart; the other a true natural
beauty from a sound, healthful and well tempered constitution within. The
Hypocrite maintains a sign without an house; the Christian pulls down the
sign that the house may stand; the one puts on a face of Religion to bind
others to believe him, the other takes in the power of godliness to bind
himself from deceiving.

This Hypocrite puts a case of gravity upon a light heart.

Understand this, where gravity is in fashion, not where men profess levity
and carelessenesse as a choice piece of their education and profession, (as in
these times our young gallants count it their honor to glory in their shame,
and to be ashamed of nothing so much as of their true glory Jer. 9.24
, till their glory be ashamed Luke 9.26
of them:) But when gravity is in request, you shall soon find our hypocrite
in that case of affected gravity which ever nourishes levity under her skirts.
There is a kind of light gravity held forth by some old Bachelours, who while
they glory in their continency and single life, discover much wantonness and
lightness, if not of their bodies, yet in their discourse and behavior. So
there is always something green and sower in our hypocrites carriage able to
set the teeth of a sober man on edge, even when his almond gravity seems to
flourish Eccles. 12.5.
; I mean, a set gravity, (like that of Socrates never seen to change
countenance on any occasion,) which must needs be affected, and much straiten
that lightness and greenness of lusts that is pent in, and will too often
break out ere he be aware; for, whatsoever is forced, will not be perpetual.
Things unnatural are troublesome, and cannot long be endured. It is too much to
be always on the tenters. The sinews of the mind no more than those of the
body, can abide a perpetual distention. Affectation of gravity is like a
straight shoe, that while it gives shape to the foot, wrings it, and therefore
must either be shortly left off, or widened, that the shoe may come to the
foot, not the foot to the shoe. Some put on a countenance for their better
grace when they go abroad; which they put off when they return home for their
greater ease; so, our hypocrite; yea, and at times too, while he is abroad upon
the stage of dissimulation, where it happens to him as to the Apes that acted
Damon and Pythias; a few nuts thrown betwixt them, put them quite out of their
parts; for the bait or object of this hypocrites special sin makes him forget
his counterfeit acting, and to fall to that wickedness which is to him as nuts
to an Ape. The beard makes not a Philosopher, nor the hood a Monk; yet this
hypocrite has nothing else of a grave man, but his countenance, gesture,
apparel and gate, like those, of whom it is said, Zech. 13.4.
they wore a rough garment to deceive. His countenance promises stayednesse
and solidity, but his heart is as fleeting as the weathercock. He is like a
child in black, or an Ape in mourning. Popish Regulars excel in this Craft.
Their order and rule speak them grave; but their heart and life proclaim them
wanton. Again, some seem grave, but not out of true gravity, but because
stupid, ruthlesse, and senseless, without affections or bowels; or, because they
are by nature slow, like the Ass that cannot mend his pace, or like a wooden
horse that cannot go out of the way; yea, sometimes his gravity is as
mischievous as that of Caesar, who alone came sober to the Senate, to overthrow
the Commonwealth.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christians habit is the true badge of a grave heart.

He knows there is good use of gravity even in outward carriage, and that it is
pity it should be so much out of fashion. By a sad countenance the heart is
made better Eccles. 7.3.
It is as the north-winde to drive away flattery and sycophancy. For a grave
and just Governor chaseth away all evil with his eyes Prove. 20, 8.
. Wherefore he maintains even a face and form of gravity, not as an
hypocrite, to deceive; but as Job Job 29.24.
, who even in smiling maintained an awful respect to hold up the reverence due
to justice. Gravity and integrity meet in the Christian that he may not
deceive, but not in the hypocrite whose trade it is to delude. The Christian
makes gravity his study as well as his profession; not to destroy affections;
which were to dam up the fountain, and to raze the foundation of virtue, but
to command and govern them. A man without affections is a wooden horse that
cannot go out of the way; but a Christian having his affections gravely
governed is the only man that goes right and is undefiled in the way. He is
unmovable from a good course, although not immovable in it! He may vary his
Tropicks as necessity, or prudence may move him, but he never goes out of the
eclyptick. If his passions do sometimes draw him aside, his prudence and
gravity are the legs that carry him into his way again. And so he makes a wild
horse serviceable, which a wooden one will never be.

Thus the hypocrite cousens by his gravity; the Christian is grave that he may
not abuse himself to the damage of others. The one affects gravity for a show;
the other loves it for it self. The one is grave when he seems most merry; the
other shows lightness in his greatest gravity.

This Hypocrite hides a proud heart under the mask of humility.

This is the crouching hypocrite that lurketh like a lion in his Den Psalm.
10.9, 10, etc.
. His word is humility, his acting is pride; and never so proud as when he most
humbles himself; that the poor may fall by his might. The Pope for advantage
will proclaim himself servus servorum, your slaves slave; yet even then
exalts himself above all that is called God 2 These. 2.4.
. And he that is so seemingly humble as to offer a chain to the Devil, is yet
so proud as to take merit from Christ. As the thrifty dissembler is lavish in
courtesy that he may spare his purse; so this hypocrite gives men the way or
the cap, because done without cost, and conducing to his own vainglory; this
is a kind of imperious humility, that, by unprofitable complements pleasing to
the meaner sort, renders himself the higher, and them more obsequious. Thus
Absalom with his lowest humility, drew many an honest man unawares into the
fellowship of his highest Treasons. Counterfeit humility lifts up higher, and
in the end casts down lower then others sins; for he that exalts himself by
seeming abasement, shall be sure in the end to be abased below the lowest. Who
so high, who so low, as Lucifer? There is also an impious humility, when men
out of pretense of being no wiser then their Fathers, no better then their
neighbors, nor more religious then the Prince, take upon them to lift up
themselves against God and his truth.

Thus many persecutors are mad against the truth, upon no other account, but
that their Fathers never owned it, but have always been of another Religion.

On the contrary, Differ.
the Christian endeavors to make his heart level with his eye.

His heart is not haughty, nor his eyes lofty Psalm. 231.1
. If any difference be; he is more humble within then without, and his heart is
more lowly of the too. He does not cauponari-humilitatem, make Merchandise of
his humility, much less hunt after the glory of a show of what he has not in
truth. He humbles himself by esteeming others better then himself Phil. 2.3.
, but not to draw them into his net Psalm. 10.9.
. He gives all men their dues, honor to whom honor Romans 13.7:
; but, in Christian ingenuity, he prefers God, Truth, and conscience before
all men. These he labors especially to save harmless, and to hold up their
honor with the neglect of his own, who ever be offended; Hence of many he is
accounted proud. But he had rather himself be a loser in his credit then in his
conscience, or that God or his truth should lose by him; yea, that all men
should lose rather than God should be endamaged.

Thus the Hypocrite is as Haman doing honor to Mordecay with a proud heart; he
leads his horse when he would cut his throat Ester 6.11.
; the Christian, as the disciple of Christ, washing the feet John 13.5
, of the Saints in imitation of his true humility. The one counterfeiteth, the
other acts it.

This Hypocrite covers a base hoart under a lofty look.

There is a generation; O! how lofty are their eyes, and their eyelids are
lifted up Prove. 30.13.
! He pretends to magnanimity and Christian fortitude beyond others, and danceth
proudly upon his threshold Zeph. 1.9.
, yet has in him a dunghill mind, a cowards spirit, and is but as a slave in
Parliament-robes. Every proud man is base, and every wicked man is proud, but
none like the hypocrite who is base all over. Some base humor of
covetousness, ambition, uncleanness or the like is his Genius, his familiar,
causing his heart to drudge basely after these Masters, and making him a coward
in the cause of God, which when it breaks out and appears, none so contemptible
in the esteem of others, as he that was most lofty in his own looks before
others, that he might hide that baseness which indeed is in him.

Contrariwise, The true Christian is highest in his resolution, Differ.
when furthest from vaunting.

Peter may boast of more then John Mat. 26.33.
and may cut off an ear of him that came to apprehend his Master. Yet he that
said less, performed more, altoough known to the High Priest John. 18.15.
. He uses this world as one that lives upon God. He owns God whoever denies
him, whatever it cost him. If he cannot dispute against error, he can die for
the truth; if he cannnot say so much as others, he will do the more. If his
outward man be persecuted, his heart is above all persecutors; he can despise
their torments even while he suffers them; 2 Cor. 4.16 Romans 8.37, etc.
and rejoice in tribulation when it is at the sharpest and highest.

Thus the hypocrite is like Goliath threatening David to give his flesh to the
fowls of the air; the Christian, as David, makes not so great a show, yet
with a stone and a sling gives the Philistines flesh to the wild beasts of the
field. The one vaunteth, as Lameck before his wives; the other slayes the Lion
and the Bear, and (till after it be done) makes no words of it.

This Hypocrite covers malice and mischief under the cloak of courtesy.

He that hates, dissembleth with his lips, and lays up deceit within him.
When he speaks fair, believe him not; for there are seven abominations in
his heart Prove. 26.24, 25.
. Eat, says he, but his heart is not with thee Prove. 23.7.
. The words of his mouth are smoother then butter, but war is in heart;
softer then oil, yet are they drawn swords Psalm. 55.21.
. Thus Caine Genesis 4.8.
talked familiarly and courteously with his brother, to till him into the
field, that there he might rise up and kill him. Esaus tears for a blessing was
with an heart to slay Jacob Genesis 27.41
. The communication of Simeon and Levi, with Shechem and Hamor his father,
although it was fair, yet very deceitful Genesis 34.13.
, that they might be revenged upon all the Shechemites. Of the same nature were
Joabs embracement of Abner, Ishmaels tears Jer. 41.6.
, the fasting of hypocrites, for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist
of wickedness Esaias 58.4.
; the Pharisees long prayers to devour widows houses Mat. 23.14
. This hypocrite will laugh in your face, and cut your throat; and the more
courtesy, the more craft. A point too well known and too much practiced,
although bred elsewhere, and brought over-sea, by those that solemnly make
leagues, and then maintain, no faith is to be kept with Heretics, to corrupt
ours who need no Tutors in a course of sin.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christian will not suffer his face to belly his heart, nor
to bear false witness to it.

If, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, the Christian will
not suffer his mouth to speak what is not in his heart, but speaks the truth
in his heart Psalm 15.2.
. He keeps his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile Psalm. 34.13.
. If it be fit he should smile, he holds it needful to love; he dares not fawn
where he may not favor, nor cover hatred with deceit. And albeit he has too
often cause to dislike many, he can dissemble with none: if he love not, he
flatters not; yet is he loving to others so far as he may, either for being
good, or that he might make them so: and, because he loves, he deals
plainly, though the more he love, the less he be loved. But where he
pretends love, you may be sure he loves; for his love is without
dissimulation. Where he is affable, he is real.

Thus the Hypocrite puts on a countenance of popularity, mentientis astu, as
Austin speaks, craftily belying his heart, that he may depopulate in a
disguise: the Christian is truly affable, compatientis affectu, with
affectionate compassion, as the same Father adds. The one is courteous that he
may be hid, the other speaks that he may be seen; and is as far from
mischief, as the other from truth.

CHAP. IX. The Heretical Hypocrite Is he that professing himself a Teacher of
Truth, Defin.
obtrudeth his own lies as the Truths of God, and persisteth therein.
IN his profession he is a great pretender to truth, to the truths of God, and
to piety; transforming himself into an Apostle. 2 Cor. 11.13.
(that is, a messenger, or Minister) of Christ: but, in truth and indeed, is a
false Apostle, a deceitful worker. He is Satan's Minister, transformed (in
outward show) into a Minister of righteousness. verse 15.
a wolf, in sheeps clothing: a fox, Ezekiel. 13.4.
in a lambs skin. He must hold out a Color of truth and piety, that by these
he may deceive by untruths with more subtilty, and efficacy. Every sinner is
deceived by Satan; but this man, willingly, that he may deceive others more
cunningly. He is content to be deceived; he would be deceived to choose, that
he might be artifex mentiendi, his crafts-master in lying, under a Color and
show of truth, whereby he lies in wait to deceive. Ephesians. 4.14.
He speaks lies in hypocrisy. 1 Timothy 4.1.
not venting them as lies, but as truths; some truths he must hold, or all
would abhor him; but, among those truths he foisteth and thrusts in some
counterfeit coin, as current money, brass, gilded over with some silver, to
give it tincture and esteem; but, with a purpose to cosen those on whom he
obtrudes it; He pretends to be a zealous disciple of Christ, but is in truth
the Scholar of the Serpent; learning all his arts and methods. Other hypocrites
are the Devils children; but this hypocrite, his first borne; If not in time,
yet in wiles, as Polycarp said of Marcion: Novi te primogenitum esse Satanae.
Eusebius. lib. 4. cap 14.
toto caelo, toto genere hypocrita; An hypocrite all over, An hypocrite in
grain.

To express this deceitfulness more fully, the Apostle Ephesians. 4.14.
uses an heap of words which may seem tautologies; but do indeed intimate that
he wanted words to decipher this wretch to the full. The doctrines he teaches,
they are but winds of doctrines; a show, without substance; but, in substance
what are they? the sleights of men, and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
wait to deceive. They are cheating gamesters, that slurre a die, or play with
false dice; And they do it so cunningly, that it cannot be discerned until it
be felt: ( in vain is the snare laid in the sight of any bird) nor is this done
by accident, but out of set-purpose and design; not openly professed, but by
secret lying in wait; not to do good to the souls of men, but merely to
deceive; And, if the heretic, can make a Proselite, and draw away disciples
after him, (although he make them twofold more the children of hell then they
were before;) he has an answer ready for such as complain of the cheat; what
is that to us; look ye to that, when his own turn is served.

But as in the case of common lying, not every one that utters a falsehood is
a liar, so here; not every one that utters a lie for truth, is an heretical
hypocrite: but he that speaks lies in hypocrisy, in the great truths of God,
and wilfully persisteth therein, after admonition, and clear confutation. Tit.
3.10.
It is not error simply, but obstinacy in it that denominates an heretic. It
is one thing to err, another to be guilty of heresy; The very form of
heresy lies in two things; First, in a willing, witting, inventing, choosing,
or espousing of some false opinion and doctrine, and holding it forth to others
as the truth of God, and taking pleasure so to do. Danaeus Isa. par. 4. c. 38.
Secondly, in maintaining and persisting therein against clear evidences of
truth.

There are heretici, and haereticati, as the old Chancellor of Paris John
Gerson.
was wont to phrase it; Heretics that bring in, and others that are
hereticated with damnable doctrines; 2 Peter 2.1.
that is gangrend, or poisoned with heretical opinions; they willingly and
wilfully accept and embrace what others have obtruded upon them, or their
ancestors, 2 Timothy 2.17.
and will not depart from them. They will be of their fathers Religion be it
what it will: Acts 5.34.
they will rather err with Gamaliel, then embrace truth with Paul, if branded
with the Stigma of heresy. Acts 24 14.


Now, an Heretic is then an heretical hypocrite, when he does not so much
openly profess heresy, as by secret and cunning sleights winds in his lies,
quasi aliud agens, as intending nothing less; like the serpent that winds in
his head ere he be discerned, and then draws in his whole body after, ere he
can be withstood and avoided. This false-teacher privily brings in damnable
heresies, and with fained (pargetted playstered) words (...).
makes merchandise of weak Christians, 2 Pet. 2, 3. v. 14
beguiling unstable souls. Romans 16.18.
He has a method and Art by himself, whereby he, under a show of the
simplicity of the Gospel, with good words and fair speeches, deceives the
hearts of the simple. Sometimes he prevails further, by signs and lying
wonders 2 These. 2.9.
also, but always, with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. ver. 10.
He pretends great show of righteousness, that he may deceive more slily with
unrighteousness in a disguise, as delighting, Cameron Myroth Evang.
thus to sport himself with his own deceivings. 2 Pet. 2.13.
He is the snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of his
God. Hos. 9.8.
Differ.


On the Contrary, the ingenuous disciple of Christ embraces the truth in her
native purity, and simplicity, for the truths sake.

As a new born babe he receives the sincere (or uncorrupted) milk of the Word.
1 Pet. 2.2.
He abhorres all disguises, and adulteratings. He 2 Cor. 4.2.
renounceth the hidden works of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness 'nor
handling the Word of God deceitfully. He does not 2 Cor. 2.17.
Cauponari, (...), a^ corrumpendo vino, atque infuscando, ut Caupones solent.
Jun.
play the huckster, mingling bad wares with good; or, the Vintner, putting
water or other base liquor into wine; corrupt the Word of God, but as of
sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speaks he in Christ. He
receives the truth in the love of it, that he may be saved. 2 These. 2.10.
and is better pleased that she appear in her naked Simplicity, then in the
disguise of an harlot, the enticing words of man's wisdom. He is not for
alchymy, but for silver; not for artifices, but for downright truth, in
demonstration of the Spirit, and of power. 1 Cor. 2.4. Errare possum haereticus
esse nolo. Hieron.
His desire and prayer is, to be led into all truth If through ignorance, or
inadvertency he happen to err, he will not persist in error. * If the
greatness of any man's name sway with him, or carry him, as it did Barnabas
Gal. 2.13.
into any dissimulation, he will readily disclaim it so soon as any Paul shall
discover it to him. If he be as mighty in the Scriptures as Apollos, Act. 18.34.
yet if in any thing he be ignorant, he will be content to learn the way of
God more perfectly, not only from Aquila, but even from Priscilla ver. 26.
too. He looks upon error as a deformed monster, how curiously soever
dressed; and upon truth, as the choysest beauty, how homely soever apparelled.
Virgin-truth in rags is more welcome to him, then the strumpet of error in her
richest attire. He hates the leaven of the Pharisees, Mat. 16.6,
how toothsome soever the bread made of it may seem to be, and delights in the
unleveaned bread of sincerity and truth, how unsavory soever it be to a corrupt
palate. He abhors to deceive in any thing, but most of all in the things of
God. His teaching of others is not of deceit, or of uncleanesse, or of guile. 1
These. 2.3.
neither uses he at any time flattering words, nor a cloak of covetousness,
ver. 5.
nor of men seeks he glory. He is well content that God alone should speak
with absolute authority, and man's wisdom be silent in conscience of humane
infirmity; If the truth he maintains be pronounced a lie, he is well content
to bear it, if the truth of God may thereby abound to his glory. Romans 3.7.


Thus the heretical hypocrite is an Impostor even in his greatest appearings
for truth, the true Christian is sincere at heart in his greatest aberrations
from truth; The one abuses the truth, the other adornes it. The one sels it,
the other buys it; The one makes use of it to deceive, the other against
deceit; The one, to destroy others whom he pretends to save, the other, to save
both himself and others that otherwise would be destroyed.

that he may set Gods stamp of truth upon his own lie, sets the brand of a lie
upon the truth of God.

In opposing the truths of God, he gives God the lie Romans 3.7.
in obtruding his own fancies, he tells a lie for God, making the lie of man to
be the truth of God; He is like the foolish Prophets that first see vanity and
lies, and then father all upon God, saying, the Lord says it, albeit he has
not spoken. Ez k 13.8.
and that it may appear that this Prophet is a fool, and this spiritual man
mad, Hos. 9 7.
he sticks not to make God a liar, by giving the lie to the truths of God that
contradict his own lies. If Gods truth and his fancies cannot stand together;
the truth is the liar, not he. Either the Word is not the rule or, not, unless
interpreted by the Church, says the Romanist: or by the spirit, that is his
own spirit, says the Euthusiast. If a Perfectist be told he is a sinner, he
says, and stands stoutly to it, that he has not sinned, and so makes God a 1
John 1.10.
liar; Thus the new, as well as the old Arrian, rather then acknowledge the
divinity of Christ, will not believe in him as the true God and eternal life. 1
John 5.20.
and so he makes God a liar, because he believes not the record that God gave
of his son. ver. 10.


And indeed it cannot be otherwise. For, what communion has light with
darkness? what agreement can there be between error and truth? Will not errors
endeavor as Pharaohs lean kine to devour the fat? Not that error shall
always prevail against truth: for however error, like Dagon, be by
Philistines, set up by the Ark, yet this Dagon shall fall before the Ark; 1 Samuel 5.4.
his head and hands, his subtilty and his power, shall both fail him, albeit
some stump of him remain, for the trial and ruin of others, in after ages,
for their unsoundnesse and hypocrisy. But, until God appear in the defense
and rescue of his truth, as Abraham, in the rescuing of his Nephew Lot, Error
that has the impudence, as well as the enticing qualities of an harlot, will
outface, not only truth, but even the God of truth; and in this respect, will
set his mouth against heaven, and his tongue shall walk through the earth.
Psalm. 73.9.
Thus, the Pharisees, that could not stand before the truths preached by
Christ, nor withold the people from hearing of him, could not hold from
blaspheming; He has a Devil and is mad; why hear ye him? Joh. 10.20
No man can hold up the credit of his own errors, but he will disparage Gods
truth that condemns them. He that loves darkness, must needs hate the light.

Contrarily, the true Christians motto is, Let God be true, and every man a
liar. Romans 3.4.


He will never reply against God, nor decry that for an error, Romans 9.20
which God speaks in his Word, how cross and contrary so ever to reason, and
the doctrines of men. The clay will never rise up against the Potter, nor the
thing formed against him that formed it. When he cannot understand, or fathom
it, he will with Mary, Luke 1^ ^8.
believe it, and submit unto it. On the other side, he will never receive that
for a truth, which the Word of God condemns for an error, or will not warrant
to be a truth. He remembers that charg, 1 John 44.
believe not every spirit, and therefore will try, not only the spirits, but
all things, and hold fast that which is good, 1 These. 5.21
Nay, he cares not how low himself be laid so God may be exalted. He will never
account it a shame, but esteem it his honor, to recant and renounce any error
that he has never so confidently maintained, that the truth of God may be
advanced, and more abound to his glory. Whatsoever Paul once thought; Act. 26.9.
that he ought to do many things against the Name of Jesus Christ; yet, so soon
as it pleased God to call him by his grace, and to reveal his son to him,
immediately he conferred not with flesh and blood, Gal. 1.15.16.
that would account it a disgrace now to renounce what he had before so
furiously and publicly propugned, namely the doctrine of the Pharisees, and
traditions of his Fathers: but he falls to the work of Christ, and (whether the
Disciples would own him or not) straight way preached Christ in the Synagogues,
Act 9.120.
and that faith which he once destroyed. Gal. 1.23.
As heresy makes men proud, 1 Timothy 6.3.4.
and clamarous; so true conversion makes humble, 1 Cor. 1^.9.
and self-denying, studious of truth, 2 Timothy 2.15.
and meek in instructing those that oppose it. v 24 25. er.


Thus, this hypocrite is like Antichrist 2 These. 2.4.
for ambition, opposing and exalting himself, and his fancies above God and all
the truths of God; the true Christian, like Paul, will part not only with his
errors and honor, but with his life also, so Christ and his truth may be set
upon the throne, and vain man abased. Romans 3.4.
The one like Simon Magus, Act. 8.9.
being drunken with the pride of his own wit and opinions; gives out that he
is some great one: The other abaseth himself as Peter, Luke 5.8.
O Lord, depart from me, for I am a sinful man: not as not needing him; but, as
worthy of him.

This Hypocrite disguiseth and deformeth truth, that he may with less envy
disgrace

No reasonable man can endure that truth should be opposed under her own name,
she must therefore be miscalled first, that she may after be misused. The
Pharisees (and Jews, seduced by them) called the faith of Christ, by the
odious name of heresy, Act, 24.14*
that they might with more security and credit, persecute it and all that
profess it. As the Popes dealt by tithes, first profaneing, and then
impropriating them; and, by our godly Ministers first degrading them as
heretics, and then burning them; and, by Princes themselves, first
excommunicating, and then deposing them, and exposing them to the knife or
sword; so do these hypocrites deal with truth that they have a mind to be rid
of: First, they put her into the habit and guise of heresy, and then make it a
matter of conscience to rise up against her. As Grandees, conspiring against a
good man that stands in their way; first they blast, and then break him; so
these hypocrites, not liking the sound Doctrine of Gods absolute Decree, first
accuse it of making God the Author of sin, and then explode it as a sinful
and blasphemous opinion. And so, as Jehoshaphat 1 King. 22.23.
was once in danger (unawares to the Aramites) to be slain instead of the King
of Israel, so truth is often exposed to great hazards, even from such as owe
her no ill will, merely upon mistakes arising from this device of Impostors.
Thus, as in former ages, the Emperors were persecuted by Popes upon the
quarrel of Investitures; but, under the names of Symony; so in later times, the
same persecutors have persued Protestants with fire and faggot; but, under the
brand of Lollards, Lutherans, Hugenots and the like: And Bishops have
persecuted godly men; but, under the names of Puritans, and Schimaticks. So
Papists have blasted the Evangelical doctrines of perseverance, and assurance,
under the titles of Presumption, faithless, persuasion, the faith of Devils,
and not of Apostles. Rhem in 1 Cor. 9.
Thus, Arminians (the true spawn of Pelagius) have branded the Doctrines of
absolute Decrees, under the odious name of stoical fatality, etc.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Disciple of truth uses his eyes before his tongue, and
presents truth as lovely as he can, that it may be embraced.

He makes use of his wisdom, first to discern of things that differ Phil.
1.10.
: and then, of weapons of war, 2 Cor. 10.4.5.
as the cause requires. As he receives no truths upon trust, so he refuses
not any, till he has first laid them to the rule, and put them to the touch.
He fears not to own truth, although infamously branded with the name of
heresy, but even in that very Act. 24.14.
way will he worship the God of his Fathers, believing all things that are
written in the Holy Scriptures. And when he sees truths opposed by evil men
under the name of errors, he will be rather apt to judge more favorably of
them, than thereupon to oppose them; and, to conclude as he that observing the
Christian Religion to be so furiously persecuted by bloody Nero, that must
needs be good which Nero persecuteth: So that must needs be true which profane
Atheistical men under the name of Sect, Heresy, or Schism so much impugn
and oppose.

Thus the Hypocrite is as the false-hearted spies Number. 13.27.28.
that brought an evil report upon Canaan, to dishearten the people from looking
any further after it: The Disciple of truth is as ver. 30.
Caleb, stilling the people, and encouraging them to go up at once and possess
it. The one is as Ziba 2 Samuel 16.3.
slandering Mephibosheth to the King, Cap. 19.27.
the other is as Jonathan, 1 Samuel 20.32.
taking off the unjust aspersions cast upon David and maintaining his innocence
to his greatest enemy.

This Hypocrite affronts not truth directly, but sets up some companion with
her, that may at length justle her out of her place, and bring in another
Gospel.

He pretends friendship to truth, by providing her an humble companion; but his
meaning is to make that humble friend a proud competitor, to procure the ruin
of truth by design, which he cannot effect by force. He has a good mind to
follow Ahitophels counsel, 2 Samuel 17.1.2.
by persuing and destroying David at once; but knowing the strength of truth
that it is as David 2 Samuel 17 10
who was a mighty man, and that they which be with it are valiant, and himself
a coward, he resolves rather to use this Stratagem. For well he apprehends,
that if once an inferior may be Cheek-mate with his superior, he will soon
give, or cry Cheque-mate: If that proud Cardinal once be suffered to write My
King and I, it will not be long ere he transpose it into I and my King. If any
attendant upon truth once come to sit down with her upon the same Couch,
although at some distance, it will quickly become her equal, yea perk above
her. This policy the Ministers of Satan used in the first plantation of the
Gospel If men that were Jews would needs embrace Christ in stead of Moses,
they persuaded them yet to retain circumcision and other ceremonies of the
Law. Act. 15.1.
If the Gentiles were brought into the Christian Church, there wanted not some,
who would needs introduce Heathen Philosophy. Col. 2.8.
And finally (when time gave color to prescribe) Ecclesiastical customs and
traditions. Thus, he endeavors to bring in another, or another manner of
Christ, another Mediator, another Faith, another Salvation. For well he
knows, that if once circumcision be suffered to keep company with the Gospel,
Christ shall profit us nothing. Gal. 5.2.
Let but works and grace be joined together in man's election, and grace will be
no more grace? Romans 11.6.
Give way to man's own righteousness to stand in the same room with faith, and
it will not be long ere it get into the place of faith; yea, of the object of
faith, Christ himself, and cut off our part in the righteousness of God. Romans
10.3.
Let tradition come in to the aid of Scripture, either to tell us which is
Scripture, or what it means, it will soon get sovereignty over Scripture in
regard of authority, and make the Commandments of God of none effect, Mat. 15.6.
in point of interpretation. Let Saints give (I say not merit, but even) names
and distinctions to Christians, this will make Christ to be divided, and Paul
crucified, 1 Cor. 12.13.
in the opinions of men.

Man's corruption makes him (even at the lowest) hardly endure a superior, but
if once tickled with the entrance upon, or hope of sovereignty, he brooks no
equal. There is much ado to keep great spirits in the place of subjects: but
let them be once admitted to share in royalty with their Masters, they are
restless till they engrosse it, and make servants or nothing of their Masters.
If Charles Martel and Pipin his son, be admitted to steer with the Kings of
France, they want but the Popes title or a new coined distinction to get the
possession of sole sovereignty. So our hypocrite well knows if he can but
bring in a companion that will prove a rival, that in the end will thrust truth
besides the Throne. Therefore if he have a mind to undermine any truth, let
him set up any competitor, and his work is more then half done. He need but sit
still and look on, he is sure of the issue? Let but man or any thing wherein
man has to do, be once allowed to share with Christ in the matter of merit,
intercession, authority, jurisdiction; this will soon set Antichrist above all
that is called God, or worshipped. 2 These. 2.4.
Thus traditions once magnified above proportion, began to accuse Scripture as
insufficient, obscure, a dead letter, a leaden rule, a nose of wax; and in
time, a very Childrick not fit to reign. Let those that troubled the
Galatians, set up works to share with Christ in the matter of justification;
circumcision to be joined with Baptism; some legal ceremonies to go cheek by
joule with Christian Liberty, and this will soon remove them to another Gospel.
Gal. 1.6


Contrarily, Differ.
the Disciple of truth will neither preach nor receive any other Gospel then
what he has received in the written word.

He knows but one Lord, one Lord, one faith, one Gospel in truth and indeed. If
any other be obtruded he rejects it as spurious, because no change, no
additament in matters of faith is henceforth to be expected or admitted, the
same Doctrine, the same Sacraments are to continue to the end of the world.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. Heb. 13.8.


If any handmaid will know her distance, she is welcome so long as she keeeps
her due limits, if Hagar once perk up, and grow malipert, out of doors she
shall, how grievous soever it be unto him in other respects. For well he knows
the aspiring nature of in-mates, and that God, abhorring the adultery of
Alchimy-doctrine, has made his Truths like gold and silver. Gold cannot endure
the least quantity of Latin to be mixed with it; nor silver of tin: no more
will truth brook the least mixture with any adulterous wares, or society with
any competitor, nor will the judicious Christian take Alchimy for current
coin, although it bear the stamp of the Kings image and superscription.

If the true Christian once discovers this plot of Satan, or of any his
Ministers, he resolves not to give place by subjection (or admixtion) no not
for an hour, that the truth of the Gospel might continue Gal. 2.5.
with him. In this case it was that Paul withstood, not only those of the
circumcision. Tit. 1.10.
but even the blessed Apostle Peter, and that to his face; who, though free
from erring in doctrine, gave offense by his practice in favor of the Jewish
Ceremonies, and went not with a right foot according to the truth of the
Gospel, but admitted those obsolete rites to come to near it. We have a cloud
of such witnesses opposing the usurpations of Antichrist in every progress of
the Mystery of iniquity. The Scriptures alone are abundantly able to make the
simplest Christian wise enough unto salvation, and thoroughly to furnish him to
every good work, 2 Timothy 3.16, 17.
as a rule sufficient for all the Israel of God; Therefore he gives heed to
this as the surest way-mark, the most infallible guide, without minding what
others say that pretend to show us a shorter cut or a surer way.

Thus this hypocrite under pretense of not suffering truth to go naked, puts
her into linsey-woolsey, garments, thereby to pervert the Gospel of Christ; *
the disciple of truth remembering him that forbad such clothing, abhorres such
minglings, and the truth of the Scriptures alone is with him, all in all. The
one sets up somewhat else with truth, to pull it down; the other admits only of
truth, that he may the better uphold and maintain it.

This hypocrite, in all his erratick opinions, ever advances man, with
derogation from --.

It is not enough that he set up errors in the room of truth, unless his
errors set up man in the room of God. If he admit of such a thing as
predestination, it is only such as passes upon foresight of works, or faith,
or free use of our own will; taking the freedom of Election from God, and
giving the glory of his grace, to the free will of man. If he allow of
justification by God, he gives it either to man's act of faith, or to the merit
of his works; if not in whole, yet in part man must have his share, and it must
be believed for a truth, that the most honorable way for Christ to save
sinners, is not (as God would have it Hos. 1.7.
) to save them by himself; but by making man able to merit his own salvation.
Thus as the Jews, Romans 10.3
being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going about to establish
their own righteousness, submitted not themselves to the righteousness God;
so these will put in for a part at least in the honor of saving, or they will
not be saved. And what Lactantius Lib. 1. ca. 11
observed of the Heathenish idolaters, is true of this hypocrite; He seems
zealous for God, but yet in truth he owns him no otherwise than as a Jupiter,
an helping father, instead of an absolute Savior, beside whom there is no
other to save. For he that takes in man to help save himself, cannot own God as
doing all.

If God tell us that we are kept by the power of God through faith unto
salvation 1 Pet. 4.5.
; this hypocrite makes it a great point of Christian modesty to be still
doubting of our salvation further then we earn it at fingers ends; not trusting
so much to the power of God, as to our own will for perseverance in grace. If
he receive Gods Word for divine truth, it is for man's sake, the testimony of
the Church, and in man's sense too, as the Church interprets it; man's traditions
must be of equal authority with the written Word, and God must not be believed,
unless man says he speaks true. Thus the Romanist, who yet enjoins blind
obedience to be given to man, and to take all upon trust from the sea of Rome,
or from their more immediate superiors, although far inferior to their Roman
God; but let God speak never so plainly, none must believe him further than
those Rulers or Pharisees have believed on him John 7.48
; there they can be bold to enquire, dispute, dispense, contradict and
blaspheme; for, if Paul say, it is better to marry then to burn 1 Cor. 7.9.
, not so, says Bellarmine, in the case of Priests; here, melius est urere quam
nubere, it is better to burn than to marry, whatever the Adversaries bawle to
the contrary. If Paul withstood Peter to the face, because he was to be blamed
Gal. 2.11.
; I deny that, says Baronius, who will maintain that Peter was not to blame.
Dare these Cardinals use their Pope so? Thus these hypocrites who believe not
God without a surety; but man upon his own authority, are by false sureties
brought to believe the devil instead of God? and to set up doctrines of devils
speaking lies in hypocrisy, that derogate from the truth and honor of God 1 Timothy 4.1, 2.
.

Nor is this kind of hypocrite to be found only in the adulterous bed of the
man of sin beyond the Alps, but even nearer home. Are there not found
elsewhere men arising, and speaking many of the same perverse things, to draw
away disciples after them Acts 20.30.
? They pretend to more strict examinations of the common Tenets, and to be more
dilligent inquirers after truth. But mark their positions they broach, and we
shall ever discover this snake in their bosoms, and this design to lie at the
bottom of them all. What else does the doctrine of Election upon foresight of
faith set up, but man to be the cause of passing that decree? what means that
of universal redemption, universal grace, and many more, but to make the whole
work of man's salvation to depend upon the will of man in accepting if he
please, or rejecting as he list what is offered by God?

Differ.
Contrarily, the sincere disciple of Christ altogether advances God, how much
soever man be abased.

He will not endure that any flesh should glory in Gods presence 1 Cor. 1.29.
. He can and does make use of men as helpers of his faith 2 Cor. 1.24.
; but not as having dominion over it, or as authors of it; which he freely
acknowledges to be not of himself, but the sole gift of God Ephesians. 2.8.
, as well as salvation it self. As he desires to hear none but those that
receive only from the Lord what they deliver unto him; so he receives nothing
from them, but what they have received of the Lord. He can esteem them very
highly for their works sake 1 These. 5.13.
; but he looks upon them as no more but Ministers by whom he has believed,
even as the Lord gives to every man 1 Cor. 3.5.
. He can wait upon Paul's planting, and Apollos watering, but he looks only at
God for the increase Ver. 6.
. And when he finds the increase, he acknowledges the demonstration of the
Spirit and of power, and will not endure that his faith should stand in the
wisdom of men, but in the power of God 1 Cor. 2.4.5
. If his Minister wax proud, and exalt himself above that which is meet, and
arrogate what is due to God, as Herod; he will not cry out, the voice of a God
Act. 12.22, 23
, but leaves him as one that is falling into the condemnation of the devil; as
well knowing that only he that only seeks his glory that sent him, is true,
and deserves to be heard and honored. He will make man's will and reason yield
and stoop, that the truth of God may alone be advanced. He detracts not from
the just power and authority of man, as the Anabaptist, Familist, and other
Separatists; but if man will reach any doctrine by which man comes in
competition with God, under a fair pretense of making God amends some other
way, he abhors it as a doctrine of devils. He tries not the word by the
Revelations of man, but revelations by the Word of God. He disclaimes that
holiness of man which might move God to Elect him, and renounceth those works
and faith it self, as a work that pretends to justify him; that free grace
might be magnified and man abased, and not rejoice in himself. He will never
join in that worship, in which God must be beholding to man to invent and
prescribe it. He will never be of that Religion which sets up man above all
that is called God, or that is worshipped. He reverenceth and makes honorable
account of those Christian Worthies, the ancient Fathers of purer times, as
holy and learned men; yet men, and not God; holy, but not without blemish;
learned, but not infallible, not without their errors. Yea, he receives not
the Prophets and Apostles themselves without exception, because holy or learned
above others, but because they were infallibly inspired 2 Timothy 3.16.
, and spoke (and wrote) as they were moved by the holy Ghost 2 Pet. 1 21.
.

Thus this Hypocrite is as the Serpent in the fable, whose tail would needs
take upon it to lead the way; the true Christian will not set a step in any
way, but where Christ his head has led the way, and left us an example that we
should follow his steps 1 Pet. 2.21.
. The one cares not how low he sets God, so he may exalt man; the other never
troubles himself to lay man low, so he may exalt God.

This hypocrite makes the Scripture but a letter of credence, and his own
fancies the

He will say as you do, that the Scripture is the Rule; so you will believe as
he bids you, that his fancies are the meaning of that Rule. He will accept of
any text, so you except not against his gloss. If you will believe as the
Church believes, he cares not what you believe. Let but the horse feed where he
ties him, and he will be sure to tie him where he shall have nothing to feed
on, but what he gives him. If the letter of the word serve not his turn, you
must take his interpretation contrary to the letter, to be the meaning of the
letter. Hoc est corpus meum, this is my body, must be understood of inanimate
bread, speaking of a proper body, not of a living Christ, speaking of inanimate
bread, signifying his living body.

If you come to plead your evidence in his Court, he will take away your
evidence, and tell you, you must trust the Court, the Advocate; yea, the
adversaries themselves. He will assure you he has excellent wares; but he
makes his shop as dark as he can; if he have any light, it is a back light, and
that is sure to be a false one. In d^ctrines, he carries not his customers to
the lightsome part of the Scriptures, but to the darkest end of his shop, or
the warehouses under ground, such as are humane traditions, authorities or
inventions of men, that so he may sell off his false wares instead of staple
commodities; alchimy instead of silver; yea, he can make a Cellar of a Shop,
darkening the Scriptures with Allegories, etc. that his collusion may not
appear; just as Papists darken their Churches with pictures of the Fathers,
that they may make children of their proselytes; and then multiply their Tapers
to give a greater luster to their images and ornaments. He locks up the
Scriptures and the key too from the people, when he seems most ready to open
and divulge them; as Plato, his Philosophy, under Allegories, or as Aristotle,
under exotic terms of Art.

Differ.
Contrarily, the Disciple of Christ desires to be credited in nothing, but what
he makes out of the Scriptures alone.

If the Scriptures be under lock, he makes a key out of the lock it self, and
pretends to nothing but what is written. If he try the spirits, it is by the
Word, and believes not that spirit to which the Word bears not witness Esaias
8.20.
; nor will himself be tried by ought else. He never takes that for truth that
seeks corners, nor that for evidence that loves concealments. He is not as the
Egyptian that affects Hierogliphicks; but as the old Roman that wrote all his
Laws in open Tables. He is not for dark lanthornes, or for putting a candle
under a bushel, but upon a candlestick. Alchimy shows best in the dark, but he
will not take that for silver that cannot endure trial by the open day. If the
Scriptures give not testimony to Christ Joh. 5.39
, he pronounces him a false christ Mark 13.22.
, cried up by false prophets that are gone out into the world 1 John 4.1.
. He will do nothing in the dark; but comes to the light of Scripture John
3.21.
, that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God; and
manifested so, that they may be made manifest not only to God, who searches
the heart, but to the consciences of men 2 Cor 5.11.
, who must judge by the works.

Thus the hypocrite pretends a commission, that he may deceive; the other in
all things produces his commission, that he may prove himself to be no
deceiver. The one abuses an authority which he cares not for, but only to
serve himself of it; the other keeps close to his rule, that he may show how
much he makes conscience not to wrest or abuse it; the one alleges the words
of Scripture without the sense; the other takes that for the word, which is the
true meaning of God. The one falls down to an idol in the Sacrament of the
Supper, and feeds upon a shadow in a dream, by wresting of the words; the other
lifts up his heart to God and feeds upon Christ indeed by following the sense.
The one knows no eating of Christ, but in the Capernaitical sense John 5.52.
; the other feeds on him by faith, which finds his flesh to be meat indeed
Verse 55.
; not for the belly, but for the soul, and so he lives by him Verse 57.


first hangs out an opinion of his own, then forces the Scripture to
countenance and own it.

First, he sees vanity and lying divination, and then says, the Lord says it
Ezekiel. 13.6
, when all is but a vain vision Verse. 7.
. Thus the devil persuaded Christ to tempt God, and then urges Scripture, (He
shall give his Angels charge over thee, etc. Mat. 4.6.
) to warrant the temptation. Thus the Pope usurps the place of an head and
foundation of the Church, and then flies to those wrested words of Christ to
Peter Mat. 16.18.
, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church. He first begets a
bastard, then fathers it upon Scripture, and lays it at Gods door to be
nursed and kept at his charge.

Thus most of the Popish opinions are more ancient then their proofs, and most
of their proofs are more man's than Gods, yet fathered upon God to feather their
own nests the better. No Heretic enters the lists with an Orthodox Christian,
but he is ready with Rabshekeh 2 King. 18.25
, to say, Am I come up without the Lord? He well knows that albeit the sense
of the Word destroy his fancies, yet the Name of the Word gives credit to his
fables.

Differ.
On the contrary, the disciple of Christ, first hearkeneth what God the Lord
speaks in the Scripture, then speaks the same thing which the Scripture does.

He comes not to a Scripture to corrupt the Word of God 2 Cor. 2.17.
, nor to make Merchandise of it; but to learn from it, and to teach as he has
learned, in all sincerity, as of God, in the sight of God, speaking of Christ,
as in Christ. He admits of no coin, although bearing the image and
superscription of God, but what is coined in his own mint. He admits of no
doctrine, brings forth none, but what was conceived in the womb of the Words:
Let Papists call the Scripture the Exchange for Heretics, because sometimes by
them abused; and the Devils Voucher, because by him alleged to tempt Christ
himself unto sin Mat. 4.
; yet, as our Savior refused not to be tried thereby, but opposed the same
book in the genuine sense against the Devils abuse of the letter of it; so a
Christian that has received the love of the truth, will not be ashamed to own
whatever Scripture (under the greatest disgrace) avoucheth, nor be to seek of
weapons taken out of that armory to discover and repel all the fallacies of the
Devils Sophisters, let them be as cunning as he can make them to wrest the
Scripture to their own destruction 2 Pet. 3.16
.

Thus, this Hypocrite has recourse to the Word for clothes to apparel his
bastard; the true Christian goes to the same word for milk to nourish the
child that was begotten of it; the one makes use of the word to name the
child of his own brain; the other writes the name of truth upon the child of
the Word.

This Hypocrite under color of purging of errors crept into the Text,

He is a great pretender to preserve or restore the purity of Scripture, which
he gives out to be corrupted; not that he cares for the Scripture more than
Judas for the poor; but, that under color of purging out this corruption, he
may cut off what he list that makes against him. He can not only wrest
Scripture, but wring off the neck of it, if it stand in his way. He can mangle
it by concealing a part, as Satan in alleging that of the Psalmist, He shall
give his Angels charge over thee, leaving out those words (which indeed make
the former capable of fulfilling) to keep thee in all thy ways: that, shows
where the protection and guard of Angels may be exspected, not when we go
without God, much less when against him. Thus, the Papists, in their common
Catechismes prepared for the vulgar, blot out the second Commandment that might
make their vassals to boggle at images, as if that were foisted in by some
Lutherans or Calvinists, as the Northern borderers were wont to say of the
eighth Commandment, when pressed with it to suppress their daily theeveries,
that that Commandment was none of Gods making, but thrust into the Decalogue by
King Henry the eighth. And, as some Arrians not able to stand before the
strength of that text, 1 John 5.7
There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy
Ghost, and these three are one, reject the whole as spurious, lest their Dagon
should fall before it; so there are still not wanting some who will make bold
with Scripture to allow what makes for them, and to proscribe what ever is
against them; not upon that skore, but under color of a spurious additament to
the genuine Text.

Thus, they pretend the original of the Old Testament is corrupted by the Jews;
and the original of the New by Heretics, that thereby they may set up their
corrupt vulgar Latin Isidor Clarius
Translation (in whom one of their own has noted above nine hundred errors)
in the room of the Originals, preferring it before them for purity and
authority.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true disciple of Christ esteems every Word of God concerning all things
to be right; nor daring to curtail, or alter it, or to add unto it.

He does not pick and choose, but he takes, and eats all the Book of God. He
has no design to cross the Word, therefore he has no design upon the Word
to pervert or curtail it. He needs not to pervert, or decurt that holy and
straight Rule, or any Author agreeing therewith, to maintain any private
opinions. His Religion is cut out by the measure of the Word. And if in any
thing his opinions deviate from it, he will bring his opinions to the Word, or
cast them away. He knows that all truth is uniforme, no one part thwarteth
another; and that, he takes for his clothing; neither using the sheers nor the
needle; for he neither cuts off any part of the word as too much for his
purpose, nor sowes on any shreds to patch up his Religion. He can spare nothing
which the Word affords, nor admit of any thing, although coming from an Angel
from heaven, which may add to the Gospel of Christ.

Thus the hypocrite is like the false mother that is earnest to have the child
divided; the disciple of truth, as the true mother, abhors that division. The
one cares not for Scripture, unless he may order it as he pleases; the other
reverenceth it so much that he will not endure to see it mangled, but gives
himself up to be absolutely ordered by it.

delights most in finding out new interpretations, and strange senses of
Scripture, quarrelling the plain and most generally received Expositions
thereof.

Understand this chiefly in points wherein he differs from the Orthodox Tenets,
and harmony of truth. And here, sometimes he makes advantage of various and
doubtful readings. Thus some Romanists to deprave the first Gospel that ever
was published to the world Genesis 3.15.
reading haec for hic, and, instead of He (that is, Christ) shall break thine
head, they read, she shall break it, and so transfer to the Virgin Mary the
work of our Redemption performed by Christ. So, to prove their Church to be the
only and perpetually visible Church instead of the true reading, Psalm. 19.4.
In them he has set a Tabernacle for the Sun, they embrace the corrupt
rendering of the vulgar Latin, posuit in sole Tabernaculum suum; he has set
his Tabernacle in the Sun. And to make out their uncomfortable and heterodox
position of uncertainty of salvation, they take hold of that of the Preacher
mistranslating, No man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them
Eccles. 9.1
, which Hierome; through mistake renders thus (if that translation be his)
nescit homo utrum amore vel odio dignus sit, sed omnia in futurum servantur
incerta. Man knows not whether he be worthy either of love or hatred, but all
things are kept doubtful until hereafter; and hence they will needs conclude,
that a Christian in this life cannot be assured of his salvation.

And, how many of that faction, and other disciples of Pelagius have toiled and
sweated to put new interpretations upon the seventh and ninth chapters of the
Epistle to the Romans, as they also wrest sundry other Scriptures to maintain
the Pelagian Tenets touching the decrees of God, and diverse other points
depending thereupon, which are in difference between them and the Orthodox, who
knows not?

Again, this hypocrite sometimes, despairing of making out his fancies by
plain Texts, he flies to allegories, to prove the Popes transcendency above
the Emperor, he quotes that place, Genesis 1.16.
God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day; to prove the
Popes double power, he alleges Ecce duo gladii Luke 22.38
. Behold here are two swords. To establish the Popes coactive usurpation, he
produces that, Acts 10.13
arise Peter, kill and eat. To prove the faith of Laics to depend wholly on
their Clergy, he quoteth that place, Job 1.14.
The Oxen were plowing, and the Asses were feeding beside them. To confirm
further the visibility of their Church, he alleges Mat. 5.14.
the City on a Hill which cannot be hid; whereas we may rather conclude their
Church to be Babylon, because it retains the place that City of that is built
upon seven hills. He would show us the City, and have us imagine the Hill. I
mean such an Hill as Christ pronounced his Apostles to be. On the contrary,
the Separatist, though he see the Hill and Rock of truth plain enough in the
Word and Sacraments preserved among us, yet he will not believe there is a
City, that is, a true Church, there. Sometimes this hypocrite, has a doctrine,
a revelation, an interpretation differing from all that ever went before him,
and that he fathers upon a light within him, which yet he is not able so to
make out that others may see as well as he. Whereas this light is an ignis
fatuus, a light that befools him, and makes him strive to make fools of
others. If it were a true light, it would illighten others. Whatsoever makes
manifest is light (w), if then it cannot make manifest, it is manifest that it
is no light, but a Jack with the lanthorn, or rather indeed palpable darkness *
instead of light.

Thus this hypocrite perverteth the Scripture by corrupting the letter, or
turns off our eyes from the sense, by drawing them after pretended
Allegories. Plain interpretations are not for his turn, and therefore let
there be never so great a consent of the best and soundest Expositors therein,
he looks down upon them all with scorn and contempt, as being all wide, or
short of the truth, and is ready to say to them thwarting his forced glosses, 1
King. 22.24
which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto you.

Contrarily, The true disciple of truth, delights most in the plainest sense,
Differ.
whereto the consent of Scripture and Analogy of faith do most clearly lead him.

He knows that as the Word of God is plain to him that with an honest heart,
desires to understand and obey it John 7.17.
: so there are plain Texts enough, to prove every thing necessary to salvation,
without help of allegories, which when made use of by the Spirit of God in
Scripture (not invented by man to help midwife a bastard into the Church) they
were never esteemed Argumentative, beyond their proper and literal scope and
meaning. And so far is he from disliking that sense or Exposition that is most
common, that he loves it the better, because so many of the judiciously learned
concur in it; and is so much abhorrent from new coined glosses, that he
therefore suspects them till he has sifted them to the bran, which if he want
ability to do, he will suspend his entertaining of them, until by the help of
some more able discerner of things that differ, he has tried this Spirit
whether it be of God or not 1 John 4.1.
, and searched the Scriptures to see whether these things be so Acts 17.11
; especially in those times wherein he that is blind may every where discover
many false prophets gone out into the world. He is a child of light 1 These. 5.5
; loves the light, and comes to it, because he does truth John 3.21.
. But he abhors false lights, that tend to deceive and cozen with a false
gloss; not to manifest the true worth and goodness of what is showed to him
by it. Let others pretend what they will of a light within them, if they cannot
make it out by the light without them, Esaias 8.20.
the Law and the Testimony of Gods written Word, he soon determines with God
himself (the name of whose light they abuse) that there is no light in them.

Thus this hypocrite uses the Scripture as Balaam his Ass, if she will carry
him on in his way, he rides her; if she refuse to go further, he will beat and
abuse her, being sorry that he has not a sword to kill her; the true Christian
makes use of it, as of a Moses rod which he preserves entire without bending it
one way or other, that it may better enable him to produce by it what ever is
commanded of God.

This hypocrite is a great admirer of himself, and a despiser of others.

He that dares be so bold with God himself, as to set up man above him, will
not forget the lifting up of himself with trampling upon others. An Heretic,
what show soever he make of humility through hypocrisy, is ever a proud man 1 Timothy 6.4.
. To speak great swelling words of vanity 2 Pet. 2.18.
, is so natural to him, that it is a chief part of his art whereby he does
allure, and draw away disciples after him, even those that were clean escaped
from them who live in error. Simon Magus bewitched the people more by his
giving out that himself was some great one Acts 8.9.
, than by his sorcery. For to him (hereupon) they had regard, from the least to
the greatest, saying, this man is the great power of God Ver. 10.
. You shall see this spirit in every Heretic mentioned in Scripture. Zedekiah
the false prophet, how does he scorn and vilify Micaiah, when he will not
speak as they did to the King 1 King. 22.24
? How scornfully do the Pharisees take up the Officers that commended the
preaching of Christ? and, how contemptibly of him? Have any of the Rulers, or
of the Pharisees believed on him? But this people that know not the Law are
cursed! How disdainfully do they answer that poor man who being cured of his
natural blindness, asked them if they would he Christ's Disciples Joh. 7 48.49
! They reviled him, Job. 9.27, 28, 29
saying thou art his Disciple, we are Moses Disciples; we know that God spoke
unto Moses, but as for this fellow we know not whence he is!

Thus those seducers in Corinth, how did they lift up the crest above Paul,
commending themselves 2 Cor. 10.^
; and disparaging him for a man of neither grace in his presence nor weight in
his speech Ver. 10.
, his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible, or nothing worth.
How did those false Apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves into
the Apostles of Christ, boast and glory in themselves, and vilify Paul 2 Cor.
11.
? and this is the common badge of all such imps of Satan, under the guise of a
voluntary humility, to be vainly puffed up by their fleshly mind Col. 2.18.
; Nor is this any wonder; for, if even he that proclaims himself a servant of
servants, exalts himself so high, that God himself must be content with the
lower hand 2 These. 2.4.
; Mat* ^0.25
will not they who call the Master of the house Beelzebub, much more call them
of his household, until they perish in the gainsaying of Core Jude 11.
?

Differ.
Contrarily, the true disciple of truth does nothing in strife or vainglory;
but in lowliness of mind, he esteems others better then himself Phil. 2.3.
.

Thus Paul while a Pharisee and a false teacher, tells us what high thoughts he
had of himself Acts 26.5 Gal. 1.13, 14. Phil. 3.4, 5, 6.
a man of the highest form, and the highest in his form. But when it pleased
God, who called him by his grace, to reveal his son to him, and to make him a
Paul, a teacher of truth, how does he fall in his own eyes, and set others above
him? I am the least of the Apostles, not meet to be called an Apostle 1 Cor.
15.9.
There is no true Teacher, but he is truly humble, and dares not make himself
of the number, or compare himself with those who commend themselves 2 Cor.
10.12.
. If he be put to it by false Apostles that thereby seek not only to derogate
from his Ministry, but to shake the faith of those who depend upon it; He will
tell you when he boasts, and why; as being compelled to it by others, not
affecting it himself; and even then corrects himself too, I am become a fool
in glorying 2 Cor. 12.11
. In such cases it is no more unseemly to appeal to men that know his
abilities, then to appeal to God from men when his innocence is unjustly
traduced. He can be exalted where God may be honored, but he will never exalt
himself against or above the meanest servants of Jesus Christ, nor tread upon
them to make himself higher; and it is a trouble to him to glory, even when it
is needful to hold up the reputation of his Ministry without cause calumniated.

Thus the Hypocrite is a Diotrephes, that loves to have the pre-eminence John
3.9.
; the true Christian is as Paul, that though he be free from all men, yet makes
himself (not in hypocrisy, but in reality) a servant to all, that he might
gain the more 1 Cor. 9.19
unto Christ. The one stud es his own reputation more then the winning of
souls; the other cares not how low he be in reputation 1 Cor. 4.3. 2 Cor. 13.7.
, and how high others, so it may tend to the increase of the body of Christ, to
the edifying of it in love.

what ever show of zeal for the truth he holds forth in his eccentrick
opinions, has chiefly self-interest in his eye.

This is the first wheel, yea, the Phusee, the inward spring that moves his
watch so swiftly, and the haven he contends unto, although he seem never so
earnest to make another Port. He seems as zealous for the truth, as ever Jehu
was against the house of Ahab; yea, so zealous, that he will not stick to
persecute the Church of God for those truths which he calls heresy; but all is
to swim through the blood of the truth to his own gain or greatness. He is
(as Canaan) a Merchant, but the balances of deceit are in his hand Hos. 12.7
. He is not for buying the truth, but sells the souls of men Rev. 18.13
. He pretends to be a great admirer of truth, and to have the persons of some
who hold it forth, in admiration for advantage sake Jude 16.
. But the naked truth is, if you uncase him, he runs greedily after the
error of Balaam for reward Ver. 11.
. He will forsake the right way, and go astray any whether, even following
Balaam 2 Pet. 2.15
the son of Bozor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; for under pretense
of teaching the way of God more purely, he privily brings in damnable heresies;
and, through covetousness will he with fained words make merchandise of you
Ver. 1, 3.
; and under color of buying the truth, he sells it and the souls of men too,
for the wages of iniquity.

What makes the man of sin so zealous for his doctrines of the Saints merits,
works of Superirrogation, Indulgences, Purgatory, and many more, but that he
may have the selling of all? Purgatory keeps his Kitchen warm, Indulgences be
the commodities he sells to deliver souls out of Purgatory, works of
Superirrogation of the Saints (which he, as the common treasury of the Church,
has in keeping) must be held out; or in vain to think of making a market of
his indulgences, for they will never go off, without those works as that which
gives worth and value to them. Therefore he pursues with fire and faggot all
that oppose them. All Germany must be in an uproar, the Emperor must fight,
and all must assist, if Luther, but a poor Monk, shall oppose these great
truths of Antichrist. Our Henry the eighth shall be styled Defender of the
Faith, for writing in their defense. But when his emissaries sent out to
publish his indulgences, return with an huge mass of treasure made of them,
Pope Leo the tenth, then blesses himself, and unmasketh to his Cardinals with
this exclamation; What a world of wealth have we gotten by that fable of
Christ! sporting themselves with their own deceivings 2 Pet. 2.13.
.

Indeed all are not led with that low bait of base gain, some with Corah and
his company are taken with ambition to make themselves higher, by making Moses
and Aaron lower. The quarrel was, Numb. 16.3
that Moses and Aaron took too much upon them, and lifted themselves up above
the Congregation of the Lord; their pretense was plausible, all the Lords
Congregation are holy every one of them, and the Lord is among them; but that
which made them so zealous, was not indeed the superiority of some above the
rest, but that themselves were not those superiors. Therefore Moses tells them
back in the same words, that which lay deepest in their hearts, namely their
ambition; Ye take too much upon you ye sons of Levi Ver. 8.
. It was not enough for them to be brought so near unto God, unless they might
have the Priesthood also Ver. 10.
. Their word is parity, a levelling; but their aim was Domination. Balaam
aimed at both, else he would never have been so mad and sottish to go on, after
so many extraordinary warnings to return. He could be well content to curse
Israel upon a civil account as enemies to Balack; but it was in hope of a
blessing from Balack according to that engagement made by his Ambassadors Numb.
22.17
I will promote thee to very great honor, and I will do whatsoever thou say
unto me. What makes the Pope so zealous to maintain the supremacy of Peter, but
that he may under that title, the better require Kings and Emperors to hold
his stirrup, and to kiss his foot; that he may have not only dominion over
their faith, but domination over them and all their Dominions.

And thus, as it was with the old Pharisees, They loved the praise of men more
then the praise of God; so is it with all Heretics, they have an eye at
themselves to their own gain, wealth, applause, preferment, in all the
strugglings of their seeming zeal for their private opinions under the name
and style of the truths of God.

Contrarily, the true disciple of Christ cares not what he loses, what he
suffers, Differ.
so truth may prevail and triumph, and that the Word of the Lord may have a
free course, and be glorified.

He loves the truth for the truths sake, and abhors juggling in a thing so
sacred, and the prostituting of divine verity to the base lusts of man. 2 Cor.
13.8.
He can do nothing against the truth (whatever he might gain by it,) but for
the truth, (whatever he part with for it.) He will buy the truth at any rate,
but not sell it Prove. 23.23
upon any terms, What Balaam said in hypocrisy, because the Lord restrained
him from doing what he would, that the disciple of truth speaks from the heart
should, God leave him to do what he list, Numb. 22.8.
If Balack should give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond
the Word of the Lord my God, to do less or more. Every grain of truth is
precious to a sincere heart; it is like his faith 1 Pet. 1.7.
, much more precious then the gold that perishes, though tried with fire, the
Law of Gods mouth is better unto him then thousands of gold and silver Ps.
119.72.
. Therefore he cannot be so weak and foolish as to put gold or honor in the
scale with truth; or, so far forget himself to let go such a price put into his
hand to get wisdom, for that which is so far below it; or to part with that
which cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious Onix, or the
Sapphire; And which the gold and the Crystal cannot equal, therefore with him,
the exchange of it shall not be for Jewels of fine gold Job 28.16, 17
.

Thus this Hypocrite, as the Waterman, rows one way, and looks another; the
true Christian as those Converts, that ask the way to Zion with their faces
thitherwards Jer. 50.5.
, the one under color of giving witness to the truth maintains a profitable
error, the other abhors even to maintain truth it self upon the account of
worldly profit; the one supposes gain to be godliness, the other from such
turns away 1 Timothy 6.5
.

in his most glorious shows of holiness, is a Patron and Teacher of sin.

He is a great professor of an holy and austere life, not out of love to
holiness, but to gain the more credit to his errors, and to make the more
proselytes. But all his righteousness is Pharisaical, and a cloak for his
inward covetousness 2 Pet. 2.14.
and guile. Trace his footsteps to his den, and you shall find this Fox at his
prey, and these Wolves, ravening in their holes, notwithstanding their sheeps
clothing. The Pharisees pretended much piety in mantaining their bills of
divorce Mat. 5.31, 32.
, although no fornication were committed; but in the judgment of Truth it
self, this was to teach him that, for any other cause put away his wife, to
commit adultery, and to be guilty of what she committed after such an unlawful
desertion. Thus what Moses permitted for the hardness of their hearts, they
maintained and allowed for good and warrantable, and so were both Teachers and
Patrons of sin, how glorious soever their outsides were. Nor were they any
better in teaching children, required of their parents to supply their wants,
to say, it is Corban Mat. 15.5. Mar. 7.11
; that is, a gift devoted and consecrated to Corban, the public chest, of
which the Pharisees had the the keeping, (and the emptying of it too;) and then
they should be free from relieving their aged and needy parents. This was to
make void the fifth Commandment by their traditions, and to teach sin, to
oppose duty in honoring their father and their mother. To say nothing of the
doctrine of Balaam, Rev. 2.14
who taught Balack to lay a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to
send out their fairest Virgins and women under pretense to victual their camp,
or out of curiosity to take a view of those stangers, thereby to inflame the
Israelites lust, and to commit fornication; whereby he did them more mischief
then all his cursing could have procured. Nor will I make mention of the
Nicolaitan Tenets, Rev. 2.15
to justify obscene practices. The Apostle Peter deciphers out those heretics
which privily brought in damnable heresies, not only by their more close and
secret practices Numb. 25
, having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin 2 Pet. 2.14
, how much soever they dissemble it to beguile unstable souls; but, by their
tenets and assertions, wherein they teach to despise Government, by speaking
evil of Dignities Ver. 10.
.

Thus, as the Antichrist (who as for other reasons, so more especially for
teaching of sin,) deserves this brand from the holy Ghost to be called that man
of sin 2 These. 2.3.
; Because he not only breaks the Commandments of God, but teached men so,
more then ever the old Pharisees did, who never received Christ, nor made
profession of him.) He opens a School of vice, giving dispensations for
incestuous marriages, from sworn allegiance, from safe conducts of Princes,
confederations of States (O! Regulus, how true a Roman were thou, in comparison
of these, not Romans, but Carthaginians rather!) that establishes wickedness
by a Law, allowing public brothel-houses, taking money for whores (albeit no
hire of an whore should come into the Tabernacle of God,) teaching that
fornication is but a venial sin; and in their Priests, not so bad as
marriage, with many more, that I blush to name; so is this, more or less the
character of every Heretical hypocrite that teaches and maintains lies in
stead of truths of God, which lays men under greatest contempt with God; for,
Esaias 9.15
the prophet which teaches lies, he is the tail, that is, the basest, the
very skum of all.

Differ.
Contrarily, the Teacher of truth is truly a Minister of righteousness.

He intends the advancement of Gods glory, as well by the purity of his
doctrine, as by the integrity of his life. In his doctrine he is a Teacher of
righteousness John 13.17
; in his life a doer of the will of God John 7.17.
. In all things showing himself a pattern of good works, in doctrine showing
uncorruptnesse, gravity, sincerity Tit 2.7, 8.
, sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he that is of the contrary part
may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of him.

I do not say he is without his faults, his errors, in many thing we offend all
James 3.2.
. But his faults do not flow from his doctrine, but are forbidden by it: his
errors nor are his continued, after better information. He may err, but will
be no Heretic. If he were Apollos himself, he will not think much to be more
perfectly instructed Act. 18.26
, and then he is sure, that if in any point he be otherwise minded, God will
reveal even this unto him Phil. 3.13
. He knows that returning into the right path is no disgrace to him that has
deviated. Pride will not do it, but humility will soon find the sweet of it.
Saint Augustine got more honor by his Retractations, then by any other work;
and he that can take shame to give God glory, will be sure to find the shame
taken off, and immortal honor set in the room.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Ahabs Prophets that to prophecy good to the King,
taught him to sin against God and his own life; the true Christian is as
Micaiah, who will rather endure a prison, and eat the bread of affliction, then
with false prophets to engage Ahab to his own destruction; the one is as that
woman Jezabel teaching and seducing the servants of Christ to commit
fornication Rev. 2.20
, the other as the Angel, and the rest of Thyatira, which have not this
doctrine Verse 24.
, nor any like it.

The more care and pains is taken with this Hypocrite to reduce him, the more
obstinately

Obstinacy in error is the formalis ratio, the essential form, and specifical
difference of heresy, by which it is distinguished from simple error;
therefore it must needs be one of the clearest and most distinguishing
characters of an heretical hypocrite, the more he is confuted and admonished,
the more violently and tenaciously to bend his tongue like a bow for lies, to
hold fast his deceit, and to refuse to return Jer. 8.5.
. He does insanire cum ratione, run mad with reason, that is, with that which
he calls reason, and brings either reason against Scripture, or Scripture
against reason; his own irrational Arguments against express and clear
evidence of Scripture, or Scripture wrested against all Analogy of faith made
out by sound reason, and will give a reason (as he calls it) for things most
apparently contrary to Scripture; and thus as the Sunbeams confounded by
contraction, into a glass do burn; so this Heretic makes the Scripture
contorted, to set fire on the truth, and to become a ground for his error.

At his first entry upon an error, he is more modest; little more then a
Sceptick, and perhaps vents it only by way of Quaere or Question, to see how it
will take; as the devil in his first onset upon Eve Genesis 3 1.
; yea, has God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the Garden? as well
knowing, that truth once questioned is half lost, especially where men or Satan
being parties, make themselves witness and judge. He will first shake a truth,
by drawing out from some other weak or unstable souls that know not the depths
of Satan, as they speak, a reason of the truth they maintain, or of the error
they oppose; then, showing to them the weakness of their reason (which cannot
be strong, themselves being so weak;) he comes on with his own opinion and
reason to back it, as the Serpent afterward did to Eve Ver. 4, 5.
. Ye shall not surely die, for God does know that in the day ye eat thereof,
your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, etc. and we all know and
feel the issue, This he does at first privily, in the garden, to the weaker
vessel, more ductile and easy to be deceived; and he takes his time, when the
man, more able to discover and oppose his devices, is away. Of this sort are
they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins,
led away with diverse lusts; ever learning, and never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth 2 Timothy 3.6, 7.
; while men, that should look better to him, sleep, he sows his tares Mat. 13.25
.

Thus he begins, perhaps with one single opinion, which by degrees he
adventures to bring into the light, as cats do their kittins before they can
well see, thinking that now others will be as much in love with his brat as he
is himself; and being as much taken with his opinion, as Phidias the Painter
with the first picture of his own drawing, who, wherever he went, strongly
conceited that he saw his picture go before him; this idolizer of the child of
his own brain, begins to be confident, that wherever he walks in the field
of the Scripture, he finds his own idol as surely set up, as Nebuchadnezzars
image in the plain of Dura Dan. 3.1.
. And now, as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that
are caught in the snare Eccl. 9.12.
; so is this poor self-conceited son of man in an evil time; the snare of the
devil suddenly falls upon him, and he is taken captive by him at his will 2 Timothy 2.26
. He himself, that before sought to subvert others, is now perverted in
himself; he not only deceives, but is himself deceived 2 Timothy 3.13.
; the devil soon sears his conscience with an hot iron 1 Timothy 4.2.
, and makes him reprobate concerning the faith 2 Timothy 3.8.
.

Let now any sound and godly Minister of Christ take him to do, and endeavor
to show him his errors, to confute them by plain and pregnant Scripture, and
to show him the absurdities that follow his fanatic opinion, he slights all
arguments, scorns and derides all opposers, as so many silly boys, not worthy
to contend with this great Goliath; and as Jannes and Jambres withstood even
Moses himself, so does this man resist the truth Ibid.
. He is engaged, and he will go through with it; and as for those which others
call absurdities, if he cannot evade them, but sees they are necessary
consequents of his grand error, he owns them all for truths; for he must take
in them, or throw the head of Sheba 2 Samuel 20.21, 22.
over the walls to Joab the pursuer, and so part with his darling, as Phaltiel
with his whore 2 Samuel 3.15
, which he is resolved to keep, and rather then part with it, give his body to
be burned 1 Cor. 13 3.
), so true is that of the spirit of truth, 2 Timothy 3.13.
evil men and seducers wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived; worse
and worse in being deceived, as well as in deceiving; yea, they deceive their
own selves.

He is not only perverted; but past all help of admonition, although convinced
in his own conscience, because he is subverted and sins against the clear
light, and will justify his errors against all evidence of truth, being
condemned of himself Tit. 3.11.
. He knows himself to be in an error, and his own judgment tells him so, and
his conscience calls upon him to renounce it upon pain of hell fire, yet he
goes on in his sin. What he has a will to hang out for a truth, he will
never acknowledge to be disproved and confuted; nay, he will presume and
conclude it proved by the fullest disproof thereof.

Thus the Pharisees having once engaged themselves in proclaiming Christ to be
a Samaritan, and to have a devil John. 8.^8.
, after our Savior had proved to them that he had not a devil, both because he
sought Gods glory and not his own, and propounded salvation and immortality to
such as receive the doctrine of the Gospel, the Jews hereupon concluded more
confidently, Now we know that thou have a devil Ver. 52.
. What he is resolved not to believe, he will never confess to be proved, how
strongly soever confirmed; and what he resolves to believe he will persist in
it, as not confuted, how clearly soever by Scripture it self condemned. Nor is
it any marvel to see such men suffer death for their opinions, their disease
being that of the Gangrene 2 Timothy 2.17
, which not only spreads, but where cure is refused or neglected, certainly
destroys; yea, though you bray this fool in a mortar, yet will not this folly
depart from him Prove. 27.22
. Nor is the reason hereof less evident then the thing it self, that men may
be satisfied with the truth hereof, and not be beguiled with the sleights of
this hypocrite, nd cunning craftiness whereby he lies in wait to deceive. He
is,

First, a proud man knowing nothing 1 Timothy 6.4.
, that is, as he ought to know 1 Cor. 8.2
, because what knowledge he has, puffs him up Ver. 1.
. It causes such a swelling in his mind and heart that he cannot see his way,
as swelling of the face that swells over the very eyelids and shuts up the eye.

Next, he has a seduced heart which leads him aside Esaias 44.20.
, so that when (as people overcome of the green-sicknesse) he feeds upon
ashes, mere delusions, he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, is there not a lie
in my right hand? An heart he has exercised with covetous practices 2 Pet. 2 14
, no marvel then if he commit idolatry with his own idol, covetousness being
so inseparable from idolatry Col. 3.5.
. Add hereunto, the witchery that is in heresy, not only to entice, but to
befoole and besot men, as it did the Gallatians. It is not without truth, that
the devil uses enchantments and witchcraft to draw people after the fondest
and sottishest errors that ever he broached by the weakest and simplest of his
seducing spirits. For the Apostle in express terms, imputes the falling off
of the Gallatians from the truth to seducers, to plain witchcraft practiced
upon them Gal. 3.1.
; and the delusions of Satan drawing men to believe a lie, are called strong
delusions, or the energy 2 These. 2 11. (...).
or efficacy of deceit, the very strength of Satan, whose vassals they are, for
being lifted up with pride, they fall into the condemnation of the devil 1 Timothy
3.6
, not only to be condemned as he is, but condemned to him, to be under his
tyranny here, and torments in hell. Therefore, what ever they pretend, they are
the Apostles of Satan 2 Cor. 11.15.
, his works they do John 8.4^.
, and their reward shall be according to their works 2 Cor. 11.15
, to which erratick stars is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever Jude
13.
.

Contrarily, the true disciple of truth in his greatest seeking of truth with
his whole heart, is ever jealous of himself, and quits any error so soon as
discovered. Differ.


While he is in a condition to know but in part (f), 1 Cor. 13.12.
he knows himself subject to error as well as others; and therefore in the
first place, he seeks the teaching of God Ps. 119.26.33 etc
by the teachings of men; and prays, O let me not wander from thy Commandments
Ver. 10
. But if he do wander, in an error he may be, because this is humane; but an
Heretic he will not be, because this is Satanical. If in some points he be
otherwise minded, than he ought, this often happens through infirmity, or want
of information; but his ingenuity is such, that when ever he has information
of it, he quickly and willingly parts with it, as true penitents from their
idols, saying, get thee hence Esaias 30.22
. He may through ignorance be as confident as Peter that Christ did too much,
in washing his feet; but no sooner does Christ discover his error, and tell
him, If I wash thee not, thou have no part with me John 13.8.
; He soon changes his mind and his language too; Lord, not my feet only, but
also my hands and my head Ver. 9.
. He may be subject through weakness and error, to dissimulation; Peter, and
Barnabas (an honest plain-hearted soul) were sick of this disease Gal. 2.12, 13.
; but when a Paul comes that tells them plainly of their error, they soon
reform and discard their error. The whole body of the Apostles together were
in a great error touching the restoring of the temporal and Civil power and
Kingdom to the Nation of the Jews, supposing Christ to have intended that by
his resurrection from the dead Acts 1.6.
. But so soon as he discovered their error to them, they enquire no further
after that matter, but according to his command, they after his ascension,
returned from Mount Olivet to Jerusalem Ver. 12.
, and there waited for the holy Ghost, according to his promise, whereby they
might be better enabled to promote his Kingdom which is not of this world. It
is his grief, if he be in any thing otherwise minded then Christ and his
Apostles; but it is his comfort, that God shall reveal this unto him Phil. 3.15.
, and his good spirit shall lead him into all truth John 16.13.
; although not to know all that Jesus did and spoke John. 21.25.
, yet to be ign^^ant of nothing necessary to be known, John 2^.31
for the secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show them
his Covenant Psalm. 25.14.
, to make them know it See the marginal reading of that verse.
.

Thus this Hypocrite incorporateth his error, as the stomach the nourishment
of meat, the true Christian vomits it up as poison, that he may not be
destroyed by it; the one marries it, the other sues out a bill of divorce
against it; the one sets so light by all confutations of his error, as Job by
the book that any Adversary could write against him Job 31.35, 36.
taking it upon his shoulder, and binding it as a Crown unto him; the other
shakes it off as Paul the Viper, so soon as he feels it to take hold of his
hand Act. 28.3, 5.
. The one as Herod will keep his Herodias, let John Baptist say what he will
against it, the other as Abimelech puts Sarah (how fair soever) away in have,
so soon as it is discovered to him to be unlawful to keep her.

CHAP. X. The Schismatical Hypocrite Is he who under a color of attaining to
more purity, Defin.
rends and wounds the body of which he is a member.
AS in the body politic, Seditious hypocrites rend and tear that, under
pretext of redressing abuses in the Civil Government; and of governing better,
(with which Absalom 2 Samuel, 15.4.
began his treason, and rebellion;) so in the Ecclesiastical body there are
seldom wanting men purer in their own eyes then their neighbors, that will
still be quarrelling the present worship, or Order, instituted of Christ, and
observed in that Church whereof they are members, until under color of
reforming these, and of removing abuses in the members of the Church, they
break all rules of Order appointed by Christ, and of love between themselves,
and so put all into confusion.

This hypocrite may well be yoked with the heretical. The Heretical hypocrite
corrupts the doctrine of faith; this, the rules of worship, Order, and love
commanded of Christ. Heresy is a poison, and Schism a wound in the body; and
many times this wound engendereth the poison; Schism is oft-times the inlet to
heresy: for he that causlesly quarrelleth with any worship or Order instituted
by Christ, and exercised in the Church to which he belongs, and that upon
pretense of showing a more excellent way, must needs infringe the doctrine
touching those Institutions, and set up another of his own, contrary to, or at
least differing from that of Christ; and, if he persist therein to separation,
wherein comes that man short of heresy? Yea, of apostasy? This is the sad
case of men unsettled, heady, high-minded, self-ended, and ambitious of glory.
For daily experience shows that such men, although bottomed upon the right
foundation of doctrine, and, in their first appearing in such an eccentrick
motion, they hold not any heterodox opinion in matters of faith (for this would
utterly blast their design,) yet wanting the mortar and Cement of humility and
love, they are soon dislocated, and removed even to another Gospel.

And to say truth, Heretics who are open enemies, little differ from
Schismatics, who are mutinous parties, that seldom rest till their mutiny
break out into open hostility. The itch of schism grows, by often rubbing,
into the scab of heresy. There is no schism, Hieron. in Tit. 3.
but runs up into some heresy, to justify her departure from the Church, if
she proceed to a separation. The measures the Devil observes, in his dance
are, first schism; then separation, the next heresy, and the last is
apostasy. And all the variance, debate, strifes, confusions, and troubles,
that like so many fits of the mother, rise up in that Church (whose unhappiness
it is to have such an Esau struggling with Jacob in the same womb,) is to be set
upon the account of this hypocrite: for, as he that takes part in a fray which
begins in words, and ends in blood, shall be found guilty of the murder
committed; So this hypocrite must answer for all the mischievous effects of his
hare-brayn'd course, how specious and plausible soever his first setting out
may seem to be.

This Schismatic being denominated from schism (the spawn of the Devil, of
which he is engendered) will hardly be discovered aright, unless we rightly
understand the nature of schism, which however it often ends in separation
from that particular body of which it is a part, yet is too often found in
those who break not off all communion with the body in the assemblies thereof.

For whether we regard the first and native signification, which imports a
rending of the same thing that was continuous, into parts; a scissure or
parting asunder of that which before was but one, or undivided, as the rent in
a cloth, Mat. 9.16: (...):
or in the veil of the Temple; Mat. 27.51. (...).
(which still hung upon the same curtain rod even after that rent made in it;)
or, whether we look upon it in the borrowed use of it, in a civil
consideration, it notes a dividing of the people one from another, not always
to a renouncing of all commerce and converse; but, in point of opinion and
affection, in reference to some other thing about which they differ; Some
judging thus, others thus. So we read of many divisions among the people
because of Christ, John 7.43.
as whether they should suffer him to be apprehended by the officers sent to
take him, ver. 32.
or not: So, else where; John 9.16.10.19.
In which places the word in the original is (...) schism; where we read not
that they thereby ceased from all civil Communication, and became of one,
several civil bodies, but continued as one, yet much divided and torn among
themselves, which was no small burden and trouble to them. So this must needs,
in an Ecclesiastical sense denote divisions in opinion and judgment of members
of the same Assembly; either about their Teachers and Guides, 1 Cor. 1 10. and
ver 12, 13. compared.
or about their Administrations, 1 Cor. 11.18.
or about their members, in all which they neither spoke the same thing, nor
joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, but had sharp
contentions, and suffered strong convulsions to the disturbing, distorting, and
distracting of the whole body.

He that is guilty of this, is a schismatic: and he that does thus under
pretense of coming nearer to Christ, in a purer and more refined way, while in
truth and indeed he raises up, entertaineth, or countenanceth causless
dissensions and divisions in the Church, contrary to the order of Christ, and
the rules of prudence and love, in forbearing one another, is a schismatical
hypocrite. He is a breaker of unity, under color of purity; an author of
confusion, under pretext of order; and an obstructer of charity under a show of
love: His Religion is ad oppositum, it does him good to do somewhat apart and
singular, to preach Christ out of contention Phil. 1.16.
He neither will be led nor driven, but thinks himself fitter to drive his
leader, and loves nothing, though of Christ's own appointment, that is in
fashion and use in the Church, if not of his own introducing.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true Christian endeavors to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace. Ephesians. 4.3.


He finds and feels the benefit of his prayer that is the Head, for all the
members that are his body, to the Father, that they all may be one in us, John
17.21.
and so made perfect in one. ver. 23.
Therefore he makes it his main study to be like minded with them, having the
same love, being of one accord, of one mind; Psalm. 2 2.
and, his daily care, to do nothing through strife or vain glory; ver. 3.
But, that all his things be done with charity. 1 Cor. 16.14.
By the truth of faith he cleaves unto Christ; the head, and is one spirit with
him; 1 Cor. 6.17.
by the bond of love, to all his fellow members, as one body with them. 1 Cor.
12.12.
He not only not forsakes their assemblies, Heb. 10.25.
but assembles with them, in love to them, not to irritate, but to conciliate,
and to provoke one another to love and to good works. ver. 24.
He desires and studies such a Communion with the Saints on earth, that even in
this respect, Gods will may be done on earth as it is in heaven by the spirits
of just men made perfect: and that his agreement with his fellow members here
may not only resemble, but hold some proportion with that perfect Communion he
hopes to enjoy with them in heaven. And forasmuch as he has purified his heart
in obeying the truth to unfeigned love of the brethren, he is careful to love
them all with a pure heart, fervently. 1 Pet. 1.22.
He will not separate, as the manner of too many is; no, not for what he or
others may, through pride, or prejudice, esteem a better way. And in the Church
of which he is a member, he will neither despise other members as having no
need of them, 1 Cor. 12.15, 16.
nor start out of his place by a dislocation, whereby the rest of the members
should be put to the least pain. In the place wherein he is set, he abides with
God. 1 Cor. 7.24.


He knows that where the Saints communicate in love, there the Lord commands
the blessing, even life for ever more. P^al. 133.3.
And every error in doctrine, every failing in worship, every swerving from
order is not sufficient warrant for separation, or non-communion. How then
should the Church of Corinth have come together, among whom the Apostle prayed
and desired that there might be no Schisms or divisions (a)? 1 Cor. 1.10.
He will pass by offenses which he cannot reform; love the brotherhood, (b)
partake of the Ordinances of Christ in Love, and maintain Order, Col. 2.5.
and peace, Mar. 29.50.
who ever breaks either the one or the other.

Thus this Hypocrite like Absalom, pretends reformation, but puts all into
confusion; the true Christian keeps back the paths of all breakings out by
prudent forbearance in love: the one seeks to set the Church on fire by his
zeal, the other casts water on those sparks by his love, The one makes the
paths of the Church so uneven and rough, that even the wisest can hardly walk
in them without danger of stumbling; the other covets to make them as smooth as
Solomon's Palace Cant. 9.10.
that was paved with love for the daughters of Jerusalem.

has the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ in respect of persons. Jam. 2.1.


Look what respect he bears to men's persons, such is his religion, such is his
carriage in the Church. If the place he holds there will bear it, he likes
nothing better then to act Diotrephes; 3 John 9.10.
and in all things loves and seeks to have the pre-eminence. None must be
received into the Church, either as Teachers, or Members, but whom he pleases.
None must continue in the Church, but those of his own gang. If even an Apostle
himself be not of his opinion, will not yield him the right hand, is willing
to ease the Church of such unnecessary and unwarrantable burdens as he
imposes, he will not receive or admit even St. John himself, but prate against
him with malicious words. If any of the Church have a mind to give to godly
Christians the right hand of fellowship, and to receive them as brethren,
unless he be sure they will in all things veil bonnet to him and his
opinions, say as he says, and do as he does, he will not receive them himself,
but forbids them that would; and not only so, but casts them out of the
Church as rotten members, that presume to do ought against his declared opinion
or practice, how singular or absurd soever.

If he be a private member (yet pragmatical) he will drive on his own
particular design in all his actings, and therefore if there be several
teachers within his compass, he considers who is most suitable to his private
ends, and him he cries up beyond all reason and moderation; not so much to make
him great whom he so applaudeth, as to make himself great in that applauded
man's opinion, and to wind himself the further into his affections for self
ends and advantages. And here he will cry up Paul, to derogate from Apollo; 1
Cor. 1.12.
or extol Apollo to detract from Cephas; or applaud any of these, with neglect
of Christ, as his own interest leads him; whereas these are but Ministers by
whom the Church believes. 1 Cor. 3.5.
He will consider nothing but his own advantage, according to which he has
the persons of men in admiration, 2 Pet. 2.
or contempt. 2 Cor. 10.


If a Minister never so able and godly, agree not with him in opinion or in
ordering the Church Assemblies, he is either weak, or peevish; if any of the
Church stand for him, this hypocrite is extremely disquieted: Thus those
seducing spirits in the midst of all their zealous affecting of the
Galatians, not affecting them well, that is, upon right grounds and ends, they
would exclude the Galatians, Gal. 4.17.
from the truth of the Gospel, and even from their own reason and
understanding, making very focles of them, that they might affect those
seducers, and be ready for their sakes to pluck out the eyes of Paul, for whose
sake they once would have plucked out their own, and have given them to him.
ver. 15.


Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian receives truth not for his sake that brings
it, but for the truths sake that is brought.

He looks upon Paul and Apollo, and every faithful Minister of Christ with
reverence and honor; yet, not to make them Lords of his faith, or absolute
directors in matters of worship or order in the Church, but as Ministers by
whose ministry he has believed, even as the Lord has given unto every man. 1
Cor. 3.5.
He will receive truth from the meanest servant of Jesus Christ, although he
preach the Gospel through much infirmity, Gal. 4.13.
without despising or rejecting it: but, an error, he will not willingly
swallow down, although recommended to him by an Angel from Heaven. Gal. 1.8.
If there be some disorders, he will in the spirit of meekness and humility
desire to remove them; if that cannot be, he will rather bear it with grief to
preserve peace, than oppose it with faction under color of zeal, tending to
separation, in hope that God will in time reveal that which is truth unto those
that at present are otherwise minded. He will not forsake the Assemblies of the
Saints, which cannot be left without sin, nor wanted without punishment.

Thus this hypocrites piety is but partiality; and his zeal, faction; the true
Christian observes all things prescribed of Christ, without preferring one
before another, doing nothing by partiality. The one exalts some, that he may
divide, the other is without partiality, that he may prevent division.

The Schismatical hypocrite breaks the rules of love upon pretense of
holiness.

He is very pure in his own eyes, yet not purged from his filthiness Prove.
30.12.
, and therefore has bitter envying and strife in his heart Jam. 3.14.
, which breaks out against all rules of charity. Stand apart (or stand off
says this man) for I am holier then thou Esaias 65.5
; at least as holy as any, and as meet to be a master of the Assembly. If
others exercise more authority, he sticks not to tell them, they take too much
upon them, seeing all the Congregation is holy every one of them Numb 16.3
. Thus he puts holiness to mutiny against order, peace and love all at once;
against order, by refusing to submit to it; against peace, because disorder
ever ends in confusion; and against love, because the way of peace he has not
known.

That famous Schism of the Donatists confining the Church to their African
Assemblies as the only Staple of truth and holiness; spread it self far,
and lasted long, but at length vanished. But now it is at last revived partly
in the Papists, and partly in the Separatists. The Papacy, especially as such,
is a very Schism (though not without many heresies serving to uphold that
part;) for they confine truth and holiness, Church and Christ, and all, to
that Sea of Rome. So that if we admit it the name of a Church (as a thief may
be said to be a true man) it is a very Schismatical one, that, deviating from
the one true Catholic Apostolic Church, will needs yet retain the name and
title, when for substance it is the most absolute Synagogue of Satan on this
side Hell.

For, are there not found in it Altars, against Altars, Popes against Popes at
the same time, Councels against Councels; to say nothing of Friars against
Friars, Dominicans against Franciscans, and Jesuits against both? do they not
bite and devour one another, tear and spoil one another to the utmost of
their power? Do they not cast us out of their Synagogues for not joining with
them against those very truths, which the Apostles and true Primitive Martyrs
sealed with their bloods? yea, does not Saint Peter's Vicar, kill and eat the
flesh of his own Church and members, so often as they do but touch him in his
patrimony, profits, or designs? Who is so great a stranger in Israel that he
knows not these things?

And as for Separatists among our selves; what divisions, sub-divisions and
crumblings into nothing are not found among them? First, they fall out with
parochial Congregations as not pure enough for them to join with; either the
Minister wants a lawful call, or gifts, or both; or, the worship is corrupt in
whole, or in part; or the members are unsound, or disorderly. Then among
themselves being separated, every one hauking after the glory of making or
promoting that separation, must take upon him the moulding and ordering of
their new Congregation; at which some others, as ambitious as the former,
quarrel, and find some error in that way, and if this be not reformed, away
go they and draw other disciples after them till at length they fall off from
all assemblies of the Saints, and throw off all duty. First, they rend the
Church while they continue in it, then rend themselves quite off from the
Church by separating from it.

Contrarily, the true Christian makes love a part of holiness, Differ.
and never accounts that holiness wherein love is wanting.

He knows that two things are requisite to every member of a Church that
would not walk disorderly; truth and love, salt and peace. The truth must be
spoken and held (...) truthifying, that is, sincerely and heartily holding it
forth in love to the truth and to the members also.
forth in love, thereby to grow up into him in all things, which is the head
even Christ Ephesians. 4.15.
; and this truth must be poudered with salt Mar. 9.50 Col. 4.6.
, of true wisdom and discretion that a Christian may know how he ought to
answer every man. And love must cement every joint, and cover all deformities
and imperfections that are in the joints; and so he and the rest of the members
have peace one with another. Truth is the nail that is driven by the Masters
of the Assembly; the salt of wisdom as the hammer by which that nail is
driven; and love the oil in which that nail is dipped, whereby it goes up to
the head without rending or breaking in pieces any members of the Church, into
which it is driven. In all professions there must be unity and unanimity; unity
to knit the members together; unanimity to keep them so. And as in trades, so
in the profession of godliness, men must not only be free of the same
occupation, but also members of the same corporation, and study the peace and
welfare of it. Even Satan maintains a kind of unity (or rather a conspiracy)
in his Kingdom, else it could not stand. How much more then the Kingdom of
Christ (which Satan seeks to divide that he may overthrow it) ought to study
unity as much as purity? his Church being as Jerusalem Psalm. 122.3.
, a City that is compact, not as made of many stones, but as if all were but
one stone, that it may be at unity within it self.

Thus this hypocrite sets up an holiness which may cast out peace; the true
Christian loves the truth and peace that he may promote true holiness. The one
is for dividing under a color of holiness; the other follows peace with all
men and holiness Heb. 12.14
, as verily believing that without both no man shall see the Lord.

has always a prejudice against authority.

Government, Order, Antiquity, Custom, consent of Churches, are names and
things little beholding to him. Because they may err, therefore he presumes
that they do err. With him all imparity in the Church savours of Antichristian
Policy, and pride which must be rooted out. Therefore speaks evil of dignities;
whereas Angels which are greater in power and might, bring not railing
accusation against them before the Lord 2 Pet. 2.10, 11
. Yet is it no less pride for him to think himself equal with the highest and
best, and none meet to be above him; and while he shuts pride out of one
door of order, be lets it in at another of parity. He loves (as Salmons) to
swim against the stream, till he be taken in the net. Corah and his company had
never been so bold with Moses for his civil administrations, had it not been
out of envy to Aarons mitre, and his exaltation above the rest of the Levites;
not because unlawful to be worn, whatever they pretended, but because it was on
any head but their own. He studies to know wherein he may not obey authority,
rather then wherein he may and ought to obey it; and is better pleased to find
any fault to administer matter of exception against obedience, then to find no
fault at all, or to have faults amended.

Differ.
Contrarily the true Christian honors authority, and judges favorably of
those that are in it.

He knows God to be a God of order in all the Churches of the Saints; and
that all are not one member, nor have one office in the body; all are not
Apostles, all are not Evangelists, all are not Pastors, Teachers, or helps in
Government 1 Cor. 12.28, 29.
in the Church. The several members have their several places, their several
offices in the body, which if they keep not there will be a dislocation, a
convulsion, a Schism in the body. Therefore he looks upon Government
administered according to the mind of Christ, as the Ordinance of Christ, and
obeys those that have the rule over him; submitting himself Heb. 13.17.
, not opposing of them. Those that in some things fail, he pitieth and prays
for, covering their nakedness, going backward with the garment of love, as Sem
and Japhet did that of their father Noah Gen 9.23.
. And the Elders that rule well, he accounts worthy of double honor 1 Timothy
5.17
.

Thus this hypocrite walking after the flesh, despises government 2 Pet. 2.10.
; the true Christian walking after the spirit, dares not have an undutiful
thought of his Governors; the one seeks to pull down the government to exalt
himself; the other upholds it to exalt Christ.

The Schismatical Hypocrite is a great ingrosser of the Churches Commons.

Thus that man of sin has rent away a great part of the Christian world from
the unity of Christ and his Gospel, whereof all Saints partake in common Jude 3.
, and excludes all that are not of his Synagogue, and have not his mark, from
salvation; which yet belongs to all believers, and therefore called the common
salvation Ibid.
. They ingrosse the title of Catholics, whereby they would imply both truth of
doctrine and universality of consent to be found only with them; but upon no
better grounds then the Turks arrogate the titles of Mussulmanni, that is,
Orthodox; and Islani, that is at unity. It is not his number that excuses from
Schism, no more then the ten Tribes falling off from the house of David, could
make the two Tribes that adhered thereunto guilty of that rent, and the ten
Tribes innocent. Nor is it his residence in the chief City (once the seat of
the most famous Christian Church in the world Romans 1.8.
out of which he has shouldred the Emperor, discharge him from being guilty
of the rent, no more then Caesar's usurping thereof, and forcing the Senate into
a corner could acquit him of usurping; else Caesar must be a true
Commonwealths man at Rome, and Cato and the Senate, rebels at Brandusium.

But there is nothing more absurd than to hear the papal party call themselves
the Romish Catholic Church, which two words imply a contradiction, as if one
should say, a general particular Church. Neither is there any thing more
sacrilegious then the appropriations (or impropriations rather) of that Church,
whereby they challenge to themselves as their peculiar, whatsoever glorious
things are spoken of that one Catholic militant Church, the true City of God
on earth.

And there are not none elsewhere who arrogate all purity in doctrine worship
and discipline as their own particular freehold and peculiar; making their own
opinions and administrations the only standards to weigh and measure all other
Churches by, who must all be pronounced too light at least, if not Babylonish
and Antichristian, if found to deviate from them, or not to come fully up to
them in all things: Yea, he will (if not formally excommunicate, yet) in effect
non-communion all of the same Church, and debar them the Sacraments, how sound
soever in the faith, and unblameable in conversation; if they cannot be
satisfied of the truth of grace in his heart which is invisible, and to be left
to the judgment of the searcher of hearts, where their open wickedness says
not in his heart, that there is no fear of God before their eyes, and that they
have altogether broken the yoke.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian holds communion with all wherein they communicate with
God.

As he is at unity with all mankind, not degenerated into beasts, in r^gard
of the common image of God, and with all men of honesty and civility, for the
love of humane society, as a friend to the government of God; so is he with all
that are called Christians, as upon whom the Name of the Lord is called, and
with all called to be Saints, with all that in every place call upon the Name
of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours 1 Cor. 1, 2.
, that is, with all those that profess piety, and not openly contradict it
with their lives, for the love he has to the new creature, which is the
special image of God; yea, with all those of whom there is any hope to gain
them 1 Cor. 9.22.
to acknowledgment of the truth which is after godliness Tit. 1.1.
, for love to their souls, and to the work of God in the conversion and
salvation of men.

He dares not join with Idolaters and spirits of error discovered by
Scripture, against the clear light of Evangelical truth, though the Church of
Rome count him a Schismatic for refusing her. He accounts it to be a folly and
madness to be carried with shows and pretenses of place, names, multitudes, or
titles, when the Lord Jesus himself appears as it were in the field against
those fooleries, as with the banner of the everlasting Gospel displayed, and
his sword drawn, calling all his faithful subjects to arms, and saying with
Jehu, Who is on my side, who 2 King. 9.32.
?

Nor does he account it less madness of the other side to think that we can
never go far enough from Rome, in whatever they hold or practice, and to
condemn all for Antichristian Idolatry and Popery that is to he found among
them. For the devil is not such a fool as to put his eldest son to make a total
Apostasy, but he lets him hold some truths, and practice some duties allowed of
God, the better to give countenance to the trumperies, witchcrafts, and
delusions which he has received from the Devil. Baptism the Lords Supper,
yea, the Gospel it self is not to be thrown off because held and continued by
Antichrist. Nay rather, God permits him to maintain and preserve these, that
those men who embrace true piety, may take them up and use them with more
purity, and to better purposes. He will not go further from the devil himself,
then he goes from God. He will not reject truth as error, because that father
of lies confesses it. Will any wise man deny Christ to be the holy one of God,
because the Mar. 1.24.
devil once pronounced him to be so? Will any discreet Christian throw off all
truths that the devil has taken up? Will any hate the light, because Satan
transformeth himself into an Angel of light 2 Cor 11.14
?

The wise Christian therefore separateth from Satan as Satan, from Papists as
Papists; from wicked men wherein they are wicked; from every one so far and no
further, then he separateth himself from God, as fearing the footsteps of such
separation, for that they who affect and begin it, cease not till they have
separated themselves, not only from all Religion, but common honesty.

Thus this hypocrite incloseth other men's commons and so destroys his own
benefit in the communion of Saints; the other throws open all enclosures which
may prejudice the least and weakest of Saints in the enjoying of his just
rights. The one by enclosing, excludes himself; the other by giving all their
rights, preserves his own.

The Schismatical Hypocrite pretends to much knowledge, but without judgment.

He has gotten so much eyesight as to find fault, but not so much judgment
as to discover the true way to redress it. He finds some error in the one
extreme which he opposes, but sees* not the danger and mischief in the other
extreme, which he cries up and applaudeth. He sees the mote Mat. 3 7.
in another, but not the beam nearer home. To join in evil, as in superstition,
etc. is a great sin; but therefore to separate from the superstitious in
commanded duties is an evil which he sees not. It is sin to join in
will worship; but not a duty therefore to refuse to join in true worship, be
the worshippers what they will. It is good to abhor the Popish hierachy, but
evil to fall into an absolute anarchy, and popular confusion, where every one
will be a ruler, but none willing or fit to be ruled. It is good to stick close
to the written word, even in worship and discipline, as well as in doctrine;
but not to force the holy Ghost, seeking by strained interpretations to make
him father of all our conceits. If men have a mind to be contentious (as all
Schismatics have) there will be no end of strife, especialy in things wherein
the Scriptures speak not expressly and definitively. For in things of this
nature, better have to do with an Heretic, then with a Schismatic; for
although in the Schismatic the matter of contention be of less weight, yet
the spirit of contention is greater, and the violence more strong to maintain
it.

Differ.
Contrarily, The true Christian joins to his knowledge judgment, and to both
love.

The wise man has his eyes in his head, said the wisest of men Eccl. 2.14.
, and he has his heart at his right hand Eccl. 10.2.
, while the fools heart is at his left. He can see and judge; the other sees
without judgment; the true Christian not only sees what is before him, but
what is not yet obvious to every eye. Where any Christians assemble themselves,
holding forth the truth in the main, and desire and endeavor to keep the
Ordinances of Christ free from pollution and contempt, he dares not for every
light error in judgment or practice forsake those assemblies as the manner of
some is, but rather to bear with patience, and to bewail with grief, what
through their ignorance or weakness he cannot yet reform, while there is any
hope of reformation; he can become a Jew that he may gain the Jews, 1 Cor.
9.20, 21 22.
rather then wholly to separate from them; to them that are under the Law, as
under the Law to win them; to them that are without Law, as without Law (being
not without Law to God, but under the Law to Christ,) that he might gain them
that are without Law. To the weak he becomes as weak, that he might gain the
weak. He can be made all things to all men, that he may by all means save some.
Not that he joined with the Jews in denying Christ, but conformed to what ever
was not against Christ; nor to them that are under the Law, in matter of
justification by works, but in making it the rule of his obedience to the Law
of faith; nor to them that are without Law, as a son of Belial; but as not
tying them to ought that concerned the Ceremonial Law; nor, to the weak as
humouring them in their weakness, but bearing with them in a spirit of
meekness, till of weak they become strong. If he find them headstrong in
passion where weakest in judgment; he does not knock them down with violence,
but overcome them by patience, as skilful fishers do the strongest fishes, not
vexing them with doing before them what he knows they cannot away with, but
rather forbearing his own liberty, then offend their weak consciences 1 Cor. 8
13.
. And all this he does for the Gospels sake, that he may be partaker thereof
with them 1 Cor. 9.23.
.

Thus this Hypocrite is as the bird-eyed horse, that takes notice of every
thing that may cause him to start, and to endanger his rider; the other is as a
sober man that is not frighted with shadows, nor flies off for trifles; the one
knows nothing as he ought to know, for lack of judgment; but the other being
spiritual, judges all things 1 Cor. 2.15.
.

The Schismatical Hypocrite is all for things, but nothing for the right
timeing of

As the State Hypocrite is wholly an observer of times, ordering things to the
times to promote his own interest by both, so the Schismatical Hypoctite is all
for unseasonable pressing of things, without any consideration of times. This
man knows not his time, and so by unseasonable putting on of things in an
unseasonable time, himself is snared, and he seeks to ensnare others, in an
evil time Eccl. 9.12.
. He would have the Church in all things so ordered now, as in the Apostles
time; not only for doctrine and worship, but for all circumstances then taken
up for necessity to avoid persecutions; (which might be avoided without
prejudice to the Gospel, as things then stood, as in the case of Paul's
purifying Act. 21.23, 24
, and sundry other incidents:) Then, the Magistrate meddled not with matters of
Religion, unless to persecute it, and the Christians never appealed to them,
unless in criminal causes, and cases contrary to the Laws of the Empire Act.
25.9, 10, 11.
; therefore now, the Magistrate must have nothing to do in matters of Religion,
no more then Gallio, who, to avoid the being a Judge in such matters, cared not
for the contempt done to his authority as a Civil Judge, before his face at the
judgment seat it self Act. 18.14, etc
, which this hypocrite by his principle must needs justify, and cries up as an
excellent resolution in a Christian Magistrate; albeit the Spirit of God brands
him upon record as a most profane wretch, for so doing, to all posterity.

Thus he thinks that the command to come out of Babylon Rev. 18.4.
, extends to all times and seasons, for going not only from Rome, but from all
that retain any thing which he calls Romish, whether truly Babylonish or not;
and that the least offense given or taken, is warrant sufficient to make a rent
in the Church, and to prefer a mischief before an inconvenience; which however
it may in some cases hold in the Laws of men, yet is ever sinful and dangerous
in the things of God, where notwithstanding the inconvenience, Christ may be
had and enjoyed, as in Corinth, notwithstanding the many offenses there given
to such as were truly godly, in the matter of the Lords Supper it self 1 Cor.
11.
, as well as in other things; and yet even there Paul would have no Schism 1
Cor. 1.10.
; and that considering the times, wherein many things must be born, for want of
power and opportunity to reform them.

Contrarily, the true Christian wisely considers the times and seasons,
Differ.
as well as things.

He is as much in truth and in deed for an absolute and complete reformation as
any Schismatic in the world; yea more, for he will omit no season by which it
may be promoted; whereas the other, for want of taking the due season, is sure
to prevent the doing of what he pretends, and to bring in the mischief of a
rent and confusion, instead of a true reformation. If he live in an age wherein
an Asa 2 Chr. 15.9, etc
, an Hezekiah chapter 30.1, 2, 3, etc.
, or a Josiah (h) reigns, that will cause the people to worship the true God
in the right order and manner, ch 34.32, etc.
and under whom the house of God is by their care and zeal thoroughly purged,
and that the righteous flourish, and are exalted; He will then apprehend it to
be a fit season for him to appear (within his own rank and sphere) to remove
the very least disorders, and be as forward as any to purge out whatsoever does
offend; and 1 These. 5.2 2.
to abstain from all appearance of evil, purging out the old leaven, that all
may be a new lump Jude 23.
, saving (such as need it) with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating the
very garment spotted with the flesh 1 King. 12 32 33.
.

But if God let a Jeroboam reign, to ordain Feasts, Altars, Sacrifices and
Priests devised of his own heart 1 King. 12 32 33.
; making the lowest of the people Priests, and suffering whosoever would be
consecrated to become one of the Priests for his high places chap. 13.33.
; Or if a profane Gallio be at the helm, who cares not what Religion men
profess Act. 18.13, 14
. Then indeed he accounts it wisdom especially if a private Christian, to lie
hid as much as he can, as those seven thousand in Ahabs time; and to keep
silence in that time, because it is en evil time Amos 5.13.
; unless where God by his providence calls him out to bear witness to the
truth, so as either he must deny the truth, or suffer for it. In this case, he
rejoices in being a partaker of Christ's sufferings 1 Pet. 4.13.
.

And even Ministers of Christ who at sometimes must not count their lives dear
unto them Acts 20.24.
, but be partakers of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of
God 2 Timothy 1.8.
; at another time, if they be persecuted in one City, they may and ought to
flee into another Mat. 10.23.
; when it is to reserve themselves for better times, to do more and greater
service unto Christ. Then Paul and his company at Ephesus, will not expressly
and openly inveigh against Diana Acts 19.37
when it may raise tumults to the hazard of the Gospel, and the ruin of those
few that in that City received it: Yea when it may advantage him for his
preservation from present mischief, and unto future service, he dares profess
himself a Pharisee Acts 23.6.
, so far as the Pharisees held the truth, viz. touching the point of the
resurrection of the dead, and the acknowledgement of Angels and Spirits, which
the Saduces denied, and the Pharisees confessed Ver. 8.
.

Thus the Schismatical hypocrite observes not his time, and thereby destroys
what he seeks to build; the true Christian knows his time, and so serves
Christ and saves himself: the one unseasonably venteth his passion, to the
prejudice of Religion; the other seasonably shows his prudence to the advantage
of the truth.

The Schismatical hypocrite is zealous, but out of his element.

This is the fountain of Schism, the arrogating of that to a man's self which
belongs not to him, with contempt of others whom they ought to honor. This
hypocrite thinks he does nothing, if he keep within his own line. If he dares
not execute the Magistrates office, for fear of a praemunire; yet he will be
ever finding fault with the Magistrate, if himself may not do what he list in
contempt of Laws, and cry out, persecution, when his own folly causes the
stripes to fall upon his fools back; or; that the Magistrate wants courage and
zeal, if in all things (though never so unwarrantable and senseless) that he
would put the Magistrate upon. He thinks so well of himself, that he believes
himself able to govern his Governors, and to rule his Rulers; and to be, if
not a Magistrate, yet a reformer even of Magistracy it self, and of all that
execute it. He is like an ill manned colt that takes the bit in his teeth, and
runs away with his Rider, and never leaves running (unless stopped by force)
till he has cast him.

And as for the Ministers office, this Corah and his accomplices will make more
bold, not only to reprehend, but usurp it. For doting on his own conceited
gifts, he makes no bones to become a Teacher cf the Law, understanding neither
what he says, nor whereof he affirms 1 Timothy 1.8
; even before he has learnt his Catechism, and while he has need that one
teach him again the first principles of the Oracle of God Heb..12.
, having need of milk and not of strong meat.

And even in these extravagancies, if you observe his strain and temper of
carrying them on, his wine is all turned into vinegar, which (without any oil)
he poures into the wounds of his brethren; yea, of his betters whom he ought
not to mention without reverence and honor. He entertaineth irreverent
opinions, and utters contemptible words of authority, and dislikes men the
more, by how much their places require more respect and observa^ce: which is
one of the Characters that no less than two Apostles give of him Jude 8. 2
Pet. 2.10.
. He thinks a private man may execute the office either of Magistrate or
Minister, or at least direct and overruled them in it.

He uses Religion, as men loving contention make use of the Law, that is, to
make it a cudgel to break other men's heads (although many times with the ruin
of themselves) not as a means to reduce and reclaim them. His zeal is more
against persons then corruptions; and if against corruptions, it is for the
persons; sake and he is against the persons for their places sake; not simply,
but because he may not have them, who in his own opinion is more worthy of
them. First, he falls out, and then hunts to find out some fault to warrant
his quarrelling; and (as the Donatists of old) is more glad to find a fault
then to see it amended, and to proclaim then to cover it, to carp then to cure
it, and is unwilling the color of evil speaking should be taken away.

There is no duty which he practices so much as reprehension, none that he
more abuses in the practice of it. In reprehending, he sets by the spirit of
meekness, and forgets all reverence: He knows not how to entreat an Elder as a
Father, but rather as Shemei reviled David to his face, as his slave. He cannot
speak of authority, but with slighting; or of Ministry, but with contempt.

And as himself is, so he seeks to make his associates and disciples, whom by
perverse speakings he can draw after him. He makes his choice among the meaner
sort of people, who are soonest deluded, and most violent after engagement; for
they being least able to judge, are soonest flattered into a high conceit of
their own sufficiency, and so are the fittest timber whereof he seeks to erect
his frame, as being most apt to envy others above them, and most heady and
furious in faction against those whom they envy; contrary to the Papist, who
delights to deal most with the rich and noble, who are ablest to pay the best
price for their salvation, and to help him to bear rule by their means.

Contrarily, the sober Christian measures his duty by his place. Differ.


As he forsakes not his calling, so he exceeds not his bounds in that calling.
He can heartily reverence the Magistrate for his place, even when he mourns for
his failings and corruptions He gives place to authority, as a power ordained
of God Romans 13.2
; though not to build faith upon; yet to keep order, and to be the Minister of
God for his good. He knows that God is a God of order, and has appointed to
each member his proper office, as well as place in the body; and that the least
dislocation of any member, is both troublesome and dangerous to the whole body.
His main care therefore in reference to the community, is, that there may be no
Schism in the body 1 Cor 12.25.
, even by the least incroachment, or usurpation upon those above him, or
contempt, or slighting of those below him.

Thus, this hypocrite delights most to be eccentrick, the true Christian keeps
within his own sphere; the one loves to play the Bishop in another man's
Diocese, as a busy body in other men's matters 1 Pet. 4.15.
, the other studies to be quiet and to do his own business 1 These. 4.11.
.

This Hyp crite is soon ripe, all fire on the sudden.

He is no sooner a Professor, but a great zealot; and presently espies great
faults, many corruptions and impure mixtures, which never any man but himself
saw before, in the Church whereof he is a member: Schism is like a contagious
disease that seizes most on the best complexions. A man must have some show of
knowledge and zeal before he be a Schismatic, although such an one knows
nothing as he ought to know 1 Cor. 8.2.
; yet so soon as he thinks he knows any thing, he will be correcting
reforming and censuring as many as come in his way, and seeking to cast out
brethren for the Lords Name sake, supposing and saying that thereby the Lord
will he glorified Esaias 65.5.
, and that because he thinks himself holier then they, and that God must needs
own anything that he does.

Popery indeed delights to meet with men either grossly ignorant, whom her
Agents may lead by the nose; or, openly profane, that never made conscience of
any thing; giving then not only liberty, but temptations to any wickedness;
and, the grosser, the better for their purpose, that afterward they may
confess them with greater advantage to themselves: first, they debauch, then,
confess them, that so they may afterward fleece them to better purpose. But
Schism must have her disciples a knowing people, that is, in conceit, and in
the estimate they raise of themselves, that so they may sooner serve the devil
by making rents and divisions so soon as this piece of new cloth is sowed to
the old.

He is like a mushrome, up in a night; or, as the Caterpiller, engendered of the
East wind on the sudden. If Satan can but blow into him the spirit of
presumption, you shall soon find this turned into a spirit of contradiction and
contention, censuring others contemning of superiors; and then, exit
Schismaticus, Out he goes a Schismatic in grain to vex all where ever he
comes; no great need of solid knowledge; so there be a show of it; less of
judgment, so he may be judge; least of all the denial of himself, of which he
is now an admirer. So that it is no marvel to find a Schismatic to be formed
and fashioned in a night, and next morning in arms, like the brood of Cadmus
his Serpent.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian grows up by degrees, and walks on toward
perfection by sober steps.

He is not all upon the spur, but puts a strong bridle upon his headstrong
passions, that he may make no more have then good speed. He is fruitful, but
not before his time, He is like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
brings forth his fruit in his season Psalm. 1.3.
; or like the wheat in the field, that though it grow up, he knows not how
Mar. 4.27, 28
; for the manner; yet for the measure the earth brings forth, first the blade,
then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear, which is not done on the
sudden, but the husbandman waits and has long patience for it 1 Pet. 5.7.
; Or he is like the child in the womb, begotten at once, but the several parts
are formed by degrees in time, and afterward perfected for birth and living in
the world; So is every one that is born of God, he comes on by leasurely steps,
and when he has gone as far as he can, plus ultra is his word; there is yet
much to which he has not attained Phil. 3.1 2.
. His knowledge is not by him held to be ripe, till it be seasoned with a sound
judgment; his understanding not right till it be poysed by prudence; his zeal
not qualified, till it be allayed with humility and meekness.

Well may we wait and give time to the forming of such a piece; well may we
enquire and search with the Apostle? James 3.13
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge, let him show out of a good
conversation, his works with meekness of wisdom.

Thus, this Hypocrite makes more have then good speed, the sincere Christian
makes better speed then have; the one by impetuous violence destroys what he
pretends to build; Cunctando restituit rem.
the other by seeming to be more slow, more speedily attains his end. The one
is as a flash of lightning, that makes way for thunder; the other as the
shining light, that shines more and more unto the perfect day Prove. 4.18.
.

CHAP. XI. The Superstitious Hypocrite. Is he that through groundless fear
worshippeth God according to the fancies of man. Defin.

EVen in the midst of ungodliness not come to the height of Atheism, there
is in all men some impression of a Godhead, which is clearly understood, and
manifested by the things that are made. Romans 1.20.
The apprehension of a God, calls for worship: But, want of true knowledge of
God, breeds a servile fear; and the not understanding what worship he
requires, makes men (ignorant of both) to set up an Idol of their own brain
in the room of God; and, through fear to prosecute him with a worship of their
own: both which make up superstition, of which the superstitious hypocrite is
molded and formed.

All ungodliness divides it self into two maine channels, Atheism, and
Superstition: and, in one of these streams all the Sons of Adam, alienated
from the life of God, Ephesians. 4.18.
are continually swimming and dabling. Atheism denies God, either in opinion,
saying there is no God: Psalm. 14.1.
or, in affection, wishing there might be none: Isai. 30.11.
or, in conversation, living as if there were none, Tit. 1.16.
Supersition is little better, for albeit it acknowledge God, yet knows him
not, makes an Idol of him; and then, gives him what best pleases it self, and
takes from him what is best pleasing to him; not out of love to serve him, but
out of fear of mischief from him.

Hence some Etymologize superstition, quasi supra statutum, a thing beyond
Statute, or Rule: that is, as the Greek word imports (...).
, a servile and preposterous fear of an imaginary God, which the true God
neither enjoys, allows, or regards. Hence some learned Plut. (...).
(among the Heathens) who knew not the true God, nor his true worship, place
superstition, not so much in the matter or form of worship, as in the degree
and excess of fear which is vain and unwarrantable. Nor is this all: for,
this fear produces sundry errors in worship; fear disposing or rather
forcing to a worship, but not showing how. Hence the superstitious person
inventeth and uses sundry ceremonies and rites of his own head, or takes them
up by tradition in the worship of God; accounting himself so much more
religious than others, by how much his brain is more firtile, and his hand more
active in such kind of ceremonies and worship as best pleases his fancy, with
greater fear and more show of zeal then appears in others who knowing the
unwarrantablenesse and folly of them, cannot but slight and abhor that in
which he places all his devotion.

Thus the affrighted Philistines, by the counsel of their Priests and Diviners,
1 Samuel 6.2, 3, etc.
offered five golden Emerods, and five golden Mice to the God of Israel,
according to the number of the Lords of the Philistines, as a trespass
offering for making to bold with his Ark, when themselves had been smitten with
Emerods, 1 Samuel 5.12.
and many with death; thinking by this means to escape further evils. And upon
no better account did the Athenians erect an Altar, (...), to the unknown God
Act. 17.22, 23.
; hoping by unwarranted sacrifices to appease, and pacify his anger breaking
out upon them.

Yea, to come nearer to our purpose, the Israelites themselves were too sick of
this malady in the midst of their highest formal devotions, having their
fear toward him taught by the precepts of men Isai. 29.13.
, whereby the Hypocrite abuses and affronteth God instead of worshipping and
honoring him. For, whereas God is a Spirit, and will be worshipped in Spirit
and in Truth John 4.24.
the Superstitious Hypocrite, in stead of truth, sets up his own seeming
wisdom (wherewith shall I come before the Lord, etc. Mic. 6.6.
) as if God had left him in the dark: and, for Spirit, a natural blind
devotion, rather fearing in excess, than loving God in any tolerable measure;
not so much hoping for help, as desiring to be freed from hurt.

Naturally, men (not wholly given over to a reprobate sense) affect to be
religious: but no man by nature is rightly devout. The Atheist indeed naturally
fights against natural conscience, when once he has maliciously fought against
God; and so becomes worse then the worst nature could make him. But the
superstitious person is far more dangerous in the consequent and issue, because
he makes God to be what he is not, and the creature to be what it is not,
putting upon God his own superstitious fancies as true worship: and gives rules
to others to do the like. An Atheist for the most part hurts but one, or few,
with his opinion: but the Superstitious lays a foundation of abomination for
many generations. Jeroboams Calves held all the Kings of Israel fast in the
cords of the same sin. If men be plucked out of the pit of Atheism, they will
easily be persuaded to climb the high places of superstition, as delighting to
go from one extreme to another, without taking the mean in their way, as
Plutarch In Numa and Live. li. 1.
observes in Tullus Hostilius; and as we have daily experience in godless men,
who of Atheistical livers turn Popish zealots in an instant, it being an easy
conversion from no religion to a false, whereby they become twofold more the
children of hell than they were before.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian worshippeth God in spirit and truth, John
4.24.
without the fear Luke 1.74.
of man.

He consults not with flesh and blood, how or wherewith to worship him who is a
Spirit: but takes notice what God himself has showed him, and what the Lord
requires of him Mic. 6.6.
, and keeps only to that.

His fear is Gods, not man's. He fears God truly, because he is taught of God
how to fear him, and fears none but God in the things of God. Fear of God in
him is as the true Serpent of Moses that devoured all the counterfeits of the
Magitians; for it is coupled with love to God, which casts out all false
fears 1 John 4.18.
. He fears God, none more, or so much: but it is a godly fear joined with
true reverence; both which produce an acceptable obedience: For, he serves God
acceptably, with reverence and godly fear Heb. 12.28.
. His heart is devoted to the fear of God Psalm. 119.38.
, not which is after the precepts of men, but according to the Commandment of
the everlasting God, who teaches not only whom to fear, but how to fear him
Psalm. 34.^1.
. And, from that slavish fear of this Hypocrite he is graciously delivered by
him which is his fear Luke 1.74.
, partly by faith, which teaches him his duty, and the rule to perform it,
whereupon he does it not out of fear to be hurt, but out of hope to be
accepted and blessed: and partly by Love, which cannot dwell with so dismal a
companion as slavish fear, and therefore expels it (as light does darkness)
not only as unworthy of harbor, but as an enemy to true piety under a specious
veil of devotion.

He knows that however false gods be good fellows, and care not how many we
worship, so themselves be not left out, and be content with any worship (as the
Devil from Christ Matthew. 4.9.
), so they may have some; yet the true God is more jealous, and admits neither
of fellows, nor so much as of worship that is not of his own prescribing for
manner Isai. 1.12.
as well as for matter Mat. 25, 9.
. Therefore he regulates his devotion by the standard of the Scriptures,
casts out slavish fear as an enemy to godliness, and as the mother and womb
of all superstition.

Thus, this Hypocrite serves God out of a false fear, without love: the truly
devout Christian fears him out of love. The one is satisfied, if to be rid of
his fear, he serves any God, in any manner; the other to show his love,
worshippeth the true God in the right way only. The one (like Darius who would
have parted Asia) is content to divide with God, to be rid of his fear; he
other (as Alexander that would have all or none,) resolves against all division
between God and man.

The superstitious hypocrite observes and serves the creature more than the
Creator Romans 1.25.
.

Superstition is a large field containing whatsoever is taken from God, and
given to the Creature under pretense of serving God more exactly. He will
worship Angels Col. 2.18.
that thereby he may seem more devoutly to worship God. He will in a voluntary
humility, worship Saints, under color of being more humble in his addresses to
God by them. Ignorant he is of the true God, and his ignorance makes him abound
in superstition, even until he rise up at last to gross Idolatry, if not
stopped in his course by instruction touching the nature of the true God, and the
true worship of God.

He seems in his profession to abhor Idolatry, yet naturally falls into it
ere he be aware, even when he thinks himself furthest off from it. For he that
pretends to worship God otherwise then himself has prescribed, worshippeth
not God, but gives a will worship to some other thing that is not God, but a
god of his own making, whether through a false notion of the mind, as sometimes
Saint Augustine conceived of the God head, as of a Globe of fire; Aug. Confess.
or, through a false representation, as Aaron, under the similitude of a calf.
Exodus 32.5.
And toward such a God, he is very devout, while that which he worshippeth is
not God, but his own vain fiction and opinion.

To speak here of the innumerable superstitions found among heathens without
the pales of the visible Church, upon which they engraffed all their
Idolatries, Divinations, Incantations, Adjurations, Sorceries, and other
abominable practices, is out of our line at this time; we being now upon the
sent of an hypocrite within the Church, whose religion is little other then
mere superstition: Nor shall I pursue all the superstitious fopperies of that
Schismatical Synagogue of Satan, the pretended Church of Rome: for we are now
hunting of those closer hypocrites among our selves that profess departure
from Babylon, and make great shows of devotion, which yet is nothing else but a
mask for their more close and subtle superstition.

He is a great Devoto; but, wherein? If the creature command any thing in
worship; as, cringing, or ducking to an Altar, observing of meats, or days,
or forms: No man shall go beyond him, or reach him. A Saints day is more
religiously observed than the Lords Sabbath; a Surplice more carefully put on,
than the New man: the Letany more devoutly attended, than the most
soul-piercing Sermon. He can better away with a Crucifix, than with a discourse
against that superstition. He is more afraid of an Hare crossing his way, than
of an Harlot in his bed: more troubled at a salt falling toward him, than of
the guilt of sin lying heavy upon him. He sets up some Saint in Heaven as
an over potent favorite in grossing both the graces of the Prince, and the
privileges of the Subject. With him the blessed Virgin is above her Son, if
not to command him, yet to do feats in heaven, more than faith in the heart,
to prevail with him. Images and pictures are unto him better instructers then
the written word, and greater helps to his devotion then the Gospel of Christ.
An Image, an Ephod, and a Teraphim Hos. 3.4.
are all one to him that respects not truth so much as blind devotion. If be
have them, he is never the better; but, if he want them, farewell his Religion.

With him the Stars, who were set for signs and seasons of things natural,
are made more surely prophetical and predictionary, than the Prophets of God
that decry those fooleries: he can gather more things future, contingent, and
voluntary, from the Stars, than from the Scriptures, touching the sad
providence that may befall him or others for sin. He ascribes more to Hali
than to Paul: he can tell you more what weather is likely to be, from the
observation of Saint Swithines day, the twelve days of Christ-tide, the
Conversion of Paul, or of the Thursday before the change of the Moon, than he
is able to discern of the Kingdom of God, even when Christ himself is
preached unto him Luke 12.56.
. And thus, as common people use to be more favorable in their opinions to
Empericks and Wizzards, than to the solid Physician (observing when they hit,
and dissembling, when they miss;) so this hypocrite will plead more for those
senseless and absurd rules and predictions of Astrologers, Calculators of
nativities, Figure-casters, and other impostors, even when God has frustrated
the tokens of those liars, and made those diviners mad Isai. 44.25.
; than he will for the Scriptures themselves, which he makes use of no
otherwise than the Heretic, who learnes the Devils lesson out of Gods Book. A
judgment from the Stars, as he calls it, is of more weight with him, than
the judgment of him that made them against such judgments.

Nor will he set out of Dreams neither, (which always give wings to fools,)
but is a greater observer of dreams, (in the multitude of which there are many
vanities Eccles. 5.7.
); than of what he does or may see without spectacles in the waking Word
against filthy dreams Jude 8.
. For, as in old time, when the written Word was not complete, God sometimes
spoke by dreams, not to make men superstitious, but more holy Job 33.15.
; the Devil who is Gods ape, too often mingled himself with dreams; so he does
still, to increase superstition among men, as Gregory the Great well observed,
that he may the better delude man in his sleep whom he thinks not enough to
ride in the day; and many times suggesteth that in the night, which he cannot
make good in the day: So that this hypocrite had need of those two gates which
the Poets Homer (...). virg. Aenead. 6.
fained to be set up for sleep; one of horn for true dreams; and another of
Ivory for the false. Yet all would be too little to show this dreamer, which
came through the Horn, and which through the Ivory: Seeing such dreamers are
given up to strong delusions to believe a lie, which they love, instead of the
truth wherein they have no delight.

Yea, this devout hypocrite is not without his Charms and Spells sometimes:
but, as those wretched Exorcists in Popery, make use of Oil, Salt, Spittle,
etc. (even in the Sacrament of Baptism,) and of holy water, and crosses, to
drive away Devils; So this hypocrite fears not to use, apply, and repeat
words or sentences of Scripture, either pronounced or written, for cures of
diseases in man and beasts. And for chasing of evil spirits from houses and
other places. In all which the devil is content to be at command, that he
maymore surely take all such silly birds in his net, and make them his own for
ever.

To which may be added, fond adjurations by the creatures, by which he puts
them in the place and office of God, calling them in to be witnesses of truth
and avengers of perjury. But what a folly, yea madness is it for a man bearing
upon him the Image of God, and the Name of Christ, to swear by this fire, this
light, this bread, etc! as if those inanimate creatures were able to judge of
truth and falsehood, and had a commission from God so to do. Wherefore as
Lactantius sometimes proved Jupiter to be no god, because he swore by Stix, or
Hell: So may we argue such superstitious hypocrites to be less then men; or at
least then true Christians, because they swear by things inferior to
themselves, contrary to the good old rule, He that swears, swears by the
greater Heb. 6.16.
. Of the same nature were all those Oaths (forbidden by our Lord Mat. 5.34, 35
), by the Heavens, the Earth, by Jerusalem, by their Heads, etc. and
especially those superstitious Oaths by the Temple Mat. 23.16, etc.
or the Gold of the Temple; by the Altar, and the gift that is upon it; like
those of the superstitious Papists, by the Mass, by Saint Mary, Saint Peter,
Saint Paul, all which the superstitious hypocrite frequently uses with as
much, yea with more veneration and reverence, then he does the glorious Name of
the blessed God himself.

Differ.
On the contrary, the truly devout Christian observes and uses the creatures
in that rank and place which is due unto them.

He neither carelessly slighteth them, nor superstitiously stands in awe of
them, nor immeasurably dotes upon them out of a fond opinion that they will, or
can do for him what superstitious minds conceit of them. He suffers not his
corrupt reason blinded with superstition, to imagine, or create unto it self a
forbidden use of the creatures, but searches to what office God has ordained
them, and what use it is that God himself has allowed us to make of them; and
there he stays.

He dares not worship Angels, when he understands them to be his fellow
servants Rev. 19.10.
, (although of a higher rank Psalm. 8.5.
); yet, as being taught of God so to do, he can honor them; and praise God for
them, as appointing them to be his guard while he lives Psalm. 91 11 Heb. 1.14.
, and his convoy to heaven Luke 16 22
when he dies. He is careful not to shame 1 Cor. 11.10.
or weary them while they attend him. He goes on in his ways appointed him of
God, that they may conduct and preserve him Genesis 24.7.32.1.
; not, out of that way, least they come as adversaries Numb. 22.22
against him. He propounds them as patterns of obedience, to do Gods will on
earth, as they in heaven Mat. 6.10.
. He dares not oppose the least of Gods little ones, as knowing their Angels do
always behold the face of God in heaven Mat. 18.10
, and will find a means to requite it. He learneth of them to esteem highly of
the work of grace where ever he discerns it, because therein the Angels are so
greatly delighted Luke 15.10
. Finally, he rejoices much the more in his Christian condition and communion,
in that he is hereby admitted to fellowship with such glorious companions Heb
12.22
; yea, whereby he is in Christ Heb. 2.16.
; exalted above them; not to puff him up, or to debate them, but the more, on
both sides to lift up Christ above all.

Touching Saints departed, how glorious soever, he dares not apply to them as
Mediators to pray for him, because he finds that Abraham himself, the father
of the faithful is ignorant of us Esaias 63.16.
; and of our condition on earth, and Israel knows us not, as discerning how
it is with us. He honors the Prophets, but abhors to erect glorious
Sepulchers Mat. 24.29, etc.
to their memories, and yet hate their virtues, and persecute them in their
successors; but his main care is, when he mentions them with honor, to
imitate their graces, Heb. 12.1
and to bless God for the benefit of their examples Gal. 1.24.
.

And as for other creatures, he will not set those above him whom God has put
under his feet Psalm. 8.6.
; but only make them the matter of his praise unto God, that the Lord may
rejoice in his works Psalm. 104.31
. He admireth Gods goodness in making them for him, and uses them to his
glory 1 Cor. 10.31
, that while he has the use, God may have the praise Romans 14.6.
. He is careful not to add to their bondage Romans 8 21, etc
, by nourishing that corruption that subjected them to vanity, but learns of
them to sigh for a full deliverance.

He makes not only an ordinary use of them in moderation for natural
necessities, and lawful refreshings, but also a spiritual, and a sabbatical use
Psalm. 19 1.92.4, 5.
of them, therein to behold the glory of God the Creator of them.

Finally, if he be subject to dreams, he does not thereby take upon him to
prophecy future events, but improves them to present use. He hunts not for
revelations by them, but observes thereby (in a profitable way) his
complexion, state of health, or, as critical observations in sickness. He
takes notice by them of his special inclinations to special lusts and
corruptions, because in sleep nature erects her self more freely without
restraint, and so he takes them (as Joseph) as warnings, not what shall
inevitably beside him, though he do what he can to prevent it, but to avoid
what lusts are in him, or evils before him, to prevent the mischiefs that
otherwise are sure to fall upon him; yea he makes use sometimes of false fears,
and of groundless apprehensions, to become unto him profitable cautions.

Thus, the superstitious hypocrite, because he believes every word, except that
of God; sets the creature, to whom he makes himself a slave, above God whom he
believes not; the devout Christian sets up God in whom alone he believes,
above the creature, which is but vanity, and a lie, beyond what truth it self
speaks of it. The one believes the worst of God, and therefore flies to the
creature; the other believes the best of God, and therefore depends wholly on
the Creator.

This Hypocrite is then most devout, when he has most of his own will in his
devotions.

Superstition is rightly called will worship Col. 2.23.
, because by its good will, it would have no other worship. Humane invention is
the grand Magazine of all superstition, and man's own will, the master of it.
This hypocrite will like no way but of his own choosing Esaias 66.3.
, and in that his soul delights, how abominable soever. He will choose that
in which God delights not Verse 4.
. Let him but go to Bethel or Gilgal, he shall bring his sacrifices every
morning, and what not? for this likes him well Amos 4.4, 5.
.

This is the true reason why all superstitions are so greedily embraced, so
strenously asserted, not only by the devisers, but by the receivers also,
because proceeding from one humane root, and principle which in one man
answers to another, as in water face answers to face Prove. 27.19.
. Here no pains will be thought too great, no cost too much, if a man may come
before the Lord, and bow himself before the most high God, with the invention
of his own brain, and the result of his own heart Micah 6 6, 7.
.

Yea, he will not stick at things required of God, so he may have his mind in
the doing of them, at least in the manner and inward affections. He will fast,
afflict his soul, so he may but find pleasure Esaias 58.3, 4.
, in seeking his own will and ends, and keep his old sins. They are willing to
do what God would have them, so they may do it when themselves please, although
then he forbid it. The Israelites Number. 14.1, 2
that were cowards below the meanest faith, when God bad them march, were
forward enough, beyond all reason, to rush on upon forewarned danger, after God
had forbidden them V. 40, 41, etc
. Thus as some self-willed servants will work hard when they have their own
minds, although otherwise idle enough when commanded to do things in their
masters way; so will this hypocrite take great pains to serve God, as he
himself lists.

Upon this ground it is that Popery finds so many friends, so many Devoto's.
because it is a religion suitable to carnal reason, grateful to sense, framed to
please the natural^ man that is apt to superstition, and fitted to every
disposition. If a man be loose, there are dispensations; if strict and austere,
there be not only rules, but orders of perfection (such as it is;) if a man be
carried with shows; there is more then a Theatrical pomp, if any be otherwise
affected, there is a counterfeit simplicity and beggarly rudeness in their
Cappuchins and sundry others among them. If he be taken with doctrines that are
the children of men's brains, and the figments of men, there is that which will
please him, free will, merit, works of superirrogation, any thing to gratify
proud flesh that loves to be its own Savior. Glosses are preferred before the
Text, and the sense of the Church leads captive the sense of the holy Ghost:
the Statutes of Omri are more heeded then the Law of God; the definitions of
Popes are more religiously embraced than the principles of the Gospel. Gods
express will and authority is confronted with pretended antiquity; Scripture
rules, with custom. And here the superstitious mole will dig to choose; and,
(as those people of old thought they might safely err, or rather that they
could not err, with Aaron no not in worshipping a calf instead of God)
confidently concludes that it is better to err with Rome, than to be in the
right with Zion: and he more willingly (although very dangerously) enquires
what others do in Gods service, that he may bear himself upon his neighbors;
then keep close to what God plainly and peremptorily forbids, or commands in
his word.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true worshipper is best pleased when he comes up nearest
to Gods will with renouncing of his own.

As is his birth and original, so is his life and contentment, the Christian
acts as he is principled of God, as the men of the world speak and do what they
have seen with their father, so he speaks and does what he has seen with his
Father John 8.38.
. He is born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of man, but of God
John 1.13,
. Therefore he is for Gods will, not man's; Privation is as necessary a
principle of regeneration, as of generation, whereby not only inferior
concupiscence or sensuality, but reason, and the reasonable appetite, the will
comes to be denied, and opinion mortified. Philosophy says, know thy self; but
Christianity, deny thy self Luke 9.23.
: He cannot truly say as a good subject, thy Kingdom come, that says not in
truth, not mine, but thy will be done Luke 22.42.
.

Christ's army, as that of Barak Judge. 5.1.
, consists all of voluntaries P^al. 110.3.
: yet subject, and are called the chariots of Aminadab: that is, of my willing
people. Reason and Will are principal, as in humane, so in divine actions; but
not with like liberty. For here, reason must assent, but not invent; prove, and
approve, but not reprove; apply the rule, but not be the rule. Will must
subscribe, not prescribe. Reason must be the disciple of faith to believe what
God promises; Will, the handmaid of obedience to do what God requires. He
says, let God be true, and every man a liar Romans 3 4.
; he gives due honor to antiquity, authority, universality, as under God, for
God, with God, but in no case against him.

Thus, the one offers God a will worship, the other a willing worship: the
one serves God according to his own heart, the other with his heart. The one
ad placitum, at his own pleasure no man reproving or restraining his
forwardness; the other according to the will of God, but pleasing to none else;
nature ever distasting, men opposing, and Satan resisting what God in his
wisdom enjoyneth.

This hypocrite holds not the head Col. 2.19.
.

While he pretends to be a great servant of Christ, yet a slave to the world;
He lets go Christ, yea opposes and excludes him, by cleaving to what is
contrary to him. As he that is a friend to the world; in the guises, fashions
and cursed practices of it, is an enemy to God Jam. 4 4
; so he much more that follows the world in the things of God, must needs be an
enemy to Christ. What is free will but the ground of merit? and what is merit
by works, but an enemy to the righteousness of God which is by faith? He that
will be his own Savior, although but in part, must needs give him the lie that
says, besides me there is no Savior Esaias 43.11
. He that will take of the honor of his merit, and sole intercession, and give
it to Saint or Angel, must not think by a complement of per Jesum Christum,
through Jesus Christ, at the end of his prayer, to hold Christ the head, whom
in this practice of his he denies; for either he thinks Christ not as willing
as Saints or Angels, or not sufficient of himself without them, to help and
supply him, whereby he gives the lie to him that said, Heb. 7.25
He is able to save to the uttermost all th^se that come unto God by him,
seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them. He therefore that honors
the members with praying to them, loses the head whose honor alone this is,
to be prayed unto. He pleads for works in the matter of justification, and so
opposes grace in God, by which we are freely justified Romans 3.24
as much as he that pleads against works as not necessary to a justified person
(for that which is of works is not by grace, and that which is of grace is not
by works, Romans 11.6
and therefore such an one cannot hold the head, by whom alone this grace is
communicated and conveyed to all the sons of faith.

He will have the will to be as free to good as to evil; if not by nature, yet
by common and universal grace purchased by Christ, whereby every man equally
now may be saved if he will, therefore he cannot hold the head, who says, I
will have mercy on whom I will have mercy Romans 9.15.
; and that it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God
that shows mercy Ver. 16.
, and whom he will he hardens Verse 18.
; so that this alone is enough to cut him off from the head; for, albeit it be
of the essence of the Will to be free: that is, to will freely what it wills,
without necessity of coaction; yet not to be at liberty to will what God would
have it, although at first so created and enabled. Sin has how bound and
determined it to sin, not to sin by compulsion, but of choice; not in the
nature, but in the use of it; not in this, that it actually wills; but, in
that it cannot now of it self will what in duty it should. So it freely wills
evil, but it can will nothing else; as in heaven the will chooses only good,
and can will nothing else; being altogether abhorrent from whatsoever is evil.
The will then throughout, in the use of it is voluntary in the choosing of what
it would, yet not arbitrary to choose what is contray to the present State of
the person endued with it.

Yet mark here a notable fraud; this Hypocrite pretends to be a great exalter
of grace, and yet even therein abaseth it; and, to be an abaser of nature, and
yet in the same thing exalts it. He ascribes man's perfection in the state of
innocence to grace, not to nature, that the decay may seem to be only of grace,
nature remaining still entire, and able now to join with grace in the work of
reparation: But hereby nature is exalted, as being able to join with grace in
man's conversion; and grace is abased as being able to do nothing without the
free and voluntary help of nature; which is to cast off the head, the author
of grace, and the restorer of nature by putting a new life into it to make it
live; and not, only furnishing her with crutches to enable her to go the better.

And, does he hold the head, that denies the imputation of Christ's
righteousness (who is the Lord our righteousness Jer. 23.6.
unto justification? He that denies his satisfaction, or the imputation of his
righteousness and satisfaction, denies him to be made unto us of God, wisdom,
and righteousness 1 Cor. 1.30.
. But this he would not be thought to do without reason. How can one, says he,
that is a sinner in himself become righteous by the righteousness of another?
Thus he grows mad with reason that he may oppose the head.

For, did he consider and believe the union between Christ and believers, he
would soon find that they are all one in him and in his father John 17.21
, Flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone Ephesians 5.30.
; not naturally, but mystically, yet really, and truly. They are the body of
Christ, and members in particular 1 Cor. 12.27.
. For, as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that
one body being many, are one body, so also is Christ Verse 12.
. He therefore that denies Christ's righteousness to be ours, severs the body
from the head, and himself from both.

And whereas he should be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world Col.
2.20
, superstition keeps him alive thereto, and therein, by a slavish subjecting
him to humane Ordinances in the matters of worship and conscience. This also
thrusts him off from the Head. For, where the true believer is dead, and
buried with Christ Col. 2.12.
, not only in regard of the guilt of sin, by the merit; and of the dominion of
sin, by the crucifying power of Christ's death; but also of the thraldom of
conscience under humane Ordinances, by the liberty Gal. 5.1.
, which Christ has likewise by the same death purchased for him; this
Hypocrite, having never attained to the former benefits of Christ's death, is
likewise destitute of this, and so he is as living in the world, and under as
much bondage by it, as if Christ had never died. He receives Laws from men to
bind the conscience, putting from him the liberty wherewith Christ has made
free all that hold the head; and so he puts from him Christ himself, who now
can profit him nothing Ver. 2.
. Vain men may count it a great perfection to receive all Ordinances of men in
the worship of God; and their rules of touch not, taste not, handle not Col.
2.21.
, in meats and drinks; but the holy Ghost pronounces such perfect ones to be
severed from the Head, and to cut off themselves from all communion with Christ
in his death.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Religious Christian holds fast, and grows up into him
in all things; who is the head, even Christ Ephesians. 4.15.
.

He has parted with the world, and is crucified to it Gal. 6.14.
by the cross, to wit, the death of Christ; and therefore will not as one
living in the world be any longer subject to worldly Ordinances, in the things
of Christ. He is severed and delivered by Christ from humane Ordinances and
dependencies in all things that properly concern God Christ, and conscience.
So that he cannot receive doctrines from men, or Laws from the Church which
contradict, or enervate the Laws and truths of Christ. He accounts the most
specious Ordinances of men in this kind, but as golden fetters, which he is
loath to put on, or to be subject unto them, lest he should put off Christ.
Therefore as Moses was to make all things according to the pattern showed to
him in the Mount Heb. 8.5.
; so the true Christian will in all things keep close to his rules that showed
that pattern, between whom and him there is such an union, such a communion,
that from this Head, He and all the body, by joints and bands having
nourishment ministered and knit together, increases with the increase of God
Col. 2.19.
.

He renounceth all liberty of will, but what he has from Christ, to think or
will any thing (spiritually good) as of himself, as knowing and acknowledging
that all his sufficiency is of God 2 Cor. 3.5.
. If he seek justification it is only from Christ and his righteousness with
renouncing of his own Phil. 3 8, 9.
, as dross and loss; dross in it self, because all his righteousnesses are
as filthy rags Esaias 64.6
; and loss, because he that rests upon it loses Christ; whosoever seeks
justification by the works of the Law is fallen from grace, Christ is become of
ne effect unto him Gal. 5.4.
.

Thus, this hypocrite forsakes Christ by depending on man; the true Christian
departs from man to cleave unto Christ; the one will have his own
righteousness or none; the other relies only on the righteousness of God, as
knowing his own to be none. The one is all for the Ordinances of Christ, which
have nourishment in them; the other feeds upon ashes, and sows the wind, by
receiving the Ordinances of men.

This Hypocrite cannot content himself with the body Col. 2.17.
, but it very zealous to join the shadow with it.

In this he is a Jew of the later edition; not one that renounceth Christ, but
joins Moses with Christ. The Law, in the morning of the world, before the
rising of the Sun of righteousness Mal. 4.2.
by his incarnation, was a shadow that went before the body; for the Ceremonial
Law had then a shadow of good things to come, not the substance Heb. 10.1.
. But after his appearance, and the dispatch of the work of redemption in his
own person, all those things that went before him to give notice of his coming,
fell back behind him, and became worthless and useless: so as, the not
retaining of them is a denial of Christ's coming in the flesh; and, now to join
them with the body, is to make the body but a shadow that can profit us nothing
Gal. 5.2.
.

What troubles such spirits have created to the Church, even after Christ was
ascended and had fulfilled all things, the history of the troubles at Antioch
Acts 15.1.
, the Schisms at Rome Romans 14. and 15
, the divisions in the Churches of Corinth 1 Cor. 8. and 9
, Galatia Gal. 2.3, 4, 5.
, Colosse Col. 2.
, and other places (even in the Apostles own times) sufficiently bear witness;
in all which, half-Jews, half-Christians, albeit they admitted of Christ for a
Savior, yet they confidently asserted, that without circumcision, and the
retaining of sundry other Rites and Ceremonies enjoined in the Ceremonial Law
of Moses, men cannot be saved, no not by Christ: which one assertion occasioned
no small disputes and dissentions Acts 15.2.
.

But as in other points of Arianisme, Pelagianisme, etc. although the Authors
be dead, yet their opinions live; and, with brows of brass appear with open
face in the clearest Sunshine of the Gospel; so does this Judaising
superstition, to eat out the heart and life of true devotion.

Has not this Hypocrite been at Rome? does not a great part of his Religion
consist in meats, in drinks, in days, wherein he places both piety and
necessity yea, merit and perfection? His Fasts, his Feasts, his Jubilees (at
first every fiftieth, and of late (because gain is sweet) every fifteenth year)
are all professedly ascribed to the Jewish solemnities. His Priests, Altars,
Sacrifices, his Sanctum sanctorum, or Holy of holies, are they not all in
imitation of the Jewish Ordinances? and, in the Church of Lateran, in his Holy
of holies, instead of the Tables of the Law, and the pot of Manna, there are,
if you believe him, Circumcisa caro Christi, sandalia chara,
Atque umbilici viget hic praecisio clara.
Christ's circumcised foreskin, his sandals deer,
And navel string cut off does flourish here.


Yea, at length he has found out Aarons rod, and put it in an Ark. He has an
High Priest after the manner of Aaron; or (as some blasphemously say) rather,
Summus Pontifex.
of Melchisedeck. He has his unction and consecration too, not only of
Priests, but of Altars and Temples, and of all vessels and utensels belonging
to his superstitious devotion; and that upon this account and reason; If the
Jews (says he) who served shadows, had such things among them, much more we
that enjoy the substance; contrary to the Apostles Logic and Divinity too, who
from the appearance and presence of the body, proves the abolition of the
shadow Col. 2. Heb. 10
; and the taking away of the first, that is the shadow, by establishing the
second, to wit, the body Verse 9.
.

And were this Hypocrite confined only to Rome and her territories, we should
not allow him a room among these Characters: but we have too many such among
our selves, half Protestants, half Papists (all hypocrites, if not Atheists,)
who more admire and imitate the Jewish pomp of Rome, than embrace the
simplicity of the Gospel. He must have his Holy of holies, his Altar, his
Tapers, his real presence, his Sacrifice, his Priests, his days, his meats,
his consecrations, his duckings, his bowings, his elevations, his adorations;
is loath to let go any thing formerly used in Pope holy Church, because of the
custom, antiquity, esteem of it among them who professedly take all these
from Moses, not Christ; from mungrel Jews, not primitive Christians. And so
vain is he, that these shadows affect him more then the substance; he lays out
more of his heart, purse, and labor upon them, than upon the body it self;
whereby it comes to pass that, embracing (as he did, a cloud instead of Juno)
the shadow of Christ our King, he lets the Prince himself go unsaluted; and,
catching at the shadow of meat, dreaming that he eats, when he comes to awake
he will find himself empty and hungry, and must needs starve for want of solid
food.

Contrarily, the faithful Christian embraces the substance as succeeding to
the shadow.

He knows that many things which had a good beginning and use, are not
therefore perpetual; but, many times, of a temporary nature and office. What
better then the brazen Serpent? yet, what worse when abused to superstition? At
first, it led to Christ; afterward, from him to the devil: Therefore then, he
will break it in pieces 2 King. 18.4
. He looks upon Christ in the Old Testament, as shining out of the East, that
made large and long shadows to those Fathers that then lived; but now he
beholds him as in his Meridian, or rather Zenith, where he neither makes, nor
admits of any shadow at all. The body at a distance is the cause of the shadow;
not the shadow, of the body. Therefore, when the body is present, and near us,
even in the mouth and in the heart Romans 10.8.
, he looks no longer after the shadow, but fixes only upon the body, and keeps
close to that. He that was the cause of them, has taken them away, and is come
himself in their room.

The shadow is not the substance, but a mere accident that can never do the
deed exspected from the substance; but the body is the substance that must
effect it. He wisely considers that those shadows of rites and sacrifices
could never make the comers thereunto perfect; Heb. 10.1, 2.
for then they would not have ceased to be offered: He finds no true
righteousness, expia ion of sin, or peace of conscience in them; but in
Christ, the Body, he has all. And when he looks upon the shadow, he finds it
to be a very obscure and imperfect figure of the Body; especially in former
times, before the body, appeared. It is hard to know a man by his shadow till
himself appear, So Christ was hardly and rarely known by those shadows before
his coming in the flesh. And when he comes, he causes the shadow to flee away,
Cant. 2 17.
yea, not to be. With good reason therefore does the faithful Christian
content himself with the Body, looking no more after the shadow.

Thus, the superstitious hypocrite imagines unto himself a night at noone, and
stumbleth at noone day as in the night. Esaias. 5.10.
The other rejoices that the day is broken, and the shadow fled away. Cant. 4.6
The one looks upon the shadow, as the fathers upon the Law of shadows,
before the Son of God appeared; The other looks on them as being removed, as
things that are made; and, upon Christ which cannot be shaken, as the only
remaining Heb. 12.27
substance coming in their room. The one looks on them as they who came from
Judea, to teach their continuance; Act. 15.1.
the other, as the Apostle to the Hebrews, to prove their abolition.

superstitious hypocrite loves carnal slavery better then spiritual liberty.

Where Christ sets him at liberty, he is unwilling to be free. Let the y^ke of
bondage be never so hard and heavy, his saying is, I love my Master -- I will
not go out free. Exodus 21.5.
He will rather run the adventure of loosing all benefit by Christ, then not be
circumcized. Gal. 5.2, 3.
He had rather be a debtor to do the whole Law, then be loosed from that yoke
from which Christ has freed him. He loves man's yoke better then Christ's
manumission. Pope, Witches, any man that speaks perverse things, swayes more
with him by humane Impositions, then God or Christ, by divine Institutions. Let
a Friday, a Lent, any day be imposed by man, and he Religiously observes it
even to superstition: Let God free him from these, and only charg him to
remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, this pleases him not.

Let Paul tell him, ye observe days and months, and times, and years, I am
afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain; G^l. 4 10, 11
This stirs him not, he will observe them still: but let God say to him, if
thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy
day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord honorable, and shall
honor him, not finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words, Esaias
58.13.
He counts this a burden, and a weariness. M^l. 1.13.
He loves a mass, better than a Sermon, any thing better then that which is the
command of Christ, so that it is hard to say whether his baseness be greater in
not accepting of liberty; or his insolence, in imposing new burdens upon
himself and others, after Christ has freed him; to create new virtues, or new
vices; to set prizes upon his own Inventions, and to bind God to the payment;
as they who by Regular Professions and Vows under color of giving God an
overplus of service, bind themselves to that which they need not, and offer to
him what he accepts not, and in the mean time scant him of that duty and
service which he justly expects. 1 Cor. 7.9
If God say it is better to marry then to burn, and allows him liberty of
marriage; He says, it is better to burn then to marry, if once he has
foolishly vowed single life.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the faithful Christian stands fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made
him free Gal. 5.1.
.

If God impose, he is ready to submit. If man subjugate him where Christ has
called him to liberty, he has no shoulders to bear it. Obedient to superiors,
he will be in things lawful; but, blind obedience, under the notion of
Regular, will not down with him. And even in things imposed by God, he looks
most at that which must take the first place. Sacrifice is good, but Mercy is
better, and the greater duty: therefore where both cannot be performed, Mercy
is preferred, and his conscience not ensnared, nor troubled for not offering
that Sacrifice which could not consist with Mercy Mat. 12.7.
.

If God bring poverty upon him, he knows how to want, and in all Estates to be
content Phil. 4.11, 12
; but, to make choice of poverty, being called to an estate of plenty; or, set
in a lawful way thereunto, and remembering that it is a more blessed thing to
give, then to receive Acts 20.35.
; and that charge given to the rich, to be rich in good works 1 Timothy 6.17,
, which is impossible, where all is wilfully given away without warrant; he
dares not make himself poor by vowing of poverty. And albeit God may give a
special Commandment to a boasting Perfectist, to sell what he has, and to give
to the poor Mat. 19.21.
; yet he looks upon that as upon the tempting of Abraham, to offer his Isaac
Genesis 22.1
: but with this difference, God did it to Abraham for trial of his faith; to
the other, for discovery of his hypocrisy in his confident boasting.

He can like well of continency and chastity, but if God call him to marriage,
he looks upon it as both lawful and honorable Heb. 13.4
. He accounts it no less violence to nature, and tentation to sin, without the
special gift of continency, not given to all, to vow perpetual virginity;
because, neither is virginity in it self simply good; for then the commoner the
better: which is not so in this case, because then, both mankind and the
Church must perish: nor is it (as every virtue is) an habit of the mind, but a
privation, and belongs to the body; nor is the contrary of virginity evil, as
the contrary to chastity is. Therefore he interprets our Saviors saying Mat.
19.11.
, He that is able to receive it, let him receive it, not as meant of all, nor
to any sort of men, (for all men cannot receive it;) but to them only to whom
it is given Verse 10.
, by special and extraordinary gift for advancement of the Kingdom of God.

Nor will he be rash with his mouth to vow against what is not simply sinful,
in a passion; or, for compassing the better some carnal design. He knows such
vows are snares, and do often hurry men upon temptations and sins, as
Jephthah's vow, and many more.

Thus this hypocrite is content to purchase slavery with the loss of liberty;
the true Christian will not sell his liberty upon any conditions. The one, if
he have liberty, uses it as an occasion to gratify the flesh Gal. 5.13.
; the other, if he be under any tyranny of the flesh, will never give himself
or Christ any rest; till the Son has made him free, that he may be free
indeed John 8.36
; the one is under a spirit of bondage, and likes best of slavery, the other
under a spirit of Adoption, and therefore prizeth and preserves his spiritual
liberty. The one boasts of being Abraham's seed, that never was in bondage to
any man Verse 33.
, yet is a slave to every man; the other is truly his seed that is free indeed,
even while he makes himself a servant unto all 1 Cor. 9.19.
.

This Hypocrite is ever hampering and intangling conscience.

It is the nature of superstition to bind where God loses, and to loose
where God binds, to fish in troubled waters, and to delight in puzzling and
perplexing both himself and others: for being purblinde, the superstitious
hypocrite is always poaching and poring in the dark, and naturally stumbles
upon that which proves a stumbling block both to himself and others, causing
divisions and offenses. He is dogmatized, that is, subject to, and burdened
with Ordinances, Col. 2.20.
that perplex and trouble him, and he is well contented with it. For, he
suffers, if a man bring him into bondage, if a man devour him, if a man take
of him, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite him on the the face 2 Cor. 11.20
.

He will stand still with the pack-horse, or rather kneel down with the Camel, to
take his load, till his back crack again. Most of his inquiries, most of his
zeal runs out upon doubtful subjects, doting about questions and strifes of
words whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse
disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth 1 Timothy 6 4, 5.
. His chief Quaeres are, whether such and such meats be lawful? whether such
days be to be observed? and, being stupefied with superstition, and terrified
with some hellish apprehensions, he easily subjects his conscience to every
man's tyranny, that will lay a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall, in his
way Romans 14.13.
. He can swallow a Purgatory, a whip in Lent, with greatest devotion.

And as he is a troubler of his own house and soul, so is he a great disturber
of others, especially if he be, or conceit himself to be of any learning and
parts. He is ever in his doubtful disputations, even when he is to deal with
the weakest Verse 1.
, whereas he ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not please himself,
but to please his neighbor for his good to edification Romans 15.1, 2
. He zealously affects the people he has to do with, but not well; yea, he
would exclude them, that they might affect him Gal. 4.17.
. He can press upon them a Purgatory, Images, a Crucifix, and what not; and so
troubles them, that he deserves to be cut off Gal. 5.12.
for his puzzling disputes about ensnaring questions. The yoke of ceremonies
was a burden that neither the later Jews nor their fathers were able to bear
Acts 15.10
, yet this he endeavors with might and maine to put upon the necks of the
disciples: and, it is strange to see that men should be so mad and greedy when
God has pulled down the wall of that Bride-wel, to run again into that prison,
and to fetter themselves, and other anew.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian is ever delighted most in those truths which set
the conscience free.

He will not be the servant of men 1 Cor. 7.23.
, that load and entangle him with niceties and scruples; but, as the free
servant of Christ, he will keep himself free from all men that attempt it. He
looks upon himself as redeemed 1 Pet. 1.18
from whatever he received by tradition from his fathers.

He disdains all comforters that pretend to give ease to his conscience by
penances, pilgrimages, whippings, confessions in the ears of a Priest, and such
like miserable comforts. He looks upward above all these to the blood of
Christ, to satisfy divine justice, to expiate sin, and to pacify conscience.
Ashur shall not save him, he will not ride upon horses of his own strength or
merit; neither will he say to the works of his hands, ye are my gods. But, in
God alone he expects to find mercy Hos 14.3.
. His cordials drawn hence, the more they are examined, the more they are
approved, and do give more full and lasting, yea everlasting consolations and
good hope through grace; for mercy is infinite whereby God was moved to promise
grace; his truth infallible whereby he is engaged to keep promise, and his
power omnipotent to make good his engagement; which he apprehends, not as the
despairing conscience apprehends God to be strong to condemn or destroy; but,
mighty to save. And into these, the more narrowly we look, the more bottomless
we find them.

Thus, this hypocrite has the art of disturbance; the true Christian labors
to settle all upon a firm foundation. The one cares not how he loads the
conscience with unnecessary burdens, the other seeks to ease it of
uncomfortable fears; the one troubles his own house, and inherits the wind
Prove. 11.29.
; the other by avoiding doubtful disputations, possesses his soul in peace.

The superstitious hypocrite affects darkness.

Darkness in the understanding, darkness in the tongue, darkness in the eye,
darkness

Of some things he is willingly ignorant, that he may not abate of his blind
devotion; he loves not to hear what may open his eyes to see the vanity and
folly of what he affects, but rather gives a stop to such discourses. He
closes his eyes that he might not see Mat. 13.15
, and stops his ears that he might not hear, and loves to be groping in the
dark as if he had no eyes Esaias 54.10.
. If comfort or counsel be offered him even in secret, contrary to his own way
and blind profession, he cries out as once that Popish Bishop lying on his
deathbed did, when one of his fellow Bishops visiting him, persuaded him to
rely upon the merits of Christ alone for salvation: O my Lord, quoth he, no
more of that; if you once open that gap to the people, then farewell all. Thus
as the Athenians sometimes punished those who made known the causes of
Eclipses, because it diminished fear and superstition in the people; so this
hypocrite shuns nothing more then too much knowledge in himself or others,
whereby the esteem of his superstitious vanities, and his own judgment about
them should be abased. As ignorance in natural Philosophy raises a belief and
reputation of counterfeit miracles; so ignorance in the superstitious is not
only the mother but supporter of all superstitious devotion. Therefore he will
not hear of confutations of merits of works of indulgences, Purgatory,
superstitious customs, etc. but avoids all disputations about them all he can,
and had rather be blind with superstition, than have his understanding opened
to deliver him from it.

When he speaks, he loves to speak darkly and ambiguously; least, speaking out
plainly, all would decry him. Therefore as painted faces seek a shade, so does
superstition endeavor to deliver it self in the dark. He is good at darkning
counsel, by words without knowledge Job 38.2.
. Hence as the Heathenish Priests had their mythologies, and strange canting
expressions of their imaginary unaccessable deities, to amaze and low-bel their
blind superstitious followers, and thereby to hold up their Popish and apish
idolatries in greater veneration; so this hypocrite has his terms of Art
suitable to his superstition wherein he nuzzleth his blind disciples. He can
also tell them of strange apparitions, terrible whippings by spirits that walk
in the dark, and thousand such like old wives tales merely to hold men in the
same bondage, with himself.

His very Temples and places of devotion must be as dark as sumptuous; as
secluse as pompous. The windows must be darkened with pictures in them, that so
the very places may strike a kind of terror into all that frequent those
places. He knows that counterfeit beauties are more glorious by torch-light, or
in the shade than in open Sun; so are all his fopperies and counterfeit
devotions more lovely, or rather less ridiculous in a darkish room.

His works also are in the dark Esaias 29.15
, therefore he hates the light. And as of old, the ancients of Israel had
their grossest idolatries Joh. 3.20.
in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery Ezekiel. 8.12
; so this hypocrite has his more odious superstitions in corners and in the
dark, where he may more fully stretch and glut himself upon them, with less
contradiction or notice. He has his private Oratories, and in them his Altar,
Tapers, and all other Massing trinkets more complete than in the Cathedral. And
there he powers out his superstitious devotions, with greater zeal, and with
stronger opinion of better acceptance, for the place sake, and will not be
persuaded to pray in any room of his house but there.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian loves the light.

True Religion stands with all truth, and is like unto God in whom is no
darkness at all 1 John 1.5.
; and therefore rejoices in the light, without seeking of corners, so does the
true Christian, who hates every false way Psalm. 119.104
of superstition, out of love to the Law. He maintains nothing, but what he is
well content should be brought to the test and standard of the Word. If he be
in an error of opinion or practice, he does not hide it, as Adam did his
nakedness, but brings it to the Law and to the Testimonies Esaias 8.20.
. If he hear ought from others, he carries all to the Scriptures, to see
whether those things be so Acts 17.11.
, although delivered by Paul himself. He will not be carried by names of men,
or Churches, jurare in verba Magistri, to subscribe to all they deliver; nor
will he contradict even his maidservant, if she speak more truth, or better
reason then he Job 31.13.
. He is a child of light, and therefore loves it, and walks in it John 12.35
; and is ever jealous of those that skulk in the dark.

Thus, the superstitious hypocrite is a blind leader of the blind Mat. 15.14
; the true Christian comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest
that they are wrought in God John 3.21
. The one is a teacher of lies in the dark; the other a disciple of truth in
the light.

The Superstitious Hypocrite is most strict in matters of smallest moment.

He will pay tithe of mint, and annis, and cummin; but; to the weightier
matters of the Law, judgment, mercy and faith Mat. 23 ^3
, he is not so forward. He is very zealous and precise in his touch not, taste
not, handle not (...). 2.21
; whereas he can let righteousness, peace and ^^y in the holy Ghost, (wherein
the Kingdom of God consists Romans 14.7
) to stand by unsaluted; yet he cannot but know, that meat commends us not to
God 1 Co^. 8.^
; and that all things of this nature (wherein superstition busieth her self
most) perish and are consumed in or with the using Col. 2.22
, yea, and are (...) ordained and appointed to perish with their use.

Thus the superstitious Priests made no scruple to hire a traitor, to suborne
false witnesses, to apprehend, to bind, to smite, to scourge, to blaspheme, to
condemn the innocent Lamb of God, and to crucify the Lord of glory; yet made
great conscience not to step over the threshold into the judgment hall of an
heathen Judge, lest (forsooth!) they should be defiled, but that they might eat
the Passover Joh. 8.28.
yet this shunning of Pilates Hall was no Commandment of God. They made no
conscience to give a price for innocent blood; but made great scruple of
putting it into the Treasury as being unlawful Mat. 27.6
.

In these later times this hypocrite speaking lies in hypocrisy, forbids
marriage 1 Timothy 4.3.
, and allows flews: is very severe in commanding abstinence from meats, which
God has created to be received with thanksgiving, yet makes nothing for the
good of the Catholic cause (as he varnisheth over his own interest) to poison
and massacre Emperors and Kings, which God has forbidden to be touched. He
will not touch money, or eat flesh on a Friday, but he will take rent for
brothel-houses, and allow Priests an absolution for defiling silly women laden
with diverse lusts, upon a very easy penance, whiles he makes their taking of
wives to avoid fornication 1 Cor. 7.2
, piacular, and unpardonable. He is all for Sacrifice, nothing for Mercy.

Differ.
On the contrary, the faithful Christians chiefest care is for the greatest
duties.

If God will have tithes of mint, and annis, he will not rob him therein Mal.
3.8
, but his maine care is for judgment, mercy, and faith, because these are the
weightier matters of the Law Mat. 23.23
. If God has left things indifferent, and left him to his liberty in the use
of any meats that are wholesome. He judges presently that now, every creature
of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving
1 Timothy 4.4
, and therefore uses or forbeareth them, with freedom of conscience, and
observing the rules of charity to a weak brother 1 Cor. 8.13.
, with respect to spiritual duties which he prefers before his own liberty and
contentments; and, unto grace which he valueth beyond meats; for that he knows
it to be far better that the heart be stablished with grace then with meats,
which have not profitted (as to spiritual benefit) them that h^ve been occupied
(as placing Religion) therein Heb. 13 9
. He will be open handed, and free-hearted to any pious use, and rather part
with all, than let the poor Saints perish; yet he will not say, Corban to his
parents in their wants, and take himself by that to be discharged from
supplying them. Here he knows mercy must take place of sacrifice. He will make
conscience of the least duty, but his eye, heart, and hand are most for the
greatest, and he judges of things as God judges; and he so uses even
perishing things, that to him they perish not; for he will freely, in obedience
to God, lend them to the Lord Prove. 19.17
, and thereby provideth himself bags which wax not old, and puts up treasure in
the heavens that fails not Luke 12.33.
, and lay up in store for himself a good foundation against the time to come,
that he may lay hold on eternal life 1 Timothy 6.19.
.

Thus, this hypocrite strains at a gnat, and swallows a camel Mat. 23.24
; the true Christian is most careful of avoiding the camel, yet not careless
of shunning the gnat: The one is officious in things not simply required; the
other is most obedient in things chiefly commanded The one makes himself work,
as if God had laid too l^ttle on him; the other busieth himself most where God
has laid most weight: The Religion of the one is perishing, because chiefly
placed in perishing things; the Religion of the other is everlasting, he having
chosen the good part that shall not be taken from him Luke 10.42
.

The Superstitious hypocrite is a great pretender to the knowledge of things
concealed.

He intrudeth into those things which he has not seen Col. 2.18.
There are many things touching the nature of Angels their manner of
conference, their knowledge, order, number, laws, offices, employments, which
God has concealed from man in this mortality; to say nothing of other divine
secrets not clearly revealed in Scripture, because not necessary to salvation;
yet useful to exercise man's faith and humility, and to let him see what
knowledge he lost in Adam, by seeking more knowledge then was meet Genesis 3.6.
. Yet this hypocrite scorns to seem ignorant of any thing, even while he knows
nothing, as he ought to know of any thing. And such is the over-weaning conceit
of carnal wisdom corrupted by sin, and blinded by it and for it; that this
hypocrite takes upon him with great confidence to soar into the Angelical
conclave, as high as Plato, or any forged Dionysius of them all.

He can tell you punctually how many degrees and orders there are among the
Angels, their names, natures, offices and degrees, as if he had been a
traveller in heaven as many years, as Lucian in the orb of the Moon; and can
relate as many stories of them, as ever Lucian did of the inhabitants of that
Lunary world; only with this difference, that whereas Lucian, although an enemy
to Religion, and to God the Author of it, was yet so ingenuous as to
acknowledge, that in his book de vera historia, his Readers should take nothing
for true in it, but only this one confession, that in it there was nothing
true; this hypocrite will have all his lies to be taken for truths; and those,
no less than divine.

And whereas there are in this sublunary world, many things visible, or
otherwise sensible, or seen by the effects, as, the blowing of the wind, the
flowings of the sea, the pointing of the lodestone to the North, and a
thousand sympathies, antipathies, and instincts, and infinite paths which no
foul knows, and which the vultures eye has not seen, nor the Lions whelp
trodde, nor the fierce Lion passed by Job 28.7, 8.
. This Phaeton, this Prometheus will undertake to describe whatever he
pleases, not only above, but below it; Paradise, Purgatory, Hell, and what
not? He can tell you what Peter, the Angels, the Virgin Mary, and other friends
do in heaven: what fiends do in hell; How many years such an one must lie in
Purgatory: how soon delivered thence, if his friends will go to the price.

Nay, he can tell you the very time of the day of judgment (which he never
believed;) and in what manner it shall be holden, and who condemned in it,
although he hopes never to see it. He takes upon him to foretell future events
which he never expects; and, to tell you what shall be hereafter; although it
never come to pass.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian contents himself with things revealed.

This is his utmost Tether, to which he confines all his knowledge, all his
enquiries both for himself, and all that enquire of him Deuteronomy. 29.29
. Not that he refuses to improve reason the light of the soul, and candle of
the Lord, to see what cannot be discerned by sense so far as reason can
discover it; and so, second faith in believing. There are some things invisible
to sense, which reason can descry; and some things may be discovered to reason,
which only faith can believe: Not that faith makes reason the ground of belief,
but only satisfies the believer, that what he believes, is not unreasonable.
So that the Christian, not only by the eye of sense, can see both earthly and
heavenly bodies; and by the eye of reason, he understands things universal and
immaterial, meditates on things absent, attains to conclusions of Art, and to
the order of causes and effects yea, to some discovery of the invisible things
of God, (not to know all that God does or intends; but, to find out an
eternal power and Godhead) from the things that are made Romans 1.20
: But (which is the greatest mercy of all) by the eye of faith (which begins
and goes on, where reason is at a stand, and can go no further; yea, leads
reason beyond it self) he sees him that is invisible Heb. 11.27
, and not only a present visible world created of nothing, but a better world;
(that is, an heavenly) beyond, and after this, as the recompense of the
believer; and God the King thereof for ever and ever.

What the Scripture says of God, Heaven, Hell, or ought else revealed by God
in his Word, he reverently receives, diligently enquireth into, and firmly
believes. But there he erects his Herculean pillar; further he will not go, no
not to see Pope Gregory deliver the soul of Trajan out of hell; much less will
he keep a Catalogue of all the souls delivered out of Purgatory, or kept from
thence by the devout friends of the deceased.

He never troubles himself about the hour or day of the last judgment: only
he considers that it must be, and therefore (by all holy conversation and
godliness) looks for, and hasteneth to the coming of the day of God 2 Pet
3.11, 12
. He believes the benefit appointed of God by the Ministry of Angels; and
therefore honors them as his guard set about him by God, but does not
worship them as God, because his fellow servants; he makes use of their
Ministry, without enquiring after their names, orders, or degrees which
Scripture has not discovered. He believes all things written touching the last
times, but it is the least of his care to ask, When shall these things be Mat.
24.3.
? He is inquisitive after duty, but not after secrets.

Thus, the hypocrite is like mad Orestes, that saw two Suns, and a double
Thebes, seeing things invisible to faith; the true Christian like sober Elihu,
sees things invisible to reason. The one takes upon him go affirm from God,
what God says not; the other dares not assert any thing but what God speaks in
his word; the one seemingly believes, because he thinks he does understand;
the other truly understands, because he believes.

This Hypocrite is all for new models, and senses in things revealed.

His capritious brain cannot long consent to the pattern of wholesome words 1 Timothy 6.3.
, according to the simplicity of the Gospel; but he must have his new coined
models and forms, as being able to set all the world to School touching the
very body of Divinity: not to explain or methodise things more obscure, and
without order; but, to obscure things, plain; and to make God speak in the
language and method of men, thereby darkening counsel by words without
knnowledge Job. 38.2.
.

What else is the singularity of the ordinary Popish School divinity, but an
adulterated body tempered with the drugs and dregs of humane reason? A
Reconciliation of Paul to Aristotle, and Plato; rather then a translation of
them over to Paul? some gold may be found in it, but with so much toil amidst
the mountains of rubbish and dross, as the gold is not worth the labor and
pains spent to come at it. Some wholesome food may be in it, but more poison,
and therefore dangerous to young Students, raw Philosophers, smattering
ungrounded Divines, who for want of use and experience, have not their senses
exercised to discern both good and evil Heb. 5.14.
; nor knowledge and judgment to discern of things that differ, and to approve
the things that are excellent Phil. 1.9, 10.
; and to holdfast that which is good 1 These. 5.21
.

For this hypocrite is like Penelope's wooers, who corrupted her maids to make
way to their mistress, so he corrupts the most useful Sciences, thereby to
defile Divinity. But as Ulysses returning, killed those lustful wooers, and
hanged up the waiting maids; so will Christ one day destroy those Arts and
Artists that have so far attempted the chastity of faith and Religion.

Nor is the curious Questionist to be left out of the rank and number of this
sort of hypocrites, whose Religion lies most in moving impertinent and
unprofitable Questions. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar Luke 20.22.
? Are there few that shall be saved Luke 13.22
? What did God before he made the world? What shall this man do John 21.21
? Why does he yet find fault? who has resisted his will Romans 9.19.
? When stall the day of the last judgment be? Where is the promise of his
coming 2 Pet 3.4
? and a thousand such vain Quaeres, of men doting about questions 1 Timothy 6.4
. Thus he pleases himself in controverting and objecting, to show the strength
of his wit, not out of love to the truth, but affectation of curiosity and
vainglory.

Of the same spirit and stamp is the Allegorizer who has opened the flood-gate
of error by turning the Scripture into a Poetical fiction. Origin was in this
kind exceeding heady, but the superstitious Romanist and Familist have far
exceeded him; the one making this wild mythology one of their four Senses;
and the other, the only sense of Scripture. The source of all these and the
like dotages in the superstitious Hypocrite proceeds from the admiration of his
own foolish reason, whereby he has maintained a private conference with his
own brainsick heart, the greatest seducer and impostor in the world.

On the contrary, the faithful Christian asks for the old paths, the good way,
Differ.
and walks therein Jer. 6.16
.

While others are for the new wine, he says, the old is better Luke 5.39.
. It is true that every Scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like
to a good householder which brings forth out of his treasure things new and
old Mat. 13.52
; but not new truths, or another Gospel: but the same truths in the most
profitable way; in acceptable words; but still, in words of truth Eccl. 12.9, 10
; even the words of our Lords Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according
to godliness, ordering and sharpening them so, that they may be as goads and
nails given from one shepherd Verse 11.
.

He makes use of sense as an intelligencer to reason; and of reason as a
counselor of State unto faith: but faith is judge of all, and makes her own
choice; is not swayed by others that serve her, but encouraged to go on in her
own way the better; making use of their counsel, but seeing more then her
counselors.

He can admit of new methods and models that may make truth more clear, and
facile to the understandings of those he has to deal with all, but shuns all
ambiguous and dangerous expressions, as inlets to error, and enemies to the
truth, although they may with an interpretation be defended. He considers
that he that delights to walk in amphibologies and doubtful expressions, either
is or would be a deceiver, that as yet dares not speak plainly, till he see how
his opinions will take, therefore he resolves both in opinion, language and
practice to walk uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel. He will not
bribe Reason to corrupt Faith, but bring her into subjection unto faith. He
will hear reason, but not be judged by her in matters of faith. Reason shall be
his torch; but, the Word, his scene, and to this light, he brings every opinion
in question.

He may ask Questions; but he does it, not for trial, but satisfaction; not to
vent or open a way to a new opinion, but to be settled in the old truth, and to
be made sound in the faith: not to quarrel, but to edify; not out of
curiosity, but love to the truth, as the Disciples oft-times asked Questions of
Christ.

Yea more; when he finds men highly conceited of their own abilities, and yet
strongly seducing men from the truth to error, or seeking to entrap him by
captious proposals, He holds it not amiss by asking questions which he knows
they cannot, or dare not answer, to lay open their folly before all men, whom
they seek to deceive. Thus Christ often propounded Questions to the Pharisees,
when he saw their errors Luke 2.46.
, or smelt out their temptings Mat. 22.20. Mar. 11.29.
, or thought fit to lay open their ignorance who gave themselves out to be the
profoundest and most occular Rabbi's Mat. 22.42
. So also when he would instruct the ignorant, he finds the asking of
questions to be one of the best inlets to the truths he would inform them in,
because the very propounding of a Quaere touching what they know not, puts
their mind and thoughts on work to consider more of the thing propounded, and
so renders them more docile and willing to receive instruction Mat. 16, 13, etc.
.

And as for the sense of Scripture, he dares no more impose a new sense, than a
new Gospel. He admits of those allegories which he finds in Scripture, but
makes none of his own; when the words are figurative, he considers the context
and scope, and from thence collecteth the sense and mind of the holy Ghost. He
will be as wise as he can; but, according to sobriety, and open Scripture as
clearly as he can; but according to analogy, or proportion if faith, that he
may not make truths to enterfeir, nor put a sense upon an obscure text which
may cross another more plain.

Thus the Hypocrite is no body, if you admit not his novelty; the true
Christian is an enemy to novelty, and to all that introduce it. The one minds
nothing but his own things; the other only the things of Jesus Christ; the one
makes plain things obscure, the other makes obscure things plain.

This hypocrite affects humility even beyond duty.

Humility is prescribed of God, and Christ gives the pattern to which he
requires conformity Mat. 11.29
; but this hypocrite will needs go beyond it, or else he thinks he does
nothing. He is for a voluntary humility Col. 2.18
, even beyond precept or exemple* that is, an humility stretched out by
hypocrisy beyond what in duty is required, an humility chosen and taken up by
his own will, thereby the more to insinuate himself and his own opinions into
the minds and hearts of those whom he seeks to corrupt and deceive.

It pleases men well to see others carry themselves low and beneath him.
Therefore this grace is carefully counterfeited, and this net cunningly spread
by the hypocrite. This argument he uses for prayer to Saints, dare any man be
so bold as to go directly and immediately to Christ? nay, be more humble, and
take some Saint in your way: for Purgatory, think you so well of your self, as
when you die to step immediately into heaven? nay, take Purgatory in your way;
For believing in the Church, will you take upon you to be wiser then the whole
Church, or then Saint Peter, or Christ's Vicar General upon earth? will you
question the decisions of Councels, received by your Ancestors? nay, believe as
the Church believes, and as your father and grandfather have believed: for
blind obedience, will you refuse to follow the rules of Saint Benedict, Saint
Dominick, Saint Francis, etc? Were not this intolerable pride? nay, submit
absolutely to your Superiors. Thus the masters of superstition bear themselves
out among their novices and vassals, against all arguments brought to refuse
their follies, upon their great (but fained) humility, because those things
have indeed a show of humility Col. 2.23
; and seem to commend the same humility to others, the more easily thereby to
seduce them.

But such humility is but a cloak for pride by them objected to others who will
not submit to their traditions and trumpery. For it magnifieth man above God,
by making man wiser than God, and man's will a more absolute rule and Law of
faith and obedience then the will and Law of God, for that when God appoints
none of these things, this hypocrite takes upon him to show you a more
excellent way. And because all men are of one nature, end every vain man would
be wise; he that magnifieth others, magnifies himself. All wicked men are
proud, even toward men, and too apt to lift up the horn even against God
himself; but none are cunningly proud, but the seemingly humble hypocrite that
knows how to put on humility for a cloak, in which he is his crafts-master: he
is more proud of his masked humility, than others of their bravery, and can do
the more mischief, as that dog which fights lowest, will soonest take hold of
the bull, and hold him fast when he has him.

On the contrary, the true Christian is humble according unto Christ. Differ.


He takes pattern from Christ, and is truly humble without affectation. He
knows that true humility is the sum of piety; and to walk humbly with God
Mica. 6.8
, is better then all inventions of our own, to bring us with acceptance into
his presence. But he will not walk humbly without God; nor be more humble then
he has appointed. What greater pride then to invent an humility of our own? He
will not prescribe to God, but will be content to do what God has showed to be
good. He abhors all humility that is not taught by Christ, nor practiced by his
disciples and members according to rule. If God say, come unto me: he accounts
it no malepertnesse to go boldly to the throne of grace Heb. 4.16
. If Christ say, This day shall thou be with me in Paradise Luke 23.43
, and pronounce them blessed that die in the Lord, for they rest from their
labors Rev. 14.13
. He troubles not his heart with the fear of Purgatory pains, nor gives one
penny toward his deliverance thence.

If Christ tell him, these things are written that ye might believe John 20.31
. He accounts it no humility at all to believe what is not written, whoever
would obtrude it; nor pride to hold him accursed of God that brings him any
other Gospel Gal. 1.9.
. If Paul bid him to be a follower of him, as he is of Christ 1 Cor. 11.1.
. He thinks it no disobedience or arrogance to refuse to go with him, or after
him, one step farther; or, to try all things 1 These. 5.21
by whomsoever imposed, and to hold fast only that which is good. He will no
more give blind obedience to man, then give the chair to the devil. What God
enjoyneth or allows, he humbly obeys, what man further imposes (especially
in the things of God) he humbly refuses. He is as Hushai, well enough
contented that Ahitophel be reputed the abler Counselor; but if he once find
that he consulteth against David, he is then bold to say plainly, that
Ahitophels Counsel that he has given is not good 2 Samuel 17.7
. If any man counsel against Christ, he will not only refuse to embrace it, but
boldly oppose it, for that he can do nothing against the truth, but for the
truth 2 Cor. 13.8
, how proud soever counterfeit humility account him for so doing.

Thus the hypocrite is humble in affectation; the true Christian in affection;
the one toward man, who can deceive; the other toward God, who will not be
mocked. The one is proud in his lowest humility, the other is humble in his
highest resolutions.

This hypocrite deals injuriously with the body.

He is all for bodily Religion, bodily exercise, yet in the midst of all his
bodily devotions, he is not only neglectful of, but cruel to his own body: not
the body of sin, for that he too much favors and pampereth, taking thought
for it, how to fulfill the lusts thereof; but his natural body, which no man
ever hated, but loves and cherishes Ephesians. 5.29
, and so under a color of Religion destroys nature. This is that (...), that
imparcentia, or not sparing of the body, but dealing hardly and harshly with it
out of an opinion of merit, and ambitious desire of vainglory, which Paul Col.
2.23.
takes notice of in the superstitious hypocrite, as one of the clearest
Characters to know him by, and as one of the maine branches of the mystery of
superstition, which carries a great show, and gains a great opinion of
extraordinary pietey.

An old stratagem that Satan puts upon all superstitious impostours. Baals
Priests cut themselves with knives and lancers till the blood gushed out; not
upon the present extraordinary occasion alone, but this was their usual manner
1 King. 18.28
. The Pharisees could not hold a fast, but they disfigured their faces Mat.
6.16 (...)
, that they might look grim and ghastly like a wild beast, or bear robbed of
her whelps, that they might appear unto men to fast, placing more Religion in
that coarse usage of the face, then in rending of the heart.

It is with him an high point of perfection, to deny to his body the honor due
unto it, and to macerate, not his corrupt, but natural flesh. One while he
seeks to starve it by superstitious fasting in an apish imitation of Moses, or
Christ, which he was never enjoined by God, as if God must be beholding to him
for going supperless to bed; another while he places great Religion in wearing
hair-cloth, going barefoot, whipping of himself. Happily, he gives his body to
be burnt, thinking by a supposed Martyrdom, not only to escape purgatory, but
to merit unto superrirogation. Wherein what does he more then some Heathenish
Indians, who willingly throw themselves under the wheels of that chariot which
carries their Idols?

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian gives due honor to the body.

This is Gods allowance, and nature craves it, therefore he dares not defraud
his body of it. The flesh as opposed to the spirit, taken either for grace or
the worker of it, is a wicked quality, and this he endeavors to crucify Gal.
5.24
, and destroy Romans 6.6
: But the flesh or body opposed to the reasonable soul is a created substance,
and necessary instrument for the service of God and man; this therefore he
preserves and nourishes, not unto intemperance, but to strength and fitness
for service. He will not destroy nature under color of mortification, nor
pamper it to gratify lust, under pretense of cherishing the body. Here he will
rather beat down his body and bring it into subjection 1 Cor. 9.27
, then humor his natural flesh to gratify his sinful flesh. He will no more
make flesh to serve flesh, than see flesh against flesh, the flesh of sin
against the flesh of nature.

He never accounts that to be true grace, that is an enemy to Gods creature;
nor that to be worship of God, which destroys the worshipper. He looks upon the
body as the lodging and instrument of the soul, which God is so careful of,
that whoever destroys it, shall himself be destroyed Genesis 9.6
. And for as much as Christ himself assumed a body as well as a soul, redeemed
the body 1 Cor. 6.20
by the price of his own blood, and has honored it so far as to make it the
Temple of the holy Ghost Ver. 19.
; and a partaker of his glory. The true Christian will not neglect it; he will
neither fast himself into a consumption, nor watch himself into a frenzy, nor
feast himself unto excess. He will give it a temperate allowance, with respect
to strength or weakness; he will neither deny it wine when it needs it, nor
overcharge it with strong drink, to disable it from duty. He can feast, and
fast without wronging the body, but in all is careful to maintain the honor
due unto it.

Thus the hypocrite mortifies the body it self, and thereby sins; the true
Christian, the deeds of the body of sin, that he might not sin. The one
crucifies the natural body by bodily exercise, the other mortifies the sinful
body by the spirit, that he may live.

The superstitious hypocrite is then most fleshly, when he seems most
spiritual; and most wordly, when he would be thought most heavenly.

He must have somewhat to look upon, while he worshippeth, as the Israelites
their calf to go before them Exodus 32.1
, when Moses was out of sight. A sensual worship must have a sensible object.
Superstition can no more act upon a spiritual substance, than idolatry it self;
for that which in it self is carnal, cannot be satisfied with that which is
merely spiritual.

He spares not the body indeed, but in the mean time pampereth the fleshly
mind; he starveth the bodily substance, while he feeds the fleshly sense. Th
s one thing alone proves superstition to be sensual, because that it is
delighted and nourished with sensual objects, as shades, lights, sounds,
smells, and such like as it consists in fleshly rites, washings, lashings,
vestures, gestures, wherein the body and sense bear the greatest share. It
pretends to austerity in life, but cannot submit it self to a spiritual rule.
It is a great professor of piety; but, of that which is of man's devising Esaias
29 13
, not of Gods appointment.

In like manner he is a perfect worldling, even in abstaining from some worldly
acts, or objects. He is acted by the spirit of the world 1 Cor. 2.12
, while he seems to renounce it; as they, by the spirit of Satan, who spit at
his name while they practice his lusts. He seeks his reward in the world, and
from the world, while he makes show of acting for God. If he seems to turn his
back upon the pleasures, or wealth of the world, yet then (in alms, prayer,
fasting) he hawks after honor and fame, or some such other smoke that he may
have glory of men Mat. 6.2.
.

When he seems to retire himself most from the world, yet it is but as he
that dreameth, who from the common world with-draweth into a world of his own;
framing to himself a new way to gain, or glory, so that his way is worldly, and
his very heaven is earthly. This is that which gives such a vogue to points or
single life, veneration of Saints, authority of the Church, pomp in Gods
service, rigor of discipline, affectation of Martyrdom, on the one hand; and,
to a carnal rejecting of all order, discipline, and government, on the other.

Wherefore the Canons of superstition are by the Apostle branded, by the names
of rudiments of the world Col. 2.20.
, carnal Commandments Heb. 7.16.
, carnal Ordinances Heb. 9.10
, beggarly element Gal. ^.9.
, etc. and that not only in reference unto such things as God for a season
imposed on the Jews, consisting in distinctions of meats, times, places, etc.
which were directed to a spiritual end, while their instituted use remained;
but became carnal, weak and beggarly, when men would retain them after Christ
had put an end to them; but also, in respect of all humane inventions in the
things of God, obtruded by men; which as they are earthy in their original, so
are they carnal in their use, and worldly in their end, to nourish one or other
of those worldly lusts of the flesh, or of the eye, or of the pride of life 1
John 2.16
.

He will write his name a Regular; but in life, none more Secular. He will not
touch money, unless with a double glove, lest he be defiled; but put it into
his cowle or hood, or give it to his covent, he asks no question for
conscience sake. His vow is wilful poverty; yet who so rich in the lands and
treasures of Princes? If he be invited to return to the world, he seems to
disdain the motion: yet one way or other he will come at it, although he ride
toward it as with his face to the horse tail. And if he be so strict as not
to receive the wealth of the world; yet (as Curious) he loves to command those
that have it, and to appoint them how to bestow it.

Contrarily, the true Christian truly renounced all ungodliness and worldly
lusts, Differ.
when he gave himself unto God.

He can worship God truly in spirit and truth John 4.24.
, without the help of any similitude before him, or of any Idea, or image
within him. He will no more please his fancy, without God, than he will
gratify the devil against God. His devotions are spiritual, not only for the
rule, but for his ends propounded to himself therein 1 Cor. 10.31.
. He has received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit that is of God,
and thereby judges of and practices religious duties, not according to the
lusts of men, but to the will of God. He takes no thought for the flesh,
because he has put on the Lord Jesus Christ. He uses worldly blessings in a
heavenly manner.

He can eat and drink, and enjoy the good of his labor, and take his portion
and rejoice in his labor, as the gift of God Eccl. 5.18, 19
; yet he rejoices as though he rejoiced not, and buyeth as though he possessed
not, and uses this world as not abusing it 1 Cor. 7.30, 31
. He neither sets his heart upon it when he has it, nor is he troubled to part
with it for God. He neither commits adultery Jam. 4.4.
with it, by bestowing his heart upon it, which is due only to Christ his
husband; nor commits idolatry Col 3.5.
to it, by making it his strong City, or as an high wall in his own conceit
Prove. 18.10.
, nor undertakes Religion upon any such base accounts.

There is a plain covenant and transaction between Christ and him, whereby the
world is crucified unto him; and he, unto the world Gal 6.14.
. He not only openly professes a denial of ungodliness and worldly lusts, but
renounceth the hidden works of dishonesty, and walking in craftiness: yea all
alliance, and compliance with flesh or the world, that he may become a free
Burger, and Denison of heaven, and in all things converseth and walks as if
he were there already Phil. 3.20
.

Thus, this hypocrite is a perfect worldling; in his grearest perfection of
devotion the true Christian is heavenly in his greatest toyling upon earth The
one has his eye looking heavenward in outward appearance, yet minds and
loves the world and the things of the world; the other has his eye on heaven,
while conversant in the world. The one sets his heart on these things, but
not his hand; the other has an hand upon them, but his heart far above them.
The one forsakes the world, as the fisher man his station at sea, but goes no
further then where he may hope to let down his net to better purpose; the other
abandons it, as seeking a better country, without any mind to return.

CHAP. XII. The Ignorant Hypocrite Is he who wilfully refuses, Defin.
or wittingly concealeth the clear and distinct knowledge of good and evil,
that his ignorance may be an excuse for sin, and a discharge from Duty.
IGnorance and Hypocrisy seem incompatible, seeing hypocrisy supposes
cunning, which ignorance seems to deny. But, as no where more craft, than (as
men use to say) among clouted shoes (witness the Gibeonites; Josh. 9.5
) so shall we scarce find more hypocritical deceit than under the veil of
seeming simplicity. Of such is that complaint of God to his Prophet, Jer. 9.6.
Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit, through deceit they refuse to
know me, says the Lord.

Ignorance is a mother sin, a fruitful mother of sin; therefore used
sometimes to comprehend under it, not only the state of unregeneracy, which is
called the former lusts in our ignorance 1 Pet. 1.14
; and, of impenitency, called the times of ignorance Act. 17.30
; but, all manner of actual, and most highly provoking sins that men commit.
Therefore my people is gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge Esaias
5.13.
, the want whereof has led them on to all sins that had now spewed them out
of their own land.

In every sin and sinner there is much ignorance, either simple, or affected:
both of them being both sinful, and penal. Simple ignorance is the just
punishment of man's first seeking of forbidden knowledge, and an inlet to all
other sins; and, when he knows most, he knows nothing as he ought to know 1
Cor. 8.2
His very knowledge how to do well without well-doing, is both a sin Jam. 4.17
, and a great aggravation of sin. All that such a man does is sin, although
varnished over with some colors of virtue; so all he knows is ignorance,
although shadowed over with the name of knowledge. Eli s sons, being Priests
should have had their lips full of knowledge, because men should seek the Law
at their mouths, as from the messengers of the Lord of Hosts Mal. 2 7.
; yet were they sons of Belial, and that upon this account, they knew not the
Lord 1 Samuel 2.12
. Even the devil himself is a dunce in true understanding; because he
understands not what he should, or as he should: and so are all his imps,
notwithstanding their knowledge of his depths Rev. 2.24
, without withstanding of his wiles Ephesians 6.11
.

But that which makes an ignorant sinner an ignorant hypocrite, is affected
ignorance: he pretends to worship God, and to call God Father, while he does as
evil things as he can Jer. 3.4, 5.
: yet, when reproved for sin, he pleads ignorance: and, lest conscience within
should read him a curtain-lecture, he is willingly, and wilfully ignorant 2
Pet. 3.5.
, of what he should, and might know; that so he may sin more freely, and
conscience may not see what he does, and lash him for it. Other sinners are
ignorant, but this man loves ignorance, because he loves other sins, to which
his ignorance may be a cloak. Such ig^orance is the cause of not simple sins
alone; but, as Plato (although an Heathen) speaks (...).
, of barbarous illiterate, or brutish sins.

Who so blind as he that will not see! Wisdom cries, but fools love simplicity
Prove. 1.22
, for which God justly gives them over to a reprobate sense Romans 1.28.
; not only to neglect the means of knowledge, but to harden their hearts
against it.

And if God deal thus with Heathens without the Church, how much more will he
punish the ignorance of those within it, especially where he finds gray hairs
that understand not: ever learning 2 Timothy 3.7
, never learned!

A strange thing! that men should profess the service of God, without knowledge
of him or his will, or any desire to know it. Of such the Lord complains Hos.
8.12
, I have written to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a
strange thing. Light is come into the world, says our Savior John 3.19.
, and men love darkness rather then light. Yea, their eyes have they closed,
lest at any time they should see with their eyes Mat. 13.15.
. Such ignorance is a consequent of former sins, either of negligence,
wilfulness, or a resolution to wallow in the mire of sin (as in the days of
Noah, Mat. 24.38, 39.
) and therefore excuses not (so much as a tanto, but) aggravates the sin, and
adds to the heap of wrath. For if simple ignorance make a man equal to beasts
Psalm. 49.20.
; affected ignorance must needs render him, more brutish Esaias. 1.3
then the beasts that perish.

On the contrary, the true Christian acknowledging his ignorance, Differ.
bewailes it, and not only enclineth his ear to wisdom, but applies his
heart to understanding Prove. 2.2.
.

He is ignorant of many truths, but there is nothing needful or profitable of
which it may be said, he is willingly ignorant. He confesses, in the sense of
his ignorance and detestation of it, surely I am more brutish than any man, and

. But he pleases not himself, nor sits down in this condition; but prays, open
thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law Ps, 119.18
. Teach me O Lord the way of thy Statutes, and I shall keep it unto the end;
give me understanding, and I shall keep thy Law, Verse 33, 34
etc. He accounts ignorance both his sin, and his shame. As his sin, he
beggeth pardon for it; as his shame, he seeks not so much to hide, as remove it.

Thus, the Hypocrite winketh that he may not see, the true Christian anoints
his eyes with eye salve that he may see Rev. 3.18.
. The one walks in the dark, that no man may blame him for stumbling; the other
comes to the light, that there may be no occasion of stumbling in him 1 John
2.10
.

This hypocrite excuses sin, by saying, he little thought it had been a sin;
or, such a

The fools non putaram; I had not thought it, he takes to be a wise plea; and,
so it is, for fools, that neither know, nor care to know that they do evil:
This he thinks to put on as his cloak, when he says before the Angel, it was
an error. But God will strip him naked, as being angry at his voice Eccles. 5
6.
. For this is not a sin of ignorance, but a sin with ignorance committed
knowingly, which he would commit, although he knew it never so well; and
therefore neither seeks, or admits of better information, but continues
his resolution to hold on his practice. Nay, as Ahab, whose heart was set upon
going up to Ramoth Gilead, who ever should dissuade from it, could not be
content not to consult Micaiah, but did all he could to hinder Jehoshaphat from
advising with that Prophet 1 Kin. 22.7, 8
; so does this hypocrite endeavor what he can to keep others ignorant, when he
perceives them desirous of better instruction, and thereupon more unlikely to
serve his lusts after information.

Differ.
On the contrary, the child of God condemns himself the more for his ignorance,
when he has sinned.

Where ignorance was the ground or cause of sin, he bewails that as well as his
sin caused by it. So foolish was I, and ignorant, says he, I was as a beast
before thee Psalm. 73.22
. If his ignorance proceed from nature, he laments it; if of negligence, he
condemns himself the more for it, and makes haste to get rid of it, to prevent
further sinning. He ponders his way Prove. 4.26
, before he adventure on it, because he knows that all his ways are before
the eyes of the Lord, who pondereth all his goings Prove. 5.21.
. He w^^^ let no action pass wittingly and willingly, of which there is, or
may be any suspicion, but suspends the practice of it till his judgment be
informed and satisfied, that so what he does maybe of faith Romans 14 2, 3
.

Thus, this hypocrite makes ignorance his plea; the true Christian, his
lamentation; the one suspendeth information that he may continue his practice;
the other suspends practice, till better informed.

applauds himself in this, that what he does was never made out to him to be a
sin.

If others reprove his practice, as sinful; he never heard so much before,
which he would have you take for a sufficient apology. Let them who accuse him
of sin in it, make out this sinfulness, he knows no such thing. He thinks, he
need make no scruple, till they who accuse him, can prove that others have told
him of the danger of that very particular; and, that what he does, is lawful
enough until others prove it unlawful. What ever his judgment or conscience
tell him within, goes for nothing: you must prove who else has informed him,
before you condemn him.

Thus Saul would not be convinced of sin in sparing Agag, and the best of the
prey of the Amalakites, but stood to it stoutly against Samuel himself, that he
had obeyed the Commandment of the Lord, and gone the way which the Lord sent
him, because he had brought Agag the King of Amaleck, prisoner; and, utterly
destroyed the rest of the Amalakites 1 Samuel 15.20.
. No man had given him other charge touching Agag in particular, why then
should that be a crime? He had only a general warran^ to destroy the
Amalakites; and, what General ever did more, then lead the captive King who
fought against him, prisoner, even when he gives no quarter to the rest? But
that story sufficiently tells the hypocrite, that this will be so far from
excusing him to God, that it is no less then rebellion, which is as the sin of
witchcraft; and, stubborness, an iniquity that mounts up as high in Gods
account, as idolatry it self Verse 23.
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian attends more to conscience within, then to
men's silence without.

If conscience tell him it is evil, he will not meddle with it, although no man
rebuke him for it; yea, if conscience do but make the least scruple (which is
less then a doubt) of the lawfulness of it, he will not adventure on it,
although the thing in it self be not unlawful, but warrantable enough to others
whose judgments are better informed, and their consciences satisfied. That
which is no sin in them, would be sin in him, because not of faith Romans 14.23.
believing the lawfulness of it. He is as much afraid of evil that none but
his own conscience tells him to be such, as of that which all men proclaim to
be sinful. He measures not the lawfulness or unlawfulness of his actions by
other men's opinions, or practice, but by his own conscience, and the rule of
the Word. He is willing to receive intelligence, but will not make the want of
it his warrant.

Thus, this hypocrite would be thought to be good, because others forbear to
tell him of the evil of his way; the true Christian concludes himself to be an
evil doer, though none but his own conscience inform him that it is evil which
he does. The one makes other men's silence his warrant; the other makes the
voice of his own conscience his bar.

This hypocrite, if he, do any good, he neither considers why, nor cares to
know

He contents himself with doing what others commend, rather then enquires what
God does command, and so he does the work, as himself thinks best, not in the
manner which God prescribes. So that in truth, what Sophocles sometime said of
Eschilus, (Eschilus does well, but he knows not what he does,) may be well
applied to this hypocrite, somewhat he would feign do, but he knows not what,
nor how much. Sacrifices he will offer but knows not how. His zeal herein
runs beyond his knowledge. Will the Lord be pleased, says he, Micah 6, 7.
with thousands of rams, and ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my
first born for my transgression, the first fruit of my body for the sin of my
soul? Ignorant sot! Who has required this at thy hands? yet, as men having
lost their way, ride more swiftly in the wrong way, then they did in the right;
so it is natural to the ignorant hypocrite to outstrip the godly in bodily and
costly performances, as much as he comes short of the true Christian in the
right understanding of his duty.

Contrarily, the true Christians first care is to understand his way; Differ.
and then to walk in it.

The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way Prove 14.8.
; for blind obedience is brutish, and ignorant devotion is sottish. He is not
truly good that knows not why; nor can he exercise goodness with acceptance,
that knows not how to set about it. Therefore, first he will go up to the
mountain of the Lord, that he may teach him of his ways; and then, he walks in
his paths Esaias 2.3.
. He desires not the knowledge of evil, to learn to commit it, but to abhor it;
nor, the knowledge of good, for discourse, but direction. His prayer is to be
led in the way everlasting: and, his endeavor suitable, to walk everlastingly
in it. He is ready to follow any man as he follows Christ; but he will be
careful first to understand the way wherein Christ went before; and not
foolishly believe every Spirit, nor rashly run after every one that says, Lo
here is Christ; Mat. 24.23.
especially, if pretended to be in the desert, or in the secret chambers Ver.
26.
, and not in the Congregations of the Saints. He dares not forsake the public
Assemblies (as the manner of some is Heb. 10.25.
) and to go forth into the desert, in hope to find Christ, where Christ
himself sooner met with a devil to tempt him, than with good Angels to minister
unto him Mat. 4.1. and 11
.

Thus, this hypocrite is an Ape that imitates every body, but without
understanding; the true Christian is a child, that first goes to his father to
be taught the fear of the Lord Psalm. 34.11
, and then will be in that fear all the day long Prove. 23.17
. The one runs, without fear or wit; the other looks well to his goings.

This hypocrite uses more art not to know what is sin, than care not to
commit

If he can but keep conscience quiet, that it may not trouble him for
committing sin, he cares not what sin he commits; but that cannot be, unless
he keep the understanding dark, that conscience may not see what he does. His
hope is, that what the eye sees not, the heart will not rue. Hence he is very
careful to avoid information of the evil of that which he loves, and is loath
to leave. He shuns no discourse so much as that which condemns, or but
discovers the sinfulness of his way. If Paul offer to reason of righteousness
before Felix an unjust Judge; of temperance, before Drusilla, an intemperate
woman; and of judgment to come, which will be sure to meet with them both, he
trembles at the doctrine which he likes not, but not at the sin which he loves:
and his conclusion is, go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient
season, I will call for thee Act. 24.25.
.

Of all the Word of God, he least cares for the Law, because that brings the
knowledge of sin Romans 7.7
, which drives him out of his fools Paradise, where he thinks to cover his
nakedness with this fig-leaf of ignorance. This knowledge of sin is death to
him. For he was alive (at least in his own opinion) without the Law Romans 7.9
; he took himself to be a brave fellow that needed no repentance, because
ignorant of what he should repent of. But he knows, that if once the Law appear
to his understanding; and, the breach thereof to his coescience, he is a dead
man. Therefore he says (at least in his heart) to the Seers, see not; and to
the Prophets, prophecy not; speak unto us smooth things, prophecy deceit, get
ye out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the holy one of Israel to
cease from before us. He will rather part with God than with his lust, because
he loves his lust more than God; and there is no shorter way to part with God,
and to keep his lust, than to keep himself ignorant of both.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians care is to get more knowledge of sin, that
he may the more shun and abhor it.

He is so far from being afraid, that information should awaken conscience and
disturb him for sin; that he prays and strives to get more and more knowledge
of the nature and quality of what he practices, that conscience may give him
no rest till it has beaten him out of every sinful way. He knows that no
conscience is good but that which is first rowsed by the Law to make him to
take a full view of in himself that glass (which will present him ugly and
lothsom enough;) and after, is pacified by faith.

He desires to see his sins, that his heart may rue them, and to take a full
view of his enemies, that he may the better avoid them: and then only counts
himself qualified for mercy, when he is able to say in truth, and with deep
grief of soul, as for my iniquities I know, them Esaias 59.11
, and my sin is ever before me Psalm. 51.3
. Therefore he not only consents to the Law that it is holy and good Romans 7.16
, but he delights in it, when most sharp and severe against his most special
corruptions Ver. 22.
, and can as well brook, yea as sincerely desire and pray for the checks and
rebukes of it, as David did, the smitings of the righteous, which he esteemed a
kindness, and an excellent oil, which should not break his head Psalm. 141.5
, but heal his heart. He is resolved not to help the ungodly, nor to love them
that hate the Lord 2 Cor. 29.2.
, I mean, his fleshly lusts that war against the soul 1 Pet. 2.11
. He will not take part with his corruptions against the Law; but, with the
Law, against his corruptions; and therefore he looks himself often in that
perfect spiritual mirror, that he may have a true view of himself, and more
perfectly discover how much he is carnal, and how far sold under sin Romans 7.14
; and, that sin by the Commandment might appear how exceeding sinful it is Ver.
13.
.

Thus, this hypocrite will rather put out his own eyes, than be willing to see
what may take him off from his lusts; the true Christian incessantly cries out,
as the blind men, unto Christ, Lord, that mine eyes may be opened Mat. 20.33
. The one hates knowledge because he loves sin; the other loves knowledge that
he may the more hate sin.

This hypocrite is never without an invective against those that are more
studious of knowledge.

Who is the better, says he, for knowledge? none worse then they who know
most; for my part, I mean as well as the best of them, and hope to go to heaven
as well as the wisest of them.

Thus, he out-faceth knowledge, with his bold ignorance; as if of the two,
ignorance were the better. And what the Popish Bishops in this land, heretofore
practiced upon the Kings and Nobility, suffering them to live in ignorance,
whereby they might not boggle at any loosnesse or wickedness of life, that so
the Clergy might afterward confess, and fleece them to purpose; this
hypocrite practices upon himself and others with less hope of gain: for he
does not keep a roll or register of the evils that he, or others commit, that
it may after be brought to confession and penance; but, he strives to take away
pen, ink, and paper from conscience, that nothing may stand upon account to be
confessed, or punished; and, to teach men, as Alcibiades taught Themistocles,
to study rather to give no account, them to trouble themselves to give any,
when they know they can give none that is good.

Thus, as sometimes Bellarmine doubted not to say, that faith is better defined
by ignorance than by knowledge (because, if men once come to know what he and
his fellows would persuade them to believe, they would soon give over
believing;) so this hypocrite decries knowledge, because he knows it cannot but
condemn what he has a mind to practice.

Of the same stamp are the Jesuitical fratres ignorantiae, or lay-Jesuites
(which are not a few in any country where the Jesuits can practice) who are
taught that ignorance is a modesty best becoming lay Christians (as if it were
with us as with Heathenish Pagans of old, that held it a high point of
presumption to enquire what that God is whom they worshipped,) and that it was
fitter for the Oxen of the Clergy to plow in the understanding of the
Scriptures; and, safest for these lay asses to feed by, on the thistles of
implicit faith, that so, in the womb of ignorance they may better feed and
breed the moon-calf of blind devotion. Miserable cattle! but, most cruel
guides, who not content to keep away the key of knowledge, that might enable
them to see; persuade them that blindness is better then sight!

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian pronounces them blessed who are best acquainted with God
and his Will.

Blessed (says he) are they that dwell in thy house, they will still be
praising of thee Psalm. 84.4
. The child of God, considering that the soul being without knowledge cannot
be good Prove. 19.2
, labors to grow in knowledge, that he may thrive in grace 2 Pet. 4.18.
. And, because the just shall live by his faith Hab 2.4
, not by the faith of another, therefore he will be careful to know whom he
has trusted 2 Timothy 1.12
, and what he believes.

To know and to obey, are branches of the same, yea, of every Commandment.
Blessedness is appropriated to both, and not to be had by either alone. If ye
know these things, happy are ye, if you do them. He will not therefore break
one part of the Commandment, that he may imagine to himself a dispensation from
the other; but, be sure to join both, that he may be more sure of the blessing.
He knows that to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is
sin. Yet he will not therefore condemn knowledge, as if that were a sin; but
join knowledge and practice, that he may avoid sin; and he accounts it as great
an evil wilfully not to know to do good; as to do evil, notwithstanding his
knowledge.

Thus, this hypocrite disgraceth knowledge, that he may countenance sin, the
true Christian advances knowledge, that he may suppress evil; the one prefers
ignorance, that he may sin more freely, the other, studies knowledge, that he
may cashire sin more fully.

This hypocrite affects to be thought ignorant of what he knows well enough.

As old men sometimes (making advantage of infirmity) feign themselves deaf,
when they hear well enough; and, dark, while they see; so this hypocrite will
seem ignorant of what he knows, that he may call light darkness without
offense, and go on to do evil without control. Thus Cain, when asked even of
God himself, where is thy brother, answers, I know not, am I my brothers
keeper Genesis 4.9
? And so every hypocrite ready to pretend and to plead, Behold I knew it not
Prove. 24.12
, although he cannot but know, that he that pondereth the heart, and keeps
his soul, does know that he knows it.

The Pharisees knew that Christ was a Teacher sent from God, as Nicodemus
confesses John 3.2.
; yet they pretend that they knew not whence he was John 9 29.
; but are shamefully reproved for their wilful and counterfeit ignorance by him
that was borne blind Ver. 30, etc.
. Thus, most notoriously tardy were they in this kind, in answer to Christ's
question touching John's baptism, whence it was? whereto they could not without
prejudice and shame to themselves give a positive answer, whether true, or
false; they fly to this shameful shelter, we cannot tell Mat 21.27


This answer is often used in hope to cut off all further demands, or questions;
and, to exempt from danger, where idle servants are more willing to make use of
their wits, than to put forth their pains, or to confess the truth, and desire
rather not to be set on work, especially in case of imminent danger, than to
acknowledge what they know. A fault wherein even Peter (through the infirmity
of fear) sought to shroud himself; first, dissembling his knowledge of the
matter wherewith he was charged, I know not what thou say Mat. 27.70
; and, when that would not serve his turn, he adds, I know not the man Ver.
72.
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian will never make pretended ignorance a cloak
for sin.

He will give glory to God and confess to his own shame, wherein he has been
overtaken, and not be unwilling to be known of his knowledge. He will not hide
his talent upon pretense that he knows not how to use and improve it; nor
adventure upon sin, upon the account of pretended ignorance. Not that he knows
all or so much as he ought to know, but will not dissemble his knowledge to
avoid duty, or to commit sin. He is willing to make known not his knowledge
only, but his ignorance too; not to boast of the one, but to set it on work;
nor to bear himself out on the other, but to be rid of it; and he holds it meet
to be said unto God, That which I see not, teach thou me, If have done iniquity
I will do no more Job 34.32
.

Thus, this hypocrite seeks to hide knowledge, that his knowledge may not
way-lay his sin; and, his seeming ignorance excuse from duty; the true
Christian will not conceal his knowledge either of duty, thereby to avoid it;
or of sin thereby to commit it. The one will not know what he does, that he may
do what he seems not to know; the other confesses his knowledge of what he
does, even when he knows that he has done what he ought not.

takes upon him the knowledge of what he knows not.

Ignorance is a blot and a shame where ever it is lodged; therefore this
hypocrite, that he might not be thought stark blind, says, he sees John 9 41.
. And what does he see? not what is; but, what he imagines, a reed shaken with
the wind Mat. 11 7
, instead of the Baptist; and to make men believe that he sees, he will rashly
and suddenly shoot the bolt of his censure against any that comes in his way,
in reference co God and Religion; as if mere zeal for God and his glory put him
upon it. Give God the praise, say the blind seers to him that was born blind,
We know that this man (meaning Christ, who knew no sin) is a sinner John 9.24.
. This they pronounce with so much confidence, as if they knew all things, who
by this declared themselves more blind, than he that was born so.

And yet, they dare challenge any man that dares pronounce them blind; Are we
blind also? Verse 40
as if Christ himself durst not so to affirm. But, he that for judgment came
into the world: that they which think they see, might be made blind John 2.39
, that is, might discover the gross blindness that is on their hearts Ephesians.
4.18
, as well as in their understandings, to all the world; and, be left to perish
in it, even upon this very account, because they say, we see, extends the same
judgment to all such hypocrites who take upon them to be teachers of the Law,
yet understand not what they say, nor whereof they affirm 1 Timothy 1.7
.

Where he does see, there he is willingly blind; and where he is blind, there
he is the greatest pretender to sight. And how does he employ this seeming
seeing? In carping at things which he knows not Jude 10.
, and in speaking evil of the things that he understands not 2 Pet. 2.12
. Not so much because the things are evil, as because those that do them are in
better esteem than he would have them. And here, who so bold as blind bayard!
who so confident as a blind Pharisee! who so true to the devils interest as he
that is willingly blind!

Thus, the Pharisees (more glad of the occasion, then grieved for the offense)
carp at the disciples, who for extreme hunger, plucked and eat some ears of
corn, as they passed through the corn field on the Sabbath day, for having done
an unlawful act Mat. 12.1, 2
. Howbeit, the sin here lay not in the disciples profanation, but in the
ignorance of their accusers. David did as much, nay more, in his hunger, in
eating the shewbread, which in ordinary course, was lawful to none but only to
the Priests Verse 3, 4
. If the Pharisees reply, we blame them not for eating; but, for plucking the
ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands Luke 6.1
, which was a servile work, therefore unlawful upon that day. Here was another
piece of their ignorance: for, the Priests did more; yea, did as much bodily
service on the Sabbath in the very Temple it self, as on any two of the weeks
days; (for on the Sabbath they doubled their Sacrifices.) yet were blameless
Mat. 12.5
; not so much as any of these blind Pharisees ever found fault with those
Priests, who so deeply censured the disciples of Christ for a far less
matter. And why so? nothing but ignorance was the cause of this cavil, as our
Lord plainly tells them, If ye had known what this means, I will have mercy,
and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless Verse 7.
.

This hypocrite will never be thought ignorant of any thing needful to be
known; but either thinks he knows as much as he needs, and therefore neglects
the means of knowing more: (for, what, says he, can all the Preachers in the
world teach me more, than to love God above all, and my neighbor as my self;
which, I do?) or, that all others are ignorant in companion of him, and
therefore disdaines their trial of a reason of the hope that is in him, lest he
should bewray his own ignorance; or else, (either as apprehending the
difficulty of learning; or, out of pride, or shame Multa scienda nesciuntur,
aut sciendi incuria, aut discendi defidea, aut inquirendi, verecundia. Ber.
to lay open his ignorance) he refuses to make any inquiries to know more.

On the contrary, the true Christian confesses his ignorance, even when he
knows most; Differ.
that he may learn more knowledge.

He does not vainly pretend ignorance, as hawking at praise of his knowledge;
but, humbly confesses his wants, that he may get into the way of supply. He
knows that the way to wisdom is an ingenuous acknowledgement of our own
folly; and, that if any man would be (what too many pretend, yet are not) truly
wise, he must become a fool (that is, acknowledge his ignorance and folly as
truly sensible of it,) that he may be wise 1 Cor. 3 18
. Wisdom calls to the simple, that is, to him that knows and acknowledges
his simplicity; Whosoever is simple let him turn in hither Prove. 9.4
. It is a shame to seem ignorant, but a greater shame and sin too to
continue ignorant, rather then to discover ignorance that it may be cured.

Some have not the knowledge of God, says the Apostle to the Corinthians, I
speak this to your shame 1 Cor. 15.34
. Therefore in the child of God one shame drives out another; an ingenuous
shame becoming grace, drives out sinful shame unworthy of a gracious heart. The
sinful shame of continuing ignorant, is driven out by the ingenuous shame to be
found ignorant. And so the confession of folly is an introduction to wisdom.
Surely I am more brutish then any man, and have not the understanding of a man
Prove. 30.2
; not as denying the knowledge which he had; but as not having attained all
that he needed. He knew but in part, and that part was so little in comparison
of what he knew not, that (to speak as he did, comparatively,) it was nothing;
as well knowing that such confession of ignorance was the best preparative to
more knowledge. He is a true disciple of Christ that is always a learner, and
whole word is, not as if I had already attained, or were already perfect Phil.
3.12.
. Knowledge presumed is a sure symptom of ignorance which is incorrigible; but
ignorance confessed is a clear evidence of some saving knowledge, and an inlet
to more.

Thus, this hypocrite pretends unto knowledge, yet is ignorant; the true
Christian confesses his ignorance, even when he has in part attained to true
saving knowledge: the one boasts of what he has not, the other bewailes what
he has too much of: the one by giving himself out to be a sciolist, continues
a sot; the other by acknowledging his ignorance, continually grows in the
knowledge of Jesus Christ.

This hypocrite is most curious to pry into things forbidden, and careless to
know things

This he learnt of our first parents (whom all men are more ready to imitate in
evil, than in good) who were more inquisitive after forbidden knowledge, then
careful of an express command to avoid that experiment; not through any
previous corruption in their nature, but in their actual departing from the
holy Commandment delivered unto them; whereby their persons infected their
nature, as afterward their nature infected both their persons, and the whole
nature of man.

He is more apt to know of Christ how few or many shall be saved Luke 13.23
, than careful to learn of him to be meek and lowly, that he may find rest for
his own soul in particular Mat. 11 9
. He is more inquisitive to know who shall be greatest in the Kingdom of
heaven Mat. 18.1
, than to get thither himself. He takes more pains in finding out the day of
judgment (of which day and hour knows no man Mat. 24.36
, no not the Son of man himself, as the Son of man) when it shall be, then what
manner of person he ought to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
looking for, and hastening to the coming of the day of God 2 Pet. 3.1.12
. He busieth himself in matters of controversy, being unable to answer to
points of Catechism. He is hot upon Enthusiasmes, revelations, and new lights;
but, careless enough of faith, repentance, mortification of sin, and of
obedience to the revealed will of God contained in his Word.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is most careful of things revealed.

He remembers who said, Deuteronomy. 29.29.
The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are
revealed, belong unto us and to our children for ever, to do them. Therefore he
busieth not himself in things too high Psalm. 131.1
, because he thinks not of himself more highly then he ought to think, but
thinks soberly Romans 12.3
, and speaks humbly, according to the (analogy, or) proportion of faith Ver. 6.
. And what ever his knowledge be, yet he will so much mind the teaching and
knowledge of one Christ alone, as revealed in the Gospel, as if he had
determined to know nothing save Jesus Christ and him crucified 1 Cor. 2 2
. He will not neglect prophecies, not yet fulfilled, but accounts them to be
faithful and true Rev. 20, 6
; but he accounts them most blessed, that do his Commandments, that they may
have right to the tree of life, which he rather believes, than too curiously
searches into.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a rambling travailer that is more inquisitive
after the manners and customs of foreign countries, than careful to
understand his own; the true Christian is more diligent to be well verst at
home, than to be exact abroad: the one, with the Philistine, pries into the
Ark, with neglect of the Covenant, and is smitten with a curse; the other
worshippeth at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, where God more
manifestly appeared to all, and so receives the blessing: The one intrudeth
into those things which he has not seen, being vainly puffed up of his fleshly
mind Col. 2.18
; the other contents himself with what all may see, if with humility they seek
what is to be seen in the Word

CHAP. XIII. The Profane Hypocrite Is he that suborneth Religion to bear false
witness against her self. Defin.

HE takes up Religion for no other end but to countenance profaneness. Not
that Religion her self can be so abused; but that he does what he can to put
her to it: he cloatheth his own practice, and imagination in the habit of
Religion, and makes her his Knight of the Post to delude both the world and
himself. Yea, so impudent is this hypocrite, that he fears not to challenge
Gods own approbation of all his villainy, even contrary to his own purity. For
so the Lord charge him, Psalm 50.20
Thou thoughtest I was altogether such an one as thy self; as liking, and
allowing all that this Hypocrite does. And though both the world and his own
conscience are witnesses of his lewdness, and that he hates to be reformed;
yet because he takes the Covenant of God in his mouth, he blesses himself,
and thinks he need not be better, (yea, not less then a sin to attempt it,)
and that he has attained the true pitch of piety; and, to go further, were but
curiosity and singularity.

The Publican and the Pharisee meet in him and both at their worst; a Publican,
in the practice of evil; yet a Pharisee, in opinion of his own goodness Prove.
20.6
: Pure enough in his own eyes Prove. 30.12
, because he makes some show of purity; yet, utterly impure, because no whit
purged from his filthiness. Out of respect to his credit he professes to know
God, and to have some acquaintance with him: but, out of love to his lusts, in
works he denies him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work
reprobate Tit. 1.16.
.

None so wicked, but while he lies wallowing in wickedness, he is apt to think
well of, and to be in love with himself. In that rabble of lewd symptoms of the
worst times, wherein men are covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
disobedient to parents, unthankful, unho^y, without natural affection, etc.
self-love leads the ring; and, a show, or form of godliness 2 Timothy 3.2, 3, etc.
closes it up. A show indeed; but, without substance, a form without power,
as if it were Religion enough not to be a professed Infidel or Atheist; to salute
God at Church, although he defy him at home.

Thus, though in David's opinion, wickedness her self says to this man, That
there is no fear of God before his eyes; yet he flattereth himself in his own
eyes, until his iniquity be found, even by men as well as by God, to be
hateful Psalm. 36.1, 2.
; so that there is no difference between him and a pure Atheist, save only in
an external show of an halfing, halting profession of God, with a secret hatred
of the life of godliness. For every hypocrite is in heart an Atheist, and
would be so in profession too, if he durst: but therefore is he an hypocrite,
because he dares not openly profess, what secretly he is.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian had rather endure any thing than call in Religion to bear
him out in the least sin.

He had rather perish, than God should deny, or be unlike himself. Let God,
says he, be true and every man a liar Romans 3.4
. He had rather any discredit should light upon himself and his action, than
that Religion should suffer in the least by being put to tell a lie for him, as
if it were not a sin, or he were not guilty, when he has done any wickedness;
and that Religion would be his warrant, and bear him out in it. He knows that
God is of purer eyes then to behold evil, that he cannot look on iniquity Hab.
1.13.
, without abhorrency, and detestation; and, that he hates all workers of
iniquity Psalm. 5.5.
. Therefore he dares not call in God to patronize his covetousness,
worldliness, or any other sinful practice, although in him but an infirmity;
but lays himself low before God, as having highly dishonored him by the least
deviation from the holy Commandment.

He that dares not tell a lie for God, much less dares to put God upon telling
a lie for him, as the profane hypocrite does, when he fathers upon God, and the
impulsion of his spirit the evil he does, and wresteth the Scripture to
countenance whatever sin he commits; especially when he is to deal with men
that profess honor to God, and obedience to his Word.

When he is purged, he yet thinks not himself clean enough. When he is pure in
most men's eyes, he is not so in his own, because he comes not up fully to the
purification of the true Sanctuary. Yea, when he is pure in Gods eyes Cant.
4.10.
, because washed with the blood of Christ perfectly, unto Justification; and,
with the Spirit of Christ truly, unto Sanctification; (and happily too pure,
in the eyes of some men, for which they speak evil of him 1 Pet. 4.4.
, Yet still he cries out, wash me, much-wash me (that is, more thoroughly) from
mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin Psalm. 51.2.
; and, create in me a clean heart, O God Ver. 10.
: wash not only my feet from grosser abominations; but, my hands from lesser
sins; and, my head too, from vain thoughts and all contrivance of the least
evils. Thus, he is still complaining of himself, and justifying God; he holds
up Gods honor and the credit of Religion, whatever become of himself. And when
he has most need of a cloak to cover his nakedness, he will never call God to
cast Religion upon him to hide his shame; nor seek patronage from that which he
knows condemns his practice.

Thus, this hypocrite profaneth Religion to save his own credit; the true
Christian sets more by the honor of Religion, than by his own life; the one
strives to make God and Religion like himself; the other upholds the honor of
Religion by acknowledging his wanderings, and striving to be like unto God.

This Hypocrite will not simply deny God; but refuses to own such a God as his
Word propounds and describes.

It is not the voice of every Atheist to say, there is no God; yet this fool,
in his heart, says no less in effect. He that makes God an Idol, denies him
to be. For, an idol is nothing in the world 1 Cor. 8.4.
He that moulds a God in his brain, cannot own the true God in his heart: But
makes a God to suit with his own lusts in hope to meet with no other to punish
his sins. A God he will have, that he may not be worse then his neighbors; but
the true God, he will none of, that he may not be divorced from his lusts.

It is said of the Tyrians, that they bound their gods with chains, that they
might not in their greatest need, pass over to the enemy; and, of the Romans,
that they used to court the Gods of every country with whom they had war, in
hope to draw them over to their party. This hypocrite deals no better with the
true God, whom he likes better in a chain of his own fiction, than upon the
throne of Gods own institution; and is better pleased to have him at command,
to countenance his sin, than that God should command him off from his sin.
He will court him, in hope to draw him to allow of his sinful practices; but
not with any desire to become like unto God in the hatred of sin. Rather then
God should put him out of his own ways; his heart says unto God, Depart from
me, for I desire not the knowledge of thy ways Job 21.14.
.

He will allow him to be God, but deny his attributes of omniscience, justice,
hatred of sin, holiness, etc. He says Job 22.13, 14
, how does God know, can he judge through the dark cloud? thick clouds are a
covering to him that he sees not, and he walks in the circuit of heaven, not
coming down to behold things below: unless perhaps in some extraordinary case,
as in that of Sodom Genesis 18.21
. He says in his heart (although he dwell in Jerusalem) The Lord will not do
good, neither will he do evil Ephesians. 1.12
; as if, with Gallio, he cared for none of these things Acts 18.17.
. And so confident is he that there is nothing to be gotten by more than he
has a mind to perform; that he adds further, It is in vain to serve God, or,
to walk mournfully before the Lord of Hosts. Therefore, he accounts the proud
(who take not so much pains in Gods service as he has done, yet fares better,
much more) happy Mal. 3.14, 15.
; and pronounces that it is better with those that work wickedness, than with
him; for they are set up and advanced, when he is kept low; yea, that their
condition that tempt God, is better then his; for they are delivered out of
troubles, when he sticks fast in the mire.

If God will be content to favor good fellows, not to be too severe against
drunkards, whore-mongers, riotous persons, covetous mammonists, etc. then, the
Lord shall be his God. If he will give him leave to strain a point of
conscience to bow down in the house of Rimmon, to dispense with honesty, if by
swearing, lying, flattering, bribing, purloyning, circumventing, he may gain
profit, pleasure, preferment; and, under the vizard of Saint, play the devil;
he will then give God as much service as he will, even an hecatomb of
sacrifices, and offerings, so many as shall make him weary to receive them Esaias
1.11.
.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian takes his notion of God from none but God himself.

If God once say, this is my name Exodus 2.15
, he owns him by no other. If God will be called Ishi; (my husband) the true
Christian will call him no more Baali Hos. 2.16
, (my Lord, that is such an one as is but an idol of their own imagination,)
because the Lord has taken away the names of Baalim out of his mouth Verse 17.
; yea, out of his heart too; for he now looks upon God, as himself describes
himself; The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and
abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty
Exodus 34.6, 7
; that is, that retains his guilt by going on in iniquity, because God is
merciful.

He owneth no God but whom he finds in Gods Book. He will not go to School to
the flesh, to learn what God (who is a Spirit) is; as well-knowing that the
wisdom of the flesh is an enemy; yea, enmity it self against God Romans 8.7.
; and enemies seldom give right characters of those with whom they are at
enmity. He will not so presume upon his mercy, as to deny his justice; nor bear
himself out upon his goodness, so as to slight his severity Romans 11.22
. He owns him in all his attributes, fears him in all duties, loves him in all
his properties, serves him in all his Commandments, and will have the true God
for his God, or none at all Psalm. 73.25.
. This God is his God for ever and ever, and shall be his guide even unto death
Psalm. 48.14
.

Thus, this hypocrite makes a god of his own to go before him Exodus 32.1
; the true Christian strives to own the true God before whom he may walk in the
light of the living Psalm. 56.13.
. The one seeks to dethrone God, and to set an idol in his room; the other
abhors idols by whomsoever set up, and exalts God by whomsoever dethroned.
The one will admit of so much of God as will serve for his purpose; the other
will have whole God, or he is not for his purpose.

The profane hypocrite pleads conscience to warrant licentiousness.

So cunning is corruption grown in this hypocrite, that he hopes to make it
inherit incorruption; and, to make conscience an advocate for lewdness.
Christian liberty is with him a good occasion and warrant to gratify the flesh
Gal. 5.13
, or a fair cloak of malitiousnesse 1 Pet. 2.16
. Thus, he turns grace into lasciviousness Jude 4.
. Because Christ has set us free from the curse and bondage of the Law, he
concludes for Libertinisme; and, that every one may live as he list: the
Familist concludes he can now no more sin then Christ himself; the
Anabaptists, that Christians are no longer to be under a compulsory civil
Government; the Antinomian, that he is no longer under the Law, as a rule of
life to him that is in Christ.

Even among our selves men are risen up, speaking perverse things to draw
disciples after them; for, there are who reject the whole Law; others, one
Commandment at least.

For, as the Papists have thrust out the second Commandment that forbids
worshipping of images, so this hypocrite thrusts out the fourth, that commands
the public worship of God in the time prescribed of God, that it has much ado
to keep a place in the Decalogue. And this, out of pretense of conscience to
maintain the liberty purchased by Christ. He pleades that now, not one day of
seven alone, but the whole life of a C^^istian must be a Sabbath, yet if we
look narrowly into his carriage, he lives, for the most part, not sabbata,
after a sabbatical manner; but Bacchanalia, in all excess of riot; and
heathenish deboshscerie, under a light tincture of some overly profession of
Christianity at large.

But, no wonder to see this hypocrite to begrudge God his time, who grudgeth
him his heart; and, that he delights not in God, who bethinks the time and
means of conversing with him. For the property of the profane hypocrite is, to
be, if not so far from God as he would be, yet to be as little while in his
company, and to as little purpose as may be: Counterfeit piety affects paucity
of precepts, and loose hearts make void as many rules as they can, and the rest
as wide as their profane brains are able to stretch them.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian, being called unto liberty, uses it, not
as an occasion to the flesh.

Every point of Religion, even liberty it self, binds a Christian heart unto
duty, not lose it from obedience. If he were loose before, he is now under a
bond; no longer his own, but a Covenant-servant to Christ, who has freed him
from the servitude of sin, but bound him to the service of himself, He that is
called, being free, is Christ's servant 1 Cor. 7.22.
, He is bought with a price, and therefore glorifies God in his body, and in
his Spirit 1 Cor. 6.20.
, because both are Gods due.

Has the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made him free from the Law
of sin, and of death Romans 8.2.
? that he is no longer a slave to the one, nor subject to the st^ng of the
other; he then resolves more heartily and cheerfully to give himself unto God
as one alive from the dead; and his members as instruments of righteousness
unto God Romans 6.13.
; so that now, being made free from sin, and become the servant of God, he
has his fruit unto holiness, that his end may be everlasting life Ver. 22.
.

Has the Lord discharged him every seventh day from the cares and toils of
this life, to serve him only? he will make the Sabbath a delight, the holy of
the Lord honorable Esaias 58.13.
, and consecrate it as glorious to the Lord; for albeit man's corrupt nature
does most furiously kick against the spiritual observation of that day (which
is one strong argument of the morality of it;) yet knowing that no spiritual
duty was ever retracted or discharged, but rather established and enforced by
the Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel, who came to call all to worship God more
exactly in spirit and in truth; he turns away his foot from doing his own
pleasure on Gods holy day, not doing his own works, nor speaking his own words.
Nor can he spare that which this hypocrite so prodigally pares away. Thus being
by the Son made free, he is free indeed John 8.36.
; but his freedom is to curb sin, and to exalt holiness; to serve Christ,
and not his own lusts.

Thus this hypocrite uses Religion as a file to get off his fetters; the true
Christian, as a bond, to tie him closer unto God; the one pleads conscience
against her self; the other takes part with conscience against such corrupt
plea's.

from the riches of free grace, concludes continuance in sin.

The better God is to him, the worse he is to God. The more God causes the
light of his countenance to shine upon his darkness, the more he seeks to
extract darkness out of that light. He turns grace into poison, light into
darkness, life into death, heaven into hell. If where sin abounded, grace much
more abounded Romans 5.20.
; he makes this graceless conclusion from it, Let us continue in sin that
grace may abound Chap. 6.1.
. And no marvail; for, even when he hears the words of Gods curse, he
blesses himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in
the imagination of mine own heart, to add drunkenness to thirst Deuteronomy. 29.19.
. God is merciful, and receives all penitent sinners, come they in when they
will for their pardons; then he concludes to go on in sin for the present,
and to repent hereafter, as if he had both repentance and mercy at command.
This is, for Gods love, to become his enemy; and to return hatred for his good
will. When a man finding that the more and greater sins God pardons, the
more the glory of his grace and mercy is advanced, he shall upon that account
make work for mercy by adding sin unto sin, this is to despise the riches
of his goodness, and forbearance, and long suffering, all which should lead
him to repentance Romans 2.4.
.

On the contrary, the true Christian fears God most, when God is most kind.

The fear of the Lord is his treasure Esaias. 33.6
, as well as his wisdom Ps. 111.18.
. And he accounts it his wisdom, not only to praise the Lord for his goodness
Psalm. 107.8.
, but to fear him and his goodness Hos. 3.5.
, that is, for his goodness. He is one of those that loves most, because one
to whom much is forgiven Luke 7.43 and ver. 47.
. But the hypocrite to whom little is forgiven, loves little, that is, not at
all.

If the Hypocrite say, God is good, I may make therefore the more bold with him;
the true Christian says, God is good, therefore I will fear him. If the
hypocrite say, God loves me, therefore I will sue out a dispensation to hate
him, the Christian will conclude the contrary, and say, if God love me, I will
love him who loved me first 1 John 4.19
. If he cannot love God so much as he would, yet he is glad of pardon for not
loving so much as he should; and no less desirous of grace from God to serve
God more, for the grace that he finds in God to be more and more toward him.
He is a great admirer of grace given, because that comes nearest to the nature
of God, and therefore is restless, till through grace he has augmented his
service.

Thus, this hypocrite sets a price upon grace according to what it is likely to
produce him in the matter of sin; the true Christian values grace according to
what sin it is able to curb and suppress. The one makes grace a baud to sin;
the other, a spur to duty.

This Hypocrite gathers arguments from outward blessings, that God approves of
his

As Leah sometimes, called her fifth son Issachar, as a reward from God for
giving her maid to her husband Genesis 30.18
. So this hypocrite takes wealth and worship (I may say, in some sense) too
kindly from God, abusing both his patience and bounty, by looking upon them as
a reward of his wickedness, and blesses God for that for which he is a debtor
to the devil. Thus, when through covetousness the shepherds of Israel made
merchandise 2 Pet. 2.3
of the flock of the slaughter, slaying them, yet not holding themselves
guilty, they sold them, and said, blessed be the Lord, for I am rich Zech.
11.4, 5
.

If when this hypocrite consents with a thief, partakes with adulterers in
their filthiness, gives his mouth to evil, and his tongue to deceit, evil
speaking, and slandering, God keeps silence; this wretch presently concludes
that God likes all this well enough, and is altogether such an one as himself
Ps. 50.21
. Prodigious impiety! to seek to draw in God, not only to bear witness unto
wickedness, but to bear a part in it!

In this he is worse than the Atheist, that when he thrives in wickedness,
attributes all to his own wit and industry: or, than those who take up all of
them with the angle, they catch (all, as fish) in their net, and gather them in
their drag, therefore they rejoice and are glad; therefore they sacrifice unto
their net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion is
fat, and their meat plenteous Hab. 1.15, 16
. Here, although God be neglected, he is yet not so far abused, as to be made
an accessory to the lusts of men.

When he thrives in bringing evil devices to pass, he is no better then the
harlotry Nun, of whom it is reported, that being the mother of three pregnant
Peter's Comestor, Gratian, Lumbard.
, she could not find in her heart to repent of her threefold sin of
uncleanness: for, he boasts of his hearts desire, and blesses the coveteous
whom God abhors Psalm. 10.3.
; yea, blesses himself in his own wickedness.

The ground of which unnatural evil is, another more natural, the over-prizing
of these earthly things, as if outward prosperity were a thing so precious as
none could have, but such as are highly in Gods favor, whereas many times his
enemies enjoy more thereof then his dearest friends and followers. He considers
not, that (as Saint Augustine excellently,) God gives riches sometimes to good
men, that we may not suppose them to be simply evil; but, more often to evil
men, that we might not conclude them to be absolutely good. Therefore as the
Turks use to give censure of actions from the temporal success; so this
hypocrite conculdes favor from success; and if the success be ill (although
in evil;) he is apt to complain of hard dealing: Wherefore have I fasted, says
he, and thou see not? wherefore have I afflicted my soul, and thou take no
knowledge Esaias 58 3
?

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian dares not conclude either love or hatred by
all that is before him Eccl. 9.1
.

However others thrive in wickedness, he dares not imitate them in sin, in
hope of like success; nor to accuse God of partiality, because he fares not
alike. If sometimes he takes upon him with Jeremy Jerem. 12.1
, to plead with God, touching his judgments and strange dispensations; he
first lays down this for an irrefragable conclusion, Righteous art thou O
Lord, although the way of the wicked prosper, and they are happy that deal very
treacherously. What he cannot give a reason of, he will yet justify; and, what
he cannot fathom, he will with silence admire, not murmur at it.

If David or Asaph in a passion, stumble at the prosperity of the wicked; he
will not impiously infer, that therefore the proud are happy; or, more in Gods
books than the godly; but, from sense and reason, by faith he appeals to
Sanctuary; and there he understands their end Psalm. 73.17
, and soon puts an end to his envy and folly in mistaking their condition and
Gods purpose toward them. There he finds another Shekel to weigh his and
their actions by, then to lay them in the balance of success. He sees the
common proverb daily verified, that fortune (or rather providence) favors
fools, whose prosperity in the end shall destroy them, and therefore he
resolves to be as far from imitating as envying of them.

If at any time he compare his course with the event, he learneth this wisdom.
If in an evil course, evil befall him, he blesses God who has hedged his way
with thorns and made a wall that he might not find his paths Hos. 2.6
, and thereby checked, and restrained him. If good befall him in an evil way, he
fears that God has given him over to his own lust Psalm. 81.10
, concluding that there can hardly be on earth a greater judgment than to do
evil, and fare well. Thus Augustine trembled when he considered the
extraordinary wit and parts in his base child, to think what God meant to him,
infusing so precious a soul in so impure a conception.

On the other hand, if in a good course he thrives, he takes it as a favor
that must oblige him, but not as evidence of so much love as may satisfy him:
if he meet with evil in a good way, he will not alter his judgment of the
righteousness of God, but rather suspect himself guilty of some evil that
withholds good things from him: or that the things, though good, is not good
for him; and that to him the yoke Lam. 3 27
is better then the stirrup. He will take it as a trial, not as a reproof; as
an exercise of his faith, not as a discouragement in well-doing.

Thus the hypocrite as impious Domitian (who thought the gods favored
Sacrilege, because he had such a good gale of wind and weather, after he had
robbed their Temples;) thinks God likes well enough of prosperous wickedness,
because he does not presently avenge it: the true Christian knows that he hates
it even when he does most for him that commits it. The one goes on in
wickedness, because he thriveth; the other fears it the more, for prospering
in it.

This hypocrite says, if you be religious, keep your Religion to your self.

Because the Apostle in a partiular case, for avoiding of offense, once said,
Romans 14.22
Have thou faith? have it to thy self, before God; meaning it, of knowledge of
our liberty in things indifferent, wherein we should not by our practice offend
such as yet believe no such thing; this hypocrite concludes, that no man must
make open profession of walking in a stricter course of godliness then the
openly profane; nor so much as talk of Religion in ordinary discourse; but
says (as he, Amos 6.10
in another case,) Hold thy tongue; for we may not make mention of the Name of
the Lord; not considering how much, in the great things of the Gospel of
Christ, Christians are both edified and comforted by declaring to one another
the mutual faith of each other Romans 1.12.
.

But what has Religion committed that this hypocrite would have her kept close
prisoner from the access, and speech of her friends? yet, stand committed she
must. If you have any news, or merriment (says he) impart it; but matters of
conscience keep to your self. I have Religion and conscience as well as you;
but I make no talk or boast of it, but keep it to my self. For these things,
let every man look to one; every tub shall stand upon his own bottom. Religion
must be supposed, not examined. Although in contracts of marriage, men love the
bird in hand, by making the dowry or joyncture sure; yet he thinks it enough
for Religion, if the bird be in the bush, and that you believe him to be
religious. Does he fear God? O, no doubt of that, although there appear not
visibly any fear of God before his eyes. It is want of charity to make such a
question: yea, though he seem never so bad, yet his heart is as good as the
best for ought you know. Thus it is enough for him, if he can make you believe
that he has Religion within, where none but God can see it, who (he hopes)
will keep council; and, that he makes no more show of it outwardly, is out of
modesty, not of profanesse.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian is ready always to give an answer to every man that asks
him a reason of the hope that is in him 1 Pet. 3.16
.

Although he will not cast pearls before swine Mat. 7.6
, but will keep his mouth as with a bridle while the wicked is before him, as
one dumb with silence; and hold his peace even from good Psalm. 39.1, 2.
, especially in evil times Amos 5.13.
, wherein Religion will go by the worse, as well as himself, by his speaking:
yet, among those that profess God, Christ and Religion, he never thought
modesty to be placed in silence; but in time, manner, and temper of speaking.

First, he will see, if days will speak, and the multitude of years teach
wisdom Job 32.7.
. But, if after waiting he finds them to stand silent, he then shows his
opinion, as one full of matter, and whom the spirit within constrains Ver.
16, 17.18
.

He knows that God has chosen his people to shine as lights, and to show forth
the virtues of him that has called him out of darkness into his mavelous
light 1 Pet. 2.9
. Therefore he forbears not speaking (for, the fire of grace in his heart, will
break out, and force him to speak with his tongue.) But then his speech is
always with grace seasoned with salt, that he may know how to answer every man
Col. 4.6.
Ephesians. 4.29.
, it shall be good to the use of edifying, administering grace to the hearers
(h).

He feels both the comfort and want of holy conference by which Christians are
provoked to love and to good works Heb. 10.24.
; and, that the fire of zeal never kindles to a just height, but when it is as
a bon-fire, where every man casts his brand into it to increase the flame. He
finds by experience that as a gracious heart moves the tongue, so a gracious
tongue cheereth the heart. Hence, when God has turned and tuned his tongue to
a pure language Zeph. 2.9.
, the words of the pure are pleasant Prove. 15.26
, and the tongue of the just is as fined silver Prove. 10.20
; why is not the tongue of the wicked and this hypocrite so? Because his heart
is little worth. It is impure. But, he that loves pureness of heart, for the
grace of his lips, the King (of heaven at least) shall be his friend Prove. 22.11
.

Thus the hypocrite imposes silence upon others, because unable to speak
himself; or least his actions as well as the heart should give his tongue the
lie; the true Christian cannot but break silence, because out of the abundance
of the heart his mouth speaks Mat. 12.34
the one places his Religion in keeping his mouth shut; the other in opening
it to the praise of God, and the edifying of his neighbor: the one takes all
discovery of a man's Religion to be but hypocrisy whoever commands it; the
other accounts that no Religion which forbears to speak the things which he
has seen and heard, whoever forbids it Act. 4.20.
.

This hypocrite thinks it a fair plea for sinning, that by taking some liberty
therein, he shall

When the heart does not abhor evil Ps. 36.4
. it is natural to man to set himself in a way that is, not good, and to
promise himself much good, either in that way, or by it; either he shall find
all precious substance, and fill his house with spoil Prove. 1.13
, in the pursuit of it; or, at least gain so much wisdom by seeing the vanity
and villainy of it, as for the future to shun and abhor it. Not considering the
deceitfulness of sin, of all sin; and that what is said of them, who are
ensnared with an entising whorish woman, none that go down unto her return
again, neither take they hold of the paths of life: is true with every man
that loves to play with sin; he is more sure to be hardened in it, than against
it; it being just with God to let them be led into temptation, that dally with
it; and, that they who love danger should perish in it.

Yet this hypocrite thinks he should hate sin more, if he made some trial of
it; and that tyring himself in sinful pleasures will bring on a more speedy
repentance: as if repentance served but for an hospital for the lame and
decrepit soldiers of sin. Hence he concludes, he may learn as much at a
play, as by hearing a Sermon; for, in the one he shall see sin acted, which
will make him more to loath it; in the other he shall only hear it inveighed
against, which will signify little to any of the senses, but only the ear.
Hence he is content to let his children frequent play houses without control;
yea, and brothel-houses too, with little reproof, that by the sight, or glut of
sin, they may be brought out of love with it.

Ter. in Eunuch.
This is a practice better becoming that lewd servant in the Comedy (than an
hypocrite in the Church;) who when he had conveyed his masters son into a
Stews, boasted of his good service, because thereby he should come to know
betimes, the manners and mischiefs of those lewd strumpets, which to understand
by some experience, was in his opinion, salus adolescentulis, the only ship to
save young men from wrack.

But O! how does Satan smile to see those pageants and nurseries of the fowlest
vices, to be esteemed and frequented as the only Schools of the fairest
virtues?

But, in a play, says he, there is good as well as evil represented? Grant it
to be so; yet it may easily be presumed before, what choice corruption will
make, where both are indifferently offered? Indifferently, said I, nay sure the
advantage is given to vice; for, if the story favor chastity, the action stirs
up lust: and the spectator desires sic fieri turpis, that he may get the like
opportunity: Thus many looking on the picture of Joseph and his wanton
Mistress, are so enamoured with naked vice, that they depart of her mind,
rather then of his.

Differ.
Contrarily, The true Christian will touch no unclean thing, that God may
receive him.

He knows that virtue shuns all entries by the door of vice, but removes her
way far from her, and comes not near the door of her house Prove. 5.8.
. He considers that a secret curse is upon all that run into the mouth of
temptation, which exposes the heart to the malice of Satan; as well as to the
tyranny of its own corruption; and so he has not only sin and Satan, but
God himself against him in every such attempt.

Therefore, he will not do evil that good may come of it. He will not tempt his
concupiscence to become an everlasting temper to his heart; nor God, to give
him over to the loosnesse of it. He knows that whosoever comes over to good,
only because he is weary of evil, will, after some rest, return to it; or
repent, that he cannot; and that he that turns the unclean spirit out of his
house, upon no better account, and after finds it empty and swept of his
former practices, and garnished with a show of seeming reformation, he takes
with himself seven spirits more wicked then himself, and they enter in, and
dwell there, and the last end of that man is worse then the first Mat. 12.44.45
. Therefore he will be so far from making any experiments of sin, that he hates
the very garment spotted by the flesh Jude 23.
.

Nature may defervere wax cool: but lust grows more hot: natural lust may
abate, but sinful lust increases her unnatural heat. Wherefore the child of
God is afraid to call to mind (unless in a prayer) the sins of his youth,
even in repenting of them, when they appear with all the disadvantage that may
be; lest they should kindle a new flame in him, when he most hates them Romans
7.15
. Much more then will he keep himself far from the public shops of evil and
perilous representations, so lewd, that neither a Cato can abide them, nor
they him.

Thus the hypocrite out of love to sin, would feign be fingering of it, under
pretense to loath it. The true Christian truly loathing sin, will not come near
it, out of love to God: the one seeks for light in the midst of darkness, for
good in evil; the other will have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
darkness, because a child of light: that will not adventure to heaven it self
by the suburbs of hell.

This Hypocrite is a great censurer of that in others, which (with much more)
he does himself,

He can espy and point at the smallest errors and infirmities in those who in
the main, outstrip him in godliness. He has a quick-sighted conscience for
other men's faults, but none for his own. And there is none whom he so much
observes, as Professors, not to imitate, but to disgrace and revile them;
thereby declaring himself, not to be the Be that gathers honey in Gods garden;
but the spider that sucks up the poison in Gods house.

Hence those malicious outcries, veiled over with a seeming sorrow and
amazement at the report; Wot you what? would you think it? such an one (I
hear) swore an oath, or was taken in a false tale: O! these pure ones; are the
vilest people alive; under a show of sanctity; they commit any wickedness in
the dark, etc. But, does not he the same things customarily, and with an high
hand without any complaining of them in himself? Yes, but that is no matter; he
makes no profession to do contrary, the other does contrary to his profession:
(If indeed he has done it, and that rumor and malice have not conspired, the
one to raise, the other to receive an evil and unjust report.) But, is this
hypocrites sin the less, because they who profess better, are guilty of the
same? Will the others pollution wash off this man's guilt, or excuse him so much
as a tanto, from any aggravating circumstance, in the great day of account?

He easily believes the worst of professors, not because they are so bad, but
because they will be no worse: and that he may justify or wreak himself (who
is worse) upon them, whom even at the worst, he knows to be better then himself
at his best: Feign he would have them to be what he reports them; and, is loath
to hear any thing (how true soever) in their vindication. Of others he hops
well beyond hope; but, here, where there is matter of more than hope, even real
grace in being, he finds matter of exception; yea, of desperation.

On the contrary, the true Christian deals only with himself by way of
censure; Differ.
with others in a way of charity.

He has conscience for himself, compassion for others; and while the
hypocrites rules are loose for himself, strict for others, the Christians
severity is most toward himself; and his charity largest toward others. He
notes and bewailes the smallest error at home; but is loath to see far
greater abroad; not as conniving at sin, but as loath to turn his finger in
other men's sores. If others be his fellow professors, he judges well of them,
till plain and full evidence compels him to alter his judgment. If they be
loose and unreformed, he mournes for them, and (which is all the favor that
charity allows) he hopes, and prays for better.

He considers the occasion, and the temptation, as well as the offense it self;
some he endeavors to restore with the spirit of meekness Gal. 6.1.
, having compassion, and making a difference Jude 22.
, others he saves with fear, pulling them with more violence out of the fire
Verse 23
. If their nakedness be discovered, he labors to cover it with the mantle of
love going backward, so far as Religion it self do not suffer by undue
palliating of it. His charity is such, that of himself he thinkeh no evil; nor
will he easily take up an evil report from others against his neighbor Psalm.
15.3.
. Although his charity be not blind, yet is it loath to see, because love
covers a multitude of sins 1 Pet. 4.8.
.

Thus the hypocrite (like the lap-wing, that makes a great noise and
fluttering, not over her nest, but as far as she can from it) sets other men's
faults between you and himself, that his own may not be discerned; the true
Christian will not hide his own iniquity, nor stand upon terms of comparative
sanctity with others. The one condemns sin in others that he may justify
himself; the other lets other men alone, and condemns himself that he may
justify God: the one concludes his own estate to be good, because others be
worse; the other suspects and fears his own standing, when he sees others to
fall.

This Hypocrite opposes goodness under the brand of singularity; and zeal,
under that of popularity.

As he maintains evil, not as evil, but as good: So he labors to knock down
what is good, under the name and notion of evil. The Jews when they took up
stones against Christ, would by no means be thought to do it for a good work:
for a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a
man make thy self God John 10.33.
. Either he was a blasphemer, or they will pronounce him so; and that, in their
opinion was enough to make him so; although he was neither so, nor so.

Thus the blind Pharisee was content to love those that love him; but, to
extend it to the love of enemies was, in his esteem, a singularity, and more
then needs; albeit Christ requires love to enemies, blessing for cursing, good
for hatred, from all that would approve themselves children of that Father who
is in heaven Mat. 5.43, 44
. Thus Mary's love and zeal in the anointing of Christ with a rich and precious
ointment, against the time of his burial, was looked upon by that hypocritical
perfideous thief and traitor, Judas, as a great and vainglorious wast, that
might have been spared, and the ointment sold, and employed to a better use
John 12.5.
; which yet Christ himself pronounces to be a good work Mat. 26.10
, and approved it so highly, that he took order, that wherever that Gospel
should be preached in the whole world, there also shall this that this woman
has done, be told for a memorial of her Verse 13.
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian thinks he can never speak honorably enough
of goodness and zeal.

He looks upon goodness as a choice fruit of the Spirit Ephesians. 5.9.
, as a glorious ray of the divine nature 2 Pet. 1.4
, and the fullest and sweetest representation of God, who is essentially
goodness it self; and, upon Zeal, as a coal from the Altar, as the glory of
Christ John 2.^7
, and knows it to be good to be zealously affected always in a good thing Gal.
4.18.
. Therefore he honors goodness wherever he meets with it; yea, where he
least expected to find it. So Nathanael (being a true Israelite), although he
first made a doubt whether any good thing could come out of Nazareth John 1.46
; yet, when he went and found it so, he soon salutes Christ (who was that good
thing) with the highest titles, not in complement but in singleness of heart;
Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel Verse 49
.

When Christ, through such a fervent zeal as in outward expressions, he never
showed the like before or after, manifested his deep resentment of the great
profanation of the Temple by those who sold oxen, sheep and doves, (and by the
money changers, who there attended upon that occasion) to such as at the solemn
festivals came up to Jerusalem for to worship; and by reason of the long
journey, bought their offerings there with their money, which was allowed by
the Law Deuteronomy. 14 25
; but, not to be bought or sold within the Temple, as then was the practice,
whereupon our Lord in the height of his zeal, made scourges of small cords,
with which he drove all those hucksters out of the Temple, and the sheep and
oxen, and poured out the money, and overthrew the Tables on which the money was
told: this holy flame, his Disciples did not (as our hypocrite would have done)
censure as a piece of popular or frantic fury, but gave it the honor of an
heavenly zeal, remembering that it was written, the zeal of thine house has
eaten me up. Joh. 2.15, 16, 17.
.

Thus the hypocrite closely strikes through the sides of that good which he
would be thought to affect and defend; but secretly hates; the true Christian
owns and honors it indeed, by what names soever decryed and disgraced, because
he truly loves it: the one puts true piety into a bears skin, that all may
rise up and worry it, the other takes off that disguise, and presents her in
her own habit, that both he and all good men may still go on to love and
embrace it.

This Hypocrite glories much in this free acknowledgement (which yet is false
too) that he is no hypocrite.

This is all he has to say for himself when found in his sin; he lives
according to his profession, and is no worse then he seems: A bad world when
that is, become a virtue, which God himself cries out of as the height of
sin; they declare their sins as Sodom, they hide them not Esaias 3.9.
! If others seem better than he, he will make you believe that certainly they
are worse then they seem; very hypocrites: for, if they would use plain
dealing as he does, they would appear no other then he s.

With him, that man is in no degree virtuous or honest, whom he calls
hypocrite. Let who will outrun him in piety, (as he is well content every man
should, rather then forsake his own profaneness of heart,) it is enough for
him to tarry behind, and traduce, not only his steps, but his heart, as if he
went not a right path, or with a right foot, or ran too fast. And hereby he
thinks himself sufficiently justified, although he lie as impudently, and in
the proof fail as shamefully, as the devil himself in his accusation of Job Job
1.9.
.

But what is hypocrisy if this be not? Did not this hypocrite vow in Baptism
to do as much (and perhaps more) as he who in obedience to God and conscience
of his vow, has so much out-stript him? Does he not yet seem to stand to that
vow, or at least bear himself out upon it, to enjoy the privileges of a
Christian? Whether then is it hypocrisy to endeavor to keep that vow, though
in weakness; or to think the vow not observed, makes a better Christian? He
basely abuses his Creditor, who enters into a bond that he means never to
discharge. Howbeit God has too many such debtors; and, among them, this
hypocrite, But he can at pleasure call them to account And what then shall he
answer, who will not seem what he professes he should be; but glories in this
only commendation, that he has freely laid open to view of all the inward
corruption of his heart, and fomed out his own shame?

Contrarily, the true Christian bewaileth his hypocrisy, Differ.
even in his greatest sincerity.

He is a Nathanael, in whom there is no guile; not because wholly free from
corruption; but, from holding fast of deceit: not because there is no evil in
him, but because his goodness is not dissembled. Evil in him is, first,
conscientiously mortified: next, wisely (not craftily or guilfully) suppressed
(if it cannot be wholly purged out) that it become not offensive to others. It
imports him that would cast goodness into chains, to let wickedness loose to
raise evil reports of the prisoner; but the child of God lets grace go abroad
as a good subject and servant to Christ, and ties up the remainder of
corruption at home as a malefactor, and rebel to his Lord; and bewail, his
misery in being forced to be a Jailer to such a prisoner that night and day
studies and strives to break prison; and cries out, O wretched man that I am,
who shall deliver me from the body of this death Romans 7.24.
, (lamenting his forced retaining of the body of sin (the relics of
corruption) even after the soul (the dominion of sin) is departed out of it,)
more then he glories in his graces, which yet are imperfect, through the
continuance of ome flesh within him.

And although it befits him well enough who wilfully brings upon himself a
necessity of being wicked, to profess no better, but to show what he is
without seeming to be more; (yet would this hypocrite feign be accounted a good
Christian in the gross;) but a true Christian will both seem and be what his
profession requires, although he come short of what he seems; for, his very
holding out a seeming of being virtuous, engages him the more to virtue, and
against sin; and adds a necessity of being what he seems. If he do any
evil, he alone may he said to retain an upright heart, even while he walks
not with a right foot: either, because he intends not the evil which he does,
or hates what violence of corruption forces his heart, not yet fully
established with grace, to commit.

Thus this hypocrite cares not how bad he be himself, so others may be deemed
not to be better. The true Christian is contented to esteem others (who perhaps
are worse) to be better than himself, so he do what he can to be better: the
one judging others to be hypocrites, for not being so profane as himself,
thereby condemns himself to be a profane hypocrite; the other, by doing his
best, and bewayling his worst, is discharged of profaneness, and plainly
declared a sincere Christian.

CHAP. XIV. The Worldly Hypocrite Is he that makes use of Religion to compass
the things of the world. Defin.

HE takes up Religion, not as a means to get heaven; but, as a trade to get
earth; Supposing gain to be godliness. 1 Timothy 6.5.
He converseth about things of the World; with a show of piety; but is acted by
the Spirit of the World. 1 Cor. 2.15.
He puts on Gods Livery; but Mammon is his Master, And albeit Worldlynesse
(like Pride) be so notorious that it can hardly be concealed, yet this
hypocrite has such variety of Maskes, that when the sin is so palpable in his
forehead that (were the Mask taken off) he that runs might read it; now, he
that most diligently observes him, can hardly discover and convince him.

The Superstitious hypocrite, and the Worldly hypocrite do both love the World:
but, with difference, thus; The Superstitious holds fast the World, when he
seems wholly to disclaim it; The Worldly hypocrite seeks to justify all he
does, when he can no longer deny his pursuit of the World. He will not wholly
disclaim the World, but strives to make good, even from the rules of Religion,
his owning of it, so far as he is willing to confess his using of it.

No Wordling will acknowledge how much and how far he minds earthly things,
even when he condemns others of the same sin. He has so many holes to run
out at, when you pursue him, that it is hard to catch him: and Chamelion-like,
he transforms himself into so many shapes, that it is no easy matter to lay
hold upon him, and say this is the man, even when you have found him. He has
ever somewhat to say for himself, and his course; which though it satisfy not
others, yet it contents himself, especially if they who accuse him cannot with
any color of reason, reply; and this makes him to think that all other men,
who trouble themselves about him, do either mistake, or wrong him: and so, he
hardens himself in his sin through the defect of their discoveries, as Jayle
birds strengthen themselves in wickedness, when quited by the Jury, for want of
evidence.

This is He whom Christ intended in the Parable of the thorny ground Mat. 13.22.
. He is an hearer of the Word, but a lover of the World, and of the things of
it, which thorns choke all the seed of the Word bestowed upon him. The Mark.
3.19.
cares of this life, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust of other
things; (to wit, the lusts of the flesh in the matters of sinful pleasures, the
lust of the eye in the business of worldly gain, and the pride of life, 1 John
2.15.
in reference to power, pomp, and honor; all, of the World) spring up so fast,
and overtop the Word so much, that it can yield no fruit, but that which not
only condemns him to be a bad piece of ground, but exceedingly aggravates his
sin, and adds to his plagues.

He is a pretender to Religion (as all other hypocrites be) and many times
more, than others who truly embrace it. But it is to avoid exception, to
purchase reputation, to palliate his Worldly courses, and to blind the eyes of
those whom he seems sometimes to reverence and honor, that they may cry him
up for a godly man; and, that he may retain and increase his covetous practices
under that guise, with less fear of censure. But his heart is altogether
earthly, and acted by the World, a soil, that never admitts of the seed of the
Word, or of grace, but to stiffle or bury it.

To Religion he pretends much love (but without sincerity) in hope to corrupt
her, to serve his worldly ends; but, to the World he is a slave, in regard, of
the lustful love he bears to her. He courteth Religion, but the World is his
Mistress. Therefore neither God, nor Religion can have any share in his love.
The love of the World, and the love of the Father are incompatible: Yea, the
love of that, is enmity with God. Jam 4.4.
This love of the World steals away the seed of the Word out of the heart, and
the heart from God; and so makes the whole man to deny him Prove. 30.9.
. To love the World is to deny God: for, he that confesses a God and denies
him that love he bestows upon the World, in works denies him whom with words
he acknowledges.

The Nutmeg-tree makes barren all the ground about it, so does the spice of
worldly love make the heart sterilous of grace: therefore this hypocrite loves
nothing of God, but in order and subordination to this Diana of the World; and
so, loves not God, but the world. He is really as irreligious as the Profane
hypocrite; yet differs from him, as one wicked man from another, by the more
proper and immediate Genius that acts him. The Profane hypocrite is acted by a
spirit of Profaneness which makes him not much to care for the World; this
hypocrite is wholly moved and led by the spirit of the world, which makes him
not much to mind profaneness, but rather to avoid it, as a hindrance to his
gain among those who are truly religious.

On the Contrary, the true Christian so makes use of the things of the world,
as to advance Religion. Differ.


Religion is his Pilot steering his Course through the Sea of this World: the
World is the Sea through which he sayleth, not the Port which he intends to
make. He uses this World 1 Cor. 7.31.
, as a Carpenter his tools, to produce somewhat else: not as the end of his
work or the crown of his labor. He knows the soil of his heart to be as apt to
briars and thorns, as any other; therefore when the seed of the Word is to be
sown there, he berakes up his fallow ground, and will not sow among thorns.
Jer. 4.3.
He is as much afraid of covetousness as another, (yea* more than he that is
most covetous;) but he will not secretly foster an heart exercised with
covetous practices, as the hypocrite does: but strives openly against that
secret Enemy, by praying against all inclinations toward it, incline mine
heart unto the Testimonies and not unto Covetousness Psalm. 119.36.
.

God, who has made every thing beautiful in his time, has also set the world
in this man's heart, Eccles. 3.11.
whereby he may see more of the wisdom, power, and glory of God in the things
that are made, and take his portion, and rejoice in his labor, so far as it is
given him of God. Eccles. 5.1^.
But, he will not set his heart on the World. If God give riches, he thankfully
improves them to be rich in good works. 1 Timothy 6.1^
He will neither set his heart upon them, Psalm. 62.10.
as an Adulterer, upon a strange Love; Jam. 4 4.
nor place confidence in them, as an Idolater in a strange god. Col. 3.5.
Where God gives outward blessings he enjoyes them soberly, and humbly gives
God thanks. Isay. 1.18.
If God deny them, he can live upon God himself, as well as upon bread If he be
oppressed, 1 Pet. 4.12.
he thinks it not strange, no, though it be a fiery trial, nor marvailes at the
matter, Eccles. 5.8.
because he wisely considers, that he that is higher then the highest
regards; and that there be higher than they that oppress him. He looks upon
Godlyness with Contentment, as the greatest gain, 1 Timothy 6.6.
although it should never make him a gayner in outward things (which yet is
impossible;) therefore having food and raiment, he is therewith content. ver. 8.
Yea, he can extract gold out of iron, heaven out of earth, and behold in every
earthly mercy, a special love, and a pledge of more spirit^ and heavenly
blessings Heb. 11.9, 10.
.

Thus, this Aypocrite makes Religion his Baud, to make way for his Adultery
with the world; the true Christian makes the world his stirrup to mount himself
above it Rev. 12.7.
: the one makes the world his inheritance, the other, his movables Heb. 13.14.
: the one makes it his Mistress; the other, his servant; the one obeyes it,
the other commands it.

This hypocrite makes Religion his shryne, but the World, his God.

He must profess Religion, else all would abhor him, because he has not
only envy and malice to accuse him, but piety it self to look narrowly into
his goings. Therefore he seeks to gratify piety with a show; that so, that
being deluded, he may more easily shake off the charge of the other two. He
loves not Religion but from the teeth outward: yet (when Religion is in
fashion) he must Court it, or fall short of his design for the World. Were he
to choose, or could he obtain his worldly end without Religion, this should
never be his choice. But seeing the profession of piety and sanctity is an
inlet to wealth and preferment, who so great a zealot as he?

And this he takes up more eminently, when God is doing great things in the
World. For when Gods hand is apparently visible in extraordinary changes, and
revolutions, the Instruments of so great alterations must needs (to satisfy
the multitude) say, Am I now come up without the Lord against this place to
destroy it? 2 Kin. 18.25.
Therefore he must needs scrape acquaintance with Religion, in hope to promote
and gain countenance to his Covetous practices. For he that will at such a time
make his advantage, must tune his Instrument to the same key with the world
turned seemingly pious, or lose his opportunity of growing rich and great in it.

When Zion is built up with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity, and the Heads
thereof judge for reward, then will the Priests teach for hyre, and the
Prophets divine for money: and after all, they will lean upon the Lord, and say,
is not the Lord amongst us; no evil can come upon us. Mic. 3.10.11.
This hypocrite therefore at such a time will not sit out, nor lose his share
in the present advantage of counterfeit sanctity, but study the fashion that he
may consult his gain, and will be this, and that, and every thing whereby he
may get any thing. Tell not him of conscience against his profit, nor of
godliness against his gain. He has a conscience for any thing that may advance
him, for nothing that may obstruct his promotion.

But such are the sleights of Satan the god of this world, that not the true
God whom he professes, but the world whom he seems to deny, has his heart,
whoever tunes his tongue and orders his devotions. This he embraces with the
strength of his soul. When Religion and the World part Company (as oft-times
they do) Demas will forsake Paul, (yea Christ himself,) having loved this
present World 2 Timothy 4.10
. This commands him more then ever God did, even when he made most profession
of godliness. He will adventure his soul for the World, but not the least limb
of his body for God. And so when he does more for the World then he will do for
God, in Gods account he adoreth and worshippeth the World, Phil. 3.19.
as that which can do him most good; and, neglects the true God, because
being evil in himself, he can expect nothing but evil from God.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian is crucified to the World, that unto him
there may be but one God.

In the World there be that are called gods: So that, where the true God is not
alone worshipped and glorified, there be gods many, and lords many 1 Cor. 8.5.
: yet, to the true Christian there is but one God, the Father of whom are all
things, and we in him, as there is but one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by him. ver. 6.
The World shall have his hands, because God has commanded him with quietness
to work, and to eat his own bread. 2 These. 3.13.
but God alone has his heart, Pro. 23.26.
because none else can satisfy it. The World passes away, and the lust
thereof 1 John. 2.17
: but he must and will have a God with whom is no variableness neither shadow
of turning, Jam. 11.17.
but is the same yesterday, and to day, and, for ever. Heb. 13.8.
His soul being immortal nothing will content him but an eternal God. If he
labor for meat, in reference to his soul, it shall not be for that which
perishes, but for that which endures to everlasting life. Joh. 6.27.
The choicest Cates of the World are but husks for swine, and therefore not
food for him that will live for ever.

Offer him whatever the earth affords, whatever nature can bring forth out of
her choycest treasury to present to her dearest darlings, all this is nothing
to a soul whose reasonable infinite appetite longs after that which is truly
and every way infinite. Therefore, when he has all that the World can afford
him, he still cries out, whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon
earth that I desire besides thee. Psalm. 73.25.
He is clothed with the Sun, and therefore must needs have the Moon under his
feet. Rev. 12.41.
He will never make earth his heaven, who enjoyes heaven upon earth, as an
heir of the Kingdom which God has promised to them that love him. Jam. 2.5.
A heaven upon earth he may have; because he converseth as one in heaven, while
on the earth; but all the earth with the fullness thereof, will never fill him,
who can never be full, but by and with the fullness of him that fills all in
all, Ephesians. 1.23.


Thus this hypocrite makes a god of this World, because given up to the god of
this World; the true Christian abhors all thoughts of making the World his
god, because his God is in heaven: The one worshippeth and serves the creature
more then the Creator; Romans 1.25.
the other makes the creature his servant, and serves him only who is God
blessed for ever.

This Hypocrite will be of that Religion which is most for his Worldly
advantage.

He that makes the World his god, will be conformed to this World, for gayning
the wealth and good things thereof, as well without God as with him. He admits
of no Religion that will oversway this resolution, but makes this resolution
the Elector and Master of his Religion. His continual lay is, Who will show us
any good? Psalm. 4.6.
Any good, who ever shows it, whence so ever it comes, by what means soever
attained, serves his turn. So that, what sometimes Ittai the Gittite spoke
unto David, 2 Samuel 15.21
in what place so ever my Lord the King shall be, whether in death or life,
even there also will thy servant be; this hypocrite, in the secrets of his
soul, says to the World, where soever profit is; hers will I be, and her will
I serve, and follow after, all the World over. If God, or Religion will make up
an estate and put him in a way of gain, God shall be his God, and Religion his
favorite. If not, he knows no God, Religion, or conscience but in
subordination to any thing else which will accomplish his worldly ends. If
Gain be godliness, godliness shall have enough of his service. But if
godlyness hinder his gain, or prophecy evil unto him for it, he puts it off as
Felix did Paul, Act. 24.25.
Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient season, I will call for
thee. Time enough hereafter, when he is going out of the World to converse with
Religion that hinders his thriving in the World.

If Popery prevail, and likely to be the quickest way to preferment, he has
presently arguments more than enough at his fingers ends to take him off from the
true Reformed Religion, and to justify his reconciliation to Rome. He finds so
much diversity and contrarietyes of opinions and parties, among Protestants,
that he can bear it no longer. He would willingly have continued Protestant,
could he have known where to fix his faith; but seeing he could not, that, now,
makes him a Roman Catholic; and to set up his rest there as the only center of
a pious soul. In the mean time, he knows no more than the Collier, what that
Church beleives, but to believe as the Church believes, and to yield blind
obedience to he knows not what, so it open a way to his thriving in the World,
and to get up at Court. With this he huggs himself as much as ever did Micah
the Ephraimite when he had gotten an house full of gods, and made an Ephod and
a Teraphim, and at length hired a runnigado Levite to officiate in his house;
and from hence concluded, now I know that the Lord will do me good, seeing I
have a Levite to my Priest. Judge. 17.11.13.
The hope of advancing his estate makes him willing to allow ten shekels of
silver by the year and a suit of apparel, beside diet, to maintain a false
worship; whereas otherwise, he would scarce have afforded bread and water alone
to a true Prophet of God.

Or, if he go not over to Rome, because that superstition may not be the only
way left to get wealth; yet his heart being still for his profit; his eye shall
be upon that profession, or way of Religion, which at the present is most in
request and power. Evangelical, or Reformed; Lutheran, or Calvinist, Brownist,
Anabaptist, Familist, Libertine, etc. are alike to him, save only in the matter
of his gain: for this, he bids adue to what ever he professed before, when he
perceives his former way and party to be left behind. He is resolved with
Hushai (but for a worse purpose) to worship the rising Sun: and Absalom shall
be now as much esteemed and honored by him, as ever David himself was, when at
the highest. Of any Religion, he is ready to say, as he of Absalom, 2 Samuel
16.18.
whom all the men of Israel shall choose, (although with rejecting their true
liege Lord and Sovereigne,) his will I be, and with him will I abide. Upon
every change, he is ready to comply with this Epiphonema (and invitation of
others to the same compliance) O come let us sing a new song.

If he find the temper of the times to be such, that there is nothing to be
gotten by one Religion more than another; he is indifferent what Religion you
impose on him, A Mass, and the Lords Supper in the reformed way; the
Scriptures, and Traditions; Popery, and the Protestant Religion, do suit as
well with his palate, and go down as willingly, one as the other. If he prefer
any, it is that by which he gets most, although it be of all other the worst.
Here Demetrius, that otherwise never troubled himself much with matters of
Religion, will seem very Zealous for Diana, and for the support of her
magnificence Act. 19.25.27
: not that he cared for Diana, more than for a painted post; but, because by
that craft, he and his fellow silver smiths had their wealth. If he happen to
be a looser by Christ in the things of the World, although Christ and his
Religion be of all other the best, he is of the Gergesenes mind, who had rather
part with Christ, than hazard their swine by his company, and chose rather to
have no Christ, Differ.
than no hoggs. Mat. 8.34.


On the Contrary, the true Christian is only for the pure Religion and
undefiled before God, whether the World smile, or frown.

He embraces Religion for Religions sake: therefore if God once teach him the
way of his statutes, he will keep it unto the end, Psalm. 119.33.
If he have once chosen the way of truth, he will stick unto Gods Testimonies,
ver 30. 31.
and take them as an heritage for ever, ver. 111.
how ever God deal with him in the things of the World; He can love God as
well, and bless him as much, when God not only denies, but takes from him the
outward comforts of life. Job. 1.2.


If with Jacob, he make a Vow, saying. Genesis 28.20.21.
If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me
bread to eat and raiment to put on, etc. then shall the Lord be my God, etc. He
does it not as indenting by way of condition: and, to be free, in case God
perform not: but, as engaging his heart by a stronger obligation to serve the
Lord only, and to give more ample testimonies of it, as assuredly believing
that God would do all that, and more, for him.

Thus, when he observes the Worldlings enclination, by that inquiry, who will
show us any good? the true Christian presently makes out to God to lift up the
light of his countenance upon him: thereby giving all to understand that if God
should deny him Corn, wine, and oil, yet so long as he could but enjoy the
special favor of God in Christ, that should suffice. The World should never
part God and him, Let him enjoy God, and take the World who will. Then, though
God slay him, he will yet trust in him. Job. 13.15.
He will not change his God for gold, nor his Religion to save his life. All
the rage and fury of a Nebuchadnezzar himself shall not once move him, nor so
much as put him to the least care, or study for an answer to an unreasonable
and impious command; If threatened, he fears not, if cast into a fiery furnace,
he rests upon God, who is able to deliver him. Prove. 30.8.
and whether he deliver him or not he will not be false to his God, by serving
the gods of men's setting up. He will not change his Lord for wages, nor his
Religion for safety. And even those outward blessings which God has cast upon
him, in a lawful calling, he looks upon more as the return of his prayers,
than as the fruit of his labors; and is as willing to part with them all for
God that bestowed them, as he is to enjoy them while God sees fit to continue
them.

Thus, this Hypocrite while he makes show of greatest honor to Religion, is no
better than Demetrius, who loved the Shrynes better then his Saint, and the
Silver better then her Shrynes: the true Christian, with David, loves Religion
better then thousands of Gold and Silver, and his God, better then his life:
the one makes sure of the world, whatever becomes of Religion; the other
chooses to keep close to Religion, whatever become of himself: The one
conditioneth for plenty, and a great estate, the other is contented with a
pilgrims allowance Prove. 30.8.
.

This Hypocrite apologiseth for all his worldly practices, by pretense of such
ends as none

Covetousness being conscious, seeks shelter under somewhat that is either
really good, or at least seems to be so. Therefore Covetousness never walks
without a Cloak, 1 These. 2.5.
. nor can well make her Market without fained words, 2 Pet. 2.3.
the better to set off her wares. And herein Covetousness has the advantage
of most sins: For, no sin has so many fair pretenses to make its way into the
hearts of sinful men: Drunkenness, Adultery, and such like, may have somewhat
to plead to such as love these sins; but not to others who are not those ways
addicted: but Covetousness has Arguments of all sorts and sizes, to fit, not
only the worldling, but to gravel and nonplus many of those that have renounced
the world. So as this Hypocrite (if he cannot make others, yet he) makes
himself at least to believe that he should do ill, to do otherwise then he does.

If he be charged with oppression, his answer is ready, I must pay every man
his own, and nothing is mine till that be done, therefore I must make the best
of mine own; for I am in debt. As if a man could not live out of debt, unless
he live out of charity. If taxed of Usury, he tells you, he takes no more then
the Law allows him, nor performs less then the Law enjoynes him: Not
considering that man's laws must tolerate and yield to the hardness of man's
heart, many things which the Law of God never allowed, but requires to love
mercy as well as to do justice. If upbraided with niggardliness, he answers, he
must be thrifty and frugal, that it is a sin to be profuse and riotous, and
that Gods blessings must not be squandred in wasteful courses. As if God did
not allow a man soberly to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of his labor;
and that to a man to whom God has given riches and wealth, the addition of a
power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor,
were not the gift of God. Eccles. 5.18, 19.


If he be censured of griping and cruelty to Tenants, etc. He thinks he has
abundantly satisfied you, if he plead, I must maintain my state and part, and
provide for my family and charge accordingly; else were I worse then an infidel
1 Timothy 5.8.
; not considering that he that does no more is no better; nor does he more, who
thinks one duty cannot be performed, unless another as necessary be neglected.
If demanded, for whom he heaps up so much? His answer is, I must get somewhat
to do good withal hereafter. This is an ordinary cloak for oppression, bribery,
robbery, etc. to build Almes-houses after death, who made many to stand in need
of an Almes-house while he lives. But, what a vain thing is it for a man to be
evil while he lives, that some good may be done when he is dead? to undo many,
to provide for a few; and then, to think that such robbery should be accepted
of God for a burnt-offering?

Thus he thinks himself guiltless, if he can delude the world, whereas his
guilt is the greater, by how much more artificial he is in maintaining his sin.
If he can prevail so far as to procure the vile person to be called liberal,
and the churl bountiful, Isai. 32.5.
he has his desire; although herein he deceives himself more then he can
deceive others: For this makes him not to feel, or apprehend his sickness,
even when he is most deadly sick, because those stupefied medicines which he
made use of to silence others, have their effects most upon himself, for that
hereby he is induced to think himself, of all other sins to be most clear
of covetousness, which is his special and reigning sin.

On the contrary, the true child of God (possessed of an estate, Differ.
) fears himself most of being most guilty of this sin.

The least shivering toward the world makes him afraid of this Ague. He knows
that both nature and necessity are apt to make men love the world, and that
therefore the common practice and custom of all, or of most of the most sober
men are biassed this way: Jer. 6 13.
all which is apt to make this sin familiar unto him, while he looks strangely
on it; and, to be in his bosom, ere he be aware. Therefore is he very jealous
of the least inclinations to this disease, because so common that few who have
matter to feed it, can be freed from it, and least of all himself, whom he
looks upon as the greatest of sinners, and the least of Saints. He finds and
complains that the very Law which forbids it, makes him to covet the more, Romans
7.7.
as irritating that corruption which is inbred in him, from the antipathy it
has to the Law which condemns it; and therefore, when he is most conversant in
the perfect Law, he is most earnest in this petition, incline mine heart unto
thy testimonies, and not unto covetousness Psalm. ^19.36.
.

He considers the several veiles with which men are most apt to cover this
malady; and that they who are most deeply infected with it, are like men sick
of the plague, most hardly persuaded that they are in danger to die of it.
Therefore he more strictly examineth, and looks through all the Figg-leaves
wherewith covetousness seeks to hide her nakedness. If but a wish of a
greater estate cross his heart; if but an eye wander after objects of avarice,
by coveting a field, an house, etc. he presently goes to God against it; and,
with Paul, accuses himself as guilty of that sin, from which all other men
would free him. He knows how apt the spirit of corruption within him is, to
lust after Covetousness, as well as after envy, Jam. 4.5.
or ought else that is evil. Therefore, he endeavors to give the water no
passage, no not a little; but, to crush this sin in the egg, lest out of
this Serpents root there come a Cockatrice, and his fruit become a fiery flying
Serpent. Isai. 14.29.


Thus, this Hypocrite seeks a cover for his sin, which he resolves to cherish;
the true Christian lays it open to the view of all, because he is resolved to
destroy it: the one is deadly sick and complains not, because the disease
has gained the vital parts; the other complains, and so is not mortally
sick, because his fear makes him prevent the desperate danger of the other.

This Hypocrite seeks the things of the world absolutely, and with all his
might.

He looks upon them as that which would make him happy, and therefore desires
them accordingly, not with condition, or submission; but, absolutely, as
resolving to take no nay; and, with all his might, that he may obtain them,
whoever says nay. He never puts it to Gods wisdom to consider whether the
things he desires be good for him, or not, but takes that for granted, how
grossly soever he be deceived Therefore as Rachel, in passion, cried to her
husband, Give me children, or else I dye Genesis 30.1.
; So he in the strength of his concupiscence, 1 Timothy 6.9, 10
cries out to all, likely to help him, give me such or such an estate,
preferment, etc. or I shall never be contented, or satisfied. He will be rich,
whatever tentations and snares of the Devil he fall into to compass riches.

Hence it is that he seeks these things with all his might; rising early,
lying down late, and eating the bread of carfulness: Psalm. 127.2.
There is no end of all his travel, neither, says he, for whom do I labor and
bereave my soul of good, Eccles. 4.8.
For a very vanity, which is tossed to and fr^ef them that seek death; Prove.
21.6.
Thus he walks in a vain shadow, being disquieted in vain, to heap up riches,
not knowing who shall gather them: Psalm. 39.6.
Turning and tormoiling himself like a dog in a wheel, still laboring, yet
always remaining in the same place: for though he seek and seem to climb, yet
his weight still casts him back to the bottom. And whether he compass riches
or not, he is deceived, and pierced through and through with many sorrows. If
he get riches, his heart is set upon them; if not, his heart sinkes, and dies
within him: so that being had, they bind him; not had, they torture him. So are
the ways of every one that is greedy of gain, which takes away the life of
the owners thereof Prove. 1.19.
.

Contrarily, The true Christian seeks these things secondarily,
subordinately, and moderately.

He seeks first the Kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, Mat. 6.33.
waiting for these things, to be rather added of God, then earnestly sought by
himself.

First, let Gods will be done, and then let God give him his daily bread. He
seeks only that which God sees to be good for him, not what he concludes to be
so, because he desires it, and would feign have it. He is content to subscribe
to Gods wisdom, and to put the matter wholly into Gods own hand: for though he
may signify in a prayer, what he conceives to be good, yet he leaves it to
the wisdom of God to dispose otherwise, if God see cause. He places no
happiness in the things of the world, and therefore is more moderate in
seeking, and better satisfied in Gods denial of them. Therefore, when the world
is restless, God, says the Psalmist, Psalm. 127.2.
gives to his beloved, rest. He carries a sweet temper in worldly cares, and
accordingly reaps a comfortable measure of heavenly contentment in the midst of
them all. For, God gives to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and
knowledge, and joy: but the sinner he gives travel, to gather and to heap up,
that he may give to him that is good before God Eccles. 2.26.
.

Thus, this Hypocrite sets his heart on the world, to dote upon it as his
happiness; the true Christian has the world in his heart, not to love it, but
to see the vanity of it: the one persues it as his greatest care, the other
neglects it, and casts all his care upon God. The one thinks he can never do
enough to obtain it, the other fears he does too much, when he does least to
procure it.

This Hypocrite brings conscience to concupiscence; The Law to his

First, he would feign have such a thing; but it is not lawful. But is there no
way to make it so; at least in some cases and considerations? He sits not down
by the Baptists, Non licet tibi, it is not lawful for thee to have her: but he
goes on with the covetous to ask council, how he may possess himself of it. As
men that have but a broken title, seek by the wit and cunning of a crafty
Lawyer, to piece it up. Thus he sees a field and coveteth it, but finding a
bar, he suspendeth the action, till the way seem to be cleared; and then
having fetched a circle, and wheeled about, at the last he leapeth (as a Lion)
upon his prey, upon the field and life of Naboth 1 King. 21.
. Thus Saul, who had destroyed all witches and wizzards he could light upon,
when he saw that God answered him not, repaires to the witch at Endor, not
absolutely to consult with the Devil in proper kind; but, to make use of her
to raise up old Samuel now dead, that from him he might learn what to do when
God had forsaken him, and the Philistines began to be too hard for him 1 Samuel
28.16.
. He can here dispense with the Law, which forbade him to suffer a witch to
live; but he does it so, as to make it seem, at least in his case, not simply
unlawful.

Of the same spirit and temper was that wretched worldling Balaam, who loved
the wages of iniquity with all his heart; although at first he durst not touch
it, until he had by importunity hoped to win over God to give way unto it.
When he found not that answer from God which he expected, he makes great shows
of not dareing to go; yet, not without greater struglings to obtain liberty of
going. He, who pretended so much acquaintance with the true God (although a
false prophet, and no better at best than a Simon Magus, who had heard too much
of God to deny him; and, loved his own lusts too well, to obey him) as to
consult Jehovah, before he would give his answer to the Princes of Moab sent
from Balaak with the reward of Divination in their hands; could not but imagine
at least, that he should never obtain from God a commission to curse those
whom the Lord had blessed Number. 22.12.
. Yet when Balaak sent a second Embassy by Princes more, and more honorable
than the first, with promises of very great honor as well as wealth, he
rests not in Gods first answer; for although he make great protestations of
keeping close to Gods directions; and, that if Balaak would give him his house
full of Silver and Gold, he cannot go beyond the Word of the Lord his God, to
do less or more: Yet he is willing to make one trial more, and instead of
sending them away, he now prays them (which he did not before) to tarry that
night also, that he might know what the Lord would say unto him more. ver. 19.


When, God finding him mad upon the journey did after permit (not allow) him to
go; with an hank of restraint when he came there. ver. 20.
Balaam hence gathers hopes that he who at first denied him liberty to go and
after granted it; would at last be drawn to give him power to curse Israel,
although at present he seemed to refuse it. Hence Balaam built so many Altars,
and offered so many Bullocks and Rams, upon them; first, in one place, Number.
23.12.
then in another. ver. 13. 14.
and after all, when he saw that it pleased the Lord to cross his design, he
went out again; not as before, to consult God; but, to seek for enchantments,
setting his face now, not toward Altars, but toward the wilderness; Number. 24.1.
Where he had often consulted the Devil.

In all which he pretended still to follow Gods command, whose resolution he
could not alter; But, rather then lose all his pains, and hazards, and return
without some reward, when he found God inexorable, he then (as a wretched
hypocritical Worldling) betakes him to another stratagem; for by wicked
counsel he taught Balack to lay a stumbling block before the children of
Israel, to eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication. Rev. 2.14.
The plot was this, Balack should send out some of the fairest of their
Midiniatish Women, near to the Camp of Israel, then at Shittim; either out of a
pretended curiosity to view a strange people, or counterfeit humanity to
victual their Camp in a strange Country; Whence the Israelites (natuturally
given to the flesh) kindled in their lusts; solicited the women to uncleanness;
they refuse, unless the Israelites will sacrifice to their gods, and eat and
drink with them in their Idolatrous festivales; this the Israelites; now in
flames of lust, consent unto, rather than not enjoy them.

Hereby Baalam obtained his end, being (as he wickedly imagined) now too hard
for the Lord; putting a trick upon God, to make God to curse those himself,
whom he would not suffer Baalam to curse upon any entreaties. And thus, this
Hypocrite will (as he thinks) make that lawful and practicable at length,
which he found most difficult, and boggled at, at the first: And, rather then
fail, make God himself his Instrument, to do that which God will not suffer
him to attempt: Not that God will be so mocked; but, that this hypocrite will
do what he can thus to mock him.

On the Contrary, the true Christian subdueth concupiscence unto conscience,
and destroieth that lust that will not be subject to the Law of God.

Let the World account him what they please, a Puritan, a precise f^ole whom
vain scrupulosity keeps from preferment: yet he will not taste of their
delicates upon their terms, nor study to make that lawful which God has once
forbidden, or showed the least dislike of. When the men of this World laugh him
to scorn for being afraid of riches, honors, etc. As being a fool in grain,
he is still of Ag^rs mind give me neither poverty nor riches. Pro. 30.8.
Because he sees those snares and temptations in them, which others will not
believe till it be too late.

He studies to bring his will to reason, his lust to the Law; laboring not to
find distinctions to help out a covetous lust, that it might not come within
compass of the lash; but lasheth his lust with the whip of the Law, (which
says, thou shall not covet) when it begins to move toward any thing which the
Law allows not If there be a lust that gives a Law to his members to war
against the Law of his mind, Romans 7.23.
he presently cries out (not as David, to Joab touching Absol^m, 2 Samuel 18.5.
deal gently for my sake with the Young man); but, as Paul unto God, O wretched
man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death? Romans 2.24.


If he find his heart unable to stand against such or such a lust, he gets out
of sight of that which might prove a tentation. He is so far from pleading for
sin, that he stops his ears, and silenceth all plea's for it. Conscience is
his bridle, lust his slave, which he will not only curb, but rather whip to
death, than suffer it to bribe conscience to give way unto it; or, reason, to
make it lawful. When the hypocrite, says, Amos 8.5.
when will the New Moon be gone, that we may sell Corn? and, the Sabbath, that
we may set forth Wheat? the true Christian says, when will the Sabbath come,
that I may shut up shop, and serve God in his house, rather than my best
customers in mine own? because the Sabbath is to him a delight, the holy of the
Lord. Ira. 5.8.
With him nothing is lawful, that lust cries up; and conscience cries down.

And when others borrow a point of the Law, in treading wine presses, bringing
in of sheaves and selling victuals on the Sabbath, under pretense of necessity,
and preserving the good creatures of God: he not only avoids such practices,
but testifies against them as bringing wrath upon Israel. Neh. 13.15 and 17.


In a word, thus, this hypocrite, in the immoderate seeking of earthly things,
impowreth Lust to give Law to Conscience in hope thereby to make his
Worldliness lawful; the true Christian gives Law to Lust, that conscience may
keep him off from unlawful Lusting: the one strives to make the narrow way of
God broader, that he may take in more of the World; the other seeks to make
the broad way of sin narrower, that there may be less room for the World.

The Worldly Hypocrite receives the things of the World, without respect to

As he is Worldly in seeking, so is he no less earthly in receiving the things
of the World. He takes them not in upon the account of Christ, either as an
Head, and he; a Member; or, as Christ is the Bridegroom; and he, the Bride; or,
as Christ is as heir of all things, Heb. 1.2.
and he, an heir of God; and joint heir with Christ: Romans 8.17.
nor looks he upon these things, as his because he is Christ's, and Christ is
Gods; 1 Cor. 3.13.
nor by virtue of the Covenant of Grace wherein God becomes his Father in
Christ by Grace of adoption; but rather, by the Covenant of nature, as his
Creator, whereby the Lord saves both man and beast Psalm. 36.6.
; and has given the earth to the children of men; Psalm. 115.16.
causing the Sun to rise on the evil as well as on the good. Mat. 5.46.
Or, as he rewards with outward favors, the outward and overly service of
hypocrites.

There is a Covenant of Nature which God ordinarily keeps, and a voice of
nature which God indifferently hears, as well in Ishmael Genesis 21.17.
as in Isaak; as well in the Young Ravens, Psalm. 147.9.
and Lions, Psalm. 104.21.
as in the children of men. And upon this ground this hypocrite goes unto God;
without seeking further to make out his title to them, as additions to his
share in the Kingdom of God and his righteousness. Mat. 6.23.
And the reason is, because not the cry of faith, but the voice of nature; yea,
of his Lust craveth these things at the hand of God, neither of which can go to
God as to a Father in Christ, but rather as to a Jupiter to help him, upon no
better account than the Heathens to their Idol, whom they apprehended as an
helping Father.

Nay, he receives these, in stead of Christ and the Covenant of Grace, As
Esau's mouth was stopped with a mess of pottage, in stead of the birth, right
Genesis 25.31 etc
. (which when he had sold, he despised) ver. 34.
; and with the fatness of the earth, in stead of the blessing Genesis 27.39.
. So this hypocrite, is well contented, if his belly be well filled, with a
portion in this life, whatever become of his share in the next: being willing
enough to take Christ's counsel (care not for to morrow,) Mat. 6.34.
in a contrary sense, by leaving off all thought for the morrow of the world to
come; but, laying out all his thoughts for the morrow of the present life. By
means whereof, as the fatting Ox is better fed than the laboring, So this
subject of Gods patience oft-times fares better in this world than many a
vessel of mercy.

On the Contrary, the true Christian receives all as the allowance of Christ,
Differ.
his head and husband, in the Covenant of grace.

He looks upon the most common earthly blessings as the fruit of the choicest
love of his Savior, and as a part of the Covenant sealed in his blood: without
which he finds no more taste in the greatest earthly mercy, than in the white of
an egg; nor more content, then Rachel found in all the kindness of Jacob,
without children Genesis 30.1.
of his body. This is that alone which gives relish and sweetness to all
blessings, when they are given with Christ, and for Christ; that he may see,
read, taste, and feed upon Christ in them. This makes every pittance like
Benjamins mess Genesis 43.34.
; and gives him evidence of more special affection from Joseph although others
have also messes sent unto them, and drink and are merry with them.

Esau had the fatness of the earth bequeathed to him, that was before given
unto Jacob. The Legacy was the same, but not the blessing. Esau's portion was a
fruit of natural relation, the blessing given to Jacob was more; even the fruit
of the Covenant of grace made with Abraham, as appears by that addition, cursed
be every one that curses thee, Genesis 27.29.
which was Abraham's privilege. The child that is heir, may at present have
less allowance then an hired servant: Genesis 12.3.
but in the issue he gets the start, because deeper in the Fathers love. And
although they sit at the same table (because the heir in his minority differs
not from a servant, though he be Lord of all; Gal. 4.1.
) Yet they sit there upon different accounts, as they stand under different
relations; and eat of the same meat upon different titles.

Abraham had many sons by Keturah, Genesis 25.1, 2, 3.
besides Ishmael by Hagar. But Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac Ver. 5.
. Not that the rest got nothing; for, he gave them all gifts, and sent them
away from Isaac his Son Ver. 6.
; but, that all which they had was nothing in comparison of Isaac's inheritance.

Thus, this Hypocrite receives earthly things as fruits of common favor; the
other as the pledges of special love; the one, by providence; the other, by
Covenant; the one as an hireling, the other as an heir: the one receives these
things as spoils gotten by hunting as Nimrod got Kingdoms; Esau, the mastery;
and Ishmael, maintenance; the other receives all from the hand of God in
Christ, from whom he is assured that he shall lack nothing that is good, and
saying of all he receives, as Jacob of his children, these are they whom God
has graciously given his servant Genesis 33.5.
. The one as a traitor in rebellion, lays hold on all he can, but usurpeth
whatever he enjoys the other as an offender pardoned, and restored in blood,
holds all by an indefeisable Title.

This Hypocrite thinks all he has to be but a little.

Let God be never so bountiful, this Hypocrite looks upon all as a small
pittance; as Lot upon Zoar, is it not a little one Genesis 19.20.
? He has an high opinion of every service he tendereth, how hypocritically
soever performed; and thinks he is neglected much (when he has most) in
respect of what he deserves: So that what the Psalmist sometimes spoke rashly
in a passion, Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
innocence, Psalm. 73.13.
this Hypocrite speaks upon deliberation seriously, as resolving to stand by
it. It is in vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his
Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before him Mal. 3.14.
. The returning them from captivity, the giving them liberty and opportunity of
building the City, the Temple; yea, their own houses, and that in a sumptuous
manner, while the house of the Lord lay waste Hag. 1.4.
, was nothing with them, while God plagued them in their estates for neglect of
his house ver. 9, 10, 11.
.

He considers not how little he deserves, but looks how much God gives unto
others, which his pride makes him think to be more due to him; and therefore
unthankful for what he receives. He looks for more than his penny for working
all day, if another receive as much who wrought but an hour: His eye is evil,
because his Lords is good, and thinks himself ill requited, for bearing the
burden and heat of the day, if another get as much (whose labor was less)
though bounty, although himself receive no less than his bargain Mat. 20.11,
12.
. He is as high with his heavenly Father if he do any thing for another more
then for him; as the brother of the Prodigal returning to his father, Thou
never gave me a kid that I might merry with my friends, etc. Luke 15.29.
Thus to a murmuring Israelite, Mannah from Heaven is not enough, unless he
may have flesh for his lust, as well as bread for his belly. Numb. 11.4, 5, 6.
Yea, when he has all, he thinks he possesses nothing because not all he
expected.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian thinking little of his merit, thinks much
of his reward.

Be it never so little, he unfeignedly acknowledges it to be more than he
deserves, to whom belongs nothing but confusion of face Dan. 9.8.
. If God make Jacob in stead of a naked traveling staff to pass over Jordan
with all, to become two bands, he quickly casts up the accounts of his merits
into a very small sum, I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and
of all the truth which thou have showed unto thy servant Genesis 32.10.
. He knows that Gods children are soon satisfied: Nature being content with
little, and grace with less, because assured, that the man that has it shall
be sure to want nothing that is good Psalm. 34.10.
.

Hence he is of Paul's spirit, when in prison, and living wholly upon alms of
charitable Christians, of Philippi, I have all, and abound, I am full, having
received from Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you Phil. 14.18.
. Having food and raiment he is therewith content: and now he is one having
nothing in the account of others, yet possesses all things 2 Cor. 6.10.
, because contented with such things as he has Heb. 13.5.
. He is more in prayer for abundance of grace then of wealth Psalm. 4.6. Prove.
30.8.
, then for abundance of wealth and a mediocrity of grace. He rather thinks he
has too much, then too little of the world, because he has not too much, but
too little of grace.

Thus this Hypocrites eye is more then his belly, and both too great, to be
thankful: the true Christian is rather astonished at the bounty which his eye
beholds, and thinks his eye too greedy, when satisfied with the least
proportion: the one sets too high a value upon his own service; the other sets
all the price upon Gods bounty; the former, thinks much he has no more; the
other, breaks forth with admiration, Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my
Fathers house, that thou have brought me hitherto 2 Samuel 7.18.
?

The worldly Hypocrite has sorrow with his sops, and more trouble with his
largest enjoyments

His sorrows and troubles are not from men for his profession of Religion, but
from God for his hypocrisy in it; and, from his riches, through his
Covetousness in seeking, or his evil conscience in compassing of them. This is
a perpetual Harpy at his feast, a vulture that feeds upon his heart, when he
feeds himself most up on his possessions. This is as the handwriting upon the
Wall unto King Belshazzer Dan. 6.5, 6.
, making him in the midst of his feasting, not only to change countenance,
but to be troubled in his thoughts. And rather then want tormentors, his love
of money will make him his own tormentor, to pierce himself through with many
sorrows 1 Timothy 6.10.
. If he now look toward Christ for a salve for this wound, all he gets there
is this, Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation Luke
6.24.
. And this, Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for the miseries that shall
come upon you Jam. 5.1.
. So is he that lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God
Luke 12.21.
. And, however he be not always in the furnace, yet he is always in the
danger, the fear whereof often torments him before the time: especially when he
finds and considers how much he has set his heart upon that which is not Prove.
23.5.
, and disquieted himself in vain Psalm. 39.6.
.

On the Contrary, The true Christian has two feasts in one. Differ.


The feast of food which cheereth his body, is accompanied with the continual
feast of a good conscience which reviveth his heart. Whether he has less or
more, the least pittance is better then great treasure and trouble therewith,
Prove. 15.16.
which arises from it. He eats of the labor of his hands, and it is well
with him Psalm. 128.2.
. Yea, he has a feast, without a feast even in fasting his conscience feasteth
him, Prove. 15.15.
and makes him to rejoice even in tribulation. The blessing of God makes rich,
and he adds no sorrow with it. Prove. 10.22.
Not that a godly man meets with no sorrow; for, who more persecuted and
oppressed? Isai. 59.15. 2 Timothy 3.12.
But this is his comfort, that he has never the more sorrow from his riches.
Envy may malign him, and so cause him sorrow for his riches: but conscience
does not gaul him within, nor are his riches as a burden to his soul, that when
he has swallowed down riches, he is constrained to vomit them up, because God
shall cast them out of his belly, Job 20.6.
as he did the thirty pieces of Silver which Judas bought so dear Mat. 27.3.
.

Thus, this Hypocrite, even in laughter, has his heart sorrowful, and the end
of his mirth is heaviness Prove. 14.13.
; the true Christians sorrow occasioned by things of the world, is ever
accompanied with joy in God: the one has a fast in his feast; the other a
feast in his fast: the former has sorrow from God when the world like Delilah,
lets him sleep in her lap Judge. 10.19.
; the other comfort himself in the Lord his God, when the world, like the
men of Ziklag, speak of stoning him 1 Samuel 30.6.
.

This Hypocrites joy in God falls or rises, as God lets the world ebb or
flow in upon him.

If he receive not these earthly things, he is all amort: his hope perishes,
and his heart, as Nabals, dies within him, for the loss of a few raisins and
figs, although given to save his life 1 Samuel 25.37.
. He says, I trust in God, but if the world fail him, his trust vanishes. If
the world smile, and lade him with thick clay, he is then a jovial zealot, a
great sacrificer to his net, burning incense to his drag, because by these his
portion is fat, and his meat plenteous H^b. 1.16.
; and for his better grace, says, Blessed be God, for I am rich Zech. 11.5.
. But if God cross him in the world, he cannot bear up, but discovers his want
of faith, and despaires of the help of God. And well may his trust fail him,
when Mammon his god forsakes him.

If he be in present want, or but conceit of a want, who can hold him up, or
bear up his spirit! He will rather question Gods omnipotence, then give way to
faith in dark times to believe it. Can God furnish a table in the wilderness
Psalm. 78.19.
? If the Lord would make windows in heaven, can this be 2 Kings 7.2.
? He is better at queries that argue his own infidelity, then studious to give
glory to God, and to live by faith in extremity. An unbelieving heart thinks
that impossible to God, which is not within compass of humane reason and hope.
He that in truth believes not in the true God, thinks nothing possible but what
is within the reach of the creature; nor comfortable, but that whereof man is
in present possession. He likes well a God that will be at his whistle; but not
such a God as will prefer his own wisdom to man's, in dispencing his blessings.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian having God for his pertion, rejoices in God
however the world goes with him.

If God set him out a plentiful proportion of outward blessings, he rejoices
in the love that bestows them, more then in the blessings bestowed. And because
he knows this love is unchangeable, he will not change his thoughts of God, nor
abate of his joy in him, when God (who is always as good as wise) makes an
alteration in his outward condition. Job is the same when God sweeps all away,
as when he poured in abundance upon him Job 1.2.
. If not only his estate, but his heart begin to lag and flag, yet he sets up
this resolution from which he will never go, God is the strength of my heart
and my portion for ever Psalm. 73.26.
.

Even with the best portion on earth, God is his chiefest portion, without whom
he accounts himself miserable in the midst of abundance of earthly blessings.
Heaven it self is too little to be accounted a portion to him that has God for
his own. If he find God there, he is satisfied: Whom have I in heaven but
thee? And if God be his God, he cares for no more. This makes him say and sing,
of whatever outward estate God of his grace affords, The lines are fallen
unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage Psalm. 16.6.
. Why? But because, the Lord himself is the portion of his inheritance, and of
his cup, and it is God that maintains his lot, making it to stand by him, and
to be sufficient for him.

When God gives most, he dares not trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in
the living God, who gives richly all things to enjoy 1 Timothy 6.17.
. When God gives least, he knows that God denies not himself in whom are all
good and perfect givings, but says, as unto Aaron who had no lot among his
brethren, I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel Numb
18.20
. Thence, the believer concludes, I shall not want Psalm. 23 1.
: but goodness and truth shall follow me all the days of my life Ver. 6.
. For even when he seems to have nothing, he possesses all things, upon this
very account that he is Christ's, and Christ is Gods 1 Cor. 3.23.
, of whom are all things, and the believer in him 1 Cor. 8.6.
: and that it is an infinite advantage to be heir of all that God has to give,
both in heaven and in earth, either in prosperity, or in exchange with
advantage, although at present this heir differs nothing, in outward
condition, from a servant?

Well may he say, when I have nothing, I want nothing, because I have God who
is unto me all things. Gal. 4.1.
If he be under a Tyrant, as Israel under Pharaoh; he can yet say, Thou art my
King, O God, command deliverances for Jacob Psalm. 44.4.
. If under a bad Master, as Jacob under Laban: he knows that he that is
called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lords freeman 1 Cor. 7.22.
. It may be he has a bad wife, as Job had, yet is he married to the Lord in
righteousness, in judgment, in loving kindness, and in mercies Hos. 2.19.
. Perhaps, the believing wife has a bad husband, as Abigail, yet she has a
better at the same time, without danger of Law: for, her Maker is her husband
Isai. 54.5.
. He may have an undutiful and rebellions son, as David had in Absalom; an
unfaithful friend, like to Ahitophel; rebellious subjects, like those that
clave to Absalom, yet it cannot be said that he serves not a good master, who
is in stead of, and better then all relations unto him.

Thus this Hypocrite is as the brain which rises higher, or falls lower in
the brain-pan, as the Moon increases or decreaseth; the true Christian is as
the Sun that keeps one constant tenor of light and heat, even in the midst of
Winter: the one has his chief dependence upon earth, and so is affected as
that flows in, or runs out from him; the other depending wholly upon God,
lives upon him, when the earth fails him, and so rejoices always, although
not always alike.

The Worldly Hypocrite has his heart set upon the things of the

He makes not God his strength, but trusts in the abundance of his riches
Psalm. 52.7.
. This is his strong City, and as an high wall in his imagination Prove. 18.11.
. This makes him high and proud, to slight all above him, and to scorn all
below him. To conceit himself the wisest, the best, the most godly, because
richest: and so, none more incapable of the true riches. All pride is an enemy
to grace: and none so much as purse-pride: the word has no worse subject, nor
the ministry a worse friend. He accounts himself wise enough; for, he has
wherewithal; and so will learn nothing: Godly enough, for God prospers him;
therefore he cares not for more godliness: and honest enough, for the world
trusts him: therefore he will not be thought to stand in need to be minded of
honesty. Thus with the fork of pride, he keeps off the rake of grace.

He has this worlds goods so, as he is rather had of them as a conquered
slave, then enjoyes them as a Master. He is even bridled, and saddled, and
ridden by them, as the pro^^ horse, which is not only ridden and managed, but
lash't and spur-gall'd by his rider. And whereas man should be as a tree
inversed, whose root is in heaven, this Hypocrite is a man reinversed, and
turned into a tree, whose head and heart is mored in the earth, and heaven set
at his heels. And so, in earthly things he enlarges his desire as hell, and
is as death that cannot be satisfied: whereas in heavenly things his affections
are more then moderated; for they are quite thrust out of door, by the
impetuousness of the other, as good meat out of the stomach before it be
concocted to afford nutriment to the body.

Contrarily, The true Christian when his hand is most upon the world, Differ.
his heart is above it.

If riches increase, he remembers his rule, not to set his heart upon them
Psalm. 62.10.
. He knows there is a glutinous quality in them to glue the heart strongly to
them, if the heart suffer it self to come too near them; Therefore he keeps off
from it, as from pitch that will defile him, and from poison that will infect
and invenome him. He looks upon the things of the world as lumber, not as his
treasure; and therefore keeps them off in out-roomes, and will not bring them
into his Jewel-house or Treasury, to take up room there, and to turn God and
grace out of doors.

He is willing to use them, but afraid to love them. He sets his affections on
things above, and not on things below Col. 3.2
. If the affections be once clogged by things below, the soul will have a hard
pull to get them freed, and harder to fly to heaven with such a millstone about
her neck. Therefore he keeps off his heart as fire from tow; and while he does
so he is sure to have his desires at command, that otherwise would command him
as their vassal.

A little of that we love not, but use only for necessity, will serve our
turns: nor are we apt to complain of too little (...) it: no more than men
necessitated to take physic, do usually find fault that the potion is too
small. Where need is the cause of desire, desire is soon satisfied, because
necessities are soon supplied. But where desire causes need, the need
multiplies and is unmeasurable, and causes desire to go beyond all the
daughters of the horse-leech, that cry, give, give; and to exceed hell, and the
grave, which never says it is enough Prove. 30.15, 16.
. The Christian therefore limiteth himself to necessaries, and confineth his
appetite to necessities in earthly things, that so he may open his mouth wider
that God may fill it with heavenly Psalm. 81.10.
. Then, can he be without worldly things, and not want them; or, if he want
what others have, yet he needs not any thing requisite for himself to have.

Thus this Hypocrite turns the things of the world into bird-lime, that do so
entangle and clog the wings of his soul, that in stead of making a flight to
heaven, he becomes a prey to the fowler; the true Christian turns them into
sails, that further his voyage to glory 1 Timothy 6.18, 19.
: the one puts them on as an helmet which he cannot be without; the other
throws them off as Saul's Armor, as being too heavy, and an intanglement to
him 2 Timothy 2.4.
.

The worldly Hypocrite is at home in this world.

He talks of Heaven, but is loath to leave the World; and while he is in it, he
takes more care to setle here, then to provide for his departure. He is like a
Wooer that talks much of being gone, that he may be entreated to stay; wherein
if he fail, he stays without entreaty, and is loath to depart when he can stay
no longer. Even when he sees that wise men die, and fools perish and leave
their wealth to others, whatever he may talk of leaving the world, yet his
inward thought is, that his house shall continue for ever, and his dwelling
place to all generations, and therefore he calls his Lands after his own name
Psalm. 49.10, 11.
: not that it is simply sinful to call his own Lands by what name he pleases,
more than to give names to whatever he enjoys: but this is his sin, that by
naming his Lands after his own name, he declares his desire at least to enjoy
those Lands for ever; and makes that very naming of them to be a motive to his
son, to be of the same opinion.

He is like those bad husbands that being never at home, yet wherever they be,
they are never from home. An Inn is to them as their own habitation; yea,
better if it give more content to their lusts, as usually it does, that it may
enjoy them longer, although it undo them the sooner. Do but feed his lusts, he
never desires other heaven. Let him be but assured it shall always be so, he
never thinks of other home; and if he have any other, it is rather his grief
that he must return to it, than his joy that he has another home to go unto.
But what a vain, yea mad thing is it for a man to think himself at home in the
house of his pilgrimage?

Great men think they have great reason to love the world, because the world
makes much of them: So has the Devil too, who is better served then the best
and greatest of them. But were great men so wise as they should be, and take
themselves to be; yea, had they but a dram or scruple of that wisdom of which
they pretend to be the sole owners, they would soon discern that all the
smiles of the world are but the fawnings of an enemy, and therefore not to be
trusted, unless by those who have a mind to give power to their enemy to
undo them.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is a stranger and pilgrim where he enjoyes
most of the world 1 Pet. 2.11.
.

If true title be disputed, the godly has more right to the world then the
wicked: but, if inclination be considered, he that has the best right is most
willing to part with it: Not as despising the least blessings of God, but as
valuing the hopes of a better inheritance at an higher rate. Wherefore, as
Joseph in Egypt, notwithstanding his preferment to be the second in the
Kingdom, accounted himself a pilgrim, and gave Commandment concerning his
bones Heb. 11.22.
, to be carried into Canaan (as showing his faith in the promise, rather then
accounting an earthly Canaan, the true and last rest that remains to the
people of God:) So the true Christian will not by any of his actions give any
man just cause to think that he looks upon himself as having here any abiding
City; but, that he seeks one to come Heb. 13.14.
: and looks upon the world with a double aspect.

First, as Gods highway paved for the commodity of Travelers, that travail
to seek the face of God; and as a storehouse of provision for those that
travail that way; and is thankful for all provisions he finds in his journey.
He indents not for a great estate, but is content with a pilgrims allowance;
food, lodging, and raiment are enough for a pilgrim; and, things necessary, for
a stranger. He leaves others to look and hunt after great places and things in
the world, he is in his journey, and minds them not. If God will let him carry
the bagg and bottle himself, he is careful to preserve it, and thankful for
being trusted with it. If God will keep it in his own Land, he looks on him as
his Father, and doubts not but to live comfortably on his fathers allowance.

As for the small portion which he craveth in this life, under the notion of
daily bread, he uses it without distrustful care for to morrow: and looks
upon it as his journal provision, not as his prepared inheritance. He would
willingly serve God here, without worldly reward, which he never receives, but
he looks upon it as a debt, not from God that bestows it, but in himself that
receives it. If he could here live of nothing of the world, that would please
him as well, as if God gave him all things; but, seeing he cannot, he comforts
himself with this, that he shall once do it in heaven. And so, as Abraham and
the Patriarchs, were first pilgrims in Canaan, and, after, Lords, in their
posterity: so this man is first a pilgrim here, and afterward an inheritor in
glory. Rev. 2.26.


Secondly, he looks upon it too, as Satan's armory of tentations, as his shop
of vanities, and pack of trinkets, where (like Ulysses) he has baits for all,
even a sword and armor for Achilles, but such as he can easily pierce; and a
Deianeira's shirt for Hercules, but such as will make him run mad: so that, the
most generous cannot escape him. In regard whereof the Christian stands upon
his guard, resolving not to trust the world although he hold some
correspondence with it; holding commerce with it, but not seeking the
friendship of it: He drinks of this brook in the way, as the dog does of Nilus,
running for fear of the Crocadile. He is like him that setting forth to Sea,
loses sight of the shore, as hastening onwards all he can, to another
Country, lest Pirates surprise him in his voyage.

Thus this hypocrite is like Lot lingering in Sodom, when all is like to be
destroyed, and himself with it; the true Christian thinks every minute a year
wherein he is constrained to dwell in Mesech: The one is as Behemoth, that
thinks to swallow Jordan with his mouth, and therefore is never well till he be
drowned with over-drinking: the other is as David, who will not drink a drop of
the well of Bethlehem, when he found it to be the price of their blood that
adventured to fetch it: the former, seems to put out to Sea, (as the other
does,) but still creeps by the Coast, and is ready to put in at every Creek,
a sign that he never intended a long voyage: the other, hoiseth sail
launcheth forth into the deep, and is glad to see the world going from him, and
himself from the World.

The Worldly hypocrite is as much out in the valuing of the things of the
world, as in the

Sometimes he places his happiness in them; happy are the people that are in
such a case. Psalm 144.15.
. Then he overvalues them, and undervalues God the giver of them; as Eli
honored his sons above God: 1 Samuel 2.29
yet even then, he takes none but the natural, or sensual use of them; and so
makes not that benefit he might by well using the Mammon of unrighteousness.
He makes them to be drudges to his lust, that might be wings to his soul, and
so undervalues them most, when he seems most to prize them, because he uses
them not to his best advantage, but to satisfy his worser part. Wealth and
friends (says one) are no possession to him that knows not how to use them;
whereas enemies are beneficial to him that knows how to improve them.

Sometimes he seems to contemn them, but it is out of ignorance, or a worldly
heart. Out of ignorance when he would be thought to despise the world, he knows
not why, nor wherefore, as they speak: as Countrymen cry out against courtly
delights and favors, because unacquainted with them; which did they know, none
should hasten thereunto more than they Eccles. 2.25.
. The bramble, Judge. 9.15.
hearing of sovereignty, could presently take it upon him; and say, come, put
your trust in my shadow; if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and consume
the Cedars of Lebanon. Thus some, whose necess^^y and ignorance make them
strangers to all ingenuous education, and to the free and comfortable use and
improvement of earthly advantages, do trample on the more high fare and
provisions of others, with a greater pride, as Plato said of Diogenes, there
being more ignorance in that contempt, than pride in the use of the thing
contemned.

Sometimes he does thus, with a worldly heart that aims at what he seems to
despise, and therefore despises them, because he cannot hope to compass them.
For, as the Parthian, in his wars was wont to shoot, and fly, all at once; So
this hypocrite shootes at the world in hope to gain it, even when he flies it,
under pretense of contemning it. Either he makes himself poor and seems to
despise the world, when he has great riches and hawks at more; or if he be
poor, without hope to be rich, there is the more reason to suspect his
contempt, as proceeding from envy, or as savouring of the foxes humor; that
despised the grapes because he could not come at them. Thus diverse, when fallen
into disgrace, have written of the contempt of the Court, and bidden adieu to
the world; not as being above it, but as having lost themselves in it, without
hope of recovering their former luster.

Sometimes he condemns them as simply evil, because he will not be at the
charge and trouble to keep them. Worldly things bring with them both a delight,
and a charge. This hypocrite will be quit of the one rather then undergo the
other; as Democritus who left his lands and suffered them to be laid common,
and waste, rather than be troubled to manure and improve them. Crates would
rather drown his silver in the Sea, than be in danger by keeping it, to be
drowned by it: as if there were no way to escape drowning in perdition, but the
destroying of innocent silver, which might have been a refreshing to many, and
a comfort to him, had he so employed it. Thus, some refuse the comforts of
life, because others abuse them; not considering the root of the abuse to be in
those that pervert them, not in the things which are so abused; and so they sin
as much in not using what God freely befloweth, as they who abuse what was
given to a better purpose. Ahaz sinned as much, and tempted God as far in
refusing a sign when God bade him ask it, Jsa. 7.11.12.
as they who except they see signs and wonders, will not believe: Joh. 4.44..
both being hypocrites in grain.

Thus is he in and out, up and down, both in their use and value, setting his
own price upon them without weighing them aright, or bringing them to the test
of the Word. And although it be natural to several complexions to differ in
their rates of worldly things, some setting less by one thing, some by
another; (as, the Melancholic person sets light by pleasures; the Sanguine, by
profits, the Phlegmatic by fame; the Choleric, by safety;) yet it is not so
much natural inclination, as a perverse disposition and choice in this
hypocrite, to weigh all in his own balance; to value all by his own estimate,
or at least by the opinion of others, rather than by the standard of God, or
the rate which God puts upon it: and, to take the worlds own word for the
price, rather than to go to God to know the true worth of the things.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian both uses and valueth the things of the
World, according to God.

The use that God teaches, he puts them to; the price God sets them at, he is
content to give for them: and, at the same, to part with them. He makes a
spiritual and supernatural use of earthly things, because himself is heavenly.
He sees God in them, as Jacob in his children and riches, Genesis 33.5
and he enjoyes God in them, as he that lives not only by bread. He values them
not only according to their natural use, but their supernatural appointment to
be as pledges of more high, and spiritual blessings; as Abraham, and the
fathers looked upon Canaan, not only as a type, but as an assurance of a better
inheritance.

His contempt of the World is not out of humor, but grace; not out of
ignorance but the knowledge he has attained both of it and a better. He is as
the Vine, and the Fig Tree, able to give a reason of his refusal of great
things in the World, which the bramble ignorantly embraces. Judge. 9.
Shall he leave the state of grace, his sweet communion with God and the hope
of glory, for a little worldly pelf, or preferment? The Worldling knows not
what the child of God embraces, but the child of God knows what the World
either vainly magnifieth, or ignorantly refuses: Yea further, he knows not
only the good of them, but how to use them to profit: how to want them without
damage, and how to abound in them without sin; to want without murmuring, and
to abound without abuse. He compares the good with the evil; and understands
not only the slippery condition to which they are subject, but the dangerous
tentations to which they expose him: therefore he is more afraid of fullness,
then of want, as knowing there are more that, being full, deny God, and say who
is the Lord; than through poverty, steal, and take the Name of God in vain.
Prove. 30.9.


Nor does he trample on Plato's pride with Diogenes his heart, but with David's
spirit, and with affections set upon things above. He counts all things
below, but dross and dung; not as scorning to be beholding to God, or as
hawking after the vain applause of carnal men for so doing, but because he has
fixed his eye and his heart upon things that are heavenly. He can take joyfully
the spoiling of his goods, knowing in himself that he has a better and an
enduring substance: Heb. 10.34.
and can esteem reproach for Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt,
as knowing and eying the recompense of reward. Heb. 11.26.


He shows his Contempt of the World by his sober use thereof: and, as
Navigators have learned to take the height of the Sun, by the shadow, without a
direct aspect which might dazel and endanger their sight, so the true Christian
takes the estimate of worldly things, by a safe and harmless experience of
their vanity, without endangering himself by too much gazing upon the Luster
and Splendour of them.

When he contemns them, it is only for the abuse, not as being unlawful to be
used. He so contemns them, that he yet esteems them good in their kind:
and, so rejects them, that he retayneth an honorable memory of Gods bounty
in them. He considers their use as well as the abuse; and that they are
talents as well as tentations. Therefore, if God will, he receives them; while
God will, he keeps them; as God will, he employeth them: and when God will,
he willingly parts with them, as glad to give up his account, and to receive
a discharge. And as for, the abuse, he knows the World to be vain, therefore
not to be loved; and evil, therefore not to be trusted; yet so far as, through
mercy, God makes it a reconciled enemy, Job. 5.23. Prove. 16.7.
it may profitably (if warily) be employed.

And as for the price, which is set upon earthly Commodities, he weighs the
world in one scale, and heaven in another: for no man can judge rightly of
either, but he that weighs both together, and observes the difference of the
Counterpoise. Nor will any balance serve for this trial but that of the
sanctuary. Thither will he therefore go, and there he shall understand the
difference between the worldling and the true Believer by the ends of both.
Psalm. 73.17.
This balance will soon pronounce Tekel, upon the World, as finding it too
light Dhn. 5.27.
. and will also make manifest that the things of heaven are full weight, and
that the end of him that embraces them is peace. Psalm. 37.37.


He knows that worldly things weighed by themselves may be esteemed as every
man will, that has a mind to be deceived: but, compared with heavenly, God
himself must award the difference. Every man may set price upon Counters, and
reckon them for as much as he pleases, but only Kings set rates upon Coin: so
every man may value worldly things, but heavenly things have their price, as
well as their worth only from Christ, and from those who in him are made Kings,
and know how to rate them. And, in rateing, the Christian considers these
differences in good things, some, the World can both give, and take away, as
wealth, and honor; some, it can give, but not take away, as Learning and
skill: some, it can take away, but not give, as life and health: some, it can
neither give, nor take away, as Grace and Glory. Of all which, those are
better, over whom the World has less power, and those best, over which the
world and the God of the world have none, and which the God of heaven himself
will neither take away or withhold Psalm. 84.11.
. And this the Christian chooses as the best part, which shall not be taken
from him. Luke 10.42.


Thus, this hypocrite abuses the World in the using of it; the true Christian
uses it, as not abusing it; the one sets too high a price upon things below,
because he weighs them in a false balance, the other, brings them to their
true rate, because he weighs them in the balance of the sanctuary: the one
despises them, because he cannot get or keep them, and so makes a virtue of
necessity; the other is not careful to get them, because he contemnes them, so
far as they carry him off from God, and so, he makes a necessity of virtue.

The Worldly Hypocrite contemns this World, without exchange for a better.

He seems much incensed with this present World as an enemy to God, yet never
seeks in truth to make God his friend. He is weary of this World, rather for
the crosses and troubles of it, than for the sweetness and comfort he finds in
God. Thus the Israelites forsook (and after repented their forsaking) the fish
which they eat freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the mellons, the leekes, onions,
and garlike. Number. 11.5.
Without taking hold (so solidly and effectually as they ought) of the promise
of Canaan, and therefore, not only murmured, but quarrelled at every cross
providence which met them by the way: and so, in their own opinions at least,
were not gainers, but losers by leaving Egypt. No man leaves the World to his
profit, that did not first take hold of God. He that cleaves to the World as a
friend, is an enemy to God: and he that leaves the World, not having made his
peace with God, is an enemy to himself; like him that being at Sea, sets fire
on his Ship, before he come to his harbor; or, casts off an old friend,
before he make sure of a new.

This can be no true or comfortable contempt of the World, which is made
without laying hold of another of more worth. And although it be not the
letting go of the substance to catch a shadow; yet, it is the parting with a
shadow without hope of a substance; and so, to lose all for nothing. To
contemn riches for fame, life for honor, pleasure for pride, and all, to have
his will; is but to exchange one World for another; a bad, for a worse; and, to
add folly to his pride, sin to his misery; and, to put himself into a condition
of sin out of measure sinful, and, into a condition of misery beyond expression
miserable.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian never parts with this World, but he is sure
of a better.

He can let go his lead, when he is sure of gold in the room. He is not so
unwise, as to forsake the World for nothing: nor so foolish as to part with a
present in-come, for a more uncertain revenue. If he shake hands with perishing
things, it is because he is sure of more durable riches and honor; or, at
least, has them in his eye, and makes toward them with all his might, not
without more than probability of success. Although he be a plain man as Jacob
was, yet he is not so simple, as to part with his pottage, until he had
bargained for the birthright. Genesis 25.33 34.


He is not a Pilgrim for nothing; or, barely to see sights, and make visits,
for other men's profit more than his own; to enrich the Priests who show him
relics, with impoverishing of himself by his travels and offerings. But, as
seeking a Country, a better Country; that is, an heavenly; Heb. 11.16.
not so much to coast it, as to enjoy it. An house and a Country, every man
must have, if not other where, then here; so says the Worldling: If not here
then elsewhere, so says the Christian.

Thus this hypocrite while he confesses a bird in the hand to be worth two in
the bush, lets go that in his hand, without hope of so much as one in the bush.
The true Christian makes sure of better than of two in the bush, before he part
with that in his hand, how meanly so ever esteemed by him. The one, as Esau,
parts with his birthright, without making sure of the blessing; the other, as
Jacob had an eye to the blessing, before he would part with so much as a mess
of pottage to purchase the birthright.

This Hypocrite, when it comes to spending, or giving, gives words rather than

Sometimes he is called upon for a work of charity, or piety; and, knowing how
infamous Nabal still is, for a flat denial of supply to David, 1 Samuel 25.
he will seem to do somewhat, although that something be nothing. And albeit
good words do butter no parsnips (as, in the proverb;) yet words are the best
gift he means to bestow, as being best cheap, and of some use to put off a
suitor, if not to save his own credit. If a brother, or sister be naked, and
destitute of daily food, He says unto them, depart in peace, be ye warmed and
filled, but gives them nothing that is needful to the body, to do it with all
Jam. 2.15.16
. Bare words argue a cold charity, and, cold charity merciless hypocrisy.
And, who so boasts himself of a false guilt, is like clouds and wind without
rain. Pro. 25.14


He that most passionately wayleth over his neighbors misery, and helps him
not, is like him that with tears looks on the lively acting of a Tragedy,
yet mourns not for them whose misery is then represented. Many there are
whose seeming and wordy love is guilty of such dissimulation, who are full of
sugared words, deep complements, large Professions, Superfluous humilities; and
all, to save charges: Such men have a reward suitable, to be counted very
courteous and civil to those that prove them not, or need them not: but cruel
and hard-hearted to all that need them.

On the Contrary, the true Christians hand out-doeth his tongue. Differ.


His hand shall be doing, where his tongue is silent his alms shall be real,
but without a Trumpet. Mat. 6.2.
If it be a private charity, he is so far from blazing it with his tongue,
that he keeps secret from the one hand what is done by the other, ver. 8.
because he does it not for ostentation, but out of duty, wherein he will
follow the rule of his Lord, not the course of the hypocrite. And being afraid
lest his tongue in promising should out-go his hand in performing, he rather
prevents expectation, than seeks to raise it, causing his alms to be as quick
and sudden, as it is secret, unless where some expectation is necessary for
the greater benefit and comfort of the receiver.

In promising he is slow, but yet not slothful in doing more than he thinks fit
to promise. In doing of good (which he never forgets) he is as quick as Jacob
in providing savory meat for his aged father Isaac, so soon as the Lord brings
it to his hand. Genesis 27, 20.
He would not put off his father, by saying, it is Corban that is a gift by
whatsoever thou may be profited by me Mat. 15.5.
; but honors his father and mother, as his father, and mother. And delights
more in doing his duty, then his parents can in receiving his supply.

Nor, is he only for natural relations, but does good unto all, especially to
the household of faith Gal. 6.10.
, and he not only works good, but is rich in good works; not taking his
scantling by the practice of others who perhaps are behind him in estates; but,
from those who go furthest in works of piety and charity, or rather from God
himself, who is kind to the unthankful and evil. Luke 6.35.


Thus, the hypocrite is like sounding brass or a tinkling Cymbal, that make a
loud noise, but nourish not: the true Christian is as the silent rain that
refreshes the earth when it is weary, no man scarce knowing how: The one is as
Ziba making larg promises to David, 2 Samuel 9.9.10.11.
to take care of Mephibosheths estate, not intending to promote it, but to
supplant him. 2 Samuel 16.2.
The other is as Joseph, that sent to his father Jacob, not only a parcel of
good words to cheer him, but all necessaries to feed him, and Wagons to carry
him, even when the good old man could scarce believe the report, or knew him to
be alive.

The Worldly Hypocrite, if he must be at any charge, he will spend upon Gods
account, and

If he be to maintain a Minister, it shall be out of Tithes and offerings,
which he sacrilegiously usurpeth: here perhaps the Minister shall have ten or
twenty pounds, where the Appropriator receives two or three hundred pounds. But
whatever it be, he pays it out of Gods purses, not his own. If he be rated to
some extraordinary assessement, he thinks it now no robbery to rob God in
tithes Mal. 3.8.
, and to pinch on the Parsons side (as the saying is) to make up his
extraordinary payments, out of Gods part.

He will favor, at least, connive at swearing, ignorance, profaneness,
drunkenness, etc. in his servants, if he may have the more work for the less
wages. He can suffer them to make bold with the Lords day, that they may look
for no ease or liberty all the week after: and diverse such arts he has, to get
love and praise, and to spare his purse.

He gives the world to God, but with condition that God shall restore it to
him again with interest. As Monks leave private estates, to live like Princes
on the revenues of their Covent; so this hypocrite seems very willing to part
with a piece of his estate, in hope to get more by parting with it, then he
could have expected by keeping of it.

He entertaineth such of whom he may make benefit, with all manifestations of
love and strength of affection: but, in the next bargain or contract, they
shall be sure to pay a dear shot; as guests in an Inn, that pay soundly for
all their good words and welcome, as well as for what provisions they called
for. He inviteth those who will invite him again to better fare: or, at least
commend and applaud him for his noble entertainment. He sometimes gives gifts
and presents, but with hope that all his gifts after the fetching of a
compass, will return with advantage. He lets his money fly, as boys do Kites,
in a string, that when he will, he may say (and make good his saying) retraham
ad me illud fugitivum argentum: I will draw in to me that fugitive silver. Even
alms are made a Merchandise, when given for some man's sake, that must owe a
good turn to him or his that gives them. And his purpose of a work of charity
hereafter, is proclaimed with a trumpet, to bear out his present bribery, or
oppression, which otherwise would not be endured.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian will spend, and be spent for God, without
respect to himself.

He advances Gods service, although with his own detriment. He will not serve
God with that which cost him nothing; but, accounts all as nothing which he
spends in Gods service. He will not pull down a stone of Gods, to build up his
own house; but chooses rather to pull down his own, to build up Gods. He is
afraid of sacrilege in himself, more then of luxury in others: because the
one, if committed, will cost him deer: the other, if proved, will light only on
others. And as for private affairs, he seeks the best servants, not the best
cheap: the best for Gods honor, although not best for his own profit in a
worldly way: yet not without hope, that while God is honored, himself shall
be better served, and obtain a blessing by means of his servant, although not
so profitable in his service.

He casts his bread upon the waters Eccles. 11.1.
, not as carelessly squandring, or profusely lavishing it where there is no
need, but giving it where there is need, although no likelihood of return. In
Alms, he respects rather humanity than the man, his duty rather then the
others desert; nature more then the goodness of the receiver; and grace, above
both. He gives, out of love to God, for which Christ himself will be the
debtor, and play master; and is loath to be paid here, to the prejudice of that
reward. In invitements, he is more in inviting those that cannot invite him
again, although he sometimes invites others, to maintain friendly
neighborhood, and to cherish love. He had rather be still doing good, living,
that his works may follow him dying; then to delay doing good, till after he
can do no more evil; and, that his whole conversation should be honest, and
praise him in the gate, rather then hope to get fame by some one action, after
he is settled in his long home.

Thus, this Hypocrite, in serving of God, serves none less; the true
Christian in doing service, accounts it both his gain and honor to serve God
most: The one accounts it detriment to be at charge for God, the other esteems
it his greatest gain to lay out any thing for him. The one resolves to be a
gainer where God is a loser; The other will lose all; rather then God should
not gain by him.

This Hypocrites hopes and comforts perish with these perishing things.

Although he cannot but know and find that all earthly things perish in the
using, and with the using Col. 2.22.
: that God will destroy both the belly and the meat that feeds it 1 Cor. 6.13.
; that man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he
possesses Luke 12.15.
; that riches profit not in the day of wrath Prove. 11.4.
, that they certainly make themselves wings, and flee away as an Eagle, ere he
be aware Prove. 23.5.
; yet when he sees any of this come to pass, and that all for which he trusted
in God is gone, and that this uncertain pawn of Gods love is fetched away,
his heart like Nabals, dies like a stone within him: then, away goes faith,
conscience, and comfort: and he is ready to say in desperation, Ego quoque una
ipse pereo. I also perish together with them.

He finds the curse of Simon Magus, (thy money perish with thee Acts 8.20.
) to seize, yea to be doubled upon him: for there the money continued till the
man perished* here the man perishes because the money continued not; and this
proves his consumption, which he looked upon as his consummation: so that, as a
rush without mire can no longer flowrish; so a worldling, when his wealth and
earthly comforts forsake him, dies downward, and, with Rachel, he refuses to
be comforted, because these things are not.

Contrariwise, the true Christian holds fast his comforts, Differ.
when he can no longer hold earthly things.

As his hopes, so his comforts depend not on transitory things: therefore when
earthly things vanish, he is not troubled, because that whereon his hopes and
comforts are built, perishes not, but stands by him for ever. When he is feign
to confess that his flesh and his heart too, do both fail him; yet then, God
is the strength of his heart and his portion for ever Psalm. 73.26.
. He has always his meditata in commoda, his premeditated disasters, so as he
looks upon these things as lost, even while he enjoyes them; and, by that
means, enjoyes himself, when these come to be lost. He is impoverished, and
dies every day in the preparation of his heart; and so, by dying daily, the
bitterness of death is past, before it come at him; and the discouragement of
poverty is over, before it come upon him, so that it comes not as an armed man;
but, as spoiled of its armor, and so does him no hurt.

He remembers that the more and longer use he has had of these worldly
commodities, the nearer the time of his parting with them approaches: and that
it were great ingratitude to think much of restoring the borrowed thing. And,
because he served not God for them, he can the better, with Job, both serve and
trust God without them.

He needs not fear a storm that is above the Moon; nor he to be troubled with
fear of nakedness that is clothed with the Sun. He that is owner of large
Territories, need not break his heart nor his sleep, because some one cottage
in it is burnt to ashes; nor he that is heir to heaven, to be bereft of his
comforts, because things on earth go not so well as he would have them. Did his
life consist in these things, there were some cause to be troubled; but seeing
he can live without them, why should he dye for them? It was Jonah's passion
(unworthy of a Prophet, yea of an ordinary believer) not his faith becoming the
meanest Christian, to be so angry for the withering of his gourd, of which the
true Christian takes warning, that he fall not into the same perplexity.

He that can willingly endure the spoiling of his goods by men, will patiently
bear, when God takes possession of his own, without his prejudice that parts
with it.

Thus, this Hypocrite when God takes any thing from him, he runs after it,
crying, as Micah after the Danites, when they carried away his gods Judge. 18.24.
; the true Christian is as David at Ziglag, when the Amalakites had swept all,
and the inhabitants spoke of stoning him, he encouraged himself in the Lord his
God 1 Samuel 30.6.
; the one, when these things are demanded by the true owner, follows them, as
Phaltiel did his wife, weeping when recovered by David, her first and true
husband 2 Samuel 3.16
; the other, parts with them, as the Eunuch with Philip; who being taken away
that the Eunuch saw him no more, the Eunuch went on his way with rejoicing Acts
8.39.
. Or, as David, who after he perceived his child was dead, he arose and did
eat 2 Samuel 12.20
.

The Worldly Hypocrite is very unwilling to settle his VVorldly estate.

He talks much of going out of the world; but, finds ^o much to do in it, and
is so loath to part with it, that it requires much labor to persuade him to
dispose of what he has in it. This is an infirmity too often found in Gods
children (having what, and on whom to bestow,) to neglect a duty of so good use
and report: Insomuch that Hezekiah when he received a message of death, had not
set his house in ^ra^r Isai. 38.1.
. But, it is a thing studied by the Hypocrite, who will, for fear of death,
rather dye intestate, then to do an act which convinces him of the necessity
of dying. Therefore he leaves the World, without taking leave, because he is
afraid that his taking leave of it, will enforce him to leave it?

A passionate lover abhorres the word a diew, to his love. And he that loves
the world better then God, must needs startle at that Language, I give and
bequ^ath; for, he that dares not trust the earth with his body, will hardly
trust God with his soul, which he too well knows never cared for God. Nay
rather, let the world scramble, and catch that catch may: for, could he but
have carried in it, he would have saved them the trouble of a division.

And, as an ill Tenant pays his rent with an ill will, so this man so much
envies others that are likely to enjoy what he unwillingly parts with all,
that he had rather say with him in the Tragedy, Me mortuo terra misceatur
incendi (when I am dead, let the fire take all) then do as Hezekias was
required, to prevent such confusion. As a swine that is next in election to
make puddings, alone cries, when all about him are merry: So dies the
worldling, who doing no good in his life, was loath to take notice of death,
till those that survive him, enjoy his leavings, with more trouble then profit
in what he leaves to them. So dies the worldling, who did no good in his life,
and is sorry that he must now die to do any good after death; and so, as he
lived undesired, he dies unlamented.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian sets his house in order, as knowing he must
dye.

We speak of him as acted by faith, not as overswayed by passion. When he is
himself, he speaks and does like himself. He can think and talk of his
departure, as freely as he that is taking a journey, of which he hopes to reap
benefit. He can take order for his leaving the world and the things of it, as
being weary of it, and assured of a better reversion He is not so sorrowful to
think what he must leave, as careful to leave it so, that they who servive may
have least sorrow about it.

He is not so much affected to think what he must part with to others, as
joyful to consider what he is going unto. And although for some reasons he may
be willing to live, yet far greater are those that make him contented to die.
He is careful so to order his estate, that the strivings of the living may not
be imputed to the negligence of the dead. He loves, pitieth, and prays for
those, to whom these doubtful, uncertain dangerous things are to be resigned,
but he loves himself better then to desire to live longer, to keep the others
out of possession: and when all men are sorry to think of his departure, he
only is not sorry for himself. Nor does he fear or delay to make his Will,
least that should be speak his change the sooner; but rather hastens the
settling of his worldly estate, that afterward he may have nothing more to do
but to settle the estate of his soul. He that has done the former will be not
only at more leisure, but in a better frame of spirit to set about the other,
that he may always be fit to die, and to prevent sudden death, how suddenly
soever death seize on him. So, while he lives, he will live more usefully, and
when he dies, he will dye more comfortably.

Thus, this Hypocrite had rather adventure the undoing of others that survive
him by not disposing his estate, then to fix so long upon the thoughts of
death, as the making of a Will may occasion; the true Christian is the more
willing to make his Will, that he may prevent quarrellings among those he shall
leave behind him, and more seriously think of his own dissolution; the one is
so loath to part with any piece of his estate, that he is unwilling to appoint
who shall have it, even after himself shall be forced to leave it; the other is
so willing to leave the world, that he cannot be quiet, until he has disposed
of the things of the world, even while he is in it: not as weary of Gods
blessings; but as careful to improve them for the greater benefit of those that
shall after enjoy them.

The worldly Hypocrite has a sad heart even when he sets a good face upon a
forced farewell

He may set his house in order, as A^itophel; make restitution, as Judas; take
a fair leave of the world, as a thief upon the Gallows, and leave to his
heirs what he cannot carry with him, as Nabal; He may give to good uses, as
Ananias and Saphira; but, with bad ends, to expiate former sins, to maintain
his reputation, or to purchase a succession of fame; and after all, he may give
Commandment concerning his bones, his burial, and Sepulcher; not as Joseph in
faith Heb. 11.22.
, but as Shebna Isai. 22.16.
, in pomp.

Thus far, he may set a good face upon the matter; and, because he cannot
choose, make as if he were willing to die. But Oh! that I might live, says he
in secret, and therefore looks wishly and sadly upon every one about him, and
by his countenance speaks, when his tongue cannot, Is there no hope left of my
recovery? no further course to be taken to prolong my days a little longer, if
it were, but to see my children brought up and disposed of, or such or such a
thing done which I long since intended? And then, every one must pray for him,
not so much for a comfortable departure, as for longer continuance here, which
if he may attain, his soul within him says, I can well enough be longer
without heaven. And, when he must part indeed, the world leaves him, not he the
world, which he carries with him in his soul, when he must needs leave his body
behind him.

Contrarily, the true Christian takes his last leave of the world, Differ.
with confidence and desire to be gone.

Confident I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be
present with the Lord 2 Cor. 5.8.
. For, albeit nature be unwilling to a divorce, and conscience sometimes
(especially in case of relapses after repentance) cannot but tremble to think
of the tribunal of Christ, when he is reflecting upon and considering his own
former falls; yet faith overcomes fleshly fear, and makes that fear a means
of better preparation for death, not an hindrance of his resolution to die, or
of saying from his heart, I have a desire to depart, and to be with Christ
Phil. 1.23.
.

He does in order thereunto, the same things outwardly, making restitution,
settling his estate, give to good uses, as the Hypocrite does, but with a better
heart, upon better grounds, and to better purposes: not as one loath to leave
the world, but as glad to be gone out of it, as being assured of a better
estate in stead of the (...), or bitter-sweets of this world mixed with profits
and losses, pleasure and pain, joy and sorrows; and so in obedience to God,
who has appointed all men once to die, and in faith of the resurrection of his
body which he must lay aside, he willingly and readily resignes up his soul
into the hands of him that gave it, as being glad that he has done with the
world, and that there is here no longer stay for him.

Thus this Hypocrite is loath to depart, when he knows he can stay no longer:
the true Christian is as loath to stay, but willing to be gone, so soon as ever
God licenceth his departure; the one would feign put far away the evil day,
like those that are at ease in Zion Amos 6.1. and 3.
, because he cannot hope to be better; the other looks upon it as a good day
that will better his estate, and therefore is glad when it approaches. When
Christ says, I come quickly; the one answers cheerfully, Amen, even so, come
Lord Jesus Rev. 22.20.
, the other sadly speaks in his heart, as those Devils to Christ, What have I
to do with thee, art thou come hither to torment me before the time. Matthew.
8.29.


Thus, having brought the worldling, and the heavenly minded Christian to their
deaths, let us leave them to be further differenced at the great day of Christ.

CHAP. XV. The Religious Hypocrite Is he that professes Religion without being
religious; and godliness, without being godly. Defin.

OTHER Hypocrites, formerly surveyed, do mistake, or suppose some other thing
for Religion; as, the Natural Hypocrite takes nature for grace; the Moral
Hypocrite supposes reason to be Religion; the Civil Hypocrite thinks education
to be Conscience; the State Hypocrite imagines Policy to be Piety; the
Theatrical Hypocrite believes grave gestures to be Godliness; the Heretical
Hypocrite, takes error for Truth; the Schismatical, faction for Zeal; the
Superstitious, delusion for Devotion; the Ignorant, lack of knowledge for
virtue; the Profane, godlessnesse for Simplicity; and the Worldly Hypocrite
takes Mammon for God. But this Hypocrite takes true Religion it self as a cover
for some other thing; and, godliness with limitation, and respect to somewhat
else. He takes Religion in another nature, and by the wrong end, although the
Religion he takes up be right for kind.

All Hypocrites pretend to Religion; else, could they not be Hypocrites in a
religious sense: and, willingly they would all be accounted religious; but, in
several kinds, and upon several accounts. There are, who would have all that
they do to be accounted Religion: of this sort are they before described, and
differenced: others, put on Religion upon all that they do, supposing that
their doing of duties in their own way, is all the Religion they need. These
take not all that they do to be Religion (for, they know the contrary;) but,
they think the prof^ssion of Religion will bear out, or excuse all that they
do; or, at least themselves, in doing thereof: and therefore they take up
Religion to be their advocate as well as a cloak, for the evils they commit.

Now, although it be a task almost insuperable to put a precise difference
between the several sorts of Hypocrites; (as it is, to take an exact survey of
all the monsters in nature, and to set out their several differences;) because
albeit every Hypocrite be a Proteus, or continual Changling, shifting shapes as
often as new objects present themselves; yet, every sort takes part with other;
so as finding them in the same lump, and company, it is hard to distinguish one
from the other: therefore, in descrying and discovering this Hypocrite, we
shall consider him; first, in the general, and in some large circumstances; and
after, descend to the particular kinds and sorts of Hypocrites that march under
his colors, and may be reckoned as under-setters and inmates under him.

This Hypocrite makes a right Profession of that which is Religion indeed: but,
it is but a profession, leaves without fruit; he appears outwardly a gracious
creature, but this is but a cover for a profane heart, and an irreligious life,
where he is not known, or cannot be proved to have done what he is guilty of.
He is as vile as others, but more cunning: and the more vile, the more
religious he would appear to be; as seeking to layon the richest lace upon the
coursest cloth; the better paint upon the worst deformed or wrinkled face.

Of this Hypocrite, or rather, of all of this kind, the Apostle gives this
Character, as that which should complete the perilousnesse of the later times;
that, for a cover of other vices, he is one that has a form of godliness,
and denies the power 2 Timothy 3.5.
. He holds out nothing for godliness, but that which is so indeed, if the
power and life of what he holds out in the form, were added to his profession.
He runs well in regard of the race propounded, and of the truth professed;
but yet there is somewhat that hinders (to wit, his beloved lust within,) that
he does not obey the truth Gal. 5.7.
, which he professes, but persueth somewhat else which his profession
renounceth. He has a form of godliness, that he may not be thought profane,
nor be excluded the society of the godly; but, he has but a form, and
therefore is but a profane wretch, incapable of the true communion of Saints.
We therefore may fitly call him the Religious Hypocrite: Religious, because he
makes a show of Religion: yet, an Hypocrite, because this is but a show,
without the life and power of godliness.

On the contrary, the sincere Christian is as careful to express the power of
godliness, Differ.
as to profess the form.

He is not careless of the form, but careful to enquire after it, and to
embrace, and retain it. But he so holds the faith, that he holds a good
conscience too; as well knowing, that whoever puts away the last, will soon
make shipwreck of the first 1 Timothy 1.19.
. Although he believe not every spirit, yet he embraces every truth, after
trial of the spirits 1 John 4.1.
: and, albeit every form of worship will not down with him; yet he keeps close
to the pattern of Christ 1 Cor. 11.1.
: but this is not all, nor the maine of his care, which is, to obey from the
heart, to the form of Doctrine, to which he is delivered Romans 6.17.
; for the Doctrine of Christ is no sooner delivered to him, but he delivers up
himself unto it, to be molded and assimilated into the nature of it, that
where the Gospel is preached he may be Gospelized, as that which is cast in a
mould bears the figure and print of the mould; and that which is cast into
the fire is converted into the color, heat, and properties of the fire. He
looks upon the Gospel not only as the effigies and true pourtraiture of Christ,
but as his glory also: and so is transformed into the same image from glory to
glory, 2 Cor. 3.18
never giving over the work of transformation, until Christ be perfectly
formed in him Gal. 4.19.
.

Thus, this Hypocrite professing to know God, in works denies him: the true
Christian accounts himself to have no more knowledge of God then his works be
proportionable. The one is as Sardis, whose works are not found full before God
Rev 3.2.
: the other as Caleb that follows God fully Number. 14.24.
. The one, as Cushi, seems to make great haste, but runs over mountains and
boggs of ungodliness, as thinking that the next way; the other, as Ahimaaz,
runs over the plains of true godliness, and so over-runs Cushi, that set out
before him 2 Samuel 18 23.
.

This Hyp^crite puts on Religion as a Masking suit.

He puts on Religion not as liking it for it self, but as needing it for his
carnal ends: and men use to meddle as little as they can with things they like
not; although sometimes they must use them in order to somewhat else, which
cannot be had without them. Therefore, as a Stage Player puts on the name and
habit of a King, for an hour or two, but still retains the heart and quality
of a Rogue: So this man appears in a vizar and robe of Religion, not as his
wearing apparel, but as best suiting with his designs and occasions; not as
being answerable to his practice, but as most conducing to his ends: Not as
fitting his person, but his purpose, for which he put it on: not as serving the
time, for Gods sake; but, the Lord, for the times sake.

Contrarily, the true Christian puts on Religion as his wearing apparel, Differ.
yea as his skin.

He puts on Religion not only to cover his nakedness, but to adorn his
person. He is careful that it should suit, not so much emergent occasions, as
his place, calling, qualities, and relations: yea, that it should be as his
skin (of all other, the most natural clothing) when food digested turns into
clothing by nutrition, and augmentation. For, thus the child of God receives
the Word, to be not only meat and drink, but cloth also unto him. For, by
digesting it inwardly, he feels it without as well as within, and is clothed
without, because nourished within; the skin is fed and nourished by the blood
in the veins; and so both profession, and practice are made correspondent:
when he is made glorious within, he is comely without: nor can he be more
without the glory within, than the raiment of needle work without.

Thus the one puts on Christ, without taking him in; the other first takes
in Christ, and then puts him on: the one, as Tamar, puts it on as a disguise,
to cosen Judah, Genesis 38.14.
the other, as the Kings daughter Psalm. 45.14.
, to become more amiable to her husband.

The Hypocrite makes Religion a by-businesse, and as a lacquee to his ends.

In show, it is his work; in truth, it is but as a recreation; not wherein he
delights; but, whereof he has need: It is beside his ordinary course of
practice, even when he seems most to profess it. If we look upon what his
heart is most set upon, Religion is not his (...), his business; but his
(...), a work upon the by that draws him off from his own business; yet so,
as to promote it too, although he account all time lost (were it not for
necessity) that is not spent upon his lust, so that he takes up Religion,
obiter, as meeting it in his way, or finding a necessity to take it with him in
his way, as his pass and convoy; as he that makes the Church his way to the
Tavern, or Revel.

As sin is in a child of God, (...), a business that he stumbles upon, and is
sorry for: so is Religion to the Hypocrite, as being sorry he cannot be without
it. Religion is his stalking-horse to bring him to his game: but it sets so
hard to his lusts, that could he compass his ends without it, he would never
be troubled with it. Nor will he be troubled with the use of the thing, which
he looks upon as a cumber, although he make use of the name, that it may be an
honor.

It goes against the hair with him to walk in Gods ways, even when he finds it
necessary to look that way. He is for the time out of his own way, while he is
in Gods; and, has lost himself till he be in his old bias again. Yet, as
travelers, for pleasure care not much to go a mile or two out of their own way
for company, especially if the way be fair, and the company pleasing: So this
Hypocrite, if he meet with no distaste or opposition, and can accomplish his
own ends the better, he will be content (if it be but for more safety upon the
way) to take a walk, in that way which is neither his own nor very pleasing to
him. But, if there be no such inducement, or, if beyond that inducement, it is
no way for him, who will rather tarry at home, or part company, to keep on his
own course.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christian makes Religion his constant way, work, and trade.

It is his highway, by keeping whereof he preserves his soul Prove. 16.17
: his right way, not his mistake, his road way for travel, not his walk for
pleasure. If he be out of this way, he is at a loss, and cries unto God, I
have gone astray like a lost sheep; O seek thy servant for I do not forget
(although now I keep not) thy Commandments Psalm. 119.176
. Yea, while he is in it, he still calls out to his guide, lead me in the way
everlasting Psalm. 139 24.
. If he can get good company, and fair weather, it is a great refreshing and
encouragement unto him. If he must go alone, he will go howsomever, as holding
this more needful than life. And as men of business, that are in a journey of
necessity, whether the way and weather be fair or foul, resolve to go
thorough: So the true Christian even when his way is fowlest, and the weather
most tempestuous, he resolves to pass on, by honor and dishonor, by evil
report and good report 2 Cor 6.8.
, until he appear before God in Sion.

And as godliness is his way, so is it his work too, his trade, and calling,
which God has before ordained that he should walk in Ephesians. 2.10.
. It is to him what tillage is to the Husbandman, which plowes all day to sow,
and sowes in hope. Therefore he sows to himself in righteousness, that he
may reap after the measure of mercy Hos. 10.12.
. He so puts his hand to the plough of Christ, as not to look back Luke 6.62.
, as well knowing that if any man draw back, Christ's soul shall have no
pleasure in him Heb. 10.38.
; therefore, he will not be of those who draw back unto perdition, but of those
that believe to the saving of the soul Ver. 30.
. To fear God, and to keep his Commandments, is this man's All Eccles. 12.13
.

Thus, this Hypocrite makes Religion his way no otherwise than Ahaziah did the
way of the garden-house 2 King. 9.27
, wherein he was at length pursued and slain, because he took it for necessity
to escape an enemy; the true Christian makes it as the two kine that drew the
Arc, the highway of his own coast, not turning aside to the right hand, or to
the left 1 Samuel 6.12.
, till he come to Bethshemesh, the house of the Sun, to wit, Christ the Sun
of righteousness, his everlasting light, and glory. The one, in Gods way, does
but wander, to whom meeting him there, we may say as Elisha to the Syrian
horsemen, this is not the way, neither is this the City 2 King. 6.19.
: the other is never in his own way, but where he hears a word behind him,
saying, This is the way, walk in it Isai. 30.21.
. The one, pretending Gods work, does his own; the other, in doing his own,
works the work of God.

This Hypocrite borrows his Religion from others.

He is not religious from an inward principle of grace, but takes it up by
imitation, and has no more of it, but what he is beholding for to good
neighbors. Therefore he can be holy in good company; but, not alone. He cannot
seriously set himself to think of God, much less to serve him, when he is in
secret; nor solace himself in Christ, nor keep his thoughts with any intention
upon heavenly things, without company.

Howbeit, as borrowers make a show for a time in the world, till at length the
borrowed thing must go home; so does this Hypocrite, till at length the Devil
strips him, and shames him, as sometimes he did the sons of Sceva Act. 19.15.
, with, Jesus I know and Paul I know; but who are ye? Such borrowers are not
able to bear a loss, because they are worse then naught: For, although they
can say with the Trapezite, Dives sum si non reddo quae debeo, I am a rich man,
if I pay not my debts, yet if they either pay, or lose any thing, they are
undone, and may well cry, Alas! Master, for it was borrowed. 2 King. 6.5


He has no other zeal but this, that he frequenteth the company of zealous
Christians, Preachers, or Professors. Peradventure he has seen some of the
Martyrs; he has a Levite to his Priest, a good Minister to his Pastor, and he
is sometimes with him; he has a good father, so had Manasseth; or a good
friend, so had Ahitophel; or a good Master, as Gehezi. Of these, he speaks much
in good company, that he may seem to be some body himself, when he means to
fall into his holy day discourse, that by the names that he uses, he may gain
reputation of savouring of the same spirit.

But such words are neither a slander to others, nor commendation for himself,
no more than theirs that built Sepulchers for the Prophets, being dead, yet
persecuted Christ and his servants living; as some now adays cry out against
others for ill dealing with their Minister, yet hate and despise their own.
Thus, as the glass receives images and figures; and the Cameleon colors from
the things that are before it; so all the Religion of this man is but a
reflection from some object or other that is or has been in his eye.

Nay, happly, he may be religious ad oppositum, to hold up a contest with some
other who^ he desires to master, or oppose. But as the Philosopher puts a
difference between pugnaces and fortes, fighters, and valiant men; so must we
in such as stand for Religion; some, upon true courage and judgment, as
knowing and effecting the cause for it self; others, out of a quarrelsome
disposition, desirous rather to thwart and controvert, than to find out the
truth, or to stand for it, being found out; so, some are Protestants, because
the opposite to Popery, some on the contrary turn Papists, because they love
not the Protestant Religion; although why, or wherefore, they cannot well tell.
So have I known some turn Arminians that they may quarrel with those who are
none, not because they care for the cause, but love to be opposite to those who
are in more request than themselves for learning, wit or piety, in hope to give
them the foil, and to wear the Garland themselves, not for clearing the cause,
but for beating their Antagonist out of the field.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian has a root and stock of Religion of his
own.

He is truly touched with the true loadstone Christ, and therefore turn him
which way you will, his heart still points to the North Pole. His resolution
carries him Heavenward, as well alone, as in company: he is the same in the
closet when his door is shut, that he is at Church. Yet he refuses not the
comfort of company, or the office and help of borrowing. But, he does as well
lend, as borrow; give, as receive. The blessed Apostle that had been in the
third Heaven, yet communicates with the believing Romans; and (being the most
glorious Saint alive) becomes a debtor, both to the wise and to the unwise Romans
1.14.
; not only in regard of his office to preach the Gospel unto them, and to
impart unto them some spiritual gift, but also in regard of the benefit of
being comforted together with them by the mutual faith of both Ver. 11.
.

The true Christian, if he borrow comfort, he lends grace; if he borrow zeal,
he lends knowledge; or if he borrow knowledge, he lends zeal: or else, in
the same graces, he helps to make up a larger joint stock. He is able to bear a
loss, and is not out of trade or stock, although some part of his adventure
miscarry. He can never be Banqrupt, for grace remaining, raises him again, and
sets him up anew to go on in his heavenly calling: as David, after that great
Shipwreck upon those desperate rocks of Adultery and Murder. He could not be
utterly undone, because he was out of debt, and had some stock left him to
trade again.

He not only knows good folk, but labors to be like them, that he may not
shame his acquaintance. If he have a good father, he will not bear himself upon
his fathers goodness, but endeavor to uphold it by walking in his fathers
steps. If he have a good Minister, he will be a follower of his faith,
considering the end of his conversation Heb. 13.7.
. Good company may cast a luster upon him, as scarlet cloths do upon a good
complexion; but they make not his color, much less his complexion: he has
that from within himself.

And so far will he be from doing any thing out of strife or vainglory Phil.
2.3.
, that he is a composer of differences, and healer of breaches, lest that which
is lame be turned out of the way Heb. 12.13.
. He will neither cast down the Gauntlet, nor take up the Cudgels against every
opposer, but will rather in meekness instruct those that oppose themselves, to
see if God will at any time give them repentance to the acknowledging of the
truth 2 Timothy 2.25.
. Not that every truth is not precious to him, but that he believes the entering
the lists of contention with every gain-sayer upon every challenge, or
provocation, is none of the best ways, either to find truth, if lost, or to
keep it when it is found: but rather, that more truths are lost in the scuffle
of contention, than found by wrangling oppositions.

Thus, this Hypocrite is all for borrowing, and pays not again, having
nothing of his own; the true Christian is as much for lending, as borrowing,
and where he borrowes, he makes a return with interest, having enough of his
own to do it; The one, with the Pharisee, bears himself out upon his Ancestors
title, We have Abraham to our Father Matthew. 3.9.
; the other walks in the steps of Abraham's faith Romans 4.12.
. The one drives a great trade with other men's stock; the other trades chiefly
with his own estate.

This hypocrite is very precise in things which the world observes; and in the
rest takes liberty.

What duties others observe, and observe him for, he is punctual in the
external exercise of them. If prayer be more cried up than preaching; he will
not miss prayers, but perhaps may borrow leave to go out in the time of
Sermon, if not before it. If preaching be preferred, he will not miss a Sermon,
but slights prayers. And so in the rest. He will be there where he is most
observed, and most conversant in that which is most in fashion.

He does holy duties with others; but not as others, not as the children of
God. In matters of form he is curious, but in matters of substance, careless.
He makes scruple to be absent from Church, because that would be a thing noted,
and he perhaps punished for it, but he makes no conscience at all how he
behaves himself in the Church, whether he hear, or offer the sacrifice of
fools Eccles. 5.1.
; whether he gaze about, or sleep, mourn for sin, or laugh at sin: whether
his heart be upon the Word, Deuteronomy. 32.46.
or going after his covetousness Ezekiel. 33.31.
, for these things men cannot censure him, therefore here he takes liberty.

He puts on that part of religion which is most in esteem and fashion; but
regards it not much whether that become him, or he it, so he wear it when he
goes abroad, as his mantle or loose garment which he may cast off at pleasure
when he comes home. And indeed clothes best fashioned will never become a
misshapen body, nor true Religion so crooked a soul. And how can any thing sit
close about him, who wants the girdle of verity to gird it on? How can it be
supposed that he will not take his liberty where he may, and when he may, that
never cared for more of Religion than may make him to be seen of men? Nor
longer for that than it is in request.

If Religion be in favor, he may sometimes court it, and do somewhat for it,
as Joab for Absalom 2 Samuel 13.39. chap. 14.1, 2.
, till he set his fields on fire: but, if ever Religion be in disgrace, and
under persecution, and happen to be (as Absalom) hanged by the hair, he will
be as ready with his darts to strike through her heart, as ever Joab was to
dispatch Absalom 2 Samuel 18.14.
, let David take it as he will. He never loved Religion, even when he courted
her most, although he served himself of her, while able to do him service:
therefore, when opportunity is offered, he will not fail to make her find and
feel it, as Herod did the Baptist Matthew. 14.9.
, after all his glaverings, Saint-seeming reverence, and piecemeal obedience
to what John preached.

On the Contrary, Differ.
The true Christian has respect to all duties as well as to any.

He is as David, that had respect to all Gods Commandments Psalm. 119.6.
, that he may prevent that shame which is sure to light upon the hypocrite for
doing his duty by halves. He will walk in all the Commandments and Ordinances
of the Lord blameless Luke 1.6.
, as well as bear them respect; as knowing that not the hearers of the Word,
but the doers of the work shall be blessed in his deed. He is respectful of all
outward duties, but most careful of the inner man, and of the inward part of
the duty; of the soul and life of the duty, as well as of the body of it.

He does as others in public duties, but not without a disposition and frame
of heart peculiar to the upright and sincere Christian. He refraines not the
Congregation, because some Ahitophels are permitted to the Ordinances, no more
than Christ excluded Judas from his society at his last supper. He goes with
others to the house of God Psalm. 55.14.
, but this he has of his own, that he is glad to go thither Psalm. 122.1, 2
, and that others are so forward.

He makes conscience of those duties whereof none but God and his own heart
can be witnesses, as well as of those upon which every one has his eye: and of
the manner of doing, as well as of the matter of the duty to be done by him;
especially that it be done in spirit and in truth John 4.24.
, as becomes a true Israelite in whom is no guile John 1.47
.

Thus, the Hypocrite takes up Religion, because it is in fashion; the true
Christian rejoices that it is in fashion; and endeavors to bring it into
fashion where it is not, the one will pick and choose, the other will take in
all, because he has chosen the way of truth: the former minds the fashion more
then religion, the other minds religion more than the fashion.

This Hypocrite performs duties chiefly upon Custom.

Whatever his grounds of his profession were at the beginning, he now has
either forgotten them, or laid them aside, yet holds on his course upon this
ground, chiefly and commonly, because he will do as he has done. He once made
show of conscience to pray at set times in his family; or, privately: now,
being rooted in the love of the world, his affections are cooled, and
conscience corrupted, yet the order remains. Vsu, non sensu gratias agit; he
says grace by use, not out of sense of the mercy as Bernard well. And in the
performance, he has good words, and forms by rote, into which he falls of
course without thinking what he says. It is but the exercise of the fantasy,
not of faith; as some men in their sleep walk in the way which they used waking.

Even Gods children sometimes are guilty of this decay, or abatement (as
Ephesus) of their first love Rev. 2.4.
; but they continue not in it, but recover. Sometimes they pray out of custom,
but it is not their custom so to pray. Happily, once, for love of charity, the
hypocrite sets himself a pitch or course in giving, or in using Hospitality;
thus many he would relieve, thus much he would allow; now, though it goes
against his mind, and comes from him, not cheerfully, but with much grudging,
yet he holds on: he cannot yet so far prevail with his credit, or conscience,
as to break the custom.

He once engaged himself by promise or protestation, not to take or give a
bribe, not ^o make a symoniacal contract, nor to multiply charges and cures of
souls. Now, if that were to do, he would not begin to make such promises: but,
(as Herod in the case of John Baptist head) because he stands engaged, and an
expectation is raised of him, he must do no other. There are not, I confess,
many of these scrupulous Hypocrites, for it were not for the Devils profit:
yet, some there be, with whom he is content to bear, till he can win them to be
worse.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian performs duty out of an abidnig seed of
goodness in him.

He that is born of God, has the seed of God remaining in him 1 John 3.9.
. This not only keeps him off from reigning sin, but is the ground of his duty.
He is careful to maintain a good course, as well as forward to begin it. Yea
more, because Satan is a greater enemy to our standing, than to our entrance,
for he gets much by such mushroomes as are up in a might, and wasted in a
day. If he can once set a worm in the Gourd, he knows how much Jonah will take
on, and talk as malepertly to God John 4.8.
, as the Devil himself could. Such bring an ill name upon Religion, which does
it more prejudice than open profaneness: for this does but neglect God, that
mocks him to his face.

Therefore is the Christian careful to maintain his first grounds, as well as
his first growth; his first love, as well as his first works Rev. 2.5.
. He will not be so foolish, as having begun in the spirit Gal. 3.3.
to end in the flesh. He fears himself more and more in matters of form and
course, where necessity many times steps into the place of virtue and piety. He
rejects not all forms in Divine worship, nor refuses to use the same words
twice, with the same faith that becomes a suitor at the throne of Grace, when
he finds that his Savior did it thrice, Man. 16.44.
but labors to raise and feel new flames of affections in observing of forms;
and between while he enlarges himself (beside and beyond those forms) unto a
further exercise of faith in wrestling with God: for these exercises betoken a
free spirit, though otherwise obedient to public form and order.

Thus, the Hypocrite leads Religion about for show (as wandering cheaters
carry about Monsters) to get money, or praise; or makes use of her picture; to
make others stand at the gaze; the true Christian entertaineth her as his
Mistress, to whom he owes honor and service, and gives her the power and keys
of his heart: to the one, custom is the cause of his goodness; to the other,
goodness is the ground of custom and constancy.

CHAP. XVI. The Stinted Hypocrite Is he that would be thought good, Defin.
but sets a stint to his goodness.
HE thinks he may do by godliness, as God by the days of man, to whom he has
appointed his bounds which he cannot pass Job 14.5.
; or, as with the waters, which he has compassed with limits Job 26.10.
; yea, as with the proud waves of the Sea, setting bars and doors unto it,
and saying, hitherto shall thou come, but no further Job 38.10, 11.
. This hypocrite will be godly, but will not suffer godliness to be his
Master; he will give Laws to godliness, for the extent of it, as resolving no
inmate shall be a Law unto him, to carry him further then he thinks fit.

Our Savior describes this Hypocrite by the similitude of a bad Husbandman,
that puts his hand to the plough, and after looks back Luke 9.62.
: he soon thinks he has done enough; and, if he draw not back his hand
quickly, he may do to much. Therefore, he sets himself a pitch, beyond which he
will not go. His looking back so soon, shows he has no mind to go forwards;
but rather, repents that he has gone so far.

In three kinds of examples three sorts of Stinted professors are noted in the
Gospel Luke 9.
. One, that would follow Christ whethersoever he should go; but repented, as
being discouraged at the coarse fare and hard lodging (short of the provision
of Foxes and Birds of the air ver. 58.
), which he was likely to find in following of Christ. Another, would come;
but, not till he had buried his father ver. 59.
: being loath to hazard his patrimony or legacy, by going sooner. A third would
follow, but must at least take a solemn farewell of those which were at home
at his house ver. 61.
. To him, and to the rest Christ gives but one Answer, which in effect was,
that in his service there is no place for such deliberation, delay, or
tergiversation. He that lays hold on this Plough, must never let it go, nor so
much as look behind him. For, where thou lookst back, thou art in danger (says
Saint Augustine De verb. Apli. Sermon. 15.
) to stand for a mark, as Lots wife, that had a like mind to return.

Elisha, when Elijah had cast his Mantle upon him, desired leave to kiss his
Father and Mother 1 King. 19.20
, that he might follow the Prophet without let or blame, which he obtained, and
accordingly did so. But, the hypocrite alleges these things, animo cunctandi,
with a desire to linger, that he may shift off the service with reputation. The
service of Christ is a spiritual tillage, both in regard of our general
calling, wherein every man must plow his own ground Jer. 4.3.
; and, of our special, wherein every man must lend aid (in his own sphere) to
the husbanding of his neighbors heart 1 These. 5.11.
. But, above all, the Minister is engaged hereunto, who therefore must
disengage himself of the affairs of this life 2 Timothy 2.4
, and turn his Oxen into Books, and his Plough into Parchments 2 Timothy 4.13.
.

Every Professor putting an hand to this Plough, enters Covenant with Christ,
to be not only of his retinue, but his household servant; not, to choose his own
work or to set a stint to his labors; but to put his hand to whatever his
Master requires; and, to work all day, till the night comes, in which there
can be no working. But, the Hypocrite like a loytering and unfaithful hind,
looks over his shoulder, as afraid to over-work himself, or to bring in too
much gain to his Master: and therefore sits down and thinks, what a days work
have I done! It is time to unyoke, lest I over-do. Even when he enters into
Gods service, he casts beforehand, what, and how much service he will do, and
where he will make a stop; as a coward that thinks of the retreat, before he
give the onset.

Differ.
Contrarily, the child of God still looks, and goes forward.

He stands not still in the middle of the field, but drives up to the
head-land, or head-ridge with all his heart and might. He remembers Lots wife
Luke 17.32.
, and therefore will lose any thing, rather than return back to recover it. He
knows that his Masters business brooketh no omission, remission, or
intermission: and that he can never do too much, nor enough, whereby he may
boast of his profitablenesse Verse 10.
. Whoever could look back on a greater days work, than blessed Saint Paul 1
Cor. 15.10.
? Yet even he forgets that which is behind, as if he had done nothing; and
endeavors himself still to that which is before, as that which must also be
done; pressing as hard toward the mark Phil 3.13, 14
, as if he had but newly set forth, and not made scarce one step in the way
unto it.

The Christian, in this life, goes on unto perfection Heb. 6.1.
: but, he is always traveling, never at the end of his journey, because in
this world never perfect. His perfection here, is Viatoris, non Possessoris, a
fitness for his travel, not an end of his way; fit for the earth, while he is
in his pilgrimage, not for heaven, where he comes to his inheritance. He
therefore thinks what is yet to do, and will up and be doing, while daylight
continues. And no marvel; for, his Master is engaged in the same condition; I
must work, says our Savior, while it is day John 9.4.
, shall the servant then, give over before the night comes, wherein no man can
work? Only the night of death discharges Gods laborers.

We use to say of ways longer then the common estimate, He that sits down at
the miles end, shall never come there: So, he that takes the way to heaven upon
the common account of flesh and blood ( viz. upon hope well, and have well; do
as others do, etc.) and sits down where the world sets up her rest, or appoints
him his, shall never come to the end of his hope, unless of that which shall
perish Job 8.13.
, and be as the giving up of the ghost.

Thus, this hypocrite quickly writes nil ultra, stop Here; how little soever of
the race he has run, as loath to go any further; the true Christians word is,
Plus ultra, On, On, how great a progress soever he has made, as resolving to
hold on his way: The one is as Rachel, making a blind excuse for not rising up
before her father Genesis 31.34, 35.
, when the true cause was another thing, which she was more loath to be known
of; the other is, as the kind neighbor Mat. 5.41.
, that if Christ require him to go a mile, he will go with him twain.

This Hypocrite contenteth himself to be none of the best, nor none of the
worst.

He likes not to travel with company too high metled for his more resty temper,
lest he be tired: Yet, if an ordinary pace will be accepted, he is content to
make one in the journey. He that cares not to be good, when he is all alone,
yet is not willing in the exercise of godliness to be yoked with any company
that are too fleet for him to run with all, and will not let him go at his own
rate. As in ringing, men that love their ease as well as the sport, will take
the stint Bell, because then they can lead, rise, and fall as they list, and
give over when they please; So this Hypocrite is all for leading, till he think
fit to give over, provided others will give him leave to keep to his own pace,
and not force him beyond it.

But, no greater trial of virtue, than in competition; not who shall soonest
take up, but who shall excel in going furthest. He that knows the goodness of
a blade will bend it to the hilts; but he that doubts of the mettle, thinks he
has done very much to bend it half way. He that takes up a race after
goodness, and immediately lets fall the persuit, Saying, such and such had
need to be better than I, yet have scarce gone so far, is of a base and
ignoble spirit; far unlike that of Nehemiah Nehem. 6.11
, who would by no persuasion give over working till the work was finished, nor
so much as go into the Temple to save his life. He that satisfied himself that
he has done more then many others, and that there are some worse, is in danger
to be as bad as any; the Devil himself, perhaps, not excepted.

This hypocrite when he sees others go beyond him, in stead of emulating, he
envieth at them; and, in stead of treading on their heels, carpeth at their
steps. If you point him to a Saul, that after he became a Paul, made more
haste; he bids you look on a Gamaliel Acts 5.34.
, even Paul's Tutor, a wise man, yet not half so swift. If you show him any that
have out stripped him, he bids you to look back to Zaccheus, Mary Magdalen, and
other Publicans and harlots, that were far behind him. And yet, even in
these, he is deceived, because he looks only on the shadow of their sinful
courses coming behind him, but observes not how by repentance they have in the
body and substance of grace gotten far before him. There is no man worse then
he that thinks himself good enough, because he is not the worst.

But, says he, see you not that many dear Saints of God have done as ill; yea,
worse then ever did I? Noah was drunken: Lot added incest to drunkenness;
David fell into murder and adultery; Peter into apostasy, etc. Why then find
you such great fault with me who was never so bad? You dare not deny them to be
godly, or, to be now in heaven; Why then must I be thought not godly enough,
because some of the godly be better, while many of them be worse? Thus, he
abuses unto presumption, what is recorded for caution; and, of warnings to
avoid sin, he makes warrants to commit it; In stead of striving to be like
them in grace and repentance, he pleases himself that they were like him, nay,
worse then he in sinning.

But even here also he puts another cheat upon himself; for, never any of them
sinned in so high a nature, as to ground a liberty to themselves upon other
men's infirmities; or to gather a toleration from that which God intended for
admonition, that he that thinks he stands, might take the more heed least
he fall 1 Cor. 10, 12
. He that propounds for his imitation the worst of those that are good, will
never reach his pattern in the good they performed, but will surely outstrip
them in the evils they committed.

Contrariwise, the true Christian aims at the best examples, Differ.
and to out-go them if he can.

He remembers the exhortation that speaks to him and all Christians, as unto
children. Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, if any praise, to
think on these things Phil. 4.8.
: that is, so to think of them as to do them. Not after the rate of ordinary
Christians and the lowest patterns; but, to strive to come up to the highest
examples. Not a believer in all Philippi, but he must propound Paul himself for
his Copy to write after, and to come as near him as he can. Those very things
(in the exercise of godliness and practice of piety) which he has both
learned, and received, and heard, and seen in Paul, he must, and will do verse
9.
.

He propounds to himself, not the slowest, to excuse and justify his
backwardness; but the best, to provoke and whet his diligence; as knowing
that, as iron sharpeneth iron, so does a man sharpen and quicken the
countenance of his friend Prove. 27.17.
. He is most gladly compassed about with a cloud of witnesses, as being a great
quickening to him to lay aside every weight, and the sin that so easily besets
him, that he may make the better speed in running with patience the race that
is set before him Heb. 12.1.
. Yea, and if those high examples of all those glorious worthies mentioned in
that little Book of Marters and Confessors Heb. 11.
foregoing, be too low to heighten him to his desire, he will propound to
himself an higher example then all the former, even Jesus himself, the author
and finisher of his faith Heb. 12.2.
.

It is the surest evidence of Christian ingenuity (...). in all good things to
labor to be best (as it is the best sign of true humility, when a man is at
the best, to think meanly of him self, that he may yet strive to be better:)
and to incorporate (...) into every branch of his calling and practice, that he
may be found, if not in name, yet in deed, an Aristarchus, an Aristobulus, an
Aristogeiton, the best Governor, the best Councellor, the best neighbor; and,
so in the rest.

They that shoot, aim at the very pin, although they seldom or never hit it.
But if they should take their aim at the least distance from it, they would be
sure to be much farther off. He that strives to have his name among the thirty
of David's Worthies, must labor to be one of the first three, or else he may be
excluded the Catalogue of the thirty 2 Samuel 23.
. Hence, in Scripture are propounded to us the examples, not only of wicked
Heathens which we must avoid; and of Pharisees, and Publicans whom we must
exceed; but, of the most holy and perfect Saints, to whom we must endeavor to
come up as close as we can; yea, the Lord not only sets before his people
his most accomplished servants, and his elect Angels that did not err; but,
our blessed Savior himself, and God our father who cannot err, that no
servant of his may set down to himself any scantling in holiness.

Thus, this Hypocrite, unwilling to keep pace with the best, serves them as
Jacob, (out of fear) did Esau; praying Esau to go before, with promise to
follow fair and softly, Genesis 33.14.
but never meant it; the true Christian is as John, who in running to Christ's
Sepulcher, out-ran Peter John 10.4.
; the one thinks himself good enough, if he be any thing; the other accounts
himself nothing, if he strive not to keep up with the best, or at least to
follow them in view, when he cannot hold company with them.

This Hypocrite is a great applauder of the golden mean.

Mediocrity carries a good name among men, because it has a shadow and
semblance of virtue, if not mistaken. Herewith this Hypocrite (who is apt to
mistake all things) deceives others, and most of all himself. For mark what he
means by his golden mean: not a mean between two evils in the extremes, (as
between excess and defects in the same quality, which is the only good and
virtuous mean;) but, either a mean between evil and evil in the degrees only;
as Lukewarm in zeal, somewhat covetous, partly proud, meetly profane: Or,
between good and good; as half good, almost a Christian: or, between good and
evil; as, indifferent, neither good nor bad, neither Protestant, nor Papist. So
that the hypocrites mean, is, not to be over good, nor extremely bad.

Somewhat he would feign do, that he may not be accounted profane; but, not
very much, lest he be thought too precise. He commends the mean, but never knew
what it meant. If he can do something for God that crosses not his lusts, this
is his mean; if God require more, that is too much. His lusts command him, they
therefore must be the rule of his mediocrity, although the Word shall have the
name of giving that rule and name to his practice; when yet none of the kindred
of godliness was ever called by that name.

When the Scripture warns men not to be over just, or over wise Eccles 7.16.
, he thinks it speaks for him: not considering, that the Holy Ghost, to speak
to our understandings, is feign to borrow our words; and, to call things, as we
(although sometimes perversely,) style them. But, the true meaning of God, is
this: that, whereas we account summum jus, justice in extremity; (which admits
of no qualification, or regard to equity, or charity,) to be in justice, the
Lord forbids this excess of justice; and, because men count him to be over
wise, who presumes to be wiser than all men, or than himself indeed is; and, to
know more than all; when perhaps, he knows nothing as he ought to know; the
Lord condemns this proud conceit, under the name of over much wisdom:
whereas, of true justice and wisdom there can never be too much.

But, this hypocrite would have goodness in so remiss a degree, that his evil
might not be driven wholly out of doors. He would have Sarah and Hagar, Isaac
and Ishmael, Christ and Belial (things in compatible) both house together; a
little religion for Sundays, and some sin for week days, need not (as he
thinks) to part company. He would profess grace, and expect glory, yet have a
little liberty for some sin, which he hopes will do no great harm for him to
live in, and it to live in him. An Hypocrisy which is to Christ, as
Lukewarme-water that procures vomit Rev. 3.16.
, for want of some exuberant quality to affect the stomach, and to put it upon
some other work.

Contrarily, The true Christian expatiateth in the true holy Mean. Differ.


He is for a mean, not between evil and good, so as to participate somewhat of
either, as Agrippa Act. 26.28, 29.
: nor, between the least good, and the highest pitch of goodness, so as to
stand still in the way to perfection Phil. 3.12.
; but, he is for the mean between evil and evil in opposite extremes. He is for
the true fear of God, as the mean between profaneness and superstition: For
zeal, between looseness, and Lukewarmnesse; between indifferency and schism
of admitting all dogs to holy things, and sohisme for not refusing all but
whom some please.

This mean has a long latitude: yet, that saying Ne quid nimis (beware of any
thing too much) has here no place. No danger of excess in virtue, unless by
wresting the name against the nature, it be forced to degenerate into vice. No
man can be too Righteous, too Wise, too Holy, too Faithful. Nay, in every thing
truly good, there ought to be (as our Savior calls it) (...) Mat. 5.47.
, a kind of redundancy beyond the common standard, as well as practice; which
happily, the world counts singularity, if not madness; and preferres the
Hypocrites mean (who is no medler, nor eyesore by his over-forwardnesse) to
this over-doing, as the world accounts it.

But, the judgment of the world in the things of God is not to be regarded, nor
will be taken for the true Christians bounds in duty. Unto the right
constitution of a Christian, which is sanctification, belongs an holy excess
Ephesians. 5.18
, (although not of wine, which he abhors; but, of the spirit, wherein his
soul delights) whereby he is carried above the sphere, of not only the actions
and apprehensions, but he rules also of carnal men.

Thus, this hypocrite is as one that would needs sail in sight of both Poles
(which is impossible) but approaches neither; the true Christian makes Christ
his Cynosure and Steeres-man, and so goes elevating more and more the Pole of
goodness, and saileth further and further from that of evil: the one would
keep a mean that may hold him in from being too bad; the other is for the mean,
that will make him more good.

This Hypocrite is as good and religious as he means to be.

He is already come, in his own opinion, (which with him is more prevalent than
Gods express will to the contrary) to his Acme and Aux, to his full growth and
perfection; to his Zenith, and Meridian, to his full height, and noone-tide of
goodness. God keep me, as I am; (says he) and grant I be no worse, and then
no fear. He is not now to learn his duty, nor to begin to serve God. If others
go further, he looks on it as their folly, and pride. For his part, he has set
up his rest, and (he hopes) not without good warrant. He has said to Religion,
as God to the Sea, hitherto shall thou come, and no further; and, to prevent an
inundation of Religion, and a deluge of conscience, he sets bounds and bars,
viz.

He will hear but once a Sabbath; or, if twice, yet not repeat, or meditate:
or, whatsoever he does on the Sabbath, he will be sure to do nothing on the
weekday. At the public prayers none more zealous, devout and reverent; at a
Sermon none more remiss, careless and irreverent. He will have prayers once a
day in the family, and that going to bed, because he may die before he get up
again, but, he has haste of work in the morning. Or, say he come twice to
family duty, that must excuse him for the closet. He will not exceed that upon
any occasion. You shall not take him with that over-doing of praying three
times a day, as Daniel Dan. 6.10.
; much less seven times, as David Psalm. 119.164
. Nor will he rise at midnight to praise God, nor prevent the night-watches to
meditate on the Word ver. 148.
. And, whatever others do, he thanks God he has learnt more wit; and never a
Puritan of them all shall make him do more; and, if you will not take his bare
saying so, he can bind it with an oath. When he prays, he tieth himself to
time, form, and measure. It is down upon account how much God shall have of
him. He holds him to an allowance; never, more; many times, less. He cuts out
the Lord hard penny-worths of service. Sure there is more hope of a Publican,
than of such a Pharisee. Not that all forms are in all persons, always to be
blamed: but, that to tie devotion on all occasions, to a form or pittance, is
the killing of affection the life and soul of Religion.

He that is as good as he means to be, will never be so good as he should be.
He that ties himself to an Ordinary, which he will in no case exceed, even his
Ordinary is of hypocrisy; and, in cases extraordinary, he must needs be as far
to seek, as the Virgins that had their Oil to buy, when they were to use it
M^t. 25.10.
. No grace is true, which makes a man think it to be enough. It is not out of
the perfection of due stature that men are past growing in grace; but, of ill
constitution, yea, out of want of a principal of spiritual life. Such
starvlings shame the Lords Housekeeping in these days of plenty of good
provision. Many in times of famine (in comparison) have been more fat and in
better liking; But these, coming up; as Pharaohs lean Kine, and starved ears,
having eaten up the former and fatter, and yet continue lean and ill favored.

He has no true talent that improves it not: and grace cannot be kept at a
stay, but will die, if it be not strengthened Rev. 3.2.
. As the bodily habit, so that of the soul, is always either growing, or
pining, by reason of the mixture of contrary principles. No grace is sound that
grows not: no measure of grace sufficient that is not still increasing. Is si
dixeris sufficit, defecisti. This hypocrite saying, he has enough, has
forfeited all, and himself lost.

Differ.
On the contrary, the child of God never thinks himself so good, but he still
strives to be better.

He is never so good as he would be, or as he endeavors to be. On all
occasions he renews his repentance, and his vow of new obedience. His sorrow
is that he is not such as he should be: but he somewhat comforts himself with
this, that he is so far from being contented with being as he is, as he is
from being what he ought. Therefore he reinforceth his care, winds up the
strings of his heart that are apt to slacken and to put all out of tune, and
doubles his diligence to be and do better.

He knows that what is but ordinary will quickly fail, if it be not now and
then helped with extraordinary; as wines that feed upon themselves, if there be
nothing else to feed them. Be awake, or watchful (says our Savior) and
strengthen the things which remain, and are ready to die. Therefore the
Christian often looks back to his principles, and to the vow of Baptism;
and, wherein he finds himself impaired, he mourns, and hastneth to recover:
wherein he thrives and grows, he is more careful to manure and dress his
heart better, that it may yet grow more. For, he considers that where God has
planted and sowed, he looks for not only fruit, but much fruit; John. 15.8.
and, where he sees some, he calls for more; and, that God would have all to
be on the amending thriving hand; the evil, that they may be good; the good,
that they may be better. And where God is pleased to bless, he causes the
Christian, as Isaac in Gerar Genesis 26.13. Is probus est quem non poenitet quam
probus sit.
, still to go forward and grow, until he become very great.

Therefore the Christian, how good soever he be, never repeats it, never
rests in it; nor looks upon his goodness as being enough; but, to find out
his wants of more. He is a Christian in good earnest, that goes so far from
evil, till he be past knowledge, or thought of returning. He is always
displeased with what he is, that he may be the more quickened to aspire to what
he wants. He is ever waking, ever walking, afraid to stand still, for fear
of taking cold; holding on his way, and growing stronger and stronger Job 17 9.
; least he should turn out of the way like a wandering sheep; or, halt in the
way, as a lame traveller; or, stick in it, as Lots wife, that never reached
Zoar.

Thus this Hypocrite is like the good fellow in a journey, that finding good
fare and liquor in an Inn, takes up his rest there, and never goes further;
the Christian is a true traveller that goes still on, from strength to
strength, till he arive at Zion: the one is as Zacheus that (being little of
stature, yet, at his full growth) climbed a tree to see Christ Luke 19.3, 4.
, but was as tall the first hour he came unto him, as ever after: the other as
the Baptist in his childhood, who continually grew and waxed strong in Spirit,
till the day of his showing to Israel Luke 1.80.
. The one is as grass upon the house top, that withers as it stands; or, as
corn, blasted before it be grown up Isai. 37.27.
; the other is an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains,
the fruit whereof shall shake like Lebanon Psalm. 72.16.
. The one, is arbor infelix, a blighted tree, at a stand, and looks for the
Axe; the other, is as a tree planted by the river, ever green, ever growing:
Holy still, because holy more.

This Hypocrite stints himself in good, that he may take more liberty in evil.

There, he puts on the bridle; here, he claps to the spur. Indeed every one
that stints grace, gives the reigns to his lust, and liberty to sin; and
therefore sets bounds to goodness, that corruption may have the more scope. He
commits Zeal to prison, for a very small offense; nay, perhaps, for doing
but her duty, and make Lukewarmnesse her keeper, which he knows to be her
mortal enemy. But, as rank fences take up too much of the ground which would
yield better fruit; so profane limitation and restriction laid upon himself in
good things, take up, and eats out the heart of the field of goodness: for,
from such hedges, the briars of vice spread over the whole enclosure.

His pittance of Religion will never do him good, while he stints himself to
that pittance. It is with him in this, as with other men in other things. We
see such as have but a little skill in physic, to be for the most part ill at
ease; a smattering in Law, and ever wrangling, three letres in learning and
ever cavelling; a little conscience, and ever stretching it; a little
knowledge, and ever wavering; so, a little goodness, and ever sinning.
Religion stinted, is as the Sunne-beames in March; pleasing, because the days
be longer; yet hurtful, because they stir humors, which they are not able to
resolve, and so, occasion diseases, which may prove the death of the party.

On the contrary. The true Christian sets bounds upon evil, Differ.
that he may be unbounded in good.

Not that he would not utterly root out all the Philistines in Canaan, if he
could: but when he cannot do that, he pens them in as narrow a corner as he is
able, although some Amalekites remain, he has yet war with Amaleck to all
generations, and kills as many of them as he is able, not sparing so much as
Agag their King: but till he can do this, he will be sure to coop them up in as
small a room as is possible, and to make the borders and rampires strong to
prevent invasion, that he may more quietly follow his own business and
occasions. What lusts he cannot put to the sword, he will cast into prison, and
lay on them the strongest fetters he has, or can procure; and if they be
unruly, they shall feel his fingers, and his cudgel to 1 Cor. 9.27.
. He will master them, if he cannot destroy them; he will keep them in the
dungeon, till he bring them out to execution. He will not allow them (as the
Hypocrite does) the liberty of the prison; but puts bolts and fetters on hands
and feet, and loads them with irons all the time they lie there.

As men that recover Land from the Sea, get every day as much as they can
maintain, and so go on still getting, making good fence against over-flowings
of the water. So the Christian recovers daily some ground, although not all at
once, from the dead Sea of sin that is in his corrupt nature. And so,
although he that curbeth goodness can never be good, yet he that gets and
grows upon his corruptions, setting narrower and stronger bonds upon them,
cannot but be good, and will be excellent. His bounds that he sets upon evil,
is not to keep it in, but to keep it out.

As the tree, by pruning is made less rank, and more fruitful; so a Christian,
by mortification. He is like the Olive, the Fig Tree, the Vine in Jothams
parable, which would not leave their fruitfulness to rule over the trees
Judges 9.
; he will not leave his goodness for all the power, pleasure, honor, wealth
in the world, or to be sole monarch of the world. He rejects all that might
set bars to his goodness, or block up his grace.

He had rather the Lord should prune him, and lay bare his root by seasonable
chastisements, than that any wilde-shootes should starve or diminish in him the
fruits of holiness. He transferreth to heavenly things the excess of earthly
affections. There, he will love, even insanato animo, as one (seeming to others
who know not how to judge aright) to be beside himself 2 Cor. 5.13.
; and, it becomes him well, toward Christ. There, he will be as ambitious as
Haman, the sons of Zebedee, or Dictrephes; but, for spiritual favor, and
preferment. There, he will be as covetous as Nabal to gather and hoard up; and
will lay out nothing but for advantage, that he may be sure to find it in
heaven.

Thus, this Hypocrite in goodness, is as one that wadeth; fearful to step
forward, lest he should go past his depth; but the Christian is as he that
swimmeth, or saileth; the deeper, the better, and less fear of splitting, or
drowning; the one in evil, launceth into the maine, as accounting himself in
best case when he has most sea-room; the other dares not venture into the
deep, but scrambles along by the banks till he can get to land. The one
checketh goodness, that he may have his full careir in sin, the other
curbeth sin, that he may have a more full course in goodness

This Hypocrite, in evil, does but stint himself.

He must have some liberty. He will sin; but, within compass. He will rob
the Lord, but cast him somewhat back again, as thieves to a traveller. If he do
borrow of God, as highway men use, judgment, mercy, and faith; he will be so
kind as to leave him tithes; not, of corn (that were too much) but of mint,
annis, and cummin Mat. 23.23.
: and he must account himself well dealt with too, that he allows him the
lesser, when he sweeps away the greater; and, pays him mint, when he cannot
spare him faith.

He imagines he can pitch some bounds in evil, beyond which he will not pass:
and upon that account, adventures on the evil: but, before he is aware, he
exceeds his limits, and his intentions, and leaps deeper into the mire of sin
than ever he meant; as Judah that intending no more but to give way to his lust
to commit simple fornication, fell over head and ears into incest with his own
daughter-in-Law Genesis 38.18.
. Satan is too cunning for him; as Tamar, he disguiseth not only himself, but
the sin: and so while the Hypocrite flatters himself in his own eyes, that he
will go no further in sin, than at first he propounds to himself, nor meddle
with any sin, but such as at present seems to him to be no great matter; he
suffers himself to be so long, and so far hoodwinkt by this flattery, that his
iniquity is found to be hateful; not only as all sin is, to the godly; but, as
the grossest sins are to the moral and civil men of the world. His sin has
cousened him, not only in the degrees of sinning beyond what he propounded; but
in the very kind, and circumstances, which he never dreamed of.

He sometimes seems to draw blood of sin, when it grows too rank for a man of
his rank and profession: but, as a Surgeon not as an executioner: he stops
the vain, before there be any danger of life to the sin. Thus, under the
color of forbearing grosser sins he intireth himself to other sins without
feeling or startling; as men by degrees frame themselves to an ill air, till
it become so natural, that it now fits their constitution better than a purer,
which would sooner make them sick, than the worst: or, as some so long
accustom themselves to physic, yea to poison, that it no longer works upon
them, nor can they be well without it.

Differ.
Contrarily, The True Christian desires to be totally rid of all evil.

He would not willingly give the water any passage, no not a little. Sin is the
Serpents spawn, and very like the parent, the serpent has a subtle head, but
very little. If therefore sin by subtilty but once thrust in her little head,
it is scarce all the Christians skill that can keep out her whole body: which
the Christian knowing, will kill that at first sight of sin, which he could not
crush in the egg of his lust within him: he will shake off this viper so soon
as ever it catches hold of his hand, lest otherwise he soon beomea dead man if
it once get into his heart.

Evil is a weed that he would fain root up, that it might not at all grow in
the meanest plat of his garden; no not in the basest part of his basest court.
In the mean time he keeps it down as much as he can, and spits up as much of
the root as he is able, that it may never seed, or flower. He is of opinion
that he that has a mind to taste a little of madness and folly, as Solomon
did Eccles 1.17
, cannot point how far and no further, he will be foolish or frantic.
Therefore he sets not terms to folly, within which, if it keep, he will be
content; but sets himself wholly to exterminate it; His stinting, is his
endeavor to destroy it, not to cherish or permit it to such a degree.

Neither sin nor grace can endure to be stinted; the one must be killed out
right, or it will soon grow exorbitant; the other if stinted, is killed;
therefore in the work of mortification, he spares not the throat or heart blood
of any lust, that he can come at, nor will it suffice him to nail it to the
Cross, unless he also bury it with Christ, and be sure it be left there, with
his grave-cloaths, without hope of a Resurrection.

Thus this Hypocrite by stinting sin that it may be little, makes it much, as
by stinting grace, of little, he makes it none; the true Christian by
mortifying sin in stead of stinting, of great, makes sin little, till it cease
to be; the one treats with sin as borderers about their confines; the other
makes war upon sin in good earnest, even within her own borders. The one
plays the Surgeon with sin to open a vein, to give it a breathing, by which
it becomes stronger; the other, as the Priest, does kill and slay it, letting
out the very life with the blood, if he once come so near as to lay his hand
upon the head of that unruly heifer.

This Hypocrite makes one Virtue a Protection and Convoy for many vices.

He is not altogether naked of some Virtue, Moral at least; but, as the bed of
his virtue is shorter, than that he or any man else can stretch himself out at
length upon it, it is so very short, and narrow; so this covering of the
Hypocrite is narrower then that he can wrap himself in it Isai. 28.10.
. He has but one poor small threadbare virtue to cover a multitude of vices;
when stretched to the utmost, it will not do his work. But, however he is
resolved to try it, as being the best cover for that which he has no mind to
leave, nor must suffer to go altogether naked.

The Pharisees of old tithed mint, and withheld faith: now the case is altered.
This Hypocrite, if you will believe him has faith good store, and God shall
have as much of it (fruits excepted) as he will: always provided that this be
accepted in stead not only of mint and cummin, but of those other parcels of
righteousness and mercy. No more tithes then needs must; no more
righteousness or mercy than may be expected from a Turk, or a Jew. Any one
virtue will bear up like a bird with one wing. He never sued any man at the
Law, never took the forfeiture of a bond, nor above so much in the hundred as
the Law allows; this must bear out all his avarice and unmercifulness. For,
the tender mercyes of the wicked are cruel Prove. 12.20.
: Much more his justice: therefore he must have some coarse sugar or other to
sweeten those sower crabs.

If he give you what he undertakes to sell you, no matter how much he
overreach you in bargaining, although God be the avenger of all such 1 These.
4.6
. If he furnish you with money or wares (which you must sell off at a far less
rate, perhaps to himself) to supply your need, no notice must be taken what
advantage he makes of your necessities. If he pay present debts and duties
demanded, it is but a scrupulosity to make restitution of old wrongs, which
none will dare to challenge him for.

But, justice in one business will not always bear out oppression in another,
courtesy in words or complements cannot excuse the secret envy and malice of
the heart. I love no swearing, lying, or theeving says this man; but, drink,
play, and game as much as you will. If you can let go your money quietly,
without choler like a fair gamester, no matter what wrong you do to your wife
and children. If he make conscience of private duties, he despenseth with
himself for public. Let Michael and the Dragon fight, he will be a looker on,
and strike in with the Conqueror. He is none of Christ's Angels, nor will be
enrolled (if it be like to come to a pitched battle and hot service) to help the
Lord against the mighty. He wishes well to the cause, but loves to sleep in a
whole skin. He commends Christ's title to be the better, and that he hopes may
serve in stead of further engaging. He thinks it better policy to keep both
factions on foot, than to be necessitated to come up fully to either. He will
be as good as you list in any particular, so that may be accepted as a full
recompense and warrant for all the evil that he has a mind to commit:
provided that his goodness be weighed in his balance; and, the evils he
commits, be not imputed.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian embraces all virtues as an antidote
against every vice.

He knows that all virtues are linked together in one chain; and this chain
to be too strong for all vices in their strongest combination. Therefore he
will add to his faith, virtue; to his virtue, knowledge, etc. 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7
not omitting one link, or leaving out one virtue, as knowing that the leaving
out of one is the breaking of all; and that, if this chain be broken, vice
will be too hard for him, when he thinks himself best armed against it. One
vice entertained dissolves the whole fabric and chain of graces; as one grace
neglected makes every vice too hard for the rest. Neither virtue nor vice
consists all of one link; and, albeit vices, cut and mangled never so much,
make work enough for grace; yet graces severed, are over-matcht by vice. There
is a circle and concatenation of graces, and a conspiracy of vices; so that he
that will have any grace must have all, or none: but he that will have any
vice, shall be sure to have all, although he begin but with one.

No one virtue makes a virtuous man, no more than all can save him: yet one
vice alone, allowed, will destroy him; as, the least aberration in letting slip
the arrow makes a wide error at the mark Benefacta benefactis pertegito, etc.
Virtues must be laid like tiles, one over-lapping another, to keep out all rain
of corruption. Thus Zacheus went the right way to work, when he over-lapt
justice with so much mercy; and alms with so large restitution. For, well he
considers that all things necessary must not only be in him, but abound; or,
he shall be idle and unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ Verse 8.
. It was the praise of the Corinthians, that they came not behind many in grace
1 Cor. 1.5.
, but were enriched in every thing to all bountifulness 2 Cor. 9.11.
: and, it will be the Christians aim, not to live upon other men's stocks, or
at other men's Tables, but to wait upon God who is able to make all grace to
abound toward him, that he always having all sufficiency in all things, may
abound to every good work, in the mortifying of all deeds of the body of sin by
the spirit of grace.

Thus, this Hypocrite concludes himself a Christian, because he has some one
virtue to grace him, the true Christian concludes himself a nobody, a nothing
in grace, till whole Christ be formed in him; the one thinks any thing enough,
to cover his sin: the true Christian thinks all things to be nothing, while he
has any sin to cover: the one is as Nebuchadnezzars Image, whose head was of
Gold, and the rest baser mettle; the other is as the Kings daughter, all of a
piece, and mettle; all glorious, but most of all within

This Hypocrite acknowledges sin only in the general.

As all other duties, so his humiliation is stinted; and overly wrapped up in
this common packet, peccavimus cum patribus, we have sinned with our Fathers:
which he takes to be enough to quit himself of any charge brought against him,
whether by conscience or God himself. He slubbereth over his confession in
general terms, loath to come to particulars either of the sins committed, and
to say with David, Deliver me from blood-guiltinesse, O God, Psalm. 51.14.
(being greater than that of adultery, because more premeditated, and acted in
cold blood to cover the other;) or so much as of the person committing it, and
to pray with the Publican, God be merciful to me a sinner Luke 18.13.
.

Nay, if you offer to help him, or to come near his Herodias, you are beside
your text, beyond your commission, and out of protection. His galled conscience
will endure no handling; he winceth, if it be but pointed at. He will have Zoar,
his little one; and, with him, no sin is great, from which he will not be
turned.

Contrarily, the true Christian rests not in generals, Differ.
but descends to particulars.

He begins indeed as Daniel, Dan. 9.5.6.
with a more general confession not thereby to excuse his own sin, as being an
hereditary disease, which he knows not well how to help; but, the more to
magnify Gods infinite patience and long-suffering that has borne with sinners
for so long time, and for so many generations. Yet he rests not so. He
descends to particulars, and mourns for his particular and special falls and
defects; as David, who not only knew his iniquities in the gross, his
birth-sin, and daily failings, but his special sin too, which was ever before
him Psalm. 51.3.
. He not only confesses with the Apostle James, that in many things we offend
all; Jam. 3.2.
and, with Paul, that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, Romans
3.23.
But, with Peter, he goes out and weeps bitterly for his particular sin: and
ingenuously not only confesses but under his hand sets down and records it to
all posterity as David, Psalm 51. the title, and ver. 14
and Paul, what his special sins were, giving God the glory of his mercy and
taking to himself the shame of those very sins that needed such pardons.

He allows himself in no sin, in no degree of sin, but, 1 Timothy 1.13
with Job makes a Covenant with his eyes, Job. 31.1.
that he may prevent adultery of the heart, Mat. 3.28.
as well as of the body; and with his lips, as David Psalm. 39.1.
to prevent what he may, all offending with his tongue; as being well aware,
that although he be a nonesuch for perfection that does not at all offend in
his tongue, Jam. 3.2.
yet he is a nothing in Religion, that refraineth not his tongue all that he
can. Jam. 1.26.


Thus, this hypocrite, being impleaded, declineth the trial: the true Christian
confesses the action, although he do what he can to stop judgment, the one
pleads the general pardon of course, not considering the exceptions; the
other procures a special pardon for his proper offense, lest the exceptions in
the general pardon, exclude him from mercy: the one confesses by halves, and
with concealment of the main thing to be confessed, and so loses his labor,
the other confesses all, and gets his pardon.

This hypocrite is bold where he should keep distance; and, stands aloof, where
he should

That saucy Pharisee drew near in boldness, when he went up into the Temple
to pray, Luke 18.10.11
and to tell God a story of his own goodness, for which he offered a
sacrifice of thanksgiving, as welcome to God as the cutting off of a Dogs neck,
or the offering of Swines blood, Isa. 66.3.
whereby the nearer he pressed into Gods presence the further off from
acceptance, because so far from true grace, and repentance: Thus, the proud
Hypocrite draws near, when he cries, My God we know thee Hos. 8.2.
. When God knows no such matter, but tells him to his head, Israel has cast
off the thing that is good ver. 3.
. And it is a common presumption, to scrape acquaintance with God in necessity,
before men turn to him by true repentance, to remove their misery, crying to
him, My Father, My Father; even when they go on to do as evil things as they
can Jer. 3.4, 5.
.

On the other hand, where he may and ought to come near, he stands aloof: yea,
where he would be thought to be very near, he stands afar off; Thus, they who
draw near with their mouths, and honor him with their lips, but their hearts
are far from the Lord. Mat. 15.8.
He keeps God at staves end, and gives God the Law, rather then come up to
Gods. He rests in some outward means, and enjoying the bodily part of
Ordinances; which is but bodily exercise that profits little, 1 Timothy 4.8.
and contenteth himself to be sacramentally holy, Number. 16.3.
a Church Christian, as all others are, within the pale of the Church visible.

All the holiness he has or desires, is no more but what puts a difference
between him and a heathen that has no right to the holy things of God
dispensed in the visible Church: which only admits him to the Feast, but is
no warrant for his welcome. Not Religion known, professed, disputed, and
asserted; but, God obeyed, makes us differ from reprobates.

He says of inward holiness, and holy things which make up the wedding garment
for the soul, as Paul of things indifferent, I will not be brought under the
power of any. 1 Cor. 6.12.
The fear of being too much under the power of godliness makes him to stand
aloof (as the Fox at a distance, from the Lions Den) even when he seems to
press nee^est into Gods outward presence; and, to use greatest Court-ship,
where he intends nothing but cheating

There are many approaches to Christ and Christianity, that hold men off at a
very great distance from salvation; yea, that sets them further off (as they
use the matter) than Sodom. Mat. 11.24.
Agrippa was almost persuaded to be a Christian: but almost, is no better than
nothing at all. The righteous sometimes are scarcely saved; 1 Pet. 4.18.
yet saved, because that is more then almost. Quod vix fit, fit; quod fere fit,
non fit. That which is scarce done is done, although with much ado: but that
which is but almost done, is not done, because all that is done, goes not
beyond almost. The Young man that came running to our Savior had something in
him that was lovely; Mat 10.21.
yet when Christ put him to the trial of the truth of what he professed, he
lost all his labor, and would rather leave Christ, with sorrow, than come
nearer to him in duty ver. 21.
. The Scribe that answered discreetly, was not far from the Kingdom of God Mat.
12.34.
, in outward performance, yet never got into it, because he never came near it
in spiritual obedience.

Many dwell in the outer Court, that have no place in the Temple; many arrive
at the Suburbs of Jerusalem who never dwelt within the gates of Zion.
Profession not answered, good motions not seconded, grace stinted, the Spirit
quenched is the Religion of most that would be thought religious. Men hold
correspondence with the Lord rather than a confederation; friendship at a
distance, rather than familiarity as intimate friends, make use of him for
commerce and profit, rather than for delight.

This hypocrite will be content sometimes to go to God, and that God should
come to him; but, rather to give God a visit, than to serve him; and that God
should be an honor and countenance to him, rather then command him. Nor does
he like God should come too near, or to take him aside in private, lest he tell
him that in his ear that he is unwilling to hear of. He likes well with
Balaam, the comforts of death that the righteous reap: but, (as you love him,)
not a word of living their life. He may look on at a distance, to see God in
the Bush; but he cares not to go nearer, because God is too holy for his turn.
He may pry into the Ark, as the Philistines did, and perform some external
duties of praying, hearing, communicating, etc. But, to enter into that which
is within the veil, by that new and living way laid open by Christ; Heb. 10.20.
is too much for him to attempt. He is content to hear off God by the hearing
of the ear, but cares not to see him Job. 42.5.
with his eye of contemplation, or faith, or to take a full view of him, and to
have a spiritual sense, and savor of Gods fatherly love in his heart that may
bring him out of love with his lust He can lodge Christ in the stable or some
other outhouses, in the ears, lips, and perhaps in the Garret of his thoughts
and memory, but not in the inner Chambers of the conscience or affections, much
less in the chief Chamber, the heart, which is Gods proper seat, and by him
expressly challenged Pro. 23.26.
.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian is not satisfied without private and
nearest access to God.

He will not be contented that God give him a meeting in Gods house, unless he
will go home, and sup with him, Rev. 3.20.
and lodge with him, and make his abode with him, Joh 14.23.
what ever others do, it is good for me, says he, to draw near to God. Psalm.
73.28.
He will not only repair to his Court; but as Absalom he must see the Kings
face, (d) thy face Lord will I seek, Psalm. 27.8.
says all the generation of them that seek him: and he will behold his face in
righteousness, not in hypocrisy as compassing him about with lies, and
flattering him with his lips.

If the Church meet Christ in the street, although overjoyed to find him, yet
she is not content with that, but she holds him fast; nor with that, until she
had brought him into her mothers house, yea into the inmost and most secret
Chamber and closet of her soul, where Christ and his Spirit had first begotten
her again unto a lively hope through grace; that he dwell there. Ephesians. 3.17.


Thus a Christian may be said to bring the Church home from Church; public
exercises to private meditation; the Sabbath to the week day to sabbatise every
day by rumination and chewing the end, after his double portion of Mannah upon
the Lords Day. He labors all the week to keep his heart at that pitch that
it was at the time of hearing. He ends not his lesson as Boys do so soon as
they get out at the School door, but minds even at home what was given him in
charge against the next meeting.

The Lord delights not so to overlay his people with Legal dues, but that he
leaves some room and time for voluntary service and free will offerings; not
in a legal, but evangelical sense; not as meriting, but as showing their
willingness to do more than in strictness is required of him that is saved by
grace, although it be exacted of him that would be justified by works of what
nature soever. God calls not for Sabbath duties that we should give him no more,
but that we might not put him off with less, but freely add to it, to show
how much we made the Sabbath our delight, feeding upon it all the week after;
not needing an Almanac or Dominical letter to tell us when the Sabbath will
come about again, but bearing it so much in our hearts, that our own breathings
after God will tell us when it is time again to go to Church, albeit never a
Bell wag to call us thither. The Christians heart is his Bell, and will save
his ear the labor of listening after any other.

He is not content to be ranged among those who are of Israel by common account
and in the judgment of charity, but he will be a true Israelite, a Nathanael
in whom is no guile, that he may receive from God himself the blessing
belonging to Israel, as well as the name. As he lodges Christ in his own
heart, so he prays Christ to set him as a seal upon his, Cant. 8.6.
and as a badge upon his arm. He desires more acquaintance and countenance
from the Lord than Princes vouchsafe to all their subjects, who give them
common greetings at public Conventions. He must have more; even private
favors usually bestowed on Favorites in the Court of heaven. He must be not
only of the Bedchamber, but sleep in the bosom of his Lord, and know all his
secrets communicable to those who fear him in truth, Psalm. 25.14.
and are esteemed his friends Joh. 15.15.
He is not satisfied, to gaze upon the adorning of the Temple with goodly
stones and gifts, Luke 21.5.
but he must himself become the Temple of the living God, 2 Cor. 6.16.
unto whom God must say, this is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I
have desired it, Psalm. 132.14.
as well as he. In a word he never gives over seeking and drawing nearer and
nearer to God, until he find that prayer of Christ to his Father in behalf of
the whole body and of himself, as a member thereof, [ That they all may be one
in us; Joh. 17.21.
] fully accomplished.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the proud Pharisee never further off than when he
seems to draw nearest to God; the true Christian; as the penitent Publicane,
that drew much nearer in acceptance, when he stood farthest off. Luke 18.13, 14.
The one, contenteth himself with Bethel the House of God; the other, longs
after Peniel, the face of God Genesis 32.30.
: the one visits his Temple, the other is built up for an habitation of God
through the Spirit. Ephesians. 2.22.


This hypocrite is a great admirer of Formalists, and a sharp censurer of those
who go

He that can content himself with a form of godliness, and a stinted exercise
of Religion, must needs be best pleased with those of his own judgment and
practice: and is unwilling to be thought alone in it. Therefore if he find any
Gamaliel some learned, grave man, that all know and own to be a great Scholar,
that is in reputation among all the people, he thinks he can never
sufficiently admire and applaud him: You see, says he, such an one a great
learned man, an honest godly sober Christian; he is not so precise and
singular, so zealously fiery; He contents himself with the Book of common
Prayer, and one Sermon a day. He thinks it is as much as any man can do, if not
too much, to preach as he should do once a week. He is not against harmless
recreations upon the Sun-day; nor keeps such ado about faith and troth, etc.
as the Puritans do, but sometimes uses it himself. Here Is a man, says he,
for my money. Let all the Puritans in the Country show me his fellow, for
learning, honesty, and gravity. Therefore let them say what they will, I am
resolved to follow him for my pattern: God make me but half so good as he, and
I shall never care to be better. Thus, if Gamaliels name be once up, let him
give what advice he will, all agree to it Acts 5.40.
.

This Hypocrite looks not who is the devoutest man, but who is most like
himself; not who is the best man, but who is the more learned; and he applauds
him, not for his learning, but his opinion; not for his goodness, but his
practice suitable to his course that admires him; in other things that suit not
his lusts, he will as soon leave him as he would any other man; as they who
would by force make Christ a King, for feeding their bellies John 6.15.
afterward thrust him out of the City, and led him to the brow of an Hill
(upon which their City was built) that they might cast him down headlong Luke
4.29.
and break his neck.

And while he is such an admirer of the Formalist, can any man think it strange
to hear him sharply to censure all that go beyond him? If Christ be followed
more then a Pharisee; if the people once begin to follow him, and he grow
popular, and the Pharisees perceive it, it shall not be long ere they send
their Pursevants to apprehend him John 7.32.
. But woe to the Officers, if they bring him not. If they plead for themselves,
Never man spoke like this man Verse 46.
: the great Rabbi's think this the poorest answer that could be given. What,
say they, are ye also deceived? Your betters know better. Look upon us your
Guides and Masters, that know more than you. Have any of the Rulers or of the
Pharisees believed on him verse 48.
? As if it were a great crime to go beyond their betters in religion, and in
taking him for Christ, whom they looked upon as an Impostor: and therefore
concluded (as this hypocrite does of all that out-go him in godliness) this
people that know not the Law, are cursed Verse 49.
. Whosoever does more, he is a precise fool; and so are all that put him upon
it.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is no censurer of any, but humbly imitates
the best.

Charity thinks no evil 1 Cor. 13.5.
to others, or of others, of whose actions any tolerable construction may be
made. Therefore, the Christian abhorres to be many Masters, that is, one of
those supercilious censurers of other men's actions, that take upon them
magisterially to mount the chair of pride and arrogance (without commission
from God or man) and to sit in judgment upon all, or any at their pleasure: as
knowing, that whoever does thus, shall receive the greater condemnation James
3.1.
for he shall not only be paid home in his own coin by others, because with
what judgment he judges, he shall be judged Mat. 7.2.
: not for the kind alone, but for the measure too; but especially from God
himself, who is most severe against censurers, that are merciless to others,
and are greater offenders themselves Romans 2.1.
; and in condemning others, pass a judgment, which in the issue, will light
heaviest upon themselves, and so pronounce their own doom, by dooming others.

Therefore, when the Christian sees this in others, he meekly and humbly
endeavors to allay and divert this humor; and where he finds this lashing
temper to abound, he seeks to let it out; as Jehoshaphat did in Ahab, bitterly
declaring his distaste and hatred against Michaiah, I hate him, for he does not
Prophecy good concerning me, but evil; Jehoshaphat pacifieth him, saying, Let
not the King say so 1 King. 22.8
. Thus Jonathan sought to appease the fury of Saul against David, upon the base
opinion he had of him, that he would surely keep Jonathan from the Crown, and
therefore resolved that he should surely dye: Jonathan resolutely replies,
Wherefore shall he be slain? What has he done 1 Samuel 20.3^
?

And so far is he from envying or censuring those that outstrip him, that he
makes them his patterns; he will follow their faith, considering the end of
their conversation; if he cannot keep company with them, he will keep in sight
of them at least, and follow them so fast as he can, as Jacob promised to
follow Esau, as his flocks and children were able to endure Genesis 33.14.
. And when he finds himself compassed about with a cloud of witnesses that have
gone before him with a more speedy and exemplary course of faith and holiness,
he will then hasten to cast off every weight that before was a clog, and even
those sins that were most sweet and did most easily compass him and held him
back; and so, mends his pace; resolving now no longer to walk after an ordinary
rate; but to run with patience the race that is set before him Heb. 12.1.
, and to press toward the mark Phil. 3.14.
with more resolution and violence than ever before.

Thus, this Hypocrite is like those that chose rather to sacrifice with
Harlots, Hos. 4.14.
that would not be too hasty in their devotions; the true Christian had rather
with Abraham, run to the herd for a Calfe and give it to him that will make
most haste to dress it, lest the Lord depart before he make ready Genesis 18.6,
7, 8
: the one blesses the loiterer, that does the Lords work negligently; the
other rather imitateth Ahimaaz that out-runnes all; the former censureth those
that are fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, as being too hot and too fleet;
the other concludes it to be much better to be zealous in a good thing,
always, remembering Gods censure and threatening of Laodicea, for being too dull
and too slow.

CHAP. XVII. The Waxing Hypocrite Is he who seems to increase, but grows
not. Defin.

IN show, he shoots up, and waxes big, but in truth grows not at all, even
when he would be thought to thrive most. Therefore I term him the Waxing
Hypocrite, because however, in his own conceit, and perhaps in the opinion of
others, he wax bigger then others, yet is he but a very Changling, no true
convert; seeming to be what he is not; and rather swelling through tumors, (as
a child diseased with the rickets,) than truly coming on in grace, by spiritual
growth as a Newborn babe 1 Pet. 2.2.
in Christ.

Growth, in a Christian, is proprium (...), the proper affection of saving
grace 2 Pet. 3.17.
. And this, as much as any thing, discriminateth a true Israelite, from such as
are of Israel, but are not Israel Romans 9.6.
. Yet even herein also this hypocrite puts in for a part, although he has no
more part nor lot in this matter, than Simon Magus Acts 8.21.
, because his heart is not right in the sight of God.

He makes a great show of being very good, like the creatures in their first
creation: but, his goodness is as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that
goes away Hos. 6.4.
, without performing what it promises. A morning cloud promises rain, but
oft-times proves like the niggards liberality, dry and barren: he boasts
himself of a false gift, being like clouds and wind without rain Prove. 25.14.
. The early dew makes as much show upon the grass, as a good shower falln on
the ground, but is only a sign of an hot scorching day. So this Hypocrites
goodness, and seeming increase in it makes show of much for the present, and
promises more to ensue, as if none were likely to bring in so much fruit and
so plentiful an harvest unto God, as he, whereas in the issue, he is as the
grass upon the house tops, which withers before it grows up, wherewith the
Mower fills not his hand; nor he that binds sheaves his bosom Psalm 129.6,
7.
.

The crop is so lean and thin, that it quits not the cost of the Husbandman,
nor gives so much content to the observing passenger going by, as to move him
to say to the reapers, the blessing of the Lord be upon you Verse 8.
: because he thinks them ill employed to bestow so much labor for so little
fruit. Wild Oats shoot up as high and fast as other grain, but yield not
like profit. A Dwarf may be as great as a Giant by addition of clothes, yet is
he but a Dwarf and Urchin still. So is this Hypocrite, far from spiritual
growth, nowithstanding his seeming increase.

Differ.
On the contrary, All is truly growing in the Christian, and himself grows in
all.

Crescens 2 Timothy 4.10.
is a fit name for him, because he is ever in a growing state: grace having the
fame efficacy upon the soul, which the soul has upon the body, while the body
is in a growing condition; the soul inlargeth the body in all the parts and
dimensions that the members may not only fill more cloths, but take in more
nourishment, and so become more strong and serviceable: in like manner the
inner-man truly grows up in Christ in all things, by the working of the
Spirit of Christ as the soul of new life within him, so enlarging and
strengthening every member that it may be a meet instrument of righteousness
to bring forth fruit unto God.

There is great difference betwixt the sweat of the earth, which is the dew,
and the dew of heaven, which is the rain. For the one makes the earth more
ready to scorch, the other waters the earth, and makes it fruitful. The
odds is no less between this Hypocrite and the true Christian. Whatever dew
of goodness seems to lie thick upon the Hypocrite, it has only earth for its
original, and so cannot make any thing to grow which seems to be wet with this
dew. But every drop that falls from heaven upon the true Christian, makes him
to grow and to yield fruits of increase.

Thus, this Hypocrite is like a Giant in a painted cloth that never attained
those dimensions by any growth from a principle of life within; the true
Christian is in proportion like to the humane nature of Christ in his
childhood, increasing in wisdom, and stature, and in favor with God and man
Luke 2.52.
; the one is like a snowball that by rolling waxes bigger and bigger in bulk;
the other, as Meal Mat. 13.33.
, which by Leaven put into it, rises within, and so becomes more useful.

This Hypocrites seeming growth is only by accretion, not by vegetation.

Many things without life waxing greater, seem to grow, by an accretion or
addition of like things from without, as stones, and clouds, as well as the
snow-ball: So this Hypocrite living under the Meridian of Ordinances and godly
Christians, coming among them, catching here a piece, and there a piece, by
hearing, fashion, example, and imitation; and so something or other still
hangs on, and cleaves to him, like moist sand to a wheel going upon it,
that makes the wheel seem bigger in the spoaks and vellews, then indeed it is.
And so the Hypocrite grows bigger in some phrases, gestures, outward garb and
motions of a true Christian, but without any augmentation from life and heat of
grace within; And so, all his growth is but like a thick coat of mortar laid
upon a wall; He waxes, but he grows not: there is an augmentation such as it
is, but not by vegetation from an inward principle of life that first operates
within, and then makes the augmentation to be in the whole body, not in the
clothes with which the body is covered. And so, when he speaks religiously, it
is but as a Parret, using the voice of a man; but, without the mind and
intellect: when he moves to or to any spiritual duty, it is like an Ape
imitating reasonable actions without reason to guide him in them.

Contrarily, the true Christian has his nourishment without, Differ.
but his growth from within.

His nourishment comes as from the market; but as meat is first taken into the
stomach, and afterward nourishes the parts within, and then sends it self
forth again into all the outward members; so the Christian, from the word taken
in as Milk 1 Pet. 2.2.
, receives nourishment from without, which operates first within, after he has
hid the word in his heart Psalm. 119.11.
; and then, from the heart, he begins to spread and increase more and more
outwardly, till it bud forth (as sap from the root, through the bark of a tree)
and show it self in the outward man, and in his whole conversation also.

He puts on Religion, not only, or first, as an outward garment to cover
him; or, for fashion; but, as his skin which is first formed and perfected by
grace from the nourishment of life within, and thence it receives all the
loveliness and beauty that afterward appears in it. He first grows within,
and then without. He is as the silkworm, that spins her coat out of her own
bowels, after she has received all her alterations and growth from an inward
increase. He is first engraffed into Christ; then, from Christ, the heart
draws so much nourishment, as thereby Christ is formed in him, that is, within
him (as the seed by natural heat and warmth comes to be fashioned into members,
and into a body like the parent); and so, from hence it is that he grows, and
brings forth in the life, not only the leaves of profession, but the fruits
of obedience unto God John. 15.5.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Hercules in a suit of hangings; in one piece a
little child, in another, a grown man; the other as Hercules living, that from
an infant grew to that strength and prowess as to be able to encounter and
master the strongest Giant, the fellest creatures; the one is as a Basket in
the Market, full of fruit which never grew there; the other, as a tree in the
Orchard, that bare those fruits, and many more.

The Hypocrite grows by excretion in the outward parts only.

His growth is rather like that of the hair and nails which nature puts out
as excrements of the skin and outward parts, and as purgaments of the body, of
which nature desires to unburden her self, and which grow even when a man is
dead, so long as there is any moisture left to feed them. It is not a growth in
the inner man: Or, if there be any show of an increase within, it is no other
than as the kernels that are found in the body, which are rather the errors,
than the effects of concoction. There may be an extuberation of knowledge, some
flashings and flashes of an unkindly zeal, some violent affections, rather than
well-guided motions; all which are but as kernels in the body, no kindly flesh;
as a mola or timpany of pride or affection, proceeding from rankness of heart,
being vainly put up of his fleshly mind Col. 2.18.
which is diametrally opposed by the Apostle to the increase of the members of
the body of Christ, from whom they have nourishment ministered.

Wherefore, although this Hypocrite may have some accretions of knowledge,
zeal, and of some external formalities, yet they are all but as wens in the
body, or as exuberances in the blood, seek vent by the pores. For which reason
the Apostle pronounces such knowledge, no knowledge 1 Cor. 8.2.
; such zeal, no zeal Romans 10.2.
; such grace, no grace Acts 8.21.
, and consequently such growth to be no growth; no otherwise than as the growth
of the nails and hair in a dead man; for, this hypocrite has only a name
that he lives, but is indeed dead Rev. 3.1.
, even as she that lives in pleasure (pretending to Religion, and making show
of ordinary zeal) is dead while she lives 1 Timothy 5.6.
.

Contrarily, the true Christian increases with the increase of God. Differ.


His increase is kindly, and it is from nourishment received from his head,
which diffuseth it self to the whole man, and makes him to grow in solid grace
not in exuberances of wit; in his limbs and strength, not in swellings of
heart, nor in external profession and formalities, which, were ever found
alone, are no better then excrements. Whatever grows, whatever shows of growth
appear in him, proceeds not from the excrescency of corruption, but from the
godly nature 2 Pet. 1.4.
from the increase of faith, drawing more virtue from Christ Phil. 3.10, 11
; and of love, whereby he grows up into him in all things, which is the head,
even Christ Ephesians. 4.15.
.

All his gettings, all his growings are the fruits of Hearing, Meditation,
Prayer, a good conscience, and all the fruits of the Spirit. In all things he
is (...), taught of God, and so taught, that his teaching quickens him, makes
him to thrive, to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ 2
Pet. 3.18.
; God continually perfecting, and thoroughly furnishing him unto all good works
2 Timothy 3.17
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the mushrome, or puff, which are but excrements;
the true Christian is as the new-born-babe that grows up by the sincere milk of
the Word; the one is as the oake-apple, that turns to no benefit or use; the
other is as the tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth his
fruit in his season Psalm. 1.3.


This hypocrite grows a pace at first, but soon withers.

This seed made most haste in the stony ground, where there was least earth;
for there it forthwith sprung up Mat. 13.5.
; but soon withered for want of depth of earth, and for lack of root Jonas his
gourd was up in a night, and became a great shadow to him; but there was a worm
at the root which smote the gourd that it also withered. This is our hypocrites
case; He is very forward; soon ripe, I mean, at his best: yet even then, is far
short of being good: insomuch as he is as the early spring, the hasty fruit
which are grown into a byword for their ominous and commonly unprofitable
forwardness. He is as the grass on the house top Psalm. 129.6.
which perks higher than that of the meadow, but withers much sooner, and
comes to nothing.

A false perfideous heart that devoureth the hope of goodness, usually lies at
the bottom of a more than ordinarily forward beginning; when these like a worm
at the root of a gourd; so that man is so swift as hardly any man can keep pace
with him, he will not long be able to hold pace with himself, for that he soon
out-runs his own breath and power; and so sits down in the midway, and never
comes to the end of his race.

All violent motions are so swift at first, that it is impossible they should be
perpetual. Such is the motion of this hypocrite, who for a while seems to run
well Gal. 5.7.
, but it is but for a spurt. He will soon flag, and tire, and give over, and
come to nothing, as a top that will soon cease running longer than he is lasht
and scourged by something from without to keep him going, because he has no
principle of life in himself to perpetuate the motion.

And no marvel. For the hypocrite being moved only by a corrupt principle of
flesh, whether pride, vainglory, or ambition, sets out furiously, and has few
or none to oppose him. He will not attempt profession of Religion, but when
Religion is in request, and those by whom he seeks to rise, are very religious,
or at least seem to be. And as for all other corruptions within him, he is at
truce with them, until he has either attained his ends, or is wholly crossed in
them. Nor will Satan oppose, while he finds him at work upon no better
foundation, but rather help him to be more cunning and active, until he see
his time to turn him quite off from the way of godliness, which in the issue he
is sure to do.

Differ.
On the Contrary, The true Christian still goes on, and grows as he goes.

He is as Isaac who waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became
very great Genesis 26.13.
. He not only waxes, but grows very great: not for a fit, or in an humor;
but for continuance, upon settled resolution from a serious deliberation. The
righteous shall hold on his way Job 17.9.
. His light shines more and more unto the perfect day Prove. 4.18.
: in this life it is always morning with him, he never attains his noontide
until he has ascended heaven: therefore he is still advancing, still
ascending, always going farward unto perfection Heb. 6.1.
: not only in knowledge, but in all good works, which are more and better at
the latter end than at the first Rev. 2.19.
.

If he receive a pound, he trades with it, and never gives over till the day of
account; by which time, that pound has gained ten pounds Luke 19.16.
. He is still on the thriving hand, and brings forth more fruit in old age,
than at his beginning; nor shall he wither and decay, but still be fat and
flourishing Psalm. 92 14.
. And that because he is the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified:
Jsa. 61.3.
and herein is he glorified, that they who are set into Christ, bring forth
much fruit Joh. 15.8.
. He is a tree of righteousness, always growing, always bearing; either
less or more: not most at the beginning, (which were ominous) but at the last,
which is most honorable and comfortable. And God still bestows more husbandry
upon them who are fruitful, that being purged, they may bring forth more fruit
ver 1.
. A young plant may afford a taste; but as he grows older, he is more fully
laden with the fruits of righteousness Phil. 1.11.
.

A time may be wherein peradventure a Christian may have a stop, through his
own default, (as obstructions may happen to the body, through ill diet, or
other disorder,) whereby Christ has somewhat against him, for leaving his
first love Rev. 2.4.
. But he that discovers that infirmity, offers also the means of recovery,
Remember whence thou art fallen, and repent ver. 5.
. As for natural decays, breaking in by age, sickness, or the like, they may
obstruct some fruit (as a blast by a wind) in a Christian, but not his inward
growth in habit and affection. And his comfort, is that although the outward
man decay, yet the inner man is renewed day by day 2 Cor. 4.16.
. And when he cannot perform so much outward service, as when younger and
stronger in body; yet his soul thriveth, Job. 17.9.
and glories more and more in his God, even to see others stand up in his
steed, whom by counsel, and prayers he much furthereth in the work of the Lord
1 John 2.12, 13, 14.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Jehu, who in his beginning drove furiously 2 King.
9, 20.
; till he had gotten into the throne; and then gave over his destroying of
Idols, for which he was employed to destroy Ahab: the true Christian is as
Jacob, who led on softly, as his cattle and children were able to endure, and
so continued to go on, till his journies end Genesis 34.14.
: The one is as a Comet in the air, which shines very brightly for a season,
but is at last extinct with a stench, because but a slimy slough; the other is
as the morning star in the heavens, that never gives over shining, even when
we are not able to discern it to shine: the motion of the one is violent,
therefore most swift in the beginning; and so cannot hold out: the motion of
the other is natural, which is swiftest at the end, never resting till it
attain the Center: or rather, supernatural, which moves not to rest or
cessation; but, like the heavens, never stands still; As perpetual motion is to
the heavenly bodies their chiefest rest and contentment; Their rest is their
motion, their motion their rest: so is constancy in well-doing, to the
Christian, till he rest from all his labors together.

This Hypocrites pretended growth is without all proportion.

He is as one having the Rickets, great beyond proportion in his head, and a
mere starveling in the rest of the parts. In one part, a Giant; in the rest a
dwarf. He is big and swells in knowledge, but little in conscience; insomuch
as it is a wonder, in such a plentiful harvest of knowledge, to find such poor
gleanings of conscience and true piety. He is all in a flame in zeal, but
little in discretion; much in wisdom in his own opinion, but little in love.
Yea, one part starves another. A bunch of discretion on the back, makes but a
spindle-shank- zeal in the heart. As in the body the spleenes increase is the
pining of the body. So in this Hypocrite where seeming sufficiency grows,
true affection decays. So that all his growth is but a deformity, far worse
than that of the body: for, deformity of body is but an affliction, but all
deformity of the soul is a sin.

Contrarily, the true Christian grows up in Christ in all his parts. Differ.


In his growth there is an effectual working, from the Head, in the measure of
every part Ephesians. 4.16.
. Every Christian is a member, and a part of Christ; and every part (as corn
sown and growing up in good ground) aspireth to the nature and figure of the
head, in his proportion; that every part may be a model and resemblance of the
whole body which is the fullness of him that fills all in all Ephesians. 1.23.
. Yea, so does every piece and particle of each part thrive and grow in Christ.
When he grows in knowledge, he grows in grace too: yea, by growing in grace,
he grows in knowledge 2 Pet. 3.18.
.

He as much aymeth at every grace, as at knowledge, as knowing there is no true
growth in the one, without growth in the other. Therefore he is still adding to
his faith, virtue; to his virtue, knowledge, etc 2 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7
. And is careful not only that these things be in him, but that he abound in
them ver. 8.
; and that as in other things; faith, knowledge, diligence, love 2 Cor. 1.7.
, he abounds, so in all other graces and duties, that nothing of parts at
least, or of growth in them be wanting to make him perfect, thoroughly furnished
to every good work 2 Timothy 3.16.
. Here is a general growth, no mis-matching; all parts hold proportion one with
another.

It is true, that some graces have, in several believers, been more eminent and
conspicuous: as Faith in Abraham; zeal in David; Knowledge and Love of Christ in
Paul: yet, as it falls out in the parts of the body, some man may have a
stronger arm, another a better leg, a third a sweeter face; or some one other
part that may more affect the beholder; yet, all comely, and holding a good
symetry and proportion; so is it among Christians in the endowments of the
soul; Some may excel more in one grace, some in another; yet not so, as one
grace in the same subject is alone, or hinders the growth of another, or to
render any unserviceable, or disproportionable to the rest. There may indeed be
some obstruction in some part of the soul, and of some particular grace in it,
that it thrives not equally as some other graces do; but yet there is life and
some growth, even in that very part, and in time the obstruction will be
removed by him who is able to make all grace abound in him.

No body, how perfect soever, is wholly free from some distemper or obstruction
in some parts of it, nor any soul so exempt from all discracy and disorder, but
that some graces may be obstructed in their growth, so as, his humility,
patience, contempt of the world, or such like, do not hold pace with his faith,
zeal, and love. An ague may hinder the growth of a child for a while, so may
some remains of corruption hinder the growth of a Christian, which being more
mastered and subdued, proves a means of greater and firmer growth afterward.

Thus, this hypocrite in his greatest growth, is but a monster in grace; the
true Christian, in his greatest obstructions has all the parts of the new
creature proportionable; the one, grows in some particular with neglect of the
rest; the other grows up in all things, applying most care, cost, and pains
upon any particular that thriveth least.

This hypocrite seems to grow, but thriveth not.

As some trees or plants in an Orchard, or hedg-row, every spring send up some
sap, and send forth some buds and leaves, but they are either bark-bound, or
otherwise hindered from thriving in height, thickness and fruitfulness, so as
they only take up so much ground, and cumber it, without profit to the owner:
so it is with this hypocrite, he has a place in Gods Vineyard, a name that he
lives; yea, an opinion that he grows; yet it never comes to any thing worthy
of expectation. He is ever learning, yet never able to come to any saving
knowledge of the truth 2 Timothy 3.7.
: as boys that often patter over their lesson, yet are never perfect in it,
movent, sed non promovent, they move, but without progress to purpose.

He is as a stake pitched into a moist piece of ground, where it stands as if
it grew, and perhaps may bud, and put forth a few green leaves the first year,
till a drowth come: but, no more. Nay, he is afraid of thriving too much and
growing too fast in grace, as Augustine sometimes before his conversion, as
doubting to be too soon divorced from his darling lust. As nice mothers fearing
their daughters should exceed the proportion of a beauty, and of a curious
creature, sometimes shorten them in diet, sleep, etc. that they might not grow
too great, and huge in body; so this hypocrite is afraid grace should shoot up
to fast and to high in stature, and prove Athletical to his lust. By which
means, his conscience is like a strait laced girl in the waste, so small and
slender, as makes it as weak and worthless as a rush: liking his graces best,
when they be least, as Ladies do dogs, when smallest; and dwarfes, when least
and lowest. Whereas God delights not in such dwarfs and starvlings, the shame
of the holy seed, and unworthy of the breed of grace.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian is ever a thriving plant that grows more and more.

He never repents of much growing, but all his grief is that he grows no
more. He is like the Vine that shootes out as far as he can, while either
wall, or pole will help him along. He not only lives, but flourishes like the
Palm tree, and grows like a Cedar in Lebanon: for, he is planted (as a Noble
Vine) in the House of the Lord, and therefore must needs flourish in the Courts
of our God, where he will get up by every wall, and bring forth, not only
spacious leaves, but precious fruit even in old age, and still continue fat and
flourishing, Psalm. 92.12, 13, 14.
as a tree of righteousness, of the Lords own planting, that God in him may be
glorified Isai. 61.3.
.

The true Christian is as covetous in spirituals, as any earth-worm in carnals.
He coveteth earnestly the best gifts 1 Cor. 12.31.
, and is never satisfied. He thinks he has gotten nothing, while any thing
more may be had: as Paul, he forgets whatever is behind him, which he has in
possession, out of his covetous desire to reach those things which he has not
already attained, that he may at length hit the very mark it self Phil. 3.12,
13, 14.
, which is every man's aim, but few men's attainment. He had rather be cut down
by death, than not thrive continually. He is as a thriving tree, not a dead
post, or stake, as a quick-set, not a dead hedge. His talent is in the bank,
not in the bag. He will not pinch his conscience, to make it small in the
waste, as they that affect handsomeness more then health; but strives to have
animam athleticam, a soul well-spread, and well-grown, able to try with all
comers, and to be strong in the Lord, to wrestle with the greatest
principalities, and powers, even the greatest Devils within, or without him,
that shall encounter or obstruct his growth in grace.

Thus, this hypocrite is as a young tree in a Coppisse, or wood grub'd up,
which thrives not, even when the nourishment of all the earth near it is
afforded to it; the true Christian, as the Cammomel, which still thriveth, even
while most trodden upon to keep it down; the one is as a man in an hectic
fever, that although sometimes he seems ruddy and fresh, yet daily pineth
away, under best means of cure, and most nourishing gellies; the other is as
Daniel and his fellows, that with pulse and water waxed sairer and fatter Dan.
1.12, 15
, than they who had far better fare; the one has his pitch and period beyond
which he would not grow; the other admits of none, till he grow up into heaven
it self, as knowing that grace will not receive a stop till it end in glory.

This Hypocrites growth is all out of emulation.

He seeks not so much to grow, as to out-grow others whom out of envy he
emulates like the Toad in the fable, that would needs swell as big as the Ox,
envy putting him upon the hazard of the bursting of his skin, without the
least bettering of his condition. It grieves him not that himself is defective
in grace, but it vexes him at heart to be matched by the common sort, and to
be over-matched by those of the best rank. If he see others go before him, this
displeases him, not out of sorrow that himself wants grace, but that he comes
behind others, whom he envies for having more.

Were he to go alone, he cares not how slowly he goes; but, when company calls
on him to mend his pace, this troubles him that they out-go him, and that he is
left behind. Not love to grace, but a spirit of envy makes him to advance; as
self-guiltinesse causes him to envy. No man envies another for virtue, but he
that is known and taken notice of, to have none, or at least less then the
other.

He desires gifts, and happily the best of apparent gifts; not for the gifts,
but for the praise that attends them; that so he may be thought to preach, or
pray, or do, or be better than others: and if he cannot do it best in the
common estimate of others, he cares not to do it at all; for, his love is not
to the work for it self, but to his applause in the doing of it. Thus envy
steps into the room of grace, and puts him upon that which grace does not.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian strives daily to out-grow himself, as
hungring after more grace.

The growth of others is matter of his joy, not of his repining; of his holy
emulation to follow them, not of his envy for getting the start of him. He is
glad that God be better served, though it be by another; his only grief is,
that himself can serve him no better. He is content to be reckoned by others,
and by himself too to be (...) not only little, but the least; not only least,
but less than the least of all Saints Ephesians. 3.8.
; so he labor, daily what he can to grow greater, and better in grace; and not
to rest in his best proceedings, no more than in his first beginnings.

He looks upon the graces of God in others as patterns for imitation, as
glorifying God for them: not as matter of envy and emulation to out-go them for
his own praise, rather than for doing service to God. He propounds for his
patterns not those that come short of him, that so he might rejoice and think
well of himself; but, those that go furthest beyond him, that he may the more
shame his own negligence, and the more provoke his diligence to make the more
haste after them.

Thus, this hypocrite grows (like Apuleius his Cupid) in mere spite and
competition, for vainglory; the true Christian grows out of love to
goodness, and duty to God, in bringing in more glory to his Name; the one
would never care to be so good, if others were worse; the other seeks still to
be better, though others come behind him in goodness.

This hypocrite grows in his own conceit.

Whether he grow or not, yet in his own opinion he grows; and, out of this
conceit, no man can persuade him, although there be no more ground for his
conceit, than there is for his, that believes the house and all things in it to
run round, when himself is giddy. And this imagination of growing is a notable
hindrance of growth. He that thinks himself to be rich when he has nothing,
will never take the right course to be truly wealthy. Multi ad sapientiam per
venissent, nisi putassent se jam pervenisse. Seneca.
Many had arived at the haven of wisdom, had they not conceited themselves to
have attained it before they set forth toward it. Many had become wise men,
had they first became fools that they might be made wise 1 Cor. 3.18.
.

He is like him that came into an harbor, where seeing a great many ships
richly laden, conceited very strongly that they were all his own, whereas he
was never owner of the least part of one. He says, I am rich, and increased in
goods, and have need of nothing, when yet he that knows him better than he
knows himself, pronounces him wretched, and miserable, poor, and blind,
and naked Rev. 3.17.
.

Yea, it is enough to him if he grow in the opinion of others, and that he has
a name that he lives, although he be dead Verse 1.
; Yea, twice dead and plucked up by the roots Jude 12.
. He desires no more of Religion than to be accounted religious, to such a
degree as may serve his purpose to attain his carnal end. Therefore, as some by
Chiapins and long garments to cover them, do seem so tall of stature as to
deceive the eyes of others; and, therein, do satisfy themselves: so this
hypocrite, finding others to be of opinion that he grows, sits down
contented with this, in stead of growth, till he come perfectly to deceive
himself in conceit, as he deceives others with a show.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is the last that sees his own proficiency.

He desires so to walk on in love and holiness, that his profiting may appear
to all 1 Timothy 4.15
, who may bear not false, but true witness to his growth. He is afraid to be
too well thought of, lest it should make him proud, and self-conceited. When
others commend him, he complains: and, whatsoever they say of him, yet he
listens more after what God judges 1 Cor. 4.4.
. Much less will he dare to make himself of the number, or to compare himself
with those that commend themselves 1 Cor. 10.12
; as knowing, that not he that commends himself is approved, but whom the
Lord commends Verse 18.
.

Secum habitat, novit quam sit sibi curta supellex.
He dwells at home, and well he knows, how short his own provision grows.
Let others say of him what they please, his lay always is, I have not already
attained, neither am I already perfect Phil. 3.11.
. He sees indeed that God is very liberal in means, and encouragements, but
his improvements consist rather in desires than in actual progress; and those
desires not so good and so fervent as they should be. He is afraid that if he
should be too well spoken of, the godly may afterward take offense, and the
wicked take advantage, if he come not up fully to what they say of him, and
therefore he rather refuses what others give him, than ambitiously seeks to be
seen and praised of men. He is aware of those secret enemies, pride, and
over-weaning, which lie in wait for him within his own heart. And as for the
good report that goes of him, he makes good use of that, laboring not so much
to seem what he is, as be what he seems.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a mad man needing physic, but defying the
Physician because he thinks he needs him not; the other, as one sensible of his
distemper, seeks to the Physician for help; the one says, what need I further
goodness, being accounted to be good? the other concludes, I had need to be
every day better, being so well thought of.

This hypocrite would seem to grow in greater matters, without making any
reckoning of

In evils to be avoided he pretends (as the Pharisees) to be very zealous of
shunning the great and foulest acts; as murder, adultery, theft, etc.
interpreting the Commandments, as the hypocrites of old did, of killing
outright, of actual defilement of his neighbors wife, and of actual
purloyning and taking away his neighbors goods; and of these (he thanks God)
he is wholly free; yea, hates them; but, for rash and unadvised anger, and
foul reviling Language, of dolt, and ass, and fool, etc. the sins of the eye
in looking after a woman, to lust after her, wanton glances, gestures,
attrectations, etc. defrauding, overreaching in bargaining, and cousening men
with false or counterfeit wares, for vain thoughts, contemplative wickedness,
sins in fashion and in request, he is altogether careless, and thinks these
may be as well despensed with, as Naamans bowing himself in the house of
Rimmon, to serve and please his Master: not considering that the very lust of
the eye, and the lusts of the flesh are flesh, and works of the the flesh; yea,
when terminated upon a particular object, are actual sins, although the act of
the body in the more gross commission of the bodily part of the sin be not
committed.

So, in duties to be performed, he judges of duties, as men who look on his
performances of them, are apt to judge of him for so doing; those, to be
greatest, which are most in view, and for which men are most apt to commend
him. And, of these, he seems very careful; he will not miss a Sermon of a
famous preacher, nor a Sacrament, nor a public fast; of all these, he seems
every day more zealous; but, of more private duties, in the family, and in the
closet; he is, for the most part (if not altogether) careless; because these
in his opinion, are of less concernment, forasmuch as men cannot so easily
take notice of these, as of those more publicly performed, and so cannot
reward him with the praise of men, which he loves more than the praise of God.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian is careful to grow in the smallest matters that concern his
duty.

He is as the thrifty worldling, that will not lose the least opportunity of
the smallest gain, but will lay hold upon it, if the least profit present it
self to him. He knows that he will never be rich who is not penny wise, as well
as careful of pounds. Indeed, in worldly things, some are too thrifty, whom I
commend not; yet in spirituals, a Christian can never be too frugal and
careful; and therefore, therein, if he imitate the worldling, he is not to be
condemned, but rather approved. He will not, in cousening his Master in earthly
things, imitate the unjust Steward, whom his Lord commended for doing wisely
Luke 16.8.
for himself; yet he will not come short of him, in seeking to make sure all
the grace he can, by all ways and means possible, especially when he sees all
going from him, or himself from it. He wi l herein call in any man to help at a
dead lift, nor will his Lord ever find fault with him for so doing: for, even
Christ himself would have Christians learn by such examples to provide better
for themselves in spirituals.

Covetousness of grace is not blameworthy, because excess herein is no sin,
but a desirable blessing. Ambition to be above, and to go beyond others in
spiritual advancements, whereby we may be more acceptable to God, (so the heart
be kept humble) is not a blot, but an honor. Here is no fear of a nimium,
where no care is sufficient.

Thus, this hypocrite, like the careless Prodigal, is careless of smaller
expenses and wastes, and thereby comes to poverty ere he be aware; the true
Christian is careful (as the thriving tradesman) to save whatever may be
gotten, be it never so little, as knowing this to be the surest way to grow
rich; and therefore, will gather up the fragments that nothing be lost John
6.12.
; the one, is as the deceitful builder who is careful to have good stuff in
the outsides of his wall, but cares not what trash and rubbish he throws into
the middle, which is out ofsight, and so after standing a while, down comes the
wall; the other, is as the faithful Artist, who will have all choice stuff,
and take as much care of the inward fillings, as of the outward frontispice,
because his building is for strength and use, as well as beauty and ornament:
for continuance, as well as for present show.

This hypocrite grows in quantity, but not in quality.

He grows in greatness, but not in strength; in limbs, but not in agility.
As some have great heads, but little wit; or, much wit, but little wisdom; so
the hypocrite holds out a great bulk of profession, and happily of knowledge too,
which are but the body of Religion, but little zeal, affection, spirit; which
are the life and soul of Christianity, and the power of godliness.

Even Judas, by conversing with Christ, could not but grow in knowledge; but,
not being set into Christ, never grew in grace. Nor need we doubt, but before
he fell into treason, he preached Christ, as many others after did, even out of
envy and strife Phil. 1.15.
; but we never read any syllable of any good he did to himself or others
thereby. All the news we hear of him, is, of his wickedness; nothing, of
grace.

Where we meet with a learned hypocrite, the greater his learning and parts,
the more mischief he does in the Church; and the more mischievous he grows,
the less pious he daily declares himself, Alexander the Copper Smith, being a
witty man, (as most Mercurialists that deal in metals are) did Paul and the
Gospel more hurt, than others of weaker parts could possibly do; for he, says
the Apostle, has greatly withstood our words 2 Timothy 4.15
. Men of strongest parts, where grace is wanting, are the Devils stoutest
champions, and Christ's greatest enemies.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian grows more in quality than in quantity.

If he grow in bulk, he grows more in solidity, and even when he grows not in
limbs, he grows in strength. For, the righteous shall hold on his way, and he
that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger Job 17.9.
. So that it may be truly said of him, compared with the Hypocrite, Major in
exiguo regnabat corpore virtus: the hypocrites body may be greater, but the
strength and virtue of the Christian is far more. And as Zeno said of his
Scholars compared with those of Theophrastes: His is the greater Quire, but
mine make the better Music; so may it be truly said, of the true Christian,
that his melody is sweeter to Gods ear, although the hypocrites be much the
louder.

He grows every day more spiritual, although he make not so great a show. His
knowledge becomes more judicious; his zeal, more discreet; his love, more
solid and active; more to God, and less to himself and the world. He settles
himself more and more in his good course, he is more inwardly sound at heart
Psalm. 119.80
, although not outwardly more fair. Happily some outward warts, or freckles of
infirmity, (as indiscretion, sudden passion, want of a strict watch at
sometimes, may at times appear on him) but, the sickness is so much the more
expelled from the vitals, whereas the hypocrite is full of apostumations, and
suppurations of guile and falsehood within, even when he seems most smooth,
fair, and well-liking without.

Thus, the hypocrite is as light ears, that perke up above heavier corn; the
Christian rather hangs the head, as the well grown ear: the one inwardly
pineth as a perishing tree at the heart, while he seems to flourish without;
the other still grows to most profit to the owner, even when he seems to be
bark-bound, and to stand at a stay in outward appearance; the one swells, the
other truly grows.

CHAP. XVIII. The Temporary Hypocrite Is he that entertaines Religion and
Goodness for the time being. Defin.

I Deal not here with the Temporizer, who takes up only a show of Religion
(knowing himself to be a counterfeit) merely to serve the time, and himself of
it; but, with him that seems to himself, as well as in the opinion of others,
to take up Religion and goodness really, and in good earnest, at the present;
but, not into an honest and good heart, and so abides in it but for a time.

This is he that of all others will give us most matter, and most labor,
should we trace him to the end of all his wanderings; for, how shall we do to
know and discover him to the bottom, that knows not himself?

The Temporizer indeed deceives others, mocketh the Church, and collogneth
with the world; yet, knows his own meaning and intent well enough, as Judas
that followed Christ for the bag and bagage, being a thief, a traitor, a Devil
from the beginning. Such another also was Simon Magus, who when he saw it was
no boot to strive in the open habit and profession of a Sorcerer, because men,
formerly great admirers and followers of him, daily fell from him to Philip,
when they heard and saw the miracles which Philip did Acts 8.6.
; by which, the Evangelist cried down his delusions: he then betook himself to
this Stratagem, to profess belief in Christ; and, being baptized, continued
with Philip, making great show of wondering at him, beholding the miracles and
signs which were done Verse 13.
: in all which notwithstanding, he only lay in the wind for advantage, hoping
to make a better market of his new faith, than (as things now stood) could be
expected from his old sorcery.

But this our Temporary is the great deceiver of the world, of the Church, and
himself: for, when he thinks to put tricks upon his own heart James 1.26
, his heart, being the more cunning Jugler, deceives himself Verse 12.
most. He not only deceives others in show, but himself in conceit. For, for
any thing he knows or perceives, he is in good earnest, and means in good
faith. For, he becomes not only like, but equal, yea superior to the true
Christian in his own opinion, in his beginnings of profession of grace and
conversion; the difference lies only in the honest and good heart Luke 8.15.
, receiving the Word, and cleaving to the Lord with purpose of heart Acts 11.23.
, without separation, or backsliding.

Yet, because these two hypocrites, the Temporizer, and the Temporary, do often
enterfeire one upon another, I must crave patience of Logical Readers, if I
seem sometimes to mingle Heterogenials, and to tautologize, speaking things of
the one that agree to the other, and then come over some of the same things
again, in speaking of the other.

Our greatest business with the Temporary, is, to turn his inside outward, and
to lay open his heart: where, if any shall move that question of the Prophet;
the heart being deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can
know it Jer. 17.9.
? Thanks be to God who makes this answer, (by which we may be guided in this
enterprise), I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins Verse 10.
. And thanks to our blessed Savior, who as he knew them, that knew not
themselves John 2.24.
; he has left us some direction how to find out this self-deceiving hypocrite,
whom he describes under the Parable of the stony ground Mat. 13.5, 6.
, wherein there is some earth, but more stone and rock Luke 8.6.
; Some earth it had, but not enough: no deepnesse of earth to give nourishment
to the seed sown in it and to preserve it from withering. This stony ground he
describes two ways; first, by the ingresse, and progress; then, by the base
regresse of this Hypocrite.

First, upon sowing the seed of the Word, he with joy receives it Mat. 13.20.
, and immediately it springs up; not because well-rooted; but, because it has
no depth of earth Mar. 4.5.
. He is soon won, even before he considers what that which he so hastily
embraces, will cost him: and, being so won to, and by the Word, the Word
springs up in him with greater celerity than it uses to do in better ground,
as grass on the house, or wall; which having the advantages of air and Sun,
shootes up sooner, than other grass in the richest soil.

He receives the Ministers of the Word (especially such who are in greatest
esteem) gladly and honorably, as Herod did the Baptist Mar. 6.20.
; and, for a while, as the Galatians did Paul Gal. 4.14.
, receiving him even as an Angel of God, yea even as Christ. Jesus He
condemns of impiety those that refuse or neglect hearing. His heart is
somewhat softened, as Ahabs 1 King. 21.27, 29.
; but yet not opened to purpose, as Lydia's Acts 16.14.
; nor enlarged, as David's Psalm. 119.32
. So that some root the Word takes, but not enough. Christ is welcome to the
hatch, or door, perhaps to the Hall, (where all comers are entertained, and
thereby some acquaintance is begun;) but, not to the closet, or Bedchamber
Cant. 3.4.
, whereby there may be a nearer friendship contracted.

Secondly, our Lord describes him by his too hasty regress also, after all
that glorious ingresse, and progress. He has no root, no depth of earth,
therefore no moisture for continuance. He dureth but for a season. The Winter
nips him, the Sun scorcheth him. When tribulation comes because of the Word,
he is by and by offended, and angry with himself that he engaged so far. He
goes away, as corn parched, or withered. If the summer be not too hot, he may
perhaps make a shift for a while: but if once the heat scorch him, he is like
Jonahs gourd, that can hold up no longer. While the peace of the Gospel
lasts, this Hypocrite holds up his head; who, higher? But, if that be
withdrawn, this green Bay tree passes away, and lo he is not, and cannot be
found Ps. 37.35, 36
in his former station and rank.

In the general, he entertaineth Religion and Goodness by whole sale. He not
only lays a true ground, or general proposition, he that believes shall be
saved; but, has a part in the assumption, I also believe; which for ought he
knows, he does for a time; and has, to his own thinkings, some beginnings of
grace in him, and does not intentionally and industriously counterfeit, as some
others do, but seems to have some true seeds in him; but, not in a true heart,
and therefore they never attain their true growth and perfection.

He entertaineth goodness therefore for the time being, but not from a good
heart. For, he casts not before hand what it will cost him. He looks only at
the present sunshine, without considering future storms, or preparing for
them. He knows not his own mind, but thinks to hold out, and will see no
reason to the contrary. He has meditata commodas, but not incommoda. He looks
on what he may gain by Religion, but not what he may lose. He enters into his
profession, without foresight or care of after-inconveniences. He lays a
foundation of an house, not considering the cost, and so leaves off building,
as unable to finish it Luke 14.28.
. He engages in a warfare, without sitting down first, and consulting whether
he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty
thousand Verse 31.
. He begins like a fresh-water-souldier and ends like a coward. He is a
hot-spurre that tyres ere he come to the end of his journey, because he neither
considered the length of the way, nor the difficulties in it.

On the contrary, The true Christian casts up his costs, Differ.
and perils before hand.

He knows and considers, that, to be truly religious, is a business to which
nature (as now corrupted) is not only a stranger, but an enemy, because
Religion is an enemy to the out-leaps of nature; and never gives over the
pursuit of natures greatest delights, until it has taken them alive, and
slain them in the place where it took them, as Jehu did the sons of Amaziah
2 King. 10.14
. He therefore casts before hand, how far he can engage in this quarrel, and
what the issue may be.

He well understands, that if he will walk fully after Christ, he must take
up, and bear his Cross how heavy soever, and follow him Mat. 16.24.
, through thick and thin, through fire and water: and that, not once or
twice, but even daily Luke 9.23.
; that he must not only forsake all to follow Christ Mat. 19.27.
; but even hate his nearest and dearest relations when they hate and oppose
Christ: for, well he remembers that saying of his Lord Luke 14.26.
, If any man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and
Children, and Brethren, and Sisters; yea, and his own life also, he cannot be
my Disciple. Not to cast off duty to natural relations wherein God binds him to
honor them; but, so far to cast off their commands as they command things
contrary to Christ: and to hate them, as they seek to wrap him up in their sins
against Christ; sin being hateful wherever it be found.

Yea, he takes more into his consideration, than all this: for, he knows, he
must not only deny all relations, and his own life, but even himself also in
all his earthly enjoyments, Wisdom, Will, Hopes, Concernments, and Aims, and
whatever in the world is dearest to him, which to a natural man, is more than
life it self. He says, even in things most desired and prayed for, not my
will, but thine be done. He had rather suffer any torture, than not deny
himself for Christ, even when Christ seems most resolute to put him upon the
greatest hardships, the sharpest conflicts.

Every one makes a shift to hold on in Summer, while the peace of the Gospel
shines in full strength and brightness; so long, the hypocrite will keep his
rank and station. But the Christian keeps a good house in winter. He can keep a
Sabbath, without a Sabbath, and erect a Sanctuary in the wilderness Psalm.
63.1, 2.
. Out of the depths, he can call and cry Psalm. 130.1.
to his God, because he wisely considers how low God can cast him: and so, he
is semper Idem, ever the same in the greatest alterations, because he forecast
all this, when he first resolved to cast himself wholly upon God and Christ. He
enters into Christianity as into a Covenant of marriage seriously deliberated
before entry into it; and therefore resolves to forsake all, and to endure the
worst, rather than on his part to break that contract.

Thus, this hypocrite engages before he considers; and so, breaks his
engagement because of the evils which he considered not: the true Christian
considers before he engages; and so, makes good his engagement maugre all
the evils that can befall him: the one, by not casting his costs before hand,
goes not through with his work; the other, goes on, because he cast up before
he undertook the work, what it would cost him.

The Temporary takes Religion to farm.

He is willing to be dealing; but, he will first try a while, before he engage
too far. He will first take a lease for a time, before he bargain for a
freehold during life. Not that he does it out of deliberation as considering
what it may cost him: but, as having somewhat else in his eye which he cannot
well compass without adventuring for a while to take in this to farm, to
drive on his other design: and so, when after trial, be finds Religion either
too hard a bargain; or, that it will not contribute what he expected to his
private ends, he gives it up again. Therefore, when he finds his farm too
hot, and his bargain too hard, he lays the key under the door, goes his
way, and leaves his Lord to go look his rent.

Religion is his farm, not his freehold. He will be a Tenant at his own will,
not at his Lords. He will hold it no longer then himself pleases; and, throw
up all when he lists. At present, having need of Religion, (not for the good
of his soul, so much as for some present worldly advantage,) he must needs make
use of it; and therefore, courteth and embraces it with all the affection that
a lustful man endeavors to express to her whom he would corrupt and abuse. No
marvel then, if when his lust is served, or crossed, he throw off Religion,
because he either has his ends by it, or is absolutely left in an
impossibility of attaining them, or must give more for the accomplishing of
them, than Religion continued will (in his opinion) countervaile. No wonder
therefore, if when persecution arises because of the Word, he be by and by
offended; Mat. 13.21.
and, in time of such temptation, fall away Luke 8.13.
. The fiery trial seems a strange thing unto him 1 Pet. 4.12.
. It is that he never looked for, much less agreed for.

Differ.
On the Contrary, The true Christian takes Religion for his inheritance.

He considers before hand that the benefit of it will abundantly recompense
all the evils and inconveniences that attend it: and therefore strikes a
bargain for the fee-simple, as not only resolved, but prepared to run all
hazzards. He knows it to be a bargain worth the purchasing; he will therefore
sell all he has to purchase it Mat. 13.46.
, let it cost what it will. He resolves with David Ps. 119.11, 12.
, thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever, for they are the
rejoicing of my heart: I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes
always, even unto the end.

It is his freehold, his fee-simple; a purchase Rev. 3.18.
bought even of Christ himself, who has a good title, and will not deceive the
purchaser; but, though he sells dear in the opinion of a carnal heart: yet,
such a penny worth, as he that truly knows the worth of it, will part with all
that he has for it, rather than go without it. The world may look on it as an
hard bargain, but he knows it to be worth his money, and that he is made by it
for ever; and, should he let it go, he were undone.

Perhaps the true Christian had not this in his eye from the beginning.
Possibly, at first, he might not look so far into the bargain. But afterward,
as some Farmers thriving, at length prove purchasers, and become Freeholders;
so he, who, at his first taking up of Religion, seemed to differ little from
the Temporary, proves afterward a sincere and solid Christian, as the
Samaritans John 4.42.
, who begain to believe, upon the report of the woman, were afterward better
grounded upon the authority of Christ.

Thus, this hypocrite is as he that bought a piece of ground Luke 14.18.
, and afterward went to see it; the true Christian first sees and tryes it,
and then makes his purchase: the one, buys upon condition that it every way
answer his corupt ends; the other, makes an absolute bargain, as knowing it
to be worth more than he is, or can be worth without it.

The Temporary imbraceth Religion on temporary and transitory grounds.

Either he knows no better, he was born and bred up in, and has ever been
accustomed to religious exercises, and practices, and never was acquainted with
those grosser corruptions which are in the world through lust 2 Pet. 1.4.
. Authority countenanceth this Religion, and perhaps injoynes it, upon the
greatest penalty; as Asa 2 Chr. 15.12
, who made it death to any person whatsoever, man or woman, small or great,
that would not seek the Lord God of Israel. Thus Austin at first believed, for
the authority of the Church.

Or, he imbraceth Religion for novelty, because it is new, and broached at first
by some strange man and means. So the Jews entertained John and his Baptism,
when he first began to preach, and baptize Mat. 3.5.6.7.
; not so much out of a serious apprehension of the necessity of faith and
repentance, as to be in the fashion, when they saw that all accounted John as a
Prophet Mat. 21.26.
.

Or, he entertaineth Religion, with respect of persons Jam 2.1.
. His Ancestors friends, rich men, great men, that are in place, and can
prefer him, are of that profession: The Rulers are of that Religion. Were
there none but poor men, none but the meanest, the Vulgar, the outcasts, such
as Christ in his lowest condition; even he that could reverence John grown
popular, would not own Christ whom John preached, when despised and rejected of
men Jsa. 53.3.
, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. Then, will this hypocrite hide
his face from him; when others despise him, he esteems him not. He will not
stand alone, as Elias 1 King. 19.9
, no, not for God himself; nor, as Jeremy, contend with the whole earth, when
every man does curse him Jer. 15.10
.

Or, he receives Religion in opposition He is a Protestant, and that upon this
very reason that he will not be a Papist: and it may be a good reason for the
Negative. For, who would be of that Religion which turns Christ out of office
under pretense of honoring him, (as Herod that would worship him, yet meant to
slay him;) and, causes men to take him for no less then a Commissionated God
who exalts himself above God and all that is called God, and is the author,
or abettor of all the Traitors, parricides, and incendiaries of the world,
against all that oppose his horrid usurpaons? But he that has no more but
this, has but a negative Religion. He has reason to be no Papist; but this is
not reason sufficient to be a Protestant. These are good inducements to hate
Popery; but, weak grounds, when alone, to take up Religion. Many such
Protestants, if the stream and tide turn, quickly make as good Papists; as
sad experience shows.

All these and the like reasons make this hypocrite like a serpent, humi
repere, but to creep upon the ground, and so stretch himself at length to
receive the warmth of the Sun, whereas he will shortly creep into the dunghill,
and lie hid from the cold, when winter approaches. It is an earthen Religion;
or rather, Religion in an earthy heart, which is never converted into the
nature of that which is contained in it. It may be heated by it, as an earthen
vessel by fire put into it, but never assimilated into the nature of it, as
wood put to fire. He is an abortive fruit, born before his time, or rather
never born, but a perpetual conception without birth: for, in the time of
travail and trial, when he should be born and begin to live, he is stifled, and
sticks fast in the birth or place of the breaking forth of children Hos. 13.13.
.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true Christians grounds are heavenly and everlasting.

They are, as himself, an everlasting foundation Prove. 19 25.
. His foundation is in the holy mountains Psalm 87.1.
. He is built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ
himself being the chief corner stone Ephesians. 2.20.
, that tried stone that precious corner stone, that sure foundation Jsa. 28, 16.
; in whom all the building fitly framed together, grows unto an holy Temple
in the Lord Ephesians. 2.21.
. And so being heavenly by original, he is everlasting for continuance. For,

The Word of which he is begotten, is an immortal seed 1 Pet. 1, 23.
and the seed of God abides in him 1 John 3, 9.
: not as lying dead in a chest, but as taking root in good ground, and bringing
forth fruit unto everlasting life, some thirty-fold some sixty, and some an
hundred Mar. 4.20.
. And as he is begotten of the Word, so is he fed, nourished, and grows up
thereby 1 Pet. 2.2.
; that being able to build him up further, and to give him an inheritance among
all them which be sanctified. Acts. 20.32.
.

As for the World, he sets so light by that, that he, preferres Christ having
nothing of the world, before all things in it. He says to him as Peter,
whither shall we go? thou have the Words of eternal life. He says not, thou
have the wealth of the world, the honor and glory of the world; he knows the
contrary, and that unless he forsake all these actually, when they stand in
competition with Christ so that both cannot be enjoyed, he is no disciple for
Christ. Yea, and where there is no present occasion of actual relinquishing of
them, yet then they be forsaken in intention and resolution, as supposing there
may be an occasion actually to part with them, although none yet appear.

This takes away many rubs in the Christian race: for what can hinder him in
the pursuit of heaven that has cast the world behind his back? What can turn
him back, that is gotten above the world, and whatever is in it that may entice
and corrupt him? He is crucified to the world, and the world unto him Gal. 6.
. And what can work upon a crucified man? The grief of loss is prevented,
because the trouble is foreseen: and the danger of falling off is avoided, by
setting his heart upon treasure in Heaven.

Thus; this hypocrites religion is as the dew, which is but sudor terrae, the
earths cold-sweat, that is soon licked up, the true Christians Religion is as
rain from heaven, that sticks by the earth: the one, wets not a fleece; the
other, thoroughly waters the ground; the one, serves only for Snailes, Froggs,
and Grasshoppers; the other, soketh the root, and makes it to bring forth herbs
meet for them by whom it is dressed, and receaveth a blessing from God Heb. 6.7.
.

The Temporary entertaineth Religion for prosperity.

When Christ and Religion are in a triumphing posture, this hypocrite will take
branches of Palm trees, and go forth to meet him Joh. 12.13 s
; and with the multitude, cry Hosanna to the son of David, blessed is he that
comes in the Name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest Mat. 21.9.
. But if he once find Christ to be apprehended, and led away to the High
Priests Palace, and there to be spit on in his face and buffeted, he will with
Peter deny him; and say, I know not the man Mat. 26 72.
: and, if this will not do, he will bind it with cursing and swearing, that
once men may be satisfied that he is none of his company, So that, in this
respect also, all his goodness may be compared to the morning dew or cloud,
which is both a fruit, and a sign of fair weather, because the early dew of
grace in the Temporary; shows fair weather to have gone before, and betokens
drought to follow after. For,

He begins to profess Religion, when it is in credit and esteem, even with
those that care not for it; and when it goes well with the Church, and ill with
her enemies. Thus, many of the people of the Land became Jews Esth. 8.17.
even in Babylon, and in the Land of the Jews captivity, when they saw the
King favored them, and would not give them up as a prey to their enemies, but
rather encouraged all to protect them: Many such swallows and butterflies
there are, whenever the Church has good days, that will be sure to side
with her in her prosperity, although in her adversity none have more trampled
on her, or done her more mischief.

And as this hypocrite begins Religion when the Church is in prosperity, so he
takes it up only for prosperities sake, that he may share with her in it. If
any plague lie upon him, then he can collogue and flatter God, not only as
Pharaoh to get a judgment removed ( the Lord is righteous, and I and my people
are wicked Exodus 9.27.
; but even as the Jsraelites themselves, who, when God slew them, then they
sought him; and they returned and enquired early after God, and remembered that
God was their rock, and the most High God their Redeemer; nevertheless they
did but flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their
tongues; for, their heart was not right with him, Psa. 78.34, etc
etc. Even drunkards will assemble themselves for corn and wine, howling upon
their beds, but not crying unto God with their hearts Hos. 7.14.
; that is in sincerity as a people that resolve to take God for their God, let
him deal with them as he will; but only to serve their own tunes of him, even
while they rebel against him.

Contrarily, The true Christian receaveth the Gospel with affliction.

If the Gospel be in affliction, he will be partaker of the afflictions of the
Gospel according to the power of God 2 Timothy 1.8.
: not slacking his duty even when he suffers for it; but even then is more
forward in duty, as the Churches of Macedonia; who in a great trial of
affliction, and deep poverty showed forth the abundance of their joy, even unto
the riches of liberality 2 Cor. 8.2.
toward the relief of the Saints then under great straites and wants by reason
of persecution. Thus, he will receive the Word in much affliction, with joy of
the Holy Ghost 1 These. 1.6.
, although he no sooner receive light, but he be put to endure a great fight of
afflictions Heb. 10.32.
.

Or, if at present he be free from troubles and trials by reason of the Word,
yet he enters upon it with an eye upon and expectation of the cross and
persecution, which he knows that all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must
undergo and suffer 2 Timothy 3.12.
. He never took up Religion, but as resolving that some trouble would certainly
assault him in that way. It will hinder his wealth, ease, credit, or
advancement in the world. If no open enemy shall appear against him, yet he
cannot hope to escape an Ishmael Genesis 21.9.
, or a Michal 2 Samuel 6.16.
, to mock and despise him: yet he embraces Religion notwithstanding all this,
be the persecutors who, or what they will. If Princes speak against David, he
is not deterred from meditating in Gods Statutes Psalm. 119.23.
. If they persecute him without a cause, yet his heart stands in awe of the
Word, not of them that persecute; (because this is no more than he looked for,
when he first set his heart to embrace it;) but, of the Word persecuted,
because that is of God.

Thus, this hypocrite, takes up Religion not to honor God or Religion, but to
better himself by it; the true Christian takes it as in marriage, for richer
for poorer; for better for worse: the one, will gain by it, or cast it off:
the other, will stick to (...), although he loose all he has for it: the one,
takes leave of Religion, as ^rpah of her mother in law, when there was no
further hope of another husband Ruth. 1.12, 13, 14.
, the other says to Religion, as Ruth to Naomi, persuading her also to do the
like, entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee,
for whither thou go I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge, thy
people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou dyest will I die, and
there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but death
part thee and me ver. 16.17.
.

This hypocrite is best at first.

He is as a Pitcher, that is sooner a tree, than a graffe, but of less
continuance. He thrives mightily at first, with blossoms at least; but soon
withers in a scorching Summer. He has footing in the ground, but no firm
rooting. The Mould about him is ready to afford nourishment, but he wants an
honest heart to suck and draw it in. Therefore, he cannot hold out, but grows
every day more clung and withering, even in the richest soil. He is for this
cause also compared to the morning dew, because, as the ranker the dew, the
hotter the day, and the sooner the dew vanishes; so the greater show of
goodness appears in him, the sooner it is drunk up by the scorching Sun of
persecution.. And as a fair morning is oft-times a sign of a foul day: So
his early profession with so great a promise of continuance, is a sure
prognostic that he will alter before night.

In all experience, earlyest things are not the surest symptoms of future
perfection. Nimis propere minus prospere, says Bernard, too much have never
makes good speed. He is early up, but never the near. He is soon ripe, and as
soon rotten. The rainbow which in the evening is a sign of fair weather, in
the morning is a forerunner of rain. The have this hypocrite makes in the
morning, and his being so hot upon the spur, is a sure sign of his tyring
before night. A too forward Spring, is never the most fruitful year: the
sooner and fuller the buds and blossoms appear, the more apt to be nipt, and
fall off before the fruit be formed and hardened. It is ill trusting of young
beginners in profession, when over forward, and zealous; especially, if too
confident of their own resolutions, and boasting of them.

Naomi was as likely to have carried Orpah with her out of Moab into the land
of Judah Ruth. 1.7.
, as to have carried Ruth. Orpah, at the first, seemed as forward as Ruth,
surely we will return with thee unto thy people ver. 10.
. But yet, when she had wept, and wept again, at length she took the parting
kiss of her mother in law, and so departed from her. Thus this hypocrite makes
a great flourish at first and talks high, what he will do for Christ. I says
he, will follow thee whither soever thou go Mat. 8.19.
. But when he is told that it was worse with Christ in his outward condition,
than with foxes, and birds of the air, for that he had not of his own where to
lay his head ver. 20.
, we hear no more of this forward professor, he soon alters that resolution,
and has enough of such a profession. Thus overmuch fervency at first, is soon
at an end; and they that at first blame others as being too cold, prove
afterward frozen and dead themselves.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian is best at last.

He is not only engraffed, but rooted in Christ, and built up in him, and
stablished in the faith Col. 2.7.
. He is so planted in the house of the Lord, that he flourishes not only for a
time, but for continuance in the Courts of our God; He shall still bring forth
fruit in old age, and be ever fat and flourishing Ps. 92.13, 14.
. He is as the Angel of Thyatira, whose works at last, were more than the first
Rev. 2.19.
. He is as the morning light that shines more and more to the perfect day Pro.
4.18.
, because truly illightened by the Son of righteousness rising upon him with
saving in his wings Mal. 4.2.
.

There may be many clouds, and mists, and foggs in this day of grace, yet the
Sun breaks out again, and the glory of the Lord shines upon him afresh. And
albeit his light be neither clear nor dark, not day nor night, yet it shall
come to pass that at evening time it shall be light Zech. 14.6.7.
. His day is all fore-noon here, no afternoon: yea, it is not high-noone with
him in this life, until he come to heaven where he shall enjoy a perpetual
noontide, the Lord himself being his everlasting light Isa. 60.19.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a fiery metled horse, furiously running away with
h^ rider at first setting out, but proves a resty Jade long before the end of
his journey; the true Christian, although perhaps slow of pace at first,
patiently continues in weldoing, until he receive the end of his faith, the
salvation of his soul, the one, is as a flash of lightening, as soon gone as
come; the other, as a morning-starre that shines brightest at last.

This Hypocrites profession of godliness is with violence to himself.

The Temporary hypocrite is usually a man hot and fierce by nature, through the
predominancy of choler. This warmes and heates his affections before his
judgment be thoroughly informed and settled. And hence it is that he is rash and
heady in all his undertakings; and his passions all in flame before his
understanding be truly illightned. Quicquid vult valde vult. What ever he has
a mind to, he pursues with all his might; Right, or wrong makes no great odds
with him while he is in a carrere. And commonly he moves with more violence in
a wrong way (because that is more suitable to a corrupt heart,) than when he is
in the right, because his motion is never more eccentrick than when he moves
for God. He is then off the wheels, and drives heavily.

His Religion is taken up out of passion, as well as out of design to promote
his own ends wherein he is passionately violent: this makes his beginning more
swift, after the manner of violent motions, wherein men first run, beyond
reason, and then rest before they be at the end of the race, contrary to
reason. Forced grounds send forth fruit soonest, but it is but a sower kind of
grass that answers not expectation. It may please the eye in the shooting up,
but it will never satisfy for the cost, in the issue when it is grown. Who so
stern and strict as a Pharisee, he will fast twice a week, he will deny
himself not only of the comforts of life, but of the necessaries of nature, he
will whip himself till the blood come, and be so austere to his own body, as if
that were made to be only a slave, and himself were born to be the tyrant over
it. 1 Kin. 18.28.
Hence Baals Priests exceeded Elijah, in cutting and launcing themselves 1
Kings 18.28
, when Elijah spared himself. They were violent even unto madness, to support
the reputation of their Idol, while the Prophet with more calmness and
quietness asserted the honor of the true God.

But no violent thing is perpetual in nature, neither is any motion kindly that
exceeds moderation in grace. A Jehu may please and applaud himself in his
furious march to destroy the Idols of Ahab, to make way to his crown which he
thirsts after; but he will never please God, because his zeal against Baal,
made him forget his duty against Jeroboams Calves. And usually the greatest
hot-spurres in some particular duties, are the dullest spirits in the persuit
of some other as necessary (if not more than) that wherein they lay out so
much labor and fervor.

And he that offers violence to himself, will not fail to be harsh and violent
to others, as the Pharisees to the Disciples; not permitting them to rub an
ear of corn Mat. 12.1, 2
, without a charge of profaning the Sabbath, even when they were ready to
faint through hunger. Yea, this hypocrite is so seemingly zealous of the honor
of the Law, that rather than it should be made too common by permitting it to
the Vulgar, he takes from them the key of knowledge Luke 11.52
, shutting up the Kingdom of Heaven against men, neither going in himself, nor
suffering those that would enter, to go in Mat. 23.13
. This shows that the Temporary was never truly won to Christ, even in his
greatest heat for Christ, nor thoroughly (but only almost) persuaded with Japhet
to dwell in the tents of Sem, even while he seems to over-do Sem in some
outward services of devotion. For, if his own heart were truly softened, he
could not be so harsh, sour, and hard unto others.

On the contrary, the true Christian has his heart mollified, and made tender
by grace.

He is not as the sons of Zerviah, rough and boistrous, but mild, and sweet
of disposition to all, not out of affectation as Absalom, but out of grace as
David, whereby he boweth the hearts of all 2 Samuel 19.^
, not so much toward himself, as to a love of Religion. That Religion which is
pure, is also peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated James 3.1^
, and entreats others kindly, even where he might command. He that is truly
sanctified is kindly sweetened in his affection and conversation toward
others. True charity suffers long and is kind 1 Cor. 13.4
, and makes all in whom it is to be kindly affectioned one toward another
with brotherly love Romans 12.10
.

A strained zeal and forced show of piety makes a man froward, bitter, and
unpleasing in his carriage, because he takes up Religion against the hair, to
make use of it, not out of love and choice, but merely for his own ends and
necessity: and this being not suitable to his temper, it secretly vexes him
to be cumbred with that which is so unsuitable to his natural disposition of
mind and temper of body, which makes him to be untoward and crabbed where he
has to do. But the Christian is cast into a better mould, and the new creature
in him eats out all that natural frowardness and peevishness which he is
naturally subject to, and makes him of a Lion to become a Lamb: to be filled
with bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering
Col. 3.12
. He receives the engraffed Word with meekness James 1.21
, and therefore shows forth out of a good conversation, his works, with
meekness of wisdom James 3.13
. He is the better friend, neighbor, husband; and, in every relation, his
Religion makes him the better companion.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Esau an hairy man, rough and boistrous; the true
Christian, as Jacob, Smooth and plain-hearted: the one is as Ishmael, his hand
against every man; the other is as David that will show kindness to his
enemies, rather than exercise that cruelty which they might justly exspect.

This hypocrite cleaves to Gods party, but not as a part.

He joyneth himself unto the Church, adhereth unto professors, receives the
sap of doctrine, but alters the quality of it, and corrupts it by his own
evil heart, as bad stomachs corrupt the best meat, so that in stead of
nourishment, it serves only to feed bad humors. For the time, he has goods
things in him, yea great good things; and, in his own opinion, observes all
the Commandments from his youth Mar. 10.21.
: he is illightned, has a taste of the heavenly gift, is made partaker of the
Holy Ghost, in respect of common graces; he has tasted the good Word of God,
and the powers of the world to come Heb. 6.4, 5.
, as a man that goes to taste (not to drink) wine, and spits it out again.

He has not only shows of goodness (as the humiliation of Ahab,) but some
seeds thereof, which God himself sows, observes, and countenanceth, at least
so far as to maintain the reputation of his own outward ordinances and
service, to set an edge in his true servants, that they may not come short, but
exceed the righteousness of such seeming Saints, to get himself glory by
discovering of the heart, and to teach his people wisdom to discern, and to
beware of such mongrel Christians who can hardly be known from the truly godly.
Great things are found in him and done by him, if they were not corrupted by an
ill digestion, and turned into putrefaction by the vicious quality of the
ground wherein these seeds are sown.

But all being weighed by Gods balance are found to be too light to be good
indeed, that is, to purpose. His wishes are but slothful, his purposes shallow,
and according to the flesh, his vows, sudden and unadvised; He is like a
Sea-sick man, that is extreme sick, but not from the heart; and therefore soon
returns to his former temper so soon as he is off the water. He makes
advantage even of levity it self to help him forward in his hasty profession.
Seed cast into light shallow ground shoots up soonest. Those flashes of grace
that light upon this easy shallow temper, do not argue him to be sound at
heart, or a part of that body whereof Christ is the Head.

He is but an Accident, an Adherent, a Burre, an Excrement, as the Ivy or Moss
about the tree; not as a friend, but a secret enemy unto it. He seeks to be
reputed among the children, but is no more of them, then the Devil was when he
stood among the sons of God that came to present themselves before the Lord Job
1.6.
. He enter commons with them, but is not of their Communion. The Polipody grows
out of the moss or dust, but is not of the substance of the tree. The
Misciltoe takes sap from the tree, but not the nature of the tree; it has no
root of its own, yet is no part of the tree. He enters his name among Gods
people, but is not partaker of the Divine Nature. He is one of those of whom
the Apostle John says 1 John 2.19.
, they went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us,
they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out that they might
be made manifest that they were not of us. This hypocrite pretends and gives
out that he is not only one of the Saints, but so serviceable that they cannot
be without him; whereas he may well be spared without endangering of the body;
yea, to the great benefit of the body whereto he did adhere.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is a living member, and part of the true
body of Christ.

He is a member in particular, or, a member for his part 1 Cor. 12.27
. He not only tastes, but eats, drinks, and digesteth the true flesh and
blood of Christ John 6.53.
, and is partaker of the root and fatness of the true Olive Tree Romans 11.17.
. He lives by the true sap of grace drawn effectually from the root, not as a
sucker that consumes the sap to the prejudice of the tree, but as a branch
that bears fruit: and he grows up into him in all things from a right
inward principle of spiritual life derived to him from Christ, because partaker
of the divine nature 2 Pet. 1.4.
, not only in respect of receiving, but of digesting, and improving whatever he
receives from the Spirit of Christ. For, what he receives from Christ is not
put into a dead man's mouth, which may be forced to contain it a while, but
without benefit; but, he as a living member sucks and draws more and more from
Christ, as the branches of the Vine from the root; he corrupts it not in the
drawing, as the spider in taking in the best juice of the choicest flowers;
but, but incorporateth it into himself, and is transformed himself into it,
and bears a lively image of him that has created him unto good works.

He is so a part of Christ, that Christ can no more be without him, than he can
be without himself, the body cannot want the least member without deformity and
mutilation. The body of Christ is his fullness who fills all in all Ephesians.
1.23.
. How can he be empty whom Christ fills? How can Christ be full, if he want a
member? Christ-mystical is not a mained or imperfect body: nor can that be
perfect to which the least part pertaining to it is wanting.

Thus, this hypocrite cleaves to the body of Christ as snow fallen and frozen,
sticks to a tree; the true Christian cleaves to it as a living member,
receiving life, heat, and nourishment from him his Head: the one converts all
he receives from Christ into corruption, as a Cancer, or Wolf in the breast
turns all nourishment to the feeding of it self; the other improveth all that
Christ by his Spirit conveyeth to him, to become strong in the Lord and in the
power of his might; the one, takes in food not to nourish, but to weaken
nature; the other receives it to be strong in the grace Ephesians. 6.10.
, that is in Jesus Christ 2 Timothy 2, 1.
.

CHAP. XIX. The Preaching Hypocrite Is he that Preaches Christ, but not for
Christ. Defin.

WE Suppose him a Minister legally admitted, but not called of God Heb. 5.4.
. He pretends the service of Christ, but serves himself of Christ. Not zeal to
do good, but hunger, or lucre makes him an hanger on upon those in Gods House
that have power to admit him, to whom he croucheth for a piece of silver, and a
morcell of bread, and says, put me (I pray thee) into one of the Priests
Offices, that I may eat a piece of bread 1 Samuel 2.3
.

He is a perfect Balaamite, that will Divine for money Mic. 3.11.
: and it is all one to him whether he bless, or curse the people of God, as the
rewards of Divination Numb. 22.^
appear unto him for either purpose. He loves the wages better than the work,
although it be the wages of iniquity 2 Pet. 2.1^
. He will not teach without hire Mic. 3.11.
: and let him be hired, he shall teach any thing; even to lay a stumbling block
before the children of Israel, to profane the Lords day; yea, to commit
fornication, or any thing, Rev. 2.14.
by which himself may thrive by gratifying the lusts of those that employ him,
and will reward him.

He is a cunning Merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand Hos. 12.7.
. He will pollute God himself among his people Ezekiel. 13.19.
, (by using his name contrary to his will) for handfulls of barley, and for
pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, (by making sad the
hearts of the righteous whom the Lord has not made sad verse 22.
, in denouncing evil against them, and condemning the generation of the just),
and to save the souls alive which should not live, in strengthening the hands
of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him
life, even in a wicked way.

He is not for saving, but hunting of souls verse 18.
, and will not only lay pillowes already made to his hand by others; but, sow
pillowes to all arme-holes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature,
that is, study, preach, and write books to justify any abomination that
persons in power applaud and practice, rather than lose his preferment by not
upholding great men's courses how much soever decryed and condemned by God and
all good men. He is for his own profit, and through covetousness will he with
fained words make Merchandise 2 Pet. 2.3.
, of any that come in his way, even of the souls of men Rev. 18.13
; yea, of those very men whose lusts he serves. He can for a need, break any
Commandment, and teach men so Mat. 5.10.
: he will not only justify other men in their profanations of the Lord's Day,
by his own practice, but by his doctrine too; and be not only a spectator but a
countenancer of those that do the same, if thereby he may please those that are
above, how much soever God be dishonored and displeased.

Yea, sometimes very envy makes him to preach Christ Phil. 1.15.16
, in hope thereby to breed strife, between the people and those that preach
Christ of good will, hoping to add affliction to those who are in bonds for
the Gospel, and have more esteem and place in the hearts of men than himself.
There is a spirit within every man that lusts to envy James 4.5.
. This is too common in ambitious and contentious spirits that take up the
ministry for advantage sake, and resolve to cross and oppose all whom they
envy for their parts and acceptance.

Thus Jannes and Jambres the magicians of Pharaoh, withstood Moses 2 Timothy 3.8.
, when he began to grow more famous then themselves for miracles in Pharaohs
Court: so does this hypocrite resist the truth, being of a corrupt mind. If the
Devil furnish him with parts and opportunities, no man of eminency shall escape
his opposition and lash, even for maintaining those very truths which this
envious one once held and defended before the stream and tide of the times
ran against them.

He is a Preacher (perhaps) of righteousness, but a worker of iniquity. He
preaches Christ, but has no acquaintance with him; He never knew Christ, nor
was known of him. This is one of those many who (after all their preaching, and
prateing) shall endeavor at the last day, to scrape acquaintance with Christ,
and say, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy Name, etc Mat. 7, 22
? He thinks in his heart thus to say, and plead; and, in this opinion perhaps
he dies, without discovering this self-deceit while he lives and believes he
does well enough; even till he come to judgment, particular at least after
death. So that he bears not only the world, and the Church, but his own soul
in hand, that what he does will serve his turn even before Christ his Judge.
He professes to teach truth; he says, Lord, Lord, which argues some fervor
and zeal, as well as service. Yea, he has gifts too, perhaps more then
ordinary, even to the working of miracles and the casting out of Devils, if the
times require it, in thy Name have we cast out Devils, etc. but all this will
not serve in the day of Christ, whose answer will be a sad protestation, I
never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity Verse 23.
. He renounceth all acquaintance with him, passes an heavy sentence upon him,
as judging no better of him than of a worker of iniquity. For, indeed, such an
one is declared by Jeremiah to be no other but the staple of all profaneness
and hypocrisy, from whom profaneness goes forth into all the Land Jer. 23.15
. His wickedness is wickedness in the Watchtower that may endanger all. Such
an one may call himself the servant of Christ, for his better grace, but he
serves not the Lord Jesus, but his own belly, how many good and fair words
soever he uses to deceive the hearts of the simple Romans 16.18
. And one time or another, the Devil himself will disowne and reprove him
saying, Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye Acts 19.14
?

On the contrary, the true Minister of Christ, spends and is spent only for,
and upon the interest of Christ.

He not only preaches, but labors to adorn the Doctrine of God our Savior
in all things. And if Christ be preached, in truth, and sincerity, he has
enough. For his part, he looks not so on his own things, as on the things of
Jesus Christ. He not only speaks the things which become sound doctrine
Titus 2.1
, but is a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing uncorruptnesse, gravity,
sincerity, sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he that is of the
contrary part may be ashamed Verse 7, 8
. He will be an example to believers in word, and conversation, in charity, in
spirit, in faith, in purity 1 Timothy 4.12
, that in so doing he may both save himself, and them that hear him Verse 16
.

He is not only an Officer commissionated by Christ, but so waits on his
office, that he really serves God with his spirit in the Gospel of his Son
Romans 1 9
. He is careful not only of his parts and gifts to make him an able Minister of
the New Testament 2 Cor. 3.6
, but to receive a commission and calling from God, by man to exercise those
gifts which he has received, with hope of a blessing. He knows that as God
never sent message by the hand of a fool, so he never gives a blessing to their
labors who run before they be sent; and, that no man (who desires to be found
faithful) takes this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was
Aaron Heb. 5.4
. He looks upon the work of the Ministry as a distinct Office, which none but
such as are called of God unto it, can meddle withal, without high
presumption, and sinful usurpation, by which they do not edefie, but deceive
the hearts of the people. Never did any people thrive and grow in the grace and
knowledge of Jesus Christ; who, forsaking the public Assemblies, betook
themselves to such Usurpers and Impostors Acts 5.38
.

And albeit he will not teach for hire, nor Divine for money, as making that
the motive, much less the ground of undertaking the Ministry; yet, he believes
the labourer is worthy of his hire Luke 10.7 1 Timothy 5 18
, and that Christ never required him to go a warfare at any time at his own
cost 1 Cor. 9.7
; nor, to work with his hands Verse 6
, to give a free Gospel to those who are a constituted and established Church,
whatever he may do among unconverted Heathens not yet brought in to the
acknowledgement of Christ, and the profession of the Gospel. He knows that God
himself has ordained that they which preach the Gospel should live of the
Gospel Verse 14
; and, that charge is given to every one that is taught in the Word to
communicate to him that teaches him, in all good things Gal. 6.6.
. Therefore he fears not the unjust aspersions of earth-wormes, or sectaries,
that proclaim him an hireling, a Balaamite, because he takes maintenance; and
a legal Priest, because he takes tithes, for that he is well satisfied, that
among other Argumens by which the Apostle proved Christ himself to be a Priest
for ever after the order of Melchisedech, his receiving of tithes is one,
forasmuch as he receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives Heb. 7.8
. But his main aim is to approve himself to God in the matter he delivers as
also in his zeal, and practice.

Thus, this hypocrite preaches himself when he pretends most service to
Christ, the true Christian Minister preaches Christ sincerely, with denial of
himself. The one undertakes the work merely for the wages, the other takes the
wages set out by God, when he has done his work; the one cares not what
becomes of the sheep, so he may have the fleece; the other is more careful to
feed the flock, than himself.

The Preaching Hypocrite is very ambitious to show Learning, without learning.

He stands not so much upon solid and profitable matter, as to make show of his
own learning, therefore he pitcheth on such subjects as he is best verst in,
and that may occasion the bringing out of most of that stuff which he calls
learning, not that which is most needful and suitable to his Auditory. It is
below him to be setting milk before babes, he is altogether for strong meat
for men, although his meat be rather strong lines than strong food, borrowed of
his neighbor Luke 11.5, 6
, rather then of his own providing.

There is a kind of forced learning, or rather a show of it, which a smatterer
and mean Scholar, with some stock of wit, help of Books (especially of Indices)
Flores, Polyanthea's, Postils, and length of time set out upon the staule, when
with long turning of Books he has made up a rapsody of several sorts of
flowers (some no better then gayweeds,) which he calls a learned Sermon, not so
much for the solidity or depth of matter, as for the multitude of quotations of
Authors, on which (save upon this occasion) he never spent his time, or study.
Peradventure he never saw the Authors themselves, but took them upon trust,
from others who collected them to his hand. Yea, happily, he has taken all out
of a printed or written copy, and without variation, uttered it as his own: as
young shop keepers, having but small stock of their own, set out pictures of
wares in stead of parcels; or, as Apothecaries that paint the outsides of their
pots and boxes with names of drugges, that are not to be found within

And as Empericks bear out their reputation with their ignorant patients with
the force of strange words, and names, and terms of art, which neither their
patients nor themselves understand, so this hypocrite affects high-flown
expressions, exotic language, and obscure words by which he endeavors to sore
beyond the capacity of his auditory; desiring rather to be admired then
understood; and, to low-bell his hearers, rather than to edify. And having a
while thriven in this way of trade, he grows in confidence and Pride, to
censure and contemn his betters, as some of his stamp did Paul himself 2 Cor.
10.10
; in which course this Novice, being lifted up with pride falls into the
condemnation of the Devil 1 Timothy 3.6.
.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the faithful Minister is a Scribe instructed unto the Kingdom
of heaven, and brings forth out of his own treasure things new and old Mat.
13.52.
.

He is not a Novice, but rooted and built up in Christ, and so is better able
to build up others, as 1 Cor. 3.9.
a labourer together with God. He is more careful to store himself well with
the best wares than to hang them out at all times upon his stall. He is afraid
to seem; or to be seen by others, more than he is, least any man should think
of him above that which he sees, or hears him to be 2 Cor. 12.6.
. He is not ambitious, and therefore seeks not to raise an expectation, yet
humbly strives to go beyond it. He labors to be wise as well as learned, that
he may still teach the people knowledge Eccles. 12.9.
. He is not careless, under pretense of extraordinary inspired assistance, but
takes good heed, and by study searches out, and sets in order many Proverbs,
that is solid, wise, grave, experimented truths that become an able Minister of
the New Testament.

He affects no language made up of enticeing words of man's wisdom, yet he
seeks to find out acceptable words ver. 10.
that may edify. He will not be rude, loose, light, vain, frothy, in his
expressions, nor be rash with his mouth, nor let his heart be hasty to utter
any thing before God Eccles. 5.2.
. He is not for jerkes of wit, but whatever words he uses, are upright, even
words of truth; and so they are as goads and as nails fastened by this Master
of the Assembly, which are given from one Shepherd Eccles. 12.11
.

He disdaineth not the help of others, how able soever he be in himself; and
although much study be a weariness to the flesh ver. 12.
, yet he will study to show himself approved unto God, a work man that needs
not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth 2 Timothy 2.15.
; and albeit he would not have it taste too strongly of humane wit, yet he loves
to have it smell of the candle. He makes himself master of what he delivers,
and he cites with choice; not every thing, to bring in the name of an author,
or to fill up room, but such things as are pertinent, and not observed by
every Reader of his Author. What he cites he makes himself owner of, so as to
make it more useful and profitable than he found it. He not only reads the
Author himself (the means by which one man derives knowledge from another,)
but he also pondereth, judges, applies and so improveth what he borrows, to
his own purpose, thereby giving it as it were a new concoction, as it is said of
Virgil that he translated many things out of Homer, but made them all his own,
by clothing them in a new notion, and better habit.

Although he neglect no pains or care, no study, nor art; yet he endeavors
more that his Sermons may savor of judgment, piety, practice and conscience
than of wit or humane learning. He brings forth his old store (which is best
digested) as well as new: He will not be put to go to the Market for new, so
long as he has ought of the old wine (which is better) remaining: Not as
neglecting to lay in new provision, but as choosing rather to set forth that
upon which he has formerly bestowed most pains.

He affects not to be commended for making a learned Sermon, but is glad to
hear that it is profitable. He glories not in making up a Sermon in a few
days or hours, but is ready to make it out that he has studied for this all
his life: His Sermon was perhaps quickly framed when he went about it, as
Jacobs savoury meat was soon made for his Father, when his mother undertook it:
but the Kid, the materials was at hand, and well grown in the flock Genesis 27.9.
.

It were folly to say to a Joyner, you have made a Table in a day or two, that
I could not have done in a year. For, what marvail? He served an apprentiship
to the Trade; after that wrought journy-work for a good space together, has
his hand always in ure, his tools in readiness, and his timber cut out, and
at hand: whereas another man is to learn, and to borrow all. There is great
difference between a workman, and one that only now and then tryes an
experiment: for this man for the most part does magno conatu magnas nugas
edere, toils extremely to bring forth a bungled piece, and takes great pains
to no purpose.

A mean Scholar, with time, may make one of those learned Sermons which this
hypocrite is so proud of, and make show of much more than ever he was master
of. But a profitable popular Sermon well digested, and fit for edifying, is not
made without much more judgment and experience than this hypocrite ever
attained. For, these, to wit, judgment and experience, work an habit without
which one or a few picked Sermons will never make an expert Preacher, no more
then one learned speech will make an Orator. It is the property of Art to
conceal Art, when it is most exactly made use of; and, to make learning popular
and familiar is the most infallible demonstration of a learned man.

Thus, this hypocrite, like Simon Magus Act. 8.9,
, gives himself out to be some great one; the servant of Christ cries out, who
is sufficient for these things 2 Cor. 2.16.
? The one being an empty vessel, makes a greater noyce, and magnifieth himself
without cause; the other, being fully taught with learning and gifts of
edification dares not make himself of the number, or compare himself with those
that commend themselves 2 Cor. 10, 12
. The one boasts of a false gift, the other improveth a real ability, to the
glory of him that bestowed it. The one takes it to be below him to attend upon
Lambs, when himself has not in truth a sufficiency to feed them; the other
knows himself as much obliged by the great Shepherd, to feed the tender Lambs,
as the stronger sheep, and acknowledge himself a debtor even to the unwise as
well as to the wise Romans 1.14.
.

This hypocrite brings learning, but not the true, that is, divine.

The former Character pointed to him that pretended to learning; but had it
not, this, discovers what his is that in his kind, is learned. He has
learning, and that from God (for every good gift, wit, all arts and sciences
originally are from him Jam. 1.17.
, as wealth and honor Ps. 75.6, 7.
, bestowed on those who most abuse it,) but, not for Christ, to promote his
Gospel and Kingdom. It is like worldly wisdom, that though, as wisdom, it
came from God, yet as it used, it fights against him. It is a Cannon turned
against him that first furnished the present possessor with it. Without God no
man can have learning; but, for the most part, learning is so much abused, that
none suffer more from the learned, than God himself, because that when thereby
they come to have some knowledge of God, they glorify him not as God, neither
are thankful, but become vain in their imaginations, whereby their foolish
heart is darkened Romans 1.21.
. Christ has no enemies like those who have received from God most knowledge in
the brain, without true grace in the heart. He receives most wounds in the
house of his friends Zech. 13.6.
.

This hypocrites learning is not like that fire which came out from before the
Lord and consumed the burnt-offering and the fat, upon the Altar Lev. 9.24.
; but, like that of Nadab and Abihu, who offered strange fire before the Lord
which he commanded them not Lev. 10.1.
. Not fire from heaven, but from their own hearths. So this man brings
learning, but not that which is divine but only humane; that is, such as he
beholds not God in, but learnes it only of men, and makes use of it against
God, not for him, as it proves, at least in the sequel. It is not a learning
received from the Scriptures of God, but from Plato, Aristotle, Porphyry, and
others, enemies to the Scriptures, rather than teachers of them, or of the
truths contained in them.

If the matter be examined, what is it but Philosophy and vain deceit after the
tradition of men, and the rudiments of the World, not after God (k): or, Poetry
degenerated, which is but the excremental superfluity of a frothy wit, or,
Philology abused to make God to speak in the dialect of men, as if he spoke the
same Criticismes which, they who are his enemies, do most use and affect; or
(which is not much better) Schoole-Divinity of the third edition See Lamb. Dan.
Prolegom.
, wherein not only Scripture and Fathers, but Philosophers and Poets, have
their suffrages allowed them in matters of faith and manners contained in the
Scriptures; whereby that kind of learning also, for the most part, falls into
that common gulf of the depths of Satan, as they speak Sent. Petri. Lumbardi.
. And what can Philosophy do, to the converting of the heart? Poetry, to the
raising of the soul to heaven? Philology, to satisfy the conscience? or
Schoole-divinity to build a man up in divine faith? yet this hypocrite, like
one of Penelope's Wooers, (who being not able to corrupt the Lady, betook
themselves to her Hand-maides) seeks to humane Authors (the hand-maides to
divinity) to make out that, which in sacred Writ is not so clear, for his
purpose.

The manner of his proceeding is made up with more Art and exactness of method,
than becomes the simplicity of the Gospel. Much of Art, little of the Spirit,
life, and power of God appears in it. His preaching is more artificial than
spiritual. It may benefit such as have some grace already, or rather give them
occasion to benefit themselves more by making better use of that Art which he
abuses to ostentation. His artificial light has no warmth in it: it glisters
with a cold light, like that of the glow-worme, but burns not; like that of
the Baptist who was a burning as well as shining lamp. He teaches the ear
well, observing a measure that pleases sense, and makes men rather to look at
him with admiration, than upon themselves to conversion, but he keeps aloof
from the heart and conscience: whence it comes to pass that men exalt him, but
abase not themselves; yea, they think it a great argument of their own
sufficiency (never finding, by his preaching, any necessity of more goodness)
to be able to judge of his excellency, without any reflection upon their own
hearts or ways to reform them.

And as his matter is (for the most part) humane; and his manner, savouring
more of Art, than of God; so is the authority of what he delivers very small
and despicable, because but carnal: Moral, yea divine truths delivered merely,
or chiefly, or but in part recommended, upon the credit of Plato, Aristotle,
Seneca; yea, or of Hierom, Ambrose, Augustine; or other of the Fathers, become
but humane testimonies; and, suppose an humane authority to be a sufficient
ground of faith, so as all the faith wrought thereby is but humane, causing it
to consist in, and rely upon the wisdom of men, not the power and authority of
God, which that learned Apostle by all means endeavored to prevent 1 Cor. 2.5.
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the servant of Christ determines so to preach, as if he knew
nothing save Jesus Christ and him crucified.

He is learned, but shows no more learning in his preaching, but what he may
make a flarre to lead more directly unto Christ. He is no child in
understanding, but knows how to speak wisdom among them that are perfect ver.
6.
. yet to the weak, he can become as weak; not to nourish them in it, but to
apply milk to babes, gentle physic, to the sick, that of weak they may become
strong. He is jealous of the pride of his own heart, and very careful that his
speech and preaching (both for matter and manner) may not be with entising
words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. He
speaks of the things of God, without mingling chaffe-with the wheat Jer. 23.28.
, speaking them as the Oracles of God 1 Pet. 4.10.
; not with wisdom of words, lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none
effect 1 Cor. 1.17.
, by attributing that to his learning and parts, which none but Christ and his
death can effect. By this learning Paul desires to be tried, and esteemed, to
wit, by his knowledge in the mystery of Christ Ephesians. 3.4
. Even that learning, which not flesh and blood has revealed unto him, but the
Father which is in heaven Mat. 16.17.
.

Not that he despises humane learning, nor wholly lays it aside in his
preparations to preach the Gospel of Christ, but humbly uses it, and improveth
himself by it, the more to illustrate the truths of God when just occasion is
offered.

He looks upon it as a necessary furniture for a Minister wherein he is to be
before hand trained up, as Moses was in all the wisdom and learning of the
Egyptians Acts. 7.22
, the better to fit him for his after employment; and, as Paul, who excelled,
not only in all the learning of the Jews, but in all other humane learning,
even of Philosophers and Poets, the better to enable him to deal with all
sorts, when after called to be an Apostle to the Gentiles. And he makes use of
it (without boasting of it) to furnish him for his present study, to interpret,
and divide his Text, to couch and dispose his matter to more edification:
because he knows that God speaking to men, speaks after the manner of men;
to reasonable creatures, rationally; and, to those that speak by rule,
according to the rules of speech, if pertinent and necessary to convey what is
spoken to the understanding with more facility and benefit.

He well considers what excellent use not only Solomon, in his Proverbs; but
even a wiser and greater than Solomon, in his Parables, made even of humane
things and of the knowledge of them, by way of illustration, allusion,
insinuation, conviction of natural and carnal men who are sometimes more
silenced by reason, antiquity, authority of men, than by the Word of God, so as
to have their mouths stopped, when their hearts are not converted.

Thus, Paul cites Aratus to the Athenians; Act. 17.28
Menander, to the Corinthians 1 Cor. 15.33
and Epimaenides against the Cretians Tit. 1.12.
, the more to shame and condemn them: each of these being known Authors and
looked upon as classical, among those to whom he wrote.

And thus does he make use of authority without the Church, to convince
Infidels who acknowledge that authority, but not the true God: and, of
ecclesiastical authority, to confute Papists, who set more by the authority of
the Church, than of God himself in his Word. Not with intention, to ground
faith upon it, because all men are liars; they only excepted, who in delivering
the rule of faith, were in fallibly assisted by the Holy Ghost, as the
Prophets, and Apostles, but only, to defend the faith and the truth of the
Gospel against all gainsayers, who will not be judged by it.

He uses it as an handmaid to the truth of God; so long as she keeps
distance, without usurping the place of the Mistress, to obscure or abase the
wisdom of God in his Word, he is resolved that divine truth shall ever be
predominant, and have the honor of being Lady and foundation of our faith. He
will with David, lead the multitude to the house of God; but, being there they
shall all be taught of God, or from God: nothing shall be heard there as the
rule of faith or manners, but God himself, either in the Word, or in that which
leads to a more clear and distinct understanding of it: so as the Word in all
things may have the pre-eminence.

He will not read a Philosophy lecture out of the Pulpit, although happily he
may, by the way, tell us how far Philosophy may be useful in the subject
whereof he is treating (suppose it to be a discourse of the sweet influence of
the Pleiades, or bands of Orion, Job. 38.31.
etc.) to help us to understand the Text the better. He may in shooting an
arrow out of the Quiver of the Word take the feathers, and, perhaps the shaft,
from men, but, the steel head (as one Reynolds against Heart.
says) must be from God: else, it will not pierce the heart of the Kings
enemies Psalm. 45.
, whereby they may fall under him. It will never wound the Heretic, nor kill
the old man of sin.

Nor will he espouse humane learning to himself how beautiful soever she
appear, and how great soever his desire be to her, but on condition that, as
the Captive woman first shaved her head, and then pared her nails; before an
Israelite who had taken her in war, might take her to wife Deuteronomy. 21.1^.
; so all humane learning shall shave off all her wisdom that may oppose
Christ, and pare her nails that she act nothing against Christ, and submit her
self wholly to the obedience of Christ.

Thus, this hypocrite sets up Hagar to despise her Mistress and to usurp over
her, because in a carnal way more fruitful; the true servant of Christ when
once he perceives this, as Abraham, he turns Hagar and her brat out of door,
how grievous soever it be unto him: the one so uses humane learning that he
abuses it; the other uses it, as a true Christian does this world as not
abusing it: the one makes his learning no better than Achans babylonish garment
and wedg of gold that proved his ruin; the other improveth it as the
Israelites did their spoils of Egypt, for the service of the sanctuary.

This Hypocrite uses Divine Learning, unto humane and carnal ends.

As the godly Minister extracts honey out of weeds, and makes an holy use of
secular and profane literature; so this hypocrite, with a carnal spirit and
profane heart, polutes the holy things of God, and stains all that Word of God
which he lays his hand upon; dallying with words, mincing of Texts, playing
with Scripture, and darkening it with Allegorical, or other senses, refusing to
rest in the plain meaning which the words naturally afford, and the context
amply gives witness to. If he find not a knot in a Bull-rush, and discover not
some great difficulty in the plainest Text, he thinks it too low and mean a
subject to bestow his pains upon. If he keep to the plain-song of the text, and
seem zealous in the prosecution of it, yet his carnal heart has a base end in
it. Either he preaches Christ of contention, not sincerely Phil. 1 16.
, out of faction, emulation, opposition, envy, and strife, as the Adversaries
of Paul, to cry him down; taking more than ordinary pains not so much to make
Christ to shine, as to eclipse those they envy and emulate, where how good
soever the Sermon be, yet the end of the preacher makes his preaching evil, and
hypocritical; the Doctrine good, and, the Use, evil;

Or, he does it for vainglory, of lucre, making Merchandise of the Word of God
2 Cor. 2 17.
, for his own advantage, not for the benefit of the hearers; teaching his
Auditors to know not God and themselves, but his good parts; to admire him,
rather than to be bettered by him; and to show what he can do, rather then to
teach what they should do. Or he carries on the work of preaching as a Trade or
Occupation to which he was brought up, to get wealth by, and so he follows it
as a secular business, wherein his own ends and interests require him to be
diligent and industrous: for the people expect it, and must be satisfied: the
market must be served, he must take pains, because by this craft he has his
living Acts 19.25.
. Differ.


Contrariwise, the true servant of Christ handles the Word of Christ not
deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commends himself to every
man's conscience in the sight of God 2 Cor. 4.2.
.

He renounceth the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness; and
having the Word of God with him, he will speak it faithfully Jer. 23.28.
. He is so far from preaching it of contention, that he is content to be
opposed and vilified by those that do so; so Christ may be preached Phil. 1.17.
, and God honored in the propagation of the Gospel. Let who will abase him, by
striving to go beyond him in preaching, so Christ may be exalted by it, he
cares not how meanly others speak of the earthen vessel, so the excellency of
the power of God, may appear to be of God, and not of him 2 Cor. 4.7.
. And if others can do it better, although from a worse principle, while Christ
is preached, whether in pretense or in truth, therein he does rejoice and will
rejoice Phil. 1.18.
.

He is not of those who corrupt the Word of God, but as of sincerity, but as of
God, in the sight of God, speaks he in Christ 2 Cor. 2.17.
. He opens not a story to man, but his heart to the Lord. He resolves to be
made manifest unto God, and trusts also to be made manifest in the conscience
of his hearers 2 Cor. 5.11.
. He likes well that good works be visible, yet does it not to be seen; so he
is content learning shoud be used in his preaching, but makes it not his end
that it may appear. Opinion of diligence adds respect both to the matter, and
to the speaker; therefore he uses it, that men may not justly complain for
want of it; yet aims not at applause by it: Demosthenes would never speak to
the people without preparation, much less will he, to the people of God, in
the presence of Christ.

And so far is he from making preaching a secular employment, to get money by
it, that though he do preach the Gospel, he has nothing to glory of; for, he
looks upon it, as a necessity laid upon him by Christ, for higher ends and
uses; and, as being obnoxious to a we if he preach it not, whether he receive
pay or not 1 Cor. 4.16
. He will preach whatever his allowance from men be, expecting his reward from
God, with whom his work is, and for whom he works; and whatever he receives
from men (which he fears not to do, because God allows it him) he respects
it, not as the recompense of his work, or as that for which he works, but as
necessaries while he is employed in the Vineyard, in the work of his Lord.

Thus, this hypocrite makes use of learning and speech, as a thief does of a
pick-lock to open other men's Coffers; the servant of Christ uses it as a key
to open the soul, that the Word may find passage into the inner-man; the one
converts heaven into earth, the other raises earth up to heaven; the one
preaches Christ, but minds himself; the other, denies himself that he may
preach Christ sincerely.

The Preaching Hypocrite makes choice to speak of such subjects as may

He that seeks himself more than Christ, must please men, that he may find
what he seeks. Men-pleasing is sometimes a duty, when it is not with seeking a
man's own profit, but the profit of many that they may be saved 1 Cor. ^0.33
. Otherwise it is a base occupation; which shows plainly that he that pleases
men, is not the servant of Christ Gal. 1.10.
, even in the Lords service. He serves himself of men's corruptions, making his
avarice the Merchant to sell their souls, with fained words 2 Pet. 2.3. (...).
, to their own lusts, which will in the issue draw all to the Devil.

Fair words (we say) make fools feign, the way therefore to beguile unstable
souls, Col. 2.4. (...),
is, to be much in entising words; to speak, not to the judgment, but to the
fancy, not to the conscience, but to the appetite and corrupt palate of the
hearers. He is a right Prophet for Ahab, he will be sure to speak good to the
King 1 King. 22.13
, not that which proves so, but that which he loves to hear. If he will be
deceived there will be four hundred to one, to bid him go, and prosper Verse 6.
, because they knew his heart was set upon that engagement, especially in that
juncture of time when Jehoshaphat, a pious and puissant Prince, was ready to
engage with him.

Non been conducti vendant perjuria vates. Hirelings, ill chosen will sell
their lies at dear rates; as Ahabs Prophets sold theirs at the price of his
life. Where the Ruler hearkens to lies, all his servants will be wicked Prove.
29.12.
: They will sell their lies too dear, and their Master too cheap.

He speaks not in the nature of an Ambassador of Christ, but of a mercenary
Orator, who, to get benevolence, makes both his office and message a
prostitute to his Auditory. And if, as an Advocate, he plead hard as minding
the cause; yet it is not with that feeling as if himself were a party; but,
either for the fee, or for the victory, not of the cause, but of his Antagoniss.

On the contrary, Differ.
the faithful servant of Christ disclaimes men-pleasing as the forfeiture of
his Master Christ's livery and service.

He will please men in all things unto edification, but not to feed their
humor, or to fill his own purse. He makes not preaching a device to get money,
nor a bridge to fame, nor a bait to catch fools, but a wisdom to win souls.
He uses not a parcel of good words and fair speeches to entice and beguile
the simple, but speaks the Word in the evidence of the spirit to bind or loose
the conscience. And look what difference between a Prologue to a play, with his
populo ut placeret, and an Herald from a Prince proclaiming conditions of life
and death to mutining subjects, the same is between that hypocritical
Pulpit-man, and this faithful servant of Jesus Christ.

Should the Herald of Christ forget his Lords errand, pass over to the
enemies Camp, and curry favor with the Rebels? Nay, he will not say a
confederacy with them that this people say a confederacy Isai. 8.12.
? Nay he knows that it is required of every steward that he be found faithful 1
Cor. 4.2.
; and, to put a difference between the precious and the vile, that he may be as
Gods mouth, whereby they may return unto him, not he unto them Jer. 15.19.
.

If he be in bonds, yet, with blessed Paul, he asserteth the word, and speaks
it out confidently that the Word is not bound, even when himself suffers
trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds 2 Timothy 2.9.
. And therefore therewith he binds even Kings with chains, and their Nobles
with fetters of Iron Psalm. 149.8.
: insomuch that while he speaks at the Bar, he wrought on the Bench, so that
Felix tremblied Acts 24.25.
, Festus exclaimed Acts 26.24.
, and A grippa staggered Verse 28.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Ahabs flatterers that declared good unto the King
with one mouth 1 King. 22.13
; the true servant of Christ is like Micaiah that will by no entreaties be
persuaded to speak so, nor by any threats deterred from speaking what the Lord
shall say unto him Verse 14.
; the one is like the hungry Parasite emptying his book of phrases, that he
might fill his belly; the other is as the faithful and wise steward whom his
Lord makes Ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due
season Luke 12.42.
.

This Hypocrite affects doubtful and ambiguous expressions.

He would be thought to speak Oracles: and so he does, not for depth of
wisdom, but for ambiguity of language, like those among the Heathens of old,
that so his words may be interpreted either way. He will not expressly, or
absolutely condemn Popery, lest the times should alter; and he, be compelled to
eat his words. He will not declare himself too violently against any popular
vice, til he see whether the great ones will be offended at him for so doing.
And, as a Fencer, in favor of his Scholars, will sometimes smite over,
sometimes above, always beside them, but seldom or never right upon them; so
the preaching hypocrite will be very careful not to come too near the sore, or
the evil that attends it, especially if it be the sin of his honor, or of but
his worship.

In the City he declaimes against the sins of the Court, and Country; at the
Court, he cries out against Country, and City; but, seldom or never, against
the sins of the place wherein he preaches. With the Lap-wing he cries most and
loudest when farthest from the Nest. He is always flattering most, where he
exspects greatest gain: an easy task, at Athens to praise the Athenians; or,
to accuse the Lacedaemonians.

But such milk from the Nurse breeds no good blood in the child. Hence it
comes to pass that his hearers are neutral; and, for the most part, are
neither good flesh, nor good fish, as we say: Protestants, but once removed
from Papists; Professors, removed scarce one degree from the most profane;
possessed they are with a strange and uncouth zeal for their Linsie-Woolsie
Preacher; ready to commend him highly, and factiously; but, not able to show
wherein they are the better, or the wiser for him.

Differ.
Contrarily, the man of God speaks downright and plainly to the condition of
his present hearers.

He is not furious through passion, but zealous out of duty. He will not be
ambiguous, to save his own stake, but down right, to save other men's souls. In
absence he is more gentle, because no eyewitness: in presence, plain and
sharp, because evil doers cannot be hid, When he is remote from the Corinthians
he spares them 1 Cor. 7.28
, especially in difficult and doubtful cases: but he dares to call God to
record upon his soul, that, when he comes amongst them, he came not to spare
them 2 Cor. 1.23.
, therefore he professes plainly both to them which heretofore have sinned,
and to all others, that if he come again, he will not spare 2 Cor. 13.2.
.

He remembers that he is as Gods mouth, and therefore must speak plainly; not
the Devils, who delights in ambiguities that he may more effectually entise,
where he cannot force. He so divides the Word, that thereby also he may
difference the sheep from the goats, and distinguish between the precious and
the vile. Therefore, of loose hearers he is hated Amos 5.10
, because he testifies that their works are evil John 7.7
; and, their estates dangerous. He presses not only the letre, but the end,
power, and profit of the Scripture, to teach, to reprove, to correct, to
instruct in righteousness 2 Timothy 3.16
, to perfect his hearers in knowledge and holiness. He is able to appear and
to set himself and those poor of the sheep Zech. 11.11.
that wait upon him, in any contest against the proud goats that oppose,
saying, Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me Heb. 2.13.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is a Jugler, that you know not where to have him; the
servant of Christ is as Jacob, a plain man, that loves downright dealing: the
one flutters about the window, to be gone as far as he can from those before
him, the other flies in the very face of sin wherever he descries it: the one
plays with his work where he thinks seriousness would be distasteful; the
other is serious even where they who are greatest, and most concerned, are most
apt to frown upon him for his fidelity.

This hypocrite puts on a face of zeal, without zeal.

Toward others he seems very zealous, to move them; but, himself is not moved.
His zeal makes an hissing noise, but it burns not. It does not cate him up, as
Christ's zeal did him John. 2.17.
; but, rather licks up others, as fire does stubble. He is mighty hot toward
others, yet is but lukewarm himself Rev. 3.15.16
. His fire flames most at the Ovens-mouth, it heats not the Oven within. As
there is a form of godliness, so this man has a form of zeal, that makes a
show, and a great light, like an ignis fatuus, or fools fire, which never does
good, but harm; it leads out of the way, rather then guides men in it.

His zeal is either Heathenish, lighting his Torch at Seneca's fire, or other
Stoics, whose sentences being very acute, and pungent, serve his turn, as well
as if he had it from Paul: yea, better, for the zeal of Paul, David, or Christ,
would make him a Puritan. But all the zeal of Heathens was but a counterfeit
heat, that served to warm others; as a burning-glasse may set other things on
fire, without being it self fired. It never makes him, as it did the Baptist, a
burning as well as a shining lamp Joh. 5.35.
. It is enough to him, if others seem willing to rejoice in his light (as in
the light of the moon, which warms not) for a season, till he (who is but a
slimy slough, no true star in the hand of Christ) have his own ends upon them.

If he seem hot against sin, it is after the manner of Satyrists; either by the
way of Irrision, as Horace, whereby he causes laughter, rather than mourning
for sin; whereas laughter in the Church, is (as Chrysostom well,) fitter for
the devil to procure, than for the servant of Christ to occasion: or, he does
it by way of Insultation, as Persius; thus, diverse crow loud against Papists,
without bringing matter (whereof they might soon be stored) to confute them;
and, chide the world upon advantage, being secure not to be answered: or,
peradventure he does petere jugulum, fly at the throat, as Juvenal; but, it is
rather of the man, than of his sin; piercing some adversary with bitter scoffs,
or Sarcasmes, as Socrates, or Archil^cus sometimes did theirs.

Or, happily, he has only a Monkish zeal; which seems exstatical, but is
apocriphal, because he has read that Paul once could have wished himself
accursed from Christ, for the great zeal he had for his brethren and kinsmen
according to the flesh Romans 9.3.
, that they might come to the true acknowledgement of Christ, and be saved by
him; therefore, he will needs give out his wish, that all the sins of the
people may be set upon his account, and that their souls may be in his souls
stead: never considering how far from Paul's spirit he is, in becoming all
things to all men, that by all means he might save some 1 Cor. 9.22.
. He lights his Torch at Paul's fire, when he is abroad; but, soon puts it out
again, when Paul and he are parted; and he alone. He has theatrical fires,
that never burn in his own private hearth, or so much as smoke in his Chimny
at home. He would (if you believe him) have them saved, but he will never
spend, and be spent for them 2 Cor. 12.15
, especially when the more abundantly he loves, the less he is loved.

He may have a zeal by rote, not by heart. He may store himself with sundry
quick sayings of Fathers, or of the Scriptures, and be so earnest in the
delivery, as to put himself into a sweat all over, so as to need shifting: yet,
all this, without inward feeling in the heart, as duly affected with what he
delivers. He is a Tragedian; he speaks passionately, but without passion. All
his hot expressions are but his Minerva, the children of his brain, not the
fruit of the womb of his heart, which caused any strong pangs of soul in the
birth. He can lay wood together; and, happily, blow; but he administreth only
breath, not fire. If the hearer were before converted, he may profit by him;
but, seldom does this hypocrite convert the disobedient: sharp reproofs and
carnal glances do but anger a sinner, and nourish the sin, as cold water does a
fever: and, where good things be delivered without love to goodness, as they
come but from the lips, so they reach but to the ear.

He may, possibly, have some sudden feelings and affections, as Balaam, when he
wished to die the death of the righteous Number. 23.10.
: but, he never goes about it by living their life. He wishes himself as much
good as any man, but never takes the way to attain it. And, if they that hear,
be ready to wish themselves a share, Give me of this water Joh. 4.15.
, Lord give us evermore this bread Joh. 6.34.
; much more may he, that speaks and labors to set forth those things of
God with which the hearers are so taken: but yet all this is no permanent
expression, but a sudden flash that passes with the sound and action.

Some zeal he may have for the Church, (as Jehu for the Commonwealth:) not for
the spreading of the Gospel in the regions that formerly never had it, or for
advancing the spiritual growth of the Church in grace, and the enlarging of
Christ's Kingdom, as Paul 2 Cor. 10.16.
; but, for the temporal state, wealth, and pomp, of what he calls the Church;
to wit, the Clergy, that is, such as have gotten the best preferments of the
Church, of whom one, too truly, Non tu (...), Clear, (...) amas.
It Is wealth, not Christ, that thou, O Clergy, love
In this case and argument, he is very eloquent, he is as zealous for his
gain, as Micah for his gods Judge. 18.23, 24.
; especially, if in danger to be taken from him. He can plead more for the
garlic, onions, and fleshpots, than for Canaan it self. He can be pathetical
for the one, but has little to say for, but much against the other. He talks
high of the Church, Plut Sympos. lib. 4.
but never knew more than to eat the fat of it: Not unlike the Painter
Androcides, who taking upon him to describe the gulf of Scilla, painted
excellently the fishes that were in it, because himself loved fish; but, the
gulf it self, slightly and carelessely, because he never regarded it, save
only for the fish.

Differ.
Contrarily, the servant of Christ has zeal in his bosom, more than in his
tongue.

He is as Elijah, very zealous for the Lord 1 King. 19.10.
, not for himself; or his own interest. If he be constrained sometimes to keep
silence, because it is an evil time Amos. 5.12.
, yet the Word of the Lord, and the cause of God is like fire in his bones,
making him weary of forbearing, so that he cannot stay, whatever his going on
may cost him. He learnes not his zeal from counterfeits, nor takes his pattern
from men, but from Christ, as acted by the Spirit of Christ as well as
observing the acts of Christ. He reproves sin with sorrow for those whom he
reproves; and, with as much pity and compassion. His soul mourns in secret
Jer. 13.17.
for the sins he reproves; he bears his part in the burden of the common
sins, because he dwells in the midst of a people of polluted lips Isa. 6.5.
. He hewes the sin, as Samuel did Agag; but he spares the sinner repenting,
as Christ did the woman taken in adultery Joh. 8.11.
; and, whiles he kills the sin with the sword of the spirit, he raises up
the sinner with the spirit of meekness.

He professes no more than he can warrant for the good of his hearers. What
mercy himself has found he willingly sets forth to the height, for a pattern
to them which shall after believe on Christ to life everlasting 1 Timothy 1.16.
. The great things God has done for his soul Psalm. 66.16.
, he gladly publishes in the great Congregation to all that fear God. Nor is
he always in reprehension, and denouncing hell and damnation to the rebellious
and obstinate; but he is as much, yea more in setting forth the rich grace,
free love, and infinite mercy and bowels of God in Christ to poor sinners; the
one of these is but a work of necessity which he delights not in, the other is
the joy and rejoicing of his heart, wherein, were it not for the base lusts of
sinful men that sometimes divert him, he would ever be employed.

His zeal is in his heart more than in his head or tongue, and that makes him
many times to find and express more in the Pulpit then he brought thither; and
his spirit is stirred in him, as Paul's at Athens Acts 17.16
. Above all, he is first warmed, then warmeth others; his web of zeal is woven
wholly out of his own bowels fired by the Spirit of Christ. He first eats and
digests the Book, and then preaches it. He draws it first through his own
heart, and thereby is better skilled to cut out a way for it into the hearts of
others. He teaches nothing but he can write probatum est, upon it, because
himself has had experience of it. He first preaches to himself, then to
others, that he may not preach to others and himself become a castaway 1 Cor.
13.27
, but may save himself and those that hear him 1 Timothy 4.16
. He goes forth in the spirit and power of Elias to convert the disobedient to
the wisdom of just men Luke 1.17
. He has not only the tongue of the learned to speak unto others, but an ear
wakened to hear as the learned Isai. 50.4
. He first hears, and learneth, and then speaks. His fire is first kindled
within, then it breaks forth into a flame for the good of others.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is culinary, or from the Kitchen; that, of the
servant of Christ is fire from the sanctuary; the zeal of the one is like fire
at the mouth of the Oven, when there is none in the Oven it self, he is
tongue-zealous and heart cold; the others fire is most within; the zeal of the
one is furiously bitter and bitterly passionate, the zeal of the other is ever
accompanied with compassion, and a spirit of meekness; the zeal of the one
consumes others, the zeal of the other saves them and consumes himself.

This Hypocrite is a Preacher of Righteousness, but a worker of iniquity.

As is his zeal, so is his conversation: he is strict in rules, loose in
practice: yea, the more strict in the one, the more loose in the other, because
he neither cares, nor means to go that way himself, which he directs others
unto. He preaches as if he believed in earnest, but lives as if he preached
in jest; therefore though he be in profession a Preacher, yet he must needs be
in great part an Atheist. In preaching to others he divides himself from his
hearers, as not concerned in what he presses on them. He feeds others, as
the Bird her young ones, but forgets himself.

He binds heavy burdens on other men's shoulders grievous to be born, which
himself will not move with one of his fingers Mat. 23.4
. It Is no great pain to say, what others shall do; Therefore he can load
others, and lay on till their backs crack again; take it off, who will. He is a
Physician that will bind his patient, being loose himself; or, as a Cook,
cloyed with the sight and sent of meat that he cannot eat himself, yet for his
credits sake, he is careful to dress for others He is a Mercury that points
others the way which he never goes himself. He is one of those spies that
coasted Canaan for others, but never entered themselves. He thinks his office
is, to say; to others, it belongs to do, and strives more to be a good
preacher, then a good man.

Contrarily, the faithful Minister is afraid to preach, Differ.
what he endeavors not to practice.

He well understands that it is not enough to sit in Moses his chair,
unless he walk in his steps; nor, to say what others should do, unless he do
it himself; not, as a young beginner whose anything may serve the turn, but
as a Master Workman setting a pattern to oath s. Ordinary Righteousness,
Humility, Meekness will not serve for him, he must be an example to the flock;
and, should he do otherwise, he should not answer his calling, he should preach
to others, and himself become a castaway 1 Cor. 9.27
.

He rightly considers that a faithful Minister sustaineth a double person,
the one of a Speaker to his hearers; the other of an Hearer with them, even
while he speaks: and so looks to his duty as a Christian, as well as to his
office as a Minister. He does not hold it enough to be an hearer, but is
careful that he be not a forgetful hearer. He will be a doer of the work, that
he may be blessed in his deed James 1.25
. He will so speak, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the Law of
liberty James. 2.12
. He is for graces of adoption, as well as of edification. He knows, he may be
an Apostle, yet a Judas; but, cannot be a sincere Christian, unless he live
the life of Christ, and walk as he has walked 1 John 2.6
. He says to his hearers, as Caesar to his soldiers, venite, non ite; follow
me; not, go ye in the Van, I will come in the Rere. Himself will be in the
front, and bespeaks the rest, to be followers of him, as he is of Christ 1 Cor.
11.1
. He strives as much to be stored with Thummim, or sanctification, as with the
Vrim of light. He will have holiness as well as illumination. They were both
the portion of the Priest, and they shall be equally his care and study, both
shall be upon his heart Exodus 28.29
, and that continually: nor will he eat of the holy things allowed for his
livelihood, until furnished with both the former Ezra 2.63
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the Pharisee sitting in Moses chair, he says, but
does not Matthew. 23.3
: the sincere Minister is as Timothy, an example to believers 1 Timothy 4.12
; the one teaches others, but not himself Romans 2.21, 22
, the other teaches himself that he may the better teach others; the one
abhors Idols, but commits Sacrilege; the other, abhors Sacrilege,
because he teaches men to keep themselves from Idols 1 John 5.21
; the one confuteth by his life what he preaches, the other by his
conversation confirms all that he teaches.

This Hypocrite makes the way to Heaven as broad as he can, especially to
himself.

He that is crooked must have his clothes wider in some parts, to give scope
to the parts that are defective, as well as to hide his deformity. And a criple
requires more room to walk in, than he that makes straight paths for his feet
Heb. 12.13
, as not being lame. He that is a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God,
must maintain sensual recreations on the Lords day, and confute that
Puritan-tenet maintained by the gravest and most learned of all ages since
Christ left the earth ( Die Dominico, toto die Deo vacandum; the Sabbath is to
be spent only and wholly in the service of God). He that is for humane
inventions, must hold an indifferency in worship, and a lawfulness to impose
what man lists, under the notion of things indifferent. He that has a
profane heart, must uphold a liberty and use of petty oaths, especially of
such as custom and education never bogled at. If he have an heart exercised
with covetous practices, he will maintain usury, deceitfulness in trading,
any thing that brings in gain to be lawful. That he may uphold his own course,
he preaches peace to the wicked, and war to the righteous: like one that can
skill of Medicines, but mis-applyeth them. He gives strong wine, or water in a
feavour, and prescribes phlebotomy in a consumption. Gods children may
sometimes err in this kind, for want of experience, or better consideration,
as Jobs friends. But this hypocrite usually offends for want of conscience in
himself, and of compassion toward others He heals others slightly, because
he is sick of the same malady, and is loath to search to the quick at home, not
only for fear of smart, but out of love to his lusts.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the faithful Minister makes the way narrower to himself then to
his hearers.

Some smaller things, as Cards, Dice, etc. which upon a serious scanning, he
dares not absolutely to condemn as simply sinful in some others, he dares
conclude them to be unlawful to him. He will not be peremptory in things
doubtful, in reference to others, but rather leaves them to stand or fall to
their own Master Romans 14.14
; yea, though himself be satisfied touching the lawfulness or unlawfulness of
them: yet he is resolved to forbear them himself, how lawful soever, if others
take offense at his using of them 1 Cor. 8.13
. He will not, for meat, destroy the work of God Romans 14.20.
.

He will not teach duties which he means not to practice, nor mince them
because himself is deficient in them. He will not forbear teaching, because
himself fails in practice, but rather rowse up himself to the doing of what
he finds a necessity to teach. He will not therefore fail to display sins,
because he has no mind to forego them; but rather forsake them the sooner,
because he finds a necessity to cry aloud against them. He knows that more is
given to him than to others, and therefore more will be required. Peter must
love Christ more than others of lower rank and less experience of his power
and love. He must not only live as a Christian, but shine as a Minister. A
Christian must not take all the liberty that the best civilized and moral
Heathen does; nor, a Minister all that some Christians do. Therefore he winkes
at diverse things in others which he will not suffer in himself.

He remembers with holy trembling, who has said, I will be sanctified in them
that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified Lev. 10.3.
. Therefore he will glorify God in holiness, and not leave it to God (as the
hypocrite does) to glorify himself, in his confusion. He is Christ's Herald,
and resolves to deliver his message faithfully, although it should fall most
sharply upon himself; but, will be the more careful in his carriage, that he
may not fall into the greater condemnation. He is willing to let the Word have
a free passage, wherever it lights, because he knows it to be not only a
promptuary of graces unto well-doing, but an Armory of weapons against the
strongest corruptions; which he not only brandisheth, but really applies with
most vigor against those within himself, in hope thereby to get more strength
to resist evil, and to follow that which is good; praying for not only his
hearers, but for himself, Let thy Vrim and thy Thummim be upon thine holy one
Deuteronomy. 33.8.
, let thy Priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy Saints shout for
joy Ps. 132.9.
.

Thus, this Hypocrite imitates the old Serpent Genesis 3.
his father, in persuading that God is too strict in his commands; and that it
can be no danger but advantage, to take a little more liberty: the faithful
Minister of Christ dares not go beyond what he is allowed of God when put in
trust with the Gospel 1 These. 2.4.
. The one, having a club-foot, strives to make every shoe wide enough for
himself; the other keeps close to the Last of the Word, although his one foot
be pinched thereby: the one will take from his neighbors allowance to make his
own clothes wider: the other will rather straiten himself than wrong his
neighbors of his just allowance.

CHAP. XX. The Hearing Hypocrite Is he that hears the Word of Christ, without
acceptance, Defin.
or benefit.
HE is a daily hearer, a greedy frequenter of the Word in outward appearance.
He seeks Christ daily as delighting to know his ways. He asks of God the
Ordinances of justice, and takes delight in approaching to God Isa. 58.2.
, in his outward carriage among others who are better affected, and more
sincere; And having, with this show, pleased, and deluded others who could not
discern his inward hypocrisy, but judged of him by his outward carriage, he
pleases himself so well with his deceiving them, that he thinks he shall be
able at last to deceive Christ himself, even at the great Day: and intends to
plead (as a good plea) that Christ has prophesied in his streets Luke 13.26.
. and he has been an Hearer of him.

In the Word Christ speaks, as the Bridegroom to his Bride. This hypocrite
hears as one going out to meet the Bridegroom Mat. 25.1.
; taking this common rode-way to Christ that leads to him and to salvation,
and rejoices greatly to hear the Bride-groomes voice Joh. 3, 29.
; not as one that takes the right course to become his Bride; but, as an
attendant only, that waits for a Point, or Ribbond, without further hopes, or
aim. He presses to be as near the Bridegroom and Bride as he can; not so
much to partake with either, as to catch what he can from both. Let him but get
a Favor, to wear abroad, he has enough.

In this also he is as the stony ground, in hearing the Word, and with joy
receiving it Mat. 13.20.
; not into his heart, but into his ear, which it tickleth, but opens not, to
penetrate the heart. Herein he differs from the Profane. The Profane comes
not to the light Joh. 3.20.
because he knows full well that thereby he should be rebuked of all, and
judged of all 1 Cor. 14.24.
. An evil life makes an evil conscience; and, an evil conscience has Owls
eyes, that can endure none but Owle-light. The Profane hates the light, and
therefore shuns it; but, this hypocrite comes to it although he hate it as much
as the other. He comes, but, not in love to the Word, because he knows it
condemns him; yet he brooks it, and comes to it, because it condemns him
not openly, but in secret whispers to his conscience even when openly preached
to others as well as to himself; so as they who see the light, cannot discern
the voice as it more particularly concerns him in secret, in point of
application.

Hence, he hardens himself so far against reproof, as to be Sermon-proof. He
can hear any thing, but not with love: for, how can he love the light that
delights in darkness, and loves sin? All sin is from the heart, which no
sooner conceives it, but is infected by it with hatred of goodness, and
consequently with hatred of the Word the rule of goodness, until the guilt be
taken away by reconciliation, and the corruption by repentance. This makes his
sin the greater, to come for fashion to that Word that he hates, which argues
an whores forehead, that refuses to be ashamed Jer. 3.3.
.

But, what gets he by his hearing? Christ quickly descryes him and passes
sentence on him, as being but stony ground Mat. 13.13.
; as building his house upon the sands Mat. 7.25.
, and already declaring what the doom of such shall be, at the last day: I know
you not, depart from me all ye workers of iniquity Luke 13.27.
. Possibly he aiming at some present private worldly advantage, may attain
that, as other hypocrites have done in this world Mat. 6.2, 5, 16.
: but, no further and therefore are of all men most miserable 1 Cor. 15.19.
. His hearing may, and will add to his condemnation Joh. 12.48.
; but will contribute nothing to his salvation.

Differ.
Contrarily, the Christian hears Christ in the Word, and is so taught by him,
that his profiting appears to all.

He hears not only the Word of Christ, but Christ himself speaking in that
Word, and is taught not only by the Ministers of Christ, but by Christ himself,
as the truth is in Jesus Ephesians. 4.1.
. This is an apt Scholar that not only hearkeneth, but learneth, so as to give
account, to the credit of his Master, and to his own benefit. He gives himself
wholly to the things taught, that his profiting may appear to all 1 Timothy 4 15.
. He hearkens what God the Lord will say Psalm. 85.8.
, not what man will invent. When he comes to the Word, he beholds him that is
invisible; and whatever God speaks, that will he do. He looks upon man as Gods
conduit-pipe; but, upon God himself as the fountain of living water springing
up and issuing forth the water of life to his soul.

Thou have the words of eternal life, says he Joh. 6, 68.
(as well as Peter) unto Christ: therefore he will not stir from him. He
receives the Word which he hears from the Minister; not as the Word of man,
but (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which therefore effectually works in
him that so believes 1 These. 2.13.
. When he comes to the Word he knows he has to do not only with man whom he
may deceive, but with God that tries the heart, and will not be mocked: and
therefore as the faithful servant of Christ speaks, as of God, in the sight
of God; so, he hears Christ.

He comes to the Word not as to a lovely song of one that has a pleasant
voice, and can play well on an Instrument Ezekiel. 33.31
, nor takes his liberty to hear and not to do, as Ezekiels hearers did to him:
but he comes to it as Israel to Mount Sinai to receive a Law from Gods own
mouth, which he must obey, or perish. He looks upon it as that which shall
judge him in the last day Joh. 12 48.
. He goes to it as to Christ's Standard lifted up Isa. 11.10.
that all his Soldiers may resort to their colors: or, as to the Law of God
going out of Zion, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem Isa. 2.3.
. He gives himself up unto it as to a mould in which he is new cast, and
transformed into the fashion of it. He turns toward it, and follows it as
the Heliotrope or flower of the Sun, turns to, and follows the Sun. He is to
the Word what Jehoshaphat was to Ahab: every way the same with it, and engages
for it even to the peril of his life.

He frequenteth it out of love to the Law, as well as to partake the benefit of
the promises. He does not cast it behind his back as hating to be reformed, but
has it in his heart as his choycest treasure. He does not harden himself
against it, but is softened by it, as wax by the Sun. Nor is he a forgetful
hearer, but a doer of the work prescribed in it, and so is blessed in his deed
Jam. 1.25.
.

Thus* this hypocrite is as the people in Jeremiahs time that made great show
of much desire to be directed of God with promise to obey it whatever it should
be Jer 92 5.6,
; yet dissembled in their hearts ver. 20.
. The true Christian is as Ezekiel, that causes his belly to eat, and fills
his bowels with the roll that God gives him Ezekiel 3.3.
, although it make his belly bitter Rev. 10.9.
: the one hears it as the dictate of man, the other receives it as the Word
of God.

This Hypocrite will hear only such as suit with his own humors and

He pretends great love to hearing, but will hear none by his good will, but
such as rather stroke his lusts than strike through the loins of his
corruptions. If the Seers and Prophets be not for his turn, if they be
downright and plain against his sins, even this mock-hearer will say to the
Seers, see not; and to the Prophets, prophecy not us right things: speak unto
us smooth things, prophecy deceits; otherwise, away with such Preachers, and
preaching as will not comply; and, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from
before him Isa. 3.10, 11.
. If he be set upon voluptuousness, give him a Preacher that will prophecy of
wine and strong drink, although he walk in the spirit of falsehood, and lies
Mic. 2.11.
. He will not endure sound doctrine, but after his own lusts will heap to
himself teachers, having itching ears, turning them from the truth, unto
fables 2 Timothy 4.3, 4
. None but a Balaam will fit Balaack: none but a lying Prpohet will be
acceptable to Ahab.

And as there are many such hearers, so there are too many such Preachers, that
study to be popular; to please rather, than to profit: that will act Tertullus
much better than imitate Paul. Tuning their pipes to their Auditors key; and it
is hard to say, whether they have marred their hearers more than their hearers
have marred them. Curious, and voluptuous hearers must have obnoxious
Preachers, who must stand in awe of the hearers; and not be too bold lest they
hear of somewhat as bad, or worse done by themselves. They must be careful to
quit themselves well, by toothlesse preaching; because they speak at their
peril; not at theirs that hear them.

Nor is he wanting to pass his censures upon all the faithful servants of
Christ; one is not learned enough, another not eloquent, a third rigid, another
indiscreet. Thus he can play the Preacher himself, and reprove the Priest Hos.
4.4.
; seldom does he judge right of a Minister, his judgment being ever guided by
his lusts. I hate him, says Ahab for he does not prophecy good concerning me,
but evil 1 King. 22.8
.

On the Contrary, the true Christian hears any Preacher of Gods sending; and
the more faithful, the more acceptable.

He will hear what God the Lord will say, by whomsoever he speaks even when
truths come so near and close, as to cut and lance his bosom darling: he
would no more have Agag (his Master corruptions) spared, than those which he
least cares for. Tros Tyriuque sibi nullo discrimine agetur. Trojan and Tyrian
are both alike to him, and shall drink of the same cup. Whoever preaches
Christ, whether Paul, or others, makes no difference to him who has not the
faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons Jam. 2.1.
. if they preach so, so he believes 1 Cor. 15.11
. He will with Cornelius present himself to Peter as in the presence of God, to
hear all things that are commanded of God Act. 10 33.
. He hears not one in opposition to others, or as sleighting any faithful
Minister of Christ, but looks upon all as in commission from the Lord:
therefore, he receives all his servants, as the Galatians sometimes did Paul,
as so many Angels of God, yea even as Christ Jesus Gal. 4.14.
.

He looks not so much at the workman as at the work; honoring the man for his
works sake. He runs not after teachers by heaps, but wisely makes choice of
those who are most faithful in preaching sound words that cannot be condemned
Tit. 2.8.
. He judges not of the Word by the Preacher, but of the Preacher by the Word;
And as the mouth tastes meats, choosing that which is most wholesome, not
which is most toothsome; so does he; and therefore hears with fear and
trembling, because he looks upon it not as a vain Word, which little concerns
him, but as his life Deuteronomy. 32.47.
who ever brings it. He declines no truth that any servant of Christ offers:
only he searches the Scriptures daily to see how it is grounded. He will hear
his own Minister before others, if industrious and faithful: yet if opportunity
be offered, he will hear Timothy as well as Paul; Apollos, Cephas, any man
that works the work of the Lord 1 Cor. 16.10
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Ahab, who will hear four hundred false Prophets
before one true Prophet; the Christian is as Jehoshaphat that will hear one
Micaiah, before them all: the one has an itching ear which man must claw, the
other has an hearing ear which God has opened.

This hypocrite hears, but it is in hope to hear some new thing.

He is a newes-monger, he is very attentive to news. A new point, or device
that is rare, will chayn his ears to the Preachers lips. He is an
Athenian-Academick. He will be content to hear Paul (whom he accounts but a
babbler Act. 17.18.
if he bring any strange thing to his ears; Then he must needs know what those
things mean ver. 20.
. If any Preacher set a broach any new doctrine, he shall have hearers enough.
All Athens it self will go after him, as sometimes the Jews to the Baptist
Mat. 3.5.
. Any new Preacher is a welcome man, while new: afterward, when he grows
stale, though his matter be as quick and pungent as ever, his Auditory grows
lean and thin. When he sees the utmost of the Ministers parts, the Minister
shall see his back more often then his face.

This makes many forsake truth and hunger after fables, so they seem new. Their
stomachs will soon be quesie, which makes them desirous often to change the
Cook, in hope of some rarity from the next commer. The newest man is ever most
welcome to him, because now he hopes for new matter. Coleworts twice sodden are
nauseous. He cannot be of Paul's mind, that it is safe to hear the same things
again Phil. 3.1.
. If his Minister do preach or write so, away with him. As they that are
sweet-mouthed like nothing but new and lushious wine full of flatalent and
windy spirits, so this hypocrite being full, despises an honey comb Pro. 27.7.
; New Quelque chooses and new notions suit better with his palate, than
wholesome doctrine of more antiquity. He will never be of their mind who having
heard a good Sermon this day, desire even a Paul that the same words may be
again preached to them the next S^^bath Act. 13.42.
.

But, as there is no greater note of a foul stomach than to loath solid food,
and to pick sallets, or to feed upon ashes: so there is no surer sign of an
unsanctified heart, than not to relish a settled Ministry; or, to grow weary of
his own Pastor as if he had got all he can from him, and knows the best that
he can say or do. To have a Minister to become like a Comet that is much
observed for a while, (as people were willing to rejoice in John Baptists light
for a season Joh. 5.35.
). but, after a nine days wonder, to neglect him and grow weary of him, is a
dangerous symptom of a corrupt spirit;

Contrarily, the true hearer having once tasted the sincere milk of the Word,
desires, Differ.
where he begins, to end.

His palate is in frame; he desires no new wine, because he says the old is
better Luke 5.39.
The milk of his own nurse is most kindly and agrees best with him at all
times. He refuses not to hear any, where providence casts him: and he can
profit by any that are profitable: but, variety and novelty are not his choice:
his own Pastor is most natural and savory to him. He expects a blessing under
his Ministry, but cannot promise it to himself in a wandering, gaddy, gidding
course. He that affects a multitude of teachers, may please his palate (as a
glutton, with variety of dishes;) but will never thrive in his soul by variety
of Preachers. Therefore, he will not willingly go from Gods blessing into a
warmer Sun, nor leave him who in the name of Christ brings the words of
eternal life, unto him, lest he be turned away from the truth, and slip into
fables. Heb. 6.1.2.


He likes well the ordinary grounds of faith and repentance, and is never weary
of the Apostles Catechism. He has a good stomach to wholesome food, and can
always eat best of the same dish. Mannah is to him the same at forty years
end that it was the first day, and agrees every day better and better with him;
so that he says, out of judgment and experience, what they once did out of
ignorance or a jeere, Lord, evermore give us this bread Joh. 6.34.
. This is, to him, cibus dimensi sui, food convenient for him Prove. 30.8.
. He may possibly meet with some other pleasant and toothsome; but, none more
nourishing and truly comfortable or welcome.

Thus, this hypocrite in choice of matter is a child, and therefore can never
be in understanding a man: the true Christian never desires change where he
has once fared well, and therefore grows in grace, and in the knowledge of his
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ 2 Pet. 3.18.
: The one covets variety, the other contents himself with the sincere milk of
the Word, and thrives thereby. The one feeds upon novelty, and falls into a
consumption; the other is wholly for solidity, and thereby becomes fat and
wel-liking.

This hypocrite hearkens more after eloquence then substance.

As St. Augustine before his conversion confesses, that he heard St. Ambrose
more for his elegancy than for his divinity; so this hypocrite listeneth more
how comptly rather than how soundly the Preacher delivers himself. He
entertaines a Prophet but not in that name and nature; a Minister, as he is an
Apollos an eloquent man Act. 18.24.
, but not an Ambassador of Christ 2 Cor. 5.20.
. Flowers of theorick relish better upon his palate than Mannah from heaven. He
is a great admirer of the Ministers parts, if a master of language and happy
for elocution: but it is not so much for the grace of the Word in his lips, as
for the grace of his lips in a quaint delivery of that Word.

He makes no other use of his Minister than of a skilful Musician, he applauds
his voice and skill, but cares not much for the ditty. He looks on him to
tickle his ear, not to edify the heart. He hears him for his pleasure, and
credit that he has judgment to make so good a choice, but never regards any
real benefit by him to beget him unto Christ by the Gospel.

So that upon the whole matter, he hears in jest, till God set home his Word
in earnest, laying the axe to the root Mat. 3.1.
: and until he heweth him by his Prophets, and slays him with the words of
his mouth Hos. 6.5.
. It is ill jesting with such an edge-toole. For, as the Philistines sporting
with Sampson were at last slain by him, so this hypocrite serves the Word: he
must clip the locks of the Word, lest it be too strong for him; and the eyes of
it put out, lest it be to prying into his dark and black heart, and, play with
the Minister (as either delighting too much in his gifts, or laughing at his
infirmities;) but he will hereby bring an old house about his ears ere he be
aware, causing the Minister of life to become unto him a savor of death 2 Cor.
2.15.
.

On the contrary, the true Christian looks most at the power of God in the
Word heard.

He comes not to hear the words of a man, but the Word of God, as mighty
through God 2 Cor. 10.4
: as able to work in him what it requires of him; to be the Word of life, by
sanctifying him through the truth John 17.17
, and to make him clean through the Word spoken unto him John 15.3
. He comes not unto it as to a May Game to make him sport; but, as to the
Crown-Office, for a pardon. For, therein the Lord speaks peace unto his
people and Saints Psalm. 85.8
. It is the Word of reconciliation committed to Christ's Heralds, upon hearing
whereof he labors to be reconciled unto God, to this end he hears; and, by
such hearing attains this end.

He considers the Ministers Errand, not his Oratory; his Commission, not his
Rhetoric; his Office, not his Person (so Titled, so Qualified, or so
Friended); not his excellency of speech, but the usefulness of the matter, and
the efficacy of the Word upon his own heart. Yea, if through much infirmity of
the flesh, and temptation in the flesh, the Minister preach the Gospel
sincerely, he will not despise nor reject him, but receive him as an Angel of
God Gal. 4.13, 14
. He puts a difference between the treasure and the earthen vessel into which
it is put; between the excellency of the power of God, and the weakness of man
2 Cor. 4.7
. If a Pharisee sitting in Moses Chair, teach Moses his Law truly, he will do
as he says, but not as he does Matthew. 23.3
. If the matter be of God, he dares not refuse to hear it, because the man
pleases him not, but with meekness receives it, because it comes from him
who will save or condemn by it.

Thus, this hypocrite plays with the Word, for man's sake, but receives it not
for Gods sake; the sincere hearer trembles at the Word, because he finds God to
be in it indeed: the one falls down and worshippeth man for his oration, as the
people did Herod Acts 12.22
, as if it were rather the voice of a God than of a man; the true Christian
falls down and worshippeth God for giving such gifts unto man; the one feeds
greedily on the honeycomb which will never nourish him; the other eats the honey
that has not only sweetness, but strength in it, whereby he is nourished up
in the words of faith, and of good doctrine 1 Timothy 4.6
.

This Hypocrite will not hear all.

He will hear not only when, but what, he lists. Comforts are generally
liked, unless when restrained to such of whom he cannot hope to be one; but,
no reproves will down except they hover in generalities only; Promises, that
contain Privileges, are welcome; but Precepts, that enjoin duties, are not so
pleasing. If the Preacher touch his special sin, he is too busy; if he
restrain him from some unlawful or offensive liberty, he storms with
indignation, and pronounces of it; That Is but his private opinion; others are
of another mind: he is not bound to all he says, etc.

Tell him he must renounce inordinate pleasures, discard evil company, make
conscience to sanctify the Sabbath, etc. Tush says he, God is not so precise
or austere, the Preacher is too harsh, Professors are too riged, the light of
doctrine and example is too glaring; he needs a Curtain, a Veil, or an Huke.
No man ever heard a reproof, but he hated the reproover, if he love his sin.
If the sword be drawn, whetted, and brandished, if it pierce too deep to the
dividing of soul and spirit, of the joints and marrow, and lays open too much
of the thoughts and intents of the heart Heb. 4.12
, as the intrailes of an Anatomy: He is offended, and hates the light more,
either the Word must be but a wooden sword, or confined to the scabbard, or the
edge rebated, that it draw not blood.

But, if he cannot effect this, but he must hear the words of reproof, he will
either dissemble his opinion of the Preachers application of it, saying, he
meant not me; or, if it be in some smaller matter he regards it not, but puts
it off with a jest. If it be of concernment, and he must needs take it to
himself, he takes it as an injury done unto him to be so charged, not as a
fault committed by him. He assures you it proceeded from misinformation,
ill will, or a maligrant eye. Therefore he is angry in earnest, and says to,
or of his Minister, as Zipporah to Moses Exodus 4.25.
, thou art a blood, Minister unto me; and if he have opportunity, this
hypocrite is likely to prove a bloody hearer; an Herod, to John Baptist: plain
reproof puts an hypocrite out of his fence, and turns the Fox into a Wolf.

Contrarily, the Christian hearer, Differ.
hears whatever God speaks in his Word.

Reproof, correction, instruction in righteousness are as welcome to him, as
promises and privileges. He will not be his own carver, but gladly lets God
choose for him: and he is best pleased when the Word comes nearest, and
enters deepest into his heart. He likes not so well that neighbor who refused
to smite him; when desired 1 King. 20.35
, but rather says to his Minister (as he to another) smite me I pray thee; and
likes him best, that in smiting, wounds him ver. 37.
. He quarrelleth, not as Ahab, have thou found me, O mine enemy? Nor, as the
idle Scholar, commends him most, who takes least account of him; but is as the
wise child who likes that master best, who drives out the drone, and drives in
learning.

The wise Christian likes those words best which are as Goades and Nails
Eceles. ^2.11.
, driven to the head by the Masters of the Assemblies; and holds him to be the
best Surgeon that goes to the quick, that turns the inside outward, and
lays the conscience stark naked before God, and himself. He is glad his sin is
discovered so soon as it begins to move, and peep up, and followed as with Hue
and cry, to prevent Gods pursuit of it.

As he that going into a curious garden, is much taken with all he finds in it,
yet culleth out some one choice flower or herb, most desired, for his own use;
so the Christian in hearing likes well whatever savoureth of truth and
soberness, but carries home with him that which is most necessary in order to
his own particular state and condition. He is not for that preaching which is
intended to please all his humors, (as wares in a shop, to please all Chapmen)
but hops for benefit by that which displeases the worst. He conceives
comfort or hope, when the voice of Christ from heaven strikes him to the
ground, as sometimes it did Saul Act 9.4.
: for he is confident of this, that when men are cast down, there is a lifting
up; and, that God will save the humble person Job. 22.29.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as a pedling chapman that picks out a few wares to fit
his customers; the true Christian deals by wholesale, and buys up all. The
one takes exceptions to what he likes not, and throws it away as unworthy of
regard, because it suites not with some of his secret ways of sin; the other
esteems all Gods precepts concerning all things to be right, because he
hates every false way Ps. 119.128.
.

This Hypocrite looks on the Word as a Landscape.

He beholds it as a representation of the actions and ends of others, not his
own: as a story of other men, without application. He is content for
information, or out of curiosity, to behold, or hear the Tragedies of Cain,
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Saul, Judas, the rich glutton, etc. to understand
their stories, but not to receive instruction by them. He makes the Word as a
Spectacle, to see other things without him; or, a Perspective to discern things
a far off; or, as Merlins glass, to divine of state-matters.

He takes pleasure to see the world set forth in lively colors in the Map of
the Word, so there be nothing of him in particular to lay him open in his
colors. If there be, he draws a curtain before his own picture. He cares not
who be deciphered to the life, so he be concealed. He says to the Minister,
pursuing him too close, as Abner, to Asahel, following him 2 Samuel 2.22.
; turn thee aside from following me; Wherefore should I smite thee to the
ground? He is content to be an hearer, but one thing he is resolved upon, he
will not part with his lust, nor willingly hear ought against it; for who can
with patience hear any thing spoken against his most dearly beloved? Show him
as many pictures as you please, paint them as deformedly as you list, so you
let alone his, or draw it to his content.

On the Contrary, the true Christian looks into the Word as a glass. Differ.


He looks into the perfect Law of liberty Jam. 1.25.
, as into a mirror to behold and take a perfect view of himself from top to
toe. To that end, although he see many more pictures in it beside his own, yet
he looks most directly and fixedly upon his own, and but obliquely on others.
He considers with most care how the Law represents him unto himself. The
Law is spiritual, says he, what sees he in it concerning himself? this; I am
carnal, sold under sin Romans 7.14.
. He compares the Word and his own way together, by which he sees and bewailes
his wanderings; and knows more of his own sin by the Law ver. 7.
, than ever he could by other means discover.

This is David's direction to the young man that desires to cleanse, and better
his way; to take heed thereunto according to the Word Psalm. 119.9.
. That is the compass by which he must steer his course, if he mean to arrive
at the desired haven; as Saylors, that compare the Coast with their card, and
their course with the compass. This is David's own practice, as well as his
rule to others, thy Word have I hid in mine heart that I might not sin against
thee ver. 11.
. He is a way faring man traveling among many turnings and windings of cross
ways, and therefore makes diligent enquiry for the old paths, and the good
way, that he may walk therein Jer. 6.16
, as knowing it to be the wisdom of the prudent to understand his way Prove.
14.8.
.

Thus this hypocrite makes no better use of the Word, than idle boys do of
their books, gazing more on the pictures they find in them, then minding their
lessons; the true Christian improves all to his own proficiency in knowledge
and grace; The one looks on it with a direct aspect; the other with reflection
upon himself: the one looks on it no otherwise then a beast, merely to behold
it, the other as a man, to know it for himself.

This hypocrite hears, but without preparing his heart to hear.

He is as careless of the manner of hearing, as he is humorously careful of
the matter which he hears. He will hear nothing but what suits with his
humor, and that he hears as best pleases himself. When he has drawn the
speaker to prophecy to him those things only, which may please his Palate and
not offend his lust, in what he hears Mark. 4.24.
, let him alone for the manner, how he hears Luke 8.18.
. Whereas this is of as great concernment, as to his concernment, as the former
Physic; through carelessenesse abused, will never work a cure.

He comes indeed to the house of God, but without looking to his feet Eccles.
5.1.
. He has ears, but they are deaf: his ear is not boared, nor wakened, to
hear as the learned Isa. 50.4.
. He goes to a Sermon, no otherwise then he goes to a Play; whether from bed,
from board, from game, from Brothel-house, it matters not. If his clothes be
handsome, and such as may draw the eyes of others to gaze on him with applause,
he takes no care for the heart, (when the very Word that he is to hear is
matter of life Deuteronomy. 32.47.
or death; 2 Cor 2.16.
Will any man come so to the bar to receive his sentence?

He comes without prayer, repentance, faith, sense of his wants, or of any
Ordinance of God to which he comes, much less of Gods own presence in it. And
whereas a wise man will not eat without appetite, which if he want he will use
exercise, thereby to stir up natural heat to enable the stomach both to crave
and digest meat with more benefit and contentment; this man comes without a
stomach to wholesome food, and without any exercising of himself unto
godliness, and so for want of this care, surfeits on the Word not by taking
too much (for a small pittance serves his turn;) but by being unable to digest
the least morsel, through want of exercising of himself unto godliness.

The prudent Husbandman will not sow without plowing and harrowing too, where
he finds weeds or briars: but this hypocrite being foolhardy, fears not to
sow among the thorns. He comes merely upon his own account, and in his own
might (by which no man shall prevail. 1 Samuel 2.9.
) He is confident that, although he pray not before hearing, yet he will carry
away as much of the Sermon as he that prays: But it is as an horse that
carries a burden, which may break his back, but will be of no benefit to him:
Or, he carries the Sermon, as Vriah did David's Letters, to his own c^nfusion.

His ear may hear, but as a man hears a noise in the street, which he
passes over as not concerning himself; his understanding may be employed, but
not his affection; or his affection may be moved, but his conscience not
awakened. The first is as mastication or chewing of meat in the mouth, without
swallowing it down; The second is as the first concoction making it a Chylus
but not furnishing the liver; the third is as the digestion of a feavourish
man, whose liver may possibly be in good temper, but his heart much
distempered; and so no pure spirits, no clean life can be expected, be the food
what it will.

Contrarily, the true Christian is as careful of his preparation for hearing,
Differ.
as he is of the Word which he hears.

He dares not come to a Sermon, to the reading of the Word, but he prays,
open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things of thy Law Psalm. 119.18.
. He ploweth up the fallow ground, before the seed be cast in, and he will not
sow among thorns Jer. 4.3.
. He looks upon hearing as hard and difficult, to hear with profit, and
therefore is careful to wash his hands in innocence, before he compass Gods
Altar Psalm. 26.6.
. He is careful to purge not only his ears but his heart and conscience; from
all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness Jam. ^^.1.
, with all malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy, and evil speaking 1 Pet. 2.1.
, that he may with meekness receive the ingraffed Word; that is, so receive
that it may be ingraffed into him and he into it; that as a new born babe he
may desire, hunger. long for the sincere milk of the Word, that so he may
receive and digest it with more profit, that he may grow up thereby, and that
it may be able to save his soul.

He stirs up, not his natural, but heavenly Spirits, the Spirit of faith, love,
zeal, and renueth and sharpeneth his spiritual Palate, that he may the better
taste how gracious the Lord is to his soul in the Word spoken to him. He desires
that his ear may so be opened as to hear Christ himself in the Word, that he
may be taught by him as the truth is in Jesus Ephesians 4.20, 2^
. And that God would teach him wisdom in the most inmost secrets of his soul.
He brings conscience and affections with him to the Word. That the Word may
work upon the whole soul, the whole man with more efficacy and advantage.

Thus, this hypocrite comes to the Word without an heart, and so does but only
v e w; but not receive the Word; the Christian seeks God with his whholeheart
and so finds God in his Word: the one offers up the sacrifice of a fool, that
knows not what evil he does, the other looks to his feet with more care so
often as he enters the house of God, and so offers up a spiritual sacrifice
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

This hypocrites end in hearing is only to hear for the time present.

As he is a sinful respecter of persons whom he hears, humurous for the
matter, manner; So is he as corrupt in the ends of his hearing. His hearing
expires with the Preachers speaking, he minds it no longer: when he is at the
end of the Sermon, there is an end of his care of what he has heard. He went
not to better, but to entertain himself; he is content the Ministers doctrine
should a drop as the rain, and that the Word should distill as the dew Deuteronomy
32.2.
, but it shall be only upon the superficies, or outward surface of the ear, as
the dew upon the tops of the grass, which easily dissolves, or is dried up, or
licked off; it sinkes not down into the inward care Luke 9.44.
, but only, as a sound, strikes upon it, and then vanishes; it goes not to the
root. The Word heard profits him not, nor did he hear that he might profit by
it.

He may perhaps have a spiritual Bulimy or dog like-appetite that makes him to
devour (or rather to seem to ingurgitate) much, but it does him no good at all.
What he eats and drinks at Church, he casts up again at the Church door, or
in the very Pew wherein he hearerh. It makes him sick as it did Felix Act. 24
25.
; it comfort him not, as it did David Psalm. 119.50.
. The Word flasheth in upon him like a flash of lightening, and is as welcome
to him, especiaily when it comes so near as to give him a glimpse of his
conscience, which he as immediately (in the twinkling of an eye) forgets, and
is willing so to do; as he that looks in a glass forgets the fashion of his
face Jam. 1.24.
. He is much in hearing, but allows himself no time to meditate and digest,
much less to practice what he hears, or to come to the knowledge of the
truth 2 Timothy 3.7.
. This is no better then a riot in hearing, which increases bad humors; but
never breeds good blood: it causes a surfeit, but nourishes not.

He hears; but, ask him what he has heard, and he can scarce tell you any
thing, at least any thing that he is the better for, he has no relish of his
meat, therefore cares not for it, even when he would have you to think he
eats. The Word of life has no savor in it upon his Palate; he has no
feeling of comforts, is not terrified by threatenings. He opens his ear, but
hears not, because his heart is still shut against the Word: therefore he
never tastes how gracious the Lord is 1 Pet. 2.3.
, nor how much good the Word does to those that walk uprightly Mica. 2.7.
: for, let both be what they will to an hungry soul, he never minds it.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian will not only hearken for the present, but
hear for the time to come Isa. 42.23.
.

He considers not only what, but how he hears; and propounds to himself a
further end then only to hear. He not only looks into the perfect Law of
liberty; but continues therein, and thereby becomes, not a forgetful hearer,
but a doer of the work, which was his aim; and therefore is blessed in his
deed Sam. 1.25.
. He hears to do: he not only looks in the glass of the Word, but he is
all day a dressing, somewhat he finds continually that needs mending,
something to be added, that the Physnomy of Grace may be perfected; not with
painting, but with a constant endeavor to put all into better order, to amend
the constitution of the inward man, as well as the complexion without.

He lets not this Manna to lie upon the grass, without gathering till it
dissolve and melt to nothing, but he puts it into the best vessel he has, even
into his heart, he suffers the rain to soak into his root, that it may bring
forth fruits of increase. He will not let the water of life to run wast, but
brings his bucket or pitcher to draw water out of the wells of salvation Isa.
12.3.
, and will be sure to fill his Cesterne with it. He never goes to the Word, but
he is always careful to bring home something for the good of his own soul, and
for the benefit of others also to whom he is related, as the bird to her young
ones, when she goes abroad for provision.

He adds to his (...) an (...) to his simple knowledge, application, which
brings knowledge to conscience, and conscience to practice. He hears to
know, and knows to believe, and obey: To know God, in Christ, to trust in
him; in his benefits, to be thankful in his commandments, to be obedient; in
his graces, to improve them; in his quarrels, to take them up. Yea, he hears
so, that there may be in him not only (...), but (...), Phil. 1.9.
, a sensible experimental knowledge of God in Christ, that not only his ear,
but all his senses to wit, the whole soul may be actually exercised to discern
both good and evil Heb. 5.14. (...)
.

Every man that is a Scholar, may be able to prove by reason, argument, and
testimony that faith only justifies; but, only the experienced Christian
finds it to be true indeed. He only can say, I have tried both, and find
comfort only in the doctrine of faith. The good hearer therefore hears that
he may have a feeling of what he hears, and a taste of the sweetness of God
that speaks, and is thereby incited to desire more of the sincere milk of the
Word 1 Pet. 2.2.
. He never hears Sermon, but he feels the virtue and Power of Christ,
burning in him Luke 24.32.
, discovering the thoughts and secrets of his soul 1 Cor. 14 25
, and more and more transforming him into the image of Christ who speaks to
him.

Thus, this hypocrite comes to the Word, as many of the Ephesians came together
at the Oration of Demetrius, not knowing wherefore they were come together Act.
19.32.
; The true hearer is as Cornelius and his company (when he desired to hear
Peter) al present before God, to hear all things that should be commanded the
Preacher, of God Act. 10.33.
. The one hears to no end, but that he may be thought to be an hearer: the
other propounds faith and obedience as the end of his hearing: the one is like
unto a man beholding his face in a glass, and then going his way, and
straightway forgets what manner of man he was Jam. 1.24.
; the other as he that never looks off the glass, and so has perpetually in
his eye a true representation of himself.

This hypocrite, if he propound to himself any end in hearing, it is carnal.

This hearer being himself carnal propounds ends suitable to his
constitution; He hears, it may be; but, it is either for gaining of applause
for his diligence, to become a good Churchman: the Bell no sooner tolls, but
he is presently there: or out of faction to prefer Apollos before Cephas; or
out of malice, to watch for iniquity, that is for some advantage against the
Preacher, and to make him a transgressor for a Word, and to lay a snare for him
that reproves in the gate Isa. 29.21.
; to carp, censure, cavil and to entangle him, laying wait for him, and seeking
to catch something out of his mouth, thereby to accuse him Luke 11.54.
; or, to spend time: the market, or the dancing begins not, good-fellows meet
not, till the Sermon be done. Or, to keep his seat, or to take away, (stolen
sleep is sweet, especially when stolen from God:) or, to outface the Word; to
go to the water, and not drink; to go into the Sun, without fear of being
burnt; as Caesar, resolved not to be moved with Tullyes Oratory; to be
Sermon-proof; or, to gratify a friend whom he respects as Ahab was content
to hear Micaiah for Jehoshaphats sake; and, Felix to hear Paul, to please
Drusilla; and, Festus, to content Agrippa: or, to furnish himself with
discourse and arguments: with many other windings and extravagancies, which the
Lord will one day find out, and record among the sacrifices of fools Eccles.
5.1.
.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true hearer hears only for edification both of himself and otehrs.

He hears that he may get knowledge: not that he may only know, which is but
curiosity; or, be known, which is vanity; but that he may be edified, which is
wisdom; and edify others which is charity. The spirit of new life is in him a
vegetative soul, intending nothing more or less, than to grow up by the Word 1
Pet. 2.2.
, he hears; and to be built up further that he may receive an inheritance
among all them which are sactified Act. 20.32,
. He comes to it, as to his appointed food, not as to a Banquet of sweet
meats; that may be missed without prejudice: he looks upon it as his daily
bread without which he cannot live. He lays it up not for discourse or
ornament, but for use; not for ostentation, but for sanctification; not for the
man's sake that brings it, but for the matter which he brings; not to entrap the
Minister, but to deliver himself out of the snares of the Devil. Not to spend
time, but to redeem it; not to sleep, but to watch and pray: not to show how
many bullets and thunderclaps he can bear, without piercing; but, to get his
heart softened and changed.

Thus, this hypocrite hears the Word, as those Israelites which gathered
Manna not for use, but to try conclusions, and then it bred worms and stank
Exodus 16.20.
: the Christian-hearer is as they who gathered and reserved Manna for use on
the Sabbath, in which case it stank not, neither was there any worm therein
ver. 24.
. The one poysoneth himself by over-charging his stomach with good meat to make
experiments; the other thrives by all that he takes in upon his single design
of growing thereby

This hypocrite sometimes pretends practice as an excuse for not hearing.

This head of the hearing hypocrite, contains under it many sorts of
hypocritical hearers: some seem very zealous of hearing, yet truly and savingly
hear not: others are as much against frequent hearing under color of being
very busy to learn and practice what they heard before. We must practice one
lesson says he, before we take out another; these frequent hearers are in his
opinion, but dull practisers. Therefore he thinks one reason of their slow
practice is their over-charging themselves with hearing: and, a sufficient plea
for him to hear but seldom. One Sermon in a week is well: nay, one in a
month, or in a quarter of a year (he would, if it were not for shame, add, in
a year) is more then he can learn and practice well [and, in this you may
believe him:] which is as much as to say, a child should learn but one letter
at once throughout the whole book; or but one word first, throughout all
Authors before he set himself to learn any other; Socrat. lib. 4. cap. 18.
or that every one should be like Pambo [in the ecclesiastical history] who
desiring to be taught the thirty nine Psalm, after he had heard the first
verse thereof [I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
tongue] bad his teacher to hold there: this one verse, says he, is enough at
once to learn; and he was so long a learning that [even above nineteen yeares]
that he never went further, and so he remained (...). an illiterate Dunce as
that Hystorian terms him.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true hearer makes practice and hearing to go hand in hand
together.

He is careful to practice what he hears, but does not upon that ground that
he cannot perfectly practice it, forbear to hear frequently, but rather hears
more often, that he may be better instructed, and more effectually stirred up
to practice better; He finds exercise of the body does not only help digestion,
but increase appetite; and that none have so good appetites to more food, as
they that use most action. He knows that one Sermon helps him to understand,
remember, apply, and practice another: and that one Sermon is as an hammer to
drive the former nails fastened by the Master of the Assembly, to the head. He
observes that a child grows not one year in a leg, another in an arm; one
year in one eye, another, in the other; but, in all, together, therefore he
takes in food accordingly: so the new creature (after once formed) in a
Christian, grows in all the parts together, not in one limb alone; therefore
he often receives food, that he may have a full supply to carry on the whole
work together, as the Masters in Architecture give direction in building to
carry up all the building together, and to avoid pawses and intermissions in
carrying up of the whole, till some one part be finished.

Not that he sets no limits to his hearing, although he hear so often as he
can; There are occasions sometimes offered by God in his providence, not only
extraordinary occasions (as when an Ox, or an Ass falls into a pit; a
child, a wise, a parent, etc. suddenly falls dangerously sick on the Sabbath,
and there is a necessity to go for the Physician, etc.) but even ordinary; as
the following of his lawful calling in days of labor; and, the private duties
of Religion in his own family at times requisite; he will not neglect his
calling under color of hearing, seeing Adam even in innocence, was set to till
the ground as well as to converse with his Maker: neither shall private
exercises be omitted under pretense of the Public, seeing David, when he had
set up the Tabernacle, returned to bless his household 2 Samuel 6.20.
. Howbeit, for both he will labor to improve time, so as neither of these
shall be neglected. He will rise more early, labor with more industry, and
avoid other occasions that may withhold from hearing, to redeem time to hear.

Thus, this hypocrite thrusts out one duty with a show of diligence in another
which he never performs, the true Christian hearer is diligent in both, and
so has time enough to hear more, even when he is most in learning and
practicing of what he has heard; the one with Judas, under color of charity
to the poor, seeks to rob Christ of what is due to him; the other will not let
Christ go without his box of precious ointment, nor wholly neglect the poor,
although there be but two mites left him to cast into the Treasury, the one
pretends practice as a bane to hearing, the other makes frequent hearing a spur
to practice.

This hypocrite sometimes trembles at the Word, when yet he despises it in his
heart.

He makes great show of being deeply affected with the Word heard: but he
stands still in his sin, snotwithstanding his trembling: and as the tree, the
more it is shaken by the wind, the faster it rooteth it self; so he shaken in
conscience settles deeper in the love of the world and of himself. He can
tremble, but knows how at present to shift off the Word, as Felix did Paul,
with, go thy way for this time, etc. Act. 24.26,
He trembles not willingly, he would do otherwise if he could help it. Not out
of sense of the Majesty of the Word, but of the terriblenesse of the judgments
denounced in it: not out of any grief for sin condemned by it, but out of
apprehension of the dreadfulnesse of the punishment prepared for him.
Fearfulness has surprised this hypocrite Isa. 33.14.
, ere he was aware. The Law is in his ears, as it was to the Israelites upon
Sinai, shril, and dreadful. It works, and stirs up in him a spirit of
bondage filling him with slavish fear.

He trembles, but runs not to God, but from him, as Cain who went out from the
presence of the Lord Genesis 4, 16.
, that is from having intercourse with God in any Ordinances then used: and so
he and his posterity were after called, sons of men in opposition to the sons
of God, that is, such whom God owned as his people by external profession Gen,
6.2.
. Thus he anathematizeth himself in departing from God, when through horror he
can endure his presence no longer; he will come no more at God in seeking of his
grace, nor will God come to him in a way of saving mercy. He trembles, but is
angry and offended that the Word should come so near him, yet at the same time
could find in his heart to cut it with a penknife, and cast it into the fire
Jer. 26.23.
, because it so directly points at his sins, and lays him open to the view of
all. His heart is so generally exulcerated with the guilt of many sins, that a
man can hardly step beside him. His pride, his covetousness, ambition, are so
notoriously visible, that scarce any thing can be spoken (although with no
glance at him in particular) but he takes it as an high affront purposely put
upon him, to expose him to shame.

On the contrary, the true hearer trembles at the Word, Differ.
as afraid to sin against it.

He so stands in awe of the Word, that it keeps him from sinning against
God. He trembles at the Word, out of a poor and contrite spirit Isa. 66.2.
; not out of a guilty conscience uncleansed. He fears always Prove. 28.14.
, that he may be blessed from an hardened heart. He so trembles, that his
heart is made soft and malleable. The needle of contrition makes way for the
thread of consolation, to sow him the faster unto Christ. He so trembles, that
he is not only moved, but removed from the way and love of evil. He trembles,
but so as not to depart away from God; but to work out his salvation with fear
and trembling Phil 2.12.
; and then fears not to come again to God for comfort; he trembles that he may
tremble again to commit sin; and then, dares to draw near, and to cast
himself upon God that wounded him, to bind up and heal him.

And as when Hos. 6.1.
Jerusalem was surrounded and taken by the Chaldeans, some fled, others were
put to the sword, others yielded, and were spared: so it falls out in this
case, the wicked tremble, and fly from God, or harden themselves against him,
and perish by him: the godly cast down their weapons, submit to mercy, and are
received to it. He trembles in himself, that he may rest in the day of trouble
Hab. 3.16.
.

Thus, this hypocrite trembles as the men of Israel, when the Lord sent
terrible thunder and rain in the time of wheat-harvest, for their great sin in
unseasonable asking of a King 1 Samuel 12.17.
; the true hearer trembles, as Moses when he went up into the holy Mount Heb.
12.21.
. The one trembles, yet is hardened, as Pharaoh; the other trembles, and is
softened, as Josiah, and at length was destroyed; and is saved.

This hypocrite is sometimes in hearing transported with joy, without being
made

He seems to be much taken with the Word heard, as the stony ground, that
receives the seed with joy Mat. 13.20.
; as Herod did the preaching of John without forgoing his incest Mar. 6.17.
: and to the Jews, who rejoiced in his light for a season John 5.35.
thereby he making a fair show of grace; for what more, in outward
expressions, can the best hearer do than to say, O how beautiful upon the
mountains are the feet of him that brings glad tidings Isa. 57.7.
of good things Rom 10.15.
; and, to acknowledge the Minister to be his rejoicing, as he is also the
Ministers, in the day of the Lord Jesus 2 Cor. 1.14.
. But notwithstanding all this his joy is far from the joy that is of the holy
Ghost. For, if we look more narrowly into the hypocrites joy, we shall find
many differences between them.

He rejoices in hearing, but it is rather in the gifts and excellencies of the
speaker, than in the Word spoken, as Ezekiels hearers, that were much taken
with his voice, but not all with the matter Ezekiel. 33.32.
. It is his ambition and glorying that he has a learned eminent man to his
Pastor, and that he is the disciple of a man of note and worth, such an one as
Moses Joh 9 28.
. Or he joyeth in the Word, because it procures him countenance and favor from
men of power and authority, as being thought the better Subject, or
Common-wealths-man for his profession of Religion, as it sometimes falls out in
times of pretended reformation. Or he rejoices in the Word as a true Christian
rejoices in outward things; rejoicing, as if he rejoiced not 1 Cor. 7.36.
. He lets not that joy to settle in his heart, lest it should disturb his
beloved sin by coming too near it. He rejoices from the teeth outward, as we
say. But if the Word be too busy with his Herodias, or his conscience, he is
presently dog-sick, and throws up all, accounting that Word, that Minister an
enemy which tells him the truth; and will, if he dares, reward him as Herod did
John the Baptist.

His joy in the Word is like a flash of lightning, therefore sudden;
extemporary, and therefore temporary; much like a fire of thorns, soon kindled
and soon consumed and extinct: soon hot; suddenly cold. In a moment he is light
all over, by and by his light vanishes, and he is left more melancholic and
mopish: more blind in mind, and hardened in heart.

Now, John Baptist is a Prophet: all Jerusalem and Judea, yea, many of the
Pharisees and Sadduces flock after him Mat. 3.5 6* 7
, so that the Kingdom of heaven suffers violence Mat 11.12.
; shortly after, the tide is turned, and then John Baptist has a Devil ver 28.
. He is too sour, too sharp, too bold; he brings the light too near to the
bleered eye of this hypocrites guilty and unsound conscience.

Or his joy in the Word is secondary, not like the joy he takes in outward
things. He is delighted in the Word, but he will not be at so much cost for
that, as for his pleasures, his profit or other lusts. He will spend more
freely at a Whitson-Ale, or in a Tavern, than he can afford to his Minister.
He affords more time for his sports, than for hearing; for a merry-meeting,
than for a Sermon: he likes well a short Sermon, and a long play; a short
grace, and a long dinner; he will suffer more for outward things, than for
Religion: he will travail further to a Bul-baiting, or to get gain, than to a
Sermon; he will contend more earnestly for his lusts, than for the says once
delivered to the Saints Jude. 3.
; Yea, he will sooner take up the patronage and defense of the worst causes the
vilest persons, than of Gods cause, or of good men. He can better want the
Word, than the world; a Sermon may be better spared, than his sports or gain.
And let him but have the calf Ex. 32, 1, 2.3.
, he can be without Moses as long as he will: give him liberty, and take much
preaching who will: he can joy in hearing, so he be not tied to it. He can
delight in it as in a jest or pastime, when his work is done, not as in a dear
friend, for whose company he leaves all business. He can rejoice in it when it
brings him in prosperity, but takes no comfort in it when he suffers for it.

Finally, he is much in joy, but he is never the better for it; he expresses
much delight in the Word, but he grows not by it, he thrives not under it. He
is still like Pharaohs lean kine in the fattest pasture; yea, his latter end is
worse then the beginning: his love pines away, his humility become flatulent,
and degenerates into complements, or pride. His fear is taught by the precepts
of men: he is ever learning, as if he delighted much in the Ordinances, but
never comes to the knowledge of the truth 2 Timothy 3.6.
; or, if he do, he is soon turned from the truth unto fables 2 Timothy 4.4.
, even to the believing of lies 2 These 2.11.
: for, evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being
deceived 2 Timothy 3.18.
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian rejoices in the Word with the joy of the Holy
Ghost.

He rejoices in the Word, and in him that brings it; in the Word for its own
sake, in him that brings it, for the Words sake, and in both, as in the glory
of Christ 2 Cor. 8 23.
. He joys more in the message then in the Messenger, although one of a
thousand Job. 23.23.
, yet he rejoices in him too, as the wise men did in the star, as it
conducted them to their Savior, not as it gratified their curiosity. He will
be a follower of faithful leaders, not only when they lead him to preferments,
but even unto bonds; for even then he will receive the Word with joy of the
holy Ghost Mat. 2 10.
, although with much affliction 1 These. 1.6.
. It is his comfort in his trouble Ps 119.50.
, and his songs in the house of his pilgrimage ver 54.
. When trouble and anguish take hold upon him, the commandments of God are his
delights ver. 143.
; and even when Princes persecute him without a cause, for the Words sake he
rejoices at the Word, as one that finds great spoils ver. 161.192.
, as sure not only of the victory, but of a rich booty.

He rejoices in the Word, as the worldling in outward things. He prefers
it, as David did Jerusalem, before his chief joy Ps. 137.6.
, It is to him as a discovery of treasure hidden in a field, which when he
has found, for joy thereof he sells all that he has, and buyeth that field
Mat. 13.44.
: yea, so powerful is this joy, that it makes him to delight in the Law of God,
discovering and crossing his corruptions to the utmost height of opposition
Romans 7.22.23.
, even to a giving of Law, and bringing him into captivity to the Law of sin.
His joy is not only full, but lasting. It is perhaps not soon obtained: the
Word first discovers unto him both the nature, loathsomenesse, heinousness,
and wages of his sin, casts him down to hell, makes him a lost man in his own
eyes, and to cry out, O wretched man that I am vtr. 24.
, but afterward, it shows him a well, as God did to Hagar in a mortal
extremity of thirst, and causes him to draw waters with joy out of it Isa.
12.3.
, which joy shall be an everlasting joy; he shall obtain joy and gladness,
and sorrow and sighing shall flee away Isa. 35.10.
. He rejoices as in a good bargain, which the longer he holds, the better it
proves, and the more joy it yields. He went about it with discretion and
deliberation, and therefore holds it with more content and rejoicing; every
using of it adds to his joy, and becomes a perpetual promptuary to further
rejoicing. And albeit he sometimes feel the Word sharper than a two
edged-Sword, yet when he finds it directed not against him, but his lusts, he
is of the mind of honest Citizens who are glad of the coming of the Judge to a
jail-delivery, because he comes to cut off those troublesome and unruly
malefactors whom they were forced to watch with much care and fear.

His joy is magistral and magistratical: it overtops all carnal joys; and, as
love casts out fear, so this joy casts out all false joys of the
hypocrite which are as the crackling of thorns under a pot Eccles 7 6.
The Law of the Lord is better to him then thousands of gold and silver Psalm.
119.72.
. Nay, he has no joy without this, but his soul is disquieted and cast down
within him Psalm. 42.6.
, if this be wanting, he has indeed no joy but this: all his springs are in
this Psalm. 87 7.
. And as nothing can still and content the child but the breast, so nothing can
satisfy him but the sincere milk of the Word. This is a joy which no man shall
take from him Joh. 66.14.
; a joy that remains with him Joh. 15.11.
.

In a Word, it is such a joy as makes him to thrive and grow by it, as herbs
and plants by the warmth and influence of the Sun. He shall rejoice, and his
bones shall flourish like an herb Isa. 66.14.
. All joy and mirth, if not forced or counterfeited, is apt to make men fat and
flourishing, and to lengthen out nature and the concernments and contentments
of it; much more then does spiritual joy make the true Christian to flourish in
old age, to be fat and wel-liking Psalm. 92.14.
. He goes to the Word with joy as an healthy man to his meat; not as a sick
man to his meat, whose stomach loathes the sight of it.

Thus, this hypocrite rejoices in himself, but not in the Lord, the true
Christian rejoices in God, when he cannot rejoice in himself: the joy of the
one is carnal, and therefore fleeting; the joy of the other is heavenly, and
therefore everlasting: the joy of the one is as a painted face without
bettering the complexion, the joy of the other is true joy, and therefore not
only cheereth, but every way adds to his consolation.

This hypocrite is a seeming friend, but a secret foe to the Word.

Sometimes he makes great show of friendship, a good Sermon tickles him, so it
bite not, as Tullyes Oration did Caesar, but never removes him from his former
bottom: he is as good a friend to an interlude that makes him weep, as to that
which makes him laugh, so it concern not himself. He commends the Sermon, and
lets the Preacher enjoy his liberty, as the Officers sent to take Christ, did
him. Never man spoke like this man Joh. 7 46.
, but never was the better for what he spoke; and so they befriended him out of
admiration, not because edified by him. Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and
the paps which thou have sucked (m), said the woman to Christ; but if this were
all, this all was nothing to make her blessed in him. If he commend the
Preacher, he thinks that to be enough for him, and it may be so indeed for the
Preacher (and perhaps too much;) but not enough for himself, unless to his
condemnation, for applauding the Preacher who condemned this hypocrites
unforsaken sins.

He may be almost persuaded. Festus acknowledged much learning in Paul; Agrippa
much force of reason, and evidence of Scripture, yet neither of them converted.
He escapes storms and Pirates at Sea, and makes shipwreck in the Haven, where
destruction is no less sure, but much more miserable. He escapes the waves,
and splits upon the rocks; he out-lives the storms, and perishes by a leak.
He has escaped the more gross lusts of Publicans and harlots; and yet is
further than both from salvation. Or if he make a show of being altogether
persuaded and won unto God, yet he does but verba dare, besprinkle God with
court-holy-water, and is like the Daw, or Parret, that speaks, but has no
meaning. He speaks well, but Oh! that there were an heart in him Deuteronomy. 5.28,
29.
, says the Lord. He will with Johanan, and his companions, entreat the Prophet
to ask of God the way wherein he may walk, and the work he should do Jer. 42.3.
, with great protestations of obeying the voice of the Lord whether it be good
or evil ver. 6.
in the corrupt account of flesh and blood. But his after carriage soon
bewrayes a dissembling heart and tongue in all this profession, which will at
last fly out upon the Prophet and charge him with falsehood and conspiracy, Jer.
43.2, 3.
as if not God had sent him but Baruch had provoked him to make that answer
from the Lord: and shortly after, in plain terms to tell the Prophet to his
head, as for the Word that thou have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we
will not hearken unto thee Jer. 44.16.
. And so he turns the inside outward, and professes himself of a seeming
friend to become an open enemy.

Sometimes he is a secret foe, under a disguise of friendship. The Word
preached is a nail driven by the Masters of the Assemblies; which rives and
drives this hypocrite farther from Christ than he was before. If Christ speak
but of spiritual eating of his flesh, this hypocrite is one of those that slink
from Christ, and walk no more with him Joh. 6.66.
. There is a knot, or stump of infidelity, and disobedience in his heart, that
causes the nail to recoile and to fly back into his face that drives it, so
as it can take no hold. In public he may perhaps (for his credit) dissemble
his wrath, but inwardly he is all in a flame at the Word, although with Herod
he can dissemble it, till an opportunity of revenge; which, notwithstanding his
seeming sorrow; he not unwillingly lays hold upon.

The Word is an hammer appointed to break the rocks it finds in men's hearts in
pieces Jer. 23.29.
: this hypocrites heart is not only a rock that is unmalleable, but as an Anvil
that is made harder and harder by often beating upon it. Yea, he makes his
heart as an Adamant Zech. 7.12.
, that he may not hear with profit, and so falls under that further penal
hardening under which Pharaoh perished; and so he frets at that Word which
still follows him, so that he can neither avoid it, nor be quiet for it. Yea,
the Word is a sharp two-edged Sword, which ^cutteth and gasheth, and cleaves
this hypocrites heart, which cannot but fill him with inward rage; even when he
dissembleth with his lips, he lays up deceit within him, and when he speaks
fair, there are seven abominations in his heart Pro. 26.24.
.

When the Word is as fire to melt, this hypocrites heart is as clay which in
burning is hardened, and baked up to brick: so that let Christ declare himself
against any of this man's lusts, he will not only continue them, but mock him
Luke 16.14.
for his admonition. And whereas the Word is as Physic, this hypocrites heart
is as a queazie stomach that favors the disease, and loathes the medicine. He
may partake take it, as by force; and be sick with it, (as many are
Sermon-sick.) The Word has stirred the ill humor in him, but it is too
tenacious to let go its hold and seat; too much impact and confirmed to be
purged away. He may be moved with a rowzing Sermon, but it is to anger, not to
sorrow. His conscience may be troubled and terrified, as Ahabs was, at Elijahs
prophecy; but never be cleansed. Therefore his heart hates the medicine, and at
last casts it up again 2 Pet. 2.22.
. He hates to be reformed, and therefore casts the Word at his heels Ps.
50.51.
, when he can dissemble his hatred no longer.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian-hearer is truly reconciled to the Word, and
transformed into it.

His heart is not tickled, but pricked Act. 2.37.
: not exasperated by gawling, but cleansed by letting out the corruption of it:
nor gloweth, but burns Luke 24.32.
, until it be converted into the Word, and cast into a new mould, to be made a
new creature. His hearing is not scenical to please and delight fancy; but
serious, to work upon the whole soul, the whole man. To his hearing he adds
meditation, for this is the life of hearing. It is the plaster for the wounded
conscience that feels and complains of the wound: they that are whole use it
not, because they do not think they need it. Only the soul that finds it self
sick of sin, or of love to God, finds no such lenitive, no such fomentation as
to meditate on the comforts of the Word.

He says not, what an excellent man! but what a mighty Word! He prayseth the
Workman by showing forth the power of the Word taught by him. He has the
servants of Christ in singular respect and honor, for their works sake; but he
knows that if he be not a doer of the Word taught by them, he requiteth their
labor with no better than unthankfulness and intolerable contempt. He is not
only almost, but altogether persuaded, as Japhet, to dwell in the Tents of Shem
Gen 9.27.
. He takes up bag and baggage, and removes whither God would have him, although
he know not whither that be. He will not indent with God for fair way and
weather, for peace and plenty, but is content to follow God through thick and
thin, and to partake of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power
of God 2 Timothy 1.8.
. He is fully satisfied not only by faith, but by experience that the Gospel is
truth, and the power of God unto salvation Romans 1.16.
. Therefore he really and without all diffimulation, reservation, or
tergiversation, he receives the Word of God from the Minister, not as the Word
of man, but as (it is in truth) the Word of God 1 These. 2.13
; and he receives it in the love of it, without which he knows he shall never
be saved by it 2 These. 2.10.
. He comes to the Word, as a child to the breast, that he may suck out and be
satisfied with the breasts of her consolations Isa. 66.11.
. He is for sincere milk, without minglings, that he may grow the better by it.

He not only promises, but voweth and thereby binds himself, as by an oath,
to keep Gods righteous judgments Ps. 119.106.
. He gives himself up to the Word, and to Christ in it, and obeyes from the
heart, Rom 6.17.
the Word to which he thus delivers up himself. If the Word snib and check
him, he soon cries peccavi 2 Samuel 12.13
, if the Word speak comfort, he is cheared; if terror, he is humbled; that God
may, (as certainly he will) exalt him, upon all which accounts he may well make
this appeal to God, O how I love thy Law Ps. 119.97.
! Thus is he a true friend to the Word, and to all that are friends unto it.

If the Word be a nail, it fastens him only to Christ. When the Gospel
exhorted to cleave unto the Lord, as Barnabas did, the first Christians Act.
11.23.
. He will be one of the first that joins himself unto Christ ver. 24.
. If the Word be an Hammer, he is well content his heart should be beaten to
Powder by it, rather than stand out against the Word. And let it be a Sword,
and a sharp one too, he is content to be dissected by it, so as to have all his
thoughts laid open to God and himself, and to have the fowlest corruptions
discovered, that they may be the sooner, and the better cleansed; for which he
will fall down on his face, and worship God, acknowledging that God is in the
Minister dispensing the Word, in deed 1 Cor. 14.25
He is well pleased that by a spiritual incision, he may be cut for the stone
in the heart: and that the goodlyest tops of his corrupt nature may be all cut
off, and the stock cleft, that Grace may be graffed on it by the powerful
Ministry of the Word.

If the Word be as fire, yet it is welcome: for his heart is as wax which
melts and dissolveth by it, and not as clay that stands out against it. He
has much dross in him, that he desires may be either burnt up, or separated:
and he cries out, hic ure, burn and spare not here, so I may be saved
hereafter, although it be as by fire 1 Cor. 3.15.
; If it deprive him of an hand, a foot, or an eye, he will endure it, as
knowing it to be more profitable for him that one of his members should perish,
than that the whole should be cast into hell Mat. 5.29.
. He never complains of the Hammer, but of the stonynesse of his heart that
needs the hammer. Nor does he cry out of the fire, but of the dross within
him, which needs to be burnt up. He willingly suffers the strongest Physic
which the Word affords, not only to stir, but to scowre and carry away all
his ill humors, that he may once hear Christ say unto him, now art thou clean
through the Word that I have spoken to thee Joh. 15.3.
. Which he can never hope for, until by faith, applying the Word, his heart be
purified Act 15.9.
. For, though the Physic administered to all, be, in it self, all one; Yet, the
Holy Ghost as the Spirit of faith, infuseth and mixeth one ingredient more in
the hearts of the godly, and that is faith, without which the Word profits
not those that hear it. He has woeful experience of his Infidelity, that it is
astringent and obstructive, it stops the passages, but faith is as opening
Physic that mollifieth the heart and makes it capable of any impression, which
the Holy Ghost by the stamp of the Word shall make upon the heart.

Thus, this hypocrite is to the Word as Mical to David, who never hated him in
her heart Sam. 6.16.
more, than when she went to meet him ver. 20.
. The true Christian is unto it, as Jonathan to David; saying unto it,
whatsoever thy soul desires, I will even do it for thee 1 Samuel 20.4.
, because he loves it as his own soul ver. 17.
. The one saluteth the Word with Judas his kiss Mat. 26 49.
; the other embraces it as Joseph did Benjamin, his bowels yerning upon it
Genesis 43.29, 30.
. The one is as the adversaries of Judah, offering Zerubbabel and the rest of
the fathers to build with them Ezra. 4.2.
, as pretending to seek and worship the same God with them, when their purpose
was to undermine, or destroy the building; the true Christian is to the Word
what Jehoshaphat was to Jehoram, desiring his assistance against the Moabites,
I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses 2 King
3.7.
. He will engage with it, and for it, body for body, and life for life.

CHAP. XXI. The Praying Hypocrite, Is he whose tongue prays, Defin.
but not his heart.
HE draws near unto God with his mouth, and with his lips pretends much
honor to him, but he removes his heart from him Isa. 29.30.
. He sacrifices the calves of his lips, but without an heart, which the very
Heathens account ominous. If any beast sacrificed by Heathens (who ever looked
narrowly into the intrals) Ezekiel. 21.21.
was found without an heart, this was held ominous, and construed as very
prodigious to the person for whom it was offered, as it fell out in the case of
Julian. This hypocrites sacrifice of prayer is no better: He flattereth God
with his mouth Psalm. 78.36.
; but is, as Ephraim, a silly dove, without heart Hos. 7.11.
. He cries not to God with his heart, even when he howleth upon his bed ver.
14.
. Therefore his calves are as unacceptable to God, as Aarons calf, in the
wilderness; by which he made the people naked to their shame Ex. 32.25.
, or, as Jeroboams calves in Dan and Bethel, after which the ten Tribes went a
whoring to their ruin.

His prayers are Idol-calves, Moon-calves that cannot speak: at best, they do
but lough as beasts, or babble as Heathens Mat. 6.7.
; and such praying would make God an Idol too, that cannot hear. For, albeit
God accepts the calves of the lips, when the heart indireth the petition, and
the Spirit of God directs it in so doing, (because he that searches the
heart, knows what the mind of the spirit is Romans 8.27.
), this man, mentem imprecatam gerit, carries about him an unhappy soul, that
draws down a curse instead of blessing. He may cry Lord, Lord, praying again
and again; but, all his importunity will not procure him entrance into the
Kingdom of heaven Mat. 7.21.
, because he does not the Will of the father which is in heaven, in praying
with the heart, as well as in other things. There is a sacrifice of fools
offered in praying, as well as in hearing. Such is every prayer of the
hypocrite, who knows not what evil he does Eccles. 5.1
. For, how can it but highly displease and provoke the Lord, to find this
hypocrite daily telling lies, not only to the world, and the Church, by his
profession without answerable walking; but, even to God himself, by a prayer
that proceeds from fained lips; and, so grossly to dissemble, not only in
speaking of God, but in speaking to him? He that undertakes to pray, dares to
tell God to his face, that he loves him, fears him, and trusts in him; in
all which, this hypocrites heart does, or can give his tongue the lie: There is
no forgery to that of counterfeiting the voice of Gods own Spirit: no mockery,
like the praying God to hear and consider, what he that prays considers
not himself, nor scarcely hears what he rashly utters with his mouth before
God. No marvail then, if such mock-prayers be not only returned into the
bosom, empty; but, turned into sin to him that prays, and into abomination
to him to whom they are directed.

On the Contrary, the true Christians heart is first in prayer. Differ.


He knows that prayer is the key to all the treasures of grace, but the heart
is the hand that must turn this key; as faith is the hand by which he receives
whatever is given him of God upon his praying; Therefore he looks very
carefully to this key that it rust not for want of use, and manageth it
dexterously in all addresses to the throne of grace.

He makes use of the tongue in prayer, but is careful that his prayers go not
out of fained lips Psalm 17.1.
. Therefore first, his heart inditeth a good matter: then, his tongue is the
pen of a ready Writer Psalm. 45.1.
. If he lift up a prayer 2 King. ^9.4
, it shall not be only with his tongue or hands: but, he will lift up his heart
with his hands, unto God in the heavens Lam. 3.41.
; If his eyes (as Jehoshaphats 2 Chr. 20.12
) be toward God in prayer, he lifts up his soul unto God also Psalm. 25.1.
.

The Spirit is the chief Musician to which every song of prayer and praise is
committed, to compose it to the mind of God. The heart is the chief string in
the soul, to which all the rest, to wit, the tongue, eye, hand, understanding,
must be tuned. The Spirit of prayer first, sets up the heart to its due height,
and then winds up the rest accordingly to it, and so makes up a complete
Diapason, Macrob. Comment. in Somn. Scipion.
or harmony of the whole, to yield a grateful sound in the ears of God, and to
offer up a spiritual sacrifice acceptable to God by Jesus Christ 1 Pet. 2.5.
.

Thus praying, he sweetly communeth and converseth with God, and God with him,
by answering prayer, as he did with Abraham Genesis 19.33.
, Moses Exodus 33.11.
, David, and all the faithful. And when he speaks, it is not so much the
speech of the tongue, as of the heart by the tongue, as the Bell being first
moved, yields a sound by the clapper striking upon it. The heart may speak
without the tongue, and be heard without the moving of the lips; but if the
tongue speak without the heart, the man goes away without answer. There is
nothing uttered before God in prayer, that turns to profit, either for matter,
manner, measure, time, place, or end of prayer, but the heart must be, Rector
Chori, the chief leader of the Quire, being it self first prepared and guided
by the Spirit of Prayer. When God calls him to this duty, and says, seek my
face, his heart says unto God, thy face, Lord, will I seek Psalm. 27.8.
. He knows that he can never shoot one prayer steddily into the throne of
grace, to hit the white, until he be able to say, my heart is fixed, O God, my
heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise Psalm. 57.7.
; that so; he may pray with the Spirit, and with the understanding also; and
sing with the Spirit, and with the understanding also. 1 Cor. 14.15
.

Thus, this hypocrite is no better than the Prophets of Baal who cried aloud to
their Idol; but, without answer or regard 1 Kin. 18.28, 2^.
. The true Christian prays as the Prophet of the Lord, being answered with
fire from heaven that consumed his sacrifice ver. 37 38.
: the one is as the Nightingale, nothing but a voice; the other as David, whose
prayer is set forth as incense, and the lifting up of his hands as the morning
sacrifice Psalm. 141.2.
which God accepts: the one prays as Esau, for the blessing, seeking it,
perhaps with tears, but goes without it Heb. 12.17.
; the other wrestleth, as Jacob Genesis 32.24.
, whereby he had power with God, and prevailed, when he made supplication to
him Hos. 12.4.
.

This hypocrite prays for what himself has a mind to, without looking
farther.

Whether the things he has a mind unto, be according to the Will of God (which
ought to be the rule of prayer Romans 8.27.
, as well as of righteousness) with him it matters not. His heart is set upon
them, and he must have them, whether Gods will be so, or not. Gods will and his
submission to it, is a thing he eyeth not in prayer. If he conceit that what he
desires is good for him, he admits of no other judge in the case, nor sits
down by any answer, but a grant. Not Gods will, but his own must be done. Yea,
sometimes he prays, and is importunate for things disagreeing with the will
of God, as the Israelites for a King 1 Samuel 8.5.
, after God had declared his dislike of that request ver. 7.8, etc.
, because himself was their King 1 Samuel 12.12
.

This is a sin too common in the praying Hypocrite, seldom does he present
himself before God in prayer, but he makes bold with him in this kind, sinning
in the very matter prayed for. He must be his own carver, or like the child (as
silly, as sullen) that will not eat his meat, if himself may not cut it, he
flings away from God, as Naaman from Elisha 2 King. 5.12.
, in a rage. This, if done with knowledge and deliberation, is gross impiety,
little short of Atheism; if of ignorance, it is a fearful degree of supine
negligence not to inform himself before hand what the will of the Lord is
Ephesians. 5.17.
. No wise man dares put up a suit to his Prince, but that which he thinks will
be acceptable and feasible.

And yet in such suits he is commonly most importunate, even unto wilfulness,
(as men are naturally more violent and furious in a wrong way, than willing to
make speed in the right.) as Balaam, for leave to go with the Princes of
Balack; the Israelites for Quails; and after, for a King. And sometimes God
yields to such prayers, not in mercy, but to their greater punishment, who
would take no nay. For men never fare worse, then when God lets them be their
own carvers without submission to his will. So God gave the Israelites Quails
Exodus 16.12.
, which they asked for their lusts: but, while the flesh was yet between their
teeth, yet it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people,
and the Lord smote them with a very great plague Number. 11.33
. So, he afterward gave them a King in his anger [to their vexation] and rock
him away in his wrath Hos. 13.11.
, to their greater misery. Thus, many in their imprecations and curses upon
themselves, or others, are heard, ere they be aware: but, in vengeance, so that
they have no cause to boast of their audience. Thus God heard the imprecations
of those murmurers, who wished that they had died in the wilderness Number. 14.2.
. And sends them word by Moses, as ye have spoken in mine cares, so will I do
unto you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness ver. 28.29.
.

Contrarily, the true Christian makes sure his warrant from God, before he
prefer his suit.

He dares not open his lips, or give way to his heart, to ask any particular,
before he be assured that his suit be according to the will of God. If God make
a promise, he pleads it. Remember thy promise unto thy servant wherein thou
have commanded me to put my trust Ps 118 49.
; thou have revealed this unto thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house,
therefore has thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee 2 Samuel 7.27.
. If Gods honor be engaged, that is ground sufficient to press God for
mercies to our selves or others. What will thou do to thy great Name Joh. 7.9.
? If his power and mercy be interessed, he prays, let the power of my Lord be
great according as thou have speken Number. 14.17.
, and pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy
mercy ver. 19
. If any dishonor should happen to God by not helping, he flies to God upon
that account, that the Lord would assist him without going to others for aid,
as Ezra, who was ashamed to ask a band of soldiers of the King, for a convoy,
having given it out, that the hand of his God is upon all them for good that
seek him, and his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him
Ezra. 8.22.
. If God give him a rule what to pray for, and in what order, he keeps close
unto it, as taking that to be warrant sufficient to pray for any thing, God
allows and teaches him to ask First, therefore he prays that the will of
God may be done; and then, so far forth as may stand with that will, he
asks daily bread, that is, food, and all things convenient and seasonable for
him Prove. 30.8.
.

When he has his warrant, he is bold, and cannot be too importunate, because
his prayer is grounded upon Gods will, steeled by faith, seconded by the
Spirit, and handed unto God by his own Son, who also perfumeth it to make it
more acceptable. Here, if God will wrestle with Jacob, and for a long time too
Gen: 32 24.
: while Jacob is weeping and making his supplication to him, Jacob will not be
put off so; no, Hos. 12.4.
not when God himself says to him, let me go; but tells him plainly, I will
not let thee go except thou bless me Gen 32.16.
. No more would the Canaanitish woman give over her contest with Christ, until
she got what she came for Mat. 15.27, 28.
, not that by his own strength can any man prevail 1 Samuel 2 9.
; but he wrestleth with God, with Gods own strength, where God himself makes
way. For the suit, and the Spirit of God frames it, and encourages the heart
to press it home with warranty of success, as knowing the mind of God who
also knows the mind of his own spirit, that is more deeply engaged in the
suit than the suitor himself. Therefore he sues boldly and will take no nay
Prove. 30.7.
; no, not when providence seems to cross the promise Deuteronomy. 9.14. and ver. 18.
.

Notwithstanding all which, he is not peremptory in things doubtful, because
not clearly revealed. Herein he prays with submission: so also when nature,
seeking her own preservation, puts him to pray against that which nature
abhors. Herein he will be a follower of Christ, and when he has prayed
again and again, Father if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou will Mat. 26.39.
: and again, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I
drink it, thy will be done ver. 42.
. He can tell what himself would have, but he chooses rather to take, and rest
contented with what God would have, as well understanding that a friendly
denial is better than an angry grant.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Rachel, that must have children, or die Gen 30.1.
; the true Christian, is as Hannah who after she had prayed submitted all unto
God, and therefore went away, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad
1 Samuel 1.18.
: the one looks only at the pleasing of himself, and therefore thinks he must
needs have whatever he asks for; the other looks first and chiefly to the
will of God, and therefore is best pleased when Gods will is done, although
with crossing of his own.

Thus this hypocrites heart and prayer runs more naturally after earthly
things, than

Here, he is most frequent, most fervent, in his element Every hypocrite is a
worldling whatever pretense he make to heaven: and the worldly man's Pater
noster begins and ends with, give us daily bread; all the other petitions do
but bear this company, as the rest of the Virgins that follow the Bride: for
that alone is married to his heart. David has taken his prayer at large, but
he has enough of him, and his prayer too, and desires to be rid of both. Rid
me, says he Ps. 144.11. etc
, from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaks vanity: and, what
vanity was that? this: That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth,
that our daughters may be as corner stones polished after the similitude of a
Palace; that our Garners may be full, affording all manner of store; that our
sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands in our streets, that our
oxen may be strong to labor, that there be no breaking in, nor going out, that
there be no complaining in our streets. Thus, there be many that say, who will
show us any good? but very few, who pray with David, Lord lift thou up the
light of thy countenance upon us Ps. 4.6.
. Let him have earth, take heaven who will: For thus his heart speaks,
whatever his tongue talks to the contrary.

Not that it is unlawful to ask bread, or earthly necessaties; we have as good
warrant to pray for them, in their order and rank with submission, as for
heaven it self; Godliness having promise of the life that now is, as well as
of that to come 1 Timothy 4.8.
. But this hypocrite prays for lawful things unlawfully; either neglecting
the better part of the promise for the things of the life to come: he desires
God to be a Sun and shield unto him, without care whether he bestow grace and
glory Psalm. 84.11.
: those whom God has joined he separateth; or, at least, minds most the lesser
and the worser part, without choosing the better. Or, if he look after
spirituals, it is not in the first place: he seeks not first the Kingdom of
God, the substance; and the righteousness thereof Mat. 6.33.
, the chief commodity; but, he makes the things of this life the main thing
which he first seeks after; and, spiritual things the surplussage, and but as
packthread and paper to wrap the other in. And therefore in praying for these
things which concern this life, he does not exercise faith, but nature. Pro se
orat necessitas, necessity becomes her own advocate. All his prayers are but
vox naturae, natures voice, not the prayers of faith; they only call out
providence, not the promise.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian puts up most petitions for heavenly things.

These he has most in his eye, in his heart, and therefore in his tongue. His
heart is, through grace, most naturally carried after these things, as the
heart of the worldling, after things of the world. When others are for any
good, he is for the light of Gods countenance. He seeks first the Kingdom of
God and the righteousness thereof; leaving the rest to God. And while the man
of this world seeks to have his portion in this life, and his belly filled
with Gods hidden treasures of the world, and to have enough not only for
himself, but his children Psalm. 17.4.
; this man of God the Christian, prays to be delivered from such an
earth-worme, as from a Sword ver. 13.
: and, for himself, he resolves on the contrary, as for me, I will behold thy
face in righteousness, I shall be satisfied, when I awake with thy likeness
ver. 15.
.

Not that he neglects prayer for daily bread, because he needs it, and God
has promised it. But that he does e pest liminio, as having recovered his
former right and title before forfeited; not as taking them from the hand of
common providence, when cast before him, as food to beasts: not as the main
promise, but as necessaries for his support and comfort in his pilgrimage. He
prays for them not as his inheritance, but as springs of water necessary for
present use, as Achsah the wife of Othniel prayed to her father for that
blessing, after he had given a field, to her husband Judge. 1.15.
. And when he prays for these things, it is not the voice of nature but the
wrestling of faith, because he craves them by virtue of the promise; nor is it
the language of his lusts, but the ejaculations of the Spirit; not to consume
them upon his lusts Jam. 4.3.
, but to improve them to spiritual ends, that they may further his account in
the day of Christ Phil. 4.17.
.

Thus, this hypocrite prays with the voice of Ishmael, crying for water to
quench his thirst Genesis 21.17.
: the true Christian prays with the heart of Isaac, meditating in the field
Genesis 24.63.
. the one is as Martha, troubled about many things whereas one thing is
necessary Luke 10.41.
: the other, as Mary prays for the good part which shall not be taken from
him, the one prays with the voice of ravens, and lions that seek their meat
from God (z); the other prays with the Spirit of Gods children, that draw
near in full assurance of faith to the throne of grace, for the precious
things of the earth.

This hypocrite prays carnally for spirituals.

He is a pretender to heavenly things, how else should he maintain his
correspondence and esteem with such as are heavenly? But he is carnal and
earthly in all his thoughts and endeavors for the compassing of spiritual
things. For, either his prayers are but carnal wishes, sudden flashes, as soon
gone as come, as that of Balaam, let me die the death of the righteous Number.
23.10.
; but never preparing for death, nor perhaps thinking more of it seriously,
till he comes to die. Thus the people that took ship to follow Christ to
Capernaum Joh 6.24.
, hearing his discourse of the bread of God, that gives life unto the World,
they say unto him, Lord evermore give us this bread ver. 34.
. but it was but a cold-faint prayer, without laboring for it as he had
exhorted ver. 27.
: If heaven will fill his belly and drop into his mouth, it may be welcome: but
otherwise, he will adventure to be without it. He has not an heart to work for
it; and so this is no other than the desire of the slothful that kills him,
because his hands refuse to labor Prove. 21.25.
.

If he be more earnest in prayer for spiritual things, it is rather for such as
may keep him out of hell, than for such as fit him for heaven; for pardon of
sin, rather then for power against it; for happiness, rather than holiness;
for quieting a scolding conscience, rather than for grace to walk in the ways
of peace with God; for faith, rather than for repentance; for faith to remove
mountains, rather than to mount him above the world; for heaven in hope of a
Turks Paradise, rather than for purity of heart to make him partaker of the
Paradise of God with Christ Rev. 2.7.
: so that in all that he asks of God he so carries the matter, that God may
rather serve his turn, than that he may be serviceable to God.

Or, if he pray for grace, he is loath to be too earnest, lest he should have
too much of it, as Augustine before conversion was afraid to be heard too soon
against his beloved lust. He prays for so much as may serve his turn at
Church, and in company, but not for communion with God in secret; for so much
as may deal gently with his lusts, but not for so much as may turn them out of
doors: for so much as may cause him in some sort to outstrip others in
outward show; but not for so much as may equal them in sincerity and truth in
the inner parts, which God loves so much Psalm. 51.6.
.

Or, if he pray for grace, yet it is not with keeping off from the course of
sin. When he cries unto God, my Father thou art the guide of my youth, he will
not let him be the guide of his ways, but for all this glavering and courting,
he speaks and does as evil things as he can Jer. 4, 5.
. This is the voice of Jacob, but the hands of Esau. He may perhaps pray
against idleness, drunkenness, uncleanness, riot, gameing, lying, etc. but
straightway he puts himself into evil company, and hunts after occasions,
temptations and opportunities of renewing those very sins he has prayed
against; as too many do, who would have God to cure them, but throw up, or away
the potion, and pull off the plaster that should do the deed.

Contrarily, the true Christians prayer for every thing, Differ.
is every way spiritual.

As in speaking of the things of God, he compares spiritual things with
spiritual 1 Cor 2.13.
, he goes about them in a spiritual manner; so in speaking unto God who is a
Spirit; he is careful to do it spiritually: he is assisted in it by the Spirit
who helps his infirmities, when himself knows not what to pray for as he
ought Romans 8.27.
. He speaks the language of the Spirit, not of the flesh; he does not court
God with humane rhetorique, but wrestles with God with divine strength, and
overcomes God with his own weapons, praying in the holy Ghost Jude 20.
; and so is strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might Ephesians. 6.10.
, not only to encounter Devils, but to prevail with God Hosea 12.4.
.

His prayers are not only sudden ejaculations, or cold wishes, but
premeditated, prepared petitions at least for the matter of them, pressed home,
and ingeminated as minding his suit, and following on to solicit it, until
it be granted; as being in earnest with God, and resolving to take no denial;
Blot out my transgressions Psalm. 51.1.
; wash me thoroughly, (again, and again,) from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from
my sin ver. 2.
; and yet again, purge me with Hysop, and wash me ver. 7.
: nor stays he here, but he prays further, hide thy face from my sins, and
blot out all mine iniquities ver. 9.
, nor does he give over so, but adds a more special request, Deliver me from
blood-guiltinesse, O God ver 14.
. This he chiefly aimed at before; but by all these iterations of the same
thing, he is far from vain repetitions, but shows the earnestness and
fervency of his soul as if all the words he could use, were too few to express
the strength of his desire, and the vehemence of his heart to get this petition
granted.

Nor does he pray only for pardon of sin, but for clensing of his soul; create
in me a clean heart, O God! and renew a right Spirit within me ver 10.
, in order to the hearing of joy and gladness. It contents not him to be freed
from the guilt, unless he may be delivered from the power of sin; not that sin
be suppressed, but that the body of sin be destroyed Romans 6.6.
. Nor is it enough for him to see Christ upon the cross to bear his sins,
unless his old man be crucified with him; never giving over that lamentable
out cry, O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this
death? until he find himself so eased of it that he may be able to change his
note, upon his deliverance from it, into that voice of joy, I thank God
through Jesus Christ our Lord Rom: 7.25.
. He desires not only a worsting of Satan, but an utter overthrow of Satan's
Kingdom in his heart. He prays not for a taste, but a full draught of grace,
yea, to be filled with all the fullness of God Ephesians. 3.19.
.

He does not only pray for grace, and open his mouth wide for God to fill it
Psalm. 81.10.
, but by the strength of God, he puts his own hand to the work also; not lying
still in the ditch, and crying God help me; but striving, by and with Gods
help, to get out. Therefore he not only prays God to turn away his eyes from
beholding vanity Psalm. 119.37.
, but himself also makes a covenant with his eyes not to look upon a lustful
object Job. 31.1.
. He not only prays God, to set a watch before his mouth Psalm. 141.3.
; but he will also set one himself, and keep his tongue as with a bridle Psalm.
39.1.
. Thus he seeks in his carriage to second his petitions, and not to way-lay
his own prayers by his practice; that he may with more confidence and
experience expect from God the grace which he begged. And as Elisha, being to
pass over Jordan, after Elijah was taken from him, took his mantle, and smote
the waters, and said, where is the God of Elijah, whereupon the waters,
instantly parted hither, and thither, and Elisha went over 2 King. 2.14.
. So the Christian going from prayer unto practice, smites the waters of sin,
with the mantle of grace, falling from the God of Elijah into his lap, and
says where is the power and spirit of prayer? where is the strength I prayed
for? and thereby gets over the deepest rivers and the strongest torrents of his
fleshly lusts that would hinder his passage. And thus when he calls upon the
name of the Lord, he departs from iniquity 2 Timothy 2.19.
, which is a sure evidence that he belongs unto God, under seal.

Yea, even in praying for carnal (to wit, earthly) things, he is in a spiritual
frame of heart and therefore prays spiritually even for them: for as the
hypocrite is carnal in spirituals, so, the true Christian is spiritual in
carnals: and desires them only in ordine ad spiritualia, that he may by them be
better enabled to honor God with his substance Prove. 3.9.
, and to make a spiritual use thereof, using faith to spiritual, not fleshly
ends: not as the rich worldling, saying to his soul, take thine ease, etc. but
as David's soul to God, my goodness, or benificence, extends not unto thee,
but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all
my delight Psalm. 16.12.
. He looks upon them as surrogated by God, in his room to receive his bounty;
first giving his own self to the Lord, and then unto his servants by the will
of God 2 Cor. 8.5.
: and so he makes a heavenly use and improvement of the good things of the
world.

Thus, this hypocrite when he prays to God for spirituals, is like those
Ephraimites that pronounced Sibboleth instead of Sshibboleth, and were cut off
by the Gileadites Judge. 12.6.
. The true Christian is as those Cities of Egypt that spoke the language of
Canaan Isa. 19.18,
, which God well understands, and accepts: the one by his counterfeiting a
prayer for spiritual things, discovers himself to be carnal; the other even in
praying for earthly blessings, declares himself spiritual, to whom is given a
pure lip to call upon the Name of the Lord Zeph. 9.3.
.

This hypocrite wavereth in prayer.

How he behaveth himself in the matter of his prayer we have seen. Here and in
the four next Characters, we shall further trace and discover him by the
manner of his praying. He prays, but either he knows not his own mind, he is
(...) Jam. 1.6.
a wavering man divided in his thoughts whether he should pray or not, for that
which he has now in his thoughts. He asks, shall I? shall I? Till the fit be
over, and the opportunity past. He is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the
wind and tossed: he goes any way, not which a right spirit leads him, but
which the wind of company, or the time drives him: and so, he flotes up, and
down, like froth upon the water, till it consume into vapor; or like the wave
that breaks upon the rock, without benefit to it self. It is in vain therefore
for him to think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord ver. 7.
.

Besides, he is (...) a man of a double-heart, sometimes he looks one way, and
feign would go that; sometimes another, and then he is as hot upon that: he is
fickle, and giddy-headed what way to take to attain his desires, he knows
not: Sometimes he thinks prayer will do it, by and by he despondeth, and dares
not trust God, upon his prayers. Sometimes he questions the power of God; can
God furnish a Table in the Wilderness, where no provision appears Psalm. 78.19.
; Sometimes, his truth, what profit should I have, If I pray unto him Job.
21.15.
? and most of all his love. He sees no fruit of his prayers, but finds that
God loves the proud, the wicked, and they that tempt him, better, then he loves
him. Therefore he calls the proud, happy; because he finds that they that work
wickedness are set up, and advanced, while he is kept low; yea, they that
tempt God are even delivered Mal. 3.15.
, while he, notwithstanding all his prayers, sticks fast in the mire. This
makes him to be (...) unstable, (and dancing, as over a quagmire where he dares
not stand still for fear of sinking) in all his ways Jam. 1.8.
. When he prays, he is unresolved whether that be best. Therefore, when he
has begun, he gives over, then, goes to it again, and by and by desisteth: he
cannot tell what he would be at, nor what course to drive to accomplish his
ends. He looks upon prayer as a thing highly commended by others; therefore he
thinks to try it: but, for his own part, he never found good of it answerable
to the high commendations that others give of it; therefore, he cannot tell how
to trust God with his prayers, or his prayers with God: and so, he prays, and
doubts; he doubts, and faints, and thereby loses all his labor.

On the Contrary, the true Christian asks in faith, nothing wavering. Differ.


His heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord Psalm. 112.7.
, he flotes not up and down like a wisp of straw upon the top of a wave; but
anchors by faith and hope upon a sure ground. He knows whom he has believed
and trusted 2 Timothy, 1.12.
; and, to whom he has prayed; and that he is both able, and faithful, and
unchangable in his love. As he calls upon him, so he looks upon his warrant,
call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee Psalm. 50.15.
: and thence confidently concludes, the Lord shall deliver me, etc. 2 Timothy 4.18
When he prays, he looks upon God, and bespeaks him as a Father, a name of
no less pity than of power, and a relation that cannot deny what he goes unto
him for. He troubles not himself with the issue, when he has done his duty:
therefore having prayed, he is confident, not despondent, cheereful, not sad.
His prayer of faith is the cure of sadness, and casts all his burden upon
God, reserving nothing for himself to do, save only to walk and wait in the
means and way of Gods appoinment and providence, and thus is he kept by the
power of God through faith unto salvation 1 Pet. 1.5.
.

He has not his election to make, when he goes unto God in prayer; nor is he
unresolved, when he has prayed: but, peremptorily concludes, I am persuaded
that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day 2 Timothy 1.12.
: and that all things whatsoever he shall ask in prayer, believing, he shall
receive it Mat. 21.22.
. His heart is established with grace, and his prayers are steeled by faith to
penetrate, not only the heavens, but the very heart of his father, that he can
no more refuse his request than deny himself 2 Timothy 2.13.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the Israelites pursued by Pharaoh, when they cried
to the Lord, but expected nothing but death Exodus 14.10, 11.
; the Christian is as Moses, who also cried unto the Lord, as they did; but, as
believing the Lord would fight for Israel ver. 14.15.
, although when he said so, he knew not which way the Lord would take for them:
the one prays as a Coward fights, winking, and doubting the issue; the
other seeks God as David, in full assurance of faith that the Lord has heard
his supplication, even before his prayer comes at him Psalm. 6.9.
; remembering who has said, before they call I will answer, and while they are
yet speaking I will hear. Isa. 65.24.
.

This hypocrite in praying, is presumptuous.

He is in extremes: sometimes wavering, sometimes over-confident and bold. In
extremities, he prays with much doubting, for want of faith to believe and of
hope to wait upon God: When he takes himself to have the odds of the evil that
accosteth him, then he is arrogant and saucie with God, as if he had God at
command to grant any thing that he asks for his lust, and quarrelleth if he
refuse him. Wherefore have I fasted, says he, and thou see not Isa. 58.3
? even when he fasted for success in strife and debate, and to smite with the
fist of wickedness ver. 4
. He is bold even unto impudence, and comes before God crying unto him, my
Father, thou art the guide of my youth even when he walks not one step in Gods
way. When he has gotten wealth by unjust gain, or enriched himself by rapine
and spoil, he will entitle God to be Author of his riches, blessed be the Lord
for I am rich Zech. 11 5.
. He immediately fathers his wickedness upon God, under a color of giving him
thanks for what he never bestowed, in hope that this complement will stop Gods
mouth going about to reprove and condemn him, and procure him some countenance
from heaven, even in his fraud and oppression.

And when he makes his addresses, he is more ready to say, God I thank thee
Luke 18 11
: (yet, it is far from true thankfulness) than to cry, God I pray thee, as
sensible of his wants. He thinks it more reason for him to pray, God, reward
me, than to say, God be merciful to me a sinner ver 13.
. He glories more in himself for what (in his own imagination) he is, than
rejoices in God for what he has wrought in him, for him, or by him. He is
highly conceited in his own deserts, therefore no mean boon will serve his
turn, he will worship Christ, and seem very humble in his gestures, when he
comes with a prayer; but, it suffices not him to get into heaven, unless he
be one of the uppermost there; he must sit next to Christ (on the one hand, or
other) in his Kingdom Mat. 20.20, 21
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian sueth in forma pauperis.

He looks not what he has, but what he wants; he considers not what he is
in the world, as if he were to purchase of man; but what his riches are toward
God, when he is going to the throne of grace. Here he knows his wants are more
then his store his necessities beyond his bags. He lacks spiritual wine, milk,
and bread, and every, thing, but he has no money to buy. Therefore he must
either come to Gods storehouse, without money and without price Isa. 55.1
, or go without supply. He must beg, or starve, how great soever he be in the
things of the world, he knows he must be one of Gods Paupers, or prove a
beggar indeed. Hence, he rather begs, than boasts. He comes not to Gods door
as to a Market, but as to a rich man's dole, where Dives must put in for a share
as well as Lazarus; or else Dives shall one day instead of begging of God, beg
a boon of Lazarus, and go without Luke 16.24 25.
. He prays God be merciful to me a sinner, and stands at a distance too, as
not worthy to come nearer Luke 18.13.
; and not, God reward me for my righteousness for my merits, for my works of
supererrogation? He has (to his own apprehension) a sad, sorrowful, dejected
heart when he comes before the Lord: he is more in longing then in speaking,
more in sighings then in utterance; yea, the more holy, the more low, mean and
poor in his own eyes, as Abraham Genesis 18.27
, Jacob Genesis 22.10.
, David, whose language, not in a complement, but in a due sense of his own
emptiness, was, I am poor and needy P^al. 40.17
.

And when he does call to mind graces received, this alters not the case, to
make him change his opinion, touching his own riches: even when he is fullest,
he denies himself most, not as undervaluing the graces of God in him, but
himself that enjoyes them. Here he emptieth himself of the glory of them, and
gives him the honor that is the Author of them. If he labor in the Gospel
more than some others, and be compelled for the necessary vindication of
himself and his Ministry, to say that he labored more abundantly than they all
1 Cor. 15.10
; he has his (...). his emendation of his speech at hand, whereby he restores
the honor to him to whom it was more due; yet not I, but the grace of God
which was with me. Not I, but Christ that lives in me. Not I but Christ that
strengthens me Gal. 2.20.
. He is afraid of any word that drops from him, which may in the least derogate
from God or Christ. If he do any thing, give any thing, he freely
acknowledges, de te Domine suppleo, quod non habeo in me: all things come of
thee, and of thine own have I given thee 1 Chr. 29.24.
.

Thus, this hypocrite comes unto God as the Elders of the Jews unto Christ in
behalf of the Centurion, for the cure of his servant, saying, he is worthy for
whom thou should do this Luke 7.4.
; but the true Christian addresseth himself to God, as the Centurion himself, I
am not worthy that thou should enter under my roof, neither thought I my self
worthy to come unto thee ver. 6.7.
: the one is as bold with God, as Simon Magus, with Peter, thinking to buy the
Holy Ghost with money Act. 8.18, 19
. the other is humble, as Peter, falling down at Jesus knees, and saying,
depart from me for I am a sinful man Luke 5.8.
. The one by his ignorant presumption gets no better answer from God, then the
Sorcerer from Peter, thy many perish with thee, because thou have thought that
the gift of God may be purchased with money Act. 8.20.
; the other by his humility has boldness and access with confidence through
says Ephesians. 3.12.
, whereby he comes boldly (through his High Priest) unto the throne of grace,
and so obtains mercy, and finds grace to help in time of need Heb 4.16.
.

This hypocrite in prayer is rather quarrelsome, than submissive.

He is proud, and therefore a small matter makes him quarrel. By pride comes
contention Prove. 13.10.
. He rather complains of God, if God be not at his beck, or come not at a
whistle, to gratify his lusts, and even to help him to smite others with the
fist of wickedness: rather than confess his own wickedness in putting up
such a prayer, or holding such a fast. Wherefore have we afflicted our souls
and thou take no knowledge Isa. 58.3.
? He is not (by his own account) behind with God, but God with him. He has
done a world of service, but is ill requited of God for his pains. His wages
come short of what he might expect. He is far from that submission, not my
will, but thy will be done. If he be crossed in his expectation, he thinks God
does him wrong: If God delay him, 1 Samuel 13.8.
he faints as Saul when Samuel stayed longer then Saul would have had him. If
he deny him, his heart (as Nabals 1 Samuel 25.37
) dies within him and becomes as a stone, He has as base an esteem of God,
when he finds he will not hear him in his unreasonable or unseasonable
petitions, as Baals Prophets had of him when he refused to answer or regard
them: for thus he says in his heart, the Lord will neither do good, neither
will he do evil Zeph, 1.^2.
; and, that it is in vain to serve God Mal. 3.14.
.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true Christian imputes to himself the want of answer to his prayers.

He will not charge God foolishly Job. 1.22.
, when he deals most sharply; much less will impute to God what is the fruit
of his own folly. If David be not healed so soon as he desires, and that for
want of cure his wounds be ready to putrify, yet he does not lay the fault
upon God as if he wanted either skill or care, power or love; but he lays all
at his own door; my wounds stink and are corrupt; why? because of my own
foolishness Psalm. 38.5.
; either he was loath to be known of them; he concealed them till Nathan came
and opened them 2 Samuel 12.7
: or he was loath to have them searched to the bottom, till God was faint to
break his bones Psalm. 51.8
, to bring him to it; or the plaster smarted too much and pulled it off too
soon, and so the sore putrified. Whatever was the reason of his mourning, and
waring, he would acquit God, that he might be justified when he speaks, and
cleared when he judges Psalm. 51.4.
.

He examineth what sin it is that stops the passage of his prayers unto God,
or obstructeth the blessing desired. He checketh himself complaining for his
misery, without searching his malady; and calls himself to the bar for Gods
silence. Wherefore does living man complain? what is a man for the punishment of
his sin? Nay, give over this for shame till one thing be done; let us search
and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord Lam. 3.39, 40.
. He therefore diligently enquireth, when God answers not, what want of
repentance, faith, zeal, humility has shut up the doors of Gods treasure, and
restrained the sweet influence of his mercies, who in himself is willing not
only to hear prayer Psalm. 65.2.
, but to prevent him with the blessings of goodness Psalm. 31 3.
.

Not, but that the righteous do sometimes expostulate with the Lord, as the
Church under a great cloud of spiritual desertion, as well as of outward
affliction; Why have thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our
hearts from thy fear Isa 63.17.
? But this they do, not as quarrelling, but as wrestling by further prayer,
Return for thy servants sake the Tribes of thine inheritance Ibid.
. Not as accusing God, but as bemoaning the hardness of their own hearts: not
that God had done less then he owed them, but that they had less grace than
they should, and might have had: not charging him as the Author of their
disease, but lamenting that the Physician had left them: they confess the
sickness to be of their own preparing; but the remedy whether granted, or
delayed, to be only of God, It is an expostulation putting God in mind of his
promise to cure them of the stone of the heart Ezekiel 36.26.
; to put his fear into their hearts that they never more depart from him Jer.
32.40.
; that he may be pleased to make good his word, and to keep those weak
beginnings of goodness sowed in them by his Spirit, in the purpose and
thoughts of their hearts for ever, and to prepare their hearts unto himself 1
Chr. ^9.
; not arguing their impatiency at Gods delay, but lamenting their own iniquity
in procuring the malady, and keeping off the remedy: it is their moan, not
their clamor; their lamentation, not their objurgation: it is rather a wooing
of him, than a chiding; as lovers sometimes expostulate with their loves, the
more to incline them to them.

Thus, this hypocrite is ready to scold at God as Zipporah at her husband Ex.
4.25.26.
, if any thing come from God which he likes not: the true Christian speaks
unto God as Ezra when he saw things prospered not as he had prayed and
expected, Behold we are before thee in our trespasses; for we cannot stand
before thee, because of this Ezra. 9.15.
. The one murmures for not receiving more than bargain, having born the heat
and burden of the day Mat. 20.11, 12.
; when others, who wrought less, received as much as he; the other thinks all
too much, and cries out with David, who am I, O Lord God: and what is my
fathers house, that thou have brought me hitherto 2. Sam. 7.18.
? the one says as that wicked King, Behold, this evil is of the Lord, what
should I wait for the Lord any longer 2 Kings 6.33
; the other says, I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have
sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me Mic.
7.9.
.

This hypocrite, in prayer is altogether against forms, or looks most at
forms.

Either he throws away all forms, or he is more for form then for substance,
for the clothing, then for the body: and more for the body, then for the Spirit
of prayer. The bodily exercise, whether within form, or without, is his
Darling, how void soever of the life and power of the prayer of faith. Not that
every one who uses a form of prayer, is an hypocrite; no more than every one
that prays without a set form, is sincere. There is a difference to be put
between no form at all, and nothing at all but form, either of them may be
naught, neither of them absolutely good, or sufficient.

All forms are utterly hateful unto some spirits, who will have no forms at
all, in whom yet there may be deep hypocrisy. The Spirit of prayer lies not in
a gift to conceive a prayer in our own words according to the occasion, ex
tempore, without all premeditation: although this be an excellent gift,
especially in a Minister, Houshoulder, or other that is to be the mouth of the
company in prayer. But yet such as an hypocrite may attain unto (as well as to
the gift of prophecy) by use, by often hearing of the words and prayers of able
Christians, by reading, memory, and boldness, many become both able to
express their petitions in fit words, and forward (happily too forward) to show
their faculty; being proud to be the mouth of the company, and fitted and
affected more or less according to the company. And from the pride of their
extemporary gift, they easily grow to extravagant and inconsequent petitions,
vain repetitions, and (which is more sinful and dangerous) to a loose and
unreverent boldness with the Lord; so that, praying in company, they either
cool the zeal of the company, or make them afraid to join with them: many of
Gods dear children may want that natural Anamnestes, or art of memory, through
defect of education, use, or constitution; but they have all that spiritual
Remembrancer which at all assaies helps their infirmities Romans 8.26.
and brings to their remembrance whatever is meet to be said unto God.

This hypocrite therefore in praying may conceive a prayer well, without a
setforme, and yet be but formal: yea, and in expressing those conceptions, may
feel some warmth of affections (because pleased with the child of his own
brain;) yea, he may shed tears in prayers, as Esau for the blessing, which
both before and after he despised. Nor is it unlikely, but, while good notions
pass through his head, and good words through his lips, some good motions
also should stir in his heart. But they are but sparks which fly out at the
tunnel of the Chimny that suddenly vanish. So that God may say of them as of
the good words of old Israel, they have well said, all that they have spoken; O
that there were such an heart in them, etc. Deuteronomy. 28.29.
that is, an heart answerable to their tongues, which he knew to be wanting.

Or, on the other extreme, he is all for form, pleasing himself in a form of
words, not because more spiritual, but because more easy and familiar: not
because they better express our wants and desires, but because they suit
better with a carnal heart. Men are loath to be at too much pains to draw up
their petitions, and more unwilling to lay open their hearts too far in a
more particular confession of sins, which general forms will ease them of.
They like well the short prayer of the Publican confessing sin in the general
(although not with his Spirit) God be merciful to me a sinner; but, not to
labor as David in his Penitentials, to lay open particular sins. By this
means it comes to pass, that he repeateth the words of another, without sight
or sense of his own peculiar wants or sins, as many men by often swearing
come to be altogether senseless of the sin; and without spiritual affection to
the thing desired, much more without desiring any thing not mentioned in the
form; for, he accounts it needless, as holding the form, how general and
short soever, to contain as much as he needs to desire.

He that is so superstitiously wedded to this of a form, that he accounts all
other prayer but babbling, declares plainly that he is a stranger at home, and
that he is of opinion that he needs to go no further in searching out his own
sins, than to his Prayer Book; being loath to hear conscience speak in his
ear, much more in the ears of others any more then general failings and
frailties which no man is free from; and, which he thinks he may without
prejudice, more freely confess, it being no more than every one knows by
himself. But (as the Wise man Eccles. 34.17.
, said truly) a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell him more then seven
watchmen that sit above in an high Tower. And let the form be what it will,
he cannot pray for every thing by book: other men's words cannot always
express what he sometimes has most need to crave; normeet with and rip up
those more secret sins that he has need to confess; no nor happily his own
words neither; no nor yet the words prescribed of God, unless he bring a
Spirit to those words, to animate them, and to make them extend to reach all
his wants, by putting under those generals so many particulars as they
naturally comprehend under them, and he has need to enumerate in his prayers,
to make his prayer effectual.

It is an easy matter for the hypocrite to say Abba, Father, with his mouth,
but, as no man can say that as Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost 1 Cor.
12.3.
; as believing it, and receiving benefit by him, so no man can cry Abba,
Father, with faith, feeling, and affection, but he that has received the
Spirit of Adoption enabling him thereunto Romans 8.15.
: The more dextrous and ready therefore, he is in his forms, the further off
he puts spiritual praying, and the Spirit of prayer from him

On the Contrary, the true Christian uses all other things in praying, Differ.
as attendants upon the heart.

He is for the substance and life of the duty, that his prayer may be set forth
before God as incense, in the Censer of faith, and the lifting up of his hands,
by the Spirit of faith, as the evening sacrifice Psalm. 141.2.
, in what manner soever uttered.

He refuses not the help of all forms, especially in public, wherein God
himself had a hand in prescribing them for public use. Aaron had his form of
blessing prescribed Number. 6.23.
. Hezekiah kept the Levites to the Words of David, and of Asaph the Seer; who
sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped Hosea 14.12
; as being spiritually affected therewith, although they kept to those forms.
And even such words, when uttered with the heart, are acceptable calves of the
lips Hosea 14.12
. Yea, and in his more private devotions, if he be slow of speech, unable to
compose a prayer of his own inpertinent expressions and apt method fit for
others to join with him in, he can without scruple, or prejudice make use of
printed or written books that suit best with his occasions and necessities,
and which savor most of the Spirit of prayer in the matter, and composure.
Because this, in time, will bring him to pray in his own words by imitation;
and, in the mean time, furnish him for the exercise of prayer in his family,
or with others, when not fitted to speak before others in his own words, which
yet he makes his own by pouring out his heart with the words he reads, or
hears read unto him: hereby also he holds up the reverence and honor of the
duty: for though God will bear with many soloecismes in the private
closet-prayers of a devout soul; yet unto men, unapt and rude expressions
(although coming from an honest heart) are either tedious, or ridiculous and
occasion their taking of Gods name in vain; as is too often seen in many that
are proud of their own parts. Thereby also is he put in mind of sundry
petitions for private prayers, which of himself he thought not of; to confess
sundry sins which he took no notice of, and to stir up good affections, which
he may the more easily renew in the same or the like words in his secret
devotions.

He uses holy prayer, not as acting a part of wit, memory, or rhetoric, as
cunning beggars that make a trade of begging; but, as a duty, and as a work of
wisdom and grace; and therefore he takes that way wherein he may best glorify
God, and do most good to himself in the due performance of it. If he cannot go
without crutches, he is not ashamed to use them, rather than stumble and fall
by the way.

On the other hand, he tyeth not himself nor the Spirit of God to a stint, or a
form of Words, never to vary upon any occasion. Nay, variety of occasions
necessitate Gods people that would aptly express themselves to God, to vary
their very public forms, as well as more private addresses. For this makes
them expert beggars and prevalent suitors at the throne of grace: for a
Christian having variety of wants and complaints, wants for no suits, and
variety of suits makes him to suit himself accordingly with words, wherein to
put up his petitions; at least in private; or, if not with words, with groans,
that speak, and speak more then other men's words. It is enough to God, if the
heart speak, although the voice be inarticulate. We hear of no words uttered
by Moses, when God cries out unto him, let me alone that I may destroy them
Deuteronomy. 9.14.
. If the Christian do but bray as the heart Psalm. 42.1.
, chatter like the swallow Isa. 38.14.
, pray by sighing, where he can do no more, if the lips do but wag, although
the tongue be not heard, as Hannahs did 1 Samuel 1 13.
, through extremity either of affection or affliction; God hears and
answers. Sometimes his heart longs for something, but he knows not what
(as children that cry, but cannot tell what they ayle) till the Spirit suggest
it, or the Word hit upon it: yet even in this case, he that searches the heart
knows what is the mind of the Spirit Romans 8.26.
; and even before the poor Christian is able to speak, God answers, and
grants the thing even to him that could not speak for himself.

Thus, this hypocrite is more for the mouth than for the heart, for a sound or
form of words, than for the mind of the Spirit; the true Christian is more for
the heart than for the lips: the one keeps a stir about or against words,
the other looks above all things that his prayer [whatever his words be]
proceed not forth of fained lips Psalm. 17.1.
; the one affects the ordering of the voice, the other takes more pleasure in
the melody of the heart. The one is very choice of the cabinet, the other takes
more care of the jewel.

This hypocrite is joylesse in prayer.

He may rejoice to show his faculty, wit, memory, elocution, passion and
earnestness; or, as a man rejoices to pay his rent to his Landlord, when yet
he takes little pleasure in the parting with his money: so he is glad he has
paid God this debt, and that the business is done, rather than because it is
well done. He is more glad he is at the end of his prayer, then when he began
it. Amen, is the best word in it, not because it is the word of his faith, but
the close of his prayer He is more glad of something that follows after, than
of the prayer it self: and he more willingly goes to pray with an eye to that,
than to see him that is Invisible. After prayer, he shall go to dinner, to
play, to bed, therefore is very glad to hear you call to prayers: he comes to
it with all his heart; but it is for the belly, the bones, etc. Food, or rest;
that makes him so willing; not as delighting himself; in God Job. 27.10.
, or as drawing near unto him.

No time comes amiss for those things, wherein we delight: but this hypocrites
delight is in somewhat else which is not to be enjoyed, till prayer be over. He
performs it therefore as a task in reference unto God, but delights in it as a
key to somewhat else he loves better. All men are in part flesh, but the
hypocrite is altogether fleshly, notwithstanding his partaking of some common
graces. Hence prayer and all service of God is a weariness to the flesh, even
in the best. But unto this hypocrite a mere drudgery which were it not for
some other end, he would never be tied unto. And so much unsanctified men, when
they are disposed to speak truth, are content to speak; Behold what a
weariness is it? and ye have snuffed at it, says the Lord of Hosts Mal. 1.13.
. He likes well the Priests allowance, but he has no delight in his work: he
is weary of it, and takes it in snuff to be tied to so much, especially after
so long an an intermission during the Babilonish captivity.

Contrarily, the true Christian prays with delight, Differ:
and joy in the Holy Ghost.

Joy in the Holy Ghost is a principle Territory of the Kingdom of God Romans
14.17
, for the coming whereof, is one of the chief petitions in the Christians
prayer. He therefore must needs with joy draw water; with this bucket of
prayer, out of the wells of salvation Isa. 12.3.
. He must needs joy in that which brings joy unto him, a full joy, a joy that
no man shall take from him. If believing make him to rejoice with joy
unspeakable and full of glory 1 Pet. 1.8.
; Prayer, that brings him into the presence of that God (in whose presence is
fullness of joy Ps. 16.11.
) and brings God into his bosom not only to lean on it, as Christ on John's,
but to enter in and dwell there, must needs make him to joy before God
according to the joy of harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil
Isa. 9.3.
. By this means, the meek shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor
among men shall rejoice in the Holy one of Israel Isa. 29.19.
.

Desires after him whom his soul loves, stirs up prayers, and prayers
obtain satisfaction, and satisfaction procures joy. This brings God and the
Christian together as two lovers, who take pleasure and joy in one another
company; and make the Christian to break out into singing, I love the Lord,
because he has heard the voice of my prayer Ps. 18.1.
. As David, he goes to the house of God with the voice of joy and prayer Psalm.
42 4.
. When he goes to the Altar of God, he looks on him, as his exceeding joy Ps.
43.3.
. He is never well nor merry at heart, but when he is by prayer of faith
conversing with God. I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
where thine honor dwells Ps. 6.8.
. In absence he is restless, my soul thirsts for God, when shall I come and
appear before God Ps. 42.2.
? he has no joy of his life, till prayer have brought God and his soul
together again.

Yea, the time of prayer is the best and sweetest time that the Christian
enjoys on this side heaven. Therefore though he yield to the necessities of
nature, and calling; yet is he sorry that so much time must be spent upon them,
and withdrawn from this exercise of prayer; but glad to think of that day
wherein prayers shall be wholly turned into praises and Hallelujahs for ever.
And although corruption be an heavy enemy to all holy duties but especially to
prayer: yet it is the comfort of his soul that shenow drags corruption in
chains after the triumphant chariot of grace, and he rejoices to think how he
shall leave the body of sin behind him at the entrance of the soul into the
Capitol of glory.

Thus, this hypocrite goes to his prayers, as the Israelites went on their
journey to Canaan, with murmuring and repining; the true Christian accounts of
prayer as the Psalmist of Jerusalem, preferring it above his chief joy Ps.
137.6.
: the one is al'amort, for want of faith to believe that he shall receive any
thing from the Lord: the other is merry, because he knows his prayers cannot
miscarry. The prayers of the one are like Jehoshaphats ships of Tharshish that
were made to go to Ophir for gold, but were broken by the way 1 King. 22.48
; the prayers of the other are like Solomon's Navy that go through with the
voyage; and bring from thence the gold that they went for 1 King. 9.28
. Mo marvail then if the one be joylesse, and the other full of rejoicing.

This hypocrite prays, but without repentance.

He knows that God will never suffer him to plead and reason with him for his
benefit until he has washed and made himself clean by putting away the evil
of his doings Isa. 1.16.
, and that so long as he regards iniquity in his heart, the Lord will not hear
him Ps. 66.18.
. Yet he will adventure to rush into Gods presence with unwashen hands and
heart, without remorse or godly for sin, even when in a formal manner he
confesses it sorrow While he confesses it, he loves it and when he asks
pardon of it, he is unwilling to forsake it; when then will this man find mercy
Prove. 28.13.
? And, although it be a maxim in reason and nature unknown scarce to any that
God hears not sinners. Yet sometimes he grows so impudent, that he will
steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, etc Joh 9 21.
. (so he can do it closely and not be discovered) and come and stand before God
in his house Jer. 7.9.
, and thinks that by a few prayers he can wipe his mouth Prove. 30.20.
so clean, that no man shall be able to say this is the man that has done
these abominations: Thus he comes to the house of prayer, to make it a den of
thieves Mat. 21.13.
; a sty of swine and unclean beasts, a kennel of dogs; a brothel house! the
voice of prayers sounds ill in the mouth of a swearer, drunkard, liar, etc.
yet, who so seemingly devout and diligent at Church, and so affectedly zealous
of attending upon the public prayers of the Church as those wretches who are
so lewd and vile as all civil men shun their society, as fitter rather to
keep company with beasts and swine then with men, professing godliness.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian dares not look God in the face without
confessing, and forsaking his sin.

He never adventures into Gods presence, but he first sits down and considers
what the Lord requires of him. He finds that he must wash and cleanse himself
from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, or he will find a sour welcome from
him that is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. He therefore resolves, I
will search and try my ways, and then make his address to God Lam 3.40.
. I will wash mine hands in innocence, and then, will I compass thine Altar O
Lord Ps. 26.6.
. He is not a God that has pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell
with him Ps. 5 4.
. Therefore he seeks by all means to bath himself in the savor of Christ's
blood and to use all possible endeavors to be freed from his sins and to keep
himself from his iniquity, that God may not reject his prayers.

Not that he can hope to be absolutely freed, as to be able to say he has no
sin remaining in him (which, whosoever says, has the ly 1 John 1.8.
given him by the God of truth;) but, he does not willingly retain it as a
sweet morsel under his tongue; he does not hide, but discover it; he does not
beg the life of it, but desires the speedy death of it, and cries out as a man
undone, until he be delivered from the body of this death. It is one thing for
a man to carry about him a sore which he cannot wholly be cured of after all
means used to heal it; another, to lap it up and let it fester wilfully not
suffering any hand to cleanse or touch it. He lays open his grief, he seeks
cure, omits no means, lays hold on all opportunities: and this makes him
capable of access to, and acceptance with God.

Thus, this hypocrite like Naaman likes well of Gods mercy, and earnestly
craves it, but he hopes God will wink at his bowing down in the house of Rimmon
2 King. 5.18
, will take no notice of his petty oaths, secret frauds, adulteries,
covetousness, etc. The true Christian deals with his most beloved lusts, as
both people and Priests were to do with the sin-offering, bringing it before
the Lord, and laying his hands upon it and kill it, and dip his fingers in the
blood thereof Lev. 4.4, etc.
; the one hardens his heart in sin, and falls into mischief Prove. 28.14.
, the other confesses and forsakes his sin, and so finds mercy.

This hypocrite prays without affiance.

And this must needs be so, seeing he prays without repentance. How can he
cast himself upon God, that will not cast off his iniquity? Sin lies like a
great gulf between God and the sinner, as between Abraham and Dives; affiance
is the highest act of faith, impenitency the strongest argument of infidelity.
How then can he place affiance in him, with whom evil shall not dwell? Hence it
comes to pass that the sinners in Zion are afraid, instead of trusting in God;
why? they cannot apprehend him as a God reconciled, as a Father, but as a
devouring fire, as an everlasting burning, with whom they have no hope to dwell
Isa. 33.14.
, but to be consumed by him.

The same force that lust has to draw men from obedience, unto sin, the same
power the hypocrite will surely find it to have to keep him off from trusting
in God in his greatest need of rolling himself wholly upon the Lord, neither
can the prayers of the righteous, no not of Noah; Daniel, or Job, stand this
wretch in any stead Ezekiel. 4.14
. For as the Lodestone rubbed with Garlic loses his attractive virtue, so
prayer tainted with the rank savor of a rotten heart cannot draw any mercy
from the God of mercy. The foul wide mouth of sin outcries the voice of
prayer uttered by the most righteous man on their behalf, makes deaf the ears
of mercy Jer. 7.16.
.

Contrarily, the true Christians prayer is the voice of faith. Differ.


His faith first sues out a pardon, and then outcries all his sins. Faith
takes livery and seisin of the purchase Christ made for the penitent sinner,
and then by the manuduction of the same Christ, it leads him into the presence
of God with confidence and boldness. It makes him go boldly to the throne of
grace, whereby he finds grace to help in time of need Heb 4.16.
. It enters into that which is within the veil Heb. 6.19.
, even into Christ himself.

Therefore if he begin his prayers with weeping, as Jacob Hosea 12.4.
; if he have mingled his drink with his tears, as the afflicted, when he is
overwhelmed, and pours out his complaint before the Lord Psalm. 102.9.
; yet so often as he sows in tears, he reapes in joy Psalm. 126 5.
.

He that begins his prayer with how long will thou forget me Psalm. 13.1.
? closes thus, I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt bountifully
with me ver. 6.
: What makes him so suddenly to change his note? this, I have trusted in thy
mercy, my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation ver. 5.
. If at sometimes he makes his bed to swim, and waters his couch with his
tears Ps 6.7.
; the next news we hear of him is an (...), or a song of triumph, Depart from
me all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping,
the Lord has heard my supplication, etc. ver 89.
His tears are tears of faith, as well as of repentance that soak the soil
of divine mercy to make it yield more plentifully to his afflicted soul. He may
go forth weeping, but he bears precious seed, therefore he shall doubtless
come again with rejoicing, and bring his sheaves with him Psalm. 126.6.
. He has no sooner ended his prayer (which he laid in water) but immediately
he receives what he prays for, either in fruition, or in certain
expectation; if not in kind, yet in exchange and to advantage, because he
trusts God with his prayers.

Thus, this hypocrite is like an unwise Archer that shootes away his prayers
without expectation of ever finding them again; the true Christian sends his
faith, as Jonathan did his boy, to gather up all the arrows 1 Samuel 20.38
, which he shootes, and to bring them to his master. The one fisheth all night,
and catches nothing, because he goes a fishing without Christ: the other no
sooner, at Christ's command, exercises his faith as the plummet, to sink the
net of his prayer, to make a draught, but he encloseth a multitude of fishes
Luke 5.46.
; blessing in abundance beyond expectation; or prayers.

This hypocrite oft-times restrains prayer.

He seems in the general to be much for it, but he oft-times stifles it in the
birth. He offends as much in the measure, as in the manner of his praying. He
casts off fear, and restrains prayer before God. That is true of this
hypocrite, although unjustly charged upon Job Job. 15.4.
the word From (...) imminuit detraxit, restrinx it.
signifies the withholding or diminishing of that which would abound; as,
where it is said, he makes small the drops of water Job. 36.27
; that is, he restrains that plenty of rain that otherwise would fall like a
Cataclys, or as whole rivers at once, causing an inundation like that of the
Deluge, when the windows of heaven were opened and the fountains of the great
deep broken up Ger. 7.11.
.

He not only neglects occasions and opportunities of prayer, especially in
secret (which he cares little for,) but also checketh and suppresseth many
motions thereunto in his own heart; or, if he give any way thereunto, it is
with an unwillingnesse; with laying hands upon the movings of his spirit that
they may not exceed some short come-off with God, as men that care not how few
words they use to them, of whom they are weary. Sometimes he is for
superfluity of words, so that he runs out into vain repetitions, not only
unto tediousness, but even unto nauseousnesse or loathing, as the Heathens,
who think to be heard for their much speaking Mat. 6.5.
, as the Prophets of Baal from morning even until noon 1 Kings 18.26
. But this is in public, that he may be seen of men Mat. 6.5.
; but in private he is short enough. He is not so long in the one, but he is as
brief, even to quenching of the Spirit, in the other. But this is, one of those
adversaries of which God will ease himself, and one of those enemies of which
he will be avenged Isa. 1.24.
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian pours out his soul unto God.

This is not only David's practice, I pour out my soul in me Ps. 42.3.
; but his precept to others, pour out your hearts before him Ps. 62.8.
. He does not mince the breathings of his soul, and suppress them, as he did
from good words while the wicked were before him Psalm. 39.1.
, until he could hold no longer, but lays open to God all his heart at once.
All my desire is before thee Ps. 38.9.
. He concealeth nothing, suppresseth nothing, opens all the windows of his
soul, breaks up the fountain of that great deep, that nothing shall be
restrained or diminished. As a man opens all his heart to his friend, imparts
to him dulcia atque amara, all his sweets and bitters, that he may rejoice with
him for the one, and pity and pray for him by reason of the other; so the
Christian acquaints God with the sour as well as with the sweet part of his
condition, afflictions as well as comforts, wants as well as blessings,
corruptions as well as thanksgivings, with humiliation as well as rejoicing. He
is afraid to scant God in prayer (especially when the Spirit of prayer jogs him
by the elbow) lest God abridge him in his graces and comforts; or, that his
enemies should exceed him in devotion, and that God should hear their bawling
to his prejudice.

Thus, this hypocrite is as those that swallowed up the needy by making the
Ephah small, and the shekel great Amos. 8.5.
, letting God have as little of his prayers as he can, for his money; for the
mercies he bestows: the true Christian is as they who give good measure,
pressed down, shaken together, and running over Luke 6.38.
; so pours he his prayers into Gods bosom: the one prays, as the niggard
gives, and receives accordingly; the other prays as the beggar, he opens
his mouth wide, and God fills it Ps 81.10.
.

This hypocrite at other times, exceeds measure in his praying.

When nothing is (in his account) to be gotten by his prayers (as what thinks
he shall I get by praying long in secret, where no body sees me, nor minds
me?) he is short enough, as we saw but now. But when either affectation to be
seen of men, or his belly, avarice, and an heart exercised with covetous
practices, call forth his prayers, there he needs rather a gag than a raw
egg; If any body will take notice of him, applaud him for his excellent gift
in prayer, and point after him and say, this is he: he will then wyre-draw his
prayers, pump for words, even unto vain repetitions, in the Synagogue, streets,
marketplace, any where, every where, if company flock about him Mat 6.5.
. If he mean to make a gain of his devotion, away he gets to some rich widow
or other women of estates, and there he will be very devout, frequent, fervent,
large in prayer: this is not his main business there, he aims at somewhat
else, by causing her either to spend upon him, or to give unto him, so long
till she want it her self. He devoures widows houses, and for a pretense
makes long prayers Mat. 23.14.
.

And, indeed all prayers of the hypocrite are long, too long, although never so
brief: either, because the words out-go or go without the heart; there, even
two words are too many: when men draw near to God with their mouths and lips,
but with their hearts are far from him Isa. 29.13.
. Or when men repeat the same things over and over again, to make up the talee
of their prayers; as Papists, their Ave-Maries, and Pater-Nosters, by fives,
sevens, and tens, or any other number, prescribed by their Priests to their
ignorant and superstitious Devoto's, that think they have abundantly served
God, and merited too, by saying their prayers (which they understand not)
until they have run them up to such a number. This is not Christian but
Heathenish Mat. 6.7. (...).
; Or when prayer is so long continued, that other necessary duties are
curtailed, yea thrust out. As some seem very zealous for the public prayers to
be read all at length, even when both the Sacraments happen to be administered
at the same time. Nothing must be left out of the prayers, for the Sermon: but
rather let the Sermon stand by, or be abbreviated; not that this hypocrite is
so much in love with prayer, but because out of love with preaching, that
sometimes flies at his bosom and takes his lusts by the throat. Such were
those Heretics of old called, Euchitae, tantum orant, alias otiosi August. de
Haeres. cap. 57.
. Only they pray: otherwise are ilde beasts. And such the Monks at this day
who profess to do nothing but pray.

Contrarily, the true Christian measures his prayers by his affection.

He considers not how many words he utters, but with what heart; not so much
the smoke that goes out at the top of the Chimney, as what fire and fuel there
is on the hearth. If occasion requires he can enlarge; if necessity call for
abridgement he can contract. Not the voice, but the heart makes the music in
Gods ear, and in his own esteem too: if these go together, he sticks not at
length.

Non sunt longa, quibus nihil est, quod demere possis Mart.
.
That is never too long, that has nothing too much.
His heart having first begun the work, words are seldom wanting, especially
to an experienced Christian, an old disciple: but yet he had rather want words,
than matter; and both than spirit: he is not curious of his words, but careful
of his heart; Nor will he let the Mill go longer, than the heart affords water
enough to drive it, although he shut down much sooner than he intended, to
prevent hurt and damage to himself. He prays soberly and reverently, as to a
wise and mighty God, remembering that of Solomon, Be not rash with thy mouth,
and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in
heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few Eccles. 5.2.
. that is, no more than he has well weighed, and finds to be acceptable to
God and to obedient ears.

He uses prayer to sanctify other duties, not to exclude them: to draw down a
blessing upon them, not to deprive himself or others of them. Prayer fitteth
him better for every other duty; and every duty duly performed fitteth him
better for further prayer. Therefore he exercises himself unto all duties,
that by their joint force and mutual assistance, he may gain the more, and go
on with more comfort. Christ had his times for Duties, for praying as well as
preaching, for preaching as well as praying. He prayed much, yet he did not
only pray. In the evening he went to the Mount of Olives to pray; and early in
the morning, returned into the Temple to preach. The Christian therefore will
sometimes abbreviate his prayers, at least vocal: not that he may withdraw
himself from God, but that he may perform duties to men.

Thus, this hypocrite is found with the scant measure that is abominable Mica.
6.10.
; even in the measuring of the things of God, and thereby scanteth, yea robs
both God and man of their due proportions, the true Christian observes his
rule even in these things as well as in other matters; he will do no
unrighteousness in mete-yard, in weight or in measure Lev. 19.35.
. The one seeking himself, measures all corn by his own bushel; the other,
seeking the good of many that they may be saved, brings all to the standard of
the Sanctuary: the one cares not who suffers, so he may please himself, the
other pleases his neighbor for his good unto edification Romans 15.2.
; the one prays, as some preach Christ, even of envy and strife, the other
does both of good will Phil 1 15.
.

This hypocrite is not for prayer always.

He will pray when he sees his own time. He will stint God in time, as well as
in measure. He will be master, not only of his own time, but of Gods too; When
will the Sabbath be gone Amos 8.5.
? Sometimes he will delight himself in the Almighty: but, will he always call
upon God Job. 27.10.
? Every one that knows him, can make the answer for him, no, he will not:
especially, in secret, where none but Gods eye can behold him. Upon some
extraordinary occasions, in extraordinary cases he may seem very devout. But he
is modest, he will not trouble God too far, nor too often, Ahaz will not ask
a sign, even when God bids him, lest he should tempt the Lord Isa. 7.12.
; A great piece of modesty in show; but a sure symptom of infidelity. He would
not ask a sign, because he could not believe the thing; not to avoid troubling
of God, but himself. He seems very mannerly, but shows himself very malapert.

Or, if he pray at set-times; they are for the most part times of his own, or
of man's setting: and beyond that you cannot drive him. In a Lent, especially
upon a Good Friday, he has a great praying fit upon him, which is no better
then Saul's fit of prophecy. He is then mighty devout, he could then find in
his heart to out strip a very Papist. But take him out of that mood, and you
shall never find him so again, till the same time come about anew. He
considers not that there are times and seasons wherein God will be found, as
there was a time wherein, Saul (had he had eyes to see it) might have been
established in the Kingdom: but that being let slip, there will after no place
be found for repentance in God, to give such another opportunity. Thus as
negligent Suitors lose their mollissima tempera fandi, their best opportunities
of speeding, and therefore never speed, so this hypocrite misseth of the
acceptable time, of the day of salvation wherein God might be found, because he
will never come at God but when himself pleases. God waits to be gracious
Isa. 30.18.
, and he ungraciously sleighteth all that waiting Prove. 1.30.
. Therefore, in the floods of great waters he shall not come nigh unto him
Psalm. 32 6.
.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian prays continually.

He is not an Euchite, a praying Heretic, whose whole Religion and work is to
do nothing but pray: for he that so does, never prays. Evangelical duties are
subordinate: and they are more than one. He that sets them by the ears is an
enemy to them all. Every duty has its time, place, and season. He that so
takes up one as to exclude another, does not take them up to serve Christ, but
to oppose him. There is preaching for the Minister, hearing for the people (and
he that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, his prayer shall be
abominable Prove. 28.9.
); meditation for both 1 Timothy 4.5. Psalm. 12.
. There is a laboring with the hands the things that is good 2 These. 3.11.
; and many other duties are incumbent on Christians as well as this of prayer.
Therefore he is not here tied never to do other, but never to omit this in its
proper season.

Negative precepts require perpetual actual observance at all times, they admit
of no intermission because sin forbidden is at no time lawful: but
Affirmatives bind only to the times and seasons proper for them. Then they are
done always, when done in their seasons. He omitteth none of the set-times and
seasons of prayer, public, or private. There are certa tempora orandi;
set-times of prayer, as Augustine speaks De haeres. c. 57
; which if not fixed, men will soon neglect the duty; and if not observed, in
vain are they appointed. To observe days and times Gal 4.10.
, as placing Religion in that observation, is Superstition and Will Worship;
yet, not to ty our selves to some times wherein we will pray, is Irreligion:
For this makes us loose and careless of the duty, posting it off from time to
time, till no time be left to perform it. At morning, evening, and at noon
were David's set times, wherein he would pray and cry aloud Ps. 55.17.
. Besides which, as occasions were offered, he had his extraordinaries,
sometimes at midnight Ps. 119 62.
; Yea, sometimes, seven times a day ver. 164.
; Daniel, three times a day Dan. 6.10.
. Our Lord besides his daily devotions in ordinary, spent whole nights in
prayer.

He prays all manner of prayer, sometimes he takes to him words Hos. 14 2.
, sometimes his spirit prays when the tongue is silent, when his thoughts and
desires are sent up unto God, even while he seems to be doing another thing;
short ejaculations in the midst of business, as old Jacob while he was
blessing his sons, takes breath as it were with this short expression, I have
waited for thy salvation, O Lord Genesis 49.18.
. As Nehemiah, while he was in conference with the King prayed to the God of
heaven Neh. 2.4.
; and as Moses while he exhorted the people to cast themselves upon God with
faith and constancy, cried unto the Lord on their behalf Ex. 14.15.
.

He prays always, as not being weary, or fainting in his mind, even when he
does not presently receive an answer to his mind. Although the Lord do not
presently appear in granting his petition, yet he knows that importunity will
at last prevail even with unjust men Luke 18.1.
; much more with the faithful God: therefore minding of the parable of his
Lord, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint ver. 1.
, He will pray, and wait, and watch, and pray again, until he receive an
answer of his prayers. He will not only direct his prayer unto God, but he will
look up Psalm. 5.3.
as a man that looks after the arrow that he has shot out of his bow. Yea, if
God be in a way of judgment, yet even in the way of his judgments will he
wait for him Isa. 26.8.
, observing and serving his providence in every change of it, never giving over
till he has obtained grace to help in time of need.

Thus, he prays always as a suitor at Court, who does not deliver a new
petition every moment, yet is a constant petitioner until his business be
dispatched. He is ever in Gods way, stands in his eye; and, by his very
countenance and carriage, lets God understand plainly enough what he would
have, and what he waits for; and therefore is never out of mind, nor without
hope of a blessing, which is there, and not elsewhere to be found. He is grown
expert and skilful by his waiting, when to take his opportunities of time and
place to advance his suit both for spirituals, and temporals. His wants are
continual, he must have daily bread, pardon of sin daily, he is every hour
subject to many evils and tentations, therefore he prays daily, and never
gives over at least in his heart and affections, in his thoughts and
ejaculations, in his frame of spirit to the duty, and in the actual performance
of it upon all occasions and opportunities: so that longer than he is praying,
he is out of his element, he is not himself. Thus by prayer he walks with
God, as Enoch; he is ever in his way, and eye: no gracious opportunity can
escape him.

Thus, this hypocrite will serve God only by fits and starts, when he list
himself: the true Christian serves him at all times without intermissions or
out-lips. The one prays as Mariners at Sea in a storm, but the storm being
over their devotion is at an end; the other is as aged Anna the Prophetess,
who served God with fasting and prayer day and night Luke 2.37.
; the one prays not at all, because he prays not always, the other prays
always (although he do many things beside) because he neglects no
opportunity of praying.

This hypocrite if he pray in adversity, he casts off prayer in prosperity.

He never troubles God, but when God troubles him. In health, wealth, peace, he
can comfort himself. He never prays but in trouble: in his affliction he will
seek God early Hos 5.15.
. God is feign to go away and return to his place, else this man would never
look after him. When God has touched him, he acquaints God with his misery,
but when times grow better with him, he excludes God from his mirth. He is of
the mind of Ajax in the Tragedy; with God, a coward can overcome; but, a
valiant man may do it, without God. He makes use of God, as of a doubtful
friend: if he be in any great extremity, and can make no other shift, God shall
then hear of him; he will try what God will do for him at a dead lift; as
Mariners in a storm; as the Israelites that could stand it out no longer, when
he slew them, then they sought him Ps 71.34.
: so will he, not before, nor yet after; but hardens his heart as Pharaoh, so
soon as the plague is over.

Most men in sickness and in distress run to God for cure, that at other
times have no remembrance of him. When they would have him to do any thing for
them, that none else can: then they come about him as the young man in the
Comedy; O mi Pater! but, deserve to be answered as he was, Quid mi Pater? quasi
tu hujus indigeas Patris. What do you come now with my Father, in your mouth?
as if forsooth you wanted this poor old man, whom you have so long scorned. So
God will answer those who scrape acquaintance with him in their troubles, and
hang about him in their misery for deliverance, as sometimes the Prophet
answered the King of Israel coming to enquire of him; Go to the Prophets of thy
Father, and to the Prophets of thy mother 2 King. 3.13.
. They run to God in extremity, who afterward think of him, as a woman past
childbearing of a midwife, as a lusty youth of a Physician; and, of prayer, as
of a potion. Thus this hypocrite through the pride of his countenance, in his
prosperity, will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts Ps. 10.4.
: therefore, no more will he be in Gods, when his hand is gone out against him.
He will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear comes Prove. 1.26.
.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian prays more, and more fervently in
prosperity, than in adversity.

Prayer is not only his support in trouble, but his delight in triumph. In
affliction he prays, for his comfort; in prosperity, for the sanctification
of it. He sees as great cause of returning to Christ, after healing, to give
thanks, as there was at first to come to him for cure. He is as willing to
acknowledge a debt, as to receive a favor: and to do his homage, where he
cannot satisfy his rent. All the ten Lepers were hasty to come for cure; but
only one (by Nation a Samaritan, but in heart an Israelite) came back to give
glory to God Luk 12.15.
. He knows that prayer is ordained not only to procure good to himself, but
to give honor to God Ps. 50.15.
. Therefore he willingly offers those voluntary and votary sacrifices, which
the hypocrite withholdeth, when his need is over.

If he never prayed in earnest, till he was in a strait, as Manasse, and the
Prodigal that had not God whipped them home, would never have come of themselves;
yet though he began then, he will not end there. If he never poured out a
prayer to his God till his chastening was upon him: It is because he was not
before converted. Sometimes his life as a Christian, begins in praying, as a
child's in crying: so did Saul's (who afterward was called Paul) to whom God sent
Ananias to comfort him, and that upon this account, for behold he prays Act.
9.11.
. Affliction may make some Christians take up prayer, but then grace will never
suffer them to lay it down again: His resolution is, I will sing unto the Lord
as long as I live, I will sing praise to my God while I have my being; my
meditation of him shall be sweet, I will be glad in the Lord Ps. 104.33, 34.


Thus, this hypocrite in adversity, is a flatterer; flattering God with his
mouth Ps. 78.36.
; in prosperity, a scorner: joining in his heart with those that dare tell God
to his head, We are Lords, we will come no more to thee Jer. 2.31.
: the true Christian is as David, the more God exalts him, the more he
exalts God, saying unto God that has showed him light; thou art my God and I
will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee Ps. 118.28.
; the one in time of his trouble will say unto God, arise and save us Jer. 2.27.
; and, when he is saved, says, depart from us; what can the Almighty do for us
Job. 22.17.
. the other says, after deliverance given, as Hezekiah, The Lord was ready to
save me, therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instrument, all the
days of our life in the house of the Lord Isa. 38.20
.

This hypocrite, if he pray in prosperity, he will not do it in adversity.

Sometimes he prays in adversity, but then he will not pray in prosperity: on
the other side, he sometimes prays in prosperity, but then he refuses to
pray in adversity. He will never come up to both. He is but almost a Christian;
and therefore cannot be entire in duty. What he will do, he will do. If God
require more, he must do it himself, if he will have it done.

This hypocrite out of self-love, may have some kind of tenderness toward
God, and relenting for his hard opinion of him in former times, through
apprehension of Gods supposed love, which he gathers from these outward things
that are so sweet and savoury to him, and loved dearly by him; therefore he
cannot but take it kindly that God is so liberal to him: upon which account he
may be in some sort thankful for what he has, and go to God for more. But in
adversity he thinks the Lord deals hardly with him, and handles him too
roughly: therefore he cries not, when he binds him Job 36.13
. He returns not to him that smites him neither does he seek the Lord of
Hosts Isa 9.13
. The rods put him out of love with the hand that uses it, and makes him
really to do what Satan (who knew the nature of hypocrites, but understood not
the power of grace) undertook Job should do, namely to curse him to his face
Job 1.11
. So that wretch, in a time of extreme famine, Behold this evil is of the Lord,
why should I wait on the Lord any longer 2 Kings 6.33
?

So, in trouble of conscience (which to the hypocrite is his first taste of
hell) he is scared away, as Cain from the presence of God, who fell to building
of Cities Genesis 4.17
to put the curse out of his mind: In a word, instead of praying there is no
voice comes from him, but that of murmuring and quarrelling, as if Gods ways
were not equal, or just: like the vassals of Antichrist, who gnawed their
tongues, and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their
sores, but repented not of their deeds Rev. 16.10
.

The hypocrite when he is at ease and has nothing to disturb or discourage
him, may by some helps of education, natural parts, common illumination, and
meditation, make a shift to pray, and that eloquently, and aptly, to the
admiration of many that hear him, yet without the spirit and life of prayer;
But when the floods of great waters come, then he fails. Prayer indeed is a
spiritual work, but is many times done carnally. He brings the body of the
sacrifice, and is his crafts-master in killing and dressing it, and laying the
several parts and pieces in due order upon the Altar, but he wants fire to burn
and consume it: at least, he wants the fire of the Sanctuary. It is strange
fire, if any, that he puts to his sacrifice, and so it cannot be acceptable to
God by Jesus Christ: It is a fire kindled by a burning glass in the summer of
prosperity; not fire from heaven, that will keep in, in the winter of
tribulation. Differ:


Contrarily, the true Christian prays as well in woe, as in weal.

He draws water with a double-bucket, whereof the one is going down while the
other is coming up. If one be coming up in his prosperity, the other is going
down into the wells of salvation in his greatest extremity. And although the
ill natured child, and the bastard, the hypocrite runs away when he is beaten,
as fearing his father more than he loves him, yet the true child of God submits
to his fathers correction, even when he uses most severity. Not fainting when
rebuked of him Heb. 12.5.
, much less running from him. Correction diminishes not his love and duty,
but rather adds more filial fear and reverence thereunto; making him no less
natural, but more respective; nor less serviceable, but more diligent; no
less confident of Gods favor, but more careful to recover and keep it. In his
affliction he will seek God early Hos. 5.15
and ply him with most diligence.

Affliction therefore is noted as a special time and occasion laid hold upon by
a child of God to pray. Is any afflicted? let him pray? As if prayer were never
more in season then when God not only lays on troubles, but goes away and
hides his face: Then is his child most earnest to seek him, not giving over
till he has not only found him, but overcome him by his prayers and tears:
then is he most forward, most hopeful, filling heaven with the sighs of his
heart, till his heart come to befilled with heavenly comforts.

Thus, this hypocrite shows himself a Bastard, because he will not endure
chastisement whereof all are partakers Heb 12.8
, without running away from God; the true Christian never shows himself more
to be a son in keeping close to his father, than when he is under the rod: the
one is stubborn, and will not bow, and therefore is broken Isa. 1.5
; the other is ducible, kisseth the rod, and therefore is healed Hos. 6.1
.

This hypocrite when he prays, affects most to do it in public, and in the
view of others.

Although the place of prayer seems not to be much material in it self, since
the hour now is, and long has been, that neither in that mountain, or parcel
of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph (in which the Samaritans often
worshipped Joh. 4.20 with ver. 5.
) nor at Jerusalem; (which God himself made the place of worship for a time)
are Christians tied to worship God; but Gods will is, that men pray every
where; provided that they lift up holy hands, without wrath and doubting 1 Timothy
2.8.
: yet, as this hypocrite orders the matter, the places he prays in, will be
very material to show his difference from the true Christian.

He is little short of Balaam in the choice of his places to offer sacrifice.
An high hill (although one of the high places of Baal) from whence he may see
the utmost part of the people Number. 22.41
; and they him, is in his opinion, the fittest place for his devotion. Number. 23.1
. If that will not do it, the top of Pisgah, may ver. 14
. If he have not company enough to witness his devotions in the Synagogue, he
will out into the Corners of the streets, where men can pass no way but they
must take notice of him. These are the places wherein his soul delights: he
loves to pray standing in the Synagogues, and at the corners of the streets
that he may be seen of men Mat. 6.5
. And, to be seen the better, he will rather stand, then kneel before the Lord
his Maker Psalm. 95.6
. For which purpose, kneeling in prayer is almost out of fashion. He is content
to leave behind him, in all places tokens of his jollity, or sinful delights
Wis. 2.9
; but not of his piety: the highest and most frequented Theater is his stage
for that. He reserveth his goodness for company, for some special company, as
men do their best clothes. It is too much for him to be good in private or
alone. For, either,

He has no special or secret errand to the Lord, which none can utter, nor
must know, but God and himself. He pretends that he has nothing to say to God,
but he cares not who hears it. He has no secret sins that he means to rip
up, no particular wants that he is willing to be known of, no special graces
that he cares to be a suitor for. He has enough for the Market, and can set
face good enough upon his public devotions. Therefore public audience is
enough for him. If he may be heard as others, or for others, and fare as they
do (as the ignorant Papists) it is all he seeks. More would but put him to
more labor, which he likes not. Or,

He is afraid of God, if with Jacob, he come to him alone Genesis 32.24
. Ten to one but there will be a wrestling, that will end in making him to halt
ver. 31.
. Although he has no private business with God, yet he is afraid God has
some special controversy with him Mic. 6.2.
, and will plead with him more than he is willing to hear of. He knows how he
has carried himself toward God, and what God knows by him; and that it is
terrible for such an one as he is to look God in the face, and to give a
particular account of his doings to such a prying Judge, at a private
enter-view and conference. Yea, he finds conscience her self within him, ready
to rack him on Gods behalf, and to set his secret sins (as well as those that
are more open) in order before him.

And, if after all this, he do so steel his heart and face, as to give God a
meeting in private: he is in little ease till he be dismissed. He is never well
till the conference be ended, the action over, and he, in other company, to put
all that God spoke to him at that meeting, out of his mind. And seeing praying
cannot (for he resolves it shall not) make him weary of sinning, he will so
use the matter that sinning shall make him weary of praying.

Nor is it his meaning to refuse or put by all private prayers, in
down-righttermes; but, he is for the public prayers of the Church, as being
much better, and more acceptable to God, then the private devotions of a few
particular men. He would not have you think that he waveth private prayers out
of fear, but rather chooses the public out of judgment. Thus many men love
to make comparisons between public and private prayers, that truly care for
neither; yet they do it, to shift their hands off that which they care least
for. And many times both are best reconciled when they agree to throw off both.
And indeed, seldom do hot sticklers in such a controversy get good by either.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true Christian delights to meet God in private.

He is no enemy, no neglecter of public prayer. He stays not in his house,
or study until the public prayers be over, as thinking he can be better
employed; Nay, he is glad when any say unto him, let us go into the house of
the Lord Ps. 122.1.
, he will pay his vows to the Lord (which the hypocrite will make, but not
pay) in the presence of all his people Ps 116 14.
. He will give thanks unto God in the great congregation, and praise him among
much people Ps. 31 18.
; Yea, he will invite others, and say, come ye, and let us go up into the
mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob ^sa. 2.35.
. But, he contenteth not himself with public performances. Therefore being to
pray, he first enters into his closet, and shuts the door Mat. 6 6.
. Yea, he communeth with his own heart upon his bed Ps. 4.4.
. This makes him fitter for the public; hereby, God prepares his heart to
pray, that he may cause his own ear to hear Ps. 10.17.
. Hither also does he resort, afterward to harrow in more effectually the good
seed that has been sown in public.

Prayer in general, distinguishes a professor from persons openly profane. For
they who call upon the Name of the Lord, are Saints by calling. Private prayer
excludes the hypocrite before men (for scarce will any man pray ordinarily in
private, that prays to be seen of men;) but only hearty and spiritual prayer,
excludes the hypocrite before God: and this makes the sincere Christian
accepted where ever he performs it.

To him all the world is Gods house, and every house an house of prayer, every
closet a Chamber of presence, and every place a Temple for spiritual worship.
Therefore he will not be tied to solemn places or times, but takes the
advantage of all for promoting his suites. He that has an earnest suit,
waits not, till the King sit down in the chair of state, but watches where
he may soonest come at him, and delivers his petition where ever he meets
him. So the Christian who is more for seriousness than solemnity, preferres
his prayer where ever God can be found. He has some suites to move to the Lord
where ever he meets him.

But, as Queen Esther, in that special suit, singled out the King and Haman, at
a private Banquet in her own house Esther 5.
, that she might there have greater liberty of speaking her mind in particular
(which perhaps had not been so fit, in public) and better opportunity of
making the King her friend, against so potent an enemy; and, lest one
invitation and entertainment should prove too little to carry so great a
business, she takes the same course again cap. 7.
; so this Christian is careful to invite the Lord again and again home to his
house, to a secret Parley, where he has his petition ready to emplore his
favor against some special corruption, or temptation, perhaps (as some
diseases, in some parts of the body) not so fit to be particularly mentioned in
public; and, as in case of life and death, to plead against his special sin,
and tell God boldly to the face of his lust, the adversary and enemy is this
wicked Haman Est. 6.7.
. This pride, this envy, this secret murmuring, this unclean lust, this
earthly-mindednesse, this hardness of heart, etc.

He is not content to see or meet the King with others in public shewings of
himself, but he must be as Hushai, the Kings companion 1 Chr. 27.33
; his friend, as Abraham Jam. 2.23.
; his favorite as John to Christ, and our Savior allows it to all his
obedient disciples, I have called you not servants, but friends Joh. 15.15
. He has no intimate acquaintance with God that has not somewhat to speak in
his ear, and to pour into his bosom, which all must not hear, and which the
Minister himself cannot hit upon. Therefore he redeemeth times and
opportunities, and divides the times of surcease from outward labors, that he
may have some for heavenly meditation and prayer in secret, as well as for his
bodily food, and rest.

If he be a servant, he is glad of the night, not only as the end of his work,
but as affording opportunity to pray privately to his best friend, and dearest
love: and to take up his song in the night Psalm. 77.6
. If lovers cannot come together by day, how hard soever they have wrought all
day long, and how narrowly soever they be watched, they will make an hard shift
to steal an opportunity of meeting in the night, when others are in bed and
fast asleep. Nor will the Christian-servant be behind in this, his soul
desires his God in the night, and with his spirit will he seek him early Isa.
26.9
. By night upon his bed will he seek him whom his soul loves Cant. 3.1
. And if he find him not there, he will get up, and go about the City, he will
adventure a taking by the Watch; yea, a beating too, for Christ, rather than
not find him Cant. 5.7
.

He is glad of solitariness, after the manner of lovers too: therefore he
shunneth, not only ill company at all times, but also good company at some
times: because all company, less or more hinders him from private enjoying of
his beloved. He can make use of any place to converse with God; of a mountain,
as Christ of Mount Olives, Moses of Mount Nebo; and, of the housetop, as
Peter; not as being nearer heaven, or out of superstition, but as more remote
from company and distraction, and so more elevated above the world; and to see
the Hill, as a finger pointing him to heavenward. He can also do as much in a
Dungeon, as Joseph^, Paul, Silas and others. Every place where his heart has a
sacrifice ready, and fit for God, is to him an Altar to offer it upon. For he
ever carries about him a super-altare, which is his faith, that will enable
Abel to offer a better sacrifice in the wide field, then Cain, in the house
Heb. 11.4
.

Thus, this hypocrite is glad of pnblick prayer, to avoid private, as a man is
to bestow a few cold complements in the street upon him than he is loath to
entertain at his house; the true Christian is as a man that meets in the
street a friend whom with great joy he carries home to his house, and is loath
to part with him Cant. 3.4
. The hypocrite is content to attend aloof, as a servant at large, but no
favorite; as one of Gods Court, but none of his Council; but the child of God
thinks he can never be near enough, he will dwell in the secret place even in
the heart of the Most High, and abide under the shadow of the Almighty Psalm.
91.1
; nor will this satisfy him, unless Christ set him as a seal upon his heart
Cant. 8.6
.

This hypocrite prays with respect to his lust.

His ends in praying are as bad as all the rest. He has some corrupt end, some
lust or other to gratify, in every prayer he makes, it is either to satisfy
his voluptuous James 4.3
, covetous Mat. 13.14
, or ambitious desires; that he may have somewhat to put in, or to put on, or
to set him up higher; at least, to procure commendation and applause of men,
and to have that for his reward Mat. 6.5
; which feeds in him the pride of life 1 John 2.16
. In a word, he lands all at himself, self begins, and self ends his prayer.
That it may be well with him Jer. 42.6.
, that he may be rich here, and not go to hell hereafter.

If God will but grant him this, he will ask, or desire no more.

He seldom (or superstitiously and coldly) prays for others: he had rather
others should save him that labor; and pray for him. As Pharaoh made use of
Moses to pray for him in his troubles Exodus 9.28.
, so he had rather make use of the Minister to pray for him, than put himself
to the trouble of praying for himself; just as Simon Magus, when advised to
pray for mercy, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye
have spoken, come upon me Acts 8.24
. Yea, he can for a need, thus put off his own father, Abi pater, tu potius
Deos comprecare? be gone father, and rather petition the Gods thy self, than
expect this of me.

It is the last and worst part of his prayer that he makes and bestows upon
the Churches at home, or abroad, and upon prosperity that shall succeed,
unless for the continuance and prosperity of his own Psalm. 144.12
. He seldom or never remembers the afflictions of Joseph Amo 6.8
. He had rather his right hand should forget her cunning, then that he should
be troubled to remember Jerusalem Psalm. 137.5
; and that his tongue should cleave to the roof of his mouth verse 6
, then he be put to pray for her. But least of all does he respect or look
after the honor of God, or the hallowing of his Name in prayer; rather he
leaves the care thereof to God himself, and to those that have a mind to
espouse his quarrels, and to lay such matters to heart.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true Christian in prayer has chiefest respect to the highest ends.

In things that concern himself, he prays for what is good for the body, but
more for the good of his soul. For outward things he prays; but, as they are
held out in the promise, so far as they are good for him, as well as in
themselves: not to satisfy his appetite or lust; but to support and supply him
while employed by God in his service: he prays for sufficiency and
convenience, not for superfluity, not for abundance, neither for poverty nor
riches, but food convenient for him Prove. 30 8
, for bread to eat, and raiment to put on Genesis 28.20
; and therewith he will endeavor to be content 1 Timothy 6.8
. But his main care is for spiritual, sby how much the soul is more precious
then the body; here he prays that he may have plenty, that he may be blessed
with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in Christ Ephesians. 1.3.
, that he may be complete in him Col. 3.10
, that he may be filled with all the fullness of God Ephesians. 3.19
, not with all the fullness that is in God, for that is incommunicable; but,
with all the fullness that is of God; that he may be as full of that, for his
part, so far as he is capable, as God is for his, of that which is essential.

In praying for others he observes the same rule, the same fervency, which he
does in praying for himself. He prays for that, not which some of them have
most mind unto, as the Israelites had to Quails, but which will do them most
good. He prays, either thus, Da ut them, enable me to help them; or at least,
Da ut dent, furnish them to minister unto me. Thus whom he cannot help with his
hand or purse, he helps them with his prayer both in hand and purse; in body
and in soul, in carnals and in spirituals, that they may be every way the
better for him, and find by experience as Laban did, that the Lord has blessed
them for his sake Gen 30.27
. Yea, thus does he help whole Churches too. He is as David, that when he never
had so much need in his life to beg hard for pardon of his own sin, yet he
cannot forget to pray also to the same God, to do good in his good pleasure
unto Zion, and to build the Walls of Jerusalem Psalm. 51.18.
, which his sins perhaps has or may pull down: to increase Laborers, and to
send them forth into his harvest Mat. 9.38.
.

Hereby he may be a good Statesman, a Commonwealths man, a Pillar to the
Church of God, how mean soever he be in respect of his outward rank and esteem
among men. Hereby, be he never so weak, he may be a Warrior, one of Christ's
Worthies (exceeding those of David 2 Samuel 23.8
) in the Wars of the Lord; as Elias 2 Kings 2.12
, and after him Elisha 2 King. 13.14
: were proclaimed the Chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. Hereby
Moses fought more powerfully against Amaleck on the top of the Hills, then
Joshuah, with his sword in the Plain Ex. 17.10, 11
; and Samuel did more by his prayers against the Philistines, than all the Army
of Israel 1 Samuel 7.8, 9, 10.
. It was said of the Romans, that they overcame their enemies, sitting;
meaning, that their Senate by their wisdom won more victories than their
Armies did battles by fighting. But the Christian gets his victories
kneeling; the enemy fights by crafty counsel, but he fights by prayers, as
David against Ahitophel, and prevailed 2 Samuel 15.31
. Thus the poorest may be a bountiful giver, and that, of a greater gift then
the alms he receives; blessing being better than clothing Job. 31.20.
.

But especially he has both his eyes most intent upon the honor of God,
looking upon the chief part in prayer, which is praise, that more immediately
concerns God, as a part of that homage and service that is a more peculiar
tribute to his Glory, For so God accounts it, who so offers praise,
glorifieth me Psalm. 50.23.
. Yea, the same value he puts upon his own deliverances given at the prayers of
his servants. ver. 15.
Therefore the Christian is careful that what ever market he makes for
himself, God may be the chief gainer; and that what ever becomes of himself,
God may still be advanced by glorifying his Name? Joh. 12.28.
to which he is sure to receive this answer, I have both glorified it, and will
glorify it again, and that in and to the comfort of him that so prays.

Joh. 6.16.
Thus, this Hypocrite is a Parasite that gives God a parcel of good words, but
with an aim at his own belly or back, as they that followed Christ for the
loaves, not the miracles (l), to fill their bellies, not to nourish their
souls; the true Christian is more for others, then for himself; more for God,
then for himself, and all others put together; the one goes to God as Gehazi to
Naaman, for a talent of silver, and two changes of garments 2 Kin 5.22.
pretended to before his master, to bestow upon others, but, meant for himself;
the other is as Dorcas, which made many coats and garments for others, while
she was with them Act. 9.39.
, but few for her own wearing: the one is wholly for self-interest, the other
for charity.

This Hypocrite prays to put off other duties.

He cares not for prayer more then for other duties: but seeing he must own
other duties, or lose in his reputation among the godly, he dares not expressly
to oppose them, but sets up prayer in competition with them: and because this
is the easiest, he confesses a judgment for prayer, against the other.
Prayer, for his money; not because he loves it better, (for he loves none at
all) but because the rest are more cumbersom. Either the work of his Calling
requires much and troublesome bodily labor, prayer therefore being the easier, is
preferred, and the works of his particular Calling must stand by, till prayer
be dispatched, and so that is imputed to his devotion, which is but his
corruption. Hearing of the Word requires more time then prayer only, keeps him
longer from his dinner, comes nearer to his conscience, and makes more bold
with his secure heart. No marvel therefore if such an one cry for less
preaching, and more prayer: not as loving prayer more: for how can he with love
pray to him, whom he loves not to hear? But because he loves neither, yet must
not say so, he uses the stratagem of the Horatii to kill him first that is in
best breath, that he may afterward destroy the other that at present does not
come up so close to him. Let him first remove Preaching, and he may sooner send
praying packing after.

But here in vain man fights with his own shadow making Preaching an enemy
to Prayer, which never had the least jarre or quarrel one with the other, but
what he makes, or imagines. He desires Prayer without Preaching; not that
preaching would justle out prayer; but, because he fancieth that some men plead
for preaching without prayer; which none that truly knew either, ever did. Only
they would have both to go hand in hand, which goes to his heart.

Prayer, if spiritually performed, is as great an enemy to the carnal heart as
preaching, yet he likes prayer better, because in praying he has the matter
in his own hand and power, both for matter, words and time: especially if a
set-form be used, or if he be the mouth of the company. But let him that seeks
thus to sever these duties that God has so wisely joined, read his sentence
from Gods own mouth; He that turns away his ear from hearing the Law, even
his prayer shall be abominable P^ov. 28.9.
.

Differ.
On the contrary, The true Christian the more he prays, the more he loves,
and engages himself to every other duty.

In prayer he desires to be taught righteousness, judgment and equity, yea,
every good path Prove. 2.9.
: give me understanding, and I shall live, says he Psalm. 119.144
; and because he knows, that to him that knows to do good, and he does it
not, to him his very knowledge is a sin; Jam. 4.17.
therefore the very genious of prayer naturally leads to vow obedience, and
to call upon God for strength to obey. Thou have Commanded to keep thy precepts
diligently; O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes Psalm. 119.4, 5
! give me understanding, and I shall keep thy Law; yea, I shall observe it with
my whole heart ver. 34.
. He returns from prayer, as a suitor from Court where he has gotten an
Office, that he may attend thereon with diligence and fidelity.

Nor can he more be without the Word, than without prayer, nor without
obedience to the Word, than without the Word it self. The Word directs what
to pray for according to the Will of God; he cannot put up one Petition but
what the Word warranteth: therefore he must keep close to the Word, or be
extravagant. The Word also supporteth him with hope till his suit be granted;
it is says he, my comfort in my trouble, thy Word has quickened me Ps. 119.
v. 50.
. It is the treasury of comforts and cordials, to a distracted soul, in the
multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts refresh my soul Ps. 94.19.
. It is his monitor to duty which he has vowed in prayer, with my whole heart
have I sought thee, O let me not wander from thy Commandments. Ps. 119 10.
. What preventeth his wandering? this, I have hid thy Word in mine heart, that I
might not sin against thee ver. 11.
? The Word calls upon him to pay what he has vowed? Eccles. 5.4.
and tells him further, that he had been better he had never vowed, than that
he should vow and not pay ver. 5.
. Which all men know impossible to be paid, but by taking heed thereunto
according to the Word.

Besides, prayer is a spender, the Word is a nourisher. While a man prays, he
lays out his soul and spirits at the Market to buy food; the Word in the
mean time supports and feeds him till he has made his market, and brought home
what he went for; man lives not by bread only, but by every word that
proceeds out of the mouth of God Mat. 4.4.
. Christ himself lived upon it, till the Angels came and ministered unto him.
ver. 11.
He that prays is as the sons of Jacob going down into Egypt, to buy corn
for him and his family. But they must take some food with them, or faint by the
way: So must the Christian in going for a blessing. He must still keep close to
the Word till he attain that which the Word directed him to pray for, not only
as his warrant, but as his life. Yea, and when he has gotten the blessing, the
Word is as necessary to sanctify it, as prayer it self: for it is sanctified
by the Word and prayed 1 Timothy 4.5.
.

Thus this hypocrite is a bountefeu, setting duties together by the ears, that
he may either be rid of all, or pick and choose. The true Christian is a
reconciler, that endeavors to keep all duties in good correspondence one with
another. The one sets up one duty to pull down another; the other sets up all,
to strengthen each other: the one seeks to divide them, that he may destroy
them; the other keeps them together, that he may save himself.

This hypocrite by his praying palliateth sin.

The Jews of old took Sanctuary and protection in the house of prayer to bear
them out in all their abominations Jer. 7.9 10.
. The Pharisee will not make a long prayer, but he will be well paid for his
pains. He has a mind to devour the Widows house, and for a cloak to throw
over this rapine, he uses prayer Mat. 23.14
. This hypocrite has ever some wickedness in his eye; when he is more then
ordinarily busy at his prayers. The Papist seems devoutly charitable to set a
rich man out of Purgatory, but it is to cheat the heir of a good part of his
estate under color of praying for his fathers soul. This hypocrite prays,
but it is the better to cover some bosome-lust, some secret way of sinning that
he would fain hide by spreading this specious veil over it; in hope that
however some men may talk their pleasure of him, yet no good man that
converseth with him, and hears him pray, will ever believe what others charge
him with.

On the Contrary, the true Christian by prayer grows into more hatred of
sin, Differ.
and strength against it.

The very duty of prayer makes sin more loathsome, and grace more active
against it. He that has often used all his art and skill against a prisoner at
the Bar, to set forth the venom of his heart and the leudness of his practice,
must needs rise more and more in his heart against him. And he that in prayer
has used so many hard words against his lust, and aggravated the foulness of
it by so many Arguments, and done it in good earnest, must needs grow into
greater detestation of it* For there needs no more Arguments to draw an
ingenuous soul to hate sin, but to set forth sin naked in all her
deformities before him.

And as it is a curb from evil, so it gives strength to the soul against it.
Prayer is a main piece of the spiritual Armor Ephesians. 6.18
. Yea it is (...), the weapon of weapons which helps us to make use of the
whole Panoply of a Christian. This is that weapon which he must not only
brandish, but use to purpose, to kill and slay all those lusts that war in his
members and fight against his soul, even when he has put on the whole Armor
of God. It is that which makes him strong not only against corruption, but even
to wrestle with God himself, as Jacob with the Angel, and to prevail with him
Hos. 12.3
, although not against him.

A Christian having prayed in the morning, is both stronger every way in
himself, and better guarded by God and Angels all the day after, as Jacob was
in his greatest fears. Prayer binds the hands of blood-thirsty-men, as once it
did the mouth of the Lions when Daniel was thrown into the Den amongst them Dan
6.20
, it is the key of the day to open the door of grace and blessings unto him:
and it is the lock or bolt of the night that shuts him in safe from the dangers
and terrors of the dark.

Thus, this hypocrite makes use of devotion to cover, or countenance iniquity;
the true Christian emproveth his prayers to be rid of all evil. The one
prays, and fasteth too, for strife and debate and to fight with the fifth of
wickedness Isa. 58.4
. the other prays to unloose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy
burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke ver. 6
. The one prays, to take the bread out of the poor man's mouth; the other, to
deal his bread to the hungry, and to bring the poor that are cast out; to his
house ver. 7
;

This hypocrite prays, rather for desire of the blessing; than for love to
the duty.

He looks upon prayer as an hook to draw in blessings; and so he likes it: but
not as a Sword to destroy his lusts, for so he loathes it. Were it not for the
fruit of prayer dropping into his own mouth, he would not give one shake to the
tree on which that fruit grows. As the covetous earth-worme toils and
drudgeth early and late, not to honor God in a lawful calling, but to get
wealth which is all the Gods he cares for: so does this hypocrite toil and
drudge at prayer, as Saul forced himself to offer a sacrifice, merely for his
own ends 1 Samuel 13.12
. Not that he cares for prayer, more then Saul for a burnt-offering. Could
Saul have stayed the people together without it; he would have stayed long
enough without giving Samuel occasion to chide him for offering of it. And
could this hypocrite have his hearts desire without praying, he would soon be
of their mind who had rather pay then pray; Seneca.
magni emitur quod precibus emitur, say some high Spirits, he pays dearest
that buys with prayers, so thinks this hypocrite, because as prayer helps
him one way, so it shames and vexes him another way, in that it brings him too
near to a God that cares for none such as he is.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian loves prayer for it self.

He loves it as an Ordinance of God, as well as a means of blessing to
himself. He finds sweetness in the duty, as well as in the success: as it
brings him into the presence of his God whom his soul loves, as well as it
draws down blessings from God as a fruit of his love: as it draws down
spiritual blessings, as well as things of this life, Yea there are many things
in prayer beside the bringing in the hypocrites God, Mammon. It sanctifies
every blessing to a Christian as well as procures it for him 1 Timothy 4.5
.

It makes every blessing the sweeter, a Ring sent as a love-token, is more
esteemed, then that which is bought with ones money, or found by chance. How
sweet was the blessing of Issue to Isaac and Rebeccah, to Elkanah and Hannah,
when it was not only the fruit of the womb, but the return of prayer! It was
the sweetest water that ever Sampson drank of, out of the Jaw Bone of an Ass,
which he got by prayer; and for which he named it En-hakkore, the Well of him
that prayed Judge 15.19
. He that prays not, cannot see Gods goodness in any thing. Therefore the
Christian prays that he may see it in every thing, as Jacob did in the
countenance of his brother Esau Genesis 33.10
. To him that converseth with God by prayer, a letter, or messenger, or some
sleighter accident many times casts in greater comforts into his bosom, then
great wind-falls to them that live without God in the world. To the one, great
matters come short of satisfaction, to the other ordinary benefits exceed
expectation: because the one looks for comfort in the gift, the other is
swallowed up in the boundless mercy and bounty of the Giver: especially
compared with the unworthiness of the receiver. Nothing can be accounted small
that comes from so great love, and is bestowed on so mean desert.

Prayer is that which not only sweetens mercy, but nourishes faith and hope in
God of farther and greater blessings, making the receipt of one, a pledge and
pawn of another; thou have delivered my soul from death, wilt not thou not
deliver my feet from falling Psalm. 56.13
? He being and proclaiming himself to be a God hearing prayer, this cannot but
encourage all flesh to come unto him Psalm. 65.2.
; especially when himself gives it in command, look unto me all ye ends of the
earth, and be ye saved Isa. 45.22.
.

It encourages him to the labors of his calling, because prayer adds to the
strength of the labourer as well as to the issue of his labor, which it
crowns with success; and where the labor ends, the success begins: so
that prayer is a Coadjutor in his labors, and an Insurancer of his profit. It
not only makes the burden light, but the gains heavy, if not always in the
purse, yet in the heart. By this means, the blessing of God makes rich, and
he adds no sorrow with it Prove. 10.22
: not that a rich man (although an holy man) has no sorrow: for, who more? But
he has never a whit the more for his riches, as they come from God into his
possession, whatever he may sustain through the envy and malice of the world,
at the hands of men. His riches have no thorns in them, although men may cast
him upon a bed of thorns for them.

It makes him more in love with God, when he has so much experience of the
goodness, bounty, fidelity of God, in hearing prayer. Every return of prayer
is a new love-token from heaven that raises the heart of the receiver unto
heaven; Therefore he concludes that he can no more live without prayer, then
he can live without God, his prayer is his breath: without breathing, the body
would be enflamed by the heat of his own entralls; so without this breathing of
prayer, the soul would soon wax so hot, as to set all on fire within him Psalm.
39.3.
. He has no help against it, but to speak unto God in prayer. He meets with
much evil in the world, where should he take Sanctuary? where should he pour
out his complaints? but into Gods bosom. To what shelter should he retire, but
only to God? and how to him, but by prayer? this is that which secures him, not
only from the world, but his own evil heart; and brings him not only into the
Court of heaven, but to the throne of grace, the fountain of light and life.

Thus, this hypocrite is a fool that has a price in his hand to get wisdom,
and all other treasures of heaven, but he has no heart unto it. The true
Christian is as the skilful Chemist, that can extract all good things out of
that one body of prayer. The one knows no use of it, but only to get the good
things of this world; the other improves it as the Angel did the sacrifice of
Manoah, to go up to heaven in the flame Judges 13.20
.

CHAP. XXII. The Inspired Hypocrite, Is he in whom the Holy Ghost is, Defin.
as a Spirit of illumination, but dwells not as a Spirit of Sanctification
and Adoption.
HItherto we have given a view of the outside of the Religious hypocrite, we
must now dissect his inside, and see what he has within, either of the gifts
of the Spirit, or of the appearances of saving grace. And because the Spirit is
the fountain of all grace, as well common, as special, we might call him, by a
Catachresis, the spiritual hypocrite, not as being made truly spiritual, but as
pretending to it, even while he is carnal. He takes upon him the name without
the thing. Somewhat he has of the Spirit, but is not spiritualized throughout,
which is the privilege of the Regenerate; as spiritual is opposed to carnal.
But yet, as there are degrees of wickedness in carnal men, some are more
outragiously wicked in their actings then others; so some carnal men attain to
more gifts of the Spirit then others, for which they may be said to have more
of the Spirit, and for which the Spirit of God sometimes terms him spiritual (
the spiritual man is mad Hos. 9.7.
. Not as being regenerated by the Spirit, but as partaking of some gifts beyond
other men merely carnal, by Inspiration, as breath upon the blade of a Sword;
not by regeneration, as he that is begotten again to a lively hope 1 Pet. 1.3.
. Therefore we term him the Inspired hypocrite, not as being infallible, like
the holy Prophets and Apostles, when God dictated to them his own truths: but,
as having nothing in him from the Spirit, but certain transient breathings
serving for present purposes, without any saving benefit to himself.

This is he that may be taken up by the hair of his head to look into heaven,
as Balaam, to see the happiness of those that are made truly spiritual; and so
may get a taste of heaven; but never was taken with it in his heart, so as to
labor truly to partake of that himself, which he describes unto others: and
therefore from his highest ascent, may fall so low, as to be over head and
ears in that unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost. A sin which none other
can commit, but he that formerly has been inspired. But, as all go not alike
far in the degrees of inspiration, so all fall not alike low; none so low, as
he that has gone highest Heb. 6.4, 5, 6
, whom God does utterly forsake and reject, after he has utterly forsaken and
rejected the Lord with malice and obstinacy, doing despite to that very Spirit
of Grace Heb. 10.29.
; that inspired and illightened him, by a total, final, and malicious Apostasy;
when he cease to be an hypocrite, and turns Devil incarnate by open
profession, as well as action, as Julian.

While this man continues an hypocrite, the Holy Ghost may be said to be in
him; but, not to dwell in him. In him, by some operations; but, not dwelling in
him, as being in him to all intents and purposes. The Holy Ghost is, wherever
he dwells; but, he does not dwell wheresoever he is. He is in all, but works
not alike in all: He is in all, per divinitatis praesentiam, by the presence of
his divintiy; but, only in the godly, per inhabitationis gratiam Lumba Sen.
did. 17.
, by the grace of indwelling.

The Holy Ghost is in all; but, variously according to several acts and
purposes. He is in all creatures: he was even in the very Chaos Genesis 1.2
Enter praesenter Deus hic, and ^bique potenter.
or mass of matter not digested and formed into particular bodies; afterward
educed out of it. He fills all places by his essence, presence, and power Ps
139 7
. He is in man among other creatures: in him we live move and have our being
Acts 17.28
. The Holy Ghost is the virtue or power of the most high Luke 1.35
, conserving, ruling, directing all creatures to their ends. Spiritus intus
alit, It Is the Spirit that quickneth. The Philosophers were not out in that
maxim, Sol and homo generant hominem, the Sun and man begets man; man by his
substance, the other by his influence; but they being ignorant of the true God,
never took notice of that higher efficient, who sends out his Spirit and they
are created and, that it is He that renews the face of the earth Ps. 104.30
.

But in every man, he is above all other creatures in this lower Orb. He
illighteneth every man that comes into the world John 1.9
, from the Spirit it is, that men are endowed with reason and conscience, and
what else that differenceth them from the beasts that perish. He is in some men
more than in others, causing them to excel others in humane skill and
abilities, whether in Arts liberal, or manual; some in Philosophy and other
learned Sciences; others in skill of handy-craftes, or trades: as we see in
Bezaliel and Aholiab Ex. 28.3
. In the Sydoneans for ordering of timber 1 Kings 5.6
. And even the Husbandman is instructed of God to the tilling of the ground,
for his God does instruct him to discretion and does teach him Isa. 28.26
. What ground is fit for corn, what grain suites best with it, what soil is
most proper for it, what times and seasons are fittest for plowing, sowing,
etc. Thus, all good things are from above James 1.17
: therefore wise men reject not learning from Heathens, building of Cities from
Cain, dwelling in Tents from Jabal Genesis 4.7
, music from Jubal, handy-crafts from Tubal verse 20
; but, vicious and unprofitable things are discredited by their Author Joh.
8.44.
, John 3 8
as polygamy, by Lamech Genesis 4.19
.

Nor, is this all. He goes further yet in his workings in some men, as members
of the Church visible, whom he makes partakers of more than humane
excellencies in reference to an oeconomical, or Politic body. For, to some are
given spiritual gifts; and these, of diverse sorts some to one, some to another,
all wrought by one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as
he will 1 Cor. 12.11
. One may have gifts of edification for the edifying of the body of Christ
Ephesians. 4.12
; and for the good of others, without benefit to himself. As Balaam (before but
a Conjurer) had the spirit of Prophecy given him, even when he went to curse
Israel in hope of gain to himself; and Judas, the gifts and furniture of an
Apostle: or he may (as our Hypocrite) have some special personal gifts
respecting himself; as, Illumination of the mind Heb. 6.4
, giving him so the knowledge of God and Christ in and by the Gospel, by the
irradiation of the Spirit enabling him to see what by the light of the Gospel
is to be ordinarily seen. Light is not discerned without sight, nor sight
employed with light; the Gospel gives light unto the Object; the Spirit, sight
unto the beholder, by which he knows the things of God held out in the Gospel.
This puts him upon taking a taste of the heavenly gift John 4.10
; to wit Christ, the gift of God Heb. 6.5
by a temporary faith for a while believing Luke. 8.13.
. And hereby he comes to partake of the Holy Ghost, not as a Spirit of faith,
but of conviction by illumination* and, so far forth he tastes of the good
Word of God (to wit, of the Gospel bringing glad tidings of good things, which
is welcome to every body) and of the powers of the world to come, as puts him
upon the external embracing and professing of the Gospel, in relation to
eternal life in the world to come, which yet he never takes the right course to
attain, further then making some proffers and offers in a way of his own, and
upon his own terms.

On the Contrary, Differ:
the true Christian partakes of the Spirit as a Spirit of Sanctification and
Adoption.

The hypocrite never goes so far, nor retains the Spirit so long, as to come
up to regeneration, or adoption. He ever quenches the Spirit, and thereby
miscarryeth before the Spirit can produce either of these fruits in his base
and barren heart. Regeneration and Adoption are the peculiar of Gods children,
not of bastards. They make and constitute a child of God, in regard both of
condition, adopting him not only into Gods family, but into the number of
heirs that shall inherit with Christ himself Romans 8.17.
, which the hired servant, the hypocrite must not expect. And it qualifies him
for it, by making him like unto God, in imparting to him the divine nature 2
Pet. 1.4.
, whereby he becomes in his proportion holy as God is holy 1 Pet. 1 15.16
, as one that is begotten, and born again of God. These and such like, are the
graces which the Apostle affirms to be (...) Romans 11.29.
, such as God never repents of, nor takes away again; they are not like the
hypocrites graces, that endure but for a season, but permanent and stable, and
keep the Christian so fast unto God, that he never departs from him Jer. 32.40.
.

The graces which are in an hypocrite are true, for kind, they are merited by
the blood of Christ, wrought by the Spirit of Christ: but they are not of the
same kind with those in the Christian that do accompany salvation. He may have
the same light, the same sight, so far as to behold the things of God, as in
glass, but not as in his heart. Dimly, but not clearly; for conviction, not
salvation, for the benefit of others, not of himself. If he pretend to more, he
counterseiteth; there, he has not the Spirit Jud. 19.
; not the Spirit to sanctify him, for he is not purged from his filthiness,
how pure soever he he in his own eyes Prove. 30.12
: not the Spirit to witness his sonship; for he is a bastard, and not a Son.
In some things therefore his graces be true, but short: where he pretends to
more, he is shorter; for there he has none at all: which how ever he may for a
while lay up by him, as Joseph's Mistress did his garment, yet at length shall
be taken from him whatsoever he seems to have Luke 8.18.
.

Thus, this hypocrite may see much, but enjoys nothing, of what he sees: the
true Christian enjoys more than he is able at all times to discern: The one
tastes often of Christ and his Word, but never makes meal upon either, and so
thrives not; the other tastes so as to desire both, as a child the breast 1
Pet. 2.2.3.
, and is nourished up in the words of faith 1 Timothy 4.6.
. The one pineth away, the other grows by the same meat. The one in whatever
he seems to have, which a reprobate cannot have, is a counterfeit; the other
in all things that accompany salvation, not only seems to be, but really is
possessed of them.



A kind of union there may be, and as it were, an incorporation, even in many
that pirish. As is evident by those branches in him that bear not fruit, whom
his father takes away Joh. 15.2.
. Although he be the true vine, yet there are some branches in him that are not
true. If we judge of branches by their adhaesion to the stock, by their color,
or leaves, these branches will easily deceive us: for they are called, and
after a sort knit unto Christ, so as if we look on the outward knot, there is
little or no difference: and he that will go beyond that in judging of others,
may be deceived. The hypocrite is rather tied to Christ than enclosed by
Christ. He is tied to him by carnal motives and inducements. He is convinced of
the truth; but, by force of reason: he is comprehended in the Covenant; but, by
an outward league, and external confirmations. Thus Ananias and Saphira Act 5.1.
, Simon Magus Act. 8.13.
, Demas 2 Timothy 4.10.
. And many others joined themselves to the Apostles doctrine and fellowship,
who yet were not of them by any true spiritual bond of union and communion
from any vital principle of the Spirit of Christ within; in which respect one
of the Apostles says, they went out from us, but they were not of us 1 John
2.19
. They were among them, else they could not go out from them: they were not of
them, else they would have abode with them. They were not of them by Spiritual
conjunction, yet were of them by external administrations.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian receives the Spirit of Christ as
inseperably united unto Christ.

He has the Spirit of Christ, as one of his Romans 8.9.
: he is so joined to the Lord by his Spirit that he is one spirit with him 1
Cor. 6.17.
. That Christ is so indissolubly and arctly, that they can no more be separated
than a Spirit can be divided. God has spoken to his heart Hos. 2.14.
. He has shed abroad in his love, in his heart by the Holy Ghost that is given
unto him. Romans 5.5.
. God has given him an heart (not an understanding only) to know him to be the
Lord, and to return to him with his whole heart Jer. 24.7.
. He has also an understanding given him to know him that is true, and to be
in him that is true, as well as to know him.

He is entirely knit to Christ and his Saints by the strongest bonds of the
Spirit within him, whereby he is called to fellowship with Christ and the
Saints as one with them, as one of them, and that by God that is faithful 1
Cor. 1.9.
. He therefore with purpose of heart cleaves unto the Lord Act. 11.23.
; and being of the fellowship of Saints, he continues for ever with them.

Thus, this hypocrite partaketh of the Spirit to some intents and purposes, as
a servant takes up money of his Masters friend, upon this account, that he is
one of his Masters family. The true Christian partakes of the Spirit, as a wife
takes up a commodity in the name of her husband, she being a part of himself.
The one is knit to Christ by his clothes, or joining of hands; the other is
united to him by joining of hearts; The one gets the Spirit, but for a season;
the other, to enjoy him forever.

This Hypocrite partakes of the Spirit, in the body of Christ, but not as a
true and necessary

He may partake of Spirit, as of the root and fatness of the true olive tree
Romans 11.17.
, the body of Christ, as leaves partake of the sap of the tree as well as the
fruit. Or as the hayres and nails, that does beautify and fortify the body,
partake of the radical moisture, yet are not true and solid parts of it. If all
hypocrites were taken away, the Church would seem to appear as were too near
shorn, and pared. It will make her outwardly more naked and weak; but yet, not
maimed, or lame; he is as the teeth that chew meat for the stomach, but not to
taste the meat themselves: as the fat that stuffes out the body, but
strengthens it not; The Church by such adherents, looks fat and fair, but is
never the stronger: they add to her plight, but not to her might. He may be as
the flesh that wastes, and after fills again, without the destruction of the
body, when it wastes, or better constitution when it increases. But he is not
as those spermatical parts in which the radical humor resideth. When such an
one is removed, the Church may be the leaner, but no loser.

He helps to make up the Church visible, which for his sake, and such as he is,
is compared to a Vine, Psalm. 80.40.
wherein there is aliquid amputandum, some superfluous suckers that must be cut
off by the Pruner, which makes the Vine the better: to a barn-floor Mat 3.12.
, wherein there is some chaff, which being blown away, the grain is the purer:
to a great house Isa. 48.1.
, wherein many make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in
righteousness, to a great Feast Mat. 22.10. etc.
, whither even they that are compelled, come; yea, they that are without a
wedding garment, come; good and bad, all come. Christ, the master of the Feast,
enviteth all without difference Joh. 7.37.
, finds fault with all that come not Joh. 5.40.
, entertaineth all that do come, as not despairing of a Church among so many
Mat. 22.10.11
, and visits all that do come, with so much exactnes, that if there be but
one in the company not fitted for such a Feast, he is sure to be found out,
discarded and punished Mat. 22.11, 12 13.
.

Contrarily, the true Christian receives the Spirit from Christ, Differ.
as being a living useful member of his body,

He receives the Spirit, not as clothes that draw out the natural heat, yet are
not animated by it, when they are most busily employed to draw it out; but as
the godly draws life from the soul when animated by it. He takes in of the
Spirit, not as a Sieve in the water that lets it run out as fast as it comes
in; as the stomach does meat, for the benefit of it self, and the good of the
whole. He receives it as life and nourishment springing up to everlasting life
John 7.37, 3^
.

In the living body every joint supplyeth another; with the nourishment
received from the stomach; so, in the spiritual, whereof this Christian is a
member, every part receives from Christ as an Head, which effectually works
in the measure of every part, and thereby makes an increase of the body Eph^s,
4, 1
. He receives not a dragme of the Spirit, but both himself and all the members
near him are the better for it.

Thus, this hypocrite takes in the spirit as a sponge does water, without
benefit; the true Christian takes it in, as the veins do blood, for the
generating of spirits, and the comfort of every part in a living body: the one
receives the spirit, and yet remains carnal, the other by partaking it, of
carnal is made spiritual: the one receives it as lice or other vermin got into
the body; the other, as the members themselves that are pestered with that
vermin.

This hypocrite has a spirit by himself.

A spirit that none but himself and those of his way ever attained. A spirit
that moves him to do things not only beside the Word, but contrary to it, like
those prophets or dreamers of dreams, to draw men to go after other Gods Deuteronomy.
13.1
. A common thing with those that tell lies, in Gods name, to say, I have
dreamed, I have dreamed. Jer. 23.25.
. Thus, the prophets of Ahab had a spirit by themselves to prophecy what might
please their Master 1 Kin. 22.13
, how much so ever displeasing unto God. And if Micaiah prophecy otherwise, it
must be supposed that the Spirit of the Lord was gone out of Zedekiah to speak
to Micaiah ver. 24.
. which must not be admitted, especially in Ahabs Court, and to Ahabs face.
Yet, this was not the Spirit of the Lord that prophesied so much good to Ahab,
but another spirit came and stood before the Lord; a lying spirit in the mouth
of all those prophets ver. 22.
, employed to persuade Ahab to go up, and fall at Ramoth Gilead ver. 20.
.

And even in the Gospel there is a Caveat given not to believe every spirit 1 John 4.1
there are more lying spirits than true, not only without the pales of the
Church, but within it. The Spirit of truth is but one, whom the world cannot
receive so, as to cast off lying spirits that prophecy of wine, and strong
drink, of gain and wealth, of pride and lust. This hypocrite is never without
aspirit to move him to any filthiness or wickedness; how unnatural and horrid
soever. The last age, and this swarm with such Enthusiasts as never find any
motions of the Spirit, so prevalent with them, so magnified by them, so
confidently asserted before all, as when they walk after the flesh in the lust
of uncleanness, and despise Government, when they are most presumptious, and
selfwil'd and not afraid to speak evil of dignities 2 Pet 2.10.
. Tell this hypocrite of a word forbidding and condemning his practice, he
sleights both you and it, and tells you back a tail of the spirit which is and
will be his warrant against all gain-sayes. And no marvel: for he that
despises the Word, the breath of the Spirit, must needs betake him to another
Spirit, as Ahabs prophets did, to justify that contempt.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian admits of no Spirit but that which goes
along with the Word.

He remembers that the promise of the Spirit and the Word, is that they shall
go together; not for a time only, but even for ever in the most glorious days
of Evangelical light. It is that God has covenanted with his people to bestow
upon them Isay. 59.21
. My Spirit that is upon thee and the words which I have put into thy mouth,
shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of
the mouth of thy seeds seed, says the Lord from henceforth and for ever. Where
the promise runs mainly upon the Word in the mouth give to notice to all that
the Spirit of God moves the mouth to nothing else. He forgets not that
assertion of his Lord, It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, then one
tittle of the Law to fail Luke 16.17
: and that he is commanded to try the Spirit whether they be of God 1 John 4.1
. And the rule of trial given him by God himself is this. To the Law and to the
testimonies; if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is
no light in them to Isay. 8.20.
. Therefore he is for no Spirit in himself, or others, but that one Spirit of
truth speaking in the Word; and, to his heart from the Word.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Zedekiah that thinks the Spirit of God is in none
but himself and his fellows. The true Christian is like Micaiah that will
keep close to that which the Lord says unto him (z). 1 King. 22.14
The one likes no spirit that will go no further then the written Word; the
other will own none, but that Spirit which owns that Word, and will not go
beyond it.

This hypocrite may have the spirit of bondage, but not of adoption.

The spirit of bondage is an operation of the Holy Ghost by the Law, convincing
the conscience of sin, terrifying it with the threats of the Law, and making
a man to be lost in his own judgment and feeling, and imprinting in him such
an apprehension and sense of the wrath of God, as makes the very remembrance of
God to be a terror to him; His terrors set themselves in array against him Job.
6.4.
. He takes him by the neck, and shakes him to pieces, and sets him up for his
mark Job. 16.12.
. -- He breaks his reins asunder, and does not spare, he pours out his
gall upon the ground ver. 13.
. He wounds him with the wounds of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel
one, for the multitude of his iniquites Jer. 30.14.
.

This spirit of bondage may sometimes be, and is without saving grace; making
not only Cain, and Judas, but the Devils themselves to trimble Jam. 2.19.
, and ends in despair: for it breeds such a fear in this hypocrite, as in
reprobates, that makes him to conclude against all possibility of mercy, or
careless of the means of recovery.

On the contrary, the true Christian has the spirit of bondage, Differ.
as a forerunner of the Spirit of adoption.

He may have such a spirit upon him, as may for a season terrify him to
purpose, but it continues not. This rod prepared for the wicked, shall not
always remain upon his back. He has not received the Spirit of bondage to
fear again, but the Spirit of adoption Romans 8.15
. It is a step toward saving grace, and an in let to saving comforts. It makes
him fear; but, to quicken his diligence to look out and pursue all means of
reconciliation, thereby to prevent the thing feared. Thus they who were pricked
to or in their hearts, presently cry out, men and brethren what shall we do
Act. 2.37
? that is, to be saved Act. 16.30.
. And so, he works out his salvation with fear and trembling Phil. 2.12.
: not as doubting the issue: for then, in vain to bid him work; but, as hoping
for success, and therefore his fear in working, is from vigilance not from
despair; as fearing he should omit any thing necessary, not as suspecting he
should come short of salvation, when he has done his outmost to work it out.

This fear is as the needle that makes way for the thread, as physic that
makes men sick in order to health. And as privation is reckoned among the
principles of generation, as causa fine qui non, because till the old form be
removed, there can be no room for a new. So the spirit of bondage by bondage
prepares for the Spirit of adoption, that we receive the adoption of Sons
Gal. 4.6.
. And so, by enmity way is made to atonement; by fear, to love and assurance.

There is no child of God but has had some experience of that work of the
Spirit, although the degrees and symptoms be not in all alike, But no hypocrite
ever had or shall bave any part in the Spirit, or grace of Adoption, which
Christ deriveth only to Sons Gal. 4.6.
. The Spirit of adoption is nothing else but the powerful and sweet operation
of the Holy Ghost, revealing and assuring to a true Christian that he is Gods
child and enabling to believe, and cry Abba father. Which because it is of
great comfort and use, I shall further give you the several differences between
the true child of God and the hypocrite, in point of adoption, in several
characters next ensuing, wherein the hypocrite comes short of the Christian in
four acts of the Spirit of Adoption, which are, witnessing, sealing,
comforting, and crying.

Thus, this hypocrite is surprised by the spirit of bondage, as Agag by Samuel;
and so is hewn to pieces 1 Samuel 15.32 33.
, even where he expected quarter. The true Christian is as Hagar, that at first
seeing nothing but present death to her self and her son, for want of water,
has afterward her eyes opened, and God shows her a Well to the satisfaction
and preservation of both Genesis 21.19.
: the one is haunted, to his destruction; the other is scared to his rescue and
deliverence.

This hypocrite has no witness of his adoption, but his own spirit.

Quod volumus facile credimus. We are willing to believe what we have a mind
unto: And to be easily persuaded, we shall have what we long to enjoy. Every
man is a self-flatterer, and willing to be lul'd asleep with self-deceiving, as
he that plays by himself, wins all, yet in the issue gets nothing: Thus is it
with this hypocrite. He gives out that he is Gods child, takes the name and
title upon him, even to God himself: will thou not from this time cry unto me,
my father Jer. 3.4,
? But who shall witness that he is not a child of fornication, a bastard laid
at Gods door? Himself, for, none else will. He says it, therefore you must
believe him: For he knows, you cannot prove the contrary by any judgment
passed on his heart which God alone searches. And if you will take upon you;
he will ask you from God, who art thou that judge another man's servant Rom,
14.14
? And thus, when he has stopped your mouth, he never takes further care to make
out his title unto God.

But if Christ himself, who is truth it self, be content to put himself into
the rank of common men in witnesse-bearing, and ingenuously confess, If I bear
witness of my self, my witness is not true John 5.31.
: that is, not sufficient to satisfy a Judge or Jury in a judicial way for
clearing up a doubt to those that make the doubt, albeit in truth and indeed,
as to point of conscience, Christ might say, as at another time he did, though
I bare record of my self, yet my record is true, because I know whence I came,
and whether I go John 8.14.
. Where then shall the hypocrite appear, and who shall give credit to his own
single testimony of himself alone?

For albeit he herein strikes in with some Anabaptists, and others of like
strain, that pretend to the Spirit, yet it will never be made out to be any
other spirit but his own, as may thus appear.

Where the Spirit of God witnesses, he does it not by immediate revelation,
with out, and beside the Word, but by and upon the evidence that may be made to
any rational man out of the Word it self: first, giving the rule of trial. The
Spirit himself is received by the hearing of faith Gal. 3.2.
, that is, the Word of faith. Because the Word both testifies of him, and
conveyeth him to the believer. How then can the Spirit of God witness without
the Word, that cannot be in the heart without the Word? The Spirit of God spoke
by me, says David: and what did he speak: nothing but Gods Word; his Word was
in my mouth 2 Samuel 23.2.
. The Spirit cannot speak a word, but the Word of God, either as the rule of
trial, or warrant for application: as the rule; thus, he that believes is Gods
child; for, to as many as believe, to them he gives power to be become the
sons of God John 11.2.
. But thou do believe says the Spirit; for thy faith is such as purifies thy
heart Acts 15.9
, and works by love Gal. 5, 6.
. Therefore I am witness with thee, even to God himself that thou art the
child of God. Can the hypocrite find the Holy Ghost bearing him witness that
he so believes? that his faith purges him from his filthiness, in the sight
of God, or that it works by love in the sight of men? where then is his
witness?

Again, where the Spirit witnesses from the Word, the Spirit works in man
what the Word requires of him; the Word requires him to repent and believe
the Gospel Mark 1.15.
Now, the Spirit of Christ, is a Spirit, of supplication or lamentation Zech.
11.10
, that is, of repentance unto life Acts 11.18.
. For, it is such a Spirit, as makes them both pray and mourn ibid. Zech. 12.
; he also is the Spirit of faith 2 Cor. 4.13.
. because faith is one of his fruits opposed to the works of the flesh Gal.
5.22.
. But in the hypocrite these are not wrought, as we shall hereafter see more at
large in the Believing, and in the Repenting hypocrites; therefore the Spirit
is no witness for him.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian has the Spirit of God witnessing with his
own spirit, that he is Gods child.

He that believes on the Son of God, has the witness in himself ( 1 John
5.10.
: not only to be himself a witness, but as having in him the Spirit of God
that wrought that faith to witness with him. And, whereas the Word sets
down, first a general promise, he that believes in Christ shall he saved Mark
16.16. Act. 16.31.
; and then gives an universal command, so to do, look upon me all ye ends of
the earth and be ye saved Isa. 45.22.
. And thereupon the Spirit of Christ, that works all our works in us, thus
proceeds to witness; First, illightning him, so, as to see the truth of the
Word, so as to be able to say by his light, that Jesus is the Lord 1 Cor. 12.3
; so that there is in him, a concurrence of the Spirit, even to Historical
faith, or to faith of assent. Then, he affects the Christian so, as to
desire, long, and thirst after a share in Christ; not only as Balaam, whose
mouth watered at the happiness of Gods people, yet it was but as a
supper-thirst, quenched with atale, or any other diversion; but the Christian
is in good earnest, he pants after God, as the Heart pants after the
water-brookes (i). He must have it, or die for thirst, as Ishmael (k). After
this, the Spirit works (as before was showed the conditions and tokens of
salvation described in the Word. For, God by his Spirit gives both faith and
repentance, by which the Christian comes to have, a spirit of his own to
witness for him with the Spirit of God. Then, the Spirit opens his eyes to
see the work of the Spirit, and the truth of grace in him. And for this end he
receives the Spirit which is of God, whereby he knows the things which are
truly given him of God 1 Cor. 2.12
. He that believes perceives himself to believe, the Spirit enabling him to
see and feel it. Not that the Christian always sees this, even when it is
plain enough to be seen. In times of relapses, tentations, and spiritual
desertions, it is otherwise with him: but when ever he does see these, it is
the Spirit of God that shows them to him. Yea, the same Spirit helps him to
use and improve natural reason in this spiritual Argumentation, and from
undeniable evidences and premises to conclude himself to be a son of God. For,
in tentations, and spiritual conflicts of conscience, the spirit of a man has
not power of himself to conclude, be the premises never so plain, unless it be
assisted, and as it were, actuated by the Holy Ghost.

Thus, this hypocrite is like the Jews laboring to suborne false witnesses to
serve their turns, how void of truth soever. The true Christian is careful
that by the mouths of two witnesses at least, by Gods Spirit and his own,
every word touching his own estate, should be established: the one would have a
lying Spirit, like that against Naboth to be taken for a witness to a ly; the
other is altogether for the Spirit of truth, who is truth and is noly 1 John
2.27
, to bear witness with him.

This hypocrites confidence of the Spirit of Adoption is from a bare Writing,
without a

He is confident even unto impudence, that he has an undoubted title to
whatever the Spirit works, because he finds in himself some work of the
Spirit: which is, as if a beggar, having a few brass tokens in his purse,
should conclude thence that he has right to all the gold in the Mint; or, as
if a servant should infer, that, because he finds the Master of the house to
provide bread for him as well as for the heir, therefore he has as good right
to the inheritance as the heir; and, that Eliezer of Damascus should be
Abraham's heir, because born in his house, although he came not out of Abraham's
loins Genesis 15.2, 3
. But, to undeceive this hypocrite; or, at least others, concerning him; It is
to be considered that there are two works, or impressions of the Spirit, both
which he works, where he is a Spirit of Adoption; the one is Writing, the
other is sealing. He writes, first in the mind, by illumination of the eyes of
the understanding, opening that, whereby the truth of the Gospel is made known
to the mind. And this cannot be denied to the hypocrite, at least in part,
whereby he sees somewhat of the Mystery of the Gospel, as he that being before
blind, by the first touch of his eyes by Christ, saw men walking like trees
Mark 8.23, 24
, as Balaam saw Christ from the top of the rocks, and beheld him from the Hills
Numb. 23.9
, at a distance a very far off. Thus far the hypocrite may be once
illightened Heb. 6.4
; but, as Christ touched that blind man a second time, and made him to look up,
and then he was restored. and saw every man clearly Mark 8.25
, so the Spirit of God writes a second line in the Christian, and that is,
written upon his heart Heb. 10.16
; whereby he is now the Epistle of Christ, written, not with ink, hut with the
Spirit of the Living God, not in Tables of stone, but in fleshly Tables of the
heart 2 Cor. 3.3
. The hypocrite never had such a writing upon his heart, which is a Table of
stone, and that of Adamant, made so by himself, on purpose, least he should
hear the Law, and the words which the Lord has sent in his Spirit by the
Prophets Zech. 7.12
.

The other impression of this spirit, is sealing. And the use of this is to
appropriate, confirm, and ratify to the believer what ever is contained in
the Promise, as the seal is commonly used to confirm what is granted in a
writing of Indenture. There is a twofold seal in the Church, the outward seal
of Baptism, under the Gospel, in room of the old Circumcision Romans 4.11
; which is then ratified when there is a stipulation, or answer of a good seal
of conscience unto God 1 Pet. 3, 21
, and the Covenant kept on man's part. The other seal is inward, which is
nothing but the impression of the Spirit himself upon the soul, causing a
perfect impresse of all the fruits of the Spirit that accompany salvation; that
as in water face answers to face, and as the print in the wax answers to
the seal set upon it, so here is even grace for grace appearing in the
Christian thus sealed. Unto this, the hypocrite never comes: for this belongs
only to those that are truly believers, and effectually washed in the blood of
Christ: as will by and by appear.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christian has the seal as well as the Writing.

He has not only the Law written in his heart, whereby he answers and
resembles God, but he has a confirmation of all that God has promised to him
in whom he has so written, whereby this heir of Promise may be assured of the
immutability of Gods counsel concerning him, and have strong consolation,
having thus fled to God for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before him
Heb. 6.18
. For, he is now sealed up as Gods own goods, and Gods mercies in Christ are
all sealed up unto him as his own undoubted treasure. A seal that is never set
on before saving faith be wrought in the heart, and sets it self on work to
believe and rest upon the Promises of the Gospel; as the Apostle tells the
believing Ephesians, In whom after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that
Holy Spirit of Promise Ephesians. 1.13
. And when this seal is once set on, it is never torn off again, until all be
accomplished that was by this seal confirmed to him: for, he is sealed to the
day of Redemption Ephesians. 4.30
, with this inscription, the Lord knows who are his, on the one side of the
seal; and, with this on the other, let every one that calls on the Name of
the Lord, depart from iniquity 2 Timothy 2.19
.

This seal is not only a confirmation of what shall be, but an earnest of the
inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession Ephesians. 1.14
. God gives his Spirit as handsel, as something in hand, until more come; not
as a pledge or pawn to lie for a time in his hand, and afterward to be taken
home again from the Christian, but as a part of the main inheritance never to
be redeemed or taken back. Therefore is the Spirit called an earnest, and
first fruits, to assure us of more to follow; here the hypocrite must hand off.
A taste, or a say he may have, as many have, that bargain not. But the earnest,
which argues a plain bargain, is peculiar only to the believer truly
regenerated.

Thus, this hypocrite shows up and down a Writing, and that not truly
engrossed neither, but never had the seal of the Spirit to confirm it: the
true believer lays claim to nothing without producing the seal to the
Writing perfectly engrossed: the one produces either a Counterfeit, or at
least imperfect seal, a seal manual, as that of Baptism; the other shows
the great seal, the Spirit of Adoption. The one shows a seal, but without
livery and seisin; the other has livery and seisin given, so soon as the
Writing was sealed; the one pleades a grant, but all is in reversion, the other
has present possession in part conferred on him.

This hypocrite boasts much of comfort, but without comfort from the Holy
Ghost.

He is over-joyed and transported with comfort upon the first receiving of the
glad-tidings of the Gospel, as the stony ground, that first receives the Word
with joy Mat. 13.20
, while the Sun shines, and fair weather lasts; but it is otherwise when
tribulation or persecution arises because of the Word verse 21
. If he must part with any thing, especially with all, he goes away sorrowful,
as the Young man that came to Christ for direction in the way to heaven, but
little dreamed of running such a Gant-lop as Christ put him upon, to sell
whatsoever he had, and to give it to the poor, and to expect treasure in
heaven; and, to take up the Cross and follow Christ Mark 10.21
.

He is bold in running upon comforts, before he see or understand what they be,
or upon what terms to be had. He has some glimmerings of heavenly
consolations, as sore eyes that adventures sometimes to open, to behold the
light, but forced instantly to shut them again: or as a pur-blind man that
sees somewhat, but knows not well what to make of it. He is (...), and (...)
2 Pet. 1.9
He is a Mole, or Want, that uses so much to the earth, that when he works
himself, or is cast by others, above ground, the light dazles him that he
cannot see, but he scrabbles and digges, to get into the ground again. Or, he
is a pur-blind man that cannot see afar off, the great things of God are too
high, above his sight: if you describe them, he may say, yes, as consenting to
what you say, to save his credit; but, not seeing them as you do, to take real
comfort in them.

True comfort flows from a fountain and abundance of grace; not from a
pittance, much less from a bare show and shadow of that in which the comfort
is pretened to be taken. He that will abound in hope through the power of the
Holy Ghost, must be filled with all joy and peace in believing Romans 15.13.
. This Hypocrite may have a taste of those things which administer comfort;
but, it is but as a cook, or carver, that may lick his fingers, but fills not
his belly. He may so far taste them, as to commend them highly to others, who
take more than a taste of them, but remains himself empty; and, with less
stomach to them, by how much he has toyled more to dress, and dish them.

On the contrary, the true Christian lives, Differ.
and walks in the comforts of the Holy Ghost.

He not only sees and tastes them, but feeds heartily, and lives upon them.
He sucketh, and is satisfied too with the breasts of consolation, and is
delighted with the abundance of the Churches Glory Isay 66.11
. He knows the Comforter, for he dwells in him, and shall be in him John
14.17.
. He has everlasting consolation and good hope through grace 2 These. 2.16
. This comfort has two properties that make it differ toto coelo, as far as
the East from the West, from all the comforts of the hypocrite.

True comfort is so apprehended by the Christian, that he thrivs, and grows by
it, not only in joy, but in holiness. The Church that walked in the comforts
of the Holy Ghost, had the fear of God joined with it, and were edified Acts
9.31.
thereby. This effect is promised to the people of God receiving of the
comforts of the Church of old, when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice; with
what manner of rejoicing? with that which will make them to be like the herbs
and plants by the influence of the Sun in the spring, your bones shall
flourish like the herb Isay 66.14
. No herb grows faster by the heat of the Sun, than a Christian by his
comforts. Wereas the hypocrite by false apprehension of comforts, never grows
by them, even when he seems to be fullest of them: Rather they make him idle
and secure, and so he grows worse, not better by his consolations, as Herod,
notwithstanding his gladness in hearing of John.

Another inseparable property of true comfort is, that it gives a joy that none
shall take away John 16.22.
. Not that the actual shining of comforts by the Holy Ghost, admits of no
intermissions, and interpositions of darker waether. Nothing more frequent, in
those especially that are prone to relapses, than to be under clouds of
sadness, and sometimes of terror, to the breaking of the bones Psalm. 51.8.38 3.
of all true comforts and joy. But, the Spirit of Comfort is never taken from
him; therefore the ground of comfort continues, when the act is intermitted;
yea, the comforts once given out, are a stock sufficient to live upon till new
comforts come. Even he that is so far from present comfort, that the very
remembrance of God that was his Comforter, is now a trouble to him, in so much
as his soul refuses to be comforted Psalm. 77.2, 3
. Yet even then, in the close, he acknowledges his refusing of comfort, and
sad apprehensions of God, was but his infirmity, and therefore comfort
himself in remembering the years of the right hand of the most High ver. 10.
, wherein the power and goodness of God poured comforts into his soul, which
in the multitude of his amazing thoughts within him, refresh his soul Psalm.
94.19
. Whereas the comforts of the hypocrites are like the crackling of thorns
under a pot, as soon extinct as kindled, like a flash of lightning, as soon
gone as come; after which, the remembrance of former felicity now adds to his
misery, his former comforts are now ready to thrust him over head and ears into
deeper grief and more desperate sorrow.

Thus, this Hypocrite is but a pretender to comfort, without true consolation;
the true Christian only enjoys it as his portion, and as being the better for
it. The comforts of the one are like the lips of a strange woman, which drop as
an honeycomb, but her end is bitter as wormwood Prove. 5.3, 4
; the comforts of the other are like the streams of Jordan to Naaman, causing
his flesh to come fresh again; as the flesh of a little child 2 King. 5.14
. To the one comforts are like strong drink, bitter to them that drink it Isay
24.19.
; to the other, they are cordials that support and strengthen the soul.

This hypocrite when he most boldly calls God, Father, is yet tongue-tyed in

In words, and from the teeth outward, none so ready to cry, my Father, thou
art the guide of my youth Jer. 3 4
: yet is this but the voice of impudence, not of faith; for it comes from a
whores forehead, that refuses to be ashamed of any thing ver. 3.
. It is from presumption, not due consideration: which ends in revolt and
despair. For if God once comes to challenge him for his sawsiness, and require
what is due by virtue of such a relation, If I be a Father, where is mine
honor Mal. 1.6.
? If God once tell such home you have corrupted your selves, your spot, is not
the spot of my children; you are a perverse and, crooked generation Deuteronomy. 32.5.
. Then he begins to change note and countenance, he is crest-fallen and
heart-fallen too: fearfulness has surprised the hypocrite: and now all his
lay is, who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall
dwell with the everlasting burnings Isa. 33.14.
? Or, else as the man without the wedding garment, at the very voice of him
whom before he boasted to be his Father, is altogether speechless Mat. 22.12.
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true child of God is enabled by the Spirit of Adoption to
call God Father.

He comes not only upon his own account, he has not only right to call God
Father, because Adopted and regenerated, but he has might and boldness also,
above his own, a voice and help of the Spirit of God that cries louder then his
own spirit, Abba Father Romans 8.15.
. He not only cries by the Spirit, but the Spirit it self in him, cries Abba
Gal. 4.6.
. Possibly he may forget his Father for a time, when he forgets himself: but
when he comes again to himself, he will then remember he has a Father to go
unto, and dares go to him, even when he has sinned against him; I will, says
he, arise and go to my father. Not carrying his sins with him, but leaving them
behind, without any purpose to return to them, and so he is sure to find mercy
Prove. 28.13
. Nothing can then take away his confidence from him, because he goes to a
God, that being once a Father, will never cast him off; but cause him to cast
off iniquities, whereupon he heales his backslidings, and loves him freely
Hos. 14.4
.

When a child of God dares not go to God by himself, the Holy Ghost encourages
him, and is not only legs unto him, but is mouth too, and vesteth him with two
benefits, relation and supplication. He first makes it out that God is still
his Father, so that he may, after all his own wanderings, when once he
returns, make his claim. Doubtless thou art our Father, although Abraham be
ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledges us not. Thou O Lord, art our Father
Isa 63.16.
. And as it enables him thus to go to him, so it is a Spirit of supplication
also, whereby he pleads with God, and goes boldly to the throne of grace, that
he may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need Heb. 4.16
. For he has good warrant for so doing. God himself calls upon him to do as
much. Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: declare thou that thou
may be justified Isa. 43.26.
: that is, by Gods righteousness, although he has none of his own.

Thus, this Hypocrite is like a cheater that claims acquaintance and kindred
with God, to get some thing from him; the true Christian makes out his
pedigree, that he is a son, and no bastard: the one says as the Jews, we be
not borne of fornication, we have one Father, even God John 8.41.
. When yet they were the children of the Devil verse 44.
, by doing of his lusts: the other is enabled by the Holy Ghost, to cry Abba,
Father, even when he must needs confess against himself, Father, I have sinned
against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son
Luke 15.21
.

This hypocrite has nothing to do with the Spirit of sanctification, unless
to vex, and resist

If the spirit of holiness enter into him, he shall find but cold
entertainment, matter of disquiet and girefe Ephesians. 4.30
, resistance Acts 7.51.
, and quenching 1 These. 5.19
. As the wicked of old, that rebelled and vexed the holy Spirit Isay 63.10.
. The Spirit it may be in him to restrain and repress some corruptions, that,
might they be suffered, would prove too mischievous to others, as well as to
himself; but not to renew and regenerate him: to overruled him, but not to new
make him. He has a Devil still, which this Spirit over-powers, but does not
cast out.

Christ knocks at his door, as well by his Spirit, as by his Word, but he
opens not unto him. He had a good guest at his door, but lost him for want of
entertainment. Yea, the Holy Ghost, may break open the door and come in: How
else can he be said to grieve, and quench him? Therefore it is granted that as
he is in all men, as God in the creature, to sustain him; in all within the
Church, as a light, to illighten them; in all of eminent parts, to furnish
them; so he is often in the hypocrite that has any good motions, to suggest,
and second them, which motions they repel, or stifle, and so grieve and resist
him.

On the Contrary, the Holy Ghost is in the true Christian, not only to suggest
and propound, Differ.
but to work saving grace.

The Holy Ghost enters the Christian to all intents and purposes. To illighten,
to direct, to guide him in the right way to work grace, as a workman in his
shop, Psalm. 143.10
that is never idle. Not only to work grace, but to actuate it, by acting the
sons of God as the soul the body Romans 8.14
; working all his works not only in him, but for him too Isa. 26.12
. Not only making him his workmanship, by a new creation Ephesians. 2.10
; but setting him on work being so created Phil. 2.13
. He is in the Christian as the Lord in his Temple to fill him with his glory,
the Spirit of God and of glory rests upon him 1 Pet. 4.14
, even when most unglorious in the work. He is as the Priest in the Temple,
slaying the sacrifice, that is mortifying the deeds of the body Romans 8.13
.

The Holy Ghost is in a Christian as graffing in him the Word of life to bring
forth fruit unto life, causing the graff or syen to alter the very nature of
the stock, the heart on which he engraffeth. He not only works in him but is
himself there to cherish and perfect the work. He not only works love, but
sheds abroad Gods love in his heart: not only faith, repentance, prayer, etc.
are graffed on the stock, but himself lies at the root, to give it life,
nourishment, and growth, causing him still to go forward unto perfection.

Thus, the hypocrite, if the Holy Ghost come near him, will entertain him no
better than the Sodomites did the Angels, even forcing the Holy Spirit of God,
if he can, to serve his base lusts Genesis 19.5
; or, as the lewd Gibeonites did the Levites concubine, abusing her even unto
death Judge. 19.25
; the true Christian entertaines the Holy Ghost as Abraham and Lot did the
Angels that came unto them, with all service and honor Genesis 18.2 Genesis 19.1, 2
. The one has the Spirit to illighten him; the other to enliven him: the one,
to his greater condemnation in the issue; the other, to pass him from death to
life in the conclusion.

The Spirit of Regeneration is in the hypocrite, as in a passage or
thorough-fare

As a guest in an Inn, as water in a Conduit-pipe, as gunpowder lighted in
the Cannon. He rather shows what grace is, then works what is showed. He may
work some desires after grace, that may make this hypocrite to cheapen it, but
not to buy; he may like the commodity, but not the price. There may be in him a
muster, a show of military forces, but no fight that ends in the mastery and
victory over his corruptions. The hypocrite may have some conference with the
Spirit in his passage, but no abode of the Spirit in his soul; to him the
Spirit of God is as a stranger, and as a wayfaring man that turns aside to
tarry for a night Jer. 14.^
, with whom he can have little converse or commerce, and from whom he can
expect little benefit, because he stays no longer.

Contrarily, the true Christian has the Holy Ghost dwelling in him. Differ.


The Holy Ghost is in him as an Inhabitant in his own house. He dwells in
you, and shall be in you Joh. 14.17
. A thing so notorious, that the Apostle appeals to the whole body of the
Corinthian Church, know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you 1 Cor. 3.16
? This dwelling imports under it sundry Privileges; peculiar to the
Regenerate, wherein the hypocrite has neither part nor portion.

1. Dwelling imports residence. If the Lord choose Zion, and desires it for
his habitation, he presently declares what he means, this is my rest for
ever, here will I dwell Ps. 132.13 14
. The Spirit of God therefore ever keeps home in a regenerate soul. He
dwells in him, and shall be in him; and as himself, so his graces shall still
abide: the anointing which ye have received from him abides in you 1 John 2.27
, The Comforter shall abide with you for ever John 14.16
; So shall his comforts too John 16.22
, although not always alike perceived. But as for the hypocrite it is not so
with him. He is said to depart from the Wicked Jeremiah 6.8
; not by shifting places, but ceasing to work, and then woe unto them Hosea 9.12
. He makes use of such, as Sheriffs of Executioners, for the present occasion
only, which being over, he casheires the Instrument, as he did Saul.

2. Dwelling implies Lordship. Where the Holy Ghost dwells, he dwells not as
a servant, as a son in his minority, or as a sojourner, or other underling; but
as a Master of the house. The Lord God in the midst of thee is mighty Zeph. 3.17
. Gods children (...), they are led by his Spirit Romans 8.14
, as a servant by his Lord, as a Soldier by his General, says Chrysostom.
But in the hypocrite, the Prince of the power of the air is (...) Supreme Head
and Governor Ephesians. 2.2
. He is not Master of his own house, of his own soul; but he holds his house as
Tiplers hold theirs, at the discretion of unruly guests. Yea, how many slaves
command him, whom one Spirit commands not! He is a Lacedemonian slave, maxim
servus, none like him for servitude. He cannot, if he would, cease from sin 2
Pet. 2.14
.

3. Dwelling ever supposes Provision, He that provideth not for his own, and
especially for those of his own house, has denied the faith, and is worse then
an Infidel 1 Timothy 5.8
. The Spirit therefore dwelling in a Christian stores him plentifully. His
divine power gives him all things pertaining to life and godliness 2 Pet. 1.3
. He is a Sun and a shield, he will give grace and glory, and no good thing
will he withold from them that walk uprightly Ps. 84.11
. Contrarily, the hypocrite is destitute of all such provision. Surely he is
poor Jeremiah 5.4
: yea, as wretched and miserable, and blind, and naked, as ever was Laodicea
Rev. 3.17
.

4. Dwelling includes reparations too. A good hous-holder repaires, and, if
need be, new builds his house: so does the Spirit, all those in whom he
dwells, ye are built up for an habitation of God through the Spirit Ephesians.
2.22
. When the Spirit first seizes on a man, he finds him a den of wild beasts,
a ruinous house, yea, all spread over with the leprosy of sin, which he must
take down to the very foundation: and then builds all a new. But as for the
hypocrite he is like the ruins of an old Abbey, without any repair, a Den of
Lions and Dragons.

5. This Dwelling necessarily comprehends one thing more then all other
dwellings: for it imports animation, or the enlivening and quickening of the
whole house, every stone in this house is living, as coming to that living
stone, in whom is built up a spiritual house 1 Pet. 2.5
. Such as both lives, and grows up to an holy Temple in the Lord Ephesians. 2.21
. But the hypocrite is still as dead as before, yea twice dead and plucked up by
the roots Jude 12
.

Thus, this hypocrite entertaines the Spirit; as the Bethlehemites did Mary and
her son, in a stable Luke 2.7
, because he can spare him no other room: the true Christian brings him into
the soul; not to lodge there for a night, but to dwell therein for ever. The
one has no more hold of the Holy Ghost, than the hypocritical Jews of Christ,
who every day almost, shifted places; the other is possessed of him, and will
not let him go. He is in the one, but dwells not, and therefore does no great
matter for him. He dwells in the other, and therefore abides with him, rules
over him, provideth for him, new builds him, and that as a living house for
himself to dwell in for ever.

Whatever Sanctification appears in this Hypocrite, is but an Apish imitation.

As Phantasy in Beasts does in many things resemble reason, because in sundry
acts the Beast is cunning and very artificial in his kind, which has drawn
some to think and affirm that some bruit creatures have the use of reason,
although not the faculty of ratiocination. Plutarch.
So affectation in an hypocrite makes him so far to study and practice
imitation, that it is hard to discern the difference between him and the
sincere Christian in sundry parts and pieces of the new creature. He has
faith, hope, love, repentance, humility; but, all counterfeited: Faith, without
works, which is a dead faith James 2.20
; Hope without purifying himself 1 John 3.3.
; therefore a false hope which shall perish Job 8.13
. His love is with dissimulation Romans 12.9
, his repentance false and counterfeit, like that of Judas; yea, much short of
it: for, Judas acknowledged his sin, the hypocrite denies it. Judas was
deeply touched with sorrow, this man never knew what sorrow for sin meant.
Judas returned what he had unjustly gotten, this hypocrite justifyeth all that
by fraud or otherwise he has raked together. He turns the motions of the
Spirit into notions, (...) into (...); walking with a right foot, into a method
and formality: he has many good things by rote, but none in his heart.

Yea, as Artificial Birds may be made to do that which a living Bird will
hardly be taught to do; so an hypocrite, by education, company, imitation,
self-interest, ambition of glory, may in diverse outward performances, and in
seeming inward affections out-go and outdo the true Christian, in the eye and
esteem of man; but not, in his that tyeth the heart, and does not judge by
outward appearances.

And yet nevertheless, the Holy Ghost, even in all the livelesse and apish
motions of the hypocrite may in some sort have an influence. For, as Planets
are said to move by Intelligences, as forms assistant, not inherent: or, as
some hold obsession of evil spirits without possession, so the hyhocrite may in
some sense be acted and moved by the Holy Ghost; for although the proper
motions of the hypocrite be irregular, yet are they swayed to serve the ends of
providence by the power and prudence of the first Mover to the Actions which
the hypocrite undertaketh.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true Christian has the substance of that whereof the other has but the
shadow.

He is partaker of true sanctified Reason, which makes him to be a living
sacrifice Romans 12.1
and his worship of God a reasonable service; the body of grace that is in him,
may many times be without a shadow in the darkness of tentation; but, the
shadow that is in the hypocrite caused by an unnatural light, is ever without a
body. He has a price in his hand, but no heart unto it. He is as a Puppet
moved by wires and poyses. A mere Phantasme without a substance, but the true
Christian has the Spirit of power, of love, and of a sound mind 2 Timothy 1.7
; given unto him of God. His heart is sound in Gods Statutes Ps 119.80
.

Thus, the hypocrite seems to be what he is not; and to do what he does not.
the true Christian really is what he seems, and acts from a real principle
of spiritual power within him: the one acts a part in what he has no part,
the other performs a work whereof he reapes real benefit.

Whatever show of Sanctification the hypocrite make, it is but partial.

Either his knowledge is without zeal; or, his zeal without knowledge Romans 10.2
. If he wash his head, his hands are defiled James 4.8
; if his hands be cleansed, his head is not informed. If he have a wise head, he
has a foolish heart: if both head and hands be refined, yet his heart is
unpurged Prove. 30.12
. If he show some justice in his dealing, as the Pharisee did, he wants love,
mercy, and bowels of compassion. If he be a forward talker, he is all words,
and nothing else. If a diligent hearer, he is negligent in his calling, not
redeeming time for both, as he ought, and might.

On the Contrary, the true Christian is entire, and sanctified throughout.
Differ.


He is no smatterer, no mungrel, no linsy-woolsie piece. He does what he does
faithfully, entirely, completely. His works are full before God, in the parts
at least: He is as a wise Master Builder that carries up all the parts of the
building together. He is careful that all the building be not only fitly framed
together Ephesians. 2.21
, but joined together and compacted Ephesians. 4.16
. He is clean every whit John 13.10
; for he cleanses himself from all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, and
striveth to perfect holiness in the fear of God 2 Cor. 7.1
. He is sanctified wholly in soul, spirit, and body 1 These. 5.23
; and so preserved blameless. He adds to his faith, virtue, and to virtue,
knowledge, etc. 2 Pet. 1.5, etc.
yea, every good and perfect gift, that he may not come behind in any grace 1
Cor. 1.7
. yea, he is careful not only to have all grace in him, but that he abound in
it also 2 Peter 1.8
; He has not only a respect to all the Commandments Psalm. 119.6
, but he walks in them all Luke 1.6
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as a Monster that is born imperfect, and therefore all
his actings are monstrous: the true Christian is truly born again with all his
parts and lineaments in due proportion; the one is as the forward young man who
pretended to have kept all the commandments from his youth, yet lacked one
thing which was more then all the rest Mark 10.21
. The other is entire, having lack of nothing 1 These. 4.12
: the one is a Comet, whose rays or beard run out all one way, the other is a
fixed star, that sparkleth on every side: The one makes a great glittering,
yet is but a slimy slough, that in a short time consumes: the other is a true
star fixed in the heavens, that being elevated higher makes not always so
great a show, yet still continues.

CHAP. XXIII. The Believing Hypocrite, Is an Infidel under the vizar of faith.
Defin.

FAITH is the primum vivens, the first thing that lives in a Christian, as
such. And as the natural heat is the general instrument of the reasonable soul
to fashion and adorn her house of the body; so is faith the general instrument
of the Spirit, to fashion and reform every part of the new creature. Now, it
may be thought, that of all graces, Faith is most peculiar to the truly
regenerate; and least communicable to any other; for the Apostle, not only
says, all men have not faith 2 These. 3.2
: but calls this grace, the faith of Gods Elect Tit. 1.1
, as belonging to none but those of that Corporation. And it is an undoubted
truth that true saving faith which justifies and saves, is no where found
but- in them that are truly and actually regenerated.

Notwithstanding, for as much as Temporaries are said to believe for awhile
Luke 8.13
; that he tastes of the heavenly gift Heb. 6.4
(and what more heavenly then faith, that gives heaven upon earth, that is,
peace with God, and unites unto Christ; who is the way for our poor earth to
ascend from earth to heaven?) and, that it is said that many believed on
Christ, upon sight of his miracles, to whom he would not commit himself Joh. 2,
23.24
; that Simon Magus also believed Act: 8.13
: yea, that the Devils themselves, who are enemies to Evangelical truths, and
have no part therein, do yet believe and tremble James 2.19
; it cannot be wholly denied that hypocrites (who are indeed Infidels, as to
saving believing) do after a sort believe. Not only as seeming to others, even
to Gods dear children who cannot judge of the heart, (as Simon, to Philip) in
the judgment of charity and probability, to partake of faith: but, even to
themselves, in the judgment of partiality, to believe. For as they delude
others, by their outward conformity in profession, so they most of all, and
most dangerously deceive themselves by some of those handmaids which accompany
saving faith as well as theirs.

For this hypocrite does not lay a false ground as the Worldling does, He that
has worldly wealth is in Gods favor; but, his ground is true enough, He that
believes on the Son of God shall be saved. But his error is in the Assumption
or application, when he assumeth, or rather presumes, But I believe on the Son
of God. Herein other men may be abused, who judge both according to the outward
profession they see in him, and the charity they have in themselves toward
others; and himself also may be much more deluded, he being most willing in his
own behalf to be deceived. Only Christ, who knows all men, and what is in man
John 2.24, 25
; and, from the beginning sees who they are that believe not John 6.64
: knows this man to be an Infidel or unbeliever; and will also, early or
late, make it known both to his own conscience, and to all the world 1 Cor. 4.5
1 Timothy 5.25
.

But because it concerns every man to know his own estate, and not to
hood-wink himself through wilful blindness, in a business of such high
concernment; until Satan come at the hour of death, and make him, not only by
clear conviction of his judgment and conscience, but by woeful and inevitable
experience, to see and find himself to be his prey; and, to the end the common
delusion whereby every man is apt to be overtaken and ruined, thinking and
presuming that he has faith, and has believed in God ever since he could
remember, prove not his everlasting confusion; It will be good, yea necessary,
for every one to consider what Christ sometimes said to such self-deceivers,
that followed him with others for the present, and thought as well of their own
faith as any in the company, there are some of you that believe not John 6.64
. And again, one of you is a Devil verse 70
. All seemed to believe, but especially the Twelve. He says not, none of you
believe (although at times he found the best of them, to be (...) of little,
weak faith when they had most need to have it stronger Mat, 8.26, 16 8.
. But some of you etc. that is, such, who following him, Luke 12.28
were apt upon occasion to fall from him, and accordingly did; yea, to betray
him, although of the Twelve, as Judas John 6.71
. Such even while they believe are Infidels. They be not the men they take
themselves to be, they do not the thing which they suppose they do, as shall
anon appear.

On the Contrary, the true Christian, Differ.
even in his feared infidelity is a Believer.

The true Believer has his nonage of faith; and, his diseases too, by lapses
into sin; and, his weakenings of it, by tentations; in all, which he is in
great straites, fears and perplexities. In the nonage of his faith, even
while he believes weakly, (yet so well as he can,) he cries out, Lord help my
unbelief Mark 9, 24
. I confess I have much infidelity in me, more infidelity then faith, Lord
cure me of this: help my Infidelity; that is, ease, and rid me of it.

David, and Peter by their great falls, gave great wounds to their faith,
insomuch that they astonished it, that it was not able to move, nor breath; it
lay sprawling upon the ground, ready to yield up the Ghost: yet even then, it
might be said of their faith as Christ of the Rulers Daughter whom the father,
and all the company concluded to be now dead, give place, the maid is not dead,
but sleeps Mat. 9.24
. Even their faith was not then dead, although cast into a dead sleep.

I know a Bellarmine, or some other confident Papist, or his younger brother
the Arminian, will, for this, serve me, as the Fiddlers did Christ, even laugh
me to scorn, for so affirming ibid. ver. 24
: but this is no less a truth, for all their laughing. David had still the
holy Spirit in him, untaken from him, when he was at the worst of his sin, and
at the lowest of his sorrow for it. Take not thy holy Spirit from me Ps. 51.1 1
. He could never make such a prayer, if the Spirit were wholly departed; for,
as yet he had it. And this was the prayer of faith, for he was heard in what he
prayed for. And, as for Peter, he was fenced and fortified by the prayer of
Christ, who was heard always John 11.42
, and ever sped at the throne of grace, I have prayed for thee that thy faith
fail not Luke 22.32
. It failed in the act, but not in the habit: for albeit it was not so strong
as to hold out in the High Priests hall; yet it was so true, that upon the
first look of Christ toward him after his fall, he got up, went out, and wept
bitterly verse 61.62
.

So tentation may prevail so far, as to make a Believer to fear, and ask;
will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more? Is his mercy
clean gone for ever? does his promise fail for evermore etc? Ps. 77.7, 8.
Yet, after all this, faith (that seems to be dead, when it lies only hid)
breaks out, and tells him the truth; that the mistake is in himself. This is
but his own infirmity so to think and speak of God: he has cause to judge
otherwise of God, and would do so too, if he would but look back upon Gods
former dealing with him, therefore faith does put him now upon other work, and
instead of complaining of God, to rejoice and take comfort in him. I will
remember the years of the right hand of the Most High verse. 10.
: those times wherein God spoke peace to his soul, and assured him to be his
God for ever. Thus, he had recourse from feeling to faith, which yet was alive,
although so deeply raked up under the ashes of tentation, that he verily
thought it had been quite extinct.

Thus, this hypocrite is in the matter of faith, as the wanton woman living in
pleasure 1 Timothy 5, 6
, dead while he lives; the true Christian is as Eutichus, sleeping; and,
falling down from the third loft, is taken up dead, of whom yet it may be said,
trouble not your selves, for his life is in him Acts 20.9, 10
. The one as Sardis, has a name that he lives, but is dead Revel. 3.1
; the other is as Abel in another sense, who being dead, yet speaks by his
faith Heb. 11, 4
. The one deceives others, by a vizar of faith; and afterward himself, by a
conceit of faith, (being loath to question that which he sees so many others to
believe;) the other first undeceiveth himself by casting away that vizar, and
laboring after the truth of faith; and then undeceiveth others by the fruits
of his faith, whith before were but counterfeit.

In giving this hypocrites Characters, I shall first give those by which he
deceives others in show, and himself in conceit; and then those by which he
deceives, whether it be in the matter of Assents or of application, or of the
inward joys and contentments which he apprehends in himself, as the fruits
of that faith to which he is a Pretender.

This Hypocrite is a counterfeit in the Church, that is, a Church hypocrite.

There are many counterfeits in the world, and all naught: counterfeit fools,
that have wit, and conceal it, the better to make fools of others: counterfeit
cripples that have limbs, and use them not, that they may live by loytering;
counterfeit tradesmen, that either make a show of wealth, and have it not, or
pretend losses, and need not, that they may gain either more credit by the
one, or pity by the other than they deserve. But, as it was said of the
virtuous woman, that many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest
them all; so may it be on the contrary, of this hypocrite, many counterfeits
have done cunningly, and wickedly, but thou exceedest them all.

This hypocrite deceives the Church, even of the Elect, whom the Devil himself
cannot wholly deceive Mat. 24.24.
, by joining with them in Church duties. Thus Ahitophel, by his walking with
others to the house of God in company, deceived David; for, even then,
wickedness was in his dwelling Psa. 55.14, 15
. Thus, the disciples of Christ were deceived in Judas, till his wickedness
brake out, they thought him to be a believer as well as themselves; which made
Peter to say, in the name of them all, we believe and are sure that thou art
the Christ John 6.69
, when yet Christ knew one of them to be a Devil ver. 70.
. So at another time, he speaks in the behalf of all, we have forsaken all
and followed thee, Matthew. 19 27
, what shall we have? Thus not only Philip, but even the same Peter, long
afterward was deceived for a while, in Simon Magus, who gave in his name to
Christ, received the seal of baptism, and not only joined, but continued with
Philip, and the rest of the Church Acts 8.13.
, among whom he passed for a true Believer, till the nuts were thrown before
this ape, the giving of the Holy Ghost, of which he hoped to make a good
market, and thereupon would have bought that gift at any price; by which he
showed himself in his colors, and was discovered.

Thus many Church-Papists either by dispensations, or at least by
dissimulation, for impunity, credit, preferment, (or happily, for worse and more
dangerous ends) appear sometimes in our Assemblies, yet are arrant Romanists
still in heart. Many Church-Atheists (who, as it is to be feared, make up the
greater number in all Church Assemblies in the world) respecting neither God
nor his people (no more then the unjust Judge when by importunity he did
justice,) seek to delude both; frequenting the Assemblies of the Saints,
joining in the exercises of prayer, hearing, receiving of Sacraments, taking it
in scorn not to be accounted good Christians and true Protestants, yet in their
hearts despise the power of godliness wherever they find it.

Such an one will, perhaps, talk of good things, commend the Preacher and (it
may be) his Sermon too, profess liking of some special points in it: above
all, points of comfort, wherein he seems to claim a great share. And such an
one has his reward, which is, to be well thought of; and made much of for the
time, even of the Saints, which is all he looks for. But what is he the better
for all, or any of this? When not only God, but his own heart also condemns
him within, all the while; and all men shall see, and deride him hereafter?

On the Contrary, the true Believer is one that answers his name. Differ.


He is what he is reputed. He knows that a good name is not to be despised,
but is better then precious ointment Eccles. 7.1
. Therefore he is desirous both to be, and to deserve to be well thought of
among the faithful; yet hating to be well thought of without a cause; and
afraid to be better thought of then there is cause; forbearing all boastings,
and shows, that might make any man to think of him above that which he is 2
Cor. 12.6
. Therefore he labors to be, and to find at home, what he is thought to be
abroad. Am I accounted a believer? It is enough, says the hypocrite; but,
says the faithful Christian, the more cause have I to look thoroughly into my
own heart, and make it out to God and my own conscience that I have faith
indeed. For, well he knows, that not he who commends himself, or is
commended of others, is approved, but whom the Lord commends 2 Cor. 10.18
. And that, he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, whatever show he make of
Abraham's faith; but, he is a Jew that is one inwardly, with the heart believing
unto righteousness Romans 10.9
, whose praise is not of men, but of God Romans 2.29
: not of men, without God; but, of God and men too.

Thus, the one is ready to accept of acclamations and respect from the godly,
upon no better terms then the Sorcerer, who for fear he should not be cried up
to his desert, gives out himself to be some great one Acts 8.9
; the other is as Andronicus and Juniae, who were old disciples, and of note
among the Apostles; yet made no such noise by their own cracklings; the one
cares to get a good opinion, the other to deserve it: the one rests in man's
judgment, knowing it to be mistaken; the other labors to add the witness of
his own conscience, yea of God himself, that he may not deceive, or be deceived.

This hypocrite is a mere Cheater of himself as well as others.

Somewhat he has, or rather seems to have of faith: and this contents him.
The stony ground upon receiving the seed with joy, for awhile believes Luke 8.13
; here is faith supposed, but at most it is but a seeming faith; as appears
afterward, by the taking from him that which he seems to have verse 18
. He had not faith indeed, he did but seem to have it. Something of faith
appears in him, he has some illightning, some taste of the heavenly gift
(which I take to be faith;) of the good Word of God, and of the powers of the
world to come (as Balaam of the happiness of the righteous after death;) and
so far forth it cannot be denied that he is Partaker of the Holy Ghost Heb.
6.4, 5
. Yet neither is this sincere (for then should he never loose it and fall
away;) nor sufficient because as yet he believes not with the heart unto
righteousness. Yet, because he neither does, nor can go further, this contents
him: yea, many times, less serves his foolish heart to make this wild
conclusion; I believe, because I profess the same with others that do believe,
and because others who are godly and judicious do take me to be a believer.
What greater cheat can any man put upon him, then he willingly puts upon
himself by this loose kind of arguing?

On the Contrary, the true Christian is more afraid to be cozened in his faith,
Differ.
then in any thing else.

He knows that not only the Devil will seek either to delude him with a false
faith, or rob him of that which is true, which made Paul above all things
desirous to be satisfied concerning that 1 These. 3.5
. That being the godly man's shield wherewith he is able to queneh all the fiery
darts of the wicked Ephesians. 6.16.
; but, that his own heart also is apt to deceive and abuse him, as Peter's did
when he durst to give it out even to Christ himself, Lord I am ready to go with
thee both into Prison, and to death Luke 22.33
. Therefore in the same breath wherein he says; I believe, he cries out, Lord
help my unbelief Mark 9.24
, lest his heart deceive him. He remembers Philips speech to the Eunuch,
desiring to be baptized, If thou beleevest with all thine heart, thou may
Acts 8.37
; he contents not himself with some flashings of light darted into his
understanding; some taste of faith, or of the Word, or powers of the world to
come to make his mouth water only; but he looks after an illightning that
illightens the whole soul, as the day star arising, (and never setting) in
his heart 1 Peter 1.19
; as that which does not only warm him, as the sun a cold wall; but, cause his
heart to burn within him Luke 24.32
. He strives to believe not only animo in his heart, but ex animo with and from
the whole heart, not fainedly, or with a double heart; not partly, or with a
divided heart; but though imperfectly, yet truly, with a perfect heart. For
faith where it once comes, let it enter in at what part of the soul it will,
it is like leaven that runs over the whole heap of meal, it penetrates every
part of the soul, and not only takes up a room there, but acts in it and by
it in every act that true faith truly puts forth. It is a faith unfeigned 1 Timothy 1.5
, that gives credit to God in all things; but, to himself in nothing, without
God and his Spirit witnessing with his heart.

Thus, this hypocrite is like him that so often tells his ly to others, that at
last he comes to believe it himself; the true Christian finding that all men
are liars Ps. 116.11
; and that the heart is the greatest liar of all Jer. 17.9
, being deceitful above all things, he gives least credit to that of all
others: the one is contented to delude his heart with a painted fire, as
fearing it would, (if true,) be too hot for his lusts; the other is careful to
blow up the coals, that by the heat in all parts of his soul he may
experimentally find and feel his faith to be no counterfeit.

This hypocrite assenteth to some truths of God, but not for God.

We have seen what he seems to himself, and others to be, and is not: we come
now to see what it is that he has of faith, and which he takes for faith:
beginning with the first Act of faith, which is Assent.

He hears the Gospel, and is so convinced by his own understanding and
reason; that he cannot but yield unto the apparent evidence of it. The Devils
themselves do as much as this James 2.19
: not in honor to God the first Truth that speaks in his Word, but because
by reason and experience their understandings are convinced, that they cannot
deny it. Thus may a Papist be said to believe the Scripture, and the matters
contained therein; not because God there speaks, but because the Church so
teaches: which is not to believe God, but man, and to give Assent not to the
truth of God upon his own single authority, but to the truths which the Church
pleases to acknowledge; upon her own usurped liberty. And what greater
indignity can be put upon God, then not to believe him upon his own word, but
upon the credit of a surety, too often known to be partial and false? Let such
an one but be told by that he calls the Church, that God never taught such a
truth, that only faith justifies, he dares give the lie to God and all the
world, that shall go about to persuade him that that is a truth, let the
Scripture speak it never so clearly. But, tell him of justification by works
and inherent righteousness; you shall have him assent hereunto even unto
obstinacy. For indeed, in all points delivered by his Church, instead of assent
he brings obstinacy: not that he is persuaded of the truth of what he holds,
but is resolved that all the world shall never persuade him to the contrary.
Not so much for love of that he maintains, (for what love can he have to the
doctrine of Justification by inherent righteousness and good works flowing
thence, who is a stranger to good works and an enemy to all righteousness?)
but in hatred of the other side, that desires to depresse man, and to exalt
free grace. Such also, are all Jews, and most Heretics.

This Hypocrite, if a Scholar, where he is pleased by being admitted to take
the height of Divine truths by his Jacobs staff, Philosophy and force of
reason, that is of humane ratiocination, he professech to be a great Believer;
and to give firm Assent. But all this faith is but philosophical, humane, and
the child of discourse. What can be so concluded, he yields unto, in the
rest he will (...) suspend his belief: Prius ut confitear me cognant, quam ut
assentiar. Cic. Tuscul. Q. lib. J. Differ.
and you must think he deals modestly and friendliy that he proceeds no
further. But if it were possible so to believe the whole Bible, and the entire
Body of Religion contained in it, yet were this not faith, because not upon the
credit of Gods testimony. This were rather, with the Orator (c) to confess the
truth, then to belive it.

On the contrary, the true believer sets to his seal that God is true.

God says it, therefore he believes it so firmly, that if need be, he will
seal it with his blood. He believes the Creation of the World, and the
immortality of the soul, and not some, but all other divine truths contained in
the Word, not because the Church teaches it, or because Saint Austin, or any
or all of the Fathers have avouched it; but, because Moses, David, Solomon, the
Prophets, Evangelists, Paul, or other Penmen of the Holy writ have delivered
it from God himself: And those not as they were men learned, wise, holy, etc.
But, as (...) inspired and infallibly assisted by God himself 2 Timothy 3.16 2
Pet. 1.21.
. So says the Apostle, (...) by faith we understand that the worlds were
framed by the Word of God Heb. 11.2.
, that, the World was made of nothing. A christians understanding is the
disciple of faith; and his faith, of God. He crediteth man in the things of
man; but, none but God, in the things of God.

Thus, this Hypocrite in assenting is like him that reads his neck-verse, not
so much minding what is in the book, as listening after what his ordinary bids
him say; the true Christian is as the Samaritan after they had heard Christ,
who told her that first invited them to come unto him, now we believe, not
because of thy saying, for we have heard him our seves, and know that this
indeed is the Christ, the Savior of the World John 4.42
. The one says, I believe but knows not whom; (whether a general Council, or
Pope and Cardinals;) the other says, I know whom I have believed 2 Timothy 1.12
.

This Hypocrite rests in a bare assent, without trust.

He assenteth that God is Holy, Wise, Just, Merciful, Omnipotent, etc. But he
trusts not in him for the fruits of any of these properties, that he will be
so and so unto him. He believes him to be Holy, but not as trusting in him to
make him so; to be Wise but not to cast himself upon his wisdom: to be Just,
but not as to do him justice against his enemies, to be Merciful; but not as
showing mercy to or having mercy in store for him: to be Omnipotent, but not as
one that will stir up himself and come and save him: And so, in the rest of his
Properties, and Promises. He has a faith to confess a judgment, but none to
take out execution.

He has a popish faith, a faith of generalities, but none to cast him upon
particular promises with application as having any warrant to cast himself upon
God by virtue of those promises. By assent, he lays a foundation, such as it
is, but never builds upon it. He makes a proposition right, He that believes
shall be saved: but he has no skill in the assumption, I do believe, and
therefore can never infer a comfortable conclusion. Or, if he go some what
further, it is but for a fit, a start, some short time: he believes God for
the time, upon some present feeling, or taste of his goodness in temporal
things, or happily also in spirituals: but it is not upon this account that he
casts himself upon God, but that God casts all he has into his lap, of his
own good pleasure and bounty. But, as the taste and feeling of such undeserved
love and kindness soon vanishes in this hypocrite, so does his trust in God,
so soon as the sense of Divine Goodness is over, although the blessings
themseves remain.

On the contrary, The faith of a Christian delights to cast him upon God,
Differ.
as appropriating generals unto himself.

He looks upon general promises, as made in particular to him, as well as to
others; yea, if at first but to one, many hundred years ago, he will have a
share out of it, as all believers are taught by the Apostle to cast themselves
upon God, for all necessaries, by virtue of that promise, God has said, I will
never fail thee, nor forsake thee; Heb. 13.5.
; which was never made to any one particular, but only to Joshuah, and that
upon an extrnordinary occasion Josh. 1.5.
which might seem to confine it to a far narrower compass. And albeit charity
delights not to go alone, but to take in all whom it conceives to have God for
their Father, saying, Our Father: but faith shows it self most in
particularizing, saying, I believe.

Faith looks upon Gods warrant as a command to apply general promises as made
particularly to every believer, and to apply them to himself in particular.
Remember thy promise unto thy servant wherein thou have commanded me to put my
trust Ps. 119.49
. A Christian therefore is not contented with these general propositions, Christ
came into the world to save sinners, without going further, and saying and
believing too, of whom I am chief 1 Timothy 1.15
. God is the Savior of all men, especially of them that believe 1 Timothy 4.10
, in whom he professes himself to trust. He desires God to speak out to him in
particular, say unto my soul I am thy salvation Ps. 35.3
. He says with Thomas, my Lord and my God John 20, 28
; with Paul, who gave himself for me Gal. 2.20
. So does every Christian, not by special revelation, above Scripture, but by
the very properties and nature of faith it self which enableth all Saints to
comprehend what is the breadth and length and depth and height Ephesians. 3 18
, of all the mysteries of the Gospel in the general promises of God, thereby to
know the Love of Christ which passes knowledge, to every man's own soul in
particular.

And this he believes not only when he actually feels, but even when he
feels not sensibly the love of God toward him, but rather the contrary. For
even then he is resolved, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him Job 13.15
, for his faith (no more than hope) is not grounded upon sense, but upon
promise. As the sap is not always in the branch, yet ever in the root: so the
sense of spiritual privileges and comforts by virtue of the promises, is not
always in the believer, yet the ground of his consolation is never removed,
because that is so firmly laid up in the promise, that when in himself; his
soul refuses to be comforted, yet the Word is a continual spring to refresh
him, that when he can find no comfort in his own feeling, he finds it in the
Word, and is able to speak in faith, that is my comfort in my trouble, thy Word
has quickened me Ps. 119.50
.

Thus this hypocrite is like a Geographer, that coasteth a Country, and can
give you an exact map of every nook and creek in it, but brings home nothing
for himself out of it: the true believer is as Caleb and Joshuah that so
discovered Canaan, that themselves meant to go up and possess it: The one
looks upon the Word as not belonging to him, the other lays hold upon it as
his own heritage for ever Ps. 119.111
.

This hypocrite assenteth to the truth, but without experimental knowledge.

He speaks of the promises by hearsay, not as tasting them. He discourses of
them, as a man writes of the wars of such or such a Country, who was never
in it, or not in the action: or, as he that describes strange Countries, but
never traveled them himself. As a blind man discourses of colors, as a
patient, that commends Physic, believes the Physician in all he writes, or
speaks, but will make no proof of his art upon himself. Thus the hypocrite
believes the Gospel, or at least tells you so, yet never made trial of it, nor
means to do. He is as those that would hear Christ's words, but never come in
to himself, that they may have life John 5.40
. It is delightful to read or hear the great works and miracles which Christ
did, and upon that account, he reads the stories of his life in all the
Evangelists, but never cares nor seeks to be Evangelized, or to find any of the
power and influence of the same Christ upon his soul, according to that power
which he exercised upon the bodies or souls of men, in giving them first, faith
to believe, and then cure upon their believing. He is no more desirous to feel
the power of Christ, and to have experience of him in himself, then the
Pharisees, Sadduces, and the rest of the Jews to whom he preached, and before
whom he wrought all his mighty works, were, to be doers of his Fathers will,
that they might know of his doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether Christ
spoke of himself John 7.17
. He had rather according to the proverb, believe than try; because he is a
spiritual sluggard that is loath to take pains, or a cunning fox that knows the
Word will not please him, if he make trial of it: and therefore it pleases him
better to take that for granted which he never did, nor means to try.

Contrarily, the true believer has experience of what he believes.

He never assenteth to any Word upon the Authority of God speaking in it; but,
from his own experience, he can after write probatum est, upon it. Herein he
differs from hypocrites and devils, that whereas they believe not for Gods
sake, but their own: he believes first upon the account of God, and then upon
trial, further believes from his own experience as the Samaritans did Christ.

Thus Job did not only hear of God by the hearing of the ear, and thereby
believed; but his eye also saw him Jobe 42.5.
, which further confirmed his belief. There is great difference between
hearsay, and sight; between discourse, and acquaintance; imagination, and
sealing to the truth of God John. 3.33
.

An hypocrite may hear what the Spirit says unto the Churches, but only the
Christian knows the meaning of the Lord, and the mind of the Spirit, because
he only has the mind of Christ 1 Cor. 2.16.
. The secret of the Lord is revealed to them that fear him Psalm. 25.12.
; his own conscience and heart is a commentary to him written by the same
Spirit, that speaks in the Word to make him know it. This, to the true
believer is a seal to the truth of Scripture to satisfy him fully that it is
the truth of God. Which a Papist will not, must not acknowledge: because he
takes not his seal from the experience he has within him, but from the
suppository Church without him. Nor indeed can any natural man be capable of
such a confirma^ion.

This is that wherein the meanest Christian goes beyond the greatest Clerks
(unsanctified); yea, beyond Satan himself. Because the Christian has received
not the spirit that is in the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that he
might know the things that are freely given him of God 1 Cor. 2.12.
; which Spirit not only teaches, who is a child of God, but also bears
witness with his Spirit that he is the child of God Romans 8.16.
. So that his experience extends to those things that are most spiritual, and
most remote from sense. Many taste how good the Lord is in outward things, how
good he is to beasts: but, the true believer tastes how good he is to his
children, and among them, to himself.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the parents of the blind man, that could tell that
he was their son, and that he was borne blind, but by what means he now
sees, they knew not John 9.20, 21
: He knows the thing to be true, but that is all: the true believer is as the
blind man cured, that not only knew the thing to be true, but had experience of
the truth: the one believes the Word, because he cannot gainsay it, the other,
because his own trial of it witnesses on Gods behalf, that it came out from
God. The one may commend it as he that commends what he knows not, that he
might be thought a man of art and judgment; the other commends it, as he that
has tasted the old wine, and thereupon prefers it before the new Luke 9.39.
.

This hypocrite assenteth to the truth, but not so as to be transformed into
it.

He talks much of his faith, but shows nothing of the fruit, especially of this
most natural and most proper fruit of it, without which all other fruits are to
little purpose. He is, in his soul, for want of true faith, like the three
children, in their bodies, in the midst of the fiery furnace, through the
strength of faith; on whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was one hair of
their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had
passed on them Dan. 3.27
. No more power has the Word (which this hypocrite assenteth unto) upon his
heart. He is not so mcuh as altered in the least, unless to the worse. As he
that is not better, is certainly the worse for his knowledge in the Word.

Such light of knowledge and such assent may be compared to the light, and
influence of the Moon, which shines, but without heat; hinders not, but
rather increases the cold, stirs up humors, but allayeth none; works
upon men's bodies, as upon the Sea, causing a flood of humors that rise high in
diseases. His knowledge warmeth not, it is an illumination without vegetation.
His cold profane heart is not thawed, but rather frozen harder in the dregs of
sin. The more knowledge, the less zeal, more coldness, more pride and
self-love. For such knowledge puffs up 1 Cor. 8.1.
. His wisdom and his knowledge perverteth him, so far is it from
transforming him into the same Image. This is all his faith, a bare knowledge:
and this knowledge makes a full sea, an (...) and Paroxisme of sin in him: and
is the highway to the sin against the Holy Ghost.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true believers faith of assent, not only affects, but
transformes him.

He never by faith looks into the Word, but he beholds in it the lively
Portraiture of Christ, and is thereby changed into the same Image from glory to
glory Cor. 3.18
. Faith never exercises it self upon the Word, but it has this effect, it
translates and transformes the believer every day more and more, till Christ be
thoroughly formed in him. The Sun is both the husband and physician of nature,
his sight both heates and heales, it cleanses the air, concocteth humors,
dissolveth vapors; so does the knowledge and faith of Christ in a Christian;
it does beget and reform him, it brings him to his due shape and proportion.
For it brings him to the Sun of righteousness which brings health and cure in
his beams, or wings.

It kindles in him the fire of love, the flame of zeal; it stampeth and
imprinteth goodness in his heart; abateth in him the love of the world, and of
himself; so that he says with Job, mine eye has seen thee, therefore I
abhor my self and repent in dust and ashes Job 42 5, 6
: and with David, I have seen an end of all perfection, but thy Commandment is
exceeding broad Ps. 119 96
. He could never have seen how narrow this world is, and how easily a man go
round all the perfection of it, if he had not seen how broad the Word is, and
what influence it has on a believing soul. He never believes the Word, as the
truth is in Jesus: but he puts off the old man, and puts on the new Ephesians. 4
21, 22, 23
.

Thus, this hypocrite, has a body or shadow of faith, but without the soul;
the true believer has the life of faith manifested both in his soul and body:
the one boasts of faith without any work of faith upon him, or in him; the
other makes out to all the world the truth of his faith by the work of it in
him, as well as by those produced by him.

This hypocrite applies the Word, without assent, or knowledge.

Hitherto we have seen his haltings in Assent, we shall now find him as lame in
the application, when he claims a part and a share in the Word of faith, and
in all the good things promised in it, as having a portion therein. Before we
found him laying a foundation, such as it was, without going on to build an
house, he gave some assent, but without application; now, we shall see him
raising of an house, but without a foundation; very busy ln laying hold on
promises, before his assent ever closed with them upon the account of Gods
authority, or he ever clearly and distinctly understood what they contain, or
what terms to be had: which is a building of Castles in the air; or at best
no better then building upon the Sand.

He boasts of faith, and lays hold on the promises, but with the faith of
ignorant people for the most part, who think they trust God very far, when
they either have no need of him, or are ignorant of him, and lean only upon
their own foolish hearts, in stead of trusting in God; the more blind, the more
bold; For, how can they believe in him, of whom they have not heard Romans 10.14
, by the ear of faith as we^l as by that of the body? As the mad man at
Athens, standing on the key with his Tables in his hand, entered all the
shipping and goods in the Port as his own: but, without Bill of lading,
consignement, or mark of his own. So this hypocrite writes down in his book,
not in his heart, all Gods mercies and promises of more; without any warrant,
or mark, to enable him to land them and to bring them to his own storehouse:
or so much as knowing, or looking into them to see what they contain.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true believers knowledge goes before his assent, and both
before application.

He knows that true faith is assensus cum notitia, an assent grounded upon
knowledge. He first knows that the son of God is come, and that he has given
him an understanding to know him that is true 1 John 5.20
, and that this is the true God, and eternal life. He knows that all the
Promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen 2 ^or. 1.20
. So that hi first care is to know whom he has trusted 2 Timothy 1.12
. then, for what cap. 4.8
, and upon what terms and conditions Ps. 85.8
, that if God do speak peace, he must set down this for a firm resolution to
return no more to folly. To all which he fully assenteth, and as firmly
assents to the conditions, as to the promises themselves: this being an
undeniable conclusion that every one that calls on the name of the Lord must
depart from iniquity 2 Timothy 2.19.
; and that God speaks to the wicked that dares to apply otherwise, with
detestation and terror, what have thou to do to take my Covenant into thy
mouth, seeing thou hate instruction and castest my words behind thee Ps
50.16, 17.
?

He knows more over, and finds in himself; after this, the seals of God,
not only those of the Sacraments, which are outward and general; but also
those more special and privy seals of Adoption and Sanctification: these are
his Bills of lading, true consignements, and the marks by which he knows the
promises, and graces of God in them do truly belong unto him.

Thus, this hypocrite presumes to lay hold upon promises and mercies, as the
Danites boldly entered Micahs house, and took away, his Ephod, Teraphim, and
graven Image Judge. 18.18
without his leave, even when themselves scarce knew what it meant: The true
Believer, as David in taking home of the Ark 2 Samuel 6.17
; he will lay hold on nothing of Gods, without seeking of God, and offering up
of peace offerings before the Lord, for fear he should make too bold with God
in so doing; the one lays hold on all without examining his Title, the other
makes sure his title before he presume to lay hand on any thing.

This hypocrite applies, by wishing.

In this he is Balaam up and down, let me die the death of the righteous: Oh
that when I die I may fare as he! Oh that I might then have a part in his
happiness! Thus, the sluggard lies lazing and stretching out himself wishing
for bread, but will rather starve then labor. If wishes would make him rich,
who but he? for wealth But the Proverb tells us, what becomes of Wishers and
Woulders. The eazy lazy wish slays the sluggard, the desire of the slothful
kills him, because his hands refuse to labor Prove. 21.25
. He coveteth greedily all the day long ver. 26
. But has nothing, because he will do nothing for it. His covetousness is not
that of the Mammonist that rises up early, and goes late to bed, and eats
the bread of carfulness, and even over-laying himself with toil and labor:
but it proceeds partly from necessity that cries for supply, and partly from
slothfulness that would fain have it with bare wishing, which because it is
easily done, he is the more greedy in wishing: and because he is eager upon it,
he thinks that will do it, and so he cozens himself till he starve.

Such is this hypocrite, fain he would have the blessings of grace and glory,
if bare wishes would do it. O that Christ were mine! O that I might go to
heaven and be saved! O that I had such a mercy, such a blessing! O that I were
assured of my salvation! but will do nothing for it, not so much as pray for
it, unless in a faint, lazy, dull, cold manner, that himself can scarce tell
whether he pray, or not. He does wish but not pray, therefore he coveteth and
has not. To wish, and not take pains in the use of means, is not only vain
but presumptuous, it is a desire to have a thing besides Gods order, and
without his leave. Therefore as the groundless hope perishes, so the idle wish
vanishes.

On the Contrary, the true Christian applies by apprehending and laboring:
Differ.


He stretches out not only his tongue, but the hand of faith to lay hold on
Christ in the Word and Sacraments, if by any means he obtain him: He follows
on close, he leaves no means unassayed if prescribed of God, that so he may
apprehend that for which he is apprehended of Christ Jesus Phil. 3.12
. He as earnestly desires to apprehend, that is, to use all means to lay hold
upon salvation, as ever Christ laid hold upon him to bestow salvation on him.
He does not only wish he may be saved, but works out his own salvation with
fear and trembling Phil. 2.12.
. His faith is energetical and active, it abhorres sloth and idleness.

It is true that sometimes the desire of faith in a person regenerate, is
faith: but not, in the hypocrite; because in this man, desire is never
accompanied with any prosecution of apt means to attain the thing desired;
but, in the regenerate, it is seconded with labor and diligence, with striving
and industry to compass the thing desired, which therefore is not only
accepted 2 Cor. 8.12
, but seconded and assisted by God, that will surely fulfill the nesires of
them that fear him, he will hear their cry, and will save them Ps. 145.19.
. For as in journying desire with travail, brings a man to the place, or at
least sets him forward in his way: so it is in our travail toward heaven. He
that cannot go, creeps; and he that does but creep, gets ground; but he
that lies still, is never like to be nearer. The desire therefore of a child
of God, does not rest, but prosecute: such desire gives not only propinquity,
but also possession in part, and assured hope of the whole.

Thus, this hypocrite is like David, wishing for some of the Waters of
Bethlehem that was by the gate 2 Samuel 23.15
, but never thought of adventuring for it, that being then a garrison Town of
the Philistines: the Christian is as those three mighty men of David, that no
sooner heard him speak the word, but they presently brake thorough the Host of
the enemy, and fetched it: the one is as the foolish Virgins that fain would
have entered after the bridegroom, but were refused, because they through
idleness and sloth neglected to provide oil for their lamps in time; the other
is like the five wise Virgins, that desiring to enter with the Bridegroom,
were admitted, because careful to provide oil in due season.

This hypocrite will apply and believe some things whether God will or no.

None, at sometimes, so great a Courter of God, as this hypocrite, sometimes he
will not take so much as God bids him ask: Witness Ahaz, who being bade to ask
a sign to confirm the prophecy for deliverance of himself and his people, in
plain terms refused, saying, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord
Esaias 7.12
. He would have the Prophet to know that his faith needed not such a
confirmation, and that he believed him without it: but, hypocrite as he was, he
soon showed plainly that he believed him not at all: for he that would not ask
a sign from God, to avoid tempting of the Lord, refused it, not as not needing
it, but as believing that if he had it, it would do no good: for therefore he
that did neglect Gods means, set up means of his own in the place of God. For
after his pretending so much faith in God to deliver him from Rezin the King of
Syria, and Pekah King of Israel, as not to trouble him to work a miracle to
assure him of these, he presently sent to Tiglah Pileser King of Assyria to
come and help him against those his enemies that arose up against him 2 King.
16.7
, who came indeed upon the invitation, pretending his aid; but, in the issue,
he proved his ruin, as was foretold by the same Prophet Isa. 8.7, 8, etc.
, upon his refusal of the way that God put him upon for deliverance.

Sometimes he will force himself (as Saul, to offer sacrifice) to believe what
God never promised nor spoke. He will believe events without means, miracles
without a word, as Papists believe transubstantiation by miracle contrary to
the Word and all right reason: and as the Jews by an obstinate and arrogant
faith, will needs believe in a Messiah not yet come, although they have found
themselves blinded and deluded above one thousand six hundred years already;
longer than the Mahumetans have been abused by their prophet. Such an hypocrite
is he that will needs believe he shall be saved by Christ, although he repent
not of his sins; that God will be merciful beyond what he has spoken in his
Word, but not so severe as he has threatened. Whereupon, he is settled upon his
lees, and says in his heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do
evil Zeph. 1.12
. He will not trouble himself for every miscarriage of man, but at last will
take pity and save him however. He will therefore bless himself in his heart
(let God say what he list to the contrary) saying, I shall have peace, though I
walk in the imagination of mine own heart to add drunkenensse to thirst Deuteronomy.
29.19
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true believer dares not promise to himself any thing from
God, without a Word for his warrant.

If God say to David, I will build thee an house, David can then boldly press
God in prayer for performance. The Word that thou have spoken, concerning thy
servant, and concerning his house, stablish it for ever, and do as thou have
said 2 Samuel 7.25
. Here he can be importunate and never give over till he has an answer to his
full satisfaction. Therefore he goes on to double and trebble the same petition
V. 26, 27, etc
, For thou Lord of Hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to thy servant, saying,
I will build thee an house, therefore has thy servant found in his heart to
pray this prayer unto thee. And, as if this were not enough, he comes over it
again, And now O Lord God (thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou
have promised this goodness unto thy servant.) Therefore now let it please
thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before
thee: for thou, O Lord God have spoken it, and with thy blessing let the house
of thy servant be blessed for ever.

But if God have made no such promise, he then remembers his rule, Ye shall not
tempt the Lord your God as you tempted him at Massah Deuteronomy. 6.16
. Not ask what God never promised, to try what God can do, and will do, if you
have a mind to put him to it. He will not put God upon the trial whether he be
able to do what sinful man craves, and whether he be amongst his people or no
Exodus 17.7
, and resolve to try it, by putting him upon that which they have a mind to;
so that he must do that, or they will conclude that either he is not among them
according to promise; or not able to make good what he has promised. The
believer is of another spirit: He looks for a word, and that he lays hold upon
as carefully as Benhadads servants did on the words of the King of Israel,
which they diligently observed, and hastily caught 1 King 20.33.
. Or, as the Church, that so soon as ever those words, surely I come quickly,
be out of Christ's mouth, she hastily catches them, saying, Amen, even so come
Lord Jesus Rev. 22.20
.

Thus this hypocrite is like Israel in the Wilderness, when God will have them
to march, they will not; when he forbids them, they are mad to go, and
presume to go up against his prohibition, thinking now by their over diligence
to make amends for their former disobedience; Numb. 14.40, 41, etc.
the true Christian is seriously bent to do that in sincerity, which Balaam
spoke out of necessity, and much against his will. If Balack would give me his
house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the Word of the Lord my God,
to do less or more Numb. 22.18
. The one is as he that says, as they, to day or to morrow, we will go into
such a City, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain, not
knowing what shall be on the morrow Jam. 4.13, 14
; the other is as he that says, if the Lord will, we shall live, and do this,
or that Verse 15
.

This hypocrite applies promises, but not threatenings.

He believes the Gospel, wherein he has no part; but, not the Law, by which
he shall be judged. He is willing to trust God for mercy, but not to fear him
for his judgments. He is willing to hear of heaven, but not of hell. He likes
better to be told that God is merciful, than to hear that he is just; or at
least that mercies, not judgments belong to him. For, says he, what use is
there of terrors, but to make men despair? and, to drive Judas to hell?
Therefore he finds great fault with those that preach terrors. What! will ye
drive men into desperation? And no marvel, for he would have others preach no
otherwise to him, then he preaches to himself. He preaches not so roughly to
himself, he prophecieth smooth things to his own soul; therefore cannot abide
that others should prophecy evil to him, though he be as Ahab, a nonesuch for
disobedience, one who has sold himself to work wickedness 1 Kin. 21.25
. Therefore he says to the Seers, see not; and, to the Prophets, prophecy not
right things: speak unto us smooth things, prophecy deceits Esaias 30.10
.

On the contrary, the true Believer takes heed unto, and hold upon every Word
of God, Differ.
as well as any.

He esteems all Gods precepts concerning all things to be right Psalm. 119 128
. He knows that no Word of God is in vain, or fruitless, nor shall return
unto God void, but shall accomplish that which he pleases, and it shall
prosper in the thing whereto he sent it (x). Esaias 55.11
. He finds he has need of that hard hammer, to break the stone of his heart.
Even in the finishing of his salvation, it is good, not only to work, but to
fear and tremble Phil. 2.2
. Yea, when God is doing most for him, he trembles in himself, that he may
rest in the day of trouble Hab. 3.16
; as fearing God for the very judgments he executes upon others; and lest he
should provoke God to bring the like upon himself; and lest for want of holy
fear and trembling instead of finishing his salvation, he finish his
damnation: for they that do not the former, certainly do the other.

Thus, in serving God, he will serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with
trembling Psalm 2.11
. He will labor after that grace more especially that may quicken him to serve
God with reverence and godly fear, even in the receiving of a Kingdom that
cannot be shaken, as knowing God to be a consuming fire to all that will not so
serve him Heb. 12.28, 29
. Therefore with Paul, he will spur himself up to duty by the terrors of the
Lord 2 Cor. 5.11
; yea, sets a woe before himself, to make him more diligent in preaching the
Gospel 1 Cor. 9.16
. He finds fear to be the best Watchman, and therefore counts him blessed
that fears always Prove. 28.14
; but, calamitatis seges securitas; the fool rages, and is confident, which
makes him careless to his confusion; but, the wise man fears, and departs
from evil Prove. 14.16
.

Thus this hypocrite is not as the devils, but worse, for they fear and
tremble; whereas he believes a falsehood, and presumes; the true believer is
as the blessed man that fears always; The one will be his own carver, the
other refuses nothing that God sets before him: The one trusts God without
fear, till at length he fear God without trusting in him: the other so
fears God in his greatest trust in him, that he is sure to take hold of God
in his greatest fears.

This hypocrite will trust God for heavenly things, but not for the things of
this life.

He thinks it safest to cast himself upon God for the greater, but not to trust
him too far for less matters; for the heavenly inheritance, but not for
earthly maintenance; as if herein, God had left every man to use his wits and
industry to shift for himself. His faith seems very strong in believing his
salvation by Christ, but not able to bear him up against temptations to sin in
providing for the things of the world. And no marvel both his faith by which he
believes is but a fancy, and salvation in heaven is in his esteem no better;
therefore, there he can make you believe any thing, because he apprehends no
danger of miscarriage: for it is not to him a pin to choose, whether he get to
heaven or not, however he has taught himself to speak otherwise. But as for
the things of this life, he looks upon them as matters of substance indeed; his
fancy-ful faith cannot fasten upon the promises of them, because he sees that
no man gets them but by his own wit and industry. And it is not promises (in his
opinion) that ever made any man rich: therefore he resolves to look to himself,
and to take the best course he can to be rich in the world.

If he did indeed equally value heaven with earth: he would be as loath to trust
God for that, as for this. He is content to trust him for heavenly things,
because he looks upon them as trifles in comparison of earthly; but denies him
credit in the things of the world, as being of more consequence and value in
the hypocrites esteem. He deals with God, as some wary men do with slippery
chapmen, they will trust them for a small parcel, or for some braided wares, or
things out of date; but not with any commodities of use, and in present
request, which are every man's money.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true believer makes no difference, but equally trusts
God for all.

He knows that godliness has the promise of the life that now is, as well
as of that to come 1 Timothy 4.8
. That God is as much engaged to give him daily bread, as pardon of sin, or
glory it self; that the promise for the one, so far as it is good for him to
receive it, is as absolute as the other. He does indeed value heaven before
earth; but relieth equally on the promise for both, because the same God
promises both, and is equally engaged for both. Therefore David prays as
confidently for building of his own house 2 Samuel 7
, here, as for the house of his soul, eternal in the heavens. He remembers
that his heavenly Father knows that he has need of these things Matthew. 6.32
, and that he cares for him; therefore however he will be diligent in
obedience to God, to honor him in a lawful calling, yet he casts all his
care, for the issue, upon God that cares for him 1 Peter 5.7
.

He will not take thought for any thing, as mistrusting God will not provide in
a lawful way; but is afraid only of his own heart, that he should dishonor
God by stealing, or by any other unlawful course of getting gain; and so take
the Name of his God in vain Prove. 30.9
, by not casting himself wholly upon God for maintenance, when he has
professed before all the world, that he has trusted in God for this, as well
as for heaven.

Thus, this hypocrite, in heavenly things pretends to more faith then any wise
man would wish him; the true believer, in earthly things has no less
confidence in God, than may keep him in the way of God to procure them. The one
is like a mad man that leaps for joy to think in how good case he is, for
heaven; the other is a sober friend that pities and laments his condition, when
he sees him, notwithstanding his boasting of faith, to take such indirect ways
to the things of the world.

This hypocrite applies mercies and promises without conflicts.

He is instantly cock-sure (as we say) of every thing that he lays hands
upon. He is not in the least troubled with fears and doubtings, that they
belong not to him. He knows not what doubting means. The fool believes
every word Prove. 14.15
, not with God, but with man that seeks to cheat him by flattery, speaks to
him. What is more improbable, or impossible, then a man wallowing in all
wickedness and living in impenitency should conclude to himself that he is in
the way of salvation, and in a capacity to apply all promises made to believers
for that purpose; yet this the fool believes, and says, I shall have peace
Deuteronomy. 29.19
, he doubts nothing of it; and wonders any man else should; for, fools cast no
perils, nor admit any questioning of their title to what they would have. Thus
the fool flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be
hateful Psalm 36.2
; until men hate him for this wickedness of his self-flattery, as well as for
the rest of his villainy.

Indeed he that believes on good ground, is opposed by Satan, and sometimes
causelessly conflicted with by his own conscience, so that he knows not what to
think of himself and his title to the promises; yea, sometimes God himself
hides his face from him, that he cannot tell what to think of Gods meaning
toward him; and then he is troubled to purpose Psalm 30.7
. But corruption is not offended with presumption, but rather cherishes it.
Neither is Satan's Kingdom weakened, nor his conquest less by such confidence,
but more assured. For, who would desire more of his vassals; yea, of his
enemies, then that they should be secure Luke 11.21
?

Contrarily, the true believers faith is militant. Differ.


As his own condition in this world is not only a wayfare, but a perpetual
warfare, engaging him to wrestle not with flesh and blood, but against
principality, against powers, Ephesians. 6.12
etc. So his faith is, and must be always in arms, in conflicts and agonies,
not only against infidels abroad, but against infidelity at home, making him
sometimes to cry out, Lord help my unbelief: yea, not only against devils, but
as Jacob against God himself that will try our faith, as a man that tries his
own sword by bending it up to the hilts, so that his infidelity flies out
sometimes so far, as to say, All men (Prophets and all) are liars Psalm 116.11
; I am cast out of thy sight, etc. Not that hereby it follows that it is best
to doubt of salvation Psalm 31.22
; for, the command is, to give diligence to make it sure 2 Peter 1.10
. And what God enjoyneth, who shall forbid, or neglect?

It were a wild conclusion; that because we sometimes do doubt, therefore we
always must doubt: or that because by reason of sin dwelling in us, we
cannot at sometimes but doubt, therefore it is a part of Christian modesty, yea
of duty to doubt always. They deceive themselves who cannot be persuaded that
they have infidelity, doubting, yea, some Atheism to cope with; and they, no
less, who count doubting a friend. The believer knows by experience that it
is not an ingredient into the nature of a faith, but a poison against which
faith striveth: nor belonging to the constitution of a Christian, but following
him as a disease; and such a disease against which he labors (how ever
weakly) and not which he ought to feed, all his days. The very doubting of a
Believer tends to a resolution; as, when an objection is moved, that it may
be removed. He rests not in doubting as a Sceptick, as knowing that it is
neither needless, nor impossible, by ordinary diligence, to resolve, and be
assured.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Laish, in which the people dwelt careless, being
quiet and secure, having no business with any man Judge. 18.7
, and so were easily overrun by the Danites, when they thought of no danger;
so is he by his infidelity while he glories in the undisturbednesse of his
faith; the true Christian is as the Sentinel that is never off his Watchtower
day nor night, hearkening diligently with much heed, and crying a Lion Esaias 21.8
, until God make him answer, that the enemy that he feared is fallen, and
broken: the one by security is ruined, the other by fears and conflicts is
preserved.

This hypocrite conceiteth that he apprehends Christ, but is not apprehended
of Christ.

He is confident that he has so surely taken hold of Christ, that Christ and
all his benefits are undoubtedly his: He thinks he can, for a need, show you
Christ in his hand; as a Papist can his Crucifix, or mock-Christ; and can lay
out all the benefits of Christ before you so exactly and methodically, that you
shall not call for one of them, but he has it ready to show; at least, in a
map, or picture; in his head, in his brain. In a discourse he is cunning and
nimble at it, as ever Judas, or Alexander the Coppersmith were. And because it
is so perfectly at his tongues end, he strongly conceiteth it to be in his
heart too, where it never came.

He relieth more on his faith, than on the truth of Christ. Let Christ say what
he will to the contrary, yet if this hypocrite have but a strong conceit that
he is a partaker of Christ, all that Christ can say, shall never beat this
opinion out of his head, which he calls faith in his heart. He rests more on
his own strength, than on Christ's power. And is sure he has Christ, because he
thinks so: and, as if he were able to take Christ prisoner at his pleasure, he
talks so confidently and freely, what he can put Christ upon and make him at
any time do for him, as if he had made him as sure, as the Tyrians, who used to
tie their gods with chains, that they might not forsake them.

But all this while, no sign or show of Christ's apprehending of him: he has
nothing of Christ formed in him, no substantial solid image of Christ, but only
a paper-picture appears upon him. Where Christ comes he goes presently to
work; If any man be in Christ, and Christ in him, he is (...), a new Creation,
not only patched up, and painted over in some places; but, old things are
passed away, and all things are become new 2 Cor. 5.17
. This is to be apprehended of Christ, when Christ so takes hold, as to take
possession of the whole man, to new mould and model him, to put on him the
whole new man, which, after God is created in righteousness and true holiness
Ephesians. 4.23
, to which this hypocrite is altogether a stranger.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true believers apprehending of Christ is mutual.

He never apprehends Christ, but it is for that for which he also is
apprehended of Christ Phil. 3.1, 2
. Thus the Patriarchs and Fathers of the Old Testament, were said to embrace or
to salute the promises Heb. 11.13
, they and the promises kissed each other, as the word (...), does import. The
Spouse never comes near Christ, but he kisseth her with the kisses of his mouth
Cant. 12
; he does communicate all his graces, of his fullness she receives grace for
grace Joh. 1.16
. And this is both the safety and strength of a Christian, that as he has
Christ in his hand, so Christ has the believer in his: so that when faith is
weak in the believers hand, yet the Christian is strong in Christ's hand, and
enabled upon good ground to say, when I am weak, yet then am I strong 2 Cor.
12.10.
. For, Christ is mighty to save Esaias 63.1
; and well is it for the believer, who of himself is weak in his greatest
strength, so that by his own strength shall no man prevail 1 Samuel 2 9.
, but he is now held by and in a stronger hand, and kept by the power of God
through faith unto salvation 1 Peter 1.5
.

This is it that makes him even an omnipotent man; for, all things are possible
to him that believes Mark 9.23
: because Christ holds him fast united in his own hand, that all the power of
Satan cannot make him to let go his hold, nor obstruct him in obtaining any
thing from God; because he not so much holds fast Christ, as he is holden
fast by Christ. Therefore it is that even he who one while looking on his own
palsy-feeble hand of faith, cries out complaining? Quis eripiet, etc. who shall
deliver me Romans 7.24
; another while (relying upon the power of Christ, and on his hand out of which
no man is able to pluck him John 10.28
); he casts his gauntlet, and with triumph says, Quis abripiet? who shall
separate me from the love of Christ Romans 8.35
?

Thus this hypocrite indeed imbraceth (what is fabled of Ixion embracing a
cloud instead of Juno) a shadow instead of the substance; an imaginary Christ
of his own fancying, instead of him who was the Son of God; the true
Christian is partaker of him, who so lays hold upon him, that he transformes
him into the same image: the one by his imaginary Christ produces nothing but
Centaures, monsters in opinions and practice, of whom that Proverb, men's non in
est Centauris, is verified, for he can effect nothing that he undertakes; the
other is in the hand of Christ, as wood assimilated into the nature of fire
when cast into it.

This hypocrites faith is but one handed.

And that hand is a left hand too. He has an hand to receive, but none to
give. And an hand that more gladly receives blessings of Gods left hand (as
Austin styles them) earthly blessings, rather than those of his right-hands,
such as are all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in Christ Ephesians. 1.3
. Or if he seem to desire these; willing he is Christ and all his benefits
should belong to him, but he will give nothing for him. He is willing with the
young man to have treasure in heaven; but, not part with his own treasure upon
earth Mat. 19.21, 22
. He likes well a bird in hand. If God will cause all his goodness to pass
before Exodus 33.19
, this hypocrite he likes well of that; but if God will have him to extend any
of his goodness to the Saints, such a request is as welcome to him as that of
David to Nabal 1 Samuel 25.10
, which he never meant to grant.

While God says, I give, his hand is stretched out: but when God says, give
me, either thy heart, thy tongue, thy wealth, thy life, etc. he soon draws back
not only his hand, but his heart also. He comes unto God to get by him, and not
to give to him; and therefore says in effect, as Pharaoh Exodus 5.2
, Who is the Lord that I should let such or such a thing, my wealth, liberty,
life go for him? What is the Almighty that I should serve him? Is all come to
this? I expected great matters from God, and does God come a begging, or
borrowing to me? This is the language of the hypocrites heart, however his
tongue be employed.

Contrarily, the true believer never comes to God without two hands. Differ.


He never brings an hand to receive Christ, but he with the other gives himself
unto God as one that is alive from the dead: yea, there is not a member of his
body, but he consecrateth it as holy to the Lord, by laying his hand upon it,
and offering it up, as, not only an instrument to work for God, but as a weapon
of righteousness to fight for God, if need be Romans 6.13
. He never laid hand upon a mercy, but he accounted it as a debt on his part,
to offer up the sacrifice of praise; For, although he know Gods grace to be
free in respect of money, that is, of merit to procure it, yet he will not let
it be so free, as not to return some duty and service upon the receipt of it.
In this sense he follows the Council of Christ, to buy Revel. 3.18
; but, with Gods money, not as deserving the gold he purchases, but as
performing the homage which he owes.

He knows that God would never admit of a lame, or imperfect sacrifice. If it
wanted any thing it must not be offered upon his Altar. He will therefore never
offer up a maimed imperfect faith, that has not an hand to work by love, as
well as an hand to receive for necessity. He not only says with Abraham, Lord
what will thou give me Genesis 15.2
? but he resolves with Abraham, to offer up his only Son, and that by the same
faith wherewith he received him, whenever God calls for him Heb. 11.17
.

Thus, the hypocrite is like the sluggard who pulls one hand out of his bosom,
wherewith he may receive; but hides the other in his bosom wherewith he
should labor: the true believer is like Aaron that lays both his hands upon
the head of the goat Levit. 16.21
, that he may give as well as receive, the one is as lame in his hands, as
Mephibosheth in his feet; and so cannot stir for God, but as others (whether
his pleasures or profits) carry him up and down: the other is dextrous and
strenuous in giving as well as receiving as knowing; it to be a more blessed
thing to give then to receive Acts 20.35
.

This hypocrite is more affected with terror then with comforts.

We have seen what he is in the matter of Assent, and Application, or trust: we
must now trace him further, and consider his feeling, as the effect and fruit
of both the former; especially of application. For it is not possible that
Application should be without affection. And the affection is according to the
objects apprehended, and the manner and measure of man's apprehending of them.
The objects of faith most proper for Application, are either threats or
promises; answerable whereunto the heart is affected, either with terrors and
discomforts; or with peace and joy. In which method, the remaining Characters
of this hypocrite are to be carried on.

He seems to be much affected with joy upon the Application of promises: but,
as the application was but counterfeit, and pretended for his own better grace,
so his joys and comforts are but forced and without continuance, as we shall
show anon; but his terrors, upon the apprehension of threatenings, affect him
indeed. For these are not fained (as his comforts be) but real, and such as he
can neither avoid nor dissemble. The reason is, because the comforts being but
from his own straining of promises, applied without warrant, or leave from God;
they affect but from the teeth outward; but his terrors arise from another
foundation, the setting of his sins in order before him Psalm 50.21
, and setting home of threatenings, by God himself: so as now he cannot but be
terrified in another manner then before he seemed to be comforted.

He was comforted in jest, but is terrified in earnest. In the one he made show
of what he had not, in this he cannot dissemble what really lies heavy upon his
heart, this like Pharaohs lean kine devoureth the fat, so that there is no
sign or relic of them remaining. The one was but a borrowed thing, but this
is the portion of his cup Psalm 11.6.
. No sinner in Zion so much afraid, as the hypocrite; fearfulness has not
only overtaken, but surprised him Esaias 33.14
. It is a thing he looked not for: and therefore affects and amazeth him the
more. A Pistol shot off at ones powle, makes the stoutest to tremble, when he
would not so much as startle at the going off of a whole Canon, when he sees
the fire given to it.

Every hypocrite having a guilty conscience, must needs when God takes him to
do, have an accusing conscience too, especially when the light of the Word
shines upon it, letting him see in what terms he stands with God his Judge.
Now, the Word is to his conscience, as the Sun that shone upon the water early
in the morning, causing the water to appear to the Moabites as red as blood;
and then to conclude this is blood 2 King. 3.22, 23.
; and therefore calling upon conscience, to gaul him to purpose, as they to
themselves, now Moab to the spoil. Now, even Felix a Judge, trembles before
his prisoner, to hear of a judgment to come Act. 24.26
. For now he sees that there is a judgment for all, and a hell for the
wicked, but chiefly for the hypocrite, and therefore now he knows there is no
escaping of devouring fires, and of everlasting burnings. He is therefore now
terrified to purpose, whose comforts and joys were but a pageant for show.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Believer is most affected with Comforts.

Contrariorum eadem est ratio. If the hypocrite be most affected with terrors,
because these are most properly applicable to him: then the believer must
needs be most affected with comforts, because these are not usurped, but
properly belonging to him, and shed abroad in his heart by God himself, when
once he has made him capable of them. Time was, while he was yet unregenerate,
that he was under a spirit of bondage: and then fear Romans 8.15.
chased him up and down like a smitten Dear till he got sight and hold of
Christ by faith: but after faith was once come, he was no longer under that
smarting rod, but received the Spirit of Adoption enabling him to call and cry
to his formerly-angry Judge, Abba Father ver. 16.
.

The proper food, and state of Gods children is Consolation 2 These. 1.16.
: this is the breasts allowed them of God Isa. 66.11.
. There is indeed an use of terrors belonging unto them, to humble them for
sin, and to prepare them for grace; but, terrors are not their proper
allowance as they are children, but only as the rod or ferular to keep them in
order. Sometimes fire is useful to the living, but clothes are more proper for
all times and seasons. Men use to cloth the living, not the dead, to whom,
according to the ancient custom of some countries, fire was rather applied;
yet sometimes fire was made use of for the benefit of the living. Clothes warm
by cherishing and drawing out the natural heat that is within: they never warm
a dead body. But fire will heat, yea roast and burn up dead flesh. The clothing
of a Believer are the mercies of God in Christ covering him with the robes of
righeeousnesse and clothing him with the garments of salvation Isa. 61.10.
. And, he having in him the inward heat of saving faith, these clothes do
warm and comfort him. But the fire of judgment is more proper for the
Reprobate, first not warming, but rather burning him at present with an
adventitious and unnatural heat; yet, beginning with cold, as a fever that
begins in shaking, and quivering, and ends in scorching comforts are his
clothing, the fire of terrors, the hypocrites portion.

Thus, this hypocrite holds forth comforts, as commodities painted upon a cloth
without his door, but apprehends terrors as a fire in his bones: the true
Believer feeds upon comforts as his meat, and upon terrors as his physic:
the one makes use of comforts, as a chap-man of his credit, when he knows* to
his grief, that he must shortly shut up, and hide his head; the other has
comfort within when he is at the lowest without, because his faith has
compounded with his creditor, who will again set him up.

This hypocrite feels, and bears terrors unwillingly.

Even when he bears least, he is soon weary, and desires to be eased: But if
God give him his load, he is as a wild Bull in a net Isa. 51.20.
. He says not, hic ure, hic seca, here lay on the seiring Irons, cut and
lance, as sometimes Austin; but, as Pharaoh, entreat the Lord to take away the
Frogs from me Exodus 8.8.
, these croaking terrors that creep upon me wherever I go. He murmures and
repineth at terrors, but labors not to be truly humbled under them, and
therefore strives to be rid of them, as Saul of his evil spirit. For no man is
willingly tormented in that flame which tends to burn him up. Therefore Felix
being terrified, puts Paul to silence. He will hear no Preacher that shall
follow him still with the terrors of the Judgment to come, although they be no
other but the terrors of the Lord. No man will endure a corroding smarting
plaster, of which he hopes for no good. Thus Cain being affrighted, stayed not
till God put him away; but, the place and communication being too hot for him,
He went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod Genesis
4.16.
, that is, in a place of exile, banishing himself in the most remote country
that he could find. And Judas despairing, turns his back upon Christ, never
coming more at him. So this hypocrite looking for no good of his trouble, cares
not how soon, or by what means he rids himself of it.

On the Contrary, the true Believer willingly bears the terrors of God,
Differ.
till humbled under them.

He knows that it is good for a man to be sometimes under terrors, that he
may thereby take occasion to lay himself low before God: Therefore albeit no
afflicton be joyous as such for the present, yet he bares this as a man does a
corrosive to eat out proud flesh that hinders the cure of his wound. David was
under great terrors for his great sins, but when he was lowest in the
Dungeon we find him praying for taking away his sin, purging of his heart,
and creating of a clean heart in him, and then, and not till then, to be freed
of the Rack that he was upon.

He is content to stoop under the hand and discipline of God, patiently
learning by bearing the power of his wrath, that he might after taste a more
full draught of his sweetest mercies. He has ever hope in his greatest
tortures, as he that is sick with physic given for his recovery, that his
terrors shall end in comfort, his hell in heaven. Therefore in the greatest
terrors he runs not from God, but cleaves closer to him as a child to his
father when most frighted with the rod; O Lord, says he, I have heard thy
voice, and was afraid. What then? Did he hide as Adam? or, go away from God, as
Cain? No, but cleaves close unto God by prayer, revive thy work, that is, of
mercy; in wrath remember mercy Hab. 3.2.
. Yea, so far is he from desiring to be eased, till he be humbled and
bettered, that he rather fears Gods hand will be taken off, and the plaster
plucked off, before his deadly wound be cured.

Thus, this hypocrite makes no other use of the terrors of God seizing on him,
than the impenitent thief on the cross, that fell to railing at Christ,
because for his sake he sustained such a dolorous death to bear him company;
the true Believer is like the other thief, by his torments brought to a more
thorough sight of his sins, and to justify God in his proceedings, with
rebuking of his fellow, and closing with prayer to Christ to receive him to his
Kingdom: the one blasphemeth, the other prays.

This hypocrites peace is without capitulation or parley.

Hitherto we have seen his deportment under terrors, we shall now view him in
his supposed peace and comforts.

He would not be thought to be without peace with God, nor much interrogated,
when or how made. That he rather would have to be supposed, then sifted. He
has framed to himself a peace with God; but without God. He is fallen into it,
and is strongly persuaded of it: but he knows not how he came by it, or upon
what terms. It is not a peace of Gods proclaiming, but of his own devising;
God peremptorily bids Isaiah to proclaim this to all the world, There is no
peace, says my God, to the wicked Isa. 57.21.
. Therefore when this hypocrite talks loudest of his peace with God, he cares
not how little he has to do with God in it. He will rather have recourse to
them that say, peace, peace, when there is no peace Jer. 6.14.
.

Thus, he talks of peace as if a Rebel should dream or fancy to himself a
peace between him and his Sovereign, without ever treating with, or submitting
to his Prince, but still continuing in Arms against him: I shall have peace,
says he, though I walk on in the stubbornness of mine own heart to add
drunkenness to thirst Deuteronomy. 29.19.
. This is rather a peace with the Devil, a covenant with death and hell Isa.
28.15.
, not with God; it will never hold, it shall be dissolved ver. 28.
; when God proclaims war, the Devil himself will break the league and be the
first that shall fly in his face, and take him by the throat. God will not only
disclaim, but dissolve it. His Covenant with death shall be disanulled, and his
agreement with hell shall not stand ver. 28.
. This peace is no better than for a thief to get a pardon of the Hangman.
This peace will be no discharge, it is but his own forgery. His peace is no
other but the suppressing of the clamor of his conscience forth present, by
hardening his heart more in that sin for which his conscience sometimes whips
him, and winking with his eyes that he may not take a full view of his sin so
often as conscience would hold before him the glass of the Law, till he can no
longer stifle the terrors of God within him.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Believer will have his peace with God, from God, or
not at all.

He will have God speak the word: or, he knows it will do him no good, who
ever else proclaims it. His resolution is, I will hear what God the Lord will
speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his Saints Psalm. 85.8.
. If he speak it, it is worth accepting: otherwise it is not worth the harkening
to. Cause me to hear the voice of joy and gladness, that the bones which thou
have broken may rejoice Ps. 51.8.
. He had rather be in trouble still, then to come out of it without a discharge
from God: say thou unto my soul, I am thy salvation Ps. 35.3.
. He values not salvation it self, unless it come from God.

Not that he despises the peace of conscience within, if true. He is not
ignorant that if conscience rightly informed and duly doing his office is Gods
mouth to his soul truly renewed by grace. And therefore, if his heart, freed
from self-love and partiality, condemn him not, then he has or may have
confidence toward God 1 John 3.21.
. Then, and not before, the heart speaks as God speaks, that is, from the
Word in the mouth of the faithful Minister, to whom the Word of reconciliation
is committed 2 Cor. 5.19.
. The Lord creates the fruit of the lips peace Isa. 57.19.
. He binds and loses by his Ministers, not as giving away unto man his own
authority or infallibility, to bind and loose at his pleasure; but,
commissionating him as his Herald, or Ambassador to declare and publish Gods
own binding and loosing, as to the rule of either, leaving to man the
application of the rule to particular persons. As ^he Priest that was to view
and order a person, or house infected with the plague of Leprosy; first, giving
him the symptoms of the spreading; and signs of the abatement of the disease,
and then appointing him diligently to view the Patient, and by those symptoms
and signs to proceed with him. Thus God absolved, David repenting, by the
mouth of Nathan, the Lord has put away thy sin, thou shall not die 2 Samuel
12.13.
. But this God does upon condition too: he will speak peace to his people: but,
let them not turn again to folly Ps. 85.8.
. Never Prince received Rebels to mercy, but under the strongest assurance of
future allegiance.

Thus, this hypocrite pretends to peace upon no better terms then Rogues to a
Pass which they have made for themselves underan hedge. The true believer
never accounts himself at peace with God, till he be justified by faith, and
has gotten his peace through our Lord Jesus Christ Romans 8.1.
. The one has gotten his peace from hell; the other from heaven.

This hypocrites peace with God is without war with his enemies.

He would have peace with God; and, by his own telling he has it: but he is
loath to espouse Gods quarrels; and to engage in any of the Wars of the Lord,
either offensive, or defensive; lest he should thereby have war with some of
his nearest neighbors and dearest friends and allies, the corruptions within
his own breast, with which he resolves to hold all correspondence and peace.

His peace is without purgation; yea, without pacification: for the quarrel on
both sides is still maintained. The hypocrite harbors the old Traitor sin,
against even the Prince of peace, and God still abhors the receiver and
abettor of his enemies, as much as he does the chief Rebel; God comprehends
none in his peace, but with express exception of sin, and with condition not
only to bear arms, but to fight stoutly with the whole Nation of this Amaleck,
with whom he has sworn to have war unto all generations Exodus 17.16.
. Or, if he do make some preparation, and muster up his forces against the
Amalakites, yet he takes no heed to the charge and order he has received from
God in the prosecution of that war.

Gods commission and command to Saul is, now go and smite Amalek, and utterly
destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both man and woman,
infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass 1 Samuel 15.3.
. This hypocrite, as Saul will muster up his men, and form a very great Army
and make as if he would not leave so much as one man or beast alive. But what
is the issue, the common sort, the lusts that he cares not for, they perhaps
are destroyed, his swearing, drunkenness, lewd company, etc. are cast off; but
Agag the King ver. 8.
, his chief, his capital lust is spared; so also the best of the sheep, oxen,
and all that was good, whatever lusts or means of serving and feeding his
master lust; only that which is vile and refuse, that will be a disgrace to him
among his new company, that he is content to destroy utterly ver. 9.
. Thus the hypocrite pleases himself in deluding of himself and the world for
awhile, until God send Samuel to tell him his own, and to let him know that,
notwithstanding all his specious pretenses of saving of some of the best, for
sacrifice, that this was no other then rebellion, which is as bad as the sin of
witchcraft, which Saul had so sharply punished; nor then stubbornness that ran
up as high as the greatest iniquity, even Idolatry it self (k), that God
himself would never endure even in those that were nearest to him. So that, how
ever this hypocrite at present takes all to be peace between God and him, yet
it will not be long ere God send a Jehu, his own conscience or somewhat else
against him, of whom if he demand, Is it peace? he is sure to receive no better
answer then Jehoram from Jehu 2 Kings 9.22
, what peace so long as thy secret, thy beloved sins of whoredom,
covetousness, pride, etc. are yet so many, and remain unmortified? In vain
then shall it be for him to fly; for Jehu will then draw his bow in full
strength; and cause the arrow of God entering his back, to go thorough his heart.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the Believers peace is a change of war.

His peace with God is his war with sin. Before he fought against God in
behalf of sin: now, he comes over to God, and bears arms against his former
Lord. He is engaged in a war still, and not only dippeth his foot in the
blood of his enemies, but causes the very dogs to lick it up; he mustereth
up all his graces, and not only so but all moral virtues too. He is content his
members that were formerly weapons of war, should not be turned into
plow-shares or pruning hooks, instruments of peace; but be employed still as
weapons* only the war is changed. He will not now give up his members as
weapons of unrighteousness unto sin, but of Righteousness unto God Romans
6.13.
.

He passes from the worse and weaker, over to the stronger and safer side. As
Jehorams messengers turned behind Jehu, so he behind Jesus. And as Jezabels
Eunuchs offered themselves to the service of Jehu, even to the casting down of
their Mistress out of the window, so the true Believer approves his fidelity
and love to Christ, in laying hands upon and destroying of that lust, that
sin which before he served. A peace therefore he has with God, but no
security from war in the world. Upon every assault or conspiracy of sin
discovered, the alarm is sounded, he stands to his arms, and goes out to
battle upon every insurrection of concupiscence, aid from heaven is demanded,
and granted: his life is a continual warfare, even when his peace is at the
firmest with God.

Thus, this hypocrite comes to God for peace, as the Gibeonites to Joshua; for
a league Josh. 9.8.9.
wilily pretending that he comes from a far Country, merely upon the fame of
the greatness of the Name of the Lord: but, the true Christian comes unto him
as Amasai to David, bringing with him the children of Benjamin and Judah,
saying, Thine are we David, and on thy side thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be
unto thee and peace be to thy helpers 1 Chr. 12, 18.
. The one mistakes a truce for a peace, the other makes a sure peace never to
be dissolved: the one contents himself with peace in the world, although he
have none with God: the other has peace in Christ, even when he has
tribulation in the world John 16.33.
.

This hypocrites joy in believing, is as an hasty birth, or too early spring.

Joy in the Holy Ghost, is the brightest luster of faith; unspeakably glorious,
so that he that truly feels it cannot express it; much less comprehend it.
To this therefore as well as to peace, this hypocrite lays claim, but without
a Title. He has a joy, but it shootes up too fast to be right: the have it
makes to get up shows plainly enough that it grows up out of the Dunghill. A
worldly joy, with a false name given it: It is too soon ripe to be good: and
therefore proves quickly rotten. His heart is like tindar, it takes fire of joy
so soon as it is but stricken upon, not like more solid wood that asks more
labor to kindle it. The Temporary is said, (...), immediately to receive the
Word with joy Mat. 13.5. and 20. Luke 8.13
. The joy is in, as soon as the Word. But this is fancy, not true joy; fancy is
quick, consideration is slow: and that fruit which lasts longest comes up
slowest. That Gourd which shot up in a night was as soon destroyed. His joy is
as a sudden blaze made with straw, or thorns: not enough to warm him, even
when it flames highest.

Contrarily, the true Believers joy takes more leisure.

Differ.
He has sometimes a winters night of heaviness, before the morning joy
appears Ps. 30.5.
. Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart Ps. 97.11.
? And they that sow in tears shall reap in joy Ps. 126.5.
. but, joy is a grain that is long ere it shoot up, and be white to the
harvest; the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has
long patience for it James 5.7.
; and, the more precious, the longer he waits. The good ground brings forth
fruit; but, with patience Luke 8.15.
. Faith indeed, in some sense makes have, to lay hold on the promise, but,
makes not have Isa. 28.16
, to reap it, or to claim performance. Faith makes have to make sure of
Christ: but does not make have as an hungry distrustful creditor, that is ready
with a Sargeant to arrest him, even before the day. He can stay for his joy, so
he be sure of it at last, not, as undervaluing it; but, as accounting it worth
the staying for.

Fancy is very nimble, especially in mad men: but, in sober men, judgment is
slow, because mature. Presumption is forward, deliberation is cautious.
Presumption catches at all probabilities, appearances, possibilities; and so,
fisheth all night, and catches nothing But faith pauseth upon the matter,
considers difficulties as well as furtherances; and will not adventure to cry
(...), I have found it, till it be for some time possessed, that then it may
rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory 1 Pet. 1.8.
. It loves not to set foot on any ground of joy, until it has made that
ground its own.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a flash of lightening, as soon gone as come; the
true Believers joy, is as the morning light, that shines more and more unto
the perfect day Prove. 4.18
, The joy of the one is as the joy of children at a Bon-fire that does no body
good; the joy of the other is as the joy of harvest, wherein all have their
share and portion.

The hypocrites joy never came out of sorrow.

That which is light sown, and soon up, can have no deep root. The stony ground
that wants earth will never be able to yield an enduring fruit, for lack of
moisture to feed it There is little hope of harvest, or joy in it, when the
former, and the latter rain has not made way for it. There is no reaping in
joy without sowing in sorrow. This it altogether wanting to the hypocrites joy;
unless perhaps he has bin under the watering pot of some worldly sorrow,
which may keep herbs alive, but will never make them thrive to purpose. Such
sorrow will never end in joy, but rather in death 2 Cor. 7.10
. For the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment Job. 20.5.
; his joy is a triumph without a victory, a trophee without a fight; a Judgment
without debate, and hearing of both sides: The Jews rejoiced in the Baptists
light, for a time Joh. 5.35.
: they were much taken with the news that the Kingdom of God was so near at
hand: but that joy vanished; like beauty that lasts not long even where it is
in greatest perfection (because, but skin-deep;) that they never mourned with
him Luke 7.32.
: they took no notice of the necessity of repentance which he also preached:
nor, of bringing forth the fruits thereof Mat. 3.8.
. Even Herod was glad to hear him, but not at all humbled for the sin which
John reproved. This is a very pleasing delusion to our hypocrite, to comfort
himself in the hope of good; without troubling himself to repent of the evil.

On the Contrary, the Believers joy is the harvest of sorrow. Differ.


Heaviness is the forerunner of joy to him that is heavy with godly sorrow;
as carnal joy is the inlet to all hellish terror, where godly sorrow takes it
not at the rebound, and makes it fly back to make him mourn that is so full of
false joy. Such joy is the ground of sorrow, as godly sorrow is, of spiritual
joy. Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted Mat. 5.4
. Christ's way of giving joy is to give the oil of joy for mourning, and the
garment of praise for the Spirit of heaviness Isa. 61.3.
. He never strowed joy, but where he found the waters of mourning running, and
even overflowing the soul, whereby he finds the Believer to have need of some
dryer path and some more pleasing steps to walk upon. This, the Believer
knowing will go this way, or none, to joy.

In him therefore joy succeeds sorrow, as the thread the needle; he
remembering that promise; blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh Luke
6.21.
. It comfort in sorrow, for he says, as the Psalmist, upon good experience,
in the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts refresh my soul Ps.
94.19.
. No sickness; no Physic; no wounds, no plaster. And as true joy arises
from, so it is cherished and increased by godly sorrow: for, as the sufferings
of Christ abound in him, so also his consolations much more abound by Christ 2
Cor. 1.^
.

Thus, this hypocrites joy is like fire in an oven soon ready to blaze; the
true Christians joy is like fire in the Smiths forge, that will never burn
kindly, till it be thoroughly sprinkled with water: the one blazeth, the other
heateth: the one, the greater it is, the more it scorcheth and burns; the
other, the stronger it is, the more it dissolveth and melts the metal that
is cast into it.

This hypocrites joy is only for the present.

He is rather jovial, then truly joyful. Let all things be to his content, and
he can be wildly merry: Let any thing cross him, and he is thunder-smitten. He
can with Jonah rejoice in his Gourd while it flourishes, but be angry to the
death, if it wither. He is like the Melancholist, all in extremes: transported
with joy, or suffering an inundation of sorrow. But his desire is to be joyful,
while it will hold. When Christ the Bridegroom is with him, he rejoices
greatly; because of the Bridegroomes voice John 3.29.
. He knows there is now good cheer, music, and mirth good store present, or
at hand; every one can be merry at a wedd^ng; else, he will not come there; Yet
it is not so much the presence of Christ, as the good cheer and the mirth of
the company that gladdeth this hypocrite: the circumstances of his presence;
not the virtues of Christ, but his feast and favors: as many a man is loved
and commended for his good-house-keeping, that is little regarded for his
justice and piety. If Christ once withdraw himself, this hypocrites joy is
lost, not in godly sorrow for his absence, but in discontent at his own loss
of the loaves.

On the Contrary, the true Believers joy is perpetual.

Differ.
His joy no man shall take from him Joh. 16.22.
. He looks on joy not only as a privilege, but as a duty. The precept is,
rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice Phil. 4.4.
. Therefore he studies to be joyful in his God. He looks upon the promise too,
of everlasting joy upon the heads of the Redeemed, who shall obtain joy and
gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away Isa. 35.10.
. Therefore he endeavors to rejoice evermore 1 These. 5.16.
, Christ is never absent to faith, therefore faith, even when the eye sees him
not, believing in him, rejoices with joy unspeakable and full of glory 1 Pet.
1.8.
. And when Christ is most present, the joy of a true Believer is rather in him
then in his gifts. Lord lift up thou the light of thy countenance upon us Ps.
46.
. I will behold thy face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied with thine
Image, and, with thy likeness Ps. 17.15.
.

He joyeth more in himself, then in his hospitality; in his holiness, then in
his bounty. In his inward presence, then in his outward additaments. Yea, when
Christ is absent, the Believer faints not: because Christ has not forsaken
him, although he withdraw his presence, he has taken care for his security
whatever happens. In the world he may have tribulation, but Christ tells him
this for his comfort, I have overcome the world Joh. 16.33.
. He takes care for this, and did it in his own person before he left the
world. Therefore with faith (and not without some comfort) says, I will wait
upon the Lord who has hid his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look to
him Isa. 8.17.
.

And although sorrow then be seasonable, for the friends of the Bridegroom is
taken from them Mat. 9.15.
. Yet, this departure leaves not the Believer without some joy to think of his
return. Indeed to rejoice with Christ in the prosperity of the Gospel is no
sure sign of grace; for many rejoice with the Bridegroom at the marriage
feast, yea, and not none that have not the wedding garment. But to mourn in
absence, and to find no comfort but in remembrance of his former company, and
in hope of his return, this is of the Spirit and of the Bride. I shall yet
praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God.

This hypocrites joy is but a say, or a taste only.

say, or taste of his commodity. Such a taste has the hypocrite of this
heavenly gift; It seems to him a goodly thing, and worth having to him that
would go to the price. And he is willing to subscribe to the blessedness of
Gods Israel: The Lord his God is with him, and the joyful shout of a King is
amongst them Number. 23.21
. It is good being in their company at such a time, when even the King himself
shouteth for joy at their company and society. Thus his heart is tickled with
the taste and consideration of these things, as in reading of a pleasant story
which concerns his fancy more then his interest: or in hearing the description
of a pleasant country, whether he has a months mind, but no settled
resolution one day to go.

On the contrary, the true believers joy is deeply taken in, not only as
present food, Differ.
but as an earnest of more joy.

The bargain is driven and concluded between God and him. Therefore as when a
tradesman buys of the Merchant, after they have bargained, he takes some part
of the commodity which he is able to bear, home with him presently, till he can
get home the rest of his bargain: so does the believer, he carries home joy
with him, as being no burden, yet of much Contentment to him, and this he takes
as a beginning and earnest of eternal life. And God speaks unto his heart, when
he takes up this joy, as you like this, so shall you find the rest, and
better. So soon as he believes to purpose, as taking God for his own, he
rejoices with joy unspeakable. He considers of heaven as a City prepared for
him, and of God as his maine portion in it, and of joy as the chief food, he
shall there feed upon: therefore he labors to take in as much thereof at
present as he can hold, because he looks upon it as his own, with which he may
be free, and of which he hears Christ, the chief author of it, speaking to
all such as he is, Eat O friends; drink, yea drink abundantly O beloved Cant.
5.1
. He looks upon heaven as his own, in which his name is written Luke 10.20
, to be one of the possessours of it, as a portion cast out by Gods own lot for
him from all eternity, and that as his eternal inheritance for ever to be
enjoyed.

According to this interest, is his joy; a sincere, massy, substantial,
feeding, nourishing joy; a full joy, even when without outward things wherein
the hypocrite rejoices most. It is that which gives him not only contentment,
but strength. It lays hold on God even when he is departing, and lives upon
him when the believer cannot live in himself.

Thus, this hypocrite rather makes a show of joy, then ever took it down: the
true believer takes it down, even when he makes no show of it at all: the one
floteth upon the face of the water of joy, the other diveth down to the bottom
of it: the one likes it, but bargains not for it, the other sells all he
has to buy it.

This hypocrites faith throughout is but a spiders web.

Take it not only in what it seems to be: but, in what it is too in all the
parts and effects of it, it is a mere spiders web: curious, but slight;
cunningly wrought, but good for nothing; artificial, but not stable, or useful.
It is smooth as a bulrush, but not to be leaned upon. Thus God charge the
hypocrites of old, that thought much he did not save them as in former times;
they weave the spiders web Esaias 59.5
, they trust in vanity, and speak lies. All their faith was but a spiders web,
and that is no other but vanity to be trusted in: and while they speak great
swelling words of vanity, in magnifying this web, this vanity; they speak but
lies, their own consciences cannot (if they may speak) but tell them that they
know all that they speak of it to be lies. And therefore God tells them
plainly, their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
themselves with their works Verse 6
.

This is the hypocrites chief house, his strongest citadel, upon which he
leans, but it shall not stand; he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure
Job 5.15.
. He shall hold it, and thinks he needs no better, but it shall not hold him,
much less hold out with him. It seems to be a strong piece, while a man has
no need of it; but if he need a strong Fort, or Bulwark, he will soon find
this to be what Tobiah in scorn spoke of the Jews building, even that which he
builds, if a fox go up he shall even break down the stone wall Nehem. 4.3
. If this hypocrite lie down on this bed for pleasure, it may serve for a
shift; but if he be conscience-sick, and must lie by it, and trust to the
strength of the bed-coards, he will soon find the weakness of his confidence.
Every affliction how small so ever, will prove a beesome to sweep down this web
Esaias 14.23
. But trouble of conscience, will be as the hail of vengeance, that sweepeth
away the refuge of lies: and the terrors of Gods wrath; as the waters that
overflow his hiding place Esaias 28.17
.

Differ.
On the contrary; the faith of a true believer is too strong for Hell.

This makes him as Mount Zion, that cannot be removed, but abides for ever
Psalm 125.1
. No storms can overturne it, because built on a rock Matthew. 7.25.
; and on such a rock, that the gates of bell shall not prevail against Math.
16.18
. This makes the righteous to be an everlasting foundation Prove. 10.25
; when the wicked passes away as a whirl-winde. It makes the believer to be a
tree, well rooted, (because planted of the Lord Esaias 61.3
) which is not blown down by the strongest wind, but rather more settled, and
more deeply moared, or rooted; so is the faith of a true believer, by the
sharpest afflictions. The more affliction, the more assurance. That which blows
away the hypocrites trust, and dissipates his joy (as wind does a bubble)
confirms the faith of the Elect, which the more it is pressed, the more it
flourishes; the more it is trodden upon, the more fruit it yeildeth.

Abraham against hope, believed in hope Romans 4.18
; against all hope that by course of nature might be expected, he believed in
hope which by faith he had conceived in the God of nature; and prevailed.
Jonahs faith failed him not even in the Whales belly, out of the belly of hell
I cried, and thou heardst my voice Jonah 2.2
, says Jonah to God in the triumph of faith Paul, when he fought with men 1
Cor. 15.32.
, that were indeed but beasts in conditions, wanted not strength; but when he
fought with Satan that went to buffets with him 2 Cor. 12.7
, his strength was doubled. His faith laid fast hold on Gods strength, as Jacob
of the Angels, and thereby found his grace sufficient for him, and Gods
strength made perfect in man's weakness Verse 9.
.

What say I, with men, or with Satan? when Jacob had power with God, and
prevailed Hosea 12.3
; and the woman of Canaan, with Christ; who gave both the Bell, and the
Bucklers to her faith, as we use to speak? The Bell, when he cried out with
admiration, and as it were ravished with joy to see it, O woman great is thy
faith Matthew. 15.28
. Great indeed, that from the name of Dog could retort the argument, and
out-argue the Lord of reason, and make that a prevailing argument for mercy,
which Christ had used against her as his last and strongest reason to deny it;
(but such is the nature of true says, that if God take up the sword, faith
gets within his weapon, and in his very bosom sheltreth her self from his
blow.) And as he gave her the Bell, for her faith; so he even throws her the
bucklers too (which the devil could never wrest out of his hands) as unable to
stand out any longer against her; Be it unto thee, even as thou will.

Thus, the believing hypocrite has spun a fair thread of imaginary faith,
which if good for any thing, serves only as Judas his halter to hang him; but
the true believers faith is as the network of brass that encompassed the
Altar Exodus 27.4
, whereby he is secured against all annoyances: the faith of the one is like
Mephibosheth, lame of both his feet 2 Samuel 9.3
, that it is not able to stir a foot to God upon any occasion; the faith of the
other is like the Angel, having one foot upon the sea, and the other upon the
earth Revel. 10.2
, as being able to encounter and vanquish all difficulties both by sea and land.

CHAP. XXIV. The Hoping Hypocrite, Is he that hops in God without God.
AS is the mother, so is the daughter, Defin.
says the Hebrew Proverb Ezekiel. 16.44
. Such as this hypocrites faith is, such is his hope: the one is a reed shaken
with every wind; the other a bladder filled with wind; which we must
therefore prick and let out. As faith is the primum vivens, the first thing
that lives, so hope is ultimum moriens, the last that dies in a Christian. If
it were not for hope, oft-times the heart would break. While there is life,
there is hope; and while there is hope, there is life in a Christian. It
therefore concerns every one very nearly, that would enjoy clean life, as we
say, to see carefully to his hope, that he be not cheated, as this hypocrite
is, with an imaginary false hope that will perish, when he has most need to
lean upon it, and to be borne up by it.

True it is, that he can no more entitle himself to hope, than unto faith; but
he that has the forehead to lay claim to the one, will have the impudence to
challenge a right in the other. Therefore we often read of the hypocrites hope;
not that he indeed has it, but strongly imagines he has it. He believes so
with the best faith he has: therefore is that often attributed to him, which
he so confidently claims, that yet neither is, nor can be at all truly found
in him. So, we call him the hoping hypocrite, not that he truly hops, but
only seems so, and would so be esteemed.

A hope he has, and that (if you believe him) is in God; but such, as God
never wrought nor owneth. For, true hope is a supernatural grace wrought by God
in the heart of a true believer, whereby he waits and expects the
accomplishment of all the promises which by faith he has believed. God who is
the God of all grace 1 Pet. 5.10
, is particularly styled the God of hope Romans 15.13
, as being the Author as well as the object of all hope that is true. But how
can this hypocrite entitle God to his hope, whom he never knew, but by the
hearing of the ear, and whose hope is wholly destitute of all those properties
which are in that hope which God works in a believer, as we shall after
demonstrate? True hope is also as properly the daughter of faith, as grace is
the workmanship of God. Charity therefore is said to hope all things, because
it believes all things 1 Cor. 13.4
. How then can he hope any thing with a supernatural hope, that never was owner
of saving faith?

It is not denied that faith differs from hope in sundry things: faith is
before hope, and leads it up to the object, hope follows as faith leads;
they differ in their objects; faith has for its object the whole Word of God;
hope, only the promises (we believe the torments of the wicked, but we do not
hope them;) the object of faith be things past, present and to come; but the
object of hope is only something future Futura spaerant quicunque sperant.
Austin.
; the objects of faith be all things revealed, the object of hope, only good
things to come. They differ also in their acts, faith assenteth to, and
applies the promise; hope expects and waits the accomplishment; faith gives
interest, hope expects livery and seisin; faith is employed about
reconciliation and holiness of life; hope is chiefly taken up about the
retired and ravishing thoughts of glorification, the end and crown of faith;
faith in some part, takes possession of Christ here, hope waits for a more full
and glorious possession and fruition of Christ hereafter. But all these
differences notwithstanding, there is no parting of these two graces; he that
will have one must have both: he that wants the one, cannot be truly possessed
of the other. I therefore conclude that what ever this hypocrite boast of his
hope, it is but vain boasting; he will one day find it so, when God shall
unmask him, and give him the just recompense of reward, fo all his
counterfeiting, which he must expect; for, coyners and counterfeiters of the
Princes money was never reputed or punished less then high treason. And what
is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his
soul Job 27.8
? His hope, that is, his boasting of it, might be an inlet to some profit and
gain among men; but the taking away of his soul shows what his hope was at the
best.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian never hops in God, but he does it from
God.

God first by his Spirit works hope in him, before he presumes to hope in God.
He has first the habit before the exercise: And when he has that, yet he sets
it not on work without a ground to work upon. He first looks on the promise by
the eye of faith, before his hope dares expect the thing promised. Whatsoever
God promises, hope waits for; so that the promise is the ground, as well as
object of hope. Faith is the plummet, Hope the Anchor, and love the Cable of
the Christian soul. The Anchor must have ground to fasten on, ere it can secure
the ship: and the ground must be sounded by the plummet of faith, ere the
anchor be let down. Abraham had first a promise, of which faith took the depth,
and then he sets the anchor of hope, to fasten on it for the accomplishment
thereof: and so, against hope he believed in hope Romans 4.18
.

Yea, the promise is so the ground of his hope, that he makes it the only
ground. Gods goodness, power and faithfulness, looked at by some as grounds
of hope, are not so to him, without the promise: for, what warrant can he have
to hope in Gods goodness, faithfulness, or power, but by virtue of the
promise; and, that promise applied by faith? But, when once he has made sure
the promise, then these are excellent props and pillars to strengthen his hope,
even to rejoicing in hope Romans 12.12
. He therefore fastens his anchor upon the promise, and the things within it,
and upon nothing else.

He knows indeed that faith is the ground of things hoped for Heb. 11.1
; and so he makes use of it, not as the object on which hope fasteneth, for
that is only the promise; but, as the inlet to hope to fasten on the promise,
faith having first laid this foundation, that God is faithful God, and his
words are true 2 Samuel 7.28
, and he has made the promise, which faith believes, applies, and rests
on; and so lays a good ground for hope to build expectation of accomplishment
thereupon. Therefore he says, I wait for the Lord, my soul does wait, in his
Word do I hope Psalm 130.5.
. His waiting is his hoping; and, Gods Word, that is, his promise, is the
ground of his hope even in God himself.

Thus, this hypocrite, is as she that undertaking to discern a needle on the
top of an house, would still stand in it that she saw the needle, even when by
her own confession she could not see the house; for he professes to hope in
God, yet never came so near God as to believe in him, or to know what he is,
and what he has promised. The true Christian is as Abraham's servant, that when
meat was set before him, would not eat, until he had told his errand, and had
some assurance of speeding in the thing he went for; so the Christian will not
feed himself with hope, till he see what God has in store for him, upon which
he may fasten. The one hopes in God, in whom he believes not, the other
believes, and therefore hops to purpose.

This Hypocrite will hope, what he neither does, nor dares believe.

not daring to believe what he professes to hope for. It is presumption, says
he, to make too sure of my part in heaven by a certainty of says, faith must
go no further than generals. Christ came to save sinners; of which number I
hope to be one, but I dare not absolutely believe it. I shall never desire more
then a certainty of hope, leaving certainty of faith to presumptuous ones that
dare be so bold with God. Thus he divides hope and faith, which like
hypocrites twins are never asunder.

Hereby he declares plainly what his hope is, when he neither knows the
Scriptures nor the power of God. For, if faith be the ground of things hoped
for, what can he hope for that by faith he believes not? He can look upon rem
verbi, the thing promised, by hope, before he beholds verbum rei, the Word of
promise, by faith? Faith looks on the evidence and assurance which is the
promise, in regard whereof the thing promised is present to faith, which is the
evidence of things not seen Heb. 11.1.
. Hope looks on the inheritance and performance, in respect whereof the promise
is expected. And what more absurd, than that hope should have any certainty at
all without faith. any more then an anchor should have any stay without ground
to fasten upon. Hope is the anchor of the soul Heb. 6.19.
, and faith must go before to sound the ground or hope cannot do its office. No
marvail then if this hypocrites hope be as the house of spiders Job 8.13.
; for such is his vain waiting for heaven without faith, who because cannot
believe (not finding in himself the conditions and effects of faith), will yet
pretend to hope to do himself a pleasure; but by no means to believe; because
that is too much: as he accounts every thing else, which he sees in others and
cannot reach himself.

On the contrary, the Christians hope is subordinate unto faith, Differ.
what he dares not believe, he dares not hope.

He looks not upon hope as a natural prop to stay up men's hearts that have to
do with men, whom he cannot well tell what they be, or what they intend.
Sometimes their countenance, words and carriage promise fair, but without any
positive and certain engagement by word or writing: sometimes, they are more
severe and reserved: and sometimes when they promise, it is but a man's promise;
and nothing more sure than this, that men of low degree are vanity, and men of
high degree are a lie, to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter
than vanity Psalm 62.9.
; therefore here many times, let him be as strict an observer of man as he can,
and by the judgment of charity judge of him as honorably as he can, yet he
knows not well what to believe, to be sure of it; therefore he dares not be
over confident: many things fall out between the cup and the lip; and how many
have broken promise that yet have been counted very honest and just of their
words? He will therefore not be over confident: only because he sees all
things have a promising aspect, he will hope well. And further than this he
dares not go. This is humane hope in man; and yet this is all the hypocrite
has in God.

But the true Christian has to do with a God that lives for ever; and
changes not Mal. 3.6.
, nor is there in his nature so much as the least variableness or shadow of
turning James 1.17
. He knows whom he has believed, and his hope is of a more sublime and
divine extract, and given him immediately by the God of consolation 2 These.
2.16.
; therefore here keeps to the nature and rules of this hope, which is as
inseparable from faith as heat from fire. If he rejoice under hope, it is
because he has access by faith Romans 5.2.
; and never dares to expect performance by hope, till he first give glory to
God in believing the promise. And then against all discouragements of humane
hope, he believes, in divine hope Romans 4.18
; he believes so as to be in hope and assurance of the performance Credidit in
spe gratiae contraspem naturae, Austin.
. He knows that the God of hope must not only give him some joy and peace, but
fill him with all joy and peace in believing, ere he can abound in hope Romans
15.13
. And that hope so built and bottomed will never make ashamed Romans 5.5
.

Thus, this hypocrite pretending modesty betrays his ignorance and infidelity
both at once; his ignorance of the true nature of hope to which he pretends;
and his infidelity, in not believing God upon his Word; the true Christian
declares his true modesty and faith too in not daring to own any hope toward
God, but that which springs out of faith; the one plays with the word hope,
without the thing; the other improves the thing to the utmost, because he has
both word and thing in him.

This hypocrites hope is carnal.

It savours more of the dunghill, not only for the pedigree and extract, but for
the use and exercise of it. For, how ever this hypocrite will sometimes seem
very eager after the things above, as David longed much after some of the
waters of Bethlehem; yet, as David would not drink it, but poured it out upon
the ground 2 Samuel 23.16.
, when brought unto him, so this hypocrite is not inwardly so hasty or thirsty
after the things of heaven, when God even thrusts them into his bosom, and
stretches out his hand all the day long, to persuade and draw him to accept
thereof; he will rather pour out this water of life upon the ground, Romans 10.21
or cast it behind him; and, when Christ again and again, yea, very often
would have gathered him in for himself, as an hen her chickens under her wing,
he would not come at him Mat. 23.37
: But he runs yapping or chirping after any meat thrown by any other hand
before him, or rather lies scraping in a dunghill, till the Kite make him his
prey.

So that, if you mark him strictly, you shall see him for one wish for true
grace, to put out ten for a large estate, peace and freedom from trouble in
the world, for towardly children, and good portions for them; for honor,
preferment; his hopes run most naturally and strongly this way. O that I
could once get such or such a thing done! then were I made for ever (perhaps,
undone for ever:) but as for heaven, and for giving you an account of his hopes
that way, and of the reason of that hope which he vaunts to be very high in
him: you shall seldom or never hear him that way inclined, unless when he is
casually asked the question: and then commonly he gives such an answer as tends
more to commend himself, than to give glory to God, unless from the teeth
outward: rather to save his credt, than to comfort his soul from any solid
ground of consolation laid up in him.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christians hope is heavenly.

He labors not so much strengthen his hope touching the things of this life,
as to get assurance of better, that is, of heavenly and everlasting
consolations and of good hope through grace. He neglects not the meanest
promise for the meanest b essing of this life, no more then he rests in the
greatest. He looks higher, he never rests satisfied, till he get the hope
laid up for him in heaven Col. 1.5.
, and hope for it with full assurance unto the end Heb. 6.11.
. His hope is as the needle truly touched with the lodestone, that never stands
still, till it directly point to the North Pole; it never rests and fixes on
any thing below heaven. Yea, heaven it self is too little to satisfy his hope,
unless God himself may be had and enjoyed too, Whom have I in heaven but thee,
and there is none on earth that I desire beside thee Psalm 73.25:
. Here his hope is in his element: here would he dwell, till he enjoy his hopes.

Thus, this hyp^crite pretending for heaven, lays out all his hopes upon earth,
as the Mariner that roweth one way, and looks another; the true Christian
sets his hope in God, and affections on things above, and not on things
below Col. 3.2.
; the one has his eye toward heaven, and his heart in the dunghill; the hope
of the other is as the woman clothed with the Sun, having the Moon under her
feet Rev. 12.1.
.

This hypocrites hope is Popish hope.

This has been in part made out before Charact. 1.
. But that is not all nor the worst; for he that dares not be assured of God by
an assurance of faith, dares hope in himself, as believing there is cause. He
believes he has good works enough to warrant his hope in God; yea he believes it
to be no better than presumption to hope without merit. Thus with the Pharisee,
he delights to tell God a story of his own good works. But he thinks to salve
all with this, that he places no confidence in works done by strength of
nature, or before regeneration and justification, but such as the fruits of the
grace of God in his heart. And did the Pharisee do less? He begins his story
with God, I thank thee I am not as other men Luke 18.11.
. He attributes to God and his grace, his being better than others: so that a
Pharisee, a Papist, and this hypocrite all agree in this one conclusion that
their hope must be grounded in part at least upon their upon their own works
and merits, or they offend in hoping; which offers an high affront to the free
grace of God, as if his grace without concurrence of man's merit were not ground
sufficient to hope in God, notwithstanding all his promises in Christ.

On the contrary, the true Christians hope is a despairing hope. Differ.


Not in the sense of the hypocrite who despaireth of God unless he find
somewhat in himself to eek out his hope; but in David's sense, I will not trust
in my bow, neither shall my sword save me Psalm 44.6.
. He despaires of any thing of his own, that he may hope only in God, as he had
before expressed himself, through thee will we push down our enemies; through
thy Name will we tread them under that rise up against us Verse 5.
. In the same instant wherein he begins to hope for heaven, he utterly
despaires of all means and merits of his own to bring him thither, and
cordially joyneth with the people of God in that just confession; We are all as
an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, we all fade
as a leaf, and our iniquities; like the wind, have taken us away Esaias 64.6.
; and therefore he wholly relieth upon the free grace, and undeserved mercy of
God in Christ, as that self-condemned Jesuit Bellarm. Tutius est etc.
, after all his wranglings and forced concludings against it, is even compelled
to conclude this to be the safest way.

Thus, this hypocrite is a proud man that transgresses by the wine Hab. 2.5.
of pride, which the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth Rev. 17.5.
, has caroused to him, and put to his nose to make him drunk also Hab. 2.15.
. He will not so much as hope for heaven, unless he may, in part at least,
earne it at his fingers ends: the true Christian when he looks upon himself,
is as the Publican, smiting upon (if not his breast, yet) his heart, and
saying, God be merciful unto me a sinner Luke 18.13.
; and when he looks upon God, he says, In God we boast all the day long Psalm
44.8.
; the one will not trust in God without some hope of himself, the other cannot
hope in God, until he despair of himself.

This hypocrites hope is a lazy loytering hope.

He feign would have heaven, and hopes for it; but he makes no have toward it,
or to make sure of it. Counterfeit hope is in show very modest, because in
truth but a counterfeit, and knows well that she shall come short of what she
hopes for, and therefore no have, to be made ashamed. Shame will come fast
enough upon her, although she make no haste toward it. Few people after
sentence, make haste to the whipping post, or galllows. This hypocrite knows
his hope must perish, therefore he will hold it up, and himself in it; so long
as he can. Hence he will tell you, he is not so hasty to be gone out of the
world, as some pretend to be; he can stay for heaven, till his work be done on
earth. And, if God will let him live to Methusalems age, before he take him out
of the world, he shall be very well contented: not because he can hope for any
great content here, but because he has less hope of any when departed hence.

And, as for those things which strike terror to the wicked, and are as
daggers to his heart, death and judgment: he is so far from hoping for either
of those days, that he heartily wishes they may never come, and trembles to
hear and think that they will come, as not only Faelix an Heathen, not yet
admitted within the pales of the Church, did at the very mention of the
judgment to come Acts 24.25.
; but even the sinners in Zion are afraid; and among them none like the
hypocrite, who is nothing but trembling all over, to consider how ill he shall
be able to dwell with devouring fire, and everlasting burnings Esaias 33.14
. Thus, the hope of the hypocrite is not so earnest or hasty, it can very well
stay; and the longer the better.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the hope of a Christian is earnest for the thing hoped for.

When once he is in hope of the thing believed, his hope makes him earnest for
the possession of it. Hence Paul calls his hope his earnest expectation. Yea,
the expectation that is in all creatures to be delivered from the vanity and
bondage of corruption to which they are subject by man's sin, until the
dissolution of the world, Phil 1.20.
is called a groaning and travailing in pains Romans 8.22
, even as a woman in travail longs to be delivered, and thinks even the
shortest time long, till she be over that work. There is nothing that looks
like hope, but it is very earnest, much more then is true hope earnest, not in
show only, but in deed. He says as David, my soul waits for the Lord, more
then they that watch for the morning; and lest men should think he had watched
so long that he spoke this between sleeping and waking, not well knowing what
he said (no more then Peter, on Mount Tabor) he repeats it again, I say, more
then they that watch for the morning Psalm 130.6.
. Look how a poor watchman, that has sat up and been abroad in a cold night
(whiles others has been taking their rest and sleep in their warm beds) does
watch for the first break of day, that he be discharged and take some rest
also; so earnest is a Christian after God, when once he truly hops in him.
Neither is true hope dulled or discouraged, but rather whetted and made more
earnest, by delays. As Gregory the Great has well observed. Cuncta desideria
dilatione crescunt; si non, desideria non fuerunt. All desires are increased by
delay: if not, they were never true desires: wishes they may be, hope they are
not.

Yea, hope is so earnest, that it is earnest by grace, for that which is to
nature most terrible. What more terrible than death? yet the Christian desires
to depart and to be with Christ Phil. 1.23.
; he has in him (...), a lusting, a longing after it. What so dreadful, as the
last day? yet even the Christian (who in many things sins every day) can no
sooner hear a message from Christ, surely, I come quickly: but the Christian
catches it as hastily as ever Benhadads servants did the word of Ahab, to save
their masters life, and takes him at his word, Amen, Even so come Lord Jesus
Rev. 22.20.
. Not that such a day can be without terror, even to a Paul 2 Cor. 5.11
, in regard of the expectation of nature: but yet it is otherwise to grace, and
to this grace of hope; for this makes them, who have received the first fruits
of the Spirit, (...), to groan (or sigh even with tears) waiting for the
Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of their bodies Romans 8.23.
; and still to be looking for, and hastening to the coming of the day of God 2
Pet. 3.12.
.

Thus, this hypocrite pretending hope of heaven, makes no more haste out of the
world, than Lot out of Sodom Genesis 19.16
: the true Christian hearing of Christ's coming, is as the Spirit and the Bride,
that says come Rev. 22.17.
. The one talks much of heaven, but likes well to stay upon earth; the other is
so full of his hope, that he looks upon his body as fetters, and on the world
as his fail.

This hypocrites hope in some things is very impatient.

He is not so patient and well contented, to stay for heaven and the day of
judgment, but he is on the other side as eager, earnest, and impatient after
the enjoying of his hopes on earth. Here he must be served presently, or God
shall hear of him, and the world shall ring of him. If he do but hold up his
finger to heaven, he thinks God must attend him presently, and that he should
be with him at a whistle. But, if he not only pray, but fast too, and God do
not presently answer and gratify him, although it be but in some sinful
request to enable him to commit more wickedness, he presently arraignes God,
at the hypocrites own bar, Wherefore have we fasted, says he, and thou see
not? wherefore have we afflicted our souls, and thou take no knowledge Esaias
58.3.
?

If any evils befall him, or others, and he has waited some time for their
removal, but sees them continued: he flees out into a rage, yea breaks out into
blasphemy, this evil is of the Lord, what should I wait for the Lord any longer
2 King. 6.33.
. He thinks he may justify any impatiency and malapert carriage toward God,
if God make him wait but an hour beyond the time that this hypocrite sets him.
If God cross him in his hopes of outward things: then, hope and wait who
will: for his part he will take another course: he has not the patience to
tarry the Lords leisure: he will not longer follow providence; but either lead
it, or leave it.

Differ.
On the contrary, the hope of a Christian is a patient hope.

He can be as earnest as another for heavenly things truly hoped for; but he
can with all wait the Lords leisure for any things of this life. Therefore as
hope is an expectation, so it is a waiting too; for if we hope for that we see
not, we do with patience wait for it Romans 8.25
. Hence the Christian when he hops, says, I wait for the Lord, my soul does
wait, in his Word do I hope Psalm 130.5.
; then he hops in the Lord, when he waits patiently for him ^salme 37.7.
. True hope makes a Christian patient till God satisfy his hopes; therefore
patience is called the patience of hope 1 These. 1.3.
, as being no less requisite to hope then water to blood in the veins. For he
finds that things hoped for are not visible, unless to faith: hope that is
seen as present to the eye, is no hope; for what a man sees, Romans 8.24
why does he yet hope for? He also considers that the chiefest things hoped
for, are furthest off. It will or may be a long time before he be in full
possession of heaven, and of God in glory. He must go to heaven through the
grave, where his flesh also must rest in hope Psalm 16.9.
, and there it must stay and rot, and dissolve to dust, ere it be raised and
possessed of its hope. Yea, there is one thing more that will exercise patience
to purpose, and that is, the flouts and scoffs of hopeless wretches in the
world, that mock and persecute him as Ishmael did Isaac Gal 4.29
, and as the wretched Jews did Christ upon the cross Mat. 27.43
, for his very hope. Thus Paul found it to befall him and his fellows. Therefore
we suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God 1 Timothy 4.10.
. In all which respects the Christian is well aware that he has need of
patience (and accordingly arms himself with it), that when he has done the
will of God, he may receive the promise Heb. 10.36
.

Thus, this hypocrite discovers his hope to be counterfeit in expecting
heavenly things by this, that there he can be content to stay long enough;
while in the mean time he is so impatient in earthly things hoped for, that he
will not tarry the Lords time and leisure to receive them; the true Christian
declares his hope to be right in that it can both hope and quietly wait for the
salvation of the Lord Lam. 3.26
, till the Lords time come; and that although it tarry, yet he waits for it,
till at the end it speaks Hab. 2.3
; the one is as Saul that will not tarry till Samuel comes, although Samuel
delayeth not a day set for his coming 1 Samuel, 13.9
, the other, Verse 10.
is as the husbandman that waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and
has long patience for it James 5.7.
.

The hypocrites hope is a dull melancholic hope.

He talks of hope, but so sadly and dully as if his heart were fuller of
sadness and fear, than of hope; his hope in God breeds no cheerfulness in
him: he is like David under a cloud, the act of of whose hope is intermitted;
his soul is cast down and disquieted within him Psalm 42.5.
, not because he hoped, but because at present he did not hope in God, which
David calls upon his soul to do. But it was never so with David, when he
actually exercised his hope: for, even then, when he hoped not, he could tell
his soul, that if she would but hope in God, he should soon turn his mourning
into joy: hope in God, for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my
countenance and my God Psalm 43.5.
; and this he could not apprehend, but he must needs praise him with joyful
lips Psalm 63.5
. But the hypocrite is all amort and lumpish at heart, even when he talks most
of his hopes. Even in laughter his heart is sorrowful, and the end of his mirth
is heaviness Prove. 14.13
, because his hope must perish Job 8.13
.

He may sometimes force a mirth upon himself, and be thereby merry at heart too
for a while. But he is never the merrier for his hope; his mirth is from some
other cause, either wealth flows in upon him, he has had the better of his
adversary, he swims in pleasure, or he is naturally cheerful, but the joy of
the wicked is but short, and the rejoicing of the hypocrite is but for a moment
Prove. 4.13.
. God will unmask him, and turn his inside outward, wherein every man may read
written upon his heart, lamentations, and mourning, and woe Ezekiel. 2.10. as upon
Ezekiels roll.
.

On the contrary, the Christians hope is a merry hope.

Not merry, like Nabals when he was drunk 1 Samuel 35.36
, but as the people, Differ.
feasted by Sololomon at the Dedication of the Altar, who were glad and merry
in heart for the goodness of the Lord 2 Chro. 7.10.
. He rejoices in hope Romans 12.12
; sometimes joy in believing goes before and makes way for hope Romans 15.13
, As David, when he speaks of his hope, he makes joy the prologue, my heart is
glad, my tongue rejoices, and then adds, My flesh also shall rest in hope
Psalm 16.9.
. Here joy is the inlet to hope. But hope is never without true joy as the
result of it, because hope expects, and makes sure of the chiefest object of
the greatest joy.

Sometimes hope deferred proves the fainting of the heart, making the heart
sick Prove. 13.12
; but this is humane, not true supernatural hope, the hope of the hypocrite,
not of the Christian; for he can wait when the hypocrite will not, and is sure,
that early or late, in Gods good time, the desire, that is, the thing hoped
for, comes to him, and shall be to him as a tree of life. And albeit the
object of hope be some good not yet enjoyed, while the object of joy is present
good in possession, yet the Christian looks at two things at once in his hope,
the one is, the assurance of the thing promised and by faith believed, and this
causes expectation and waiting; the other is the excellency of the thing
assured, and this causes joy; for if glory be promised, and hoped for, he will
rejoice under the hope of the glory of God Romans 5.3
. And to speak properly and truly, there is no joy but in hope (except joy in
believing) for what joy can any man take in the things of this life, if he
seriously consider that he has no hope of a better? If in this life only we
have hope, even, in Christ himself, we are of all men most miserable 1 Cor.
15.19
. Can a man rejoice, when he indeed considers that he lies under the
greatest misery? It is only for a fool to go laughing to the stocks; and for a
beast to go leaping and skipping to the shambles Prove. 7.22.
.

Thus, as Caine had his countenance cast down, notwithstanding his sacrifice
Genesis 4.5
; so this hypocrite has a sad heart in the midst of all his most glorious
pretenses to very high hopes: Genesis 17.17
the true Christian is as Abraham, laughing for joy at the news of a Son,
when he had given so much glory to God Romans 4.18, etc
, as to believe and hope it, how improbable and impossible soever the
performance of that promise was to flesh and blood; in the ordinary course of
nature: the one derogates more from God by his dumpish sadness, then he gives
him honor by his hope; the other honors God both in his hope that is true,
and in his joy that is full.

The hypocrites hope is a loose and unclean hope.

His hope has no cleansing property in it, it suffers him to be as lewd,
filthy, and secure in his lewdness as the Atheistical Epicure in Maenander,
Let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall die 1 Cor. 15.32
. He talks much of his hopes to go to heaven, but he never provides for it by
cleansing himself from that filthiness which is in him, and will lie as a
barin his way. His hope is at full tide, yet cannot spare one tear for sin, he
has no hand for the poor, nor for any good work. He has no stomach to endure
fasting, no knees for praying, no time for humiliation, for washing his hands,
or for purifying his heart James 4.8
. He knows God is merciful, and therefore he will take the more liberty in
sin. If God should, says he, deal with me according to justice, then I
confess I am gone and undone. But God, he hopes, will be more merciful then
so, there be thousands in the same case, which, God forbid, should go to hell.
Wherefore serves Christ but to keep him and them thence? Many such roaring
hopers there are in the world, that talk this out aloud; and if God will accept
of him upon these terms, well and good; if not, he will run the hazard. But,
this hypocrite is of a more demure and austere deportment: he professes hope
with his lips, and does keep in from open and professed debauchednesse; yet in
his heart he so carries his confidence, that he concludes, he shall have peace
howsoever: to all such may justly be applied that of the Prophet, Jer. 2.37.
The Lord has rejected your confidences, ye shall not prosper in them.

Differ.
Contrarily, true hope is a purging hope.

Hope is to the Christian under Christ, a refiners fire, and fullers soap Mal.
3.2
, it will separate the dross from the gold, it will purge out all that filth,
and those spots that ordinary water cannot cleanse. He that has this hope
purges himself even as God is pure 1 John 3.3
. What hope, but that of being made like unto God in a more glorious manner
then now we are capable of, when we shall in glory see him as he is Verse 2.
? He that has those promises that God will be his Father, and he shall be his
son, will purge himself from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and perfect
holiness in the fear of God 2 Cor. 7.1
. For well he knows, that this God requires of all that desire and expect him
to be a Father. Come out from among them, and be ye separate, says the Lord,
and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you 2 Cor. 6.17
; he therefore mortifieth his earthly members, fornication, etc. upon this very
account and hope, that when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall
we appear with him in glory Col. 3.4, 5
. He that is most in hope is most employed in mortification and holiness of
life; his hope is like a careful governor that stirs him up to all duty;
upon expectation of a full reward. Because he is assured, that though the Gates
of heaven stand open to him and for him day and night, yet there shall in no
wise enter into it any thing that defiles, or works abomination, or makes a
lie Rev. 21.27.
.

Thus, as the four Lepers that being put out of the gates of Samaria, fell to
the Host of the Syrians 2 King. 7.3, 4
, minded their bellies more then their cure; so this hypocrite, if he can but
compass what he hopes for, let others look out for holiness that will; but
the true Christian is as the Leper that is first healed of his leprosy by
Christ, before he will press into the presence of God to show himself to the
Priest Mat. 8.4
; the one presses into the marriage feast without a wedding garment, and so is
cast out with disgrace and confusion: the other is as the Lambs wife that makes
her self ready for the marriage, by being arrayed in fine linen clean and
white Rev. 19.7, 8
, and so she is married to the Lord for ever Hos. 3.19
.

This hypocrites hope is uncertain and doubtful.

If he be not careless altogether, but looks a little about him, he knows his
hope to be of so base an original, and so mere a phantasme that well may he
doubt, not as one of little faith, but as having none at all. Therefore he is
always wavering, floating like a wave of the sea. Now in some hope, by and by
concluding there is no hope Jer. 2.25.
; And because he knows that if it be once taken for granted, that hope gives
assurance, then he is gone: therefore seeing he cannot hope to get assurance
himself, he will do his best (or rather his worst) to drive all others from
assurance too, that all may fare alike.

Hence, he calls assurance of salvation an unhappy security, presumption and a
faithless persuasion Rhem. Annot. in 1 Cor. 7.27,
; and so it must needs be in him that is so void of faith.

On the contrary, Differ.
the hope of a Christian gives full assurance of the thing hoped for.

I deny not but some who have true hope may be without assurance, as he that is
truly living may be without health. But where hope has her perfect work, it
works assurance, as naturally as life produces not only motion, but a good
state of health that the body may move with more vivacity and activity. As
faith begets a plerophory of faith; so hope, a full assurance of hope to the
end Heb. 6.11
. Hence hope is compared to an Anchor, and is called the Anchor of the soul,
which has these two properties, to be both sure and steadfast verse 19
; now an Anchor must take not only true hold, but fast hold, or it can never
secure the ship. If it take fast hold the ship is safe, unless the ground be
loose and uncertain: but here is no fear of that, because this Anchor enters
into that which is within the veil, which is no other then Christ himself now
in heaven, and there appearing in the presence of God for us.

Yea, such assurance does hope give to a Christian (unless when
extraordinarily assaulted by some violent tentation) that it makes him (having
a promise believed by faith) to hope, as Abraham, not only for things
difficult, but even impossible in nature, and contrary to all humane reason: as
he did for a son long after Sarah was past childbearing. And even the
troubled conscience, when most tossed on the waves of tentation, dares not let
go his hold to cast off all hopes of heaven, when it sees nothing but hell
before him, but resolves thus, though he slay me, yet will I trust in him Job
13.15 Seneca.
, and is of his mind, qui nihil potest sperare desperet nihil. He that cannot
hope at all, let him not despair; for though he has nothing in himself to
ground hope upon, yet when he looks upon the promise, there is hold enough for
his anchor.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the adversaries of Judah, that when they could not
be permitted to build with Gods people, hired Counselors to hinder the work
Ezra 3.4, 5
; so he sets Jesuits and others to plead against that assurance, which he
cannot get: the true Christian is as Zerubbabel, bringing forth the head-stone
thereof with shouting, crying, grace unto it Zech. 4.7.
; the one disgraceth the assurance of hope, because not acquainted with it, the
other gives her her just due, as having experience of it.

This hypocrites hope is a presumptuous hope.

He is ever in extremes, without taking hold on the mean. Either he is all for
doubting, or all for presumption. If he be not for controversy, to dispute
against hope, he is for impudence to abuse the name of hope while he goes on in
wickedness. Either he bears himself out upon his hope, even when he knows and
confesses that he walloweth in all iniquity without so much as ever thinking
to do otherwise, in hope God will be kinder then he threatens to be Luke 29.29
; or at least makes bold at the present to go on in sin, taking day to repent
hereafter, presuming he shall live to that day, and have grace at command, to
repent, as the fool that having gotten wealth, thinks of nothing but of
enlarging his barns, and gives his soul her glut of pleasure for many years,
when he had not one day more to live Luke 12.18, 19, 20.
. Or he builds upon his external formal profession of Religion, and from thence
concludes an assured hope of salvation, when he cannot be ignorant that his
heart is like the inside of the Pharisees pot, filthy throughout, how fair
soever the outside be, to whom Christ denounces a woe, and denies salvation
Mat. 23.25
.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christians hope is humble, and coupled with fear.

He never looks with hope upon the promise of entering into Gods rest, but he
fears lest he should through unbelief, impenitency, or other miscarriage, even
seem to come short of it Heb. 4.1
. He will so manage his hope, and his hope will so qualify him, that he will
be so circumspect and diligent in all his walking, as not only not to fall
short of heaven, but not so much as give any occasion to himself or others, as
to seem come short of it. He will walk exactly, accurately Ephesians. 5.15
, and look diligently lest he fail of the grace of God Heb. 12.15
; lest by any carelessness, earthly mindedness, or other lust he abate or
cool, or blunt the edge and activity of any grace of God within him; working
out that salvation which he thus hoped for, with fear and trembling Phil. 2.12
, not as doubting the issue of his diligence, but as fearing, yea, trembling at
the very thoughts of giving way to negligence; lest that happen to him which
befell Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright, and afterward
when he would have inherited the blessing, was rejected, though (when it was
too late) he sought it carefully with tears Heb. 12.16, 17
.

Thus, this hypocrite takes that counsel of the Devil, which Christ with
indignation refused, casting himself headlong from the highest pinnacle of
presumption, hoping for some good Angel to save him from destruction; the true
Christian has learned of his Master, not so to tempt the Lord his God Mat. 4.7.
; the one abuses his hope to his irrecoverable ruin, the other improveth it
to his everlasting salvation.

CHAP. XXV. The Fauning Hypocrite, or feigned Lover. Is he that, in loving,
loves not.
AMong those glorious Stars, Faith, Hope, and Charity. Defin.
Charity is of the first magnitude; the greatest of these is Charity 1 Cor.
13.13
, Faith and Hope have their use, but Love is transcendent. Faith and Hope are
wrought by God, yet are not in him: but, God is Love. Faith and Hope bring us
unto God, but Love shall be turned into union with him in heaven; they bring us
to heaven, but this shall abide in heaven. Among the elements, fire is most
eminent; among metals, gold is most refulgent; among the stars, the Sun is
most resplendent; and among graces, love is supereminent. Therefore the
hypocrite will be tampering with this grace above all other. As we have
therefore traced him in his walks and attempts upon Faith and Hope; so we must
now enquire into his arts and disguises in the matter of his love.

All graces have need to beware of being alloyed by the levaen of hypocrisy;
but, most of all, love the bond of perfection Col. 3.14.
; which, being more familiar, and communicative, is most apt to be
counterfeited and abused: Philosophers make Justice the sum of all virtues,
but God makes love the comprehensive grace that contains in it all duties,
even to the fulfilling of his own whole Law Romans 13.10
. Therefore Christianity sets love in the first place, like the chief of the
first three, among David's worthies 2 Samuel 23.
; being the mother of Justice her self, and giving form unto her. A just
action not done out of love, is not justice. All duties proceed from love, and
love is a duty that is owing to all. He loves not, that performs not every
duty out of love. He pays not his debts, that renders not love: this is a
debt that grows due faster then it can be paid, and must be always paying,
when all other debts are discharged. A man must not only give; but in giving
love, says the Philosopher, he may leave giving, but not loving. Among
spiritual graces (which are all Kings daughters, of the blood royal coming down
from the Father of lights) love as the principal Lady of honor, holds up the
train of faith in the wedding solemnity, and is given with her, as Bilhah with
Rachel to bear fruit for her unto Christ.

This makes love to be so often counterfeited, where true love is wanting. Many
that are far from love, yet being ashamed to profess hatred, cover their
hatred by deceit, till their wickedness can be hid no longer, but showed
before the whole Congregation Prove. 26.26
. Simulation and love are incompatible. He that loves, cannot feign, and he
that feignes, cannot love. He therefore that counterfeits love, is worse then
he that coyneth counterfeit money. The Devil began his legerdemaine, he first
invented, and practiced this Art upon our first parents, pretending more love
to man than God himself; he having even then seven abominations in his heart to
blow up all mankind at a blast.

Ever since, he has kept a School of deceivers, wherein he has trained up many
cunning Scholars, but none like the religious hypocrite: nor in any age has he
brought forth so many Crafts-masters in this trade, as in this: never more
show, never so little love. He that hates, dissembleth with his lips, and
lays up deceit within him Prove. 26.24
. They speak vanity every man to his neighbor, with flattering lips, and with
a double heart do they speak Psalm 12.2.
.

But this hypocrite exceeds the ordinary sort and size of dissemblers with men;
for he carries his dissembling up as high as God himself, and seeks to put as
great a cheat upon heaven, as upon earth; being grown so cunning, as those
cut-purses and pick-pockets that will use their Art, not only in the face of
the Court, or at the very time and place of execution of some of their fellows:
but, will pick the pocket of the Judge himself. God may say to him, as Dalilah
to Sampson Judge. 16.15.
, How can thou say I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? All is but
lip-love. He flattereth him with his mouth, Psalm. 78.36
and lies unto him with his tongue (x). Pity it is, that so excellent a virtue
as love, should be so embased. Indeed, he many times dissembles with an ill
grace, as he that carries a long sword unker a short cloak; and sometimes he is
taken in the manner. But yet he will adventure again, and force his endeavor
beyond his Art, delighting in no trade so much as to be a Jacob to supplant his
brother; or, a Judas, to betray his Master; or, a Devil, to outface his Maker.
He covers hatred with a cloak of love, in dealing both with God and man. He
will put his skill to the venture, though loath to bring it to the trial. He
ever returns hatred for love, and ever makes show of most love when he
intends greatest hatred: not that he always means so, or has it in heart to
think so; howbeit in the issue it always proves so. For he that makes show of
love without real intention of good, does really hate, although at present he
intends no ill.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians love is real, it is, what it shows to be.

He keeps to his rule; and therefore loves not in word, or in tongue only, but
in deed and in truth 1 John 3.18
. For well he knows that this is made by God himself a most distinguishing
character between those that are made up of guile, and those that savor of
sincerity, to dare to look God in the face; for, hereby we know that we are of
the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him verse 19
. The deed witnesses our love, and the truth sanctifies it: or rather, the
deed witnesses it before men; and the truth, before God to our own
consciences. He knows that among others, love, and true love are for the most
part two things; but, in himself he would have them an Identity, because he
would have his love to be (as it is required) (...), without dissimulation Romans
12.9
.

It is true, that love is no love, unless it be true, no more then the picture
of a man is truly a man. Nevertheless, he that seeks for love in the world,
shall meet with more pictures of it, than substance; and those pictures, to
bear away the name of love from that which is love indeed. The Christian that
he may not deceive with a show, purifieth himself to the unfeigned love of the
brethren 2 Pet. 1.22
: because the end of the Commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a
good conscience, and faith unfeigned 1 Timothy 1.5
; he strives therefore to demonstrate (...), the naturalnesse, that is, the
sincerity of his love in all things 2 Cor. 8.8
. He loves naturally, that is, as borne with it (in his regeneration) in his
heart, loving with a pure heart fervently, being born again, etc. 1 Pet. 1.22,
23
striving so to love, as Christ has loved him John 15.12
.

Thus, this hypocrites love is more in show then in substance; the true
Christians love is more in substance then in show; the one pretends love, as
Absalom did justice, when he meant to be most injurious; and, kissed those whom
he meant to draw into rebellion 1 Samuel 15.4, 5
; the other has learnt of Christ, to do more then he will promise; the one
makes a show of what he never meant, John 16.26
the other truly intends what he shows forth both to God and man.

This hypocrite loves God, but not for God.

We will take a view of his fauning first upon God, then upon man; and, in both
discover him to be but a feigned lover.

He would be thought not only a lover of God, from his cradle; but, to go
beyond all others in love, yet never went so far as to love him truly. He
loves God; but, for his own ends John 6.26
; as a flatterer Psalm 78.36
, not as a friend; to gain by him Acts 19.25
, not to bring honor to him. He loves himself in God; not God for himself. He
loves God to serve his own turn, not to serve God. As God, he hates him; as
omnipotent, he fears him: but, loves him only to serve himself of him. He makes
use of God that he may enjoy the world, rather than use the world so, that he
may enjoy God; If he may be sure of wages, he will serve God for a while; but,
God and he are of two such cross and contrary dispositions, that he cannot
heartily love him, even while he serves him. And therefore when he has
received his wages that he served for, he oft-times leaves his service, without
giving him lawful warning. He loves God, if you will believe him, but, hates
his brother made in the image of God, and therefore is not to be believed 1
John 4.20
. His love is mercenary, as the Switzers soldiery for the sold, or pay,
whatever the cause be. As the hireling loves his Master, not for himself, but
for his wages.

On the contrary, the true lover, loves God for himself. Differ.


He loves God, not only for what he does; but, for what he is. He has reason
to love him for his love. But finds cause to love him more for himself. The
object of love is some excellency in the thing love fasteneth upon. If it love
more for somewhat in that object which feeds the lovers humor, and suits best
with his disposition, this is lust, not love: for he loves him in hope to
enjoy what himself has a mind unto, rather than for what the party in himself
truly is, without reflection upon himself. And this love is mercinary, if not
fornicatory. Ille mercenarius, etc. He is a mercenary that has his eye upon
the wages more then upon the work. And he is no better then a fornicator, who
loves God merely to enjoy his own pleasure. But the true Christian loves God
better then all the world, yea, better then heaven it self; Whom have I in
heaven but thee Psalm 73.25
? he loves him for himself. He cares not for heaven, were it not for God. Nay,
heaven is no heaven to him without God.

Not that it is unlawful to love God for, what he does for those that love him;
but, that it is more noble and genuine, to love him for what he is in himself.
We cannot be without the former, therefore good reason we should love him for
the supply he affords. I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice, and
my supplication Psalm 116.1.
, says he that was no feigned lover, but yet, because that is a truth in
Divinity as well as in Philosophy, Quod efficit tale, est magis tale, that
which makes good in the effect, is much more good in the cause. Therefore,
every man that rightly understands the worth of the effect, must needs know the
cause and fountain whence that effect issued, to be worth much more: and that,
if any thing in the effect requires love, the goodness of the cause
commands it much more: So that the Christian is then most rational, when he
most passionately loves God for himself. The infinite wisdom, goodness,
power, holiness, love, mercy that is in God, as in the Ocean, must needs
attract more love from a wise and considerate lover, than those streams that
issue thence. Herein the Christian takes pattern from God. God loves for his
own sake; therefore a true lover loves God chiefly for God, as he is in
himself. For he that loves God because God loved him first 1 John 4.19
, and duly considers that God did thus not for his sake that now loves God:
but, for his own, who was first in the love: he cannot but make that the chief
ground and object of his love in God, which God himself made to be his own in
loving man.

Thus, the hypocrites love to God is like that of Amnon to Tamar 2 Samuel 13.2
and 15.
, he was first sick for her; and then having satisfied his lust, was upon all
other accounts more sick of her; the true Christian is as Ruth that loved
Naomi, even when she had no more sons in her womb, of which, Ruth might hope
to choose another husband Ruth 1.11
; the one loves God to make God his servant: the other loves God to be his
servant; the one loves God as a King that can advance him; the other as the
fountain of holiness that does delight him.

This hypocrite loves God, but not in Christ.

He loves him as a God able to help him in his need; but not as a father, out
of pure natural affection. He may love him as a Jupiter, an helping father; but
not as a Father in Christ by Covenant Joh. 20.17 2 Cor. 6.18
. He loves him as Lions and other beasts of the wilderness, who seek their
meat from God Psalm. 104.21
, but not as a child going to a father for bread. He loves him for a blessing
upon his land, for the precious things of heaven, that is; for the dew of
heaven, and for the deep that coucheth beneath; and for the precious fruits
brought forth by the Sun, and for the precious things put forth by the Moon,
and for the precious things of the earth, and the fullness thereof Deuteronomy. 33 13,
14
, rather then for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush Verse 16
, upon his soul: or, for those rich and precious promises whereby he might
partake of the divine nature, and escape the corruptions that are in the world
through lust 2 Pet. 1.4
. He looks up to Gods providence, more than to his promise; as a Creator,
rather then as a Father in Christ; as his creature, rather then as a child
accepted in the beloved Ephesians. 1.6
. He desires rather thriving children, than an heavenly Father: a barn well
filled, than a God of grace: a good flock of sheep, rather than the good
shepherd; a good teeme of Oxen, rather then a strong God, as his by Covenant
Psalm. 144.12, 13, 14.
. He has good skill in the blessing, as Herams servants had in hewing timber
to make an house for the God which they knew not; but, little of Solomon's
knowledge of the true God for whom the house was built; or, of the interest his
people have in him. He never looks after a Christ; but when he is dropping into
hell: or as roaring boys that never mention him, nor think of him, but when
they swear by him. Let him have the blessing, and let others dispute the
title, or his interest in it. He that loves not God for Gods sake, will not
much look after Christ, so he may have what he loves better then either.

Differ.
On the contrary, The true Christian never thinks of loving God without Christ.

He considers that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself 2
Cor. 5.19
; that therefore there is no loving of God, but in the same Christ; naturally
man hates God, and must be reconciled, ere he can love him. He then in whom he
is reconciled, must be the person, the medium, in which he meets God to love
him. Yea, he knows that there is no coming at God but by Christ. He must be
Christ's before he be Gods: and even then, no man comes to the Father, but by
him John 14.6
. And the Father bl^sseth him with all spiritual blessings in Christ Ephesians. 1.3
. So that as we come not at God but in and by Christ; so neither does God come
at us, but in and by the same Christ. He must therefore love God in Christ, or
not at all.

Nor does he love God in Christ as the way unto him only; but, as in the
relation of a son to his father He loves him with a filial love, as made a
son in Christ, accepted in the beloved Ver. 6.
, and as expecting such love from God as becomes his adoption, more than as
fitted to his present necessities as his creature and servant. He looks not for
ordinary things only which every servant in the family may expect, but he
expects a love due to an heir; and, in that capacity, loves him, not only as
his strength Psalm 18.1
, but as his Father that has given him his Son; and, with him all things
Romans 8.32
; as, all things are his, and as he is Christ's, and Christ is Gods 1 Cor. 3.21,
23
. His love can no more reach God without Christ, then he can reach the Sun with
his hand.

Thus, this hypocrites love is like that of the whore-monger that pretends
great love to his neighbors wife; but, not for her husbands sake, or with his
privity; the true Christian is as the chaste Spouse, who loves her husband in,
and for God, that has set them into Covenant; the one loves God without
Christ, and so loves neither; the other loves God in Christ, and so performs
his duty to both.

This hypocrites love to God is grounded upon expectation.

He has ever respect to some future benefit: upon this account he is a
soothing fauning suitor, not unlike of the young men, who profess great love
to old widows, or deformed creatures, if very rich, in hope once to be
fingering of their bags. He loves with palpation, as feeling after what he has
in his eye; but not with palpitation of heart, as thirsting after God for
himself, or for mercies received. Benefits past are with him swallowed up, and
forgotten. He loves God, not for that he has, but for what he would have
further from God. While there is any hope of any good to be further gotten by
courting of God, this hypocrite will be a diligent waiter, an obsequious
Parasite Hos. 11.12
. But if he once find that God, for his secret wickedness and hypocrisy,
begins to hedge his way with thorns Hos. 2.6
; to cross him in his designs and hopes of gain, or deliverance out of those
briars he has by his sins cast himself into; then, he throws off all
attendance upon God, and discovers plainly for what he had all the former while
made love unto God; namely, not for miracles, or ought else past; but, in hope
of more loaves, whereof he had before eaten and been filled Joh. 6.26.
.

He can, with the Israelites Psalm 78.36.
, flatter God in extremity, and court him in hope of deliverance. In his
perplexity, he will with Pharaoh, confess the Lord is righteous Exodus 9.27.
, but not depart from his own unrighteousness, a great point of hypocrisy,
when a man makes use of love, or of the name of love to traffic and trade
with it for gaining of some commodity; which being obtained, the love is
presently cooled, or perhaps turned into hatred. For an unthankful man never
loves him to whom he is most beholden. There is indeed a proud thankfulness,
when men ashamed, professedly to brag, use thanks as an usher to their pride: I
thank God I am a better man than he, etc.

Contrariwise, the true Christians love is grounded upon experience. Differ.


This works in him both thankfulness for what is past, and assurance of
supply in time to come. He boasts not what, but acknowledges whence he
received, that it may appear God is a gracious giver, and himself an happy
beggar. He is (...), a lover of God, because, (...), beloved of God. He loves
much, because much is forgiven him. Quid retribuam? What shall I render to the
Lord for all his benefits? is his Motto. He is to be loved exceedingly, by whom
he is, lives, and is made wise. The loadstone of love is love. They easily love
more, who find themseves to be more beloved. He therefore carefully keeps a
faithful record of all the Lords mercies: among which special and spiritual
mercies have as it were a Dominical letter set upon them to bring them more
readily to mind. If he owe himself to God over and over for giving him his own
being; how much is he in debt for God himself! God gave me, says he, to my
self by Creation, he restored me to my self by redemption. I owe my self twice
over for my self: what shall I render to God for himself!

Thus, this hypocrites love is like the shadow of him that goes from the
Sun, it leads the way to the benefit aimed at, which being obtained, the
shadow still runs forward after more, and the man still following, leaves the
benefit received behind him, without returning to give thanks; the true
Christian is like the shadow upon the Dial that numbers the degrees of favors
received; the one loves for the bird in the bush; the other is glad and
thankful for any thing in hand, which he looks upon as an earnest of more.

This hypocrite loves God with a secondary love.

He cutteth out the Lord an hard pennyworth of love, such as he can afford
with respect to his profit, his pleasure. When his own turn is served, he will
think of God: But his turn is never served, that sets his heart on any thing
save the Lord; Other objects do but irritare amorem, provoke appetite, but
never satisfy desire, or warrant the lover from being miserable. These last
days abound with such miserable lovers, who having a form of godliness; are
yet lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God 2 Timothy 3.4
.

This hypocrite can borrow from Gods day, and from his service, for his own
affairs; but in no case from himself, to bestow upon the Lord. His own six
days will not serve the turn: but, as David must have Vrijahs one sheep, so
must he have Gods one day who has reserved no more unto himself. If a feast
(though not unlawful in due time and manner) or a pastime come in the way, so
that one must yield, either no Prayer, Sermon, or no pastime, God must be the
loser. He is not early and forward in holy exercises, but drives off, till the
time grow too short. So God has either no service, or to no purpose.

Delay is a degree of denial. To let an honorable friend stand knocking and
dancing attendance till we be at leisure, and all our own business done, were
great incivility. But men answer God so, as he forbids them to answer one
another. Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give thee Prove. 3.28
. It was the Churches fault that she opened not readily unto Christ Cant. 5.2, 3
, and she paid deer for it Ver. 5, 6, 7
. In the mean time this is the best of the hopocrites service; in whom
self-love drives into streights the love, not only of man, but of God. Where
in the first place, love and honor are due, it is a wrong to put Christ our
husband and Prince to take the second. To honor him with a secondary honor is
treason; as, to love him with a secondary love is adultery.

Differ.
Contrarily, The true Christian gives God every way the prime of his love.

True lovers are the only Larks, the only Nitingales; they are early and late,
day and night expressing love. David prevented the night watches Psalm. 119.148
. He thought on God by night, yea at midnight Verse 62
; With my soul have I desired thee in the night, and with my spirit within me
will I seek thee in the morning Esaias 26.9
. The morning prayers and meditations do sweeten and sanctify the day. Evening
prayer is a sweet close of the daylight, and happily of our life. Therefore a
Christian goes to his bed, as he would to his grave, and rises in the morning
with a taste of the resurrection. He seeks first the Kingdom of God and his
righteousness. If any love be too proud to come behind that love, he gives it
a bill of divorce. Tuas res tibi habe, take thine own, and be packing. Out of
doors with the bondwoman and her son; else were he not fit to follow Christ
as a Disciple, or a true lover, but must hear that sharp reproof uttered with
indignation, Get thee behind me Satan Mat. 16.23
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as a woman that promises marriage, but she must first
marry, and bury another husband; but the Christian contracteth with the Lord in
verbis de presenti, to be presently his, only his, and that for ever; the one
will follow Christ when he has first done his own business which he minds
more, and loves better; the other, as Peter and his fellows, forsake all to
follow Christ Mat. 19.27
, without indenting, or preferring ought before him, whom he loves more than
himself.

This hypocrites love is soon cooled.

Fond lovers are soon on, and soon off: their love is soon kindled, soon
quenched; like children, won with an apple, lost with a nut. So this hypocrite
loves God before he knows him, and flies in his face, or flies off, so soon as
he feels him in the least, contrary to expectation. Although he want nothing,
yet he is angry for any good another receives, for any love expressed to
another. He is a murmurer as the Israelites of old, upon every occasion is hard
to be pleased, but never seeks to please; he must have all the love, although
he show none; which argues not only a weak faith, but a wavering love. He is up
in arms, and at defiance with God every day for one trifle or another, for
bread, for water, for quails, which shows him to be but an humorous peevish
lover, whose love is too dearly bought, and more hardly kept. He is such a
lover, as will soon turn enemy, and blasphem the Lord to his face, if he want
his will, or fail of his carnal desires.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians love will take no check.

Many waters cannot quench his love, neither can the floods drown it; if a man
would give all the substance of his house for this love, it would utterly be
contemned Cant. 8.7.
. Lovers, the longer acquainted, the more loath to part, and the more desirous
to meet again. Their days of absence, and of want of full fruition, is a life
of longing and sighing. Sometimes they are joyful, sometimes sorrowful: now, a
breath; then a reconciliation, and thereby a re-inforcement of love. Then, the
love tokens walk; so it is with the Christian. His love to God may be disturbed
by tentation; but, it is not extinguished by infidelity, or put out of the
course of obedience by violence of passion or despair. For, seeing all things
work together for good to them that love God Romans 8.28.
, therefore a resolved Christian (as Job Job 1.21.
) is thankful even for afflictions.

He considers that the change which appears in Gods dealings toward him,
is occasioned not on Gods part, but on his own, whose heart is started aside
from God, and become out of frame. All is kindly taken by the truly loving
soul, because assured of the fidelity of God, and of the reality of his love.
He acknowledges the same love, though he find not the same effect. For when
the case differs on man's part, the course on Gods part, must needs vary, yet
without variation of his love. In health, food; yea, a feast: in sickness a
bitter potion, and purgation proceeds from the same love. Wherefore the true
Christian can cast himself upon the love of God, though God should think fit to
kill him outright Job. 13.15.
. As those that sailed with Paul, must needs keep the ship, as the only means
of safety; so a Christians safety, in the midst of the greatest storm, is to
continue in the love of Christ, which gives him footing, as it were, on dry
land, in the midst of the sea of this world.

Thus, this hypocrite is in and out with God, as God pleases to dispense
outward blessings or crosses to him, as thinking himself to deserve better;
the true Christians heart is fixed, and cleaves to him what ever befalls him,
acknowledging the worst that befalls him to be less then his desert; and the
least that is bestowed, to be beyond his merit: the one falls out with God,
for his skin, if but touched; the other had rather God should scourge him
with whips of Scorpions, while he loves him, then let him alone in his sins to
perish by them, rather then displease him.

This Hypocrite, even when he says he loves God, does not like

He is ever and anon apt to find fault with Gods dealing, as not sufficiently
requited for his love. Against providence he excepteth, that it is too partial;
that others have too much, and he too little. He excepteth against the Law, as
being too strict. What? says he, may I take no liberty on the Lords day? no
pleasure or satisfaction, by taking revenge? no thought for the flesh, to
gratify and satisfy some lust thereof Romans 13.14.
? Who can love truly, and yet abhor to be like him whom he loves? who can love
his Prince, and mislike his justice? who can love his image, that hates his
person? Nay, where there is dislike, upon unlikenesse, there can be no love.
Affection cannot subsist, and be constant without judgment; nor love, without
conformity.

Contrarily, the Christians love honors, Differ.
and justifies God in all things.

He loves advisedly, because he likes; and likes the more, because he loves
upon choice. Love is the palate of the soul to taste how sweet the Lord is.
Because he likes God, he cannot but love him; and loving him, he affects to
be like him, even to be transformed into the same image 2 Cor. 3.18.
. What he cannot attain unto, he misliketh not, but admireth. However the world
charge the Lord, he sees no unrighteousness Psalm. 92.15.
, no imperfection in him. He has none but honorable thoughts of God. If he
cannot presently assoile all objections or doubts, yet he pronounces God
righteous, and himself a beast. He subscribeth to providence, and is content
with whatsoever portion God sets out for him in outward things. His
conclusion is not, God loves me not, because he gives me no more: but this,
he gives me no more, because he loves me wisely, and for my good. He
approves whatsoever God speaks; yea, if God threaten him with sharp
judgments, good is the Word of the Lord Isa. 39.8.
. He likes well whatever the Law commands, or forbids. The Law, says he,
is holy, and the Commandment is holy, and just, and good Romans 7.12.
: but I am carnal, sold under sin ver. 14.
. He says not, the Law is too strict, but I am too loose.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a woman married to an husband, whom she never
loved, nor liked, nor can scarce aford him a good look, or good word; the true
Christian is so much taken with the love of Christ, that he will hold up his
honor against all gainsayers; the one is like a scoulding wife, that will
never be pleased: the other is like the virtuous woman that is a Crown to her
husband Prove. 12.4
, and whose works praise her in the gates Prove. 31.31
.

This hypocrites love is unactive and idle.

He loves God, but will do nothing for him. That he loves God, must be
supposed, or you wrong him: for he must be thought to love him, even when he
can not express it. It is in mine heart, says he; but, examine it not by my
actions. The greatest injury that can be done him, is to call in question his
love to God; because he is never able, (if you put him to it) to prove it by
any thing done for God. He is content to afford the Lord a parcel of good
words, my God we know thee Hos. 8.2.
; my Father, thou art the guide of my youth Jer. 3.4.
. But he casts off the thing that is good Hos. 8.3.
, and does evil more and more. He would have Gods love toward him to be
fruitful in blessings; but, his love to God is barren of obedience; God
-maysowe liberally, and reap nothing: but he would reap all, and sow nothing;
unless, to the flesh, of which he can in reason expect nothing, but to reap
corruption Gal. 6.8.
. He would drink in the dew of heaven, but never let truth bud out of the
earth. But such barren and unprofitable earth is nigh unto cursing, whose end
is to be burned Heb. 6.8.
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, The Christians love of God is diligent and operative.

The Apostle ascribes work, and labor unto love Heb. 6.10.
, because love refuses no pains. It will spend and be spent, even where there
is least love returned for most expended 2 Cor. 12.15.
. Much more will it lay it self out for God whose commandments are not grievous
1 John 5.3.
; nay, love is glad of any command, what will thou have me to do? says he unto
God, even before the command is gone forth Act. 9.6.
. Love is a diligent affection, and the fountain of diligence. We may well
derive diligentiam a diligendo, diligence from dilection or loving; the things
are conjugate no less then the names. A part of that diligence is in word and
profession. Love is no mute, but rather a Blab. It must tell the Lord how well
it loves him. I love thee, O Lord my strength, says David Psalm. 18.1.
. And again, I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice Ps. 116.1.
. But it stays not there; it proceeds to action. He is mindful of that of
his blessed Savior; If ye love me, keep my Commandments Joh. 14.15.
: and that, to Peter, love thou me? feed my sheep Joh. 21.16:
; as well knowing that love is the fulfilling of the Law Romans 13.10.
.

Nay, his love rests not in action, but cheerfully carries him on to
suffering. No pains, no hardship night or day, heat or cold will be thought
too much for him, whom his soul loves: no task seems hard. I account not
my life dear unto me Act. 20.24.
; says the Apostle. No condition is refused, that may bring him to the
presence and fruition of Christ his dear and loving Spouse, though it be by
death, yea by martyrdom. There is no one thing he desires more, or so much,
in this world; as that Christ may be magnified in his mortal body, whether it
be by life, or by death Phil. 1.20.
. Which he accounts so great a joy to him, that he calls upon others to rejoice
with him for it Cap. 2.17, 18
.

Thus, this hypocrite in his love to God, is like Ezekiels hearers, who with
their mouths showed much love Ezekiel. 33.31
, but in his actions, like the Sluggard, that hides his hand in his bosom, it
grieveth him to bring it again unto his mouth Prove. 26.15.
: the true Christian is like Jacob, that will serve seven, and seven years for
Rachel, rather then go without her Genesis 29.20, and ver. 30
, even when in the day the drought consumed him, and the frost by night, and
his sleep departed from his eyes Genesis 31.40.
: The one thinks to deal by God, as the Harlot, that with much fair speech
caused one of the simpletons to yield to her inticement, merely to fleece him,
and make him her prey Prove. 7, 21.
. the other, is like the virtuous woman in whom the heart of her husband may
safely trust, so that he shall have no need of spoil Prove. 30.11.
; for, she will do him good, and not evil all the days of her life ver. 12.
.

This hypocrite loves man, without God, and out of God.

We have seen what counterfeit wares this hypocrite serves God withal. It
cannot therefore well be expected that his love should be better to man, either
in the grounds, kinds, or exercise of it, which we shall now look into.

First, his grounds be rotten; the structure therefore cannot answer
expectation. He loves not in God; and indeed, how can he? In Deo diligere non
potest, qui Deum non diligit Bernard.
; he cannot love in God, that loves not God. This is the great Error of his
love, that he loves not with conscience of Gods commandment, or respect of his
Image, especially of the New man in him he loves. Love is not in him, the end
of the Commandment 1 Timothy 1.5.
, but love without it; not an evidence of his faith, but of his humor. Let God
commend to him the care of his neighbor, and it is no more regarded by him
than by Cain, who being demanded what he had done with his brother rudely and
saucily answered, am I my brothers keeper Genesis 4.9.
? He thinks it an unreasonable question, because he never loved his brother
upon any such account, as to be accountable to God, for his brother; or his
carriage toward him.

This hypocrite then may call that profession he makes to his brother, by the
name of love, if he please: but, very Heathens can tell him, that only virtue
on both sides is the bond of love, that all other combinations are but a
conspiracy, and all other professions of love, but hypocrisy. Indeed, Heathens
could not go so far as to say, love of God is the ground of virtue, as virtue
is the ground of love. They could not love a man, because God made him; much
less, because God has new made and redeemed him. But this hypocrite who
professes so much of the knowledge of God, and love unto him, cannot but be
taught so much of God as to love one another 1 These. 4.9.
; and that for his sake: and because this is not only the great Commandment of
the Law Mat. 22.38.
, but the special command of Christ; this is my Commandment that ye love one
another, as I have loved you Joh. 14.12.
. His love therefore is far from true and spiritual love: especially where
under color of love he draws another, man or woman, into sin. It is rather
a knot, then love, hatred, then good will: a rebellion against the Peace and
Crown of Christ, a brotherhood in evil, as between Simeon and Levi, a
combination in mischief against God, as that of Herod and Pilate against
Christ.

Sometimes Gods own are overtaken, to love whom they should not; at least, not
so far as they engage; as, Jehoshaphat a good man, and of a sweet
disposition, loved both Father and son, Ahab and Jehoram, too well, and too
far. So that he was charged with helping of the ungodly, and loving them that
hate the Lord 2 Chronicles. 19.2
. Yet this was not in hypocrisy, although without warrant from God. But the
hypocrite never loves, but he plays the hypocrite with man, as well as he
transgresses against God. Sometimes also love is begun for virtue, and then by
being transported with the person, men love the personage more then the virtue;
the Case in stead of the Jewel: and this, however the godly fall into it, yet
they do not dissemble in the reality of love, but only mistake in the Object.
This they do without God, and out of God, in regard of warrant; but not in
regard of the substance of their love.

But the hypocrite not only loves without God, but contrary unto God,
counterfeiting love, even when he places it not on a wrong Object, as
Ahitophel in pretending love to David; or, calling that love, which is but
lust, or a Pander to it, as that of Jonadab, David's brother, to Amnon his
Nephew; putting him into a way to satisfy his lust on his half-sister Tamar,
which Amnon thought hard for him to accomplish, till he was taught that wile 2 Samuel 13.2, etc.
. A trusty friend to his lustful Cousin; contrary to the Law of God and nature,
the dignity of the Prince, and the honor of his Niece.

Contrarily, a true Christian lover loves all, in God, and for God. Differ.


In God, not without him: for God, by virtue of his command: and to his honor.
His love is as that between Jonathan and David, the knot of friendship was the
oath of God 2 Samuel 21.7.
, as the ground of it was the fear of God, not to join in, or to be privy to
the conspiracy of Saul against innocent blood on the one hand; or, to the
corruption of nature in David against Jonathan, to support his own greatness,
or to revenge Saul's unworthy dealing with him, when he came to the Kingdom.
True love says St. Augustine, is motus animi ad fruendum Deo propter Ipsum;
se, and proximum, propter Deum. A motion of the soul to the enjoying of God for
himself; and himself and his neighbor, for Gods sake; by loving God, all
cleaves to one; by loving one another, all become one.

Wherefore as God is the Savior of all men, but especially of those that
believe. 1 Timothy 4.10.
. So a Christian loves all men, but especially those of the household of Faith
Gal. 6.10.
. He loves all, as made by God, in his image, capable of blessedness, and of
the same blood with himself Act. 17.26.
, with true natural love: but especially he loves those that are sanctified,
in whom there is yet another Image of God, the new creature; with true
Christian love; as Regeneration brings in a new consanguinity, which
Christian-love acknowledges: for, every one that loves him that begat, loves
him also that is begotten of him 1 John 5.1.
. And this he does as being a better Argument of true goodness, then his
believing. For, if the question be, whether a man be good, it is not demanded,
(says Augustine) what he believes, but what he loves.

It is true, that where there are more relations of kindred, neighborhood,
coheirship of grace, and the like; there love admits of multiplication and
increase: but this draws not the lover from God, or from his way of loving,
who is Author of those relations, and the rule of love. The Christian here has
a larger field for his love to walk in, but still his love is both grounded and
bounded in, upon, for, and by the God of love.

Thus, this hypocrite loves as the unjust Judge did justice to the Widow; not
out of fear of God, or regard to man Luke 18.4.5.
; the true Christian in loving man, has his eyes upon God, as the eyes of a
maid to the hand of her Mistress Ps. 32 2.2.
: the one loves, not truly, considering why, nor how: the other, is as careful
of the ground and end of loving as he is to love.

This hypocrite loves for his own sake.

His main care is to look to himself, and to advantage himself, or his lusts by
his loving of others. If nothing be likely to be returned, he will hardly
adventure any great matter out. He loves others as wicked men love some that
are godly; not for their virtue or goodness, but for the good they receive by
them; as Laban loved Jacob Genesis 30.27.
, as Potipher Genesis 39.3, 4.
, and Pharaoh loved Joseph Cap. 41.40.
; as Belshazzar Dan. 5.29.
, did Daniel. Or, he loves them as children love their parents for
maintenance, or parents their children, for their neerenesse to them, being a
part of themselves, for their wit, feature, or serviceablenesse, little caring
to plant virtue or knowledge in them to make them amiable in the eyes of God
and man. Sometimes, he loves others that are like him in age, in condition, or
perhaps in vice, as one drunkard or idle person loves another: but, never for
his sake, whom he pretends to love.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian-lover respects himself least, and in the last
place.

The Object of his love is not himself, but his brother: and that is not for
what he will do for him, but what he is in himself. The lodestone of love is
virtue and goodness in the Object. This draws out his affection; not, to
serve himself, but his brother through love Gal. 5.13.
. He principally loves for Gods sake, in whom he loves him: and next for his
sake whom he loves, as intending his good more then his own, in loving of him.

He observes that precept, to love his neighbor as himself. He knows what
is good for himself; and thence concludes, if health, credit, justice, mercy,
knowledge, holiness be good for me, then are they good for him also, and he
will do what he can to procure them. For, he makes conscience of his Masters
Rule, whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them
Mat. 7.12.
.

It is not denied, but a man in loving another, may have some respect to
himself; if he be learned, wise, judicious, to learn of him; if humble, loving,
gracious to imitate him: if any way profitable, to be a gainer by him, in a way
of God, not of lust, or of the world. But this is not the maine, nor the first
thing for which the Christian loves another, but as the result, not as the
moving cause, but as the reward of love; as man and wife, by showing more love
to one another for loves sake, do reap more love from each other. No man can
love God with the purest and most abstracted love that is most refined from all
self-love and mercenary baseness, but he has some aim at the chiefest
happiness, in loving of the greatest good: not making a man's own happiness
the first ground, but the last motive to love him best, whom we love most for
himself. So, in proportion, a Christian loves his Christian friend; not most,
or, in the first place, for himself.

Thus, this hypocrite loves his brother as Hamor and Shechem taught the
Shechemites to love Jacob and his family ( shall not their Cattle, and their
substance, and every beast of theirs be ours? Genesis 34.23.
) the true Christian loves his neighbor, as Abraham loved the King of Sodom
and his people, when for his Nephew Lots sake, he rescued the prey from the
Kings that had swept all away, not taking so much as a thread or shooelatchet
to himself Genesis 14.23.
, of ought that was theirs: the love of the one begins and ends in
himself; the love of the other begins in God, extends to his brother; and
ends in the mutual comfort and rejoicing of both: not so much for the good
received, as bestowed.

This hypocrite loves not out of judgment, or discerning of worth.

He loves not out of choice, but chance; not as discerning the worth of the
party Jacob and Esau Romans 11.13.
, he will make none. He is as one of those sons of God that seeing the
daughters of men to be fair, took them wives of all they liked best for their
beauty, without respect to their goodness Genesis 6.2^
. He considers not who is best deserving, but most pleasing; and usually they
please him best that do least please God. For indeed an hypocrite can take no
great delight in an exact Christian, whose true piety and fire of zeal will too
much discover and eclipse his hypocrisy and painted fire.

On the Contrary, Differ.
the true Christian loves out of sound judgment and deliberate choice.

He loves, because he discerns worth in the party. And although, he will
carry himself lovingly to all, yet he will be very wary and circumspect in the
choice of a friend. David behaved himself wisely, and so got the love and
praise of all in Saul's Court. But he chose none but Jonathan to be his beloved
friend and companion. And he that was so loving to all his people, that he
accounted them his brethren and companions Ps. 122.8.
, yet he hated the congregation of evildoers, and would not sit with the
wicked Ps. 26.5.
. Yea, he would not sit with vain persons (such as are all carnal men) nor go
in with dissemblers ver. 4.
, such as this hypocrite: He professes himself a companion of all that fear
God and keep his precepts Ps. 119.63.
. And therefore prays unto God, Let those that fear thee turn in unto me, and
those that have known thy testimonies ver. 79.
. Therefore his goodness is extended to the Saints; in them is all his
delight, and that because they are the excellent Ps. 16.3.
.

Where there is liberty of Election, at least in loving, a Christian labors
to make his child, ally, friend, such as may be lovely and acceptable. True
love ever finds worth, or makes it. Or rather, the natural love prepares
the beloved for that love which he bears to virtue. To love a man first, and
then to endeavor to make him honorable, is a proceeding from nature to
virtue. Nature of her self honors a man, because she loves him: but virtue
either loves, or desires to love, because she honors him for the worth she
finds in him: love growing from honor being a better Argument of worth; then
honor from love.

Thus, this hypocrite sets on the roof, and then thinks of laying the
foundation; or rather, cares not much whether there be any foundation at all:
the true Christian makes sure of the foundation first, and then builds
thereupon: The one puts on love as a false Spectacle, and thereby every
thing seems fairer and greater than it is in his beloved: the other,
endeavors to see without Spectacles, the true shape and worth of the party
that he would love, before he let out his affection.

This hypocrites love is mental and kept secret.

Men use sometimes, speaking jestingly, to say, you shall never know what I
will do for you. Such is the love of this hypocrite. He shows little love in
the fruits, even while he professes much; and, to maintain his profession of
love, tells you, you little think what he intends to do for you; that, by such
hints, that do you no good, nor him hurt; he may hold up your expectation; and
his own reputation. He means to do nothing, but he would not have you to know
so. He will make you to believe he means well; but, forbeares to speak it out,
that you may not grow too bold upon him for his promise: This is the
construction he would have you to make of his present silence, and
close-handednesse. If you make other, he quarrelleth.

Open rebuke, says Solomon, is better then secret love Prove. 27.5.
. Open rebuke ministers occasion and means of bettering, at least of the
exercise of patience where the rebuke is not deserved, or the manner uncomely:
But secret love that is no way manifested, no man was ever the better for. Such
an hypocrite (to stop your mouth from pressing him to show more love) will tell
you, wise men must not be too fond, but love with discretion. But, too much
discretion rebates the edge of affection, whereas, in love, if the Object be
right and warrantable, God allows a little wandering Prove. 5.19.
; especially in the husband to the wife, who is bidden to err (...)
always in her love. Here, better err on the right hand, then on the left.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the true Christians love is discernable, and manifest.

His love is a laboring love Heb. 6.10.
, a love that is very near of kin to that wisdom which is from above, that
is, full of mercy and good fruits Jam. 3.17.
. He loves the mean, but yet in love, he is more afraid of the defect, than of
the excess. He is afraid if he should be too precise in paying but just so
much love, as is in exactness due, he should give under measure, therefore he
chooses rather to give good measure, pressed down and shaken together, and
running over Luke 6.38.
. He so loves, that he measures love by it self, and reduces it to the first
love, and highest measure, that he can bring it unto. He is careful to add not
only reality to profession, but plenty of love to the sincerity of it.

He propounds to himself no lower pattern then Christ himself, who has
commanded him to love others, as Christ has loved him Joh. 14.22.
. Now he knows that Christ's love neither would, nor could be concealed, nor
stinted with the bounds and limits of the highest love among men Joh. 15.13.
Romans 5.8.
. Not that he will starve himself to feed others, (for charity begins at home)
but he will reduce himself to the lowest scantling, rather then suffer any
member of Christ to famish. He will in no office of love within his power come
short, but even beyond his power he is willing to show his love 2 Cor. 8.3.
.

Thus, this hypocrite loves to play with love, but not to love: the true
Christian puts on charity Col. 3.14.
, as a garment, and as that which he accounts not his burden, but his
perfection: the one, puts love under lock and key, like holy day clothes, that
are more worn out in the chest, then on the back; the others love is unto him,
what the curse is to a wicked man; as the garment which covers him, and for a
girdle wherewith he is girded continually Ps. 109.19.
.

This Hypocrites love is Verbal; rather in wishing, then supplying.

He has words at will; Oil and Butter enough in his mouth to supply all: but,
he keeps all to himself: he will spare none of it to his neighbor, whatever
his need be; or at least so little, as will do him little good; too little to
supply his necessities. He gives as good words as need to be: Depart in peace,
be warmed, and filled: but gives him not those things that are needful Jam.
2.16.
. He may freeze for cold, and starve for hunger for all this parcel of good
words. Thus he deals with his brother, as many that will say to a younger
brother of a good family, I would you had been the heir, or, as some others, I
would you had such a living, such a seat, etc. for which he gets, I thank you,
Sir, for nothing.

He that bewailes another man's misery, and puts not to his helping hand, is,
says Saint Augustine, like a Spectator in a Tragedy, that mournes much to see
some sad story acted, but lets the Play go on: Whereas if true pity were seated
in his heart, it would express it self as well by the hand, as by the eye, or
tongue.

Contrarily, the true Christians love is helpful. Differ.


Otherwise, it is not real. According to his power his heart joins with his
tongue and his hand with his heart. His wishes are not idle or handlesse: he is
as ready to do good, as to wish well. If he cannot do all he would, yet he will
do what he can: and where he can do no more, he will turn wishes into prayers;
and from prayer conclude for those that are godly: My God shall supply all your
need, according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus Phil. 4.19.
. If I cannot help you my self, yet I will move my friend, even the Lord Jesus
Christ, who is able to do this and more both for me and you. One way or other,
his love will help: at least will show a willing mind to do, as well as to
talk. And this makes a man accepted, even of God himself; according to what he
has, and not according to that he has not 2 Cor. 8.12.
. God rejects him not for what he has not, but accepts him for that he has.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a man of clouts, that may skare birds, but not
relieve men: the true Christian is like one of David's Worthies, that though he
cannot reach the first three, yet he will do his part, as Benaiah and others 2 Samuel 23.23.
to be of the thirty: the one, has tongue at will, but no hand; the others
hand is longer, at least busier, then his tongue.

This hypocrites love is in promise, not in performance.

He is as Antigonus (by a sarcasme, nicknamed (...),) always about to give,
but never gives. He has perfectly learned the merchandise of words and
traffic of promise: but breaks, when it comes to performance. He gives
nothing at present, when not only your necessity, but relation may expect
present supply; but to salve the matter, he tells you seriously, I will put you
in my will: perhaps, as he did whose legacy to his friend, was an halter to
hang him. He boasts of a false gift, and therefore is no better then clouds
and wind without rain Prove. 25.14.
.

It is he that has helped the world to that proverbial speech; Ampullae
verborum, which if it import not a bubble in the water, yet surely comprehends
no more but a pot with an empty belly, an Apothecaries box, fair written on
the outside giving you notice of some rare drug or liquor contained in it, but
has nothing within answerable to the gaudy title. It is like Absoloms
low-belling of the people that had no more wisdom than to hearken to him. O
that I were a Judge in the land, that every man that has any suit or cause,
might come unto me, and I would do him justice 2 Samuel 15.4
: but he meant nothing less; So, fair words make fools fond.

On the Contrary, the Christians performance overtakes his promise, Differ.
if not goes beyond it.

His word is his bond, yea his oath: therefore he will perform, although to
his own hinderance, or hurt Ps. 15.4.
. An oath with him is sacred, so is his promise, although not so bound. For, he
makes not a promise without God, as his witness, as well as his warrant. And
he will not forfeit himself to such a witness who must be also his Judge. God
ties him where man cannot bind him. Therefore he is careful, if it may be, to
prevent his word, by doing the deed sooner then he promised, (as lightnings
appears before the thunder be heard:) partly lest the benefit should lose of
'its grace by coming loyteringly after the promise, and be sued out as a debt,
rather then accepted as a gift, and partly lest himself, being a man, should
after be tempted to alter his own word, or prove (if not false, or unkind, yet)
unable to perform.

With him, it is an undoubted and indelible maxim, better give and not
promise, than promise and not give. Yet in cases of extremity, where
expectation it self may be some stay and comfort, he refuses not the bond of
promise. But then, he enters into another bond to his own heart, not to fail
in that promise, whatever detriment happen to himself by performance. He is
willing to help every way: by actual giving where he has it in his hand, and
present necessity presses; or, by a faithful promise to give so soon as he
has it, and the other needs it.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul, who thought he might take liberty to break
Articles and engagements with the Gibeonites 2 Samuel 21.1.
, who had abused Joshua many hundred years before: the true Christian is as
Joshuah, that having once engaged will not be worse than his word, even to
dissembling and cheating Gibeonites Josh. 9.18.
. The one has his excuse, that the parties to whom the promise was made are
unworthy, yet for breach is plagued: the other, looks more to his duty than to
the others unworthiness, and therefore performs, for which he receives a
blessing from God.

This hypocrites love consists in counselling, not in ayding.

If, by Gods hand, a man be cast into great straits, not by any wilful
negligence, profuseness or building Castles in the air; but, it may be to try,
and humble him, and to drive him closer up to God; and he, in such a case, make
his moan to this hypocrite, who is able to help him: the hypocrite will give
him good counsel, because counsel is cheap. Agree Sir, with your Creditors, pay
every man his own, buy what ye lack. Thus he will afford him counsel, but not a
penny to help him. He is (as too many else are) ready to look angerly and
frowningly upon a man upon whom God has frowned, and tells him, this you
should do, when he sees that he cannot do it: this you should have done, when
now it is too late to do it, but helps him not in the least. For he could have
and perhaps has, told himself as much as this, without going to this
hypocrite. He came to him for advice that is practicable, that might do him
good, whereas all his counsel, is only to upbraid and vex him in his greatest
grief and necessity. To whom the poor man might reply as he in the Epigram,
quod peto, da cui; non peto consilium: give me what I come for, or keep your
counsel to your self.

Yea, there are not none of these hypocrites, who finding a friend, in
necessity, instead of counsel for the good of his friend, counsels (...),
for himself Eccles. 3.7.
, making use of his necessities, infirmities, passions, for ends of his own.
Are you in want, sell such or such an house or Land, I will give you money for
it: when perhaps he has by usury hastened and increased his wants, not without
purpose to work upon his necessities when he has him fast in his net; for then
he resolves to have his land (at his own price,) or his bones. If he see him
engaged in lawsuits, he claps him on the back, and upon good security lends
him money to wage law, that he may at once gain by the others loss, and be
revenged by the hand and at the cost of his friend, upon one that is more his
enemy than his friend: or, he helps him, to engage with him in some faction,
or for other ends of his own; saying, as his friend says, or rather adding to
it. Do thou tell him thou art angry, with such an one? he bids thee hang him,
and shows thee perhaps a way to do it. Do thou covet such a man's house, or
field? he bids thee never give over till either by foul means or fair, he be
forced to sell it to thee. Art thou afraid of some mischief? he bids thee fly,
and leave what thou have with him. Do thou suspect such an one that
pretends friendship, to be false to thee? he bids the believe it, and trust
him no longer. Thus thou shall never want counsel to do thee mischief: nor
find aid, that may do thee good.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian counsels from the heart, and to the heart.

He will give counsel that is practicable, and profitable to his friend.
Counsel that is sweet, like ointment or perfume that cheereth his heart. Hearty
counsel, or counsel of the soul, proceeding not from a crafty head to
overreach or deceive, but from a faithful heart that studies his good, ready
no less to aid, then to advise: nor less willing to put to his hand than his
tongue. He disdaines to be of those counselors, that knowing before hand what
use thou have of him, will seem to counsel thee, but counsels for himself;
and, instead of helping thee, cast the lot upon thee Eccles. 37.8
; he encourages thee in thy way which thou propoundest to him; telling thee,
thy way is good; and afterward stands on the other side, to see what will
befall thee verse 9
.

Nay, he will rather dissuade thee, then encourage, if he doubt any danger; as
he that said to his friend that would needs have his approbation in a way that
was not good, thou can not have me a friend and a flatterer. If he see thee
to mistake thy way, and to ask advice of those that will abuse, not help thee:
he will give thee fair warning what Counselors to avoid, and bid thee, not
to consult one that suspecteth thee, but to hide thy counsel from him that
envieth thee verse 10
; even as no wise man would consult with a woman touching her whom she is
jealous of, nor with a coward in matters of war, nor with a Merchant
concerning exchange, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of
thankfulness, nor with the slothful of work, nor with an hireling for a year,
of finishing work sooner; nor with an idle servant of much business verse 11
. But he will advise thee to be continually with a godly man, that thou know
to keep the Commandments of the Lord, whose mind is according to thy heart,
and will sorrow with thee, if thou shall miscarry verse 12
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Rehoboams young Counselors, 1 King. 12.10
that counseled so as that they might dominere over those whom he should
oppress; the true Christian is like that Kings old Counselors, that
counseled for his good, not their own ends verse 6, 7
. The one is as the Pope that gives way to incestuous marriages, in show to
gratify a Prince that desires it; but, in truth to oblige and enslave that
family to himself for justifying their incestuous brood: the other will give
way to nothing that may in the least wrong his friend. He will be a co-worker
with him, not a competitor, much less a conspirator: he will partake with him
in suffering evil, but not in doing any.

This hypocrites love consists in praising, not in profiting.

Sometimes he prevents a suit that he espies to be making to him, by commending
somewhat in the suitor, and confidently avowing that he has great plenty of
it, that so he may stop his mouth, or answer his suit, by telling him he has
more of that already, then he to whom he makes the suit has for himself: as
many a man coming to borrow money is sent away with a confident assertion that
he is very rich, and has no need. This hypocrite by his mouth one way or other
destroys his neighbor Prove. 11.9
; nothing more current coin than flattery, which yet all know to be
counterfeit.

He blesses his friend with a loud verse, which is no better then a curse unto
him Prove. 27.14
. For he that flattereth his neighbor, spreads a net for his feet, he makes
him a sure prey. If his feet be entangled, he is fast enough for running away.
He is very courteous in his complements; but the kisses of an enemy (and such
is every hypocrite) are deceitful, giving opportunity to this Serpent to infuse
his poison more surely, Prove. 29.5
and with less notice. He means no good faith in them, no more then Judas
when he kissed his Master. He heals with sweet words that wound which should be
searched with reproofs; claps on a healing plaster upon a festered sore. He
will praise in evil as well as in that which is good; as Ahabs Prophets
flattered their Master to his destruction 1 King. 20
. Thus the Princes of Judah, after the death of Jehoiada, did great obeisance
to Joash, merely to flatter him into idolatry 2 Chr. 24.17, 18
; as the Princes of Israel made their Kings glad with their lies Hos. 7.3
; and as Herod flattered the people by the slaughter of James, and the
persecution of Peter Acts 12.2, 3
, for which they gratified him with a flattery again, by an acclamation not
short of blasphemy, which cost him his life verse 22, 23
.

Yea, this hypocrite will not only flatter with his lips; but, in imitation
too, imitating the defects of great men, as if they were rather commendable,
then blemishes; as they who imitated Alexander in wrying of the neck, when none
but Pirrhus will follow him in his valor and prowess. And by his good will he
will have none shall escape his flattery, unless in such things wherein his
flattery cannot prevail. This makes many proud and unuseful, that otherwise
might by diligence have deserved true praise; as Carneades observed in the
sons of Princes, who could indeed learn noth^ng deserving honor, but
horsemanship; for, in all other things their teachers would flatter them, by
commending without cause; and so keeping them from laboring after the truth of
those excellencies for which they falsely praised them; but the horse will be
sure to show them no favor, if they sit not fast; and therefore there they
must learn and excel, or hazard their necks.

Differ.
On the contrary, The true Christian friend will rather wound, then not heal.

He is no sound friend that always praises, no more then he can be a sweet
friend, who always reproves. Therefore the Christian duly considers the
state and necessity of his friend. If he deserve praise, he shall have it, not
with a loud voice, rising early in the morning Prove. 27.14
; but modestly, sparingly, and rather any where then to his face; teaching him
by his praising him to love, more to deserve then to hear commendations; that
his commendations may be the debt of his worth that is praised, not the froth
of a false heart, to make his friend vain or mad that was foolish enough
before, and too apt to entertain flatterers, as false-witnesses of his
self-conceited worth; yea, teaching others, how to flatter and come within him.

He is so wise as to remember that his friend consists of an old man, and a
new man; and so joyneth himself to him to counsel, encourage, and aid that part
which is reasonable, or rather regenerate, helping him to see and amend his
errors, loving not so much the ease, as the credit; nor the credit, as the
conscience of his friend. If gentler reproofs will do it, he tries their
strength first, gently telling him, you were too blame, too much transported
with passion, intemperance with the world, etc. Reduce your self to your
grounds, set limits and bounds to your appetite, your passions, etc.

If this will not do, he then wounds that he may cure; because he knows
that faithful are the wounds of a friend Prove. 27.6
; yea, that open rebuke is better then secret love Ver. 5
. He wounds, but, as a Surgeon, not as an enemy. It is no other wound then
his friend, if he be so wise as he should be, will rather desire than decline.
His lay is, let the righteous smite me Psalm 141.5
. Therefore the Christian never fears such breaking of his friends head, but
goes on with his love and his work. One while he imbraceth, another while he
draws blood: And as a loving Physician, one while he entertaines his friend
with a feast, and at another time presents him with bitter pills, or a strong
potion.

Thus, this hypocrite is as he that praises his friend with a loud voice, and
brings on him a curse: the true Christian is as a wise Physician that
considers his patients needs, and gives him not that which may please, but
that which may profit him: the one like the horse-leech, sticks close to his
friend; but it is to fill himself with the blood of his friend; the other is
as the Pellicane that is content to let himself blood to feed his friend.

This hypocrites love is complement, courtesies, affected phrases, nothing but
words and gestic^lations.

He turns love into a complement mercy into a Ceremony. If you come to his
table, perhaps furnished with dainty dishes, although he be a very churl: yet
at his table, he makes great protestations of hearty welcome, and bids you eat
and drink, but his heart is not with you Prove. 23.7
. Rather as Nabal he is ready to die to think of his cost. If he meet you in
the way, where you stick fast in the mire, or are able to go no further, either
he wishes you some of his help at home, or, tells you of some body at hand
coming after him that will help you, but never puts finger of his own to the
work. He is your servant, and at your command, he kisseth your hand, or the hem
of your garment, but with the kiss of a Joab, or a Judas. If words and
complements will do, he will soon show himself better bred than Nabal, yet not
better affected than Laban who is all one with Nabal, in name spelled backward,
and in his heart, spelled by his actions Genesis 31 41
.

If he meet any man in the street or market, you would take him to be a Damon
met with Pythias, ready to creep into the others bosom, or to lie at his feet;
but, no sooner is his back turned, but he is ready to look over the shoulder in
derision, and to traduce him to the next he meets, and perhaps to boast how
exquisitely he complemented and dissembled with him. And so he is not content
only to carry two faces under one hood; but he will pull off the mask and show
them to any that will be troubled to take a view of them.

On the contrary, the true Christian is little in circumstances, Differ.
but strives to abound in the substance of love.

David and Jonathan contended together in weeping 1 Samuel 20.41
, not in crying your servant, Sir, in discovery of treacheries, not in
ceremonies, in real friendship, not in empty words. It is not denied but some
ceremonies, that is outward expressions in the very gestures and countenances
of friends will thrust in with true love: not so much for the loves sake, as
for respect the witness and acknowledgement of desert which is the ground,
nurse, and guardian of love; therefore love makes no difference between
affected complements, and downright rudeness, but shunneth both alike, that
it may neither waste complements, nor neglect that respect which civility,
modesty, and Religion require as a part of the debt of love. But to be a Master
of the art of Ceremonies, and to assert such a necessity of them as to exceed
in their use, as it savours not of a simple, sincere, ingenuous spirit, so it
sets the teeth of true love on edge. The Christians maine care is to love, not
in word, or in tongue, but in deed, and in truth 1 John 3.18
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Hushai to Absalom (whom he meant to supplant) when
he cried, God save the King, God save the King 2 Samuel 16.16
; not naming what King, yet, would be understood as speaking of Absalom ver.
18, 19.
; the true Christian is as Jonathan to David, as faithful in his absence as in
his presence; the one by complements, justles out love, the other by some
respects showed, maintains the substance of love.

This hypocrite, if he really do a work of Charity, it is for pomp and
ostentation.

We have hitherto traced him in his verbal charity, wherein he gives only words
instead of Works. But he, knowing he must needs give more than a sound of
words; else, he should be judged of all to be but as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal 1 Cor. 13.1
; He will therefore do somewhat more; he will add deeds to his words; but such
as argue him no less hypocrite then before. And his deeds are of two sorts;
the one respecting the poor, so far below him as to need his alms; the
other, of an higher rank, to whom he professes friendship; but, in both, an
hypocrite, the Ape of Gods children, no child of God.

In his alms, he many ways discovers himself: but, in nothing more grossly,
then in the manner of doing them. If he does it not with sound of trumpet, he
does it as ill, with beat of drum. He will do it in the Sinagogues, where the
Assemblies are fullest; or, at least in the streets where most meet, that he
may have glory of men Mat. 6.2.
. He will draw spectatours, or not draw his purse. He will give only at his
doors, for that requires the least care, and makes the most noise, though that
which is given be given at a venture, as the Roman Sportala, to all comers and
clients. He can do nothing without store of witnesses; for, otherwise he doubts
his conscience will scarce witness it for him another day; and, God may forget
it, unless to punish his hypocrisy in it.

Contrariwise, The true Christian is best pleased with secrecy in his alms.
Differ.


He will especially in giving private alms to particular men, take care so
near as he can, that his left hand shall not know what his right hand does
Mat. 6.3
; his left hand of ostentation shall not be privy to what he does with the
right hand of commiseration; as knowing that his secrecy in duty will be so
far from being an obstruction to his reward, that the more secret his alms,
the more public shall be Gods remuneration. His Father which sees in secret,
will reward him openly. He that turns his eyes from the hypocrite giving
private alms in public, fixes them upon the Christians secret alms, that he
may publicly declare the great difference he puts between them.

Secrecy in private alms, is a great sign of sincerity; as the calling in of
witnesses is an argument that a man dares not trust God without them.
Therefore, pure Religion visits the fatherless and widow in their affliction
Jam. 1.27
; to see how it is with them at home before they come abroad to complain; or,
having been abroad, remain unrelieved. This, it is better at a dead lift when
none eye pitieth, no hand relieveth, because then the gift is double welcome,
and the giver less tempted to vanity and pride. The true Christian considers
the poor Psalm 41.1
; that is, wisely casts about where is most need and desert, and there he
lays out most, where least can be expected from man by way of reward, because
he looks for none, but from God himself; not doing it to merit, but to perform
a duty; to be a gainer, not to his purse, but to his peace.

He is not against public alms in a public way; he disliketh not, but
forwardeth, by his hand and tongue, necessary collections in the Assemblies.
How else should the Churches light shine before men Mat. 5.16.
? such alms were enjoined in all the Churches 1 Cor. 1^.1
. Alms must not so shun the light, as to be ashamed to be seen, but
sometimes show themselves that men may see charity is not barren, but fruitful
with a witness. Not doing them, to make other men's observing them the chief
motive or end of giving them. Wherever the poor brethren are in want, they
are to be relieved when occasion and opportunity call for it. If it be moved in
public, although but for a private person, even in public, charity may and
must be publicly expressed as a part of the obedience of faith 2 Cor. 8.7
. Not to do an alms, unless it may be seen to account it lost, if it be not
seen; or, not to do any alms at all but what is publicly seen, he leaves to
the hypocrite. The true Christian has in some alms many witnesses, for the
glory of God, and for the incitements of others to more liberality; yet, in
some, only the receiver, without any other, in some, only God, not the
receiver, knows the benefactor.

Thus, this hypocrite manageth his alms, as Jehu did his zeal: Jehu cared not
for God, but for the Kingdom; he pulled down Ahab and his family, not to exalt
God but to make way for himself to the Throne: zeal was the pretension, the
Crown was the meaning; the good of the poor is pretended in the alms, but his
own glory who is the Almner is intended: The true Christian is as Joseph's
Steward that so secretly conveyed his brethrens money into their sacks, that
they could not tell how it came there. We cannot tell, say they, who put our
money into our sacks Genesis 43.22
. The one will give nothing but in public; the other gives in public when
called upon, yet so as not to hold his hand in secret.

This hypocrites charity is unjust.

One virtue is enough for him at one time. If he be just, he thinks he may well
be excused from giving alms. If he must give alms, he must be excused from
justice, not as confessing injustice, but as pleading a warrant of his rigor
for the enabling of him to give alms. He pulls from him upon pretense of debt,
when he should rather feed and cloth him. If asked why? He says, I take but
mine own, and so I hope I do no man wrong. Let me first be paid what is owing,
and then I can think of charity afterward. Extremity of justice is the
extremity of injury, and that is no other, to exact the utmost where nothing is
to be had, but with the utter ruin and starving of those, that if we feed not,
must starve, although we take nothing from them. Charity seeks not her own in
such cases 1 Cor. 13.5
. It is therefore uncharitable justice, which is injustice to ruin a man upon
an account of justice, that we may after exercise our charity toward him.

He that took his fellow by the throat, saying, pay me that thou owe Mat.
18.28
, never used such a word as, pay that thou owe not; yet for that which he
both did and said, His Lord condemned him as a wicked servant Ver. 32
, for not showing the same pity to his fellow servants in forgiving him, as his
Lord had showed to him. Rules of justice may be strained so high as to turn
judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock Amos 6.12
, this is no good foundation to build charity upon, first to destroy a man with
a show of justice, and then to relieve him with a show of charity; the justice
is uncharitable, and the charity is no charity.

It may be he relieveth some, which deserve punishment before relief, and this
is a wrong to others; as, to give to rogues and vagrants, without punishing
them first as malefactors, this is lawless charity, being a contempt of the
Laws, and an injury to others who better deserving his charity are hereby
beguiled of it. To relieve a malefactor in his place, that is the prison, where
he is sub lege, under the punishment of the Law; or when he is in some
extremity and danger of life, humanity teaches first to relieve, and then to
enquire; but else, first enquire, and punish; then, relieve, is the rule of
true charity as well as justice; to do otherwise is hatred under the mask of
love Lev. 19.17


Or, this hypocrite seems a very charitable man to some to whom he owes less,
while he is uncharitable and unjust to them to whom he owes more. He cares not
what he gives to, or wastes upon strangers, while his own friends, kindred,
children, the wife of his bosom are neglected, and such as have deserved far
better of him, are not requited; pity it is, that charity should come under the
lash, yet this man with his false charity, causes true charity to hear ill,
because his pretended charity is so far from doing well.

Or, perhaps he has another humor, which is not to make an heir, but to
settle a perpetuity in some corporation that will find some way to lick their
own fingers, or to pervert it; yet this pleases him (although he might easily
have foreseen the abuse) and this he will do, that his charity may bear his
name like an Absaloms Pillar, and all other offices of kindnesses and
retribution, and doing good to others who more need it, and may better
challenge it, are swallowed up and buried under that one Pillar. Thus that he
may make a noise in the world, and seem to go beyond other Christians, he falls
short of very Infidels 1 Timothy 5.8
. Dat, ne reddat; to do what he is not bound to, he omitteth that to which he
is bound; and, to be at liberty in giving, he casts off the duty of paying,
like some who give largely to a Lecturer, but deceive their Pastor. This is
not charity, but humor and vainglory; yea, injustice.

On the contrary, the true Christians charity succeeds justice. Differ.


Charity is just as well as kind; orderly as well as compassionate. It is no
time with him to do works of charity, till debts and duty be discharged. As our
Law orders first, debts to be paid, then legacies; so charity it self
orders him, so to be charitable, as none shall have just cause to complain
of his wilful omission of any other necessary duty; or, of Gods order in the
performance. Not that a man should give no alms at all, while he owes any
money to others: for then, many men should seldom find times wherein to give;
but that no man should be so large, or profuse, as to disable himself to pay
his just debts, and to provide for those of his family; or to give away any
considerable sums whereby any creditour should be unpaid at the time of
payment, unless with his consent. For he that so does, does not give his own,
but another man's, which is not charity, but robbery.

He will therefore take pattern, not of Ahitophel, who set his house in order,
(of whom we read nothing of paying any debts;) but, of Zacheus who first
divided his goods, that he might make restitution with overplus, and then gave
to the poor Luke 19.8
. It is the undoubted Character of a truly charitable Christian to begin with
justice in paying debts, that is, all duties to which he is bound, before he
proceed to voluntary enlargements of his charity, where he is free; and, to do
duties freely, and fully, betokens love and care of humane society, to which
all particular and more private acts of an arbitrary charity must give place.

Thus, this hypocrite deals by justice and charity, as Paul in a different
case, by the Pharisees and Sadduces Acts 23.6
, setting them together by the ears, that he might sooner be quit of both; the
true Christian, is as Hezekiah that not only gave order for the Passover to be
kept, but appointed the courses of the Priests and Levites, every man according
to his course and service 2 Chronicles. 31.2
. His charity directs his bounty, as well as it puts him on to be bountiful.
The one begins where he should end, not unlike the self-justifying Pharisee in
being very busy about tything of mint, rue and cummin, but neglecting the
weightier matters of the Law which were first to be done; the other as the
spider in weaving of her web, begins at her bowels, so he begins at the center
of duty, and after extends himself to the circumference of charity.

This hypocrites charity is superfluity.

He is like those that out of their abundance or superfluity cast much into the
treasury, yet were outdone by the poor widow that cast in but two mites Mat.
2 43, 44
. He does it not for use, but for ostentation; to show his magnificence rather
then his charity, or wisdom: a charity, to walls and buildings, rather then to
men; a charity, rather to the bellies and lusts of those who inhabit them, then
to the souls of those who erect them. The charity of superstitious persons and
times, wherein not for want of ignorance, they were at charge to beggar their
own families, to enrich those who made merchandise of their souls, and then
persuaded them to buy them again at very dear rates, and even therein merely
cheated them too. A mad charity, that striveth to exceed the pomp of Princes in
their Palaces (if his purse can reach it) in erecting Hospitals to lodge
beggars; and, Monasteries, to be sties for God-bellie beasts: nay, which is
worse, to endow them with revenues like Dukes and Princes, who pretend the
devoting themselves to voluntary poverty; yea, which is worse, a charity (piety
they call it) to images of stocks and stones, to maintain their Lady in the
fashion, and a new gown against every good time, after the example of the old
Israelites, who out-vied one another in giving their earrings of gold, to make
a calf Exodus 32.3
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian maintains good works for necessary uses.

His heart is large, but his hand is better guided then the hand of the
hypocrite. He observes the Apostles rule Tit. 3.14
, not the practices of vainglorious men, whose charity oft-times occasions the
carrying of many more to hell than to heaven. His charity is to the fatherless
and widow in their affliction James 1.17
; not causing the eye of the widow to fail, or eating his morsel alone, but
letting the fatherless to have a share thereof Job 31.16.27
. He will not see any to perish for want of clothing, nor any poor for lack of
covering; but cause their loins to bless him, by being warmed with the fleece
of his sheep Ver. 19, 20
. He will not suffer the stranger to lodge in the street, but opens his doors
to the traveller Verse 32
.

And albeit he knows that every fruit of his charity, shall abound to his own
account Phil. 4.17
. Yet he makes not merchandise of it, to lay it where it may be most seen, best
remembered, and himself most praised and applauded. He considers where is most
need, most desert, where he may do most good, and bring in greatest glory to
God, there he lays out most although there be little probability that he
shall ever hear more of it: yet he will cast his bread upon the waters Eccles.
11.1
, which carry it down the stream, so as there is little likelihood that he
shall ever see it again. He will give a portion to seven, and also to eight,
because he knows not what evil shall be upon the earth Verse 2
; what mischiefs may befall himself ere he die, and therefore will take the
present opportunity; His wealth may be all swept away as Jobs was, and he
perhaps may be forced to beg himself; therefore he is resolved to take that
counsel, while he has opportunity, to do good unto all, especially unto them
who are of the household of faith Call. 6.10.
. He will take pattern by Philemon, by whom the bowels of the Saints were
refreshed ^hilem. 7
. He is for any thing, whereby not only the want of the Saints may be supplied,
but most thanksgivings also may be given unto God 2 Cor. 9.12.
.

Thus, this hypocrite goes about works of charity, as Nebuchadnezzar about the
builing of Babylon, for the house of the Kingdom, by the might of his power,
and for the honor of his Majesty Dan. 4.30.
; the true Christian is as that better King, who sent his servants into the
highways, and to bid as many as they could find to his marriage Supper Mat.
22.9
. The one gives rather out of hope, or flattery, as men who give gifts to their
betters; the other is as Gaius (the famous Host of the Church Romans 16.23
) that does faithfully, whatsoever he does to the brethren, and to strangers 3
John 5
, although he never see them more.

This hypocrite gives of goods that are not his own.

He first makes many beggars by oppression and fraud, and then builds an
Almes-house with ill-gotten goods to feed a few poor people, perhaps not a
twentieth man of those he has impoverished, like him that first robs, and
then offers part in sacrifice, which the Lord hates Esaias 61.8
. He does as they who built Abbeys and Monasteries in times of Popery, by his
rapine and spoils wickedly committed before; and gives alms as those Abbots,
who kept great houses to feed loyterers out of impropriate tithes, which will
one day bring in a sad reckoning to those that so pervert them, and do little
good to those that are so fed by them.

Or, he does it of goods ill spared, like him to whom God has given riches,
wealth, and honor, so that he wants nothing for his soul (that is his lust)
of all that he desires, yet God has not given him power to eat thereof, but a
stranger eats it Eccles. 6.2
. He defraudeth himself and his family, not only of comforts, but of necessary
maintenance, choosing rather to live miserably, then not to die rich and give
much away.

Contrarily, The Christians charity is of his own well-gotten goods. Differ.


He casts his own bread, not another man's, upon the waters; all duties
discharged both to himself and to those that belong to him. He knows that it
is good and comely, to eat and to drink (with moderation and sobriety) and to
enjoy the good of all his labor, that he takes under the Sun all the days
of his life, which God gives him, for this is his portion, here; and, that
every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him
power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor,
this is the gift of God Eccl. 5.18, 19
. Therefore he will at convenient times, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and
send portions to them for whom nothing is provided Neh. 8.10
.

And if herein he have unworthily failed, he has defrauded himself. Therefore
as restitution is necessary before charity, to others, so also is it to
himself; for as he that defraudeth others, eats or gives bread which is not
his own: so he that defraudeth himself in not eating his own bread is bound to
make restitution; God requires justice to our selves as well as to others. And
although more offend by intemperance than by parsimony and miserableness, yet
no temperance warranteth any man to deny himself Gods own allowance; yea,
there may be intemperance in denying too much, as well as in granting more then
is meet.

Thus, this hypocrites charity is like his devotion that brings the hire of a
whore; or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord Deuteronomy. 23.18
. The true Christian is as David that would not offer sacrifice of that which
was but the gift of another, and not bought with his money, that he might truly
call it his own 2 Samuel 24.24
: the one first robs, before he gives; the other before he give, will see
that all have their due

This hypocrites charity is a churlish charity.

He gives against his will; with a nec been vortat, or, the devil take him.
His bread that he gives is greety, and does him little good that receives it.
It is given against the hair, it is drawn from him like drops of blood, of
which there is no comfort to the receiver, nor thanks to the giver. It is given
even with cursing; as that of old churlish Demea Terent. Adelph.
, who cursed that which his brother Mitio gave to his own son Aeschinus,
profundat, perdat, pereat, let him squander and lavish it out, yea let him
destroy himself and perish with it. He wishes him more mischief then good by
it.

Such give, not milk, but wormwood; not bread but stones; not pottage but
poison. He must needs give a churlish and graceless benefit, that gives it
rather out of force then out of affection; out of humor, rather then out of
charity or any virtue. This hypocrite is so far without natural affection and
compassion, that he readily subscribeth to Zeno's opinion, who reckoned
commiseration among the diseases of the soul. Such a giver, and such a gift
must needs want the true condiment of liberality, which is bounty, sweetness
and cheerfulness in giving.

Yea, sometimes he gives an alms in despite, either to disgrace the receiver
afterward, by blazing it abroad, that he has been fain to relieve him; and
had it not been for him, he might have starved; this is upbraiding charity; or,
(which is as bad) when he gives to a poor man that is to have a collection; or,
to any more public charitable use, he first enquireth what such an one (who
perhaps is richer then himself, or above him in rank, and whom he envieth and
hates) has given to that work; and, being told what, he gives more than the
other, not out of love to the work, but to shame the other, that it may be
proclaimed of him that he gath given below himself, because outdone by him
that was less able, and from whom less was expected.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian gives with cheerfulness Romans 12.8
.

There is in him, first, a readiness to will; then a performance also out of
that which he has 2 Cor. 8.11
. And, according as he purposes in his heart, so he gives, not grudgingly, or
of necessity, because God loves a cheerful giver 2 Cor. 9.7
. He not only gives, but loves to give, and loves him to whom he gives,
even upon this very account, that God has made him the object of his charity,
wherein he so much delights. He not only relieveth, but pitieth and condoleth,
that his very compassion and bowels refresh more than his gift, and double his
alms.

He weepeth with them that weep Romans 12.15
; not shedding the tears of a Crocadile, as Ishmael the son of Nethaniah Jer.
41.6
; but rather of his Savior, who not only raised Lazarus, but also wept over
him John 11.35
, to make it appear how he loved him verse 36
. He is (...), a man of much natural affection, and therefore (...), kindly
affectioned with brotherly love Romans 12.10
. For well he understands that where there are no bowels of compassion, there
can be no love either of man, or of God; and, that tenderness of heart, and
gentleness of disposition are two indelible Characters of a Christian Col. 3.12
.

Thus, this hypocrite is to the poor, as Nabal to David, desiring some
refreshing from him at a time, when he held a feast like a King 1 Samuel 25.36
; shall I take my bread and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my
shearers, and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be verse 11.
? the true Christian is as the old man of Ephraim, sojourning in Gibeah of
Benjamin, who though not so rich, (for he was feign to work all the day in the
field Judge 19.16
) yet, seeing a wayfaring man in the street, without entertainment, that wanted
nothing but a room to lodge in verse 19
; cheerfully took him in, with this friendly welcome. Peace be unto thee, let
all thy wants lie upon me, etc. verse 20
The one gives as if he meant to strike; the other heales by his giving more
then he supplyeth by his gift; the one saves as if he meant to kill; the other
adds another life by his manner of saving one.

This hypocrite when he seems compassionate, his compassions are cruel.

His tender mercies (or bowels) are cruel Prove. 12.10
. That which perhaps he accounts mercy, because less then he could inflict, or
more then by the Law of man he is bound to, being less then his brothers
necessity craveth, and God requires, is no less, no better, then cruelty in
the account of God. It is like that of Adoni-bezek, who caused the thumbs and
great toes of threescore and ten Kings to be cut off, and after that, to make
them eat meat under his Table Judge. 1.7
; he took this to be mercy, for he might have taken their lives, instead of
their thumbs and toes. Or it is like that of the Jews, who five several times
whipped Paul, but gave him but nine and thirty stripes at a time, which was one
less then God allowed. God limited stripes to forty, but they gave one
under. O what compassion! He will add to affliction, and be a miserable
comforter, under pretense of taking Gods part, as Jobs friends in visiting him,
vexed his soul, and broke him in pieces with words Job 19.2
, persecuting him as God, and were not satisfied with his flesh ver. 22
. Or he shows the compassion and clemency of usurpers, giving life, but
taking away livelihood. He is pitiful where God would have him severe, as Saul
to Agag; and cruel, where God commands to show compassion, as he that would
abate nothing to his fellow servants Mat. 18.29, 30
. When he is kind to one, he is cruel to others, as Saul to the Priests of God,
slaying eithty five of them 1 Samuel 22.18
, upon a bare suggestion of one Doeg, a fauning Parasite to Saul, and a professed
enemy to the Priests, because an Edomite; when yet he was over-kinde to Agag
whom the Lord commanded him to destroy 1 Samuel 15.3
; or as Ahab who had compassion on Benhadad 1 King. 20.33
, but cruel to Naboth King. 21.19
. He will where he list be more compassionate than God, that at another time he
may be more cruel then a Tigar.

Contrarily, The Christians charity, and mercy, Differ.
is the kindness of God 2 Samuel 9.3
.

As stars lend light in the absence of the Sun, so Christians out of love
lend comfort and counsel to those whom God has humbled. If it be but any of
the house of Saul, his implacable enemy, he will show him the kindness of God
for Jonathans sake Verse 1
. He loves to show kindness, but loves also to see God go before him to show
him the way. Will God, says he, have me relieve this man in this case? I will
do it. He learneth of God, to make choice of the object, time, end, manner, and
measure of his charity. And, as he is careful not to go before God, or without
him, so he will be sure to follow his standard, and pattern, and make himself
a willing instrument of that good which he sees to be intended of God.

Nor is his charity to one, mixed with cruelty to others in the same heart. He
is not partly a Lamb, and partly a bear robbed of her whelps. His bowels of
compassion take up all the room in his heart, leaving no place for cruelty. He
may perhaps refuse to relieve some, where God forbids him; as the giving to
disorderly Christians, that will not work 2 These. 3.10
, but make their profession a shelter for idleness, that they may live upon
the sweat of other men's brows; whom they account (and perhaps call) the wicked
of the earth. But he will never be cruel to any; unless to their lusts, by
reclaiming them from sin, and reducing them to duty, which is the best
charity, the greatest mercy; for, he converteth a sinner from the error of his
way, and saves a soul from death Jam. 5.20
. He is well satisfied that, as zeal, so, clemency and bounty without
discretion and rule, be not virtues, but vices; and, are virtues, not so much
in their nature, as in their use.

Thus, this hypocrites charity is like that of Ahab to Micaiah, if he allow him
bread, (as he did to the rest of the Prophets) it shall be the bread of
affliction, and the water of affliction, and that in a prison too 1 King. 22.17
; and glad may he be, that he escapes so; the true Christian is as the
converted Jailer, that took Paul and Silas out of the dungeon, washed their
stripes, brought them into his own house, and set meat before them with
rejoicing Act. 16.33, 34
. The one is a tyrant in mercy, the other is merciful in severity.

This Hypocrites charity is rather to the body, and belly, then to the

He glories in keeping a noble house, in the entertaining of all comers to
his Table, to his Cellars, till they be drunk, and reele, and spew again: and
perhaps either himself, or some servant (which he keeps more for that quality
then for any better) will do their utmost to put the cup to his nose, to make
him drunk that comes to eat with him. And so he fills his panch, but destroys
his soul. He accounts it no disparagement, but a mark of his love, to be, as
Nabal, drunk with his guests, especially if he can make them as drunk as
himself Hab. 2.15
.

And so for the poor to whom he gives alms, he will feed, but not reform them
of what he knows and sees in them. Idle vagrants, wandering beggars that will
not work, idle droanes, drunken swearing unclean beasts, that live in the
neighborhood, scarce ever out of the Alehouse, while their poor wives and
children starve, or beg, through his wickedness, are welcome to his door, he
never does so much as the Laws of man, much more what the Law of God requires
2 These. 3.10
, for their reformation; he feeds them, and perhaps clothes them too, that he
may have the name of a good housekeeper, and of a very charitable and merciful
man to the poor, while in the mean time he is most unmerciful and cruel to
their souls Lev. 19.17
. He affords hospitality, but denies instruction.

Yea, this is too often found even in too many Ministers, who getting into the
richest and highest preferments of the Church, under the name of maintaining
hospitality, maintain more disorders, and riot then any others of their
estates round about them. Hence, like people, like Priest; nay, worse Priest
then people. He is first in the riot. Come, says he, I will fetch wine, and we
will fill our selves with strong drink, and to morrow shall be as this day, and
much more abundant Esaias 56.12
. Thus, both are better fed then taught; both have fat bodies, but lean souls.

Nor is this hypocrite better to his family, or to the children of his Ioynes.
He provideth well for their backs and their bellies, feeds them to the full
till they kick with the heel, at him that feeds them; he cloatheth them with
garments above his rank, or above his purse, which makes them proud, even to
the despising of their betters, and of him too: But of the soul he has no care
at all, to cloth it with virtue, with humility, and good disposition. He may
be at charge for their education, to set them out, and make them more capable
of preferment in the world; but, uses no means to train them up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord Ephesians. 6.4
, for the good of their souls in reference to eternity. His care is only of
the vegetative faculty, that the soul may do the office of salt to the body, to
keep it from putrefaction.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christians charity extends to the whole man, and to the
best part most.

He will feed soul and body too; if not at the same time, yet with the same
care and charity. He will take his time for the one as well as for the other.
And as the body is more worth then raiment Mat. 6.25
; so he knows one soul to be of more value then ten thousand bodies without
souls, or with lost souls; yea, then the whole world, and that there is nothing
to be given in exchange for the soul Mar. 8.36, 37
. Therefore he carefully observes the difference between the soul and the
body, and the pre-eminence of the one above the other. He neglects not the
body, because it is the house, the case the organ of the soul; but his chief
care is for the soul, whether it be of his wife, children, servants, hearers,
friends. His charity is entire; He loves not as a lustful lover, that loves
chiefly for a face, or what else he has a mind to abuse; but he loves as the
father his child whom he loves in the Lord. He loves those that are good,
because they love God, and those that are evil, that he may bring them in love
with God.

Thus this hypocrites love is like that of Dives, the rich man which was
clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared deliciously every day; and kept a
good Table for all comers; Luke 16.19
especially for his five brethren, but for their souls he never took care till
himself was in hell Verse 28.
; the true Christian is as Solomon entertaining the Queen of Sheba, giving a
specimen of his wisdom, as well as of his magnificence 1 King. 10.4, 5
, that all, servants as well as others, might be blessed in his presence, as
well as in his meat Verse 8, 9
; the charity of the one is gut-love; of the other, soul-love; the alms of the
one is cast away; the charity of the other saves all.

This hypocrites charity is in the way of merchandise or traffic.

He casts not his bread on the waters, but sets it forth as in a Merchants
ship, of which he exspects a return with good advantage; and, very careful he
is, to assure the adventure. He does not dare, freely give, but mutuo dare, put
forth upon usury, and and expects a valuable profit, in one kind or other.
He gives to them that can procure him friends Acts 12.20
, that can help him to good penny-worths, that will conceal his closer
adulteries, frauds and cheats in trading; or, that at least will extol and
applaud him, and so pay him in report what they cannot return in kind. Thus
he exercises a kind of commutative charity. In every alms, he aims at a
reward from man, and he has it Mat. 6 4
, or he will give no more. And God in judgment lets him reap here what he
has most mind to, (because some be better for his charity;) that he may
expect nothing hereafter. He does nothing but to be seen of men, therefore
nothing more shall be given him. He will be paid in this world, for all his
good works, which makes him a miserable gainer by the loss of his soul, and of
his works together in the world to come.

Contrariwise, The true Christians Charity is a dole. Differ.


A free gift, to the poor man's belly; not a commodity sold in the market. He
expects no return on earth; yea, he rather fears than hopes it, lest it should
happen to him as to the hypocrites alms, to be unaccepted of God. He seriously
carries in mind that admonition of his Lord, When thou make a dinner, or a
supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy
rich neighbors, lest they bid thee again, and so a recompense be made thee
Luke 14.12
. Not as concluding it unlawful to bid rich friends at all, (for Christ himself
was at a wedding feast John 2.
; and Abraham made a great feast at the weaning of Isaac Genesis 21.8.
, at which, no doubt, there were some beside beggars:) to say nothing of the
feast of Purim, which lasted two days, by solemn Ordinance of the Jews every
year Esth. 9.27
, wherein the richer sort sent portions one to another, beside gifts for the
poor ver. 22
; but, as being more careful to feed the bodies of the poor, that it may
appear that he remembers the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is a
more blessed thing to give, then to receive Act. 20.35
. Wherefore, if any thing come home, he will send it out again, by a new
largess, that he may die a creditor to God.

Nay, he loves not so much as to hear of his good works. The conscience of a
good work is enough to him: let the benefit accrue to the Receiver, and the
glory to God. To have whereof to give, and to find to whom to give, and
especially to obtain grace to be willing to give, is an abundant reward to
such a giver. Wherefore he is more glad of a meet object on whom to bestow,
then the poor man is to receive. For, if the Philosopher could say, that unto
a fortunate man, friends are necessary; not, to receive of them, but to have on
whom to bestow; much more must it needs add to the happiness of a Christian,
to be so furnished, as having a better God to reward him in a better world. All
that behold him thus giving, must needs say O happy Giver! rather then, O happy
Receiver! Possibly he may tender a gift to a great man to prevent a mischief,
as Abigail presented David, to save her self and family from ruin, occasioned
by the churlishness and wicked folly of her husband 1 Samuel 25.27
; and, as Jacobs sons did unto Joseph Genesis 43.26
. But, he does not with an aim to be a gainer by the gift, but only to be a
saver when so forced to give. He uses not this as a trade, but as an
extraordinary assay at a dead lift.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Dives that made great provision for his rich
kindred and friends at his own table, but gave not so much as of the crumbs that
fell from his table, to Lazarus lying at his gate, so that his very dogs showed
more compassion then himself Luke 16.21
; the true Christian is like the Jews at their feast of Purim, wherein he is as
careful of sending gifts to the poor, as portions to others: the one is like a
briber, who gives a present to buy a better thing with it, and expects to see
it again with interest; the other is like Polycrates of Samos, casting his
ring of very great value into the sea, without expecting ever to see it more;
being also herein like him too, that as a fish unexpectedly brought that ring
to the owner, so providence, without looking for, brings blessings to the
Almner.

This hypocrite seeks a friend for his own sake.

Look what this hypocrite has showed himself in his charity, or alms, such,
and no better, will he appear in the matter of Friendship. This is he, of whom
warning was so long since given, trust ye not in a friend, put not confidence
in a guide Micah 7.5
; for, this is a brother that will utterly supplant Jer. 9.4.
, he diggeth a pit for his friend Job. 6.27
. Sometimes, as Artaxerxes proved men of worth, not for love of virtue, but to
make himself honorable by putting them upon the proof; so this hypocrite is a
great pretender of friendship to many whom he flattereth, that thereby he may
try which among them all is likely to be most beneficial to himself; and to him
will he be a friend, ut been sit sibi, that he may be sure to make a good
market for himself. This argues him to be no friend, for that, as Phocion told
Antipater, a friend, and a flatterer, are inconsistent.

To do all things for his own sake, is the general property of an evil man, and
the more evil he is, the more this agrees to him. Yet herein this hypocrite
does not truly love so much as himself, even when he loves none else but for
himself: for he differs from himself. One thing he wills, another thing he
desires, and does as the riotous person, that feign would be rich, but spends
all. He makes a friend to serve his turn now, when he meets with a fool: but,
so soon as his own mind, or interest alters, this friend will go with him no
further, until he can work further upon his friend to make him turn knave. And
this is the just recompense of him that will first be a fool to serve an
hypocrites turn; He must after be a knave, or be turned out of favor. Yea,
this also is the just punishment of the hypocrite, that, by dissembling
friendship, draws in others to serve him in a corrupt way, he must enforce them
to turn knave, so often, that at length he dares neither to trust them longer,
nor to be rid of them at all, for fear they should do him more mischief then
ever they did him good. This is the true reason why knaves find so much favor
in the world.

He seeks not so much the friendship, as company of others, because he is
weary and ashamed of his own company. He sees nothing in himself, neither
wisdom in his head, nor virtue in his heart, to make him lovely to himself or
others; therefore he seeks company that he may forget himself. There is, as the
Philosopher observes, a kind of sedition or secession in such a man's mind;
no marvel then, if he make bad use of his friend, when he cannot maintain true
terms of friendship with himself. For of the two, he had rather be a friend to
himself, then to his friend, and his care is to be loved rather then to love;
and because he is ever unstable and fickle, and forced so to be (for evil men
commit so many errors every day, while in a wrong way, that they must daily
shift resolutions, yea, vows and oaths too;) that he is still apt to think
himself not sufficiently paid in that kind, and cries out, utinam aeque mihi
pars esset amoris tecum. I would my share in thy love were equal to thine in
mine; when, if it be not, the fault is only in himself. He loves his friend to
make use of him as a servant; therefore loves him not as a friend; Cum servo
non colitur amicitia, True friendship cannot stoop to shake hands with a
servant, not only because too low, but because disproportionable, which makes
the other as jealous as he. If this hypocrite be alone, and has no friend, vae
soli. Woe unto him Eccles. 4 10
. He is as a man that has but one leg, and cannot go. If he get a friend, it
is but only to serve himself, to which friend he is at best but a wooden leg,
which he can set on, and take off at his pleasure.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christians friendship is the good of his friend.

He is the true Philadelphian, that knows what belongs to brotherly-love. He
looks upon friendship as it is in it self, not as wrested to serve turns.
Friendship has always been counted sacred; and Lawgivers have therefore been
more careful of love and concord than of justice, that friendship may be
preserved inviolable, whatever become of private commodity. Where love is,
there is little need of justice, save what love it self executes. But we
cannot say, where there is justice, there is no need of love. Every man needs
friendship for the civil and sociable life, as he does fire and water for
natural life; mean men need friends to support them; and great men, to tell
them the truth. Even the happiest and wisest men need friends, if but to
exercise virtue, and to increase it by communion.

A friend therefore is a most precious jewel, as honey for sweetness, as
ointment and perfume to rejoice the heart Prove. 27.9
. He is as a brother, yea, as a man's own heart, in the intending and procuring
of good to his friend more then to himself. Such a friend is this Christian, he
begins with benevolence, the ground of friendship; he wishes and intends all
the good he can unto him, and chooses rather to be a loser by his love, then a
gainer by loving. And as he is hearty in willing; so is he as serious and
sincere in procuring what he wills: Always provided that the thing willed be
good in it self; and good for him, honest as well as pleasing. Friendship is
only between those that are good; and, in goodness alone. Friends, if brethren
in evil, become enemies.

He regards the good of his friend in the first place, that it may be well
with his friend, although with some loss to himself. Not that his own loss is
intended; but that his friends good is chiefly in his eye. Friendship aims at
the good of both; else, were it no friendship; but each friend esteeming the
other better then himself, neither of them looks chiefly to his own things,
but to the things of the other also Phil. 2.3, 4
. The love of a friend is natural and fatherly, descending, and providing for
the good of him whom he loves.

But in things honest, and communicable the Christian seeks his own good
also: His heart trusts in his friend, he takes delight and comfort in such an
one whom he may trust, expects counsel, comfort, prayers and helpfulnesse
otherwise also, as opportunity is offered. We took sweet counsel together,
says David, even of a false friend, till he discovered his falsehood Psalm. 55.14
. There is a lawful self-love, even in loving others; to be the better for them
in spirituals especially. The Christian therefore in that nature loves
himself, and his neighbor as himself. Gods image in himself is nearest to
himself, that he loves in himself. But he rests not there, he seeks
companions in virtue, not as being weary of himself, but that he may have a
larger field to exercise goodness, and both to impart and receive more good.
Home is best, yet he goes abroad to communicate his goodness, as they that go
to market to make many partakers of their commodities. He therefore having
friends, shows himself friendly, and sticks faster then a brother Prove.
18.24
. He is more afraid not to love, then not to be loved; yet he would never love
with the love of friendship, did he not expect love again. The mutual love of
both is intended and expected, but he intends not so much his own profit, as
the benefit of his friend whom he loves as himself.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Laban, professing great friendship to Jacob, and
desiring his continuance, not for the benefit of Jacob (whose wages he had
changed ten times Genesis 31.41
, as thinking it too much) but because the old fox had learned by experience
that the Lord had blessed him for Jacobs sake Genesis 30.27
, the true Christian is as Jonathan to David, preferring the preservation of
his friend before his own safety 1 Samuel 20.33, 34
; the one makes use of his friend, as Amnon of Jonadab, to assist him in his
lust 1 Samuel 13.4, 5
; the other as Mordecai of Hester, for the saving of her self, and of the rest
of the Jews Nation Esth. 4.13, 14
.

This hypocrites friendship is confined by profit, or lust.

He loves ad arcas, non ad aras, as far as the chest, but not as the Altar,
as for matter of Religion he can easily step over that block; the only thing
that stops the course of his friendship, and breaks the league of love, is
respect to his own gain and profit. And if Religion can be brought within that
compass of his gain, then he cries up Religion with all his throat; and then,
pro aris and focis, for alters and gain both meeting together, he will be as
mad as Demetrius and his fellows for Diana of the Ephesians Acts 19.28
; but the main business debated was, the danger of losing their trade, if
Diana went down verse 25.
.

Or, if his friend prove his rival, then farewell friendship. Here, figulus
figulo (one tradesman envies another of the same occupation) will quickly be
verified. If his friend prove to be his corrival in love (yea, in lust) his
competitor in honor, his partner in profit, these are like the pillar of
Hercules, beyond which, friendship shall never move. He leaves his friend in
the plain field, and turns his enemy. If his friend be dishonest,
irreligious, superstitious, all this may be borne, without making a breach.
It Is but a question of Words, and Names, and of one Jesus, and of the
resurrection, some such matters as in Galio's opinion, deserve not to be taken
notice of among wise men. Here he can hold on a course of friendship without
quarrelling. But, if once the bone of profit or some other lust be cast in
between them, this parts him, as it did Demas 2 Timothy 4.10
, from his dearest friend, which he loves not so well as he does this present
world.

Differ.
Contrarily, The true Christian limitteth his friendship by the bounds of
Religion.

So far as God will own his friend, so far will he, but no further; he loves
ad aras, not ad arcas, till Religion part them; gain shall not do it. If God
stand with his sword drawn against him or his friend, as once against Balaam,
his friendship dares go no further. God keeps his conscience in awe, and
conscience his friendship: so that he will not help the ungodly, nor love them
that hate the Lord 2 Chronicles. 19.2
. Unto a profane wicked man he is ready to give the answer of Agesilaus to the
Persian King (desiring his friendship) common amity is enough with the common
enemy of our country. With the enemy of Religion, or godliness, it is enough
to observe the general rule, to live peaceably, if it be possible Romans 12.18
, peace without enmity, but not friendship with familiarity.

But, if he light on a godly and a virtuous friend, the penny shall not part
his friendship: He is a companion to all them that fear God, and that keep his
precepts Psalm. 119.63
. He will (upon better ground) say to such an one, as Jehoshaphat to Ahab, I am
as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses are as thy horses 1 King.
22.2.
. Such friendship has a stronger tie than that of nature or civil commerce and
covenants, it is confirmed by Religion, as that of David and Jonathan by the
oath of God 2 Samuel 21.7
. So that we may call it a Sacramental friendship, because confirmed by the
fear, that is the oath of the Almighty Job 6.14
. The fear of the Almighty makes him keep the law of friendship; but where
Religion is neglected, God himself casts in bones of contention, and breaks
the knot of friendship, as we see in Solomon who was at first a Prince of peace
with all the Nations round about him; but after his fall to idolatry God
stirred up Adversaries, as Hadad, Rezin, and Jeroboam 1 Kin. 11.23, etc.
against him.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Balak who by several messages promised to be a
friend to Balaam, so he would curse Israel whom the Lord had blessed; but if
Balaam will not, or cannot do that, he that before courted him so much, now
bids him flee to his own place; and he that before might have had honor, or
any thing, is now sent away with threatening; the true Christian is as Jonathan
to David, a friend unto him even after he had been told by his own father that
Jonathan had chosen David to his own confusion, meaning in regard of Jonathans
succession to Saul in the Kingdom 1 Samuel 20.30, 31.
: The one will be a friend to none but for his own ends: the other disdains to
be a friend to any upon such a base account.

This hypocrite loves his friend in prosperity, but not in adversity.

If his friend be never so dishonest, that breaks no friendship, so long as he
bears up his port, and thriveth in the world: for he that chose him to be his
friend, not for his honesty, but in hope to gain by him, will not forsake him
for dishonesty, so long as there is hope of profit. But if once he sink and
grow poor, or fall into disgrace and danger, and that all hope of gain is at
an end what should this hypocrite hold friendship with him any longer? Well may
his friend find him a razor to shave him, but he will never find him a sword
to defend him. Yea, look what a broken tooth, or a foot out of joint is, such
will his confidence be in such an unfaithful man Prove. 25.19
. If he come to this hypocrite in his poverty, he will not own him. And no
marvel; for, if all the brethren of the poor do hate him, how much more does
such a false friend go far from him? He may pursue him with words, yet will he
be wanting to him Prove. 19.7
, as to any relief, or ease. A wise man therefore will try friends, as he does
money, not in the exigent, when he is to use them, but before hand, while he
has time to amend the error of his choice, and to provide better in the room.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is a constant friend.

He looks well to his choice at first, but having once chosen he remembers
the rule; thine own friend, and thy fathers friend forsake not. Prove. 17.10
This friend loves at all times, he is that brother that is borne for
adversity Prove 17.17
. Even nature teaches every one to be true to his own interest, much more does
grace, a Christian. He chooses not his friend for wealth, or for prosperity,
or for any unworthy ends of his own, these things therefore being removed,
cannot put a period to his love which had no hand in the beginning of it. It
was honesty, piety, wisdom, sweetness of disposition that drew on his love to
smite a league of friendship at the first; and while these remain he cannot
cease to love. Adversity does not take away, but rather scour off the rust
that by long prosperity perhaps is gotten into them: So that he is never
better, nor scarce so good a friend and companion, as when he is at the lowest.
If then he need more help, he will deserve it; for then is he in a better frame
of spirit to be helpful to his friend, especially in the choicest acts of true
godly friendship, then ever he was before. Therefore as it is the true
touchstone of friendship, so it is the property of every truly Christian
friend, so far to pursue his own interest, to be a companion without envy in
prosperity, and without weariness in adversity; to stick to his friend in
danger, but never in dishonesty.

Thus, this hypocrite is as lice that feed on men living, but forsake them when
they are dying; the true Christian is to his friend like good works that follow
a good man after death: the one is as the Cuckoe, that will let you have his
company even till you be weary of him, in Summer; but, before Winter, takes
leave; the other is as the Blackbird that keeps constantly with you; and, is
of use (if need be) to feed you in Winter.

This hypocrite affects to be accounted a friend to every man.

He is a Pamphilus, quasi (...), or (...), all men's friend: So he would be
thought. Not that he is so, no more then Absalom was to those of Israel whom he
kissed 2 Samuel 15.5
; but would seem so to make himself the more popular, and the more to get by
all. He has exactly studied the Politician in this point, to be a fair spoken
man to all; to blame none, lest he displease some, and so lose his opportunity
of making his own advantage of them. Popularity he takes to be good policy, in
hope that his verbal and cringing courtesy will at length pass for real
friendship, and gain him credit to be trusted till he has cheated his fill.

But he that is a friend to all men, is a friend to no man, and least of all to
himself. For he must promise so much, that he cannot perform withal: and so
breaking promise with some, he is trusted at length by none. Therefore, as he
who boasted he had no enemy, was well reproved by Chilon, when he asked him, if
he had any friend. So he is far from a capacity to be truly be friended of
any, who is seemingly a friend to all; but really a friend to none, and,
increases enemies by pretending friendship.

On the contrary, Differ.
The true Christian is a friend to none that are enemies to God.

He finds out Gods friends, and them he makes his Psalm 119.63
. He finds out also the enemies of God, and those he keeps at staves end. He
honors them that fear God, but a vile person is despised in his eyes, as
well as in his heart Psalm 45.4
. He will grace him so much by his eye and countenance as to give him any
reason to think or say that the Christian is his friend. He hates them that
hate God, and is grieved with those that rise up against God: yea, he hates
them with perfect hatred, he accounts them his enemies Ps. 139.21, 22
.

Friendship is a choosing out of some men from amongst the rest, and a becoming
one with them as better worthy to be beloved. His love is without
dissimulation, therefore he cannot so far forget himself and his God, as to
say, a confederacy to all them to whom this Nation of hypocrites says a
confederacy Esaias 8.12
. To the godly he says, in you (the excellent of the earth) is all my delight
Psalm. 16.3
But to the profane and ungodly, Depart from me ye evil doers, for I will keep
the Commandments of my God Psalm. 119.11^
. He will not so much as sit with them Psalm 26.5
; and that because he hates them. He knows that as friendship with the world
is enmity with God; so to contract friendship with the wicked, is to join with
Gods enemies, and to make him to turn enemy to him that so does. The very
holding of correspondence with rebels and traitors although there be yet no
taking part with them in the rebellion, is taken for treason. He forgets not
that sharp check to Jehoshaphat for joining in friendship with two such wicked
Kings, as Ahab and Jehoram: should thou help the ungodly, and love them that
hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord 2 Chr. 19.2
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Herod that strove by popularity to please all,
whereby he displeased God, and lost himself Act. 12.22, 23
. The true Christian will please God in the choice of his friends how many
enemies soever he create unto himself thereby; the one seeking by flattery to
win all, loses all and himself too; the other, by wisdom and goodness, is a
friend to all, even while he is looked upon as an enemy, and at the long run
gains all.

This Hypocrite cares not to better those whom he seems to love best.

If he can draw him to his lure, to serve his ends; it is all he aims at;
all, he striveth unto. He uses him as men use laborers whom they hire by the
day: They look not how tattered they be in clothes, so they do their work. They
put them not in new clothes, but only pay them their wages. If he be
halfe-naked, it is all one to him that hires him. It is a part of the hypocrites
boasting, that he can love without desire, therein, he thinks he imitates God;
but, where ever God loves, he makes the party better; John 15.2
this, the hypocrite takes no notice of, but pleases himself in his own
deceivings; letting any man be as bad as he will, so he be good for his purpose.

The wiser and more virtuous his friend is, the worse for his design; the more
foolish and vicious, the fitter for his turn; as Zedekiah the false prophet,
suited better with Ahab then Micaiah the Prophet of the Lord. He cares not to
employ or consult with such as will deal wisely and plainly; but he chooses
rather such tools as are fittest for his work; men that will be, and do any
thing to please him; which he cannot hope for, of good men; nor, of his own
instruments, if he make or suffer them to be made better. If he can debauch him
that once pretended unto piety, that is the man for his money. He shall have any
thing of him, because he knows he will do any thing for him. Give him a
converted Puritan (for so he calls him that falls off from godliness) above all
others to deal with the Puritans. For he is now as Absalom, lying with his
fathers Concubines; there is no hope of his reconciliation to his former
companions with whom he walked to the house of God in company.

He is much of Socrates his mind, affecting commendation for loving the worst;
as he did, forbearing with such a scould and ill-natured wife as Xanthippe. He
thought himself the better man for being able to bear one so bad. But, true
virtue stands in no need of such a foil; but rather delights in being out-gone
by all that she vouchsafes to company with. Nor is he much better that loved
Alcibiades, upon pretense to make him better; for, even therein, he loved
himself best, as the soil, that made a barren field fruitful. He loves such a
piece, to show his own skill to make broth of a stools leg: and to publish
his own worth, by having it said of him, that he has made Alcibiades virtuous.
He is now virtuous; but, of his making.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians friendship is chiefly seen in making his
friend more like unto God.

He would have his friend in some degree good before he give him the right hand
of fellowship, but, this suffices not; he will study his bettering, and
further progress in knowledge and grace. He is of Paul's mind, toward all;
this we wish, even your perfection 2 Cor. 13.9.
; especially to his friend, whom he wishes to prosper even as his soul
prospers 3 John 9
. He loves his friend, as Christ loves his Church, which he purges more and
more to make her yet more beautiful, that he may present it to himself a
glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it
should be holy and without blemish Ephesians. 5.27
. He travelleth with his friend, as Paul with the Galatians Gal. 4.19
, that Christ may be yet more perfectly formed in him. He neither takes liberty
to himself, nor willingly suffers his friend to do amiss. He would grow in
goodness, and would have his friend grow with him, and is content his friend
should partake in worth, as well as in worship.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul, who loved Doeg an Edomite, because he served
his turn better in slaying eighty five of the Lords Priests at once, then his
own servants who refused that butchery 1 Samuel 22.17, 18
; the true Christian is as Mordecai, that sought the wealth of his people Esth.
10.3
; to make them good, as well as to procure good unto them: the one is as the
Priests that made use of Judas for their own bloody purpose; but never take
care of his healing when wounded in conscience for it, bidding him to look to
that himself Mat. 27.4
. The other is as David, taking care of Abiathar, who escaped the hand of Doeg
that slew the Priests upon David's occasion; bidding him to abide with him, and
assuring him of safety 1 Samuel 22.23
.

This hypocrite loves so, as if he meant to hate.

He that never had good ground whereon to fix his love, will easily, without
ground, remove it. He is very hot for a while, and the hotter and larger his
affection, on the sudden, the sooner it is apt to cool and dwindle into
nothing. He loves to extremity, while pleased; but hates more furiously, if
crossed in his humor. He is a man made up of humor, not of judgment. And
humor is like tinder; as soon on fire, as touched. He takes not a friend for
better, for worse; but to please his fancy; therefore he will forbear him in
nothing wherein his friend dasheth against his darling. He may with less
danger break an arm or a leg, then touch an humor. Discontent him therein,
and he shall pursue his friend as fiercely as he that, upon the least occasion,
vexes his neighbor to his undoing, with suits of Law: and be as eager as the
harlot to have the living child divided, on purpose to grieve the adverse party
1 King. 3.26


If a spirit of envy possess him, his friends thriving is enough to make a
quarrel, which shall be pursued with so much heat, that he will account it a
good issue of the contest, if by losing one of his own eyes, he may put out
both eyes of the other. And yet, forsooth, this hypocrite must not be charged
with being out of charity, or as having any want thereof. Wisely therefore does
Solomon banish all such furious fools from the Court of friendship Prove. 22.24
. The like may be said of the suspicious and jealous man, that ever carries his
hell about him, and never goes without bellows to blow up the fire, lest it
should go out too soon. For, as fury, so fancy and frenzy, is a foe to
friendship.

On the contrary, the Christians friendship is patient. Differ.


His friendship is from chartiy, not from fancy; and charity suffers long,
and is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not her self (or, is not rash) is not
puffed up, does not behave it self unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily
provoked, thinks no evil, bears all things, believes all things, hops
all things, endures all things 1 Cor. 13.4, 5, 7
. If his friend be injurious, he suffers it; if froward, he is kind; if
fallen, he vaunteth not himself over him, nor is rash in censuring; if far
behind him in parts, he is not puffed up; if provoking him to passion, he does
not behave himself unseemly; if a self-seeker, he seeks not his own; if he
vex him daily, he is not easily provoked; if he carry himself so doubtfully
that he knows not what to make of him, he thinks no evil; if he load him with
injuries, he bears all things; if he promise amendment, he believes all
things; if yet he reform not according to promise, he hops all things; and,
if in all things he be cross and thwarting, the Christian endures all things.

He knows that never were friends so well sorted and suited, but that there
would be something unsuited, making each burdensome to the other, and requiring
not only patience, but wisdom to bear one another burdens if ever they mean
to fulfill the Law of Christ Gal. 6.2
. They must provide shoulders to bear, as well as hands to assist, and bear
what cannot be avoided, if they will do as they would be done unto. They cast
this before hand, and expect it, although they do what they can to prevent it.
This, people who are wise, prepare for, and buckle to, even in the nearest and
dearest bond of love, marriage it self; yea, even in marriage in the Lord; they
shall have trouble in the flesh. And therefore however it be a man's wisdom so
to love a friend, as one that possibly may prove an enemy, yet it is his care
to do whatever he may to prevent it on both sides.

He enters into friendship with the denial of himself, and of his friend too
if he deviate and fall off from piety and honesty. And he so carries himself
in friendship, that if his friend prove an enemy, he may have no such advantage
against him as to lie at his mercy, as knowing there is no hatred like
friendship turned into enmity. Therefore he takes out that lesson, Trust ye not
in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide, keep the door of thy mouth from
her that lies in thy bosom Micah 7.5
. Somethings are not to be told to friends by him that is a friend to himself.
He accounts it a folly to commit himself to the power and danger of another,
where he may avoid it. Christ himself would not do it John 2.24
, because he knew the danger. A Christian therefore should shun it the more,
because Christ himself, who was ignorant of nothing, shunned it so much. For
hereby whether he be compelled to hate where now he loves, or be forsaken of
his friend whom he desires still to love, he is still on sure ground, not to
forfeit himself to the hatred of an enemy.

Thus, this hypocrite is like some sworn brothers that engage to live and die
together, yet in the turning of an hand, or for the wagging of a feather turn
mortal enemies; the true Christian is to his friend what Paul (upon better
grounds) was to the Corinthians, who were in his heart to live and die with
them, and so continued 2 Cor. 7.3
: the one is as Laban quarrelling with Jacob more for carrying away his idols,
then his daughters Genesis 31.30
; the other, as Jehoshaphat pacifying Ahab in his hatred of Micaiah 1 King. 22.8
; the one, even in loving lays a foundation of hatred by his own self-love
and self-will; the other preventeth the breach of friendship by arming himself
with denial of both his self and his will.

This hypocrite is a palate friend.

He is amicus a voluptatibus, a friend merely upon the account of pleasures,
please his palate, or other lust, and you have him body and soul. And if you be
a man for pleasures, he is yours for ever. He will fit you to an hair. Jonadab
never fitted Amnon better, then he will fit you. He will be ad omnia quare; say
what you will have, and he will be your Pandor. He is for pleasure, if you love
that; for profit, if you be covetous; for raising you (so far as he can) if you
be ambitious. He will be to you as pleasing as the harlot, whose lips drop as
an honey comb Prove. 5.3
He is willing to sow pleasure, that he may reap profit. But when his profit
ends, your pleasure may toll the bell.

He looks only to that way that may soonest catch you, not what may do you most
good. His gratifications are like the drunkards wine that looks pleasantly in
the glass, and goes down merrily, but at last it biteth like a Serpent, and
stingeth like an Adder Prove. 23.32
? you shall pay dear for his friendship, and for your own pleasures of his
procuring. He will not serve you for naught. His kisses are pleasant; but,
deceitful. He pretends friendship, but never more your enemy, then when he is
most for your pleasure.

Differ.
Contrarily, The Christians friendship is rather wholesome then tooth-some.

True friendship is a mixed thing, not of sincerity and deceit, but of
sweetness and sharpness. It is a kind of (...), a bitter-sweet. It has not
only sweetmeats, but pills; corosives as well as healing playsters. It can
wound as well as heal; yea, it must wound, that it may heal, The blewnesse of
the wound cleanses away evil Prove. 20.30
. He must sometimes beat his friend, as Paul did his own body; 1 Cor. 9.27
black and blew by reproach, and cause his stripes to search the very bottom
of the belly; to rub it over and over as hard as it can, as men do a vessel
that is deeply eaten with rust to get it off. The Christian desires not to be
harsh, yet will be faithful. If feculent matter that nourishes vice, cleave to
his friend, he will strain a point of kindness, to purge it out although with
more rough then pleasing Physic.

Thus, this hypocrites friendship is like the kisses of an enemy, which are
deceitful Prove. 27.6
; the friendship of a Christian is like the wounds of a friend, which are
faithful; the one is a baud, the other, a Physician.

This hyprocrite is a friend more for profit then for friendship.

True friendship consists not so much in praising or hugging, as in bettering
a friend. But he that is himself evil, cares not to have any man better. If he
can turn friendship to the account of profit, he will be any man's servant that
will serve him in this way, let his profitable friend be as wicked as he will,
mali non gaudent malis, nisi propter utile. It is profit that links evil men
together. Who will show us any good Psalm 4.6
? is the grand enquiry of such men, but they account nothing good, but what
fills the purse. Such friends are like cheating gamesters that play no longer
then each can hope to get victory over the other in cheating. This hypocrite is
such a gamester, a friend to any man by whom he may get: to none, by whom he is
likely to lose.

The very form of his friend is a contract for gain. Help me, and I will help
thee; serve my turn and I will serve thine, is the great Covenant between
them. If he can convert the dead man's Apothegme ( hodie mihi cras tibi, what to
day is to me, to morrow shall be to thee,) to his own profit while he lives, he
embraces a friend with all his heart; only he is careful to ride the
fore-horse; his turn is to be first served, to day, to me. And, in this
account he is your servant for ever; measuring for ever, by profit, not by
years.

In cases of judgment and justice, if this hypocrite espy a Legion of Angels
(good store of gold) coming toward him, he must needs fall down and worship;
and if not the cause, but the person; bribery, perjury and all unrighteousness
get the day, you must not blame him: for he was as busy when your cause was in
hearing, as ever Abraham or Lot were in entertaining of a far less number of
better Angels. Nay, he will play at small game, rather then sit out. If he be a
man for gain, he will respect persons as they respect him; and, for a piece of
bread that man will transgress Prove. 28.21
; yea, he shall pollute God himself by any kind of injustice, for handfuls of
barley and pieces of bread Ezekiel. 13.19
. This makes him that could be content in regard of his own disposition to do
justice, to alter his mind for a corrupting friend, unless the other side set
him right again by a greater gift. While profit binds, he is fast enough:
when that fails, or runs quicker through another pipe, he and his friend fall
asunder; but if profit turn to the other side, he is an utter enemy.

Contrariwise, the true Christian is a friend more for virtue then for profit;
yea, Differ.
for virtue against profit.

He that is himself good (as every man who is a true friend, must be) looks
more at goodness then profit; at godliness more then at gain. If he can put
his friend in a way of profit, he rejoices; but if gain and goodness will
not walk together, he leaves gain to follow goodness; and this he prefers
to his friend before gain. He commends goodness to him as the chief commodity;
and gain but as the sweepings of the market. And while the hypocrite supposes
gain to be godliness 1 Timothy 6.5
; he on the contrary, finds and commends godliness to be the greatest gain
Verse 6.
. For this he is a friend; and, herein, he will mostly show himself friendly.

If he see his friend apt to contention, he will endeavor to put out that fire
by casting upon it this water, why do you not suffer your self rather to be
defrauded 1 Cor. 6.7.
; than to be quarrelsome? And although this be strange, counsel in contentious
days, yet he cannot take himself to be a true friend, if he give not counsel to
his friend to be in some things a loser, that he may be a gainer in his peace,
and more Christianly disposed in his heart. He never was true friend to his
neighbor that endeavors not to make peace between neighbors, if either will
hear him as a Counselor of peace Prove. 12.20
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Ahitophel giving counsel to Absalom to advance his
design, by wickedness in lying with his fathers Concubines in the sight of all
Israel 2 Samuel 16.21, 22
; the true Christian is as the Prophet counselling Amaziah to lose his hundred
talents given to the Army of Israel, because Lord was not with Israel, to wit,
with all the children of Ephraim 2 Chronicles. 25.7
; the one counsels for gain, accounting all fish that comes to net; the
other gives counsel for profit which may indeed add to the comfort and
happiness of his friend who otherwise might lose by his gain Mar. 8.36
.

This hypocrite concealeth the imperfections of his friend, with intent to
discover them.

He is a strict observer of his friend, and the more wickedness he secretly
commiteth with the privity of this hypocrite, the better; for now, he must
either be his slave to charm him to keep counsel, or be undone. This hypocrite
has him now where he would have him, and as he would have him, to choose. Let
him now deny him any thing, or not be still heaping favors upon him, if he
dares. His care is to keep himself blameless, and not his friend. Therefore he
so observes, as if he took no notice; or, so takes notice, as if he meant to be
secret, and tender of his friends reputation.

Nevertheless, he notes them as carefully, captiously and maliciously as any
other, although it be yet no time to take notice of them; for a while, he must
laugh in his sleeve. If he speak of it, it is in private behind his back,
where he thinks the other shall not hear of it, to make himself merry with
the infirmities of his friend. But when he has no more use or need of his
friendship, and can gain by him no longer, then he bolteth out at once all his
friends frailties and his own venom together, insulting over him whom before
he seemed to adore. Then it appears what use he made of his familiarity;
namely, to lay a ground to contemn him and tyrannise over him, and to lay open
his shame to make him odious to others, when he cease to be beneficial to
himself.

He is first a flatterer, and then a tale-carrier Prove. 20.19
. He is perhaps the first tempter of his friend to evil, as Ahitophel was of
Absalom to that incest with his fathers Concubines, which till advised to it,
he perhaps never dreamt of, and he had at that time, other matters of more
concernment, then such wanton wickedness to think upon. Or, if he tempt not to
it, yet he flattereth him in it; or at least concealeth his knowledge of it,
keeping his friend hood-winkt from a true sight of his own faults whereby he
might mend them; but will not long keep them from others who will despise his
friend for them. Yea, therefore he refuses to hold the glass to thee, that he
may when he sees his time, and when thy wickedness is riper, hold forth a
picture of thy deformities to others; for, a flatterer will surely prove a
slanderer.

He that flattereth thee to thy face, will slander thee when thy back is
turned. He that will hide thee from thy self, will display thee to others. He
that sees his friends face foul, and will not tell him of it, shows that he
means it should not be made clean till others have noted it, and made some
sport with it; and therefore will not speak of it, lest it should be mended.

He that is such a flatterer is also a wanderer, thrusting into every company
to hear and tell news; and to make himself more acceptable, he begins with a
story of thee. He goes about as a talebearer, revealing secrets Ibid.
, setting friends at variance Prove. 16.28
, and then makes sport with their differences: yea, and advantage too, if any
thing may be gotten by them. He that does thus, usually traduceth others first
unto thee, especially if he discern that thou love them not, and love to
hear tales of others. But, he that makes bold with other men's names unto thee,
will deal thee the same measure when he is with others. And he that
prostituteth all his other friends to thy scorn, that he may flatter and please
thee, will put thee in the same number and condition, to gratify another. For
he cares for no more but one friend at a time, and that is the party present.

On the contrary, Differ.
the Christian friend concealeth what may tend to reproach or prejudice.

It is not more incident to the talebearer to reveal secrets, then it is
proper to him that is of a faithful spirit, to conceal the matter Prove. 11.13
. He knows his own infirmities, and how ill he should hear in the world, if
others should blazon him, notwithstanding his best care to reform what he can.
Therefore he will not see all, but wink at small faults in his friend, he
pryeth not curiously, nor interprets captiously, all that he cannot but see.
He is content to be ignorant of what he cannot amend in his friend, love makes
him content to be blind in his friends behalf, so long as his friend be not
too much prejudiced by it. He finds that God himself is pleased sometimes to
see no iniquity in Jacob Number. 23.21
, when others endeavor to persuade him to see so much as to make him to fall
out with Israel, even to the cursing of them, to gratify their enemy. No more
will he see evil in his friend, to upbraid him with it, or to expose him to
shame. What he sees, it is to cover and amend it: Not to reproach his friend
but to advise and counsel him better.

When he must speak of it, it is to himself, not unto others; so long at least
as there is any hope that his friend will hear Mat. 18.15
, and hear him so, that he shall not need to call witnesses of the admonition
verse 16
. And if there should be need of publishing it, it shall be to the Church that
may cure him verse 17.
, not to scorners that will harden him. He holds a true glass to his friend,
but draws a curtain before his picture. He makes it one and the same point
of friendship lovingly to reprove a friend to his face, that he may be
benefited, not reproached; and to praise him behind his back, that he may be
encouraged, not puffed up.

And even when he has no longer need of his friend; nay, when there is no
longer friendship, nor his friend himself no longer living to take offense; yet
then he throws not off his friend as cast-rags to the dunghill, but so does he
honor the memory and Sepulcher of his old friendship, that what was good in
his friend, he is careful to publish it for imitation, and is ashamed to
discover the nakedness of him that was once his friend, although perhaps too
guilty of too much evil.

Thus, this hypocrite deals by his friends shame, as Cham by his fathers
nakedness, to laugh at it, and to make sport with it Genesis 9.22
; the true Christian is as Shem and Japhet taking a garment on their shoulders,
and covering it, going backwards that they might not see it verse 23.
; the one for a while concealeth the errors of his friend, for his own greater
advantage, by the others going on in wickedness; the other concealeth it from
others, that he may express more love to his friend in taking notice of it
only to himself, that he may repent and amend; the one discovers the faults
of his friend, to shame him, the other concealeth them so long as he may, that
he may c^ver shame.

This Hypocrite chooses for friends those whom he can soonest draw to his

Whom he can best make a booty of, him he courteth, and plies with more shows
of friendship then he does others that may be far beyond him for parts, power,
and estate, but not so maleable by his tools, as he whom he chooses for his
friend. The most ducible and gentle disposition is fittest for his purpose,
because most easy to be drawn by his flatteries.

He must not have too much in-sight, foresight, judgment, constancy in him,
with whom this man joins in amity, for such a man skareth away both flatterers
and them that love to be flattered, unless he be withal so facile, or at
least so self-ended, that he may be made a knave at pleasure. This made Caesar
and Pompey, although of contrary factions, unwilling to strike in cordially
with Cato, who was too wise and too austere to serve the lusts of either; such
is the unhappiness of weak minds and variable dispositions (which ever go
together) as not to endure downright plain dealing, until they be so far
deluded as to be destroyed, ere they discern the danger.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian chooses (so near as he can) for his friend,
the most stayed and judicious.

He may be deceived in his judgment, but his choice shall follow the best
judgment he has upon the strictest enquiry. He would have him stayed, not
fickle; judicious, not self-conceited; grave, not austere; because he finds
too much austerity an enemy to society; therefore, to friendship, which without
sociablenesse is a pain, not a pleasure; a vexation, not a commodity. In some
cases he will deal with his friend as the nurse in playing with her child;
being, and doing any thing to content him at present; yet, with intent, by
degrees to weane him from his childishness.

The Christian therefore lays two things in the balance at once; austerity in
the one scale, and lightness or facility in the other; but finding both too
light, pitcheth upon a mean between them, wherein virtue consists. Austerity
he finds to be a churl to friendship; and, lightness or unstayednesse an
enemy to virtue, which of the two, to a good man is most distastful. Therefore
his choice runs upon gravity without austerity; wisdom, without
self-conceitednesse; constancy, without unsettlednesse; affability, without
lightness; sociablenesse, without vanity; faithfulness, without hypocrisy.
And at length pitcheth upon this above all the rest, Let him love me less, so
he love God more

Thus, this hypocrite is like worms that grow soonest in sweetest woods; the
true Christian is like the choicest flowers that delight to be only in the best
manured gardens; the one loves to be fishing where most will bite at his bait;
the other, where only such take the hook, as are best worth the taking.

This hypocrite soon changes his old friend for a new.

He likes no man longer than he is for his turn. If a new friend be better for
his use, he knows how to be rid of the old. He is for a market, not for keeping
any commodity longer, then till he can make most of it. Most men commend houses
and garments; so does he friends, for the newness, and fashion. He is as much
ashamed to be seen with his fathers friend, if out of date; as, to be seen in
his fathers clothes. Every new thing pleases vain minds to whom nothing is
welcome, but that which is new come; and if the old substance remain, yet it
must be put into the new fashion. So must his friends, if they will have the
continuance of his friendship. He being vain and various himself, expects that
his friends should not be as pillars, while himself is a weathercock. If the
wind turn with him, and force him from his former resolutions and courses,
his friend must turn too, or be turned out of doors. If Hushai's counsel suit
better with Absaloms design, than Ahitophels, Ahitophel may go hang himself
when he pleases: Now, Hushai is the better friend. If Hushai's counsel do not
take effect, he and Ahitophel may hang together. Absalom must betake him to new
counsels, to new friends.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian makes most of old friends.

He makes reckoning of all friends, but sets highest price on the oldest. He
knows whose counsel that is; Thine own friend, and thy fathers friend forsake
not Prove. 27.10
. He chooses friends, as men choose wine, by age and continuance Luke 5.39
. If he be forced to cast off an old friend, it is because his friend has
first cast off friendship, as David cast off a Ahitophel, either willingly,
when he proved unworthy, and turned rebel; or, unwillingly, because the other
would be held on no longer. No man can hold that which will not stay. But,
whether willingly, or unwillingly, he does it not out of lightness of
disposition.

Friendship is not a Covenant for a time, but a league for ever, between those
that are good. He therefore parts with his friend as with his blood, which he
never lets out but in extreme necessity. And his friend is rather rent, then
ripped from him. Their parting is rather a violence offered by the other, then a
surcease of affection in him. He mourns after him, when he has lost him, as a
man mourns for his son that is dead; and is more afraid, then desirous of a
new friend in room of the old, lest the new prove worse then the old. He likes
nothing new, but the new creature, and that is most welcome in an old friend of
whom he has most experience.

Thus, this hypocrites friendship is as the sowing of two pieces of cloth
together, which, if the thread of profit, or other interest fails, the pieces
fall asunder of themselves: but the true Christian is as cloth torn asunder,
when he is deprived of his friend against his will: the one is fickle, and
therefore affects variety; the other is stable, and therefore desires
perpetuity: the one is for a new friend, being yet to begin friendship; the
other is settled in that course already, and therefore loves the old.

CHAP. XXVI. The Repenting Hypocrite, Is he that repents, but not with
repentance unto life. Defin.
Acts 11.18

Sin is sometimes sick in him, but never dies. He is always (by his own
telling) repenting, but never amendeth. He rather intends, than does the
work; as the fool that always begins to live, but never lives the life of
reason. He sometimes tameth sin, and makes it come to hand, when, and as he
pleases: but never dispatcheth it outright. The devil is more afraid then
hurt by his sickness. Some concussion or shaking there may be in the heart of
this counterfeit, but he soon pitcheth again in the same, or in a greater
sin; and that, in a deeper degree. He is as a tree shaken with the wind,
that falls not; but roots it self the deeper. A vessel of wine is troubled by
being removed, yet the lees continuing, it retains its former savor. So is
it with this hypocrite: He is as Moab, settled on his lees, and not emptied
from vessel to vessel, -- therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent
is not changed Jer. 48.11
. Yea, he feeds himself in sin when he seems to disgorge it, and feeds
his sin by his very repentance. He is moved, but not removed; sick of sin,
but not dying unto sin, and therefore cannot live unto God. He repents as
Pharaoh, Judas, Ahab, and diverse others have done, that ended their repentance
in hell.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian repents unto salvation not to be repented of 2 Cor. 7.10
.

Sin, in him, is sick unto death. He has the spirit of repentance, that will
by degrees eat out the life of the flesh, it will cast out the bondwoman and
her son, never to return. He has a spirit in him that will never make a
League with the Canaanites or Philistines, although he cannot wholly root them
out, he will do his best to drive them out, as knowing that those which remain
will be pricks in his eyes, and thorns in his sides to vex him Numb. 33.55
. He will vex these Mideanites, and smite them who vex him with their wiles
Number. 25.17.18
. He has a spirit lusting against the flesh, as well as flesh lusting against
that spirit Gal. 5.17
.

There are two words in the Scripture used to signify repentance; (...),
importing sorrow for some fault committed; and (...), after-wit, making a man
to grow wiser. These, if joined, cause repentance, and do good: but if severed
they be like Castor and Pollux divided, ominous and fatal. For (...), post
fuctum dolere, to grieve after the fact committed, if alone, is no more then
Judas did, it may make a man sadder, but not better; and (...), post factum
sapere, after the fault to grow wiser, and to learn wisdom by his error;
this, separated from the former, takes too large a stride, and goes not to
Christ by weeping cross, whereby a Christian is made sorry after a godly
manner 2 Cor. 7.9
, which is a necessary ingredient in that repentance which is unto salvation
Verse 10
. The first takes away security, and implies perturbation; therefore is so
necessary to repentance, that it is sometimes put for repentance Matthew. 21.29
, being indeed a preparative rather then a part, or performance of it. The
other takes away error, and sets a man in his right course or mind; as the
Prodigal is said to return to himself Luke 15.17
: mentem suam quasi ab insania recipit, he recovered back his mind from his
former madness, says Lactantius.

(...), or after-wit, goes further than (...), or after-grief. As, of beasts
falling into the snares of the hunter, all are grieved, some are killed, and
others escape and grow wiser: so stands the difference between the wicked and
the godly; the hypocrite and the true Christian, in repenting. All see their
danger, but only the children of God escape it. To these belongs not only
(...), after-grief, but also (...), a repentance for which a man shall never
have cause to be troubled 2 Cor. 7.10
. All sinners, early or late, shall (...) undergo grief good store; yea, all
hypocrites shall wish they had never been born, for they shall mourn in their
latter end, when they perceive the wages of sin to be death. But they shall
never (...), grow wiser unto life, this is proper only to the Elect.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a man that is sick at sea by the tossing of the
ship and rolling of the waves; the true Christian is heart-sick of sin, and
never recovereth till he be quite dead unto sin: the one is like a man always
on horseback, but never riding; always making shows of repentance, but never
repenting; the other is as the Sun in the firmament, always moving till he
has run his race, always repenting till he come to heaven.

The Characters of this hypocrite are many: some that respect the parts of
repentance, some the grounds, 1. Touching the Parts.
some the object, some the extent and measure, some the time, and some the end.

This Hypocrite makes a false enumeration of the Parts of Repentance.

He that builds upon a false foundation, must needs err throughout, and lose
all his cost. So does this hypocrite, if leavened with that doctrine which
makes repentance to consist only in contrition, confession, and satisfaction;
by contrition, understanding the humbling of the heart, in room whereof
attrition, whereby the heart for the time being is cast down with the fear of
hell and damnation, is thought to be enough. By Confession, he understands a
particular enumeration of all sins in the ears of a Priest: By satisfaction,
a valuable recompense made to the justice of God for the offense of sin. But
in all this there is a double hypocrisy and delusion.

One, in requiring no more in saving repentance then what may and has been
done by a reprobate. Judas showed all these: Contrition or attrition at least,
being so much affected and dejected for betraying innocent blood, that he could
not but confess his offense to those very Priests that had corrupted him to do
it, and made satisfaction too, for he brought the whole money back unto them,
and threw it at their feet, when they refused otherwise to receive it.

The other error or hypocrisy is, in mistaking the very things which he
confesses to be requisite unto Repentance. For, his contrition is only legal,
without faith apprehending mercy and pardon. His confession required is only
unto man, which of necessity is no where enjoined to be made to man (especially
if the sins be secret, as for the most part, this hypocrites are) but unto God,
where his name and Gospel are not openly violated and blasphemed. And, his
satisfaction must be supposed to be made unto God, which is impossible; whereas
the satisfaction that God requires us to make in person, is only to man whom we
have wronged. In this last lies the greatest part of Popish repentance, in
which, if satisfaction be made, by giving some large gobbet to some Covent or
Religious House, (as they style their Cages of unclean birds) or to the Church,
(which they call satisfaction made to God) this is enough to expiate the sins
of the penitentiary, even in the Court of Gods Justice; although the parties
wronged and oppressed by him (whereby he is enabled to give this great gift) be
not at all satisfied or considered. Yea, this satisfaction, if made by a Son, a
Grandchilde, Nephew, any body, in behalf of any sinner deceased, is held enough
to redeem his soul out of Purgatory, who has layen there long, and died
without such repentance, having wherewithal so to satisfy.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true penitent compriseth in his repentance whatever belongs to a
thorough change of heart and life from evil to good.

He looks upon sin as a forsaking of the Creator for the service of the
creature, yea, of base lusts as bad as the devil; therefore his repentance
consists of an aversion from evil, and conversion to God. He puts off the
old man by mortification, and puts on the new man by vivification; in which
he finds faith in the first place to be most requisite, as the fountain of
true Evangelical repentance, because he well understands, that by faith God
himself purifieth the heart. And as for Contrition, Confession, and
Satisfaction; although in the Romish sense, (wherein they are made a mere trade
to get money) he cannot allow them; yet, in a true sense he admits them not
as proper parts; yet sometimes as Symptoms, sometimes as Instruments,
sometimes as Concomitants, sometimes as Effects of the grace of Repentance in
Gods children.

There is a Contrition which he acknowledges to be the temper of a truly
penitent heart, calcined by the fire of the Word Jer. 23.29
, broken to shivers, and beaten to powder by the Pestle of the Law Psalm. 51.17
, and mixed with the waters of Shiloah that go softly Isa 8.6
, to wit, the sweet streams of the Gospel, now, no longer an heart of stone, or
of bone, but an heart of flesh Ezekiel. 36.26
, trembling at Gods Word Isa. 66.5
, and as it were of dough, fit to be molded Romans 6.17
; and to receive the sacred stamp of Gods Image, in holiness. This while he
acknowledges, he does not allow every kind of concussion to be a kind of
penitential Contrition.

Confession unto God he acknowledges to be a duty to God Psalm. 32.5
, as against whom alone every sin, as sin, is committed. He yields that man
may be injured and offended by the circumstances and consequents of sin; but
the sin it self, as a breach of the Law is an offense against the Lawgiver
Psalm. 51.4
. Therefore he subscribeth to that truth, that whosoever hides his sin from
God shall not prosper Prove. 28.13
. He desires therefore not to run into Adams fault; but, with Job, appeals; If
I have hid my sin as Adam Job 31.33
etc. As for men, he grants and makes confession also unto them, when the
offense being public, or publicly known Psalm. 51 tit.
, the Church, offended thereby, may be satisfied by the self-shaming
acknowledgement of Confession, especially when the Church her self enjoyneth it
2 Cor. 2.6
. Yea, and in case of private wrong, not otherwise to be righted, as in the
case of defamation, he makes confession unto man. And, in the weakness of a
laboring conscience, which requires the assistance of an able and faithful
Minister, or Brother, he ingenuously confesses, perhaps a secret sin Jam. 5.16
, that where he has fallen, the other may raise him up again, and restore him
with the spirit of meekness Gal. 6.1
. But where by the strength of grace recovered, he is able to make his peace
with God, without such particular confession, which might redound more to the
dishonor of the Gospel, and to the dissatisfaction of the party wronged, then
satisfaction (as in the case of any secret sin, truly repented of) and prove
dangerous to the party confessing and repenting; there the Minister may safely
and warrantably pronounce Absolution, where he sees the true tokens of
repentance, without the particular knowledge of every sin committed.

As for Satisfaction, wherein he has offended God, he casts himself upon the
satisfaction made by Christ: but, wherein he has offended man, he
acknowledges it to be his duty, and makes it his endeavor to give
satisfaction. If he has falsely accused any man, and thereby pilled him, he
makes restitution Luke 19.8
. If he has weakened or scandalized the Church, he endeavors satisfaction by
his earnest prayer, that she may be healed by his exemplary repentance, of that
wound she received by his fall Psalm. 51.18
. If he has been a persecutor of the Gospel, he makes satisfaction by
preaching that faith which once he destroyed Gal. 1.23
. If he has drawn any into error and idolatry, he endeavors satisfaction to
the Church, by using his authority to reduce those whom he led astray, and to
countenance and maintain the truth and true Worship of God 2 Chro. 33.16
. Thus he makes a public Profession of repentance in the open view of the
Church, as to any scandal given, (not expecting Indulgences or Discharges from
those satisfactions) as in the purest times of the Primitive Church was
enjoined, but not as a payment to Gods Justice, which he cannot hope to
accomplish, but must leave only to him alone, who has borne our sins, in his
own body on the tree 1 Pet. 2.24
, and has borne our griefs also Isa. 53.4
.

He is too humble to imagine that either of himself, or by any obligation laid
upon God by the good use of his own free will, God is bound to enable nature
without grace, to dispose it self unto grace; for he freely acknowledges, not
only Evangelical repentance; but, all motions toward it to be only of God. As
for Attrition, the fruit of legal terrors; and the spirit of bondage, in a
natural conscience, he looks upon it in it self, as a step downwards toward
Hell, as in the example of Judas, rather then upwards, toward Heaven: unless
where God himself makes the way of Hell the rode to Heaven. He prays for the
grace of repentance Lam. 5.21
, but looks not upon it as a Well rising up of it self in his ground, that he
should say unto it, Spring up O Well Number. 21.17
. It is (...) or (...), a Jove delapsus, a grace that comes from Heaven; not as
a supposed Image from Jupiter Acts 19.35
, but as a shower of grace poured out upon the Church from God Zech. 12.10
, as the Father of light Jam. 1.17
, and life. His heart is not, as Egypt, watered with the foot of man; but, as
Canaan, with the dew of Heaven.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Janus, feigned by man, to look as far backward and
forward as he needs, but does neither. He is as Nero, who shut up the doors
of the Temple of Janus, tanquam nullo residuo bello Sueton. in Neron. c. 13.
, as if no relics of war remained behind, when yet the Empire was at Civil
war within it self, and he still at war with God: The true Christian is as
Noah, the true Janus, looking both to the old world, as taking leave of it for
ever; and, to the New, as resolving to stick only to that. For so repentance
looks back to the former life which has been evil, and is therefore called
repentance from dead works Heb. 6.1
; and, forwards unto God and new obedience, and is therefore styled repentance
toward God Acts 20.21
. In the hypocrites penance, his contrition has respect to Hell and the Devil;
his confession to man; and his satisfaction to God. But in the true Christians
repentance, his Contrition proceeds to the mortification of his sin; his
Confession is made unto God; and his Satisfaction to man; and so he truly
repents.

This hypocrite is loath to see too much evil in himself.

Sight of sin.
In turning away from sin, a true Penitent first makes discovery of his sin, and
then discomfits it. To the first, belongs a sight, and hatred of sin, then
sorrow, and lastly, shame for sin. This hypocrite fails in them all, as by the
several Characters following will appear, both in the discovery of sin, as well
as in the discomfiture of it.

Touching the sight of sin. He rather chooses to see sin in others, then in
himself; or, to content himself with generals, and to acknowledge that we are
all sinners; and likes better to repent in gross, then to go to it by retail.
To view his special sins would be too troublesome, and make him too much out of
love with himself, which of all things the hypocrite can least endure. He is
content to look what good wares he has in his shop; and there, with the
Pharisee Luke 18.
, he will be as particular as he can, even unto false boasting; he will tell a
fair tale for himself, how just, chaste, devout, conscientious in tything,
etc. he is. But he is loath to look in his Shop-book to take notice of the debts
he owes. And so concludes, with him in the Comedy, Dives sum, si non reddo
quae debeo, I am a rich man, if I can shift off paying my debts; The hypocrite
confesses, I am in debt, somewhat behind hand; and who is not? But he means
to take day, and hopes to get it: he is still for modo, modo, anon, anon, until
his delays exceed omnem modum, Bern.
all reason and conscience.

Therefore he hates both Minister and Ministry, that is too busy in turning
over his debt-book, or calling too hastily to make satisfaction; he cannot
endure him that is daily bringing in new bills, and calling for payment. He is
as a man that has an ill face, that would not be known. He is content to look
upon his shadow, but loath to view himself in a clear and true glass. He likes
not that you should draw his picture, but he is content to give you one of his
own drawing. He commends that preaching that makes all men look of the same hue
and fashion, although perhaps it be unpleasing and uncomfortable enough: that
speaks against sin in the general, and against the devil in particular, but
not against pride, covetousness, drunkenness, uncleanness, if he be guilty:
nor putting his finger in his sore, and teaching him to repent of his
wickedness in particular, telling him, thou art the man 2 Samuel 12.7
.

If he must needs look into his own sins, it is but a confused sight he takes
of them; he will not pore too much or too long on such an unpleasing object, in
relation to repenting of them. It may fall out that he may be troubled in
conscience, and possessed with some melancholy fit or fright, which may force
him to a dull and sudden glance of his eye upon his sin, seeing his sins, as
the man that saw men like trees Mar. 8.24
. Or, he may be troubled with some sins which are indeed no sins, neglecting
true and proper sins; making great show of looking earnestly and sadly upon sin
where there is no cause, and over-looking that which is true cause of trouble;
as he that vieweth himself in a troubled water, may conceive he has a wry
mouth, at which he is troubled; but never looks at the spots in his face, for
which he has more cause of trouble; he hardly espieth a scarre, a true blemish
or wrinkle, of which his face is full. He loves not to be too plainly dealt
with, or to have his sins made too plain and palpable. He will take a cursory
view of his sins, and accordingly performs a cursory repentance, whereupon he
demands a pardon of course; being contented with any comfort, although not
applied to the purpose.

On the contrary, Differ.
The true Christian desires to have a full sight of his own deformities,
distinctly; especially of that sin wherein he has most offended.

The better any man's estate is, the more he desires to know the most of his
debts, and the worst of his case, that he may accordingly apply himself to get
out of it. And the better any Christian is, the more he desires to know the
worst of himself. He knows his transgression, and his sin is ever before him
Psalm. 51.3
. And if he does not know them fully, he cries out unto God, How many are mine
iniquities and sins, make me to know My transgression, and My sin Job 13.23
. He looks also into the pure mirror of the perfect Law of Liberty, that
will be sure to show him all his spots. He loves to make a strict account, and
to see how much he is worse then naught, that he may the better understand how
much he is beholding to his Surety, by whose gracious interposition, and
meritorious passion, he is sure not to suffer, nor God to be a loser by him. He
desires to see, and know himself, not only as other men do, but as the Angels;
yea, as God Himself beholds him; that, wherein he cannot approve his ways, he
may by repentance humble himself unto God.

He is far from the bankrupts humor, that cannot endure to look narrowly and
particularly into his estate; but, rather goes beyond all others in casting up
of his debts, as knowing he has one Creditor that will not be fob'd, by
concealing or denying the debt. He not only particularly enumerates his sins,
but singles out his special sin from the rest, and pursues that most eagerly
beyond all the rest. I have done this evil in thy sight Psalm. 51.4
. And at length he comes to the very core, Deliver me from blood-guiltinesse, O
God Ver. 14.
. His repentance points at the very boil and sorest part of the special sin;
not omitting others, but insisting chiefly on this? as those Israelites, making
confession to Samuel of their folly in desiring of Saul, we have added unto all
our sins, this evil, to ask us a King 1 Samuel 12.19
.

Thus this hypocrite in respect of his beloved sin, is as loath to be known of
it, as Cain was to confess what was become of his brother Genesis 4.9.
; the true Christian is as willing to lay open his bosome-sin, as Shechaniah in
behalf of those Jews who confessed their special wickedness, We have
trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives Ezra 10.2.
. The one favors all sins the more, that he may not come too near to this;
the other loves them the worse, from the true sight he has of his special
sin. He knows the Lion by his paw, and the mischief of sin, by the wounds
that even that sin which he favors most, has given him.

This hypocrite hates sin, not as sin; some sins, but not all; sins, in other
men, not in himself.

He hates sin, Hatred of sin.
not out of goodness, but rather out of indisposition to some particulars.
Some sins are so disagreeable to his nature and temper, as strong drink is to
some complexions, that he cares not much for any sin that the world cries out
upon; as he that hates the Master of a family, can brook none that dwell in it.
He hates sin, as some of a cold complexion, or from some natural infirmity and
imperfection; or, out of scorn, not grace, hate uncleanness of body; and none
so eager as they against those who through frailty fall in that kind: yea, they
are transported against things lawful; as, against marriage, or at least
against second marriage, although allowed by God and by his Virgin-Apostle 1
Cor. 7.39.
So, he hates prodigality, himself being most gripple and tenacious. Or, he
hates covetousness, himself being most prodigal and riotous. Or, he hates
Popery, and the corruptions of that Church, being himself fickle, that cannot
long hold communion with any Church. Or, of all things he hates indiscreet
zeal, because himself is very cold and frozen in the dregs of his sin. In a
word, it is an easy matter to hate that sin securely, which he either feels
not in himself, or fears not an aptness or strength to fall into.

He therefore hates some sins, but not all: he hates what he likes not, or
cannot commit: but not other sins which suit better with him, and for which he
has opportunity. In a general way, he may hate sin, as it is an enemy to
Civil Society, but not upon a spiritual account, as contrary to God; as a moral
Heathen, not as a Citizen in Heaven. He hates sin in the general, not in
particular, at least not in that particular which he should. He hovereth, as
the Swallow that makes many offers, but never lights. And so, while he hates
not all, even the whole body of sin, he hates none at all: yea, he hates none,
because he hates not some, specially; and, all the rest, the worse for that.

He hates sin in other men rather then in himself. He hates them the more in
others, because he favors no man but himself. In his enemy he hates them
most, because under color of zeal against sin, he may revenge his own quarrel
to the utmost. There is an humane, and partial hatred even of sin, yea,
diabolical also: when men are willing to take into other men's dunghils, as glad
to see sin, that they may hate the sinner, not the sin: disgrace the person,
not mourn for the wickedness, and glad to see evil in those whom they would
have a pretense to abhor.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Penitentiary hates all sin, as sin; but most, in
himself; not in general only, but in particular.

He abhors all sin as opposite to Gods Nature, as well as a transgression of
his Law; for Gods sake, more then his own. And to give a certain testimony of
the truth of his repentance, he abhors that sin most, which without grace,
is most agreeable to his constitution and temper, and to which he has most
opportunity. His love to God makes him to look upon all sins, as the greatest
enemies to his honor and service; and, hating himself for sin, he sees such
sins as being the firstborn, and as it were the darlings of his corruption.
Therefore he is more mild to others in those sins whereto he is not tempted
himself, looking on them as more capable of excuse, because they have more
tentation; and, in those whereto he is, or may be tempted, he deals the more
tenderly with others, as being privy to his own frailty. In every sin he is
least favorable to himself.

He has an hard heart of his own to tug withal, and that he feels to his
grief, more then he can the hearts of other men. He therefore spares least,
where he has most toil: and hates most, where he feels most enmity and war
waged against him. How far other men suffer by a secret enemy he knows not.
He therefore is careful not to judge too hardly of them, but rather pitieth and
prays for them the more, by how much he finds the smart and misery of such
enemies in his own bosom. His own sufferings make him the fitter to pity
sufferers. He will not take upon him Gods office in searching the heart,
unless in his own case, where God has made him his deputy. Above all, he is
least inquisitive after the faults of his enemy, that he may not be thought
desirous to see their nakedness where corruption most endangereth him to be
transported, and grace advises him to be moderate. He wishes none so ^ll as
to see them offend God, in hope to draw vengeance thereby upon th^^r own heads;
but mourns for the sins of those that hate both God and him. Gods enemies he
hates Ps. 139.21, 22
; his own he favors, so far as it may stand with fidelity to God, lest he
should seem to turn justice into private revenge; and, to feed malice under
pretense of zeal.

Nor is his hatred only a general rising against sin in the lump, and in
gross: but he directs it against all, by falling upon particulars, that his
hatred may proceed from one sin to another, till he has ma^e it good against
all sin. And when he has gone through all his actual sins, he pursues his
e^emies even into the most in most parts of his soul; and hates original
concupiscence the more and worse, because the mother and fountain of so many
cursed brats within him Psalm. 51.5
. And h hates actual sin the more, because the base offspring of such an
hellish parent: And so he makes his hatred of sin, as God makes his pardon of
sin; First, general, pardoning all sins; then particular, forgiving the special
sin, and applying it to every particular, even to the least, as well as to the
greatest; leaving no sin out in Gods pardon, or in man's hatred, which
proceeds so far as to hate even the garment spotted by the flesh Jude 23.
.

Thus, this hypocrite hates sin, as Judah hated whoredom in Tamar his
daughter-in-law, commanding her to be burnt; but, understanding that himself
was the person by whom she was with child, he soon altered the sentence Genesis
38.24, 25, 26
; the true Christian is as David (knowing his own guilt) that desires Gods hand
may be against him and his fathers house 2 Samuel 24.17
rather then against those who suffered for his off^nce: the one is as the
Presidents and Princes of Darius against Daniel, hunting after any occasion to
accuse and destroy him, but never minded their own offense, in neglect of duty
to God; he uses all means to impeach another, that he himself may vent his
malice against him, rather then to punish him for any wilful neglect: the other
is as the Revengers of Gods children in Babylon, taking their Babylonish brats,
and dashing their brains against the stones Psalm. 137 9.
, not sparing or pitying the least of them all.

This hypocrite makes a show of sorrow; a sour face, without a sad heart; a
slight,

He is as a child that counterfeits a cry, Sorrow for sin.
but laughs when he sees you startled at it: He can disfigure or rough cast
his face at a fast, deluding the world with signs and shows of sorrow, in
stead of real grieving. He can be as loud as Esau, and make as much ado with
his voice and tears, and all to no purpose Genesis 27.38.
. He can put on Ahabs sackcloth 1 King. 21.27
, the Jews ashes, and hang down his head as the bulrush Isa. 58.2.
. He is for a Ceremony or Procession of sorrow (after the popish fashion)
without any substance. He can sooner draw blood from his shoulders, then sorrow
from his heart; he sheddeth tears by artifice, to delude the simple, but
shows no real sorrow acceptable to God. He sorroweth by rule, not at heart.
If he can delude the world with a vain show of sorrow, he desires no more.
Reputation with men, not acceptance with God, is his main design; yea, if he
can thrive better in a contentious way, and give a more through blow to his
enemy, by holding a fast, he will fast for strife and debate, and to smite with
the fist of wickedness Isa. 58.4
; And thinks he never spends a day better, then when he thrives most in a way
of wickedness, after a solemn devotion. He is as devoutly sorrowful as Pope
Boniface the eighth (being himself a Guelfe) was upon an Ash Wednesday Fast;
Platin. in Bon. 8.
who for all his devotions, forgot not his own faction, but took occasion to
put an affront upon the Archbishop of Genoa, (of the contrary faction, a
Gibelline) in stead of strawing ashes on his head, he threw them into his eyes;
and in stead of those words, Remember, O man, that thou art dust, and to dust
thou shall return, inverted the words, and said, Memento, O homo, quia
Gibellinus es, and cum Gibellinis in cinerem reverteris, Remember, O man, that
because thou art a Gibelline, thou shall return to dust with the Gibellines:
and so deprived him of his Archbishopric. And when he howles loudest upon his
bed, he is not heart-sick: at most, his stomach does but wamble a little: a
pang, or qualme comes over his heart: a sigh and away; as David at the news of
Vrijah's death 2 Samuel 11.25
betrayed by himself, when slain by the sword of the children of Ammon Chap.
12.9
. If it come within view of his heart upon some other account, it shall never
lodge there, but rather be kept out, as Adam out of Paradise Gen^ 3.24
, by the flaming sword of lust. He can, if need be, cut and lance himself, as a
Priest of Baal, and yet not truly mourn for his sin.

Contrarily, the true Christians sorrow for sin, is deeply drawn out of the
Well of an humbled heart.

He brings not out a tear, but he dives to the bottom of his heart for it. His
sorrow ascends from his heart to the eye, and from his eye returns to his
heart, as the water of a fountain from the top of the pipes falls back into the
same place whence it sprang up. His sorrow not only rises thence, but settles
there. He cares not for witnesses of his tears, unless where there be
witnesses too many of his offense. Ille dolet vere qui sine test dolet. Sorrow
the more sincere, the more secret. He had rather, with Peter, go out from the
company, and weep in private, then personate a Mourner in their Congregation.
Where the spirit of supplication and mourning is bestowed, not only each
family, but each person mourns apart, not so much as their wives in company
with them. He sees him that is invisible, and knows that the invisible God
sees him and puts all his tears into his bottle Zech. 12.12
, which to him is enough.

And the more private his sorrow, the deeper it is. Sometimes it is like the
mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon Psalm. 56.8
, the place where Josiah was slain, for whose death the people made public and
bitter lamentations; sometimes even in private, he makes his bed to swim in
the night 2 Chro. 35.25
; and even in the day, he waters his couch with his tears. Not that a
Christian repenting, does always necessarily weep: some are naturally so
dry-eyed that they cannot shed a tear, even to save their lives. Therefore not
the tears, but the heart affected, as steeped in tears, is to be heeded.
Sorrow for sin lies more at the heart, then in the eye. Yea, sometimes he is so
overwhelmed with grief, that he cannot weep, as a vessel without vent cannot
run, yet give a little air of comfort, and then both heart and eyes will melt,
and be dissolved.

Possibly he may (which is his trouble) mourn more feelingly for outward losses
and crosses then for sin; because, in worldly grief he has the help of nature
and affections near at hand, even while nature is an enemy to godly sorrow; yet
he sorroweth not more truly, deeply, or resolvedly. And the measure of sorrow
is to be taken by the understanding and judgment, not by sense: by will, not
by affection. Sorrow is a great part of this Christians sacrifice which must be
rational, or reasonable Romans 12.1
. We see a wise man to sorrow more feelingly for the loss of an horse, an hawk,
a dog, or some matter of pleasure, then of an adventure by sea, or of a suit at
Law of far greater importance; yet, in his judgment, he esteems the latter a
far greater loss; which he would much rather have escaped. So is it here.
David mourned more feelingly for Absalom the son of his delight, then for
Vrijah the subject of his sin. And who would equal childrens tears to the
sorrows of men, yet those are more feeling and affectionate then these. The
Christian mourns more understandingly and solidly, with more intention of
heart, although not so sensibly in affection. He esteems the Praemunire, or
out-lawry of Gods displeasure, to be more bitter then all miseries of life:
yea, he accounts himself to be thereby in a worse case, (till God speak
peace) then to be unborn, therefore sorrow for sin makes a deeper wound
inwardly, then that which bleeds more outwardly.

Thus this hypocrites tears are like the harlots smiles or flatteries; (only
with this difference, that she has to do with a fool that is willingly
beguiled by her, the hypocrite has to do with a God that will not be deluded
by him:) the true Christians sorrow is like Israel truly repenting, when they
drew water, and poured it out before the Lord 1 Samuel 6.6
, as lamenting after him Ver. 3
. The one is as the woman of Tekoah, feigning her self to be a mourner, that
had a long time mourned for the dead 2 Samuel 14.2
, the other is as Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be
comforted: not, because these children of the flesh are not; but because they
are.

This hypocrites sorrow for sin is but momentany, wherein he is a mere Patient
against

He hangs down his head for a day, like a bulrush Isa. 58.5
, which, while the wind blows, bends downward, but the wind no sooner
cease, but it perketh up again; so that an oak is sooner broken, or turned up
by the wind, then a rush. Such is this pliant hypocrite: his sorrow, like that
of Pharaoh, was a short qualm, or fit like a sea-sicknesse, soon over; if he
once but smell land he recovereth. It is but febris Ephemera, an Ague that gives
one fit, and away; as the qualm that came upon Felix Acts 24.25
, which ended with Paul's turning his back. The next news we hear of Felix was,
his dismission from the Government, and his leaving of Paul bound, merely to do
the Jews a pleasure, as he pretended Ver. 27
: although the true reason was that Paul gave not a bribe to be released, as
Felix hoped, but Paul neglected Ver. 26
: which shows the short continuance of Felix his sorrow.

And no marvel; for the hypocrite in his sorrow is a mere Patient: as a man
that is sick against his will; or melancholy, and cannot help it. If he sorrow
feelingly it is unwillingly. He would fain laugh as others do: or sleep, or
drink it out. He wishes for his former joy and security; In a word, he is
sorry that he sorroweth.

On the contrary, The Christians sorrow for sin is perpetual, Differ.
and willingly undergone.

He is always renewing his repentance, and has an eye to his own
unworthiness, as David, even after God by his Prophet had pronounced
Absolution upon his Confession; the Lord has put away thy sin, thou shall not
die 2 Samuel 12.13
. He remembers, and is confounded, etc. even when the Lord is pacified toward
him Ezekiel. 16, 63
. Every new benefit puts him on upon further humiliation. He is well content
the world should now be to him a vale of tears: and it is enough to him that God
puts them into his bottle Psalm. 56.8
. The day is not yet come wherein they shall be quite wiped from his eyes Rev.
7.17
. He is ever sighing for what he would have in reference to a total and
absolute riddance of all sin; and, burdened with that which of all other things
in the world he would be freed from Romans 7.24
.

In sorrow for sin, he is a willing Agent as well as a Patient. He willingly
takes this physic of godly sorrow for the disease of sin, and is well content
that in the working it should make him more sick, and that he should find more
trouble in repenting, then ever he found pleasure in sinning, that so he may be
more soundly healed, he readily takes the bitter pills of the terrors of the
Law for physic: and does all he can to make them work. He stirs up sorrow in
himself, and is content to be afflicted, and to mourn, and weep Jam. 4.^
: hoping his sorrow may awaken him out of the sleep of security.

He is a man of thoughts, and takes many things to heart, upon this very
occasion. He sorroweth as a godly Statesman, that others are so evil Ezekiel. 9.4
; and, as a Christian, that himself is no better; he seeks causes of sorrow
without him, that every thing may help forward his sorrow within him, and his
sorrow becomes him. He is not as children that laugh and cry in one breath. He
offers his sorrow as a sacrifice to God Psalm. 51.17
, and that with a willing heart, as he would that God should give him joy. He
knows God delights to hear a sinner lamenting Jer. 31.18
, as that which makes a penitent capable of hearing from God the voice of joy
and gladness.

And, whereas the wicked would be rid of his sorrow, because he sees no good
coming toward him by it, the true Christian expects the blessing of joy upon
the sacrifice of his mourning; and would be loath to part with his sorrow, and
to be as he was before, until he see some fruit of it. He sows in tears, that
he may reap in joy Psalm. 126.5
, and is content with the husband to wait long for this precious fruit Jam. 5.7
. As a woman in travel comfort her self in hope of a child in some short
time; so he is comforted, not only in his sorrow, but from his sorrow, from
whence he is assured to reap the quiet fruit of righteousness Heb. 12.11
, although he cannot through the weight of affliction at all times express
this hope: and he is ready to call it Joseph, because upon the like hope he
would be in the like case again Genesis 30.24
.

Thus this hypocrites sorrow is like a boil, soon dried up and gone: the true
Christians sorrow is like an issue that sometimes continues to the grave; the
sorrow of the one is as the sorrow of Gods enemies, the Curse of God upon him
Lam. 3.65
, the sorrow of the other is the grace of God in him, and a prognostication of
much spiritual peace unto him.

This hypocrites sorrow begins in joy.

He observes not the Papists method, Mar. 1.15
to repent first, and then to believe the Gospel, with application to himself.
He likes not to sow first in tears, he would rather be reaping of joy, without
such sowing. He closes with the glad tidings of the Gospel, at the first news
of it, before he prepare himself to be capable of them. He thinks repentance to
be a legal whipping-post, unworthy of the Gospel, although first called upon
and inculcated by him that first preached the Gospel. Ib. and Mat. 3.8.
He is as the stony ground; although he has a stony heart, yet he receives the
Word with joy, as a man of large affections Luke 8.13
. He joyneth with it at first hearing of it; for novelty, not in sincerity. But
that joy ends in heaviness Prove. 14.13
; for, when he should rejoice, as, on his deathbed, or, in affliction and
tribulation Romans 5.3
, then woe and sorrow self on him, and pour out his very gall upon the
ground; the very terrors of God before neglected and kept off, run upon him
like a Giant. And so his joy that was not laid in the foundation of sorrow,
ends in offense, and despair Mat. 13.21
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians joy begins in sorrow.

His joy is first a Benoni, the son of his sorrow, before it be, or can be
called Benjamin, the son of his right hand Genesis 35.18
. His heart is dry and barren naturally, and such a soil is not for joy to
grow in, until it be thoroughly watered, not only by the former rain of godly
sorrow, that is, more legal, upon the apprehension of terrors for sin before
God speak peace; but, also by the latter rain, or second showers that drop
from love upon the apprehension of pardon received Luke 7.38 and v. 42.43
, the more he travelleth with this fruit, the more love he has to it, and
delight in it. He can rejoice in rain, as well, as in the shining of the Sun:
and takes comfort in godly sorrow, as a man does in sure physic, even when it
makes him sickest, because he is assured from Christ himself of the blessing of
joy upon such a watering Mat. 5.4
. He fears not a flood, for it makes his heart the richer soil, not only for
righteousness, but for peace and joy in the Holy Ghost Romans 14.17
. And as his sorrow is lasting, so his joy shall be answerable, not only full
John 16.24
, but everlasting John 16.22
.

Thus this hypocrite is like some young tradesmen, that leap into great estates
left them by their fathers, they begin where their fathers left, and so ere
long they are forced to end where their fathers began, and in much worse
condition; the true Christian is as Jacob going over Jordan with his staff,
and fain to endure much hardship ere he was owner of any thing wherein he might
take comfort: the one is as Judas that was at first taken with Christ and his
Gospel, and undertook to preach it to others, but ended all his preaching in an
halter; the other is as the woman taken in adultery, and brought unto Christ,
that he might condemn her; where for a while she stood weeping, but was after
dismissed with comfort and peace.

This hypocrite sorroweth for himself, not for God.

This hypocrite is in his sorrow, as in all other things, for himself.
Self-love and hypocrisy cannot be severed. We sorrow for nothing but what is
hurtful to that we love. What a man apprehends to be most hurtful to that he
loves best, he is most grieved for, when it lights upon that object of his
love. If it fall any where else, it never troubles him. This hypocrite loving
himself best, and God least, yea, not at all; can never be truly sorrowful for
any thing, but as it falls upon himself. Let God suffer never so much, this
hypocrite is not moved with it. He sorroweth neither with God, nor for God.

He is no friend to God in his sorrowing, nor God to him. He mourns not for
God, neither does God bemoan him. He sorroweth both profanely and desperately.
Profanely, for he runs from God, as Cain, to the land of Nod Genesis 4.16
, as Saul, to the Witch of Endor 1 Samuel 28.6, 7
, as some young Gallants to a popish Priest, and so turn Traitors. He mourns
desperately too, as Judas, that went first to the Priests, and afterward to
the devil, not having the power or grace to seek God and his mercy to prevent
it. He first begins hastily with carnal joy, and therefore is afterward justly
swallowed up of overmuch heaviness and horror. He would not offer unto God an
heart contrite for sin, his spirit must at length lie down in sorrow of heart
as a punishment for sin Luke 16.25
; his faith was of his own making, without repentance, and this ends in a
repentance of his own, without faith.

On the contrary, the Christian sorroweth with respect to God, Differ.
and according unto God.

His sorrow is more for God then for himself, more, for that God is broken by
his whorish heart, that has departed from him Ezekiel. 6.9
: then that God has broken him for that departure. His sorrow also is a godly
sorrow, being made sorry after a godly manner, and thereby it comes to pass
that he receives damage in nothing 2 Cor. 7.9
. A sorrow that works repentance to salvation not to be repented of; not the
sorrow of the world, which works death: A sorrow wrought by God, not by
terrors of the devil; a sorrow that drives him unto God, not from him; that
makes him to lie at Gods feet to do what he will with him; casting himself
wholly on God to heal his broken heart, and to bind up his wounds.

And as he respects God in his sorrow, so the Lord comfort him. His sorrow
therefore is moderated, not in regard of his displeasure against the sin which
he has committed; but in regard of the comforts of the Gospel with which it is
mixed. It makes him so to draw near unto God who has smitten him, that God
thereupon draws near unto him to heal him Jam. 4.8
. And it so humbles him, that God exalts him. The hypocrite and the
Christian may be sick of the same disease, and sore of the same wound, but the
hypocrite has the pangs of conscience without comfort; the disease, without
the remedy; the wound, without the cure; but the true Christian has a merciful
Father, a powerful Physician, that not only shakes, but comfort him; and
heals as well as wounds him Isa. 57.19
.

Thus, this hypocrite is a man wounded in war, which makes him fly so far as
he can from him that fell upon him; the Christian is as he that being lanced by
the Chyrurgion, puts himself further under his hand, to bind up and heal the
wound which he has made: the one when sorrow seiseth on him, is as Nabal,
thunder-smitten, that he dies away like a stone 1 Samuel 25.37
; the other, is as they who were pricked in their hearts, at the preaching of
Peter Acts 2.37
, but never left him, till healed of that wound which his Sermon had made.

This hypocrite sorroweth for sin at random, and so is not softened, nor
humbled, even when his sorrow is greatest.

He sometimes feigneth a sorrow that he might not be thought to come behind
others in repentance. But that makes him never the better penitent, but rather
the worse; because he so much pleases himself with his mock-sorrow, or with
that which is not to the purpose, that he never looks after that which is true,
and necessary. He aims aloof at some petty sins, or such as are common to him
with others: but never comes near to the special and chief cause of
controversy between God and his soul. As the Lapwing cries farthest from his
nest, so he makes most ado and complaint of those things, for which he has
least cause to be troubled; in the mean time suffers a far greater
wickedness to sleep in his bosom, without the least disturbance or notice
taken of it. So that he sets up his sorrow but as a blind, to keep men off
from espying his beloved sin, and from all suspicion of his being guilty of
harboring such a viper.

And whether his sorrow be feigned or true, little or much, he is not softened
or humbled by it, but rather hardened the more. His heart is as an Anvil, or
armor of proof, that is not mollified, but either more hard, or broken to
pieces, never to be capable of setting together again. As Pharaoh by every
plague or hand of God upon him, he becomes more stiff, and unmalleable.
Abigail told Nabal enough to have drawn from him a flood of tears; but his
heart, hardened in wickedness before 1 Samuel 25.3
, was so far from melting, that it died within him, and he became as a stone
Ver. 37
; So does this hypocrite, be his sorrow as great an overflowing flood, as that
of Esau, which filled him with rage and rancour, not as being angry with
himself for selling, and despising his birthright, but with his blessed
brother, and that unto death Genesis 27.34. and ver. 41
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian sorroweth most for his special sin, and is
thereby dissolved, and melted.

He applies the plaster to the right sore, and puts the tent of repentance
in to the true wound. This sorrow he pours out like water, his heart is like
wax, it is melted in the midst of his bowels Psalm. 22.14
. If he hear any sad news of his own heart, upon hearing the words of the Law,
that draws sorrow from him, that sorrow is a softening, melting, dissolving
sorrow. It is with him as with Josiah, whose heart was tender, which caused him
to humble himself before God, when he rent his clothes and wept before him 2
Chro. 34.27
. His heart is made soft by God, when the Almighty troubles him Job 23.16
. Yea, he cannot commit the least sin, when he has greatest security against
being questioned for it, but his heart smites him, as David's heart did him, for
cutting off but a lap or skirt of Saul's garment, when he might as easily have
taken his life 1 Samuel 24.5
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul overcome by David's tenderness in saving his
life when he had it in his power, he lift up his voice and wept 1 Samuel 24.16
, partly through shame for unjust persecuting of David, yet his heart was no
way softened toward him, for he persecuted him still; the other is as David,
whose heart having smitten him for numbering the people 2 Samuel 24.10
, made him presently to dissolve into particular acknowledgement of his sin,
and craving pardon for it; the one, together with his tears, is as Niobe,
congealed into marble; the other dissolved into a fountain of waters; the
sorrow of the one makes him more sinful; the grief of the other makes him more
watchful.

This hypocrite is sometimes brazen-faced, holding forth impudence for
innocence.

Shame for sin.
He can sin boldly, and yet nulla pallescere culpa, never change color for it,
nor be known of it by his countenance. He has a brow of brass, as well as an
heart of Adamant. He has a whores forehead that cannot blush, that refuses to
be ashamed Jer. 3.3
. He forces impudence upon himself, and will rather ravish his heart, then
suffer it to make the least show of guilt in his face. Gebazi himself shall not
go beyond him, in bold telling of, and standing in a broad lie; thy servant
went no whither 2 Kings 5.25
. Such is this hypocrite, when he has once gotten past all shame in sinning.
When he has committed abomination, he is not at all ashamed Jer. 8.12
. The unjust man knows no shame Zeph. 3.5
: He declares his sin as Sodom, he hides it not Isa. 3.9
. The filthy Sodomites that were so impudent in their filthiness that they
proclaimed it in the open streets, at Lots door: yea, and after, for their
attempting it, they were smitten with blindness, they would not give over the
attempt, were never more steeled in wickedness, then this hypocrite, (after he
has been once or twice taken in the manner) in setting a good face as he calls
it, upon the business, so as what he cannot hide or deny, he will outface.
Thus his graceless heart quickly becomes so far past hope and grace, as to be
past all shame, and to prevail with his conscience so far, as both dedolere,
and depudere; to be sorry for his former sorrow for sin; and to be ashamed of
his former shame.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian is truly ashamed of whatever shameful act he commits.

If he be not so ashamed of sin as not to commit it: he is so ingenuously
ashamed of himself afterward, as to shame himself for sin committed. Nothing
puts him to the blush like sin; nor is there any sin at which he blusheth not.
The sins of his youth stick by him, when he comes to riper years, to reflect on
the reproach that the sins of his youth, (when men think sin to be most
excusable) have brought upon him: at this he is ashamed, yea, even confounded,
in the bearing of it Jer. 31.19
. He cares not how much he shames himself, to give glory to God, when he has
dishonored him by sin; So foolish was I, (says he to God.) and ignorant; I
was as a beast before thee Psalm. 73.22
. He remembers Gods Answer to Moses interceding for Miriam, If her father had
but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days Numb. 12.14
? The contrite sinner therefore needs not to be bid to be ashamed and
confounded in himself, when God and his own conscience seem to spit in his face
for not preventing that shame which he must now be contented to lie under. He
will soon cast up his accounts, and find what little fruit he now has in those
things whereof he is ashamed Romans 6.21
, as expecting no better harvest of such a sowing.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the adulterous woman which eats, and wipeth her
mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness Prove. 30.20
; he dares boldly say, he has committed no fault, how faulty soever: the true
Christian, when he has sinned, and others are punished, he will come in, and
take the shame to himself, and say, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
wickedly; but these sheep what have they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, be
against me and my fathers house 2 Samuel 24.17
: the one is professedly impudent, that he may not seem to be guilty, the other
confesses his sin with sorrow and shame, that he may be freed of the guilt of
it.

This hypocrite is sometimes unseasonably, and extremely bashful.

He that can be seemingly sorrowful for a small offense, but not grieve at all
for a greater, which he loves better: can do as much in the point of shame: If
he think, blushing for a small matter, and impudence in a greater, will have
this effect, that he who sees him to blush for a trifle, of which he
confesses himself guilty; and not to change countenance for a greater sin,
which he denies, will conclude him not guilty in the greater; he will blush so
often as he pleases; and yet be never the less impudent in other matters,
which deserve more then a blushing. He will blush, to save his credit in a
greater matter wherein he refuses to blush.

He sometimes also takes up a bashfulnesse that betokens guilt, rather then
ingenuity and innocent shamefastness. An harlot will blush sometimes to hear
of that in others which she has too much mind unto in her self; only she
seems to blush at what others say wantonly, that she may not be thought to be
what indeed she is, that thereby she may be the more solicited to be what she
seems least to affect: She still seems most bashful to grant, what she is most
willing to yield. It is not denied that in some there is a pudor rusticus, a
natural infirmity beyond all reason this way, arising from complexion, or
clownish education, melancholy, or perhaps tentation; but this hypocrite is
troubled with none of these in the bashfulnesse he shows. His shamefastness
is not forced, but affected, not arising from natural modesty, rural education,
freedom from guilt; but from a mere projected policy to cover greater
deformities, the better to hide the guilt of an evil conscience, or, to give
vent to boiling concupiscence, which shows it self in the face, not to shame,
but to gratify some secret lust: and, as it were, to hang out a flag and
ensign to envite and call whatever may tend to the satisfaction of it, wherein
our hypocrites will not sit out.

Differ.
Contrariwise, a true Christian is never ashamed willingly, but where guilt is
the cause.

If natural infirmity cannot be mastered by grace or reason; he bears it as
his burden; does not feed it, to make a gain of it, as his project. The more
innocent, the more bold he is in what becomes innocence. If he be overtaken,
he will shrink, and hide as Adam in Paradise. But so far forth as the Image of
God is restored in him, and he has been bumbled for his error, he recovereth
his original boldness, and so far as he is righteous, he is bold as a Lion
Prove. 28.1.
. Let them be ashamed, says he, but let not me be ashamed Jer. 17.18.
. Here he makes his face strong against their faces, and his forehead strong
against their foreheads; and, as an adamant harder then flint has he made his
forehead; so that he fears them not, nor is dismayed Ezekiel. 3.8, 9.
; when innocence is the ground of confidence and resolution.

If he be taken with the least sin, none shall shame him more then he will
shame himself. But if he be reproached for the Name of Christ, he accounts
himself happy, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon him. And, if
he suffer as a Christian, he will not be ashamed 1 Pet. 4.14
, but glorify God in his behalf Ver. 16
. If his adversary write a book against him, causelessly to calumniate him; he
will surely take it upon his shoulder, and bind it as a crown unto him Job
31.35, 36
. Shall he be ashamed of holy wedlock, because the unholy Pope Siricius has
condemned marriage, as living in the flesh? Shall he blush to do that which God
allows, and man condemns? Nay, his Conclusion is, Let God be true, and
every man a liar Romans 3.4
. He is therefore so far from being ashamed, for holding faith and a good
conscience, that he accounts it his greatest rejoicing, to be counted worthy
to suffer shame for the Name of Christ Acts 5.41
.

Thus, this hypocrite pretends shame to cover his guilt: the true Christian
out-goeth him in shaming himself where he is guilty: the one is shamefaced
where there is need, and shameless where there is most cause of shame; the
other keeps his shame to use it where there is need; but abandoneth shame
where he ought to be without shame: the one is ashamed of Christ and his Word,
more then of denying both, when there is most cause to own them; the other is
as Moses, esteeming the reproach for Christ greater riches then all the
treasures in Egypt Heb. 11.26
, even when he suffers most for them.

This hypocrites shame proceeds from self-love.

He that doteth upon himself, is easily shamed at whatever may lessen his
price. None is so much in love with self as the hypocrite, therefore whatever
blotteth himself, he is ashamed of; not because God is thereby grieved, but
himself dishonored. He is in love with his own credit, which he is loath to
have stained: therefore he makes all to veil to that. If that be empaired,
pudore suffanditur, he is confounded with shame. If he undertake a combat
against the truth, and be worsted, he is more ashamed (as the adversaries of
Christ, put to a nonplus Luke 13.17
,) for the loss of his own reputation, then joyed with finding the truth. The
Ruler of the Synagogue was filled with indignation, to see a cure wrought by
Christ on the Sabbath Day, pretending it to be a breach of the Sabbath; Christ
somewhat sharply reproves him, but truly gives him his due, in calling him
hypocrite; but when he comes to grapple with him, by that invincible argument,
( do not each of you loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him
away to watering; and ought not a daughter of Abraham, bound eighteen years by
Satan, be loosed from this bond, on the Sabbath Day Ver. 15.16
? all his adversaries were ashamed, not that they had opposed Christ and the
truth, but that they were put to shame before the people, who rejoiced for all
the glorious things done by him.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian is ashamed for the filthiness and baseness of his sin.

He is not regardlesse of his own reputation, where he may maintain it without
dishonor to God: but, where his credit and Gods honor come in competition, he
disdaineth the congresse, and will maintain Gods honor even against his own;
for, God is dearer to him then all the world, yea, then his own self. God must
save him, if he be saved at all: therefore he will give God the glory, that he
may be saved, rather then support his own credit in that for which he deserves
to be damned; This he knows to be Gods own prescript to his own people
repenting. He establishes his Covenant with them upon these very terms, that
they may remember and be confounded, and never open their mouth any more
because of their shame, when he is pacified toward them, for all that they
have done Ezekiel. 16.63
.

God is not ashamed of him, when he looks upon him in his Son: but he is
ashamed of himself, when he looks upon what he has done, and is ashamed to
call God Father, till God further encourages him; and ingenuously confesses
that he is no more worthy to be called his son Luke 15.19
. If God will meet him, fall on his neck and kiss him, that is more then he
dares promise, until it be done: and if his father do it, he will then take
courage and comfort; but not before. Until then, although God be pacified
toward him, he is not pacified toward himself; not as taking upon him to be
more just then God; but, more severe, till God speak peace. Wonderful is the
ingenuity of a Saint; he will rather record his own shame, that God may have
honor, then conceal his own sin, to maintain his own credit against God. If
Moses offend through passion and unbelief but once in his life, he will record
it, although to his own shame, that God may not suffer by causing a man of so
great desert as Moses to lose the honor of bringing them into Canaan whom he
led out of Egypt, and from whom he endured so much hardship in the wilderness
Numb. 20.12
. So David Psalm. 51. tit.
, not only repents, but reports his sin to all posterity, that the mercy of
God may be the more exalted in his shame, that put God to the exercise of so
much mercy to save him.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Judah, that when he had met with his match, and
found an harlot, no less cunning then himself was lustful, he was willing to
lose his signet, bracelets and stuff, to prevent shame, but ashamed of the
filthiness of his sin committed with her Genesis 38.23
. The true Christian is as that Noble Persian Gobryas, in pursuit of the Magi,
the arch enemies of his country Herod. in Thalia lib.
, who chose rather to call upon Darius to dispatch him and the Tyrant too, with
whom he was grapling in the dark, then to let the Tyrant live for fear of
hurting Gobryas; he will endure any thing rather then let such an enemy as sin
to draw breath: the one never cares for shame, but to save himself: the other
cares for no shame to himself, so he may uphold the honor of God.

This hypocrite is ashamed only of such sins as men know, and abhor.

He shameth not to do the most shameful things in secret Ephesians. 5.12
. If he can carry it cleanly, no matter how filthy he be. Si non cast, tamen
caute, cunning filthiness is with him as good as chastity. Nay, if he be never
so open in his sin, if that he does be not condemned by his companions and the
times, he never blusheth at it. He is not ashamed of swearing, lying,
flattering, cheating, rotten speech, profaning of the Lords day, or other holy
things, and such like fashionable sins, although never so apparent in him. Yea,
he rather glories in his shame, when he finds the committing of shameful
things is his way to glory with men.

His eye is upon men, and he weighs sin and virtue by the shekel of man,
although he know both would carry other weight by the shekel of the Sanctuary,
which in the general he professes to be tried by; therefore he is more ashamed
of some petty folly that may disparage his education, parts and wit among vain
men, then of lewdness, that may give God cause to discard him. He blusheth
more at weakness before men, then at wickedness before God. He is more
ashamed to be taken in the manner Jer. 2.26
, then to steal; to be poor Luke 16.3
, then dishonest; to be disproved, then to lie; yea, he is rather ashamed of
good then of evil Luke 9.26
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians shame is most with an eye to God.

He looks most at what will shame him most before God: and there he is most
ashamed. His care is to provide for honest things, not only in the sight of the
Lord, but of men 2 Cor. 8.21
, to follow things that are honest, lovely, and of good report among men Phil.
4.8
. But if God and men be not all of a mind, he remembers with whom chiefly he
has to do; and, to whom, to stand and fall. Here he will rather endure shame
from men, by doing what they like not, that he may prevent shame from God, for
doing what he forbids. And if he be overtaken in a fault Gal. 6.1
, for which men perhaps will like him never the worse, but rather the better;
he will bear his shame in the presence of God, for being so bold with his
honor.

He is a true Israelite, partaker of the inward circumcision in the heart and
spirit, and therefore affects the praise not of men, but of God Romans 2.29
. If God praise him, he hardens his face as a flint, against the shame of
men; but if God disallow of his ways, he is ashamed and confounded, although
all the world commend and applaud him. When he has sinned, he stands afar
off from God, as the Publicane Luke 8.13
, as ashamed to lift up so much as his eyes to heaven. Whatsoever is odious to
God, although of good esteem among men, makes him hang the head; if it be but
the wildness, vanities, and follies of youth, these he accounts his
reproach, for which he bears his shame before God Jer. 31.19
, not without indignation, at that, which perhaps other men as vain as himself
commend him for. But if any thing be pleasing to God, let men say what they
will to shame him for it, as making himself vile by it, he will not be afraid
of the flouts of a Michal, or of any others of her temper, but boldly answer, I
will yet be more vile then thus, and be base in mine own sight 2 Samuel 6.22
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Herod, not at all ashamed of persecuting the
Church, even unto blood, if he find that it pleases the people Act. 12 3
; the true Christian is as Ezra, ashamed to require that of the King, which he
knew him not unwilling to grant at the first asking for, if it shall in the
least derogate from the honor of God Ezra 8.22
; the one shunneth whatever may honor God, if it tend to his shame with men,
as loving the praise of men more then the praise of God John 8.43
; the other pursues whatever wicked men desire to shame him for, if it tend to
the glory of God; as loving the praise of God more then the praise of men.

This hypocrite, if he be ashamed of sins in himself, yet not in those that
belong to him.

When he is taken in the manner with idleness, riot, drunkenness,
uncleanness, etc. in himself, happily he may be ashamed, or at least make wise
as if he were; but he counts it no shame, that his servants are rude and
untaught, his children unruly and riotous, his wife profane and wanton, his
people and charge wicked and ignorant. If it be his disgrace, yet he blusheth
not: or if he do, it is for his own disgrace, not for their wickedness. Nay,
rather he upholdeth them in their wickedness, to his greater shame, if not
ruin also, as David did, Adonijah, never displeasing him in the least, nor
saying, why have thou done so? until Adonijah first aspired the throne 1 King.
1.5, 6
, and then attempted his fathers bed, and so perished for his wickedness 1
King. 2.17. etc.
, (a just recompense of Parents cockering their children; and, of children
abusing their Parents indulgence.) But how shall he be accounted a Christian,
or to have a good heart toward God, that can endure his wife, children,
servants, charge, to be as heathens before his face, he never blushing at their
wickedness, nor using means to prevent their miscarriages, or endeavoring
afterward to reclaim and reduce them.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian blusheth for their sins that are about him,
as well as for his own.

He labors what he can to make all his relations that are near unto him, to
be like himself, in godliness. He dwells with his wife according to
knowledge, (as endeavoring to impart unto her the knowledge of God,) giving
honor to her as unto the weaker vessel, (not suffering her to be despised for
her infirmities) as being heirs together of the grace of life 1 Pet. 3.7
. He brings up his children in the fear and nurture of the Lord Ephesians. 6.4.
. He will command his children and his household that they shall keep the way of
the Lord Genesis 18.19
. His eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with
him, and he that walks in a perfect way shall serve him Psalm. 101.6
. He will take heed to himself, and to all the flock, whereof the Lord has
made him Overseer Acts 20.28
. But if after all his care, this will not be, it is his abasement and
humiliation: a foolish wife makes him ashamed, and is as rottenness in his
bones; a wicked child is a dishonor and shame to his father, as Eli's sons to
him. If he be a Minister, and have the charge of a perverse people, he accounts
himself undone, because he dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips
Isa. 6.5
. He expects, yea, suffers abasement and shame, bewailing those that have
sinned, and have not repented 2 Cor. 12.21
. He is ashamed and blusheth to lift up his face unto God, for the wickedness
of the people, as well as for his own iniquity Ezra 9.6
; He accounts their shame his own; and where they take no shame to
themselves, he takes it upon himself on their behalf.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Eli, that honored his sons above God 1 Samuel 2.29
, in not being so far ashamed of their wickedness, which he knew, as when they
made themselves vile, he restrained them not, nor so much as frowned upon them
1 Samuel 3.13
; the true Christian is as Jacob, even confounded for the wickedness of his
two sons, Simeon and Levi, butchering of the Shechemites Genesis 34.30
; the one never blusheth where he can avoid it; the other never avoids blushing
where it is deserved.

This hypocrite is never ashamed, till he can hide his sin no longer.

He seeks rather to hide his shame, then to confess it; his care is more to
put sin behind the door, then to shut it out: to covet it, as Rachel did her
idols Genesis 31.35
, then to part with it. If he can sow a few fig leaves together to cover his
nakedness, this pleases him as much as innocence; and this makes his sin to
cleave the faster to him, and will in the end double his shame; for, he that
covers his sin shall not prosper Prove. 28.13
. Such an one she^^s that he loves the sin, because he shunneth so much the
shame of it; therefore his shame is not a clearing shame, but a shifting shame,
that will in the issue break in upon him to his utter confusion.

He loves as much to put off shame, as to put on sin; to excuse and hide sin as
much as to commit it; like those qui primo peccant, inde purgitant, who first
offend, Plaut.
and then cover it by an excuse. So even Adam dealt at first with God, thinking
to put off his own fault, by laying it to the woman, which short cloak doubled
his sin; as they who think to put off shame for other evils whereof they are
accused, by adding a lie to their former transgressions, which being derected,
makes them more odious and notorious; as Gehazi 2 Kings 5.25
, who thereby drew a garment which he little dreamed of, upon him and his seed
for ever, even the leprosy of Naaman, whom he had abused, and now sought to
cover it with another lie to his Master Ver. 27
.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christians shame drives him to the only true shelter.

He knows that sin hidden is never the farther off, and that the shame will
be doubled in the issue; a shame will follow him for the sin which he hides,
(for, his sin will find him out Number. 32.23
, let him hide himself from it as warily as he can;) and a shame for hiding it
too. He therefore puts off the fig leaves of hypocrisy, by a free
Confession of his sin against himself Psalm. 32.5
, and then God takes off the shame, by covering him with the righteousness of
his Son, applied by faith; that being a garment of Gods own making for our
first Parents, figured by the skins of those beasts wherewith he clothed them
Genesis 3.21
.

He is fully satisfied that none can hide sin from God but God himself, by not
imputing it; nor can any hide his nakedness and shame, but the robes of
Christ's righteousness; nor shelter him from Gods eye and vengeance, but the
skin of that Lamb that was slain from the beginning of the world Rev. 13 8.
. He finds that one way to obtain pardon of sin, is to confess it 1 John 1.9
; and therefore to make it out that he truly repents unto salvation, he does
among other things clear himself of his sin, not by hiding, but by discovering
it; not by pleading for it, but by justifying God in his proceedings against
him, taking to himself the shame, and giving God the glory.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Alexander, who sitting to have his picture drawn,
laid the finger upon the skar in his face, as pointing to that which he would
have to be hidden; the true Christian is as Hezekiah, when he had dealt weakly
in showing all that he had to the Babylonish Ambassadors, sent to congratulate
his recovery; he freely, without mincing or Apology, confessed the whole truth,
that there was not any thing which he had not showed them Isa. 39.4
; the one cares not how shamelessely he hides shame, in hope not to be
shamed; the other sticks not to shame himself to the utmost to him who is able
for his shame to give him double comfort.

This hypocrites shame ends in confusion.

He never takes, nor bears his shame for his sin, willingly even when he
has most shamefully sinned; therefore he is never bettered by it, when it is
inflicted upon him against his will; but either it makes him impudent so long
as God will forbear his execution; or it fills him with so much confusion, that
he apprehends his shame as the greatest punishment that can be laid upon him.
And indeed this will be the end of every hypocrite. He covers himself with
his own confusion, as with a mantle Psalm. 109.29
. He never took shame to himself to give God glory, therefore God turns his
glory into shame, and makes him so to apprehend his shame, as to take comfort
in nothing. God will bring an everlasting reproach upon him and a perpetual
shame that shall not be forgotten Jer. 23.40
. He shall bear his shame here Ezekiel. 16.52
, whether he will or not; and in the world to come, when his body awaketh out
of the dust, he shall awake to shame and everlasting contempt Dan. 12.2
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians shame ends in joy and honor.

At the present, none so much abased; in the issue, none so much exalted: he
ends not in confusion, but in joy unspeakable and full of glory. He is ashamed
to his humiliation, not to his confusion. He is abased, not abashed; confounded
in himself, but not so amazed as to be kept off from seeking covert under the
wings of Christ He is troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed,
but not in despair 2 Cor. 4.8
; cast down, but not without hope; he is as dying, in regard of his own merit;
yet he lives through the merits of Christ; as chastened and not killed 2 Cor.
6.9
, His shame is ingenuous, therefore hopeful; free, therefore fruitful; he
believes, therefore he shall not be ashamed Romans 9.33
. His own heart shames him, therefore God honors him, and keeps him from
that utter ignominy of everlasting shame. He shall not be ashamed nor
confounded world without end Isa. 45.17
. Yea, for his shame, he shall have double; and for confusion, he shall rejoice
in his portion --. Everlasting joy shall be unto him Isa. 61.7
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Tamar, first forced by Amnon; but afterward,
choosing rather to run any hazard, yea, to continue her wickedness with her
incestuous brother, (after she found her self with child,) then to run the
gant-lop of shame among her companions, which after ended in her greater shame
2 Samuel 13
: the true Christian is as those Corinthians, truly humbled, and effectually
shamed, that in all things approved themselves clear of that matter wherein
they had failed 2 Cor. 7.11
; the one, seeking to avoid shame, is overwhelmed with it; the other,
ingenuously taking shame, is blessed by it.

The Discomfiture of sin.
Hitherto the Discovery of sin: the Discomfiture follows; and therein, the
Conflict, Conquest, and Revenge, offer themselves. In the Conflict are
considered the cause of it, the enemies, the field, the weapons, the mind and
purpose of the Combatants. The Conflict is first.

This hypocrite fights against sin, out of fear of mischief to himself.

Every Combitant propounds to himself some cause of his combat; The Conflict.
so does this hypocrite: but such as in the issue will afford no comfort. He
that fights out of fear, little regards any issue at all, in relation to any
good to himself. This hypocrite is afraid; therefore in some sort fights
against sin, to avoid falling into that danger, either of God or man, which he
otherwise apprehends to be inevitable; and so one fear offers violence to
another. He will take up the cudgels, lest God, too strong an enemy, should
destroy him; or man, too near an enemy, should too much reproach him. And so he
fights to avoid shame, but without hope of success. He fights, as Cowards
and Traitors, to avoid Martial Law: refusing to take quarter for fear of a
more tormenting and ignominious death; when he sees there is no remedy, but
either fight, or die; he that loves not fighting, will yet fight rather then
die outright, even when he has little hope to live. Fear is a predominant
passion with a Coward; so is it with a guilty person; it makes him desperate,
that never was valiant; and to fight winking, for fear he should see the
blows that are made at him, remembering the Proverb, What the eye sees not, the
heart rues not.

Contrarily, the true Christian fights against sin out of love to God. Differ.


He will adventure all, because he loves his Captain, and his Cause. God has
loved him, and taken his part against sin and damnation, therefore he also will
be for the Lord, in hatred and enmity against sin. It is the Law of amity to
have common friends and common foes. Gods enemies shall be his, because his are
Gods enemies. Abraham is called the friend of God Jam. 2.23
, not only because God took his part, I will bless them that bless thee, and
curse him that curses thee Genesis 12.3
, but because Abraham took Gods part, even against all the idols of his own
fathers house; getting him out of his country and from his kindred, and from
his own fathers house Ver. 1
; not knowing whither he went, in obedience to Gods call Heb. 11.8
.

The Christian argues thus, has Christ made death his enemy, because it was
mine, and said, O death, I will be thy death Hos. 13.14
? then my Lords enemies must be mine. Yea, if he fell out with his own Sergeant
and Executioner, in my behalf, how much more reason have I to fall out with my
sins, (which are also my greatest enemies as well as his) in his quarrel? It
grieveth him much for the dishonor of the Kingdom and Gospel of Christ, by the
sin and treachery of those who profess themselves subjects thereto. The
goodness of the cause, wherein the Law and honor of God are so much engaged,
does both arm and animate him against sin, the arch-enemy of Christ, although
found in himself.

Thus, this hypocrite has no quarrel to sin, but his apprehension of the
mischief that it is likely to bring upon him; the true Christian pursues sin
with mortal hatred, out of his love to Christ who has put him out of the reach
of mischief by sin; the one fights, because he dares do no other, the other
because he can do no other.

This hypocrite fights against Satan as he is a tormentor.

There are three arch-enemies to be encountered in the spiritual warfare; the
Devil, the World, and the Flesh; every of which the hypocrite opposes, or
seems so to do, but in a wrong manner, and without benefit. The Devil is the
first, because he sins from the beginning 1 John 3.8
; whoever sits out, he makes one, so that he must be opposed, or there can
hardly be a war. But the devil is to be considered as a Temptor unto sin,
and as a Tormentor for sin. This hypocrite is never angry with him for his
tentations, so he might hear no worse news of him afterwar^^, which he fears
more then the tentation.

If it were only matter of sin in difference between him and the devil, the
business would soon be composed, but conscience tells him, that if he follow
the devils counsel, he must expect the devil to be his play master; and that he
is to be his Tormentor, who was first his Temptor; and his wages is no less
then death, and that eternal. Therefore he abhors his malicious cruelty in
tormenting, but not his suggestions. He is more ready to defy and spit at him
for the one, then to resist him in the other. Yea, he is sorry that he cannot
partake with him in sin, and be divided from him in punishment. Here he will
fly from him, as the Exorcists, that would needs take upon them to conjure out
the devil in the Name of Jesus; when they felt his paw in wounding them, they
fled away naked Act. 19.16
, but not before.

Differ.
On the contrary, The true Christian fights against Satan as a Temptor.

He fights against him upon the same quarrel only, thas his Lord General, (...)
Heb. 12.2
Christ himself did before him. Christ fought with him, and overcame him as a
Temptor Mat. 4
, having no cause to fear the least mischief from him as a Tormentor. For he
shall never need to be afraid of the devil as a Tormentor, against whom the
devil has not first prevailed as a Temptor. The Christian therefore has his
eye upon Satan's wiles, devices, methods, stratagems and artifices, whereby he
lies in wait to deceive, more then upon his open violence; not as despising
his violence, but as laboring to prevent it, by not giving way to his
tentations.

He now and then casts fiery darts Ephesians. 6.16
, dreadful tentations in the face of the strongest Christian, as knowing if he
can first wound his face, or throw dust or ashes in his eyes, the Christian
will be less fit and able to manage his weapons against Satan in his assaults
upon other parts: therefore he is careful to be furnished with the shield of
faith, above all, wherewith he may be able to quench all the fiery darts of
that wicked one. But being not ignorant of Satan's devices 2 Cor. 2.11
, he looks upon him as then most dangerous when he is most tame, when he
offers kindness and worldly benefit, and would teach the Christian, not so
much how to be cunning in some secret gross wickedness, as to do some feats
of activity to get himself a name; how to perform duties, after his directions,
not Gods; and how to tempt either the Providence or Patience of God Mat. 4
.

Thus the hypocrite fears, shuns, and opposes Satan as a black devil, dealing
with him as he did by Job, sweeping all that he had; the true Christian fears
him most as a white devil, transforming himself into an Angel of light 2 Cor.
11.14
. If Satan will be a merry devil and make sport, this hypocrite will be glad of
his company, and only s^^^s him when he turns a mad devil; but whether he rage
or laugh Prove. 29.9
, the other knows there is no rest, in having ought to do with him: the one
never opposes h^^ (...) he comes to tear him in pieces; the other keeps him
off when he smiles most upon him.

This hypocrite fights against the world only when it frowneth and crosses
him.

If he has any design to be wealthy or great, and has courted the world, or
otherw^se thinks himself so able and worthy, as to expect the world should
first court him, to raise him according to his expectation, in stead whereof
the world loures or looks doggedly upon him: he then falls into a pet, and
marvellously declaimeth against the ingratitude, hypocrisy, and wickedness of
the world; yea, and writes books and ballads against it: and provideth whips of
scorpions to lash it even unto death, if he could. He knows there be others
that speed as bad in the world as himself, and that he shall very much please
them with his Satyrs; however, he is resolved to please himself in it, how
much soever it displease the world, and rather (as the Proverb is) to lose his
friend then his jest, whatever his babble may cost him to vent it.

His hatred is not against the corruption that is in the world through lust 2
Pet 1.4
, as it militateth against God; but as it crosses himself; not because the
world lies in evil 1 John 5.19
, and so is an enemy to God; but because it is evil to him that never was a
true friend to God; not because it crosses him in sin, as sin (which the world
is seldom guilty of;) but because it will not satisfy his covetous or
ambitious lusts, and give him entertainment in the service of sin. Let it be as
bad as it will, he is not troubled at it, so it be good to him. All his quarrel
(in truth and indeed) is, because it will not be kind to him, although he
conceal this, when he fights against it.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christian renounceth the world as an enemy, when it
fawnes most upon him.

It is impossible to win his love from God unto Gods enemy. But as the love of
the world, in a worldling, banisheth the love of the Father 1 John 2.16
. Such amity with the world being enmity against God Jam. 4.4.
. So in a Christian, the love of God banisheth and puts to flight the love
of the world. Even in regard of the necessities and comforts of life, he uses
this world 1 Cor. 7.31
, to supply his wants, and to support his estate, but dares not set his heart
upon it Psalm. 62.10
, nor so much as to trust it, nor what he has from it 1 Timothy 6.17
.

He looks upon the world at the best, as a reconciled enemy, therefore not to
be relied upon. He knows the world will do nothing for him further then he
will comply with it. If he thwart it after it has done him any courtesies, woe
unto him; the world will watch a time to be revenged to purpose, and turn a
more bitter enemy then ever before. He will therefore use it, as a man makes
use of a Tradesman that has commodities to sell in the Market, but not as a
friend whom he desires to take into his bosom. He will use it so far forth as
it is serviceable, without prejudice to his fidelity to God; but for the rest
he will hold it as with bit and bridle, lest having the reins of his heart it
turn upon him; or he will keep it at staves end for fear of a Judas his kiss.
For well he knows it to be vain, and therefore not to be esteemed;
treacherous, therefore not to be trusted; evil, through the common abuse,
therefore not to be loved.

Thus, this hypocrite fights against the world, as some Netherlanders were wont
to fight with the Spaniard; when the Spaniard fell upon him in the field, or at
sea, in an hostile way, the Netherlander would strenuously oppose him; but at
another time sell him arms and ammunition, if he brought money in his hand;
the true Christian fights with the world, as Benhadad gave command to his
officers, who told him of the young men that came out of Samaria toward his
Camp, whether they be come out for peace, or for war, take them alive 1 King.
20.18
, the one has no quarrel with the world, but only in behalf of himself; the
other has no quarrel to the world, but only in behalf of God.

This hypocrite in waging war with the flesh, mistaketh his enemy.

The flesh being nearest, is the most dangerous enemy of all; for, in the
flesh, both the world and the devil do continually wage war. These two make
the invasion, but can do no mischief further then they hold correspondence
with, and receive intelligence and assistance from the flesh within. Thence
they get all the advantages which they make use of. Here therefore, both the
hypocrite, and Christian have most to do, as will appear not only in this
Character, but in sundry other following.

And here first, this hypocrite fights with his shadow in stead of the
substance; he sets up a shaw-fowle of his own, and then shoots at it; or
rather, fights with a friend in stead of an enemy: with the substance of his
natural body, in stead of the corrupt qualities of sin in the whole man, which
make up the body of sin within him: for, if he be superstitiously addicted and
ambitious to merit, he thinks there is no other combat with the flesh
required, then to macerate and starve his natural flesh, to wit, his outward
man; or, to wound it by whipping and other unrequired and unwarrantable
hardship, until he has by this show of wisdom and Religion, in the neglecting
Col. 2.23
, and dishonouring of the body, made it unserviceable for God: Whereas God
would have this flesh to be cherished, (and no wise man ever did it otherwise
Ephesians. 5.29.
that in the ways of God it may be used as a free and well-mann'd horse, and
not as a starved and tired jade. So that this hypocrite pleases himself in
this plausible error, and opposes Gods servant, his body, in stead of Gods
enemy, the flesh.

Indeed that creature, the body, is weak unto good, and worthily deserves to
be kept under in subjection 1 Cor. 9.27
, because it is naturally strong unto evil; and if it be always pampered, it
will be as a fed horse neighing after any wickedness; notwithstanding, Est
modus, etc. there is a measure and mean to be observed: and seeing God that
has inflicted this punishment of weakness on the body, is content to bear
with it, this hypocrite has no ground to account it a virtue to deal so hardly
with it

Yea, sometimes this hypocrite mistakes that for flesh, which is rather spirit
then flesh; and fights against God in stead of warring against his enemy. Thus
he opposes true zeal in Gods servants, as frantic madness Jer. 29.26
: He quarrels with truth as if it were error 1 King. 22.24
, yea, blasphemy Mat. 26.65
. He persecuteth diligence in hearing the Word abroad, to avoid soul-starving
at home, as if it were schismatical, if not seditious; the power of godliness,
as puritanism and hypocrisy; in all which he is very fiery in his combats; in
the mean time, he never fights one stroke against true madness in the Prophet,
even when the spiritual man is mad indeed Hos. 9.7
; he never quarrels with Popery, Pelagianisme, Arminianisme, Socinianisme, or
other errors and heresies that are horrid to purpose; he seldom takes notice of
a non-resident, or idol-shepherd: or, of schism, yea, of downright Atheism
that is such with a witness. These camels he can swallow with ease, while he
seems to be choked with a gnat Mat. 23.24
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christians fight is against fleshly corruption within him,
but no part of him.

He looks upon the flesh as his sorest enemy; but by flesh he means not the
fleshy part of his outward man, his natural body, but the corruption that is in
the whole man, as deadly poison diffused throughout the whole soul and body;
which corruption is called flesh, because now propagated with the flesh or
body, nourished by the flesh, and acted (partly, at least) by the fleshy
members of the body, (as well as by the faculties of the soul) as instruments,
and, as it were, weapons of wickedness Romans 6.13
; so native corruption is called flesh, as on the contrary, Satan is called a
spiritual wickedness, because none of these things agree to him, in his own
actings. The Christian therefore counts that flesh his enemy, not which he
finds to be the substance of his arms and legs, but which he perceives to
deprave and corrupt both these and the rest of the members of his substantial
body, as well as the faculties of his soul Romans 7.23
.

He wisely distinguishes between that weak friend and his mighty enemy: yet,
as in case of dangerous sickness, men are willing to open a vein, and spare
some good blood, so in the special practice of mortification, the Christian is
content to keep down his very body by fasting, watching, and such like acts of
a true penitent; and to lighten the spiritual part, by taking down this saucy
companion, the better to testify the true humiliation of his heart 2 Cor. 7.11
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Michal, that lets the flesh to escape, as she did
David, and put an image in the room thereof 1 Samuel 19.12, 13.
: the true Christian is as Samuel, that will hew in pieces the chiefest
Amalekite 1 Samuel 15.33
: the one like Ahab wittingly suffers Benhadad to escape, whom God appointed
to die by the hand of Ahab 1 King. 20.42
; the other is as Joshua, that after all his other victories, slew the five
Kings in the cave, as those that headed all the rest of his enemies against him
Josh. 10.26
; the one by sparing the life of the enemy loses his own 1 King. 20.42
, the other by killing his enemy saves himself Romans 8.13
.

This hypocrite fights only against the grosser works of the flesh.

Some sins nature it self, how corrupt soever, (if not transported with
passion) startleth at. Medea her self; that famous sorceresse, trembled in the
case of Parricide, in cold blood, which yet in her rage she two several times
committed; some sins are so horrid that they cannot be mentioned, but with
infamy and horror; some, so shameful when found out, as will make a very
heathen taken in the act, to blush. Some are so costly that they require more
then they yield, or then the sinner is able longer to undergo. Some are so
cross to the Profession of Religion, as they force a very hypocrite, guilty of
them, to hang down the head: and these, our hypocrite will fight with all, not
as not loving them as sins, but as being so diametrally opposite to all his
interests and relations, that he is forced to thrust them out of doors, as men
in a storm throw their goods overboard, to save his stake, and maintain his
interest in the world.

If he see an Angel with a drawn sword in the way, when he is going to earne
the wages of iniquity, he will be content rather to cashier that covetous
practice, then adventure upon the Angels sword Number. 22.34
: yet is still as covetous in heart as before. He will perhaps show some
sharpness against adultery, perjury, swearing, cursing, lying, stealing, etc.
If none of these be the special lusts to which he is most prone, or that he
cannot commit them but all must take notice of it. But as for secret lusts,
that the world cannot behold, or any sins that he can commit in secret, here he
is kind enough, and as good a friend to them, as they can find elsewhere. He
never draws sword against any sin, but that which all that know him do, or will
cry shame upon him for. Shame is a strong passion, and causes him to fight
many an unwilling duel with some fouler sins, until that be verified of him,
that he knows no shame Zeph. 3.5.
.

On the contrary, the true Christian fights against all sin, as sin. Differ.


He draws the sword of the Spirit against every known sin, although allowed of,
or at least tolerated by the world; yea, and against every secret sin and
corruption that he can discover, which is not discerned of the world; and
fearing he should not go far enough herein, he prays earnestly to his God,
Cleanse thou me from secret faults Psalm. 19.12
. He abhors sin as sin, and therefore must needs bid battle to every
sin, and most to those that lie close and hid, lest they blow him up ere he
be aware.

He humbly thanketh God and his grace, that he is in no great trouble of spirit
in fighting with crying and outrageous wickednesses that are rife in others:
yet he finds work enough to discover those that lie in ambush for him, and to
be free from those that are of less offense, as knowing them to be of no less
danger then other sins, if he should give way unto them. He therefore hates
every false way Psalm. 119.104
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul and his Army, who being commanded to smite
Amalek, and utterly to destroy them all 1 Samuel 15.3
, destroyed nothing but what was vile and refuse Ver. 9
; the true Christian is as Sampson, who will not spare any Philistines that
comes in his way, but smites them hip and thigh with a great slaughter Judge.
15.8
: the one fights with gross sins upon the account of his credit, not of his
conscience: the other fights against every sin upon the account of his God.

This hypocrite has some one sin or other against which he will not fight.

He may put on his armor, appear in the field, and make as if he did fight;
but he lets fly far enough off from his special and beloved sins, or he will
strike with the flat side of his sword, not with the edge. Absalom must have no
harm. He holds intelligence with his darling sin that is on the other side,
and he will be sure to take care of his safety, whoever else be cut off. If
Benhadad be taken, though he be never so much the enemy of God, yet he must be
saluted and used as a brother 1 King. 20.33
. Whatever be the dearly beloved of his soul, whether honor, wealth, pleasure,
he must needs spare that, as Saul's army did the best of the sheep, and the
richest booty. He can deny himself in outward things, fight against many noisome
lusts, but he will never forsake his opinions. He will abstain from food, yet
surfeit on erroneous positions. He can fast, as John of Constantinople,
surnamed the Faster, until he even pine himself, but yet at the same time be
full cramb'd with pride and ambition, affecting so much the Title of Universal
Bishop, that he at length taught those of Rome to usurp it. Or he can hold pace
with Arminius, who by much fasting and prayer, as he would make the world
believe, attained to his Pelagian distinctions and speculations. And he (as all
heretics) can deny himself in any thing, even unto the death, save only in the
bastard brats of his brain, for which he will sooner lay down his life, then
fight one blow against them.

Contrariwise, the Christian has one sin against which he specially fights,
Differ.
above all the rest.

He favors none, but he will lay on most upon his minion or darling sin,
which without grace, yea, notwithstanding grace, has most power with him, he
will never give a charge, as that doting father, Deal gently for my sake with
the young man 2 Samuel 18.5
: but rather says, as Joab to him that minded him of that charge given by the
King, I may not tarry thus with thee; but to make sure work, he took three
darts in his hand, (when one would have done the deed,) and thrust them through
the heart of Absalom. He will not spare a Traitor or Rebel to God and his
country, although the King himself command him to do it. Nay, in comparison,
he seems to neglect other sins, then suffer the Arch-rebel to live.

Indeed, as in a battle, many must be slain to make way to the General, many
must fall on both sides, before he can be touched. But he is resolved with the
King of Aram, to fight neither with small nor great, save only with the King.
He will break through all the enemies Army to dispatch him 1 King. 22.31
. For he knows that if the General be once slain, the whole Army is
discomfited. But because the cutting off the chief Commander, puts the
victory out of question, therefore the Christian will hazard all, as David did,
to kill Goliath; and, with his death to make an end for the present, of the
battle.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul, sparing Agag, the chief sin; the true
Christian is as Samuel, that (after Saul had given unwarrantable quarter) hewed
Agag to pieces, notwithstanding his delicate coming to Samuel, to move
compassion 1 Samuel 15.33
; the one will not draw blood where there is most cause to destroy without
mercy, the other thinks he has drawn no blood at all, so long as the arch
enemy is yet alive: accounting all mercy to him to be the greatest severity to
himself.

This hypocrite seeks his enemy aloof, and shuns a battle.

As cowardly Captains and soldiers of fortune waste the countries where they
come, but are loath to meet and determine the controversy in a set battle, so
is it with this hypocrite. He is loath to come near: and when he is near, he
has still somewhat to put him further off from the encounter. One faculty
leads him one way; another, another way. Will and Affections are wholly for
sin, only Understanding and Conscience keep a clamor against it. He never is
resolved to come upon sin indeed, but he has somewhat or other in him that
gives secret intelligence of his coming, that sin may shift out of the way
before he come to the place, and so prevent a fight. In him nothing but nature
maintains the war: therefore there is nothing but juggling between the adverse
parties, so as they seldom meet, and when they do, there are on each side
Counselors, that counsel in utramque partem, sometimes for one side,
sometimes for the other, both aiming at this, not to engage in fight, if they
can prevent it.

The understanding discovers sin, Conscience passes sentence, and gives
warrant for execution. The Will and Affections are for a Reprive, if not for a
pardon. So the man th^^ divided, in stead of doing execution upon sin,
sometimes commits more sin, which he knows he should not do; otherwhile he
is restrained from what he has a strong desire unto, and in both he declines
the combat, and is daily further and further off from engaging. However, the
Will and Affections have scope enough, though the act be hindered; and he is
like the dog that is held by the collar in sight of the Bear at a distance; he
strives, and in a manner dies, to get loose, when yet he is not one foot
nearer to the enemy.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian sets foot to foot to corruption, and fights
where ever he meets with the enemy.

In him Grace is the General managing the war, the soul is the field wherein
the battle is to be fought, sin is the enemy against whom grace fights; and
both these take up their quarters in the same man. Sin hides as a skulking
enemy, and so he may waste the country, keeps as far off as he can from the
Camp of his enemy, but Grace not only keeps within fight of the enemy, but
marches up close to him, and bids him battle; yea, forces him to fight. Every
faculty is a field, or rather a list, wherein these two Champions, the
Christian and sin, do meet and encounter. In his Understanding, light against
darkness, truth against error; in his Will, obedience against rebellion; in
his Conscience, remorse against hardness; in his Affections, holiness against
impurity. He knows, and yet understands not; he wills, and would not; he
desires, and affects not. In every faculty there is an evil of nature, and
yet, confronted and resisted by grace. Corruption being met with in a close
list, cannot start aside, but must needs stand to it, and take the foil.

It is not with him as with the unregenerate, in whom there are some faculties
at least, that do wholly and only incline unto evil, as an Aguish man's appetite
does unto cold drink, but that his reason and understanding restrains him:
but the Christian being regenerate has in him a perpetual mixture and
conflict, as well in every faculty Gal. 5, 17.
, as in every action; so that he cannot do the good or the evil which he
wills; that is to say, not in that manner wherein he would. For whereas by
corruption he would do wholly and merely evil, grace hinders the effect of
that natural will: and where by grace he would do absolutely well, corruption
hinders the effect of that sanctified will. He is as a Magistrate executing
justice on his own Son; nilling and willing the same thing.

Thus, this hypocrite when he keeps the field, he marches at a distance,
studying more how to keep from, then to find out the enemy; the true Christian
makes it his main business to find out the enemy, and to give him battle; the
one says, Video meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor. I see, and approve the
better thing, but follow the worse; I see which way to march, but I go another
way; the true Christian says, I see, and do not see; I approve, and not
approve; I follow, and not follow the thing that good is, yet closes with the
best at last.

This hypocrite cares not to lay his batteries against the strongest holds.

His main batteries and forces are bent against the inferior faculties of the
soul, sensuality, concupiscence and the senses; if he can subdue any of these
to the will of sin within him, he thinks he has gotten a great Conquest. If he
can delude the eye, or make use of the eye to entice the heart, and to provoke
lust: if he can but tickle any of the senses and draw them over to the party of
sin, he glories in the victory. As for Reason, and the Will renewed, those
sorts he looks upon as too strong for him, and will make you believe, (as the
Papists do) that no enemy is there. He never cares to cope with reason; he
knows that will be too hard for the strongest lust that dares encounter it.
When you tell him what reason calls for, he answers you with what
concupiscence craveth, which must be served, that being the way that all, or
most go, and he will do as his neighbors do; he will be of that Religion his
Ancestors were; all the Arguments in the world shall never prevail with him to
a^^er his mind. Yea, and by his good will he would not grapple with the W^^^
regenerated, that has engaged for God, and sworn to keep his Commandments
Psalm. 119.106 and ver. 30.
; for he knows there is no altering of the will, but by some great and
extraordinary tentation surprising the heart Gal. 6.1 2 Samuel 11.2, 3
, as it did in David and Peter ere they were aware.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian desires to deal with the enemy in his strongest sorts.

He that warreth against the flesh, and not after the flesh, will seek out
corruption in the highest towers of nature. He will not let the enemy quietly
possess the Citadel or Castle, (from whence he may continually annoy him) and
content himself with the taking in the Country about, the Suburbs, and perhaps
the City, but he will have the Fort also. He endeavors with those spiritual
weapons of the Christian warfare, to pull down strong holds, and to cast down
imaginations, or reasonings, and every high thing that exalts it self against
the knowledge of Christ; every strong and high conceit, opinion, error,
heresy, that, like the blind and the lame in the Jebusites tower, have gotten
into the highest hold of the soul, the understanding it self; and he brings
into captivity every thought, as well as affection, to the obedience of Christ
2 Cor. 10.4, 5
. He will not endure the Castle shall be kept for Satan, and he be content to
have taken some outworks only.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul, who kept himself close in Gibeah of Benjamin,
suffering the Philistines to garrison at Mic^mash, upon the borders of Ephraim,
and to send out three parties of spoilers, to plunder the countries adjacent 1 Samuel 13.15, 16.
. The true Christian is as David, who marching to Jerusalem, in which was a
fort or hold, (so strong that Joshua himself could not take it) he took the
strong hold of Zion, and dwelt in it 2 Samuel 5.7, 9
; the one is as Amaziah who let the high places stand, and the idols in them 2
Kings 14.4
, the other, as Hezekiah takes away the high places, and breaks down the
images 2 Kings 18.4
, of his own or other men's erecting in his own head and heart; as well as the
groves of inferior lusts that are planted about them.

This hypocrites armor is only lust fighting with lust.

Having taken a cursory view of the field, this character points to the weapons
used by the hypocrite. Lucan. l. 1.
His weapons are carnal, pila minantia pilis, piles, or darts, usually employed
against a foreign enemy, are now shot and darted at one another of the same
party. As there can be no harmony of errors among themselves, so neither of
fleshly lusts: what one lust would have, will not consist with the desires of
another; this oft-times breaks out into a Civil war, or rather uncivil
combat of several lusts of the flesh between themselves. This is always the
case of this hypocrite: when he would gratify one lust, another lust stands up
and draws his sword against the former, and against the hypocrite too, that
harbors both. It Is here as in an Ale house or Brothel-house, he that will
entertain all comers; (as he must, that keeps such houses) shall be least
Master in his own house, but be at the command and humor of his guests.

He would feign gratify one lust, but for another that fights in his members
against the former. He would please his appetite but for cost, non tanti emet.
He will not buy at such a rate, as one lust sets upon the commodity that he
cheapens to please another. He would be gripple and niggardly, but for pride,
or his belly. He would be as free as any man, but for the love of money; He
would be revenged, but for cowardice. All this is but a Civil war, no
invasion. It Is but the devils Motto, Divide and Reign; one faction helps to
balance and keep another in awe, to the benefit of him that cherishes both,
for his own interest.

Differ.
Contrarily, In the Christian the Spirit of God fights against the flesh.

He sets not lusts together by the ears, as hoping by their biting and
devouring each other, they will be devoured one of another Gal. 5.15
. He rather considers that the calling in of any one lust to aid him against
another, will yield no better fruit, then the leave granted by the Jews to
Antiochus to pass through their country, which ended in threats and war
against themselves 1 Macc. 15
, or then the League of the Jews with the Romans, which ended in the slavery
of the Jews, and destruction of Jerusalem also: or (to come nearer bome) such
a course is like the inviting of the Saxons by the Britans, to drive out the
Scots and Picts, whereby the Saxons became Masters of all. He therefore causes
the spirit within him to lust against the flesh Gal. 5.17
, grace against sin. He mortifieth the deeds of the body, (that is, of sin)
by the Spirit Romans 8.13
of Christ, and by the fruits thereof within him.

Upon this account, he wageth war with every enemy, not hiring one to destroy
another, which he knows will end in the destruction of himself: he fights
against sin as sin, therefore against every lust as well as against any. Grace
will be faithful to scour the coasts of all enemies, but the flesh is
deceitful and treacherous, and will certainly tyrannize over him that
entertains it upon any employment whatsoever, although it serve his turn at the
present.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Ahaz, employing the King of Assyria to assist him
against the Kings of Syria and Israel, drew upon himself not only the Assyrian,
but Egypt too Isa. 7.17, 18.
, his lusts being against him as Ephraim and Manasseh. (who though at variance
between themselves, yet) both set against Judah Isa. 9.21
. The true Christian is as Amaziah, that having hired and paid an army of the
Israelites against the Edomites, at the Word of the Prophet, telling him, that
God was not with Israel, to wit, the children of Ephraim, dismissed those
forces, and cast himself wholly upon the Lord 2 Chronicles. 25.7 and 10
; the one being enraged against some one particular lust, not as a sin, but as
crossing his humor, cares not what means he uses to destroy it, as the Monk
that drank a health in poison to King John: the other is curious in choice of
his weapons, that he may prevent a counter-buffe, which might do more mischief
to him then to the enemy.

This hypocrite borrows some weapons out of Gods Armourie, but not all.

He will now and then put on the spirit of bondage, against some overgrown
lust that he would fain be rid of, and cannot. Or rather, God deals with him as
Saul with David, in putting Saul's heavy armor upon him, and setting the
spirit of bondage before him, as he did, the Angel before Balaam; to awaken and
frighten him with the terrors of God, as Paul did Felix; scourging him with
the whip of an evil conscience, as he did Judas; for convincing him of his
wickedness, as he did Pharaoh; causing him sometimes to put the tentation of
sin out of his mind, as Saul did the evil spirit, by David's music.

These are some pieces of Gods Armor, that being placed on a true Christian,
would be of excellent use in the spiritual warfare; but to the hypocrite they
do no more good then weapons in the hand, either of a dead man that cannot
defend himself with them, or of a mad man that will do mischief by them. They
sit not well upon the hypocrites back, they hang loose for lack of one piece
which he always wants, and that is, the girdle of verity Ephesians. 6.14
; and so God favors not the hypocrite, no more then Hercules favored
cowards.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian puts on and makes use of the whole Armor of God.

He is armed with the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the
left 2 Cor. 6.7
; he puts on the panoply of a Christian, the whole Armor of God Ephesians. 6.11,
etc
, and is armed from head to foot. And being so armed, his chief weapon is the
sword of the Spirit, the Word of God Ver. 17
, before which, no enemy is able to stand. He has for his encouragement fresh
in remembrance the blood of Christ, as both the dear price of sin, and the
deaths wound to corruption, the hope of heaven, the glory of victory, and the
love of God shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost Romans 5.5
, all which make him constant to the cause. And in this posture and temper he
both fights and prays, whereby he draws aid out of heaven, the Lord
casting down great hailstones from heaven upon the enemy Josh. 10.1
, that is, exercising his own power, to destroy the flesh, and all the works of
the flesh, by which power all the weapons of a Christian are made effectual, to
the atchieving of this Conquest. For, what is it that the Lord will not do for
him, calling and crying to God in his distress, either by removing the siege,
as he did that of the Assyrians against Jerusalem 2 Kings 13.35, 36
, or putting in, or relieving a Garrison, as he did in Paul's case. 2 Cor. 12.9
So that he may boldly say, the Lord is my help Heb. 13.6
.

Thus, this hypocrite is sometimes in his borrowed Armor, but, no more able to
use it to his advantage, then David was the Armor of Saul; the true Christian
uses the Armor of God, as David did Goliah's sword, saying, there is none to
that, give it me 1 Samuel 21.9
; the one is as Perses King of Macedon, who when he was to encounter Paulus
Aemilius the Roman Consul and General, provided a strong Army indeed, but after
the battle was began, cowardly withdrew himself to Pydne, Plut. in P. Aemil.
under pretense of sacrificing to Hercules, hoping thereby to conquer, and so
lost the day; the other is as Aemilius, that beside his sacrifices, stuck close
to his sword and army, and thereby got the victory.

This hypocrite, if he fight, he fights treacherously.

He will not fight, except forced to it. And when he must fight, he is more a
friend to the Traitor or Rebel against whom he fights, then to the Prince
for whom he bears arms. At least, his heart hangs that way. For though he
say, non licet, it is not lawful to favor the enemy; yet with Bassianus, he
wishes, utinam liceret, it were lawful. When he is tempted, his answer is not,
I will not: but, with Balaam, he says, I may not, feign I would, but cannot.
But he whose will says, I would I might, will bring his conscience ere long,
to say with Julia, the mother of Bassianus, si libet, licet: If you will, you
may. He is therefore a friend to corruption against the Law, even when he
urges the Law against corruption. For Law does not prevail with him to hate
corruption, but rather corruption makes him to mislike the Law: so that his
tongue pleads for the one, and his heart for the other. As some prosecute Law
against malefactors, in appearance, yet favor them under hand; so he, while he
utters, or seems to execute the sentence of the Law against sin, yet in
heart he takes part with sin against the Law. And this humor he bewrays, in
snibbing those that are too forward in behalf of the Law of God.

Differ.
The true Christian is always loyal to God, and true of heart to his cause.

He may possibly be weak of hand, as David's faint soldiers, at the brook of
Besor 1 Samuel 30.10
, that tarried by the baggage, or he may be lame of feet, as Mephibosheth, but
his heart is upright. Some Ziba may traduce and abuse him to his Sovereign, but
he will be able in the issue to demonstrate his innocence and fidelity: and God
will do him good, because he is upright in his heart Psalm. 125.4
, and his share shall be as good after the victory, as his part is that goes
down to the battle 1 Samuel 30, 24
. He takes part cordially with the Law, against the corruption that is in his
own inner man.

He says the Law is holy, and I am sinful: not, the Law is strict, and I am a
good fellow. He wishes, would I were better, and not would the Law were more
loo^e. Yea, he hates corruption for suggesting such wishes. He stampeth on
them with his foot, and choketh them as a vapor rising from the bottomless
pit. He is glad of any Law or means that may hamper such malef^ctors, and is
as the good subject that helps, not only to apprehend, but to tie and trusse
them up. He is troubled if any one escape execution, he rejoices to set his
foot upon the necks of them all, how great soever that Joshua may smite and
slay them Josh. 10.26
.

Thus, this hypocrite is a Traitor to his General, even when he bears arms
under him, desiring rather the enemy should escape, if not, get the better: the
true Christian is as Mephibosheth, that refuses to partake of any
contentments, until he be sure that the enemy be subdued, and his Sovereign, a
Conqueror 2 Samuel 19.24
: the one is as Eliab taunting and snibbing of David, when he offered to fight
with Goliath 1 Samuel 17.28
: the other, (as Jonathan, encouraging David in God 1 Samuel 23.16, 17
) strengthens the graces of God in himself, even when they tremble, and are
ready to faint at the presence and boasting of the enemy, and gives not over,
till the enemy be mastered and slain.

This hypocrite fights in jest, and for ostentation.

He fenceth, but intends no hurt. He makes a great show of a combat, and
raises much expectation; but when all is done, he is but Caligula's Ape, who
with banners displayed, battle ranged, and trumpets sounding, set his soldiers
to gather cockles. This hypocrite does play, or act a combat, tanquam qui
vincere non vult, as if he never meant to get the day, or win the field. He
repents of sin, when he finds and feels what it has brought upon him; but
he repents not from sin and dead works to turn to the living God, as one that
hates sin. Thus even Pharaoh, when upon the rack, will seem a great
Penitentiary, confessing to Moses, the Lord is righteous, but I and my people
are wicked Exodus 9.27
, without any purpose to forsake his wickedness, although brayed in a mortar
among wheat with a pestel Prove. 27.22.
.

He comes into the field to show his furniture, as Antiochus against the
Romans, whom therefore Hannibal derided. For, being demanded, whether he
thought that preparation sufficient for an engagement with the Romans? Yes,
quoth he, though they were more covetous then they be. Thus, many men's fight
against sin is rather a pomp, or a pageant, then a true combat; they love to
show how eloquently they can speak, or write against sin, then how seriously to
fight it. They rather muster, then fight; defy, then draw blood.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian fights in good earnest, as for life and
death.

H^ fights, not flourishes. He enters the lifts, not as men challenge
single combat to determine titles of land, (not otherwise determinable by Law,
for want of evidence and proof) and yet know beforehand, that when they are
entered the lists, the, shall not be permitted to combat; but, as David with
Goliath, with a resolution to kill or be killed. He fights, not as
uncertainly, not as one that beats the air 1 Cor. 9.26
; but as one that has cast the utmost peril and die of war. If he overcome,
he kills; if he be overcome, he is sure to be slain. He looks upon fighting,
and accordingly undertakes it, as the most serious business; not like other
exercises, or striving for masteries, wherein men strive till they sweat, or
lose some blood; but, as ending in the death of one, if not of both the
Combatants. And (as it is said) the musk-Cat beaten to death turns into musk,
so a Christian thoroughly mortified, becomes a sweet savor unto Christ.

His war, is a war indeed. Every battle fought by him is with confused
noise, and garments rolled in blood Isa. 9.5
. What more beautiful then an Army in the muster? what more terrible then an
Army engaged and in the shock? Hence the Church militant, (and in proportion
every true soldier of Jesus Christ engaged in that war) is said to be
terrible as an Army with banners Cant. 6.10
; and all from him, whose neck is like the Tower of David, builded for an
Armourie, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men
Cant. 4.4
, through the power of his might Ephesians. 6.10
. Great strife, and resisting even unto blood Heb. 12.4
, is required to get sin off its fortress. She is fortified with the strong
holds of Satan 2 Cor. 10.4
. Sin in it self is a strong holder, and must be fired, or by dint of sword
forced out. Corruption sticks close, not only to the flesh, but to the soul
and spirit of every man; the knife of Circumcision had need be sharp, and must
enter and draw blood; yea, the sword of the Spirit must second it, or Goliath
will not be perfectly vanquished.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the sluggard that makes a show of rising, but
turns upon his bed, and departs not from it; and so he makes a mockery, and
presents an idle mask of repentance; the true Christian is as David
encountering Goliath, never returning without the head of his Antagonist, the one
skirmisheth at a distance to gratify the lookers on, the other fights in
good earnest, to conquer the enemy, to answer the expectation of his General
the Lord Jesus Christ.

This hypocrite fights for lucre, and upon his own account.

He takes up arms not for God, but for himself, some lust opposes some design
he has laid out all his hopes upon; or has brought him to some shame which he
fears more then sin; or costeth him more then he can well spare to gratify
one lust, without the neglect of other lusts which he would also serve. And so
he takes arms against corruption, upon grounds as corrupt, as the lusts
themselves which he fights against; either he fights for worldly ends, lest
such a lust should hinder his preferment, lose him some special friends,
procure him some extraordinary prejudice and danger, or obstruct the free
course and carriere of some other lust more dear unto him. This hypocrite will
afflict his soul, hang down his head as the bulrush Isa. 58.5
, look with a sad countenance, and disfigure his face, whereby he may appear
unto all men to fast Mat. 6.16
. But what is it for? for his sin committed? Nay, that he may sin more freely,
and with better success, he fasteth for strife and debate, and that he may
smite with the fist of wickedness Isa. 58.4
; he is in contest with some adversary which he fears may be too hard for him;
therefore, thinks by fasting to make God of his side, even in an evil cause,
thereby to prevail against his enemy.

Contrarily, the true Christian fights for victory against sin as sin. Differ.


He fights against sin, as the Romans with Pyrrhus, non cauponantes bellum,
sed belligerantes; not skirmishing to make a trade, but waging war in good
earnest to get the mastery. He looks not to be a gainer by killing sin, in
reference to making a better market for himself in the world; but, to please
him who has chosen him to he a soldier 2 Timothy 2.4
, in whose cause he engages. He fights not as a mercenary for his pay in this
world; but as one that strives to enter in at the narrow gate, and to offer
violence to the Kingdom of Heaven, or rather, to offer violence to all that
stand in his way to that Kingdom. And so in this respect, he, as a violent man
takes it by force Mat. 11.17
. He examineth not the quarrel in relation to his own ends, but in relation to
the honor and interest of his Lord and Captain General, the Lord Jesus Christ,
with whom, and for whom he resolves to engage, and prosecute the war,
whatever befalls him in it, or for it.

Thus, this hypocrite fights against sin, after the manner of boot-Haylers or
Pirates, not caring whom he robs, so he may get by it: the true Christian
fights against sin, as Joshua against the Canaanites and the rest of the
Nations, in obedience to God who called him to the work; the one seeks his
own, and not the things which are Jesus Christ's Phil. 2.21
; the other engages purely upon the account of God and of Christ, that their
enemies may be destroyed.

This hypocrite fights unresolvedly and timorously.

As he that said, Solicitor nullos esse putare Deos, I could find in my heart
to think there were no God: so this hypocrite, notwithstanding all his putting
on of armor to fight against sin, as being troubled with thoughts that
otherwise there is a God that will fight against him; yet his faint heart could
be persuaded to yield to so much Atheism, as to wish there were no such God as
might call him forth to this unpleasing war, rather then be put upon it to
encounter the enemy; he being much afraid of the issue, as David was of the
war against Absalom 2 Samuel 18.5
, choosing rather that arch-rebel might live, then be cut off by justice. The
devil also knows with whom he has to do, and how to handle such a coward.

For, however he may stand out a blow, and a brunt or two, yet if he be hard
set to, he will surely yield, because he is not resolved whether it be best to
stand it out or not, to overcome, or to take the foil from his bosome-darling
lust, which he loves as his right eye, yea, more then his own soul, the loss
whereof he had rather adventure, then part with so dear a lust: and he is of
opinion, that should he kill it outright, the victory would be more grievous
then a foil; and he should be filled with more grief for such a loss, then
David for the death of Absalom, whose life he could have been content to have
redeemed with the loss of his own Ver. 33.
, This is strife without victory, like that of Herod, that was exceeding sorry
for John Baptist Mar^ 6.26, 27
, yet gave away his head; and, as Pilate, who though he had a good mind to set
Jesus at liberty, yet that he might not come under the wrath of Caesar,
delivered him over to the bloody Jews Mat. 27.24
. This is the fate of all hypocrites, to be cowards in all Conflicts with
beloved lusts, and to fare accordingly.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian resolves to overcome living or dying.

He is resolved, before the encounter, to fight it out to the last breath, to
sink the ship, rather then strike sail to the enemy. He fights therefore
past weariness, even till his hand cleave to his sword. He has a promise of
victory, and therefore cannot succumb or yield to the enemy as overcome by him.
He striveth confidently, because lawfully 2 Timothy 2.5
, according to the martial Law of Christ; omitting no endeavors, vigilance or
lawful means unessayed to gain the victory, and to keep the field. And
therefore is assured, that what he cannot compass by his own strength, Christ
the Archduke of his faith Heb. 12.2
, and Captain of his salvation Heb. 2.10
, will accompl^sh for him Romans 7.24, 25
.

Sampson had the Sacrament of strength in his hair, but this being lost, he
was foiled. The Christian has his strength in his head, which none can divide
from him. He can do all things through Christ that strengthens him. None weaker
then he of himself; yet when he is weak, then is he strong, through him who is
the Lord his strength. And his strength lies much in his prayer, for by prayer
the Spirit of the Lord comes upon him. Yet in the midst of all his strength,
he will not be careless, but vigilant, not foolhardy to slight, or to tempt
the enemy. He will not let a Delilah lie in his bosom, to try the strength of
his faith, rather he avoideth marching too near the enemies works or forts,
shunning all occasions and appearances of evil, the company of evil men,
dangerous liberties, excess in lawful pleasures and pastimes, that he be not
snapt, or ambuscadoed by the enemy at a disadvantage; and as a true Champion
and man of valor abstaineth from whatsoever may hinder his march or
opportunity of fighting the enemy in the open field. He will suffer no fawning
lust or tentation to come so near, or to be so bold as to cut off so much as
one lock of his hair, to weaken his faith, and to disable him in the day of
battle, and so he becomes more then a Conqueror through him that loves him
Romans 8.37
, because greater is he that is in him, then he that is in the world 1 John 4.4
.

Thus, this hypocrite fights as one that beats the air, rather then
confidently sheathes his sword in the bowels of the enemy, or desires to do
it: the true Christian fights as Israel with Amalek, to destroy them utterly;
the one fights without heart, and so is overcome of evil Romans 12.21
; the other fights in hope, and therefore overcomes the evil; the one
fighting uncertainly, is certainly foiled; the other fights resolutely, and
is undoubtedly crowned.

This hypocrite has victory over sin without striving against sin.

How many ways he fails in the Conflict, we have seen. 2. The Victory.
If we look upon the Conquest, we shall find him as much out in that. We have
discovered his strife without victory, which rendered his striving bootlesse;
here we shall find him boasting much of victory without strife, which renders
the victory worthless; and we may worthily doubt whether such a victory
deserve the name, especially against so stout an enemy. Satan uses not to go
forth of a sinful soul, without some violent struglings. When our Savior
himself charged him to come out of the young man's body, and to enter into him
no more, the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him, but left him
for dead Mar. 9.25, 26
, much more will it prove so, where he has had liberty to build strong holds
of sin in the soul, when he comes to be dispossessed thereof. Of this kind, we
may well say with our Savior Mat. 17.21
, that it goes not out, but by much fasting, prayer, and strong fits of
Convulsions in the soul; here the devil will not be complemented, nor charmed
out, he must be thrust out with much struggling and wrestling by head and
ears, or he will hold his possession.

Where Satan has hope to return, and does but as it were, fetch a walk into
the wilderness, that he may come back and bring seven worse spirits with him
Mat. 12.45
; no marvel if he seem to go forth easily and pleasantly. So is it with sin, if
i^ be permitted to go and come at pleasure, as the young vipers are said to run
in and out at the mouth of the old one, then it will depart without much noise
or struggling. But if this hypocrite were once resolved (as he is not) to give
his lusts a bill of divorce, he would soon find them to tear and rent him in
another manner, then ever they have done; he would quickly feel a wrestling and
tugging, that would make him to cry out with a witness, O wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death Romans 7.24
?

On the contrary, the true Conquest is attained by fine force. Differ.


The Christian knows how he came by his victory, and what it cost him. He can
show the wounds, or at least the skars of them all his life after. He never
mounteth the chariot of triumph, but he fought lustily, and bled soundly for it
before. He is able to remember and tell the many plunges, and strong throws
that his soul endured in the travel of the new birth. Yea, because the conflict
still remains, as after-paines follow a woman newly delivered of the fruit of
the womb, he still finds returns of that Agony; the flesh lusting against
the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh Gal. 5.17
, and, as it were, the seed of the woman, the new creature continuing sharp
war on the one side, with the seed of the serpent, which is the old man
corrupt, on the other side.

Wherefore, as Rebecca felt in her womb a strange struggling, as the
contention of two Nations within her, when she was with child of Jacob and
Esau Genesis 25.22 23.
, so every Christian has in his soul an epitome of those two great Cities, to
wit, of Jerusalem and Babylon: of God, and of Satan; perpetually contending one
with another to destroy each other. But God that comforted Rebecca with this,
that the elder should serve the younger, does also comfort the conflicting
Christian with assurance, that the old man shall be subdued, and brought more
and more under the power of the new, till he be utterly wasted, and totally
destroyed Romans 6.6


Thus, this hypocrites victory is like that imaginary breaking of the
Babylonish yoke from off the neck of Zedekiah and Judah, vainly prophesied by
Hananiah Jer. 28.2
; when yet they remained under it many years after, with greater oppression:
the victory of the true Christian is the fruit of a fierce battle, carried on
furiously, till his garments be rolled in the blood of his enemies Isa. 9.5
; the victory of the one is like the achievement of Adonibezek, who cut off
the thumbs and great toes of threescore and ten Kings, but slew not one
outright; the Conquest of the other is like that of Sampson, that slew the
Philistines heaps upon heaps Judge. 15.16
, without giving quarter to any.

This hypocrite has not a victory, but only a show of it.

He is a true miles gloriosus, he brags of more victories then ever he saw
battles; but as his victory is without fight, so his triumph is without
victory. He that only musters instead of fighting, will brag instead of
overcoming. Hence he presumes and boasts that he has escaped the
corruptions that are in the world through lust 2 Pet. 1.4
, when he has only more cunningly covered them from the view of others, as
Rachel sat upon her fathers idols, under a pretense of modesty Genesis 31.34, 35
, to hinder his discovery of them. If he have put on a demure countenance, a
plain habit, a submisse accent, these are his Insignia victoriae, the badges of
his Conquest. But as some had Consular, others Questorian Ensigns in Rome,
that never were Consuls nor Questors, says Tacitus; so, many an hypocrite
triumphs as a Conqueror, that never bore the brunt of a battle against sin.

Satan laughs to see such mock-Trophees set up, as wise men did at those of the
Jesuits, when by public Edict they were banished France, they erected a
pillar in token of their banishment, yet nevertheless they had still private
access to the bosom of the King; so does Satan erect pillars to proclaim his
banishment from this hypocrites territories, when yet he has free liberty to
set up a new throne in his heart, and in secret to sit on it so often as he
pleases. Hence this hypocrite is in no better case then the Trojans, by
admitting the horse which the Grecians feigned to leave behind them as a
testimony of their flight, in the bowels of which horse lay the death of the
Trojans. He supposing a victory when there is none, is many times a means to
convey advantages to the enemy, whereby he that does it may be more surely and
speedily cut off. He that boasts of conquering Satan, while yet he has a
throne in that man's heart, does but give Satan a fairer opportunity to enslave
him for ever.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christian has a true victory, as appears by his desire of
further Conquest.

He is still, either overcoming or pursuing his Conquest, never idle, never at
that pitch, that he thinks he has done enough. He is either sorrowing for sin
committed, or in desire and fervent expectation of grace to be revived; or
under Vow and Covenant of obedience to be performed, never without some action
or design for further rooting out those Canaanites and Philistines, that yet
remain in his soul uncrucified. He never cries victory so long as one enemy
remains unsubdued.

Thus, this hypocrite is like the bragging Spaniard in eighty eight, that cried
Victory, Victory, on land, while their fellows were sinking in the sea: the
true Christian gives notice of his victory, as Cushi to David, when the Lord
had avenged him of all those that rose up against him 2 Samuel 18.31
: the one boasts before the battle, as Goliath of giving David's flesh to the
fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field 1 Samuel 17.44
, yet was himself afterward made their food by David Ver. 51
; the other is as Moses and the Israelites, who first saw the Egyptians dead
upon the shore Exodus 14.30
, before they began their Song of triumph and praise.

This hypocrites victory is not total.

Where he makes greatest show of victory, it is at most but a piece of a
victory. He overcomes some vices, but not all. If he break and rout the Van,
he leaves the Rere untouched. If he cut off the wings, yet he sets not upon the
Phalanx, or main battle; his special sin that remains whole and entire, and
keeps its ground. Horod did many things, and left (no doubt) some of his sins,
at the Baptists preaching; but not his incest: nay, he after beheaded him that
would have cut off that head and Master-sin. Judas (in all likelihood) amended
some things, cut off some enemies to his soul (else he had not been fit to have
been at all of Christ's retinue;) but not his covetousness and false heart; he
was still a thief, still a devil. Still the fat sheep bleateth, and the fat ox
loweth, after all Saul's execution 1 Samuel 15.14
; the special sin still lives, and (as Agag) not fearing death, yet reigns.
Or, in overcoming one sin he is overcome by another; as young gallants having
spent their bodies and goods in the devils service, in a way of lewdness and
luxury, become weary of that, and serve him in another kind, turning Papists
and Traitors; or, of wastful Prodigals, become covetous Mammonists, and so he
does not so much overcome sin, as exchange it, and commute with God or any
other that will traffic with him for such hellish wares.

And even in those very sins wherein he seems to be a Victor, he is not changed
in himself, nor are those very sins dead, but only cast into a swoon. Pilum,
non mentem; he may have changed his hair and hue, but not his mind; he may
hamper and halter sin, but he puts it not to death. The wolf is a wolf still;
it is as unsafe to trust him now, as heretofore. The horse is an horse still,
although he have a bridle in his mouth Psalm. 32.9
, yet beware of his heels Deuteronomy. 32.15
. Such is this hypocrite, in whom sin is repressed, but not suppressed, not
totally vanquished, at least not hewn in pieces. Such Jades will one time or
other break bridle, or run away with it in their teeth: for, in violent
tentations, and in lusts grown strong by rest, neither nature, nor reason, nor
common grace is sufficient. Haman for a while refrained himself, and thought to
let Mordecai alone to perish with the rest of his people whom he had destinated
to destruction, for his malice to Mordecai; but at length his rage and passion
grew into such a flame, as put him out of his fence, and caused him to run
furiously upon his own destruction, by hastening revenge upon Mordecai, before
the fatal day could come upon the rest devoted to slaughter with him.

Contrarily, the true Christians care is to subdue all sin. Differ.


Wheresoever he finds an enemy, be it but a Scout or a Spy, he fights him, he
makes not so much as a truce with any, much less a composition to let the
enemy go away with bag and baggage, with colors flying, and bullet in the
mouth. He takes all that he can light on, gives quarter to none that he takes
in battle. And so careful is he to rid the field of all, that he stands armed
in the field, after he has beaten and vanquished all that appeared, and
prepares for such as are yet undiscovered, as David, that not only endeavored
to subdue all his known sins, and to be kept from presumptuous sins, but prayed
also to be cleansed from his secret faults Psalm. 19 12
; not which he cherished knowingly (for of this sort he had none Psalm. 119.104
Ps. 139.23, 24
) but which he had not yet discovered in himself, or not understood to be
errors.

He repents (at least in the general) of unknown sins, as well as of sins
known. And although the victory be in this life, in some sense imperfect, for
that all the rebellions, mutinies and lurkings of sin be not absolutely taken
away; yet he is sure to provide sufficiently against the reign and quiet
possession of any spiritual enemy whatsoever. The power of grace charge
through, and through the whole body of sin, and casts down, not only the
actings but the very imaginations, and every high thing that exalts it self
against the knowledge of God, and brings into captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ 2 Cor. 10.5
. He leaves no member unmortified, no sin unsubdued, even when the relics
and remains of sin be not wholly grubbed up.

Nor does he lose ground in one place, while he gains in another. The
mortifying virtue which he draws from the death of Christ, has its influence
upon the whole old man Romans 6.6
within him, although perhaps he employ it more especially against some
particular members of the body of sin. As when Christ cursed the fig tree in
more special reference to the branches that bare no fruit, the whole tree
immediately withered Mat. 21.19, 20
. All sin in him is not only tamed and brought under, that it cannot domineer,
rage and rant, as formerly it did, but has received its mortal wound whereby
it languisheth and consumes away more and more, nullis medicabilis herbis, as
being past all recovery, and hastening to not only a dissolution, but to a total
annihilation.

He is not only changed in his conversation, but in his inclination also,
because partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in
the world through lust 2 Pet. 1.4
. He is not as Esau, that for a time dissembleth hatred, with intent of further
mischief at a fitter season Genesis 27 41
, (which is to stop sin, not to destroy it; to delay the execution, not to cut
off the power of corruption:) but he is become like Jonathan, content that
David should be King, and himself a subject, that Christ should reign to the
destroying of all within him that should oppose Christ, although it be to the
cutting off of his right hand, or to the plucking out of his right eye.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul, who pretending to have obeyed the Commandment
of the Lord in destroying the Amalekites, spared Agag, and the best of the
prey, and therefore was rejected; the true Christian is as Samuel, who hewed
Agag in pieces, that the voice of the Lord might indeed be obeyed, and was
accepted. The one is as Ahab, letting go a man, to wit, Benhadad, appointed to
destruction 1 King. 20.42
, at the siege of Samaria: (for which Ahab afterward, at the battle of
Ramoth-Gilead, lost his own life: 1 Kings 22.34, 35
) The other is as Joshuah, who in fighting the Lords battles, smote all, and
utterlie destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded
Josh. 10.40
, and was himself under constant protection.

This hypocrites victory is not well maintained.

If he overcome, yet as Caesar said of Pompey, he cannot uti victoria, manage
the day to the best advantage. He may worst his adversary, and be Master of the
field at present: but he pursues not the victory so as to prevent the rallying
of the enemy, or ra^sing of new forces to fight another battle. If the devil
be driven out of the eyes, out of the mouth, or out of any part of the outward
man, yet if still he be suffered to keep the Castle of an unsanctified heart,
he is all this while no great loser, nor this hypocrite a gainer, even when he
wins the field; because he does not pursue the enemy, etiam in castra, even to
his Camp and City, and subdue both, before he be able to make head again.

This hypocrite may so far prevail, as to abate the impetuousnesse of some
sinful lusts for a season, as David's music for a time wrought on Saul to allay
his fury and frenzy, but not to cure it. So is it with the hypocrite in the
case of affliction also, as with Balaam, while death was before him, he forbear
to curse the people of God; but being at more liberty, when he saw he could not
bring Gods curse upon them, he and the devil joined counsels to put them into a
way to bring it upon themselves, by yielding to eat things sacrificed to idols
Rev. 2.14
, that thereby they might satisfy their lusts upon the Midianitish women, who
(by the counsel of Balaam) went out to tempt the Israelites all they could, and
then, when their lusts were in a flame, put the Israelites upon the sacrificing
to idols, before they would prostitute their bodies to them.

As Joash smote thrice upon the ground with the arrows which he had in his
hand, and then stayed, whereas he should have smitten five or six times, and
then had he smitten Syria till he had consumed it, when now he should smite it
but thrice 2 Kings 13 18.19
. So this hypocrite repelleth sin once, twice, perhaps thrice, but no more; and
every time more faintly then other, but for want of constant pursuit, is never
able to make a complete Conquest. Yea, even in repelling he is inured to
tentation, and every time takes a little taste of the sweetness of sin, till
at last he yields, and is willingly overcome; as some moral Papists at first
startle at any motion to engage in Treason, but at every fresh assault become
more yielding, till at length they become desperate Traitors.

Conscience is a plain dealer, but concupiscence is crafty. Hence it is, that
conscience is often overtaken and abused. The often hearing of evil, the
wishing it lawful, the vain distinctions made by some men, whose wit is too
good for their conscience; do at length silence and benumb conscience, that it
cannot longer hold out against the tentation. Even upon victory men are apt to
grow so secure, as to lose more by their security, than they won by their
victory. To neglect a beaten adversary as weak, is dangerous: for it gives
great advantage to the enemy, or to any that will take up weapons for his
rescue, as we see in the case of the Amalekites, who having sacked, smitten and
burnt Ziklag, fell afterward to eating, drinking and dancing, because of the
great spoil they had taken. David came among them, and smote them from the
twilight, even unto the evening of the next day, and recovered all that the
Amalekites had taken away 1 Samuel 30.16 17, 18
; so is it in the most spiritual conflict of this hypocrite, in whose Camp, in
stead of keeping a strong guard, and perpetual sending out of Scouts, there is
nothing but eating, and drinking, and rising up to play Exodus 32.6
, after a victory.

Contrariwise, the Christian still pursues, Differ.
and so perpetuateth his victory.

He is as Marcellus, of whom Hannibal made this observation, that he was always
conquered, or conquering; if conquered, striving to recover his losses; if
conquering, still pursuing the victory. If he be foiled, he rises up afresh,
and every time more mighty, and more puissant; because thereby made more
humble, more lothing himself, more out of love with the world, more acquainted
with Satan's wiles and depths, and every way more pliable to Gods dispensations.
If he conquer, he does not change the sound of the Drum and Trumpet into the
noise of the pipe, nor fighting into daliance. But rather resolves Canitiem in
galea premere, to thrust hoary hairs into his helmet, as if he had none such.
He is Veteranus, an old beaten soldier, but not emeritus, one that sues to be
discharged from further following the wars, from which he knows there is no
discharge on earth Eccl. 8.8
.

He is no less careful to maintain the victory than to get it. He knows that
as sickness, so sin is most dangerous in the relapse. He considers that sin
is as the sea, that if it be shut out, will shove hard to get in again.
Therefore as the Zealanders are careful to observe tides, and to maintain their
banks; so is it with the Christian: his care makes him fearful, and his fear
diligent to prevent destruction, which without constant care and diligence
cannot be prevented. Indeed, if every thing had its due, the sea should cover
Zealand, so as that should be all sea, and no land: so would it be with our
nature, unless the prey were taken from the mighty, and the lawful captive
delivered Isa. 49.24
.

Our nature is a very Sea land, or rather Sin-land, won from the Ocean of sin,
which would overflow all, as it was wont to do, but that God by his grace first
made the dry land to appear, and ever after, set bars and bounds to the sea
of sin, to stay the proud waves thereof. For he that gives victory to the
Christian, after victory adds wisdom, to make him more watchful, and to
continue to use the means with more care, and hope of success.

Thus, this hypocrite after all his victories is like Sampson, sleeping in
Delilah's lap while she cuts off his locks, and exposes him to the power and
rage of his enemies; the true Christian is as Job, who all the days of his
appointed time will wait and watch till his change come Job 14, 14
; the one by security is made a slave after Conquest, the other by vigilance
becomes a perpetual Conqueror, no more subject to his former slavery.

This hypocrite is moved, but not removed from his old course, or love of

As a tree shaken with the wind settles again, and that more firmly: so it is
with this hypocrite. Ahab was moved with the message of Elijah, for he rent his
clothes, put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and
went softly 1 King. 21.27
; yet still he hated both Elijah and Micaiah, still he kept the Vineyard of
Naboth, for which he had been reproved. Felix trembled to hear of the last
judgment, yet still loved bribes, and his fingers itched after them Act.
24.25, 26
. The Officers of the Pharisees were astonished, Never any man spoke as this
man John 7.46
, yet they were turned by the ghostly counsel of their Masters afterward to
apprehend him. And they who came to lay hold upon him, at first fell to the
ground backward John 18.6
, yet at length took Jesus and bound him Ver. 12
. He is a reed shaken with the wind, but still continues fast mored in the
mire.

Differ.
On the contrary, In a Christian sin is not only shaken, but plucked up by the
roots.

His heart is not only astonished, but opened and softened. He is not only
convinced of sin, but converted from it. He looks upon sin as an enemy that
will be his destruction, which before insinuated by flattery as a feigned
friend. Therefore he labors not only to discover, but to confess and forsake
it, that he may find mercy. For well he knows, that God will surely wound
the head of his enemies, and the hoary scalp of such a one as goes on still in
his trespasses Psalm. 88.21
. He turns himself from all his transgressions, and so iniquity proves not
his ruin Ezekiel. 18.30
. He casts away sin as a menstruous cloth, saying unto it with detestation,
Get thee hence Isa. 30.22
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the door upon the hinges, that turns this way and
that way, but never turns off; the true Christian is as Sarah, casting out the
bondwoman and her son, (lust and all the spawn of it) out of the house; the
one makes sin to shift rooms, and to lurk for a season; the other banisheth
sin outright, without all hope of returning.

This hypocrite forbeares the evil of sin, without love to the contrary good.

He is as the dog that forbeareth the meat which is before him, for fear of the
cudgel that is held over him. He sees and feels the smart and damage of sin,
and therefore dares no longer to commit it; but he wishes all mischief to him
that is the rod or instrument to punish him. Some malefactors leave sin upon
that account only that they are punished for it, but hate the Magistrate, the
Officer, the Law; so this hypocrite being reproved for his sin, forbears (it
may be) the acting of sin, but takes no pleasure in the Word that condemns his
sin, nor in the Minister that reproves him for it. He that is not truly
reclaimed from evil, will never love the means that might make him good: being
evil himself, he cannot but hate the good, and love ^he evil Mic. 3.2
, because this is most suitable to his natural temper and disposition of heart
and affection. Every one loves his like, and hates his opposite, although with
his mouth he may show much love Ezekiel. 23.31
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian repenting, not only loves that thing which
is good, but loves all that furthered his repentance.

He is a man transformed, that now seeks good and not evil Amos 5.14
, therefore he hates the evil, and loves the good Ver. 15
. The very frame of his heart is now so altered, that it closes with good
wherever he finds it; and they are most welcome to him that show him the way
unto it. His heart is knit for ever to that Servant of Christ, that first fell
sharpest upon his formerly beloved lusts, and was made the instrument of his
Conversion, how much pain soever he put him to in the throws of the new birth;
And he professes himself beholding to the meanest Minister of Christ, that
reproves any thing amiss in him. Above all he delights in that Word which
wounded him, or rather slew sin in him. He is still of his mind, that not only
said it, but prayed it, Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness;
and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my
head Psalm. 141.5
; He kisseth that rod that lasheth his lusts to purpose, which he accounts
the greatest kindness; and prizeth that reproof that breaks the head of
Leviathan, (his strongest lust, that crooked serpent Isa. 27.1
) as the most precious o^le, or balsome, for the healing of not his head only,
but heart also, that was before wounded by sin.

He can acknowledge himself a debtor even to the Jews, (who deny and hate
Christ,) because from them came the Oracles of God, the Word of God, the
Fathers, the Prophets, Apostles; yea, and Christ himself according to the flesh
Romans 9.5
. He loves all means of his spiritual good, and especially such as have been
the instruments to draw him to repentance: not out of a base fawning humor, in
hope they should afterward spare him the more; but out of the real joy of his
soul, to find his sin so laid open, as to make his own heart to loath and
abhor it. He looks now upon sin as his greatest enemy, and therefore cannot
but be most beholding to him that is most dextrous and severe in doing
execution upon it.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Esau, whom the fear of Isaac withheld from
murdering of Jacob, when yet he wished with all his soul the death of his
father, that he might accomplish that murder Genesis 27.4
, the true Christian looks upon any man that preventeth his commission of sin,
as David upon Abigail in staying him from the slaughter of Nabal 1 Samuel 25.32,
33.
; the one loves the sin which he forbeareth, the other loves the person which
gives a stop to his sin.

This hypocrite would keep sin under, but not cut it off; and shows compassion
where he

As the Israelites (weary of fighting; or, The Conquest.
minding more the planting of themselves, than the supplanting of Gods
enemies,) made the Canaanites tributary, but did not cast them out, (which
after cost Israel dear;) so this hypocrite makes sin a tributary, (and as he
thinks, a Contributor) to his honor, profit, pleasure, etc. in stead of utter
extirpation. He cares not much for swearing or drinking, or ruffling and
ranting, etc. And therefore will not ordinarily use them, nor suffer them to
keep him company, but keeps them under, and at a distance, or ^s a dog in a
chain, to let loose when he sees occasion: but yet when he is among those
Gentlemen, or rather degenerate slips of noble stocks that are for deboshery,
there these base Canaanites, these noisome lusts, shall be called for to
contribute something to this hypocrite, to manifest him to be a complete
Gentleman, or rather beast. Or, if he have no mind to flatter, he can
ordinarily refrain his lips; yet, if it may commend him to great personages
that can advance him, or his designs, or if it may insinuate into any others
whom he has any purpose to make use of to serve his turn, he can use it. The
like may be said of other sins, which he thinks may at any time be useful, to
promote his corrupt interest or projects, till these sins, as Canaanites unduly
spared, come at length to shake off the yoke, and to get the Mastery.

As Saul, he looked upon Agag as one deserving some compassion: so he looks upon
some sins with a more favorable aspect, thinking it no great harm to let them
live; as namely, petty oaths, vain words and communication, in request among
persons of quality with whom he converseth; these he thinks have no great harm
in them, and therefore he bears with them in others, (as Joseph in Pharaohs
Court) without reproof, till he at length learn to use them himself without
remorse. These he thinks are no great matters, not worthy the taking notice of;
so for dalliance and wantonness, etc. not considering that they are the
children of the conquered enemy; and may not these do hurt another day?

Nay, he is so tender of the reputation of some sins, that though he keep them
under, yet is very careful not to put them to open shame; wherein, he favors
himself, because loath to disgrace that lust which was once his harlot, and with
which he may fall in league again. He seems very unwilling to deface the
Monuments of superstition, under pretense of a venerable esteem of Antiquity. O
what pity to pull down so many fair Monasteries built by the devotion of our
forefathers! He would rather have counseled to leave the cage, which might
have been a means to call in the birds again.

Contrarily, the true Penitent will take a full revenge upon all sin, Differ.
without concealment or compassion.

After victory follows slaughter, when once the enemy is under his power. As
the Romans in their Triumphs, slew their captived enemies at the door of the
Capitol; so the true penitent seals his victory with the slaughter of sin, at
the foot of the Cross of Christ, that is to say, his death; although he cannot
arrive at the utmost and ultimate degree of complete mortification, till by
death he be ready to enter the Capitol of glory.

He will not show so much favor to his sin, as Joshuah to the cheating
Gibeonites; he will upon no terms give it any quarter, nor reserve it for any
use, no not so much as for hewing of wood, or drawing of water Josh. 9.23
. He will not be beholding to Symony for a living; to flattery, for an office;
to profaneness, for the love and good opinion of evil men; nay more, not to a
lie for a Kingdom: He sets an Anathema upon every sin, as Joshuah upon
Jericho. He devoteth it to utter destruction, and so he does all such too that
shall go about to re-build it in his heart.

He so detesteth, that he detecteth sin wherever he finds it, although in his
own bosom. Therefore he not only repulseth, but reproacheth it. He looks not
on sin as an enemy that may be reconciled, or that can repent with him, and
bear him company in his change; therefore he loads sin with reproach, and
counts it his own shame Jer. 31.19
, folly Psalm. 85.8
, and beastly ignorance Psalm. 73.22
.

In old time, the houses of notoriously wicked men were turned into Jakes; as
Jehu did the house of Baal, when he destroyed that idol out of Israel; so does
the penitent deal with sin, he will not spare so much as the name, the memory
of it, but let it rot and perish. He not only slays sin, but puts it to the
most ignominious death that he can. He crucifieth the flesh with the affections
and lusts Gal. 5.24
, which is a shameful kind of death. And as for the spoils of sin, he lays
them not up, to look upon, but rends and tears them in pieces, and throws them
out to the dunghill, no more to entice.

Here it is (and in this case only) that he puts off all compassion, and
pronounces, Quid nisi vae victis? what remains to captives but woe and ruin?
He pursues his advantage in the height of hatred of this soul-destroying
enemy, to the utter rooting out (so far as he can attain) of all seeds of, and
encitements to sin. As the women of Midian, who had known man by lying with
him, were to be slain as well as the males, because they had corrupted the
people of God in the matter of Peor Number. 31.16 17.
; And as the children of Babylon were to be dashed in pieces for their fathers
cruelty Psalm. 137.9
; so whatever is a mother or child of sin; or a motive, or incentive to it,
is so abominable to him that truly repents, that he exercises all the
severity and cruelty he can upon it, hating even the garment spottted by the
flesh Jude 23
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Lot, for the sparing of Zoar Genesis 19.20
, thinking small sins, if chained up, will do no great harm; the true
Christian deals with sin, as Israel was commanded to do with Amalek, slaying
not only man and woman, but infant and suckling, and utterly destroying all
that they had Genesis 38.23
. The one deals by sin, as Judah by Tamar, after she had carried away his
signet and bracelets, saying, let her take it to her lest we be ashamed; the
other deals by it, as David by his sin, after his thorough repentance, setting
a brand of shame upon himself and it, to the end of the world; the one is
merciful where he should not spare, the other spares not where God calls for
severity.

This hypocrites revenge (if any be for sin) is rather upon others then on
himself.

The taking revenge upon sin, or for sin, is one part of the penitents work,
that will approve himself to be clear 2 Cor. 7.11
, (not of not committing, but) of the guilt of, and continuance in the sin
repented of. Therefore this hypocrite, who is the true penitents Ape, will
labor in this as well as in other particulars required in repentance. But as
he halteth in them; so in this, his revenge is rather taken upon another man's
back then his own. He attributes his own sin to the bad counsel, example,
instigation, or tentations of others, rather then to the baseness and
wickedness of his own heart. As Adam would have had sin to be revenged on his
wife, not on himself, and she, upon the Serpent. So this hypocrite seeks to
put off his sin to others, that the revenge may light any where rather then
where it is most due.

When he is taken in his sin, or afterward discovered, so that he must come to
shame for it, no thief on the gallows will be more ready to cry out against his
companions, counselors, temptors, yea, his very Parents and Governors for
their cockering and indulgence, as if but for them he had never been so bad,
nor come to such a shameful end; then this hypocrite will be in complaining of
others, that he has been the worse for them; but never confesses that they
have been the worse for him: which does him no good, but only to keep him off
from true repentance, by omitting that revenge which a true penitent ever takes
upon himself? such revenge shall not be wanting in hell, where such as have
been brethren in evil, shall not cease to gnash their teeth one at another, and
thereby increase the torments of each other, as here they have increased one
another wickedness.

And if the hypocrite happen to strike nearer home, and to take revenge on
himself (as sometimes it happens) he takes revenge upon his body Col. 2.23
, rather then upon his soul; he punishes nature, not sin; Gods creature, not
Satan's miscreant; and so, in stead of taking revenge on Gods enemy and his
own, he falls foul on Gods servant, and suffers that to escape, which indeed
was the Traitor to both.

Contrariwise, the Christians revenge is upon himself, Differ.
or within himself.

The true penitent is so great an hater of sin, apprehending it as that which
has done him more mischief then all the world, yea, then all the devils in
hell has or can do him, without the help and assistance of that arch Traitor
within him, that he cannot but daily meditate revenge, and falls foul upon it
wherever he finds it; and the nearer he finds it to himself, the more he
lays on upon it: as a man will let fly at a thief found in his own house,
with greater fury, then if he casually met him in another place, because he
puts him in more danger at home, and may do him more mischief.

He may most truly be called (...), one that punishes himself, (as the Orator
translates it,) or rather, one that tortureth and tormenteth himself by way of
the sharpest revenge, (as others out of Isocrates and Thucidides render it See
H. Steph. in (...).
,) not as Menedemus in the fabulous Comedy, for to act a part on the stage
only, as the hypocrite He^utontim. Act. 1. Scen. 1.
; but as holy Job in the sacred Poem of his life, who really performed what is
written of him; I abhor my self, says he, and repent in dust and ashes Job
42.6
. He says not, I hate my friends that provoked me. It was God, not Job, that
had the controversy with them. He looks only after his sin, and falls foul
upon that leaving his friends to God, not without praying for them Ver. 8, 9
; while he lothed himself.

If others spare him, he will not spare himself the more for that, but rather
do that with more severity, which they out of policy, flattery or negligence
have omitted. When Hannibal, in policy, spared Fabius his fields, wherever the
Carthaginian Army came, on purpose to render Fabius suspected of the Romans,
Fabius himself gave order for the burning of his own fields, to take off that
jealousy, and thereby outwitted his enemy. So when Satan or the world seems
to spare a true Penitentiary, thereby to draw him under suspicion, he will be
his own judge, and be sure not to be partial to himself. That which is the seat
of sin, shall be the subject of revenge. Even the right hand, the right eye,
the right foot offending, shall pay for it Mat. 5.29. etc
. Not the natural members of his body, but the spurious members of the body of
sin Col. 3.5
. Totus displicet sibi. He is altogether at odds with himself. He mortifieth
the deeds of the body, neither by the body, nor by the soul: but by the spirit
mortifying the body of sin, both in soul and body. He cries out to the
faithful Ministers, in me convertite ferrum, turn your sharpest swords against
my lusts.

Thus this hypocrite is like Saul, who when Samuel reproved him for sparing
Agag and the best of the spoil, put that off as the act of the people 1 Samuel
15.15
; the true penitent is like David speaking to the Lord, when he saw the Angel
that smote the people, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these
sheep what have they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me and my
fathers house 2 Samuel 24.17
; the one cares not who suffers for his fault, so himself may escape; the other
willingly suffers for his offense, although others perhaps as deep in the sin
as himself, go without punishment.

This hypocrites revenge on himself is with great favor.

If God command him to mortify his members which are upon earth Col. 3.5
, he is very tender and loath to use the knife too much, much less the sword,
to slay sin outright. As some could be content to take physic, so it would
not make them sick; and to go to the Chyrurgion, were it not for the smart; so
he could be content to be mortified, so it may be without much trouble and
pain. If the Minister cut and lance his beloved sin, and set conscience on
work to search and dress him, he is ready to say as Zipporah to Moses, O
bloody husband! because of this Circumcision Exodus 4.26
. He is content sin should die in time, but not killed at present, so far as to
kill his affection toward it. He had rather sin should live, although he
adventure all for the life of it, than so far to deny himself, as instantly to
let it be slain outright in his bosom. If he admit of any sorrow for sin, it
is but such as a small matter will cure: He will be sure not to sorrow to
death, nor as others that have no hope. He can easily put a period to his grief
for sin by any false comfort, by whomsoever applied; and is willing to hear of
any extenuation of his fact, as Alexander, Plutarch. in Alexand.
who seemed to be much affected, even unto the refusing to live, for his
murdering of Clitus, his familiar friend, yet was soon comforted by
Calisthenes, or rather by Anaxarchus, persuading he had done no more than
became a King and Conqueror, to whom belonged the giving of Laws, and the
setting the bounds of justice, and injustice.

Indeed if he set up a revenge of his own, or man's invention, which may cause
him rather to be admired by the Spectators, than to be truly humbled in a way
of Gods appointment, there he will lay on and not spare, beyond all reason or
warrant, as Baals Priests, who cut themselves with knives and lancers, till the
blood gushed out upon them 1 King. 18.28
; and as the superstitious Papists, who whip themselves without mercy, some for
hire, as the old Order called Flagellantes, against whom Gerson of Paris wrote
sharply Joan. Gers. Cont. Secta se Flagellantium.
, some for vainglory, and a false opinion of merit. Herein the hypocrite will
fast, weep, deny himself all comforts of life; yea, perhaps give his body to be
burnt, as sundry heretics have done, witness Legate and Wightman, the one
burnt in Smithfield, the other at Litchfield for horrid heresies and
blasphemies, about the year 1611. Every one that sets up for himself, will
bestow most pains in driving on his own project to the utmost; so will corrupt
nature, when it preferres her own invention before the way and mind of God.
This makes our hypocrite more zealous in his own way, than in the course of
Gods prescribing. He that will favor himself where God calls for severity,
will be severe enough where God requires it not at his hands.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian repenting, deals more roughly with himself
than with any others.

He is not unwilling to cherish nature: for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
Ephesians. 5.29
, unless a monster of nature. But if nature grow unruly, and with Jeshurun,
waxen fat, fall to kick against God and his ways, he will then tame that proud
flesh that would soon draw him to forsake God that made him, and lightly to
esteem the rock of his salvation Deuteronomy. 32 15
. Therefore he takes her down by abstinence and mortification. If he perceive
his eyes (like the eyes of a fool) apt to wander to the ends of the earth Prove.
17.24
; or his tongue begin to run the wilde-goose chase through the world Psalm. 73.9
; He keeps his senses close prisoners, he lets not sin to have so much as a
window or loop-hole to look out at Job 30.1
; he will keep his mouth with a bridle, that he offend not with his tongue
Psalm. 39.1
. He will not suffer that in himself, which he dares not absolutely to condemn
in another. He will fast, when he will not enjoin it to another. He will beat
down his body, and keep it under in subjection, as under the cudgel ever held
over it, when he will allow another to cherish nature more; he will deny
himself strong drink, when yet he will allow another wine for his stomachs
sake, and and his often infirmities 1 Timothy 5.23
.

Incision and Circumcision are sharp and grievous, yet a Christian will endure
them even in his soul, rather then be uncircumcised in heart. He will endure
more hardship then he will put upon another, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ
2 Timothy 2.3
. Indeed as Sampson dying killed more Philistines then in all his lifetime
before, so does the Christian, in whom death is the end, that is, the
perfecting of mortification. Not that as Sampson, he seeks to pull an old house
upon his head, by shortning natural life, to be the sooner rid of sin: for that
is not to kill sin but himself, not at Gods command, but in the devils service.
He that is dead is freed from sin Romans 6.7
; therefore he is glad to die when God calls for him, because thenceforth there
is an end of the rebellion of the flesh against the spirit. He is glad of any
aid and strength to imprison the malefactor, but more glad when he hears or
sees death approaching, as of a Jail-delivery. In this life he finds sins
subdued to be yet unruly, and the most he can do, is to clap on irons, till
Christ the Lord Chief Justice come with Commission from heaven to do full
execution upon them; the perfection therefore of his victory, revenge and
mortification is reserved unto his death. Yet what he can do before death, he
will be sure to put on to the utmost, as holy Cranmer, that burnt that hand
first, which through timorousness and the wiles of his enemies, had like to
have betrayed the cause of Christ, and him into the hands of Satan, by his
subscription to the six bloody Articles.

Thus this hypocrite deals by himself and his own sin, as David desired Joab
and the Army to do by Absalom, then in rebellion against him. Deal gently for
my sake with the young man 2 Samuel 18.5
; the true penitent handles his own sin as Joab did the same Absalom, thrusting
three darts at once through his heart Ver. 14
; the one takes revenge on himself with a rod of fox-tailes; the other, with
whips of scorpions: the one, mistaking the object, takes revenge without
warrant, or measure; the other exercises just severity upon the right subject.

Hitherto we have traced and un-earthed this subtle Fox, 2. The Grounds of the
hypocrites repentance.
as to the parts of Repentance, and seen the many differences between him and
the true penitent in that particular. We are next to take a view of his
Grounds, upon which he keeps all that ado, and whence his mock-repentance
arises.

This hypocrite repents, not out of faith, but fear.

The guilt of sin apprehended causes fear, in regard of the wages due to the
sinner; and this fear causes him to repent; not always to salvation, but
sometimes to desparation, as we see in Judas. To repentance that is right and
full, two things concur (...) and (...), after-grief, and after-wit, as we
noted before: by the one he is humbled, by the other made wiser. This hypocrite
may attain to the one, but never to the other. He may be perplexed and tear
himself to pieces, with sorrow and horror for his sin committed, when God sets
it home upon his conscience, and sets hell before him as the reward of his
wickedness. But he never grows wiser, so as to forsake all sin, and to lay
hold on mercy. Possibly he may commit that one sin no more, either through want
of opportunity, or as finding it too dear, but he never forsakes all sin, nor
indeed any sin for the sinfulness of it, or as taking hold of Christ by faith
for pardon, with resolution upon Gods speaking peace, to return no more to
folly Psalm. 85.8
. Bray this fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his
foolishness depart from him Prove. 27.22
, nor he from it. His repentance is but a peece-meal repentance, that puts him
to pain, as a part of his punishment, but will never do him good, by making him
capable of mercy.

He cannot go beyond Judas in sorrowing, nor does he strive to outstrip him in
repenting, nor repent upon better grounds. Judas being a covetous wretch,
betrayed his Master for gain, not thinking that Christ should have suffered the
loss of one hair of his head thereby: for well he knew that his Master had
been often in danger before, and still escaped their hands. When the Rulers of
the Synagogue, filled with wrath, rose up, thrust him out of the City, and led
him to the brow of the Hill (whereon their City was built) that they might cast
him down headlong; he passing through the midst of them, went his way Luke
4.29, 30
. When he was at another time admonished to depart from Jerusalem, because
otherwise Herod would kill him, he answered boldly, Go and tell that fox,
behold I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third
day I shall be perfected. Nevertheless, I must walk to day, and to morrow, and
the day following Luke 13.31 32, 33
. He feared neither Herod, nor devils doing their worst. Judas therefore seeing
the malice of the Priests and others, that they would give any thing for an
opportunity to apprehend Jesus when he was alone, and off from the multitude,
who possibly might have rescued him, if apprehended while he was preaching, or
healing the sick; and finding that his Master was too hard for them all, he
thought it good policy to take a piece of money of the Pharisees to bring them
where Christ was, when retired from company, not doubting but his Master would
make his part good with them, and shift for himself well enough, and so he
meant to cozen the Priests of their money, without damage to his Master. And in
this he was no doubt the more confirmed afterward, when having betrayed him,
and the soldiers and officers coming to apprehend him, so soon as Christ went
forth unto them, and told them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the
ground John 18.5, 6
, this Traitor himself being an eyewitness of it.

But when he saw his Master to be led away, condemned, and delivered to the
Secular power, Pilate the then Civil Magistrate under Caesar, it is said, he
repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief
Priests and Elders, saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent
blood Mat. 27.3, 4
. Now he called to mind what the Lord had said before, One of you is a devil
John 6.70.
.

And again, Good were it for that man, if he had never been born Mar. 14.21
. Now sin showed her ugly face without blushing; and being finished by bringing
forth this ugly monster of treason, came to him with her child in her arms,
that is, death and damnation, as the full reward of his treachery Jam. 1.15
. Now he saw and began to feel the sting in the tail, and perceived it to bite
like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder: He had now only sin, death and hell
before his eyes; which filled him with so much terror and horror, that for
very grief and anguish he hanged himself. Here was after-grief with a witness
arising from fear; but no after-wisdom to lay hold upon Christ by faith, as in
some other of the Jews, who had been likewise the betrayers and murderers Acts
7.52
, of the same Lord of life; yet, upon the preaching of Peter, were pricked in
their hearts, and cried out, What shall we do Acts 2.37
? whereupon they were baptized, added to the Church, and saved Ver. 38.41, 47
.

In like manner, Cain took on when he heard the curse pronounced, and sentence
passed: he might be said to repent as Judas did, upon the apprehension of
horror and wrath; not growing so wise, as to sue for mercy and pardon, but so
mad and desperate as to fly from the face of God, that is, from the very
Ordinances of God, wherein God meets his people to bless them, in turning
them away from their iniquities Acts 3.26
: He grieved enough out of fear; but, despairing of favor, sought not for
grace, but only a tolerable degree of enmity; a reprival for a season, that he
might fall to building, and forget his misery. Thus this hypocrite seeks to end
his grief in despair, and his repentance in hell, having no hope to be
reconciled unto God. For in him, the spirit of bondage brings his sinful
conscience before the angry Judge face to face. How can he then but tremble?
how can he hope?

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Penitent repents, upon apprehension of mercy, and
hope of pardon.

He looks upon him whom he has pierced, and mourns for him, as a man
mourns for his only son Zech. 12.10
; wherein there is not only an apprehension of sin, but of mercy also; of sin,
by which and for which the Son of God was pierced; of mercy, in him that was
willing in our stead so to be pierced; for he goes not from his presence, as
Cain, but looks upon him as the Israelites upon the brazen Serpent, to be
healed by him. This is the true Spirit of grace and deprecation, when a man
lamenteth that ever he offended so good a God, so sweet a Savior: when he
mourns not for what himself suffers or fears, but for what God suffers,
and that God is grieved and broken by means of his sin Ezekiel. 6.9
. It was the ingenuity of Alexander, to mourn exceedingly for his friend
Clitus, after he had slain him; much more will a true Penitent that is a child
of God mourn for his Redeemer; but he mourns with hope of pardon, as now
enabled by faith to look upon him as dying for his sins, and rising again for
his Justification Romans 4.25
; notwithstanding his piercing of him even to that death which he suffered.

It may seem that Gods children sometimes repent before they have faith: but,
it is but that (...), or after-grief before mentioned, wherein (if that be all)
they go not beyond Judas. For the Law gives only an occasional preparative, by
discovering sin, and the mischief of it. It is the Gospel and faith that brings
the purgation Acts 15.9
. As God and Christ are not severed, so neither are these two, repentance
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ Acts 20.21
. Nemo poenitentiam agere potest nisi, qui sperat indulgentiam Ambrose.
. No man can repent kindly, but he that has hope of pardon. That (...), or
after-wit, by which men are made wise to repentance and to salvation, does
necessarily implie faith.

Again, in the beginnings of Conversion there are certain seeds of faith and
hope in the elect, which are hardly discerned even by themselves: only they
appear in this, that the poor sinner, how grievously soever he has sinned, and
how sharply soever God threatens or punishes him, yet he clingeth about God
in Christ, as the child to his father even when he is angry, and lies
prostrate at his feet, and will not depart from him, let God deal with him as
he pleases. And this is a perpetual act and fruit of fairh. Therefore he will
take Gods part against himself, even before he be sure of pardon, as the poor
woman that wept upon the feet of our Savior, before she had any encouragement
from him Luke 7.38
. The Penitent often weepeth before pardon; but after, much more, that so good
a God should be so unkindly used. And this cannot be without faith,
apprehending not only some hope of pardon, but a necessity of loving much where
so much is forgiven; and, of hating sin much, where so much has been
committed. None hates sin but of love to God: none loves God, but out of some
secret apprehension, influence, and operation of Gods love to him.

Thus, this hypocrite may possibly shed many tears, as Esau, for loss of the
blessing Genesis 27.38
, not for his sin in despising his birthright Genesis 25.34
, which made him without hope, notwithstanding his tears: the true Christian
mourns as Peter, after Christ vouchsafed to look upon him; upon which look,
he not only wept bitterly, Luke 22.61, 62
but conceived hope of mercy. Christ looked upon him, but not upon Judas,
although Judas came nearer to Christ when he betrayed him, than Peter, when he
denied him: by this means, the one mourned, but with despair; the other wept,
but with trust in him whom he had dishonored, because he had before prayed for
him that his faith might not fail: the one out of fear lamenteth, but runs
from God; the other out of faith relenteth, and returns to God.

This hypocrite repents of sin, not for the sin, but for the punishment.

The malefactor having forfeited his life to the State, takes on and lamenteth,
when he sees he must die; not for his sin, but for his shameful punishment, as
appears by his Jovial deportment and riot in the very Goal, till he come to
his trial, and receive the sentence of death. So is it with this hypocrite, sin
never troubles him, till he feel the smart of it; then, it may be, for the
punishments sake he cries out of his folly also. But to look upon sin, as sin,
as a breach of Gods Law, as a dishonor to God, as being abhorrent to his
nature, this he never troubles himself withal. If God will let him alone,
suffer him to go on in his way, God shall never hear so much as one sigh from
him, nor see one tear shed by him for his wickedness against him.

He repents, not while he is at ease, but (as lewd children going to be
whipped) when he is under the rod: at what time, not only false-hearted
Israelites, when God slays them, seek unto him Psalm. 78.34
, and howl upon their beds, when God withholdeth corn and wine Hos. 7.14
; but even a heathenish Pharaoh will make great show of much sorrow and grief,
for the wickedness of himself and people Exodus 9.27
, he will confess he has sinned against the Lord, and against Moses and
Aaron, and ask pardon; but the main ground of all is, that they should entreat
the Lord to take from him the plague of the Locusts. Take away from me, says
he, this death only Ex. 10.16, 17
. So this hypocrite, when Gods hand is upon him, he is Pharaoh in a vizard;
but, at other times, plain Pharaoh without a disguise as to real repentance,
however for his better grace he will stand upon it, that he has repented, as
Saul sought to outface Samuel, and to stand in it that he had obeyed the voice
of the Lord, when he had done nothing less 1 Samuel 15.13
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Penitent repents most for the plague that he finds in
his own heart.

The plague upon the body, is but the fruit and issue of the plague of sin in
the heart, this is the greatest plague, and the root of all other plagues
without. The greatest hell is where the cause is, and the cause is where the
sin is. Therefore the true Christian repents as David, who mourned most for
sin even after pardon, as appears by the very title of his penitential Psalm,
When Nathan the Prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba Psalm.
51
, when the Prophet, in the Name of God, not only reproved, but absolved him 2 Samuel 12.13
. Yea, the true Penitent oft-times, seeks to prevent the very threatening of
punishment, and his heart smites him before God seems to take notice of the
offense; as the same David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people,
confessing to the Lord, I have sinned greatly in that I have done, and now I
beseech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done
very foolishly 2 Samuel 24.10
. Confessione praevenit Dei nuncium. His Confession prevented Gad, Gods
messenger, says St. Ambrose In Psalm. 37 ut in Gloss. Ordin.
. His heart was at work upon his sin, before God had declared what should
befall him and his people for that sin. For albeit Gad came to him the same
day, yet David was gotten up in the morning, before the Prophet was sent to him
2 Samuel 24.11
, Quia David jam erat sibi conscius peccati; and affligebat seipsum, ut Deus
remitteret ei culpam Tostat. in 2 Samuel 24, 9, 18
, because David, sensible of his sin, afflicted himself with grief, that God
might pardon it, even before the news of punishment.

And indeed, this is true ingenuity in a child of God, and a most
distinguishing mark of a true Penitent, by timely and cordial confession and
mourning for sin, to prevent Gods proceedings against him for the same, and to
be so impatient under the weight of guilt, as not to let sin remain quiet with
him so much as for a day, whether God proceed against him for it or not: And to
brook better the punishment which God inflicteth, than the sin which himself
has committed; and to resolve and say, I will bear the indignation of the
Lord, because I have sinned against him Mic. 7.9
. He lamenteth more the depravation of his nature, and the defacing of of Gods
Image, than the deprivation of his own happiness, and bears this with
patience, when he cannot endure the other, without bitter complaining against
himself Psalm. 73.22
.

Thus this hypocrite cries and howles in reaping the harvest of sin; the true
Penitent takes on most for sowing the seed that produces that harvest: The one
as Cain, cries out, my punishment is greater than I can bear Genesis 4.13
; the other, as David, makes his grief to be this, mine inquities are gone over
my head, as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me Psalm. 38.4
! the one feels damnation bitter, even before it be inflicted; the other
finds more bitterness in forsaking the Lord by sin Jer. 2.19
. The one hates God for inflicting the punishment, the other by the hatred of
sin is kept from hating God, even under the sharpest corrections Job 2.9, 10
.

This hypocrite repents, not for the offense, but for the ill success of his
sin.

If he prosper in his sin, and thrive by any sinful course, if God do not
presently proceed against him, he never troubles himself to lament the
sinfulness of his way. Felix scelus, virtus vocatur: Successeful wickedness
is accounted a virtue with him that gains by it. If he flay and slay those
under his power, to escape questioning for it, and feather his own nest by it,
he is so far from repenting of this, that he holds himself not guilty, but
entitles God to the casting in of that wealth upon him, saying, Blessed be the
Lord, for I am rich Zech. 11.5
. Thus, under pretense of acknowledging God, his providence and bounty, he
takes his enriching by oppression to be a mark of Gods approbation of his
sinful course, how palpably soever he deviate from the Commandments of God; and
makes God accessory to all his wickedness, whom now he supposes to be
altogether such a one as himself Psalm. 50.22
.

But if he have ill success in his sin, that he cannot accomplish his desires
or ends; if he be discovered, prevented, or otherwise crossed, then he makes
great lamentation, is much troubled that ever he had his hand in such a
business, that he should be so foolish and inconsiderate, and were it to do
again, none should persuade him to it: not that his heart is less affected to
the sin, but is troubled that he sped no better; as Parsons and his Accomplices
seemed to be grieved for those unfortunate Gentlemen, as they styled them, who
had their hands in the Gun-powder-Treason, not because it was a sin, (which
diverse of that Party deny) as they intended it; but before the Traitors were
discovered, taken and executed, before they had executed the Treason. Their
intent (they would have you believe) was good. And had their Plot succeeded,
the Actors should have been extolled, as that Jacobite James Clement. An. 1588.
, that butchered Henry the third of France. But whatever show this hypocrite
makes of repentance. It is no better then that of thieves and malefactors, who
are ashamed, and sorry, when found Jer. 2.26
and taken, but never before.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the true Christian is glad of ill success in any evil course.

He that endeavors in all things to please God, cannot but be grieved, when
God is grieved, and glad when his grief is prevented, especially in himself. He
therefore commends the wise Providence of God, and desires to be for ever
thankful for that great mercy, whereby he is stopped or crossed in any sinful
course, as David did, when by the wise and discreet carriage of Abigail, he was
kept from shedding blood, and from avenging himself with his own hand 1 Samuel
25.32, 33.
, according to what in a passion he had rashly determined and vowed Ver. 22
. Whatever he may think and resolve to do in a rage, or when under a tentation,
yet if God step in, and turn him back from his purpose, or cross him in it, he
would not for a world that he had not met with such a cross and
disappointment. He had rather to have been cut off for his first offense, than
to go on to commit more. His heart smites him, when he finds himself to
prosper in any evil way, as fearing that his making work for repentance, will
be sadly resented by his God, and cost him dearer than all his success will be
able to recompense.

Fools indeed are never better pleased than when they prosper in the worst
ways, nor more vexed than when they meet with a rub therein. Seculi laetitiae
est impunita iniquitas, impunity in wickedness is the joy of wicked men, says
St. Austin, but, magnae misericordiae est, nequitiae impunitatem non
relinquere, it is great mercy in God not to leave his children, when they sin,
without correction. It is a good rod that whips back him that is straggling from
God toward hell, that he may return to him from whom he has wandered.

Thus, this hypocrites repentance is a Turkish repentance, which never
lamenteth any thing as evil, but that which has evil success; the true
Christian is more troubled for success in evil, than the hypocrite can be for
want thereof. The one is as Balaam, more angry with his Ass that would save
his life, by not carrying him on in his way to curse Israel, than he was with
himself for attempting that wickedness; the other is better pleased with him
that will stop him in his course of sin, than with him that would furnish him
with switch and spurs in that road toward hell.

This hypocrite repents, not as disliking sin, but as disabled to commit it,
or loath to

It is not hatred of sin but his impotency to pursue it as heretofore, that
makes him give it over, as sometimes lame Loyola the Biscain, maimed in both his
thighs by the French at the siege of the Castle of Pamplona in Navarre, while
yet a young man, gave over the wars, and entering into a monastical life, became
the father of those Locusts of the bottomless pit, the Jesuits, those arch
Incendiaries of Christendom, and of all the world where they can get footing.
Many such lame soldiers of sin there are, whose hearts are as eager upon sin,
as ever Ignatius, upon cruelty, after he had left the field; but when they look
upon their limbs, are with grief of heart forced to cry out with Milo, At hi
quidem jam mortui sunt; verily these limbs are dead, as to any vivacious
action. Feign they would go on in sin as greedily as ever: but cannot; strength
and nature now fail, which is no small trouble of heart unto them.

This hypocrite leaves sin, as he leaves the world, to wit, when the world
leaves him. Some sins forsake their servants, as scorning any longer to be
served by those that are grown so old and feeble; such servants being grieved
at nothing so much as to be turned out of service, having as much good will to
the same drudgery as ever. The wolf changes his hue and hair, but not his
wolfish disposition, no more does this hypocrite.

Grimston in the French History.
Many admire the magnanimity of Charles the fifth, for leaving the greatness
and Majesty of an Emperor and betaking himself to a Monastery. But what wonder
is it to see a man go to bed when he is weary? That Emperor being even
over-worne and over-wearied with the turmoiles of wars, as well as of State,
and perhaps galled in conscience for the many calamities by him brought upon
Florence, Naples, and sundry other parts of Italy, and the woeful jarres by his
occasion bred among Christian Princes, which gave the Turk great advantages
against diverse parts of Europe, and to breath out threatenings against the
Germane Empire and the neighboring Territories; was willing to take his ease
when he grew unfit for business; to part with Government upon honorable
terms, before dotage should render him contemptible; and to step behind the
Curtain, to see even in his lifetime what manner of world there would be when
he was gone. So does this hypocrite seem sometimes to do great things, not out
of readiness to duty, but of necessity of not doing otherwise.

Sometimes he forbears sin for want of opportunity, as drunkards when they be
at sea, forbear drunkenness for want of Tavernes, Alehouses, or other
opportunities. If he do any good, it is because he cannot help it; as some give
to the poor at their deaths, when they can no longer hold what they have. Let
him have but an opportunity, and he will soon lay hold on it for all his
feigned repentance. If he see a thief, an harlot, a railor Ps. 50.18, 19
, he will soon run with him if he can, or follow as close as he is able,
although it be as the fool to the stocks, or as the ox to the slaughter Prove.
7.22
. And so, when he parts with sin, it is but as Lots wife parted with Sodom,
with her head over her shoulder, to show where her heart was still, even when
thrust out it by head and shoulders. Such an one never gets to Zoar. Differ.


On the contrary, the true Penitent is sorry that he repented no sooner.

He that comes once to see the odiousness of sin in the nature of it, and the
burden of it in the guilt, cannot but be vexed that he suffered himself to be
so much as once defiled with it; and be extremely troubled that he should so
long wallow in that mire. It is his grief that sin has had so much of his
youth and prime. He had rather die, or be unborne, then so to be young again,
as to follow those lusts anew which formerly he gave the reins unto. And if he
find his former lusts to haunt him still, and to pull him by the sleeve, as
desiring the same entertainment he formerly gave them, he is glad at heart that
he is able to say he is unable to gratify them as heretofore; and he had
rather be as feeble as David, when no covering with clothes would get him
heat, and when Abishag lay in his bosom, and he knew her not 1 King. 1.1, 2, 3
; than be as lustful as that good man, when he defiled the wife of Vriah.

As the Patriarchs, who having opportunity to return, returned not to that
country whence they came out Heb. 11.15
; and, when they were forced to remove, chose rather to go into Egypt, or any
whither, then back to their own country out of which God had called them to
try their faith, and to see whether they would obey his Call or not, even when
they were to go they knew not whither: so the true Penitent resolves to do, or
endure any thing, rather than to return back to his old sins, were he never so
able to serve them. Yea, even when opportunity is again offered, he abhors the
thoughts of his former ways, and will not lay hold on it to renew his sin.
Glad is the true repentant sinner that he has lived so long, as to see the
sins of his youth left so far behind him; he rejoices more in the decay of
nature, that may disable him from sin, than in any strength of body to gratify
his lusts. He is grieved more that he served them so long, although he has no
assurance of pardon, than that he can no longer be the servant of sin.

Thus, this hypocrite, as Phaltiel that parted with Michal, David's wife,
following her weeping 2 Samuel 3.15, 16. See his Confessions.
, when he could detain her no longer, parts with sin when he can se^ve it no
longer; the true Christian is as Austin, after his Conversion, often wondering,
and as it were complaining of the patience of God, that suffered him so long to
run on in sin: the one mourns at his parting with sin; but, it is because he
and his sin must part: the other mourns for sin at his casting of it out;
but, it is for that he had been at any time acquainted with it, not without
hope and prayer to meet no more.

This hypocrite repents, not out of conscience, but satiety.

He has taken a surfeit of sin, or rather of this sin; or rather of sin in
this place, with this person, or company. He is fallen out with his partner and
party, not with his vice. Perhaps he has met with some cunning strumpet that
has not only empaired his body, but drained his estate, causing him to give
not only his honor, but his years to her cruel and insatiable lust; and both
his wealth and labors to be in the house of a stranger; and so, he mourns at
the last, when his flesh and body are consumed, and say, how have I hated
instruction, and my heart despised reproof Prove. 5.9, 10, 11, 12
. It may be he has prodigally consumed a fair estate, and is not only reduced
to beggary, but lies rotting in a Goal for debt: and so now he laments his
prodigality, rather as his folly and want of wisdom to look better to his
estate, than as his sin against God. He has enough of his riot, because he
has spent all upon it. But, had he wherewithal, he could, with the drunkard,
follow it yet still Prove. 23.35


He is like some pot companion that has been well banged for his quarrelling
in a drunken fit, or been over reached in the reckoning, when he was not in
case to remember well what he called for, and thereupon forsweares the Tavern,
but not the wine; he is fallen out with his Hostess, but not with the Ale. Or
as Mahomet the first Turkish Emperor, first glutted himself with the pleasure
of his Irene, and then, in a solemn presence, cut off her head: or as
malcontents bid the world adieu, or send a Pasquil of defiance to the Court,
as having much more than enough of waiting there to no purpose? so, this
hypocrite, having enough of his sin in regard of some inconvenience or mischief
befallen him by it, he seems to be much affected for his giving way unto it,
when all his grief is, not in relation to God as being thereby provoked, but in
reference to himself that has been too much a sufferer by means thereof.

Contrarily, the true Penitent makes conscience to humble his soul for sin, as
sin; Differ.
and for it, lothes himself above all sinners.

He hates not this, or that particular sin, because of the mischief it has
brought upon himself, but hates it simply as sin whereby God is dishonored.
Himself he hates, his companions he pitieth. He sees more circumstances at
least, to aggravate sin in himself, than in any other of his partners in it. He
had had more admonitions to repent: God has stood longer knocking at his door,
and used more means by counsel, example, blessings, chastisements, to reclaim
him. He has made more promises, vows of better carriage. His profession,
place, rank and quality call for better things, and suffer much by his
exorbitancy, so as he more then others has crucified to himself the Son of God
afresh, and put him to an open shame Heb. 6 6
.

He finds the gate of Gods mercy open to himself, therefore he labors to
bring others along to enter with him; praying for them, exhorting of them, and
so far as he may without danger of being corrupted, conversing with them, to
persuade them. And this duty he looks upon as a part of that Covenant
whereinto he has entered with the Lord, that being himself admitted to mercy,
he will endeavor to convert other sinners unto God Psalm. 51.13
. Yea, he could be contented to die, that he might bring home those that have
been his companions in sin.

Thus this hypocrite in hating of sin, or himself for sin, is as Amnon, who
having satisfied his lust by forcing his Sister Tamar, hated her, in stead of
hating his sin which he had committed, or himself for committing it; the true
Penitent, when God shows him mercy in remembering his Covenant, remembers his
own ways, and is confounded, never opening his mouth any more against Gods
sharpest dealings with him, because of his shame, when God is pacified toward
him, for all that he has done Ezekiel. 16.63
.

This hypocrite in repenting, eyes more the harm of sin to himself, then the
offense against God. 3. The Object of the hypocrites repentance.


As self-love is the ground of all he does for God, so self-harme is the object
which he chiefly eyeth in his repenting. He compares not sin with Gods
justice, but with his own safety, and then no marvel to see him sorry, when he
has consumed his flesh and his body. As he is in love, not with the Gospel as
the mind of Christ, but with the outward peace and liberty which the Gospel
brings: nor with virtue, but with the credit and other companions with which
it is attended; so on the other side, he is out of love, not with the evil
which he has sown, but with the affliction which he has reaped, He sets
himself in a way that is not good, his heart does not abhor evil Psalm. 36.4
.

Iniquity without affliction were pleasant, and he would never find fault with
it; If he could separate the sin from the shame, sin could never incur his
hatred, nor put him to grief. But when misery is upon him, then he cries out
and howleth, then he will perhaps pray, remove this plague, not this sin. And
it may be he will say, I have sinned; but it is the verdict of conscience that
shames the devil; and pronounces his doom, but belieth his feeling. Qui
Gehennam metuit, non metuit peccare, sed ardere. He that parts with sin for
fear of hell, does not fear to sin, but to burn.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Penitent repents of sin singly and simply, as it is a
transgression of the Law of God.

Indeed punishment helps and corrects his taste, as we see in the people
returned from Babylon, who finding the displeasure of God to pursue them by an
unusual stormy rain, for the sin of taking strange wives, sat trembling
because of this matter, and for the great rain Ezra 10.9
. So the Israelites in the days of Samuel, were brought by the unseasonable
weather, to taste the bitterness of their sin with more quickness of palate 1 Samuel 12.18, 19
. But this happens, when his people are made Gods tasters, not their own, and
conceive of sin according to Gods detestation. Thus was David affected and
offended with his sin, Against thee, thee only have I sinned Psalm. 51.4
; not as if he, being a King, had not at all sinned against Vriah; but because,
(although his sin against Vriah was very great; yet) laying that in the
balance with his sin against God, it was comparatively nothing.

It is God that teaches him (by reforming his palate) how souce the fruits of
sin are to a spiritual taste. He first finds sin it self to be of the vine of
Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah, and then finds the grapes (or fruit
thereof) to be grapes of gall, and the clusters bitter Deuteronomy. 32.32
. But he that thus does, considers not so much what himself, as what Christ
suffers for his sins, and mourns more for Christ's sufferings than for his
own. When once God has given him the Spirit of grace and supplication, (or,
of lamentation) he looks not so much upon what he has brought upon himself, as
what he has brought upon his Savior; and therefore, quickly looks off from
his own smart, and looks upon him whom he has pierced by his sins, and
mourns for him as one mourns for his only son Zech. 12.10
. He sees Christ undergoing the bitterness of his fathers wrath. He looks
on sin with Gods eyes, and beholds it in those wounds of Christ's body, and
torments of his soul, and so cannot but in reason detest it more then hell.
Aug.
Ille peccare metuit qui peccatum sicut Gehennam metuit. He is afraid to sin,
who fears sin as he fears hell it self; not so much for fear of hell to
himself, as of that hell which he sees Christ has suffered, who underwent the
torments damnandorum, of those that deserved damnation; but not damnatorum, of
those that were actually damned; for these suffer an absolute separation from
God, with despair of better condition, which Christ never did so much as for a
moment.

It is not the fear of a fiery furnace, that can force him upon the committing
of sin, as we see in the three children Dan. 3.15, etc
. They feared sin more than the furnace, how hot soever. Nor is it the shame of
the world but the loathsomeness of sin, that restrains him from the acting of
it. For, if fear of worldly shame drive a man on upon sin, to avoid shame; it
will much more keep him from repentance, upon that very reason, and rather
encite him to commit more sin, than to repent of what is already committed, as
we see daily in those that add murder to fornication, in hope to avoid the
shame of an illegitimate conception. A good name with good men, is of high
account with a good man, and is better than precious ointment Eccles. 7.1.
. But, fame must give place to conscience. If a man by malice, shall be
defamed, if he yield not against conscience to what deserves defamation, the
true Penitent will undergo all the defamations in the world, rather than
prevent it by sin, or by not repenting for sin as God requires, what shame
soever he sustain from the world. Is virtutem vere estimat qui boni viri famam
perdit, ne conscientiam perdat. Seneca.
He rightly values virtue, that had rather lose the repute and fame of being a
good man, than by maintaining his fame, violate his conscience, and become
evil. Fabius Maximus chose rather to be reputed and scorned of all his Army,
and even at Rome it self, as a Coward, than hazard the loss of Rome by
unseasonable giving battle to Hannibal, to redeem that blot. So is it with a
true Penitent, he will do his duty, shame him for it who will: he will commit
no sin to prevent shame, what shame soever he suffer thereby. By all which it
appears, that when he repents, it is neither fear, nor shame, nor smart,
but only sin as sin which has cost his Savior dearer than it can cost
himself, that he has in his eye, and lays most to heart.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Lucretia, that stood more upon honor than upon
innocence, and chose rather to be defiled by Tarquinius, Livie l. 1.
then to be publicly defamed by having it falsely given out and published,
that she was taken in the act of adultery with a slave. Her honor was dearer
to her than her chastity, (for which, yet, she was famous) and made her less
afraid of sin in secret, than of shame in public, although procured by
slander. The true Penitent is like Susannah, tempted and urged to the same
wickedness, upon the same fear of shame, who chose rather to die shamefully
in her innocence, than to do sinfully to avoid that shame. The one takes on,
but it is for the shame; the other lamenteth, but it is for the sin, the
chief, if not the only object of his repentance.

This hypocrites repentance extends to some sins, but not to all.

His repentance is not total, but partial, and peece-meal. 4. The Extent and
measure of the hypocrites repentance.
Some sin that he is weary of, for the charge, shame, or danger he takes on
against, for the blot thereof among men. But of more spiritual pollutions he
has no such sense. Pride, whereby he becomes a Competitor with God in his
glory, or grace; Infidelity, whereby he denies God the honor of his truth,
power, and goodness: Hypocrisy, whereby he seeks to delude Gods all-seeing
eye: Security, whereby he sleighteth Gods terrors and justice, and will not
fear when the Lion roareth Amos 3.8
; Earthly-mindednesse, whereby he preferres earth before heaven, never thinking
of heaven, but in order to the things of the earth; Secret Atheism, whereby he
thinks, or wishes there were no God, or walks as if there were none:
these, and many more are no part of his grief or repentance; yea, when he is
most possessed of them, he is least troubled for them.

He plays the Huckster with God, as Pharaoh, who when he saw there was no
remedy, was content to let Israel, but not far: then, the men; but, not the
children; or, if all, yet not the cattle; nothing comes from him but by force,
and this must be gotten too, as by inches. He repents not by halves, but by
bits. He uses many words to the bargain, and is loath to allow God too much,
or too good a penniworth, who will have all, or none. He never comes up to Gods
terms. He will not part with all, whatever come of him. He will at least spare
one sin, one enemy, and that shall be Agag, the arch-traitour, the Master-sin.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Penitent strikes at every sin, as well as any.

He discharges the Cannon of the Law against every sin. The whole body of sin
is the subject of mortification, and the whole Army of the enemy shall be the
object of his Conflict. He spares not secret sins, but diveth into the depths
of his heart to fetch out that which lies deepest, if he can but discern it; be
it flattery, temporizing, or whatever is most plausible to the world. Against
more such lurkers he proceeds with greatest zeal, hypocrisy, self-love,
secret pride, covetousness, love of the world, envy, etc. are sure to smart
under his fingers, as the greatest rubs in the way of holiness. He is troubled
at hardness of heart, insensiblenesse of sin, or judgments, as great abettors
of sin drawing him from the ways of God and godliness: and therefore these he
complains of to God himself, (as David did to his servants, of the sons of
Zerviah, that were too hard and too masterly for him 2 Samuel 3.39
). Why have thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our hearts from
thy fear Isa. 63.17
? not as infusing evil, or misleading his people, but as in just judgment,
withdrawing or withholding the conduct of his own Spirit, and leaving them to
the vanity and error of their own hearts, and lusts, to walk in their own
counsels, wherein they are presently hardened Psalm. 81.12
.

He is willing God should have all content, and free possession of his whole
soul, of his whole man: that sin and Satan may have all the loss and foil
that may be, and no place of quiet possession or abode in his soul left them.
He hates all evil ways Psalm. 119 104
, but especially his special sin; here he acts the Aramites* in fighting
neither with small nor great, save only with the King 1 King. 22.31
; or the Master-sin to which he is specially addicted. He spends most of his
arrows against this enemy, because this being slain, the rest will fly, or
be more easily vanquished.

Thus, this hypocrite in repenting and casting off of sin, is as the Chyrurgeon
that cuts off one limme, or joint, to save the whole; the true Penitent, is as
the executioner, that cuts off the head, thereby to destroy the whole body: the
one so strikes at some sin, that he permits the rest to live; the other so
wounds all, that it cannot but die.

This hypocrites repentance is a turning from one sin to anoth^r.

He returns, but not to the most High; He is like a deceitful bow Hos. 7.16
; He turns from one sin to another; from profaneness to formality, from
prodigality to covetousness, which is the old man's repentance; from Popery to
Sacrilege, the Courtiers repentance, from adultery to the hatred of women
kind, or to Sodomy, which is the lustful man's repentance; from fleshly fear,
to rashness and presumption, as the Israelites when God bade them go up and
take possession, they refused, for fear of Gigantine Anakims; afterward they
who cowardly feared to go with God, would needs go, and think to overcome
without him Number. 14.41 42
, and sped accordingly Ver. 44, 45.
; or he perhaps turns from a grosser sin, to a vice, less odious among men.
In all which he is but as a deceitful bow, that sends the arrow any whither,
rather than to the mark: for being crooked, or having some other defect in it,
at the letting slip of the arrow, it turns it off from the mark, and makes it
fly far wide from the aim that was taken.

This is a change without repentance, a change of sin, but not from sin: an
exchange of that which may better be spared for some other wares of like kind,
that suit better with his present occasions and condition. Thus Satan shut out
at one door, is admitted at another, as the Anabaptists banished out of
Munster, An. 1535.
by decree of the Senate, went out at one gate, and were let in again at the
Postern, through the contrivance of their own Party in the City, Sleiden
Comment. l. 10.
and did more mischief than before.

Contrarily, the true Penitent takes as much care whither, Differ.
as whence he turns.

He remembers who has said, and still says, to all the Israel of God, if
thou will return, return unto me Jer. 4.1
. God that calls from one sin, calls from all; nor likes he one sin better
than another, who abhors all. Therefore the return must be to himself, else
it is not a pin to choose, what they turn from, or what they turn to; for as
sometimes he spoke concerning sacrifices, when he saw they observed not his
rule, but followed their own lusts, put your burnt-offerings to your
sacrifices* and eat flesh Jer. 7.21
; meaning thereby, that whereas in all their sacrifices they minded more their
own bellies than his honor, they might jumble all together, and eat the flesh
of the burnt-offerings, (which by the Law was not allowed them) as well as part
of the flesh of the sacrifices of thanksgiving, (whereof a portion was allotted
to the Priests:) that is, let them even do what they will, all is one to him;
for he accepts them not, but rather takes occasion thence the sooner to
remember their iniquity, and visit their sins Hos. 8.13
. So he speaks unto every hypocrite, that returns, but not unto him.

Hence, when the Christian prays to be turned from covetousness, he withal
suposicateth that his heart might be inclined unto Gods Testimonies Psalm. 119.36
; as well knowing that if he were not fixed upon them, his heart would pitch
upon somewhat else as bad as the Mammon, from which he desires to be turned.
And, that it concerns him as much to see whom he receives, as what he
expels, that he may not put out one devil, and take in another in the room;
that he may not renounce Popery, and fall to Anabaptisme, or turn aside to the
separation: but forsake all errors, and cleave to the truth of God; abhor
all sin and wickedness, and walk in the ways of God. He so repents, that he
turns from all his transgressions, that so iniquity may not be his ruin
Ezekiel. 18.30
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as one that goes to the devil, as to a postmaster,
for a fresh horse, to carry him the rest of his way to hell, when he leaps out
of one sin into another; the true Christian in turning from sin is as one of
those Angels in Jacobs vision, that immediately sets his foot upon the ladder,
to ascend unto God, who stands at the top Genesis 28.12, 13
. The one shifteth sins, as Jeroboams wife did her clothes, feigning her self
to be another woman, to delude the Prophet 1 King. 14.5
, the other casts off all sin, as David did Saul's armor, as too heavy for
him in all the parts of it, and puts on the whole Armor of God as only able
to defend him against all the wiles of the devil Ephesians. 6.11
.

This hypocrites repentance is not cordial, but complemental; not thorough, but
to

Either his repentance is only oral, consisting only in complementing of God,
thinking to please him with a few good words, even while he retains a whores
forehead, refusing to be ashamed for what he has done. He will cry unto God,
My Father, thou art the guide of my youth, etc. and even then, he both speaks,
and does as evil things as he can Jer. 3.3, 4, 5
. Or, it is Hystrionical, consisting in an affected Artificial, uttering of
some words or sentences drawn up before, or conceived at present; or in the
reading, saying, or singing, in a mournful tone, certain penitential Psalms,
or prayers penned upon other occasions, and little suting with his; or, happily
drawn up as a part in a Tragedy, framed out of wit, not out of grief of heart,
and uttered out of memory, not depth of sorrow, and perhaps in meeter also, in
an apish imitation of David and other Saints of old, whose hearts being deeply
affected with their sins, breathed, yea, poured out those mournful ditties, and
pathetical petitions into the bosom of their God, and were accepted. But this
hypocrite does all without any due or true sense of sin, as appears evidently
by his affectation. To pour out tears from the heart is commendable; but, too
much Art in repenting is superstitious. It is an easy matter to use the best
forms, and happily not hard to invent; but, in this business to be formal, is
most perilous. Or his repentance is mimical, consisting in countenance and
gesture, as those (...), men of forcedly sad countenance, who do (...),
disfigure their faces, to make them appear ugly Mat. 6.16
, and not in their native complexion and loveliness H. Steph. in (...).
. Such a one was Ahab, he put on sackcloth and went softly 1 Kin. 21.27
, or, with a slow pace Junius renders it Lent, the word (...).
, as one exceedingly affected and dejected at the sad tidings brought him by
Elijah; yet no true penitent, as appeared by his keeping of Naboths Vineyard
still. Felix trembled, but looked over the hatch for a bribe. The Devil need
never fear to lose such a Customer.

He has an Ethiopian skin, that may be washed, but not altered, he has
Leopards spots which may be shaven, but not changed Jer. 13.23
. He may be reclaimed from acting sin, but not from the love of it; as Balaam
was restrained from cursing Israel, but much against his will. Oh that I might
have leave! Thus swine are washed from the mire 2 Pet. 3.22
, but not brought out of love with it: So is this hypocrites outside washed,
but he has not washed his inside Jer. 4.14
. His hands and feet are restrained, but not his heart. He may forbear the
exercise, but not the habit of sin. A sense so lost, may be recovered. Such a
privation denies not a regression. His going back from sin is not a flight,
but a retreat. He keeps his rank still, that he may come on again. He has no
resolute purpose to forsake sin, but only some faint unsettled deliberation. As
David when he banished Absalom, still kept his affection toward him, and so it
was an easy task for Joab and the woman of Tekoah to bring him into favor
again: So this hypocrite, though he seem to banish sin, yet keeping his heart
unmortified, he not unwillingly gives way to Satan, and ill counsel or
company, as pleasure to bring back the banished.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true penitent repents from the heart and with his heart,
thoroughly and throughout.

In the heart he finds the plague 1 King. 8.38
, that is, his sin, therefore there he applies the plaster which is repentance
Ver. 48
. He changes his inward man, not his habit, he rendeth his heart, not his
garment, and turns to the Lord his God Joel 2.13
. What good, says he, will a plaster do me in the face, when the ulcers is in
my breast? He knows that it is not knocking his breast, but breaking of his
heart to pieces by contrition, that makes a penitent, Qui pectus tundit, and
cor non corrigit, peccata solidat non tollit. He that beats his breast without
afflicting his soul, confirms sin and not removes it. He that repents for
form, hardens his heart which should be contrite. He lays aside Art and
flourishes, and falls downright upon the heart, with all his heart. His heart
enditeth with sorrow, what his tongue utters. Yea, sometimes his heart
pours out so much sorrow, that like water out of a narrow bottle, it stops by
the way, causing the tongue to be silent, and his eyes only to speak by tears,
as in Peter, whose tears we read of, but nothing of his words. Totus sibi
displicet, he is utterly out of love with sin and himself. He causes the sword
of repentance to strike through the heart of sin, not only through the
sensitive appetite, but through the reasonable appetite also, to wit, the will.
Quam profunde peccaverit, etc. how deeply soever he has revolted, so thoroughly
he returns. He hates both the meat, and the broth of sin, the skin and the
coat. Yea, he so fenceth himself against sin, that he is safe from the love of
sin, even when he cannot be wholely free from acting of it. Do it he possibly
may, but delight in it he will never. Herein he differs from the hypocrite, as
Paul from Balaam, the one had a mind to the evil which he could not do; the
other being changed by the renewing of his mind Romans 12.2
, sometimes does the evil which his heart abhors Romans 7.15
. He truly repents, although not wholly freed from sin; while the hypocrite
brags of repentance, but repents not.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Judah, that pretending repentance, turned not to
the Lord with the whole heart, but feignedly Jer. 3.10
: the true penitent is as those humbled Corinthians, who sorrowed after a godly
sort, that in all things they approved themselves clear of that matter 2 Cor.
7.11
, of which they repented. The one is as Ephraim, a cake not turned Hos. 7.8
, but half baked, he repents but by halves; the other turns his cake, that
it may be thoroughly baked on both sides. The one mourns for his sin as those
cunning women Jer 9.17
, and other skilful in lamentation Amos 5.16
, that for hire, were employed to make a wailing and howling, for state, at
burials, (as, at the Funeral of Josiah 1 Chro, 35.25
yet little affected in heart, unless with secret joy for their gaining
thereby; the other mourns as David for Absalom 2 Samuel 18.33
, or rather for his great sins of adultery and murder, for which his soul
mourned more in secret, than in public, witness the swimming of his bed all
the night long Psalm. 6.6
. And so, the one recanteth, the other repents. The repentance of the one is
theatrical, the repentance of the other is cordial, unto salvation.

This hypocrite repents on the sudden, and all at once.

As a man not well awake rises up hastily in a fear or fright; but afterward
lies down again when the fright is over. So this hypocrite being scared,
suddenly bestirs him during the fright; but after returns to his old security,
and reposeth in his nest of sin with as much content as ever. If he be put into
an amazing fear, he will then do any thing, as Tullus, that wicked King of the
old Romans, in re trepida duodecem vovit salios Live. l. 1.
, being put into a great trembling, he would needs, after the example of Numa,
(to whose manners he was most unlike) vow to dedicate twelve dancing Priests
unto Mars: not out of devotion, but sudden surprisal with fear; but afterward
repents of being so hasty, or at least such repentance comes to nothing; he
soon forgets what he promised, and falls back again to his old course; as
Pharaoh that in a fright lets Israel; go, but they were no sooner gone, but he
pursues them.

And what he does in repentance, he dispatcheth at once. He that on the sudden
is so forward and hasty, cannot long hold out. It is an unnatural (not
supernatural) motion, therefore he cannot retain his first speed and
swiftness. His heart strings so suddenly strained, cannot hold. He is as that
Scribe that was suddenly taken with Christ, and told him confidently at the
first, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou go Mat. 8.19
, but when Christ told him he had not so much as the foxes, or birds, to bring
him to, we hear of no one step made by this Scribe, after so poor a Master. If
Christ lie in the fields, let him lie there alone. At first, Orpah was as
forward as Ruth, to go with Naomi Ruth 1.10
; but after her first offer* she never made a second, but kissed her mother and
departed Ver. 14
; so this hypocrite is as forward at first, as any, to repent: but his first
act is his last: if God will accept of his first offer and act, he may; he is
never like to have more.

On the contrary, the true Penitent proceeds upon advised resolution, Differ.
and is daily adding to his repentance.

He sits down first, and seriously considers what he has been, and done,
comparing it with the Law and mind of God; what God requires, and how he is
to perform it, and thereupon maturely, and deliberately resolves to set upon
the work, not in his own strength, but in his that gives repentance unto
Israel, walking on therein from strength to strength. The more he thinks what
he has been, and what by grace he is, the more he endeavors to continue what
he is, and to be kept from relapsing. Yea, he takes more and more revenge on
his flesh and heart that set him at enmity with God, and condemns himself,
especially for this, that he resolved no sooner to condemn and forsake his
former ways that are not good: and to loath himself in his own eyes for his
iniquities and abominations Ezekiel. 36.31
.

He is not so rash, sudden; confident as the hypocrite: he enters upon this
work with fear and bashfulnesse; is afraid to be overmuch noted at the first.
He first communeth with his own heart upon his bed, and is still Psalm. 4.4
, or silent, without making such a noise to draw observation, or to raise great
expectation, as the hypocrite does: Rather, as Elizabeth, when she had
conceived, hid her self five months, that she might be sure she was with
child, by feeling the babe stir in her womb, before she made show to others
Luke 1.24
. So the Christian is afraid to talk much of his repentance, but rather hides
it till Christ be formed in him Gal. 4.19
. But when he once perceives the babe to stir, he boldly then professes it
to all the world, not so much in words, as in his actions, which speak it
louder than his tongue; Depart from me ye evildoers, for I will keep the
Commandments of my God Ps. 119 115
.

And when he once begins this course, he never lays it aside, but still goes
on; not only to renew repentance every day, for daily sins and infirmities; but
to make further progress in his first repentance for those sins which he
knows to be pardoned: as David, that repented truly, when Nathan first
reproved him, and had his pardon; yet his tears then shed, were but a few
inconsiderable drops in comparison of those floods that followed after,
witness not only his watering his couch with his tears, and making his bed to
swim Psalm. 6.6
; but his many penitential Psalms afterward penned chiefly, if not wholly
upon that occasion. And this he knows to be the course prescribed of God unto
all true penitents, even when he is pacified toward them Ezekiel. 16.63
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Simon Magus, convicted of sin, and threatened with
judgment, affected with it at present, and craves the prayers of Peter and the
Church for him that none of the things threatened might befall him Acts 8.24
, but never did more, and therefore escaped not: the true Christian is as
Hezekiah, who so desires the prayers of the Church 2 King. 19.4
, that he neglects not to pray and to humble himself effectually till God speak
peace and deliverance Ver. 14, 15
. The one takes up repentance as it were a flash of lightning: the other
undergoes it as a necessary work all the days of his life.

This hypocrite is content in his manner, to reform himself, but not others.

It Is no part of bargain, or care to reform his children, servants, family,
much less neighbors, and least of all enemies, even when opportunities are
either offered or may be gained. He thinks, if he do not formally sin in what
himself does, he has nothing to answer for the evils that others commit upon
his occasion. He professes he can go to law safely: for, I thank God (says
he) I bear no malice. But whether he deceive himself or no, it concerns him to
consider better: but surely he considers not what corruptions he stirs up
in his provoked adversary. I may, says the vain woman, go bare shouldered and
breasted, or in what fashion I will, (dressed, or rather undrest,) for my heart
is chaste, and so is my body: but she never cares to make others unchaste, or
to nourish lasciviousness, and provoke unto lust those that are wantonly
disposed, and so to increase both transgressors (and transgressions) among men
Prove. 23.28
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Penitent extends his repentance to others.

Either he will reform them, or lament their sins, because he looks upon sin as
Gods enemy wherever he finds it. If he has been a partaker with others in
sin, he labors to destroy the sin in them as well as in himself, as the
repenting thief on the Cross Mat. 27.44 Luke 23.39, 40
; If not, yet he lamenteth to see God offended and dishonored, as David, out
of whose eyes ran rivers of water, because others kept not Gods Law Psalm.
119.136
, and whose zeal consumed him Ver. 139
, upon the same account. And while the hypocrite is not grieved at the sin of
his own child, the true Christian is grieved at the wickedness of Satan. He
knows that whosoever is not careful to prevent, or reform sin in others, is
not truly purged himself. Therefore as many a man, after his own cure, and
recovery, proves a Chyrurgeon or Physician to others; so the Christian once
truly converted is able to give a potion of counsel 1 These. 5.11
, a pill of reproof Jam. 5.19, 20
, or a cordial-comfort to others 1 These. 4.18
that need it.

Thus, this hypocrite is as careless of others, although his own, as Cain of
Abel; Am I my brothers Keeper Genesis 4.9
? supposing it unreasonable to require it of him; the true Christian is as the
four lepers put out of the gates of Jerusalem, who after themselves had eaten
and drunk, and filled themselves in the forsaken Tents of the Syrian Camp, in a
time of sore famine in the City, concluded that they did not well, till they
acquainted the King and their brethren with the good news of that unexpected
plenty 2 King 7.8, 9
; the one cares not whose bones remain broken or dislocated, so his own be set;
the other is as a bone-setter to restore any member of Christ that by occasion
is out of joint Gal 6.1
.

This hepocrite is always talking of repentance, but ever takes further day to
repent.

When either Gods hand is upon him, or he makes boast of himself and his
actions, he is never well, but when he is discoursing of his repentance, 5. The
time of his repentance. Plutarch.
as a bad debtor that talks much of paying his debts, till his Creditors press
hard for their money: then he bids them come another time. It is yet too soon,
too early to repent in good earnest; time enough in age, in sickness, or at
least to morrow. Cras, cras, corvina vox. This procrastination is the voice of
the Raven that returns not into the Ark for want of mourning with the Dove by
seasonable repentance.

And how many are deceived by this delusion! Modo and modo non habet modum.
There is no end of delay when we give it a beginning. Satan will not at once
say in plain terms to any man that is not wholly given up to impudence in
sinning, never repent: but, draws him to it by degrees, as Diogenes that was an
enemy to marriage, would answer that question, When is the best time to marry?
A young man not so soon; an old man not so late. And so for the most part it
proves in the matter of repentance. He that will advise with the devil about
the best time to repent, will find him so long in his (...), that is,
hereafter, no haste yet, that he will at length be surprised with the devils
(...): or not at all, it is now too late.

Man's heart makes him believe he can repent when he list, and, that late, is
as good as early; that there is no such danger in taking a few walks in the
devils paradise, the pleasures of sin, but that after, with a wet finger, and
an easy stride, he may, by repenting, step into the Paradise of God. Too many
go thus on till they come to hell with a purpose of repentance, and may be
styled (...), the Penitentiary, that never repents; as Antigonus was called
(...), the Giver, that never bestowed gift, but only said he will give.

Contrariwise, the true Penitent no sooner sins, but he repents. Differ.


He has found by woeful experience the mischief of deferring execution upon
sin, what devices it uses to obtain a pardon, if first it can get but a
reprive. Joab knew what danger was to tarry discoursing but a few minutes with
the man that told him of Absaloms hanging by the hair in an oak, and pleading
against the smiting of him; therefore abruptly breaks off, telling the man, I
may not tarry thus with thee, and takes three darts, and thrust them thorough
the heart of Absalom 2 Samuel 18.14
. So the true Penitent dispatcheth sin out of the way with the first, not admit
of quarter, delay, or so much as a parley.

He considers first, that repentance is Gods gift, not in man's power, no more
than to keep the whole Law: and that it is no less impossible to repent,
without God, than to need no repentance. That it is not a, Lord have mercy, but
an heart thoroughly pierced and grieved for sin in Gods behalf, that defines
repentance. A gift then it is, and that of God; for, it is he that gives
repentance unto Israel Acts 5.31
, even repentance unto life Acts 11.18
. It is a gift, purely Evangelical, that is supernatural, not like the
remainders of the Law first engraffed in man's first Creation, in the hearts of
all men by nature. And however the heart may be convinced, terrified and
tortured by natural conscience, as Judas was, yet it can never dissolve into
godly sorrow, nor turn from iniquity, without this gift from God. The heart of
man is like a spring-lock that can shut of it self, it can accuse, and shut
under the hatches of condemnation, but it can never open to comfort, or
conversion, without the Key of David, the grace of the Gospel. Therefore
repentance is said to be a spirit of grace and supplication, given only to the
house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Zech. 12.10
, that is, to the elect of God.

Next, he observes, that late repentance is like late husbandry, which seldom
yields any considerable crop: that it is seldom sound, or lasting. For the most
part it comes forth when a man can sin no longer, and proceeds from an heart,
not humbled for sin, but hampered or disabled that it cannot sin; therefore
late repentance seldom finds acceptance with God, no more than the giving the
dregs of age to the Prince, when the best wine of youth has been consumed upon
Traitors. Alexander cashiered the soldier that had his armor to seek till he
was to fight: and the Lord excludes those idle and careless Virgins, that had
their oil to seek when their lamps were to be lighted Mat. 25.10
, albeit they had a purpose to get oil, and went about it too, when it was too
late. God will not always wait on him that still thinks he may wait a little
longer; and commonly, where he has waited longest, he gives very short
warning, when he is resolved to wait no longer, but comes on the sudden, and is
gone as suddenly, as he came. So that for the most part, such dallying delaying
penitents fall short of repentance, and drop into hell, even when now they
think to repent in earnest.

Some have repented in age, and very late, who have been received to mercy: but
we read not of any that being called of God, and promising to repent, put off
repentance from youth till age, and then repented. Zaccheus tarried out till
the eleventh hour, but yet delayed not scarce a minute after he was called. I
dare not think that Hezekiah, so good a man, would be careless of training up
his children in the fear and nurture of the Lord; and that, his son Manasseh,
although young when his father died, was altogether without admonitions,
reproofs, and calling to repentance by the Prophets; which he did withstand,
and would not hearken to the Word of the Lord 2 Chro. 33.10
, yet afterward repented, and that effectually. How long he stood out against
God is not recorded: the Hebrew Doctors say, he reigned wickedly twenty two
years, in his twenty third he was carried to Babylon; and, in the same year,
repented and returned: but this was no ordinary thing, nor such a President as
may warrant other sinners to defer repentance. For usually, dying repentance
proceeds from a dead heart frighted by the apprehension of wrath, and so
dies with the party without hope of mercy.

Yea, he further wisely considers that if he cannot rise up and repent with
this load already on his back, how shall he be able to do it afterward when it
is become heavier? If he cannot break this cord of sin, how shall he do when it
is doubled, and at length grown up to a cable? Therefore the true Convert
hastes, as Zaccheus, at the call of Christ Euke 19.5, 6
; and follows as close as the echo, the voice Psalm. 27 8
. Yea, he cutteth cable in case of great danger when God raises a tempest for
his sins because he cannot tarry to weigh anchor in a storm. He will part with
any thing now, to save the ship and himself. He flees from sin as from a
serpent under his feet, which biteth so soon as it touches him Ecclus. 21.2
. As a Do from the Hunter, and as a bird from the Fowler. If he repented not
in youth he is sorry that it was past before his calling; yet while the Lord
does call, he is careful not to harden his heart. He brings his vessel while
it raineth, not trusting to an after-shower. He had need make haste, because he
knows that his Better, yea, his Maker tarrieth the leisure of his repentance
2 Pet. 3.9
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the sluggard, that, take him when you will, he
still cries, yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
hands to sleep Prove. 6.10
. Or, if he rise and get up, he is like St. George on horseback, that never
rides; the true Christian is as Samuel, that at the first call, which be
understands he says, Speak Lord, for thy servant hears 2 Samuel 3.10
. The one is as Nabal 1 Samuel 25.37
, never affected with his offense till he hear of his danger, and then his
heart died within him, and he became as a stone; the other is as David, who no
sooner had cut off the skirt of Saul's garment, but his heart smote him, when
his men provoked him to smite Saul, the anointed of the Lord 1 Samuel 24.5, 6
.

This hypocrite when after his delays he comes to repent, his repentance is
but an intermission of sin, not a ceasing from sin.

As friends take leave, but with hope to meet again; and lovers fall out, but
despair not to make up the breach again. So this hypocrite quarrels with, and
takes leave of sin, but with hope of meeting again, and of a reconciliation.
His repentance is but a qualme that will soon be over; momentany, not
perpetual. As when the unclean spirit went out of the man, seeking rest
elsewhere, but found none like that he had in his first entertainer, there was
both in the devil an intent to re. turn, and in the man a desire to receive
him, whereupon he brought with him seven spirits more wicked then himself, and
they all enter in and dwell there, whereby the last state of that man it worse
then the first; Mat. 12.43, etc.
Even so it is with this hypocrite; He never parts with a Devil, or a lust, but
as an host with his guest; he hopes it will not be long, ere he shall see him
again, and tells him he shall be very welcome.

Thus he is as they who make a Popish show of holiness in Lent, wear black,
abstain from Plays, and perhaps from the more wanton Concomitants of them, and
seem very devout, that as the poor ignorant Papists were wont to offer an egg
at Easter, they may put on a new face upon the old heart, because they are to
receive the Sacrament: but it is but as the Snake, that being to engender with
the Lamprey, casts out her poison and after licks it up again; for so these
mimical penitents, after the Sacrament, return to their wonted malice, riot,
lust, as eagerly, yea, more greedily than before. I condemn not all set times
appropriated to holy businesses, because, if the times be left wholly
arbitrary, most men will never see time to set about them. But, to put off all
to those set times is a fearful, yet common sin of ignorant and superstitious
Formalists in Religion, that at such times put on a form of godliness, but
deny and persecute the power thereof 2 Timothy 3.5
all the year after.

It is observed by the enemies of the Christian name, that the Papists (for,
Turks know no other Christians, Sands Relat.
but such as border nearest unto them) are never so licentious as toward the
time of shrift. Whence that Proverb is rise among the Turks, That the
Christians are mad once a year, and then by strawing ashes on their heads, they
recover their wits again. It is too true of too many others that call
themselves Protestants; sometimes they seem very demure and penitent, for the
times sake, rather than for Gods sake, or their own: but, that time being over,
none so profane and dissolute. And so it is with such, as with him that being
surcharged, can vomit and rid his stomach, what cares he for a surfeit? But in
thus doing, he obtains not mercy; for, subsannat patientiam Dei, August.
he laughs to scorn the patience of God.

On the contrary, the true Penitent so departs from sin, as never, by his
good will, Differ.
to entertain it again.

It may hang about his doors in a sculking way, watch an opportunity, and
perhaps slip in, and do him some mischief too, ere he be aware; and haunt him,
as evil spirits so haunt some houses that the inhabitants can seldom be quiet
for them; But he looks upon sin, as upon the Devil. When he parts with it, he
gives it a bill of divorce, never to return, at least, never to be entertained
as the wife of his bosom, as in former times. He will not allow it so much as
the least alimony. By the Law of Divorce, no man might receive back a wife,
once sent out of his house by a bill of divorcement, although it were not for
adultery, but he committed abomination before the Lord Deuteronomy. 24.4
, and greatly defiled the whole land Jer. 3.1
. The Penitent therefore is very careful not to admit a divorced lust, but for
ever to shut the doors of his heart against it, as remembering with grief how
often he has offended by it.

He knows that God speaks peace unto his people, and to his Saints: but it
is on condition, they return not again to folly Psalm. 85.5
. He that looks upon sin as folly, will not easily be reconciled to it, after
once he has found the foolishness of it, and sent it packing: especially, if
he has smarted for it. He then says unto God as Ezra; after all that is come
upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass. -- Should we again
break thy commandment, -- Would thou not be angry with us till thou had
consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping Ezr. 9.13, 14
? He remembers the charge given by his Lord both to the cripple at the pool of
Bethesda, and to the woman taken in adultery, Go, and sin no more John 5.14
John 8.11 August.
. For, that is true repentance, Sic plangere commissa, ut non committas
plangenda, so to bewail sins committed, as no more to commit them: so to
repent, as to make no more work for repentance.

Thus, this hypocrite parts with sin, as Michal, David's wife let him down
through a window, where at the present, he fled and escaped from Saul 1 Samuel
19.12
; but, in hope to enjoy him again; the true Christian, parts with sin, as
Amnon with Tamar, putting her out from him, and bolting the door after her,
never to admit her any more 2 Samuel 13.17
: the one deals by his lust, as David by Absalom, banished for killing Amnon
for that wickedness with Tamar, fetching him home again 2 Samuel 14.21
; the other deals with his sin as the two women did with the Ephah filled with
wickedness, carrying it into the land of Shinar, there to set it upon her own
base for ever Zech. 5.11
.

This hypocrite repents for advantage.

The sixth End aimed at.
Not for advantage to his soul, but for more carnal ends. He little minds God,
or eternity. He that is all for hereafter as to the act of repentance, is all
for the present, as to the end of his repenting: and were it not this, it
should be long enough ere he repent. It may be truly said unto him, as once God
answered the Priests, and the rest of the Jews returned from Babylon, (that
had for seventy years kept four several Fasts every year, during the
captivity, two of which they were now willing to lay aside) when ye fasted and
mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at
all fast unto me, even unto me? And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink,
(that is, in their solemn feasts, before the captivity) did ye not eat for your
selves, and drink for your selves Zech. 7.5, 6
? Did ye mind my glory, or your own bellies? So this hypocrite is intent only
upon worldly advantage, nothing for heaven in all his seeming repentance.

Thus shall ye have some Popish shaveling, or perhaps Jesuit, discontented with
his condition, missing some preferment that he expected, or too much straightened
in the pursuit of his lusts by the strict rules of his Society, or perhaps cast
out, or at least in danger thereof, he flies over-sea, becomes a great Convert,
railes at the Pope and Popery, recanteth his errors, makes great show of much
grie^ for his folly in suffering himself to be so deluded and abused: but he
will make his repentance as public and pompous as he can, and desires to come
immediately from the Stews of Popery to the Pulpit in Paul's Cross, or other
eminent place, that all may take notice of him for a famous Convert, and that
the State may prefer him: yet, has his heart as carnal and corrupt, as before:
and, if his covetous or ambitious humor be not satisfied, he can as easily
fall back, as he came on.

So, some others no less careful to turn away, or remove some present, or
imminent plague, make a great show of repenting, when they do nothing but
complement with God for their own ends, As Pharaoh, confessing, the Lord is
righteous, and I and my people are wicked Exodus 9.27
, but the business was only to get rid of a plague, not of his sin which he
seems to bewail; Entreat the Lord (for it is enough) that, there be no more
mighty thundrings and hail Ver. 28
. And for the same end Ahab complemented 1 King. 21.27
with God in stead of repenting, and God kept correspondence with him so far as
he went in Gods way in his outward garb and behavior Ver. 29
. He gave him reprive of his punishment, which was all Ahab sought; but not a
pardon of sin, which Ahab never repented of.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian repents, as lamenting after the Lord.

Thus, this hypocrite is like those Priests of old, that would not shut a door
in Gods house, nor kindle a fire on his Altar for naught Mal. 1.10
, for he will not repent, except he may gain by it; the true Christian is like
those penitents at Ephesus, who having formerly used curious Arts by which they
got much wealth, brought their books together, and burnt them before all men,
the price of them being no less than 50000. pieces of silver Acts 19.19
. He will repent, although to his loss in outward things: the one makes a
market of repentance, to get wealth; the other makes it an hospital, to be
healed of his spiritual wounds.

Although his end in repenting, in regard of the event to himself be salvation:
yet his chief aim is to be sorrowful on Gods behalf as a sufferer in his
honor, more than on his own who have deserved to be damned. Though he desire
peace with all creatures as a blessing to be desired Job 5.23
, yet his main aim is to be at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. He
is not unwilling or negligent to lay hold upon any advantage or benefit that
God is pleased to promise or cast in upon true penitents; yet advantage was
never the first, or chief wheel that first moved him to come in unto God.

He that sheds most tears after pardon pronounced, must needs have somewhat in
his eye above punishment. Therefore, if he have offended by drunkenness or
uncleanness, he mourns more, and hates it more, after the Lord has taken
away his sin: which shows that he hates sin, not so much because his body is
weakened, as because God was wronged thereby. For this he would, if it were
possible, that he should go to hell, and be capable of repenting, even there he
would repent more that he had sinned against God, than that he brought this
doom upon himself.

CHAP. XXVII. The Counterfeit Convert. Is he that turns unto God, without
Conversion of heart. Defin.

AFter repentance follows Conversion: and, such as the one is, such is the
other. If the one be counterfeit, August.
the other cannot be sincere. Est versus qui non item conversus. He may be said
to be turned, that is not converted or returned unto God. Either he may be
turned another way; as from one sin to another; or, if unto God, yet not as he
ought: either he does but seem to return, or fail in his doing more. He
returns not with the whole heart; but, feignedly Jer. 3.10
.

The voice of the Lord to the true Penitent is, If thou will return, return
unto me Jer. 4.1
. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let
him return unto the Lord Isa. 55.7
. These are spoken to such as upon sight of their sins and sorrow for them, are
willing to grow wiser and to forsake them, which is true repentance; so they
forsake all sin, and hate every false way Psalm. 113.104
. But now because such may be misled by Satan, if not guided by God, as a man
newly recovertd out of some desperate disease, may soon mar his cure, and
overthrow all, by mistaking in diet, or by some other error in ordering of his
body; therefore the Lord does not only physic his people by repentance, but
diet them by Conversion, calling all that are weary of their sins and willing
to forsake them, to come back unto himself, as that which is the end of
repentance, after they have forsaken their own way; and, which will secure the
penitent from returning again to the same, or to other folly.

Unto these Calls, this hypocrite answers, as the second son in the Parable,
I will, Sir: but, moves not Mat. 21.30
. He speaks as well as any man can do, and gives him good words, as Judah of
old, that with flattering lips, and with a double heart, cried unto God, My
Father, thou art the guide of my youth Jer. 3.4
, when yet the Devil led her, not only by the arm, but by the heart too, every
step in another way. This hypocrite is a bird of the same egg, that will
promise as much as God will ask, but perform nothing of all that is commanded
him Jer. 32.23
. His eye and his heart is not but for his covetousness Jer. 22.17
, or other lusts, from which he is not divorced by his mock-repentance. Had he
truly repented, he would indeed have returned unto him, from whom he and all
sinners have deeply revolted Isa. 31.6
. But seeing his repentance was but feigned, he returns to the Lord but in
show, not in truth.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is a true Convert unto God.

He not only hears, but from the heart obeys that voice, Return, return, O
Shulamite, return, return Cant. 6.13.
. Upon his true repentance, in forsaking his former way, he finds the truth of
that promise that God has mercy on him, and does abundantly pardon, or
multiply pardons Isa. 55.7
. God has now made him a Shulamite, one that is at peace with God and Christ,
that was before a revolter, a rebel, that neither had heart to seek after God,
nor durst to look him in the face. And indeed, only the Shulamite is in a state
and condition to return to God, for he only has made his peace with God: and
therefore Christ calls to him, and after him, again and again, to let him see
how earnest he is for his return; and then ingeminates the same call, once and
again, to give him the more encouragement, against all the objections of his
own heart, and the obstructions of sin within him, to return to his first
husband Hos. 2.7.
.

He is one of the generation of true seekers, even sum querentium of them
that seek the face of God Psalm. 24.6
with all their heart, as Jacob at Peniel, that will never give over till he
find him, nor let him go till he bless him: that beholds his face in
righteousness here Psalm. 17.15
, that he may after see him as he is in glory 1 John 3.2
. Until he return to God, and find him, he is restless in his bed, he rises,
goes every way in the streets, in the broad ways to seek him whom his soul
loves, he adventures among the watchmen, (such envious ministers as being
themselves ungodly, smite and persecute those that are godly, for they smote
and wounded him Cant. 5.7
) and never gave over seeking till he found him: and having found him, he holds
him and will not let him go Cant. 3.4
: Perhaps the flesh within him, may, at first, answer churlishly and rudely, as
that first son to his father, bidding him to go and work in his vineyard, to
whom the son malipartly says. I will not Mat. 21.29
? but afterward he bethinks himself, repents, and goes. Even a true Convert
may sometimes carry himself too rudely, and make too little haste to return
unto God, as Lot did to go out of Sodom, until the Angels laid hold upon him
and his company, and either thrust them out, or carried them out as it were by
violence Genesis 19.15.16
. And God is feign to deal with him, as Absalom by Joab, whom he having sent
for, once, and again, but could not get him to him, Absalom caused his fields
to be set on fire, that so he might at length force him to come 2 Samuel 14.30 31
, and thereby prevailed. So God sometimes sets the sinners fields on fire,
yea, causes him to go through fire and water Psalm. 66.12
, but at length he conquers him, and causes him to come in unto him; which
done, he brings him out into a wealthy place.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Ephraim, either a silly Dove without heart Hos.
7.11
to return to God; or else, compassing him about with lies and deceit Hos. 11.12
; the true Christian is one of those that seek him with the whole heart Psalm.
119.2
: the one is as the sluggard that turns upon his bed, as a door upon the
hinges Prove. 26.14
, turning this way and that way, but never turns off; the other, as the Heart,
panting after the waterbrooks (being hunted down even unto death pants after
God, his soul thirsts for God, for the living God; and as impatient of longer
stay, cries out, When shall I come and appear before God Psalm. 42.1, 2
.

This hypocrite seeks not God, but somewhat else in stead of God.

What is spoken of all sinners ( there is none that understands, there is
none that seeks after God Romans 3.11
) is most true of this hypocrite, even when he seems most to seek God. He
professes indeed to seek the Lord, but the Lord that best knows, discovers
his counterfeiting. If he lack corn and wine, God shall have his custom, to
help him off with those commodities Hos. 7.14
. If he be in a storm, God shall hear of him, to allay the tempest Jon. 1.5, 6
. If God fall to hewing and killing, then this hypocrite will seek him; he
returns and enquireth early after God Psalm. 78.34
. But God knows the inward thoughts and aims of all such hypocrites, and
thus turns the inside outward; they have not cried unto me with their heart,
when they howled upon their beds. They assemble themselves for corn and wine,
and they rebel against me. Though I have bound and strengthened their arms,
(which I had broken for their wickedness) yet they were no sooner healed, but
they imagine mischief against me. They return, but not to the most High, they
are like a deceitful bow Hos. 7.15, 16
. They make as if they aimed at God, but the heart, like an arrow shot out of a
false bow, lights far wide from that mark.

All his end is, ut been sit sibi, that it may be well with him, when he
obeys the voice of the Lord Jer. 42.6
. Prosperity, Prosperity, Prosperity is all his business with God when he
comes unto him. This is the first, and last, and all that ever he seeks at
the hand of God: if he ask more, it is in order to this. His daily enquiry is,
Who will show us any good Psalm. 4.6
? No matter what, so a carnal heart can relish it. No matter who show it: yet,
let God do it, rather than they go without it; if by no other means it may be
had, then let it be by counterfeiting religious Conversion. Some other thing
therefore there is for which this hypocrite knocks at Gods door. There is
somewhat within, that the hypocrite cannot be without; for which God is sought,
or somewhat in God that the hypocrite likes not, and therefore rejects him,
when he has got his penniworths out of him: both which I mean, his coming to
God, and leaving him again, is all one sin in effect: only the one maskes him
as an hypocrite, the other marks him for an Atheist.

Contrarily, the true Convert seeks God himself, for himself. Differ.


When God says, Seek ye my face, his heart says unto God, thy face, Lord, I
will seek Psalm. 27.8
. God no sooner speaks, but the heart makes an echo to it, without
capitulation, or sinister ends. The desire of his soul is to the Name of God,
and to the remembrance of God himself Isa. 26.8
. He had rather enjoy God in the wilderness, without bread, than to sit by the
flesh pots in Egypt, and to eat bread to the full Exodus 16.3
. While the hypocrite is for any good, nothing suffices him but this, Lord
lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me Psalm. 4.6
. He seeks not God, that his belly may be filled with Gods hidden treasures
of the earth in this life; but, that he may behold the beauty of his holiness,
and be satisfied with his Image, even after his awaking from death.

He seeks pardon of sin, that his tongue may sing aloud of Gods
righteousness Psalm. 51.14
. He seeks grace to do well, not to commend himself, but to magnify the
riches of Gods grace toward him, and that he may in all things be accepted of
him 2 Cor. 5.9
. He is all for God, even in the things he receives from God: because he goes
unto God, for God more than for himself. Yea, even when God enviteth him, with
promise and profer of some good, some spiritual good, he closes with the
invitation, but looks higher than himself in coming to God, as those true
penitents of old, when God said, return ye backsliding children, and I will
heal your backslidings, they make this answer, Behold we come unto thee, for
thou art the Lord our God Jer. 3.22
. It is this consideration that most strongly draws him, that the Lord is his
God. Not that he has not some eye to the recompense of reward Heb. 11.26
. But the chief reward he seeks is God himself, Whom have I in heaven but
thee? and there is none on earth that I desire besides thee Psalm. 73.25
?

Thus this hypocrite comes unto God as to a market or fair, to store himself
with what he lacks, and then returns home again. The true Convert turns
unto God as to his Lord, to give himself unto God, as one that is alive from
the dead Romans 6.13
. The one returns unto God, that he go laden from him, the other goes unto
God that he may dwell in God and abide with him for ever.

This hypocrite seeks God without an heart.

He can speak well, but God finds not an heart from whence that flows, which
his lips utters, O that there were such an heart in them, says God Deuteronomy. 5.29
. Nay, he is so far from this, that when he draws near unto God with his
mouth, and with his lips does honor him, he removes his heart far from God
Isa. 29.13
. He is never further off, than when he seems to be nearest, being herein like
the foot of a Rainbow, which the further you go toward it, the further it goes
from you. If he come to the Word of God, his ear, happily, listeneth, and his
mouth shows much love (he highly commends both the Preacher and his matter)
but his heart goes after his covetousness Ezekiel. 33.31
. Of such God complains in respect of the heart, they have turned unto me the
back, and not the face: though I taught them rising up early, and teaching
them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction Jer. 32.33
. Not that the outward man was wanting, but the heart was absent, whereby God
did surdis canere, make music to the deaf.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians heart is his chief Messenger and Agent, in
all his addresses unto God.

It is a great point of wisdom to send to ones betters by a messenger that is
gracious. Now the Lord bids none welcome, but the heart, and such as attend it.
If the heart be chiefly employed in the Embassy, all his Attendants are
feasted. Then the eye, the lips, the ear, the hand are all welcome. My son,
says God, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways Prove. 23.26
. He will give ear unto the prayer that goes not out of feined lips Psalm. 17.1
; because the heart frames it. When the heart enditeth a good matter, the
tongue is accepted as the pen of a ready Writer Psalm. 45.1
. Let the tongue say what it will from the heart, and it is sure of audience
and a gracious answer. He is good to the soul that seeks him Lam. 3.25
. Therefore it is the true Christians soul that desires God in the night: it
is his spirit with him that seeks God early Isa. 26.9
. It is his soul that says unto the Lord, thou art my Lord Psalm. 16.2
. It is his soul that pants, that thirsts for God Psalm. 42.1, 2
. He can no more go to God without his soul carry him on her wings, than he can
live without a soul: And when he comes unto God, he will do nothing without his
heart, how exact and dextrous soever his parts, and the members of his body be.

Thus, this hypocrite is all for bodily exercise, which profits little 1 Timothy
4.8
; that is, not at all: the true Christian is all for lifting up his heart with
his hands unto God in the heavens Lam. 3.41
, so often as he returns from sin unto God. The one returns unto God as
Saul, confessing his sin unto Samuel; but, without sorrow of heart for it, and
was rejected 1 Samuel 15.24, 25
; the other is as David, who returning with the whole heart, was accepted and
pardoned 2 Samuel 12.13
; both returned, but not alike; answerable whereunto, was the issue.

This hypocrite, if he afford God his heart, it is but a part.

If God will be content of a Partner, he may have a share: but all is too much
for the hypocrite to venture in one bottom. He can make two hearts of one, for
a need. He is (...), a double soul'd man Jam 1.8
. He has a soul for God, and a soul for Mammon too. He makes a dishotomy of
his heart, giving God one half, and Mammon the other; making God Partner with
the devil: and thinking he can serve both how contrary soever the one be to the
other, which our Savior shows to be impossible Mat. 6.24
. For, the love of the world not only banisheth the love of God out of the
heart; ( if a man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him 1 John
2.15
) but makes him to despise and hate the Lord. And the soul that cleaves to
the world commits adultery with it Jam. 4.4
, therefore, no fit wife, or friend for God, but an enemy to him.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian returns unto God with the whole heart.

He knows there is work enough for the whole heart, for the whole man; that
the whole heart is due to God, and required by him; and that they are blessed
who seek him with their whole heart Psalm. 119.2
: Less will not be accepted. God will have a whole burnt-offering, or nothing;
and the sacrifice of God is a broken and contrite spirit: when man breaks it
too pieces, God sets it so together, that he will not lose the ^^ast piece or
shiver of it. This, God promises to all true Converts, they shall return unto
me with their whole heart Jer. 24 7
: and this every true Seeker performs. With my whole heart have I sought
thee, says he Psalm. 119.10
. I shall observe (thy Law) with my whole heart Ver. 34
. I will keep thy Precepts with my whole heart Ver. 69
. I will praise thee with my whole heart Psalm. 138.1
. He can never give God enough that owes so much unto God. He can give him but
all, and that he shall be sure of. He is not ignorant how God abhorred blind,
lame, imperfect sacrifices Mal. 1.8. and 14
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as the harlot that was for dividing the living child
between the true mother and her self; let it be neither mine nor thine, but
divide it 1 King. 3.26
. The true Convert is like the true mother, crying out to the King, Give her
the living child, and in no wise slay it. He had rather part with it all, than
endure to have it divided, the dividing of it being the destroying of it. The
one is as Ananias and Sapphira who by keeping back a part, lost all, and
themselves with it Act. 5.2, 5, 10
: the other is as Barnabas, who sold all, and laid down the whole money at the
Apostles feet Act. 4 36, 37
, and thereby had treasure in heaven.

This hypocrite returns unto God, but not with an heart prepared.

The heart of man is like the accursed earth, apt to bring forth thorns and
briars, which choke the seed of grace, and either binder good actions from
being done, or mar them in the doing; for which reason it is required of all
that seek the Lord, to break up their fallow ground Hos. 10 12
, and not to s^we among the thorns Jer. 4.3
. This husbandry the hypocrite omitteth, and so whatever cost and pains he
bestows, is all lost, for the thorns overtop and choke all the hopes of an
harvest, and overrun all. He suffers corruptions to grow and over-grow in
his heart, and so miscarrieth even in the best services, because he does not
prepare his heart to the Lord. He is as Rehoboam, who did evil, because he
prepared not his heart to seek the Lord 2 Chro. 12.14
. He has some good thoughts, desires and some attempts to seek God, but there
are so many thorns and briars growing in his heart, that he never returns to
God to any purpose, he does not carefully purge his conscience from dead works
to serve the living God, and therefore never serves him with a perfect heart.

Contrarily, the true Convert prepares his heart to the Lord. Differ.


He knows that God is an holy and a jealous God, holy in himself, jealous of
his honor; and therefore they cannot serve him who are not purged and
prepared; nor will he pardon sinners that come unpurged to him. He considers
that God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, that an heart unsanctified
is a sink of all iniquity, therefore he is careful not only to cleanse himself
from all filthiness of flesh and spirit 2 Cor. 7.1
, but, prays unto that God to whom he returns, wash me thoroughly, or wash
me much, from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin Psalm. 51.2
; and again. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean, wash me, and I shall
be whiter than snow Ver, 7
. He finds to his grief when he has done all he can, many corruptions to be
mortified, many worldly cares to be suppressed and abandoned, many holy
thoughss, meditations, preparations to be entertained, and all little enough to
bring so vile a wretch into the presence of so holy, so great a God with any
acceptance.

He remembers who has given it in charge to all Converts, Wash ye, make ye
clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do
evil, learn to do well Isa. 1.16
, which lesson is not soon learned. He takes notice of that charge also,
Cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purify your hearts ye double minded Jam. 4.8
. Here is work enough for a man's whole life: He must be clean within and clean
without before he be prepared as he ought for the Lord. Therefore, as he
seeks God himself for himself, with his heart, with his whole heart, so he
prepares his heart to seek him: and, when all is done, acknowledges that he
needs pardon for want of better preparation 2 Chro. 30.18 19
.

Thus, this hypocrite rusheth into Gods Presence without preparation, as he
that came to the marriage without a wedding garment Mat. 22.13
, and is cast out with disgrace and ruin; the true Christian is as the Kings
daughter, all glorious within, and her clothing without, of wrought gold, and
so is brought unto the King Ps. 45.13, 14
, thoroughly prepared to be embraced by so great a Majesty; the one for want of
the oil of preparation obtaines no entrance; the other, as the wise Virgins,
trimmeth his Lamp, and being so ready, goes in with the Bridegroom to the
marriage Mat. 25 10
.

Th s hypocrite seldom seeks or returns unto God, until he be so straightened
that he knows not whither else to go.

He never seeks after God (unless for some worldly advantage) in prosperity;
but when God does vex him with all adversity 2 Chro. 15.6
. God is fain for the most part, to tear as a Lion, and then to go away, till
men acknowledge their iniquity, and seek his face; in their affl^ction they
will seek him early Hos. 5.15
. He will seek him for prosperity, but not in prosperity. It is not well with
him when he begins to look Godward: something he ailes when he looks that way.
If God speak unto him in his prosperity, he will not hear: this has been his
manner from his youth Jer. 22.21 Psalm 78.14
. But when God once falls to slaying of such as he is, then he shall hear of
them, not before. In his trouble he will say, Arise and save us Jer. 2.27
.

In prosperity Pharaohs voice is, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice
Exodus 5.2
? Till God has humbled him and pulled down by plague after plague, he never
comes to that, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked Exodus 9.27
. As idle and loose children delight more to be in any company, than to be with
their Parents; but, if they aile any thing, then their Parents shall be the
first that hears of them, so he that has so far played the Prodigal, as one
house could not hold him and his father, when he has spent all, and is ready
to starve, then he comes home with this palinody, Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and against thee, etc Luke 15.18
. When God has hedged his way with thorns, and made a wall, that he cannot
find, or at least go no further in his own paths, then perhaps he will say, I
will go and return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than it
is now Hos. 2.7
. In a word, as Swallows and other Summer-birds come and go, not for love of
the regions, but to avoid Winter, and to follow the Summer. So this hypocrite,
when it is Winter with him, he flies to God and to the Church that he may be in
a warm Sun, and farewell; and as the Persians became Jews, when the fear of
the Jews fell upon them Esth 8.17
. And now crouch upon them, whose throats they had before intended to cut; so
this hypocrite fawnes upon the godly as a great servant to the Church when
himself is in straits, and she in honor, whereas it would be far otherwise, if
their outward conditions were but changed.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Convert, seeks God in prosperity, as well as in
adversity.

Perhaps God was necessitated to handle him as he did Manasseh, to cast him
into chains before he returned to him: but being once returned, he keeps as
close to God when his state is altered, to the best, as when it was at the
lowest and worst; and thereby finds better access and assistance in adversity:
as Hezekiah that could plead his cleaving unto God, not by way of merit, but of
motive only to prevail with mercy for his recovery Isa. 38.2, 3 Lucan.
. It is sometimes in dealing with God, as withmen. Adversity is a fitter time
to use a friend, than to make one. Nulla fides unquam miseros elegit amicos.
Few make choice of men in misery for friends, all though misery sometimes,
compel the miserable to seek new friends. God will not always be found in
misery of those that in prosperity would none of God. Therefore the true
Convert will take all opportunities to come to God before he be forced in by
extremities.

It is too true, and cannot be denied, that diverse of Gods own people do too
often neglect him in prosperity, who y^^ have both truly and faithfully sought
him in affliction; but yet with great difference from the hypocrite, and the
wicked. For, these, in prosperity, neglect him, because they can be content to
live without him, saying to the Almighty, Depart from us, for we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways Job 21.14
. Perhaps they say not so with their tongues, yet they speak so in their
hearts, and by their lives Psalm. 36.1
. But the negligence of Gods children is not from being contented to live
without him, but from having so much to do for themselves, that they mind not
God so much as they ought, and, make too bold with God in omitting of sundry
duties, especially in private, wherein formerly they were more conversant; they
sit more loose from God, they abate of their first love and works. But all this
is but gradual and comparative: they do not wholly cast off the Lord: they
cannot do that. He has so put his fear in their hearts, that they shall not
so depart from him Jer. 32.40
. But they do not seek him so earnestly, and diligently, as in former times,
and as he still expects they should. And therefore God is feign by afflictions
to awaken, mind, and quicken them to their duty with greater care and
diligence; by hiding from them, as they have straggled from him Hos. 5.15
, until they recollect themselves, and say, Come, let us return unto the Lord,
for he has torn, and he will heal us, he has smitten, and he will bind us
up Hos. 6.1
. And so they who performed less duty in prosperity, are brought to profit
more by adversity, and to confess, before I was afflicted, I went astray; but
now have I kept thy Word Psalm. 119.67
. Thus God deals with his own, as some Creditors with a Chapman that is broken
by some accident, he sets him up again, yea, makes him a gainer by his losses;
and, thereby at length recovers his own.

Some have indeed held out from returning to God, until he has caused them to
sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, and to be bound in affliction and
iron Psalm. 107.10
. Yet have truly and savingly sought the Lord in their distress, and have been
pardoned and delivered as Manasseh, the Prodigal, and diverse others: but this
has not been from affliction it self, but from Gods sanctification thereof
unto them: but not all that then seek the Lord, do so seek, or so find.

Affliction in it self does not make men better, but worse, it neither
softeneth the heart, nor opens the ear: men may be punished by affliction,
but not reformed; subdued, but not reconciled. When Israel had played the
harlot and done shamefully, God hedged her way with thorns, and made a wall
that she should not find her paths: but then she followed after her lovers, as
leudly and more madly than before Hos. 2.6, 7
. Thus Ahaz, in the time of his distress, trespassed yet more against the Lord
2 Chro 28.22
. And no wonder, for, the wicked is like the raging sea, whose waters cast out
mire and dirt Isa. 57.20
. The sea casts out mire and dirt at all times, but much more in a storm,
when it cannot rest.

Nor does the hypocrite seek God in affliction as the child of God does. The
hypocrite seeks to God for outward ease and relief, as Pharaoh and Ahab; or for
an outward blessing, as Esau: but the godly, for pardon of sin, mortification
and spiritual grace especially, when driven to God by outward troubles. David
was more importunate for pardon, and cleansing from guilt and sin, than to be
freed from outward shame, or from the sword threatened to his house for his
slaying of Vriah. The hypocrite is all for removing the present plague, the
true Convert, though perhaps he first was driven unto God by the whip of
tribulation, that he might be delivered; yet, being come, he finds other work
to do, and other suits to prefer that may make way for this: as namely, that
God would wash him from his sin, take away his hard heart, open his blind
eyes, deaf ears, subdue his love of the world, and of himself; and, for these
ends, he endures afflictions, and blesses God for them, and prays rather
for the sanctifying, than removal of them.

Also the hypocrite, even in affliction, as Esau, comes too late for the true,
the best blessing: and when it is too late, then though he seek God early, and
outstrip others in outward addresses; yet, says God, he shall not find me
Prove. 1.28
; but, as Christ told the unbelieving Jews, shall die in his sins John 8.24
: The true Israelite seeks the Lord while he may be found, and calls upon
him while he is near Isa. 55.6
: and thence it comes to pass that before he calls, God answers; and while
he is yet speaking, the Lord will hear Isa. 65.24
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a malefactor in a Goal, that never cares for
the King or his favor, till he be in danger of the halter; the true Convert
returns unto God when effectually called, whether in affliction or not. The
one in affliction runs to God, when all other means fail him, as Saul to the
Witch at Endor 1 Samuel 28.8
, to see what he can do for him; the other, in his trouble goes unto God for
pardon of sin, more than for deliverance from the fruits of sin; the one seeks
for ease, the other for the profit of afflictions.

This hypocrite, as he seeks to the Lord for a shift, so he is as ready to
leave him when his turn is served.

He is in and out, off and on; now he seeks, now he shuns the face of God. In
covenanting with God the hypocrite would make the benefit sure, and to have
whatever his heart desires; He is inquisitive to know what he must trust to,
as the Israelites that asked meat for their lusts, Can God furnish a table in
the wilderness? Can he give bread? Can he provide flesh for his people Ps.
78.19.20
? but, reserves a starting hole for himself to go from his word, when he has
gotten from God what he came for: or at least, not searching the bottom of his
deceitful heart, he undertakes more than he through resolved upon or can
perform, and so is feign to dodge, and break with God.

As the bad debtor under arrest, says, I Will pay you the next week without
fail; and the lewd child under the rod, promises, I will never do so any
more: So says this hypocrite; and it may be, he has a little good meaning so
to do, for the present, which makes him never the more a true man, but rather a
deceiver of more, by one, that is, himself: And as they that come into a
dangerous harbor, let fall an Anchor, to wind themselves off upon occasion;
so this hypocrite making a profession of godliness, when he is in some great
distress, leaves open some postern of impiety to slip out at, when he thinks
he has no more need of feigned shows.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian with purpose of heart cleaves to the Lord
Act. 11.23
for ever.

He is the Spouse of Christ, that having once laid hold on him, leaves him not
Cant. 3.4
. It is the condition propounded to those to whom God speaks peace, to return
no more to folly Psalm. 85.8
. This God promises to true Converts, Thou shall call me, my Father, and shall
not turn away from me Jer. 3.19
: for, He so puts his fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from
him. The true Convert leaves God free, but binds himself: he makes a sure
Covenant Nehem. 9.38
: and, if need be, comes up to enter into an Oath and a Curse to walk in Gods
Law Cap. 10.29
. And, he being too conscious of, and privy to his own feebleness and
fickleness, entreats God to undertake the whole work himself, turn thou me,
and I shall be turned Jer. 31.18
; yea, not only to be turned, but to be fast knit unto him, Unite my heart to
thee, that I may fear thy Name Psalm. 86.11
; and that God would keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of
the heart of his servant, and prepare his heart unto him 1 Chro. 29.18
. Thus to cleave unto God, and thus to walk with God without separation or
backsliding.

Thus this hypocrite makes use of God as Asalom did of Joab, to procure his
return from banishment, and afterward set his fields on fire 2 Samuel
, when Joab would not come at him; the true Convert is as Ephraim, even after
conversion, and mercy obtained; goes no more from God, but lays himself lower
before him, smiting upon his thigh; as one still ashamed, yea, even confounded
every day more and more for his former transgressions 14.29, 30
. The one falls off from God so soon as his turn is served; the other cleaves
the closer to God by how much the more God has done for him.

CHAP. XXVIII. The Fearing Hypocrite. Is he in whom fear takes part with
sin. Defin.

THere is a fear of God, which, in the language of the holy Ghost in
Scripture, comprehends the whole body of Religion Deuteronomy. 6.13
, and Practice of Piety Isa. 29 13 Psalm 34.9
; of which, love is the root, and fear the proper Attribute Heb. 12.28
. Herein also the hypocrite seems to partake: for, even the sinners in Zion
are afraid, fearfulness surprizeth the hypocrites Isa. 33.14
: for, the hypocrite that never fears to commit sin, unless when some
judgment is threatened, cannot but fear when sin is committed, and conscience
awakened. All sinners are afraid: but, much more sinners in Zion, because
there, God shines Psalm. 50.2
; yea, burns Heb. 12.29
, where he meets with such briars and thorns, as this hypocrite sets against
him in battle Isa. 27.4
. He is bold and fool-hardie to commit sin, whereby he provokes God, and bids
him battle; and then, so soon as he finds God mustering his forces, so to be
in his march against him, his belly trembles, his lips quiver, and rottenness
enters into his bones, not in hope as Habakkuk Hab. 3.16
; but as despairing of mercy, and crying out, Who among us shall dwell with the
devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

But his fear of God is not on Gods side, but against him, and is an enemy
both to God and himself. For, it is under the command and service of sin,
which first allures, and then affrights, like the old Prophet of Bethel, that
first by a lie, drew the man of God, who had prophesied against Jeroboams
Altar, to eat bread in his house, contrary to Gods command 1 Kings 13.18
, and then prophecieth sharply against the deluded Prophet for disobeying the
voice of the Lord Ver. 20, 21
. This fear is no help to prevent or cure sin, as in the godly; but a means
to increase, and aggravate sin; putting him upon the committing of new sins,
out of a vain hope of avoiding shame or other punishment for sins formerly
committed.

On the contrary, Fear, in a Christian, makes him to take part with God,
Differ.
against sin.

In him, fear is a grace, that promoteth the service of God, and the exercise
of godliness; In thy fear I will worship, says David. It is a bar to sin,
not an instrument of it, a remedy against sin, not an incentive to it, as we
see in Joseph, solicited by his whorish Mistress; How can I do this great
wickedness, and sin against God Genesis 39.9
? The fear of God made him to look upon it as a wickedness, as a great
wickedness, as a sin against his Maker, as well as against his Master; and all
this puts him upon an Interrogation, How can I do it? which argues an
abhorrencie as well as a refusal of it.

Fear quickens him to serve God, and orders him in his rejoicing, whereby he
may do both to the honor of God. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with
trembling Psalm. 2.11
. It is the best companion to pass the time with; it makes a man to pass the
time of his dwelling here in fear 1 Pet. 1.17
. It is the best wisdom, the choicest understanding Job 28.28
; for, by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil Prove. 16.6
: for this is the very genius of it; the fear of the Lord is to hate evil,
pride, arrogancy, and the evil way Prove. 8.13
. So much fear of God, so much hatred of sin, as contrary to the true fear of
God: so much freedom from pride, arrogancy, and every evil way, because fear
makes humble, meek, and careful in all things to walk worthy of the Lord unto
all pleasing.

Thus, this hypocrites fear makes him like Saul, to do what belongs not unto
him, and so to play the fool 1 Samuel 13.12 13
; the fear of the true Christian is like Abigail to David, keeping him from
shedding of blood 1 Samuel 25.33
. To the one, fear is an ignis fatuus, or fools fire that leads, or rather
hurries him into the boggs and pits of sin; to the other, the fear of the
Lord is his treasure Isa. 33.6
, that keeps him far from it.

This hypocrite fears not God, if he can choose.

If he may have his choice, he will never choose the fear of the Lord Prove. 1.29
. Yea, so far is he from making it his election, that he verifieth that which
was unjustly charged upon Job; he casts off fear, he desires to live
without it. Nay, he hardens his heart, as much as he may, against this fear
Prove. 28.14
; yea, even mocking at it, as the horse does the approach of the battle Job.
39.22
, saying among the trumpets Ha, Ha Ver. 25
. He makes many a bulwark and block-house against the fear of God, and has
choice of privy coats to defend himself against it, at least in his own vain
imagination.

He puts on presumption, as a cloak. If God send his servants to threaten
him for his wickedness, in stead of trembling at his Word, he makes a pish at
it; and when he hears the words of the Curse, he blesses himself in his
heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine
heart Deuteronomy. 29.19
. He builds high on a sandy foundation. His presumption is all he has to plead
for his desperate attempts, and this is no other, as one says, than hope out
of her wits: yet this makes him to adventure upon any thing, although it has
in it more of hazard than of use, or hope: so that till God has beaten him out
of all his confidences, and made him to find by experience that he shall not
prosper in them Jer. 2.37
, he is resolved not to fear.

If God let him alone for a while in his sin, without punishment, he boldly
interprets Gods silence, as a connivance at, if not allowance of his
wickedness. These things have thou done, says God, and I kept silence: and
thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy self Psalm. 50.21
. God did it, to see if he would fear him, and by repentance prevent the
plagues; but this he never meant. Have not I held my peace, says the Lord, and
thou fear me not Isa. 51.11
? And so, he verifieth that observation of the Preacher; Because sentence
against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the
sons of men is fully set in them to do evil Eccl. 8.12
; and hence, when once frozen in their dregs, they say in their heart, The Lord
will not do good, neither will he do evil Zeph. 1.12
.

If he observe wicked men to prosper in their wickedness. If he find, or but
thinks he finds that they that work wickedness are set up, and that they
that tempt God are even delivered Mal. 3.15
; especially, if he have had this experience in himself: he concludes that
there is no need of fearing God; but joins with them, who because they have no
changes, therefore they fear not God Psalm. 55.19
.

Yea, he staves off fear of Gods judgments by the multitude of his wicked
mates. I have fellows enough, says he; I do no more than all the world in their
times have done before, and daily do before my face: Will God destroy so many
millions for ever, for a trifle, a small fault, (for so he accounts all sins
that he has a mind to) scarce worth the talking of? Therefore, as malefactors,
(if many) use to grow confident of a general pardon; so this hypocrite grows
bold, upon the innumerable company of offenders in the same kind, not to
trouble himself for what he has done, nor to be afraid of going on in the same
course. This, he the rather does, as persuaded of his own power to repent when
he will, and throw off sin when ever he pleases; and as applying promises, and
only the promises of mercy; (God is merciful, and Christ came to save sinners,)
whereas the portion of such, are threatenings only, and no promises of mercy.
For, God will wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such a one
as goes on still in his trespasses Psalm. 68.21
.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian daily labors and prays for more and more of the fear
of God.

It is his study. He is devoted to it Psalm. 119.38
. It is his choice, unite my heart, that I may fear thy Name Psalm. 86.11
. It is his treasure: he searches for wisdom as for hidden treasures, to this
very end, that he may understand the fear of the Lord Prove. 2.5
, that he may know both the excellency, and the use of it. If it be otherwise
with him, he complains of himself: for no man fears death more than he
fears hardness of heart: Yea, he expostulateth with God himself, so often as
he feels that God restrains the sweet influence of his Spirit in putting his
fear into his heart, Why have thou made us to err from thy ways, and
hardened our hearts from thy fear Isa. 63.17
? This the Church does, not charging God foolishly, as if he led them out of
the way, or put any sinful quality into them, which caused hardness of heart;
but, as bemoaning her self for giving God cause to leave her to the wanderings
of her own spirit, and to that natural frame of heart, that is apt to harden it
more and more.

He fears God upon deliberation, as that by which he steereth all his
actions. Therefore Joseph, after he had put all his brethren into ward three
days, as Spies, to make them taste of his power, who had made him to feel
their tyranny, he at length resolves upon a more mild proceeding, saying unto
them, This do, and live, for I fear God Genesis 42.18
. However they had used him when he was in their power, the fear of God made
him to deal otherwise with them, when they were in his. This fear is his
character by which he would be known, as appears in Job; his friends casting
this in his teeth, Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, the uprightness of
thy ways, and thy hope Job 4.6
? He had given out, that he feared God, and he did so; and upon that ground, he
had promised much unto himself from God, and laid up much hope in God, and
walked uprightly before him. And now being under a world of calamities, his
friends upbraid him with his fear of God, as being not sincere, but
hypocritical and false; as concluding that, if it were not so, these losses and
miseries should never have befallen him; whereas, on the contrary, God suffered
the Devil to lay all this upon him for the trial of his sincerity Job 1.8, 9,
10 11, 12
. The fear of God is his life and livelihood. He can do nothing without it; he
can neither perfect his sanctification, nor work out his salvation, but with
fear and trembling Phil. 2.12
.

Thus, this hypocrite fears God, as the Medes and Persians feared the Jews,
when the fear of the Jews, and of Mordecai, fell upon them Esth. 8.17, 9, 3
: He will fear him, when he dares do no other: the true Christian fears God,
as the wife her husband Ephesians. 5.33
, out of love to obey him: the one fears him, when he sees the sword drawn
against him Numb. 22.31
: the other fears God, because he loves him: the one serves God with a
slavish fear, which love casts out 1 John 4.18
; the other, with a filial fear, which love cherishes most, when love is most
perfect.

This hypocrite, if he must needs fear, fears man more than God.

By his good will, he would imitate that Judge that neither feared God, nor
regarded man Luke 18.2
. But, if the laws, power, or wrath of man be likely to reach him, he looks
about him; although not without regret, that he is kept in awe. He dares to
make bold with God, because he scarce believes there is a God, until he feel
him. But man he fears, because he sees daily how strict he is with others;
and that, many times, his tender mercies are cruel. He knows that the wrath
of a King is as the roaring of a Lion Prove. 19.12
, yea, as the messengers of death Prove. 16.14.
. This therefore he endeavors to pacify. But let God be angry with the
wicked every day Psalm. 7.11
, he regards not, because there is no fear of God before his eyes: for he
flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful
Psalm. 36.1, 2
. He flattereth himself with hope of impunity, because he is sure no eye of man
sees, and therefore no hand of man can touch him; which makes him to adventure
further and further; till at last he proclaim his own shame, by a more open and
shameless committing of evil, which makes him hateful to all.

If he cannot promise himself impunity from man, who bears not the sword in
vain: he then fears; but, it is because of wrath, not for conscience sake
Romans 13.4, 5
. And it is just with God, that he that will not fear God, shall be made to
fear something else: yea, he that fears not God, fears every thing else.
Thus, when Cain had cast off the fear of God, the fear of man, like a tyrant,
seized on him, making him to complain to God, when it was too late, every one
that finds me shall slay me Genesis 4.14
. His own guilt makes him to imagine, that he that had murdered his own
brother, should himself meet with a murderer in every place. And rather than he
will choose the fear of the Lord, he will yet proceed so far in evil, as that
the Lord will force him to fear other things so much, as to flee, when no man
pursues Prove. 28.1
; yea, to be in great fear, where no fear is Psalm. 53.5
.

This God does for the good of humane society, that the fear of man should
fall upon him that will not fear God. This is a snaffle for wicked doers, to
restrain at least, such as hate to be reformed Deuteronomy. 13.11
: and it is a snare (rather than a preservative) to himself that thus fears
man, and will not fear God, making such a Coward desperate, and too boldly to
rush on the pikes of Gods displeasure, while he obeys man, even against God
himself, to avoid the displeasure of man.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian fears God more than man.

He fears God, even when he needs not to fear men, but could make them to
be afraid of him. He will not do evil, although for advantage, and with
assurance of impunity from man: he will do good, though with danger and
disadvantage from man, because he fears God; as Daniel, in continuing his
supplications to God, even when man had made a sharp Law against it Dan. 6, 10
. He so fears God, that he alone is his fear Isa. 8.13
, when others would make him afraid of fearing God. As the three children
feared God more than the fiery furnace, because they feared not him that could
only kill the body; but him, that after he has killed, has power to cast into
hell Luke 12.4, 5
. As one nail drives out another, so Gods fear drives out the unwarrantable
fear of man. Therefore, the Christian fears God, that he may not be afraid
of man, commanding things contrary unto God.

The true fear of God devoures in him all false fears, as Aarons Rod, turned
into a Serpent, swallowed all the counterfeit serpents of the Magicians Exodus
7.12
. The fear of man does but defer an evil work, for want of opportunity to
commit it; but the true fear of God corrects the very evil intent, as well
as the act it self; yea, though there be opportunity, impunity, and advantage
also: as we see in Joseph abhorring the lewd request of his wanton Mistress
Genesis 39.9
. He therefore sets up the fear of God in his heart, that he may not only do
no evil, but hate it: and that this fear may cast out all base fears out of
his heart, which might, in the least, deter him from good, or fright him into
evil.

Thus, this hypocrite is like the Gibeonites, that hearing what Joshua had done
to Jericho, and to Ai, made a league with him Josh. 9.11
, to avoid the dint of his sword; but not with God, whose battles he fought.
The true Christian so fears God, that it makes him to deny himself, (not only
in unlawful, but) even in lawful things, if by using his liberty, he should
oppress others, whom he need not to fear; as Nehemiah, who would not do as
the Governors before him had done, because of the fear of God Nehem. 5.15
: the one fears man, but not God; the other, fears God that he may not be
afraid of man.

This hypocrite fears God unwillingly.

If he must fear God, it shall be when he can stand it out no longer; and,
against his will. The fear of God will be an unwelcome guest. It is as a fit
of an Ague to the body; or, as grief, to the mind: which many are constrained
to harbor, but few bid welcome. Therefore, fear is said to surprise him Isa.
33.14
. It comes upon him as a Sergeant upon a bad debtor; as an armed man upon a
Coward: it seiseth on him as it does on the devils, who are forced to believe
and tremble Jam. 2.19
, whereas they would not willingly do either. Fear has torment 1 John 4.18
, when forcedly wrought by the spirit of bondage: and therefore it can neither
be loved, nor stand with the love of that which is feared.

He is willing to be rid of his fear, and, if it might be, of the object also.
Whom a man fears, he hates, and whom he hates, he would be glad to see
destroyed: at least, he striveth against it, and labors all he can to forget
it. Felix likes well to hear Paul, if Paul will understand the true reason of
his so often sending for him, and communing with him Acts 24.26
: but, if once Paul making him tremble by his preaching; Felix quickly
dismisseth him, Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient season I
will call for thee Ver. 25
: when he had a mind to the Rack again, he would send for Paul to put him upon
it. God is as welcome to him, as Elijah to Ahab 1 King. 21.20
: or, as Christ to the devils coming to torment them before the time Mat. 8.29
. And a day is coming, wherein he will choose rather to speak to the rocks and
mountains to fall upon him, and grind him to powder, than to look him in the
face that sits upon the throne, or endure the wrath of the Lamb Rev. 6.16
, whose nature is not to be fierce.

On the contrary, Differ.
the Christian rejoices to find his heart stored with the fear of the Lord.

He entertaineth it, as the delight of his soul. He would not have it as a
stranger, or as a wayfaring man, that tarrieth only for a night Jer. 14.8
, as God sometimes (in anger) is to his people: but he would have it, to take
up its perpetual habitation in his heart, and he lays it up as his treasure
Isa. 33.6
. It is not, in him, as a short fit of passion, accidentally or unwillingly
seizing upon him, but it is an habit infused of God, and retained by exercise,
wherewith he delights to have his soul habituated, and as it were attired
continually. He is so far from laboring to remove, that he enviteth both the
object feared, and provokes his thoughts to be continually intent thereupon;
the one, by prayer; the other, by meditation.

He looks upon fear, not as his misery, but his happiness, not as his
enemy, but as the best watch to discover the enemy, whereby he may keep the
fort of his soul in more safety. Fear may be a weak soldier, but a good
Sentinel, that will be sure to cry, a Lion, my Lord, as standing continually
upon the watch tower Isa. 21.8
. It is not sluggish, but provokes to industry, and makes him to work out his
salvation with fear Phil. 2.12
, to come short of it Heb. 4.1
, and, with trembling, to neglect any means to attain it. Timorous Tully was
as useful to his Country, as resolute Pompey, or valerous Caesar. And true
fear is as serviceable to the soul to give warning of enemies; as faith, to
open the door to friends.

Thus, this hypocrite entertaineth fear as the Citizens of Gadara, or
Gargasenes, did Christ; they came out to meet him, but they no sooner saw him,
but they besought him to depart out of their coasts Mat. 8.34
: they had soon enough of him: the true Christian entertaineth it, as Abraham,
the Angels, whom he ran to meet upon a better account, saying, My Lord, if I
now have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy
servant Genesis 8.2, 3
. The one entertaineth fear, as a fury to torment him; the other, as a friend,
to direct him.

This hypocrite fears God only as a Tormentor.

He looks upon him with the eye of a malefactor that has not gotten his
pardon, (nor endeavored it) upon his Judge, or the executioner. Or as men
naturally fear devils, or as devils fear God: for the fear of hypocrites and
devils is all one. His fear is (...). such a timidity as un-mans a man, making
him stupid, and sluggish: Or it is (...), a kind of superstitious panick fear
causing terror, and to look upon God as terriculamentum quid, as some dreadful
thing, as some Mormo among the heathens. A fear that makes him to run from
God, as Adam, in the Garden Genesis 3.8, 10
.

And indeed, how can an evil conscience think of God, without horror? Guilt
looks upon God as an angry and as a mighty enemy, When the impure, unjust,
false hypocrite shall look upon the purity, justice, wrath of God, the truth of
his threatenings, and unavoidablenesse of his just judgment and vengeance; what
a plight must he needs be in! How can he but tremble, and be at his wits end
for fear P^al. 107.^7
! And it is just with God, that he who while he heard of mercy, feared not, but
grew bold upon God, not as upon a friend, but rather as a weak and indulgent
enemy: should ever after look upon God as a consuming fire Heb. 12.29
, not to refine, but to burn him, without hope of mercy.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian fears God for his mercy.

He is not ignorant of the terrors of the Lord 1 Cor. 5.11
; yea, he only, knows rightly, the power of his wrath Psalm. 90.11
: and forgets not to tremble when the Lion roareth Amos 3 8
, not against him, but his enemies, as Habakkuk H^b. 3.16
. Howbeit, if none of this were so, if God tell him, Anger, or fury is not in
me Isa. 27 4
, this will not abate, but rather increase his fear of God; he will fear the
Lord more by how much he has found more mercy; and, thus interprets all that
he hears, all that he tastes of mercy, there is mercy with thee that thou
may be feared Psalm. 130.4
.

Thus, this hypocrite fears God as an enemy, the Christian fears him as
his best friend: the one fears as looking for nothing from him but evil; the
other fears him for his goodness, and as expecting nothing but good.

This hypocrites fear is slavish and legal.

It is natural to all men (Christ himself not excepted) to fear harm, pain,
sorrow, and whatsoever is an enemy to Nature. Nature it self recoileth and
starteth back from whatsoever annoyeth it. This is a fear that is incident to
the godly, as well as to the wicked: and is not the fear that is here
intended. This, man was endowed with in his Creation, and is no fruit of his
transgression, in the nature of it.

There is a fear also that is natural to all sinners, to fear and shun Gods
Presence and Justice, as Adam, so soon as he incurred guilt, he purchased shame
and fear, and hid himself from God Genesis 3.10
. Cain, after did the like: and so will all, till God speak peace by Jesus
Christ. Natural conscience alone is able to conjure up this spirit, when none
else accuses, if permitted to do its office Romans 2.15
: how much more when God, by the operation of his own Spirit arraigneth the
sinner, causing conscience to give in evidence according to the Law, and
convincing the sinner by the light of the Law, that he is in himself a lost
man, that can expect nothing but hell and damnation as the fruit and wages of
his sins.

This is that legal and servile fear, that makes men to see their bondage to
sin and Satan, and to fear God as slaves that expect nothing but the whip, or
halter: This the Holy Ghost works, by setting on the terrors of the Law upon
the transgressors of it, and awakening and inciting conscience to affright and
terrify the sinner, that he may go out of himself, and seek remedy in Christ,
or perish for ever. And for this, is the Holy Ghost called a spirit of bondage,
which causes fear Romans 8.15
, and torment 1 John 4.18
.

But, the fear of the hypocrite is yet, in the issue at least, more slavish
than that of the common sinner, when after all his trifling and dallying with
God, God presents himself, as a devouring fire, and as everlasting burnings
to his soul Isa. 33 14
, that has sinned against knowledge, and against the light not only of nature
and conscience, but of the Law, yea, and of the Spirit of illumination it self
Heb. 6 4
. Then he comes to be afraid with a witness: and the more, because a sinner of
Zion, that in the land of uprightness has dealt unjustly Isa. 26.10
; even when he professed to walk uprightly, and pretended to be a great servant
of the Lord. His fear therefore must needs be such as excludes faith, whereby
he is ranged with the unbelieving, that are excluded heaven Rev. 21.8
: for an hypocrite shall not come before him Job 13.16
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the fear of the true Christian is filial and Evangelical.

He first underwent the spirit of bondage, and has tasted deeply of legal
fear in his first repentance and conversion: nor is he yet wholly freed from
it, because still clogged with remains of corruption: for, sin not being
perfectly abolished, conscience cannot be absolutely pacified; yea, any sin in
him creates him more violent convulsion fits of fear, than to other men who
have not tasted so largely of the love of Christ. Therefore he says unto God,
my flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments Psalm.
119
, and prays, in wrath remember mercy Hab. 3.2
. But there is great odds between him and the hypocrite, in the matter of his
fear.

It is in the Christian ever mixed with filial fear, which makes him to fear
God as a Father, with more care, and so gets into the room of the other fear
which can no more have entire possession of him. This legal fear is not now
his temper, but an accident; not his food, but his medicine. It makes way not
for desparation, as in the wicked, whose fear shall come upon them; but for a
further work of the Spirit of adoption, and liberty, giving him, upon the
renewing of his repentance, new evidence of Gods love in the pardon of the sin
that did affright him, and more strength against it for the time to come. It is
as the needle to make way for that thread by which he is more strongly fastened
unto Christ: by bondage he comes to liberty, by doubting to assurance, by legal
terrors to Evangelical consolations.

It is such a fear as drives him, not from God, as it did Adam, but unto God,
as we see in Moses, who though he were feign to cry out, I exceedingly tremble
and quake Heb. 12.21
, yet he drew nearer unto God, when God commanded his approach Exodus 19.20
; And even when he says, Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of
polluted lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts Isa. 6.5, 7
; yet he started not, but stayed by it, until he had received a gracious
answer, thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged Isa. 6.5, 7
. Although he be too weak to contest with God, yet he flies not, but lays
hold on mercy, and is forgiven his iniquity. So that, this return of legal
fear, at times, to the Christian, is but as the Shepherds dog, that never is
let loose upon him, but when he strugleth; and then, perhaps, nips him by the
leg, but tears not out his throat. It may make him smart, but not wound him;
or if it bite deep, yet the wound is healed, before it be festered; and, he is
made a gainer by it, before he part with it.

For however, legal fears may sometimes, haunt a Christian, like a fury;
especially when he grows careless, and apt to backsliding; yet, even after
deliverance from Gods wrath, by the blood of Christ, and the evidence of pardon
witnessed by his Spirit, it is not incongruous, nor unprofitable for him to
fear. For, whether he consider the case in which he once was, fear ends not
with the danger; nor shame, with the pardon of sin Ezekiel. 16.63
. Even among the effects and testimonies of repentance, fear has her place 2
Cor. 7.11
. Cassander is reported to have trembled at the sight of the Statue of
Alexander, when he was now dead, and Cassander had gotten the Kingdom of
Macedonia, and Dominion of all Greece: so the Christian, when the quarrel is
taken up by Christ, the conflict of conscience ended, and all reconciled, is
yet sometimes troubled at the remembrance of God, even when he is pacified
toward him Psalm. 77.3
. Or, whether he consider his present condition, he is not without cause of
fear, for that he dares not stand to a legal trial, when he is at his very
best Ps. 130.3.143, 2
: nor is he at all times sure that he has arguments enough to assure himself
that judgment belongs not to him: his salvation is not finished without fear
and trembling. Much is required to answer Satan and his own conscience, before
he be able to master all doubts about his translation from death to life. To
say nothing of his beholding the judgments of God upon others, and to hear the
threatenings thundered out against such as he is not able to accuse of half the
evils that he knows by himself. If the Lion roar, who will not fear Amos 3.8.
? If the father be angry with his servant, the child cannot but tremble.

Howbeit, even at his lowest ebb, and strongest paroxysme of fear, filial
fear has ever the rule of his heart. His fear is (...), reverence and godly
fear, heedful observance, out of honor and love Heb. 12.28
. A fear that makes him to honor God, not to hate him; to cl^ave to him, not
to depart from him. This fear is proper; the other, but accidental; this is
predominant, the other subservient. This fear is joined with faith, although
the other muster up all the doubts it can in him, and ends in despair in others.

Thus, this hypocrite fears God, as Saul feared the Philistines, ready to
break in upon him 1 Samuel 13.12
; the other fears God, as the Israelites feared Joshua, all the days of his
life Josh. 4.14
; and that was, to do all that he commanded them, and to go whithersoever he
sent them Josh. 1.16
. The one fears him as a tyrant, the other as a father.

This hypocrites fear dismayeth, astonisheth and confounds him.

It is to him like the falling sickness that makes him altogether insensible;
or like the pangs of death. His fear is an horror of conscience, making both
soul and body sick: it takes away not only comfort, but health, and sense. It
is like a clap of thunder that both terrifieth, and stupifieth. It makes so
amazed, that he lets the enemy, Satan, to do what he will to him, and with
him. It is a fury that begets a frenzy. Thou shall be mad for the sight of
thine eyes which thou shall behold Deuteronomy. 28.34
. It changes the very name of the wicked man into Magor-missabib, one that is
a terror to himself, and to all his friends Jer. 20.3, 4
.

Within him is the earthquake of an evil conscience; over him, the heavens are
in a flame of fire, ready to rain rivers of brimstone upon him, as once upon
Sodom; under him, hell gaping to devour him; on the right hand, Christ the
Judge, with all his holy Angels and Saints to condemn him; on his left hand,
the devil ready to drag him into hell, there to torment him for ever. Thus,
terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet
Job 18.11
, the firstborn of death (that is, the devil, who first sinned) shall devour
his strength Ver. 13
. It is not a fear that quickens to industry for preventing the thing feared;
but a fear that unlooseth the joints, making altogether unfit for duty: yea,
it sometimes bereaves of life it self, as we see in Ananias and Sapphira. It
does prosternate without recovery.

Differ.
On the contrary, the fear of a true Christian quickens him to duty.

His fear does not contract, but dilate his soul. He finds the truth of that
promise, thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged Isa. 60.5
. It is a watchful guard to keep all safe, a wellspring of life to depart from
the snares of death Prove. 14.27
. It makes him to depart from evil, and so is health to his navel, and marrow
to his bones Prove. 3.7, 8
. It makes not less valiant, but more considerate, and therefore more
confident; In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence Prove. 14.26
. As the Zealanders, fearing the sea, make all safe; so the Christian by fear
secureth himself from the sea of sin, and gulf of damnation.

Thus, this hypocrite fears God as Belshazzar did the hand that wrote upon
the wall, his thoughts troubled him, the joints of his loins were loosed, and
his knees smote one against another Dan. 5.6
. The true Christian fears God, as the mariners that cast Jonah into the sea,
which thereupon ceased her raging; they offered a sacrifice unto him, and made
vows Jon. 1.16
. Fear in the one is without faith; and so, as physic, without help of nature,
heals not, but kills: fear in the other, is as physic unto nature, able
to close with it, and so is recovered by it.

This hypocrites fear is but a flash.

It is a sudden fright, rather then a settled fear: and he is scared, rather
than humbled. When God flasheth terrors in his face, he is then low before the
Lord, as Ahab, threatened by Elijah 1 King. 21.27
. If God speak by an handwriting from the wall, he may change countenance, and
be exceedingly troubled at the present. But it never reduces him to a breaking
off of his sins by repentance, because it is not in him an habit, but as a
blast of wind or a flash of lightning, as soon gone as come. While the
Schoolmaster shakes his rod, and begins to lay on the idle, and unruly, the
leudest boy in the school, begins to shake: but so soon as the correction is
over, he is the same he was. So it is with the hypocrite who seems to be on
the sudden much affected; but, the object being once out of sight, his fear is
at an end.

Contrarily, the true Christian fears always Prove. 8.14
. Differ.


It is in him, a grace infused and settled by God in his heart, to this very
end, that he may not depart from the Lord Jer. 32.40
. It therefore must needs be perpetual. It is an individual companion that
goes with him into all places and companies. I thy servant, says Obadiah to
the Prophet, fear the Lord from my youth 1 King. 18.12
. The true Christian is in the fear of the Lord, as in his proper element, (as
the fish in the water, out of which he cannot live) all the day long Prove. 23.17
, Not that a Christian always in the same degree fears God: but he has
always the same seed of God abiding in him. The cords of his fear may be
slackened, but they are never cut. He is always afraid to offend, even while
he offends: and if his fear be not strong enough to keep him from offending,
yet it fails not to make him careful to reconcile himself unto God.

Thus, fear in this hypocrite, makes an inroad, or sudden incursion, where it
intends not to stay; fear in the true Christian is as a standing garrison that
is never removed. In the one, fear is as the mushroom that shoots up in a
night, and dies before the next evening; in the other, it is as the fire of the
Sanctuary that was never to go out.

This hypocrites fear is of punishment, not of sin.

He fears God, as a malefactor fears the Judge: not as fearing to commit
sin, but as afraid of punishment for sin committed. He is afraid of God as of
an enemy, yet is not afraid to make him an enemy, or to use God as an enemy, or
to be himself an enemy to God. He fears what God in his justice and wrath
will do unto him, but never fears him so as to avoid what may draw his
justice and wrath upon him. He fears not his Precepts, so as to obey them: he
only fears his judgments due for disobedience; and therefore wishes he could
either disarme, or escape him, rather than submit unto him in the way of his
judgments.

He is affected to Gods justice, as malefactors are to the justice of their
Prince; not to love them for it, but rather to hate them for fear thereof,
wishing to him, and it, weak hands, blind eyes, or lame feet, rather than
laboring to avoid that which may make him to fall under it. Or, if he be
afraid of sin, it is only for the punishment which it draws after it. He would
not fear sin, unless he were to feel the smart of it. Sin is to his palate
a sweet morsel, which he likes well; but, if he forbear it, it is for fear the
reckoning will be too heavy. Let any but secure him against punishment, and he
will never be afraid of the greatest wickedness in the world. He fears only
devouring fire, and everlasting burnings Isa. 33.14
. If he can but keep his skin whole, fear he that will.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian fears sin as the greatest punishment.

He fears more to be given up of God to his own hearts lusts (so as to walk
in his own counsels Psalm. 81.12
) than to all the enemies he has in the world. To him there is no judgment so
great as the want of grace, and especially of the fear of God. Take this from
him, by the want whereof he should go astray from God, and he accounts himself
undone. For this, he cannot forbear expostulating with God himself, Why have
thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our hearts from thy fear
Isa. 63.17
? He had rather suffer any thing than be exposed to this judgment.

He fears himself, least he should fall into sin, and thereby do wrong to
God, and harm to his own soul, more than he fears all the judgments which
God inflicteth upon sinners. He fears the sin of an Oath, (although now,
custom, Eccl. 9.2
in old and young, men and women, to the shame of all ages, sexes, and ranks of
men, have taken away the shame of it, in the account of the world) more than he
fears God as a swift witness against his swearing Mal. 3.5
. He is ashamed of sin Romans 6.21
, more than of punishment. Yea, shame to him is better than fear; or rather
the best fear; because ingenuous shame is not without fear of turpitude, but
fear of punishment is too often found without shame to sin.

Thus, this hypocrite when some judgment stands in his way, ready to seize
him, says unto God as Balaam to the Angel, that stood with a drawn sword to
kill him; Now therefore if it displease thee I will get me back again Number. 22.34
: the other, even when no judgment is near, prays with David, Keep back thy
servant from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me Psalm. 19.13
: The one cares not what sin he commits, so he may be free from punishment; the
other cares not what affliction he undergoeth, so he may be free from sin.

This hypocrites fear banisheth love.

He fears not God, but as an enemy; and therefore upon the same account
cannot love, but hate him. Such fear, and love cannot stand together in the
same soul, no more than darkness and light in the same horizon. In prosperity
he will seem to love God, because he interprets Gods bounty as a fruit of his
love; but then he fears him not. In adversity he will seem to fear him, but
not love him; because he looks more upon the terriblenesse of his judgments,
than upon the sweetness of his nature. He is himself an enemy to God, and
therefore cannot but hate him, by how much the more he is compelled to fear
him. He is not acquainted with the love of God, therefore he cannot love God:
for no man loves God, but whom God loved first 1 John 4.10
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christians fear arises out of love.

He loves, and honors God with all his heart, and with all his soul, even
when God deals most sharply with him Isa. 26.9
: therefore he cannot but fear to wrong, or offend him. If he cannot find him
in the night of affliction, yet even then will his Spirit within him, seek him
early, which argues love, even when he cannot find the love of God shining
forth upon him. Whom we seek, we love; especially, if we give not over seeking,
where we at present find no answer of love. He fears God, not as an enemy,
but lest he should lose a friend, and make an enemy. When the hypocrite flies
from God, because of punishment; he cleaves closer unto God that he may learn
by his rod to offend no more. All love has some jealousy attending upon it,
and jealousy has fear. But the Christians fear and jealousy is merely of
his own want of worth, and care to walk worthy of him whom he loves for
himself: Such fear, the love of God admits; and the rest, by degrees, it
casts out 1 John 4.18
.

Thus, this hypocrite fears God as Ishbosheth feared Abner 2 Samuel 3.11
, whom he hated for his design against him; the true Christian fears God out
of love, as the converted thief upon the Cross, out of love to Christ, even
then, when, for Christ's sake he endured the dolorous death of crucifixion Luke
23.40, 41
: the one fears God, because he hates him; the other, because he loves him.

This hypocrites fear provokes him not to good.

He is never the better for his fear, but rather the worse. It does not
quicken him to duty, but rather makes him heartlesse, dull, or desperate. It
does not keep him off from sin, but only troubles him in sinning. He is shaken
in sinning, but not for sin: or, if for sin; yet, not from sinning, but rather,
to thrust him the deeper into sin, as a tree shaken with the wind, roots the
faster. Fear is both the first and last effect on a wicked man's conscience, as
may be seen in Felix, who trembled to hear of the judgment to come Act. 24.25
, yet settled again nevertheless on the lees of his former intemperance and
unrighteousness.

Yea, this fear makes him more desperate in evil, and stiff-necked in sin,
as Cain who ran away from God with this bit in his teeth, when he had never so
much need of him. It made him to go out from the Presence of the Lord Genesis 4.16
, when he had never so much need to seek his face. It makes him to seek shifts
and fig leaves, when he has made himself naked, that he may pertegere peccata
peccatis, cover over one sin with another. Much ado he has to get fig leaves;
and may he get them, he cares for no more. Any thing is welcome to him but
repentance.

On the contrary, the Christians fear makes him better. Differ.


It teaches him to eschew evil, and do good Psalm. 34.1.14
. It makes him truly wise, that is, so to fear, as to depart from evil Prove.
14.16
, while the fool rages at any check to his lust, and is confident of breaking
through all opposition. His fear keeps his heart soft and supple, it makes
it to melt, as it did the heart of Josiah. It is as the mortar and pestle to
the spice, making it more fragrant and useful, by beating it to powder by true
contrition. The terrors of the Lord 2 Cor. 5.11
quicken him to duty, while they amaze others, and take them off from
obedience. It makes him diligent, while the fear of the wicked makes him
stupid.

Thus, this hypocrites fear is as a resty horse that goes backward upon the
spur, or desperately runs his Rider upon ruin. The true Christians fear
is as Balaams Ass, that will rather lie down under his Master, than expose him
to hazard by carrying him further upon the sword of the Angel Number. 22.27
. To the one it is as a cudgel to a tired jade, that makes him lie down; to the
other, as a spur, or switch to the metled horse, or as a rod to the idle
scholar.

CHAP. XXIX. The Patient Hypocrite Is he that sets a demure countenance upon a
froward heart. Defin.

PAtience is a virtue of that use and necessity, that, without it, no man can
possess himself, although he should be possessor of the whole world: by it, a
Christian possesses his soul Luke 21.19
with comfort, when the world has left him nothing but persecution and misery
for his portion. Therefore, as the Christian endeavors to store himself with
this grace, as hav^ng more daily use of this, in reference to the world, than
of any other, (except faith, which keeps life in his patience;) so the
hypocrite striveth to be the true Christians Ape in this, as well as in other
endowments. Yea, in this he more seriously labors, because his own
discretion and experience cannot but tell him, that there is no living without
it; unless so, as death would be chosen rather than life Jer. 8.3
.

But as we see in plants, fruits and herbs, there is a vast difference between
such as industry, care and Art have planted, or sown in Gardens, and those
that are wild, and grow naturally in fields or woods, without any such culture
or cost bestowed upon them; which makes them upon the matter, oft-times,
differ specie, to differ in kind from the other: so is it here. The
hypocrites patience is of another kind, a mere counterfeit that the Spirit of
Christ never planted; a kind of wild patience, like to the true, in some
outward show, as hemlock is to parsley; but, proceeds from, and serves only
to cover a froward heart, which, early or late, is found lodged in the bosom
of every hypocrite, of every evil doer Prove. 3.32 Psalm. 18.26
.

This froward heart, void both of righteousness and true holiness, the
hypocrite endeavors to cover with a vizar of patience: where patience may
commend him unto men, or promote some other design of his own. And whereas
impatiency and anger discover themselves, for the most part, by the
fierceness, or discontent of the countenance, and looks; this hypocrite
seeks by all means to cover his inward fretting and frowardness, by putting
on a serene and friendly countenance thereupon, as Cain did upon his inward
discontent and rancour against his brother, till he had gotten him into the
field, where he fell upon him, and slew him Genesis 4.8
.

But, as he that hides hatred with lying lips Prove. 10.18
, and lays up deceit within him, when he speaks fair, is not to be
believed, for there are seven abominations in his heart, which wickedness God
will one day discover, and cause to be showed before the whole Congregation
Prove. 26.24 etc.
; so this hypocrite shall be unmasked as Haman was, notwithstanding all his
courtly carriage and complements toward Esther the Queen, whom he had destined
to death as well as Mordecai, at whom he conceived so much indignation, that no
less than the destruction of the whole Nation of the Jews was able to pacify
it. Yet he carried it smoothly, accepted of the Queens invitation, and after
gloried in it Esth. 5.13
, that none could suspect the least discontent to lurk in his bosom; so
exactly did he refrain himself, and temper his countenance, till his pride and
inward rage and fury grew ripe for a discovery, that soon ended in his own fall
and confusion.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is patient in heart, and endeavors to
let patience have her perfect work there.

He has brought his heart to take up the yoke of Jesus Christ Mat. 11.29
, which yoke is by Christ himself declared to be his meekness and lowliness
of heart, which ever produce patience, as the genuine daughter of both the
former. He is meek, that is of a quiet spirit. Therefore these are joined
together 1 Pet. 3.4
. He is meek, that is, calm, without storms within, as well as without. There
is a calmnesse in his heart, as well as in his countenance; Meekness is a
moderation of anger, therefore near of kin to patience. All the difference
between them is but this; Meekness is a moderation of anger, Patience is a
subduing of it: Patience makes a man quietly to stand under the burden laid
upon him, Meekness makes him not only quiet in suffering, but tractable to
learn of God, and to follow God, even while he suffers. Patience allayeth
wrath; Meekness prevents it.

This Lesson he has learned of his Master: not to color, or cover; but, to
cure his passion, and to cast out that unruly beast of anger raised in his
breast; his discretion, putting him on to exercise this grace of Patience. For,
the discretion of man (says Solomon) deferreth his anger Prove. 19 11
, not only for a time, as watching a better opportunity, as Esau did for
killing his brother Jacob Genesis 27.41
: but, for ever, as looking to God who appoints, rather than man that
inflicteth that trouble and sorrow which exercises his patience; resolving to
bear the indignation of the Lord Mic. 7.9
. And he looks to man the instrument, with pity rather than revenge. For,
said his Lord before him, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do
Luke 23.34
. By patience, he brings forth fruit, to wit, obedience to the Word Luke 8.15
: by this, in the sharpest persecution, he possesses his soul, even while
others torture his body Luke 21.19
. This is the patience of the Saints, even of them that keep the Commandments
of God, and the faith of Jesus Rev. 14.12
.

Thus, this hypocrite puts on patience for his upper garment, as Tamar
covered her self with a veil, that she might conceal whom she was Genesis 38.14
. The true Christian takes in patience as a cordial to his heart, and is
careful to get it to work kindly within, before he endeavors to show
patience without: the patience of the one dissembleth anger; the patience of
the other, removes it. The patience of the one, is but a work of the flesh:
but of the other, a fruit of the Spirit Gal. 5.22
.

This hypocrites patience is both cowardly, and desperately impatient.

He seems resolute to undergo any thing; but when he sees whereto he must, he
will rather endure any thing than bear what is coming toward him. If death be
before him, he will prevent it, by doing execution upon himself, to avoid the
fear of death by the hand of another. If reproach haunt him, he will choose
rather to die than to bear it: He thinks it to be very noble patience to
undergo death of his own choosing, when yet he is so impatient of disgrace,
that he will rather die than endure it. He is of Saul's temper, if he must die
by the hand of the Philistines, he will rather fall upon his own sword, and be
his own murderer 1 Samuel 31.4
. Or like Abimelech, that will rather be killed twice over, than that men
should say, a woman slew him Judge. 9.54
. Or as Cato, (so renowned by the herein foolish Seneca Epist. 104
) who chose rather to kill himself, not only by sheathing his sword in his
body, but tearing his bowels in pieces with his own hands, than be at the mercy
of Caesar for his life. Plut. in Cat.
Of whom Caesar, more wisely said, O Cato, I envy thee thy death, seeing thou
have envied my honor of saving thy life.

Such carriage ill deserves the name of Patience, which is rather a desperate
foolhardinesse proceeding from want of patience and magnanimity to bear what
is, or may he inflicted: This is impatience in the highest, which while it
seems to be above patience, falls infinitely below it. It argues an inability
to bear, not patience to suffer: He is patient that bears most from others,
without imposing upon himself, to avoid what others inflict. To throw off life,
rather than endure the weight of another man's hands, argues a seeming valor,
but, is indeed a real pusillanimity, which every Coward may reach unto by
laying violent hands on himself. He spoke no less wisely than truly, who said;
Rebus in adversis, facile est contemnere vitam.
Fortiter ille facit qui miser esse potest.
In deep distress, it is easy life to slight:
He manly does, that can bear heaviest weight.


Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christians Patience makes him to bear quietly whatever God inflicteth.

Patience delivers him up to God, to be at his dispose, to bear any thing
whereby any honor redounds to God. He will not be his own carver, unless to
choose to fall into Gods own hand, rather than into the hands of men 2 Samuel
24.14
. He will not indent with God, what he shall suffer, or how long. Let God
inflict both what he will, and as long as he will. He conditioneth not to be
kept from this affliction, or that trouble: to suffer in his goods, not in his
skin or carcass; for a day, or short time, but not longer.

If God suffer him to be laden with reproaches unjustly, he bears it. If his
adversary write a book against him, he will take it upon his shoulder, and
bind it as a Crown unto him Job 31.35
. He remembers who has said, Fear not the reproach of men, neither be afraid
of their revilings Isa. 51.7
. Not that he sleighteth reproaches cast upon him for sin: for, these he
prays against Psalm. 119.22
: Nor reproaches cast upon God, for these do even break his heart, he cannot
bear them Psalm 69.20 and ver. 9
. But he accounts that reproach precious which falls upon him for well-doing,
or for the Name of Christ; therein he accounts himself happy, as having the
Spirit of glory and of God resting upon him Acts 20.25
.

He seeks not affliction, neither will he shun it. If the sorest plagues
befall him, he will choose rather to die under them, than by death of his
procuring rid himself of them. He will not turn himself out of Gods service
to save his life Acts 20.25
, but rather rejoice to part with it in, or for Gods service, and rejoice to
see it so well bestowed Phil. 1.17
. He accounts it great impatience to desire to die, to be freed of Gods
service, or of suffering for it: but, to procure death, upon such account, he
abhors it as manifest rebellion. This were to yield up the Kings fort, for
fear of a siege.

Thus, this hypocrite in seeming to abound in patience, by bearing even death
it self of his own inflicting, to avoid a less evil imposed by others, shows
the greatest impatience; being able to bear nothing but what he list, not
unlike Ahitophel, who chose rather to end his days in an halter, than to bear
the disgrace of not giving good counsel 2 Samuel 17.23
, The true Christian patience appears most, in not daring to do any sinful
act, to avoid the heaviest trouble laid on him by God; but, as Job, abhorres
the motion, by whomsoever made, and whatever he suffer: The patience of the one
is but Cowardice made desperate; the patience of the other prevents desperate
courses of Cowards.

This hypocrites patience is most what affected.

It is a needless, or causeless, (and therefore bootlesse) patience. Either
vainglory, or the strong and bewitching persuasions of others (for their own
ends) makes him desirous, and ambitious to suffer; as the Popish
Pseudo-Martyrs who pretended suffering for their Religion (or rather
superstition) when all wise men know they are executed for treason; and as
they, whose affectation of Martyrdom the Apostle hinteth, where, he says,
though I give my body to be burnt 1 Cor. 13 3
. Vainglory sometimes chooses rather to burn, than to glorify God by a holy
life; not considering that it is a greater evidence of sincerity to live
according to our Religion, than to die for it, until God call us out to seal
his truth, and to end an holy life together, for some holy ends of his own, not
for glory to our se^ves.

Perhaps an opinion of merit may make him willing to undergo voluntarily, what
he would be loath to suffer upon any other account: as some Papists who whip
themselves and impose on themselves other voluntary and arbitrary
chastisements, as ^h^nking ^^er^by to save God a labor; holding this to be a
work of more than meri^, a^beit they be herein equalled, if not exceeded, by
the Priests of Baal 1 King. 18.28
. But he that takes upon him to be wiser, or stricter than God, will not fail
to show his ^olly in m^king it (as he thinks) good, by an affected suffering
more for his own sake, than he is willing to undergo in obedience to God. He
will afflict his soul by fasting for strife and debate Isa. 58
: when otherwise, he would choose rather to pamper his body, to provoke to sin.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the Christians patience is truly passive.

He will not p^ll sufferings upon himself, but suffer when God calls him to it.
He is not fond of affliction, as affecting occasions to show his patience; but,
if the Will of God be so; and, if need be 1 Pet. 1.6
, he is content. Sometimes it pleases God to advance the Gospel, and the
common cause of Religion, by the persecution of a few: As, by the persecution
against the Church which was at Jerusalem, that scattering of the Saints
throughout the Regions of Judea and Samaria Acts 8.1
, was a me^^s of the Conversion of this City Ver. 5.25 and 40.
, and many more: so that as he said, the way to bu^ld Italy, is to build
Millain, (because in this City were the most and best Architects;) so the means
to spread the Gospel, where before it had not come, was the scattering of the
^^ints from Jerusalem, that they might be forced abroad, and build in other
places.

It is som^times incident to the choicest Saints, if God erect a Church so pure
in all things, as scarce any can parallel it, to desire to dwell there all the
days of their lives, to behold the beauty of the Lord there shining forth in
greatest brightness P^^^. 27.^
; but God sees it better perhaps, to disturb and scatter them, that they may
go abroad, and give milk to babes in other places, than to let them always
feed in a fat pasture at home, where they communicate to none but to one
another 1 The^. 5.11
: With respect to this and other services of the Church, holy men have been
contented, (when fired out of their former ease, and sweet repasts in the
Church of God*) to wander up and down without house or home, and (if the Will
of the Lord be so) not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, or any
where, for the Name of the Lord Jesus Acts 21 13
, that Christ may be magnified in their mortal bodies Phil 1.25
, and that the Church may be confirmed by their offering up themselves upon the
sacrifice, and for the service of the common faith Phil. 2.17
. Neither are they proud of these their sufferings, but are willing, even then
to call to mind their own sins that might justify God in his sharpest
proceedings against them, and to stop their own mouths for ever from
clamouring against such his dealing with them, which their own sins might
justly bring upon them: and therefore take up this resolution, I will bear the
indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my
cause, and execute judgment for me Mic. 7.9
?

Thus, this hypocrite offers himself to suffering, as Saul's Armor-bearer,
that would needs kill himself to bear his Master company 1 Samuel 31.5
. the true Christian is ready to suffer imprisonment, bonds and death; but not
till God call him to it 1 Pet. 3.17
. The one affects to suffer what he might avoid, the other is content to
endure what God will have him suffer; this therefore is Christ's Martyr, the
other is his own butcher.

This hypocrites patience argues him rather proud and spightful, than patient.

He would be thought patient, but his patience is full of pride, as disdaining
his enemy; and so, he rather scorneth, than suffers: and what he bears, is
from pride, and haughtiness, not patience. He is so far from letting patience
have her perfect work, that he never knew what true patience meant. And whereas
he should, as he pretends, exercise patience, he rather acts proud King
Turnus, who being enraged by the too bold speech of Drances, (whom he looked
upon, and ever hated as a Coward) persuading him to make his peace with Aeneas,
then in Italy; and having heard that Drances had given out before, that so he
meant to handle Turnus, Licet arma sibi mortemque minetur Aeneid l. 11
, although the King should threaten him with sword and death for so doing:
Turnus scorned to touch him, as being too unworthy a subject for him to defile
his hands with all, and therefore after a sharp reproof, put him off with this
disdainful close.

Nunquam animam talem dextra hac (absiste moveri)
Amittes; habitet tecum, and sit pectore in isto.
Fear not, so base a soul, by this right hand of mine,
To lose: dwell let it still, in that vile breast of thine.
Contempt, says the Philosopher Rhet. l. 2. c. 3
, expels anger; but this, for the most part, is spiteful, and intends
revenge, even when he seems to take no notice of the wrong. Such was the
scornful patience of Socrates, who unto the young man that railed on him, gave
no answer but this, I will not kick the Ass that has kicked me; which was so
well set on by him, and seconded by others, that he that reviled him, being
generally derided, went and hanged himself. Not much unlike to this, was that
counterfeit patience of Cato, who being by one abused, that ask't him pardon,
denied that he had done him any wrong; that he might not be thought to be at
all moved at it.

Yea, sometimes this hypocrite takes himself to be patient, because, when
provoked, he fights not, nor uses all the extremity that he could, when yet
his speech, gesture, and behavior argue an heart boiling with unquietness and
envy within, as Absaloms did toward Amnon. For though he seemed to pacify
Tamar, whom Amnon had ravished; Hold now thy peace my Sister, he is thy
brother, regard not this thing 2 Samuel 13.20
; and, in show, took no notice of it to Amnon himself, speaking to him neither
good nor bad, for two years together Ver. 22, 23
; yet he hated Amnon, because he had forced his Sister. And afterward under
color of a Sheep shearing feast, got him to his house, made him drunk, and
then slew him by the hands of his servants Ver. 28, 29
.

Sometimes his patience is nothing but stoutnesse of heart, that for reputation
of magnanimity, will not take knowledge of an injury, as Saul, when some
children of Belial after his election to be King, said, How shall this man save
us, and despised him, bringing him no Presents; Saul held his peace 1 Samuel 10.27
: not out of any true patience enabling him to bear such an affront, but out of
greatness and height of spirit to take no notice of the contempts of such base
spirited men.

On the contrary, true Christian patience banisheth pride and rancour, Differ.
and does good for evil.

The Christians patience comes down from above, and therefore is like the
founder: It accounts pride and rancour, (the hypocrites supporters) to be as
great enemies, as revenge it self; the patient in spirit being opposed, and
preferred to the proud in spirit Eccl. 7.8
. The patient Christian does not only suffer at the hands of his persecutors,
without seeking revenge; but, prays for them, and blesses those that curse
him: Yea, he blesses, and curses not Romans 12.14
. This he accounts to be thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God,
endure grief, suffering wrongfully 1 Pet. 2.19
. Patience is much mistaken; much belongs thereunto, which the world little
thinks of. Patience can never have her perfect work, without wisdom; no wisdom
is to be had without prayer; no prayer, without faith 1 Pet. 1.4, 5, 6
.

And as patience is the gift of God, so is it the Christians conformity with
the perfection of his heavenly Father Mat. 5.48
, a main part of the imitation, and a fruit of the Spirit of Christ Ephesians. 4.32
. Magnanimity makes a fair show of patience, yet it is but a vizar of pride
put upon the spirit of revenge: for such men, sparing in their retail, promise
themselves revenge in the gross: as Haman, by forbearing Mordecai made way to
the destruction of the whole Nation of the Jews: and Caesar seemed very
patient toward Cato, and sundry other particular persons, without revenging
himself on them for opposing his ambition, that he might with less envy,
bring under his yoke the whole Roman Empire.

A base mind may bear quietly, because it apprehends not the injury. The
weak and impotent is wise enough to see the wrong, but dares not to take notice
of it: the strong can contemn, or defer, or put it in the deck; but not
digest it. Only the true Christian truly overcomes evil with goodness, by
patient bearing the evil, and cordial doing of good.

Thus, this hypocrite is a Court-enemy, that is quiet and still till he be able
to strike home to purpose. The true Christian is the true friend that then
shows most patience when he is able to take sharpest revenge: the one as
Haman, thinks scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone, without destroying the
whole race of his people Esth. 3.6
; the other is as David, that spares his mortal persecutor Saul, even when it
was in his power to kill him 1 Samuel 26.8, 9
. The one suppresseth his wrath, to give it more vent afterward; the other
only attaineth that glorious victory, of an enemy to make a friend, not only to
himself, but to Christ also, for whom he patiently suffers.

This hypocrites patience is patience perforce.

If there be no way to avoid it, no revenge to be taken, he seems patient,
and to be quiet; but, his patience is no other than a fretting, pouting
patience; which the less it breaks forth in action, speech, or gesture, the
more he inwardly chafeth, and suffers the fire of vexation even to consume
his heart. Persuade him to patience, his answer is, What would you have me do?
I neither fight, nor chide, I say nothing, etc. When every one that sees him
may behold in his countenance, evidence enough of fretting within. And, he that
fretteth, does evil, and does not cease from anger, nor forsake wrath Psalm. 37.8
.

He suffers by compulsion, as a malefactor that quietly lies down upon the
block, without resistance, or show of impatiency, but it is because he cannot
avoid it: he knows if he did not so, he should be compelled: and so he is
quiet, not from any ground of patience; but, partly out of shame least it be
said of him, he was afraid to die; and partly out of self-love to avoid greater
torment in dying. Thus any man may quietly suffer poverty, sickness, death it
self, quietly, when there is no remedy; yet be far from beating any of these
with patience, even when he seems most patient.

Differ.
Contrarily, the Christian is willingly patient.

That tribulation which brings forth patience, makes him by experience, to
arrive at hope, which makes not ashamed Romans 5.3, 4, 5
. This can never be but where affliction is sanctified: but, being sanctified,
patience will soon have her perfect work. For then, the Christian sees love in
correction Prove. 3.12
, and finds profit by suffering Ps. 19.67, 71, 75
. He now comes to discern that God chasteneth him for his profit, that he may
be partaker of his holiness Heb. 12.10
, therefore he faints not, when chastised by him, but kisseth the rod, as
blessing God for it.

This patience makes him keep the peace also, not only with others, but with
his own heart. For, while he waits patiently upon the Lord, he will not fret
himself because of him that prospers in his way Psalm. 37.7
; he preserves the tranquillity of his mind, as well as his charity; not only
not revenging, nor reviling, but forgiving, and loving his enemies, yea,
praying for them. By this means is he Master of himself, and in the way to
master others, that otherwise could master him, upon this very account that he
is not his own Master.

Thus, this hypocrites patience is like that of Simon of Cyrene, whom Pilates
soulpiers compelled to bear the Cross of Christ, when they led him forth to
crucify him Mat. 27.32
, he was forced to do it whether he would or not: the true Christians patience
is like that of his Lord, who when he was to undergo the sharpest brunt,
professed to his Father, I delight to do thy Will, O my God Psalm. 40.84
: the one puts on the garment of patience, as a malefactor, his shroud, or
winding sheet, when he is going to execution; the other puts it on as an
ornament wherein he delights always to be found.

This hypocrite is quarrelsome in the midst of his patience.

He will so endure, that he will not omit to complain he is wronged, or at
least accounts himself so to be, although, perhaps not injured at all. Either
he suffers wrong, or would be thought so to do. And this he will take notice
of, that you may take notice of his patience; although his very complaining
argues the contrary. Sometimes he forbears not God himself, as if God had dealt
but hardly with him: and then, he commends his own patience, by saying, I am
a poor man, I take it patiently; when yet his wealth is more than he will be
known of, or than he means well to employ. And as for his neighbor, he says
of him, he has done me wrong; but I must forgive, and forget; when yet no
wrong is done, but some just reproof perhaps is given him, or he has recovered
his own, wrongfully detained by this patient wrong doer.

Contrariwise, the true Christians patience is very peaceable. Differ.


He desires not to quarrel with any, but to follow the things which make for
peace Romans 14.19
. If offense be offered him, he forbeareth, and forgiveth, where he has just
matter of quarrel against any man Col. 3.13
. And as for God, he resolves neither to open his mouth, nor to bear the least
grudge in his heart against him, let God deal how he will by him. He will
justify God against all the objections of his own heart, The Lord our God is
righteous in all his works which he does Dan. 9.14
. It is his mercy that we are not consumed Lam. 3.22
. And unto men, rather than hold contention, he says, I am as ye are, ye have
not injured me at all Gal. 4.12
. He rather burieth the wrong as having not been at all, than to maintain a
just quarrel any longer with them. At least he commits all to God, his
cause, his soul, and all, in well doing, not in a way of quarrelling. For well
he knows, that, Patientiae Sequester Deus, God is the Solicitor for patience,
(as Tertullian speaks) with whom he is sure he may safely trust both himself
and cause.

Thus, this hypocrite is like the men of Ephraim quarrelling with Gideon, even
when they had cause to thank him Judge. 8.1
. The true Christian is as Gideon, pacifying the Ephraimites, even when they
gave him cause to chide them; by attributing his victory to them who never
struck blow in the cause Ver. 2, 3
: the one quarrelleth, while he proclaims peace; the other is for peace,
while others denounce war Psalm. 1^0.7
.

This hypocrites patience is stinted.

For some time, and in some things, if you try him, you may find him patient;
otherwise, not. He may bear a little at first; but, if the trial last too long,
farewell his patience. If he pray, and God answer him not speedily, his patience
is spent 2 King. 6.33
. If he fast, and find no present fruit of it, he is apt to quarrel with God
for doing him wrong Isa. 58.3
. Saul will tarry seven days, expecting the coming of Samuel, according to the
set time appointed by Samuel; but, no longer 1 Samuel 13.7, 8
. His fear now mastered his patience, and made him to play the fool, to the
loss of his Kingdom Ver. 13, 14
. This hypocrite at the beginning of a sickness, or other calamity, will do
somewhat in praying to God, as Saul forced himself, and offered a sacrifice,
but, if the affliction continue, he is soon weary and tired, his patience is at
an end, he will not always call upon God.

In like manner, when he has to do with men, if the offense be but small, he
may be patient: but not if the injury be in his opinion too great to be borne.
He will patiently bear, till you touch him on the right vein. If profit be
his darling, he will give you leave to do almost any thing to him, so you touch
him not in that: if honor, be his Mistress, beware how you touch the hemme of
her garment; if pleasure be his God, you must not in the least, offend him
therein. Whatever he makes his idol, that above all must not be meddled with,
at your peril; (for, this cost the Baptist dear) in other things he can better
bear.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christians patience is long-suffering.

As David's kindness was the kindness of God 2 Samuel 9.3
, because he showed it in obedience to God, and took God for his pattern in the
showing of it; so the Christians patience may be called the patience of God:
because as God is long-suffering 1 Pet. 3.20
; so he in all things desires to be. If the Lord should seem to us to be
slack, (which he is not, as some men count slacknesse ^ Pet. 3.9
, who set God a time, and leave him not to his own;) yet, he believes, and
therefore will not make haste Is^ 28.16
, to be relieved or delivered by any other hand, or means, as impatient to
wait the Lords leisure any longer. Patience has hope, and what he hops for,
he does with patience wait for it Romans 8.25
And this is no more than needs, that after he has done the Will of God, he
may inherit the Promises H^b. 10 26
. He dares to trust God upon his word, when even a wretched Balaam, as well as
Samuel, cannot but confess, that God is not as man that he should lie, or the
Son of man, that he should repent Number. 23.19 1 Samuel 15.29
. He therefore concludes, the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the
end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, he will wait for it, because
it will surely come, it will not tarry, one hour beyond the time appointed of
God Hab. 2.2
.

And as his patience presumes not to stint God, in setting God a time, so
neither does it desire to make man his own carver in the afflictions which he
suffers. If God give him the choice, he thankfully accepts it, and casts
himself (wisely) into his own hands that gave him the election 2 Samuel 24.12 14
: otherwise, he desires not to be his own choser, nor dares to make
exception. His patience under the hand of God, flows from love to God, which
bears all things inflicted, believes all things promised, hops all things
believed, endures all things till God take them off 1 Cor. 13 7
. He is not as they, who cry out, If God had laid on me any Cross but this, I
could have borne it better. I should never have complained: but this, is beyond
my strength: but rather says with Hezekiah, good is the Word of the Lord
denouncing Isa 39.8
; and with David, good is the hand of the Lord infl^cting Psalm. 119.71
; not an affliction of man's choosing, but of Gods own appointment Mic. 6 9
. He knows God is wiser than he, and better knows where to strike, and how
to strike him, to let him blood in the right vein, and wherein his patience
may be most seen, and his faith best tried; as Abraham's, in the offering of his
Isaac; and Job, in suffering the devil to fall upon his body, as well as upon
his estate and family.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Ozias and the men of Bethuliah, who set God a
day, by which h^ should either supply them with water, or destroy their enemies
that beleagured them, or otherwise they would shift for themselves without him
Judeth. 7.30
. The true Christians patience is like that of the husbandman, waiting for the
precious fruits of the earth, having long patience for it, until he receive the
early aad latter rain Jam. 5.7
. The one will pick and choose, or fly in the face of God; the other desires
God to choose for him, and therein patiently bears the hand of God.

This hypocrites patience is stupid and senseless.

Either he is a Bedlam, or a Sot; a Fury, or a Stoic; a Lamech Genesis 4.23, 24
, or a Nabal 1 Samuel 25.3^
. He is all in extremes. We take him here as a fury mastered, as a wild bull
in a net that can struggle no longer; as a Nabal that has lost his wits, when
he comes to reflect upon his carriage toward David, while he was out of his
wits in his drunken fit. Or, as a Stoic, who glories in being (...), void of
all passion or perturbation. His patience is a mere (...), a privation of
passion, and of all feeling, wherein some have gone so far, as to say of
torment, O quam suave hoc! This is a thick-skinn'd patience, the patience of a
post, rather than of a man, and a sure symptom of a foolish, as well as of an
hard and brawny heart, Nulla virtus est, quae non sentias, pati Seneca.
. It is no virtue to suffer, what thou have no sense of; to be patient under
that which thou feel not at all.

Affliction does rather dull, than quicken him, astonish than awaken him. If
God send a cruel enemy against him, to devour him with open mouth, yet he
turns not to him that smites him, neither does he seek the Lord of hosts
Isa. 9.12, 13
. Tell him, destruction is determined against him, he is no more moved than
Nabal that became as a stone. Nay, he glories in this that he does not, cannot
feel, or fear any thing; as some, that have dead flesh, will give any body
leave to pinch it till he be weary. This argues a conscience seared with an hot
iron 1 Timothy 4.2
, rather than an heart sensible of the hand of God upon it.

Contrarily, the true Christian is sensible of what he suffers, Differ.
even when he is most patient in suffering.

If he suffer under the more immediate hand of God, although he take up this
resolution, I will bear the indignation of the Lord; yet he desires to be
deeply sensible of that h^^d, when it does but gently prick him with a pin, as
well as when it makes a deeper wound with a knife, or sword; that being
humbled under a smaller judgment, he may prevent a greater. Thus Aaron was
sensible of Gods hand upon his Sister Miriam, when but smitten with leprosy,
for a season Number. 12.11, 12
: as well as when God came nearer to him, in devouring his two sons, Nadab
and Abihu, by fire from the Lord, for offering strange fire before the Lord
Lev. 10.1, 2
. In this greater, Aaron was patient; for, he held his peace Ver. 3
: but, in both, sensible of his displeasure who inflicted both.

In injuries from men, none has better discerning, or quicker feeling of wrong
than he; not, as unable to bear, or as being revengeful; but as best able to
judge of wrong, and knowing what he suffers. He bears much, and forbeareth
more; yet he knows both what he bears, and what he forbeareth to take
notice of. And, although he be content to let fall all thoughts of private
revenge, and to forgive the offender, and patiently suffers; yet he looks
up unto God in his sufferings, and there finds cause enough to behave himself
patiently toward God and man, leaving the cause to God, who judges
righte^usly 1 Pet. 2.23
.

Thus, this hypocrites patience is like that of the drunkard, whose language
after a drunken fray is; they have stricken me, and I was not sick; they have
beaten me, and I felt it not Prove. 23.35
: the Christian Patient holds it meet to be said unto God, I have borne
chastisement, I will not offend any more; that which I see not, teach thou me;
if I have done iniquity, I will do no more Job 34.31, 32
: The one bears as a stock or stone, but feels not the burden, and
therefore profits by neither; the other feels what he bears, and so profits
by both.

This hypocrites patience is base and servile.

He suffers what he needs not, and at whose hands he should not; when yet he
would be very unquiet to bear half so much; where there is more reason for his
bearing. Sometimes fear makes him bear like a slave, not only the buffettings,
but the lusts of men, whereby he sins against God. Sometimes, hope of gain
or compassing his own ends, makes him bear, like a Parasite, or covetous
muckworme, that will let any man ride him who will pay him well for the
journey: Sometimes superstition makes him lay down his back to be sadled and
laden by a Popish Priest, bearing any thing at the hand of a Shaveling, be his
impositions never so unreasonable, and his pennances never so intolerable. But
he will not suffer any reproof, or admonition from a faithful Minister, that
never meant to impose any such burdens, but only seeks to reduce him into the
right way, whereas the other leads him further aside, and so does him more
mischief than he did to himself; as he that ministers wrong physic,
endangereth the Patient more than the first disease.

He is sick of an old disease, which fools may call patience; but wise men see
to be folly. It is such a patience as makes him (if he be religiously inclined,
and not well instructed, or but seemingly religious) to suffer, if a false
teacher bring him into bondage, if he devour him, if he take of him, if he
exalt himself; yea, if he smite this Simpleton in the face 2 Cor. 11.20
, who yet will bear nothing at the hands of his own Pastor, be he never so
able, sound, and industrious for the good of the flock: no more than the
Corinthians would bear at the hands of Paul, yet willingly endured any thing
from false Apostles.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the Christians patience is free and ingenuous.

He is content to suffer what God requires, not what tyrants illegally impose,
and fools undergo. He loves to see by what authority he suffers, though it
be abused. He will not suffer as a fool, even where he is content to suffer as
a Christian. He will imitate him, that in the midst of all his patience, was
sensible of the unreasonablenesse and illegalnesse of a blow given him upon his
face, without warrant of that Law by which he was then to be tried; although he
were content to suffer more than the Palm of an hand, in a more legal way.
Therefore he answers resolutely, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the
evil: but, if well, why smitest thou me Joh. 18.23
? He knew how to suffer, and that with patience: but, not to suffer as a fool,
without reproof of the fool that smote him.

The like afterward was his carriage to Pilate, who vaunted much of his power
to release, or crucify him. Christ, who was willing to lay down his life for
his sheep, and that under the sentence of Pilate, lets Pilate know, that he was
much mistaken, if he thought he could do any thing against him, further than
was before determined in heaven; and he, permitted to execute that
determination. Thou could do nothing at all against me, except it were given
thee from above. Therefore he that delivered me unto thee, has the greater sin
John 19.11
. The High Priest did, or might have known whom Christ was, and that it was not
in the power of man to put him to death, without God. He that had prophesied,
as High Priest, and gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one
should die for the people John 18.14
; should have done better than to have delivered up the Lord of life to him
that could not take life from him, but by power from heaven; which must needs
be a greater sin, than if the same offense had been done by one ignorant of
both these truths.

The Christian will patiently suffer, when, after a lawful defense, he finds
himself overborne by injustice and violence: but he will omit nothing that is
honest and lawful to prevent an unjust suffering, Thus Paul, who was ready not
to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the Name of the Lord Jesus,
omitted nothing that might make for his just defense against unjust
proceedings; as a Roman, he might plead his Burgesseship of Rome; Is it lawful
for you to scourge a Roman, and uncondemned Acts 22.25
? by which means he escaped (for that time) a sharp and ignominious whipping.
Afterward, when the High Priest commanded him, contrary to Law, to be smitten
on the mouth, Paul made so bold as to tell him, God shall smite thee, thou
whited wall: for, sit thou to judge me after the Law, and command me to
be smitten contrary to the Law Acts 23.2, 3
? Again, when he found by Festus, that the Jews had solicited to have him
tried at Jerusalem, on purpose that they might now, (as they had before agreed
Ver. 12, 13 etc.
) kill him, before ever he should come to his trial, (as they would have done
before, had not the plot been discovered) he therefore to prevent that
butchery, not to shun suffering, appealed unto Caesar Acts 25.11
.

No Law of patience, or of God, allows man to neglect his lawful defense, or
the putting off unjust suffering by the help of justice, if it may lawfully be
obtained: But if justice it self be made a party against him, he obeys the
Ordinance of God, and suffers the abuse of man.

Thus, this hypocrites patience is like that of the Ass, that lets fall his
ears when his back is over-loaded, and stands still while the Wolf worrieth
him; the patience of the other, is like that of Abner 2 Samuel 3.33
, that would not die as a fool, or, as Nabal, (as the Original has it) even
when he fell by the treachery of Joab. Nabal indeed was a true picture of this
hypocrite, whose base spirit died within him, at the very news of a
threatening; but Abner, the Emblem of a Christian, that will sell his life as
dear as he can, unless circumvented by guile: the one suffers any thing but
what he should, the other will suffer nothing, but what he ought, till justice
it self he oppressed as well as he.

This hypocrites patience is idle and sluggish.

Sloth dissolveth the vigor of not only the body, but of the mind; and so,
mere sluggishnesse and laziness makes many a man to bear what else could not
be born. The sluggard had rather be tossed in his bed, than to be at pains to
rise to save himself in a storm; and chooses rather to sleep in the top of a
mast Prove. 23.34
; and so to hazard himself by one blast to be thrown over into the sea while he
is sleeping, than to be at the labor of coming down while he is awake.

This luskish disposition this hypocrite would have to be taken for patience,
for his patience consists of nothing else. If he be in an Office, or a
Magistrate, his carelessness and dullness in punishing offenders must be
interpreted gentleness and compassion, meekness and long suffering, whereas
indeed this is merely a neglect of public good, to gratify his own private
ease and sloth: and he declares plainly, that he is more a friend to
wickedness, than a mirror of patience; and had rather suffer the disease to
spread, than to stir up himself to apply the remedy: when he in his own private
case can be vindictive enough. So it often happens, if he be in the Ministry,
that he may be accounted mild, and patient, he will rather let his people die
quietly in their sins, than trouble himself or them so far, as to give them
such a rowsing warning as God requires.

Sometimes there is another reason of this kind of patience, which the world
is not aware of, as bad as the other. For, if by just occasion he be put upon
the clearing of himself from some foul imputations, he will seem to bear that
reproach (whcih he calls injurious) with patience, rather than be troubled to
vindicate himself: whereas indeed it concerns him much, to endure an
uncertain report, rather than by stirring too far, to bring the truth of his
wickedness to light, whereof before there was no certain proof. Therefore he
rather prefers a self-guilty patience, which is a cleanly means to avoid
the discovery of guilt, to a diligent Inquisition.

On the contrary, true Christian patience is active and diligent. Differ.


Whatever comes from the Spirit must needs be of an active nature: therefore,
patience, if true. This makes a man as careful to do the Will of God in what
belongs to him to be done, as to suffer the Will of God by exercise of his
patience, in bearing what God imposes. Patience has her work Jam. 1.4 (...).
, as well as her burden: an hand to act, as well as a back to bear. If she want
either, she is a bastardslip, no fruit of the Spirit.

The Christian will not therefore be so ambitious of the name of a patient man,
as to be without the nature. He neglects not public service, although it
should be much to the disturbance of the patience of others, to preserve his
own quiet and security. In his own personal wrongs he uses patience, as the
best remedy, if there be hope of cure; but, where the wrong concerns God, or
the public, he accounts it a sin to use more patience than by Law is
prescribed. Therefore, being in place of Government, he scatters the wicked,
and brings the wheel over them Prove. 20.26
: yea, he makes haste to cut off all wicked doers from the City of the Lord
Psalm. 101.8
. And, being a Minister of Christ, he cannot bear them that are evil Rev. 2.2
; but, with the two-edged sword of the Word and Discipline, executes upon them
the judgment written Psalm. 149 9
.

Thus, this hypocrites patience is like that of Gallio, that, when the Peace
was broken before his face, at the very Judgment Seat, cared for none of these
things Acts 18.17
. The patience of the Christian is like that of Nehemiah, who in his own case
was so patient, that he was content to be without the Governors allowance,
because the bondage was heavy upon the people that should have contributed to
it Neh. 5.18
; yet, in the cause of God, was so active, that he contended with such as
profaned the Sabbath, and had married strange wives, and cursed them, and
smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair Neh. 13.25
, he being a Magistrate, and their Governor: the patience of the one is like
that or Judah, who when news was brought him that his daughter-in-law Tamar
was with child by whoredom, his sentence was, bring her forth, and let her be
burned Genesis 38.24
: but when it was discovered by whom she conceived, he made no have with the
execution* but reversed the judgment: the true Christians patience is then
most active for God, when it bears most for Gods sake, and puts God to bear
most for his sake.

CHAP. XXX. The Obedient Hypocrite Is he that marreth a good work in the
making, Defin.
or doing of it.
HE knows that God stands upon obedience more than sacrifice, and, that where
sacrifice is not seconded by obedience, the sacrifice is rejected 1 Samuel 15.22
: therefore this hypocrite is as officious in professing obedience, as he seems
devout in matters of worship. He is that younger son that, being commanded by
his father to go and work in his vineyard, with much observance, says, I will,
Sir, but, went not Mat. 21.30
. By him, Christ held a glass to the Scribes and Pharisees, in which they
might behold the true visage of themselves; as this hypocrite also may. None so
forward as they, not only by word, but by show of action, to do the Will of
God, insomuch as they affected the engrossing of a^l Piety and Religion, among
those of their own Order; yet, in true performance, came behind very
publicanes and harlots Ver. 31, 32
.

He sets upon obedience (in show at least) with great cry and noise of
forwardness: but parturiunt montes, etc. the birth answers not expectation:
either, he does it not; or, not as he should, and professes to do it. So the
Israelites of old made Moses to believe that all that the Lord should speak
unto him, they would hear it, and do it Deuteronomy. 5.27
. They spoke as much as men could; and God seemed to be much taken with it, so
that be not only commended their Profession Ver. 28
, but, speaking after the manner of men, he promised himself much from them:
for he said, surely they are my people, children that will not lie; so he was
their Savior Isa. 63.8
. But the performan^e was nothing, but rebelling, and vexing his holy Spirit
Ver. 10
. So this hypocrite raises a mighty expectation, but satisfies not.

A bungler does but disparage a work of worth by undertaking it, and marres it
by his manner of doing of it: much more does a false-hearted pretender disgrace
obedience unto God, when he makes great shows of that which he never meant nor
was able to perform. Many such pretenders there are in Christianity, that hold
forth the leaves, but deny the fruits of obedience; that would gladly reap the
comforts of mercy, but will not be at the pains of expressing the power of
grace. Of which number this hypocrite makes one.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian goes through with the work of obedience.

He does the work of the Lord cordially, and with all his might. If he cannot
do it so exactly as the Law requires; yet he does it so sincerely that it is
accepted of the Lawgiver. His heart is faithful, although his hand be weak; he
is as the good servant, that does the Will of God from the heart Ephesians. 6 6
; He obeys from the heart Romans 6.17
, whatever God gives him in charge, be it believing doctrines delivered, or
doing of other duties enjoined.

He so works that he graceth the work, and the work praises him in the gates
Prove. 31.31
; God is pleased highly with his obedience, even when men take no notice of it,
unless to cavil, as the devil did at Job. Nor can men who judge righteous
judgment, justly find fault, or say that he dissembleth, fumbleth, or does
the work of the Lord negligently, but must give testimony for him, that he
works righteousness with all his might: yea, when he suffers most for
well-doing, he gives not over to do well. When his faith is most put to it, by
persecution, even then the trial of his faith is much more precious than of
gold that perishes, and is found unto (even his) praise, and honor, and glory
at the appearing of Jesus Christ 2 Pet. 1.7
.

All his works are not alike excellent; yet, all, sincere. They are ex eadem
officina, out of the same shop of a true heart. All coins are not alike fair,
yet all come from the same Mint, and bear the same stamp. There is no man that
lives and sins not 2 King. 8.46
, some mixture there will be of his own corruptions even with his best
obedience: but, here there is sincerity ever prevailing, and that makes the
work acceptable to him that tries the heart, and by the heart judges of the
work, pardoning the imperfection, where he finds uprightness of heart, and
an heart will ing to seek God, and to serve him to the utmost of his power. Here
God spares him as a Father spares his son that serves him Mal. 3 17
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul, who having done what he list, and so much as
he thinks fit, will say it, and stand in it, I have obeyed the voice of the
Lord; and have gone the way which the Lord sent me 1 Samuel 15.20
; Let Samuel, yea, God himself say what they please to the contrary; the true
Christian is like Gaius, he does faithfully whatsoever he does 3 John 5.
. The one is an eye servant, that seeks to put God off with eye-service: the
other is a servant that shows all good fidelity Tit. 2.10
, obeying in all things, not with eye-service, as a man-pleaser, but in
singleness of heart, fearing God Col. 3.22
.

This hypocrite will obey, but not with denial of himself.

If he obey, it must be in his own way. If God would lop off his fair top of
natural reason, wisdom, opinion of his own self-sufficiency, he cannot bear
that. Let God but tell him what he will have done, and leave the rest to him.
He knows how to order the work, and in what manner to do it. He will have his
own way, as Saul in destroying the Amalekites. Gods charge was utterly to
destroy all; to spare no man, woman, or infant, ox, sheep, camel, or ass 1 Samuel 15.3
. Saul goes about it, but when he comes to perform it, he will do so much as in
his wisdom is necessary, taking himself to be wiser than God in executing Gods
command. Agag being not a common person, was not so fit to be slain among the
vulgar, the glory of the victory would be greater, to bring him home in
chains, and to show him to the people; after which God might do with him as he
pleased. Saul supposed also, that after such a victory God would expect a
sacrifice of thanksgiving; and what beasts so fat and goodly as the best of the
Amalekites cattle? so that to this part of the command of sparing none, Saul in
effect says: No, some wiser than some.

Again, what he does for God, he will do as now he is. It is in vain to
persuade him, that he must be circumcised in heart to love God Deuteronomy. 30 6
, regenerated, set into Jesus Christ, that he must be content to have his
gallant top of nature to be cut off; and himself to be cleft, and riven, that
Christ may be graffed in; he cannot hear on that ear: he thanks God he has
loved God with all his heart, and served him truly ever since he could
remember, and doubts not but to obey God as well as the precisest Puritan of
them all. If he may set about Gods work as he is: he is content. Otherwise, the
work must lie undone, for him. This was the great quarrel of the Pharisees
against Christ, Are we blind also John 9.40
? Are none able to see and discern the things of God, but such as receive new
eyes from thee? So Nicodemus himself, before his Conversion, thinks strangely
of Christ's speech, touching the necessity of the new birth; Can a man be borne
when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mothers womb, and be
borne Joh. 3.4
? The natural man will none of that. If God will accept him as he is, well and
good: if not, he is now too old to be taken in pieces, and made new.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian rejoices to do Gods work in Gods way; and to be
cast into shape that God pleases, for the better doing of it.

He is convinced, that he that will indeed obey, must obey throughout, or he
were as good do nothing; and he must be made new throughout, or he is nothing,
he can do nothing. It is in this as in offering sacrifice of old, when there
was not a perfect conformity, for matter, manner, and qualification of the
person sacrificeing, to the Will of God; He that kills an ox is as if he
slew a man; he that offers a Lamb, as if he cut off a dogs neck, he that
offers an oblation, as if he offered swines blood: he that burns incense,
as it he blessed an idol Isa. 66.3
. He must be qualified, he must be punctual in following Gods rule, or he
obeys not, but rather rebelleth against God, as Saul in the instance before
given, when it came to be tried by the Touchstone of the Sanctuary 1 Samuel
15.22, 23
.

He rejoices to part with nature for grace, with blind eyes for seeing eyes,
with his native pride for better fruits; miraturque novas frondes, and non sua
poma. He admires the new leaves and fruit that grow on his withered stock: and
says with joy in his heart, in reference to spiritual generation of new graces
in his soul, who has begotten me these; seeing I have lost my children, and am
desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? And who has brought up these Isa
49.21
? He knows the fruit cannot be good, if the tree be evil: and that there is
the same necessity of making the tree good, as there is to make the fruit good:
for, a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit Matt 7.18
. He therefore never accounts that to be obedience which proceeds not from an
heart renewed by grace, be the work never so splendid and glorious.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a self-willed servant, that must have his own
will and way, or else will do nothing, or do it so, that it were better he had
done nothing; the true Christian is like Moses, that makes all things according
to the pattern showed him in the Mount Heb. 8.5
; the one, under color of obeying God, obeys his own will, the other
renounceth his own will, that he may obey God.

This hypocrite is set on work by others, but expects wages from God.

He never works for God as set on work by God, but as employed by others, to
work what, and how they direct. Rather than fail, he sets himself on work on
that which God never commanded, yet looks God would accept and reward it, as if
he had commanded it. He puts the question to himself, or rather to his fancy,
Wherewith shall I come before the Lord Mic. 6.6
, etc. (as if God had not long before showed him plainly enough what he
requires of him.) A thanklesse service, wherein a man advises with, and
seeks to please, not his Master, but himself. He cares not for offering to
the Lord at Jerusalem, according to Gods Rule and Will; but, if Jeroboam set
up a Calfe at Bethel; that, for his money: for this likes you well, O ye
children of Israel, says the Lord God Amos 4.5, 6
. But such obedience procures no better reward, than cleanness of teeth, and
want of bread. Let God speak, he will not hear: but he will certainly do
whatsoever goes forth of his own mouth Jer. 44.16 17
. Yet, if God reward him not very bountifully, he will be very angry Isa. 58.3
.

If others (like himself) prescribe him a course of obedience, and a fear
toward God after the Precepts of men Isa. 29.18
; He will here be as forward as any to obey and fear God, although no reason
of the command appear to him, but the will of his Superiors. Blind obedience,
and blind faith are the two paths in which he delights to walk. He fears not
the ditch, until he be in it, no more than Judas dreamed of the halter, until
he had betrayed his Master.

If a Jeroboam or his successors give an injunction for change of Religion,
Ephraim, the whole body of the people will readily and willingly obey, although
they smart for it: Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he
willingly walked after the commandment Hos. 5.11
. No commandment in the things of God, is so willingly obeyed, as the
commandments of men; and those most, who are most contrary to the commands of
God. And just it is with God to make those whom men study to please by sinning
against God, under color of obeying him, to be sad scourges to such blind
Bayards, even in matters of civil justice and judgment.

None are so great Innovators in matter of Religion, as Usurpers of the Civil
Power; ^or are any so great oppressors, and heavy scourges to the people in
Civil affairs, as they who make most bold with God in the things of God: yet
no people more forward to obey the precepts of such Usurpers, in such matters,
than the generation of hypocrites that care for no religion or obedience to
God, but what is most in request with their greatest oppressors. For, the
statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab Mic. 6.16
. Omri (who had been General, and was after m^de King of Israel, in the Camp,
to he revenged on Zimri that slew his Master 1 King. 16.16
) did worse than all the Kings that were before him Ver. 25
: and afterward Ahab, his son, did evil in the sight of the Lord above all
that were before him Ver. 30
: for these, especially the later, beside the golden Calves of Jeroboam,
worshipped Baal Ver. 31
. In which idolatry the people readily followed the steps of their Kings,
(although to their own confusion) having now a liberty granted them to worship
which of those idols they pleased.

Thus the arch-hypocrites Rival, Ignatius Loyala, tells the Portugal Jesuits,
parendum Pontifici non solum abdicatione voluntatis, sed etiam (and maxim)
judicii. Perit illa celebris obedienti^ caecae simplicitas, cum apud nos in
questionem vocamus, recte ne praecipiatur, an secus. The chief Bishop must be
obeyed, not only with abdication of our wills, but also (and that chiefly) of
the judgment. That famous simplicity of blind obedience is lost, when we once
come to question, whether he did well or ill in giving out such a command as he
calls us to obey. The sum is, Be sure to please the Pope, and then, for
Christ let it be taken for granted that he cannot be displeased.

Yea this hypocrite is sometimes set on work by Satan, who insinuates himself
into his imaginations, or the directions of those by whom this hypocrite is
willing to be led blindfold. The simplicity that is in Christ is too mean, too
plain for his ambition. He will rather choose to obey in things contrary to
God, in hope to do God good service, if he who would devour him, shall so
persuade. Yea, he will now place perfection of ob^dience in murdering of
Princes, undermining of States, sowing discords, wars, parricides, lies, and
equivocations amongst brethren. This (O blasphemy!) is counted obedience to
God, and a conformity to the obedience of Christ himself: And (O folly!) this
fool acts it, and expects a reward in heaven for it. And (O shame!) this
malefactor fuffering by due course of Law and Justice, for treason and
rebellion, is enrolled for a Saint and Martyr. What greater blasphemy, than to
place obedience, and the imitation of Christ, suffering upon the Cross, in
murders, parricides, treasons; and, counting legal and deserved executions, for
notorious treasons, to be more than meritorious Martyrdomes.

Contrariwise, the true Christians obedience to God, is of God and from God.
Differ.


The Will and Commandment of God is both his ground, and rule of obedience. He
does it because God will have it done, and as God will have it done. This
notably differenceth a good action* not only from the crimes of the wicked, but
from the errors of the faithful. Levi, in a private rage, and for revenge,
joined with Simeon to slay the Shechemites, and was cursed by his father for it
Genesis 49.7
. His posterity, by Gods appointment, afterward slew their own brethren, and
were blessed by Moses for it Deuteronomy. 33.9
. David numbered the people without Commission from God, and was punished 2 Samuel
24.13
: Moses, and Joshua did the same thing well, because they had Gods warrant Number.
1.1, 2 Josh. 8.10
. The Christian will look to his warrant, as well as to the work he does. One
and the same thing may else be ill done, that otherwise might be well done.

The same man before his Conversion, went to Church for company; here was a
good act, but an ill ground: after his Conversion, he goes out of conscience.
Here both act and ground are warrantable, and so the action is good. He is
careful to know the Will of God, not of himself, or of humane directors, but of
God himself. It is true that God teaches by man, but then man teaches from
God. And so God shows and he learneth what is good, and what the Lord
requires of him Mic. 6.8
. Say not to him, what think ye in your self? Is it ill to wish well to your
dead friends, and to pray for them? for, his answer is ready, Religious duties
are not taught by the Law of nature, but must be warranted from above by the
Lawgiver, or be let alone. God will be Judge of what is well or ill done.

Thus, this hypocrite obeys God, as the Clock strikes, when forced by the
poise or weight from without; the true Christian obeys, as the pulse of the
body beats, because of the vital spirits in the artery within: The one
receives direction from men, and so marreth a good action, for want of
Commission; the other does all by order from God, and so cannot miscarry in the
work.

This hypocrites obedience is partial.

He that is but in part for God, must needs be but in part for obedience. If he
perform one part of obedience, he thinks that may suffice, and therefore makes
no conscience of the rest. If he call on the Name of the Lord, he departs not
from iniquity 2 Timothy 2.19
. If he have some show of godliness, it is without justice and honesty Mat.
23.23
, he has no care of his word, his promise, his debt. If he have honesty, it is
without godliness. He makes no conscience of the Sabbath Amos 8.5
. He can dispense with prayer, though it be a week together, yea, a month, a
year perhaps Job 27.10
.

If he have a good purpose, it is without effect: whence that speech, there are
more good purposes in hell than in heaven. Not as framed there, but carried
thither for want of putting them into act on earth. And as men in dreaming of
some good thing, or of hell, are much affected for the time; but waking, they
may happily tell their dreams, but live not after them: so this hypocrite may
sometimes have a fearful dream of hell, as Felix Acts 24.25
; sometimes a pleasant dream of heaven, as Balaam Number. 23.10
, but when he awaketh he is where he was, and as he was Isa. 29.8
.

If he have the action, it is without purpose of heart. The will is sometimes
accepted for the deed, where power is wanting; but the deed is never accepted
for the will, if the will to obey be wanting. If the deed be without a will to
obey, the action without affection, the work is lost. Sacrifice he offers,
but without repentance, which is the sacrificed heart, that only is accepted
Psalm. 51.17 Austin.
. In superficie bonus, in alto malus. He is superficially good, but really evil
Abel and Cain both sacrificed, and both to the same God: the Publican and the
Pharisee prayed, the same action, in the Temple, the same place, to God, the
same Lord, yet was Cain rejected, and the Pharisee not justified, because they
performed the act, but not with the same heart, the same will. All are not
Saints that offer sacrifice, but only they that with their whole hearts make a
Covenant with God by sacrifice Psalm. 50.5
.

If he have words, it is enough for him. There is much of this verbal obedience
in the world. Many will give God good words, who yet do but verba dare Jer.
3.4, 5
. One while he says, I will Sir: at another time, I will no more transgress
Jer. 2.20
. And so his promise not performed adds contempt unto injustice, and, a lie
unto the injury, and this usually ends in impudence, to outface the servant of
the Lord reproving him from it, as Saul did the Prophet: I have performed the
Commandment of the Lord 1 Samuel 15.13
. And again, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord. If he do any thing, it
is in his account sufficient. And so, when he does most, it is but a part; and
such a part too, as he pleases. He will not do all he should, nor shall any
other allot him what that part shall be, but he will do only that which is good
in his own eyes, without being set his task by another.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christians obedience is universal.

It has the perfection of parts, though not of degrees, yet even in degrees he
imeth at perfection, as at the white or mark which he strives to hit; or, at
least to come as near it as possibly he can. And herein his obedience is not
only universal, but uniform. He not only does all, but labors to do all alike
carefully and sincerely. It is true, that just men completely in all respects
perfected, are in heaven, yet is he taught, while he is on earth, to propound
their examples, yea, the Lord Jesus Christ for a pattern unto himself, and to
do his utmost in aspiring to the pattern of that heavenly obedience, and to do
the Will of God on earth as it is done in heaven. But as for the perfection of
parts, he does, and must attain to it here in this life: He has respect unto
all Gods Commandments Psalm. 119.6
. This testimony God gives him, I have found David a man after mine own heart,
which shall fulfill all my Will Acts 19.22
.

He departs from iniquity, as well as calls on the Name of the Lord: he
escheweth evil, when he sets himself to do good. He joyneth godliness with
honesty; righteousness and sobriety, with godliness; when he comes unto God,
he endeavors always to have a conscience void of offense both toward God
and men Acts 24.16
. He purposes, and performs; yea, rather swears Psalm. 15.5
, than not perform Psalm. 119.106
, whether he gain or lose. He not only sacrifices, but makes a Covenant with
God by his sacrifice; yea, he offers himself as a living sacrifice, holy, and
acceptable to God Romans 12.1
. When he comes to God in prayer, he brings words not only of supplication
for pardon and mercy, but of protestation and vows against former evils; of
which he desires to be pardoned Hos. 14.2, 3
: not words, without deeds, but deeds as well as words: Suscipit, and solvit
vota. He voweth, and pays Ps. 116.13, 14
. His word binds him to the deed, and his deed discharges him of his word,
and proves him a just man of his word: and so he is obedient both by word and
deed Romans 15.18
. Yea, what was vowed in his name by others, in his baptism, he makes
conscience to answer in person 1 Pet. 3.21
.

Thus, this hypocrite will be the carver of his own obedience, what he
pleases, and how much he pleases; the true Christian sets no bounds to
obedience, but extends it as far as God requires. The one is, in greatest
part, for himself in all he does, and so he obeys no further than may stand
with his own interest. The other is wholly for God with denial of himself, and
therefore refuses nothing commanded of God, because his interest is only to
please God: The one, in baptism receives nothing but signs, and so returns
nothing but words; the other, the seeds of grace, which growing up in due time,
bring forth the fruit of real and universal obedience.

This hypocrites obedience lies most in opinion.

When God has given him any work to do, and he thereupon thinks he has done
it, because he has perhaps done somewhat in his own way (which he thinks to be
better than Gods way) this is enough for him. If Saul do but handle the
Amalekites as himself thinks best, this, in his opinion, is an obeying of the
voice of the Lord; and it will not be easy for Samuel himself to persuade him
otherwise 1 Samuel 15.20
. If he be superstitiously given, when he has worshipped God in away of his
own, he thinks, that, not all the world, no, nor God himself, can show him a
better. If he be a proud Justitiary, he believes his halfing with God to be as
much as God requires, and is ready to do more. He can keep all the
Commandments, and ask for more work, What lack I yet Mat. 19.20
?

Had Bellarmine been at his elbow, he would have told him he had done enough
already for attaining eternal life; if he aspired to some higher place than
ordinary in heaven there was more to be done. The keeping of the Commandments
would give him a room in heaven; but if he meant to sit above others there, he
must then take Christ's counsel, (which, says he, was no Precept) and sell all
that he had, and give to the poor De Monach. l. 2. c. 9. sect;. quintum.
. And verily this hypocrite is fully of his opinion. He thinks, if he
prays, fasteth, etc. and God hears not, answers not his expectation, that
he does him wrong: for, in his conceit, he has done as much as God requires;
when God, on the other side, more truly says, he has done nothing of all that
I have commanded. For so in effect, he speaks, when he says, Is this the fast
that I have chosen Is^. 58.5
?

But, as Bellarmine and Christ were not both of one mind touching that young
man, the one being for his entering into heaven, upon his conceit that he had
kept all the commandments, from his youth Mat. 19.20
; the other, against it, if he would do no more than yet he had indeed done
Ver. 23.24
: so Christ and this hypocrite will differ about his admission into heaven, not
every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven, but he that does the Will of my Father which is in Heaven Mat. 7 21
. This hypocrite is like Naaman, who despised the easy and familiar Prescript
of Elisha for his cure, and went away in a rage 2 King. 5.12
: he scorneth to confine his obedience within the Commandments of God, as too
easy and too little for him. He must have Counsels, and courses of an higher
nature, that he may do more than is commanded, and verily thinks he does it
too, coming little short of Seneca's blasphemy, who would have his soul to be
Aemulator Dei, an Emulator of God himself, as not coming behind him. Might he
but know what God would further require, or but advise, he would not tarry for
a Commandment, but anticipate it, that he might rather offer a free will
offering beyond all that is commanded, than perform an obedience after it be
enjoined.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian, that goes much further in obedience, can never
satisfy himself.

He does what he is able, and keeps as close to the rule as he can; yet being
conscious, how far short both for matter and manner, he comes of that exact and
perfect obedience which God may justly expect from him, even under the Gospel,
in a Gospel-way, he is ever jealous of his best performance, and flies to God
for pardon of his best services. Well he may give content to men that are apt
to judge charitably, and surfeit those that are profane, who are ill pleased
(because themselves are shamed) by his doing so much: yet, having his eye fixed
on God whom he serves, and considering how short he comes of what God
requires, he fears he shall be found tardy in duty, how far soever he has
gone beyond others; being taught to acknowledge that when he has done all that
is commanded him, he is an unprofitable servant Luke 17.10
.

When he has done all he can, he still falls short of his desire and aim;
because when he would do good, evil is present with him Rom 7.18
; not wholly to keep him back, but to hinder, blemish and fully the good he
does. This troubles him, and makes him to cry out, O wretched man that I am
Ver. 24
. He reaches after perfection with all his might; but, withal confesses, not
to have already attained; as if he were already perfect Phil 3.12
. He does all that he does faithfully, and so has hope both of acceptance and
reward, not as deserving it as a faultlesse servant, but as serving a good God,
a kind Master, that does for him exceeding abundantly above all that he is
able to ask or think, proceeding in a way of grace, and doing it for his own
sake Ezekiel. 26.22
, when his servant has too much cause to be ashamed and confounded, and to
loath himself in his own sight, for his iniquities Ver. 32
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Laodicea, in her own opinion, rich, and increased
in goods, and had need of nothing; not knowing her self to be wretched, and
miserable, poor, blind, and naked Rev. 3.17
; the true Christian is so meanly conceited of his best performances, as
Nehemiah, that after all the good he had done, and praying God to remember him
for it (because done in sincerity) he adds, and spare me according to the
greatness of thy mercy Neh 13.22
. The one, by an over-weaning conceit of what is not, deludeth himself; the
other, by the humble opinion he has of his own obedience, is accepted of God,
even when himself is not satisfied with what really it is.

This hypocrites obedience is unwitting, and at unaware.

He may happily do the Will of God ere he be aware, as Ashur did, when he meant
not so, nor so much as in his heart thought so s^a. 10.7
. It may fall out that the most wicked man may do a great service for God, when
his aim is only to do his own work, and God is not in all his thoughts.
Joseph's brethren little thought of preserving themselves, their father, and
much people alive, when they sold Joseph into Egypt. They sold him, but God
(unwitting to them) sent him before them, to preserve them a posterity on the
earth, and to save their lives by a great deliverance Genesis 45.7
. So the hypocrite, when he but hypocritically does Gods work, he thereby
oft-times does more good than he intends, and may say to God as that servant
to his Master, Equidem plus hodie boni feci imprudens, quam sciens ante hunc
diem unquam Ter. in Hecyra. Act. 5. sect;. 4
. Verily, I have done more good to day unawares, than ever I did before this
day wittingly.

The hypocrite in doing of good, is not guided by God, nor does he aim at God
in it, but at himself, as those hypocritical fasters and mourners, in the time
of the Babylonish captivity. They did not fast unto God; did ye at all fast
unto me, even unto me? says the Lord Zech. 7.5
. In giving an alms, he may bring some glory to God: but all that he intends
is his own glory, he does it that he may have glory of men Mat. 6.2
: yet it may be, that by accident, or rather special providence, the bowels of
some true Saints may be refreshed thereby, and provoke others to return many
thanksgivings unto God 2 Cor. 9.12
. He may preach a good Sermon, if a Minister, (as no doubt Judas did many)
which he may do out of envy, strife, and desire to magnify his own good
parts, and not of good will: yet this may be a means of converting others,
which he never aimed at; therefore, says Paul, therein I do rejoice, and will
rejoice Phil. 1.18
, although this hypocrite after he has preached to others, become himself a
castaway 1 Cor. 9.27
.

Contrariwise, the true Christian obeys wittingly and knowingly. Defin.


He not only knows what is obedience, but he knowingly and intentionally sets
upon the work, as minding of, and aiming at God in what he does. He knows
whom he is to serve, he sets upon the service as intending obedience to God in
it, and to promote Gods service and interest, not his own. He goes about
obedience, as Paul went to Jerusalem, knowing beforehand upon what errand,
and what he must suffer for his service there, in the general at least,
although not the particular persecutions Act. 20.22, 23
, that should befall him there, or elsewhere.

In every act of obedience, he looks to his warrant, and to his rule. He will
first understand what the Will of the Lord is Ephesians. 5.17
. He will not go about it like an unwise man that considers not what he does.
He will not offer the sacrifice of fools that considers not that they do evil
Eccl. 5.1
. If he come to the house of God, he will not do as the hypocrite, that little
considers beforehand what he goes for, and cares as little when he is
there, how he behaves himself: but he will look to his foot, and be more ready
to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools. He values the unwitting doing
of good, at as low a rate, as the omitting of it. He knows that neither man
nor God will reward that service that was intended to another end, and not to
serve him. Therefore, as he knows whom he believes, so when he goes about
the service of God, he will know whom he serves, and what he goes about, and
to what end.

Thus, this hypocrite obeys God, as that man who drew a bow at a venture,
and smote Ahab between the joints of his harness, did therein what was
commanded by Benhadad, his Lord, in fighting neither with small nor great, save
only with the King of Israel 1 King. 22.31 34
. The true Christian is as Ezra, who had prepared his heart to seek (or know)
the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach it in Israel (u): The one is as
a blind man, that may by accident do that which he never dreamed of, Ezr. 7.10
nor any man expected; the other is as the wise man that has his eyes in his
head, while the fool walks in darkness Eccl. 2.14
.

This hypocrite obeys unwillingly.

His obedience is like his patience, both, perforce. His obedience is but
forged, and therefore must needs be forced, like the submission of David's
enemies. They obeyed him Psalm. 18.44
; but, by a strained and counterfeit subjection, as willing obedience. He
parts with sin as the devil at the command of Christ, came out of the man,
whom he had possessed, but not till he had torn the poor man, and cried with a
loud voice Man 1.27
, as omitting to leave his possession. Yea, let God charge him again and again
to forsake sin, he is as backward at last, as at first to obey; as the same
devil was, to come out of another body, whom he had made both deaf and dumb;
and at parting, left him for dead Mar 9.26
.

If God call him to do him service which he has no mind to, he does it with
snuffing, as being a great weariness to him Mal. 1.13
. He is the sluggard intended by Solomon, that is never ready to rise. Call him
at what time ye will, reprove him for his sloth as sharply as you please; say
to him, How long will thou sleep, O sluggard? when will thou arise out of thy
sleep? His answer is still the same, yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a
little folding of the hands to sleep Prove. 6.9 10
. And when he does arise and set about his service, he thinks it too long, and
says, When will the new Moon be gone? when will the Sabbath end Amos 8.5
? He is far better pleased with the end than the beginning. And no marvel. He
that loves sin must needs be loath to part with it, and hate the Commandment
that forbids it: and he that hates duty, cannot willingly be brought on unto
it, but abhor the Commandment that does require it.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian obeys with the heart.

He is one of those soldiers of Christ, that let Christ give the word of
Command when he pleases, will be willing in the day of his strength Psalm. 110.3
, to engage in his service and cause. He serves, in what place soever Christ
set him, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready
mind 1 Pet. 5.2
. He freely gives himself first to the Lord 2 Cor. 8.5
, and after, to those to whom God would have him to be subject, God no sooner
gives him a Call, but (so soon as he discerns it) he says, Speak Lord for
thy servant hears 1 Samuel 3.10
. He gives his members, as weapons of righteousness unto God. He offers
unto God a reasonable service, wherein he employeth both his reason to know,
and his heart to choose, resolve upon, and delight in the Will of God Romans 6.13
.

If natural actions that are of necessity have a pleasure in them, as eating
and such like, much more unto a Christian partaker of the godly nature, it is a
pleasant thing to obey God in spiritual service: being in his proportion made
like unto Christ, who made it his meat and drink to do the Will of him that
sent him, and to finish his work John 4.34
. Love, to a Christian, is both the sum and end of the Commandment, the
fulfilling of the Law Romans 13.10
. It is impossible that any commandment should be grievous to him that loves
him who gave it 1 John 5 3
. Love makes all things pleasant, and the very commandment sweet, and to
rejoice at the Word, as one that finds great spoil Ps. 119.161
.

Thus, this hypocrite makes a virtue of necessity; the Christian makes a
necessity of virtue. The one will obey when forced by God, the other holds
himself bound by necessity to serve him willingly, when furthest off from
force. And so, the one, by his unwillingnesse, loses his work; the other, by
his readiness, gets the reward.

This hypocrites obedience is perfunctory.

If he must needs do somewhat, he will do it for once. And, so it be done, it is
no matter, how. Opus operatum is a full work, and a full discharge too, for
him, how slightly soever done: He makes an idol of God; and any thing will
serve an idol. He can hardly pray, but he does it so yawningly, as if he were
telling a tale, or answering a question between sleeping and waking, late at
night; himself scarce takes notice of what he asks, or whether he pray or
not. Something must be done, to perform a task, and for this he has a form at
his fingers end, as an old Popish Idiot has his Pater noster and Ave Maria,
upon his Beads. Nor is there any difference, save only the one is in Latin,
the other in English; the one understands not, the other ca^eth not, what he
says. If he have the words by rote, that is enough, although the matter was
never in his heart. He performs his devotions by tale, as the Papist does,
rather than by weight, as the Christian does.

If he preach, it is so coldly, dully, carelessly, that whatever the matter be,
he marres it in the careless managing of it. He whiffs it out as if he were
taking tobaccho, rather than speaks as the Oracles of God 1 Pet. 4.11
. And so far is the Word from being in his heart as a burning fire, shut up
in his bones Jer. 20.9
, that it seems to be frozen in him, and has need of a fire to thaw it. Or if
he show any fire, it is strange fire, not that of the Sanctuary. He is better
at sowing pillowes under all elbowes Ezekiel. 13.18
, than at crying aloud, to show the people their sins Isa. 58.1
.

Yea, if the work be not none at all, an excuse will serve his turn as well;
and indeed there is little odds between them, save only that the excuse may
perhaps put him to more pains, than ever he meant to have taken in doing of
the work. So Saul being convinced that he had not done the Commandment of the
Lord in destroying Amalek, put it off to the people: if any thing were omitted,
it was their fault, not his. What was done, he assumes to himself, I have
performed the Commandment of the Lord 1 Samuel 15.12
. But when he perceived Samuel to find fault with the bleating of sheep, and
lowing of oxen, that were not utterly destroyed, he has his excuse ready: They
have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the
sheep, and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the Lord thy God, and the rest we have
utterly destroyed Ver. 15.
. There is a devil that is never off the hypocrites elbow, to help him with an
excuse of what he cannot deny to be done. What is good he will own, although he
has least hand in it. What is evil, he throws off wholly upon others, although
himself were chief actor in it.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian performs his obedience with all possible care and
diligence.

To do the work commanded, is his full resolution: this he will do, whatever it
cost him. He will rather lose his life than omit it. But, remembering that Word
of the Lord, Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord deceitfully, or
negligently Jer 48.10
; He is more careful of the manner, than of the work it self. He does not only
work out his salvation Phil. 2.12
, but gives diligence to make his calling and election sure 2 Pet. 1.10
. He does not only please God, but he does (...), ambitiously strive to
outstrip others, as men that are ambitious of honor, to be accepted of God 2
Cor. 5.9
. He does not only run, but labor to outrun, not only others, but himself. He
is not contented to make one, but strives to be the foremost, and to labor
more abundantly than they all 1 Cor. 15.10
.

He would not come behind in any, but go before in every duty. And yet when he
has gone furthest, and given God the honor of his grace; Not I, but the grace
of God which was with me, he plainly professes he has not done all that he
desires; not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect, but I
follow after Phil. 3.12
, (...), I pursue it, as an hound, eager of his game, pursues the chase with
all his might as well as skill. Therefore he adds, this one thing I do,
forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things
that are before. All things that he has done is nothing, so long as any thing
more is to be done. Therefore he presses on still further and further, with
more and more strength, skill, and industry, toward the mark, for the price of
the high calling of God in Christ, Jesus Ver. 13, 14
. If any can go beyond him, it shall be against his will, although he say
nothing of it. And, if John outrun Peter in going to the Sepulcher, Peter will
make an hard shift but he will first get into the Sepulcher John 20.4, 6
. He corrects his defects by more industry, as Zaccheus helped his lowness
of stature by climbing Luke 19.4
.

Thus, this hypocrite labors to know the least measure of obedience, that he
may do the less; the true Christian endeavors to see the utmost limits,
that he may stir up himself to do more: the one acts slightly, because not
sincerely; the other uses all diligence, because he acts faithfully.

This hypocrite obeys by stealth.

He that loves not God, but man rather than God, is afraid of his service:
this makes him not openly to profess serving of him in any strict, and due
manner, lest it prejudice his esteem and interest with man. Therefore what he
must do, he will do by stealth, for fear of the people; or at least of those
that have power to advance or crush him. He is afraid, or ashamed of
well-doing, if it be out of fashion. He is like those Rulers, that being
convinced that Jesus was the Christ, yet durst not confess him, for fear of
excommunication. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God
John 12.43, 44
.

If forwardness in Religion be in disgrace, he will not resort to Gods people
and converse with them as heretofore, but (as Zedekiah Jer. 38.16
, with the Prophet Jeremiah) underhand, and by stealth, with great caution,
lest he be accounted precise, and all should be marred.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian is not ashamed or afraid of obeying God in the
open light.

He may possibly at first enquiry after Christ, before he be fully set into
him, act Nicodemus, and come to him by night John 3 2
But when once he is satisfied touching Christ, and truly ingraffed into him,
he who was afraid to own him living, will boldly do service to his dead Lord
John 19.39
. He is not ashamed of his Lords badge, but wears it before all the world Romans
1.8
. If through infirmity of the flesh, he should by surprise of a sudden
tentation, with Peter, deny him; he will yet swim to him again through a flood
of tears, and be content to die for him, even the same death, which Christ
suffered for him.

He is better instructed, than so to mistake that of the Apostle, Have thou
faith? have it to thy self before God Romans 12.22
, than to hold himself exempted from a free, open, and bold confession of
Christ, his truth and cause; He knows that passage to be meant of doubtful
disputations about meats and days; and touching Christian liberty in
indifferent things, wherein no man, how strongly soever persuaded of the
lawfulness of what others scrupled; may use his liberty to the scandal of
others. But, as for professing and witnessing his faith in the Lord Jesus; he
well remembers who has said, Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my Word, of
him shall the Son of man be ashamed Luke 9.26
. And, whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my
Father which is in heaven Mat. 10.33
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like Nicodemus, before Conversion, coming to Christ by
night; the true Christian is like the same man converted, owning a dead Christ
in the open d^y; the one is afraid to confess him, the other fears more not
to obey him. The one will serve Christ, so no body know it: the other will
serve him, whoever takes notice of it.

This hypocrite obeys in doing right, but it is for spite.

If he have power in his hand, he will pretend justice, and favor a good cause
of the oppressed* by way of revenge of his own enemy, and under color of
justice, as Sime^^ and Levi did sharp execution upon Shechem that ravished
their Sister; pleading this for so doing Should he deal with our sister as with
an harlot Genesis 34 31
? If he hear any evil of others, he is zealous to bring them to justice, not as
grieved at the offense, but as angry at the man, whom he now brings forth, to
bring that upon him in a way of justice, which with his own hand alone he dares
not, or cannot inflict; as D^eg the Edomite, served Ahimelech, and the rest of
the Priests 1 Samuel 22 9 etc.
. The hypocrite is a very busy informer, pretending great love to justice, but
it is only revenge that makes him so efficious. Malice will put on any vizard
so it may attain its end in wreaking it self upon ^im it hates, as we see in
Saul destroying the Gibeonites, in his pretended zeal to the children of Israel
and Judah 2 Samuel 21.2
.

If Abner be rebuked by Ishbosheth for abusing Rizpah, Saul's Concubine, Abner
will now do a piece of justice upon Ishbosheth, whom Abner himself had unduly
made King but a little before. And now he sends to David, saying, Whose is the
land 2 Samuel 3.12
? All knew it to be David's right, so did Abner too, when he set up Ishbosheth,
but now, that he is angry with him, he will do David justice, by bringing about
all Israel to him. Now he can rem mber what God had sworn to David l b. Ver. 9
, and what God had spoken of David, saying, by the hand of my servant David I
will save my people Israel, etc Ver. 18
. Thus, he that out of emulation of Joab, would first set up a King against
David, now will do David right, not out of love to justice, but hatred of
Ishbosheth.

On the contrary, the true Christian obeys Gods command in doing right,
Differ.
out of love to justice, and with love to the man to whom he does it.

Whether he reward, or punish, he looks at God that requires it, and at man
that is to be the subject of it. Whom God will have to be rewarded, he
distributeth it to him without regret. And when he inflicteth punishment, it is
without respect of persons, not to revenge himself, but to bring the offender
to repentance, and to make others to beware. His love to God, and to justice,
keeps his heart from all thoughts of withholding good from him to whom it is
due, when it is in the power of his hand to do it? as also from saying, on the
other side, Prove. 3.27
I will do to him as he has done to me. I will render to the man according to
his work Prove. 24.29
; meaning against him, not against God or others.

He obeys God in his love to man; for, he that is bound to love his neighbor
as himself, is then most of all bound unto it, when he is enforced to execute
sharpest justice upon him; that since he must drink a bitter potion, it may
prove medicinal to his soul at least; that he may humbly submit (as the
converted thief upon the Cross) to the course of justice, acknowledge his
offenses, and justify the proceedings of God and man against him, as Joshuah
dealt with Achan, My son, I pray thee give glory to the Lord God of Israel,
and make confession unto him, and tell me now, what thou have done, hide it not
from me Josh. 7.19
. He labors to draw him to repentance toward God, before he doom him to
death, that so his soul might be saved, although his body was lost.

Thus, this hypocrite obeys malice, rather than God, in distributing justice,
as the Elders of Israel did, Jezabel, in stoning of Naboth 1 King. 21 12, 13
: the true Christian in doing justice, does it in obedience to God, and love to
man, as Paul directed the Corinthians, to deliver the incestuous person unto
Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord Jesus 1 Cor. 5.5
: The one covers hatred with deceit Prove. 26.26
, making justice the executioner of his malice; the other covers a multitude
of sins Jam. 5 20
, by drawing him to repentance, whom he is to punish for sin.

This hypocrite will obey in some things, but it is for commendation.

He is his own end, and therefore must advance that, although God go by the
loss. He is not so careful that the thing be done, as that he may have the
honor of doing of it. If God will have justice done upon Ahab and his house,
and set Jehu upon the work, he will do it; but so, that he will have the honor
of it himself. Behold, I conspired against my Master, and slew him 2 Kings 10.9
. He had as live it were undone, if it had not been his own doing; Come, see my
zeal for the Lord Ver. 16
. If others will not give him the praise of it, he will praise himself. Thus a
great part of this hypocrites Piety vanishes into pride and vainglory.

Alexander was angry at the multitude of his fathers victories, when himself
was yet but a youth, lest no work should be left for him to raise his name
above his fathers; so, this hypocrite is offended with his neighbors virtues,
that may threaten an eclipse to him. He differs not from those Heathens, who
followed virtue merely for advantage, and admiration; and, who if they wanted a
Trumpet fit to sound forth their praises, they accounted themselves but ill
rewarded; being ready to say with Alexander (than whom never any lift up his
head more loftily upon the Theater of honor) Quid narras, nisi Homerum
revixisse? He cared for no man's discourse of his actions, unless he could
bring him news of Homers being alive again, to set them out. This hypocrite
does all to be seen of men Mat. 6.2, 5, 16
: and if they see not, he thinks his labor lost.

If he have parts beyond others, or but thinks he has, no mean, or obscure
place will hold him. He needs not others to prompt or advise him, to depart
thence to some other place, where his abilities may be more noted, and better
rewarded. And therefore he likes well that counsel (although carnal) given by
Christ's brethren to him; Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples
also may see the works that thou do. For there is no man that does any thing
in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If thou do these things,
show thy self to the world John 7.3, 4
? They thought, as this hypocrite also does, that he ill consulteth his own
interest and glory, who being a man of great abilities, does nor blaze them
where they be most seen and admired.

But when he comes to the height of pride, when his obedience or works have
raised in him an opinion of merit: for now he presumes himself able to pay the
Lord for what he takes, and to satisfy for any thing wherein he has
offended, and to do, not only all that is required of God, that he may not
stand in need of his mercy; but, to do more than is commanded, that he may
purchase mercy for others also. And to say truth, there is scarce an hypocrite
in the world, but is, in this point, a Papist, in heart. For this is an
opinion, wherein all hypocrites unanimously agree. The more is this proud sin
to be abhorred. And, whosoever (Papist, or not) seeks his own glory is a
Competitor, yea, a Rival with God: nor is the difference much, whether he extol
merit, ability, or grace it self, for commendation of himself or others,
rather than for the glory of the Author.

Differ.
Contrarily, the Christian obeys, to set up God, not himself.

He is as much afraid of seeking himself, as the hypocrite is ambitious of it.
He will do as much work as he can; but, as he works not for him^^lf but for
God; so God shall have all the honor, as the sole end of his working. He is as
much afraid of vainglory, as of robbing of God. He will sooner deny the work
that he does, than assume, or suffer, the glory of it. He did it for God, and
none but God shall wear the honor. He knows that all other ingredients
cannot make a good work, where this is wanting; without this, he that is most
fruitful in works, (which men may call good) is unto God a barren tree. The
trees of righteousness, which are of the Lords planting yield no fruit, but
that wherein he may be glorified Isa. 61.3
.

The end gives form unto moral actions, whereby they are accepted, or
rejected. Therefore, his light shall so shine, that even they who see his good
works, shall glorify his Father which is in Heaven Mat. 5.16
, not him. This is his end in believing, praying, doing, suffering, all things;
and held out so clearly to all, that none can easily (unless wilfully) mistake
him. To this, all other ends, (as the benefit of his brethren, yea, the sealing
of his own salvation, and adorning of the Gospel) are subservient, and do
homage. He not only does the things commanded, but when he has done all, he
openly confesses, he is an unprofitable servant Psalm. 115.1
, to whom no thanks is or can be due for any thing that he does. If any man
will be so foolish as to strive to make him vain, by tickling his ear with
vain praises, he looks upon them not only as flatteries, but sacrilege; and
cries out, not unto us, not unto us Psalm. 115.1
; and, God be merciful unto me a sinner, even when perhaps he has as
strenuously labored in Gods work, as ever Nehemiah did Neh. 19.22
. He is as much afraid of such praises, as an honest man is of receiving
stollen-goods.

He does not shun, but pursue things that are of good report Phil. 4.8
; not to have it reported that he does them, but, for his honor, by whose
strength he performs them Vee. 13
. He will do good works that may be seen, for example, and for Gods honor; not
that he may be seen, and praised for them. He cares not how much himself lies
hid, so the work it self may appear to Gods glory. The conscience of his duty
is enough to him. He is for the work, not for the proclaiming of it. If the
work appear, he will take care, not to share in the glory. He will raise as
much glory to God as he can by doing good. His hand shall be in the work, but
none of the honor shall stick to his fingers.

If any praise be forced upon him, he may, and will thereby take encouragement
to deserve more, but not be lifted up, nor take any thing of Gods due, whoever
shall tempt him to it. He seeks not praise, but rather shuns it; and, the more
he shuns it, the more sedulously he pursues whatever is praiseworthy. He
admits not all the commendations that some men would heap upon him, nor will
he wholly reject some acknowledgements, so far as it may stand with their good,
that commend him; because men will be the sooner drawn to imitate such a
pattern as themselves account so worthy of praise.

He is not so ambitious as to engrosse all good works into his own hand, but
rather is willing others should work the work of the Lord as well as he 1 Cor.
16.10
. Therefore what he does openly, is as much for their incitement to go and do
likewise Luke 10 37
, as for discharge of his own duty. If God deny him opportunity to do some good
work which he has in his eye, and desire, he had much rather others should do
it, than it should not be done. If God think not fit to let Moses have the
honor of leading Israel into Canaan, Moses is well content that Joshuah do it.
If God declare that David shall not build him an House, he is so far from
envying Solomon whom God chose to do it, that he who could not have the honor
to do it himself, did gladly provide all the materials he could toward the
doing of it. So far will the Christian be from hindering another, that he does
all he can to further him.

As for the point of merit, he abhors the very thought of earning, or being
aforehand with God. For well he knows who has taught him in sincerity to
acknowledge, that, when he has done all those things which are commanded him,
I am an unprofitable servant, I have done that which was my duty to do Luke
17.10
. He is not ignorant, that no man keeps his wife more charily, than God his
honor, and that he will not part with the least part thereof to any creature
upon any terms. Therefore the Christian will not be his Rival in this which is
so precious to him. He will be very wary not to make him jealous in the least
of his going about to share with him in that which would make his jealousy
burn unto the lowest hell.

Thus, this hypocrite in all the good he does, or pretends to do, is like
Israel, an empty Vine, that brings forth fruit unto himself: according to the
multitude of his fruit, he increases the Altars Hos. 10.1
, not to sacrifice to God, but to himself: the true Christian, when he has
done a good work, says unto God, as sometimes Joab to David, touching the
taking of Rabbah, do thou take the City, lest I take it, and it be called after
my name 1 Samuel 12.28
. He will not take from God the glory of any work, that, at Gods own command,
he performs: the one is like the Pharisees, that, when a good work is done by
any other whom they love not, they zealously cry out, Give glory to God, we
know that this man is a sinner John 9.24
. But when they do any thing themselves, they call for the trumpet Mat. 6.2
. They will have the glory, or not do the work: the other in doing of good,
will be sure so to do it, that if men seek to set the Garland upon his head, he
will do as Saul, when he was to be made King, hiding himself among the stuff 2 Samuel 10.22
; He will be as nothing, that God may be all in all.

This hypocrites obedience is mercenary.

He is a Switzer, a soldier of fortune. He will fight for none, without his
Gold, or pay: pay him well, and he shall fight under any man's colors. He will
serve God for some present pay in worldly things: if this be denied him, he
sticks not to say, It is in vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we
have kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of
hosts Mal. 3.14
? Gratis poenitet esse probum. It repents him that ever he was good, or did
good, and got nothing by it. Nor does he account any thing a reward, but what
his own carnal heart is set upon. He must have the good things of the earth, or
serve God who will. For his part, he will rather serve the devil for present
pay, than serve God upon trust, to be paid here after.

This is a thing so well known to Satan, the father of this and all other
hypocrites, that he would feign have fastened this upon Job also; Does Job
fear God for naught? it was for the hedge God had made about him, his house
and all that he had; and for blessing the work of his hands, and increasing his
substance Job 1.10
. But however the devil knew that herein he belied Job, as if he had been but
an hypocrite: yet he, by this, makes it manifest that this is too true of all
hypocrites. They will be none of Gods servants to do any thing for him, unless
he pay them well. He is (in the hypocrites opinion) an hard Master Mat 25.24
, and his work is hard M^l. 1.13
, therefore he will not undertake it without great wages Ver. 10
. His sons, daughters, garners, sheep, oxen Psalm. 144.12 13, 14
, all must thrive, and be happy, or he is not contented; but maunders, and
murmures at his penny, if others get as much or more for less work Mar. 20.11,
12
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian will work in Gods Vineyard, without indenting.

He will work for God, although God should give him nothing for his labor:
because he works upon the ground of duty, and when he has done, confesses
he has done but his duty Luke 17.10
. Obedience, in him, proceeds from a nature and seed of goodness, which
makes him look only to his work, leaving it to God to allow him what he
pleases. He complains not of his hard wages, or hard work, but rather
bemoaneth himself that he was hired no sooner Mat. 20 7
. It is his grief that no man has hired him, rather than that he has too
little for his work. And so far is he from complaining of the smalnesse of his
wages, that he ingenuously confesses he has more than he deserves, even when
he receives least. I am not worthy (says he unto God) of the least of all the
mercies, and of all the truth which thou have showed unto thy servant Genesis 32.10
. Therefore, although he knows that God will not let any man serve him for
naught, yet he can trust God upon his word for more work than he is able to do.

And although it happen to him in Gods service, as to Jacob in the service of
Laban, that in the day, the drought consumes him; and, in the night, the frost
Genesis 31.40
; yet is not discouraged, nor gives over. He is as one stored with natural
heat, that is hot in the midst of the sharpest Winter; by his inward principle
of grace, he grows more bold and fervent in the midst of greatest
discouragements; such cold nipping frosts, by an antiperistasis, increasing his
heat, as it did in Joshua and Caleb, when all the Congregation bade, stone them
with stones Number. 14.10
.

He knows that he cannot serve God without reward, and that God will not be
beholding to the most wicked on earth whom he employeth, to make them work
without wages. Not a Jehu, not a Nebuchadnezzar, that does God any service
(although they never intended therein to serve him) but he shall receive from
God more than his work is worth 2 King. 10.30 Ezekiel. 29 18, 19
. God will not then let his own work without pay. Therefore, if God give him
his penny, he thankfully receives it; and when God promises it, he accounts
it no mercinarinesse to have some respect, as Moses had, to the recompense of
reward Heb. 11.26
. He is encouraged by hope of reward, yet works principally upon the ground
of duty. He knows God cannot be loved, without reward; yet, he makes not the
reward the ground of his love; for God is to be chiefly loved for himself,
without any eye to the reward, which when the Christian glanceth his eye upon,
he loves God more and better, whom he loves best for himself.

Thus, this hypocrite when God calls him to any work, says in his heart unto
God, as Judas to the Priests, What will ye give me Mat. 26.15
? or as the covetous Massemongers, who will rather let a soul lie in
purgatory, (as they pretend he does) many years, without bestowing one Mass
or prayer to deliver him thence, until they be sure of good pay for their
pains, and then instead of helping the soul out of purgatory, they help his
friends into hell. The true Christian, is as Abraham's servant, going to seek a
wife for Isaac, who would not so much as eat, until he had told his errand Genesis
24.33
, and done his work Ver. 54
, the one, although he be by his own telling, a great servant to God, yet will
do no more for him without first Indenting for wages, then they who are openly
wicked, that will not so much as make a prayer, till this question be answered,
What profit shall we have if we pray unto him Job 21.15
? the other, is as Peter, and his fellows, that first forsake all for Christ
to follow him, before they so much as once ask him, Master, What shall we have
therefore Mat. 19.27
? the one works for money, for which he indenteth; the other, for glory in
heaven, without making of bargain.

CHAP. XXXI. The Talking Hypocrite, or the Hypocrite of Tongue, Is he whose
Religion lies only in his tongue: he says, but does not. Defin.

AN evil Speaker is called A man of tongue Psalm. 140.11 (...)
, because his tongue is that with which he sins. In like manner may this
hypocrite be termed an hypocrite of tongue, because although he be not always
an evil speaker, yet is his tongue that wherewith he deceives, and then
deceives most, when he speaks best: and so is most evil, when he seems
most good. Words are the shadows of deeds, but his are words without deeds,
shadows without a substance, which is ever prodigious: for every shadow that is
natural, is the attendant, or issue of some substance. But here is no substance
at all, but a mere painted shadow that serves only to set off a substance, as
the hypocrite, that is but a foil, or show, sets off a true Christian.

He speaks well, and does ill, and therefore also is an evil speaker, because
his tongue belieth his heart. He says, what he means not, and does not what
he says; and therefore he says and does not, because he means not as he
says. All hypocrisy is principally in the heart, for which, hypocrites are
called, Hypocrites in heart, that heap up wrath Job 36.13
; they pull down wrath, not by small parcels, but by heaps.

But this man is a double hypocrite: an hypocrite in tongue, and an hypocrite
in heart. For his tongue belieth his heart, and his heart, his tongue,
suffering his life to confute his tongue; and, so deceives others by his
tongue; and himself by his heart. He makes his tongue a fair sign to an
empty shop, or as an Ivy Bush to bad wines, to delude the buyer.

He is Psittacus, a mere Parret in religion, that is still prattling by rote the
words of a Christian, but not as a Christian: a mere Jewes-trump, or a thing to
make a noise with, on purpose to beguile. As those Orators, whose chiefest
perfection lies in Pronunciation, are more beholding to their lips, than to
their brains; so is this hypocrite more beholding to his tongue than to his
heart. He is only a Speech-Maker, which when he has said, he has done. He can
speak well Deuteronomy. 5.28
, but without an heart to do. Sometimes his tongue runs beyond his wit; but,
always beyond his heart. Sometimes he is for verbosity, as they that affect
the French volubility; sometimes, for taciturnity, as they who like better the
Spanish gravity. He always deceives, for he never speaks as he means, nor
means what he speaks.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christians tongue is the true Interpreter of his heart.

He can speak nothing but what his heart dictateth. His heart first enditeth,
and then his tongue is the pen of a ready Writer Psalm. 45.1
. As he that is a professed wicked man, by his tongue proclaims what is in his
heart; (for, out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks Mat. 12.34
); so a true Christian, has grace in his lips, as the true witness of his
love to pureness of heart Prove. 22.1
.

The tongue is the helm, or rudder of the whole man Jam. 3.3, 4
, at this helm the careful Christian always sits, that he may bridle the
whole body Ver. 2
, as knowing that, (however some say, words are but wind) by his words he
shall be justified, or condemned Mat. 12.37
.

To offend sometimes in tongue, is an infirmity incident to the best, because
the tongue is an unruly evil, that no man can thoroughly tame Jam. 3.8
, so that there is no man but offends in word and tongue. But the Christian
is not impotently given up to the licentiousness of the tongue, for, he is
purposed that his mouth shall not transgress Psalm. 17.3
. He takes heed to his ways that he sin not with his tongue, and keeps his
mouth with a bridle Psalm. 39.1
. And because, that only is well kept, which God keeps, to his own industry,
adds prayer, Set a watch (O Lord) before my mouth; Keep the door of my lips
Psalm. 141.3
. But all this he does to prevent the evil of the tongue, incident to such as
are openly wicked. He is careful also of those evils that the hypocrite in
heart venteth with his tongue, which is the present business.

He is as much afraid of speaking good words in hypocrisy, as of speaking lies
in hypocrisy 1 Timothy 4.2
. He takes care that his words be such as they ought; and that they prove not
wind; but, be seconded by action. As his speech is always with grace,
seasoned with salt Col. 4.6
, so his actions are gracious, because the salt which seasoned his speech, has
not lost its savor. That Law of God which is in his heart, makes him not to
refrain his lips; and, when the word is once gone out of his mouth, it will not
be long ere the word be turned into works. Grace in his heart is a law to his
lips, and his lips are an obligation upon his hands, whereupon ensues
obedience both in word and deed. That grace which first seasoneth his heart,
then opens his mouth, and after both, sets the whole man to work the work
of God.

Thus, this hypocrite aspiring to speak with the tongues of men and Angels, is
yet for want of works of love answerable to his words, but as sounding brass,
or a tinkling cymbal 1 Cor. 13.1
. The true Christians words, joining works unto them, are pleasant words, in
the account of God Prove. 15.26
; and to the godly, they are as an honey-combe, sweet to the soul, and health
to the bones Prove. 16.24
: the one has the voice of Jacob, and the hands of Esau; the words of the
other are like the prayer of David, that goes not out of feigned lips Psalm.
17.1
.

This hypocrite is full of words.

This, by the wise man, is made the character of a fool Eccl. 10.^4
: and, no fool to the hypocrite, who takes himself to be wise, because cunning
to deceive. What he wants in works, he thinks to make out with words, but a
fools voice is known by the multitude of words Eccl. 5.3
. When he is set upon this loquacity, he is as incontinent of his tongue, as an
unclean person, of his body. He no sooner begins to take up the name of a
Professor, but he pours out all (and more than all) his mind, whereas a wise
man keeps it in till afterward Prove. 29.11
.

If he pray, he thinks the longer he prays (although he repeat over and over
the same things again, not out of affection, but affectation) the better, and
that he shall be heard for his much speaking Mat. 6.7
. Not that it is unlawful, upon extraordinary occasions, Luke 21.37
to lengthen, yea, to double and treble the same suits; as Christ, who spent
whole nights in prayer; and, said over and over the same words Mat. 26.44
. Repetitions may be used, but vain repetitions must be avoided. This hypocrite
seems very zealous in prayer, but it is in widows houses, which he intends to
devour, under great shows of devotion; and, for a pretense makes long prayers
Mat. 23.14
. When he is in his closet, fewer words will serve his turn; shorter prayers
seem long enough.

If he preach, it is out of envy and strife, not of good will; to vent
perverse things, to draw away disciples after him: or, by good words, and fair
speeches, deceive the hearts of the simple. And, through covetousness, with
feigned words, to make merchandise of the souls of men.

In his discourses of Religion, he is commonly very talkative, not out of the
abundance of his heart, to edify others, for his heart is empty, and little
worth Prove. 10.20
, but out of ambition to hear himself talk, and to be admired of others. He
talks much of Precepts, which he obeys not; of promises, which he believes
not, and of threatenings, which he fears not. He takes up the words of
Scripture, as a fencer, to play at foiles, not as a soldier takes up the sword
to fight in earnest. He is so full of talk, that he wearieth all, edifieth
none. He has need enough of counsel, but has no leisure to receive it, being
all tongue, and no ear; a sickness like the plague that banisheth the
Physician. He would fain be heeded, but is not so much as heard, when there is
no end of his babbling.

This is so far from being an honor to him, that it is looked upon by wise men
to be a womanish impotencie, not so much of nature, as of sin. It is a
symptom, and as it were a fit of drunkenness; he seems always drunk to
others, though wise in his own eyes. It is as the biting of a serpent which
cannot be charmed, and gives a wise man no rest. Surely the serpent will bite,
without enchantment; and, a babbler is no better Eccl. 10.11
. A babbler hurts his friend, aides his enemy, and undoeth himself. As members
that are diseased, continually draw humors to them; so the tongue of a babbler,
being never without an inflammation, draws poison to it self by continual
babbling, till as a fool, he fall, by his prating Prove. 10.8, 10
.

Contrarily, the Christian is swift to hear, and slow to speak Jam. 1.19
. Differ.


He has learned so much from reason, (although he never were Pythagoras his
scholar) as to be an hearer, until he be fully instructed what to speak, and
how to speak. He first boweth his ear, and hears the words of the wise, and
applies his heart unto the knowledge of God: for, he finds it a pleasant
thing to keep them with them, until they be fitted for his lips Prove. 22.17 18
. He knows that in the multitude of words there wants not sin, but he
that refraineth his lips is wise Prove. 10.19
.

When he is to come before God, he dares not to be rash with his mouth, nor to
let his heart it self to be hasty to utter any thing before God. He remembers
that God is in the Heavens, and he upon earth; therefore his words shall be few
Eccl. 5.2
. If he pray he will not let a word drop from his lips that he fetched not from
the bottom of his heart. He will pray with the Spirit, and with the
understanding also 1 Cor. 14.15
; not only as understanding the language, but minding the matter. He will not
use vain repetitions; yet, when he sees cause, and his heart is in a praying
frame, he will not be afraid, nor ashamed to use the same words Mat. 26.44
.

If he be put in trust with the Gospel, although he hold it his duty to preach
the Word, and to be instant in season, and out of season, and to spend and be
spent, as knowing there is a necessity laid upon him, and woe unto him if he
preach not the Gospel 1 Cor. 9.16
; yet he knows withal, that a Preacher must be wise, if he will teach the
people knowledge, therefore he gives good heed, and seeks out, and sets
in order many Proverbs, and seeks to find out words of pleasure (...)
, or, acceptable words, not to gratify men's lusts or curiosity, but to win
upon their affections; for that which he speaks is upright, even words of truth
Eccl. 12.9.10, 11
; which are as goads, and nails fastened by the Masters of Assemblies, which
are given from one shepherd, even the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Shepherd of
the sheep Heb. 13 20
. His speech, and preaching is not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
demonstration of the Spirit, and of power 1 Cor. 2.4
. His exhortation is not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile; but as
he is allowed of God to be put in trust with the Gospel, even so he speaks,
not as pleasing men, but God, which tries the heart, not at any time using
flattering words, nor a cloak of covetousness, nor of men does he seek glory 1
These. 2.3, 4, 5
. If he speak, he speaks as the Oracles of God, and when he ministers, he
does it as of the ability which God gives, that God in all things may be
glorified through Jesus Christ 1 Pet. 4.11
.

In his discourse with men, if it be of Religion. He is not so forward to
speak, as to wait for the words of others that are his Ancients. He first
says, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom Job 32 7
: But, if he find that they understand not, he then modestly and soberly
speaks what may be good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to
the hearers Ephesians 4.^9
; unless he perceive himself to be among swine, to whom pearls are not to be
cast Mat. 7 6
. And as for ordinary discourse, he ever judges, that the less he speaks, the
better; and he finds by experience that to be a truth, He that can rule his
tongue shall live without strife, and he that hates babbling, shall have less
evil Ecclus. 19 6
, whereas the prating fool shall fall Prove. 10.8
. Therefore he endeavors that his words may be gracious, and to that end
suppresseth them, till he have dipped them in understanding. He uses the bridle,
not the spur, to that unruly horse, the tongue. And that speech which he does
use, is pure, plain, clear, and manifest; full of gravity and weight, not with
affected elegance, yet not without gracefulness in the delivery Ambr. Offic.
l. 1 c. 22.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is in truth what the Epicureans, and Stoic Philosophers
of Athens, falsely called St. Paul Acts 17.18 (...) dicitur (...), qui libens
verba funditat, blattero* loquerius, seu loquax homo, verbosus nugator. H.
Steph. in SPEIPO.
, (...), a babbler, or waster of words, to no purpose, without end or measure;
like him that throws away good seed wastefully, and glories in it: the true
Christian uses only the tongue of the just, which is as choice silver, whereby
his lips feed many Prove. 10, 21, 22
, being like to the virtuous woman, who opens her mouth with wisdom, and in
her tongue is the Law of kindness Prove. 31.26
. The one, in babbling, has his heart in his mouth; although in speaking of
religion or religious things, his tongue and his heart are far asunder: the
other has his tongue in his heart, to consider what is profitable, and fi^,
before he utter it; and, to speak from the heart, what he utters with the
tongue.

This h^pocrite is loud and clamorous.

He that speaks much uses not to speak softly, in a whispering tone. Loudness
is his best zeal, and clamor his chief rhetoric, and strongest reason. He
thinks to carry the matter by noise, as the Cimbrians in their fight with
Marius; and Stentor (whose voice (says Homer) equalled the voices of fifty men
Homer. ^l 5
) at the siege of Troy. He argues as if Guns were disputing with Bells, which
should give the louder sound. He speaks as if he were in a tempest at sea, or
in a mill: or, as if he meant to out-blow the wind, or supply the defect of
reason with abundance of breath. He is like the loud-crying woman, fitter to
scare away enemies Ecclus. 26.27
, than to prevail with reasonable friends. He makes his quiet neighbors
acquainted with the troubles of wars.

If he pray, he must be so loud, that he may be heard where he is not seen,
like Baals Prophets, that cried aloud, saying, O Baal hear us 1 King. 18.26
: not that it is unlawful sometimes to lift up the voice in prayer; but this is
the hypocrites property to make his voice his prayer, especially in his most
private and secret devotions; which is all one, in effect, with praying
standing in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the streets Mat. 6.5
. Or like those hypocrites of old, who howled upon their beds, yet cried not to
the Lord with their hearts H^s. 7.14
. They make as loud a noise as a dog when he howleth; and, to as little
purpose: for, though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice (says the Lord)
yet will I not hear them Ezekiel. 8.18
.

If he praise, or applaud his neighbor, he does it with a loud voice, rising
early in the morning Prove. 27.14
: not for any good to his neighbor, whom he flattereth; but, for ends of his
own, to be a gainer by him, if he love flattery. Therefore does he rise early,
for fear of losing his reward. He will be the first in praising and flattering,
where he hopes for a reward; but, will be the last, in praising others that
deserve better, where there is nothing to be gotten. Howbeit, if the parties
whom he praises, be eminent, and popular, so as it may be some commendation to
himself, to praise them, (because it may argue him to be in love with
goodness, for that he so much praises it in others) he may then highly
commend him whom no man cannot but praise: just as the Damosel, possessed with a
spirit of divination, which brought her Masters much gain by South-saying, went
out to meet Paul and Timothy, etc. and followed them with this loud
acclamation, These men are the servants of the most High God, which show unto
us the way of salvation Acts 16.16 17
. The devil himself becomes a Professor, in hope either to be the more gently
dealt with by those that had power to mar his market (as here it fell out
Ver. 18
) or, as secretly intending to disgrace those whom he commends, as that
Pythonesse did, supposing that wise men would not long value them or their
doctrine, that would be beholding to the devil for approbation.

Contrariwise, the true Christian does all with at little noise as he can.
Differ.


He is for wisdom, not folly; for sincerity, not popularity: therefore he does
all wisely, that is to say, quietly, and with least din or noise. He knows
that God himself affects not to be among thunders, and earthquakes (it is the
devils delight to mix himself with tempests Job 1.19
) but rather to be in a small still voice 1 King. 19 11, 12
: and that the words of wise men are heard in quiet, mere than the cry of him
that rules among fools Eccl. 9.17
. Loud clamours take up so much of the ear, that no room is left for reason to
judge of the matter. As a soft shower soaketh better into the ground than a
hard storm; the one opening and softening, the other beating and hardening it;
so his still voice, wherein wisdom droppeth as the dew, soaketh in, and
softeneth the hearts of his hearers, whereas violent speech, turns the heart
of the hearer against him that speaks.

If he be in any disputes, he brings soft words and hard arguments. He will
not strive, by loud and clamorous language, as seeking to prevail by violence,
or impudence, but, be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness
instructing those that oppose themselves 2 Timothy 2 24 25
. If he pray, especially in private, he is careful to let his heart cry louder
than his tongue, and his tongue to be tied to the rules of discretion and
comeliness. If he pray in company, he lifts up his voice, that it may reach
all that join with him in the duty; but, no father. If he pray in secret, he
takes order that none but his Father which sees, and hears in secret, may
take notice of his praying Mat. 6.6
. He prays, as Hannah, who spoke in her heart, only her lips moved, but her
voice was not heard 1 Samuel 1.13
.

If he praise any man, it is not with a loud voice, as a flatterer; for well he
knows, that a flatterer is but an over-officious servant that is a secret
thief; getting what he can for himself, and betraying the rest into the hands
of the devil, as Ahabs Prophets did him 1 King. 22.6 etc.
. Therefore his praise is to provoke others to the same practice of virtue,
which he praises: It is the good works done, not the workman, which he chiefly
commends; not to make him proud, but to encite and engage him to do more, and
better, and with some caution too (especially when he seems to foretell what
such an one will be, if he go on as he begins) as sometimes Scipio did, C.
Marius, Plut in Mario.
gently clapping him on the shoulders, and saying, Peradventure this shall be
He. By which he encouraged him to deserve, yet kept him from elation of mind,
by beginning his Prophecy with a Peradventure. He is as careful to keep down
pride, as to provoke to virtue; to quicken to diligence, as to encourage by
praise, and hope of reward.

Thus, this hypocrite has no other zeal, but loudness; nor reason, but
clamor, to bear down all reason, truth, and justice, like those malicious and
vociferous Priests, Rulers and people of the Jews, that when Pilate had again
and again pronounced Christ innocent, and the third time demanded a reason of
their eagerness to have him put to death, asking them, What evil has he done?
they, in stead of giving a satisfactory answer, were instant with loud voices,
requiring that he might be crucified; and by their voices prevailed Luke 23.23
. The true Christian, even when provoked to passion, is as Paul, (pleading
before Festus and Agrippa) when, charged by Festus that he was beside himself,
and that much learning had made him mad; he answered calmly, and gently, I am
not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness
Acts 26.24 25
: He acquitted himself of madness, as much by his sober speaking, as by the
truth which he spoke. The one, in speaking to God, is as loud as if he had to
do with an idol; the other, as having to do with him that knows the suit of
the heart, before it be uttered by the lips Isa 65.24
. The one is so loud in praising, that all find it to be but flattery; the
other, so cautious, and modest, that none can pronounce him a flatterer.

This hypocrites speech is with affectation.

He is for eloquence (an able Master of language) more than for truth: and
sometimes Laconical, or very short and curt in his expressions, like that of
the Lacedaemonians to Philip, who threatening that, if he entered their Confines,
he would utterly destroy them, they answered him in one word, (...), If. When
at another time, He sent to know whether they would receive him into their
City, they wrote him answer, in capital letters, only thus, OY, No. He will be
curt and quaint of speech, like those that affect a Poetical kind of wisdom,
and are indeed verbotenus sapientes, but only affected word-Masters, or
Word-wise, to be able to speak elegantly (as he thinks) rather than truly or
soundly (which he minds not;) to deliver Apothegmes, rather than plain
instructions; riddles, rather than plain speaking; to speak sententiously,
rather than sensibly out of the feeling of his own heart; oracles, or strong
lines, which are many times but nonsense wrapped up in a strange habit, and
being opened, prove but an Ape in a child's dress.

But, ill do such sayings become such speakers: for, either they understand
them not themselves, and then that of the wise man is well bestowed on him,
Excellency of speech becomes not a fool Prove. 17.7
; and, a parable in his mouth, is like a thorn going up into the hand of a
drunkard Prove. 26.9
, that makes use of he knows not what, that rather wounds than helps him: or,
it is not understood by others, and so is cast away with indignation and
contempt. His affected brevitie, breeds scorned obscurity.

Or, on the other hand, he is for a wise-drawn style; he must draw out every
sentence to such a length, as scarce any man's breath is able to carry him to
the period of it; or, his brains, to make sense of it. Or he is so frequent in
childish Paronamities, and affected cadences, as is able to set an edge the
teeth of any masculine Orator. Quaint phrases are his chiefest study, and a
picked sallet of words are the best dish that he has to set before you.
Enticing words of man's wisdom 1 Cor. 2.4
, are of him more set by, than the Oracles of God 1 Pet. 4.11
. Nothing but a golden Key will open his Cabinet, which, being opened, contains
nothing but a few brass rings, and Bristol-diamonds.

Yea sometimes, he shows as much affectation in his very pronouncing, as in
the words he pronounces. As some affect outlandish pronunciation of the
French, or Spaniard, or of the Dutch, or Italian, who to be admired of fools
at home, make themselves ridiculous to wise men abroad: so this hypocrite is
sometimes for a whining tone, sometimes for pronouncing through the nose.
Nothing pleases him better than the sound of his own fiddle, although never so
much out of tune. That, he thinks, must needs please others, that best pleases
him, even when he makes himself abhorred of God, and nauseous to men.

He may be called the whining, groaning, or drawling hypocrite. He speaks as
if he were no man of this world. He seems so far out of love and patience with
the corruptions of men and of the time, that you would think him a very Lot in
Sodom* whose righteous soul is daily vexed 2 Pet. 2.7
: whereas in truth all this ado proceeds either from feebleness of spirit,
unable to bear his own crosses and disappointments in those things for which he
turned hypocrite; as every weak thing is by nature apt to make moan; or, which
is worse, from a pretense of zeal, and a presumption of holiness, whereas none
makes less conscience of duty, none helps on, or adds more to the evil of
the world and of the times, than he: as. in covetousness, and cozenage,
(perhaps he will not swear) lying, and idleness; and even in this that he
says to others, (who pethaps may be better, cannot be worse than himself)
Stand by thy self, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou: whereas he
and such as be, are a smoke in my nose, (or wrath,) says the Lord, a fire that
burns all the day Isa. 65.5
. For, while he lamenteth other men's sins, he laugheth in secret at his own.
And, among the sins of other men, he is far more offended with those whereby
he is hindered, than with other sins, by which God is more dishonored; He is
angry at him that has deceived, or overreached him, that has oppressed, or
otherwise crossed him in his designs, but seldom lays to heart lying,
hypocrisy, pride, covetousness, secret uncleanness, idleness, etc. These,
or some of these unclean birds make their nests in his grove, and lodge in his
bosom, without noise, or notice.

Contrarily, the Christian truly uses his tongue as his glory. Differ.


It is that Organ by which his outward man differs most from beasts, because
he thereby pronounces articulate sounds, and expresses rational notions, as
understanding what he speaks. As therefore the Lord has honored him with
such a faculty, so he makes use of it to the honor of his Maker, and thereby
it becomes his own glory Psalm. 108.1
. Not that it is his glory to use it always, or as himself pleases, as they
do who say, our lips are our own Psalm. 12.4
; but, when he may use it to the glory of him that gave it.

He observes his time to keep silence, as well as to speak Eccl. 3.7
. Silence is sometimes a virtue, not that silence of the hypocrite, who is
sometimes silent out of sullenness; or, because by speaking he should bewray
his ignorance, (which he is loath to be known of, because he would be thought to
know every thing;) Wisdom is too high for such a fool, therefore he opens not
his mouth in the gate Prove. 24.7
. This is a silence of cunning, not virtue; his only virtue being to hold his
tongue, when he knows not what to speak. But the true Christian is silent,
when, being rich in the pearls of good doctrine, sound instruction, heavenly
counsel, he finds himself to be among dogs, or to have lighted into an herd
of swine: and then, he knows his rule, Give not that which is holy unto dogs,
neither cast ye pearls before swine Mat, 7.6
.

But, because God is more honored by the right use of the tongue, than by not
using it at all; and, that God has given wisdom (as he gives riches) not to
all alike, but, to some more plentifully for the supply of others, that there
may be a kind of hospitality expected from the mouth of the righteous, to feed
many Prove. 10.21
, by bringing forth wisdom Ver. 31
. He endeavors to keep as good an house as he can in this kind, or at
least, confer symbola, to make up a feast among himself and others that fear
God, by speaking often one to another Mal. 3.16
, in the behalf of God and his righteousness, and for the assisting and
encouraging of one another in the worst of times, in the way of righteousness.

Nor is he a man of words, that is, one that affects words for curiosity,
elegancie, or vainglory. He makes use of words as men do of a Card or
Campasse, to show himself and others the way of well-doing, that he may arrive
at the desired haven; or, as men do of keys, to unlock that which needs
opening. He esteems that to be the best eloquence in teaching, which most
usefully opens that which is locked up; and that to be the best wit, which so
uses words, as to make truth most conspicuous.

To what end is a golden Key, if it open not what we desire to see; and what
hurt, if the Key be of wood, so it do the deed, which the other cannot, (says
Saint Austin De Doct. Christ, l. 4. c. 11
,) seeing all we expect from a Key, is but to open what was before shut up? He
therefore shunneth all words, how gaudy and gorgeous soever, which edify not.
He gives leave to any to go before him in excellency of speech, so himself come
not behind in seriousness and weight of matter. He chooses rather to set
forth truth in a plain dress, than in the tire of an harlot, as knowing that
as levity in apparel argues too much lightness and vanity of mind, so too
much gaudinesse in expression, brings truth it self into suspicion.

The Apostles were enriched with the gift of Tongues, in the day of Pentecost,
not only for variety of Languages, but for elegancy of speech, by which they
were enabled to speak Apothegmes Acts 2.4 (...).
, which comprehend much in a little, they spoke as the Spirit gave them
utterance, yet did they not affect such kind of speaking, in their ordinary
preaching. Paul spoke wisdom among such as were perfect, yet not the wisdom of
this world, and it was the words of wisdom, not the wisdom of words 1 Cor. 2.7
. To be able to speak elegantly, is the gift of God; too much to affect such
speech, is an abuse of that gift. He accounts him the best Rhetorician, that so
speaks, as to teach, delight, and prevail. These three therefore the
Christian has in his eye; the first and last are his aim, the second he uses
so far as it may be an in let to the other two. He is no enemy to eloquence,
but to profuseness, which offends gravity, and is altogether unbecoming the
simplicity of the Gospel: for, it endeavors so to set out trivial and the
smallest matters spumeo verborum ambitu, quali nec magna atque stabilia
decenter, and graviter ornarentur, with such a frothy affectation of words, as
wherewith even the great and weightiest truths could not with comeliness and
gravity be attired Aug de Doct. Christ l. 4 cap.
.

And as for voice, and pronunciation, he keeps to that which nature, not
affected industry supplies him with. Here, he keeps close to that grave rule
of a great Master of imitable eloquence, and elocution, St. Ambrose De offic l.
1. c. 23
. Touching voice, says he, Sit sane distincta pronunciationis modo, and plena
succi virilis, ut agrestem ac subrusticum fugiat sonum, non ut rithmum affectet
scaenicum, sed mysticum server. Let the voice be distinct in the manner of
pronunciation, and full of manly vigor, that it may eschew rustical and
clownish tone; not affecting the riming tune of the stage, but keep to the
gravity of that sacred matter whereof he discourses. And if he speak in a
mourning tone, it is from the true sense of Gods dishonor, not out of design
to deceive.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Tertullus that took more care of his Oratory, than
of the matter he was to speak; and studied more the elegancie of his language,
than the truth of his charge (for, not so much as one witness was produced to
prove it: Acts 24.13
) the true Christian is as the Preacher, that, in seeking out acceptable words,
his main care was, that what was written (by him) might be upright, even words
of truth Eccl. 12.10
. The one darkeneth counsel by words, without knowledge Job 38.2
, making that more obscure which he undertook to explain; the other, by the
sweetness of his lips increases knowledge Prove. 16 21
, by clearing up that which before was obscure: the one, as Herod, by a fluent
tongue, seeks to raise glory to himself, which justly ends in his own confusion
Acts 12.21
: the other, as Paul, has the tongue of the wise, which uses knowledge aright
Prove. 15.2
, and so causes others to glorify God in him Gal. 1.24
.

This hypocrite talks of God and good things, without minding of either.

Ave Caesar, not knowing, nor thinking whom Caesar was; so this hypocrite has
often God in his mouth, when God is not in all his thoughts Psalm. 10.4
. He makes bold with his name, that never thinks of his nature; sometimes by
way of Interjection, O God! O Lord! O Christ! when any thing is done or spoken
that seems strange to him; sometimes, by way of insinuation to get something
from God, as Israel, which cried, My God we know thee Hos. 8.2
: but, never thought of him; for, even then Israel had cast off the thing that
is good Ver. 3
: he had cast off that God, whom he pretended to know, and made use of his
name, only for self-advantage.

Sometimes he does it, to persecute others, as those hypocrites of old, who
cast out their brethren, and for countenance of their persecution, call God
into the business, saying; Let the Lord be glorified Isa. 66.5
: as the bloody Bishops, in times of Popery passed sentence on the Martyrs,
beginning it with In nomine Domini. Whence it grew into a Proverb, In nomine
Domini incipit omne malum. In the Name of God, is the introduction to all
mischief; which makes the wickedness the greater, that calls in the great and
glorious God, to father the devils bastard begot on their wicked hearts.

He takes the Name of God in vain in his very prayers, sometimes ignorantly,
not so much as knowing when he names God, as ignorant people saying their
prayers in Latin which they understand not; sometimes customarily, saying over
that with his lips, which was never in his heart: drawing near with his mouth,
and honoring God with his lips, but have removed his heart far from him Isa.
29.15
. Making use of the Name of God and Christ, no otherwise than beggars, upon the
high way, or at our doors, who to move pity in others, have often in their
mouths the Name of the Lord, and Jesus Christ, whom they never think of, nor
care to know more than to use their names as a charm to get an alms. So that
this hypocrite makes prayers unto God, as that Atheist, under the name of
Pierce penny-lesse made his supplication to the devil.

And in the same manner he discourses (for his better grace) of the things of
God. If he talk of religion, it is with a profane spirit, that never thinks of
it, but to serve his turn for worldly advantages. His tongue runs a gallop,
when his head and his heart have not the least tincture of godliness appearing
in them. These things he speaks of, but does as evil things as he can. And when
he speaks of Scripture, it is no otherwise with him. Either he urges
Scripture to upbraid others, or to call them to that duty which he never
performs, or minds himself: or, it is to show how much he can remember,
what he can say out of Scripture, when he does it with no other spirit, than
some unhallowed ones have taken upon them to write of the tears of Christ,
that yet crucify him every day afresh, and bring him to open shame Heb. 6.6
; and so likewise of the tears of Peter and Mary Magdalene, that never once
thought of following them in their repentance.

Yea, some have been so bold as to translate the Book of Canticles, with a
filthy heart and style agreeable, making a carnal Epithalamium, or Bride-song,
of that heavenly Song of Songs; as Bonaventure that Popish Schoolman presumed
to translate a great part of David's Psalms into our Ladies Psalter Printed
with his works Tom. 6. at Mentz. An. 1609.
; and where he found the word Dominus, or Lord, he atheistically made it
Domina, or Lady, making all those prayers to her, which the Psalmist made unto
God; and what the one attributed to God, he blasphemously ascribes to the
Virgin.

Perhaps this hypocrite makes jests of, or in Scripture-phrases; or, on every
occasion, has some place of Scripture or other in his mouth, but without
grace, or reverence: it may be, to make it a charm for an Ague, or (as he
believes) to drive away the devil, who first taught him so to abuse Scripture.
It is true that Christ by Scripture vanquished, and chased away the devil, and
therein has taught us how to resist the devil, that he may flee from us Jam.
4.7
; the Word of God, being the sword of the Spirit Ephesians. 6.17
. But neither did Christ himself, much less can we, drive away the devil with
the bare pronouncing of the words of Scripture, unless by faith we so draw
weapons out of Gods Armourie the Scriptures, that the devil may be made to feel
the power of them, as well as hear the words: and therefore Peter herein
directs how to expel the devil with Gods weapons, by calling on all, to
resist him steadfastly in the faith 1 Pet. 5 9
. Making use of the grace of faith to be too strong for him by the Word of
faith. Faith is the maine shield wherewith we are enabled to quench all the
fiery darts of that wicked One Ephesians. 6.16
. And without this, he is no more afraid of Scripture-words, than of Popish
holy water.

On the contrary, the true Christian speakeeh of God, Differ.
and the things of God with holy fear and reverence.

He never thinks of God but with fear and reverence, even when he does not by
his tongue make mention of him. Sometimes his reverence is expressed by an
awful silence; the Christian being so taken, and as it were, swallowed up with
admiration and astonishment at God, his Word, Works, Justice; that he stands
mute before God, as not able to speak. He lays his hand upon his mouth Job
40.4
, and holds his peace Lev. 10.3
.

But, when he speaks of God, or to God. His mind, first, seriously and
reverently fixes his thoughts upon God, whereby he sets the Lord always
before him Psalm 16.8
, not only to trust in him, but to stand in awe of him, as considering what,
and what manner of God he is in himself, and works, whose glory covers the
Heavens, and the earth is full of his praise Hab. 3.3
: so that, when God ^^th in any extraordinary way by word, or work, manifest
himself, the Christian desires to be affected, as the Prophet was, When I
heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, rottenness entered
into my bones, and I trembled in my self Ver. 16
. He looks upon God, as greatly to be feared in the Assembly of the Saints, and
to be had in reverence of all them that are about him Psalm. 89.7
. Therefore he dares not take his name in vain; nor, without God, will he so
much as name him; By thee only, (says the Church) will we make mention of thy
Name Isa. 26.13
.

He mentions the Name of God in the fear of God, and in the strength of God:
and therefore says, I will go in the strength of the Lord God I will make
mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only Psalm. 71.16
. He is not as the hypocrite that makes mention of the God of Israel, but not
in truth, nor in righteousness Isa. 18 1
. For, his heart teaches his mouth, and adds learning to his lips P ov. 16.23
: and so his lips know what is acceptable Prove. 10.32
, and he is not rash with his mouth Eccl. 5.2
. He first makes his supplication to God before he presumes to talk of God,
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart, (for, in him, these
two go together) be acceptable in the sight, O Lord my strength, and my
Redeemer Psalm. 19.14
. If he have a purpose to praise God, he first goes to God to enable him to do
it, and to lend him his own Key to open his lips to so holy a purpose; O Lord,
open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise Psalm. 51.15
. He is ashamed to see what little reverence is performed by Chr^stians to the
Name of God, when he reads, or hears, that very Turks speak not of God
without falling flat down on their faces.

If he speaks of the Word of God, he finds it like fire in his bones Jer. 20.9
, causing his heart to burn within him 2 Cor. 2.17
, as being deeply affected with what he speaks. He speaks not of it,
lightly, vainly, carelessly, or as adulterating it, to look favorably upon
errors, and blasphemies; but, as of sincerity, and as of God, in the sight of
God, speaks he of the Word of God, in Christ, that so it may not only build
up himself in hi^ most holy faith Jude 20
, but be more effectual to the use of edifying of others, and minister the more
grace to the hearers Ephesians. 4 29
. He makes not sport with it, but trembles at it Isa. 66.2
: and is so far from making it a charm, that he makes use of it to charm
his heart against all superstition, and every false way, and to hate them that
regard such lying vanities.

If he enter discourse of the Works of God, he so speaks of them that he
gives to the Lord glory and strength, he gives unto the Lord the glory due
unto his Name Psalm 96.7, 8
. He takes pleasure in contemplating the Works of God, and therefore seeks
them out, meditates on them, and both finds and esteems them to be
honorable and glorious Psalm. 111.2, 3
: and then resolves, with David, to say unto God, I will speak of the glorious
honor of thy Majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And he speaks of them, so
that other men also shall speak of the might of Gods terrible acts, and
abundantly utter the memory of his great goodness, and sing of his
righteousness Ps. 145.5, 6, 7
. Yea, he so speaks of Gods judgments in the earth, that both himself and
the inhabitants of the world may learn righteousness Isa. 26.9
.

Thus, this hypocrite sometimes names God, and good things, as some use
customary compellations at every turn, thereby to adorn their speech; or, as
profane swearers, that often have God in their mouths, to his dishonor, and
their own confusion; the true Christian speaks of God, as fearing this
glorious and fearful Name, THE LORD HIS GOD Deuteronomy. 28.58
. And of the Word, not as of the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the Word
of God 1 These. 2.13
; and of his works as honorable and glorious, Psalm. 111.2
the one makes use of the Name of God and these things, as some do of money,
only to cast account, or to reckon their gain; the other uses them to better
purposes, as knowing the true worth and value of them.

This hypocrite speaks well of good things in others, but cares not to have
them in himself.

He gives virtue his good word, but not entertainment: he commends her (as
men, do boys that, for a spurt, work hard, without wages, to show what they
can do) and so lets her go. He knows it to be his interest to commend good
Ministers, good Christians, good Books, (because men usually take the height of
his goodness, by what he commends in others,) but follows them not. He
talks of the bow he never shot in, and applauds that excellency which he
means not to imitate. It Is Religion enough for him to commend some that have
it, or rather some that had it. For, as he says, virtutem incolumem odimus,
sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi. Virtue that is yet before us, we hate: but
that which is dead and gone, we seem emulous seekers of; not for the love of
virtue, but that he might be thought virtuous, without it.

He honors goodness in others, as the Scribes and Pharisees did the
holiness of those that had been long dead, but persecuting it in the living.
They built the Tombs of the Prophets, and garnisht the Sepulchers of the
righteous departed, and said, if we had been in the days of our fathers, we
would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets Mat.
23.19, 30.
, but killed and crucified those that were sent to themselves Ver. 34
. He praises his religious Parents and Ancestors, as the Jews did Abraham and
Moses, never caring for Abraham's faith, nor for Moses his fidelity: and, as
some amongst us, are ready to boast, my father had such good exercises in his
family, and did so and so, but never care to tread in his steps. And thus much
goodness the devil himself will allow this hypocrite to have, as knowing that
it is far more easy to deceive by commending goodness, than by declaiming
against it Austin. in Psalm 40
.

Contrarily, the true Christian is more careful to be good himself, than to
commend goodness in others. Differ.


He neglects not to give praise where it is due, as envying the goodness he
sees in others: but the sight of that, provokes him; and, his commending of
that, engages him to be more industrious to get more thereof into himself.
Commendation stirs up to imitation; and praise is a spur to things
praiseworthy. Therefore the Christian speaks of good things in others, that
he may stir up himself to goodness. In reading a good book, he labors to
be of the Authors mind, and to make use of his wisdom, and rules, by turning
reading into practice; words into action; he having no other end in reading the
works, or words of the wise.

He is first diligent to read and enquire after the wisdom, virtues and
actions of the best men, that have written the fairest Copies for others to
follow. To this end wise Authors have written books, as Xenophon wrote the
actions of Cyrus the greater, and entitled his book, (...). The Institutes of
Cyrus, not which he learned, but taught by his actions, as the Orator explains
it Lib. 2 de Orat.
, Non tam historicae serviens veritati, quam ut absolutum institueret ducem.
Not so much to give a true historical account, as to make a complete Commander
or General in war. And wise men read such books, as Alexander did Homer, not
so much for delight, as for profit, to extimulate noble minds to heroic
actions.

The Christian will not come behind, but outstrip heathens in this
commendable practice. He looks upon good examples, as drawing after them
Trophies of honor, not only in the account of good men, but in the sight of
God. By it, that is, by the heroic exercise of their faith, more than by
weapons of war, the Elders of old obtained a good report. It is an honor to
a believer to hear and read what honor believers that lived many Ages before
them have achieved. Nor does he rest upon Quae genus, and proavi, what his
Ancestors have done, but counts it a foul shame not to tread in their steps.
And, being compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses Heb. 12.1
, as are all the Saints and faithful of old that have before him, besides those
that live in the same Age with him, he will not be slothful, but a sedulous
follower of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promises Heb. 6.12
.

Thus, this hypocrite is willing enough by commending others, to put them upon
action, but sits still himself, as Abner and Joab, the two Generals of the
Armies of David and Ishbosheth, Let the young men arise and play before us 2 Samuel 2.14
, that they might be witnesses of their valor, but not Partners in the fight;
the true Christian, so looks upon those Worthies that have by their faith
acted for God, that he also runs with patience to the race that is set before
him Heb. 12.1
, and so runs, that he may obtain 1 Cor 9.24
: the one praises that in the dead, which he hates in the living, and so gets
no good by either; the other gives all others their due, and reapeth much
benefit to himself, by following the good examples of the godly living, as well
as of Saints departed.

This hypocrite is a great declaimer against vice, but without detestation of
it.

He loves vice well enough, and is loath to disparage it; but he must speak
against it, when he speaks of it; or he should too soon be discovered to love
it. He must speak against it to save his credit; but he speaks against it so,
as to save his vice too. What a man loves he is loath to discommend; and, if he
must discommend it, he will disparage it as little as he can. To speak of vice,
and not against it, is indeed to speak for it; to speak against it seemingly,
yet giving it all the allowances that wit can think of, is cunningly to commend
it. This hypocrite shall curse the deceiver, yet himself holds fast deceit
Jer. 8.5
. He will speak against covetousness, yet has an heart exercised with
covetous practices 2 Pet. 2.14
. He is a sharp censurer of uncleanness, yet himself has eyes (at least) full
of adultery Ib.
.

And when he has spoken all he can against his own sin, suppose it to be
pride, oppression, wantonness, usury, etc. before those, who know it not to be
his; yet when he comes among such as are not ignorant of it, but perhaps
sharers in it, then he extenuates it all he can, and deals with it as Players
do with vice in Interludes, trimming, and masking, (if not rather unmasking) it
so, as it gets more lovers thereby, than enemies: or, as lewd women when
they are arraigned for some foul offense, make themselves fine and amiable as
they can, to move pity in some, lust in others, and to blind the eyes of
justice, not unlike to Jezabel at the approach of Jehu, painting her face, and
tyring her head, and in that garb, looked out at a window, supposing that none
now would, or could, for pity, lay hold upon her 2 Kings 9.30
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian hates sin, and will be sure it shall get
nothing by his tongue.

He cannot speak against that sin, which he hates not with a perfect hatred:
Not because sin has shamed him, but because God has taught him better,
therefore he hates every false way Psalm. 119.128
. And his hatred will be sure not only to speak, but to do whatever may tend to
the ruin of what he hates. Either he will not at all make mention of the
evil, by way of discourse, because mention occasioneth notion, and notion (in
many) btings forth motion Romans 7.5
, wherefore if it be unknown, he is willing to devote it unto silence and
oblivion. There are some things, which must not only be not done, but not so
much as once named amongst Christians, as becomes Saints Ephesians. 5.3
. Not that he makes it unlawful to name the Word covetousness, but to lay open
all the secret and cunning practices which covetous wretches secretly make use
of, it being a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in
secret Ver. 12
, and a means rather to teach sin, than to reform it.

If he must necessarily name the wickedness (as sometimes to aggravate the
offense to draw the offender to deeper humiliation; or in evidence, before a
Judge,) he does it with all the detestation and disadvantage of the sin that
possibly he can. He chooses rather to imitate Solomon in speaking of the
odious sins of adultery and drunkenness; who, to the mentioning of the sins
themselves, usually adds the sad effects, dangerous inconveniences, and
dreadful ends thereof; than to imitate Ham, in telling of his fathers
nakedness to his two brethren without Genesis 9.22
. He will not adventure to tell a long tale, much less to act a Scene of
impure lust, with all entising circumstances, and then think to mend the matter
with a Tragical Conclusion of the acted offenders. Such an Antidote comes too
late, and is too weak, when the poison is already taken down, and begins to
work.

Thus, this hypocrite disgraceth sin in policy, as sometimes Abigail did her
husband Nabal, 1 Samuel 25.25
unto David, calling him a man of Belial, not with purpose to have him ruined,
but to assuage the fury of David against him; or he extenuateth his sin, in
hope thereby to preserve it, as Lot did Zoar, Is it not a little one? the true
Christian, is as Joab, not thinking it enough that his sin, as Absalom, be
hanged by the hair of the head, unless he strike it with dart after dart,
through the heart it self 2 Samuel 18.14
; the one painteth and pranketh his Jezabel, in hope to find favor; the
other, as the Eunuch, casts her down; and, at once, as Jehu, treads her
under foot, and makes dogs meat of her 2 Kings 9.33
.

This hypocrite speaks of the things of God, for controversy, not for
edifying.

If he be of a wrangling wit, he exercises himself more in difficulties and
subtilties, than in plain truths, because his Leviathan-wit thinks, it has not
sea-room enough in unquestionable truths. He cannot sit down and quietly
consent to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
doctrine which is according to godliness; but, he dotes about questions, and
strife of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth 1 Timothy
6.3, 4, 5
.

In stead of striving to be one of them that shall be saved, he, as a
questionist, or disputer, demands of Christ, Lord, are there few that shall be
saved Luke 13.23
? Not asking, to learn, but rather out of curiosity; or, with a spirit of
contradiction. And this humor possesses many, who, having more learning than
grace, sharpen their wits to baffle those who have more grace than learning,
and by grace do shame them and all their learning. Sometimes pride breeds an
itch in good parts, and, in men of great hopes, there is oft-times an humor of
opposition, which being nourished, breeds opinionativenesse, and
profaneness in the heart. The first mover about questions and strife of words
is pride, in the Apostles observation that was but now mentioned.

It is a true observation, nimium altercando veritas amittitur, by too much
wrangling truth is lost. And there is nothing more dangerous in scholars of
pregnant parts, and busy wits, than to vaunt of a polemical, or rather
parodoxical ability to defend any thing, though never so improbable; for hereby
they come at length to hold any thing, although never so false and damnable; or
to deny any thing, or to hold nothing, be it never so clear and demonstrable.
And so, as some by following the Fencing School, come at last to be Swaggerers;
so these, by the wit-fence of Sophistry, become desperate heretics, and bring
upon themselves swift destruction 2 Pet. 2.1
. Yet this hypocrite resolves to overcome in every conflict of disputation,
which many times proves no better than that between the two Thebane brethren, a
Cadmean victory.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian speaks of truth reverently and peaceably.

He that is for truth, and not for victory, is more willing to be overcome by
truth, than to conquer with error. Nor is he a loser by being worsted in
Argument, while truth prevails; but should suffer loss by gaining the day,
had he prevailed against truth. He therefore fears error, and gets more
ground of it by prayer, and peaceable managing of Arguments of truth against
it, than by hot and fierce disputes, wherein he finds that passion is as bad
in a disputation, as that dust, Plut. in Mario.
raised between the two Armies of Marius and the Cimbres, which dust was so
great, that when they thought to engage in battle, they lost all sight of one
another, whereby the glory of the victory fell to Catulus, Colleague to Marius.

Wherefore he flees wrangling contention, doing nothing in strife or
vainglory Phil. 2.3
, but armeth himself against it, with calmnesse of mind, in meekness
instructing those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them
repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth 1 Timothy 2.23
. He omitteth not the just and strenuous defense of the faith, when occasion is
offered, but contendeth earnestly for the faith which was once delivered unto
the Saints Jude 3.
. But it is by steely arguments of reason, not by by thunder claps of passion,
and so he proves himself the best Champion of truth.

Perhaps others can fence, but not fight better. The best fencers are not the
best soldiers. A true man backed with a good conscience and a good cause,
sometimes foiles a fencing thief; and a sincere Christian that loves the truth
and peace, will keep his ground better in the defense of truth, than he that
pretends to much more skill in disputation: and though he speak with less Art,
yet what he speaks is more to the purpose. And, if all things else fail, yet
his faith and courage fail not; so that when he can answer sophismes and
fallacies no longer, he boldly resolves, as he that was over-match't by Popish
Sophisters, when he cried out to the persecuting Bishop, My Lord, although I
cannot dispute for the truth, yet I can die for the truth.

Thus, this hypocrite makes use of Scripture, as some contentious spirits use
the Law of the land, for a waster or cudgel to break his neighbors head; the
true Christian sets it up as a Standard which he resolves to maintain with his
life: the one is a fencer, no soldier; a wrangler, no assertor of truth; the
other is a good soldier of Jesus Christ 2 Timothy 2.3
, that so manageth his spiritual Arms, as to defend and love the truth and
peace Zech. 8.16
.

This hypocrite makes no conscience of lying to his neighbor.

As his carriage in the matter of his talk is false toward God; so he is no
changeling, in speaking to his neighbor, wherein more pains than ordinary is
required to unmask him. For this, he may be called the lying hypocrite,
Signanter, as being a more eminent liar than any other. For he is a double
lier; a lier in all his carriage as he is an hypocrite; and more particularly a
lier of his tongue, in speaking that for truth, which he knows to be false,
with a purpose to deceive. Every lier is by his lie an hypocrite, (although he
be not such in other things, but an open wicked man) for every one that lies
would be thought to speak truth; so then, an hypocrite, and a liar, meeting in
one, make a double hypocrite, or, an hypocrite in grain; A lie, is the
hypocrisy of the tongue; as hypocrisy in behavior is the lie of the life. By
the one he speaks lies in hypocrisy ^ Tim. 4.2
, by the other he acts lies in all his conversation. He loves lying rather
than to speak righteousness Psalm. 52.3
, and is nothing but a lie in all his behavior both toward God and man.

The best man, that hates lying most, may be made a lie by others, that put
that trust and confidence in him which they ought to place only in God: so, men
of high degree are a lie, because, if laid in the balance with God, (for
wisdom, power, stability, fidelity,) they are altogether lighter than vanity
Psalm. 62 9
. But here is only a lie passive, which is his sin that makes him so; not his,
that is so made by others, unless he say (as the Bramble to the trees) come,
and put your trust in my shadow Judge. 9.15
: but this hypocrite is a lie active; for he not only abuses others, but
himself most of all, when he says to himself, Come and put thy trust in the
shadow of my hypocrisy: for he plays the hypocrite and the lier so long,
that he comes at length to believe his own lie, and to trust in it, as that by
which he hopes to delude God as well as man.

Yea, this hypocrite in speaking truth, lies, when he understands, or believes
that to be a lie, which he delivers for a truth. As when he talks much of the
judgment to come, of the torments of hell, and of the unavoidablenesse of them
without repentance, none of which he indeed believes to be true; yet,
delivering them as truths, and believing the contrary, he lies in speaking
truth. He that in speaking, goes against his mind, lies, whether he speak
truth or falsehood. And what is there which this hypocrite speaks, wherein he
does not so lie? If he say, there is a God, he speaks truth; yet lies* as to
his lying self, in so saying, because he believes not the truth which he
speaks, but looks upon it as a lie. For every hypocrite is a fool, and every
such fool is an Atheist, that says in his heart, there is no God Psalm. 14.1
. This is the language of his heart, as appears by the language of his life; he
being corrupt, and doing abominable works, as if there were no God: so that,
both his heart and life give his tongue the lie, even when he speaks truth:
and he is is proved a lier by two of his own witnesses.

But, his lying to his neighbor is not confined to his talk of God, and
heavenly things: he can hardly speak, but he lies, and loves to lie, to
whomsoever he speaks of other matters. He that lies in all his carriage,
will not make scruple to follow the same trade with his tongue. Reputation with
men, is his greatest ambition, therefore he must seem better than others, that
he may raise a name. But his carriage answers not his high-flowen profession;
he sometimes takes a cup too much, or is wanton, or uses some deceit in
commerce, or is strongly suspected of some other miscarriages, which not only
blemish his reputation, but endanger his person. Here, he is put to his shifts,
whereof the first is a lie. He out-faceth that with a lie, so long as he is
able, which he blushed not to do in hope of not being discovered. He thinks to
cover his fault by a lie, as Rachel did her fathers idols, by sitting upon them
Genesis 31.34
, and so by hiding it, doubles it. And indeed, lying is as common with him, as
swearing is with a debauched ruffian. He can as hardly speak without a lie, as
the other without an oath.

If he be ask't a question of his carriage, not becoming his Profession; or,
for which he is afraid he shall be blamed, or shamed: his answer is no other
than a lie. If he have been where he should not, and done what he ought not,
and after be asked, as Gebazi was, Whence come thou? or, where have thou
been? He has a lie ready, thy servant went no whither 2 King. 5.25
.

If he have a mind to draw another, who makes Profession of Religion as well
as he, (and perhaps, with more sincerity) into sin, and the other alleges any
Command of the Lord against it, he will be lie God, and Scripture, and all to
bring him to his lure, and make an hard shift to abuse the other with a
pretended warrant from God for so doing; as the old Prophet of Bethel, who
abused the man of God that had prophesied against Jeroboams Altar; by causing
him, contrary to the express Command of God, to return with him, and to eat
bread, upon pretense that he, being a Prophet as well as the other, had
received later order from God so to do; but he lied unto him 1 King. 13.18
.

If he would make a show of doing much more good than he performs, and give
out to the godly, as well as to others, that he has done so much good for this
or that person, or place, as indeed he has not; or, promises so much, and
performs but a part, yet makes the world believe he has done all; and if he be
charged with dissembling therein, he answers as Ananias and Saphyra, who would
needs sell all their land and possessions, and lay the price thereof down at the
Apostles feet, for supply of the Saints, but kept back a part of the price; and
being questioned for it, they thought to make it good by a lie, that they sold
it but for so much, and they had brought it all Acts 5.3. and 8.
. In a word, take an hypocrite without a lie in any discourse, and send him to
^he Pope to be canonized for a Saint.

If downright lying be too gross to serve his purpose, and to stand with his
profession or honor, the devil, his father, has found out a new Art of lying,
or rather, another sort of lying newly become an Art, to wit, the Jesuits
impe, and darling, Equivocation, which is a speech, that in some sense reserved
in the breast of the Speaker, may be true, but according to the plain sense of
the words, by which he seeks to shift and abuse the hearers, is a lie. If he be
asked, Are you a Priest? He answers, No: meaning, he is none of the Order of
Aaron, or Melchizedech. Demand of him, did you within such a time see such a
Priest, or Jesuit, that is sought for? He answers, No, I saw him not:
meaning, he saw him not upon the rop of Paul's. Interrogate him further, Have
not you said Mass of late in England? His answer is still the same, No;
meaning, he said it not in the English tongue, or in an open Church.

This he denies to be lying, and maintains to be lawful: and* so makes it a
worse kind of lie, than that which is on all hands yielded to be lying. For a
sin blended and defended as no sin, makes it a bed of snakes, or a complication
of sundry sins in one. He cannot deny, but what he speaks, is, in the hearers
understanding, a direct lie: for, he says, he saw not him whom he did see. He
did not that, which yet he knows was done by him. To think to salve all with
some mental res^rvation to himself, of which the hearer can take no notice,
cannot excuse from a lie, when the speech is between man and man, especially
between him and a Magistrate that has power to examine him. For he asks the
question, expects a positive answer to his question, according to the plain
construction and sense of the words, and meaning of the question; the other
therefore is bound, if he speak, to speak truth to his neighbor Zech. 8.16
; Not one thing with the lips, and reserving another sense in his heart*
contrary to the plain sense of the words he speaks with his mouth. This is to
speak with a double heart Psalm. 12.3
, which God abhors, however Jesuits use, and applaud it. The truth is to be
spoken in the heart, as well as with the tongue Psalm. 15.2
. He that speaks that with his tongue, which is contrary to what he means
in his mind and heart, is a lier to himself, because he knows his words to
be contrary to truth; and he is a lier to his neighbor, because he deceives
him by an untruth cunningly uttered; which cunning alters not the nature of the
sin, but aggravates it. The more cunning any man is in sinning, the more he
resembles the devil the father of sinners, but especially of liers John 8.44
.

And to say truth, the devil is sometimes more ingenuous than many of his
scholars; when he lies, he will confess it; they deny it, and maintain it to
be no lie. When the father of lies had taught Ahabs Prophets to prophecy a lie
unto him touching the success of his march to Ramoth-Gilead, they do not in
express terms tell him he should take it; but only thus, the Lord shall
deliver it into the hands of the King; speaking ambiguously, (as the devil
used, in delivering his Oracles,) that so, if the King of Syria carried it (as
he did) those prophets might evade a lie by saying we said indeed, God shall
deliver it into the hands of the King; but we did not tell him what King, nor
did he ever ask us. We meant in our minds, the Syrian King. Yet even the devil
himself that put that answer into their mouths, freely confessed the truth,
when he declared how and what he would do, to persuade Ahab to attempt that
war, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
Prophets 1 King. 22.22
. Here Is the lie confessed by the father of it; if his sons think otherwise of
it, we leave it to them to consute him.

But, perhaps he pleads, that they to whom he speaks, are of a false
religion, heretics, and so no members, no brethren; and, even their
Magistrates have no power to examine him, or to proceed against him, because
excommunicated; and all that is done against him, is, coram non judice, before
one who is indeed no Judge; and therefore he may make more bold to baffle him.
But this bold hypocrite considers not, (though he be a Jesuit) what Jesus
(whose name they abuse) did, before Caiaphas, and afterward before Pilate, no
disciples, no Catholics. Before Caiaphas, he first was silent Mat. 26.63
, to let that High Priest know how little power he had to examine and condemn
him, who was indeed the substance of that shadow, and that great High Priest,
that shortly was to pass, and accordingly did pass, into the Heavens Heb. 4.14
, for us, (where it is to be feared, the other never came, for himself:) But
considering withal, that to this end he was borne, and for this cause came he
into the world, that he should bear witness unto the truth John 18.37
. He both then, before Caiaphas, and after, before Pilate, (to whom first also
he refused to speak, to show Pilate that he could have no power at all against
him, except it were given him from above John 19.10 11.
witnessed a good confession 1 Timothy 6.13
, ingenuously acknowledging in such words and language as they might and did
plainly understand, who he was, without any Equivocation, or mental reservation
Mat. 26.64 John 18.37
, leaving us an example that we should follow his steps 1 Pet. 2.21
.

It may be, this hypocrite taken in a lie, will plead that he lies but in
jest, or for sport and merriment, to show his wit, not to deceive. But while he
shows his wit, he shows his wickedness. Every fool can lie, and make sport,
but not without some wickedness. And if sport may legitimate a lie, then the
madman who casts firebrarnds, arrows and death, and says, am not I in sport
Pro. 26.18, 19
? may have a license too. Wickedness committed in jest will be punished in
earnest: foolish talking and jesting which are not convenient, (and whoever
durst to maintain a lie to be convenient,) are not allowed to be so much as
named among Saints Ephesians. 5.3.4
. Therefore sporting lies are condemned by the light of nature in very
heathens. Solon Plut. in Solon.
that wise Lawgiver, and Governor, although in his latter time he took some
delight in mirth and merry Poemes, and came to hear Thespis acting some of his
verses upon the Stage, in which when he perceived some lies, after all was
ended, he called Thespis to him, and asked, If he were not ashamed to lie so
openly in the face of the world; and, being answered, that it was not material,
for that all was but in sport, Solon beating the ground with his staff,
through indignation, replied, if we once commend lying in sport, we shall find
it afterward in good earnest, in all our bargains and dealings.

If he be not so pleasant, as to use the jesting lie, but rather condemns it,
(not as hating the sin, but for lack of wit to make sport, or as taken up with
other wickedness, which is more sport to him Prove. 10.23
;) yet he hopes the officious lie may be borne without offense, which sometimes
may be for the good of many; it saved many Hebrew-children, (and, among the
rest Moses) that should have been destroyed Exodus 1.19
, it preserved the Spies, that otherwise could not have escaped Josh. 2.4, 5
. And hence some have imagined and defended, pious frauds; for doing of good,
to be lawful: and those not only Priscillian heretics, (who maintained lying
to be lawful, against whom St. Augustine chiefly bent his learned and solid
book, Tom. 4. See his Book De mendacio, and his other Book Contra mendacium.
both directed to Consentius.
) But great and learned men of great note in the Church, have spoken too
favorably of officious lying.

But the father last named has so soundly and nervously answered all Arguments
and Examples brought for it, and given so many strong reasons out of Scripture
against it, as it is almost impossible to add any thing material thereunto, or
to refute his book. Among other passages and instances, he answers those two of
the Midwives, and Rahab, whom God blessed for such their dealing, the one with
the children, the other with the Spies, thus; Non ideo factum est, quia
mentitae sunt, sed quia in homines Dei misericordes fuerunt. Non est itaque in
eis remunerata fallacia, sed benevolentia; benignitas mentis non iniquitas
mentientis Cap. 15. contr. mend.
. It was not so done to them, because they lied, but because they were merciful
to Gods people: not their deceit, but their benevolence; the benignity of the
mind, not the iniquity of the tongue in lying, was rewarded in them. And this
we know, that God likes no such Advocate as liers to plead his cause. Will ye,
says Job to his three friends, speak wickedly for God, and talk deceitfully
for him? Will ye make a lie for him, as one lies for a man Job 13.7. and ver.
4.
? This was his meaning, having immediately before charged them as forgers of
lies in this very cause. Put nothing to his word, says Ashur, lest he reprove
thee, and thou be found a lier Prove. 30 6
. This imputation of lying for God, to advance his truth, the Apostle rejects
with execration Romans 3.7, 8
.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the true Christian in all things speaks the truth from his heart.

He loves truth Zech. 8.19
, and hates lies Prove. 13.5
, therefore he first advises with his heart, before he utters any thing with
his mouth. His heart teaches his mouth, and adds learning unto his lips
Prove. 16.23
. His lips utter nothing, but what the heart first dictated, that so he may
make this sure, not to ly, in case he should tell an untruth, through
ignorance, or false information. Therefore he prays with Agur, Remove far
from me vanity and lies Prove. 30.8
. Yet, he is cautious, not to take those things for lies, which are not such.
There are in Scripture diverse things which the Proctors for lies, do urge as
lies, which are not so. Every lier seeks to conceal truth, yet every one that
concealeth truth is not a lier. Abraham concealed truth in not saying Sarah was
his wife: but did not lie in saying she was his sister, for she was his sister
by the fathers side Genesis 20.12
. A man may conceal truth; by silence, without a lie; for so did Abraham; he
did not deny her to be his wife: had he done so, that had been a lie. But he
only said, She is my sister, and so saved himself from lying.

Again, Tropes or Figures, as also Parables which are frequently used in
Scriptures, although not true in the very letter, are not lies, because never
intended to be spoken, but to signify somewhat else by an elegancie of speech,
not by a fallacy of words; and so they are to be understood, and accordingly
are interpreted by such as understand language: so as here is no deception in
the speaker, but a more lively and profitable instruction of the hearers.

When Christ is said to be a Rock a Lion, a Lamb, etc. and when the devil is
called also a Lion, a Wolf, a Dragon, Leviathan, etc. no man is so weak as to
take these speeches to be meant properly, but figuratively, by way of allusion
or comparison; to show the strength and virtues of the one, and wickedness of
the other so fully in few words, as could hardly in many other plain words be
so fully expressed. He therefore refuses not such expressions, but rather
studieth how to make out the elegancy of them, and how, aptly to imitate the
Holy Ghost in such figures and similitudes.

So for Parables, as that of Jotham, concerning the trees Psalm. 15.2
; and those many Parables of our Savior in the Evangelists, although the
things mentioned in them were never acted according to the letter, (which was
never intended by them,) yet something, like those very things were acted by
those very persons to whom those parables were spoken, which had it been spoken
in plain downright language, would not have instructed them half so well, or
so much. For those parables do hold forth them and their actions, in so clear
and lively a glass, as makes them to see themselves and their actions so
fully, as not to be able to evade the condemning of themselves by their own
judgment and conscience, which otherwise could never be so convincingly done.

Therefore he uses Parables also, (yet far from lying) when he is able so to
frame them, that the true scope may both appear, and teach; and the words be so
chosen and placed as an intelligent ear may discern them to be a Parable, not
a story: nec invidentur discentibus, quod his modis obscurantur, sed
commendantur magis; ut quasi substracta desiderentur ardentius, and inveniantur
desiderata jucundius Aug. contr. men. l. c. 10.
. Nor are things of this nature enviously found fault withal, but rather
commended by such as are put to the pains to pick out the true meaning of
them; when it appears, that therefore the things thereby intended, seem to be
laid under parabolical expressions, as it were out of sight, that they may be
sought out with more diligence, and found with more pleasure. And the scope,
being once found, it will then appear, that those parables contain not
falsehoods, but truths, because truths, not falsehoods were not only intended,
but signified by them; and so, they are not only warrantable, but commendable,
and very acceptable to an ingenuous hearer, or reader.

But as for lies he abhors them, seeing that he has put off the old man
with his deeds Col. 3.9
. He will not tell a lie for God himself, as knowing how hateful lying is unto
God Prove 6.16, 17
. He leaves equivocating lies, to those (...), those arch-liers, and patrons
of them, who all hold of that one grand lie, the Papacy, which by the Spirit
of truth is called (...), The lie, as comprehending in it all sorts of lies,
and the quintessence of them to deceive and destroy the souls of men 2 These.
2.11, 12
. Nor will he make himself or others merry with that which makes the Spirit of
God sorry Ephesians. 4.30.
, by a sporting lie: or, for any man's pleasure, take up an officious lie,
whatever good might redound to himself or others by it, as knowing it to be an
evil and hateful thing, to do evil that good may come thereof Romans 3.8
; and that there is no necessity laid upon any man by God, to lie, although for
saving his life; which must go, rather than be preserved by sin, which
ruineth life, and soul, and all, in the Conclusion.

He is sufficiently instructed, how hateful unto God, injurious to our
neighbor and fellow-member, lying is, as if the eye should tell a lie to the
foot, or the hand to the throat; and lastly, how unprofitable and pernicious to
the lier; for a lying tongue is but for a moment. This is madness indeed
(says Cyprian Ad Cornelium.
) not to know, nor consider that lies cannot long cozen him that at present may
be abused by them. A man may possibly get some present commodity by it, as
Gehazi did, but it leaves an everlasting plague of leprosy, I mean, a guilty
conscience behind it, which as a millstone about his neck, pulls him into the
sea of Gods wrath, and gives him his part in the lake which burns with fire
and brimstone; which is the second death Rev. 21.8
. No sin is branded with more disgrace, or more threatened with inevitable
destruction, which is extended, not only to all that make lies, but to all that
love them Rev. 22.15
. And let the liar bear what Arms he will, yet the true Christian by searching
his true Pedigree in the best Herauldry, the holy Scriptures, finds the devil
to be his true father Joh. 8.44
, and, that he is burnt in the tongue, or rather in his conscience, with an hot
iron 2 Timothy 4.2
, not only as a perpetual infamy, but as a certain forerunner of those
everlasting burnings which he must endure in hell for ever.

Possibly he may, by fear, or some other sudden surprise, fall into this sin,
ere he be aware, as Sarah did, I laughed not, for she was afraid Genesis 18.13
Mat. 26.70, etc
, and as Peter did, which cost him dear (s), (although few of Gods people ever
went so far) but he will bewail it with tears of blood, and pray earnestly,
Psalm. 119.29
Remove from me the way of lying; as hating, and abhorring it Ver. 163
. He is so far from practicing of lying upon that account that holy persons
have sometimes used it, that he looks not upon their falls, for imitation, but
upon their repentance, and their being received to mercy thereupon, as an
encouragement to repentance, not to lie. Nay rather, because he finds such
eminent Saints subject to so foul a vice, he abhorres it and fears it the
more in himself, and keeps a stronger watch upon his lips, that he may not so
foully offend with his tongue.

If any man propound to him the instance of Rahab, and ask what he would do, if
a godly man, persecuted and pursued to death, should seek shelter under his
roof, and his discovering of him would be present death to the persecuted man;
whether he would not to him that demands him, rather follow Rahabs pattern, and
say, He is gone away? No: his resolution would be that of Firmus, an holy
Bishop of Tagesta Aug. de mend c. 13
, St. Austins country, in Africa; when the Emperor (not then Christian)
required the delivery, or (at least) the discovery of a a Christian which he
had with great care hid from the Tyrant, resolutely answered, nec prodam, nec
mentiar, I will neither betray him, nor lie; from which resolution no torments
then inflicted (which were many and sharp) could draw, or force him.

Thus, this hypocrite loves vanity, and seeks after lies Psalm. 4.2
; the true Christian hates both; the one will not only lie, but plead for
lying; the other will not only avoid the practice, but stop his ears against
all Arguments brought to defend it.

This hypocrite with his tongue deceives his neighbor.

He pretends uprightness, love, and justice toward his neighbor. This is
the language of his tongue. He affects to be a fair spoken man, and to give
every one good words, especially him whom he means to swallow, as men use to
speak to dogs, which they intend to catch, and hang. The words of his mouth are
smoother than butter, when war is in his heart Psalm. 55.21
. Eat, says he, to thee, when his heart is not with thee Prove. 23.7
, but rather wishes every bit may choke thee. When thou art buying of him, he
makes use of his smooth tongue to overreach and defraud thee in the commodity,
or price, or both. Either he enters into some religious discourse, if he think
that will take most with thee, to make thee to trust him, for what he would put
into thy hand, and then seems offended or grieved, if you give him not his own
price, although unreasonable. What! do you think I would, or durst to deceive
you, says he? No, I am none of those; one word with me, is all. And so you
must be content to be over-reach't, to give him his price, and think your self
well used; or else, he throws by his wares, and tells you he has none at your
rates, and so parts with you in discontent: and while profane men cozen many,
by swearing; he, by his Yea and Nay deceives more.

Not that swearing is better in bargaining than Yea and Nay; or, that Yea and
Nay should be Items to a wise man not to deal, because the hypocrite with this
language cheateth, (for it is the only expression allowed by Christ, and the
Apostle, in ordinary discourse Mat. 5.37 Jam. 5.12
but, because cheating under this vizar is more abominable. For, as St. Austin
once said of lying, that a lie out of a Priscillianists mouth, was less to be
wondered at, because they held lying to be lawful; but a lie by an Orthodox
Christian is more intolerable, because he professes to abhor it as
abominable; so, cheating by swearing, is not so much to be abominated in a
profane man, (for he professes no better,) as deceiving, in Christ's own
language, by an hypocrite, whose very Profession teaches him better, and lays
a kind of command upon you to believe him upon his bare word, by which he
deceives.

The deceitful tongue is the hypocrites badge Psalm. 52.4
: a double heart is his Warehouse Psalm. 12.2
: no marvel then, if he give his mouth to evil, and his tongue frames deceit
Psalm. 50.19
; and, that vanity be the chief subject of his discourse. If he have a mind to
betray and destroy, he has sugared words dipped in Crocodiles tears to get you
into his net, as that wretched Ishmael did those eighty men that came from
Shilo, and from Samaria, to go to the House of the Lord, he went out to meet
them, weeping all along as he went, and said, Come to Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam, (whom he had before slain) and having gotten them into the midst of the
City, there he slew them Jer. 41.6, 7
. He carried himself as if he were a very Jonathan, when he was in truth a very
Ishmael, a crafty blood-sucker of his brethren, whom he drew into his net by
his tongue.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians tongue is wholly employed for his
neighbors good.

Not only when he is employed about, and discourses of Religion and heavenly
things for the good of edifying Ephesians. 4.29
; but in all his discourse and converse with him, he seeks his good, not his
harm. He will not only keep his tongue from lying thereby to deceive him, and
from evil and filthy communication thereby to corrupt him, but he will see that
his lips speak no guile Psalm. 34.13
, thereby to circumvent and defraud him. He will not only refrain all speech
that may hurt him, but he will use his tongue to the best advantage of his
neighbor, and rejoice in, and lay hold upon any opportunity to serve him. If
he be oppressed by evil tongues, he will be a Jonathan to speak for his
integrity. If he be in want, he will speak and write (as Paul did) for his
relief. If he want advise, he will be a faithful Counselor, that as ointment
and perfume rejoice the heart, so does the sweetness of a man's friend by
hearty counsel Prove 27.9
.

His tongue is not mercenary, or for hire, whether the cause be good or evil.
Where he finds it evil, no money shall tempt him to plead it. If it be good, no
bribe shall corrupt him to desert or neglect it. His speech is useful,
charitable, comfortable. He is a tongue for the dumb, and opens his mouth in
the cause of all such as are (causelessly) appointed to destruction Prove. 31.8
.

Thus, this hypocrite speaks sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he
imagines how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, but if he
find opportunity he will not be satisfied with blood Ecclus. 12.16
. The true Christians tongue, is always profitable, and safe, without covering
hatred by deceit. The words of the one are softer than oil, yet are they drawn
swords Psalm. 55.21
; but, while the words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood, the other,
by his mouth delivers them Prove. 12.6
. The tongue of the one is a trap for his neighbor, the other is his
protection.

This hypocrite is a slanderer of his neighbor.

His great delight is to hear and to tell tales, that he may walk with
slanders Jer. 6.28
; or, be a Spy, or Intelligencer to the slaunderer. If he can hear any news,
as an Athenian newes-monger Acts 17.21
; he is big of it, till he can be delivered of it to some others. If he can
hear none, he raises some, or causes others to do it, ( Report, says he,
and we will report it, Acts 20.10
) that he may not want wares for his Customers. And so he is a tale-hearer; or
a tale-maker, that by one of these he may be a talebearer; and so, a
slaunderer: turning his tongue into a scourge Job 5.21
, yea, into a sharp sword Psalm. 57 4
; and his speech, into the piercings of a sword Prove. 12.18
. For, the words of a talebearer are as wounds, that go down to the uttermost
parts of the belly. Prove. 18.8


He knows God has made a Law against raising reports, as well as receiving
reports Exodus 23.1
: for in one, he forbids both. And as well-knowing that he that will buy, or
make this ware, will vend it again. God expressly prohibiteth this divellish
trade, Thou shall not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people Rev 19.16
. The word, translated Tale-bearers is from (...) Rakel, (...) Rakel.
which properly signifies a Merchant or Pedlar that goes up and down the
Country, and offers wares at every man's door. So the talebearer utters
his tales and criminations of other men, as wares which he longs to vend at
very easy rates, to any man that will take them off his hand: and the more
secret the thing is, the more he desires to make it known, that it may be the
greater news. A talebearer reveals secrets Prove. 11.13
. And he will do it, although to the ruin of the parties whom it concerns.
He will carry tales, (or be a man of slanders) to shed blood Ezekiel. 22.9
. And this he will do, under pretense of friendship and good neighborhood to
him to whom he tells the tale; and perhaps to him also of whom he speaks;
for, he is grown so cunning in his trade, that when the slander is deepest, he
seems to be fullest of compassion, and wishes, he had gone an hundred miles
that it were not so: whereas he that is of a faithful spirit, would conceal the
matter Prove. 11.13
, if it were so.

But let God make what Laws he will against it, our hypocrite he is resolved
to be an Antinomian, (at least) in this point; and rather to turn devil, (as
the word Rakel (...) *
, by Aquila an ancient Greek Interpreter, Ibid.
is rendered) for he cares not what mischief he does, so he may have vent for
his tales and slanders. This is that for which Satan and this hypocrite bear
one name, because they are both of the same occupation. The devil has that
name from calumniating and false accusing of the godly, therefore is he called
the accuser of the brethren Rev. 12.9, 10
; And so, such as take pleasure in this trade, are called (...), devils 2 Timothy
3.3. See marg.
, that is, (as our Translators render it) false accusers, or make-bates. And,
for this Christ himself called Judas a devil Joh. 6.70, 71
, in relation to his delating and betraying of his Master. So that by this it
appears, how odious this hypocrite upon the very account of a talebearer and
slanderer, is unto God, being as reprobate-silver, who the Lord has rejected
Jer. 6.28, 30
.

For this, is he hated also of men, (although slanderers make use of him, as
some wicked Princes do of Traitors) A whisperer defiles his own soul, and is
hated wheresover he dwells, says the son of Syrach Ecclus. 21.28
. Therefore, says he, curse the whisperer, and double-tongued, for such have
destroyed many that were at peace. A backbiting tongue has disquieted many,
and driven them from Nation to Nation: strong Cities has it pulled down, and
overthrow the houses of great men. A backbiting tongue has cast out virtuous
women, and deprived them of their labors: who so hearkeneth to it shall never
find rest, nor dwell quietly Ecclus. 28.13 14, 15
. That which is translated a backbiting tongue, is, in the Original, (...), a
third tongue. And so the Chaldee Paraphrase expounds that of the Psalmist, Let
not an evil speaker be established Psalm. 140.11
, a man which speaks with a third tongue. For indeed hereby this hypocrite
hurts many at once. An evil tongue kills three, say the Hebrew Doctors, the
speaker, the receiver of the report, and the person spoken against. The two
first by the sin, the third, by the sword of his tongue.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian is tender and jealous of his brothers good name.

He knows that a good name is better than precious ointment Eccl. 7.1
. Costly ointments are reckoned among the treasures and happiness of Princes.
And he that robs a man of that, robs him of his choicest Jewels, the death
thereof is an evil death, the grave were better than it Ecclus. 28.21
. He knows that God shall destroy for ever, the man that loves devouring
words; he shall take him away, and pluck him out of his dwelling place, and
root him out of the land of the living Psalm. 52.5
. Seldom is a talebearer long lived, nor happy while he lives. Therefore the
Christian makes a door and a bar, both to his ear and tongue; that by the
one, tales may not enter; nor by the other, slip from him to wrong his
neighbor: for he that utters slanders is a fool Prove. 10.18
.

He will not take up an evil report against his neighbor Psalm. 15.3
: for this were to let the devil sit in his ear: nor will he report evil of
his neighbor; for this were to let the devil sit upon his lips, and to destroy
his neighbor. If he speak of the faults of others, it is only when he is
called, and cannot refuse without sin: nor will he seek to be called, for this
is all one upon the point, as to the matter of slander, as if he were not
called: for, hereby he, in effect, calls himself: And when he is called, and
must speak, he handles such sores as tenderly as may be with duty.

His tongue neither itcheth to tell tales, nor his ear to hear them. He will
neither be thief nor receiver. If any one about him be discovered to slander
his neighbor, although but privily, that is, by a secret whisper only, merely
to pick thanks, he looks upon it, as betonguing, or hurting his neighbor
with a third tongue, (as the Original bears it) and therefore resolves to cut
him off Psalm. 101.5
; not, to kill him, but to rid the house of him, as he after explains himself,
He that works deceit shall not dwell in my house, he that tells lies shall
not tarry in my sight Ver. 7
. For it is with him a received maxim, that should he do otherwise, all that
belong to him would soon learn the same trade; because, if a Ruler hearken to
lies, all his servants are (or will be) wicked. Prove. 29.12


Thus, this hypocrite speaks words like Doeg, concerning Ahimelechs relieving
of David Psalm. 52.2
; who spoke like the piercings of a sword Prove. 12.18
. The Christian speaks of his neighbor, (especially if godly) as Jonathan,
to the King his father, touching David, speaking good of him, saying, Let not
the King sin against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned
against thee, and because his works to thee-ward have been very good 1 Samuel 19.4
. The one, by the perverseness of the tongue, breaks the spirit, the other,
by the wholesomnesse of his tongue, is a tree of life Prove. 15.4
.

This hypocrites tongue mocketh his neighbor.

Hypocrisy must be witty, or the hypocrite will gain little by the trade. And
that which is fallacious, must be facetious, the better to excuse a fallacy
when it is discovered, and the more to engratiate the hypocrite that else would
lose by his juggling. Therefore this hypocrite must have somewhat to exercise
his wit upon, which is, his neighbor. For, he that makes so bold with God, as
to do what he can to mock him, will strain a point of friendship to abuse his
neighbor, with whom he thinks he may be more free. His wit is a jeering wit,
which delights most in scoffs and mocks! Seldom shall you find an hypocrite
of parts, but he is, (where he may be free) a great scoffer.

David found it so, as a type of Christ, whose enemies expressed their malice by
mocking, as much as by persecution: and, to say truth, there is no persecution
like mocking. Ishmael will mock at Isaac, till he be thrown out of doors Genesis
21.9, 10
. And this is by God himself, counted, and punished as persecution Gal. 4.29
. And it is also noted as the constant character of a man borne after the
flesh, that is, of a graceless wretch; such as the hypocrite always is, even
at his very best. In this he will not come behind very abjects, or the basest
of men. When he is in his feasts, and jollity, he lays aside his counterfeit
gravity, and not only sporteth himself with his own deceivings 2 Pet. 2.13
, laughing in his sleeve to see how many his counterfeit Sanctity has
deceived, but making bold to abuse those that truly fear God, with taunts and
mocks, as if that were no sin, but a piece of wit that deserves commendation.

Among all David's enemies, he was most cut to the heart with hypocritical
mockers at feasts Psalm. 35.16
: that is, with hypocrites that were facetious, and sanniones, mockers, that in
their feasts made him their sport. Therefore some read it, Hypocrites,
Scoffers for a cake of bread, (...) *
(for so the word sometimes signifies 1 Kings 17.12 Hos. 7.8
,) or for juncates, or dainty meats used in feasts. They will mock their
neighbors for good cheer, for their bellies when they sit at his table who
loves such mirth. So that, hypocrites are most apt to this at their belly-cheer
and banquets. When their bellies be full, their tongues walk, and mocking, for
sport and mirth, is their table-talk.

He thinks it excuse enough to say, Am not I in sport? I hope a man may be bold
with his friend in a way of merriment. But he never considers that such
jesting is linked with foolish talking, and both condemned and forbidden Ephesians 5 4
. His luxuriant wit dissolveth him at such times into a (...), or all manner of
scurrilous scoffing, to vex and gaul those whom he has a mind to abuse, so
he can but make sport to himself, and others who wholly give themselves to
foolish laughter, and dissolute mirth: and this is his (...), which he takes to
be lawful, but miserably and wilfully erreth therein. Nay, sometimes he
affects this kind of dicacity, as Vespasian S^et in Vesp. number. 12.
used to do, to take away the envy and clamor of some dishonest or uncomely
gain, turning off all with a merry jest, as that Emperor did, the gain he made
by urine, when he made his son smell to the money raised by it.

He little remembers the sad malediction that fell upon Cham for derision Genesis
9.22. and 25.
; and the dismal end of those two and forty children that mocked the Prophet
of God, saying, Go up thou bald-head, and were destroyed of Bears 2 King. 2.23
24.
. Nor does he consider that men's carriage in their cups and mirth; do lay open
their inward frame of spirit; and, that such an heart is little worth Prove.
10.20
. For jests many times show men's hearts in earnest; as the covetous and unclean
persons discover themselves by their mirth, to all persons of understanding. It
is a poor shift to say, Lasciva est pagina, vita proba est, though his lines be
wanton, his life is chaste; and, a base thing to make a fool in a play of
another man's good name.

He pleases himself, though he abuse others, and will lose his friend rather
than his jest. But seldom do such fools so lose their friend, but in the
conclusion, they lose themselves. The Philistines thought it not enough to make
Sampson grind in a mill after they had put out his eyes, and bound him with
fetters of brass; but they would needs at their great feast, call for Sampson
to make them sport: which Sampson did, but, to their cost. For, of three
thousand men and women, and the Lords of the Philistines, that beheld Sampsons
making of sport, not one escaped with his life Judge. 16.30
. So, many times, jest ends in earnest; that offense which is foolishly given,
is ill taken; and many, thinking so to make sport, as the Philistines did, pull
an old house about their ears, which is just upon them. It is ill making
others afraid of his wit, who has as much reason to be afraid of their
memories.

Contrariwise, the true Christian abhors mocking, Differ.
and cherishes the good of his neighbor.

He remembers his holy Profession, and walks worthy of it, in speech as well
as in action. He is enjoined to edify others, not to corrupt them Ephesians. 4.29
. To build them up in their holy faith, not to disgrace them Jude 20
; to provoke them to love and to good works Heb. 10.24
, not to wrath and fury by abusing of them. He knows that hard speeches, as
well as lewd actions must come to judgment; and, that condemnation is due to
evil words, as well as to evil works Mat. 12.37
. Therefore, if he see his neighbor in a fault, he counsels him with love
and pity, reproves him with gravity, and labors to restore him with the
spirit of meekness Gal. 6.1
.

As for that (...), or sober mirth, the product of a modest and chaste wit: he
sometimes sparingly uses it for some honest and seasonable recreating of a
mind tired with study, cares, labors, and standing in as much need of such
refreshing, as the body being weary, does of rest. If jesting once go beyond
Piety, so that God be dishonored; beyond charity, that his neighbor be
wronged, or beyond comeliness, that his wisdom and gravity be called into
question and himself disgraced, he presently disowneth and leaves it. Mirth he
likes; but, not such, as whereby the Spirit of God is grieved, the spirit of
his neighbor exasperated or his own spirit and grace questioned.

He exercises his tongue merrily, so as to be free from all wanton, obscene,
immodest, offensive expressions, or matter that may corrupt or offend any by
petulancy, biting, bitterness, or scoffing; as also from profaning Scripture,
or other things sacred: and that his mirth tend to some profit of the hearers,
as Elijahs mocking of the Priest of Baal, in the hearing of those whom they had
deluded; that it be suitable to his profession, calling, and gravity; not done
merely for vain mirth, or too often, as a thing delighted in for it self, or
otherwise, than other honest recreations ought to be, for the better quickening
of all that hear him to those more serious employments which become wise men
and Christians. Otherwise, he says of laughter, it is mad; and of mirth, what
does it Eccl. 2.2
?

Thus, this hypocrite is as Sanballet, mocking the Jews for that which
deserved incourogement Nehem. 4.1
; and, as Pilates soldiers, bowing the knee before Christ, and mocking him,
saying Hayle-King of the Jews Mat. 27.29
. The true Christian makes mirth, as Elijah did with Baals Priests, to
convince them, and instruct others. The one mocketh, and is mocked; the other
shunneth vain-mocking, and is honored of all.

This hypocrite employeth his tongue in magnifying of himself.

He that despises others, is a great admirer of himself, and none more than
the hypocrite, who makes himself his God. He will be sure to be of those who
justify themselves before man Luke 16.15
, and that is enough for him, although what he highly esteems, is abomination
in the sight of God. Whomsoever he wrongeth, he will be sure to do himself more
than right: but so, in conclusion, he does himself wrong. He speaks great
swelling words of vanity of his own sufficiency, worth, and actions, to draw
others to admire and trust him to the confusion of both 2 Pet. 2.18
. He cannot speak of himself, but with self applauding; and what others speak
touching any excellent action done by any other, he lays claim to, as bearing
a great share in it; I know whom he may thank for that, says he, meaning
himself, when another is praised.

Sometimes he seeks to exalt himself, by discommending those whom others
praise. If another be commended for a man of wit, learning, or parts, above
others, this hyhocrite makes a tush of all that is spoken; whereby he gives
you to understand, that the other party is not to be named the same day with
him. For he that disparageth another man's worth, does tacitly declare himself
to be more worthy; as those false Apostles, who decried Paul, intended thereby
to make themselves more eminent by lessening of him. But the end of
self-praisers drunken with pride, is first, to stagger and reel by gross
mistakes; than to fall into the ditch of some gross error, or foul
miscarriage of life; and lastly, to go off with scorn and derision, and to go
out like the snuff of a candle.

If he be a young man, he understands all things, before he be well
acquainted with himself: he needs not to be twice asked before he speak;
rather he will go on speaking till he be twice bidden to hold his peace. And
when he speaks, it is not so much for your good, as to let you see what a
rare man he already is. He minds not your edification, but your applauding of
him. Hang a bell at his ear to make him music, and he will give you leave to
lade him with work till his brains crack again. It is with him, as with some
young Professors of the same stamp, who by their own report have all knowledge,
and are all zeal; you cannot teach them any thing but they are past it: tell
them of keeping the Commandments, their answer is, all these have I kept from
my youth up Mat. 19 20
. This hypocrite has done more than he is bound unto, and more than any man
can teach him.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian is sparing to undertake for himself.

Let him deserve never so well, yet he forgets not that rule, Let another
praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips Prove.
27.2
. He will scarce trust another to do it, unless it be a stranger that will
deal impartially. He hears his own praise, with the same frame of spirit that
he hears dispraise and reviling. If he deserve not blame, he regards not
the railing; if he deserve it, he is careful to reform: so, if he deserve not
the praises given him, he takes no notice of them; if they be the shadow that
follows his well-doing, he will rather rise higher in virtue, and shorten the
shadow, than decline in well-doing to make the shadow longer. Praise may make
him more humbly diligent, than lift him with the pride, which he knows is the
next way to fall into the condemnation of the devil 1 Timothy 3.6
.

The better acquainted he is with himself, the more need he finds of those
Items. Be not high minded, but fear Romans 11.20
: and, let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall 1 Cor. 10.12
. He sees every day less reason to trust, and more cause to fear himself.
Therefore he abhors to commend himself, and is impatient when it is done by
others; not, out of cunning to attract more, but of consciousnesse of his own
many infirmities that make him (in his own opinion) unworthy of it. The longer
he lives, and the more he observes himself, the worse he likes himself. I see
(says he,) a great part of my zeal was but heat of blood. Many of my prayers
were but rhetorical expressions, not cordial breathings of an hungry soul:
much of my sorrow for sin, was no better than worldly, for my shame sustained,
or punishment threatened; my tears were but water spilt upon the ground, not
fit for Gods bottle.

He is even afraid to speak the truth for himself, when he is most put to it,
and even others as well as himself have need of it, for his just vindication
from unjust aspersions and calumnies. When he does it, he will choose rather to
do it in a third person, than in his own, as that blessed Apostle, I knew a man
in Christ, etc 2 Cor. 12.2
. Wheresoever he mentions any grace, or sufficiency in himself, he carefully
puts it off to the account of God; not I, but the grace of God that was in me 1
Cor. 15.10
. If he have any thing to glory in, he puts it upon Christ, I have whereof I
may glory through Jesus Christ Romans 15.17
. If he be able to want, and to abound, to be full, and to be hungry, to
abound, and to suffer need, he tells you by whom he does it, I can do all
things through Christ, which strengthens me Phil. 14.12, 13.
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Saul, angry, if more be ascribed to David, than to
him 1 Samuel 18.8
. The true Christian is like Gideon, that if any chide him for assuming that
work to himself, which drew all the praise after it, he will rather put the
praise upon them as being better able to do the work Judge. 8.1, 2, 3
. The one, the less he knows himself, the more he boasts and commends
himself; the other, the more he is acquainted with himself, the less he finds
cause to like himself, and the more, to wait till the Lord commend him 2 Cor.
10.18
, when every good man is to expect his praise from God.

CHAP. XXXII. The Idle Hypocrite Is he whose business it is to be idle, or
worse. Defin.

IT is hard to give him a right name; and therefore not easy to give him an
apt description. Whether he may be more fitly termed the Busy Hypocrite, whose
business is idleness; or, the Idle Hypocrite, whose idleness is his
business, it is not easy to determine. For, either he sets himself on work,
but to no purpose; and so, his business is no better than idleness: or, he
presumes it is work enough for him to keep himself out of work; and so, his
idleness is his business.

Hardly will the body possessed of an active spirit, be idle; but, never the
mind: something it will do. But, if that something about which he busieth
himself be as good as nothing, I mean as bad, or rather something worse; we
shall do him a favor, at least a right, to account him idle; and, his
occupation, an idleness, under color of business; and rightly term him, The
idle Hypocrite: the busy Idler, or the idle Busie-body. He either does
nothing, and then, all his business is, to defend his idleness: or, that
which he does, is worse than if he did nothing, and so his business is but
idleness.

One idleness in him (which is the child of sloth, whereby he is without
emploiment) begets another idleness, which is the fruit of the former, opening
the door to all manner of wickedness. What the Apostle speaks of wanton
women, is too true of men also, When they learn to be idle, they wander about
from house to house; and are not only idle, but tatlers also, busybodies,
speaking (and doing too) things which they ought not to do 1 Timothy 5.13
. None walk so disorderly, as they who work not at all, but are busybodies 2
These. 3 11
. So that he is never more idle, than when he is most busy in that which
idleness sets him upon.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is truly diligent, and constantly well
employed.

He knows that God himself works John 5.17
, and will admit of no loiterers and idle persons about him Mat. 20.6
. He that will have his penny, must work in his vineyard. And he that works
receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal John 4.36
. Therefore he dares not be idle, nor ill employed. And he works the works of
God, that is, such as God allows and sets him about, without picking and
choosing his own work. What (says he unto God) will thou have me to do? No
work seems amiss to him that is wholly for God. Nor will he, with the
sluggard, delay time, (yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding
of the hands to sleep); But he works while it is day, before the night
comes, wherein no man can work John 9.4
. He glorifieth God on earth, that he may be glorified by God in Heaven John
17.4
.

He so emproveth time, and business, that even his idleness, (if I may so
call his vacant hours) that is, his necessary rest, his leisure, is not
without some diligence; because it tends to fit him for business. He sleeps,
to rise and go about his work, not to pamper sloth; he eats, as Elias did, to
walk in the strength of his food, the way that God sends him 1 King. 19.7, 8
, not to gratify his throat, or belly. So, on the other side, his labor, in
regard of contentment and delight in doing Gods Will, is unto him a rest, being
of the nature of Heaven, Coeli motus, quies: the rest of Heaven is perpetual
motion, which being interrupted would disturb all. He is never better pleased
than when God gives him his hands full of work; nor more restless, than when
God does not employ him.

Thus, this hypocrite embraces idleness as his work, and work, as his
idleness: the true Christian embraces work as his meat, and shunneth idleness
as his bane: the one has no business, but his idleness, the other has no
time for idleness, for his business.

This hypocrite, being found idle, pleads safety, and necessity for his
idleness.

He would work as hard as any man, if he durst. But, to labor were as much as
his life were worth: so sloth pleads for him. As if health were to be
preserved by idleness, the bane of health; or, eyesight, by continual
winking. That with him is healthy, which destroys the end of health,
emploiment for God. He dares not go to plow in winter for fear of cold Prove.
20 4
; habebit frigore febrim, the cold will bring an Ague upon him. Nor will he go
abroad early, for fear of a Lion in the way Pro. 26.13, 14
, better lie a bed and turn as the door on the hinges, than be slain in the
streets. Better entertain poverty in bed, than an Ague in the field, or meet a
Lion in the Wood. The way of duty is to him an hedge of thorns Prove. 15.19
; therefore he must tread gingerly, or not at all: yea, it is (by his telling)
more than he can safely do, to pull his hand out of his bosom, to put it to
his mouth, to feed himself; his hand may take more cold by the way, than his
meat is worth Prove. 9.24
,

How many such hypocrites has the Commonwealth, as well as the Church. Such
are good, neither for Common, not private wealth: good for nothing, but fruges
consumere, to make riddance of what others provide, and to consume Gods
blessings upon their lusts Jam. 4.3
, which should be emproved to his glory. For their own particular; If they
escape clothing with rags, yet it will not be long ere their house drop
thorough, and that poverty come upon them as one that travelleth by the way,
and their necessity as an armed man Prove. 6.11
. For the public, they threaten to bring whole Nations under tribute to
maintain their idleness and voluptuousness. Plato compares idleness in a
State, to phlegm and choler in the body, which are the common causes of all
sickness. If so, then sure our State has much need of Agarick and Rhubarb, if
not Hellebore, to purge this peccant, lethargical, epidemical humor.

This hypocrite is one of those many in our Lords Vineyard, who are too ready
to hearken to Satan's counsel, Spare thy self, short not life with too much
study and toil, take heed of a consumption, etc. He pretends age and
infirmity disabling from Gods work before he needs, and makes night before
Sunsetting: as they that being to act a Comedy in the day, shut up the
windows, and make an artificial night. Or, he is of the mind of that slothful
servant, who that his Lord (forsooth) might be no loser, wrapped up his talent in
a napkin, and so made sure that he should be no gainer.

Contrarily, the true Christian knows his ^afety lies in diligence. Differ.


He finds that the diligent hand makes rich Prove. 10.4
, and has an assurance that the soul of the diligent shall be made fat Prove.
13.4
. He knows Winter-husbandry to be most useful, although most painful. In
Summer every sluggard will with the snake, peep abroad. There are twelve hours
in his day Joh. 11.9
, and till they be expired, all the Lions in the Wood or World shall not be
able to worry him 2 Timothy 4.17, 18.
, nor the foxes to entrap him. He has experience that, walking in Gods way he
is in Gods keeping Luke 13.31 32.
. But, out of the way of duty, he may (like enough) meet with a Lion, as the
disobedient Prophet 1 Kings 13.24
: or, with a storm, a wrack, a whale, as fugitive Jonah Jon. 1.17
, to swallow, not to save: but, walking diligently in his calling, he is within
the hedge, and pale of Providence, and under the guard of the holy Angels Psalm.
34.7
.

He dreams not of ease till he has done his work: then he is sure to rest from
his labors in the Heavens. Nor cares he to take up his rest while he is in his
journey, As he has here do abiding City, but seeks one to come Heb. 13.14
. So he fears that doom, He that takes his ease in this world, shall travel
in the next, He is more afraid of the serpent, if he should lean upon the wall
Amos 5.19
, as weary of work, than of a Lion, while he walks in Gods way. He flees
idleness as the enemy of health, the consumption of thrift, the foil of
virtue, the hindrance of wisdom, and the hatred of God.

Thus, this hypocrite works not for fear of danger; the true Christian works
himself out of danger: the one by his fear, pulls upon him the thing feared,
the other by his diligence, preventeth that fear.

This hypocrite is idle, that he may not be, nor thought to be, covetous.

Let him be but idle, and he will tell as fair a tale of self-denial, in
regard of seeking to himself great things; as if his idleness were not a vice,
making him to refuse working; but, a virtue, forbearing work, to prevent the
vice of the worldling. A mean, yea, poor estate, (forsooth) contents his
moderate mind, not as seeking higher life; but, as choosing rather a dogs
life, with hunger and ease, than the life of the industrious Christian, which
abhors to be idle. He likes not those that are so eager to earne and get, for
he likes not the labor: from hand to mouth is as much as he seeks, for he is
resolved on his ease. And is it not a virtue to be content with small means?
yea, to be patient in poverty, rather than to be always drudging and toiling?
Thus who so contented a man in show, as our idle hypocrite?

Indeed, idle persons are ordinarily, for any act they do (saving for wishes)
good-fellowes, and nearer of kin to the waster Prove. 18.9
, than to the niggard. But, first, if at any time they chance to work, they set
an higher price on their labor, than any diligent person can find in his
heart to do; because it toiles their lazy bones more for want of use; and their
little work must bear out a great time of idleness both before and after.
Next, if we enter into their thoughts and wishes, we shall find them to covet
more than any man can earne. The sluggard, even when his hands refuses to
labor, coveteth greedily all the day long; but the righteous gives and
spares not Prove. 21.26
. And what is the issue but this, the one gives, and has plenty Prove. 11.25
; the other wishes, and his soul has naught. And, when that armed man comes
indeed upon him, he finds it another manner of burden than he dreamed of, to
bear poverty. When the rain beats through the decayed roof, and the wind
blows thorough his ragged coat, when his garden yields him nothing but thorns
and nettles, when he shall beg and no man take pity on him, and find plenty of
only one thing, poverty; then shall that come to pass, the desire of the
slothful slays him, because his hands refuse to labor Prove. 21.25
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian labors that he may avoid covetousness.

He seeks to cut off vain wishings and wouldings, that he may not bring himself
into the tentation of unnecessary poverty, through his own default. He is
afraid to eat the bread or idleness, lest it make him relish the bread of
deceit, or of theft. For, if poverty even of Gods sending does occasion men
(through their own corruption) to steal and take the Name of God in vain Prove.
30.9
: how much more when they bring it on themselves? If it be so dangerous, as our
portion here, how much more as our purchase! A Christian therefore never takes
himself to be out of the rank of thieves, until he labor with his hands the
thing that is good Ephesians. 4.28
: and he looks upon it as a tempting of God, to look for plenty without pains.
Profit is entailed on labor; In all labor there is profit Prove. 14.23
. He will not therefore be wanting unto Providence, nor disable himself for the
blessing promised to labor. And, seeing the idle and confident never thrive,
the diligent and diffident, no better; for he either thrives not, or thinks not
that he thrives; the Christian joins discretion and faith to his diligence,
and so is sure of the blessing.

Thus, this hypocrite flying labor, falls into covetousness; the diligent
Christian avoideth covetousness by falling to his labor; the one the less he
labors, the more greedily he craveth; the other, the more diligence he
uses, the less satisfies him.

This hypocrite pretends he has a Calling, (and therefore a warrant) to be
idle.

He has a large estate whereon to live without pains taking. He needs not to
spend more than what is his own already. Therefore he concludes God requires
not him to work. It is calling enough to look to what he has, and to spend it
nobly. Indeed there is a rank of people called the Gentry, whom I honor in
regard of place, and many of them much more in regard of worth; and happy are
the places where such plants do grow. But I cannot but bewail the abuse of
that, as of all other blessings and honors conferred on men, the generality of
them being possessed with this opinion, that such must live at the height, and
spend all their time in pleasures and idleness no way conducing to the common
good, but much to the prejudice of it; as if God, like Augustus had built an
Apragopolis, a City void of business, and a nursery of idleness, for them
here upon earth: or had made them only to play up and down the world, as
Leviathan, upon the waters Psalm. 104.26
.

But idleness is tolerated only in the devils dominions, such as Laish, where
the people dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians quiet and secure,
-- and had no business with any man Judge. 18 7
. But where God rules, and people own him for their God, it is otherwise.
Never any man (I take it) had larger possessions than Adam, who was the only
absolute Monarch of the whole world; nor was any mere man more noble, for he is
styled the Son of God Luke 3.38
. If any exceeded him in riches, and Nobility, it was only the Lord Jesus, the
only natural Son of God, and heir of all things Heb. 1.2
. Yet it pleased not God, that either Adam in Paradise, in the state of
innocence; or his Son, appearing in our flesh, should be without a Calling, or
idle in it Genesis 2.15
All other creatures are servants, first to God, and then to man; to teach man
to be a servant, John 9.4
first to God, and then to humane society. The Angels themselves are ministering
spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation Heb.
1.14
. Yea, God himself whom all things serve, has care of all things which he has
made, and hitherto works John 5.17
.

Neither heaven or earth afford a pattern for an idle person; nor scarce, Hell*
For the devil himself is busy, going to and fro in the earth, and walking up
and down in it Job 1.7
Not idly, but as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour 1 Pet. 5.8
. But herein he jumps with the others; he does nothing but what he has a mind
to. A goodly difference between a Gentleman and an Yeoman, that this man must
do all the good, the other none. When he is once born, all his work is done,
and there is as much use of him at four years old, as at forty, viz. to be
waited upon. Possibly he may in the midst of all his rovings and wasteful
expenses abroad, put his wife to be his drudge at home, and make her labors
maintain his idleness. She must work in looking to his business, to get money
for him to waste among good-fellowes, pot-companions, horses, dogs, hawks,
harlots, any thing to help away an estate, where he has withdrawn himself.
But herein he uses her worse than the savage Indians, who though they make
their wives to work, yet work themselves also.

Much honor is due to the Gentleman that is a Statesman, Magistrate, Student,
Merchant, Soldier, that serves his Country, (there are emploiments enough for
ingenuous and noble spirits to avoid the mechanical:) but he that is only a
Gentleman, and will do nothing but be a Gentleman, will not be long without a
Surname fit for him, from some vice to which he addicts himself, (for such
persons, the more idle, the more busy in wickedness) as namely, a
Gentleman-swearer, a Gentleman-swaggerer, a Gentleman-gamester, a
Gentleman-drunkard, a Gentleman-whoremonger; and after all, a Gentleman-thief,
or a Gentleman beggar; all which are out of all predicaments of goodness,
ingenuity and honor, staining the name of a Gentleman, and shaming not only
his Ancestors, but the Christian Religion.

The Germans call such Edil-men, and have a dangerous Proverb that such are
venison in heaven, or rather for the devil in hell. The Lacedaemonians allowed
their Gentry vacations from handy-crafts, but they seldom or never suffered
their youth to be without generous action, but trained them up in
martial-discipline, or other ingenuous and useful education. But the Athenians
(herein a wiser people) condemned and punished idleness in whomsoever they
found it. But whatever the world allow, or punish, a Christian standerh or
falls to his own Lord and Master, whose doom will be certainly this, Cast the
unprofitable servant into utter darkness, where shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth Mat. 25.30
. It will then be a bad plea before him, to say, Lord, I lived and died a
Gentleman: when Christ can answer, I, who was better borne than you every way,
was feign to labor hard, for such as you, (had you the grace to lay hold on
the benefit of it) but I never took all that pains to allow you in idleness,
but to work in my Vineyard Mat. 20
, O how many shall be deceived and perish for ever in this gross deceit, who
think (with Galba) Nemo rationem otii sui reddere cogetur Suet. in Galb.
, no man shall be called to account for his idleness!

On the contrary, the true Christian, whatever his revenews, or degree be,
Differ.
looks upon himself as a servant bound to do service.

He stands in Gods family as a servant, although a King. Oh Lord, says
David, truly I am thy servant, I am thy servant, and the son of thine
handmaid Psalm. 116.16
. Not only in complement, or for state, as some Noblemen are to Princes; but,
as doing him real service. And such an one was his mother before him, namely,
an Handmaid to God; and Handmaids are not idle. Moses was faithful in all Gods
House as a servant. Yea, Christ himself, although he were a Son, was his
fathers servant Heb. 3.5
. Behold my servant, whom I uphold, says God Isa. 50.1
; who, though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he
suffered Heb. 5.8
. He never needed the rod or spur, he never did any thing amiss, nor omitted
the least duty, yet he endured much hardship to give proof of his obedience,
when it pleased the Lord to bruise him Isa. 53.10
, albeit his delight was only to do the Will of God Psalm. 40.8
.

Nor is he a servant at large, but in some particular calling, wherein he
abides with God 1 Cor. 7.24
, whether it be in the Magistracy ruling with God Hos. 11 12
, that is, ruling for God, and being faithful with the Saints. And so he is a
servant unto all. Thus, as David, he serves his generation by the Will of God
Acts 13.36
. Or, whether it be in the Ministry, so he is a servant of Jesus Christ Romans
1.1.
. Thus Paul, in behalf of all faithful Ministers, We preach not our selves, but
Christ Jesus the Lord, and our selves your servants for Jesus sake. Yea, he
that is highest in the family, 2 Cor. 4.5
must be a servant to the family, or the family will not long thrive in estate,
or order. Hence that of Plato, (...). In every house there is one servant, the
Lord of the house. None does so duly and dearly earne his bread as the Master
of the family, doing his duty, or the Minister that labors (or sweateth) in
the Word and doctrine 1 Timothy 5.17
. Or the Magistrate in the Commonwealth, watching for the good of the whole,
waking for them when they sleep, exposed to danger that their people may be in
safety. And well may they eat the bread of the Governor Nehem. 5 14
, who scorn to eat the bread of idleness; well may they eat and drink of the
best, that abhor the bread of wickedness, and the wine of violence Prove 4 17
; and that eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness Eccl. 10.17
; not so drinking, as to forget the Law (or Decree) and pervert the judgment of
the children of affliction Prove. 31.5
.

Thus, this hypocrite abuses his honor and estate as a protection unto
idleness; the true Christian interprets it as a charge to do the more
service: the one is as the rich man, whose ground brought forth plentifully,
and says unto his soul, thou have much good laid up for many years, take
thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry Luke 16.19
, but, that night had his soul taken from him Ver. 20
; the other is, in his way, as the virtuous woman in hers, she seeks wool and
flax, and works willingly with her hands Prove. 31.13
: She rises also while it is yet night, and gives meat to her household Ver. 15
. She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaffe Ver. 19
: not for need, for, She considers a field, and buyeth it, with the fruit of
her hands she planteth a vineyard, strength and honor are her clothing Ver. 25
. Her husband is a person of quality, a Magistrate, that is known in the gates,
when he sits among the Elders of the land Ver. 23
. The one is a Patron of all effeminacie and lewdness, like Sardanapalus, and
Nero, and takes up his lodging in hell Luk 16.19, 23.
. The one is a pattern to all such Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen too, that expect
their portion in Heaven.

This hypocrite is idle under color of Religion.

He thinks Religion is calling enough for him: to spend all his time in
reading, praying, hearing conference, etc. as if Religion were a discharge from
outward and civil affairs, and imported a vacation from all service of men.
Indeed he is so bought with a price, as not to serve men, as to forsake or
dishonor him that has bought him. But yet Religion discharges not, nor
disannulleth his former vocation of life, if lawful: for, every man is
commanded in the same vocation wherein he was called, (that is, where^n God
found him, when he first called him into Christ) therein to abide with God 1
Cor. 7.20.24
: and, to abide so, as not to relinquish duty to men, by which he may bring
honor to God.

Indeed there are a sort of men, who ( Pharaoh-like) account all men devoutly
disposed to be a company of idle ones, that pretend Religion for a cloak of
idleness, saying to such as desire sometimes for religious duties, ye are
idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go, and do sacrifice to the Lord
Exodus 5.17
. If their servants redeem time, by working extraordinarily, to read, or pray,
they give them more work, that they may not think on such toys, as such
profane beasts blasphemously call those religious duties. But there are not
none, but too many such hypocrites as now is spoken of, who give too much
occasion to such enemies so to blaspheme; who use their freedom as a cloak for
all their idleness, wantonness, purloining from their Masters, or defrauding
of others: who think and affi^m that it well becomes them to say to their
Masters* or Parents, we are the servants of Christ, we must go about his
business, as Christ did Luke 2.49
, about his fathers. We must have our liberties to hear where we think fit, and
when we think fit, and to confer with good Christians, etc. when perhaps they
go to hear the devil preach in a Brothel-house, or gad, as Dinah, till they
come home with a great belly, or so hardened in stubbornness, pride, and
idleness, that they are the stain of Religion, and the scum of the Country.

But this hypocrite is, for the most part, his own man (for, a servant to
Christ, he is not:) he has no body to control him. He is a great Professor, a
diligent hearer of every good Preacher that he can go or ride unto. He is a
great discourser of the Sermon, repeats it (not to his own family when he comes
home; but) to others abroad, where he may be noted for his zeal and devotion,
and perhaps get a good dinner for his pains, but neglects the care of his
family; and so under the name of a zealous Christian, he becomes worse than an
infidel 1 Timothy 5.8
. He pretends more than ordinary acquaintance with God; but strangers from
duty are strangers to God; To whom he will say, I never knew you, depart, ye
workers of iniquity. Of what use were the Moon, if always in coitu, keeping so
close to the Sun, as never to give any light of her own? better for the world
to see some short eclipse, than to have always such a conjunction. And it were
not worse for the world, that such hypocrites did openly declare their close
impieties, than to make Religion their cloak for all the idleness and
wickedness, which they under a color of devotion, are guilty of.

In this kind, the Popish Monks and Votaries, (of whom the Cardinals
themselves long since complained to Pope Paul the third, that there were then
too many Orders already, and therefore did oppose all they could, his erecting
of that Society of hellish Locusts, the Jesuits) are the Bell-weathers, and
may wear the Garland. To whom that of the Cretians truly belongs, always
liers, evil beasts, slow bellies Tit. 1.12
. It is said in Spain, You shall hardly see a fat man, but he is either a
Priest, or a Friar. As the green-sicknesse is reckoned the Maids disease, so
this Lurdanisme Or Lurconisme, from Lurcones, Belly-gods.
, has crept in by little and little upon the single and monastical life, since
it went out of fashion for Priests to preach, and for Monks to labor.

But no work does so try and tire the patience of the spiritual Idler, as Gods
work, this is a weariness with a witness, which he snuffeth at Mal. 1.13
, at least in private. No time so grudged at, as that which is spent in any
(especially extraordinary) humiliation, or seeking of God, and with such gaping
yawnings ill-favouredly endured, as the time of hearing and prayer. Then, the
hour seems tripled, like to Germane-miles; and every minute over and above the
hour, makes him secretly to gnash his teeth at the Minister, and even to curse
the action it self.

Contrarily, the true Christian by Religion is kept from idleness. Differ.


Religion teaches him with quietness to work, and to eat his own bread 2
These. 3.12
. If he be a servant, he will not despise his Master, because in Christ, they
are brethren, but rather do him service, because he is a believer 1 Timothy 6.2
, that the Name of God, and his doctrine be not blasphemed. If he be free from
the yoke of men, he is so much the more freely a servant both to God, and to
men for Gods sake. Christian-Liberty is a blessing wherein his faith rejoices;
but Christian-obedience to Superiors, care of humane and Christian-society,
and with good will doing service to God and man, is as much an article of his
faith, as the other. He will work with his hands the thing that is good, that
he may (rather) have to give to him that needs Ephesians. 4.28
, than through idleness to draw upon himself a necessity of receiving: for
well he remembers the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed
to give than to receive.

He knows that, as one said of Physic, Ars longa, vita brevis; the Art is
long a learning, but life is short to learn it in: so it is much more to be
said of Christianity, much work, little time; the days of darkness, which are
many Eccl. 11.8
, make haste; the night comes, wherein no man can work, therefore it behooves
him to work while it is day John 9 4.
. Let others count business too scant for the time, and expend the supposed
superfluity thereof in play, (and indeed recreation is then over-loved, and
over-used, when it is either used for lack of business, or preferred before
business) but the diligent Christian always finds the time too short for his
work, though happily, his strength, too short for the time; and so, must allow
more than he could well, etc. willingly spare for necessary refection.

Thus, this hypocrite pretends to serve God, that he may have a color to be
idle, but the true Christian shakes off idleness that he may industriously
serve God; the one turns Religion into idleness, the other makes it his
Religion not to be idle.

This hypocrite will do evil, that he may not be idle.

Such as the hypocrites colors which he has for his idleness, are, such are
his pretenses of business, which makes him an idle busie-body. Esau was a type
of this hypocrite: his name imports him a Doer; and such he was, but a
mis-doer. His pains-taking is the devils diligence, not Gods service. He that
leaves off to understand, and to do good, will soon imagine mischief upon his
bed, and set himself in a way that is not good Psalm. 36.3, 4.
. The idle head is Satan's forge; and the idle heart, his field Mat. 13.25
. No marvel then, if this sluggards field, and Vineyard too, be all grown over
with thorns, and the face thereof covered with nettles Prove. 24.31
: (He either pricks, or stings all that look for fruit from him;) yea, that he
be altogether become a briar, and a very thorn Isa. 7 24
. The best of them is a briar; and the most upright, sharper than a thorny
hedge Mic. 7.24
. A fearful example thereof is seen even in David himself, (although no
hypocrite) in whose heart, when he was idle, were sowed the rates of lust,
which brought forth prodigious fruits: how much more then, where no fear of
God is sown before?

Sodom had not so abounded in vices, but for the abundance of idleness that
was in her Ezekiel. 16.49
. Augustus his Apragopolis, the City of Idlers will prove King Philips
Poneropolis the City of evildoers. For, idle persons and evildoers are
fellow-Citizens, and inter-commoners. Sloth is pulvinar Satanae, the devils
pillow, of which he that takes counsel shall never do well; he may have work
enough, that goes to him to be set on work. But, as Argos was anciently the
mother City of Greece, until the Citizens became (...), Idlers, so Idleberg is
a mother-City, and swarms with inhabitants; not, in the Israel of God, but in
the Egypt of the world. Idleness is a mother-sin, fruitful in issue. It is not
only a kind of theft in it self, (as the Apostles opposition shows, let him
that stole, steal no more, but rather let him labor Ephesians. 4.28
), but also a cause of poverty, the source of mischief. So (...), and (...),
idleness, poverty, and evil-doing, are conjoined as so many links in a chain.
Isocrates.
Poverty, if it be the fruit of idleness, is the mother of mischief.

What a number of unprofitable Arts and Artifices are devised under pretense of
avoiding idleness, which yet in the issue introduce poverty, and make way for
mischief! Of this kind are Play Houses, (those Panders to the Stews,)
Tipling-houses, Gaming-houses. Bowling-allies, where men either win without
right, or lose without need; and ^o forfeit either their conscience, or their
patience. The name of pastime is a Pasport for any lewd exercise. No project
comes amiss to hunt away precious time, that should be taken by the fore-lock,
and therewith the opportunity of doing or receiving good.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian avoideth idleness by doing something that is
good.

As the wise man breaks silence by speaking something that is better than
silence, so the wise Christian breaks off idleness by doing something that is
better than doing of nothing. His rule is not only to labor, but chiefly to
see that the thing he labors in be worth his labor Ephesians. 4.28
. He joyneth choice, with his diligence, for he will guide his affairs with
discretion Psalm. 112.5
. The wise man has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness
Eccl. 2.14
, for want of eyes to see, even when he has light before him. Therefore any
thing serves his turn, so he be doing, and that what he does be not worth the
doing.

But the Christian will meddle with nothing, till he be able to answer himself
that question, Cui bono? What is it good for? Is it my Calling, or within it?
or in the way to it? does it prepare me for it, or quicken me in it? does it
make me work more cheerfully, or fruitfully? He does not work to gratify the
lusts either of others or himself, but to please God. When he is alone, be
employeth his mind with honest cares, and that at all times: and so, he
neither leaves room for the devils tares, because his field is sown; nor time
for the devil to sow them, because he watches his field continually.

Thus, this hypocrite would reckon his working to God, though he work for the
devil: the true Christian approves himself to God his Father; both in that he
works, and in what he works: the one is as the mad man, that rather than
sit still, will cast firebrarnds, arrows, and death Prove. 26.18
: the other, is as the virtuous woman, that will do good, and not evil, all the
days of her life?

This hypocrites business begins and ends in thinking of business.

If he be not so active as others, yet his thoughts are still at work, and he
is fore-casting what to do, and how to do it; but he never goes about to effect
what he makes you believe he has thought upon. He lies in bed too long to do
much work; but that time (he tells you) he spends in forecast: but after he is
risen, he goes not about the work. He viewes the weather, and observes the
wind so much, that he neither finds time to sow, nor reap Eccl. 11.4
. But yet, in musing and wishing, he has, in his own opinion, made a good
days work.

The name of sluggards, (Otiosi,) sounds as if it were compounded of earnest
wishing O Si! O Si! And, when he has his wish, then he will work, if you will
believe him. When he is rich, then he will be a good husband: when he is a
Bishop, he will preach, Meanwhile you must trust him. Stultus semper incipit
vivere. The fool is every day beginning to live, but when he comes to begin, he
thinks it better to go another way to work. He never discharges his present
function well, whose mind runs upon another. He never comfortably enjoys his
present means or estate, who aims at a greater. His heart must always faint,
that feeds on hopes deferred Prove. 13.12
. All his life-long, he thinks of making his Will, yet dies intestate: he
intends works of charity, yet dies uncharitable. He purposes to repent, yet
dies impenitent. The time is not yet come, (say the idle lingering people) that
the Lords house should be builded Hag. 1.2
.

Hereto conduces a melancholic constitution, which is busy in thinking, idle
in performance, because unsettled in resolution; full of meditation, empty of
action; fitter to be his own Executioner than Executor. He is disputing what he
is, till he cease to be Dum quid fis dubitas, jam potes esse nihil.
. Before he can agree with himself which work to begin first, it is time to
leave work, or rather not to work at all. And so, not as Moses, but as the
sluggard, He spends his years as a tale that is told Psalm. 90.9
.

Contrarily, the wise Christian so thinks of business, Differ.
as to get up and be doing.

He orders his affairs by serious fore-casting, and brings his thoughts into
action. He redeemeth the time Ephesians. 5.16
in working, which he spends in contriving. In the morning he sows his seed,
and in the evening he suffers not his hand to rest Eccl. 11.6
, till all be sown: that if one fail, he may not be unprovided; and, if both
prosper, he may find a double blessing, He makes use of the daylight of
prosperity, that he may not grind in the mill in the days of darkness
approaching. He will not lie a bed by day, with purpose to work in the night by
candle. His works are works of the light, therefore he puts not off working
till it be dark.

If I live long, says he, yet my work is more than my days, and I shall be
longer dead than alive, (and there is no working in the grave) and happily, while
he lives he may be longer sick than in health; whereby he may through infirmity
be in as bad condition, for disability to work, as the woman that lives in
pleasure, through impiety, dead while he lives 1 Timothy 5.6
. Therefore whatsoever his hand finds to do, he does it with all his might,
because there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave
whither he goes Eccl. 9.10
. Whatever he wishes for, he turns his wishes into prayers, and seeks the
effect of his prayers in his faithful labors; not gaping, with his hands in
his pockets, nor expecting a return of prayers without conscionable diligence:
for he knows that God looks that his children should pray, as they eat, eating
for strength to labor: and to be ready to go about that to which they pray to
be enabled: and to receive that as a consequent of industry, which they seek as
a fruit of a bounty.

Thus, this hypocrite is big of thoughts, which perish in the womb, for want of
birth: the true Christian, is as Rachel and Leah, that builded up Israel by the
fruit of the womb Ruth 4.11
: the one supposes good thoughts will serve for want of good works, and so he
and his thoughts perish together; the other, adds, works to his thoughts, and
so lives for ever.

This hypocrite makes it his business to talk of business.

Ignavus opere, loquax. A slothful hand has a busy tongue; what he wants in
work, he makes up in talk; and he that will take words for deeds, shall have
good measure, pressed down, and shaken together. The sluggard is always
talkative; which makes him so poor, because, as the saying is of the
Nightingale as well as of the Cuckoe, vox est, and praeterea nihil. He is a
voice, but nothing more. He can talk well, but that is all, which in the wise
man's observation is a poor trade, In all labor there is profit, but the talk
of the lips tends only to poverty Prove. 14.23
. Yet this folly is too common, because idle persons are so many. Talk is a
cheap entertainment, and better accepted of busybodies, than an invitation to
work; but the after-reckoning proves dear to both. Not he that says Lord,
Lord, but he that does the Will of the Father, gets Heaven Mat. 7
.

If talk may go for business, this hypocrite will perform his share, without
diminution. He is like people in a market, that use many words but make few
bargains. In the field a tale takes up the day as well as a journey, or other
labor. He is as an idle servant that talks away the day that should be spent
in his Masters business. But, if he be in the field, and bring home an empty
bag and bottle at night, that is enough. But as he said, operam conduxi, non
orati^nem. I hired an hand, not a tongue; I expected labor, not prattling So
will this hypocrite find in the issue, that he that being bidden by his father
to go work in his vineyard, was not adjudged to do the Will of his father,
although he gave his father good language, and said I go Sir, but went not Mat.
21.30, 31.
. His motto may be Verbo tenus; As far as words will go, have with you; or,
re infecta; the work not done. Such an one can neither be virtuous, for talking
imprints no habit; nor prudent, for words work no experience; nor wealthy, for
the idle hand beguiles the mouth; and justly, because the tongue discharges
the hand.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians works speak more than his tongue.

His works speak for him, and praise him in the gates Prove. 31.31
: He finds that he has two hands, and but one tongue; to advise him that his
deeds be more than his words. In the multitude of words, as well as dreams,
there are diverse vanities. Therefore he watches over his tongue, lest it send
forth idle words, which like vagrants, may fall into the hands of justice;
knowing that of every idle word account must be given Mat. 12.36
. He hates the occupation of words that are uttered in stead of works. Not
that he declineth good language; but, he accounts eloquence without action, to
be all one with dumbness, or no better than babbling. He is no enemy to good
discourse, but abhors discourse of good, without doing the good he discourses
of. He disliketh not, but hearkeneth to the words of the Preacher, setting in
order many Parables, and studying to find out acceptable words of truth Eccl.
12.9, 10
. Nor is he offended with the words of a faithful Advocate, who pleads for
the right of God, or man; but such as hinder duty to God or man. For he serves
and loves both God and man, not in word, or in tongue, but in deed and in truth
1 John 3.18


Thus, this hypocrite is as the soldier, that thinks it better to spend his
time at home, in talking and glorying of former victories, than to engage in a
new war 2 King. 14.10
; the true Christian is as Joab, that would not with patience hear out his
discourse, who saw Absalom hang by the hair of his head, yet slew him not;
but, brake off talking, ( I may not tarry thus with thee 2 Samuel 18.14
,) and dispatched the work. The hypocrites tongue is ashamed of his hand; but
the Christians hand adds reputation to his tongue: the one works with the
tongue, the other speaks by the hand.

This hypocrite is busy, but where he needs not.

(...) and (...), the Busie-body and the Idler are joined together by the
Apostle, as inseparable companions 1 Timothy 5.13
; where he prefers a diligent wife that has an husband to observe, children
to bring up a household to look after, before a widow that professes to think
no more of marriage, but pretends much zeal to devote her self to lodge
strangers, to wash the Saints feet, etc. (as some ancient women were then
employed by the Church; the better to provide for such as then traveled up and
down in the service of the Gospel, and of the Church:) for that those younger
widows will, after a while, wax wanton against Christ, and marry. And withal,
learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house: and not only (...),
idle, but tatlers also, and busy bodies. They are curiously busy in vain
things; no wonder then, if idle in things necessary. Idleness is the
School-mistresse of curiosity, and curiosity makes busy where no need is.

This hypocrite uses himself, as he uses his Watch. He looks more diligently
to keep it exactly, for the more punctual measuring of time, than he looks to
that business which should he done in that time. He keeps his Watch, to see
how the time passes, but keeps not touch with God to serve him in that time.
He is a better Clock-keeper, than a Christian. He might do much work in the
time he spends about his Watch. Or, he undertaketh so much of other unnecessary
things, as leaves him no time to do his own business: and so, while he has
here to do, and there to do, he lets go that he should hold 1 King 21.40
. He delights to tire himself in by business, and so has neither strength nor
heart for that which is needful.

There is not a greater argument of idleness, than to be a (...), one that
casts about to get work; and, to meddle with every business, as delighting
to have his oar in every man's boat. Hence, as among the Heathens, many curious
Arts and devices have been invented, as Astrology, Alchymy, Chyromancie,
Pyromancie, Necromancie, and such like costly and dangerous vanities,
infelicibus ustulanda lignis, fit for nothing but the fire: so even among
hypocrites in the Church, there is more time and cost spent about toys, than
duty. Either he sets himself hard to work to be able to find out and practice
some foolish feat, which a wise man would never care to do, nor to be able to
do. He is mightily taken with his own invention; as he that, with much toil
and trial was able to climb the pinnacle of an high Tower, and to set an egg on
end, on the top: or, as he that presented himself before Alexander, and vaunted
of his dexterity to cast a pease through a little hole, and received a
meet-guerdon for his busy idledesse, a bush^l of pease.

Sometimes he busieth himself in the study of the times, fashions, complements,
visits, etc. erecting, as it were, an University of idleness to busy all vain
persons in Court and City, like that Office set up at Rome, by Tiberius, styled
A voluptatibus. But no one thing does more unworthily usurp the name of
business, than that over-busie curiosity of some hypocrites of both sexes,
(but most what of the female) which enquireth after the affairs and faults of
others, Lamiae-like; but, putting up their eyes in a box, at home, that there
they may not see any thing amiss. In which busy intermedling, the eye, the
ear, and the tongue are all more busy than well employed.

First, the eye, that is very busy: for the eyes of a fool are in the ends of
the earth Prove. 17.24
; that is, very busy to peer and pry into every man's faults and actions. The
eye is both the hand and foot of curious intermedling. He had rather look in at
the window, than come in at the door; or, if he come in, he will choose rather
to come at such time wherein the house is all out of order, that he may see all
at the worst. He comes not in love; but, out of curiosity, or envy. He will not
therefore come (if he can prevent it) when things are at the best, lest he lose
the end of his coming, which is, to find fault. As toll-gatherers search for
concealed goods; so he, for privy infirmities of his neighbor, more than for
presumptuous sins in himself. He loves to be a Surveyor of other men's virtue,
like those who survey other men's lands, but possess none of their own.

Next, the ear is employed to listen, and pricketh it self up to hear any
thing of others, but what it should: for curious ears are compared to
cupping-glasses, that draw out corrupt humors, rather than any thing else: or,
to some gates in Cities, appointed for the passing out of malefactors. A
scandalous tale, or surmise, an intelligence or occasion of evil report is a
feast to such an ear. Darius entertained such under the name of Otacoustes.
Thus the Athenians busied themselves to hear and tell news Acts 17.21
.

The Tongue also is as busy as either eye or ear, to enquire after work for
this hypocrite. For the ear and the tongue do tradere operas mutuas, make work
for one another. The tongue makes enquiry, that the ear may have
intelligence: and the intelligence by the ear, gives the tongue matter of
report. But against this, even the wiser heathens have made sundry Laws. The
Locrians of Greece, (that inhabited Parnassus) set a fine upon his head, who
returning out of the Country should immediately ask, What news in the City;
as laying a bar upon all curiosity and busy intermedling of the tongue. The
Thurians, (Citizens of Thurium, another City of Greece,) suffered none to be
abused upon the stage, but adulterers and busybodies; because they would have
these sins thoroughly disgraced. For curiosity is a kind of incontinencie, and
adultery is a kind of curiosity; for, in both there is a sinful endeavor to
search and know what they should not.

It is an ill hound that follows every by-sent. And he is an ill member of a
State, a Town, a Family, that pretends to know all news that is stirring;
what such an one is worth; what he owes; whence comes such a stranger; of
what parentage, condition, etc. and what he comes for. He little considers
the answer of the Egyptian-servant to him that asked him, What is that thou
carriest covered? It is therefore covered that thou should not know. He
thinks he must know every thing, or he is no body; but this makes him to know
so little of what he ought to know concerning himself.

This hypocrite is like the Hen that loves to scrape in the dust, though she
has corn enough before her. He has work enough before him, and within him,
yet he leaves the enquiry into himself, and raketh the dunghill before other
men's doors, that he may better conjecture what is in the house. Such an one
does more good to his enemy, than to himself: for him, he makes more
circumspect. But, for himself, by clawing his own itching ear, he works
smart as well to himself, as to others. In stead of wisdom and knowledge, his
mind is filled and furnished with the shreds and rags of other men's tattered
reputations: and, many times, (either by enquiring after his own fortune, as
Saul 1 Samuel 28.19
, or by questioning about others, as Oedipus) he comes to understand his own
confusion.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian has no other business, but duty.

He is as busy in Gods way, as the hypocrite in his. But he studies to be
quiet, and to do his own business 1 These. 4.11
. Not that he will not do business for others, if desired, and that it may be
for their good: but all that he does for himself, or others, is confined within
the limits of his calling and duty. Necessity, or profit, tending to the good
of all, are the things be aims at. He finds time little enough for
necessaries, concerning life and godliness; and, for profit whereby he may
benefit himself and others, that he may not be altogether an unprofitable
servant: to these, his heart often gives him an Hoc age; or, do this with all
intention of mind.

His eyes are in his head, and look right on, and his eyelids look strait
before him Prove. 4.25
: he does not cast his eyes on every side to busy himself with every
by-businesse: or. if they go abroad, it is on Reasons errand, when there is
just cause so to do; to see for instruction, or to move compassion, not to feed
curiosity, or to kindle lust. And his errand being done, his eyes return, and
keep home, as chaste handmaids; and so they avoid Dinah's danger, who by
needless wandering abroad came home deflowred. He has learnt so much of a
heathen, that there is nothing more pernicious than a rolling wandering eye that
curiosity employeth. Cyrus being told that Panthea the wife of King Abradates,
(whom among the Assyrians, Cyrus had conquered) was worthy his beholding, for
that she was exceeding fair; nay, therefore, quoth he, she is the more
dangerous to be looked upon Xenoph Poed. l. 7.
.

He is not like the Lamia's, blind at home, and sharp-sighted abroad: he is
rather blindfold abroad, and turns his eyes inward. Of all objects, he likes
the true mirror best, because that shows him himself, and that without
flattery. If he look abroad, it is rather on the Sun, the Moon, the Stars,
and other works of God Psalm. 8.3
, than upon men's private behaviors. The Works of God are perfect Deuteronomy. 32.4
, and regular; whereas men's actions are irregular and exorbitant. He will look
where he may profit himself; not vex himself.

His ears are chaste (he being wedded to Christ:) He can hear no whisperings
against others, no more than he can hear flatteries of himself. He stops
his ears against the talebearer, and casts him out, and so causes those
contentions which are on foot, to cease Prove. 26.20
, and preventeth the beginning of more. If he hear any, it shall be God
himself, by whomsoever speaking to him. I will hear (says he) what God the
Lord will speak Psalm. 85.8
. Speak Lord, for thy servant hears 1 Samuel 3.10
. If he hear other men's matters, it is in Christ's service, and in the nature of
a Judge, Governor, or Pleader; not as a busie-body where he has nothing to
do.

He employeth his tongue, not to enquire after other men, or to speak his
pleasure of them, but to move questions of importance, that concern his own
well-doing and welfare: Such as that of the Jailer, What shall I do to be saved
Acts 16.30
? What have I done Jer. 8.6
, that I may repent? What must I do, that I may amend Acts 2.37
? What have I received, that I may render thanks Psalm. 116.12
? If his tongue may be of use, to plead the cause of the oppressed, to give
wholesome counsel and advice, and to speak a word in season, that may be like
apples of gold in pictures of silver; Prove. 25.11
he is then willing to speak, and to improve his tongue to the utmost: in such
cases he will not keep silence, until some body be the better for his speaking.

Thus, this hypocrite makes himself busy where he has no work, that he may
save himself the labor of working what belongs unto him; the true Christian
shunneth all by-businesse, that he may work and finish the work which God has
given him to do: the one labors in vain, and is punished as a loiterer; the
other works to purpose, and is rewarded for his labor.

This hypocrite is busy, but in things beside his Calling.

As the adulterer loves others (how homely soever) better than his own wife;
because he is better pleased with sin, than in keeping the Covenant of his God
Prove. 2.17
: so, this hypocrite loves to be busy in any calling, rather than in his own,
because he prefers the pleasing of himself before pleasing of God. If he
have gotten a few shreads or ends of learning, or but a few Sermon-notes of
other men's, he must presently be a Preacher, even before he understands what
he says, or whereof he affirms 1 Timothy 1.7
. If he be a Tradesman, he must needs preach by the Spirit, though he walk in
the flesh by so doing; or, he must turn Merchant, till his giddy brain bring
him to a morsel of bread: For, as he that passes by and medleth with strife,
belonging not to him, is like one that takes a dog by the ears Prove. 26.17
: either the dog will bite him, if he let him go, or he must stand still like a
fool, and hold the dog, and so neglect his own way, and business; so this
hypocrite medleth with what belongs not to his own calling, and, with what he
was never brought up unto, but is another calling differing from his, and
therefore will never make a saving match of it in the conclusion; but will be a
sinner both in the beginning and end of such putting his sickle into another
man's field, and smart for his folly by cutting his own fingers.

As a bird that wandreth from her nest, so is a man that wandreth from his
place Prove. 27.8
: such is this hypocrite, meddling out of his calling. God furnishes every man
with abilities suitable to his own calling, because, therein he works for God;
but not with sufficiencies for another calling, because therein he works for
himself, or rather indeed against himself: for, he that steps, out of his
calling, sins against God, and so makes an ill match for himself: he is as a
soldier, that being by his General appointed to one place, he leaves that,
and betakes him to another. He is a bird forsaking her nest; while she is in
her nest, she is safe: but she no sooner wandreth from it, but she is liable to
be caught in nets, to be shot, or made a prey to other ravenous fowls. Vzzah
may ptetend zeal, in putting forth his hand to hold up the Ark, when the Oxen
that drew it, stumbled and shook it 2 Samuel 6.6, 7
. But God, once for all, gave such a testimony of his indignation, by smiting
Vzzah dead in the place, as may teach all wise men to the end of the world, to
beware how they step out of, or go from their callings.

Not that it is simply unlawful in any case, to lay aside that condition of
life, to which he was brought up: for, if God call him in some extraordinary
case, place, or time, to do him some other and greater service, (as Moses,
David, Elisha, Amos): or, to serve the Commonwealth in a case of extremity,
(as the poor wise man, that by his wisdom saved the City Eccl. 9.15
.) Or, if a man be likely to perish by famine, unwholesomenesse of air, or,
blood-thirstinesse of conspiring enemies, as Elijah, and others; there is no
question, but Paul may make Tents Acts 18.3
, though brought up at the feet of Gamaliel Acts 22.3 26.4, 5
. Jacob may go down into Egypt Acts 7.15
. And such as being persecuted in one City, may fly into another Mat. 10.23
, and there exercise some other calling, if they cannot follow their own. But
of all such cases, God must be Judge, not the Party himself. Such as walk most
close with God, and have the mind of God and Christ, imparted to them, must be
consulted, and their judgment had in the case, before a man undertake to
forsake his place, or calling. It must not be of, or from a man's own
unsetlednesse, and seeking, but he must see a plain Providence leading, and
even driving him into such a change.

Elisha stirred not from his Plough, till Elijah cast his mantle upon him 1
King. 19.19, 20
. Amos left not the herd, nor the gathering of Sycamore fruit, (or wild figs)
until the Lord took him as he followed the flock, and said unto him, Go,
prophecy unto my people Israel Am. 7.14.15
. Not Stephen himself, as able for gifts, and as full of faith and of the Holy
Ghost, as he was, would adventure upon the work of a Deacon, (which then
chiefly consisted in taking care of the poor, by which the Apostles would not
be hindered from preaching; holding it unreasonable to leave the Word of God, to
serve Tables Acts 6.2
) until the Brethren had chosen him, and set him before the Apostles, for them
to lay hands upon him Ver. 5.6
. And, when the Apostle Paul so expressly ordains in all Churches, that, as
God has distributed to every man, and as the Lord has called every one, so
let him walk 1 Cor. 7.17
. That is, when God has fitted him for a calling, and put him in it, Let every
man abide in the same calling wherein he was called Ver. 20
, that is, wherein God set him; and again, Let every man wherein he is called,
therein abide with God Ver. 24
: Let every man know, (although the hypocrite will not, till it be too late)
that he must look very well to his warrant for shifting or leaving off his own
calling, lest he leave his calling and his God, (with whom he ought to abide)
both together.

When Agar fled from her Mistress, God met her, and said unto her, Agar,
Sarah's maid, Whence come thou? And whither will thou go Genesis 16.8
? The name of relation was a check; for if she were Sarah's maid, she was out
of her place, she must be in Sarah's house, and about her business. Admit, her
Mistress used her hardly, (for her perking above her Mistress, and sleighting
of her) yet this was no warrant for the servant to run away 1 Pet. 2.19, 20, 21
. If the spirit of the Ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place, is Gods
rule, for yielding pacifieth wrath Eccl. 10.4
; Therefore, the charge is, return to thy Mistress, and submit thy self under
her hands Genesis 16.9
. It were well, if not only this hypocrite, but all that wander from their
place and calling, would give ear to this voice of God, which concerns them,
as much as it did Agar.

As Philip said to his son Alexander (excelling in singing) Art thou not
ashamed, being a Prince, to sing so well? So it may justly be said to this
hypocrite, Art thou not ashamed to be so well vers't in that calling which
belongs not to thee, and which cannot but make thee neglect thine own; to be a
Bishop in another man's Diocese 1 Pet. 4.15. (...).
? to be a Keeper of the Vinyards belonging to others, and thine own Vine have
thou not kept? He may be more expert perhaps, than some, than most others,
Cant. 1.6.
in his own profession and calling: yet this is no warrant to leap into
another, or to busy himself in another. How might he excel; how abundantly
useful more than he is, might he be, if he would lay out but that time to add
to his excellency in his own calling, which he extravigantly wastes upon
another!

He spends a great deal of time and travel in things that are merely (...),
beside the purpose. Either through pride he deals in matters above him, (as,
being a subject, he will be meddling in the affairs of his Prince;) O that I
were made Judge in the land, says Absalom, that every man which has any suit
of cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice 2 Samuel 15.4.
. Or, he intrudeth on the work of the Ministry, coming in by the window also,
and not by the door: or, he descends beneath his due pitch, as Dionysius, that
would needs be the best Poet; Caligula, the best Orator; and Nero, the best
Fiddler; and so became the three worst Princes that ever reigned. For such a
(...), a by-businesse of their own calling; and, other men's business, their
work.

He that works with an evil mind in his own calling, had rather play, if he
might have his will: and, is ready to say to another man that is idle, You are
happy, you need not labor: or, that is employed in another calling, you have
the odds of us all, Had I such work, I should be as diligent as any man. But
our hypocrites case is yet the more dangerous, because he neglects not only
his particular calling as a member of a Civil society, but his general calling
as a Christian, omitting and neglecting that Vnum necessarium, that one needful
thing, the getting of heaven, as if that were but a (...), a work on the by to
be done at leisure times, when he has nothing else to do, or can do no more.
When all Satan's work is done, and sin has its turn served, then he will think
of repentance, and of forsaking ungodliness and worldly lusts Tit. 2.12.
. Gods work, nay rather his own (...), or maine work shall lie to the last.

When he is not sent, he will run for God. I have not sent these Prophets,
says God, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied Jer.
32.21.
. Had God sent them in his errand, they would then have been as vinegar to his
teeth, and smoke to his eyes Prove. 10.26.
, that do but anger and vex him, for they would have gone but the sluggards
pace, and have wrought after his rate. Any thing, but what he should, you may
have of him; provided you expect nothing of what he should perform. Let him do
your work, and he will toil till he sweat: put him upon his own, and he puts
his hand into his bosom. Any calling, any work, is better than his own,
therefore he employeth himself least in his own calling, and bestows most
pains and time where he has nothing to do.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian keeps close to the works of his own calling.

It is true, that, as a Christian, he seeks spirituals before temporals, and
will do Gods work before his own, and chooses the better part that shall not
be taken from him Luke 10.42.
. Here the things of the Kingdom of God, and of this world, cannot both be had,
he prefers the world to come, before this present world; and the Word of
God, before his appointed food Job. 23.12.
, and will be ashamed to be more verst, and better skilled in the affairs of
the world, than in the things of Christ's Kingdom. He leaves it to others to be
more expert in the world, who have no other care, nor comfort. But in business
of his particular calling (the former being always preferred, as abovesaid) he
not only abides with God, as not starting from him, or it: but labors for
God, that so he may please him that has called him.

Amongst the many differences of outward things, he discerns of those that
agree with his own place and calling: and sets upon that chiefly which most
concerns him to look after, as being chiefly required of God in his place,
upon conscience of Gods Command, and for the good of humane society. He works
diligently in his own place; not because he cannot play, or has not wit enough
to be idle; but because he dares not so to spend his time and strength; and,
as good be idle as to work where God has not set him; or, in that work which
God has not cut out for him. He knows that recreation, though never so
lawful, becomes an idleness, when it is better loved than business, and when
it is used as necessary to pass away time, as if he were in great distress to
have some part of his life cut off: or when recreation is turned into an
occupation, or used so, as one may say, If this be your recreation, what is
your occupation? Plato reproved a young man for playing at Dice, to which the
party answering, For how small a matter do you reprove me! the Philosopher
replied; but the custom is no small thing Diog. Laert.
. And as he knows something to be done better than recreation, (to fit him
better, for which, he uses recreation, but no further; so he employeth his
mind and body so recreated and refreshed in doing of his own work, or rather
Gods, in his own calling, and to bring forth his own fruit unto God in his
season Psalm. 1
.

It Is enough for Esau to tire himself in recreations, till he be almost dead,
and ready to sell his birthright for a refection Genesis 25.32
. The Christian knows better how to spend his time; not, by hunting abroad,
but by working in his place: and that the wisdom of a good man is much emproved
by using well his spare hours. He looks upon the world as a sea wherein the
Leviathan plays Psalm. 104 26
, the Emblem of Idlers; and the Merchants ship saileth Prove. 31.14
, the Emblem of diligence. He likes of the Merchants trade better than that of
Leviathan, and prefers diligence in his own calling before all the sport in the
world. His meat and drink, and life too, is to do the Will of God John 4.34
.

He differs from the hypocrite, as men differ from children; these go to
school, in hope of play; and those play that they may fit themselves for
labor. He labors diligently, not as the covetous, to get wealth, but as a
servant to Providence, and to the honor of Religion. If God give wealth, he
refuses not, but puts it to account, writing himself a debtor to God for
it, and as trusted with the well-employing of it. As for men, he cannot find
in his heart to take all, and repay nothing. I have their hand, says he, they
must have my head: they labor for me, it is my part to study and care for them
how to do them good Ps. 122.8, 9
.

And what he does, even in earthly things, savours of an heavenly conversation
Phil 3.20
. He does outward businesses, but with an heavenly and spiritual frame of
heart. His heart is not taken up, nor taken away with the world, when he is
most busy in the things of the world. He sets his affections on things
above, and not on things on the earth Col. 3.2
. He is an Adam that has an earthly constitution, according to the
signification of his name; and, an earthly occupation, (wherein he honors
God) according to his constitution; but not an earthly heart: for therein he
bears the Image of the Second Adam, which is from heaven heavenly, as he
shall hereafter, in his body 1 Cor. 15.49
, when he comes to reap the full harvest of all his labors.

In his outward labors, he is the more diligent, aiming at the gaining of time
and liberty, for vacancy to holy duties. He works willingly, because he
works for God; but all is, that he may enjoy God. Therefore he so works,
that he may spend as much time as possibly he can, in converse with God, after
his work is over. Jacob served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep Hos.
12.12
; but, it was because he loved her Genesis 29.20
. So the Christian serves God in his place, be it in keeping sheep, or what it
will, that God sets him about. And all the time he so serves God, for God,
seems to him but a few days, for the love he has unto him. In the weekdayes
work he prepares for the Sabbaths rest; and daily so labors, that he may
gain time to solace himself with the Lord in prayer, reading, or meditation.

Thus, this hypocrite is a self-willed Israelite, that will work for God; but,
that which he sets him not about, at least at that time, but expressly
forbids him to meddle with. When God says to Israel, Go not up, neither
fight, for I am not among you, they will then presumptuously go Deuteronomy. 2.42.43
. The true Christian does all with submission to the Will of God, as a faithful
servant to his Master, or Lord, doing his Masters work, not other men's, or his
own; but, as the servant of Christ, doing the Will of God from the heart Ephesians.
6.6
. The Christian does worldly things, as the hypocrite does spiritual; not by
the eye, but by the by: the one sitting at Church, thinks of his dinner, the
market, or his pastime: the other sitting at dinner, has his heart at Church
by meditating on the Sermon.

CHAP. XXXIII. The Zealous Hypocrite Is he that has a zeal for God, but not
according to God. Defin.

IT is a zeal of his own making or imagining. No virtue is more mistaken than
this of zeal; no wonder then, if this hypocrites zeal he much misshapen.
Whatsoever has in it any thing of the nature of fire, is quick and active, and
requires a more nimble eye to discern it, and more acute judgment to judge of
it; which, this hypocrite wanting, must needs be grossly mistaken in it. He
thinks, if his fire be kindled upon Gods Altar, strange fire and celestial
fire, will make no great difference, because he has not either the skill, or
the leisure to distinguish between them. But he that shall more thoroughly
penetrate into the several natures of them, will find as wide a difference
between them, as the fire of the Sanctuary, and the fire of hell. No grace is
more useful to promote Gods work, if it be right; no counterfeit of grace, more
dangerous to abuse Gods people, if what is false, be permitted to act.

It is granted by all, that zeal has its name from an hissing heat (...)
ferveo, bullio.
, which fire, or something that has fire in it, (as burning hot mettle) cast
into water, makes. So that zeal, in the strict acceptance of the word, is a
fiery hissing heat, fi^hting with some contrary: which being applied to that
zeal, which is exercised in, upon, or against something that is spiritual, must
needs be very dangerous, if it proceed from strange fire. If the unnatural and
furious heat which a fiery temper or disposition blows up, do pass for zeal,
what great, what dangerous fires a little spark kindles! If it be true fire,
yet out of the hearth, what desperate combustions are produced by it! Where
indiscreet zeal sparkleth too far, it endangereth the whole Fabric of
Religion, and religious society. Great cause then to discover and detect this
hypocrite, who is an Incendiary in the Churches of Christ. He sets the Church
in a flame by fire borrowed from hell, and thinks he does God good service John
16.2
, as if his false fire were kindled by a true coal from the Altar; every man
fashioning a zeal to his own humor and liking, like those seducers of the
Galatians; of whom Paul, thus, They zealously affect you, but not well Gal 4.17
.

On the contrary, the true Christian has his zeal from, Differ.
and according to God.

He knows that it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing
Ver. 18
. Therefore he first endeavors to have his lips touched by one of the
Seraphims, with a live coal from the Altar Isa. 6.6
, which may both cleanse him, and heat him; and then to put forth his zeal for
God, according unto God. The Spirit of Christ works zeal in him, and sets it
on work. The Word of God is his guide directing him in working; not only in
regard of the ground, object, and end; but, for time, manner and measure. And
so he becomes not only a faithful Soldier, and valiant Champion of Christ,
that affects the cause with zeal as hot as fire, and obeys the command of
his General, keeping himself to his station, and to his duty in it. For, well
he considers, that order in martial affairs, is of as great moment as
strength. Without this a Soldier may let in the enemy, and do more hurt than
an enemy. And zeal out of course and order, lets in superstition, or
will worship, to the prejudice of the cause defended.

He emulateth others to over-take and out-go them in goodness, without envying
them 2 Cor. 9.2.
. He is jealous over them with a godly jealousy, for fear they should sin
against Christ their Husband, by following others 2 Cor. 11.2.
. There is in him a most fervent heat of all the affections toward God and the
Lord Jesus; burning in his love to him, in longing after him, in joy in him,
and indignation against all those that oppose him. His zeal is not confined to
love and anger, nor compounded of them; but is a gracious quality firing all
the affections and passions in the behalf of God. It Is not the result of any
one or more affections, but a gallant temper in them; yet differing from them,
as the due seasoning of a knife or axe that makes it to cut excellently, or as
courage in a valiant man which is not a compounded thing of his passions and
spirits, but a brave temper of both. It is in him a distinct grace of the
Spirit, which makes him fervent in Spirit, in serving the Lord Romans 12.11.
. Not a result of this or that grace or of many together, as spirits in the
blood.

This his zeal makes him also jealous after a godly sort over those that he
loves, lest they, being brought into Christ, should be defiled by seducers, or
do any thing unworthy of their relation to Christ; he is solicitous and
provident, lest some evil should disturb the peace, or violate the purity of
any that he loves upon that account. His love is the prime affection that
provokes his zeal, and makes him jealous; yet zeal also is that fire that
kindles his love, and all his affections to make them fervently active for God;
it is as the fire from heaven that kindled and burned Elijahs sacrifice, and
made it acceptable.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is an ignis fatuus, a fools fire, that instead of
guiding him aright, leads him more out of the way: the true Christians zeal
gives not only heat, but light as the star in the East, leading the wise
men to Christ Mat. 2.9.
: the one, by his zeal, consumes others (as the zeal of Jehu did, the house
of Ahab) without comfort to himself; the other, consumes himself (as the zeal
of Christ did John 2.17.
for the honor of God, and discharge of his own duty.

This hypocrites zeal is blind.

The light of the body is the eye Mat. 6 22.
; the light of the soul is the understanding Ephesians. 14.8.
: without the former, the body cannot go, but it stumbleth; without the other,
the soul cannot act, but it erreth; or is in danger so to do. But the best eye,
cannot see, except it have light from without: no more can the understanding
(which in it self is darkened Ephesians. 4.18,
, till it receive the eye salve of Christ's Spirit whereby it may see R^vel. 3
18.
, until it have received the light of wisdom from the Word to understand his
way Prove. 4.18.
. This hypocrite wants both sight, and light. The light within him is
darkness. His very understanding is darkened, being alienated from the life of
God, through the ignorance that is in him. And, if the light within him be
darkness, how great is that darkness Mat. 6.23.
! If he have not light within, how can he see? if he have not light without,
how can he go? He is a blind guide Mat. 23 16.
that cannot see: and, the blind lead the blind, when ignorant zeal leads the
hypocrite that of himself has no eyes; and so, both fall into the ditch Mat.
15.14.
.

What once Zebah and Zalmunna said of Gideon, as the man is, so is his strength
Judge 8.21
, so we may say of this hypocrite, as the man is, so is his zeal. The man
thinks he has a very good eye, and takes it in great scorn to be deemed
blind: are we blind also Joh. 9.40.
? but Christ, that knows all things, knows and pronounces him to be blind,
although the hypocrite himself knows it not Rev. 3.17.
. Therefore his zeal must needs be blind too; for, although he has never so
much light without to inform him, yet he wants an eye within, to make use of
that light that shines round about him. He is as blind at Noonday when he
has best means of information, as at Midnight, when he has nothing to
direct him.

And while his zeal is no better, it is not a pin to choose, either the
superstitious zeal of the idolatrous Athenians, erecting an Altar, and
offering sacrifices to the unknown God Act. 17.23.
; or the pharasaical zeal of the Jew, toward that God Act. 22.3.
which he thinks he knows. He is zealous (as he thinks) for the true God;
yet without God, and against him, because he advises not with him, or takes
not advice from him. He is zealous for the Law; yet, through ignorance and
obstinacy, overthrows the end of the Law, which was the righteousness of
Christ to a believer Romans 10.4.
. This, the self-conceited Justitiary (and who more, than the hypocrite?) not
understanding, all his zeal of God is not worth a rush, but a wrong to God,
and to himself too; and all because his zeal is not according to knowledge:
for, being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish his
own, he submits not to the righteousness of God ver. 2.3.
, and thereby loses all benefit of it.

He is like an untrained Soldier, that through ignorance sometimes
overthrows the whole Army. He is many times a fighter against God Acts 5.39.
, even while he pretends to stand and fight for him. Thus Saul (till he
became a Paul) in his zeal, persecuted the Church Phil. 3.6.
: and this, out of ignorance, whiles he was yet in unbelief 1 Timothy 1.13.
. He did it, and he thought he ought to do it, contrary to the Name of Jesus
Christ Acts 26.9
; and all, through his zeal for the vain traditions of his fathers Gal. 1.14.
. And so, his zeal without knowledge, makes him not only to err, but to
run mad with error and zeal together Acts 26.11.
; thinking he then does God service, when he most furiously persecuteth his
servants John 16.2.
. He regards not information from those especially whom he persecuteth, but
esteems all they say to be but devices to save their own skin whole: and
therefore how much soever he may afterward plead ignorance, yet shall he be
judged willing to the mischief, because willingly ignorant 2 Pet. 3.5.
, and wilfully refusing better information. So that, whether he stumble upon
truth, or tumble into error, or halt between both, it is hard to say, which is
worst to him.

And, in this zeal, he goes on with more confidence, and less opposition,
because herein he has wind and tide with him. The Devil will never oppose
him; for, he does his work. And such zeal is seldom displeasing, nor much
blamed by men that hold no communion with God, but is rather admired by those
that imitate it not: for, it never flies at profaneness, so much, as at truth,
or the power of godliness. For this reason, amongst Mahumetans, Papists, and
generally all Heretics, the most zealous, are best accepted and prized, even
by the looser sort. But, amongst those that are truly zealous for truth and
holiness, it is far otherwise. Nothing is more distastful to ungodly men
than true zeal, although managed with greatest discretion. Ignorant zeal
hinders not Satan's Kingdom, but promotes it; and, if it curb or restrain
corruption one way, it gives it so much the more range another. But true zeal
checketh it every way, both in our selves, and others; and sets a pitch, to a
man's self in practice; to others, in example. True zeal is too busy, not
only against evil, but for good, forcing men to drive beyond their pace. Lot,
that was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked 2 Pet. 2.7.
; was most abhorred by the Sodomites when he labored with most zeal against
their intended wickedness. Stand back, say they; this one fellow came in to
sojourne, and he will needs be a Judge Genesis 19.9.
. To tell a wicked man he must not go on in wickedness, is to tell a glutton
he must not eat. To tell a profane man, he must be zealous in doing good, is to
tell a dead man, he must rise up and walk.

Contrarily, the zeal of the true Christian is according to knowledge. Differ.


His zeal not only receives light from the Word, but it is guided by
knowledge which the Word gives him. It is an ocular zeal which sees the way,
and a wise zeal that walks in the way which it sees. He looks not only
upon Gods holy nature, which is the pattern, but upon his revealed will, which
is unto man the rule of holy zeal Deuteronomy. 29.^9.
. The first thing in building is skill to lay the groundwork and foundation.
The first thing in fighting a Battle, is to know the cause, and Captain. The
Christian zealot fights not for love of fighting, like cocks, that fall to it,
so soon as they see one another; but he wisely weighs the cause, the manner,
and end of his encounter, and the grounds and warrant he has to appear in the
quarrel. He will not make that which is good Gal. 4 18
, to become evil, by his evil managing: but will carefully prevent the
committing of evil in the doing of good R^m. 3.8.
.

He knows that there is no affection more liable to exception of God, or man,
than this fervency of Spirit, which is called zeal; because none more apt to
miscarry. He looks upon zeal without knowledge, as a fire in, a Chimney,
without a window to the room: and, upon knowledge added to zeal, as a window
that lets in light to make use of the fire. He sees that the hypocrite has
nothing but fire-light, which more hurts the eyes than helps his sight: But
the well-informed zealot, as he warmeth himself by the fire of zeal, so he
works by the day light of knowledge, which directs his zeal. His wisdom,
is to understand his way Prove. 14 8.
: and till he understand it, he will not adventure upon it. Who would employ a
blind Commander to draw up an Army into Battle array, and to direct the fight?
Who would trust himself upon a blind horse, being himself blind also? He will
therefore have his eyes in his head, and good light before him to direct his
zeal, before he let it slip, or exercise it even in the best cause of God
himself.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is like the horse or mule, which have no
understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come
near unto thee, and do mischief Psalm. 32 9.
: the zeal of the true Christian, has the privilege of Israel departing out
of Egypt Exodus 13.21
: the Lord going before it by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead it the way;
and by night, in a pillar of fire to give light, to go by day and night: the
zeal of the one, is fire without light, an emblem of utter darkness; the
zeal of the other, has not only he^t, but light, as a beam from the Sun of
righteousness Mal 4.2.
.

This hypocrite has zeal, but without judgment.

Knowledge, and judgment are distinguished by the Apostle Phil. 1.9.
; and are too often found asunder in men, but in none more than in this
hypocrite, who having gotten some smattering knowledge which puffs him up 1
C^r. 8.1.
, never looks after judgment to discern of things that differ Phil. 1.10.
, and to make a fit choice of that which is the better, and most deserving his
zealous prosecution. Many times that which is good, is not fit or expedient for
zeal to pursue: nor can all things that are fit as well, as good, be pursued
at once, but one must give place to another, as sacrifice to mercy Hosea 6 6.
. Here, the hypocrite, for want of judgment preferres the lesser before the
greater, and in their rash zeal quarrel the Disciples of Christ for preferring
mercy before sacrifice Mat. 12.4. and ver 7.
. Here the hypocrite will rather starve the hungry, than permit him to rub a
few ears of corn to prevent starving, under pretense of zeal for the
Sabbath, that it might not be profaned.

If he be zealous in duties, it is commonly without judgment too, he is very
hot about lesser matters, but lukewarm, yea key-cold in things of more
importance. See a knot of them together, tithing, and paying tithes of mint,
and annice, and cummin very punctually; they will not keep back a sprig or
leaf, or one seed: but, the weightier matters of the Law, judgment, mercy,
faith, and the love of God, are wholly omitted Mat. 23.13. Luke 11.42.
. He would feign do something; nay, in his way of zeal, he will do much to
make his peace with God, but he wants judgment to take the right course. He
thinks, if he come before the Lord, and bow himself before the high God, with
burnt-offerings and calves of a year old, and give him thousands of rams,
and ten thousand rivers of oil; and, if need be, his firstborn, the fruit of
his body, for the sin of his soul Mic. 6 6.7.
, this is abundant testimony of his zeal: but, while he neglects to do justly,
to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God ver. 8.
, all this is but a false foolish zeal, without judgment.

Sometimes he is very curious and strict about trifles, while he trifleth in
matters of importance, and his zeal about circumstances is often times
accompanied with key-coldnesse about the substance of true holiness. He
spends more heat about gestures and vestures, than about mortification and
destruction of the flesh. This, the spirit of error knows well how to make
advantage of; and therefore Satan has his instruments ready to clap such a
zealot on the back, and to applaud his zeal to the heavens: because nothing
does so soon forfeit zeal into the hands of Satan, nor do him better service,
among such as profess Religion, and hold fast the truth of doctrine, than such
zeal so void of judgment, which knows not a difference between sputtering out
in the kennel, and flaming in the Chimney.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the true Christians zeal is guided by a sound judgment.

As he coveteth earnestly and zealously the best gifts 1 Cor. 12.31
; so he especally labors after a sound judgment, and sound mind 2 Timothy 1.7.
; That he may both approve the things that are excellent, and lay out his zeal
upon them. His judgment is to him, what Tasters, are to Princes; his judgment
shall first pass upon it, before his zeal let out it self for, or against it.
And if, in a true estimate, he find any thing amiss that may by consequence
prove more prejudicial to the Gospel, than some other grosser evils, which few
that profess the Gospel will, after discovery, defile themselves withal, he
will spend more zeal upon that than upon these.

Admirable was the wisdom and judgment that guided the zeal of Paul, in
reproving Peter to his face, because he was to be blamed Gal. 2.11.
. He discerned, that though it were a good mind not to offend the tender
consciences of Believing Jews in a point of legal diet, from which they were
not thoroughly weaned; yet it was far more dangerous to beget a scruple in the
consciences of converted Gentiles against the liberty of the Gospel, wherein
both they and the Jews were to be confirmed, and wherein Peter himself was
first instructed in a Vision Act. 10.12, 13, etc.
. Peter's fault was, that when none but Gentiles were present, he did all things
which they did, making no distinction of meats: but when some Jews came from
Jerusalem being sent to Antioch, by James the Apostle, who then resided in
Jerusalem, Peter began now to be, or to seem to be ashamed, or afraid of what
he had done: and therefore withdrew himself from the tables of the belieeving
Gentiles, not daring to use the former liberty any longer, fearing them which
were of the circumcision ver. 12.
, that they would take very ill such liberty as he had used. His example made
all other believing Jews then in Antioch, and even Barnabas himself, who all
had before used the same liberty, to withdraw, and dissemble also ver. 13.
; as if they had used no such liberty, nor were for it in their judgments.
This could not but be a very great stumbling block to the converted Gentiles,
and give them occasion to think, that there was no such Christian liberty as
Paul had every where preached, touching meats, seeing so great an Apostle as
Peter, and so many holy believers of the Jews, by his example, durst not use
or own it, when once any of the believing Jews dwelling at Jerusalem, then
accounted the Mother Church, and the purest in all the world, did but appear
and take notice of it: so, his withdrawing and separating from the Gentiles,
was (so far as so great an exemple could prevail) a oompelling, of the
Gentiles, to live as do the Jews ver. 14.
, by being tied to the same laws of meats which the Jews formerly were, and
weak believers, yet believed that they were tied still; and so he destroyed
that liberty which he was to preach, as a part of Christ's purchase.

Indeed, had Baronius been at Paul's elbow, he would have been a stout Champion
for Peter, or rather a blasphemous disputer against God; and have taught Paul
more moderation, and better manners toward the Prince of Apostles (as the
Papists ignorantly or maliciously term) Peter. For that presumptuous Cardinal,
in his Annals, defends Peter, and maintains against Paul, that Peter was
therein in no fault at all. And therefore, after he had mentioned this passage
of Paul's acts at Antioch, he boldly bespeaks his Reader thus, Ad annum Christi
51. nu. 32.
siste gradum, lector. Here, stay thy passage, (and see a combat between a
Cardinal, and an Apostle.) For, he after spends many lines, and is so zealous
in the cause, that after all, he pronounces sentence thus; dicimus, ea
faciendo Petrum vel minimum non deliquisse. We say, says he, that, take it in
what sense ye will, Peter, in doing those things, did not in the least offend.

But, enough, and too much of such Blasphemy, fit only for one of the
Champions of Antichrist. Our business is now with the sincere Christian, to
whom as nature has given, beside outward senses to apprehend, a common sense
to judge of all objects proper unto it; so grace gives not only spiritual
sense to perceive that which is good, but also spiritual judgment to discern
what is more convenient or excellent. God is wisdom as well as goodness,
therefore the Christian serves him not only affectionately, but wisely, and
with judgment.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is like the fire which Absoloms servants, kindled
in the fields of Joab; not caring much where it began, so it burnt up the corn
2 Samuel 14 30
; the true Christians zeal is like the choice of Mary, resolving that, when
Christ himself meant to dine at her sisters house, and she could gladly give
him the best entertainment; yet, better an homely dinner, than his Sermon lost;
therefore (while Martha was cumbred about much serving,) she chooses rather to
sit at his feet, and to hear his Word, which is the needful thing, and the
good part which shall not be taken from her Luke 10.39, 42.
: the one exercises his affection, and contenteth himself to be fervent; the
other, being considerate and circumspect, is zealous with reason.

This hypocrites zeal is all in extremes.

earthly Ephesians. 4.26.
sensual, and divelish James 3.15.
; and then, to the place he lives in, with contention. Zeal, if not heeded and
confined within due bounds, easily degenerateth into carnal anger, as natural
heat into that which is symptomatical and feavourish; and, instead of making
others better, makes the zealot worse.

His zeal is as that of Simeon and Levi against the Shechemites, killing and
slaying a whole City for one man's offense, and afterward, coming upon the
slain and spoiling the City, because they had defiled their sister Genesis 34.27.
; or, like to that of Joab, in killing Abner, under color of zeal, for David
2 Samuel 3.24, 25.
, even after Abner had submitted to, and made a league with David to bring
about all Israel to him ver. 21.
. This indiscreet zeal might have cost David dear; for now, Isbosheth being
rid of Abner, that first set him up to be King in room of Saul his father; and
after, fell off from him, (merely for justly reproving him for keeping Rispah
his fathers Concubine;) he might have created much trouble to David. And indeed
indiscreet zeal if permitted, in such as in the maine are truly godly, does
much mischief. What contentions and quarrels did the sidings and divisions of
sundry Christians in Corinth breed to that Church, for which the Apostle
censured them, as carnal, and walking as men 1 Cor 3.3.
, that is, as carnal men, not at all savouring of Christ or his Spirit. What
bickerings were raised in the Roman Galatine, and sundry other Churches, about
observations of days and meats! Thus the zeal of those sons of thunder did
begin to degenerate, when they would have called for fire from heaven upon the
unhospital Samaritans, for not entertaining our Savior; had not he cooled them
with his wholesome reproof, ye know not of what spirit ye are Luke 9.55.
. And no better was that fire of Peter, which without all consideration or
discretion, brake forth into bloodshed against the Kingdom and peace of both
Caesar, and Christ Mat. 26.51, 52.
. How much more then does this excess work upon them that are graceless?
Hence, the Apostle joyneth zeal, and contention 1 Cor. 3.3. (...).
together. And, amongst the chief attendants of carnal and devilish wisdom,
this bitter zeal is reckoned for one Jam. 3.15.
. For, as a fiery horse unbridled, so zeal turned loose, hazardeth both him
that manageth it, and those that have to do with him.

Another while the hypocrite is all for moderation, below discretion; as
before, for flying out beyond discretion. Before, he was an horse without
reins, now the reins over-lay the horse; all reins, no horse. Not that true
moderation can exceed; but, that he mixeth too much of that dull ingredient
which he falsely calls discretion, with that which he as falsely calls
moderation: and for this he is more zealous, than for true zeal it self.

As there is a knowledge and profundity falsely so called, which are of Satan
Revel. 2.24.
, not of God; so there is a zeal, and a moderation, as they speak, which is
neither the one, nor the other. As a man may be too just, too wise Eccles. 7.16.
; so, too zealous, too moderate. But as natural heat cannot be too much, yet,
very little which is unnatural, is too much: so is it here. True zeal rightly
ordered can never flame too high; nor true moderation duly bounding zeal, can
ever be too strict. Moderation is but the result of discretion and judgment, in
ordering, not quenching of zeal. But, of zeal without discretion, or of
discretion without zeal, in the matters of God, the least is too much.

Such a zealot was Saul, where God bids him be all fire, and to spare none,
there he uses moderation, and spares the best of the sheep and oxen, under
pretense of zeal for Gods sacrifice 1 Samuel 15.15
. Where he had no warrant to be so furious, there he falls foul beyond all
moderation and measure, as in slaying the Gibeonites, in his zeal to the
children of Israel and Judah 2 Samuel 21.2.
. The like zeal was that of Jehu, who albeit he had commission to destroy
Ahabs house; yet he had nothing to do to kill those two and forty brethren of
Ahaziah the King of Judah 2 Kin. 10.13, 14.
. And on the otherside, when he destroyed Baal, as a manifestation of his zeal
for the Lord Ver. 16.
, yet he was not so zealous against Jeroboams calves Ver. 29.
, as abominable as Baal. Here he used moderation too much, and zeal too little.

There is little to choose between a boiling pot unscummed, and the pot that,
for want of heat, has no scumme raised: that wants a scummer, this, a fire:
that wallops as the Sea about Leviathan; and this, paves it with stone: that
indangers, as Aetna; this, as a Mountain of ice. Intemperate people, to heat
the stomach, inflame the liver; and foolish Physicians, to cool the liver,
kill the stomach. Such an one is this hypocrite, who to kindle affection, sets
passion on fire; and then to moderate the flame, casts so much water of false
moderation upon it, as does quite extinguish it. To allay that which is
unnatural, he extinguisheth the kindly spark of Christian zeal, both in
himself and others. Oh! says he, you must above all things, take heed you be
not too forward, too zealous: too good is stark naught: and too much of one
thing is good for nothing. The excess is here worse borne than the defect: for
that is a trouble to men; but this, is only a wrong to God, whose cause few
take to heart; nor can well endure that others should.

As the Mancihees denied justice in the God of the Old Testament (as they call
him) because he is called Deus Zelaus, a Zealous God, which they think cannot
stand with justice because it has in it; too much passion; so this hypocrite
sometimes condemns that for rash zeal, that has more of fire in it, than he
has in his Chimney. And he thinks he should do wrong to discover more heat
for God. He will be of a pleasing temper, flesh and no flesh, fish and no fish,
neither one or the other further than to please men, but especially himself:
neither a sound Protestant, nor a strict Papist. If he think fit to be good
himself, yet he will not be too busy in finding fault with others that are
wicked. And this temper he likes best in others, as a lascivious husband that
extolls the patience and wisdom of his wife, that can see and say nothing.

This man's zeal is a zeal against zeal; I cannot, says he, abide this
preciseness, this over-doing, (for so he accounts of all that exceed his
lukewarm temper;) 'twas never good world, since so much strictness was in
fashion, etc. and so he is more zealous against zeal in others, than against
his own luke-warmenesse. And indeed this distemper is grown epidemical; men can
hardly abide any other in others: which is a great advantage to Antichrist to
grow upon the Church, when men want love to the truth 2 These. 2.10.
, and are not valiant for it Jer. 9.3.
. No times so much favor him and promote his cause, as those wherein not only
piety, justice, and honesty, but even zeal it self is in reproach. Then, many
who formerly never minded or cared for any Religion, in any serious way 1 John
2.19.
, turn Papists, as Pirates turn Turks; to whose wickedness nothing could be
added, but this sin of Apostasy: and so they are better lost than found.

This hypocrite takes himself to be wiser than all the zealots in the world.
Zeal says he, is a fiery metled horse, and must have a strong bit and curb.
But he considers not that flesh is a dull horse, and needs more the spur. To
be over zealous, says he, breeds nothing but reproach and persecution to the
zealot. But woe be to him who, for well-doing, gives not occasion to wicked men
to reproach him, but will comply so far, as to have every bodies good word,
and all men to speak well of him Luke 6.26.
. Zeal without discretion is to be pitied; but such discretion, as this
hypocrite glories in, shall be spued out, and himself with it Rev. 3.16.
. He that has need of Soldiers, must bear with some military insolences:
and Christ who has need of zealous servants to contend earnestly for the
precious faith Jude 3.
; will be content (though this hypocrite will not) to bear with some
indiscretions in the truly zealous.

Differ.
On the contrary, the zeal of the true Christian is ever the same, shunning
extremes.

True zeal minds the cause; and, according to the importance of that,
rises, or falls, as the tide, which follows the course of the Moon. It is
not all on fire for lesser matters, as it would, for greater. It is fervent, as
the cause requires, it is governed by true prudence or discretion, and
proceeds with caution. A wise Christian is described by the meekness of
wisdom Jam. 3.13.
. In him, as in Moses meekness and zeal meet; Number. 12.3. Exodus 32.26, 27.
and wisdom tempers them both. He is not only carried with zeal, but
carries an hand over it. He uses zeal as a skillful rider does his horse,
making use of the mettle of his horse, suitable to the use he has of him. His
zeal is duly tempered; and so, is a good horse well manned.

He considers that zeal without discretion, is a ship without ballast, or
over-tyred with Sails, which in a storm may endanger all that are aboard her;
therefore discretion so manageth zeal, as to proportion the Sails to the
burden, and keeps, the vessel upright. Discretion is a male-vertue; but, of
which it may be said, as God, of Adam, it is not good that the man should be
alone: I will make him an help meet for him Genesis 2.18.
. No help meet for Adam, but Eve; no match for discretion, but zeal. A blessed
marriage, and fruitful of all sorts of virtue, when the head takes the heart to
wife, when discretion and fervent affection are wedded together. His discretion
qualifies his affection, and his affection warms his discretion, and quickens
it to action.

But if these be divided, they never do well. For zeal without discretion is
passionate and precipitate; and, discretion without zeal, is dull and restief.
In all affairs of importance, but especially in Religion, the middle temper
neither hot nor cold Rev. 3.15.
, is most pernicious. If therefore he find an abatement of due heat, he
remembers that receipt given by his Lord, Be zealous and repent ver. 19.
. He will not let the fire go out, but blow up the coals 2 Timothy 1.6. (...).
.

Zeal is both Christ's garment, and livery. He wears it himself Joh 2.17.
, and would have his servants known by it. And he that wears it, must not
only go in Christ's errand, but mend his pace; not only do his work, but do it
with all his might. He will take the first love of the Angel of the Church of
Ephesus, for his pattern, not that which was in its declination. He cannot
forget that God remembers him with his first, that is, his chiefest and
strongest love, therefore he will prosecute God with love, as strong as death,
the coals whereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame Cant.
8.6.
. No water shall quench it, no money out-buy it.

This sometimes [as the cause and times requires] transporteth into unusual and
heroic actions. If he be as meek as Moses, yet he can, for a need, break the
Tables in pieces Exodus 32.19.
, to show how unworthy the people were of them. If he be a Priest, yet he can
[when just cause is] execute judgment Psalm. 106.30.
. Thus Elijah, although a Prophet, made a slaughter of the Priests of Baal 1
Kin. 18.40
. Yea, and Christ himself, the Lamb of God, took up Arms [such as holy anger
ministred] to drive out of Gods house those that defiled it. In none of which,
discretion or advicement was wanting: but the cause and their calling did
concur with their zeal. It was their calling that gave them their zeal, not
their zeal that gave them their calling.

And albeit he has now no need to fear such transcendent zeal, seeing there
is now no such extraordinary calling: yet he knows that it well becomes him
to endure a kind of paroxisme of Spirit, when he sees men wholly given to
superstition, or impiety Act. 17.22, 13, 9, 10.
. Yea, admit there should be some error in his zeal, or in the zeal of
others, yet he holds it dangerous to quench it suddenly. Cold water in a
feavour extinguisheth the natural heat with the unnatural, he will therefore
learn wisdom from their sad examples, who by unadvised refrigeration have
turned from the scorching zeal of schism, to the cold and deadly poison of
profaneness. There is more hope in an acute feavour than in an Heretic. He
will therefore hold fast his zeal, and not suffer his discretion as a sour
husband to give zeal a bill of divorce, for being sometimes too hot and too
loud.

Thus, this hypocrite is ever too hot, or too cold; if, over-hot in one thing,
he is over-cold in another; neither hot nor cold, but lukewarm, which is
worse than either of the former, and least endured by Christ Rev. 3.16.
; the true Christian is ever fervent in spirt, serving the Lord Romans 12.11.
, zeal, being in him as the vital spirits that never cease motion or being,
till he cease to be. The zeal of the one, is like the brooks of Teman, or a
land-flood, always too high, or too low, that either is apt to drown with
overflowing at one time, or to kill him with thirst, at another time, that
resorteth to it Job 6.16, 17.
. The zeal of the other, is like a perennous fountain, to which, repair when
you will, and you shall never find more zeal than may turn to your profit;
nor less, than may serve for your use.

This hypocrites zeal is natural.

He is himself but natural, notwithstanding all his flourishes. Therefore his
zeal cannot be spiritual, that is an holy fire breathed into him by the Spirit
of Christ. He that cannot so much as perceive, or know (...) the things of the
Spirit 2 Cor. 2.14.
, cannot be capable of such a fruit of the Spirit. In him therefore it arises
from temper and constitution: by which the young man is vehement; women,
passionate; and the choleric man, fervent. But what virtue can be in that
zeal, that arises of age, sex, or complexion? His zeal may be hot enough,
that has that from nature within, which causes it to boil, and run over, to
the scalding of himself and others. The Devil will never seek to quench this
fire, which is his servant, and Gods enemy, because a work of the flesh Gal.
5.20. (...).
.

He is zealous at a venture, be it right or wrong. He is hot, passionate, fiery
and furious, and cannot be other. He needs rather some quench-cole, or a
water-sprinckle, than more fuel; a bucket, rather than a bellows. He is
vehemens in utramque partem nimis, too hot of all conscience to be right, what
side soever he takes. And, whereas he can do nothing, but with much
earnestness and fervor, he takes this to be zeal, when he is employed about
the things of God, which is in truth nothing but an exuberancy of nature. Such
zeal is like a two-edged sword, as apt to endanger his head that wardeth with
it, as his against whom he uses it.

Contrarily, The zeal of the true Christian is supernatural. Differ.


He is himself made spiritual, notwithstanding all remains of corruption,
therefore his zeal must needs be from the same Spirit that created him in
Christ Jesus unto good works Ephesians. 2.10.
. He is not a patcht piece, in some things renewed, in the rest natural: but
all things are become new 2 Cor. 5.17.
. He keeps account by what fire he warmeth himself, and from what Altar he
fetched his coal Isa. 6.6.
; even from God and his Word, which was in his heart as a burning fire shut up
in his bones Jer. 20.9.
. It was not from nature, but from the Word that he is grown so hot: and, from
the Spirit of God also, who in kindling of zeal, and burning up corruption in
his people, is a Spirit of judgment, and of burning Isa. 4.4.
.

When nature swayeth him, he is ready to say of it, as Solomon of laughter, it
is mad: and of mirth, what does it Eccles. 2.2.
? It may be vehiculum virtutis, a good Post-horse. A good active nature may be
of great use to a renewed nature, as a metled horse to a metled man. But as no
man sends an horse of his errand, because he can go apace, but sets a rider
upon him that understands and can deliver his errand; so the Christian suffers
not the forwardness of nature to go without a guide, but commits it to the
regiment of grace, which only has a right understanding in the things of God.

Thus, this hypocrite is for zeal, as the first man, for the substance of his
body, of the earth, earthy; but the zeal of the true Christian is like the
image of the second man, from heaven, heavenly 1 Cor. 7.48, 49
: the fire of the one is elementary, or culinary; the fire of the other, is
like that of the Tabernacle, and Temple that came out from the Lord.

This hypocrites zeal is merely moral.

Ethics, or Laws drawn out of the dim sparks of natures light remaining
after the fall Romans 2.14, 15
. Which is enough to convince men of sin, but not to please God. It is a
morality, such as that of Plutarchs drawing up, In his Philosophy, or Morals.
not such as Moses brought from the Mount. It is no other zeal than that which
Heathens and Philosophers have fetched from reason supposing an aptness of
nature to entertain it. For morality is but an art that helps nature, by
polishing the manners that they may be grateful to men, and useful to civil
society, only grace gives a new and godly nature 2 Pet. 1.4.
, and so refineth the conversation as to make it acceptable to God: which the
hypocrite never was partaker of.

This zeal of the hypocrite is but civility, or morality kindled by nature, as
a barrel of pitch on top of a beacon. As many men profess Religion upon mere
civil or moral grounds, and so are but civil, not regenerated men: so this
hypocrites zeal has no other rise nor nature, but what nature improved helps
him unto. This makes him zealous against false dealing, cheating, break of
promise and covenant, lying, etc. and on the contrary, to be very just in his
dealing, in payment of debts, in accounts and in discharge of matters of trust;
not out of conscience toward God, because he commands it; but because nature
and reason do sufficiently teach it. A good thing in it self, and tending to
the good of others; but not enough for him that does it, who doing what he does
on humane, not divine grounds, must look for his reward from men, and not from
God.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christians zeal is divine.

It is built upon a divine Basis, the Law and Word of God; which is both the
seed of which it is begotten, the rule by which it acts, and the power which
commands it to act. His wisdom and his zeal spring both from the same
fountain; they go up the mountains of Gods Word; and then, come down by the
valleys Psa. 104.8.
, of his heart and affections, to order his conversation aright Psa. 50.23.
. And because he must approve himself and his zeal unto God, he lays out his
zeal chiefly upon things that more specially concerns God. Not that he is
remiss in any part of justice toward men, or of sobriety in the government of
himself: but, he is zealous of both: but, he looks upward for the aid of
Gods grace in both; and labors to perform that in truth which Philosophers
have only bragged of: to practice that which they commend; and, in all things to
cut off the superfluity of self-love, self-conceit and vain glory, of which
they were so far from being wary, as that they were never so much as aware.

He is not the fool whose heart is in his mouth, but the wise man whose mouth
is in his heart. He preferres secret and mental wisdom before vain and
verbal zeal. He will do the thing, but not brag of it. Let any man take the
honor, rather than contend for it, so the work be done Judge. 8.1, 2, 3
. It was said of Aristotle, that he dipped his words in understanding, but the
Christian dips not his words only, but his actions and zeal too, in the Well
of wisdom Prove. 18.4.
, and conscience. He dares not utter what he feels not, nor profess what he
proves not, both what it intends, and from what Spirit it proceeds.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is like fire fetched out of the flint; nature
contains it, reason extracts it: the true Christians zeal, comes down from
above, from the Father of lights: grace yields it, and conscience draws it
forth Jam. 1.17.
. The zeal of the one, is but a cover for an heathenish heart going under the
name of a Christian; the zeal of the other, is the badge of his heart,
declaring him to be truly Christian.

This hypocrites zeal has more of policy than piety.

A zeal of state, and a face of zeal, to advance his worldly ends by serving
himself Jehu, of being made King of Israel, to destroy the house of Ahab, but
he and his Captains hasted instantly to the work, and dispatched it in a trice
2 King. 9.12, 13.
. But, Jehu was not so hasty to walk in the law of the Lord: for, to that he
took no heed at all 2 King. 10.31.
. It is true, he destroyed Baal and all that belonged to him; for Baal was but
an upstart God brought in by Ahab, and so might be more safely grub'd up before
he had taken deeper rooting; but, as for Jeroboams calves, his zeal extended
not to them: not that he cared for the calves, more than for Baal, as placing
more confidence in them (for he that cares not for the true God, is indifferent
for any other:) but there was the same reason of state for continuing of the
calves, that was at first for setting them up: which was, the keeping of the
people from going to the house of the Lord which was at Jerusalem 1 King.
12.27, 28.
which would have happened, had he destroyed their calvish gods at home; and
so, they might have revolted from him.

This is the zeal of this hypocrite, of which he so much vanteth 2 King. 10.16
. If God open a way for this hypocrite, to get a Kingdom, neither Jeroboam,
nor Jehu shall ever go beyond him in setting up the Devil, and pulling down the
true God that has advanced him, if reason of state shall prompt him to it. If
he be zealous for rooting out of Baalisme, which might endanger his crown, yet,
if Calvisme, being more generally (and by the strongest party) embraced, may
settle the crown the faster upon his head; He will be as zealous for this, as
he is against the other: it shall have his protection and countenance before
the true worship of God: and if Priests legally capable of serving at the
Altar, will not so far forget the duty they owe to God, as to offer sacrifice
to the Devil. He will admit any others, although the lowest of the people, to
do that work; and, whosoever will, he consecrateth him, whereby he may become a
Priest of his high places 1 King. 13.33, 34.
.

He hates Popery, as dangerous to his person, and state, because Papists hold
of a foreign power in chief, and by the principles of their Religion are not
tied to keep faith with any whom their holy Father (per antiphrasin) pronounce
Heretics; but, may lawfully kill and murder their Prince, if once
excommunicated by the Pope; But, as for any other reason, he has no more
quarrel to Popery, than to any other Heresy or blasphemy, which he tolerateth,
because not so dangerous to his particular interest. Come now therefore once
more, and see his zeal, not for the Lord; but for himself, and the Devil.

As he is instrumental to cut off all Ahabs race. He has his reward: for
thereby he secured the crown in his own line, and has the promise of the
throne unto four generations 2 King. 10.30.
, but, as he is an hypocrite, and has hypocritically and wickedly pretended
zeal for God, when he aimed only at himself, doing worse than all that went
before him, he knows where to expect another manner of reward for that; even
where Jeroboam 1 King. 14.11 12, 15, 29, 21, 22.
, and Jehu had theirs Hos. 1.4 2 King. 15, 10, 11, 12.
, not only in this world, but, with all his fellow hypocrites Mat. 24.51.
, and with the Devil and his angels in hell Mat. 25.41.
.

When the zealous profession of the Gospel is in credit, and the times do
favor zeal, this hypocrite is a great zealot, and commends it highly in
others; especially in great persons, even above truth, that he also may seem
to be himself all made of zeal. His cry in all places, is, O halcyon days!
especially when he himself have gotten well by them. He is then a sharp rebuker
of sin in underlings, a zealous pleader for obedience to superiors, chiefly
where superiors are present to witness his zeal for authority: and, whether
he have any care of duty himself or not, he will be sure to put on outwardly,
this livery cloak of Christ.

His zeal is like an outward fire, more seen in the face, than felt in the
heart: the fire of authority, makes him high colored in the face, but leaves
him cold at the heart, unless it happen to be heated with some warm
preferment. As for God, he holds correspondence with him, as States who know no
affections, but interest (many times do one with another. Francum amicum
habita, non vicinum; as a friend, not a familiar. He is content with Dionysius,
to make use of the goodness of the good God, when he befriends him, but he
serves him, as Jehu did Baal, under pretense of worship, he spoiled and
destroyed him 2 King. 10.18, etc.
. He will help to further reformation of Religion, that he may have his share
in the goods of the Church.

But, if the times be doubtful, he halteh, as the Israelites, between two
opinions 1 King. 18.21
, or turns mongrel, as those Samaritans that joined God and Malchon 2 King.
17.29
. He resolves to be neither Papist nor Protestant, but either, or both, as
occasion serves. He does not now know his own mind, till the times determine
for him. If the times prove dangerous, almost a Christian Act. 26.28.
; not altogether any thing, is enough, for fear of Bonds. He will not make
choice of miserable or discountenanced persons to be his friends and
associates, nor disable himself for preferments which change of times may
offer. If once his turn be served, he will seal up his lips, that they may not
lose him what they have now gained him: for, if he have gotten enough, and
climbed to the height of power with all, he seareth up his conscience, having
now no further need to dissemble with the times.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christians zeal is all for plain dealing, be his
interest, and the times what they will.

He is for the Lord, as Elijah, though the stream and tide be for Baal: and
rather makes God than man the Beholder and Judge of his zeal 1 King. 19.10
Temporibusque malis, ausus est esse bonus.
. He is of Metellus his mind, (but upon a better ground) to do well in good
times is no hard matter, but in times of danger to dare to be good is the true
note of a virtuous man. He rejoices in the prosperity of the Church, and the
free passage of the Gospel, though himself be in bonds Phil. 1.17, 18
.

He mourns when it goes ill with Christ's party, though himself be never so
well at ease Neh. 1.3, 4.
. If the times be doubtful, or dangerous, his zeal is so far from hiding, that
it sets open the windows, and keeps as it were open house Dan. 6.18.
. As Paul went bound in spirit to Jerusalem Act. 20.22
, when the Spirit of God told him before he went, what would befall him there,
and he believed it as verily as if he had been already in bonds, yet would he
not, for bonds, forsake the cause of Christ; so he adventures, upon any pikes
where Christ his General leads him; as knowing, he can be no loser, where
Christ is a gainer.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is as the Moon which waxes or wayneth, as she is
aspected by the Sun: the true Christian is as a fixed star that is above all
such variations, and keeps his sphere and station, without alteration. The
one is a false factor that enters his zeal in Gods name; but, for his own
profit: the other, as a true servant, consigneth it wholly to his Lords
account: the one, looks for a good market of his zeal, the other, for a
comfortable discharge.

This hypocrites zeal is a superstitious zeal.

As poor Indians worship the Devil with greater zeal than they do God, for
fear he should hurt them, so this hypocrite is more afraid of hell and the
Devil, than in love with God and his Kingdom. Superstition is very zealous as
being a will worship pleasing the flesh, and as striking terror into the
blind conscience if it omit ought that superstition prescribes. Such is the
zeal of the ignorant Papist (if stricken with any sense and awe of Religion)
Hell or Purgatory is his daily fear; heaven, his doubtful hope. Nothing is
certain with him, but what is most uncertain, Purgatory; to be delivered from
which so soon as he may, is his chiefest care; for which his zeal will spare
for no cost.

Nor are we without hypocrites of the same stamp at home, who yet give out to
the world that they are no Papists, nor believe Purgatory (wherein I believe
them; for, I believe they believe not any thing;) they like well the Popish
frightful zeal (borrowed from the Heathen Mormo's not from the Word of God)
whereby men should be kept in suspense touching heaven, (themselves having no
assurance of it, nor being in the way unto it,) and for that purpose prefer
Parsons before Perkins. And so, as some have an Altar without coals, truth
without devotion, so this hypocrite has coals without an Altar, devotion
without truth.

Contrarily, the true Christians zeal is the servant of divine truth, Differ.
and the handmaid of faith.

As the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their Masters, and as the eyes
of a maiden to the hand of her Mistress Psalm. 123.2
, so he looks unto Gods truth, as the Master of his Religion, and unto faith
as his leader in every action. A good servant has no will, but his Masters;
nor the handmaid, work, but what her Mistress sets her about. His devotion
and zeal, as it is wholly spent upon God, so it is guided altogether by his
Will and Word. He is not for terrifying of himself or others that profess and
practice godliness, with doubts of the issue, and with uncertainties of
salvation: rather he is glad, and gives thanks to God for such Interpreters of
the mind of God, as lift up the weak hands, and strengthen the feeble knees
Heb. 12.12
, that comfort and encourage the weak practitioner, and cherish the weary
travailer toward heaven.

Straight rules devised by men, do trouble him, although never so much cried up
by the superstitious; but Christian liberty from the bondage (not obedience) of
the Law, and Evangelical comforts from the promises of God, and the mercies of
Christ are his food, yea, his Cordials. The hypocrite in a Sermon likes best of
a loud reproof (not of himself, but of others) that fills his ears, and
feeds his tragic humor: but the humble Christian feeds upon consolation,
with thanksgiving. He is glad of threatenings to beat down his corruptions;
but he takes mercies as his daily bread, and portion, and goes his way,
rejoicing Act. 8.39
.

Thus, this hypocrite, as the servants of Tyrants, is very officious, and
serves God strictly, because he is afraid of him; the true Christian, both
serves and fears God with zeal, because he loves him: the one serves him with
strange fire, yet imagined to come from heaven, as the fire of the Vestals
lighted from the Sun; the other is a true Seraphim, whom God has made a
flaming fire for his own service The one drinks of the waters wherein the
Star Wormwood fell; of which; many dye Revel. 8.11
; the other, as an inhabitant of Canaan, feeds on milk and honey, and so
lives for ever

This hypocrites zeal is an unmannerly, and unkindly zeal.

It puts him out of kind, and makes him to forget his place. It takes
from young men, the beauty of youth, modesty; from old men, the dignity of age,
wisdom and gravity; from women, the ornament of their sex, silence; from the
ignorant, the key of knowledge, docility: from inferiors, that which commends
them; respect: and from a Christian, that which crowns his Religion, humility.
All this happens, not from the nature of true zeal; but, from that
Coliquintida which the Devil has thrust into the hypocrites pot.

By this means zeal becomes unlovely, and unseemely. It makes the young man,
regardlesse of those to whom he owes respect: the old man light, or furious
beyond his gravity; the woman, a disputant and a babbler; the unlearned man
opinionate; the servant, malapert; the Christian, arrogant: and in this, he
will be as a vessel settled on the lees, or frozen in his Dregs. Or rather, this
hypocrite is hereby made like Ezekiels pot Ezekiel. 24.6
, that seethes, but is unskummed, whereby the scumme does incorporate; or like
the raging sea, whose waters cast out mire and dirt Isa 57.20
, foming out his own shame Jude 13.
, venting his own corruptions under the habit of grace.

Indeed the foolish world many times applaudeth such zeal as seethes over, and
runs into the fire; and takes that for courage, which is but want of
nurture, when a man deals rudely and unreverently with his superiors, and
betters. This is that of which we may well say (and bewail) that has made
zeal odious and distastful to diverse in great place, who use this
malapertnesse of the hypocrite as a flaming sword to keep true zeal out of
their quarters. This was the unkindly zeal of the seditious in Jerusalem,
calling themselves zealous. Against God, they would have no King but Caesar
John 19.5
: and against Caesar, no King but God; therefore they tempt Christ, to give
counsel against Caesar, and to deny to pay tribute to an usurper over the
people of God Mat. 22.16, 17.
: yet afterward, that they may be rid of Christ, they will have no King, but
Caesar, and intimate a charg of Treason against Pilate, if he should not
crucify Christ Joh. 19.12
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the zeal of the true Christian is attended with humility and
comeliness of behavior.

The true Christian is herein as careful to be clothed with humility 1 Pet. 5.5
, when he is to exercise his zeal, as the Priests of old, to put on the
Priests garments, when they served at the Altar. He considers it to be as
much his duty to look to the manner, as to the matter of the work he
performs, that he may not be indeed, what Michal falsely charged David to be,
as one of the vain fellows that shamelesly uncovereth himself 2 Samuel 6.20
. Humility, (he knows) is as necessary to a Christian, as it is proper. It is
a plant growing only in the Christians garden; and, who then should use it, if
not he? and, when he, but when he is to show zeal for God? which he can hardly
do so warily and humbly, especially toward superiors, but offense will be
taken.

This teaches him to manage all with respect to his calling, age, place, sex,
cause and opportunity: or rather wisdom teaches, and this acts him in his
zeal. Young Elihu, though he was so full of matter that he was ready to burst
Job 33.18
; yet would not speak before his Elders had said what they could Verse 6, 7,
. Abigail indeed, in a matter of life and death discovered the shame of her
husband 1 Samuel 25.24 25.
: but not in an ordinary business, much less did she make it her business to
be so busy with her husband, as bad as he was. Queen Hester, although she made
bold to go to the King for the life of her self and people; whereas if they had
been only sold for bondmen and bond-women she had held her tongue, although
the enemy could not have countervailed the Kings damage thereby Esther 7.4
.

Howbeit, the Christian does not under color of humility, modesty, or keeping
distance, neglect his duty. When God calls him to show zeal, and he cannot
avoid speaking to superiors plainly and faithfully, he will do it; yet with as
much respect as the cause will bear. Under the warrant of his calling, he is
bold, as Eliah with Ahab, as Nathan with David, as Samuel with Saul, as the
Baptist with Herod. He puts forth himself, as opportunity is offered, when
his zeal may do most good, and his words take most impression. He will imitate
God, that reckoned with Adam in the cool of the day, when Adam now was in a
condition to see his folly; and, with Cain, in cool blood, when he might be
most capable of reproof: and, sent Jehu the Prophet, to reprove Jehoshaphat,
after he had escaped with his life out of the battle wherein Ahab perished 2 Chronicles. 19.2.
. If he be an inferior, he advises rather than admonishes; advertiseth
rather than reproves: yet so, as he will not be unfaithful to God or man,
whatever it cost him. He neither rusheth in upon a duty without consideration
of time, nor waits so long for an oppurtunity, as to omit the duty, in hope
of a better season.

Thus, this hypocrite is like one of these gliding or falling stars (as they
are called) his zeal carries him above his place, where he fires, and falls:
but the Christians zeal first kindles him on earth, and then carries him up
into heaven, as the chariot of Elias 2 King. 2.11.
. The one by his zeal, makes himself ridiculous, or offensive; the other, by
his carriage, brings honor to his zeal.

This hypocrites zeal is hard-hearted and unmerciful.

His zeal has more of bitterness, than of kindly heat in it. He is without
all bowels of compassion or consideration of the temptations of others, as if
himself were not obnoxious to tentations. He catches up zeal in so much
fury, that he forgets the Spirit of meekness Gal. 6.1.
. All sword, and no buckler is to be seen in his fight. He had rather kill an
enemy, than save a Citizen. He is (...), zealous, in opposition to others. He
many times zealously opposes a truth, because another holds it: and flies
furiously against this, or that sin, because he loves not the party that is
found guilty of it. If he can say, I am not as other men Luke 18.11.
; woe to those men that are what he is not, if they come in his way, and fall
under his zeal.

If he be not by nature inclined to uncleanness of body, O! how eager is he
against offenders in that kind! Not that it is uncomely to be zealous against
the sin; but, it is hypocritical, to waste his zeal upon the sinner, because
not of the same temper with himself. If he can hide the same sin in himself,
he thinks he may be, and is the more bitter against it in another, that
himself may be less suspected of being guilty of it. And if he thinks that he
has overcome some member of sensuality in himself, he is apt to account them,
who have not gone so far, among the dogs and swine of the world. He looks
upon himself as a Cherub sent of God, to go through the City, and smite,
without spare or pity Ezekiel. 9.5.
.

On the contrary, the true Christians zeal is compassionate. Differ.


Compassion ever attends his zeal, where there is any hope to save. In his
zeal, he ever makes a difference Jude. 22.
between these, and such as are desperately and incurably wicked. Compassion
makes him as zealous to save the sinner, as his zeal makes him hot against the
sin. Who more hot against the incestuous person than Paul; until he had
humbled him 1 Cor. 5.3, 4, 5
? After his repentance, who more compassionate toward him 2 Cor. 2.6, 7.
? As he has care to keep himself, so he is compassionate toward others. He
will save with fear, rather than see men perish; but yet he had rather use
lenitives than corasives. He had rather make a goat a sheep, than cast off a
sheep as a goat. He is (...), one that entertaineth zeal for consort, not for
discord.

The grief of his own wonds has taught him to mourn for the sores of other
men, and to touch them with a Ladies hand; and, to sweeten, not only counsels,
but reproofs. He cannot reprove, or restore others, without remorse in himself.
For he thinks first, what himself is, or has been, either in this or some
other way: are there not with me, says he, sins against the Lord my God 2 Chronicles. 28.10
? He looks upon his nature as a seed plot of all wickedness, and he considers
further what he may fall into by temptation: upon all which accounts, the
Christian soul says, hand ignara malis lapsis succurrere disco. The sad
experience of my own folly, makes me more tender of others that are fallen: not
to suffer them in it, but more tenderly to pull them out of it.

He looks what Christ (who knew no sin) did toward sinners. He was angry,
yet grieved withal, at the hardness of her art which he saw in the Jews Mark.
3.15.
: So he looks on other men's sins, not only with hatred of the sin, but with
grief for the offenders; thereby expressing a two fold-love: the one unto God,
by being angry with the sin, the other unto man, being sorrowful for the
sinner. The former, is the wine; the later, is the oil which he pours into
the wounds of his brother. Such was the temper of Moses the meekest man, and
the greatest zealot. In his zeal for God he brake the Tables of testimony, and
slew three thousand of Israel, by the hands of the Levites, sparing neither
friend nor brother Exodus 32.26, 27
; and yet in compassion toward the remainder, he makes an atonement for them,
begges their pardon, and desires rather to have his own name blotted out of the
book of life, than that they should not be pardoned ver. 31, 32
.

As the breath of a man serves him both to cool his broth, when it is too hot,
and to warm his fingers, when they be too cold: so the Spirit of God
instructs the Christian in the exercise of his zeal, to work by both love
and meekness, where there is any hope of amendment; and, to have in readiness
(wrath and ready vengeance) against all disobedience Amos 1.11.
of such as are apparently incorrigible.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Edom that pursued his brother with the sword,
casting off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath
for ever 2 Cor. 10.6.
: the true Christian is like that good old man, the father of the Prodigal,
that seeing his son in a sad condition, yet returning, had compassion, and
ran, and fell on his neck and kissed him Luke 15.20.
. The one is as a rash Leach that does more hurt, than the disease; the other
as a discreet Physician, tempers his remedy to the weakness of the party: The
one comes as an Executioner; the other, as a Chyrurgion.

The zeal of this hypocrite lies more in extolling the sayings and ordering and
doings of others, than in what he does himself.

He is a great admirer of other men famous for wise and witty Apothegmes and
sentences; and, more zealously commends the sayings of Seneca, than of
Solomon. He will prefer Lipsius before holy Bradford; And is glad to see
reason outface Religion, making her to speak what she never thought, or he
never understood; accounting it a matter of nothing, to contemn the world,
which grace with much ado hardly enables the true Christian to performer. He
takes that to be the best zeal that transformeth Religion into a vaunting
strain of tragic eloquence: and, to make the credulous world to think they
can do it, because they can say it.

Even heathenish zeal is much in request with this hypocrite, which shows
what wit can say, not what flesh and blood can do; and, making rules of
hyperbolical phrases, wherein (as Plutarch, said of the Stoics) they frame the
level to the stone, not the stone to the level; that is, things unto words, not
words unto things. But as it is easy to set down more in figures, than ever
any man was worth, So it is, in words and phrases, to express more than any
man can practice. Such Writers teach their Readers, as this hypocrite does his
Scholar, to know not himself, but them; and that (no otherwise than as they
mis-know themselves) on their own opinion: not what they do, but what they are
able to direct. And such as care not to know, or to better themselves by a
practical knowledge, are better pleased to gaze upon such imaginary pictures,
and even poetical patterns of perfection, of Plato's drawing, than living
examples of holiness and humility drawing in the yoke of Christ Mat. 11.29.
.

He loves to see other men zealous in actions too, so he be not bound to
follow. He sits at home at ease, but cuts out work enough to others Mat. 23.4.
, enjoining them good round tales of brick, without allowing them straw Exodus
5.9.
; appointing them journies long enough; not caring how tedious either the way,
or the weather be to the travellors. He that only looks on, never thinks
that another man works hard enough: so this hypocrite, who troubles not
himself with practice, cares not how strict the rules, nor how paineful the
practice of piety be made for others. Dulce bellum inexpertis. It is a brave
thing to see others fight, or to talk of fighting for one that never knew what
it is to fight.

It is strange to see how some hypocrites of this kind and stamp, esteem and
admire the strait-lac't Religion of some Popish Regulars. Any ecstatical and
transcendent zeal of a superstitious Anchorite or Hermit, does wonderfully
ravish them, but never draws them to endure hardship as the good soldiers of
Jesus Christ 2 Timothy 2.3.
. They mightily commend books of Resolution, who never go so far as to
deliberation. And if they vouchsafe to read better Authors, the only end of
reading is to gather flowers, not food; to read for commendation, not for
imitation, unless of the style. It suffices this hypocrite to have his zeal
in his book, where it does no hurt; not in his heart, where it might do good.
He looks upon strict rules, and those that walk in them, as spectators, upon
players, whom they commend for their graceful acting, but mean not to enter
the stage to act a part with them.

Strictness is by him better liked in a line, than in a life; in a book, than
in a rowsing Sermon; and yet better in a Sermon, than in an example: But it is
worst of all endured in an admonition; still the nearer the worse; and the
better, the farther off. If it be a whipping Sermon that comes not too near his
lusts, he brooks it well enough: but, if you offer to unbutton him, and
prepare his back for the lash, he will not endure it. He is as the Pharisees,
that made a shift to hear Christ pretty patiently, in his parabolical
discourses, until they began to smell that his aim was to reprehend them;
Then, a Lawyer presently seeks to silence him, Master in so saying, thou
reproachest us also Luke 11.45.
: as if this were not to be borne.

Some there are who account it a disgrace and affront, for any man to offer
them salt, as if thereby he accounted them fools: so this hypocrite is
offended, if you offer to impart your zeal unto him; to bring your fire to
warm him, as if he were a cold. Therefore, as the salt must stand by, and no
man must offer to carve salt at the Table; but, let every one help himself, or
be without; so this hypocrite is resolved to be beholding to no man to offer
him zeal, nor will he take it well of any man that thinks he has not enough
already, who so highly commends it in others, and to others. If any man think
otherwise, let him forbear offering to add to it, until this hypocrite (as
men that want salt use to call to their neighbor sitting by) shall think fit
to crave the use of his fire, or bellows. Either he has enough, or he is
resolved to have no more; or at least, not to be beholding to you for it.

Contrarily, what zeal the Christian shows, Differ.
is truly within himself.

How else should it be a consumption in his body Joh. 2.17.
? a fire in his bones Jer. 20.9.
? His salt is in himself Mark 9.49.
, and his fire in his own chimney, not painted upon the walls. He warmeth
himself indeed sometimes by other men's fire, not as a man that stands aloof for
fear of being too hot, and commends the blaze; but, as he that brings of his
own wood to increase the fire, and his own heat by it: or at least he borrows
from that what may cause the fire of zeal to flame higher in himself. As
Moses, seeing the bush on fire, said I will go near now, and see this great
sight Exodus 3.3.
, and so met with God; so the Christian admiring zeal in other men, does
thereby draw nearer to, and better his acquaintance with the Lord: not keeping
a distance from it, as from a wandering fire on the next hill, which he is loath
should come too near him.

His reading, hearing, and beholding the good examples of others, are unto him
as the laying on of fuel to make a bonfire in his heart. For, he puts them
carefully together, and lays them in order, by meditation; he kindles them by
prayer; and then, dresseth therewithal for himself and others, by daily
practice. Seldom shall you see his chimney without smoke, his hearth without
fire; his heart without flaming zeal. It is lar familiaris, his household fire
which he has always at command.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is like the usurers money, abroad in other men's
hands, not in his own chest: the true Christians zeal is like the Usurers
bonds, never out of his own custody: the fire of the one, is like that of a
Beacon afar off, more seen than felt; the fire of the other, is like that of
the stove or hot-house, sooner felt than seen. The one, is as the sorry
hus-wife that has her fire to fetch when she should use it; the other, is as
the virtuous woman, that can help both her self and her neighbors, because
her candle goes not out Prove. 31.18.
.

This hypocrites zeal most naturally runs out upon others.

It is like a candle in a lantern that sends out all the heat at the top: it
is like the Sun that darteth heat upon others, but is not burnt it self. It
looks outward, and is very busy abroad, like the lewd hous-wife whose feet
cannot abide in her own house Prove. 7.11.
. This hypocrite is ready and busy to reprove, rebuke, and admonish others,
and will (with the Pharisee Luke 18.11
, be very ready to make other men's confessions (without being called,) being
glad and proud of the office: but he endures not to be so handled himself (how
much need soever he has of it,) unless by his betters, whom he dares not to
gainsay; and then he bears it, because he cannot avoid it: but, biteth the
lip, and then contenteth himself witht this that he knows as much by them
though he dare not speak it: or at least thinks as ill of them, as they can of
him. He sees nothing so much amiss in himself, as to need much zeal, either
of his own or others to reform it.

Even in just reproves given to others, he discovers as much pride as zeal.
For he lets fly, as glad of the occasion to see how he can handle the man and
the matter: not so much to reclayme, as to insult, or exasperate. When he
hears of other men's virtues, he is not so forward to imitate them, as to
detract from them; to envy, not emulate them. His zeal is his envy, and the
taking occasion from their virtue, to pry more narrowly into their deformities:
and, the more others commend them for the one, the more zealously he paints
them out for the other; whereas, if they had nothing in them worthy of
commendation, he would never have been so zealous to rake in their dunghils.

He not only gazeth in other men's faces to view their open faults, but diveth
into their consciences, and goreth bloodily their hearts, and confidently tells
you, I see more evil in them than you are aware of. But he sees not the same
faults in himself, or not as faults deserving half that zeal against them. He
is as eager as Jehu against Baal and his Priests because that was Ahabs sin;
but not against the Calves at Bethel, because that was his own sin 2 King.
10.31
. He can find in his heart to be a Phineas to Zimri and Cosbi, but not to kill
the same sin in himself. He has several weights to weigh actions by: one to
way the faults of others, another, to weigh his own. He casts his zeal upon
others as Granadoo's, in a siege into the houses and faces of the besieged: but
as to himself, all his zeal is but as harmless firew-orkes, token of
triumphs, not intended to hurt any, in times of peace.

The subject, sees the fault of the Magistrate; the servant, of his Master; the
people, of their Minister; the wife, of her husband; and so, reciprocally. But
no man says (that which God so much desires to hear) what have I done Jer.
8.6.
. Other men's faults are put in that end of the wallet which hangs before, in
sight: but men's one, are in the other end, which is cast behind. Nay, this
hypocrite will not ordinarily let his zeal come near home, much less into his
conscience, to make a privy search there. In strangers, and in enemies, sin
is sin: but in friends, in children, in himself, they are but peccadills,
the humors of a Gentleman, that though they be failings, yet may be borne.

He is loath to be an enemy to vices in his children, nor can well endure that
any man should take notice, much more that he should speak of any thing amiss
in them. Who shall dare to say Adonijah, why have thou done so 1 King. 1.6.
? and so he makes God an enemy to his children, and makes his children to be
scourges and plagues to himself. The plague of God has ever fallen heavy upon
cockring parents, whether men or women. Oh friendship! Oh fatherhood! to spare
till God must needs fight, not with the rod, but with a Sword! Happily, for
sins that are unprotitable, the hypocrite may show some zeal against his
child: in sins more immediately tending to Gods dishonor, he is not so
zealous. He had rather see his children ungodly, or profane, than unthrifty. He
had rather God should be wronged than himself, and Gods honor made bold with,
than his purse.

And as touching himself, his zeal is least employed there. He is very forward
and zealous to chalk out the way to others; but, no have to walk in it
himself. He can tell them what they should do; that is enough. Let not them
tell him, what he has to do. No fruit of his zeal or Religion appears, but
that it makes him more supercilious and censorious; careful to hearken after
other men's behaviors, busy to set abroach new questions: but, if you once put
him to the point of practice, especially in a costly service wherein much
self-denial is required, he will soon, with the young man in the Gospel, go
away sorrowful Mat. 19.22
. Differ.


Contrariwise, the zeal of the true Christian tends homewards, and looks
inward.

There it begins, thither it returns, as all Rivers to the Ocean. Fire
first heats the chimney, before it heats the standers by. And zeal has not
only an ascendent motion from it self mothers, but also a retrograde, from
others to himself. He would have others good, but himself to be excellent, not
for pride, but out of duty. When he hears of excellent graces in others, he
envyeth it, yet emulateth the best; and, looking upon himself, is ashamed that
he comes so far short, and so makes use of other men's graces to provoke him
to amend his pace. He is glad and congratulateth with them to whose pitch he
cannot attain; and keeps company with them in love, and seeks to follow
them the harder, who outstrip him in perfection.

When he hears of other men's sins, he is humbled, but casts the first
stone at himself, not only as liable to the same tentations, but as
accountable in part for their transgressions: therefore he cries out with the
Prophet, Woe is me! I am undone, for I am a man of polluted lips, and I dwell
in the midst of a people of unclean lips Isa. 6.6
. Yet he was none of those dumb, or blind ones, whom he after reproved Ver.
9.10
. He is willing, with holy Paul to be humbled among and with the Corinthians,
for their sins unrepented of, and to bewail many which have sinned 2 Cor.
12.21
. Christ beholds the faults of the Churches in the faces of their several
Angels: and who is he that has not cause to accuse himself of the common evils
of others, for want of giving instruction, example, prayer, counsel, employing
of his Authority, or walking wisely in the use of his liberty?

The Christian therefore is more strict to himself, than to others: as
Abraham, that would nothing for himself of the King of Sodom, when he deserved
all; but left it free for his companions in War, Aner, Eschol, and Mamre to
take their share in the spoils Genesis 14.24
. He will not abridge himself of what he allows to his neighbor, that where
he is constrained to give a stop to his neighbor, he may give proof of his
impartiality, and that if he be in any thing partial or favorable, it is to
his neighbor, not to himself. He allows nothing to himself, which he does
more freely allow to his neighbor: nor will he reprove that in his neighbor,
which he winketh at in himself.

He is no less willing (upon the same account) to be reproved, than forward to
reprove. Let the righteous smite me, says he Psalm. 141, 5
. If they be slack and remiss, he will quicken them to smite himself. Nor is
he content only that superiors should do it, but even inferiors too, if need
be. For, in case of common duty, he looks not on them as servants, but as
brethren, yea, happily as his betters in knowledge or in the cause. For, with
him, it is laid down for a firm conclusion, Whoever the speaker be, the truth
of God is superior to him that hears it.

Finally, he defends Gods quarrel with the jeopardy of nature, yea, of life
it self: and, in that ease, knows no man after the flesh 2 Cor. 5.16
; he looks to Gods Image in all that are truly gracious; and, for that, he
honors them Psalm. 15.4
; and endeavors to imitate, yea to out go them. And he sees Gods mark of
displeasure (as upon Cain) in all them that are void of grace, and shunneth
their familiarity, as he would such as are smitten with the plague. And, as God
begins judgment, at his own house 1 Pet. 4.17
, so does the Christian begin his reformation at himself.

Thus, this hypocrite sees not his own sins, but in other men, and so
exercises his zeal only where he sees sin: the true Christian sees his
own sins both in himself and others, and therefore is most zealous against
himself and his own sins, which he beholds in so many places at once: the
zeal of the one is as a burning glass that collecteth the beams of the Sun,
and casts them forth, to set others on fire; but himself is not touched with
it; the true Christian is as a wall, that heateth by repercussion all that
stand near it, but is most hot it self.

This Hypocrites zeal is sometimes stinted, and confined to himself.

He that is all in, and for extremes, must needs miss that which is the mean
between both, how useful soever. He that at one time is so sharp and fiery
against other men's sins, and so cold at home, at another time will pretend to
have zeal little enough for himself, and work enough at home, not that he may
do any whit the more at home, but because he is unwilling to do good abroad.
Therefore when called upon in that kind to bestirre him to reprove and admonish
others, he answers, what have I to do with other men's consciences? it is
enough for me to look to mine own.

But, as respect of private profit overthrows the weale-publick, so this
appropriation of zeal will endanger the common good that ought to be sought for
the house of God. This is to bury the Lords talent in a napkin; for he that
will not employ it abroad, will do nothing but hide it at home; and so, that
which should be sent abroad as current money for the use of his Lord, is buried
at home by the evil and slothful servant to his own destruction Mat. 25.25, 26.
. He seems to make some conscience of swearing, drinking, mispending the
Sabbath, etc. Yet he reproves not those that do all these evils; no, not his
own children, or servants.

He considers not Gods sharp dealing with Eli, for his want of sharpness to
his sons; nor, how great that sin was in Gods account, even no less than
an honoring of his lewd sons above the living God himself 1 Samuel 2.29
. What then shall he answer unto God, who out of hypocrisy, is content others
should live in sin, that his own show of sanctity, compared with their
iniquity, may be the more conspicuous? Such hypocrites there are, who, rather
than want glory themselves, are content to let others to dishonor God by
sin, unpunished, unreproved, to be their foyles, the better to set off their
counterfeit holiness.

Herein he treads the footsteps of the Scribes and Pharisees, who, the more
to draw their own knowledge into admiration, took away the key of knowledge
from the people Luke 11.52.
, and thereby not only maintained a tyrannical pre-eminence, but also
(although to their shame) pronounced of the same people, that they not knowing
the Law, were accursed John 7.49
; and all, to maintain their own pride and ambition. In whose steps the Romish
Clergy has so exactly walked, that they have even outgone, and outdone their
first patterns, in that for many ages, even here in England they suffered not
only the common people, but even Nobles and Kings to live in ignorance, that
themselves only might administer the laws and rule at their pleasure: and,
winked at all the wickedness and abominations of the Gentry, Nobility, and
Princes, till they came to die, or to be cast into some great straites, and
then they reckoned with them for altogether: that so they may fleece them of
their estates, at the price of their souls, by settling great revenues upon the
Church (as they called it) making it sacrilege for any to alienate such
superstitious donations upon such hellish foundations; themselves being indeed
the sacrilegious thieves that robbed all of estates, bodies, and souls at once.

On the contrary, Differ.
the zeal of the true Christian is enlarged to the good of others.

It is the nature of fire to multiply in infinitum, till he has reached to all
that is combustible: and it is the nature of zeal (as of charity) to begin at
home; but afterward to extend it self to the utmost bounds set by God to that
holy fire. And this is true, of every true member of Jesus Christ (as well as
of David the type Psalm. 69 9
, and of Christ typified by him) which was exemplified in our Lord and Head,
The zeal of thine house has eaten me up John 2.17
. He whose zeal reaches not to the house of God, is but a Mongrel Zealot,
resembling neither Christ his pattern, nor any of his party.

The true Christian therefore holds himself bound, and accordingly endeavors
to restrain whom he can, that he finds going astray; and to do it as he can,
by entreaty, if he have no authority, or by admonition, prohibition, correction
(according to his power) from swearing, from frequenting the loose and lewd
Theaters, from drunkenness, and all other disorders and abominations, that he
may show his zeal for the house of God, and win others unto Christ, as Christ
has won him: and not fall under that compass of being against him, for not
being with him Mat. 12.30
, and of being condemned as a scatterer from him, because he gathers not unto
him.

His zeal, as it begins not in others, so it ends not in it self, until by
returning from others it has finished the Circle. He is not only good, but on
his own experience commends goodness to others. It is true that every body
must amend one. This is the least, but must not be the last: he that never went
about to amend more, may justly doubt, he never amended any. It is not to be
expected that if he be a private Christian he should carry on this work, so far
as the Minister, or Magistrate; but yet, it is required that he do what he can
in the family, in the Vicinity, in all places where Providence casts him, and
gives him opportunity to do him service.

And this lesson he endeavors to take out, whether he be Parent, Master,
Husband, Wife, Child, Servant, Friend, etc. yea, he takes that lesson of Saint
Austin Hom. 49. in 2 Cor. 5. Legatione fungimur. Tom. 10.
, which he taught to wives into consideration: that Father taught wives a
strange duty, to be jealous of their husbands, not to take it patiently (so
they know it to be so) that their husbands should abuse their bodies with other
women: respecting therein not their own flesh, but their husbands souls.
Zelentur viros suos, etc. let them in this be very zealous for the good of
their husbands.

Nor does he trouble himself with that childish or pusillanimous fear, I shall
offend, I shall be accounted too pragmatical: for he has long since resolved
that question, Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken more to men,
than to God Acts 4.19
; to displease, men rather than God. He knows that none can be offended with
him that would make them straight, but such as love to have crooked souls,
whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths Prove. 2.15
. That none can be content to see others crooked, but such as are not straight
themselves, or desire others should be crooked, the better to set off their own
straightness and symmetry of body. And as for such, pleased or displeased, he
is at a point, to please himself by pleasing God in laboring their
Reformation, or to leave them without excuse.

Thus, this hypocrite is as sparing of his zeal, as the widow of Zarephath was
of her meal and her oil, which was hardly enough to make one cake for her self
and her son, so as she had none to spare for Elijah 1 King 17.12
; the true Christians zeal is like Rebeccah, that drew water not only for her
self, but for Abraham's servant, and for his Camels also Genesis 24.46
. He has zeal for his friends as well as for himself: the one incloseth the
Lords Common, the other lays open his enclosures for the public good.

The zeal of this hypocrite is but momentany.

What is said of his joy, that it is but for a moment Job 20.5
; is true of his zeal, which is one of the pillars of his joy. For, what can be
durable in him except sin, that has nothing but nature, and flesh in him? All
his joy is but a Castle built in the air of imaginary graces, which vanish as
a wind, and therefore down comes all his building. The zeal of a man is his
delight and his triumph, false therefore must needs be a foolish mirth, a fire
of thorns crackling under a pot Eccl. 7.6
. It makes a great noise for the time, but it is as soon gone as come; it is
suddenly extinguished and consumed.

He has been over that fire; and though he boiled apace for the time, yet is
he raw still. For, not sudden boiling, but soft and leisurely heating, and so
continuing, makes a due concoction. Not every fervor, but that which is
mingled with wisdom and stayednesse, gives the true temper to a Christians
heart, and to his zeal: where this is wanting, his zeal the hotter it waxes,
the more cold it will leave his heart. Water that was once hot by fire, will be
colder than ever before; because the spirits that formerly kept it from the
extremity of coldness, is by fire boiled out of it: so will he that has no
other heat of zeal found in him, but that which some strange fire has raised
him unto. For, as unadvisednesse may put out that fire, which it first kindled
in him. So the withdrawing of that fire leaves his heart as Nabals, cold as a
stone, to die within him as to any life of zeal.

He was never so hot, but he left windows and doors open enough to cool him to
any temper that his corrupt heart and the times should think fit to bring him
down unto. He would never suffer fire to come near him, but on condition to
abate of his heat as many degrees as he pleases. And he that thinks it fit for
the time to be lukewarm, if need be, will see time also to grow key-cold.
This hypocrites heart is like the flesh of the Peacock; that after it is
dressed and made most fit to be eaten, it will grow raw again in a very little
time. Such is the temper of this hyhypocrite, his zeal that was boiled up to
the greatest degree and highest measure of boiling, soon cools and
dissolveth, and he returns to his natural crudity.

It were easy to show this in all the particulars mentioned in the former
Characters of this hypocrite. For ignorant zeal ends in heresy and
obstinacy against the truth, and sometimes in blasphemy against God. Zeal
without judgment plungeth men into gross absurdities, and fearful
inconveniences; and so, forfeiteth the whole for want of wisdom and choice in
the particulars. Zeal without discretion, is made ridiculous, and soon laugh't
out of countenance, and such Zealots are easily made ashamed of all
forwardness. Zeal, if it have too much discretion or moderation falsely so
called, degenerateth first into luke-warmnesse, and remissness in duty; and
after, into open profaneness. The natural zeal has a natural decay, a
sickness, a death. Nature may be patcht up for a while; but it will fail, die
away, and come to nothing.

The morally zealous regarding only points of civil honesty and humane society,
is many times by the judgment of God given up to fail most shamefully in that
which he made his highest glory, Politic zeal grows out of date with the
change of times, and is but Atheism varnisht over with the color and tincture
of Christianity. Superstitious zeal is like hemlock that makes him run mad that
eats it, and ends in desparation. Rude and unmannerly zeal, ends either
in rebellion, or in base Retractation. Bitter and uncharitable zeal ends in
hardness of heart; an humor not pleasing to God, and contrary to all men.
Zeal in a Book (not in the heart) alters with some later, and ends in some
looser Author, as the yearly computation, changes with a new Almanac. For
conceited strictness, without conscience and sincerity, resolves into greater
looseness, when the former humor is spent, or has spent the man's patience
that foolishly gave it entertainment. Zeal for others, or against others only,
ends in schism, and in the overrunning of his own garden with all manner of
weeds. And zeal appropriate to a man's self, without care to edify others,
ends in spiritual pride and self-love. In all we find that the zeal that is
not of God, for God, and from God, cannot subsist.

Contrarily, the true zeal of a Christian is permanent and immortal. Differ.


He that is borne again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the
Word of God which lives and abides for ever, must needs be immortal in all
his graces, and therefore in zeal 1 Pet. 2.23
. He loves not only earnestly and fervently Ver. 22
, but always; And as his love is, so is his zeal, He is zealously affected in
a good thing always Gal. 4.18
. He is zealously affected, because in a good thing; and always, because his
zeal proceeds from a good heart. As he ever rejoices, so he ever loves, is
ever zealous. His joy and love is in the Lord, and his zeal is for the Lord.
Sound concoction in him preventeth putrefaction. His zeal is as salt that has
not lost its savor: it does not only not putrify it self, but keeps that
which is inclinable to corruption from putrefying. Yea, it is a soul to the
body of Religion to preserve it from corrupting: And herein, more than a soul,
because it makes the whole immortal.

It is as the celestial fire in his proper Sphere that cannot be extinguished;
and as water in a hot bath that keeps its heat while the water remains there,
(although open to the air,) as from an internal and perpetual cause. He is hot
with others, not because others be so; but even when others are not so: and the
more because others are not so, growing hotter by the opposite that does a cost
it, as fire is more vehement by an Antiperistasis of the ambient cold.

His zeal is guided by knowledge, seasoned with judgment, ballasted with
discretion, and giving sails to discretion kindled from heaven, obtained by
prayer, devoted to God without respect of his own interest, fenced with
humility, sweetened with charity, rooted in his heart, spreading to the good of
his brethren. All these are everlasting Causes and Preservatives of true
sanctified zeal. So that we may say of zeal, as Gamaliel said of the Gospel, If
it be of man, it will come to naught: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow
it: and he that assaileth it, fights against God Acts 5.38, 39
.

Thus, this hypocrites zeal is like a squib, that has a flash, a crack, and a
stink: but the Christians zeal is like the fire upon the Altar of Incense,
sweet, and durable: the one blazeth as a Comet of fearful presage, but of short
continuance: the other shines as a star fixed in the firmament of holiness,
and is a faithful witness in heaven.

CHAP. XXXIV. The Judging Hypocrite Is he that judges after the flesh. Defin.

IT is Christ's own description of the Judging Pharisees John 8.15
, the greatest hypocrites then in the world; and, at that time, taking upon
them to judge of him as an Impostor, for bearing record of himself. They judged
basely of the Word made flesh, because themselves judged according to the
flesh. Look what he seemed to their carnal apprehensions, such they judged him
to be. They see with a carnal eye, and therefore judge carnally. All things
beheld in a red glass, appear red; so does Christ, not only as man, but as God
also, looked upon by the hypocrites fleshly mind, appear to be altogether such
an one as himself Psalm. 50.21
. If any difference be made by the hypocrite, he adjudgeth himself to be the
better of the two. He judges Christ to the Cross, himself to the Crown: for
he justifies himself Luke 16.15
, and condemns Christ Luke 24.20
.

He measures all by a fleshly rule, because himself is carnal: therefore is an
ill, (yet a busy) Judge of spiritual persons and things, which he cannot
discern or know 1 Cor. 2.14
, but by a false light. He compares not spiritual things with spiritual Ver. 13
, but with carnal, and so his judgment cannot be spiritual. This makes him so
apt, to speak evil of the things which he knows not; and, what he knows
naturally, as a bruit beast, he therein corrupts himself Jude 10
. He that abuses his judgment in what he knows, will never judge righteous
judgment John 7.24
in what he knows not. He will be partial in himself, and a Judge of evil
thoughts Jam. 2.4
; not calling evil thoughts to judgment, but judging according to the evil
thoughts within him. Flesh, that is, corruption, loves to be meddling and
judging where it ought not, where it cannot judge aright: but therein it is
without God, and therefore against him. Hence this hypocrite is very busy in
judging of others, very partial in judging himself. He is so busy in judging
others, that God himself escapes not his judgment; much less can they expect
to be free, who are of Gods party. And he is so partial toward himself, that
even where he seems severe, it is either to excuse, or secretly to commend
himself; and he will condemn all the world, and God himself also, rather than
himself; as will appear in the following characters of this seeming
Rhadamanthus.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian judges righteous judgment.

He will (so far as his Commission reaches) imitate Christ in judging. In one
sense, he judges no man, no more did Christ John 8.15
, not as renouncing the Office of a Judge to which the Father has assigned him
John 5.22
; but, no man, in a carnal manner, as the Pharisees judged him; such judgment
he would not pass even upon themselves, that judged so uniustly of him. Or, if
the Christian do judge (within his own jurisdiction) he will, so near as he
can, judge righteous judgment John 7.24
, and not according to the appearance, or show at first sight, without due
proof, and consideration. He will consider and consult, (or, take advice)
before he speak his mind in giving sentence Judge. 19 30
.

He is spiritual, and therefore judges all things, but, spiritually: not
according to fl^shly appearances or affections, but with spiritual judgment,
by a spiritual rule, and by just weights and measures: That judgment only he
takes to be righteous, that is measured by the Word, and weighed by the Spirit
of grace within him: measured by the Word, that it may be true; and weighed by
the Spirit, that it may be full. Herein he concurreth with God and Christ in
judging: and justly, for he that is to be one of the Judges of the World 1 Cor.
6.2
, subordinate to the Lord Chief Justice Christ, had need to judge as Christ
does. He that rules over men, in this world, must be just 2 Samuel 23.3
: shall not be then that is to be (joined in Commission with Christ) Judge of
all the world, do right Genesis 18.25
? Christ's judgment was true, because he was not alone in it, but the Father
that sent him, was with him in it John 8.16
: The Christian therefore will make this sure in every judgment that he
passes, to take God and Christ along with him therein.

Thus, this hypocrite will be a Judge, who deserves rather to stand at the
bar for his unrighteous judgment: the true Christian passes no judgment,
but what he believes holds weight in Gods balance, and for which himself is
ready to give account at the Tribunal of Christ: the one sets up the greatest
malefactor (the flesh) to be Judge, which should be judged: the other judges
that Judge in all his judgment; and will not sit upon the Bench, where the
flesh stands not at the Bar.

This hypocrite will judge his Judge.

It is is too much, that he takes upon him to judge the generation of Gods
children, (who shall be sure to be doomed where he sits Judge:) but this is too
little for him, unless he may sit in judgment upon God himself, who must
expect to fare no better than his servants Romans 14.4
. If this hypocrite fast, although it be but for strife and debate, and to
smite with the fist of wickedness, and God do not presently attend, and wait
upon him, to grant all he would have, the hypocrite presently arraigns him at
his Bar, and draws a peremptory Indictment against him, Wherefore have we
fasted, says he, and thou see not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul,
and thou take no knowledge? By which he concludes God to be too blame, not
he, until God be fain to enter his traverse at the hypocrites own Bar, and
calls his adversaries own conscience to witness, the hypocrisy and
wickedness of his fast Esaias 58.2, 3 4, 5
.

If God offer to find fault with him, for polluting his Altar Mal. 1.7
, and Worship, for dealing treacherously with the wife of his youth Mal. 2.14
, for vexing and wearying of God with their undutiful words against God Ver. 17
, for robbing of him Mal. 3.8
, for stout words against him Ver. 13
. This hypocrite fl^es as it were to the top of Gods Crown, and calls him to
account for unjust charging him, Wherein have we polluted thee? Wherein have we
wearied him? Wherein have we robbed thee? What have we spoken so much against
thee? All which can import no less than a challenge and a charge, yea, a
demand of justice against him.

If God make good his threatenings against the disobedient, in visiting the sins
of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation of them
that hate him Exodus 20.5
, when the children go on in the fathers sins. This hypocrite presently sits in
judgment upon God for so doing, as if God pursued the children merely for the
sins of their fathers, not for their own offenses. And hereupon he presently
takes up a bitter and a blasphemous Proverb against Gods dealing with his
people, as if he were most injurious and unjust in his proceedings. The fathers
have eaten sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge Ezekiel. 18.2
: yea, they pronounce definitive sentence against him, The way of the Lord is
not equal Ver. 25
. He will rather declare God an unjust judge, than confess his own sins, or
Gods judgment to be just. He never considers how God deals with a just father;
with a wicked son of a just father; with a just son of a wicked father Ver. 14
; with a wicked man repenting; with a just man revolting. He only looks upon
what himself feels, not what he is guilty of; upon what is inflicted, not on
what he has deserved: he remembers the wickedness of his father, for which
God might justly indeed have visited: but sees not his own sins which continue
the visitation. And so he condemns God, and justifies himself.

Again, if God do some acts which the hypocrite cannot fathom, nor find out
the reason of them, even all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God; all his judgments which are unsearchable; and his ways that
are past finding out Romans 11.33
, shall not only be disputed against, or replied unto Rom: 9.20
, (if any man take upon him to defend them, and God the Author of them,) but
shall be damned as cruel, unjust, tyrannical, and as making God the Author of
sin. If this hypocrite be a Franciscan, a Jesuit, an Arminian, or of any sect
or party that cannot submit themselves to the Wisdom, Righteousness, or
Justice of God, nor allow him to be as free as himself, (if he be, or were a
Potter) in doing what he will with his own clay, to make one vessel unto
honor, and another unto dishonor Ver. 21
. If God shall but say, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, I have
chosen some particular persons, absolutely (without all foresight of faith or
works) to salvation; and, refuse to show mercy to man's free will, to man doing
what in him lies, to man believing or repenting, without any reference to, or
drawing these graces from Election, to Judas, as well as to Peter: he must to
the Bar for it, and so must all that take his part. He proclaims this to be
infamous, Manicheisme, Stoicisme; and, what not Gods love to mankind.
?

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian looks upon God as his righteous Judge.

He takes not upon him to be Gods Judge: but prepares to receive his judgment
from God, the Judge of all Heb. 12.23
. He that judges him, is the Lord 1 Cor. 4.4
; to him he stands or falls Romans 14.4
, and is well content to do so. If he receive not such a return of his prayers
as he expected, he blames his own performance, and submits to Gods Will and
Wisdom. Not my Will, but thine be done Luke 22.42
. If God reprove him for any sin, he confesses all, and will justify God
before all the world, and clear his justice, whatever his judgment be Psalm.
51.4
, He will have God to be true, and every man a lier, that shall dare to impeach
his truth or justice, that God may be justified in his sayings, and overcome
when he is judged Romans 3.4.
.

If he has, under some sharp affliction and violent tentation, been too bold
with God, and shall hear God speaking unto him, as unto Job, Shall he that
contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? He that reproves God, let him
answer it. Yea, if God shall call him out, and bid him to gird up his loins
like a man, and speak what he can against him; and shall demand of him. Will thou disannull my judgment? Will thou condemn me, that thou may be
righteous Job 40.2, 7, 8
? His answer will be only this; Behold, I am vile, what shall I answer thee? I
will lay my hand upon my mouth: Once have I spoken, but I will not answer: yea,
twice, but I will proceed no further 4.5
. If with Jeremiah he take upon him the liberty to plead with God, and to talk
with him of his judgments: yet it is not out of arrogance to challenge God, but
in humility to be instructed: and therefore he justifies God in his very
Preface, and lays down this for an undeniable Conclusion against which he
will never dispute, Righteous art thou, O Lord Jer. 12.1
.

If God allow him to plead with him, and to declare that he may be justified
Isa. 43.26
, he will readily do that; but here he will plead the righteousness of God,
not his own Phil. 3.9
. Surely shall he say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength Isa. 45.24
. I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only Psalm 71.16
. He looks upon God, as the Lord our righteousness Jer. 23.6
. As for things that are too high for him, he will not exercise himself in them
Psalm. 131.2
; but is wise according to sobriety, according to the measure of faith given
unto him Romans 12.3
. He takes no pleasure in doubtful disputations Romans 14.1
, but declines them; and, to any man that would be doing with him, to draw into
disputes concerning the decrees and deep counsels of God, and to have an hard
opinion thereof, or of those that assert them, he only answers modestly, yet
resolutely, Nay, but O man, who art thou that reply against God Romans 9.20
? He believes every Word of God to be true, yea, truth it self: and what he
cannot understand, he adoreth; because coming from the first truth that cannot
lie.

Thus, this hypocrite and Antichrist shake hands; He opposes, and exalts
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he, at
God, sits (not in the Temple only, but) in the Throne of God, showing
himself that he is God 2 These. 2.4
; yea, as Lucifer, above him, and judging of him: the true Christian is so far
from judging God, that he saves God a labor in judging of himself 1 Cor. 11.31
; the one makes God his footstool, that be may insult over him; the other makes
himself Gods footstool, that he may exalt him.

This hypocrite judges another man's servant, without commission.

He that will call the Master of the house to his Bar, and judge him as a
Beelzebub, will much more deal so with those of his household Mat. 10.25
. It is true, he has nothing to do with either Master or servant, who stands
or falls to his own Master: yet he will be busy with both, because he is a
busie-bod^ that will have an oar in every man's boat 2 These. 3.11 1 Pet. 4.15
. There are Prohibitions enough gone out of the Court of heaven, to stay his
irregular and unjust proceedings: (as, Judge not, that ye be not judged Mat. 7.1
. Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come 1 Cor. 4.5
, etc.) but he will go on, for all that. And will rather hazard the incurring
of a Praemunire, by judging without a Commission, than stay till the Lord come,
and put him quite out of office.

Nor will he stay the Lords time neither: but he will judge all before the
time. Fleshly judgment is hasty; but true justice proceeds with a more sober
and leisurely pace. He judges according to the outward appearance, and so his
heart is instantly in his mouth, and he pronounces sentence, before he
understand the matter. It is not enough that he usurpeth Gods Office, unless
he execute it presently. Christ himself forbeareth, until the day appointed of
the Lord Act. 17.31
. But this Usu p^r thinks every day a year, until he judge as God. He is
commanded not only not ^o judge, but not to speak any evil of his brother;
being assured from God, that he that does so, speaks evil of the Law, and
judges the Law Jam. 4.11
, for he does that which is forbidden by the Law, and does thereby condemn the
Law. And ^f he jud^e the Law, he is far from being accounted of God to be a
doer of the Law, but shall be condemned for playing the Judge in condemning his
Law. It was to^ much that he took upon him against his brother, and deserves
to be punished by the Judge. But to judge the Law, is to pull an old house
about his ears, and all the curses of the Law upon his soul Deuteronomy. 27.26
.

Contrariwise, the true Christian, judges nothing before the time. Differ.


He judges no man out of an humor of judging* even when he is compelled, to
pass some judgment; but even then also, he stays his time. He is of himself
(where not called to it) (...), without judging, as well as (...), without
hypocrisy Jam. 3.17
: and the former makes good the other. There are many things which he dares not
judge of at all, Predestination, Scripture, and the final estate of any man
uncalled, and of the secret things which belong unto God Deuteronomy. 29.29
.

Where he has a calling to judge of other men's actions and occurrents, (in
relation to Civil affairs,) he will be sure to keep himself within due bounds,
which are Law, Reason, and Conscience. Law is his Rule, Reason his guide, and
Conscience the Administrator of Justice, these he carries always about him:
so that Law, Reason, and Conscience, not he, may be said to be the Judge John
7.51
. The Judge is but the tongue of the Law; and the Law, the mind of the Judge.
Wherefore he that judges beside the Law, makes the Law to tell a lie of her
self. He is careful how he judges both of the Person, and of the Action. He
will not judge of the Person without Authority and Calling from God. Such as
are Magistrates in cases Political; Elders, in cases Ecclesiastical; and
Governors of families, in cases Domestical: for these Judges being appointed
of God, their judgments even of the persons of men, (Justice being Judge) are
of him approved. In judging of the actions of men he does it not animo, (or
rather morbo) judicandi, as delighting to find matter to condemn others, but
as rejoicing to do justice for the amendment (if it may be) of the offender,
and the instruction of himself and others, that the righteous may hear, and
fear, and do no more so Deuteronomy. 17.13
. Much less would he delight in judging with respect to himself, as trusting
in himself that he is righteous, and despising others Luke 18.9
, as the proud Pharisee, that vilified all his neighbors to magnify himself.

In spiritual matters, he is careful to judge by the Word, or rather to make
the Word to judge all whom he has occasion to judge: and thereby to draw them
to judge themselves. Thus the Minister judges his hearers Ezekiel. 20.4
, by holding forth unto them the perfect Mirror of the Law of Liberty Jam. 2.12
, wherein they may see their imperfections. Thus the Christian judges and
condemns the world, by his holy life and example, as Noah by the building of
the Ark, condemned the world of infidelity and impenitency, and became heir of
the righteousness which is by faith Heb. 11.7
. Yea so, finally, he reproves and judges the unfruitful works of darkness
Ephesians. 5.11
, by walking as a child of light Ver. 8
: for one contrary is judged by another, as the crooked by the straight;
blackness by whiteness, and darkness by light.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Absalom, ambitious to be made a Judge 2 Samuel 15.4
, when no body needs, or desires him: the true Christian is herein as Saul,
hiding himself among the stuff 1 Samuel 10 22
, when others endeavor to put him upon the office; the one affects to judge
others, that he may seem to be something when he is nothing Gal. 6.3
; the other, when called to judge, judges so, that he may make others
something, though he be nothing 2 Cor. 12.11
.

This hypocrite when he is in office, is proud of it.

When he is first in Commission, he is seemingly humble and affable to all;
that, if they take no notice of his being in office, he may take occasion to
tell them of it, that they may the more observe him; which argues his pride.
They have put me into an Office, says he, which, God knows (and therein he
speaks truth) I am unfit for. He seems to blame those that put him into the
place; but, his meaning is, to teach you your distance, and to commend his
humility that vouchsafes to be so familiar with you.

He now glories in this, I can judge my Neighbor, my Minister, my Governor,
if he be once made a Ruling Elder; especially, if a Moderator. And because he
that is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is judged of no man 1 Cor.
2.15
. He begins now to take upon him like a Pope, as if he were the only spiritual
man that were now in power to pass judgment upon all men, and no man to have
power to judge him. But then, he must conclude that all others are carnal, and
cannot know the things of the Spirit of God. For, spiritual is not here put for
Ecclesiastical, but for one regenerate in opposition to carnal or unregenerate
men. Nor does this proud Peacock consider, that his judgment is not to pass
upon all men, but upon things only, (...), not (...). And, in judging of
things, there is more wisdom required, and profit afforded: but, in the judging
of men, more pride and less charity. And whereas he vaunteth, that he is to be
judged of no man, it may hold true if himself be (which he is not) truly
spiritual; and, he that judges him, carnal: for none can judge of grace but he
that has it himself. Nor is the judgment a decisive, but only discerning See
the margent, and the force of (...).
, to judge of the nature and worth of a thing, not to award punishment, or
reward. It judges what the thing is, not what shall be done to or with him
that has the thing on which the judgment is passed. But however, he is in
office, and he will be known in it: he will make some advantage thereof to
himself: for by judging others with severity, he expects that all should look
upon this as a proof of his own integrity; and that he would never be so sharp
to others, were himself guilty of the same or the like offense.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian is careful how to judge; not proud, that he
may judge.

He remembers that terrible threatening, He shall have judgment without mercy,
that showed no mercy Jam. 2.13
; and that, as the unjust man knows no shame, so the proud man shows no
mercy, does no justice; but is apt to speak grievous things proudly and
contemptuously against the righteous Psalm. 31.18
, and to have them greatly in derision Psalm. 119.51
; therefore he is so far from being proud of his place, that he stands more
in fear of his place, than others do of him in his place. He studieth more so
to judge, that himself be not afterward judged for judging Mat. 7.1
; than to show his authority in judging. He knows more now, than ever before,
the need he has of a wise and understanding heart to judge, that he may
discern between good and bad 1 King. 3.9
: and therefore labors to be the more humble, that he may be capable of this
grace; than to be lifted up, and so to go without it; yea, to be resisted by
God in himself in the seeking of it Jam. 4.6
.

If he be a Juror, he could wish himself none; but, being in the place, he will
be careful of his verdict. He will not be led by others, nor sell the present
cause and his soul too, for the next eight pence. If he be in any place of
Judicature, he could be well content, he were out of office, save for the
service of Christ his King; but while he is in it, he will judge uprightly
Psalm. 75.2
. He does not his own work, but bears witness to him that shall be his Judge
at the last day. He does it with all the caution and respect to God and man
that he is able, that he may not himself fall under the condemnation of either.

Thus, this hypocrite affects an office of judging, that he may appear to be
great, and to be able to say with Pilate, even to Christ himself, Know thou
not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee John
19.10
? The true Christian executes the office, (to which he was as unwilling of
himself, as the fig tree, to be promoted over the trees Judge. 9.11
that he may approve himself good by laboring to make others better. The one
coveteth the office, to lift up himself: the other fears it, for fear of
undoing.

This hypocrite, if he be for truth in judging, he neglects charity.

If he find out a crime, he is not so much grieved that it is committed, as
glad that he is able to prove it. The thing, says he, that I accuse him of,
and condemn him for, is true. I therefore do him no wrong to judge him as I do.
But that is a false consequence that he does him no wrong, because the thing is
true; for even in truth there may be wrong, as in Doegs accusing, and Saul's
judging, in the case of Ahimelech relieving David. Doegs report was true, but
malicious, concerning David's coming to Nob, to Ahimelech, and touching
Ahimelechs enquiring of the Lord for him, and giving him victuals, and the
sword of Goliath 1 Samuel 22.9, 10.
; (He might also have aggravated the offense with truth enough, that Ahimelech
gave him hallowed bread, even the shewbread that was taken from before the
Lord 1 Samuel 21.6
:) yet there was so much malice in this true, but spightful, report, that he is
cursed for it even by the Spirit of God himself, because he loved evil more
than good, being more glad he had so much evil to lay to Ahimelechs charge,
than ever he would have been to have seen Ahimclech innocent: and because he
loved all devouring words Ps. 52.3, 4, 5
: not for any wrong Ahimelech had done to him, but because he took pleasure in
devouring.

Such a Judge is in worse case, when he comes to give up his Accounts, than he
whom he judges; and he will find that for such judgment God himself will
visit the Judge, even when for the matter he is able to justify the sentence.
And if God shall not take Ahabs part against Jehu, whom the Lord set up on
purpose to cut off Ahab and his house; yet he will avenge the blood of Jezreel
upon the house of Jehu Hos. 1.4
; not on Ahabs behalf, but his own, for the pride, ambition, and cruelty of
Jehu in the doing of it. So God sometimes takes the part of the accused against
the Judge; not as if the accused were not guilty of the crime objected, much
less as favoring the sins they are accused of, but as espying the pride,
uncharitableness, and malice of the accusers: so Christ took the part of the
poor sinful woman, against Simon the Pharisee Luke 7.39 40
; not as allowing her sin, but as condemning his supercilious
uncharitableness, even when he saw the abundance of her tears, and her making
a towel of her hair. Thus, he justified the humble Publican against the
self-justifying Pharisee Luke 18.14
: yea, the woman taken in adultery, repenting of her sin, fared better in the
issue, than those Scribes and Pharisees, who insultingly, brought her to
Christ, and without all compassion, alleged the Law of Moses, for stoning her
to death, that they might accuse him John 8.4, 5
. If he was for sparing of her, they would then accuse him for breach of Gods
Law: if for stoning her, they would accuse him to the Roman Governor for
exercising a power of life and death, when it was not now lawful for the Jews,
to put any man to death John 18.31
, because they were now under the jurisdiction of the Romans who had taken
that power from them. Yea, God sets open the door of heaven to Publicanes and
Harlots repenting, and shuts it against those uncharitable Priests and Elders
that so proudly censured and condemned them. God will not have his own part
taken unjustly or uncharitably, but will reprove the reprovers of such as
deserve reproof, when in reproving, charity and mercy are wanting: as in the
case of Job Job 42.7
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian is as careful to exercise charity, as to pursue
truth in judgment.

He is as Joshuah in judging of Achan, although the offense was very great, and
the punishment must be sharp; yet before sentence, he has so much charity and
compassion, as to draw Achan to confession and repentance, that he who must
part with his life, might yet not lose his soul. My son, give, I pray thee,
glory to the Lord God of Israel, and confess unto him Josh. 7.19
.

In things that are private, charity, though it tell no lie, yet keeps
counsel, and concealeth the matter Prove. 11.13
, though a truth. And when he must judge, though he pervert not justice, yet
moderateth the judgment, so far as may stand with justice. He expresses
compassion, when he is enforced to be severe: not as insulting, but as grieved
that the charge is so true, the fact so heinous, and the proof so pregnant. He
herein endeavors to resemble the heavenly Judge, who when he is to pronounce
sentence, shows how loath he is to do it. How shall I give thee up Ephraim,
etc Hos. 11.8
? and as Christ, when he was to adjudge Jerusalem to a total and perpetual
desolation Luke 19.43, 44
he first beheld the City, and wept over it Ver. 41
.

Thus, all the Religion this hypocrite makes use of, or at least all the use he
makes of Religion, is, to see faults in others that he may judge without mercy;
counting himself just, and despising others Luke 18 9
: the true Christians Religion makes him to see more faults in himself by
seeing so many in others, and therefore pitieth those whom he is compelled to
Judge; the one makes use of his power in judging, as quarrelsom people make use
of the Law; not to order themselves, but to trouble their neighbors: the other
so judges, that he may make it appear how unwilling he is to do it, and does
it so, as remembering he is to give an account of himself to God Romans 14.12
.

This hypocrite judges others for what he condemns not in himself.

He is curious and covetous to inform himself of other men's faults, but
careless of his own, therefore he is forward to judge others, but slack enough
to pass judgment upon himself. Judah, no sooner hears of Tamars defilement,
but he passes sentence, Bring her forth, and let her be burned Genesis 38.24
: but he that made her an harlot, was not so hasty to judge himself for it, or
to repent of it. He judges another, and therein condemns himself, ere he be
aware; for he that judges, does the same things Rom, 2.1
. He never thinks of himself in judging, and so the sentence reaches himself,
which he passes upon others.

The same things which are vices in others, are not such in himself, if he may
be Judge. And Judge he will be till he has condemned himself. That is state in
him, and the knowing of his place, which in another is pride. That is
friendship and fellowship in him, which in another is faction, or sedition. He
is a curious Spy abroad, a blind Bayard at home. He is so inquisitive after
other men's faults, that he ascends so high as to pry into the sins of their
Parents and Predecessors: and rips up their offenses, when themselves are
consumed in the grave, but never thinks of his own, even when he has more than
one foot in the grave, and more faults in himself than he can find in others.

Contrariwise, the true Christian more zealously condemns that in himself,
Differ.
for which he judges another.

If he dislike and censure voluptuousness in others, he is thereby made more
careful to beat down, or, keep under his own body, and bring it into
subjection; lest that by any means, when he has preached, reproved, censured
and judged others, he himself should be a castaway 1 Cor. 9.27
. He knows that if he do otherwise, his own conscience will take him by the
throat, and demand, thou that teach another, teach thou not thy self Romans
2.21
? etc. He wisely considers the house of the wicked, that God overthrows the
wicked for their wickedness Prove. 21.12
; therefore he looks more narrowly into his own house and himself, and
enquireth, Are there not sins also with me, even with me, against the Lord my
God 2 Chro. 28.10
? and so he saves God, and others the labor of that enquiry.

He is as the wise man passing by the field of the slothful, and seeing it all
overgrown with thorns and nettles, he considered it well, and received
instruction Prove. 24.31 32
; that is, to look to his own, lest that yield no better crop. It is both an
effect of wisdom, and a fountain of charity, when he is to bring other men's
feet that have strayed, into the right way, to consider himself, lest he also
be tempted Gal. 6.1
. The wise man makes benefit of every thing, yea, of other men's faults, more
carefully to cure, or prevent like lapses in himself, as being no more
privileged from falling than others; but perhaps subject to greater
tentations: and so he takes occasion from the beholding of the nettles in his
neighbors garden, to weed his own.

Thus, this hypocrite holds forth knowledge and conscience as a dark
Lantern to see others by, but to be unseen by them, but of all to be unseen
of himself. The true Christian never sets up a light to discern and judge
others, but it is to give light to all that are in the house Mat. 5, 15
, but chiefly to himself: the one condemns his own sins in other men; the
other condemns other men's in himself.

This hypocrite is most sharp and severe in judging those who make most
Profession of

They are the men whom he seems to emulate, but rather envieth, because they
are his Rivals in reputation, which to him is more than all his Religion. At
them therefore he carpeth: in them, even virtues are vices. Their zeal is
madness Jer. 29.26
, or faction Acts 24.5
: their conscience, is hypocrisy Job 4.6.
. By their infirmities he justifies his own reigning sins. Their motes are
beams, and his beams are motes Mat. 7.4
. He can see their heart, and can tell not only what they do, but what they
think. As the old Critics had all Homers imperfect verses by heart, not
regarding the many good; so this hypocrite has the infirmities of Gods
children at his fingers ends, never looking after their graces.

He charge them with those sins from which few (and least of all himself) are
free, and which are most hardly discerned. If he find them provident and
vigilant to preserve, and make the best emprovement of their own in a just way,
then they are covetous: if notwithstanding their best care to walk with an even
foot, and to make straight paths for their feet Heb. 12.13
, they sometimes step awry, and be overtaken by occasion, then they are
hypocrites; if they will not bow the knee, and veil to him as a Deotriphes,
who loves in all things to have the pre-eminence 3 John 9.
, for that they know him to be a vainglorious hypocrite, that is not an
honor, but a stain to the Gospel, and to the Profession of it, then they are
proud. He is sure to charge them home with what no man's heart is wholly clean,
that they (knowing the bewailed corruptions of their own hearts) cannot wholly
deny, but rather with grief are apt to charge too hard upon themselves, who are
yet far more clear thereof than he that so unjustly judges them.

And, if, with Satan, he cannot deny them to fear God, yet he will question,
quo animo, with what heart they do it? as if all were out of hypocrisy, merely
for the protection, and outward blessings afforded to them, which if God
withdraw, they will blaspheme him to his face Job 1.10, 11
. He judges by himself what others are, and do, although in so judging he take
upon him Gods office in judging the heart; which none but a devil durst to
attempt. He charge Gods servants with his own sins, as Athaliah cried
treason, being her self the greatest Traitor: or as Demetrius charged Paul
with faction, when himself had put all the City into an uproar.

After all which sharpness, he will profess that notwithstanding all those
faults he sees in Professors, he loves them never the worse. O charity! but
well may we suspect the truth hereof, coming from him that can speak nothing
true. Charity sees not all faults, nor blazeth abroad all that it sees. But
that which most disproveth and reproves this hypocrite is this, that when he
has said all he can, and more than he can justify, he fears himself never
the more for the same, or greater sins: but, rather favors himself the more
therein, as glad to bring down Gods market in the price and worth of
Professors, not unwilling of their company in evil, and to say, jam sumus ergo
pares: now we all are alike. But, as they who reported evil, or received the
evil report of the Land of Promise, came short of entering thereinto; so such as
delight to speak, or hear evil of the ways of God, or of the infirmities of
his people, shall never have part nor portion with them in the inheritance of
the Saints.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian has an high esteem of Professors of Piety,
and of their Profession.

He is an honourer of such as fear God Psalm. 15.4
, because he loves God. He so respects the Image of Christ, which is the new
creature, that he honors all that wear his badge and livery, which is
visible Profession, and is loath to believe any thing amiss of such as bear
it. Jehoshaphat would not believe all that Ahab spoke of Micaiah, because
Micaiah was a Prophet of the Lord; but rather reproved Ahab for so reporting of
him, Let not the King say so 1 Kings 22
. He that fears God is as unwilling to hear, as others are forward to speak
any thing against those that profess the Name of God, as knowing that he that
makes bold to disgrace Gods Livery, makes little account of his Image.

The true Christian, if he be but tempted to think hardly of the estate and
condition of Gods children, he takes it to be a great offense to be overcome by
such a tentation Psalm. 73.15
; how much more, to speak against themselves. He knows how deeply God lays
to heart the least disparagement of his servants; and that he seems to be cast
into an admiration, that even Miriam and Aaron (who were no ordinary persons)
were not afraid to speak against his servant Moses Numb. 12.8
. And how sharply God both treated, and threatened such as had vilified, and
made light of those that professed his Name, and made mocks and mowes at them:
calling such scoffers sons of an whore Isa. 57.3
, concluding them to be children of transgression, a seed of falsehood Ver. 4
; therefore he chooses rather to cover their infirmities, which he is sorry to
see in them; than to speak all that he knows, even when he is most provoked
so to do.

Thus, this hypocrite is a foul bird that bewrays his own nest: the true
Christian is a Shem or a Japhet that covers the nakedness of such as by
occasion of temptation have laid themselves too open to view. The eye of the
one is so evil, that he cares not how little good, and how much evil he sees
in Professors, because the evil pleases him, and the good shameth him: the eye
of the other is so good, that he considers not how bad, but how good they be,
that the one may not be a temptation to evil, but the other a spur unto
goodness.

This hypocrite judges hardly, and censureth sharply such as God has laid low
by affliction.

To him that is afflicted, pity should be showed him from his friend, says
Job, who found little comfort from his friends in his affliction Job 6.14
. But what pity can be expected from him that forsakes the fear of the
Almighty? While a man is able to do well to himself, every one will praise and
applaud him Psalm. 49.18
: but when the Lord lays his hand upon him, and does as it were single out
and expose him to contempt, every one (but none more than the hard-hearted
hypocrite) is ready to trample upon him, to persecute him whom God has
smitten, and to talk to the grief of those whom God has wounded psalm. 69.26
. Now he is by this censorious hypocrite proclaimed an hypocrite, a dissembler:
and that he is served well enough in all that is befallen him.

In affliction is it the common portion of all to find that verified, All the
brethren of the poor do hate him, how much more do his friends go far from
him Prove. 19 7
? when he has most need of cherishing, he finds nothing but hatred, and that
from those that before pretended most friendship, when he was able to give
gifts Ver. 6
. None condemned Job more than his friends from whom he expected most comfort.
And this made all others to contemn him. His wife reviled him for being such a
fool as longer to retain his integrity Job 2.9
, which was so ill rewarded. His servants refused to obey him. Even they who
were younger than he, had him in derision, whose fathers he would have
disdained to have set with the dogs of his flock Job 30.1
, who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper-roots for their meat, who were
children of base men, viler than the earth: now was he their song, yea, and
their byword: They abhorred him, they fled far from him, and spared not to
spit in his face; because God had loosed his cord, and afflicted him, they also
let loose the bridle before him Ver. 4, 8, 9, etc.
.

Yea, many times Gods own children are not so true to their own side as they
should be, nor so pitiful and tender to the afflicted as they ought, when they
see the hand of God upon their fellow servants; but are ready to persecute
them, as God Job 19.22
How much more then will the hypocrite speak wickedly for God, and talk
deceitfully for him Job 13.7
?

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian is most full of bowels when he beholds the children of
affliction.

He does not lay load upon them, as being justly met with: or as supposing God
has set this mark upon them for some foul offense, some deep hypocrisy. He
considers and judges wisely of the poor. He considers God sometimes
afflicts his own, not for some special sin; but, for their trial, as he did
Job; for instruction of others, for glorifying himself in their deliverance
John 9.3
. He knows that affliction cannot make a good man evil, and therefore not
unhappy in the main. He judges not of Gods love or hatred by any thing
outwardly betiding himself, or others Eccl. 9.2
. If poverty be a punishment to the wicked, it is an exercise of faith, and a
means of salvation to the godly.

The fear of God makes him very tender to those that be in affliction,
because either they are godly, or in a way (through Gods mercy sanctifying his
hand) to be so. He hops God by this means opens their ear to instruction,
wherein he will not be wanting: and he works more upon them by his
compassionate handling them, than by any other help he can afford them. A
little oil now poured into a deep wound, is more welcome, than money out of
his purse. He therefore considers the poor in his affliction, whereby both
are blessed Psalm. 41.1
.

Thus, this hypocrite is as that merciless King, who when the Syrian horsemen
that came to surprise Elisha, were by a wile brought into the midst of Samaria,
thought of nothing but cutting them to pieces, saying to the Prophet, My
father, shall I smite them? the true Christian is of the Prophets mind that
answered the King, Thou shall not smite them: set bread and water before them,
that they may eat and drink, and go to their Master 2 King. 6.21, 22.
: The one is like the false harlot that cared not what cruelty were used to the
child doomed to be divided: the other is like the true mother that will rather
lose all interest in her own child, than consent to that inhumanity.

This hypocrite despises all that come short of him in goodness, and hates
all that go

He despises the former; not because he is no better, but that himself may
seem better than he is by taking notice of the defects of the other; who yet in
regard of sincerity, is far better than he. Such an one, who being a good
meaning Christian, yet ignorant of many things, and far short of this
hypocrite in some outward performances, and discreet behavior, he is glad to
have about him, as a foil to his seeming perfection, as a proud woman
sometimes entertaineth an hard-favour'd servant the better to set off her own
beauty. But, the latter, as a blemish to his reputation, and as daylight to
his Starre-light, or Torch-light rather, he cannot abide. Therefore as Players
and Masquers do either choose the night, or make a night, that their
counterfeit-shew may seem more glorious; so the hypocrite delights to converse
with those that are either apparently evil, or come far short of him in
apparent goodness; or, one way or other, to disgrace those that every way go
beyond him in goodness, that, in this darkness his own mummery may the better
pass.

It may be (if not too extremely transported with envy) he can brook an
eminent Christian in a dead book, whose eminent works are so fully witnessed
unto by all, that he should be accounted an enemy to all goodness that should
in the least disparage him; for he fears not rules half so much as examples,
nor dead Patterns so much as living Presidents. A book can but say, and so can
he: and a dead Pattern is rather hung up in a picture for ornament of the
house, than for imitation of the House keeper. Therefore as the Jews could
brook the memories, and adorn the monuments of the dead Prophets Mat. 23.29
, but not endure the examples and remonstrances of the living, no, not of
Christ himself (wherein he condemned their hypocrisy Ver. 34
) nor any that he sent unto them: so is it with this hypocrite, he can applaud
the dead, whom to commend is an honor to him that does it: but he hates the
living, whom not to imitate, is a shame. Such living Copies he would rather
burn, than commend, because he has no mind to write after them. Mortui non
mordent. Dead men bite not. Therefore we let them alone, no living dog shuns a
dead lion, but rather plays with him. Virtutem incolumem odimus, we hate
virtue, while alive, because the beams thereof dazzels the eyes of lusking
sluggards, that had rather seem, than be virtuous. A good man cannot purchase a
good word from the wicked (hardly from the hypocrite) by any thing but by
dying, to give him room. Only in dying he wishes himself in his case Number. 23.10
, but living he will never be of his mind.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian pitieth and helps forward such as come
behind him, and honors and follows hard after such as go before him.

The former, even when he finds him way-ward and peevish, as well as weak, he
bears, as becomes the stronger, with a condescending love Romans 15.1
; as the Nurse, the frowardness of her children 1 These. 2 7
: if the child cannot go, she carries it; if silly, she gently bears with it;
if froward, she stills it. If he find a weak Christian engaged and entangled
in any controversies and doubtful disputations with such as are too hard for
him, he endeavors to extricate and free him from such contests, (as Aeneas is
said to have carried his old father, and to have led his young son in his hand,
out of the combustions of Troy,) making the strong to know their duty, and to
see their error in puzling and vexing the weak.

The other he admireth, and aspireth to their excellency; not wishing them
worse, but himself better. He is glad of such a cloud of witnesses Heb. 12.1
, and fire of shining examples to go before him: but, above all, he is glad of
that pillar of the cloud, and of fire Exodus 13.21
, that Admiral-light, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of his
faith, and Forerunner into the heavenly Canaan, to lead and bear him in the
way Deuteronomy. 1 31
. He commends not only the Saints in heaven, but the excellent which are yet
upon the earth. He is glad of weak Christians, whom he may guide: but more glad
of strong, whom he may follow.

Thus, this hypocrite is to the weak, as the chief Priests and Pharisees were
to their ignorant Officers that had not apprehended Christ, they despised them
as silly Animals that were under a curse for their ignorance John 7.49
; and, to the strong that exceeded them, he is as the same Priests were to
Nicodemus that took Christ's part, hating him as a Galilean, (which were then a
hateful generation,) Art thou also of Galilee Ver. 52
? the true Christian is to the weak, as Aquila and Priscilla were to Apollos,
whom they took unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly
Act. 18 26
: and, the strong, he looks upon, as goads and spurs to make him to amend
his pace in following those who through faith and patience inherit the Promises
Heb. 6.12
.

This hypocrite disparageth one good man by commending another.

He will not, in downright terms, discommend a good man, whom every body
commends; but he will do it by a device, which is to set a better man by him,
and cry him up so highly, that there is no naming of the other any more. A
great secret and mystery of malice, to dispraise one by preferring another: not
that he loves him whom he prefers, but because he hates the other. His
name is now in question whom he thus seeks to disparage; let him fall at the
present, whether by friend, or by foe; by the sword of the children of Ammon,
or by his own company, it mattereth not, so he fall: testimony, he shall have
none from him, how well soever he deserve of him. As for the other, he shall
find from this hypocrite the same measure another time, however at present he
extol him to pull down another.

If with the Jews, he vouch Moses Joh. 5.45, 46
, and magnify Abraham Joh. 8.53. and 9.28
it is to vilify Christ, if not in his Person, yet in his members (which is
all one) which he likes not. Sometimes he will highly applaud some Scriptures
that give rules for, or description of an holy man; not out of love to the one
or the other, but mentions them when he hears mention of some body that he
sleighteth; merely to disgrace them for coming short thereof: as Papists cite
Fathers, and sometimes Scriptures in their contentions with us, they being
disciples neither of the one nor of the other; but merely vassals of the Pope,
as this hypocrite is of his lusts.

On the contrary, the true Christian so commends one good man, Differ.
that he disgraceth none.

He acknowledges that as there are diversities of gifts and graces of
edification, yet all useful 1 Cor. 12.8
; so there are several measures of the graces of adoption communicated to the
living members of Christ, which are all to be cherished and honored Psalm. 15.4
Ephesians. 4.16
. One man excels in the strength of his faith: another that has a weaker
faith may be more humble. One is not so well able to master his passions, yet
he may be more affectionate and loving. God has so tempered the members of the
body, that where there is a defect in one, it is supplied by another, that is
made more dextrous and active to carry on the work: so has he dispensed his
graces, that in the communion of Saints, he that has least grace is useful in
the body, and he that has most, has no more than he needs, either to be
assisting to others, or to combat with his own corruptions. Many times eminent
grace meets with strong corruptions that make work enough for all the grace a
man has. But however, there is no cause of disparaging the least grace,
because a fruit of the Spirit, which ought to be precious, although but as a
grain of mustard seed, for who knows how great the tree may grow, which
arises out of that one small grain. Wherefore as Moses will not despise Eldad
and Medad for prophesying, but rather commend and encourage them, wishing all
the Lords people were able to do the like Number. 11.29.
. So does the true Christian wish and pray that all may grow richer in grace,
and therefore cannot despise the day of small things in the weakest Christian
Zech. 4.10
.

Thus, this hypocrite in disparaging weak Professors, is like those wicked men,
who assisting David against the Amalekites, refused to allow any share of the
recovered spoils to his weak and faint soldiers that were not able to go up
with their fellows to the fight, but tarried by the carriages 1 Samuel 30.22.
: the true Christian is as David, in giving a share to those that tarried by
the stuff Ver. 24
, not disparaging them for, but comforting and encouraging them in their
weakness: the one makes the praise of him whom he commends, to be a cudgel
to break his head whom he has a mind to disgrace; the other makes the
commendation of the strongest Christian, to be a provocation to such as come
shortest, to better their pace.

This hypocrite sets virtues themselves at variance.

As he labors to make divisions among the virtuous, so he does among
virtues. He commends those that seem to make most for his purpose, and of
which he can make best use to serve his own turn; but never affords a good
word to such virtues as are more directly contrary to his way and design.
Thus, if he be a loose or lukewarm Professor, living as an Epicure, or
Laodicean, he never commends, but snibbeth zeal, (which is offended at his
looseness) therefore he cries up discretion, to wit, such as will let him and
his sin alone; or, he magnifieth charity, which will cover the multitude of his
sins, judge favorably, and make a good construction of all things. But this is
a charity of his own making, without either wisdom, or purity, without
knowledge of God or hatred of evil.

If he be proud, he commends not ingenuity, which neither takes from others,
nor forgets, (though happily foregoeth) her own due: but, humility forsooth is
highly extolled by him, or rather indeed vility, which will be a footstool to
his pride. Not that he intends to practice humility himself, but loves it in
others that will give him more than his due, although with robbing themselves
of their own right. And who can believe that he commends that in others with
good meaning, which he most of all hates in himself?

If he be covetous and desirous to make a prey of others, he commends not
thrift or saving, to them which are likely to hinder his own gains: that herb
he reserveth for his own sallet; that, is for himself, or for his heirs, (if
he can bring them to it, which is rarely seen:) but he applaudeth liberality
and magnificence, which has many men's good word, (because they fare the better
for it,) and this man's among the rest: but, he means riot, because hereby he
hops the Prodigal will the sooner be his prey: whereas if all were so frugal
as himself, he must look out another trade, or live upon the stock, which to
him is death.

Thus, this hypocrite is not for grace, but rather an enemy to all; yet will
seem to be for some (for his better grace,) but so that any intelligent man may
find his greatest business to be, the magnifying of some graces, on purpose
to pull down the price of other that militate more directly against his special
lust, and marches more furiously against his design. And yet even therein he
discovers his own corruption most, whereby he thinks most to hide it. For,
commonly he that makes it his business to judge others proud, shows his own
pride, because he never thinks he has his due from those he so censureth. And
nothing does more bewray a covetous man, than to count all men covetous by whom
he can be no gainer. In a word, he that loves the base-minded, is proud, he
that haunteth with the Prodigal to feed him with money, is covetous: he that
calls for nothing but charity, is afraid of a just censure. And so he would
set zeal and charity, frugality and liberality, humility and ingenuity,
together by the ears, in hope thereof to escape from them, all, the while they
are in the scuffle.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian affects those virtues most, wherein himself is
most defective.

If he be impotent through extremity of passion, he commends, prays, and
labors for patience: if addicted to pride, he commends and endeavors
after true humility: if apt to be a self-seeker, he labors after self-denial;
if covetous, he sets his affections on things above, and not on things below
Col. 3.2
, and to make him friends of unrighteous Mammon, as Zaccheus did Luke 19.8
, If oppressed by lust, he labors after mortification and true chastity of
heart and body, loathing himself for what he cannot so absolutely master as he
desires.

Upon this account he has recourse to such as most excel in those graces, and
propounds to himself the best patterns, that he may be best instructed and
most edified. He that would excel in Music, desires to be taught by the best
Musician. A Christian naturally angry, admireth most of all, not Jonah Jon. 4.9
, such an one as Moses, the meekest man upon earth Number. 12.3
. He that is inclined to lust, commends not Solomon 1 Kings 11.1
, but Joseph Genesis 39.9
. If tempted to covetousness, he looks most on those who have forsaken all,
or distributed most at the Command of Christ. O! says he, that I could be as
meek as Moses, as chaste as Joseph, as ready to distribute as the Macedonians
2 Cor. 8.3
. You may know his special infirmity and conflict by his commendation of other
Champions, who have won the garland, in that wherein himself is most weak.
Not that he does undervalue or neglect any other grace; but amongst all he
labors most after that whereof he has most need; not to set them at
variance, but to keep them all in the better harmony. For it is with graces, as
with a Lute, or other stringed instrument of Music, if but one string be
wanting, the Music cannot be complete or harmonious.

Thus, this hypocrite commends some graces, (or rather imaginary ones of his
own fancy) to disgrace other; the true Christian commends all, to make them
more lovely. The one commends that virtue whereby he may be a gainer by others
that have it; the other commends that grace of which himself has most need,
that he may be possessed of it.

This hypocrite is sometimes in an humor to excuse all, and to find fault
with

He is all in extremes; sometimes too sharp and severe; sometimes too remiss
and seemingly charitable, whether it be out of a cold and dull temper, or out
of cunning and hope that others may do the like by him. There are whom regelare
nec pestilentia p^ssit, nothing, how hot soever, can thaw. They are frozen in
Summer Aetas mea vix regelatur aestate. Sen. ep.
. But the hypocrite is, in his way, for the most part of an hotter temper, in
what he has a mind to pursue, although remiss enough in what he has not an
heart to embrace. He pretends charity (although much mistaken) to be the
ground of his favorable construction of other men's actions, and the reason why
he is in love with all the world, (he might have added, the devil and all his
works too;) and that, for his part, he dares not censure them as some (he
means, true Christians) do.

Out of the superfluity of his pretended charity, none can be so bad, but he
will excuse them, or at least hope well of them. Love, says he, sees no
faults; and, flattery, says the Christian, will not be aknown to see them. If
he find fault with any, it is with such as find fault: if he reprove any, it
is only such as reprove others. O, says he, you must not be so uncharitable;
you must not judge so harshly and peremptorily. You must not be so supercilious
as to condemn those virtues of the heathens as no better than shining sins. You
must hope well of those good folks, although they were idolaters, and, through
ignorance worshipped the devil, etc. Origin, says he, was a learned and a good
man, (as if goodness and learning were privileged from error) yet he held
that all the damned in hell, the devil himself not excepted, shall, at the
long-run, be saved; why then should we (says this hypocrite) be so rigid?

He judges of all without difference, contrary to the express assertion of
the Lord h^mself, whose charity was so great as to die for sinners. He says
there shall be a separating of the goats from the sheep; that the sheep shall
be set on his right hand, the goats at his left Mat. 25.33
, and that these shall go away into everlasting punishment Ver. 46
. Yet this hypocrite judges otherwise, and allows every man a room in
heaven, that they may not exclude him. No wickedness can make him fall out
with any, or shun their company. But if there must needs be a division, he
takes part with the worst, in his opinion and words at least, (which shows
his heart) rather than with the best: not out of true charity to them, but
partiality to himself. For well he knows, that, notwithstanding all his
flourishes, if wicked men must go to hell, he has little hope to go to heaven.

Yea, this hypocrite judges most favourablie of the most wicked, and notorious
offenders. Although he seem a great Zealot, and perhaps (which is scarce
credible) scorns a bribe, yet at the solicitation of a great man, a wise, etc.
will take part against the Law, with a wicked wretch, and studies evasions for
him to delude, and escape the Law, in a cunning way: and taxes those for
unmerciful and cruel, who are not of his mind, but punish the offender. But no
supposed infirmity in a child of God shall escape this man's censure,
(especially if he be underhand made against him by some great one, whom he
would, and perhaps must gratify.) Yet he can excuse, and swallow any thing in
a wicked man; and still has something to plead for him. If it be objected, He
is a Papist? It is answered, yet he is a good subject. If, profane; yet he
goes to Church. If, drunken; it is but by occasion of company: if, proud,
unclean, riotous, etc. you must bear a little with the humors of a Gentleman.
Any thing may be tolerated, save what he pleases to call indiscreet zeal;
that, is unpardonable. He flattereth a wicked man living, if rich and great:
and magnifies him when dead, although he died without one testimony of a sound
repentance and conversion. And no marvel; for all wicked men, (and so,
hypocrites) are partial one to another, to make the way to heaven wide enough
for themselves.

Contrariwise, the true Christian can neither be Newter, nor Participle.

Differ.
He knows that Christ himself makes a difference. That those be his will
discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God,
and him that serves him not Mal. 3.18
. Therefore he cannot stand indifferent in the common division. He sees that
the world is divided into Zion and Babylon, between Christ and Belial: and that
there can be no reconciliation or composition: that he that will dwell in Gods
Tabernacle, must despise a vile person Psalm. 15.4
: and that he is vile, not that wants money, but that wants grace.
Therefore he says unto God, Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am
not I grieved with those that rise up against thee; I hate them with perfect
hatred. I count them mine enemies Ps. 139.21, 22
. He will show no favor to them that sin with an high hand; nor mercy, to the
malicious.

He has learned from Christ himself, that he that is not with Christ, is
against him Luke 11 23
: and that the inhabitants of Meros were cursed with a bitter curse, because
they came not fort^ (...) the Lord against the mighty Judge. 5.23
: that Christ came not to bring Peace, but a sword Mat. 10.34
, yea, a fire Luke 12.49
; and that he desires nothing more than that it be kind^^^ in regard of
spiritual variance between the flesh and Spirit, and the consequenc^s thereof
between the nearest relations. And he sees him by faith standing as Jehu, in
the gates of Jezreel, and crying, Who is on my side? Who 2 Kings 9.32
? (or rather, as Moses, standing in the gate of the Camp, and saying, Who is on
the Lords side? Let him come unto me Exodus 32.26
. Therefore the Christian will, with the sons of Levi, come unto him and make
one, in the service of Jesus, as the Eunuchs, throw sin down, that it may be
despised and trodden under foot of all.

Thus, this hypocrite is as they that forsaking the Law, praise the wicked; the
true Christian, keeping the Law, contend with them Prove. 28.4
. The one under a color of charity, sows pillows under every elbow Ezekiel.
13.18
, that he may not want one himself: the other, out of true charity, pulls
away those pillowes; not calling the proud happy M^l. 3.14
, nor blessing the covetous whom the Lord abhors Psalm. 10.3
, whatever becomes of himself.

This hypocrite reproves sin but in jest.

Either he makes a great show of zeal in being very sharp and high in words to
delude the beholders with a show of punishment, where he intends to shuffle out
the sins from punishment. Or else, he makes a sport of sin; so reproving, as
affecting rather to break a jest, than to humble the sinner: to make himself
and the company merry, rather than to bewail him that has sinned, and has
not repented 2 Cor. 12.11.
. To laugh at sin in others is his recreation, and to commit it secretly
himself, is his occupation. But such carriage becomes not a wise reprover. But
it is by the wisdom of God noted to be the property of a fool to make a mock at
sin Prove. 14.9.
. And so, by that means he pleases all others, as very fools as himself; Sin
makes fools to agree, says Solomon (...) Stultos conciliat reatus Tremel.
Stultorum quisque p^lliabit delictum. Ar. Mont.
; either, by joining to commit it, and palliating it being committed; or, in
that when one fool that takes upon him to be more witty than the rest; breaks a
jest upon him that committed the wickedness, whereby all the rest make a sport
at the wickedness it self.

Such is the fashion of this hypocrite, and the Reformation which he labors,
that his great work is to set sin upon the stage, and there to whip it with a
fox tail. And this is the guise now a days of those, who being first the
chief corrupters, become afterward the great Reprovers of the world; making
themselves the greatest fools, by striving to show wit in deriding the folly
of others, treating sin in the language of the stage. This is all their
wisdom, to become fools in making sport for others that cannot keep fools of
their own. But sad are the times wherein this wickedness is in fashion; it
argues a wretched disposition in the hearts of men, when no reproof of sin, but
what is done in jest, can be endured. And whereas this is defended, under
pretense of laughing sin out of countenance, this hypocrite cannot but
perceive, that, this while, none laugh so heartily as the devil and sin. For,
as Jesters are glad to be laugh't at, because it is their means of living; so
sin and Satan never take those taunts in ill part, because their party is
maintained by them.

Contrariwise, the Christian is serious in this great business of God, Differ.
the reproving and disgracing of sin.

He considers not what will please others, but what will please the Lord. If
God be angry at sin, he will not make it his mirth; for this were a contempt of
God. If he be a Magistrate, his very language shall make all to tremble at sin,
rather than glad to hear a piece of wit. In this, he is like unto Job, If I
laughed on them, they believed it not, said he Job 29.24
. That is, if he expressed any levity in administering justice, as if he meant
to make sport, the people gave no heed nor credit to it at all. And if the
offender, to show the height of his spirit, and contempt of justice in
sleighting of punishment; and, with Agag, come pleasantly forth to execution as
to a dance, yet the Christian, as Samuel, will hew him in pieces before the
Lord 1 Samuel 15.33
. He will cause the wheel to pass upon the wicked Prove. 20.26
; and sitting down upon the throne of Justice, chaseth away iniquity with his
eyes Ver. 8
. The Christian will not retain, nor entertain sin in the nature of a Jester,
but make a slain sacrifice of it unto the Lord.

If he be a Parent, he considers that if the child be laugh't at for doing
some evil prank, the child will do it again with the more boldness; and
therefore he seriously and sharply reproves, and, (if need be) corrects him
for it. Wickedness is too malipert to be dallied with: and, he that sporteth
with it, causes it to abound. It is like ancient Rome, that, not a loose
Lentulus Plutarch in Cicero.
, (who made sport of his faults, when questioned for them,) but a sober Caesar,
was able to bring under bondage.

Thus, this hypocrite, in reproving sin, countenanceth it; and, in punishing,
encourages it: the true Christian, in reproving sin, makes it fly to corners;
and so punishes it, that it dares appear no more: the one reproves it in jest,
and retains it in earnest; the other handles it so, as to make all men
unwilling to have any more to do with it in earnest or jest.

This hypocrite sometimes judges hardly of himself, that he may blame others
the

How he judges others, we have seen. We are now to observe how he judges
himself. He never judged others, but to make advantage to himself; that his
severity to them, might make them seem worse than himself: and his remissness
to them, might prevent the condemning of himself. So here, in judging himself,
he is either too severe, or too favorable; and, he deceives in both. To judge
too severely is, for the most part, the weakness of a child of God, God, who
being on a good ground, cannot, he thinks, go too far in abasing himself
on Gods behalf. But, the hypocrite will do as much on another foundation, that
is, in favor of himself, and for the more sharp judging of others. His chief
aim is to flatter himself in evil: and, one way to do it, is, by admitting a
severe censure of himself, that he may lay the more load upon others, by whom
he is, as he thinks, causlessely or too cruelly, brought into such a condition
of misery, and sin.

Thus, he will perhaps judge himself damned and cast out of Gods sight and
protection, as Cain that cried out of his punishment, as greater than he can
bear Genesis 4.13
; because excommunicated from Gods Presence, made a vagabond upon the earth,
and exposed to the rage and cruelty of every hand. All this, is but to intimate
that God was a cruel Judge so to punish him. Not the sin, but the punishment
troubled his conscience; not the fault he had committed in not sparing his
brother, but the little or no favor that God showed unto him: yet was he bound
to spare his brother: but so was not God, to spare him. His exception was not
against his own iniquity, but against Gods severity. He never looked much upon
the horridness of the murder, even after he had received doom: for he
presently fell to building of Cities Ver. 16, 17
.

And so will this hypocrite do, in the case of sin. For, if he confess his
sins to be great, when he can no longer deny them, as Judas himself did, (whose
anguish was so great, that he not only confessed his sin, but (as covetous as
he was) threw the money at the feet of the Priests, and went and hanged
himself; yet he will be ready to say, that God appointed him thereunto; it was
his destiny, his hard luck that made him to steal an horse, or kill a man; and
that if others had not better fortune, they might have done it as well as he.
This is the blasphemy not only of ignorant wretches, but even of this
hypocrite, when hard put to it, and that he sees whereto he must. Or, at least
he thinks God did him not right, in that he kept him not from these outrages,
but gave way and leave to Satan and evil counsel to overthrow him; not giving
him strength sufficient to resist.

Thus, as he foolishly and impiously charge God to be the Author of his sin,
and charge Providence with his wickedness: so he serves others, as Adam
Genesis 3.12, 13
after he had sinned, laid the blame on his wife; and she, upon the Serpent:
and in the close, both cast it upon God, as if God had been in fault to give
Adam such a wife, and put so much subtilty into the Serpent. And so, as
malefactors condemned, do oftener find fault with the Law, the Judge, the Jury,
the Accuser, the Hangman than with themselves; or, if with themselves, it is
yet so, as the blame may light upon others that gave them ill education, or ill
counsel, etc. so does this hypocrite never charge himself with an ounce of
evil, but he charge others with a pound.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian so judges himself, that he ever takes the
whole blame upon himself.

Others may be faulty, and many times are the occasions, solicitors, and
tempters of him to sin: but he knows the fault of sinning was only his own. In
the first place, he will be sure to clear God of having the least hand in it.
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned; (he says not by thee, or through
thee,) that thou might be justified when thou speak, and be clear when
thou judge Psalm. 51.4
: yea, and clear too, when judged of others Romans 3.4
. He freely and penitently confesses the Indictment, and enlargerh the
evidence against himself, that it might appear that the Lord had just cause to
proceed against him.

It is the property of true Penitentiaries to whom God will show mercy, to
plead the cause of God against themselves, and to judge themselves worthy to be
destroyed, even when God has showed mercy in pardoning Ezekiel 36.31
. And God shall be true, and every man a lier, that dares to say the contrary.
Thou art righteous O Lord, says he, but we are before thee in our trespasses.
He dares not say, when he is tempted, he is tempted of God Iam. 1.13
. The Law, says he, is spiritual, not tyrannical: but I am carnal, sold under
sin Romans 7.14
. And though he sometimes seems to implead God, Why have thou made us to err
from thy ways, and hardened our hearts from thy fear Isa. 63.17
? yet it is not with purpose to charge their sin upon God, but to mind him of
his Covenant, which is, to put his fear in their hearts, that they should
never depart from him Jer. 32.40
, to move him to compassion, and to remember the word unto his servants, upon
which he had caused them to trust Psalm. 119.49
: and so he gives God the glory, because he knows himself only to be the
sinner John 9.24
.

Thus, this hypocrite whips himself, to cut another throat, confesses himself
guilty, that he may make another unpardonable; the true Christian condemns
himself, and acquits others, that the shame and punishment may light only where
it is due: the one charge God foolishly Job. 1.22
, the other abborreth such blasphemy.

This hypocrite pronounces hard sentence against himself, thereby to draw
others to excuse

In the former he made bold with God; here, he abuses man. He blames himself,
not as sensible of his sin, but that others may commend him: and, as it were,
strippeth himself of his rags, that others may cloth him with better apparel.
It is usual with him (who deserves bad enough) so to disable himself, and to
speak so vilely and untruly of himself, that such as hear him (not knowing his
inside,) cannot for shame, but say, Sir, you do your self wrong: you know not
your own worth, etc. This is that he looks for. And rather than fail of this,
he will call them in for witness; you know (says he) that I have no skill, no
wit, no parts, no wealth. Such shooing-hornes he uses to draw on other men's
commendations.

But of all ways of begging, this is the basest: and therefore most usual
among base minds; and, none more base than the hypocrite. He answered such a
man well, that hearing him so much to discommend himself, said, Brother, Are
you not ashamed so palpably to seek to be commended? But he is ashamed of
nothing but what he should; and therefore, will lose nothing that may commend
himself how shamefully soever gotten. Either he will draw you to do it, or he
will, in plainer terms, do it himself 2 Cor. 10.12
.

You cannot do him a worse displeasure, than when he so abaseth himself, to
leave him un-answered and un-opposed: unless it be only one way, and that is
in believing what he says of himself. If any man but seem to do this, it is
enough for a quarrel, or at least for an everlasting heart-burning. Then ye
shall see him turn on the other side, and defend his reputation, with an
Epanorthosis, or correction of himself; and let you know that though he made
bold with himself for an advantage; yet, if you have not the wit to understand
his meaning, or so much flattery, as to oppose him in his self-accusations, but
so little charity, as to believe him therein, he means not to give you or
others that liberty, which he now finds you take.

Contrarily, the true Christian will rather forbear discommending himself,
Differ.
even when there is cause, that he might not draw on others to commend him.

He has too much experience of complaining of his defects, and bewailing his
infirmities to some men, that rather vex him by praising, than help him by
counsel, He meets with too many, (and some of them friends) who are
Physicians of no value, and Chyrurgeons not to be trusted, who at all
adventure, will lay on a plaster, and never search the sore. He knows that
as most men use the matter, such self-bemoanings are self-praisings: and that
not he that (any way) commends himself, is approved; but, whom the Lord
commends 2 Cor. 10.18
. Therefore, for the most part, he concealeth the censuring of himself before
others; and yet remembers to be his own impartial Judge in secret. And he also
makes known his case to God, who, he knows, will not flatter him: and, if need
be, to some wise and faithful friend, who will rather help him to do better,
than persuade him he does well.

It is a great wisdom of a child of God, to know to whom to impart his
judgment of himself; and to lay open his more secret imperfections and
frailties: and, to be sure that he be such an one, as can judge, and will not
flatter: that is faithful to conceal them from public notice, and to prevent
scandal upon his Profession or Religion: that is merciful to think favorably
of him in the maine, not to despise him for his infirmities, and to esteem him
at a lesser rate, because he knows more by him; and that is wise and faithful
to direct him how to reform them.

Thus, this hypocrite makes his self-confessions, and self-denials of praise,
to be but as a Lure to flattery, and a stalking-horse to come nearer to more
gain of praise; the true Christian will rather conceal all, than purchase
commendations so basely: the one looks one way and rows another; the other
declines all landing of praise at his wharfe, which way soever he steereth.

This hypocrite puts off the judgment of himself, as a wrong to himself to
judge himself.

But now, he was too severe, yet without making himself smart: here, he is too
favorable, without preventing of smart. The extremity of right is a degree of
injury, why then should he be just over much to himself? He that is afraid to
find, is loath to seek. Alas! to search every private corner, to sweep every
hole in his heart, is too painful, too precise a course. Would you have him do,
as Baals Priests, or as some popish ignorant disciples do, to draw blood of
himself? Should he be like those pure-ones that are always whining and
complaining of themselves? that were enough to make one to despair, and to do
as Judas did; for after condemnation comes execution: And well were it for
him, if it were so, of the old man within him.

Hence it is that to him the popish doctrine is plausible, which teaches men
to neglect the judging of themselves, and neither to believe they shall go to
heaven, nor greatly fear their going to hell: but hope well, and have well:
and rather hop about a May Pole to put off melancholy, and nourish ignorance of
God and themselves as the only mother of hearts-ease and devotion, than to
trouble themselves in a scrupulous scrutiny of their own estates. In stead of
casting away sin, he casts away care; and, with it, himself.

He is a true Bankrupt, who of all places loves not his Counting House (for
upon the Exchange he can put on a face;) of all books, not his Leiger: of all
reckonings, not the balance of the Accounts, that tells him in one word, how
much he is worse than naught. He can make himself merry abroad in company that
molest him not, but loves not to be at home in his own conscience, which would
mar his mirth, by causing him to pore too much on Gods debt-book, to see how
much he stands charged there.

He cannot abide to consider what he has done Jer. 8.6
: but least of all, what will become of it. That Is a most terrifying question,
What will thou do in the end thereof Jer. 5.31
? His heart would soon tell him, (if he would give it the hearing) that as
there is no true fear of God before his eyes, so it is impossible for him to
escape the damnation of hell Mat. 23.33
. Therefore, in stead of putting such harsh questions to himself, and entering
too far into such self-examinations, he flattereth himself in his own eyes,
until his iniquity be found to be hateful Psalm. 36.2
.

We use to say, if a man love not home, home will not long love him. This the
hypocrite will soon find, if he love not, converse not frequently and
intimately with his own conscience; if he be not amicus conscientiae, and so,
amicus curiae, a friend to his conscience, and so upon good terms with Gods
Tribunal, (whereof conscience is a member and model) conscience will give him
but bad rest and cold welcome home in the day wherein he must needs retire
thither, and have comfort either there, or no where.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian dispatcheth the judgment of himself as of
greatest importance to his peace.

He knows that often and just reckonings make long friends: for by accounting
often, the account is sooner cast up, and any error in it more easily
discerned: and, by laboring to avoid all mistakes, all after-reckonings are
prevented. Therefore he clears often, that he may see how the state stands;
and, to know the worst while there is time and means to help it: He will
rather cast up his Accounts himself, than stay till others do it for him, as
Bankrupts use to do, upon whom the Creditors come, and cast up his estate for
him, little to his benefit or credit. What has he? What owes be? and so in
the Conclusion, sweep away all.

He knows that should he omit this enquiry into himself, not only Christ, but
Angels and men, and perhaps his enemies shall keep Audit upon him: therefore he
will spare them that labor, and himself that loss and shame which such an
Audit draws after it Lam. 3.40 1 Cor. 11.31
. When he goes abroad he finds much vanity, affliction, tentation, flattery,
that would abuse him in casting up his estate. Therefore he comes home for a
true censure and report of himself, and for true comfort. This makes him love
home, that is, his conscience, which will not deceive him; and that home loves
him again, giving him peace in himself, and assurance before God 1 John 3.21
.

Thus, this hypocrite staves off judging of himself, in hope the judgment will
never come, or at least to prevent the tormenting of himself before the time:
the true Christian hasteneth this judging, that the day of judgment may be to
him the time of refreshing coming from the Presence of the Lord Acts 3.19
. The one will not judge himself for fear of undoing; the other does judge
himself, that he may not be undone.

This hypocrite, if he must needs judge himself, corrupts the rule by which
he should

As they that, being foul and wrinkled, would think themselves fair and
young, delight to behold themselves in false and flattering glasses; so does
this hypocrite, who being evil, would needs retain an opinion of himself that
he is good enough. And it is strange to see the folly of such conceitedly-wise
men, in desiring to see themselves so, as none others do, or will behold them.
He loves flattery well, that, not content to be flattered by others, must needs
become his own flatterer in a thing so palpably false, that he cannot but look
upon it as a gross belying of himself.

Whosoever will justify a wicked man, must either forsake Prove. 28.4
, or corrupt the Law; this, the hypocrite does, that he may judge well of
himself: He corrupts the Law, first, in others, saying unto the Seers, see
not; and to the Prophets, prophecy not unto us right things; speak unto us
smooth things, prophecy deceits: get ye out of the way, turn aside out of the
path: cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us Isa. 30.10, 11
. He cannot endure to see himself in the Mirror of the perfect Law of Liberty
Jam. 1.25
. He must have false glosses, as it were false glasses to represent him to
himself according to his own mind, not such as he is, but such as he would be
taken to be by others, although he be not such in himself.

And as he corrupts the Law by making others to corrupt it, as David slew
Vriah with the sword of the children of Ammon 2 Samuel 12 9
; so he corrupts the Law in himself; understanding, and applying it according
to his own humor. When God curses him, he will bless himself, saying, I
shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart Deuteronomy. 19.19
. I stand not as other sinners in the Account of God. I honor him more than
many others, and do him more service. I have suffered much for my Profession.
My sins are not so heinous in degree and circumstances, as other men's. And this
he takes up for his Conclusion; I shall not perish, say the Preacher what he
will.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian takes the rule of his judgment as it comes from God.

He knows that God will judge him by his own perfect Law, therefore he
judges himself by that Law, in the sense of the Lawgiver, not of his own
corrupt heart. He takes the Law from the sense of the Judge, not from his own
private opinion which he brings with him to the Law. He considers that it
is a vain thing for Malefactors to think to teach their Judge a sense of the
Law, of their own inventing, who must be judged and executed by the Law of the
Land. If he have so much courage (or fool-hardinesse rather) to be a Dueller,
it is says he, the Law of Honor and Arms, to revenge an injury, and to call
for satisfaction where he has been affronted and dishonored: and that he
thinks, is warrant enough for him to challenge, and fight. But this will not
serve at his trial, he shall be judged, condemned, and executed, for killing,
by the public Law of peace, not of Honor and Arms.

The Christian therefore submitting himself and conscience to the Law of God,
and to the mind of God in it. He suffers the Minister to judge him, as God
appoints him, ( will thou judge them, Son of man, will thou judge them Ezekiel.
20.4.
)? But how is that? by causing them to know their abominations; acquainting
them truly with their condition, not letting them go away with a good opinion
of themselves, or an erroneous opinion of the law. Presumption of mercy does
more hurt than the fear of Justice. Corrasives are more safe for sinners, than
comforts. First, the rod of correction, and then the bread of consolation: and
so he is judged by the Minister.

Then, he judges himself by applying the Word unto himself. For, as God, in
the Ministry of the Word, holds forth a Mirror, so the good conscience takes
heed thereunto, and compares his ways there withal. Where the Minister
ends, the conscionable hearer begins. As when our Savior had said, one of
you shall betray me; the Disciples severally began to ask, Is it I, Lord Mat.
26 21, 22.
. So when the Minister of Christ has said, some have not the knowledge of God,
etc. 1 Cor. 15.34
. The Christia s conscience asks, Lord, is it I? or rather confesses, It is
I, Lord. And so he applies accusations and terrors, as well as comforts to his
own soul, as the case requires.

Thus, this hypocrite says to the Ministers of Christ, The Devil is in you:
What! will ye urge a man to despair? the true Christian says, God is in you
indeed, when the secrets of his heart are made manifest 1 Cor. 14.2.
by the faithful opening and applying of the Word. The one will be a Judge of
the Law James 4.11.5
, the other is a Judge of himself by the Law.

This Hypocrite presumes and judges that to be in him, which is not.

That the hypocrite is a great favourer of himself, we have seen in the
general. We are now to come to a closer view of him in some particulars, to
wit, in the esteeming, commending, excusing, and compairing of himself. We are
now taking an estimate of him by his esteeming of himself.

I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, said he, that
knew not that he was wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked
Revel. 3.17.
. As he that entered all the ship and goods at Athens into his own account; so
this hypocrite no sooner hears of faith, repentance, humility, or any grace,
but he has it; or at least writes himself owner of it. He is every thing that
good is, in his own eyes. No man like him. But this presumption is a
Quick-sand, whereon nothing it built but despair and ruin.

This high account of himself is the worst of sin in him, and mischief to
him. It is the worst of sin, because spiritual pride makes him drunk with
conceit of the beauty and wealth of his soul, which must needs be more
dangerous than pride of his body or outward condition. For a man may be happy
in God, notwithstanding deformity of body, or a mean estate in the world: but
he cannot but be miserable in the midst of the greatest happiness of the
world, if his soul be so deformed that God loathes it, and so poor, that it
must needs starve and perish for ever.

And this is the depth of misery, that this pride makes him incapable of
attaining and altogether negligent in seeking the true riches, because he that
says he has enough, never seeks after more: and, if this hypocrite could
seek, he shall never find, in the state he now is, because God resists the
proud James 4.6.
: That Is a miserable eyesight that makes him blind, and he knows it not;
miserable riches that makes him irrecoverably poor, and he feels it not, and
miserable clothing, that makes him naked, and he perceives it not.

Contrarily, the true Christian disclaimeth the goodness that is in him.
Differ.


Not that he denies it to be in him, but, that it is not of himself, if any be
there. He thankfully acknowledges the work of God and his grace, but sets not
an higher price upon himself, as supposing it to be more than it is, or to be
of his own procuring. Upon this account he says, I know, that in me (that is,
in my flesh) dwells no good thing Romans 7.18.
. Nature is too weak to procure it, and too mean an habitation (till the house
be new built) for such an Inhabitant. He that will not dwell in Temples made
with hands Act. 7.48.
, will not dwell in an house marred by sin, and overspread with the plague
of Leprosy; nor put any of his choicer goods into such a filthy storehouse.

Yea, that any grace at all is in him, he rather finds by proof, than
boasts of by pride. He is rather doubtful of his own judgment touching that
which is truly in him, than vainly confident of more than is in him. His
judgment is rather employed upon the enquiry into the truth of his goodness,
than in concluding the sufficiency and perfection of it Phil. 3.12.
. He rather desires and endeavors after goodness, than presumes and
professes to have it.

Thus, this hypocrite thinking himself something, when he is nothing, deceives
himself Gal. 6.3.
, and thereby becomes worse than nothing: the true Christian knowing his wants,
thinks meanly of himself, and thereby, of nothing becomes something: the one
is as having all things, and yet possesses nothing; the other is as having
nothing, and yet possessing all things 2 Cor. 6.10.
.

This hypocrite over-weaneth the little good that is in him.

Some good things he does, and this is all the goodness he has. He performs
some duties, of which others may have benefit; the goodness is rather in the
thing done, than in him that does it: as, due administration of justice, giving
every one his due, charity to the poor, etc. These are good acts, although he
be evil that does them. Good acts, in respect of men that enjoy the benefit;
not in the sight and account of God, that knows with what heart they be done.
But he himself esteems highly of them, and of himself for them.

And when he once comes to have a conceit of any goodness in him, he is
perfect at the first dash; and comes with full cry, as the young man, to our
Savior, that bade him keep the commandments, if he would enter into life; all
these have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet Mat. 19.20.
? If there were any work more to be done, he was ready for it. He thinks
himself able for any thing, and promises more than he means to perform. He
seems to be so taken with Christ, that he tells him, Lord, I will follow thee
whither soever thou go Luke 9 57.
: but when he hears of poverty, coarse fare, cold lodging, harsh
entertaintment, he says no more, but slinks away, and beshrewes his own
forwardness.

Contrariwise, the true Christian thinks the goodness that he has, Differ.
to be very little.

He acknowledges the least scruple of grace to be worth more thanks than he can
return; and to be of greater worth than he can value. But, as to the point of
rejoicing in himself, as having already attained all, or that he is already
perfect, he looks upon all, as so little; that, unless he get more, he thinks
himself undone. And so desirous he is of those things which are before him
Phil. 3.11, 12.
, and not yet attained, that he forgets the things that are behind, so as
once to think that they are enough for him, and that he needs no more. He is so
careful to press forward that he may reach the rest, that he scarce minds
what he has already gotten. What he has is behind him carefully laid up: but
what he wants, is always in his eye and heart, that he may attain that also.
Let others boast of their gettings, he will work? If they have enough, that is
not enough for him. The more he looks into what he has, the more need he finds
of more.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a Fool, that brags all day of a penny; the true
Christian is as the thriving Merchant, that silently thinks how far short he
is of that which diligence may bring in unto him: the one thinks his molehill
a mountain; the other that labors for the mountain, thinks all that he has
to be but a molehill.

This hypocrite imputes to himself that which is of God.

He is as they who sacrifice to their net, and burn incense unto their dragge,
because by them (as they think) their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous
Hab. 1.16.
. Whatever grace, or show of grace is in him to curb and restrain corruption,
he takes to be but a graff of his own tree, the fruit of his own industry.
Grace is dug out of his own Quarrie, salvation it self is in greatest part
earned at his fingers ends. He boasts of his power to get grace, as Pilate
did of his, to crucify Christ; know thou not that I have power, etc? John
19.10.
But, as Christ answered Pilate, thou could have no power at all against me,
except it were given thee from above Ver. 11.
: so it may be said to this hypocrite, boasting of his power to curb his
appetite, to refrain anger, covetousness, etc. thou should have no more
power than others, if it were not for some portions of common graces
restraining thee, which are not given to all other men subject to the same
lusts.

On the contrary, the true Christian is careful to give all to God.

Differ.
He knows that he has not any thing, but what he has received 1 Cor. 4.7.
: Grace is Gods penny, and wherever it be found, it has his image and
superscription: Therefore he will not forget to pay him tribute Mat. 22.21.
. All his sufficiency is of God, even for thoughts, as well as actions 2 Cor.
5.3.
. By the grace of God, says he, I am that I am 1 Cor. 15.10
. He is able to do all things; but, it is through Christ that strengthens him
Phil. 4.12.
. When the Ladies of Athens boasted every one of her rich Jewels, the wife of
Phocion answered, I have no Jewels but my husband that has bin twenty years
General of Athens. So the Christian soul when he hears the hypocrite bragging
of his rich store of self-gotten riches evel. 3.17.
, humbly says, he has nothing to boast of, but the virtue, and cross, and
glory of Christ her husband, and God forbid, says she, that I should glory,
save only in his cross, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto
the world Gal. 6.14.
.

The good that is in him, he ought to know to be in him, and not to be of him.
He knows nothing to be his own, but sin: and this he will so remember that
God may forget it: but for any good he has, or does, he rather forgets that,
that if it be worth remembering, God may remember it, and spare him
notwithstanding, according to the greatness of his mercy Neh. 12.22.
.

Thus, this hypocrite never thinks he has his due, unless he rob God of his:
the true Christian accounts it no less than sacrilege, not to give unto God
that which is Gods; and, that is all that he has: the one will be his own
foundation, which is sand, and loses all: the other acknowledges all to be of
God, and saves all.

This hypocrite over-seeth the evil that is in himself.

He is like those who being dangerously sick, discern not their own sickness,
because they look only on the urine, but feel not the pulse. He vieweth
outward appearances, but communeth not with his own heart. He abhors the
knowledge of his own heart, because he knows too much of it already; and
therefore cannot endure to be brought face to face to his own heart. He can
bear a reproof in the general and at random; but not of his special sin,
unless happily from a stranger that knows him not, and so shot an arrow at a
venture, not knowing in whose bosom it has lighted.

He sees not what God sees, his poverty, his blindness, his nakedness; or
if he happen to espy them in a glance, he soon looks off again, and will not be
aknown of what he has seen. Even the child of God is many times faulty this
way, ye know not (says Christ) of what spirit ye are Luke 9.55.
. But the hypocrite purposely winketh at what is evil in himself; and would
willingly bear God down that there is no such matter. If God tell him, in thy
skirts is found the blood of innocents: the hypocrite says confidently,
because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me Jer. 2.34.35.
. He thinks God has no more against him, than he is willing to have against
himself. A proud, or a worldly man, never thinks himself proud, or worldly;
but, what he does, he has reason for, let God and men say what they will
against it.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian desires to see and know the worst of himself.

He that is an enemy to sin, has a very Jealous and vigilant eye upon all
the motions of it, and desires the best intelligence of all the lurkings of it.
He should be extremely troubled that a snake should creep into his bosom, yea
into his mouth, and he not aware of it. The Christian therefore, being an
implacable enemy to sin, especially to his own sins, his bosome-traytors,
he cannot but desire to know as much as possibly he can of all their lurking
holes, and plots upon him. And albeit there be no sight so loathsome to him as
the sight of sin; yet no discovery can be more acceptable to him than the
notice of any lust or sin that secretly haunts him.

He sees the evil in himself that others discern not, and takes not to
himself all the good that others ascribe. When others commend him for humility,
diligence, liberality, etc. He complains of and seriously asks God the
forgiveness of his pride, idleness, worldliness, security, etc. and fearing
his own heart would flatter him, he has recourse to him that is no flatterer,
craving his help herein, and praying to him, says, search me O God, and know
my heart, try me, and know my thoughts, and see if there be any wicked way in
me, and lead me in the way everlasting Ps. 139 23.24
. He dares not trust any but God himself to make this search, that so he may be
sure to have a full discovery of all.

He that would mend his house, or his garments, looks but little on what is
whole; but his eye is most upon the defects and breaches. So the Christian,
desirous to mend himself and his heart, has his eye most upon the evil which
is in him. I am carnal, sold under sin, says he Romans 7.14.
. And, when I would do good, evil is present with me Ver. 21.
. Vbi dolor, ibi digitus: his finger is still upon his sore. Above all, he is
careful to know his special sin: for, that does most endanger; and being not
espied, and prevented, may soonest do him a mischief.

Thus, this hypocrite sees not that in himself, which all men see; and sees,
that (as he thinks) in himself which none else can see. The true Christian
sees more than all the world in the matter of evil, and he cannot see what all
men see in the matter of goodness: the one will see nothing that may disparage
him, the other will over-see nothing that might undo him.

This hypocrite loves to be commended, though it be for evil.

He that has an high esteem of himself, thinks he has wrong, if he be not
commended by others: and if they fail, he will, Thrasonically, do it himself;
yea, he will be his own herald, even in the ears of God. God I thank thee, I
am not as other men, etc Luke 18.12.
. Would he be satisfied with commendations for what is good, the matter were
less exceptionable; yet more than any wise man truly good would hunt after:
but this serves not his turn. For as in judging of others, virtues must have
names of vice, that he may find fault: So, in judging himself he borrows the
names of virtues, that he may not find fault.

For another to be liberal but a little, is, in this hypocrites account,
extreme covetousness; to be but a little humble, is extreme pride: but, for
himself to be but a little covetous, is great liberality; to be a little proud,
is exceeding humility. If he be rash, it is valor: if cowardly, it is
discretion; if angry and furious, it is his good nature, soon hot, and soon
cool again. If he be a little profane, it is his sincerity, he is no hypocrite.
If he be greedy and griping after the world, and grindeth the faces of the
poor, it is his frugality and care of his family: if he be cruel, it is his
justice and integrity. In a word, he practices the rule which Aristotle gave
to his Rhetorician, to palliate vices with the names of those virtues upon
which they do confine.

This is common in these days: and, no marvail; For if sin and this
hypocrite be all one, how can the man be commended, unless the sin be some
way justified? therefore man devises to put reputation upon sins, to
justify himself living in them. Upon drunkenness, (the deluge which has left
us at this day scarce any dry land, I mean, dry or sober brains) men put the
reputation of good fellowship, friendship, and what not? and to refuse the
drinking match, or not to pledge the drunken-health, is an abjuring of
friendship, want of breeding, and ground enough for a quarrel.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian had rather be disgraced for the evil he does,
than that sin, for his sake, should be commended.

He does what good he can, not for commendation, but for goodness sake, and
out of duty. And if any praise do light upon him, it is as Saul's armor, too
heavy for him, be it never so light. And this he will be sure of, it shall be
another that praises him, not his own lips Prove. 27.2.
: for that which is truly good, not for palliated or disguised evil. He will
not be spared for what he should be smitten, but rather call for strokes Pral.
141.5.
, which he accounts a greater kindness than a flattering applause: He
knows a woe waits for them that call evil good Isa. 5.20.
; and for them that justify the wicked for reward, as all flatterers do.

As that noble Patriot was willing to have the public enemy slain, though the
sword made way through his own body; so, the faithful Christian is contented by
his own wounds and reproach to have sin discredited, rather than it should be
matter of commendation unto him under any false name or specious title
whatsoever. And where he has failed and given scandal, none shall be so
forward to put him to shame as himself; imitating herein fallen- David, who
propounds and records himself a public and perpetual pattern to the
Church, of serious and thorough repentance Psalm. 51.
. He should never forgive himself if he should accept or suffer commendations
for evil doing, which is the great quarrel of God with the Devil and the world.
If any favor be to be showed upon a fall, he reserveth it for another man's
case, but will not admit of it in his own.

Thus, this hypocrite is more for commendation, than for deserving it; the true
Christian is more for desert than for praise: the one by seeking it, exalts
sin; the other by declining it, brings honor to God.

This Hypocrite will have commendation, though God has no share with

He that is commended for evil, is commended not only without God, but against
him. Such praise is Gods dishonor. It is a disparaging and despising of the
judgment of God to maintain the credit of that which God despises. But say,
that he seeks praise for that which is not evil, yet the seeking of praise
for good is evil; to search for a man's own glory, is not glory Prove. 25.27
: and he is an enemy to God, that will not spare the honor from himself unto
God.

This hypocrite so he may be praised for what he has done, never looks to
advance God for enabling him to do it. He considers what he has; not, whence
he received it. Nay, he rather attributes all to himself, than is willing to
acknowledge any receipt at all. It is the first point of folly for a man to fall
in love with himself, and the next is to applaud that which himself thinks so
well of: but the greatest folly of all, is to take no notice of him by whom he
is what he is. Jehu must be commended for his zeal, but he never thanketh God
for his advancement. The Pharisee commends himself for his just dealing in
paying tithes of all that he possesses, but he never thanks God for his
bounty, in giving him wherewith to pay tithes. Let him have his due, and then
let God shift for his own as he can.

On the contrary, the true Christian takes care of Gods honor, Differ.
whatever become of his own.

He will never let his light shine, but so, that they who see it may glorify
his Father which is in Heaven Mat. 5.16
. He is careful to show forth the virtues (and praises) of him that has called
him out of darkness into his mavelous light 1 Pet. 2.9
. He never sets forth Gods wares, but he writes Gods Name upon it, and returns
him the profit of all the talents he has received. Lord, says he, thy pound
has gained ten pounds Luke 19.16
. It is Gods pound, not his, and therefore the gain shall be Gods too, not his
who was but a servant entrusted by God and for God.

If he has been able to do God, or his Church any service, he cries out, Not
unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory, for thy mercy, and
for thy truths sake Psalm. 115.1
: for his mercy that enabled him: and, for his truths sake that gives success
to that ability according to promise. All the glory he seeks for himself, is
from God, at the last, when he has done all his work, after patient
continuance in well-doing, when he is to receive eternal life Romans 2.7.
. For herein he has Christ for his pattern, who never prayed to be glorified,
until he was able to say to his Father, I have glorified thee on earth, I have
finished the work which thou have given me to do John 17.1, 4
: What he receives from good men, he puts to Gods account, not his own:
blessing God for his grace, not himself for deserving it: and so do they also
who do commend him, they glorify God in him Gal. 1.24
.

If he receive any commendation from evil men (who are rather convinced than
contented) he makes use of it to justify God and his grace, not to lift up
himself: By the grace of God, I am that I am. He will take praise from any,
rather than from self. Nor will he take it from any, but for well-doing only.
If virtue and praise meet together, he will rather take both, than be without
the virtue. He seeks virtue as praiseworthy, and praise no otherwise than as
the fruit and companion of virtue.

Thus, this hypocrite is like the Cuckoe, always singing his own name,
choosing praise, rather than virtue; the true Christian is like the
Nightingale, always chaunting out the praise of God, in variety of notes, and
had rather have virtue without praise, than praise without virtue: the one
seeks to be well reported of, even for evil, rather than want commendation;
the other had rather be ill reported of for good, than not do it; and, to
deserve praise and want it, than to have it without desert.

This hypocrite if he can hide his sins from men, he thinks all is well.

It is his great care to hide sin, rather than not to commit it: to hide it
from men; for God is not in all his thoughts Psalm. 10.4
, as supposing that he looks on when the door is locked and bolted, and the
Curtains drawn. As the Adulteress, eats and wipeth her mouth, and says I
have done no wickedness Prove. 30.20
; so this hypocrite, so long as he can carry things closely and subtly, he
will stand much upon his innocence: making a goodly show, as if he fed upon no
such meat as sin; look upon his mouth, and that is so clean wiped, that you
cannot discern the least crumb of wickedness about him, nor the least ground
of suspicion. Look upon his outward behavior, and it is as count, and comely,
as if here the purest creature in the world. And this, to him, is so
well-pleasing, that he never thinks there is any need of repentance Luke 15.7
.

This he expects should pass current for innocence; although sometimes the
hiding of sin makes it more conspicuous, as Alexander, in the drawing of his
picture, seeking to hide his skar in his face, by being pictured with his
finger upon the skar, made it to be more observed. So this hypocrite is often
served, especially when he seeks to hide his sin from God, for then, God
assures him, he shall not prosper Prove. 28.13
. Sin hidden is more sinful, and in the issue (if not confessed and forsaken)
more shameful. For, as Diogenes said to the young man, who being seen coming
forth of a Tavern, ran in again, to hide himself, Quanto magis fugias intro,
tanto magis eris in caupona, by how much the further thou fliest back, by so
much further in thou art in the Tavern, whereof thou art ashamed: the same may
be said to this hypocrite, the more thou hidest sin, the greater the guilt,
because the greater engagement to defend it, and the more thou ingulfest thy
self in the reproach and danger of it: and when all is done, his sin will be
sure to find him out Numb. 32.23
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian counts Gods eye more than all the world;
and, hiding of sin to be the worst of sin.

If you can tell him, whither he may go from Gods Presence (which he would not,
if he could, forsake) that God may neither see nor know what he does, you may
then have some color to draw him to evil by this argument. No body sees it,
nor can discover it. But he is better taught, than to be so deluded. He knows
that neither heaven, hell, the uttermost parts of the sea, yea, darkness it
self cannot hide from God Psalm. 139.8, etc. 12
. Therefore, though men may be blinded that they cannot see, or terrified that
they dare not say what they see, that satisfies not a child of God.

He dares not to cover his transgressions, as Adam, by hiding his iniquity in
his bosom Job 31.33
; but comes forth of all his starting and lurking holes, and ingenuously
confesses unto God, Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil
in thy sight Psalm. 51.4
. He dares not but confess it, even when none else dare to call him to
confession, and though he had no cause to fear man, but could have made afraid
a great multitude. He considers that there is a day coming, wherein all men
shall know all things, though never so secret, which God himself covers not,
upon man's repentance, by forgiveness. Therefore he confesses his sins, that
God may wipe them out with the sponge of mercy Prove. 28.13
, before he be brought to open shame before all the world. And as for sins
known to men, he blotteth out the shame of them by confession and sorrow even
before men, making his repentance as notorious and exemplary as his fall, and
the scandal given by it.

Thus, this hypocrite in stead of parting with sin, sits upon it, as Rachel did
upon her fathers idols, on purpose to keep them with her Genesis 31.34
: the true Christian, if he have secretly sinned, it is like a broken vein
within his body, which he dares not conceal, lest it cost him his life: the one
thinks to thrive by hiding, and so perishes; the other knows there is no way
to rise again after a fall, but to make a full discovery of what the hypocrite
covers.

This hypocrite excuses and extenuateth what he cannot hide.

This is the Apologetical hypocrite that makes use of his knowledge of the Word
of God, not to avoid sin, but to defend it. If you charge him with some gross
sin committed, and he cannot deny it; his answer is out of Scripture, there is
no man that sins not 1 King. 8.46
: and, in many things we offend all Jam. 3.2
. It is my infirmity, says he, God knows my heart, I strive against it: it
may be so, when it comes to be known, and he has the shame of it; but, never
before. The best, says he, have their faults; David, Peter, Moses, etc. had
all, their great failings, and who lives without?

But all this while, he does not, as they did, give testimony of any
repentance, but lives in a course and custom of evil still: vouching them for
patterns of sin, as if they had sinned to be Patrons of evil; but never
imitateth them, as patterns of repentance, because he has not enough of his
wickedness. And though this be replied to his answer, yet then he rejoyneth;
O, but this is but a little one (as Lot said of Zoar Genesis 19.20
); and his soul cannot live without it. He is in this point a direct Papist;
for, all his sins are venial, but peccadillo's, and inconsiderable slips, if
you will believe him.

But, as she is never chaste that is always fending and proving her chastity;
nor he good, that is always in purging: so this hypocrite by his frequent
discourses in the defense of some sins, (although not directly, but in a
cunning and oblique way,) or in the extenuation or excuse of other evils in
himself or others, bewrays not only his secret love to those sins, but his
guiltiness of them. No man will plead in the least for what he truly hates.
His pleading argues his love, and his love his guilt: for no man can love sin,
but he is guilty of it. Some of his Consorts are grown so cunning this way,
that, rather than not show their wit in patronizing of sin, they counterfeit
libels against themselves to the end they may write Apologies for themselves,
or rather for those sins which they love too well: that so, if they be found
guilty, they may (as they hope) not be so hardly thought of, or harshly
censured, as some have been.

Contrarily, the true Christian is so far from defending or extenuating sin,
Differ.
that he abhors and aggravates it.

He cannot defend sin that abhors evil. No reigning unmortified lust shall
find favor in his eyes, that is hated in his heart. He loathes that very
Religion that makes sin less odious, and takes part with the devil against
the Word of God. Mincing of sin is in his account but a dressing of it more
handsomely, to make it look more like an harlot, that it may entice the more.
He will hide nothing in his heart, unless the Word of God, that will be sure
to expel all sin that is there, and refuse to give entrance to more. He ever
looks upon an Apologizer for sin, as a Pandor to it: and abhors the bringing of
pillowes, where an axe, or halter is fitter.

The Law affords no Advocates for Malefactors and Traitors against the King:
no more will the Christian, unto sin, against God. He says to any man pleading
for sin, as Joash did of Baal, when too many pleaded for him, and resolved to
put Gideon to death for destroying his Altar; Will ye plead for Baal? will ye
save him? He that pleads for him, let him be put to death while it is yet
morning: if he be a God, let him plead for himself against him that has cast
down his Altar Judge 6.31
: if any man be so wicked as to patronize sin, let him die (by his consent) to
day before to morrow.

Thus, this hypocrite in stead of abandoning sin, or giving sentence against
it, becomes her Advocate; the true Christian looks upon the least sin as having
a devil in it, which he will rather perish, than maintain: the one, thinks of
no more but extenuating that which he will not relinquish: the other aggravates
the more, that he may make more haste to cashier it.

This hypocrite compares himself with himself.

He takes the height of his own goodness by his own instrument, how imperfect
soever. He measures himself by his own opinion and humor. If he come up to
his own Rule. Oh! says he, I do very well, I am excellent. If he reflect upon
himself and ways in former times, and finds himself so far altered, as from
open profaneness to take up the Profession of Religion, from going to a Play,
to go to a Sermon; from haunting Alehouses, to frequent the House of God, from
abusing the Name of God, to have his Name more often in his mouth, in his
prayers and discourse in a more religious way, he now takes himself to be so
complete a Reformado, although his heart run all the while after his
covetousness as much as ever before, even when with his mouth he shows much
love Ezekiel. 33.31
. He is wise in his own eyes, and prudent in his own sight Isa. 5.21
; self-love sees nothing amiss, but all excellent: he needs no repentance,
no supply, because he measures himself by himself, and compares himself with
himself, which in the judgment of the wisdom of God, is not wisely done 2 Cor.
10.12
. The way of a fool is right in his own eyes Prove. 12.51
. And wherever you see a man wise in his own conceit, There is more hope of a
fool than of him Prove. 26.12
. But, be it so: he is of another opinion, and so means to continue, though you
should bray him in a mortar among wheat with a pestel Chap. 27.22
.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the true Christian takes measure of himself by the Standard of the Word.

He knows that God has commanded him to do no unrighteousness in judgment,
in meet-yard, in weight, or in measure Lev. 19 35
; and, that the scant measure is abominable Mic 6.10
. Therefore, as he will always have a perfect and just measure Deuteronomy. 25.15
, so more especially in the measuring of himself. As in dealing between man and
man there must be a common measure to proceed by; and, when a man reckons his
private estate, he must value things by the common estimate, or else he shall
deceive himself; so it is in this case of spiritual judgment. Though every man
must be his own Judge, yet no man must judge by his own Law. But there is one
common rule and measure, the Word of God, by which not only men's persons and
actions, but even their judgments of themselves shall be judged.

Therefore he will not, he dares not, be of those who compare themselves
amongst themselves, or with those that commend themselves 2 Cor. 10.12
. All comparisons argue a desire to be preferred above others, which must needs
savor of pride, that becomes not a child of God, who, the better he knows
himself, the more cause he finds to be abased in himself, and not to enter
into comparison, unless with sinners, of whom he accounts himself to be the
chief 1 Timothy 1.15
.

Thus, this hypocrite turns every stone to advance himself in his own eyes;
the true Christian takes as much care how to be vile in his own eyes, and to
put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope Lam. 3.29
: the one looks in a glass of his own making as willing to deceive himself;
the other beholds himself as in the Mirror of God, that he may have a true
view of himself.

This hypocrite esteems highly of himself for those things which he
sleighteth in others.

Of another man he can say, I commend him not for his Parentage and pedigree,
for his wealth, place, and honor, but for his virtue. Yet in his own case, all
these are reckoned as so many pinacles for him to stand many degrees higher
than others. He prizeth himself, (and is so foolish as to think others should
do so too) according to his birth and means, without relation to Piety Psalm.
49.18
. He may perhaps offer place to others, that they may set him higher: but, if
the other do not so understand him, he takes it in very great indignation. For
there is no hypocrite, but (as Moab) is exceeding proud, and thinks no man
gives him his full due.

Yea, his preheminences in these things must bear out his vices, and make them
honorable. He thinks it is no fault in him, but rather a commendation to insult
over his poor brethren in such a masterly and rude way, as he himself could not
bear, because though they be all Professors, yet he is a Gentleman, which they
be not, therefore he may make bold, and they must take it for a favor that he
will do so. To call a poor Christian dolt and fool, he thinks, becomes his
Gentility and his place, which he would not endure in another. For him to be
proud, haughty, vain, is no fault, but excellency of spirit, especially if he
seem religious. He is of Jehoiakims temper, that thinks he must needs reign
because he closes himself in Cedar, and bears an higher port than Josiah his
father, and was more sumptuous and magnificent in his buildings. To whom God
spoke with indignation, Did not thy father eat, and drink, and do justice, and
then it was well with him Jer. 22.15
.

If he epsy another to be highly commended for his gifts and parts of
learning, wit, eloquence, elocution, etc. in preaching, discourse, prayer, all
these are nothing in another, because, (as he pretends, and sometimes it
falls out so) that these things may be without saving grace: but any one of
these in himself is enough to lift him above others far more gracious: and he
must be applauded and magnified for this, whether he have grace or not:
boasting of things without his measure 2 Cor. 10.15
.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian regards those things little in any, but
least in himself.

He knows that a prudent heathen will not stand upon genus, and proavos, and
quae non fecerit ipse, Stock, Ancestors, and Acts of others, how nearly soever
related to him, much less does it become a Christian. It is true that it is an
honor which God vouchsafes to some; not to make them proud and to insist upon
their greatness of blood; but, for the common good: and where so it proves, it
makes wisdom it self to pronounce, Blessed art thou, O Land, when thy King is
the son of Nobles 2 Cor. 10.17
. Therefore he despises not, but honors Nobility: but, with this difference
from the hypocrite: that where grace and Nobility meet he ever prizeth that
before this, especially in himself; and emproves it to do good, not to show
himself great: and in himself he sets a far lower value upon it, than he does
upon less in another.

As for wit and parts, he prizeth them in others; but, is rather afraid than
proud of them (as Austin was of the pregnant wit in his natural son) in
himself. He finds them baits to tempt others to esteem him more for these
things, than for true grace; and, snares, to lift him with pride, and so to
endanger him to fall into the condemnation of the devil 1 Timothy 3.6
. He is therefore afraid of these things as of a young metled horse which is
more apt to throw, than to carry him. He will not stand upon his place, but
yield to right even when his servant contendeth with him Job 31.13
. He observes herein the Philosophers rule, Cum laudare vis, vide quid
praeciperes: Cum praecipere vis, vide quid laudares Rhet. l. 1. c. 9
. When thou will praise a thing, consider first what thou would give in
command: when thou would command a thing, think first what thou would
commend. He will not praise that which he dares not command; nor enjoyne that
which he would not praise. For well he understands that all true praise
consists in obeying just precepts, and the obeying of just precepts is matter
of true praise. To be rich, noble, strong, fair, witty, is no matter of
precept; therefore in and of themselves, without grace to sanctify them, no
matter of praise.

Thus, this hypocrite would make any thing matter of commendation and honor in
himself, without virtue: the true Christian accounts all things but loss for
the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord, -- and count them but
dung that he may win Christ Phil. 3.8
: The one is so mad upon praise, that he would rather take it out in things
which in his own judgment are not praiseworthy in others, than go without it:
the other is so indifferent, that he is content to go without praise for those
things in himself, which he cannot but commend in others.

This hypocrite compares himself with others like himself.

He likes not to be laid in the balance with a sound-hearted complete
Christian; but, if he can epsy any, noted or suspected of hypocrisy, he (who
knows what it is to halt before a Cripple) will soon spy out faults enough in
his fellow-hypocrite, thereby to prove himself the better Christian, when yet
there is not a pin to choose. Judas and the Priests were well met, they thought
to cozen one another, and so were both out-shot in their own bows. Judas
thought to cozen them of so much money, without danger to himself, or to
Christ, who, he knew, was well enough able to keep out of their clutches. The
Priests thought to cozen Judas, when they knew they had now matter against him
to cast it in the teeth of his Master for keeping such a servant about him.
Christ being apprehended, Judas was cozened; for himself was suddenly
apprehended too, by his own conscience which cost him his life. And the Priests
were cozened: for they lost by the bargain, when once they discerned that he
was risen from the dead; the issue whereof was their own destruction.

Now, for these to compare one with another, would be a more pleasing task,
than to compare with Christ whom they crucified, or with the rest of the
Apostles that continued faithful: here would be work enough for either, to
compare hypocrite with hypocrite: not which was the better, for there was never
a good: but, which was the worse, both being so bad. And indeed the highest
praise an hypocrite can aspire unto is, to be commended for this, that he is
not all out so bad as some of his fellows.

Well therefore spoke Christ to the generation of hypocrites that opposed him,
Fill ye up the measure of your fathers Mat. 23.32
. They and their fathers (though they could not be said to be well met, because
one generation passed, before another came; yet) did well agree: only in this
they differed; that whereas the present generation (as bad as any of the
former) comparing themselves with their fathers, passed Judgment for
themselves, and concluded that they would never have done what their fathers
did Ver. 30
; yet, did much worse, by how much the killing of the heir was worse, than the
killing of the servants Mat. 21.38
.

In point of Religion, he thinks himself safe enough, if he be of his fathers
and Grandfathers Religion, although Papists. That he may justify any thing, if
he do no more, but what his neighbors and those of his own rank do. And thus
he thinks he has abundantly quitted himself of blame, when he can make it
appear that he has done no more than others of his Profession and rank have
done before him. Indeed this might serve, if he that runs with a thief Psalm.
50.18
, might be judged by his companion, which in the issue he will not find. He is
in this case, of his mind in another, Cum Authore magno desipere, pene est
sapere, to dote with a great Scholar is little less than wisdom with some men,
especially with the hypocrite, who has men's persons in admiration for
advantage sake Jude 16
.

Or if he compare himself with others, it is with them that be worse, at least
in his account, I am not as this Publican. Tell him of his foolish and idle
discourse, he answers, God grant that you and I do no worse; tell him of
haunting idle company, he replies, better to do so than as such and such, to go
to the dicing-house, or to a playhouse. If you reprove him for mixed dancing,
as inciting to lust; better do so, says he, than such, to be naught in a
corner. Such is the logic of sin, relying on that goodly maxim, You must not
find fault with him, than whom there may be found a worse. He thinks it grace
enough to be, not all out so bad as some others.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian compares himself with those that go beyond him
in grace.

He that intends by a comparison, the lifting up of himself, will look out
some that are below him. But the Christian that aims by a comparison to
quicken himself to be, and do better, will be sure to find out some more
eminent that may be a fit copy for him to write after, and a good spur to
make him mend his pace.

He that will know what an one himself is, must look upon them who are what he
is not. They are best examples that show most disparity, and give occasion of
the truest judgment. Therefore he looks not only on the cloud of Witnesses,
the holy Patriarchs, but also upon the Lord Jesus, the Author and Finisher, as
well as pattern, of his faith Heb. 12.1, 2
, that he may see how far short he comes, not in suffering only, but also in
obedience. He considers that, that man is as had as the worst, whom nothing
but evil can keep from doing worse. Therefore he contenteth not himself that
some do worse, but striveth himself to be, and do as good as the best, and to
be better, because others are worse.

He knows that all measuring is, from the mark, or pin, not from his own
scantling although a good Archer: Little can a man's outside (for who can see
more?) help him to know his own inside, but with respect to the mark. Thereby,
he knows how much nearer he is come to it than some others; or rather than
himself heretofore, in the times of his ignorance 1 Cor. 6.11 Romans 6.17
, or in the beginning of his Conversion Romans 13.11
.

Thus, this hypocrite abounds in comparisons which are odious, to cheat
himself, by setting others by him which are, in his conceit, worse: the true
Christian compares himself with his betters, to abase himself by seeing how far
short he comes of them. The one makes use of comparisons as a foil; the other,
as a Copy. All that the one aims at, is to show that he is no worse than
others: but the other, by comparing with others, intends his own bettering.

This hypocrite, if he compare with those that are good, he will be sure to
give himself the advantage.

As he sometimes thrusts himself among good company, to gain a name, not to
better his conscience or carriage, so he will not deny another to be good, so
he may be accounted better, or at least as good. He is like the Captains of
Greece who reported upon Oath, every man himself to have done best, and
Themistocles next. He will be content with Hanibal to confess Scipio a good
Commander next to himself. He is a right good Christian whom this hypocrite
puts next beneath himself.

In praising others above himself, whom he compares with himself, he seeks
his own praise: either for his judgment, to be able to judge what is truly
praiseworthy, and to see so far into another man's goodness: or, for his
equity, in being so ready to give every man his due, although with lessening
himself: and, it may be, it falls out to be such an one as deals not so well
with him: or, in hope that he shall have the same measure returned, and receive
back his praises with interest.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the true Christian always sees something wherein every one truly good, goes
beyond him.

He cannot be so flattered by others, as not to see more evil in himself than
they see good. Nor can he be so blinded with conceit of his own worth, as not
to see somewhat better in the meanest Christian, than he can find in himself.
I have not, says he, so much patience, so much meekness, so much humility, so
much affection, temperance, wisdom, constancy, etc. as I see in him. He that is
thought by others to come far behind me, I find to be far before me. I
may well go to school to him to learn that which I should rather he able to
teach him.

Therefore, as the Table of gold, being to be given to the wisest, was, by the
Fishermen, sent to Thales; by him, to Bias; by him, to Solon; and, by Solon, to
Apollo at Delphos: so commendation and pre-eminence for grace, when it is to be
bestowed upon the best Christian, it is posted from one of them to another,
till at length it rests upon Christ alone. For, if the best Christian be able
to do any thing, it is through Christ that strengthens him Phil 4.13
. If he be in any measure made wise unto salvation by the Ministry of the
Word, Who is Paul, and who is Apollo? but Ministers of Christ by whom he
believes, even as the Lord gave to every man, to edify him 1 Cor. 3, 4
. Therefore, to Christ all praise is most due, and he shall have it.

Thus, this hypocrite sets a dim and small light by his own torch, that the
brightness of his light may appear the better. The true Christian brings his
small candle to the largest torch, that he may light it at another man's fire,
and receive benefit of both: the one is all for the Admiral-light, to go before
others; it is enough to the other, if he follow in the Rere, and receive from
others what is wanting of his own.

This hypocrite judges himself by what others that flatter him say of

If they speak nothing but truth of him, he will not be tried by such a Jury:
but, if they will give a verdict for him, he gives judgment accordingly, be
the verdict never so contrary to clear evidence. What they say, is his oracle.
And rather indeed what they say, than what they think: for it is easier to
extort their good word, than their good opinion. They may sooner be scared, or
bribed to speak, than persuaded to think, what they speak, because, if they
know him, they cannot think as they speak, if they speak for him.

And the hypocrite can better abide to be ill thought of, than to be ill spoken
of: and yet, to be ill spoken of, rather than to be ill spoken to. Of all words
he hates most the word of reproof: and, of all reproofs, the most true and
just. Therefore he likes the judgment of them that look aloof off, not of
them that come so near. And he comes too near, that sees him as he is: for he
sees his wrinkles and freckles, which the other sees not. Their judgment
therefore he best approves, that best approve him; and he follows that
plausible rule whereby some deceive others; but, this man, himself (...). I am
commended, therefore I am good.

On the contrary, the true Christian enquireth what men think, Differ.
rather than what they speak.

Some hate, and therefore speak evil. But are they ashamed when they so speak?
then, says the Christian, may I be comforted, when I find them ashamed that
falsely accuse my conversation in Christ 1 Pet. 3.16
. Howsoever, he can make this profit of an enemy, thereby to be admonished to
walk more exactly and accurately Ephesians. 5.15
. Some love, and therefore speak well: their affection is to be embraced; but,
their judgment, to be suspected. Most men feign to like, that they may seem to
love. These are of others most dangerous, as in whom neither judgment, nor
affection is sound. Thus, he finds it unsafe to sail by any of these living
breaths.

A Christian therefore, observing how the living judge the dead, and how the
dead speak to the living, without either envy or flattery; he looks into
Histories, the best rule of humane judgment; therein, not one, but many do
come from the dead to advise the living. And, in the reading of them, a wise
man may as it were stand behind the door, and observe what the world will say
of him, when his back is turned. Thus, he reads Histories and Tragedies, that
he may not become a Tragedy. A fit recreation for great men, especially at
vacant hours at least; who, while each of them lives, and blesses his soul
when he hears the false praises of men Psalm. 49.18
, few will say to him, thou art wicked, an oppressor, etc. but, when he is once
gone to the generation of his fathers, and become like the beasts that perish
Ver. 20
; many will say it of him, and some will not fear to write it too, with the
same liberty which the other took in sinning while he lived.

Thus, this hypocrite strives to live rather upon the air, and false melody of
base flattery, than to be weighed in a true balance, wherein he knows he
should be found too light Dan. 5.25
, The Christian is never at rest, until he have a true and full sense of
unbiassed and impartial wise men, who know him intus and in cute, within and
without, what they judge of him; the one rests on vain words and is
deceived; the other, on sound judgment, and is instructed.

This hypocrite loves to behold himself in any glass, rather than in that of
conscience.

If he be reproved for ay evil; and, appeal be made by the reprover, to his own
conscience: ask your own conscience, if this be not so, if this be warrantable,
and becoming your Profession? etc. He presently replieth, What has any man to
do with my conscience? my conscience and I agree well enough, whatever you
please to think or say. Other men, as good and wise as you, speak otherwise of
me and of my carriage: and so long as they approve of me, I value not your
censure. You may enjoy your opinion, and I will hold mine. Miserable man, that
must have other men's good words (that know him only at a distance) to bear him
out against his own heart.

He dares not to put himself upon the trial of his own conscience, (if he has
not before blinded or corrupted it,) for he knows beforehand, the verdict
thereof will not please him. He will be tried before a more merciful Judge, and
by a more pliable Jury, and will choose his own witnesses, even some eminent
Christians, and perhaps some Ministers of note, upon whom he has fawned for
their good word, and even bribed by many a meals meat, and outward
countenance, to conceive a charitable opinion of him, and to cry him up for a
good man, or at least for a man of whom they have good hopes. Which shows in
himself a conscience of little worth, and that he has little confidence in his
own conscience.

Howbeit, he finds by experience that he can sooner corrupt other men's
opinions, and charm their tongues, than his own conscience, as bad as it is:
and happily by other men's tongues he may at length corrupt his own heart to be of
the same opinion with them, touching his own goodness. For, however in matter
of health, wealth, and other outward things, he had rather be healthy, wealthy,
happy, than only seem so: yet, in the matter of goodness, (to which he has no
just title, nor heart) he has more mind to seem good, to save his credit;
than to be so, to part with his lust. Therefore he will spare no cost to
purchase the opinion of goodness, that so he may more securely go on in
wickedness.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian advises with God in his own conscience.

When he has to do with God, in the matter of his peace, he will not advise
with men what they say or think: but, he will hearken to hear what God the Lord
will say Psalm. 85.8
unto him: and, upon that he rests, whoever shall speak to the contrary. Upon
this he is bold to challenge men and devils, to lay what they can to his
charge. It is God that justifies, says he, who is he that condemns Romans
8.33, 34
? Yea, if his own heart or conscience condemn him when Christ his Judge has
acquitted him, this dismayeth him not, because God is greater than his heart,
and knows all things 1 John. 3.20
; and, particularly, that herein, his heart is mistaken.

If he be to deal with men that ignorantly mistake him, or maliciously traduce
him, he can appeal to Christ, and to his own conscience for the truth of what
he speaks touching himself, I say the truth in Christ, I lie not; my
conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, etc Romans 9.1
. He cannot be deceived in himself, that has his conscience for a thousand
witnesses that will not lie; and, if that be not enough, has the Lord himself
also, for more than ten thousand. His heart renewed and made vigilant, is
better to him, and tells him more than seven Watchmen that sit above in an
high Tower Ecclus. 37.14
. There, he sets up a Consistory for Christ, and furnishes all things
requisite to true judgment. For conscience is but the Juror that must have Law
from the chief Judge, and evidence from the memory: but, being well instructed,
will be sure to give in a true verdict. Therefore, he uses all other helps and
opinions of other men, as Commentaries only, to understand the Rolls of his own
conscience the better. But, as they that dig in mines must bring light from
above, so he will be careful whence they have their light, that comment on the
dark corners of his conscience.

Thus, this hypocrite is like some unhandsom piece that is more curious than
ordinary in choosing out a special good Looking-glass; but, will be sure to
pitch only upon that which shows her the best face: the true Christian chooses
none, but that which is best able, without flattery, to represent him as he is.
The one advises with conscience, as Ahab with Micaiah, to please others that
press it; the other consulteth it, as Jehoshaphat did the same Prophet 1 King.
22.8, 9
, to satisfy himself that desires it.

CHAP. XXXV. The Libertine Hypocrite Is he, who thinks he may use the Liberty
of the Gospel, Defin.
as he list.
EIther he takes liberty beside the Rule; or, sets up a Rule of his own, that
gives him false liberty, or puts him under a false yoke. By both which, he
makes his good, or commodity, to be evil spoken of; yea, blasphemed Romans 14.16
. Christian-liberty is such a good, as becomes an evil to them that abuse it,
either by over, or indiscreet using of it; or, by taking offense at the lawful
use of so great a benefit. Sometimes the same hypocrite runs into both
extremes. But usually he begins with the last, abridging or denying himself the
due use of the liberty purchased by Christ; and, this over-strictnesse becomes
a snare unto him: for, ere long, he will find a necessity of transgressing his
own Rule, which when he has done, he soon steps over to the other extreme, and
now, holds all things lawful; yea, even the using of his liberty, as an
occasion to the flesh Gal. 6.13
.

Sometimes, he keeps to one extreme, which commonly is that of excess; and
therein so far exceeds, as if Christianity lay more in taking such liberty,
than in doing of duty; yea, holding the use of his liberty the greatest duty,
and the most distinguishing character of a true Christian from a legal
Professor. He holds himself herein so free, that he is not accountable either
to God or man for his use of, or behavior in things that are in their own
nature, or in his apprehension, indifferent. As if God allowed his servants a
Saturnalian feast A Feast observed in December. for five, or seven days by the
ancient Romans; in the room whereof, some belly-gods keep their Christmas
; wherein the Masters were to serve, and the servants to sit at Table, in which
he will take no account of their carriage; but has discharged them upon the
account of Christ.

By which means he is as loose in his way, as profane men are in theirs, who
keep the feast of Christ's Nativity with riot, gaming, cheating, and all manner
of heathenish behavior, as if the devil were incarnate, rather than the Son of
God: or, as they who turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness Jude 4
, in the general course of their lives, not coming short of very heathens in
lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and all
abominable wickedness 1 Pet. 4.3
. As if Christ himself had paid so dear for liberty, merely to purchase a
license to sin, to abuse his creatures, and our selves, and to set our Lord
himself at naught.

Perhaps he is for the other extremity, and thinks nothing lawful in point of
meats, drinks, days, etc. to a Christian, that was not so to the Jew: or, he
lays other restraints upon himself, which God never laid upon the Jews
themselves; as, the forbearing of marriage and vowing of single life, the
vowing of wilful or voluntary poverty, the denial of their own understanding,
reason, conscience, to obey blindly what, not God, but others command, even
contrary unto God, and many other things of like nature. Wherein the hypocrite
aims at a greater perfection than others do or can attain; and, to please God
better, than ever he himself directed him to do: and yet, in all these,
pleases him less then they who lay no such yokes upon their own necks: and,
receive no better entertainment or reward from him, than a Quis requisivit? Who
has required these things at your hands Isa. 1.12
?

Not that all are hypocrites who are fearful to use their Christian-liberty in
meats, and days, and other things of like nature: but he is the hypocrite who
pretending these restraints to be laid on him by God, does yet not observe them
out of conscience; but, to gain reputation from men, for his extraordinary
strictness and denial of himself: and to make the observation of these smaller
things, a cover and a cloak for his breach of such as are Commandments of God
indeed: hoping, that all men will take him to be a very exact Christian that is
so severe to himself beyond other men in things of the least concernment.

Differ.
On the contrary, the Christian accounts the true use of Christian-liberty, a
great part of Christian-duty.

He knows that Christ would not take this into the Covenant between God and
him, for the purchase of it with his blood, but that it was worth the
purchasing: and that, Christ having bought it, it is all the reason in the world
his members should enjoy it as a privilege, and use it in their course as a
duty incumbent, both by way of thankfulness to Christ that has freed them
from that unsupportable yoke, which formerly lay so heavy upon the people of
God under the Old Testament, that neither the fathers, nor their children, were
able to bear it Acts 15.10
: as also, by way of rule, in all their use of things now made indifferent.

And indeed, there is nothing whereof a Christian, in his conversing with
Christians, (that may perhaps differ from him in judgment, or practice, or in
both) about matters of this kind, is more careful; that he may reach to the
true use of that liberty, and not exceed it. Nothing is of so great worth and
weight in Christian conversation, (next to adorning the Gospel by a holy and
devout life) as the wise and charitable demeaning of himself in the use of
Christian-liberty, that he neither over-use, nor refuse the liberty allowed him
of God: that he neither give offense, nor take offense without ground. It is a
commodity indeed; but, like a venice-glasse, easily broken; therefore he is
very chary and vigilant in the using of it. He considers that though grace
has made him free, and called him unto liberty, yet the same grace has laid
upon him a law of love, and made him a servant both to God and man: therefore
he will not use his liberty for an occasion to the flesh; but, by love, serve
those among whom Providence has cast his lot.

Thus, this hypocrite is a very jugler that pretends skill to make what use he
list, of any thing he takes in hand: the true Christian, having found a price
put into his hand by Christ, is careful to improve it to the best advantage of
others as well as of himself. The one, by liberty, grows lawless, or
superstitious; the other, freely becomes the servant of God 1 Pet. 2.16
, and of his brethren Gal. 5.13
.

This hypocrite will have liberty without law.

Liberty is no liberty with him, unless it be lawless. If liberty, no law; if
law, no liberty, says this Libertine. Hereby he becomes a son of Belial,
because Belignal, without yoke. He professes Christ, but under this pretext,
he fights against Christ, like the Kings of the earth, that resolve to break
the bands of Christ asunder, and to cast away his cords from them Psalm. 2.3
. He is willing enough to be beholding to Christ for liberty, but he will not
take it upon Christ's terms. He makes Christian-liberty and lawless
Libertinisme to be the same thing. If not, give him this, and away with that:
for he is altogether for breaking the yoke, and bursting the bonds Jer, 5.5
.

All wicked men are sons of Belial by nature: but this hypocrite is such by Art
and nature too. He can plead liberty against law and grace too, and freedom
against obedience. He can promise and preach liberty to others, being still
himself the servant of corruption 2 Pet. 2.19
. He talks much of his Christ (for his carnal advantage;) but it is of his
ease, not of his yoke: and, of the Spirit that gives liberty 2 Cor. 3.17
, but not of the Law of the Spirit Romans 8.2
. He boasts that he is under grace; but he means that he is under the
shelter, not under the command; under the protection of grace, not under the
precept of obedience.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian looks upon his liberty as regulated and limited by the
Law of liberty.

It is a Law; but, of liberty Jam. 2.12
, so taking away the rigor. It is a Liberty; but, with Law, to take away
looseness. Law, and Liberty may agree: but liberty and looseness in a
Christian, cannot consist Romans 6.1, 2
. Liberty takes away rigor from the Law; and Law takes away looseness from
Liberty Gal. 5.13
. He is free, not from obedience, but in, and to obedience Psalm. 119.32
; in obedience, without fear of the curse Gal 3.10, 11
; and, to obedience, without the shackles of corruption Romans 6.22
: and both by Christ Gal. 3.13
. He is not free from service, but a free servant, the Lords freeman, even when
a servant of man: and the Lords servant, even when under no engagement to, but
free from man 1 Cor. 7.22
.

While clogged with corruption, he could not so much as go in Gods way; but
being enlarged from that bondage, he runs the way of Gods Commandments; he does
run, not away from them, nor run out of the way; but, in the way, making
straight paths for his feet Heb. 12.13
. For this end, he beggeth of God his free Spirit Psalm. 51.12
, not to let him loose, that he may run wild, but to establish him in
obedience Psalm. 40.2
. Christ brings him freedom from the Law; but, he looks on Christ in the
Law, and on the Law in Christ. On Christ, in the Law, unto Justification: for
seeing nothing but rigor in the Law it self, he looks to Christ satisfying,
and meriting on his behalf. In like manner, he looks on the Law in Christ,
unto sanctification, that he may learn to abhor that sin which crucified his
Savior; and, to walk as he has walked 1 John 2.6.
.

He is never without yoke. He was under the yoke of sin, and felt it not,
though so heavy as would have crush't him down to the nethermost hell, had not
Christ taken it off. But now, he has changed that heavy yoke for the easy
yoke of Christ, which is, willing obedience Psalm. 110.3.
; and, finds not the Commandment grievous 1 John 5.3.
, but only corruption that opposes it. He knows that where Christ gives
life, he gives Law, even the Law of the Spirit of life, to set him free from
the Law of sin and death Romans 8.2.
.

The Law in it self is like the Common Law of the Land; all right, but no
favor. Wherefore he flies to the Chancery of the Gospel: not to defend
lawless Acts, but to get a qualification of mercy in the right of Christ. He
rejoices to be under grace, not only as under shelter, but also as under
command, and admits the peace of God, not only as a Benefactor, but as a
Ruler Col. 3.15.
. Grace is his gracious Lord, yet a Lord. As Princes protect their Frontier
Towns, but for themselves, and to their own service: not lending them aid as
Associates, but putting in their own Garrison, to assure them of their
subjection: so Christ gives grace to his subjects, for their protection, but
for his own interest and service. The Garrison which protects them, does
command them, according to the Laws and Orders of him that set it in them, to
be over them.

Thus, this hypocrite seeks a toleration in sinning as warranted by
Christian-liberty: the true Christian seeks only a qualification of the Law,
that it be not exacted in rigor. The one under color of liberty throws off
the Law; the other emproveth his liberty to observe the Law.

This hypocrite frames a liberty to himself that Christ never gave him.

He foisteth into the magna charta of a Christian that which Christ never
granted. Sometimes in the things of God he commits this forgery. He
pretends a liberty either from the whole Law, as not binding Christ's subjects
at all; or particularly from the Law of the Sabbath, enjoined in the fourth
Commandment. Especially from the spiritual observance of it: which, because it
is spiritual, argues the Law that requires it to be both moral and eternal:
and, with respect thereto, the bodily rest becomes also moral.

But, says he, God is not so strict now adays: he looks not for so much
service and attendance. He examineth not whether men hear the Word or not;
whether once, or twice: much less how they hear Luke 8.18.
; or, whether they add private duties to the public exercises. He is well
enough served, if people can play, and dance, and drink, without fighting and
quarrelling. Short grace and long dinner; short service and much sport, very
well become a Christian, as a part of his Christian liberty.

Sometimes he makes bold with that which belongs to man. As the Anabaptist
that will be free from the Civil Magistrate; unless some (meaning of
themselves) rise up by Revelation, as the Judges in Israel, when yet there was
no King in Israel. Or, as Cnipperdolling at Munster, John Matthew, John of
Leiden, and others in Germany. Sleid. Com. li. 10. ad an. 1535
And as some servants think they may cast off the yoke of their bodily Masters,
even in things civil, and, in themselves lawful; under pretense that they are
forbidden to be servants of men 1 Cor. 7.23.
: not considering that in the very same place, the servant, till he may be made
free by him that has power over him, is commanded to abide in the same calling
wherein he was called ver. 20.21.
. Nor, is the question, whether one Christian that is a servant, should be
subject to a believing Master; but, to an infidel, not yet acknowledging
Christ, or his Gospel. As in the case of husband, and wife; the one a believer;
that is, a Christian receiving and professing the Gospel and Christ; the other
an infidel, not yet professing either. The believing party, either husband or
wife, was not to depart from the other ver. 12.13, 15.
.

An unbelieving Master may command things contrary to Christ, to go with him to
Idolatrous Temples, and to commit Idolatry, and compel them (as Paul once did)
to blaspheme, and abjure Christ Acts 26.11.
. Yet even here, the servant who is commanded to obey God rather than man, is
rather to suffer patiently, when for conscience toward God, he endure grief,
suffering wrongfully 1 Pet. 2.19.
; than to run away without a legal discharge: because, such suffering is
acceptable unto God ver. 20.
, and such a servant is thereunto called, because Christ also suffered for him,
leaving him an example that he should follow his steps ver. 21.
.

But, this hypocrite perhaps will reply to this, that he has less reason to
be a servant to a believer than those servants had to continue in the service
of unbelievers: because now, Christ has taken away all difference between bond
and free, as much as between Jew and Greek, male and female, and made all one
in himself Gal. 3.28. Col. 3.11.
; all are brethren, all partake alike of the common benefit, of the Gospel and
the Covenant of Grace: therefore he will be no longer a servant even to a
believing Master; not considering that as many servants as are under the yoke
are commanded by the Gospel to count their own Masters worthy of all honor,
that the Name of God, and his Doctrine be not blasphemed. And that they who
have believing Masters, should not despise them because they are brethren; but
rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the
benefit 1 Timothy 6.1, 2
.

This hypocrite therefore uses Christian liberty for a cloak of maliciousness
1 Pet. 2.16.
; whereas Christ came to give liberty from spiritual bondage under sin and
Satan; not, to dissolve outward relations; or, to free men from those duties
which the Laws of God and man require by virtue of those relations, in doing
bodily service from the heart, even as to the Lord himself Ephesians. 6.7
. Yea, so does he extend his liberty, that whatever sin he loves, he will by
hook or by crook, draw it within the compass of liberty, which he calls
Christian; so covering it as it were, under the Lords garment, as the Jews did
their unlawful divorces, under the shelter of Moses, as if what he sometimes
permitted by reason of the hardness of their hearts, to prevent murderers Mat.
19.8.
, in case of hatred M^l. 2.16.
, had been justifiable by the Law of God himself.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the true Christian is careful to keep himself to the Charter of Christ.

He is as willing to make due use of his liberty, as the hypocrite: only he
will not encroach; much less pervert his patent. He dares not admit, or affect
any liberty but that, which he is sure Christ will bear him out in. He knows
that liberty is a name that is borrowed by every body, to be put upon any thing
he has a mind unto, and is abused to licentiousness, more than some other
things that are in their own nature evil. If he have therefore a liberty from
Christ, he will be more careful in the use of it, than in making out his
warrant to use it, as knowing that all things that are lawful, are not
expedient for him, nor does he account any thing expedient for him: unless it
may some way edify 1 Cor. 10.23
.

Yea, he so carefully peruseth the Charter of the Gospel, (having a fearful
heart lest he should wrong so gracious a Sovereign) that he will rather deny
himself the lawful use of lawful things, than be the least occasion to make
any other to offend by his use thereof, either by taking unjust offense and
scandal at his liberty Romans 14.3.4.
, or by adventuring to do as he does, while he is yet unsatisfied touching the
lawfulness of it 1 Cor. 8.10.11
. He had rather abridge himself, and cut his liberty short, than suffer it to
degenerate into loosnesse, or to hinder the service either of God or man, or to
lay a stumbling block in his brothers way Romans 14.13.
.

He has learned even out of the Gospel, that unto whomsoever much is given, of
him shall be much required Luke 12.48.
. And that his Charter of liberty is a greater obligation to duty, and that
being delivered out of the hands of so many, so potent, so dangerous enemies,
he is now by way of thankfulness bound more strictly to serve God without
fear, in holiness and righteousness, that is, in all the duties of both
Tables of the Law, all the days of his life Luke 1.74.75
. That however he be freed from those extraordinary festivals, or Sabbaths
which were levitical and typical Col. 2.16.
, yet not from the moral Mat. 5.17.18 1 Cor. 16.1, 7.
: He knows that the Law is spiritual Romans 7.14.
, that, bodily exercise profits little 1 Timothy 1.8.
, that God is a Spirit, and that they that worship him, must worship him in
Spirit and in truth Joh. 4.24.
, not according to a fancied liberty of their own, but according to the rule
prescribed by himself: That, he that is of God hears Gods Word Joh. 8.47.
; therefore as a newborn babe, he desires the sincere milk of the Word, that
he may grow thereby 1 Pet. 2.2.
; he is careful not only what he hears Mark 4.24.
, but, how he hears Luke 8.18.
; that he may hear for time to come Isa. 42.23.
.

If he be a servant, he looks upon himself as the Lords free man, that is, as
made free from sin, and become a servant of God Romans 6.22.
: yet so as to be obedient to his Master according to the flesh, with fear and
trembling, in singleness of his heart, as unto Christ; not with eye-service,
as a man-pleaser, but as the servant of Christ, doing the will of God from the
heart, with good will doing service as to the Lord, and not to men; knowing
that whatsoever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord,
whether he be bond or free Ephesians. 6.5, 6, 7, 8
. In all things, his Motto is, as free, but, as the servant of God 1 Pet. 2.16.
. And, toward man, he approves that saying of the Orator, Legum servi sumus,
ut liberi esse possimus: We are servants of the Laws, that we may be free men.

Thus, this hypocrite makes himself free to what he pleases, and then
counterfeits, or corrupts the Charter of Christ for his warrant; the true
Christian, first peruseth his Charter, and thence circumscribeth his freedom;
the one is, in Gods account, no better than those rogues, who make themselves
passes under an hedge, wherein one cunning rogue, plays the Justice, or his
Clerk, for all the rest: (for so, when vagrant lusts meet in a wicked heart,
one helps another, and hypocrisy playing the Clerk, makes passes for them
all:) the other is like a vigilant Constable, that examining these false
passes, whippeth those lusts that produce them, and tears their passes in
pieces.

This hypocrite counts it perfection to renounce the liberty that Christ has
given him.

He is sometimes too loose, and sometimes too strict: sometimes he graspeth too
much, sometimes he will have none at all. We have seen him in his
licentiousness; now, view him in his precontrary humor. He will be in bondage
again to impotent and beggarly rudiments Gal. 4.9.
, and be under a Law ver. 21.
from which he is freed, whether Christ will or no. He will not accept of all
the kindness that Christ offers; he needs not so much favor. He
accounts it no sin, to set light by that which cost Christ so dear; to
reckon that not worth the having, which Christ thought worth the shedding of
his blood for. He will rather cut himself off from his part in Christ, than
that Christ shall cut off his humor of being again entangled with the yoke of
bondage Gal. 5 1,
. If he have a fancy to circumcision, he will rather lose all benefit of
Christ, than not undergo that sharp ceremony, by which Christ shall profit him
nothing. He will rather be a debtor to the whole Law than be beholding to
Christ for his righteousness. He will rather renounce his interest in the
Covenant or Grace, to be justified by the Law, than lose the honor of his own
works ver. 2.3.4.
.

So that, what Agiselaus said of the Asians, that they were good slaves, but
bad free men, is true of this hypocrite: he is fitter to make a Jew, than a
Christian. For, when he may go out free, he plainly says, I will not go out
free Exodus 21, 4, 5
. He deserves to be bored through the ear ver. 6.
, and to receive the mark of a perpetual slave, that has such a slavish mind.
As some Israelites wished themselves in Egypt again, rather than go to Canaan,
(were it not better for us to return into Egypt Number. 14.3.
?) and some Jews could have been well contented to have tarried in Babylon, so
at this day many such there are, who though they go to Church, yet had rather
return to Rome again, and to see that gaudy Religion set up again in all the
dress of the Whore, than cordially to embrace the pure and naked Truth of the
Gospel, according to the simplicity that is in Christ 2 Cor 11.3.
. He will rather burn in lust, than accept the benefit of marriage.

In a Jewish, or Popish humor, he renews differences of meats, which Christ
has taken away, together with the Law of Ordinances touching the same Col.
2.14, 16 17.
. He holds it a sin to eat flesh on a Friday; but none to live after the
flesh, either then, or all the week long. If he abstain from flesh, this is
Religion enough, although he have no grace in his heart; yea, though he swear,
lie, cosen, and defraud, at the same time. If he religiously, or gluttonously
observe such a festival of a Saint, which is his Wake, or his Revelling day, it
is sufficient, though he impiously profane the Lords day, or take the Name of
God in vain in the formal performance of the duties of the day. All which seem
to be but as the Lees of Satan's endeavor, and as it were the grounds of his
wit, now almost at an end together with his work.

On the contrary, Differ.
the true Christian makes precious account of that which cost his Savior so
dear.

As wise Citizens are careful to preserve their Charters, granted them by the
favor of grace, of their Prince; so he, to stand fast in the liberty wherewith
Christ has made him free Gal. 5.1
. And seeing the substance of Gods spiritual service continues (which he would
not have to be removed) he is fully satisfied, and glad that the yoke of the
circumstantial and ceremonial shadows which were so burdensome, is not only
made lighter; but broken Act. 15.10
. Nor can it sink into his mind, that our Savior who came to pull down the
partition wall Ephesians. 2.14
, and to take away all notes of difference between Jews and Gentiles, would
have him now to retain any pomp of outward Ceremonies in his worship, saving
only such as without which the spiritual worship cannot consist; such as are
the preaching of the Word, and the Sacramental Rites as they are prescribed, or
practiced in the New Testament, and no otherwise.

And as for any differences of meats and drinks, upon the account of a
religious observation, under pain of the guilt of sin, (further than they are
upon a political consideration enjoined by the Civil Magistrate, not as a piece
of Religion, but as conducing to some public benefit of the Commonwealth, for
the increase of Fishermen and Mariners, and for repair of Port-Towns and
Navigation, and not for any superstition to be maintained in the choice of
meats 5. Eliz. c. 5. entitled Constitutions for maintenance of the Navy, etc.
) he wholly renounceth them as a piece of the doctrine of devils, commanding to
abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of
them which believe, and know the truth; which is, that every creature of God is
good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is
sanctified by the Word of God, and prayer 1 Timothy 4.3, 4, 5
. Therefore, he holds it better to eat flesh with grace (unless in case of
contempt of the Civil Magistrate) than fish without it: for that the Kingdom
of God is not meat or drink, but righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost Romans 14.17
: and that it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, and not
with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein Heb.
13.9
.

He thankfully emproveth whatever liberties are afforded him, yet will not make
use of them to offend or grieve others. But when, for the sake of others, he
abstaineth, he does not thereby condemn that from which he refraineth, (if a
part of Christ's purchase,) but only forbear the use, to avoid giving of
offense. Such a restraint put upon himself, is no abridgement of the liberty
given by Christ, but only a confining it to the mind of Christ, who never gave
liberty to him, to impose upon his brother.

Thus, this hypocrite had rather sing, and say, Carry burdens, or do any thing;
than so to hear as to learn, so to meditate, as to make conscience; so to be
free, as to lay nothing upon himself: the true Christian being delivered from
that rack of mind, lying on the unsatisfied Christian, and imposed by the
hypocrite upon himself, bestows all his care how to perform spiritual worship
with a free spirit: the one is for meats and drinks and outward ceremonies; the
other is for establishing the heart with grace, and to be freed what he may
from outward ceremonies, that he may be more free and vacant for substantial
duties.

This hypocrite, because he must not exceed in superfluity, will tie himself to
unnecessary

To avoid superfluity is no great thanks: but, to cut himself short of
necessaries, he thinks to be a work of supererogation, when it is rather a
superstitious or sullen requital of divine largess and bounty. He will fast
twice a week to be observed of men Luke 18.12
; when he will not fast once in a year, to fast as he ought unto God Zech. 7.5
. In apparel, if he shun excess, he is so austere, and affectedly humorous,
that he makes it meritorious to wear one sort of garment, not another, of such
a coarsenesse, kind of stuff, color, fashion; that he accounts it a sin, to
wear any other: and he rigidly censureth all that differ from him therein, and
accounts himself to be a Christian Paramount for so doing.

No Popish Friars, that are most superstitious in their fare, their habit,
their colors, etc. can go beyond him, or match him, but he makes himself as
ridiculous with his affected abstinence, habit, and obsolete affected fashions,
as others make themselves scandalous by their superfluity, and antique
gue-gawes of fantastical invention. For all extremes are equally hateful to
God; unless where he that puts himself into one extreme, pretends to more
acquaintance with God Amos 3.2
, (and thereby makes the sin greater) than he that runs into the other extreme,
and profeseth no better.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian thankfully makes use of his Masters kindness.

He knows that to farewell, at the cost of Christ, is no sin, when God in a
just and lawful way, sets plenty before him, and affords him a time to rejoice:
and, that it is good and comely to eat, and to drink, and to enjoy the good of
his labor: and, that this is the gift of God Eccl. 5.18, 19
, if he make not his belly his God Phil. 3.19
; and do not take this liberty when God calls to weeping and mourning Isa.
22.12, 13
. Nor does he account it an offense to be clothed in purple, if it be without
pride, and within the compass and rank of his place as well as of his purse.

He eats not another man's bread, but the labor of his own hands Psalm. 128.2
, or the blessing of God upon the labors of his Parents or Relations: not for
gluttony, but to fit him for service; in season, for strength, and not for
drunkenness Eccl. 10.17
. Thus he eats, and it is well with him Jer. 22.15
. Yea, at times, with Gods good leave, he eats of the fat, and drinks of
the sweet Nehem. 8.10
. But still reserveth himself able and ready for works, Charity, Justice, and
Liberality. He can overcome himself and his appetite when God calls to it, as
freely as he can give way to appetite where God allows it.

He knows excess in apparel is as hateful to God, as riot and luxury in
eating and drinking, and that there is a comeliness to be observed in the
greatest liberty allowed by God: but he does not find that simply the wearing
of silk, silver, or gold, is simply condemned, the circumstances of time, place
and persons duly observed. The virtuous woman made use of coverings of
tapestrie, and her clothing was of silk and purple Prove: 30.22
. And the holy Matrons were not without their jewels and bracelets: only the
chief care was for adorning the hidden man of the heart with that which is not
corruptible 1 Pet. 3.4
, as becomes women professing godliness 1 Timothy 2.10
. Therefore, in his apparel he is careful to be grave, not light; sober, not
fantastical; to take pattern from the gravest of his own rank and age; neither
affecting what is antiquated by custom and use, nor seeking to be clothed with
strange apparel Zeph. 1.8
: nor denying himself the comfort and benefit of what Christ has allowed him.

Thus, this hypocrite is over-abstemious: not as not loving of liberty, even to
superfluity; but rather, as angry that he is curbed in the liberty which he
loves, he despises Christ's allowance: not unlike to those children, who
because they may not have the whole apple, throw away the half: the true
Christian thankfully uses liberty, where it is useful, although he may not
have all that he desires; being of the mind, that, better half a loaf, than
no bread: the one is like an humorous and froward servant, who not pleased with
his Masters livery, chooses rather to go in rags to dishonor his Master, than
to wear what is appointed him; the other is as the Prodigal son returned, so
full of self-denial that he will now be content with aany thing that his father
will allow him Luke 15.19
.

CHAP. XXXVI. The Scandalous and Captious Hypocrite Is he, that is apt to
offend, or to be offended at another peril, Defin.
not his own.
A Scandal, or offense is that whereat any one stumbleth, or dasheth himself
Mat. 18.6
, and is thereby hindered, or weakened in the way, or turned out of the way of
goodness Heb. 12.13
. Such scandals have been, are, and must be while wicked men continue in the
world under the guise, habit, and name of Christians and Professors; both for
the discovery of their hypocrisy Luke 2.35
, and for the trial of the truly godly 1 Cor. 11.19
. Scandal, in the language of the Holy Ghost, imports the stumbling of some
person in the Church, at some thing, or person, within the Church also.
Therefore the sin is the greater, by whomsoever committed. Hence our Savior
denounces, Woe to the world, because of offenses. For, though it must needs be
that offenses come; yet woe to the man by whom the offense comes Mat. 18.7
. It were better for him that a millstone had been hanged about his neck and
that he had been drowned in the midst of the sea, before he had given offense
and scandal to so much as one believer Ver. 6
.

But, let it fare how it will with them that give, or take offense, Satan is
more busy to promote this trade, than any other course of sin, because other
sins are most commonly committed by the beasts and swine of the world; but
this, by the choicest and most precious people of the world, at least in name;
whereby not only some one, or few, sin; but, many more are offended and grieved;
and the Name of Christ, and his Gospel, exceedingly blasphemed by the rest of
the world, who are glad of the sin committed; because, thereby all Professors,
the Gospel, and Christ himself are all shamed at once; or at least, the world
will do what they can to have it so. With good reason therefore does Christ
proclaim woe to the world because of offenses; because, though carnal professed
worldlings be not first in this sin, but it is begun and carried on by
Professors; yet, it becomes their sin also at the rebound, when once they come
to take notice of it. And so scandal comes at length to contract an almost
universal guilt, wheresoever, and by whomsoever it first began.

He therefore that takes up this sin, drives on the devils trade, and is
therein a devil incarnate, especially if he do it willingly as delighting in
it. Every sin, how small soever, is damnable, but every sin is the more
damnable, by how many the more it involves in the guilt of it. And there is no
sin that draws in so many at the long-run, as this of scandal. Sometimes a
Christian may happily fall into it, ere he be aware, as Peter, when he persuaded
Christ to spare himself, and not to suffer the things which he foretold of
himself: for which purpose Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be
it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee Mat. 16.2^
; But the good man was so far mistaken, that Christ forthwith gave him this
sharp check, Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offense unto me Ver. 23
. Peter was an offense unto him as endeavoring to hinder him, or to turn him
out of the way which God had appointed for him: and, thereby acted Satan's part;
and for doing his office, is called Satan, by his Lord: for, had Peter therein
prevailed, all the world, and himself too, had perished for ever.

But, the hypocrite makes this his trade, he has a mind to offend others, he
loves to vex and grieve them, by casting blocks in their way; and to take
offense and quarrel at almost every thing they do. He is never well, but when
he is giving, or taking offense. Hence that sad complaint of God, Among my
people are found wicked men; they lay wait as he that sets snares; they set
a trap, they catch men Jer. 5.26
. He is never in his element, but when he can cause others to fall: and none so
captious at others, to take them up for falling before they be down. And,
whether they stumble at him, or he at them, still the fault is theirs, not his:
they take offense at him without cause, and give him just cause to take offense
at them. If others take offense at him, for giving offense, his answer is, What
have you to do with that, or with me? Who art thou that judge another man's
servant? making use of the words, contrary to the sense. If he take offense at
them: it is excuse enough for him to say, Why lay they blocks in my ways? why
do they provoke me?

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian aims to be (...), without offense Phil 1.10
.

He loves his brother, and abides in the light; therefore there is no
occasion of stumbling (or scandal) in him 1 John 2.10
. He will neither give, nor take offense. He loves his brother, therefore he
will not willingly offend him, nor takes any thing in the evil part from him;
he is not easily provoked, thinks no evil 1 Cor. 13.5
: and, the rather, because he abides in the light, which preventeth stumbling.
It is for such ^ walk in darkness, not knowing whither they go, to stumble, or
to run their heads against a post, ere they be aware, because they lack light.
He that is in the light, and walks in it, is in no such danger. Or, if he
casually stumble, he quickly, by the help of the light, gets up again, as
David, Peter, and others have done.

If he happen to stumble, and fall, he does not lay the fault upon others, but
takes all upon himself. David did not charge his sin upon Bathshebahs
immodesty, in washing her self so openly, that he could not but see her naked
from the roof of his house 2 Samuel 11.2
, where it was not unlawful for him to be; but, he charge all upon his own
sinful lust, I have sinned against the Lord 2 Samuel 12.13
. Peter, when he fell, he did not blame the maid for her bold face, that so
earnestly stared him in the face, and accused him that he was one of Christ's
company; nor, their confidence who, one after another frighted him by charging
him with the same thing so as was enough to have daunted the best courage at
such a time, and at such a disadvantage of place, and power; but, he quietly
and humbly takes all upon his own cowardice and infidelity. He first gave
offense to Christ in dissuading him from suffering; and now, takes offense at
Christ, when he saw him likely to suffer; and both these he lamenteth with
bitter tears Luke 22.62
.

Thus, this hypocrite is like a common Barretor, that cares not to do any man
right; and resolves to take nothing, which he calls wrong; the true Christian
will give no offense, neither to the Jew, nor to the Gentile, nor to the Church
of God 1 Cor 10.32
: and, will rather take wrong 1 Cor. 6 7
, and say to them that have given him most offense, ye have not injured me at
all Gal. 4.12
, than quarrel and brabble for every offense offered. The one is scandalous and
captious, yet lays all the blame upon others; the other is inoffensive, and
charitable, without complaining of others.

This hypocrite offends others by doing evil himself.

He offends others, both by sinning against God, at which they are grieved
Psalm. 139.21
; and by laying a stumbling block before them, whereby they are solicited and
provoked to sin, either by causing the Name of God to be blasphemed among the
Gintiles, through him Romans 2.24
; that is, by opening the mouths of such as are openly and atheistically
profane, to speak all manner of evil of the Professors of the Gospel in
general, and of each member of Christ in particular, as if he and they were all
alike; or, to be drawn by his example, unto the same wickedness with him. And
so he makes the consequent of his sin, through the danger of example, a greater
evil than the sin it self which he first committed, simply considered in the
nature of it, because by consequent, scandal given multiplieth both sin, and
sinners.

Howbeit, when he has thus sinned, and is reproved for it, he roughly
answers, Every vessel shall stand on his own bottom: what need any body be
offended at me? He confesses the fact, when it is too palpable to be denied;
but he denies it to be scandalous, if others would not be over-busie to take
offense. He thinks he can make his party good with God, well enough; but, he is
loath to be charged with the consequent, whereby he should be cast as guilty of
drawing other men into sin also, and so incur that woe denounced by the Lord
Jesus Christ against such offenders. Therefore he says, Do as I say, not as I
do: follow my Profession, not my practice. Indeed that were wisdom; and so, one
party would be clear: but now, the fault becomes the others that stumbleth at
his stumbling block, which increases both his guilt, and his condemnation.

Contrarily, Differ.
the true Christian is therefore more careful to abstain from all appearance of
evil, that he might not put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall, in his
brothers way Romans 14.13
.

He will refrain the use of things lawful, and never make use of his just
liberty allowed him by Christ while he lives, rather than eat of flesh, or
drink wine, or any thing, whereby his brother might stumble, or be offended, or
made weak Ver. 21
: He knows how to value his liberty as well as another; but, he prefers
charity before liberty; and his brothers safety before his own will. He will
not walk so uncharitably as to grieve his brother by his meat, much less to
destroy him for whom Christ died Ver. 15
.

Much more will he avoid the giving of offense in any thing 2 Cor. 6.3
, that is evil, or has but an appearance of it. He is more afraid of being the
occasion of another man's sinning in the least, than of suffering the greatest
trouble himself. He will do nothing to make him so much as to halt, but
carefully follows the things wherewith he may edify others Romans 14.19
. He will in all things so do, as one that is his brothers Keeper Gen 4.9
. that he may do no evil; that the ear which hears him, may bless him, and
the eye that sees him may give witness to him Job 29.11
.

Thus, this hypocrite cares not what blocks he lays in the ways of others,
so he may have his will in sinning; the true Christian cares not how much he
deny himself, so he may thereby be free from giving offense. The one lays
snares to catch men; the other breaks all the snares he can, that men may not
be caught.

This hypocrite sometimes causes others to lay those blocks in the way, which
he will

Either there is some special restraint laid upon him by God, or men, that he
may not, he dare not be seen in laying stumbling blocks himself, and then he
will do it by others, that he may not be seen, or thought to have any hand in
it. Thus Balaam, (who was kept from cursing Israel) when he saw he could do no
mischief to Gods people, by any act of his own; yet, rather than do nothing, he
taught Balaak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat
things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication Rev. 2.14
with the Moabitish women Number. 25.1, 2
. The daughters of Moab were sent out among the Israelites as a snare, to
provoke them to uncleanness: which, the women would not yield unto, till the
men first went with them to the sacrifices of their gods, and bowed down unto
them Ver. 3
. Balaam carried this so smoothly, that Israel being wounded, never knew who
laid the plot to hurt them. But God found him out in his closest wickedness,
and has set the discovery thereof upon record, to let all such hypocrites know
that they are not hid from him.

Or, perhaps, the greatness, or gravity of his place or years, or some
relation, or fear to be branded, or otherwise to suffer for it, makes him
unwilling to be seen himself to cause others to fall; yet he has his
instruments fitted for such a work; and them, underhand, he employeth to do
the feat as dexterously and effectually, as if he had done it himself. Jezabel
had her Elders and Noblet to suborne false witnesses, and to stone Naboth at a
fast, while Ahab and her Majesty, good souls, were absent, and must be
supposed by the Many, to have no hand in the business ^ Kings ^1.9, 10, 11
. So Joab, instructed a woman of Tekoah, to use a parable to David, thereby to
prevail, for fetching home of Absalom, who, for murdering of Amnon had fled,
and durst not return, till he was sure of pardon 2 Samuel ^4
.

This hypocrice, having an heart as wicked as any, is as prone as any others
unto wickedness; and, to use all acts to draw them unto sin: but, his
Profession restrains him from that liberty which others openly take; and
therefore he must have his Agents whom secretly he instructs that the thing
may be done, and he not appear in it. And, if thereby, the other before whom he
caused a block to be laid, happen to stumble and fall, none shall be more
ready to insult over him, and to be more sharp and bitter against him, than
this hypocrite who first laid the plot. Now he has, or will have his desire
upon the other, and then says, he might have had more wit.

I^ he be a Courtier, he can employ others to lay a train for him whom he
hates, to commit some evil that may ruin him. If he has any design upon
Religion, he can find persons to low seeds of discord between brethren, in
matters of Doctrine, Worship, or Discipline, as any, or each of these may
conduce best to his purpose: and he, stand and look on, and seem to be sorry
for the divisions that appear, while they are but the chickens of his own eggs
hatched by another Hen.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian is as careful to keep others (what he may)
from sin, as himself.

He knows it to be his duty to watch over his brother, and to save others with
fear, pulling them out of the fire Jude 23
; if casually, or willingly fallen into it. As therefore he is circumspect in
his own walking Ephesians. 5.15
, that he give no offense; so he is vigilant over his brethren least any other
tempter should tempt them 1 These. 3.5
. He will warn the unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, and support the weak 1
The^ 5 14
. If he see others solici^ing them to any evil, or laying snares for them, he
will give them notice; and arm them against it, as Paul did, the
Thessalonians, that they be not shaken in mind 2 These. 2.2
, no^ s^e as children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
doctrine, by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in
wait to deceive Ephesians. 4.14
.

His first care is to give no offense himself: and then, to prevent others from
being occasions of offense unto any. If either wife, or child, or friend be apt
to give offense; he will do his utmost to prevent their sinning in this kind.
He will admonish, instruct, reprove, and (if he have power) correct, as well as
warn the unruly. He will not suffer any man (if he can hinder it) to lay a
stumbling block before the blind Lev. 19.14
, whereby he should receive the least hurt in his body; much less, such a
block whereby he should receive damage in his soul.

Thus, this hypocrite is as a serpent by the way, and an adder in the path that
bitteth the horse heels, ere he be discerned or discovered, so that the rider
falls backward Genesis 49.17
. The true Christian is as he that stands continually upon the Watchtower,
and cries, a Lion Isa. 21.8
, when he perceives any Seducer, or cunning Factor of Satan, endeavoring to
offend others by grieving them, or drawing them into sin: the one not only
offends himself, but traineth up others to the same trade: the other likes
the trade so ill, that he does what he can to destroy it.

This hypocrite will be a temptation, but not a tempter.

He will not be so grossly wicked as to solicit others to sin in downright
language, like the impudent harlot that lies in wait at every corner, and
finding a young man void of understanding, catches, and kisseth him, and with
an impudent face, tells him her business, in plain terms Prove. 7.13. etc
. But yet he will do that by his action, which shall sufficiently tell his
meaning, although his tongue be silent. He can speak by signs, by obscene
gestures, (as the woman, by light and whorish apparel, naked back and breasts,
etc. that yet says, she has no ill intention in it, but has a chaste heart,
and scorns all motions to uncleanness or to the least wantonness) until he or
she that beholds it, be ensnared and caught.

I do nothing, says he, and she too) but what may be done: if any be offended,
who can help it? Let them thank themselves if they do any thing they should not,
by occasion of my doing that which I am able to justify. He said nothing to
them: he only uses his lawful liberty: if they get evil by his good, it is
their own faults, and not his. And so, by his cunning, he hurts others no less
than if he had openly tempted them to sin; and himself, more. For, by this
device, he thinks to catch others in his snare, and himself to be blameless;
whereby he doubles his sin. For, admit the thing be never so lawful in it self,
yet it is evil to him that does it with offense Romans 14.20
: evil in the pattern, for he does it so as he gives offense; and, evil in him
that does imitate that pattern with offense; doing it only upon the ground of
example, albeit he be not satisfied in the lawfulness of it. All which evil
will be brought to the account of this hypocrite, who cunningly led the way, to
make the other fall: and then says, he meant no such matter.

He thinks it enough to be honest in meaning, although he be not so in his
outward garb, behavior and actions, that in none of these there may be an
appearance of evil 1 These. 5.^2
, nor any temptation to, or occasion of evil unto others. Herein many women
(pretending unto godliness) offend very much, by taking overmuch liberty of
be ng in the fashion, because they can truly say, they do it not to entice, or
provoke others, but merely to avoid being laughed at, for being out of the
fashion. They would have you to know, they hate uncleanness and wantonness as
much as you, or any others; and if any man shall dare to attempt their
chastity, he shall receive such a repulse as shall make him unwilling to a
second onset. And, upon this ground, they go with naked breasts, garish
attire, ready to court, and to be courted, to show (not their wantonness, but)
their breeding. And, what harm in this?

Bu^, what if others that behold them be wantonly disposed, and take fi e by
such a spectacle? What if a man truly godly should kindle at such a sight, as
David 2 Samuel 11.3
, who otherwise might have continued chaste? And, he be so enflamed* that he
who was first but occasionally tempted by her, now tempts her in plain terms,
and never gives over, till she yield, and wickedness be committed? Now is she
become a temptation and a tempter too, in effect, and so makes her self guilty
of his wickedness as well as of her own. The like may be said of married
persons, who under color of extreme love, carry themselves so fondly, and in
such an unseemly, (and sometimes wanton) manner before others, that they
provoke others to lust; and that so far, as it many times ends in the defiling
of the woman that behaved her self so foolishly, as a just punishment of the
husbands fondness and folly.

On the contrary, the true Christian avoideth all occasions of tentation,
Differ.
as much as actual tempting.

He is as careful that other men take not hurt by his careless using of fire
in his own house, as he is, not to set their houses on fire, of purpose. He
will not be so regardlesse of others, as to use any part of his liberty before
them who are either not so persuaded as he is, or not permitted to do as he
does. He observes that tinder being brought too near the fire, may kindle,
without striking fire into it. He thinks it not enough to say, I tempt no man,
nor woman; I use no idle or wanton speech, or behavior, unless he be able to
say also, I do not that act in the presence of others, which might occasion
sin in others.

His liberty is governed by charity; and his love, by modesty, and sobriety:
and these teach him so to use his liberty as to preserve holiness and honesty
in others as well as in himself; to cast water upon other men's undue fires, not
to help them with bellows. Liberty (he finds) is an expatiating thing, and
therefore must be bounded: so that he, that has laid Christ for the
cornerstone in his own heart, will be careful by no means to lay a
stumbling-stone before others. His office is to gather with Christ Luke 11.^8
, therefore he will not scatter: to build up others in their most holy faith,
therefore he will do nothing that may in the least, shake, or weaken the
building.

He may do all things that Christ has made lawful unto him; but, he will not
be brought under the power of any thing 1 Cor. 6.12
, so as not to be able to abstain from the use of it, where he finds it
inexpedient, or hurtful to others in the least. He has power to do many things
more than he does; but no power of his shall be used as a stumbling block to
them that are weak 1 Cor. 8.9
, nor as bellows to the wicked. He knows little difference between sinning
himself, and being wittingly an occasion of temptation to sin in others;
unless, to be guilty of the sins of others also. Therefore, as he denies to
himself all liberty of doing unlawful things, so he abridgeth himself in the
use of lawful things, holding none to be lawful for him to use, which are not
expedient, and which do not edify.

Thus, this hypocrite is as he that cares not how many houses, by his occasion,
be in a flame, so it cannot be proved that he neither intended or attempted to
set them on fire: the true Christian is as he that will rather rake up his own
fire, or cast water upon it, than any spark of his should catch in his
neighbors house. The one does as truly tempt in effect, as he that is a formal
tempter, and then thinks to salve all with a distinction; the other will not
tempt either way, because both are sinful, and so no distinction between them
will be admitted at the Tribunal of Christ; temptation, being but as laying the
bait, and tempting, but as setting the net, and hunting into it.

This hypocrite lays the stumbling block in his own way, and gives offense
to himself.

If his heart be set upon any thing that is doubtful, he imagines and uses a
liberty therein, before he have scanned over all the reasons against it, or be
fully satisfied in the reasons for it. He does it haesitante conscientia, with
a staggering conscience, if not against conscience: and so sins, though the
thing in it self may possibly be lawful, and good. It is lawful to eat all
sorts of meats, says one: not so, says another, who thinks he has strong
reasons to abstain: yet, upon some reasons (which he accounts weak) he
eats, and therein sins, as to his own conscience, though not as to the
meat it self. For he eats doubtingly; and therefore is damned if he eat; not
eternally damned by the sentence of God, yet damned as a sinner by his own
conscience, because he eats not in faith, as believing that to be lawful
which he does: for, whatsoever is not of faith is sin Romans 14.23
.

If he love the meat, he will adventure to eat it, although he sin by it: if he
love it not, he will dispute against it, although he be out in it. Yea,
sometimes he hoodwinks himself, that he may sin blindfold. He will not be
persuaded of, nor so much as enquire far into the unlawfulness of that which
he has a mind unto: and so he can swallow those great Camels of breach of the
Sabbath, Usury, deceitful mysteries in trades, etc. as so many gnats that will
never (as he thinks) choke his conscience, nor in the least offend it. What
need I, says he, trouble my conscience about that breach of the Sabbath, which
is not punishable by Law? And the like Queries he makes touching any disputable
thing to which his heart is inclined: and, love to sin will make any thing
disputable to such an heart.

If but the title of a book propound a lawful use of lots, recreations,
interest, etc. he will not trouble himself to enquire, in what cases, nor turn
over the leaves to see the cautions: but runs away with the Title many times
even against the sense of the Author. Thus, this hypocrite has many ways to
put the stumbling block of iniquity before his own face, which he sets up as
an idol in his own heart Ezekiel. 14.4
, until he suffer himself to be so far engaged in doubtful liberties, that
now, though offensive, he cannot forbear them: and, how sinful soever, he must
defend them.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian labors chiefly to make all sure on his own
side.

He holds it not equal that his liberty should be condemned of another man's
conscience 1 Cor. 10.29
, no more than that his conscience should be a rule to another man's liberty.
But he is specially careful that his own conscience be not scandalized at his
own practice. His first care is, to be fully persuaded in his own mind Romans
14.5
, that he may not be so unhappy as to condemn himself in the thing that he
allows Ver. 22
. He may be mistaken in his judgment: but, his conscience will not suffer him
to act, till his judgment at present be satisfied: that so, if after it appear
that he was in an error, conscience might not be guilty of acting against
judgment; nor conscience fly upon him for acting against her; but, that all
may be resolved into a sin of ignorance.

If he doubt in the least, he refraineth the use of his liberty, because
therein no man is a loser, unless himself. He may suffer somewhat in going
without some liberty which might gratify his affections or pleasure: but,
there will be no loss in the peace of his conscience, no civil war in his
bosom, no blot to his name. Wherefore he holds hard on Gods side against his
own inclination: and, is partial for the Law, rather than for his own liberty:
fearing lest God and he should not be of a mind. He cannot easily resolve that
to be lawful, at least expedient, to which his corrupt heart so willingly and
strongly enclineth. He knows it to be a sin to make bold with even an
erroneous conscience. Wherefore he studieth the point of liberty, holding the
doctrine dear; but, makes use of it according to occasion, so as he may be
sure not to abuse it. He is jealous of any thing that presses too much upon
him, and is afraid of that liberty that may end in his own captivity.

Thus, this hypocrite is like him that being much addicted to play, will, for
want of company, play with himself, although he lose by the hand: the true
Christian is like him, that will be no loser by his own play. The one will
rather break his own shins, than not cause some to stumble; the other will
rather remove blocks out of other men's way, than lay any in his own.

T^is hypocrite chooses to give the greater offense, under color to avoid the

Under color of being scandalized at some petty business of a vesture,
gesture, or the like, ^e cares not what scandal he gives by separa^ing himself
from the public Worship, or behaving himself unseemlie in it. He is very
careful that himself be not offended, but altogether careless of grieving
others by giving offense. He seems to be very render of conscience in point of
taking offense, but little better than seared, when admonished not to give
offense.

He makes a necessity where there is none; but, obeys not necessity where God
has imposed it. Of Contradictories, one must needs be admitted: eat, or not
eat; play, or not play; but, of contrarieties, in things more widely opposite,
there is no necessity to choose one to avoid the other, when both are evil.
Much less to choose the greater to avoid the less: yet, as Papists allow
public Stews, to avoid secret adulteries: or, as some go to Mass to please
their Popish Masters, or as others mis-^pend the Sabbath that they may not
offend their profane be^ers; so this hypocrite chooses rather to give offense
which is always a sin, to avoid the taking offense, which is sometimes an
affliction, not a sin, than to be careful of avoidi^g ^oth.

That I take offense at other men's sin, is my affliction to meet with such an
occasion: but the sin is theirs, who gave the occasion. Howbeit this hypocrite
thinks it better to run upon the rock of giving offense not only to particular
persons, but even to whole Churches and States, to avoid the offense of some
private persons, offended for the most part without a cause: whereas if there
were a little of those sweet ingredients, discretion and charity in either
party, mingled with their zeal, it were easy to persuade those weak brethren
not to take offense, and him not to give it.

Contrariwise, Differ.
the true Christian will (as far as in him lies) give offense in nothing.

Of two evils he will choose the less, if neither of them be a sin: otherwise,
he will choose neither for avoiding of sin against God, whatever he suffer at
the hands of men. If he must needs offend men by refusing that which is a sin
against God, he will choose rather to offend men, because such offense (however
it may cost him dear) is no sin. Ind^fferent actions he will omit, even while
the world stands 1 Cor. 1.12
, rather than offend his brother; but not necessary actions, which God
requires, whoever be offended at them Act. 5.28, 2^
. As charity orders liberty, so faith orders charity. For, faith in God,
and credit to his Word, is the rule of charity toward men.

He considers that, of persons apt to take offense, there are sundry sorts.
First, some are weak, and some are wilful: willingly he offends neither, but
does his utmost to please all men in all things 1 Cor. 10.33
that tend to their profit that they may be saved. But, if one must be
offended, then he spares the weak, and neglects the wilful and contentious 1
Cor. 11.16
, after the example of his Savior who slighted the Pharisees, taking offense
at his sayings, as blind leaders of the blind, and as plants that were to be
plucked up Mat. 15.12, 13 14
: and, after the example of Paul, who did two contrary things; He circumcised
Timothy Acts 16.3
, who by the mothers side was a Jew, to avoid offense: but, he would not
circumcise Titus, that was a Gentile, that he might not give place to them who
would bring in upon the Gentiles also a necessity of circumcision.

Secondly, some are public persons, and some are private; here also the
Christian is careful, if he cannot please both, to offend a private friend,
than a Magistrate; a brother, rather than the Father of his Country.

Lastly, because of weak ones, some are in the right, some in the wrong, he
will herein follow Paul, rather than Peter. For Paul (being better advised in
that point) would rather have the Jews offended, who took offense without
cause, than the Gentiles scandalized by Peter's causlesse dissimulation. Peter
might say, both are brethren, both are weak; whom should I rather respect, but
mine own Countrymen? But the Apostle of the Gentiles thought they were to be
favored, as being in the right. For, these were to be confirmed in the point
of Christian-liberty, whereas the Jews were to be drawn by little and little
from the dissolved yoke of Mosaical ceremonies.

Thus, this hypocrite is as Ephraim, a cake not turned Hos 7.8
, neither raw nor roasted: very hot on the one side, in taking offense where
none is given, but cold enough on the other, in avoiding to give offense: the
true Christian is as the Apostles, in choosing rather to disobey and offend man,
than God Act. 5.42
, when man will be offended for obeying God: the one is more tender of himself,
than of God, or his neighbor; the other is more tender of God, than of his
neighbor; and, of both, than of himself.

This hypocrite seems sometimes to take offense at nothing, but at those who
take offense at any thing.

We have seen the scandalousnesse of this hypocrite in giving offense; we will
now take a further view of him, as he takes offense, in which respect we may
fitly term him the captious hypocrite, taking offense at every thing, but what
he should, and little or nothing moved at what he ought.

And first, in the extremity of defect, he is offended at no thing, with no
body. No man's conversation offends him. He thanks God, he finds no fault
with the world, nor sees reason why any man should take offense. He never saw
worse than himself (and herein you may take him at his word.) He blesses those
whom the Lord abhors Psalm. 10.3
; at least he excuses them. God forbid, says he, they should be so bad as you
make them. They may be in some things a little too blame, but not half so much
as you deem them.

But you will say, If he take no offense, what have we to do with him here?
Surely, because both extremes belong to the same kind: and yet much more,
because he that takes offense at none, cannot but be offended at those that
take offense at any. He wonders that any should find fault with the times,
manners, company; and, while he commends his own charity, he must needs condemn
their severity, and seem to be much scandalized at it, as the Jews, at Christ,
when for telling them their own, that they were of their father the devil; they
said, he had a devil John 8.48
.

It were well, says he, that all men could live without faults: but yet, a
little drinking, dicing, revelling, swearing more than ordinary, '^is but
honest mirth, the fruits of youthful spirits. For his part he saw nothing to be
misliked, and marvelleth that any should be so harsh as to condemn it. If he
hear Christ himself threaten damnation to the Priests and Scribes, those
unfaithful husbandmen that first slew the servants, then the Son of the Lord of
the Vineyard; he is of the peoples mind, that said, God ferbid Luke 20.16
. It is his charity, his modesty, that he is no Censurer, no Judge, no Medler
with other men's matters. He leaves that to other men. A fit man for a bad
world, and therein much made of: for the world has need of him, and he of it.
He has every ones good word, for a quiet man, a kind neighbor, you shall
never hear him find fault, say his neighbors: it were well your rigid
Ministers and Precisians would learn of him, etc.

To such a generation it was that Christ sometimes said, the world cannot hate
you, but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are
evil John 7.7
. But, as he denounced a woe unto them of whom all men speak well Luke 6.26
; so there is a woe to them that speak well of all men, and of all things,
calling evil good Isa. 5.20
. For, therefore do all men speak well of this hypocrite, because he speaks
so favorably of them. By such charity he falls into Gods Praemunire, who
says, Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
reprove them Ephesians. 5 11
. This man finds no fault with the world, (notwithstanding this charge,) nor
the world with him: but God, with both; but chiefly with the hypocrite, by
whose means, vices are cherished, wicked men hardened, repentance obstructed,
and others more easily drawn into the same course of wickedness, when they see
him that is a great Professor of Religion, defend and countenance it.

He wants grace, that is not sensible of sin: but, he that makes such
senselessness his commendation, does (as the wise man in another case speaks)
exalt folly Prove. 14.29
. He that is not offended at the old man in himself, has no part of the New:
and he that is not offended with vice in the world, has no stock of true
virtue in himself. As a woman not offended with filthy talk and behavior,
cannot be presumed chaste; so he that is not scandalized at the wickedness of
the world, must needs be presumed a friend unto it, and an enemy to God Jam 4.4
. And so much the rather, because he will quickly be sensible of, and highly
offended with any thing that crosses his own particular. No man more
punctilious in things that concern his own honor, profit, or delight, in his
greatest insensiblenesse of the honor of God.

On the contrary, the true Christian is offended, Differ.
wheresoever God is dishonored.

An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous; as, he that is upright in
the way, is an abomination to the wicked Prove. 29.27
. A Christian has so much of the godly nature in him, as makes him not only to
avoid, but to hate the corruptions which are in the world through lust 2 Pet.
1.4
: and, not only corrupt lusts, but corrupt men. Do not I hate them that hate
thee, O Lord? says he, and am not I grieved with those that rise up against
thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies Ps. 139.21.22
. The more like he is unto God, the more perfectly he abhors every false
way. As the Spirit of God did continually strive with the old world till it was
destroyed Genesis 6.3
And the soul of righteous Lot, was vexed with the filthy conversation of the
wicked 2 Pet. 2.7
; so, his soul mourns and cries within him for all the abominations that are
done in the world Ezekiel. 9.4
. He cannot bear the wickedness of the world, although all the world should
rise up against him for it.

But, says the world, is it a weakness to be so apt to take offense? Indeed,
so to be offended as to fall and offend, is a great weakness, yea, a sin; as
he confessed, who said, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipped
Psalm. 73.2
: or, to be offended unnecessarily at that which is no sin, is a weakness, as
he who in weakness of conscience, eats not, and judges him that eats.
But, so to be offended as to condemn evil in others, and to avoid it in
himself, is a point of Christian strength. Christ himself was thus offended at
Peter Mat. 16.23
; and God with the old world, whose wickedness grieved him at the heart so
far, that he resolved to destroy man and beast from the face of the earth
Genesis 6.6, 7
. The Christian therefore accounts it no weakness in him, no dishonor to him,
to be offended at sin wherever he finds it; but, rather prays for such
weakness (as the world calls tenderness of Gods honor) which may make him
more conformable to his Maker.

Thus, this hypocrite had rather offend God, by not taking offense at men for
that wherein they offend God, than not gain applause from men, even with the
dishonor of God: the true Christian had rather offend all the world by taking
offense at the wickedness of it, than be unsensible of the dishonor thereby
done unto God. The one will be a gainer from men, even by that which makes God
a loser; the other will lose all, and himself too, (as to the world) rather
than raise himself a name by such unjust gain.

This hypocrite seems to be offended at evil, and yet is not.

He joyneth in word and in show with them that reprove the evil of the times.
None more loud and clamorous than he (if he light among zealous Ministers or
Christians) to cry out, O Tempora! O Mores! Oh what times! Oh what manners!
But, in action, and affection, he is with them, and of them, that maintain and
increase those evils, as the harlot that carries her self demurely in some
company, that she may elsewhere increase transgressors among men Prove. 23.28
. His Profession ties him to say something against evil, that he may not lose
himself and his reputation with such as are good: but his secret lustings after
evil must not be wholly disappointed, but more cunningly gratified: and
therefore, whatever he says, in time and place where he dares not say other,
he must have his time and place too, where he may do other.

He judges others that do evil as worthy of death; and yet he not only does
the same, but takes pleasure in those that do them Romans 1.32
. He never so exclaimeth against the e^il of the times, but he is ready to make
thereof, when time serves, as much as any ^^her, so far as he durst adventure
the hazard of his credit with men. He could not want that evil in regard of his
lust, which yet he must declaim against, in regard of his reputation. He cries
out against tippling and gaming, when he has lost his money; but will frequent
the same places and go on in the same courses, when he has recruited his
purse, or his pocket, and cannot refrain. O slack hand of Justice* cries he:
and how zealous, Absalom-like 2 Samuel 15.4
, would he be, if he were in Commission! yet he would be loath Justice should be
more quick and strict, lest it should reach him, or lay hold upon his son, or
companion.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian hates evil in his heart, more than he can
declaim against it with his tongue.

Although his tongue be the faithful Interpreter of his heart: yet his tongue
cannot express all the hatred of his heart against evil: because, as the
apprehensions of the mind, so the affections of the heart, are of larger
extent, than can be comprehended in words. Therefore is his soul vexed more
than he can express; so that he is fain to speak by his eyes, as well as by
his tongue. Rivers of waters run down his eyes, because men keep not the Law
Ps. 119.136
. And all too little, to express how much he hates the evil that he is
offended at. Nor is there any evil at which he is not really offended. For he
hates every false way Ver. 104
: yea, every vain thought Ver. 113
.

When he appears before God in prayer, and humiliation for his own sin, he
diggeth as deep into his own heart as he can, to find out all the
deceitfulness that he is able to discover, and prays to be cleansed from
all, even from those sins which are most secretly hid within him, or committed
by him Ps 19.12
. And not only so, but he bears the reproach of the common sins of others. He
confesses the pollutions, not only of his own lips, but of the peoples also. I
am a man of polluted lips, and I dwell among a people of polluted lips Isa. 6.5
. The evil of the times and people among whom he lives, are not only eye-sores
but heart-sores unto him: and the more common the sin, the more he abhors to
be guilty of it, or to continue in it.

And even, when he cannot help it, but is even constrained to be amongst the
wicked, as David, when Saul sought his life, and forced him out of the Confine
of Israel, or at least to shelter himself among such as were as bad as the
worst in the worst parts of the world, he cries out, out of the anguish of his
soul, Woe is me that I sojourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar
Psalm. 120.4
.

And that this is not a copy of his countenance only, or words of course, he
puts his heart upon the trial of God himself, who alone is able to search
and try that to the bottom; Search me, O God, says he, and know my heart; try
me, and know my thoughts, and see if there be any way of wickedness in me Ps.
139 23, 24
: that is, in not hating others in their wicked ways, according to what he had
before professed Ver. 21, 22
.

Thus, this hypocrite runs with the hare, and holds with the hound: cries out
upon sin, to prevent suspicion of his closer iniquities; but likes it well
enough where sin and he can meet in private: the true Christian is a faithful
soldier of Jesus Christ that will hold no secret correspondence with the
enemy against whom he has taken arms in behalf of his Lord, but resolves to
fight him wherever he meets him: the one cries out against sin, not as hating
it, but as the discharge of a piece of Ordnance to give secret warning to the
enemy, to shift out of the way; the other cries out against it, as Paul against
the body of sin, as resolving never to let Christ be quiet, till he rid him of
it R^m. 7.24
.

This hypocrite is offended with every thing, save the evil of sin in
himself.

He seems to be much affected with a mote in his brothers eye; but we hear no
complaint of the beam, in his own Mat. 7.3
. He never calls to his brother to help him to get out the beam, nor does it
himself: but, is very busy with his brothers mote Ver. 4
; not because he hates it as a sin, but because he loves to see something
amiss in another, and to be accounted an enemy to sin, where he meets with
it abroad: for which he is branded for an hypocrite, and taught that lesson
which he never means to take out. Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam that
is in thine own eye: and then shall thou see clearly to cast out the mote that
is in thy brothers eye Ver. 5
.

Nay, there is not an atome, or moat in the Sunbeam that shines upon his
neighbor, but offends him. He has some exception against every word,
gesture, habit, attire, that suits not with his fancy; that a man knows not
how to speak, look, dress himself, or walk, but he must be subject to the
scourge of this man's tongue. He is so sick of the humor of exception, that his
tongue grows too big for his mouth, and needs that one cut away a piece of it,
as Paul cut off occasion from them which seek occasion 2 Cor. 11.12
. He is as a child wantonly brought up, so wayward and peevish, that it is a
trouble to devise how to please him: and the more he perceives men willing to
give him content, the further he is from being pleased. Now, that he finds
himself to be some body, and to be looked upon as Censor morum, a
Master-Corrector of manners, he sets no bounds to his tyranny in this kind.

Sometimes ignorance breeds this humor: for he that walks in the dark
stumbleth at every straw, as he that walks in the night, stumbleth, because
there is no light in him John 11.12
. But, most commonly pride lies at the root of this distemper, and appears in
every branch of it, as ivy about, and above the tree which it has encompassed.
For it seems to him to be a kind of command and lordship, when he, though
never so mean, (and commonly the meaner, the prouder) may take upon him to
judge and condemn all that come in his way, as trespassers against him. It
pleases him well to think that the world begins to veil to his censure, as
bound to follow his judgment, discretion, and fashion; or, he will whip them,
as beggars, about the Town, and lash them double at every Great Man's door, as
appears in the intemperancy which he shows in making capital offenses of
indifferent things.

Contrariwise, the advised Christian is offended with nothing but what is truly
evil. Differ.


If he take offense, it is necessity that puts him upon it. It is not humor,
but conscience; and that not ignorant, and blinded; but, duly informed, which
enforces him to take offense. His charity is such, that he had rather not take
offense, if he could reasonably excuse, or remove what is offensive. He is so
much offended with his own corruption, that he hardly and rarely takes offense
at others. He has not so much time and leisure from his work within doors, to
look curiously abroad after his neighbors faults. He encountreth first his
nearest enemy, and labors to drive the infection from his own heart, before
he look after other men.

He first casts out the beam out of his own eye, that he may see more clearly
to cast out the mote of his brothers eye. He cannot but be offended at sin
wherever he finds it: but no sin receives such hard measure, so sharp a doom
from him as that which he finds in his own bosom, or to have proceeded thence.
He holds it to-be in vain to make war abroad, till the civil and intestine
quarrels be (not composed and quieted by treaty, but) decided by the sword at
home. Therefore her rather takes truce with the world, that he may the better
prosecute and finish his war at home. Have not I a right eye, or, a right
hand Mat. 5.29, 30
, or a foot that offends me Mat. 18.8
? Can I safely undertake any war abroad, before I have cut off these Traitors
(how near and dear soever) at home? The hottest service is at home in his own
Territories, or with borderers upon the Confines. And he had need of peace
abroad, who has such a sharp war at his own doors, yea, within his own
Castle? He remembers that every one shall give account of himself to God Romans
14.12
. And the use to be made of it, which is, therefore not to judge one another
any more Ver. 13
.

Thus, this hypocrite, like Diotrephes, out of love to have the pre-eminence,
takes offense at others for every thing, prating against his betters with
malicious words 3 John 9.10
, is not offended at himself for any thing: the true Christian is much offended
with himself for many things, that he has little mind to busy himself with
the offenses of others, unless they fall so directly in his way that he cannot
balk them: the one says, O! what an evil world is this! the other, O wretched
man that I am Romans 7.24
! The one, while he fights abroad, is undone at home: the other secureth
himself at home, whether he has peace or war abroad.

This hypocrite is sometimes offended at good things.

He must have somewhat to spend his captious humor upon, or it will overflow,
as a river, the neighbour-meadowes, when it should not. He will not perhaps
call that evil, which he, or rather others whom he would observe, do own for
good: but he will pretend that to be evil, which he will not be aknown to be
good. Why have ye not brought him? say the cursed Priests and Pharisees to
their officers, sent to apprehend Christ John 7.45
. And, did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this Name?
say the High Priest and his Council, to the Apostles, continuing, contrary to
their command to preach Christ Acts 5.28
.

Nothing troubles the Politic Hypocrite so much, as the preaching of that
which will diminish his greatness, authority, and profit; as the preaching of
Christ did, the power and office of the High Priest and of all that depended
upon him: and derogated from the worth of their own righteousness, who sought
Justification by it. Otherwise Jesus might have been quiet enough, especially
after he was laid in his grave: but this was the great business that made this
precious cornerstone Isa. 28.16
, a stumbling stone, and a rock of offense Romans 9.33
, to so many in Israel: as it does still to the Roman Antichrist, and his
Adherents: to him, because the preaching of Christ in the simplicity of the
Gospel, suits not with, but bids battle to his Antichristian usurpation, and
revenues: and to his Adherents, for now, as the Pope and his factors have used
the matter, if they be not justified or saved by their own works, by whom else
shall it be done, seeing by seeking righteousness by the works of the Law,
they have let go Christ, and chosen the curse Gal. 3.10
.

The Profane hypocrite, and the Libertine, they take offense, and are much
scandalized, that there should be so much preaching, so much zeal for the
strict observation of the Sabbath, against petty oaths, merry jests, etc. two
Sermons in a day, and no pastime; private exercises and duties in the family
besides: so much purity, temperance, tasting, praying; What need the Preacher
be so plain, so particular? to follow the point of hypocrisy so far, as to
find out me and to lay me open before all my neighbors? Good things must have
their place, says he, but there is reason in all things.

He imagines every Sermon, and every note to be made, raised, and prosecuted
against him. Every Text, Psalm, Phrase, chosen and picked out to be levelled
and shot at him. It is hard to speak or do any thing at which a guilty or
captious conscience will not stumble. And it is no marvel to see him (that was
never good) to take offense at good: seeing unto such the very Gospel is an
offense, the Cross a scandal, and Christ, himself a stumbling block 1 Cor. 1.23
: and he is a rare, and blessed man that is not offended in him Luke 7.23
. This is called scandalum Pharisaicum: for, thus, the Pharisees were
ordinarily offended: wild plants, that were to be rooted up: weeds that say to
the Gardener, why tread you so hard upon me?

But happily, this hypocrite bewrays not at all times the offense he takes. It
is enough for a proud peevish Michal 2 Samuel, 6.20
, not to be able to hold her tongue. He is of a more dissembling temper: so as
sometimes he will smoothly commend that at which he is offended, in hope he may
take off suspicion of guilt of that which is reproved; and say, You do well,
Sir, to reprove sin; It is your office: and, never more need. Gods blessing on
your heart, etc. Thus he says, when he holds it not for his ease, credit or
interest, to break out: yet, inwardly he fretteth, and snuffeth at it. I was
never so told mine own, never so taken up. I like not this rough and course
language under the name of plain dealing.

On the contrary, the Christian builds on that, Differ.
at which others stumble.

He bu ldeth not upon the sand of imaginary good Mat. 7.26
; but, upon the Rock which is a sure foundation Is^. 2^.16
. When others fall at that precious cornerstone, he rises Luke 2.34
. That which is cast asi^e of others, is to him the head of the corner 1 Pet.
2.7
. He finds life and strength in that which weakeneth the old man in him: and
is offended at nothing but what offends God. He is so far from quarrelling,
that he blesses God for the plenty of his Word Ps. 147.19, 20
. And that preaching that comes most home and close to the special corruptions
of his heart, is so far from exasperating, that it makes him to fall down, and
worship God, and report that God is in such a Ministry indeed 1 Cor. 14.25
. Yea, he will pray for such handling, as for a kindness; and for such
reproof, as for a precious oil that shall not break his head Psalm. 141.5
, but heal his heart.

As for the strictest sanctification of the Sabbath, care of his conversation,
conscience in recreations, all is little enough, and comes short of that
watchfulness which the expectation of Christ's second coming has fixed upon
his spirit as necessar^ unto him that truly (and as he ought) looks for and
hasteneth to the coming of the day of God 2 Pet. 3.12
. The company of such as fear God is his greatest joy ^sal. 119.63
; for such he p^ayeth Ver. 79
: to such he extends all the fruits of his dearest love, as to the excellent
upon earth Psalm, 16.3
. He looks on those that are more than ordinarily careful of their carri^ge,
diligent in prayer, and in their affairs, swift to hear, etc. as those that
are a degree nearer to heaven and to God, than himself; and, as special
incitements to quicken him to run the way of Gods Commandments, with more speed
and care.

Thus, this hypocrite takes offense at that which should be his Crown: the true
Christian is offended at nothing but what ought to be his shame: the one is
angry at goodness, because himself is evil; the other abhors evil, because
himself is made good.

This hypocrite is most offended with the falls and imperfections of
Professors.

If other men, openly profane and wicked, fall never so foully and frequently,
he can pass by that with half the noise and clamor which he makes against the
godly overtaken with a fault Gal. 6.1
. He can bear evil well enough in him that makes it his trade, but he can by no
means brook it in him in whom it is but a slip: not because it is a dishonor
to Religion, but because he is secretly glad of the occasion to speak evil of
others that profess it, that so he may seem the better Christian who is not so
defiled, and appears so zealous against such defilements. He aggravateth
their eclipse, that he may shine the more.

And, if he do not impute the fault to their Profession, as profane wretches
do; yet he charge it upon their hypocrisy: as they who being adulteresses
themselves, are most apt to charge the same fault upon others who deserve not
so to be charged. The truth is, he sees perhaps that the other has out-shone
him, and is in better esteem among the godly, than himself. Therefore he is now
glad at heart to see him down, that he may trample upon him, and point at him
so, that all may take notice of himself as being the better of the two. And the
greater the fall of the other is, the more advantage he makes of it to himself;
not to be more watchful over himself as he is commanded 1 Cor. 10.12
: but only to trample on the other, which is forbidden 1 Cor. 5.2
.

Yea, he so exclaimeth against the least slips of Professors, that he sticks
not to tell it in Gath, and to publish it in the streets of Askelon, causing
the very boys and girls of the Philistines to rejoice, and the uncircumcised
to triumph 2 Samuel 1.20
; that so he may call in the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme his Name and
Gospel: whereas true love would cover all sins Prove. 10.12
, so as not to blaze them before such as will rather rejoice in the disgrace of
Religion, than mourn for the occasion of that dishonor. In a word, he so
insulteth, and stirs up so many others as he can to do the like, as if he
aimed, not to restore him that is fallen, but to order the matter so, that he
that is down, shall rise no more.

Nor does he content himself thus to take offense at real offenses of the
godly, but he is as clamorous and bitter against them for imagined aberrations
that suit not with his humor and fancy; forsaking the Assemblings and
fellowship of the Saints, and excommunicating himself, because he cannot cast
out whom he will, and what he will. And, in the mean time none so partial to
himself not only in doubtful things, but in things notoriously wicked and
loathsome, nourishing gross sins in himself from the examples of the falls of
the Saints departed. Was not, says he, Noah, drunken? Lot, incestuous? David,
adulterous? Peter, guilty of lying, and swearing to confirm his lie? I hope I
do no worse than those that have been accounted holy and good men. This he can
plead for himself: but* no sacrifice is, in his opinion, sufficient to expiate
far less sins and infirmities in other Professors that live in the same age
with him: no shame is too much to be cast upon them. A plain argument of great
partiality, and of much Pharisaical hypocrisy.

Differ.
Contrarily, the true Christian is more careful to cover, than to carp at the
imperfections of brethren.

He will not palliate or patronize the least sin in any, but, faithfully, and
in the spirit of meekness, endeavor to bring them to a due sight and sense
thereof, and then to restore them Gal. 6.1
: Otherwise, he is neither willing to make them known to others, nor (if it be
possible, without making himself blind) to see them himself. He will rather
cast a garment upon their nakedness, going backward Genesis 9.23
. He turns his face from the infirmities of his brother, that he may keep his
heart still toward him. What love may do in covering sin, shall not be
wanting; provided he be not wanting to his brother, in rebuking him plainly,
and not so suffering sin upon him, as thereby to bear the guilt of his brothers
sin upon his own shoulders Lev. 19.17
.

He knows the Law is not chargeable with the Malefactors sin; nor he,
excuseable by the examples of better men than himself. He looks upon their
virtues, not their vices, for his imitation: and, if they have fallen, he eyes
their repentance, not their falls: that he may be encouraged to imitate, not
their stumblings, but their risings again. Their falls shall be his warnings,
not his patterns; his humbling, not his insulting; his grief, not his warrant;
his shame, not his triumph. He looks upon their falls, as lessening him that
thinks he stands, to take heed lest he fall 1 Cor. 10.12
.

If there be some tares in the Lords field he does not presently forsake it as
being the devils field: if some scandals be in the Congregation, he does not
conclude, that, the Church, but the envious man has done this Mar. 13, 28
: therefore he does not presently forsake the assembly, as the manner of some
is Heb. 10.25
: but rather bears with patience, and bewailes with grief, what he is not able
to reform. He knows it to be both impossible, to pull up all tares, without
doing more wrong than good to the wheat; and therefore looks upon that as a
thing forbidden Mat. 13.29
. He looks upon that as a work reserved for the Angels, at the end of the
world. Then, and not till then, by them, and not by us, shall the Lord gather
out of his Kingdom all things that offend (or, are scandals) and them that
work iniquity Ver. 41
.

Thus, this hypocrite quarrelleth at others, not to humble them; but, by
treading on their b^cks, to exalt himself: the true Christian is so scandalized
at the falls of others, that he rather desires to lay himself lower than he
would lay them: the one is content to build a castle for sin, in himself, upon
the rubbish of other men's failings; the other seeing the falls of other men's
buildings, labors to build upon a more firm foundation.

This hypocrite is offended, upon his own imagination of the offensivenesse of
others.

He that is pur-blinde is apt to be jealous: and, the more blind, and
base-minded himself, the more jealous of others. An hypocrite is ever (...) one
that that cannot see afar off; if not (...), stark blind 2 Pet. 1.9
. Therefore he is very suspicious of every thing, and will fight with his own
shadow, rather than want somewhat to fight withal. Even he that would be taken
to be a very good Christian, cannot endure any that go beyond him in zeal or
duty. These pure ones, says he, are the veryest hypocrites, the most covetous,
and most uncharitable people in the world. They talk religiously, but they live
deceitfully: they seem to outstrip others in zeal, but come behind them in
common honesty.

But ask him, whom he means by those pure ones, or why so called, or what
grounds he has to make good his charge of such imputations? there he sticks:
and the best he has to say for himself to them to whom he accuses the godly,
and that demand a reason of the accusation, is but this; if he were not a
malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee John 18.30
. He is a monster by hearsay; and that is enough for him that has a mind to
receive an evil report against his neighbor Psalm. 15.3
, to blast him; and, to be as afraid of him, as the Israelites were afraid of
the sons of Anak, upon the bare report of a company of cowardly Spies Number.
14.1, etc.
.

He will not let God himself alone; but, as Papists usually do, he conceives
false and impious opinions of God, of his Decrees, Works, and Ways; and then
charge them upon his brethren; as Papists charge Calvin, to make God the
Author of sin, and guilty of Stoicisme, and fatality that imposes a necessity
of damnation upon millions of men doing what they can to be saved, that good
works are not to be done, that there is no liberty left to man's will in any
thing, and such like, which are only figments of his own, and conclusions, or
rather absurdities falsely drawn from true doctrines that will not down with
him. For, what godly and Orthodox Christian ever taught, or did not both abhor,
and refute such impieties?

If he can pick out any blasphemy of a frantic Familist, or fury of a bloody
Anabaptist, or impiety of a wild Libertine, he charge all these upon those
who first discovered such monsters, and raised the hue and cry against the
Parents of them. If he do but conceit those who excel him in true Piety, to be
guilty of these, or of any of these, he will as confidently charge them, as if
he could prove the Indictment by a thousand witnesses. He is sure they teach
such things, or are of that opinion. So he looks upon a faithful Minister, a
conscionable Professor (that differ from him in opinion) as a bug-beare, or
monster, gives him out to be a dangerous man to converse withal: although he
cannot prove the things whereof he does accuse them Acts 24.13
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the true Christian dares not to wrong any man, by taking offense
at him upon presumption.

The devil shall have his due: and, report must bring forth her proofs, if she
will have credit with him. He is not suspicious; and therefore will not receive
an evil report (while it is but a report) against his neighbor Psalm. 15.3
. He knows the devil is malicious, and infuseth a thousand lies into the
heads of not only evil, but good-men, (if weak) against the godly; that it is
his trade to be the accuser of the brethren Rev. 12.10
. not only unto men, but even unto God himself (who knows his lies) day and
night Rev. 12.10
. He will not therefore be light of belief to hold, much less to proclaim them
guilty of all that either evil, or good men lay to their charge. He will not
say, as those wicked men that desired to blast Jeremiah for his faithfulness,
to any Calumniator, Report, and I will report it Jer. 20.10
: do thou but say to me, he did, or said such a thing, and let me alone to ring
it up and down the country: but he has learned another lesson, Against an
Elder to receive no accusation, but under two or three witnesses 1 Timothy 5.19
. nor against any man professing godliness, to hearken to a talebearer Exodus
23.1
. He that will believe the lying world, shall be sure to condemn the generation
of the righteous.

If he be to deal with Papists, he will not do as they do by us, bringing their
own hirelings to bear false witness against Luther, Calvin, and others, and
object a fame of their own raising; but, he will urge against them their own
mouths, and writings only against them: not wire-drawn deductions from them;
but their own terms, and positions positively expressed in their own writings;
or that, which experience (not report only) has made notoriously known. There
is nothing that he is more afraid of than want of charity: and, nothing whereof
he is more jealous, than that his charity should be abused by evil reports
against his brethren.

Thus, this hypocrite cares not how weak his proofs be, so his imagination be
strong: the true Christian cares not how strong his imagination be, if the
proofs be weak; the one is resolved to take offense without cause, rather than
not quarrel; the other resolves against taking offense, that he may not
quarrel without cause.

This hypocrite, offended at Providence, casts the fault upon virtue.

Had not I been so strict and zealous, says he, I had never raised so many
enemies against my self. If the go^ly suffer affliction, he concludes, it had
been better for them they had complied more with the world. Their zeal, is by
him accounted their indiscretion. Had they been content to have done as their
neighbors do, they might have lived as quietly as other men, and as free from
trouble. Is not this thy fear, thy confidence Job 4.6
, says he, in an upbraiding way, to him whom he ought to comfort in his
affliction? He says that proud men a^e more happy than the humble; that they
that work wickedness are set up, when suc^ as work righteousness are kept low
enough; yea, that they who tempt God, are delivered Mal. 3.15
, when such as fear God still lie under oppression and misery. Hereupon he is
scandalized at all duties of Religion, all exercises of Piety; concluding, that
it is in vain to serve God, that there is no profit in keeping his Ordinances,
nor any thing to be gotten by walking mournfully before him Ver. 14
: and, that Providence has decided the cause against those that are
over-strict in a religious course, as being too blame for so doing.

Differ.
On the contrary, the true Christian, keeping his grounds, is both a friend to
virtue, and a subject to Providence.

He measures not duty by the present success. He makes not Providence in
rewarding, but the Word directing, to be the rule of his actions. He is
satisfied in this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works are in the
hand of God: that no man knows either love or hatred by all that is before
him. That all things come alike to all, in this world: in which respect, there
is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, to the good and to the clean,
and to the unclean, to him that sacrifices, and to him that sacrifices not:
as is the good, so is the sinner: and he that swears, as he that fears an
oath Eccl. 9.1, 2
. The difference is, for the most part, to be made hereafter. The sheep and the
goats do here feed together: and the goats for the most part, are too hard for
the sheep. The separation is reserved till the Judge of all divides his sheep
from the goats Mat. 25.32
.

If the present face of things offer difficulty, too hard for him to master, he
goes further; and, by the light of the Sanctuary, understands the different
ends both of things, and men P^. 73.16, 17
. By this means he clears, and reconcileth that which otherwise would be too
painful for him. He cleaves to virtue for the present, and looks for
success hereafter. For so he is instructed, to say to the righteous, it shall
be well with him: for there is a time coming wherein he shall eat of the fruit
of his doings Isa. 3.10
. And, that though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and that his days be
prolonged: yet surely he knows that it shall be well with them that fear
God, which fear before him; but, it shall not be well with the wicked, neither
shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow; because he fears not before
God Eccl. 8.12, 13
.

If iniquity prevail he leaves Gods hidden judgments to himself, if it
concern others, who truly fear God; yet, go to the wall. As for him, he is not
ashamed to cleave to the losing side, having evidence of their sincerity. For
(as he said) victa Catoni; much more it may be said, victa Davidi. His faith
looks to the Word of God, rather than to his hand: and, he interprets the
Work by the Word, not the Word by the Work. He finds that Gods dealing with
his children has many reservations; and that he entertaineth them here not
only with the waters of consolation, but with the rod of correction: and, that
a beating is sometimes better for them than a breakfast. Not that he delights
in chiding, much less in fighting: but, that they compel him to that wherein
he takes no pleasure, that he may not keep his anger for ever Psalm. 103.9
.

Thus, this hypocrite will take any occasion to quarrel that grace which he
loves not, that he may more freely live in that sin which his heart is set
upon: the true Christian that dares not to tell a lie for God Job
, will stick fast to that grace which meets with hardest measure in the world:
the one seeks to fasten that upon piety, which it has not deserved: the other
gives God the glory, although piety be not at present rewarded according to his
expectation: the one is for no pater noster, if no penny: the other is for
duty, whether rewarded or not.

CHAP. XXXVII. The Conclusion.
WE have spoken of several sorts of hypocrites, and marks of hyprocrisie. What
remains, but to make an end? And what fitter end, than to see their end? The
Holy Ghost gathers, Job 8.13
all into a short sum, the hypocrites hope shall perish (a): Job 8.13
importing, that even the hypocrite has some hope; but such, as shall perish,
and himself with it. The wicked, says Solomon, works a deceitful work Prove.
11.18
. He is not altogether idle; but, his work deceives him. He relieth on
deceitful grounds: and is carried by deceitful hopes. He believes not that he
erreth by vanity. He that is most deceived, is most apt to trust that most
which will deceive him more. Therefore vanity shall be his recompense Job 15.31
. The vanity of misery shall overtake all those who have deceived themselves
with the vanity of sin.

The hypocrites hope is compared to the Spiders web Job 8.14
: which is very curious, but slender: fitter to deceive others, than to benefit
himself. The thread is very fine, but weak. His web shall not become garments,
neither shall he cover himself (so, as to secure himself) with his works:
because his work, at best, is but a work of iniquity Isa. 59.6
. It is all woven out of his own bowels: that is, out of his own conceit and
imagination. The Workman and his Workmanship are all of one: for the hypocrites
hope is not from above, as every good and perfect gift is Jam. 1.17
; but, of his own making. Take notice of but some part of his Workmanship,
whereby it is easy to judge of the rest. I shall not accurately observe the
former method in ranging of hypocrites, but touch upon some few of those which
I next meet with in my way.

He hops that, whatever men talk, the Lord will neither do good, neither will
he do evil Zeph. 1.1.2
; that there is neither heaven nor hell; perhaps neither God nor devil: no such
matter as a day of judgment: that Preachers take a pride to skare men, (for it
is impossible he should do as he does, if he otherwise believed). This is the
hope of the Profane Hypocrite, profane in the highest degree, and frozen in the
dregs of sin. But, he shall find that, verily there is a reward for the
righteous: verily he is a God that judges in the earth; that so strangely
finds out, and punishes the most secret sins of hypocrites, making their
own sin to find them out Number. 32 23
.

He hops, if there be a Judgment, yet that the God of mercy will be more
merciful, than to cast a man, yea, a world of men, away everlastingly, for
small matters. God is a friend to mankind, and therefore will not be an
implacable enemy to good-fellowes that mean God no harm, although they be a
little merry; but will rather bear with every man in his humor: with the young
man in his intemperance, with the old man in his gripplenesse, with the rich
man in his idleness, with the poor man in his thievishnesse, etc. Every sinner
is willing to imagine that God is like him Psalm. 50.21
; though he be an enemy to the sins of others. This is the hope of the
Presumptuous Hypocrite, (as indeed every hypocrite is presumptuous) that says
in his heart, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine
heart, to add drunkenness to thirst Deuteronomy. 29.19
. But, he shall find that God will wound the head of his enemies, and the
hairy scalp of such an one as goes on still in his trespasse^ Psalm. 68 21
: that the Lord will not be merciful unto him, that thus abuses mercy; but
that the anger of the Lord, and his jealousy shall smoke against such a man,
and that all the curses that are written in his book shall lie upon him Deuteronomy.
29.20
; and, he shall know whose words shall stand, Gods, or his Jer. 44.28
.

He hops that God will not (for shame) condemn one that all men speak well
of. And, as for men, let him alone, as in life, so in death, to be aknown of
nothing that may tend to his discredit. He will bite all in, when he comes to
die, save only in the general he will confess he is a very great sinner (but
you shall never hear him to confess wherein): and so he will steal a death;
yea, and a damnation too, (that his neighbors at present shall not know of:)
because he will not give glory to God by confessing his sins as God requires:
he professes repentance without repenting; and confession without confessing.
This is the hope of the plausible or popu^ar hypocrite. But he shall find that
there is a woe denounced by the Lord of life against all those, of whom all men
speak well Luke 16.26
; because that which is highly esteemed amongst men (as namely his sinful
compliance with them in all things) is abomination in the sight of God Luke
16.15
: that, his own evil words may condemn him Mat. 12.37
; but, the good words of others shall never save him.

He hops he has done God no wrong. Happily he has neglected some works of
mercy, or justice toward men: but, what is Christ the worse for that? Had
Christ been on earth, and wanted any thing, he should not have been unsupplied:
he would have stripped himself to his shirt rather than Christ should have
wanted. Therefore he cannot believe that ever he shall be called to account for
neglecting Christ, because he has perhaps not done so much for a company of
poor neggarly peevish men, that let him do what he will for them, are never
thank^ul, never contented. But, as for Christ, he dares (at least he thinks he
dares) to appeal to himself, Lord, when saw I thee an hungered, or a thirst, or
a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee
Mat. 25.44
? This is the hope of the religious hypocrite, that pretending some care of the
first Table, neglects the second. But he shall find that what is omitted
toward man, especially toward Christ's own sheep, is detracted from Christ,
who will give him this answer, Verily in as much as thou did it not to one of
the least of these, thou did it not to me Ver. 45
. Christ will before all the world, declare, and adjudge himself to be
neglected, where the meanest member of his body is not supplied: and that he is
of a murtherous mind who thinks much to be his brothers Keeper Genesis 49
. If he forbear to deliver them (when it is in his power) that are (without
cause) drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain, and then, think
it enough, to say, behold, I knew it not: does not he that pondereth the heart,
consider it? and he that keeps thy soul, does not he know it? and shall not
he render to every man according to his works Pro. 24.11, 12
? He that keeps him, looks he should not only not kill, but preserve others
within his power.

He hops to be saved for his good meaning: for though he has not been so
careful as he should to know and serve God so exactly as he ought; yet he means
as well, and loves God as well as the best of them all; and though he know not
so much as others, yet he has as good an heart to God, as they that make more
show of learning and knowledge: therefore hops God will not punish him for
his ignorance, and for want of that knowledge which he never gave him. He was
never book-learned; nor did his friends ever bring him up unto it. This is the
hope of the ignorant hypocrite.

But he shall find that ignorance is no small sin. For, when the Lord Jesus
Christ shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels in flaming fire,
he shall take vengeance on them that know not God 2 These. 1.7, 8
, and that where he meets with a people of no understanding, he that made them
will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will show them no favor
Isa. 27.11
. And he shall be made to know, that even invincible ignorance is a branch, (or
fruit at least) of original sin. For God made man righteous Eccl. 7.29
, therefore every way perfect in body and mind, that he might do righteous
things to God and himself, as well as to others. How much more then shall
ignorance affected, with contempt of the means; yea, contracted and forced as
it were upon himself, by causing the light of nature that is in him, even after
the fall, to become darkness; winking with his eye, that he may not see the
light that shines round about him Mat. 13.15
, be laid to his charge, and he, condemned for it!

He hops to be saved for his just dealing. He wrongeth no man, does as he
would be done by; pays every man his own; renders to every man his due;
takes no forfeitures; extorts not from any man; but rests contented with
what the Law allows, or awardeth. This is the hope of the Moral, and Civil
Hypocrites, who think they have a better title to Heaven by their fair and just
carriage, than the rest of their neighbors that cannot show so much honest
dealing, although perhaps they may make a greater show in outward Profession.

But he shall find that the Law of God is not divided; and that God will not
be served by halves, nor come to a composition with the hypocrite, so as to
dispense with his piety and duty to God, on condition he be just to men: and
that justice, without piety has no reward: for as much as the Lord requires
of him not only to do justly, and to love mercy, but to walk humbly with his
God Mic 6.8
: that there is not only no high place in heaven, but not so much as any
entrance thither for such as refuse, slight, or wilfully neglect any part of
obedience to any part of Gods revealed Will Mat. 7.21
; yea, though it were such a personal injunction as that to the young man, that
made show of a desire to do more than all, Go sell that thou have, and give it
to the poor Mat. 19.21
; if God call him to it. The Pharisee paid not only debts, but tyths even of
the smallest commodities Luke 18.12
: yet, he that will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, must exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees Mat. 5.20
. For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is
guilty of all Jam. 1.10
: because, had he made conscience of any, he would have kept all with like care
that he kept some.

He hops that every man may be saved in that Religion which he professes, be
it what it will, (not excluding an honest heathen): And, that God will not
stand much upon the form of Worship, so his Deity and Power be acknowledged.
This is the hope of the Superstitious Hypocrite, who makes falsehood his
refuge, and is hid under vanity Isa. 28.15
. But he shall find, that they that are without Christ, are without God in the
world: and therefore without hope Ephesians. 2.12
of the world to come. That as there is but one Mediator between God and man,
the man Christ Jesus 1 Timothy 2.5
; neither is there salvatinn in any other: for there is no other name under
Heaven, given among men, whereby they must be saved Act. 4.12
.

He hops that Christ will take acquaintance of them who have prophesied, and
done him good service in his Church, and perhaps have wrought miracles in his
Name Mat. 7.22
, that he will not refuse to own such as have been hearers of his Word, and
Communicants Luke 13.26
, especially if they have received the Sacrament fasting, and upon a
good friday, or the like, in such or such an habit, with such and such gestures
of devotion (perhaps of superstition): or have received it monthly, weekly,
with rudeness enough under pretense of keeping close to Christ's Institution
(albeit they never truly knew, nor care to be informed what that was): if they
be Professors, who have said Lord, Lord, not Lady, Lady, as Papists do. Such
are the Hopes of the Preaching, the Hearing, the Praying Hypocrites. But such
shall find the door shut upon them, and receive one common answer, I tell you,
I know not whence ye are. Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity Ver. 27
. They that pretend to know and serve Christ; but, only in their own way, are
not unknown to him; but, he will never own them, but lead them out with the
workers of iniquity Psalm. 125.5
.

He hops he has somewhat to say, and to show for himself, at least a Talent
in a Napkin Luke 19.20
, or hidden in the earth Mat. 25.18
, where he would be sure not to lose it, but to find it whenever it shall be
called for. Although he preach not so often, and so profitably as some others
that are (in his account) homines trium literarum, not worthy to carry his
books, yet he has more learning than twenty of them, by his own telling. And
if he be found fault withal, for doing little or nothing. He pleads for
himself, let me alone with my little, as I do you with your much. I am none of
the worst: I should know what I have to do better than you: and hope to have a
place in heaven, as well as you. At least that which I do not now, may be done
hereaf er, and, that which I have not now, may come hereafter: repentance, or
what else I need. Such are the hopes of the Stinted, and Repenting, or rather
Intending Hypocrite.

But such shall find that the Lord looks not only for his Principal, but for
increase and advantage Luke 19.23
: that he that lets his stock lie still, makes his Lord a loser, because he
has not emproved that, by which he might have been a gainer: that as many
barren Christians go to hell, as others that abound in wickedness; that Christ
will reckon not only with those that have done evil, but with those that have
done no good, and that it will not suffice them to plead, we have lived
harmlessely, done no man wrong, never extorted, never committed adultery Luke
18.12
etc. and that others, who have done all these wickednesses, and repented, shall
fare better* and that Publicans and Harlots shall go into the Kingdom before
them Mat. 21.31
: that he that grows not, that bettereth not in grace, that bears not much
fruit, glor^fieth not God, neither can be Christ's disciple John 15.8
: and that he that promises himself repentance without Gods warrant, must be
his own Play Master, and with Esau, shall find himself rejected and no place for
repentance will be found in him that has been delayed and slighted by the
h^pocrite, to give him repentance afterward, or the blessing desired* though
he seek it with tears Heb. 12.17
.

These, and many other ^uch like are the Cob-webs which these Spiders frame for
themselves. But when the besome of destruction comes, it will easily sweep
down all at once Isa. 14.23
. The hypocrite is a rush growing in the mire Job 8.11
: for the time he stands up like a spear; But when the mire is dried up and
gone, it turns into a straw. He shall not come before God Job 13 16
. Not that he shall not appear at his Judgment Seat 2 Cor. 5.10
; but that he shall not stand in the judgment P^al. 1.5
, as one acquitted, as he sheep on the right hand; but, as the goats, on the
left. God will not bid him welcome, but reprove him and set his sins in order
before his eyes, and then tear him in pieces, and there shall be none to
deliver Ps. 50.21, 22
.

His branch shall not be green Job 15.32
, but shall be cut off before his day. His eyes shall fail, his refuge shall
perish, and his hope shall be sorrow of mind even as the giving up of the
Ghost Job 11 20
. As the whirlwind passes away, so is the wicked no more Prove. 10.25
. When he dies his hope perishes Prove. 11.7.
For what is the hope of the hypocrite t^ough he has gain d, (and made as good
a mercate, and as much advantage of his hypocrisy in the things of the word as
h s heart could wish) when God shall take away his soul? Will God hear his cry,
when trouble comes upon him Job 27.7, 8
? He fades away in his ways, as the grass, or flower; So soon as the Sun is
risen upon it with a burning heat Jam. 1.11
He is as the chafe P^al. 1.4
, not in a calm, but before the wind in a storm. His light shall not only be
put out, but i^ shall go out, like the snuff of a candle Prove. 24.20
, which leaves not only darkness, but a st^nk behind it.

There is no hypocrite, never so wicked, but has one v^in hope or other, to
keep him from judging t uly, and redressing seasonably his dangerous estate.
While there is hope, he sees no danger in his course. When once he is sensible
of the danger, the remedy comes too late: His hope turns into desperation; his
confidence, into confusion. The snow at first makes a fair show, but when it
is melted it makes dangerous floods: so the Profession of hypocrites for
awhile is very pleasing to behold, (till the hypocrisy be discovered) but it
ends in shame to him, and in grief to others.

It is a foolish resolution to say; I hope well: and, as foolish a ground for
any man to lay, Hope well, and have well. There are more hopes, and hopers in
hell, than in heaven. None but an hypocrite will be offended at the taking away
these false hopes and comforts. Better the hope perish, and the man safe, than
both be swept away together into perdition. It is but an exchange of hopes
whereto he is exhorted: and all this labor is spent to persuade him to be
content to take true and certain hopes for these staves of reed, that will both
break, and pierce him that leans on them. It is not the strength of the man,
but the weakness of the building, and the weight of sin that makes the
hypocrite like Sampson: for, leaning upon the house of his own building, he
brings it down upon his own head. It is an house to destroy him, not to save
him: a Shambles, not a Sanctuary.

When we say, hope well, and have well, the first well, must not be a Noune,
but an Adverb: for, as one says well, there is much divinity in Adverbs. To
hope for good is common to all that wish well to themselves. But, to hope in a
good manner, distinguishes a child of God from an Hypocrite. I will trust in
God, says Job, though he slay me: but, I will reprove mine own ways before
him: so shall he be my salvation: for the hypocrite shall not come before him
Job 13.15, 16
. He only can boldly say, I have hoped for thy salvation, O Lord, that can
truly say, I have done thy Commandments Ps. 119.166
. He alone that unfeinedly denies ungodliness and worldly lusts, and lives
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, may indeed look for (and
not be disappointed of) that blessed hope and glorious appearance of the Great
God, and our Savior Jesus Christ Tit. 2.12, 13.
.

As for those that will needs comfort themselves (whether God will or not) with
vain hopes, let every one of them know that though in his conceit, he mount up
to heaven, and his head reaches unto the clouds, yet he shall perish for ever
like his own dung Job 20.6, 7
. Job 15.20, 21, 23
He is as one that travelleth with child: for he travelleth with pain all his
days, after he is once detected. A dreadful sound is in his ears; in his
prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him: and he knows that the day of
darkness is ready at his hand. Early or late, he shall acknowledge himself to
be of all men most miserable. For as his sin is double, so is his portion of
wrath increased. He shovels up wrath upon himself by heaps Job 36.13
. He is the chief Tenant in hell: and all other sinners in comparison of him,
are but Underlings and Inmates. Hell is the hypocrites portion, and other
sinners shall have theirs with him Mat. 24.51
.

Wherefore let all carefully purge this Colloquintida out of the pot. Let true
fear exp^l false hopes, that there may be place for found comfort. Take heed
thine own heart deceive thee not Deuteronomy. 11.16
: there is no Impostor or Jugler like to that Jer. 17.9
. Nothing is so dangerous as groundless hope; no, not despair. For, that
serves to awaken men, whereas false hope lulls them asleep. He that is blind,
is sooner in the pit, than he that is at the brink, and sees. Blessed is the
man that fears always Prove. 28.14
: for, true fear, ends in saving hope. But woe be unto him that vainly hops,
for such hope ends in fear. The evil which is not feared shall fall on the
wicked; and when they begin to fear it, it shall be unavoidable. But he that
is not deceived with such hopes shall not be surprised with such fears.

He whose spirit is free from guile, his hope shall never make him ashamed. It
is an hope full of immortality, and shall make him an everlasting foundation
Prove. 10.25
. One and the same day shall verify both the one and the other. That which
being yet not seen, yet believed and hoped for, makes him to rejoice with joy
unspeakable and full of glory 1 Pet. 1.8.
: what then shall be the joy of the fruition of the hope laid up for him in
heaven Col. 1.5.
!

Even so, do well, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that be upright
in their hearts. But, as for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, them,
Lord, lead forth with the workers of iniquity; but let peace be upon Israel
Psalm. 125.4, 5
. Amen.

weeds of daily infirmities Eclipsing saving Grace, From The Reigning Sins of

CANT. 1.5. I am black, but comely.

LONDON, Printed for Adoniram Byfeild at the three Bibles in Cornhill, next

THE Second Part
CHAP. I. The PREFACE.
WE have seen the Hypocrite in white. Now we are to behold the Christian in
black. The Hypocrite in white is yet deformed. The Christian in black is yet
comely and well-favoured. The Hypocrite at his best, is worse than any
Christian: The Christian at his worst, is better than any Hypocrite.

The dear Spouse of Christ (of which every sincere Christian makes a member)
while she lives in this world is subject to many spots and blemishes; yea, to
be be-smutted and becollied all over, that she appears outwardly black. This,
the daughters of Jerusalem, her frien^s, and companions, Professors not yet
thoroughly resolved, (and, some of them hypocrit^s) gaze upon, and take scandal
at. To them therefore, she is compelled to apologize for her self, and so must
every Christian for himself, I am black, but comely Cant. 1.5
.

If any o^ject her blackness in her outward hue, she ingenuously confesses
it. But withal, she avoucheth Gods workmanship in her Ephesians. 2.10
, in a better and more essential part of beauty than color, which is,
comeliness, favor, and feature, that makes Christ himself to delight in her,
and to desire after her as much as she does or can desire after him. I am
comely, says she, that is amiable and desirable (...) from (...)
. There is somewhat in me, for all this blackness, that Christ discerns and
loves in me, which makes him to desire me. Therefore look not upon me because
I am black Cant. 1.6
. If you look upon me only for my blackness, you may look off, and spare that
labor. But if you will look upon me because I am black, then look with Christ's
eyes: so shall you find somewhat else beside blackness in me, namely a lovely
comeliness which has ravished the heart of Christ my husband Cant. 4.9
, through his comeliness which he has put upon me Ezekiel. 16.14
. We must therefore look upon the one, as well as the other, if we will do
right to her, or to our selves.

The Church, and so every Christian, is black, partly through the remainders of
sin, mortified in part, but not thoroughly abolished: partly through the
blasting of Satan's temptations; as wind or buffeting Jer. 8.21
setleth the blood in the face, and makes it black: partly through afflictions
(for, black is the color of mourners, and the emblem of sadness Mal. 3.14
. These do denigrare and turn the clear fountain into a troubled or corrupt
Spring Pro. 25.26
. Hence Nilus is called Sihor Jer. 2.18
: that is, black, by reason of the troubled waters. Yea, afflictions make a man
as a brand, or black cole pulled out of the fire Zech. 3.2
. Yea, sometimes she is black through much prosperity, Sunburned, as the Church
confesses; the Sun had lo^ked upon her Cant. 1.6
. Sunshine, though it be comfortable, yet too much of it tanneth, and makes
swart: so riches and abundance do sometimes smut a child of God, and make him
look so like a black earth-worm, that they can hardly be discerned the one from
the other. And, it not seldom happens that some Christians more than others,
are smutted and rendered more uncomely outwardly through natural defects and
infirmities incident to the body, or perturbations and passions of the mind.

By this it appears, that a Christian has ways more than enough to make him
black. Yet being a Christian, he is comely. For, he is perfectly beautiful in
Christ, by the grace of Justification, which makes him white as snow, and as
the wool Isa. 1.18
. This being the grant to the Lambs wife, to be arrayed in fine linen, (...),
white and shining Rev. 19.8
. Whereby she is unblameable and unreproveable in the sight of God himself Col.
1.22
, who now beholds no iniquity in Jacob Number. 23.21
. He is also truly beautiful with perfection of parts (though not of d^grees)
by the grace of sanctification, whereby the Christian, yea, the whole Church is
sanctified throughout 1 These. 5.31
, although not thoroughly, according to the exact and absolute purification of
the Sanctuary 2 Chro. 30.19
.

Thus then the Church, and all her true children are black, as the tents of
Kedar; that is, as the Arabians and Ethiopians that live sub Dio, under the
open Heavens, and under the torrid Zone; yet beautiful as the Curtains of
Solomon Cant. 15
. Solomon in all his houses, hangings, and royal furniture, was not comparable
to this lilly among the thorns Cant. 2.2
, in regard of the beauty and comeliness she has from her heavenly Solomon;
to wit, Christ her husband, whereby she is made all glorious within Psalm. 45, 13
.

Of this beautiful Black-more (if we may so call her;) of this Planet in her
perigaeo, or lowest approach toward the earth; of this Moon in her interlunio
when she is scarce discernable; yea, of this Sun (for so also she is compared
Cant. 6.10
): but, in his eclipse; and, of this Box of precious ointment; yet not without
a fly: that is, of a Christian laboring of infirmities, by which his graces
seem to suffer an eclipse, (all which notwithstanding, he still retains a true
spiritual beauty and comeliness in the eyes of Christ, which makes him better
than the best hypocrite in the world) we are here to treat.

A subject which, me thinks, cannot be without delight. I am sure it will not
be without profit, if we make a right use of it. For, what can be more
delightful, than to see virtue daily encountered, pressed, and many times
oppressed, and forced, and yet ever victorious? Let some pursue sensual
pleasures, and follow them, with Esau, till they faint again, and become
Edomites, for their fainting Genesis 25.30
. Let others (who would seem wiser) content themselves with humane wisdom and
policy: but, let them be sure of it, all such pleasures will end in satiety
and surfeit; and, humane wisdom, though it have no surfeit, yet has error,
weariness, and vanity: and, in much of such wisdom is much grief; and he that
increases such knowledge, increases sorrow Eccl. 1.18
. It may possibly, at some times, both please and profit a man, but it sets him
never the nearer to heaven, but is rather a remora and an hindrance to it 1
Cor: 3.19
.

But, divine wisdom, and the study of holiness, consisting in the knowledge of
God, and of our selves; showing us how black we are through our own
infirmities; and yet, how comely, through Gods grace and mercy; has, to a
spiritual mind, neither satiety, nor weariness. Pity it is that, in these
days, such wisdom (as money) is gotten into so few men's hands. Wherefore I
would gladly open a Bank, or Trade, to bring it forth, and to make it more
current among the many.

I know there is a generation of profane and proud men that, neither caring to
be better, nor abiding that others should be thought better, do abhor all
Differences, and all Teachers that put difference between the holy and profane,
the precious and the vile Jer. 15.19
: being ready to say with mutinous Corah, all the ongregation are holy every
one of them, and the Lord is among them Number. 16.3
. Teach differences, say they, at Rome, or at Constantinople, not amongst those
that profess the same Religion. It is not holiness, but hollownesse and
hypocrisy (say the same men) that makes some more nice and precise than their
fellows.

These are not like Christ, nor do they like Christ, that fanneth away such
chafe from the wheat; but, like Satan that sifteth out the wheat Luke 22.31
from the chafe, that he may have the wheat, and leave the chafe to Christ.
If any be rejected as unholy, they know that they shall be found amongst the
dogs, and swine. But, if any man for overmuch holiness be too blame, these
are safe. It is not their charity therefore, but their profaneness and
self-love that make them to fly differences.

But he that shall dwell in the Holy Hill of God must be one in whose eyes a
vile person is contemned, and that honors them that fear the Lord Psalm. 15.4
. But especially this is the duty of Pastors and Ministers, if they will be as
Gods mouth Jer. 15.19
: not, to make any proud that are within; but, to stir up contriton and
humiliation in those that are yet without. And, indeed there is nothing more
needful, than to set up these meer-stones or boundaries, between Jacob and
Laban Genesis 31.48
. For, the Christian, hearing of hypocrites, is ready, out of his fear to
pronounce, Such an one am I.

The hypocrite, hearing of graces peculiar to the Saints, lays violent hands
(not upon the graces themselves, but) upon the names of those virtues, and
arrogateth all unto himself. Therefore have we labored, in the former Part,
with Abraham, to drive those Crows from these sacrifices Genesis 15.11
; and, with a cudgel as it were, to keep off this dog.

And, when he hears of the infirmities of Gods children, he is ready to
traduce them, and their Profession, saying, these be the godly ones; as bad, I
warrant you, as any other; as angry, covetous, etc: and, to palliate his own
reigning sins; I need not be so much ashamed and troubled at my petty oaths;
or, for being sometimes a little over-seen with drink; or, for not so strictly
observing the Sabbath: the best, we see, are bad; We are all sinners. God
forgive us, etc.

Yea, he grows proud, and exalts himself above the generation of Gods
children; I that make (says he) no such strict Profession, would have been
sorry to have given so bad an example. Thus, if any one professing goodness
appear to come short of his Profession, he concludes himself (who is the
hypocrite) to be good, because the other, in some thing, is found to be bad;
and, the other (who is the true Christian) to be the hypocrite, because
himself, in some particular commands over natural infirmities and passions,
does outstrip him.

For these, and the like causes, many are glad to see the weaknesses, and to
look upon the nakednesses of Gods dear children, that they may trample upon
them, and glory over them, as being themselves the better of the two; when
their own hearts cannot but tell them, that themselves are wicked. And, for
these, and the like causes, have I undertaken this second part, to bestride the
godly, being down; that, such as are worse may not too much insult over him in
his fall; not himself, despair of rising again, in the right use of the true
means of recovery.

Diverse, perhaps, will gape after this Argument, and, desire to hear all that
may be said of a Christian in his infirmities, because they intend to be
Christians; yet are laden with diverse lusts 2 Timothy 3.6
, which they hope to bring under the same head of infirmities, that they mean
not to part withal. But such shall find, that infirmities resolved upon,
tolerated, and cherished, are no longer infirmities, but reigning sins: which
(however they borrow a Livery from the true Christian, that he who wears it,
may seem to belong unto God;) will, in the issue, be the ruin and damnation of
all that flatter themselves in the retaining of them, under the names of
infirmities.

No true Christian favors himself in any kind, or degree of sin; be it but
a sin of infirmity, to which the very natural constitution of his body makes
him subject. Nay; he desires not only to better himself while he is in this
world; but, to bury all his infirmities, before himself be buried: and, to
pass into a better world, Romans 6.22
before he leave this, by being every day made more free from sin (i); and as
having the very skin of the old man, stripped over his ears, and hanged upon the
hedge, that he may stand by, and throw stones at it. He no less desires to be
freed from sin, than to be happy with Christ; as knowing, that there is no
happiness with Christ, without freedom from sin.

Herein, the hypocrite shows as little sincerity, as in the former
differences. For, albeit he seems to read, with great delight and
admiration, the stories of noble and glorious Martyrs, and zealous Confessors
deceased, whom, as Transcendents, he may admire: yet, it pleases him not, to
hear of any, better than himself that are yet alive, whom he has no mind to
imitate; rather would he look upon those that are worse, that he may appear
better; as, the Pharisee beheld the Publicane. For men going out of the world,
not to be worldly, is but that which becomes them: But, for him that lives in
the world, it misbecometh him not to favor a little of the world, because he
sees that the best, while they continue here, are worldly, although not
worldlings.

He cannot en^ure that virtue (which he has not) should be commended in his
equal that truly has it: for, this is a check to him. See as much infirmity in
his neighbor, and talk as loudly of it, as you will: this likes him well,
because hereby, he that is but a slimy slough, shines. But, if you talk of the
Christians better part, this makes the hypocrite appear like a candle lighted,
while the Sun shines upon it. That which should be in the hypocrite, and yet
is not, must not be named as being in the Christian, who truly has it. He
likes well the Christians clog* but not his wings; his blackness, to be the
hypocrites foil; but, not his comeliness, which is the hypocrites shame. Or,
if he look upon some Beauties of the present time, he puts it off, as they
that, beholding fair pictures, being themselves foul or deformed, these
pictures (say they) were drawn as it pleased the Painter: a beautiful face is
the envy of deformity. And envy will never rest, till it has (by casting
dirt) made beauty more deformed and odious than deformity it self.

But, with the true Christian it is far otherwise, whether he look upon the
Infirmities, or Virtues of such as fear God. He looks upon their
infirmities, with compassion and pity, laboring to restore them with the
spirit of meekness Gal. 6.1
. Alas! says he, He was more strongly tempted, more pressed with poverty, more
bespattered with disgrace, etc. than I. I should have done as bad, yea, worse
my self, under such strong temptations. I will rather try all gentle means to
reduce him, than go about to make him fly off further, by shaming him, or
dealing harshly with him. I am subject to the same (yea, stronger) passions my
self, with which I am unwillingly unburdened, says he; and it is some comfort
to me to see that I have some yoke-fellows; although it would be more, to see
both well rid of that unhappy yoke.

To behold Moses, the meekest of all men upon the face of the earth Number. 12.3
, so transported with passion, as to forfeit his life by it Number. 20.12 Ps.
^06.32.33
; no entreaties prevailing with God to alter the sentence of death gone out
against him for that one offense Deuteronomy. 3.26, 27
: To see Elijah, who was fed by Angels, taken up into heaven, Gods only
Champion against the whole world, subject to like passions and infirmities as
he is Jam. 5.17
, is not matter of content unto him, because thereby God was offended; nor
matter of encouragement or warrant to him to continue in the like: yet it is so
far a comfort to him that, when he looks upon his own infirmities, he may
conceive that there is some hope in Israel touching this thing. For other of
Gods dearest children and choicest servants have been subject to the same
cloggs; and yet, through mercy upon repentance, have been pardoned, and freed.

But, says he, if such Cedars fall, what shall not befall such shrubs as my
self, if I take not better heed? if I take not more hold of him that is able
to keep me that I fall not Jude 24.
, how shall I prevent falling? He says not (with the hypocrite) they fell,
therefore so may I: but, therefore will I look better to my standing 1 Cor.
10.12
Grace neglected sustaineth not; therefore must I be careful to hold fast that
I have Rev. 3.11
; and watchful, to strengthen the things that remain Verse 2.
. He looks on the falls of Saints as on sea-marks, to give him and other men
warning for keeping off from those rocks and shallowes, to avoid shipwreck.
David miscarried by idleness; Peter, through presumption, therefore, says he,
have so poor, so weak a creature as I am, the more need to be more diligent in
my calling: more humble in the opinion of my self; and more careful not to
thrust my self into the mouth of temptation.

And, as he thus looks upon the infirmities and falls of the Saints, to
better him self by the worst that was in them; so, he beholds their virtues
and perfections, not as things transcendent, and out of his Predicaments, but
as Copies for his imitation, and spurs to provoke in him an holy emulation;
that, wherein he cannot keep pace with them, he may yet press the harder
toward the same mark, and follow them so close as he can: for as much as he
knows that the same spirit of grace that was, or is in them, is in him, and
can work as effectually in him (if he stir up the grace that is in him) as he
has wrought in them.

For their sakes therefore who will make good use thereof, I enter upon this
Argument: but so, as to lock and bolt out the hypocrite from taking shelter for
his reigning wickedness under the wing of the failings of Saints: or, at
least, if he will needs press in, to give him that which shall cool him. For
them who need healing Heb. 12.13
, I shall endeavor to use the Ladies hand: but, for the other, the Eagles eye,
and the Lions heart. For both, I hope it shall be profitable, if it shall
please God to give strength and life to finish it, and that I be not forced to
leave it, as Plato, his Atlantides, with more sorrow that it is unfinished,
than with benefit that it was begun.

Wherefore, as we have seen much craft and malice in Satan, in framing those
dead Stales, which had nothing but feathers without, and straw within; I mean,
hypocrites: So I hope I shall discover, and arm our selves against his living
Stales, to wit, the falls of Gods Saints, whereby that Arch-enemy to man
causes many not only to fall, but to continue, and flatter themselves in their
lying still, and wallowing (like swine) in the mire.

There are diverse differences to be seen in a Christian. He differs from
Christ, who as the Sun of righteousness Mal. 4.2
has no Epicycle of approach to the earth, and is never out of the Ecliptic
line of perfect holiness; whereas the Christian erreth or wandreth as the
Planets, yet within the latitude of the Zodiac, the way of life, bounded with
the Tropicks of faith and repentance.

He differs from Saints Triumphant in heaven, who are elevated higher than to
be subject to any Eccentrick motions. Some have strained their wits to imagine
the Sun to be the Center of the world, and the earth and elements to move round
about it. Sure, in spiritual things, it is no Paradox. Christ, the Sun of
righteousness is the Center of the New Heavens and the New Earth Esaias 65.17
; and of the world to come. About which even the Christians earth, that is, the
Christian clogged with earthlinesse in this world, moves; although not with
that agility, wherewith those blessed spirits move in heaven. For there, are
the spirits of just men made perfect Heb. 12.23
; but here, the Christians spirit is vexed and troubled every day 2 Pet. 2.7, 8
. They are as David, who having perfectly overcome Goliath, have slain their
ten thousands: it is well with him, if he can attain to his thousand 1 Samuel
18.7.
. And, turn him which way he can, this Hercules will still find fresh
enemies, giants and monsters, even within himself, to encounter with, while he
lives in this world, notwithstanding all his former labors and victories that
might induce him to pitch down his staff, as concluding, there is no more work
to be done.

He differs from hypocrites, toto coelo, as far as the East is from the West,
even when they are at the best, and himself cumbred with the greatest multitude
of infirmities. He differs as wheat from the chafe, even when there is most
chafe of corruption encompassing and covering him. A dark day is a day, though
the light be not clear, but dark Zech. 14.6
. And the darkest day is better, (because more lightsome) than the brightest
night. When he is worst, and weakest, most clouded, and over-cast, he is a
child of the day, and of the light 1 These. 5.5
. All sins in him are infirmities, whereas in the hypocrite and unregenerate,
every sin is reigning.

Yea, the Christian differs from himself too. His Zodiac of goodness has a
latitude of degrees, wherein his graces, like Planets do variously wander. It
is always day with him, but not always Summer, or Sunshine. It is sometimes
as stormy with him in his voyage to heaven, as it was with Paul when he sailed
to Rome, when neither Sun, nor stars, in many days appeared, and no small
tempest lay on them, so that all hope that ho and his company should be saved,
was taken away Act. 27.20
.

And herein, the Christian as well as they that sail in such storms, must
endeavor to know day by supputation, not by sense. Once the Sun was up, and
the morning light did truly arise, and shine upon his heart: therefore he
concludes that, after the storm, there will come a calm; and, where the Sun
is once risen, it never sets so, as never to return into the same Horizon.
Therefore it is day still, be it never so dark with him that sits in
darkness, and has no light.

And as Planets have eccentrical motions and Epicycles, whereby they are
sometimes farther, sometimes nearer to the earth (sometimes they move about the
Center of the world, and sometimes about their own several Centers, yet all
makes up a regular motion, because they always move within their own Orbs;)
so the Christian is sometimes in his Perigaeo, or nearer approach toward the
earth, sometimes in his Apogaeo more removed from it; sometimes more
heavenly-minded, and sometimes more earthly addicted; yet all, by Gods mercy,
tends to good, and to order.

Very gladly therefore will he, with the Apostle, make mention of his
infirmities 2 Cor. 12.5
; not as delighted in them, for he abhors them; but as beholding Gods wonderful
goodness and wisdom in ordering them so, that even these, as Saint Austin
speaks, are made to work together for good unto him Romans 8 32
. Upon this account, he glories in his infirmities, that the power of Christ
so ordering of them, may rest upon him 2 Cor. 12.9
.

For, as the Sun is more noted, and better viewed in the Eclipse, or under a
cloud, or thorough some grosser air or vapor, (as at evening,) than in his
full strength: so grace is best seen in tentation and interpositions; at least
by others, when the Christian himself is feign, in the withdrawing of the light
of his graces, to lift up his eye, and to say, where is it become? because
then, he is forced to call to remembrance his song in the night, which he sang
in the daylight of Gods countenance formerly shining upon him; to commune with
his own heart, about the cause of the withdrawing of it, wherein, his spirit
makes such diligent search Psalm. 77.6
; that all (able truly to judge) cannot but conclude his restless enquiry
after grace eclipsed, and uncomfortable restlesnesse till he get a new sight of
it, to be an infallible Argument of the truth of grace in his heart.

Yea, this is such a sowing in tears, as shall produce unto him an harvest of
joy Psalm. 126.5
. And he that now is forced so to cast about for comfort, as one beyond all
reason cast down; even at that very time, when he is come a little better to
himself, he chides his own soul, saying; Why art thou cast down O my soul? and
why art thou disquieted within me? And thereupon, he gives it better counsel,
even against present sense, Hope thou in God: for, I shall yet praise him who
is the health of my countenance, and my God Psalm. 42.11
.

Again, as some men make use of Eclipses, for Chronology, Navigation, etc. and
sometimes, for predictions of what is likely to befall others of greatest mark
and note in the world; concluding, from natural causes, extraordinary events;
so may such as are truly wise unto salvation, be able to make use of the
Eclipses of grace, and the breakings out of corruption in Gods dearest
children; and, far more infallibly to conclude what is likely to befall him
that thinks he stands, if he be not more careful to take warning from such
sad presidents, so as to take better heed lest he fall 1 Cor. 10.12
.

And this comfort the true Christian has from his infirmities; that, as he who
is pur-blinde, never comes to be stark blind: so the Christian even by
infirmities is secured (through watchfulness) from a total defection from God,
or his grace. Corruption discerned makes him vigilant; whereas, perfection
presumed, destroys the sinner.

The Christian is ever the same, yet sometimes not the same. The same ever, to
God, in regard of the seed and substance of spiritual life; the new creature,
which is immortal, answerable to the seed of which he is borne again 1 Pet. 1.23
. For, where the seed of which he is begotten, is incorruptible, himself must
needs be, in his proportion, made (like his High Priest) not after the law of a
carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life Heb. 7.16
. But he is sometimes not the same, in appearance to the world, and to himself,
notwithstanding all his striving not to vary, when he cannot do what he would,
but does what he hates Romans 7.15
. Yet even then, he never differs so far from himself, as the hypocrite at
his best, differs from him, in his greatest heterogeneity or difference, from
himself: nor so, as that the hypocrite may say of him, with reason, Behold he
is become as one of us.

My business therefore, in the prosecuting of this Second Part, is, so to
carry it on, as to show how the Christian varieth from his Rule, and from
himself, as regenerate; (for, even Saints sin, but not as Saints:) yet still
retains the seed of God in him 1 John 3.9
. Next, how, even then, he is not as the unregenerate, even when, happily, he
does the same things, or worse, (but not with the same mind,) because, with
the mind he still serves the Law of God Romans 7.25
. And, how he may comfort, advise, and relieve both himself and others, in such
infirmities and falls, when with the flesh, he serves the law of sin Ibid.
. That so it may appear, that all his blackness is from without, by
Sun-burning; not from complexion within: or, if from within, not from his
constitution, as a new creature; but, by accident, and through disease; as of
the black Jaundice, etc. which may alter the color of the best complexion,
until it be healed; of which healing, the Christian is sure not to fail Hos.
14.4
: but, with Naaman, to be, not only restored, but advanced to a better
condition 2 King. 5.14
.

That he is black, himself will not deny: but, how he becomes so, is a work of
difficulty, so as to distinguish him from the hypocrite in white. For the
performance whereof, we shall, first, take a view of him in his common
infirmities which do adhere to, or may befall every Christian alike; and then,
descend to such particular infirmities wherewith some Christians more than
others, are clogged and burdened: and, in every of these, whether oommon, or
special, to show the comeliness and beauty that he still retains, beyond the
best dress, and paint of the hypocrite that is most apt to censure him for his
blackness.

CHAP. II. A Christian clogged with Original Corruption. Is he with whom sin is
borne, but it dies before him. Defin.

SIn is an hereditary disease that is epidemical; a plague of leprosy, that
spreads as it frets, and frets as it spreads, until it has overspread the
whole house, and infected every stone, rafter, and pin belonging to it. It is
an infection diffused to all mankind from the root thereof, the first Adam;
yea, to every son of his, descending from his loins by natural propagation,
although the immediate Parents be never so holy. Sin is hereditary to all,
because a just punishment of the first transgression, by which it entered into
the world Romans 5.12
. But grace is a personal Privilege, because a free gift of God Ephesians. 2.8
only to those, on whom he will have mercy Romans 9.18
.

It is said of Adam, when he begat Seth, that he begat a son in his own
likeness Genesis 5.3
: but not so, when he begat Cain, or Abel, albeit both of these were begotten
in the same image; because the Holy Ghost knew that Abel was to die without
issue: and, Caines issue were all swept away by the Flood. Therefore, he notes
this in the procreation of Seth, in whom mankind, as well good as bad, were
(after the drowning of the old world 2 Pet. 2.5
) to be propagated to the end of the world.

That all the sons of Adam might therefore behold their first corrupt original,
God more especially notes this in the generation of Seth, that Adam begat him,
in his own image; not, after the image of him that created him, innocent, and
perfect Eccl. 7.29
; nor, as he was renewed by grace, imperfectly: but, as he was corrupted by his
own personal defection from God, without any corrupt proclivity in his nature
enclining him thereunto; which likeness is rightly termed his own, because it
is that whereto he had mis-formed himself, and whereby he begat a son as sinful
as himself, to whom the Father communicated not only the substance of his body,
but the depravation of his nature, which ever since was, and shall be derived
from father to son, until time shall be no more.

Not the holiest of all the sons of Adam, were ever borne holy by propagation
from their Parents. David, a man after Gods own heart 1 Samuel 13.14
, brought sin with him into the world from his first home and place of being,
even the mould of his mothers womb, as himself ingenuously confesses upon
woeful experience; Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother
conceive me Psalm. 51.5
. Nor did e-the holiest father beget an holy son, but a sinful issue (as
kernels of sweet apples bring forth crab-trees;) witness Manasseth, the son
of Hezekiah 2 Chro. 33.1, 2
; Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah 2 Chro. 36.5, etc.
; and many more. St. Austin gives the reason, because holy men beget children as
men, not as Saints: and so, as the purest wheat that is most carefully winnowed
from the chafe, being sowed, yields wheat with as much chafe, as if the
first seed had never been winnowed. So does the children of the most sanctified
Parents, until Christ come with his fan in his hand, and thoroughly purge his
floor Mat. 3.12
from the power of corruption here, and from all being of it hereafter.

Thus nature, and corruption, in every birth are twins, as Jacob and Esau in
the womb of Rebeccah. But, as twins that are borne together, do seldom die
together, so it is in this case. A Christian borne with corruption out-liveth
it. For, while he lives the natural life in this world, corruption begins
to die, being mortified by the Spirit Romans 8.13
: and, when he dies out of this world, to live in another, his corruption and
he are for ever parted. And so, he out-groweth it here, and out-liveth it
hereafter.

On the contrary, corruption in the hypocrite, being borne with him, Differ.
becomes his death.

He finds that Proverb, (Save a thief from the Gallows, and he will cut your
throat) verified upon himself. He lets sin live, and sin makes him die, not
only a natural death, to which all are subject; but even an eternal death,
which is the wages of sin Romans 6.23
, suffered to live. While the Christian starveth corruption by abstaining from
all appearance of evil 1 These. 5.22
, making no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof Romans 13.14
; the hypocrite feeds and pampereth it, fulfilling tht desires of the flesh,
and of the mind Ephesians. 2.3
: and so sin lives, and he dies Romans 7.9
. He feeds sin, as the Pelican does her young, till she have destroyed her
self by feeding them.

Sin is to the unregenerate, as strong waters to him that is over-gone with the
dropsy: he will have them, and cannot be without them, although he know
sufficiently that they will be his death. If there be no hope of cure (says
he, when he never goes about it,) let me have content while I live; whereas
such content hasteneth his death. Sin is to him as water in its proper place
and element; not heavy, but pleasing: because he lives in it, and it in him. He
can no more live out of it, than a fish without water; or, himself, without
air. But this will prove to him, as Mare mortuum, or the dead sea to the
fishes playing in the streams of Jordan, they play so long in Jordan, till that
river and they with it, be carried into that lake of Sodom where presently they
die; for, he that lives after the flesh, is sure to die Romans 8.13
; and for more assurance, he is dead while he lives 1 Timothy 5.6
; yea, twice dead, plucked up by the roots Jude 12
; dead-borne, and dead-living ends in a double death-dying; for that not only
the soul is separated from the body, but both from God, and that for ever 2
These. 1.9
.

Thus, the Christian is as Paul, dying daily 1 Cor. 15.31
, and thereby out-liveth death: the hypocrite is as the woman living in
pleasure, (as rats that lick up their own bane) dead while he lives 1 Timothy 5.6
. In the one, corruption is as a man dead in law, condemned, and nailed to the
Cross of Christ Gal. 5.24
; in the other, it is as Barabbas released, while Christ is crucified, which
will certainly end in the dreadful destruction of all those that make such a
choice.

The Christian has sin dwelling in him, but not reigning over him.

It is an Inmate Romans 7.17
, which he cannot turn out of doors Ver. 24
: yet, an Underling, which he will not suffer to reign as a lord in his mortal
body, that he should obey it in the lusts thereof Romans 6.12
. The motions of sin and concupiscence are sometimes violent, and too strong
for him, like the sons of Zeruiah, too hard for David, who is weak, though
anointed King 2 Samuel 3.39
, yet they could never get the Crown; or as those Convulsion fits in the young
man possessed by Satan with a dumb spirit, that wheresoever it took him, it
tare him, causing him to foam, and gnash with his teeth, and pine away Mar. 9.18
: yea, oft-times it casts him into the fire of lust; and then into the waters
of despair to destroy him Ver. 22
. But yet, his comfort is, that at length, Christ comes in to the rescue, and
dispossesseth him, although sometimes with so much reluctance and torture, as
leaves him for dead Ver. 25, 26
: that in the issue, the poor man breaks forth into this (...), or Song of
deliverance, I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord Romans 7.25
.

Sin remains in him, sometimes through his own fault, in great part. For, as
the Israelites under the conduct of Joshuah, having subdued the Canaanites, did
not expel them when they had mastered them, and afterward could not do it,
when they would: and were therefore reproved of the Angel Judge. 2.1, 2
: so the regenerate, subduing their corruptions, do not make that haste, nor
use that care in driving out this Canaanitish brood as they ought; and
therefore are justly not only cumbred and vexed with them as with thorns in
their sides Ver. 3
, but taxed for the harboring of them Jer. 4.14 13.27
. For had man continued such as God made him, sin had never entered; or, had he
improved his new Creation as he ought, sin could not continue in him, at
least not in that strength, in which now it does.

Sometimes God permits the abode of corruption in the best, in this life; as
of the Canaanites, in Israel; refusing to drive them out himself, when he sees
the Christian remiss, and careless to do full execution upon the flesh so
soon as he has gotten the victory through Jesus Christ. This brings him, as
sometimes it did Israel, to Bo^him, making his whole life a valley of tears,
acknowledging his own folly and sin therein, and sighing under the just
punishment of God. This makes original corrutpion within, to root it self much
the faster, even when we pluck up the weeds springing out of it as fast as they
appear above-ground; as the moars of nettles spread the farther and faster in
the ground, by how much oftener they are mowed: yet mowed they must be, or they
would overspread, and choke all. This appears plainly by this, that nothing
in it self, though never so lovely and lawful, is naturally so pleasing, as
when it is in some degree or measure mingled with something that savours of the
flesh.

Howbeit He that causes light to shine out of darkness, brings much good
out of this evil: making it an Antidote against presumption and self-love,
bringing the Christian, notwithstanding all his graces, upon his knees in an
humble acknowledgement of his own continued vileness, for which he abhors
himself in dust and ashes Job 42.6
. A provocation to prayer, when so enclosed and environed with these Aramites 2
Chro. 18.31
of corruption, from which none can rescue him, but God himself: An exercise of
faith, and probation of grace received, corruption being a foil to grace, to
make it more resplendent; and, a whetstone to courage against such an enemy, as
the Canaanites that forced the Israelites to learn the Art of war, who being
before but brick-burners and potters, had little skill of the sword: An
evidence of Gods own power in keeping of him 1 Pet. 1.5
, and of his necessity to be kept thereby; that, as when the Philistines set
upon Sampson, the Spirit of God came upon him, so when the Christian feels
and bewaileth the power of corruption, he may more perfectly find the strength
of the Spirit supporting him 2 Cor. 12.10
; and, may look upon this as a pledge of final victory and triumph in Christ,
that having such enemies, he is not swallowed up of them: but that, as Joshuah
shut up the five Kings in the Cave at Makkedah till the battle was ended, and
then slew them altogether, after he had caused his Captains to put their feet
upon the necks of those captives Josh. 10.24, 25
; so the Lord shuts up corruption in the cave of this body, until the
warfare be finished, at which time, this and all other enemies of the
Christian, shall be as dust under the soles of his feet Romans 16.20
; and he, more than a Conqueror through him that loved him Romans 8.37
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the hypocrite and unregenerate has sin not only abiding, but
reigning in him.

It not only dwells as a guest, or sojourner; but is the Master of the house,
that takes to himself seven other spirits (all manner of actual lusts and
transgressions) and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that
man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked
generation of hypocrites Mat. 12.45
. To this Lord all the household, that is all the members and faculties of the
man, are subject; and, as subjects obey him Romans 6 16
. All other petty lusts and actual sins are as Locusts, under this Abaddon or
Apollyon of original corruption, their King Rev. 9.11


For, albeit every wicked man sets up in his heart a son of Tabeal, or King
in the midst of it Isa. 7.6. a Syrian Name, the same with Rimmon. Jun. in loc
, several from others: one, pride; another, worldliness; another, wantonness,
etc: yet in every unregenerate man, all sins are reigning: But yet, one, as the
King; the rest as his Court, his Counsel, his Guard or Associates. All the rest
are as Provinces under the dominion of this King of Babylon All sins make up
but one body politic, of which there is but one Soul or Head, and that is
original corruption. This the hypocrite obeys in all the lusts thereof Romans
6.12
.

Nothing shoots up higher than what springs out of the dunghill: nothing more
imperious and tyrannical, than original corruption (where the power of it is
not broken) because it is the proper offspring of the devil John. 8.44
. And this, in the hypocrite is both Lord and King, whose manner of reign over
the unregenerate is this, He takes their sons, even the best and choicest of
all their affections, and appoints them for himself, for his cbarets, and to
be his horsemen, he will ride in them as in charets, whithersoever he pleases
2 Timothy 2.24
, he makes them his horsemen, to run in his errands, and to fight his battles
even against God himself Rev. 12.7
; and some shall run before his charets, to be his Lacques and slaves 1 Samuel
8.11
. And, albeit they know this, yet nothing will serve their turn, but they will
have a King, yea, this King, over them Ver. 18
.

Thus, the Christian may be troubled with ill neighbors, and have a Mesech,
and a Kedar Psalm. 120.5
, even within him, making him to cry out bitterly, with Paul, O wretched man
that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death Romans 7.24
! But, only Christ, is his King Psalm. 2.6
. The hypocrite is not only under the power of sin and Satan, but voluntarily
gives up himself to obey them as his Lord and Sovereign: and says even unto
this bramble, Come thou and reign over me Judge. 9.14
. To the one sin is a burre that sticks hard to him: to the other it is a devil
that wholly possesses him. The one is haunted with it, as the Israelites with
the Egyptians, even after he is delivered from the power of it; but, while he
marches he may see corruption (as the Egyptians) drown in the red sea of
Christ's blood Ex 14.27, 28
. The other gives it free quarter, and becomes tributary to it, and puts his
trust in the shadow of it, until fire come out of this bramble, and devour
this hypocrite, who in his own conceit, is a Cedar of Lebanon.

In a Christian Original sin is Intruder.

It will press in upon him, and has too much impudence to take a repulse, if
driven back. It is an unwelcome guest, an odious Inmate, a lothsom Lurdane. It
may easily perceive by the countenance and entertainment which the Christian
affords it, how unwelcome it is. He makes no provision at all for it Romans 13.14
, although the flesh would make use of what he provideth for better guests;
nay, he wishes, he could starve, or cudgel, or fire it out 1 Cor. 9.27
.

Yea, he makes war upon it, and entertaineth the Spirit against it Gal. 5.13
, to mortify and kill it Romans 8.13
. He calls in aid by prayer Ephesians. 6.18
: yea, he puts on the whole Armor of God Ver. 11
to fight against it and all that partake with it. And when he does least, he
never gives it a good look, will never be reconciled to it, sigheth to be
disburdened of it, as of a body of death Romans 7.24
: and not to entertain it, as companion, or fit to live. He is as Sampson, who
seeing he cannot otherwise make an end of this Intruder, will pull down the
house of sin, and bury it in the rubbish of his mortality, rather than it
should not die with him, that will not die before him.

Contrariwise, to the unregenerate and hypocrite, Differ.
corruption is a welcome guest.

It is cherished, feasted, flattered, served, and observed, as one that is ab
intimis, a bosom friend. The house of his soul is empty, swept, and garnished
for the entertainment of this unclean spirit Luke 11, 25
. He yields his body as a Temple, and his soul as a shrine, to this Diana,
with acclamations touching the greatness of it Act. 19.28
. And as all Asia contributed to the honor of that Image; so he, with all his
might and wit, serves and adoreth this idol because he thinks that it is
far more true of this, than of that, that this all the world worshipeth Ver.
27
.

There is not a servant in his house, not a member in his body, not a faculty
of his soul, but shall all attend and wait upon this friend, with as much
diligence as Solomon's servants waited on the Queen of Sheba; and as Hezekiah
did on the Ambassadors of the King of Babylon, being glad of them, and showing
them the house of his precious things, the silver and the gold, the spices, and
the precious ointment, and all the house of his Armor, and all that was found
in his treasures, or in his dominions Isa. 39.2
. And is afterward rewarded accordingly, when all those things shall be
carried to Babylon Ver. 6
, and made a prey to him that now courteth him so much.

Thus, the Christian deals with corruption as the men of Gibeah with the Levite
and his Concubine, where, there was no man that took them into his house to
lodging Judges 19.15
; the hypocrite and unregenerate is like Jobs sons that every day feasted
each other, till a wind from the wilderness, smote the four corners of the
house, that it fell upon tqem, and killed all Job 1.19.
; the one refuses to have any fellowship with it Ephesians. 5.11
. The other is served by it, as Amnon by Absalom that made his feast a train to
the murdering of his brother 2 Samuel 13.28
.

To the Christian, the flesh is a ravisher.

It is a Tarquine forcing Lucretia Live. l. 1. and 2
; an Amnon, violating his sister Tamar 2 Samuel 13.14.
; a Shechem ravishing Dinah Genesis 34.2
; always attempting the Christian, although not always prevailing. Howbeit
sometimes it soliciteth so vehemently, that it obtaines more consent than is
meet; and so there ensues a conception, a bastard brat, filius naturalis, a
natural child, of which the Christian cannot but be ashamed; as is too
palpably seen in David, Peter, and even in Abraham may have an Ishmael by
Hagar, a child borne after the flesh (which ravished him, to beget it) to
persecute him that is borne after the Spirit Gal. 4.29
.

By this means, the dearest Saints of God have brought forth their own
trouble, that is their sins, which (when themselves) they hate, by listening
too long, and hearkening too much to the Sirens songs of concupiscence, unto
which they may well say, as Jepthe to his daughter, making him unseasonable
music, Alas, my daughter! thou have brought me very low, and thou art one of
them that trouble me Judges 11.35
.

But this is the Christians comfort (upon his repentance) that though sin in
him be born, yet it cannot be so finished that it should bring forth death
James 1.15
: but, either by grace in him, it proves an abortion; or, by grace in God, it
dies without issue, as David's child by Bathshebah 2 Samuel 12.14
, even when he begged the life of it with much importunity ver. 16, 17
. The true husband of a Christian soul is Christ, to whom that soul is
ordinarily true and faithful; and extremely humbled, when, by violent
tentation, she happens to be in the least disloyal. By him therefore she is
ordinarily both preserved from such ravishment, and made pregnant, to bring
forth fruit unto God Romans 7.4
.

Differ.
On the contrary, To the hypocrite and unregenerate the flesh is an husband
still living.

In him, original corruption is still alive without deaths-wound, consumption,
or divorce, therefore lives with him as his head, and his husband; it enjoyes
him as much, and as often he pleases, to which he willingly consents, as not
having power over his own body, or soul, but this husband 1 Cor. 7.4
, and the hypocrite is bound by the Law to this husband, so long as he lives
Romans 7.2
; not by any Law of God, but by the Law of sin, which has its Law, that is
more punctually obeyed by the hypocrite than the Law of God Mic. 6.16
.

Here only it is lawful for the wife to kill the husband, by the Law of nature,
because this husband is a murderer, and will murder this wife, if he be not
killed, or divorced. If the hypocrite shall go from this husband to be married
to another; to wit, to profession of Religion; (for Christ will none of him)
this husband the flesh, remands him back again, as the Levite did, his
Concubine that ran from him, and played the whore Judges 19.2
; and as David did, Michal, Saul's daughter, recovering her from Phaltiel, 2 Samuel 3.14, 15
to whom Saul had given her, after she had been married to David 1 Samuel 25.44
. Yea, corruption may sue such a wife at the Law, and fetch her home again
from her own fathers house. Nothing but death, that is, mortification, can
dissolve that marriage, or free the hypocrite from the Law of this husband.

Thus, the Christian may be forced by sin, but will never give consent to be
married to it, or to live in adultery with it: the hypocrite is like Messaling
that loves change of husbands, but chiefly to be married to that husband that
will most fully satisfy her prodigious lust: the one is enticed and drawn away
to evil ere he be aware, but alloweteh it not, nor himself in it; the other
loves the wickedness which he commits, and allows more evil than he does.

In the Christian regenerate, corruption does not ordinarily break forth.

He may be surprised ere he be aware, as David once was 2 Samuel 11.2
, when before he thought not of such a sin. He may be too ventrous upon
tentation, as Peter (presuming too much of his own strength) was, in going into
the high Priests Hall, Mat. 26 58
notwithstanding the fair warning given him before Verse 34
. But, for the most part, lust is suppressed before it go so far as to conceive
James 1.15
; or, if it conceive, it comes not to a birth, but is killed in the womb.
Sometimes it brings forth sin, and breaks forth into gross and apparent acts:
but that is but seldom and very rarely, by reason of grace subduing it more
and more Romans 6.14
, that cannot show it self so often as it desires to be seen.

An enemy may, by surprise, take a sconce, or Fort that was raised against him:
but he will not be able to hold it long, when once the surprised party has
bethought himself, and carefully employed force sufficient to recover it. Then,
the owner keeps it with more care, putting in a stronger garrison, that it may
not be so easy for the enemy to gain a second time. As for daily infirmities
to which the Christian is subject, they may too often appear to vex him; but,
for grosser sins that bring scandal to the Gospel, he fenceth himself with more
diligence, that he may not cause the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme. Those
clouds that ordinarily give rain, do not send forth thunder and lightning;
unless, when, extraordinarily, by an Antiperistasis, or a fighting of
contraries, there a prevailing more than ordinary, to the producing of a more
than ordinary effect. There is a seed of God abiding in the Christian 1 John 3.9
, that keeps him from sinning after the manner of the unregenerated hypocrite.

Contrarily, in the hypocrite and unregenerate, Differ.
lust has her ordinary and daily births.

It is true, the hypocrite steals many a birth that the world takes no notice
of, as he steals many a sweet morsel and draught of water, that every eye sees
not; which are pleasant to him Prove. 9.17
, because he knows not that the dead are there Verse 18
. But, openly, or secretly, his lust is like the hare, that brings forth
continually, and yet is with young again, before she be delivered of her first
conception. Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart are only evil, and
that continually Genesis 6.5
. He sleeps not except he have done mischief Prove. 4.16
: He is troubled more, if he have done none, than if he had done all the
wickedness that can be committed. It is his trade, and he vexes, when he does
neglect it.

He can let sin as freely take her course in him, as the fish in the river
lets in water at her mouth Job 15.16
. It is his element; it offends him not; unless, to be out of it. As all men
are born to trouble, so he to sin, as the sparks fly upward Job 5.7
. He cannot cease from sin 2 Pet. 2.14
. Adam, in innocence, had only the tinder, or touch-wood of mutability: no
fire, or flint, till the devil brought both, and, with it, a match to kindle
sin in him, by the hand of his wife; which the devil made his steel also, to
strike fire with all the heart of her husband. But, in the hypocrite there is
now not only tindar, but gunpowder, flint and steel, and match and all. The
Devil is but the striker; yea, many times prevents the Devil, and strikes fire
himself, as being a tempter and Devil to himself, and others, having no need of
the devils help, but rather tempts the Devil.

Thus, the Christian (in whom sometimes the same things are found, which are in
the hypocrite) has his nature and quality so altered (that he cannot sin so
often, and easily as the hypocrite) he has his tindar of corruption so
drowned, Heb. 12.1
or made dank by grace, that it will hardly take fire at all: but, in the
hypocrite, there is an Aetna of corruption, ever belching out hellish flames
and vapors. In the one, there is a laboring cloud that feign would ascend so
high, as to consume, without sending down thunder or lightning, or so much as
rain: and, if any flash of lightning break forth, it presently quenches it
with a shower of the tears of repentance: In the other, the cloud of sin
never rises higher, than to be formed into a storm of rain, hail, thunder,
and fire, that may consume it self in the ruin of others, as that which
destroyed all Job's sons at a clap Job 1.19
.

In the Christian, corruption cannot so lurk, but that it is espied, and found
out.

If there be a Law made by corruption, that when he would do good, evil is
commanded to be present with him to hinder that good, he finds it out
presently Romans 7.21
. If there be a Law in his members warring against the Law of his mind, and
bringing him into captivity to the Law of sin Verse 23
, He has eyes to see it, whereby he may timely pour out his complaint to him
that is able to succor him, O wretched man that I am Verse 24
! Other men see the good that is in him; but his eye sees so much evil in
himself (which others cannot) that he is more troubled to be rid of evil, than
composed to rejoice in the good. For, in the fruit he sees so much evil of the
root, that he shall never be quiet, to enjoy himself, till both root, branch,
and fruit be all destroyed.

To be sensitive of sin, and of the burden of it, is so his property, that
he cannot conclude himself to be alive, longer than he feels it. He is weary of
his burden Mat. 11.29
, or else in vain does he feel it. To him, as to the old man, a grasshopper is
a burden Eccles. 12.5
, because new life makes him sensible of the least weight. He feels the
burden of original sin, because in him it is out of its element, and
therefore heavy. David complains, of it Psalm. 51.5
, when none accuses him for that, though they condemn in him the effects. Paul
cries out of it, being a Christian Romans 7.24
, which he never took notice of, while he was a Pharisee Phil. 2.6.
.

Indeed there can be no cure of actual sin till the bottom of that sore, and
the core that feeds it, be discovered. Medicines may be applied to skin up the
orifice; but, till the proud flesh be all taken away; and the humor that feeds
it, be thoroughly purged out, there can be no perfect cure. No man can be after
Gods heart, till his own heart be cleansed, and made like unto God: Therefore
the Christian takes more care to espy out the evil that is in him, that God may
purge it out; than to rejoice in the good, lest himself should be exalted, when
he has most cause to be abased. He had rather not see a friend, which he
knows will do him no hurt: than not espy an enemy, which (unespied) will be
sure to destroy him.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the hypocrite so overlooks his corruption, that when it abounds
most, it is least taken notice of.

Actual and gross sins every one espieth. But, if the there be no such
breaking forth, the unregenerate man takes no notice of what is in the heart.
If the toads hop about, and make a noise by croaking, every one observes them,
but while they lie close at the roots of the best herbs, no man looks after
them. If redness appear in the face, every one can see that in the glass,
and say, I must go to the Apothecary for a water. Only the wise man, in that
redness, can say, I see an hot liver, for which I must go to the Physician for
a remedy. Every civil man can find fault with a roaring Hackster, but none but
a Christian discerns the Maeanders within that produce that noise.

When he swears, he can epsy the rancor of his lips, but sees not so far
into the root of that disease, as to take notice of the profaneness and
Atheism that lies at the heart. The wiseth heathens with the eye of reason,
helped with the moonshine of Philosophy, could never discern the caves and
cavernes of corruption within, even while that may be said of them, Insonuere
cavae, gemitumque dedere cavernae Virg: Aeneid. 2.
, when they give the greatest sound without. Much less can profane, secure,
idle, and ignorant sinners penetrate so deep as to know the plague of their own
hearts King. 8.38
. Solomon indeed saw it Eccles. 7.29.
; but, it was the help of the Sunshine of the light of grace and spiritual
illumination. Paul, who was naturally (without grace) as sharp sighted as ever
any sinner, except Solomon; yet, nothing but the Law (and that, not
Phylosophically, Pharisaically, Popishly, or carnally, but Christianly, and
spiritually understood) could teach him that lust, or original corruption
secretly lying hid within, was sin. He had not known lust (either what it
meant, or what it could produce) unless the Law had said, thou shall not lust
Romans 7.7
. It was only grace that enabled him to understand the Law, and sin by the
Law. And, by the experience he had of sin, when he brought lust and the Law
together Verse 9
, to take view of each other, he found a clearer Commentary upon the Law, than
ever he had met withal before. He now discerned the better of the one by the
contrariety of the other unto it. He now found (which he knew not before) the
Law, to be spiritual (reaching much further than ever he dreamt of) and himself
to be carnal, sold under sin Ver. 14
, whereas before he never thought of any such matter.

Thus, corruption in the Christian is as (...), or the passion of the heart,
that he no sooner feels the least disturbance within, but his whole heart is
much affected with it; he cries out, at the first taste of the colloquintida
within, mors in olla, there is death in the pot; yea, if he find himself but
untoward, and unweildy to good, though not much tempted to evil, in this he
finds a bitter root within: But in the hypocrite and unregenerate sinful
corruption is as Enceladus at the bottom of Aetna, which does continually ( --
ruptis flammam expirare caminis, Virg. En. 3
) both break open the way, and send forth his flames, yet himself lie
undiscerned: the one benefitteth by his sight of sin and sense of corruption,
to give glory to God, and testimony to his Law; the other feels it not till
it come to some fearful effect, or symptom, being a poison in his bowels, he
discerns it not till it bring forth blisters, and scabs upon his brow.

The Christian opposes corruption in the root.

He gives the water no passage, no not a little; as knowing if it has once
found vent, it will hardly be stopped; nay, rather, he draws the well dry,
leaving it without water, as knowing it be least deceitful when most empty. All
his pain lies within at the heart. His disease has seized the vital parts.
Therefore, however he be able to say with Paul, that, touching outward
righteousness which is in the Law, he is blameless Phil. 3.6
, no man can say there is so much as a mote in his eye, nor does he know any
thing by himself, of which man could take advantage; yet he feels what others
see not in him, and complains of the hectique that is within; crying out, Who
shall deliver me?

Ask a worldly man what fault he can espy in the Christian? and he will answer,
1 Cor. 4.4
I see none, but that he is too precise. But ask himself, and he will tell you,
he sees a Law in his members contrary to the Law of his mind, leading him
into captivity to the Law of sin Romans 7.23
. He sees inclinations (and those very strong) unto evil; sluggishnesse in
good duties, want of delight in God, and laments and loathes himself more for
this inward distemper that brings forth nothing but wormwood and gaul, than any
man can loath him for his preciseness.

Therefore, as Moses cast the tree into the midst of the bitter waters, and
sweetened the springs, that the waters issuing thence might be made sweet Exodus
15.25
. And as Elisha cast salt into the spring of Jericho (not into their pots or
dishes who took of it for their use) and thereby the waters were healed 2 King.
2.20, 21
, and, afterward cast meal into the pot to cure the pottage, of which men
before could not eat 2 King. 4.41
: so the Christian chafeth in the word of grace into his heart Psalm. 119.11
, and lodges it there, that there it may encounter corruption in the very
center and fountain thereof: as well knowing that when wisdom enters into
his heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto his soul, then shall discretion
preserve him, and understanding shall keep him Prove 2.10, ^1
.

On the contrary, the hypocrite and unregenerate, neglecting the fountain,
Differ.
striveth in vain with the streams.

He labors to dam up a river by a Bay, not by drying up, or diverting the
fountain; and so the stream still running the same way, swells higher and
higher till it break the Bay down before it, or overflow the banks. Corruption
only restrained, and not dried up by mortification, does but swell higher, and
breaks over more strongly when it can no longer be kept in. The stop of it does
but increase it, while the fountain feeds it. And then it scorneth the banks,
and breaks over into a general inundation of pride, worldliness, or some
such superfluity of naughtiness.

If he restrain some brook of anger, It breaks out by lust, or some such like
channel or rivulet. If he set a curb to prodigality, corruption ponds in him to
feed covetousness: and so, generally, let him begin, or end where he will, sin
only curbed, is but lust enraged, that will prove a Serpent, out of whose root,
shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying Serpent
Esaias 14.19
.

Thus, the Christian applies the right medicine (which is the death of Christ)
to the part primarily affected, which is the heart and conscience: and so,
purging that from dead works, he serves the living God H^b. 9.14.
. But the hypocrite and unregenerate wilfully mistaking both the plaster and
the sore, spends his labor in vain: the one launceth his sore to the
bottom, and so heals it effectually; the other not enduring incision,
causes a suppuration of putrid matter within, that will in the issue make his
wound like Jehorams disease in his bowels, altogether incurable 2 Chr. 21.18
.

The Christian, notwithstanding his regeneration, looks upon the remains of
sin within him as a complete body or entire man of sin.

As he that has received a deaths wound in any part of his body, is still a
body, and called a body; yea, a man (notwithstanding that wound) while his life
is in him: so the Christian considers the remainders of corruption not yet
quite dead (although nailed to the cross) within him. He calls it a body of
death Romans 7.24
, because though destinated to death, yet it is not altogether dead; it is
still stirring, and struggling, not only for life; but, to do what mischief
more it can, before it yield up the ghost. Paul found it so, and so does every
Christian, who looks upon himself every day as in danger to be wounded by this
body, that would kill him outright by way of revenge, if it lay in his power.

The old man of sin in him is yet, so strong that it hurrieth him on
sometimes upon the evil that he hates, and holds his hands in despite of
his heart, from doing the good that he would Romans 7.15
. Yea, it sets up a Law in his members (that is, in his whole man) that warreth
against the Law of his mind (that is, of the regenerate part, throughout his
whole soul) and leads him into captivity to the Law of sin which is in his
members Verse 23
He looks upon sin therefore, not as some little piece or sprig of a tree
lopt off; or as some hand, or foot, or other single member of a body cut off
from the rest, of which there is no danger, nor cause of fear: but as that
which is apt to do mischief, and watches to do it as much as ever. What it
wants in strength, it has still in malice: and will one time or other play the
viper with him.

He therefore considers that when he has to do with corruption, he has to
do with a man, that if he look not better to himself will give him a foil:
with an old man, who is subtle, and cunning to watch him a mischief ere he be
aware. He knows that a slighted enemy has so much advantage, that it is ten
thousand to one, but he foiles him that slights him. He will therefore watch in
the watchtower, he will anoint the shield, and declare what he sees Esaias
21.5, 6
: and, be ready to receive a new encounter from it, even when it lies
sprawling, and gasping for life.

He beholds in it the seed-plot of all sins (the sins of murder, treason,
and the sin of the holy Ghost not excepted) and an enmity to all good: and
therefore, a body of sin, for the largeness and universality of it in it self.
He finds that it has overflowed and filled all the powers and faculties of
the soul, making the mind carnal, the wisdom fleshly, the will corrupt; all,
full of sin: insomuch that as Noah's flood prevailed over the loftiest
mountains, so this flood and inundation of original sin has overflowed the
highest faculties of the humane nature. Well therefore may he look on it as a
body, that overspreaded body and soul.

Nay, he finds and feels this universal contagion (though in part mortified,
and not imputed) in great part remaining in himself; so that he confesses it
of the whole man (in part at least) I am carnal, sold under sin Romans 7 14
: not as having nothing spiritual, but as having too much flesh mingled with
the spirit in every part of him. So that there are in him, as in Rebeccahs
womb, twins, an old man, and a new man struggling together; sometimes the one,
sometimes the other prevailing. So far as the new man prevails, he is
spiritual; so far as the flesh overmastereth him he is carnal. The one
therefore is a whole man (diffusing it self like leaven into the whole heap) as
well as the other.

Hence it is, that he is as it were divided in himself, that he cannot tell
what to make of himself. One while he says, not I, but sin that dwells in me
Verse 17
, giving the name of himself to the part regenerate. Another while, In me, that
is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing Verse 18
, giving the name of himself to the part unregenerate. And in regard of both,
he compares himself to a living man tied to a dead carcass Verse 24
, being like him that striveth with the nightmare, or hagg, which affecting
the brain the fountain of the nerves, binds the whole body, yet is resisted
in every part, and at length dispelled.

Contrarily, The hypocrite and unregenerate, imagines himself to be, in some
parts, Differ.
free from this infection; and not to have to do with the whole old man; but,
with some pieces only.

He confesses the several parts and faculties are out of order; but it is
because they obey not reason: for, no man regards reason in the point of
anger, or of lust. But the (...) (the commanding powers, or powers which should
command) the understanding and the will are free from that tyranny and
usurpation of the old man, even in natural men. Herein he takes up the
Peripatetick faith of the Papists. But it is no marvel, if he that is not only
throughout, but thoroughly carnal and fleshly; discern not that flesh within
him (which makes him blind) and in his greatest blindness, to ask the
question in much scorn and indignation, Are we blind also John 9.40
? and that he find nothing amiss in him, unless it be some enormous sin
which the common light of nature cannot but abhor. For, corruption is not
discerned by corruption, but by grace.

Some sins are vulgarly imputed to the heat of youth: and (say some) we must
give youth her swinge. But he that is of that mind will find himself
deceived, and see cause to say, with that father in the Comaedy, sperabam
deferbuisse adolescentiam, I hoped youth would have at length cooled of it
self. He that waits till corruption be wasted and spent of it self, makes
good that Emblem Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis; at ille
Labitur and Labetur, etc.
The ignorant Rustic stands by the water side exspecting all the water will
ere long be run out, and then he may go over dry-shod. But, while he tarries
for that, himself runs out his life, before he see an end of the River. So
fares it with him that thinks the old man will at length wither, and die away
of himself. This will destroy him that thinks so, but never rid him of what he
thinks will be destroyed. Grace sees youth more able to some sins; to which
it finds age as willing; yea, and to be ready to complain with Milo, of the
want of that ability, Hi hi jam mortui sunt, deserimur a vitiis, etc. These
limbs alas! are dead; we are now left in the plain field of our own vices,
etc. So that, lust is not seated only in the body and inferior faculties,
which failing, lust also will fall off. Sin is seated in the will and mind
principally, which the unregenerate would excuse; and the same poison that
yields the act in youth, contiues the desire in age.

The unregenerate is so foolish that he thinks there is no fear of corruption
in old age, when nature is spent. He is as the Philistines who never dreamt
that Sampson, after they had taken him prisoner, put out his eyes, and bound
him in chains of brass) could ever do them further hurt. Now, they call him
to make them sport, whom before they feared; but, his sport ended in their
ruin, and in slaying more at his death, than ever he slew in his life before.
So it is here.

Thus, the Christian, although he be not so happy as to have no enemy, Judges
16.30
yet he has this happiness, as with Marius, to see the whole body and
strength of the enemy that still lies in wait for an advantage, how often
soever worsted: the hypocrite and unregenerate thinks there is no fear of an
enemy, till their drums beat, and his Towns be all on fire. The one prepares
all the strength he can as being to encounter the main body of the enemy; the
other, dreams of nothing but some light skirmish with a small party unworthy
of regard, till himself be destroyed.

The true Christian beholds sin as a grievous Law too heavy to be borne.

He still complains of the Law in his members, albeit the Law of the Spirit
of life which is in Christ Jesus has freed him from the Law of sin and of
death Romans 8.2.
. He is freed from the reigning power, but not from the tyranny of that Law;
from the death of it, but not from the buffettings of it. It is a Law in him,
but not unto him. It would sway with him, but it cannot have dominion over him.
Rebels, up in arms, make and proclaim many Laws of their own framing, by which
they would bind the whole Country: but it is in the power of the subjects not
to admit them. The Pope makes many Laws, Canons, etc. (little better many of
them than the former) which are urged upon all, but not received by all; (for,
the Venetians refuse them: so his Bulls were many of them sent hither, but not
admitted;) being Lawless Laws against the Laws both of God, and of Caesar.

Yet are all these Laws, in the intent of him that urges them, and in the
understanding of those Traitors that receive them. And, happily, such Laws
prevail by the strong hand of tyranny, so that even they that are good
subjects are forced sometimes to bear the burden of them, though they do not
allow, but abhor them. In like manner it is with this Law of corruption; A
Law it may be for Out-Lawes, not for Christ's subjects: because it is a Law
against the Law of God, and of Christ, whereto the regenerate man is a sworn
subject, and wherein only he delights, so far forth as he is regenerate,

He wishes there were no Law, but that of grace, and of God, which was Adams
condition in innocence: but now, when he is converted, grace finds in him a
Law of sin formerly established, which is to be abrogated as it may, not all at
once, but by little and little. In Mount Sinai the Law was first given in
Tables which were of Gods making; and the Law, of his own writing. But, those
Tables being broken, there were other Tables wherein God wrote his Law afresh;
But, the Tables were made by Moses, not by God. So now, the Christian feels
the finger of God in the writing of the Law in his heart: but the heart is such
as God finds it, and as man has made it: that is, in great part, corrupt and
sinful. This corruption has set up in him in another Law, which (to his grief)
the Law of grace, can hardly master.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the hypocrite and unregenerate, having the same Law of sin upon
him, feels not the burden.

He can fulfill the will of the flesh; not, with grief, but with greediness
Ephesians. 4.19
. And no marvail; he has entertained no other Law to make him unwilling to
that of sin. So that what is said of the regenerate, the Commandments of God to
him are not grievous 1 John 5 3.
, is true of the hypocrite, that the love of sin in him makes the law of sin
not grievous unto him. Here, he can offer a sacrifice of thanskgiving (as they
to their Idols, at Bethel, and Gilgal) with leven, and proclaim and publish the
free-offerings (which himself more especially takes pleasure in) for this
likes him well; for, so he loves Amos 4.5.
.

The Law of sin, in it self (and to him that knows the baseness, and the
mischief of sin) is an heavy burden. Nothing can be more grievous then to
receive a Law from sin, to obey sin as a man would obey a Law of his Sovereign.
For, a Law of sin cannot but be unjust, a Law of oppression; yea, a Law, of
death: a Law whereby sin is committed as it were with warrant against God; a
Law, which must be obeyed upon pain of death; and being obeyed, gives no other
wages or reward, but death, yea eternal death. Yet this is the law by which
alone the unregenerate desires to be governed.

But there is more in a Law of sin, than bare obedience to it. It has a
bewitching and enchanting nature to make the sinner willing to obey, to engage
in a corrupt course, so as not easily, or suddenly to be taken off: and this
likes him, he loves it: there is hardly any reclaiming of him. There is a
just judgment of God, giving him up to his own hearts lusts Psalm. 81.12.
; so that it is one of the greatest plagues, so to obey it; as it is one of the
greatest sins to acknowledge such a Law, and to plead for it; it is my
nature, my custom, my daily practice, says he, and I cannot help it. You must
pardon me, talk no more of it; for, I must, and will do it. This is, not only
to have a Law imposed, or obeyed; but, to hold a Parliament, and to make that
perpetual, which before was taken up only for a Trial, till the next Session.

Thus, the Christian is under the Law of sin, as a man traveling in his way,
is taken by Thieves and Robbers, and, after many wounds received, is compelled
to be under their Laws, to say, and do what they command; but, with purpose to
obey no longer, than till he can get from under their power; which he
endeavors, by all ways and means he can: The hypocrite, is under that Law,
as the Thieves themselves that make it, expecting a benefit from it, and, upon
that account yielding ready obedience to it: the one is extremely troubled
that he is obnoxious to it: the other is jolly and jocund that he is governed
by it. The one receives sin as a blow; the other, as a Law that is welcome.

The true Christian finds that Law of sin, in his members; not in his mind,
or inner

The whole man, so far as it is corrupted by sin, are but earthly members
of the body of sin Col. 3.5.
. But every part of the man, so far as it is renewed by grace, is so refined,
that all becomes but the mind, the inner-man of a Christian Romans 7.22, and 25.
. The sin that tainteth, are his members; the grace that resists, is his
inner-man. He accounts nothing the man but that which comes from God to restore
him to himself. Till then, he is like the beast that perishes Psalm. 49.20.
. The beast acts by the members of his body; not as acted by reason, but
sense: so does a man, till regenerated; not as acted by grace, but by
sensuality and corruption.

And even after regeneration, sin gives a Law; but not to the soul, as it
becomes the purer part by grace; but yet, to the soul, as well as to the body,
so far forth as the soul is in part unpurified. The corruption not yet
cleansed out, is now, not the soul come to it self, as the Prodigal after his
conversion Luke 15.17.
. But, as a gross bodily member, not yet enlivened and quickened by the Spirit
of grace. To the unregenerate part; that is, to the flesh, not wholly rooted
out, sin is as welcome still, as a Rebel coming to visit a Prisoner cast into
Prison for the same rebellion, is welcome to the Prisoner. The Prisoner makes
very much of him, and so far as he durst, joins with him in drinking,
revelling and roaring in the very prison: yet dares not take all the liberty
that he would, for fear of his Keeper.

The Christian then, with his mind, (that is, with the whole man renewed,)
serves the Law of God; but, with the flesh, (which, is the corruption yet
remaining in the whole man) the Law of sin. He intends not a confession of
sin in the created parts of the body only, as if sin had its seat in the
body, and sensitive parts of the soul, and were attributed to the superior
faculties, by vicinity and sympathy only, as Papists teach Rhem in Rom 7.
aliique complures.
. But, he freely confesses, flesh to have overspread all, to have corrupted,
and commanded all, and still to hold as great a part in him, as the Philistines
in Canaan; and that this flesh is still to him as the Canaanites to Israel,
snares and traps unto him, scourges in his sides, and thorns to his eyes Johsh
23.13.
: yea, so far sometimes prevailing, that it sends forth spoylers into every
part and coast of him, and makes him beholding to the Philistines to sharpen
his share and his Coulter, his axe and his Mattock 1 Samuel 13.10.
, so long as Saul reigns, that is, while he thinks, by strength of reason and
nature, to prevail; and until David, his King Jer. 30.9.
, the power of grace, rise up and subdue them.

The regenerate part, then, is the mind of a Christian; the unregenerate part,
his flesh: not simply, but by way of similitude. For, as of a man, considered
in his natural parts, the flesh is the grossest, and the mind, the purest: So,
by resemblance, a man, considered spiritually and as born again, that which yet
remains of sin not wholly cast out, is the grosser part, and may therefore
well be called flesh, although it be in the mind; and, that which is renewed,
the mind and spirit, although it be in the inferior faculties and members of
the body, now made weapons of righteousness Romans 6.13.
, may be termed the mind. Thus an eye, under covenant Job. 30.1.
, is a part of the mind, whereas the pollution of the mind not wholly renewed,
is a member of the flesh.

There is therefore in every regenerated man, a medly of flesh and spirit,
throughout every part of soul and body. There is flesh in the mind, simply and
naturally understood; so that it is both the best, and the worst Counselor.
There is also in the inferior faculties of the soul and members of the body
renewed by grace, a mind, or new man, acting above nature, and regulating those
parts which are most sensual and carnal; so as now, they become spiritual in
their exercise, although not in their substance.

He finds that the mind, so far as it is made spiritual, guides him by the
Law of nature or of grace, as it self is guided by God. But farther than thus,
it is content to be of his sinful opinion, and to join with corruption, as
Ahitophel with Absalom: against his lawful Sovereign 2 Samuel 15.31
. Sometimes, his mind tells him more than seven Watchmen Eccles. 37.14.
; when it watches for God: but, at other times it is worse than seven
Ahitophels; and then he is forced to pray even against this Ahitophel of his
own mind, O Lord, I pray thee, turn the Counsel of Ahitophel into foolishness
2 Samuel 15.31
. It is now no longer a Subject, but a Rebel: no longer a part of his mind,
which he now owneth; but, of his flesh, which he loathes.

The mind, in him, unregenerated is not owned for his mind, but cried out upon
as a Traitor. And when it comes to be renewed, all the flesh that was in it is
not wholly expelled: therefore, so far as it is renewed, he restores it in
blood to the first honor, calling it his mind: and so far as he is therein
unrenewed, he calls the old mind, or the mind as it was old, by the name of
flesh still, in relation to the corruption that yet remains in it. And so,
this mind, that is, flesh remaining in the mind of a regenerate man, when it
counsels without God, is as Sarah, to Abraham, counselling him to take
Hagar, upon whom he begets an Ishmael, even through Sarahs (that is his fleshly
minds) unghostly counsel. But when once he comes to see the mischief, and to
follow better discretion, even the father of this illegitimate brat through the
grace that is in him, as an enemy to corruption and sin, drives both the
bondwoman, and her son, out of doors Gal. 4.30.
.

Differ.
On the Contrary, the hypocrite and unregenerate has no mind or inner-man at
all, but only flesh.

An humane soul he has, laden with sin, which is but flesh Romans 8.13.
: but a mind; or inner-man renewed, he neither has, nor desires to have: and
so he is but a Beast 1 Cor. 15.32.
, of which, flesh, is the best thing in him. He is all flesh, no spirit; all
corruption, no grace: therefore, in the account and language of God, all
members, no mind. The things of God he understands not 1 Cor. 2.14.
. His very mind and conscience is defiled Titus 1.15.
. When there is a price in his hand, he has no heart Prove. 17.16.
. He is not only without understanding, as the beast that perish; but, depraved
in his understanding, as the Devil that first deceived him. How then, can he be
said to have an inner-man, that has nothing within him but that which un-mans
him? What mind he has, is flesh; a natural mind turned flesh and making him
fleshly in all the actings of it.

Some have disputed for reason in beasts, asserting that they (at least some of
them) have a knowledge and wisdom, more than sensitive. Sure it is that the
unregenerate has not the understanding of a man Prove. 30.2.
, nor of many Beast. For, when the Ox knows his owner, and the Ass his
Masters Crib: Man does not know his Maker, yea, they that call themselves his
own people; do not consider Isa. 1.3.
the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands Isa. 5.12.
. The Stork in the heavens knows her appointed times, and the turtle, and the
crane, and the swallow observe the time of their coming, but this man knows
not the judgment of the Lord Jer. 8.7.
. All the unregenerate are a people of no understanding; therefore he that made
them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no
favor Isa. 27.11.
. Well therefore may we, even in this sense conclude of the hypocrite, that he
also is but flesh Genesis 6.3.
, without any mind, or heart, or soul for God. The Scripture knows no
inner-man, but grace Ephesians. 3.16.
, which is called the hidden man of the heart, even in a gracious woman 1 Pet.
3.4.
, as well as in a man.

Thus only the Christian has an inner-man, which is his Citadel, whereinto
the flesh enters not; although even in his natural mind. Flesh has her strong
hold 2 Cor. 10.4.
, for which it may be called his fleshly mind Col. 2.18.
, so far as flesh has yet place in his mind. The hypocrite and unregenerate
man is all body and members, without a soul; all outer man, no inner-man; a
beast, and no man, in the things of God. The one, by help of the inner-man, is
able to reflect upon himself, and to behold clearly as in a mirror, not only
the new man, but all his earthly members of the Old man in him: the other, for
want of an inner-man, cannot know himself as he is, to be only flesh, because
the carnal eye cannot see corruption, no not in the glass of the Law.

The Christian looks upon, and entertaineth corruption as a Rebel.

He has a new Lord, and a new Law. And while the old Law of sin shows it self
in his members of the body of sin within him, he looks upon that as warring, or
rebelling against the Law of his mind Romans 7.23.
; setting up not only sin against grace; but, a Law, against Law, that gives
warrant to commit iniquity by a Law. Therefore he disarmeth this Rebel as much
as he may; herein imitating the wisdom of the Philistines (though in a more
just cause) who, having gotten advantage of the Israelites, disarmed them: For
so, grace takes away the weapons of sin (which are our members) from
corruption, and gives them unto God Romans 6.13.
.

Or herein, he rather deals with the Old man, as his Lord has done by that
strong man armed, the Devil, keeping his Palace and his goods in peace: for
Christ, a stronger than he, came upon him, and overcame him, and taking from
him all his armor wherein he trusted, he divided the spoil Luke 11.21, 22.
Col. 2.13.
. So the Christian never gives over fighting with the flesh, till he has put
it to the Sword; and, as David dealt with Goliath, take off his head, and given
his carcass to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the field 1 Samuel 17.46
.

Yet, as, notwithstanding all the policy and vigilance of the Philistines to
disarme Israel, Saul or Jonathan might catch a Spear, so, for all the
endeavor and diligence of grace, corruption may happily, catch an eye, and cause
it to look after a woman to lust after her Mat. 5.28.
; or, some other member* and make it a weapon of unrighteousness unto sin,
ere the Christian be aware, (as we see in David 2 Samuel 11.3
) to the wounding and endangering of the whole man. Therefore he is the more
careful to keep his watch, and will never make league, or truce with it, upon
any conditions.

Contrarily, In the unregenerate and hypocrite this Rebel has peaceable abode,
Differ.
and Dominion.

Corruption in him has the whole house of nature for his Arsenal, and quarter.
He commands all; and welcome. He either fears no War, or prepares to
make resistance. Every member is a weapon, and every faculty is an Armourer, to
forge and furbush the Artillery of sin. He expects a foreign War from the
New man and the Law of God, which he extremely hates and opposes, and
therefore calls in this Pharaoh Necho, this Egyptian King to his aid, although
a Rebel to his Sovereign.

And so far does he give up his power to this rebellious In-mate, as he is
content to let the very Law it self to make him more wicked than otherwise he
would be Romans 7.8. and ver. 13.
, merely to comply with this tyrannical guest. For, as the lime burns, by
pouring on water, which should in reason quench it; so concupiscence is
increased by the Law, which should by right destroy and abolish it. And so, the
War which should be waged with this Rebel is carried on against the Law, and
that with such spite, as to do whatsoever may cross the Law, upon this very
reason only that he will cross it.

But the hypocrite in this state fears no Civil War, between him and his
companion, or rather Lord, the Old man within him. All is quiet within; saving
as Thieves sometimes fall out, and wicked men wrangle one with another among
themselves: so possibly the hypocrite and corruption, upon some points may
jangle and squabble. But whether side soever prevails, it matters not: sin
and Satan are sure to be no loosers, but gainers by it. For, by this division,
the regiment or government of sin becomes more certain, and more dreadful.
When the breach is made up, the hypocrite must part with somewhat more than he
did before; and the other, who at first seemed to be confined within some
certain limits and laws, by degrees comes to exercise an absolute arbitrary
tyranny; and the hypocrite dares do no more, but say, I thank you, Sir.

Thus, the Christian opposing sin as a Rebel, is at peace with God; the
hypocrite entertaining sin, as a friend makes himself a Rebel. Corruption in
the regenerate is like a Tyrone in Ireland, affronted by the royal forces, till
he be mastered and made prisoner by the forces of Christ, the graces of the
Spirit: in the other, it is like the Great Turk in Constantinople, ruling all
by power, without resistance, yet without right.

The regenerate man may be taken prisoner, and led captive by corruption by
force, but not by consent.

He is too often a prisoner, but he never goes into prison of himself. He will
not buy his liberty to sin, by yielding himself a servant or a prisoner to sin.
He is a prisoner that watches all opportunities, and uses all his skill and
cunning to break prison.

It was said of Jacob and Esau, that the elder should serve the younger Genesis
25.23.
, yet sometimes Esau got the mastery. So it is in this case, Corruption, the
Esau, is the firstborn, and to be reckoned among the Latian Aborigines, or
Athenian Autochthones the first Inhabitants that were the natives of the place;
and Grace, as Jacob, is the puny: and, ordinarily, that is verified, the elder
is servant to the younger, corruption is under the command of grace: but, it
may, and does sometimes come to pass, that wicked and cursed Esau gets the
mastery, and leads Jacob captive: and then, woe to Jacob.

Then Paul himself may justly cry out, O wretched man that I am! For, if this
Esau might have his will, he would make a quick dispatch of Jacob, he would
smite also the mother with the children Genesis 32.11.
And can there be any more added to show the misery of a regenerate man? Can he
desire this day of misery? It is his misery that he has corruption dwelling in
him: but, to let it encroach upon him, to usurp over grace; to rebel against
and trample upon his better part, to make laws to cross the law of grace, to
rend him asunder, to divide himself from himself, and finally to lead him
captive after the triumphant chariot of sin and of death, this is intolerable,
and such a captivity as the Christian cannot possibly give consent unto; Heb.
12.4.
but rather resists unto blood striving against sin, till he can hold out no
longer: as well knowing that it will be sad with him, when he must be forced to
crave quarter of this implacable enemy.

This makes him like Eumenes, (that famous Macedonian, so dear to Philip, and
after to Alexander) who after many battles fought and victories achieved, was
betrayed by his own soldiers, and delivered into the power of the enemy. Yet
for all this, a Christian is free: and only he is free. He may be surprised by
fear, and detained for a season; but, yet free in mind and in heart, which he
demonstrateth by his complaining of his captivity, O wretched man, etc. no man
is willingly wretched, nor unwillingly happy. He is not quiet in this
imprisonment, but seeks out for rescue, and at length obtains it of Christ
himself, for which he gives thanks from his heart Romans 7.25.
.

Contrariwise, the hypocrite and unregenerate is held captive; but, Differ.
voluntarily.

He croucheth and fawneth, yea, falls at the foot of the old man, as Judah and
his brethren, to Joseph, even when they had done him no wrong, but he had put a
trick upon them, to scare, and fright them: And, in an insinuating way,
unworthily says, What shall I say unto my Lord, etc: Behold we are my Lords
servants, etc Genesis 44.16
. He is a willing captive, a voluntary slave, as appears by this, that he never
feels or complains of his captivity as one desirous to be released; yea, so
far from complaining, that he is angry and complains of any man that takes
notice that he is a prisoner. He is of the Pharisees mind, that will not be
beholding to Christ to set them free, we were never in bondage to any man John
8.33
.

He is Satan's slave, taken captive not only by Satan's will 2 Timothy 2.24
; but, by his own. He will not stay till the devil make him blind, or deaf,
but he winketh with his eyes, and stops his ears himself Act. 28.27
. It is the mind and will, that makes the man a captive. Till these give him
up, he is a freeman in himself, even which he is a prisoner unto another. Such
as are slaves to sin (as all unregenerate men are) (...), they have given up
themselves to lasciviousness, to work wick^dnesse with greediness Ephesians. 4.19.
. If corruption dare not, or will not adventure to take them prisoners, they
will come and render up themselves.

God indeed gives such up Romans 1.24
; but, it is first, to their own hearts lusts Psalm. 81.12
Then, to Satan 1 Timothy 1.20
. And then, they run, they rush into wickedness, as the horse rusheth into the
battle Jer. 8.6
: so that they may well say with that elegant Poet Corn. Gall,
, rapimur vitiis, trahimu^que volentes. We are hurried headlong by vices, and
are willing enough thereunto. Every such sinner is holden with the cords of his
own sin Prove. 5.22
. Sin is a cord, and the sinner is content, as Sampson to be bound with it,
even when he cannot so easily as Sampson, knap it in pieces. He will let sin
bind him, and bind him as fast as it can. Yea, he will strain this cord, if
too short to make him sure; that so, he may draw iniquity with cords of vanity,
and sin as it were with a cart-rope Isa. 5.18
, that will not break.

Nectunt qua valiant trahi catenam Boeth.
. Sinners prepare the chain by which they may be haled to prison. He need not
be driven to the slaughter: he is no sooner tempted, but he goes straightway
as the Ox Prove. 7.22
, that dreameth of a fresh pasture, and so goes willingly to the
slaughterhouse. The hypocrite fears nothing, he is happy enough. He
distrusteth nothing, he is strong enough: no need of Christ, he is good enough:
he desires no rescue, he is free enough: he gives no thanks, he is proud enough.

Thus, the Christian is as Jehoshaphat, encompassed with Aramites, but
presently cries out of the danger, and is delivered 2 Chro. 18.31
: the other when ensnared, goes merrily, as a fool to the correction of the
stocks Prove. 7.22
; or as Agag, that goes pleasantly to execution 1 Samuel 15.32
. The one is as Paul, sold under sin Romans 7.14
, ((...), hasta captus sub hasta venditus; for so was the manner, to sell for
slaves such as were taken in the wars:) but the other as Ahab, sells himself
to work wickedness 1 King. 21.25
; and so, is worthy to be a villain, that sells himself for a slave. The one
tempereth corruption what he may, that it may not prevail too far; the other
temporizeth with it, till he become an absolute slave.

CHAP. III. A Christian disadvantaged by Parentage or defects of body. Is he,
Defin.
in whom the imperfections and blemishes of Nature, or of the outward man, are
a discouragement, and a disparagement to grace.
NAture is many ways a stepmother to grace; and this way among the rest,
that, by means of bodily defects and blemishes by birth, or happening
afterward by Providence, the vigor of the mind is much weakened, especially
in the pursuit of heavenly things: And, the Christian, disheartened, until
grace so far prevail, as to compensate the defects of nature. And this it does,
by supplying him with a comeliness of a better kind than that of nature, or
of the body: because it not only covers the deformities of nature, but
advances the beauties of grace.

This is a subject wherein not all, but some Christians only, are concerned:
namely, such as labor under some particular blemishes, or defects, happening
in respect of Nation, wicked and unworthy Parents, illegitimate procreation,
bodily deformity, or infirmity by lamenesse or sickness. Of all which, the
Holy Ghost takes notice; but in different manner. When he looks upon these
things in relation to the Law, he marks them with a cole. When he beholds them
in a Christian freed from that law, yet subject to these, or any of these
infirmities, he speaks comfort and encouragement.

These, or most of them were prejudicial, under the Old Testament, in relation
to the Ordinances and Privileges of the Law. A stranger or servant
uncircumcised, might not eat the Passover Exodus 12.48
. If he would worship, it must be at a distance, not approaching so near as an
Israelite, until the middle wall of partition was broken down Ephesians. 2.14
. Nor might Gods own people offer any thing to God, which the hands of a
stranger had touched; had he been but a servant, and, at his Masters command,
but brought it to the place where the Master was to deliver it into the hands
of the Priest Lev. 22.25
. A bastard might not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to his
tenth generation Deuteronomy. 23.2
, although circumcised. He might not claim the privileges of one of Gods
people; although both his Parents were of Abraham according to the flesh.

Deformity of body, made even the sons of Aaron incapable of exercising the
Priesthood. None that was blind, lame, flat nosed, broken footed, broken
handed, broken backed; or, had any thing superfluous; or, was a dwarf; or, had
a blemish in his eye; or, were scurvy, scabbed, or had his stones broken (which
argues a rejection of those who had the most secret infirmities of body) might
not come nigh, to offer the offerings of the Lord Lev. 2.18
.

The bodies of the sacrifices of themselves must then be all perfect also.
Whatsoever had any blemish, might not be offered Lev. 22.20
. Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvey, or scabbed, or
having any thing superfluous, or lacking his parts; or, that is bruised, or
broken, or cut, might not be offered: for, it should not be accepted Ibid.
. Neither would God permit any legal uncleanness of body, in those that
brought a sacrifice, whether it were by running in the reins Lev. 15.2
, noctornal pollution Ver. 16
, or by touching any dead body, either of man, or beast Lev. 11.24
: or, were smitten with leprosy Lev. 13.3
; or were any other way unclean, according to the rules and repute of the
Levitical Law.

No man, even of Aarons sons, if, a leper; or, had the running of the reins;
or, if he had but touched any thing that was unclean by the dead; or had his
seed going from him; or, touched any creeping thing, or any man of whom he
might take uncleanness, might eat of the holy things, until he had washed his
flesh with water Lev. 22.4, 5, 6
, and were legally clean.

But, under the Gospel; and, in relation to the Covenant of Grace, (even while
the first Tabernacle, and Levitical Ordinances were yet standing, as well as
sithence) Nation, Parentage, Beauty, Strength, etc. were not, are not either
necessary to acceptance, or furtherances unto grace, (although blessings in
themselves;) but, for the most part, through abuses, hindrances thereunto. And
therefore, the want of those things cannot exclude from grace; albeit it may
daunt, and weaken the hands of some, subject to such defects; until, by the
help of grace, they be made truly holy, and so (notwithstanding these
disadvantages) become more excellent than their neighbors Prove. 12.26
void of grace, although adorned with all those things which nature can furnish
a mere natural man withal, to make a fairer show to the world.

Yea, it pleases the wise and good God, who calls not many mighty or noble 1
Cor. 1.26
, (yet, of them, some; willing that all, to wit, some of all Nations, and
degrees, should be saved, 1 Timothy 2.4
) that some, yea that the greater part of those that are effectually called,
should want some privileges of nature that might commend them to the eyes of
men, which are afforded to others. And yet even such deficients in nature, are
made, by grace, far to excel, yea, to confound those, who have all that
nature and birth can bestow upon them, but are empty of holiness.

The best Christians are not woven altogether of the woof of grace: nor, the
worst men, with all the imperfections of nature. The best Christian is mixed
with the warp of nature, not only as nature is corrupted in qualities by sin,
but as deformed in the substance and faculties as a punishment of the first
sin. And this nature has many knots and knurles in it, that will show
themselves in the wearing, notwithstanding all the endeavors of grace to
smooth them. Howbeit, in the eyes of God, such a Christian, so prejudiced by
nature, appears more beautiful than the best of those, who are warp, all
nature. Differ.


On the contrary, the natural and bodily imperfections of the hypocrite and
unregenerate; are servants to the vices of his soul.

Where grace interveneth not, it is a true rule, crooked bodies, crooked
souls. And it is as true, of all other blemishes of nature, and bodily
deformities. God does not leave those marks of his displeasure and just
indignation against sin in general, to be as bare bunches in a tree, or as
scarres that are healed in those particular persons so deformed; but, as Items
and warnings to all that behold them, to take more special heed of them, as of
those that are more than ordinarily wicked and dangerous, where grace changes
not nature, by expelling those more than ordinary fumes and spumes of corrupt
nature, out of such stigmatized bodies which naturally hold more of wickedness
than others, as the wens or kernels dispersed into several parts of the natural
body, draw and suck up the superfluities of nature that otherwise would
distemper and oppress it.

He has also a woof added to his warp: not that of the regenerate, which is
the woof of grace; but, of custom, and ill manners, conformable to his defects
of nature, body, or breeding. And so, being accustomed to do evil Jer. 13.23
; he cannot but be exceeding sinful; and, the more means he has to reclaim
him, the more sinful he becomes Romans 7.13
. For, where deformity of body, or other defects or disparagements makes a man
to be slighted, jeered, or unacceptable, corruption of nature (without grace)
puts him on to study revenge for the defects of nature; wherein, the devil
exceedingly helps to make worse a crooked soul in a despicable body. It was
not for nothing that God would not admit such to serve at his Altar, who uses
not to take exception at such bodily blemishes, but where he finds something
suitable thereunto in the soul, making it averse from his service.

Thus, the Christian laboring under natural or adventitious discouragements,
is like a ship well built, that can, by the help of a prudent guide, make use
of a cross wind, to carry on his voyage to heaven: the hypocrite and
unregenerate, following only nature, and striving without grace, is as one that
saileth to no purpose, as the wind and tide carry him. The one has a beauty
that covers all the deformities of nature; the other has a lothsomnesse of
soul that makes not only his body, but whole man (how perfect soever) the
abhorrency of God and man.

A Christian may be disadvantaged inregard of his Nation or Country, yet
without prejudice to his soul.

He may be the son of a stranger, yet (having joined himself to the Lord) he
shall have no cause to speak, saying, the Lord has utterly separated me from
his people Isa. 56.3
. For, even him, joining himself to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the
Name of the Lord to be his servant, keeping the Sabbath, and taking hold of his
Covenant, will God bring to his holy mountain and make joyful in his house of
prayer Ver. 6, 7
. Such an one shall soon perceive that God is no accepter of persons: but that,
in every Nation, he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted
with him Act. 10.34, 35
. Not only the Grecian is made equal with the Jew, without difference, or
distinction, in the unity of the body of Christ Gal. 3.28
: but also the Barbarian and Scythian are made equal with the Greek Col. 3.11
, who accounted all Nations beside themselves, barbarous: but more especially
the Scythian; whence it became as great a wonder that Anacharsis should be a
Philosopher, as to find Saul, among the Prophets 1 Samuel 10.11
.

The Cretians had a very ill name. Yea, one of their own Prophets, (or Poets
Ephemerides a Southsayer, as well as a Poet.
) testifies of them, that they were always liers, evil beasts, slow bellies,
which witness was true. Yet, Titus must not despair of making some good even
among them; by rebuking them sharply that they might be sound in the faith Tit.
1.12, 13
; who were usually joined with the worst in that common byword, (...).
Cappadocians, Cretians, and Cilicians begin their names with the same most
unluckie letter, arguing their too much likeness in manners. Howbeit, we read
of Saints even in Cappadocea 1 Pet. 1.1
, of Christians in Creet Tit. 1.5
, and of brethren in Cilicia Acts 15.23
. Yea, Paul himself was a Cilician, borne in Tarsus, as to the soil wherein he
was brought forth Act. 22.23
, although by descent a Jew, to whom all the Alphabet can scarcely afford one
comparable.

But a Christian has not only his conversation in heaven Phil. 3.20
, as a stranger sojourning or trafficking there, but he is a Citizen borne, and
free of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is above, and free, and the mother of all
Gal. 4.26
believers, without difference of Nation or Country. For, of every one that is
borne of God, whether Babylonian, Philistine* Tyrian, Etheopian, etc. it shall
be said, in relation to Zion, that this and that man was borne there Psalm.
87.4, 5
, in regard of his acceptance with God, and of his admittance to all her
privileges.

Whatsoever is barbarous in her disciples, Christianity banisheth: so that it
is a wonder to see, that, notwithstanding all differences of regions and
climates, they that fear God are all of the same condition and quality, and
may be known to be the same fathers children. God turns to all his people a
pure language (or lip) that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to
serve him with one consent Zeph. 3.9
. In the very Cities of Egypt, they speak the language of Canaan Isa. 19.18
.

Howbeit, as the Ephraimites were discovered by pronouncing Sibboleth in stead
of Shibboleth Judge. 12.6
. And as Livy, although an elegant Latinist, as well as a grave Historian,
being a Patavian (that is, borne in Padua) could not forbear to use some
Patavinity in his style (as Quintilian terms it Li. 1. c. 5.
) that is, some expressions and language which argued him to be of that City:
so the dear Saints of God may possibly carry some Patronimical mark of their
Country and Education, in their behavior, not becoming the graces of God in
them, (as we see in some, rudely, and meanly bred;) yet such, as may consist
with true sanctification, although tanned and brought almost into the
Black-mores hue by such imperfections.

Contrarily, the unregenerate bears that native reproach, not only to his
grave, Differ.
but to his damnation.

He is one of those that not only derive from Japhet, and is a Gentile by
progeny, which is in every age the worse for the wearing; but he is stigmatized
to be a sinner of the Gentiles Gal. 2.15
. By continuance in sin and infidelity making him a perpetual stranger to God
and Christ. Such an one was Doeg, who being wicked and bloody, is thrice in one
chapter 1 Samuel 22.9 18, 22
, and once in the book of Psalms Ps. 52. in the title.
* called, by way of reproach, Doeg the Edomite, for that (at the command of
Saul) he butchered in one day eighty five persons that wear a linen Ephod,
and destroyed Nob the city of the Priests, killing men, women, children and
sucklings, and oxen, asses, and sheep with the edge of the sword 1 Samuel 22.19
.

Thus also Haman, another egg of the same bird, to wit, of the stock of Esau,
is branded with his pedigree several times, as a mark of disgrace; Haman the
son of Hammedatha the Agagite Esth 3.1. 8.5 9, 24
: who was an Amalekite, and the worst slip of the basest issue of Esau. For,
however he were of the race of the Kings of the Amalekites, to which the common
name was Agag, (as Pharaoh, and afterward Ptolomie, to the Kings of Egypt) as
appears by comparing several Scriptures 1 Samuel 15.8. in Samuels time, Numb.
24.7. in Moses time.
together; yet Agag descended of Amalech, the base son of Eliphaz, the eldest
son of Esau Genesis 36.10, 12
. So that though the Agagites were gotten highest among the Amalekites, yet
were they the most mischievous to Israel, as appears by the severity used by
Samuel upon Agag, even after Saul had spared him 1 Samuel 15.33
. Yea, the whole race of Edom, (a name of scorn given to Esau Genesis 25.30
, and therefore often given as a brand in Scripture to his posterity Genesis 36.8,
19 43
) is not only shamed and condemned for their implacable cruelty to Jacob their
brothers seed Obad. 10
, but made and called the people of Gods curse Isa. 34.5.
.

Many of that family have been noted to be extremely wicked, among whom, Herod
the Great was one of whom it might truly be said -- Ardet vitio gentis suoque
he flamed under all the vices of his Nation, and his own to boot. He it was
that got the complete Mastery of Jacob Genesis 27.40
, when he came, by the favor of Augustus, to be made King over the race of
Jacob, when Shiloh came, and the Scepter departed from Judah Genesis 49.10
. But, we never read of any one good of that stock, unless Eliphaz the
Temanite, the friend of Job Job 2.11
, who descended of Teman eldest son to Eliphaz the first borne of Esau, by Adah
his wife Genesis 36.10, 11
. Therefore are they joyned-together with Ishmaelites, Moabites, Hagarens,
Gebal and Ammon Ps. 83.6.7
, etc. who by an epidemical hatred were perpetual enemies to the Church of God,
for which he called them his evil neighbors, whom he plucked out of their land
Jer. 12.14
, and left their name for a curse unto his people, to all generations.

Thus, the regenerate are as useful plants which being removed, do alter their
nature according to the soil whereinto they are transplanted: but the
unregenerate are as those Travelers of whom it may be said, Coelum, non animum
mutant, they change climate, but not their mind and disposition: They are
moveable in regard of place, but immutable in regard of their perverseness of
heart. The one are strangers, but naturalized in condition and affection; the
other are estranged from the womb Psalm. 58.3
; and so, continue aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from
the Covenant of Promise Ephesians. 2 12
.

A Christian may be the child of mean, yea, of very wicked Parents, and yet
himself

That God who looks not at nature, (so as to have respect of persons) but
acts according to his own free grace, delights to act most, where his grace
may appear most free. Not that God delights to see men poor, much less to
take any pleasure in their wickedness: but as ordering the meannesse, and
wickedness of men so, as that neither of them shall be an hindrance to his
free grace. For, he chooses the poor of this world, to make them rich in faith
and heirs of the Kingdom Jam. 2.5
: and that, not without great wisdom, as well as goodness: for God has chosen
the base things of the world, and things which are despised; yea, and things
that are not, to bring to naught things that are; that no flesh should glory in
his presence 1 Cor. 1.28, 29
.

Nor is the wickedness of the parent (which may be a grief to the child, and
a prejudice among men) any bar to the free grace of God to the child. For,
albeit he visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, to the third and
fourth generation of them that hate him: yet it is only upon such children as
live and continue in the same sins of their fathers: not upon those that fear
and love him. And so it is in the case of mothers, as well as of the fathers.
Where sin runs in a line, it proves like a snowball, bigger and bigger; and so,
the provocation being not only continued, but augmented, it cannot be expected
but that the judgment should be not only lengthned, but very grievous, like
the thunder and hail, and fire that ran along upon the ground in the land of
Egypt Exodus 9.23
.

But, where the course of sin is cut off, and God honored and served by the
son, that was highly dishonored by the Father, the son shall never need to
fear to have his teeth set on edge, by the sour grapes that were eaten by his
father Ezekiel. 18.2
; but he shall ever find that verified by God, them that honor me, I will
honor 1 Samuel 2.30
. Yea, it not seldom happens, that where grace is bestowed upon the son of a
wicked father, that son out-shines most of his contemporaries that are
eminent for Religion.

Who, that ever had sat on the throne of Judah, was worse than Ahaz? For
besides all the wickedness he committed in the business of the Altar of
Damascus, and his sacrilege, in the house of the Lord 2 Ring. 16.
; but, in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord
(so that the Spirit of God points the finger to him as to the monster of his
age, this is that King Ahaz.) For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which
smote him. And he said, because the gods of Syria help them, therefore will I
sacrifice to them, that they may help me: but they proved the ruin of him, and
of all Israel 2 Chr. 28.22, 23
. Yet he was the father of good Hezekiah verse 27
, who was not only an excellent Prince, but an excellent man.

So, incomparable Josiah (like unto whom there was no King before him, etc.
neither after him arose any like him 2 King. 23.25
) was the son of wicked, most wicked Amon, that for his wickedness and
tyranny, was slain by his servants in his own house 2 King. 21.23
. And even Jeroboam himself that had made so many thousands to commit idolatry,
had yet one son, in whom there was found some good thing toward the Lord God
of Israel 1 King 14.13
. Yea, the Lord himself puts the case of the good son of a wicked father, who
shall not be excluded from mercy for the wickedness of the father Ezekiel. 18.14,
etc.
. It cannot be but a reproach among men, and a blot to a child of God: yet the
power of God over-mastereth all.

Differ.
Contrariwise, In the unregenerate personal and paternal corruptions are
hereditary.

Original corruption is hereditary to all. So also, till regeneration, are
personal corruptions: they descend to posterity, until God, by his grace, dry
up that issue, as the leprosy of Naaman, that fell upon the seed of Gehazi for
ever, as well as upon himself 2 King. 5.27
. It is true, that every one of the race do not perhaps equally give vent to
the same wickedness, in the same manner and degree, because some are held in
by restraining grace; others, by education; and some, by the minglings of the
concurrent substance of the parents, may somewhat vary the constitution, and
consequently the disposition inclining him more to some other corruption. But,
ordinarily what ever was the predominant corruption in the ancestour, runs
strongest in the veins and inclination of the posterity, until the branches of
this wild Olive tree be planted into the true Olive, to partake of the root
and fatness of the same Romans 11.17
.

Thus Belshazzer (a chip of a proud block) walked in the steps of haughty
Nebuchadnezzar his father, imitating his fathers pride, notwithstanding the
dreadful example of Gods hand upon his father in so fearful a manner Dan. 5.20,
21
. As the fathers heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, so was
the sons, though he knew all that which befell his father Verse 23
, and therefore not only was he himself slain, but the Kingdom and Empire
of the Chaldeans translated to the Medes Verse 31
.

Of Jeroboams race there lived not one good: yea, all his successors trod in
the same paths which he first walked in himself: so that from first to last,
Jehu himself not excepted 2 King. 20.31
, they were all wicked, verifying the proverb, (...), an ill egg of an ill
crow. And in this case the birth often follows the belly, whom many though they
had good fathers followed, as is noted in the holy story, wherein, as a reason
of the wickedness of Princes, the names of their M^thers are inserted: but
especially that one marriage of Athaliah the daughter of Ahab, unto Jehoram,
the son of Jehoshaphat 2 Chronicles. 22.2
, is noted as the occasion not only of much sin and mischief committed by
Jehoram in his reign 2 Chronicles. 21.6
, (who did evil in the sight of the Lord, because he had the daughter of Ahab
to wife) but also of a continued succession of iniquity and misery for seven
generations. Not one good King to sit upon the Throne of David from Jehoshaphat
to Hezekiah.

Thus, the true Christian descended of wicked parents, does as Pharaohs
daughter was taught, Ps. 45 10, 11
He forgetth his own people, and his fathers house: But of the unregenerate so
descended, it may be said as of sinful Jerusalem, Thy father was an Amorite,
and thy mother an Hittite Ezekiel. 16 3
: and, as is the mother, so is the daughter verse 44
: the one is as a Cedar graffed upon a shrub, or a Firre-tree instead of a
Throne Esaias 55.13
; the other is as the Vine which is of the Vine of Sodom and of the fields of
Gomorah Deuteronomy. 32.32
.

To the Christian, even bastardy hinders not the heavenly birth.

He who is carnally mis-begotten of man, may, notwithstanding that blemish,
afterward be spiritually begotten of God. This sin of the parents is not
imputed to the child, who was not in fault of such an issue. Many have been
famous men that have been so begotten. Of their valor and prowess beyond
others there may be given a reason in nature: many of them also studying to
wipe off the blot of their illegitimate conception, with generous and heroic
attempts worthy of noble spirits. But, of their being born again no reason can
(nor need) be given but the free grace of God even to some such spurious slips.

Jepthe, although base borne, is ennobled by his faith Heb. 11.32
, being ranged in the list of those glorious Worthies which make up that cloud
of witnesses, propounded for patterns to all believers* to run with patience
the race that is set before them Heb. 12.1
. Yea, even in Christ's own pedigree; even Pharez is not omitted Mat. 1* 3
, although begotten in incest Genesis 38.19 and 39.
. Which may comfort a Christian apt to be too much dejected, if lying under
such a blot.

The like may be said against the discouragement and disparagement of being
descended of base parents, or being the son or daughter of a slave, or of a
bondwoman. For that also may be incident to an heir of grace: for the body of
Christ consists of bond as well as of free Gal. 3.28
; or rather, of no distinction between bond and free. And so that the son of
the bondwoman becomes the son of the free woman; so that he no longer a child
of the bondwoman, but of the free G^l. 4 31
.

On the contrary, the unregenerate bears not only the shame but the sin of
his birth, with interest.

It becomes his shame and sin, oft-times by being afterward more faulty in
the same kind himself; or, at least it makes him impudent, insolent, envious,
as may be notoriously seen in Abimelech Judge. 9.1, 2 etc
, the base son of Gideon Judge 8.31
: and in that cursed mungrel begotten by an Egyptian, on an Israelitish woman,
which son striving with a man of Israel, blasphemed Lev. 24.10.11
, and was afterward stoned for it. To whom we may very well add Caesar Borgia
the bastard of Pope Alexander the sixth, a man so extremely wicked beyond all
that were before him, that Matchiavel makes him the Idea and pattern of his
damned policy. All baseness and incivility is usually found in every base and
brutish generation, as a professed enemy to Christian ingenuity, as abundantly
appears in the wild and untamed Irish, who abhor all Religon (except the
slavery of Popery) and government.

Yea, such is the fruitfulness of sin, in what soil soever it takes root,
that the longer it stays in a family, the worse it grows: not as trees planted
in an orchard, which, by time sucks out the heart of the ground, and so they
become sterile, and at length die of themselves; but, as nettles in a dunghill,
that every time they seed, do multiply, and send forth more and worse fruit;
according to that no less elegant than true expression of a vicious Poet
Horat. Car. l. 3. ad 6. of whom Suetonius thus, Ad res venereas intemperantior
traditur. N^m. in vit. Hor.
, Aetas parentum pejor avis, tulit
Nos nequiores, mox daturos
Progeniem vitiosiorem.
Our Parents, worse than Grand-sires, bare
Us, who, yet worse than fathers were,
More vicious fruit shall shortly bear.


Thus, the Christian, from the basest dunghill rises up as high as heaven;
the unregenerate, from a spurious original, grows down-ward as low as hell: the
one, if good, none better: the other, if bad, none worse.

The Christian is sometimes subject to deformity and ill shape of body.

Deformity, whether by nature, or accident, is a disparagement to virtue, and a
blemish to noble actions: but, it is overcome by grace, which makes even
blackness to be comely. For Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, or black-more, was yet
a man beautiful by grace, showing more courage for God, and compassion to his
Prophet, than all the great men and Jews in Zedekiahs Court Jer 38.7. and^.
. The Ethiopian Eunuch, washed by baptism, had a white soul Act. 8.37 ^8 39
.

Leah, though tender or bleer-eyed, yet was more amiable in the eyes of God
than Rachel, who loved idols so well as to rob her own father of his gods Genesis
31.19
; and, to cover them with a lie verse 34.35
. Ehud, though lame of his right hand, yet with his left hand, he was an
instrument of killing Eglon the King of Moab Judge. 3 15. and
, and thereby of delivering Israel out of the hands of the Moabites; but, of
delivering the Moabites into the hands of Israel verse 28
. Mephibosheth, lame by a fall at nurse 2 Samuel 4.4
, yet had a more loyal heart to God, and his servant David than the sycophant
Ziba, his guardian, notwithstanding all his glavering 2 Samuel 16.^ 2 Samuel 19.24,
and^.
.

He that lay at the p^ole of Bethesda John 5.5
many years and could not stir, nor obtain a cure, because others stepped in
before him John 5.5
. He that was borne blind, and without all hope of cure John 9.32
: and the criple that lay at the beautiful gate of the Temple, to beg alms
Acts 3.2
, not to expect cure, proved more valiant champions and stout confessors of
Christ, and of the name of Jesus by which they were cured, than many of his
professed Disciples, who, upon any offense taken, left him in plain ground,
and would walk no more with him John 6.66
. And, these defects, even in those that are not cured, yet sanctified, they
are helps to take off their affections from the world, which without just
cause, so much contemns them for those defects. The world is most crucified
to him that is most crucified to the world Gal. 6.14
.

Differ.
Contrarily, to the unregenerate, bodily blemishes breed a greater deformity in
the mind.

Men, so marked, grow either impudent, being inured to scorn: or envious
against those of better feature, (giving out that they are wanton, or proud:)
or, cruel and revengeful upon unkind nature; or insolent, in resisting the
hand of God upon them; resolving rather to hazard life it self by undergoing
desperate cures, than to lie under those deformities by God inflicted upon
them: or, too self-loving, to bestow more upon themselves than is meet, to
recompense the want of love and respect from others.

Hence that proverb, cavete ab ijs quos Deus signavit. Beware of them whom God
has marked. The best choice is, a sound mind in a sound body; a lovely mind
in a beautiful body. But, if there must needs be a defect in either, better is
wisdom which recompenceth the defect of bodily beauty, than folly where bodily
feature excels Eccles. 2.13
, Ingenio formae damna rependo meae. My wit (said he) makes amends for the lack
of beauty. But much more does grace recompense the want of feature; and, the
want of feature does much add to the loathsomeness of a graceless soul.

Thus, the Christian is beautiful in the midst of deformity: the unregenerate
is deformed, in the midst of beauty: the one is a crooked Saint; the other, a
crooked Serpent.

A Christian may be abashed with sickliness, and impotency of body.

Even bodily health and strength are great helps to spiritual assaults, which
work more upon sickness, weakness, age, etc. than upon others in whom nature
sanctified can afford more helps to the inner man assaulted by frowardness,
covetousness, timorousness and the like. Young men have more strength than
others over-worne by age: and, if they have the Word of God abiding in them,
they are strong indeed to overcome the evil one 1 John 2.14
. The want therefore of health, strength, vigor of spirits must needs be a
great disadvantage wherever it lights: yet, where grace is and rules, these
infirmities are an help to mortification, to patience, and to the neglect of
worldly things.

For, the sick serve God in suffering patiently, as their proper obedience:
for, even Christ himself is said to have learned obedience by the things which
he suffered Heb 5.8
. The soul many times gets health by the sickness of the body. David never
attained to a better temper and measure of spiritual health, than when he was
most over-laid with bodily sickness, perhaps procured for the extremity of
grief for his sins Ps. 6.6, 7, etc. Psalm. 32.4, 5
. Hence, the Eunuch may take comfort, although he be a dry and barren tree,
that, by grace, he has even in Gods house, and within his walls, a place and
name better than of sons and daughters, and that God will give him an
everlasting name that shall not be cut off Esaias 55.5 (...).
. And prayer better becomes age, than arms, and alms.

Contrariwise. A wicked man is never the weaker servant of sin, for bodily
weakness. Differ.


If he be disabled from some sins, he is the more addicted to other. The
continued adulterer, when disabled by his own wickedness as well as by age, to
act that sin, is then as much in heart (if not more) a filthy person still, as
in his greatest vigor of body; and, a greater teacher, and provoker of others
to the same wickedness. Men turn pandors; and harlots become bauds to others,
not only for lucre, but for love of the sin. Otherwise other trades less
sinful, and more advantageous would be taken up by them. That course of life
which any man voluntarily takes up, especially if unlawful and dangerous
proclaims to all, which way the heart is most bent.

So witches, and other envious persons, the more unable to wreak their teen
upon such as they hate, malice supplieth the defect of natural abilities, or of
want of power, and opportunity: and, rather than fail, the devil himself is
called in to assist them in their devilish designs. So others, grow more
froward to all about them, in time of sickness, as being more impatient and
murmuring against God, because they have not health, lims, strength, etc. as
well as others. These, are not unlike the vassals of Antichrist, justly
suffering extraordinary plagues for their voluntary slavery, that gnawed their
tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and
their sores, but repented not of their deeds Rev. 16.10, 11
.

Thus, the Christian is as Job, patiently suffering the hand of God, and
blessing his name, even when smitten not only in his goods and relations, but
in his own person, so that his flesh is clothed with worms, and clods of
dust, and his skin broken, and become loathsome Job 7.5
, and his very breath become strange to his wife Job 19.17
; the hypocrite and unregenerate is as Jobs wife, that persuades him rather
than to live longer under such misery, to curse God, and die Job 2.9
: that is, so to provoke God by cursing and blasphemy, as to draw out his hand
against him to smite him with death, and thereby to rid him (as she conceived)
out of his pain: the one is as the converted thief upon the Cross, rebuking
his fellow, and praying to Christ: the other is as the unconverted thief, that,
for anguish, reviled Christ, and died blapspheming.

CHAP. IV. A Christian laboring under natural defects of the mind, Is he in
whom the temperature and constitution of the body are an hindrance to the
perfections of the soul. Defin.

THere are many defects in the mind (which are great disadvantages to nature as
well as to grace) arising from the body. Here, that holds, the soul
follows the temperature of the body. For, otherwise, all men being left unto
themselves, should be either foolish or wicked, or wise and honest, alike;
because all men's souls are alike by Creation, and all alike partakers of
original corruption. But nature is more bountiful to some than to others, even
where there is not any discriminating grace from above, to distinguish them.

Great and manifold is the difference in men, in regard of complexion, and
constitution. Some more witty, sober, constant, etc. some, more dull, blockish,
lascivious, intemperate, fickle, etc. Whence the Philosophers are forced to
acknowledge certain natural virtues, although they will not admit them to be
(...), that is, virtues properly so called. And, among vices, some are
acknowledged to be natural, as other ill qualities are contracted by disease,
evil company, high feeding, idleness, etc. and some, brutish, incident to
none but to such as are of savage disposition, as it is noted of Agrippa
Posthumus, Grandchilde of Augustus Tacit.
, and sundry others.

In the wisdom therefore, that is after the flesh, (I mean not, corrupt wisdom,
but that which is natural, and according to reason) there may be difference
between one man and another: and, the disadvantage may fall to Gods child, as
is observed by him in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
Col. 2.3
, that the children of this world are in their generation, wiser than the
children of light Luke 16.8
: not wiser for heaven, but more subtle for themselves in the world. And such
are they of whom the Apostle thus; not many wise men after the flesh, meaning
it, not of sinful corruption, but of the emprovement of nature 1 Cor. 1.26
, which being renewed and assisted by grace, makes a far greater emprovement
than the world is capable of.

Differ.
On the contrary, the unregenerate excuses the imperfections of his soul, by
the constitution of his body.

The sins of his soul take Sanctuary under the temperature of his body; and he
thinks this to be (if not warrant, yet) excuse sufficient for all his
exorbitances. If overtaken with lust, drunkenness, choler, etc. his plea is
this; It is my nature, I cannot help it, the very constitution of my body
carries me violently upon it, I hope God will not impute it, etc. This Apology,
although Nabal had not the wisdom to make for himself, yet Abigail his wife
made it for him, to his shame, although to his safety. Let not my Lord regard
this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his
name, and folly is with him 1 Samuel 25.25
. Even fools have so much wit, as to think all they do must pass without
offense, because of their folly, which wise men will rather contemn, than take
notice of.

But, the unregenerate under color of fatuity, and defects of nature borne
together with him, endeavors to make use of that plea to excuse all that folly
which he, by the sinfulness and malice of his heart, has contracted, and as
it were engraffed upon the other: yea, which he, without just cause of
complaining of the defects of nature, would father upon nature, to excuse the
wickedness of his heart, when nature is no way deficient, but liberal to him.
Thus, the fool (in the Original, it is, Nabal) has said in his heart there is
no God Psalm. 14.1
. It is not the natural fool, but Nabal that says so. And, Nabal is no
Natural, as appears by the churlish arguments he used against supplying of
David. Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? He knew him well enough;
for he knew his Parentage (which David's servants did not tell him:) and so his
interrogation, is not made as not knowing him; but as scorning him and his
request. The observation also that he makes of servants breaking away from
their Masters, was a close and malicious quip to David, for his flying from
Saul. There be many servants now adays that break away every man from his
Master 1 Samuel 25.10, 11
. Shall I then take my bread and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers,
and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be? These words have weight in
them, and not easily to be answered (if David were such as Nabal would pretend
him to be,) therefore, not the words of a natural. Yet the wicked fool clothes
himself under this Livery of a natural, and so thinks he may speak of God what
he list, because forsooth, he knows no better.

Thus, the Christian labors under natural defects of the mind with a desire
to be rid of them, as David and his men kept on the other side of the mountain,
making haste to get away from Saul 1 Samuel 23.26
: the unregenerate desires to retain those defects; and, to make show of those
that are not in him, to cover that sinfulness with which he abounds: not
unlike to David in another case 1 Samuel 20, 13
, who feigned himself mad, and scrabled on the doors, and let his spittle fall
upon his beard; that he might not be found out to be what he was: the one looks
upon such defects as a blemish; the other, as a fence.

A Christian may be a dullard in regard of understanding and capacity.

In regard of natural capacity he may be heavy and dull; but yet, in the things
of God, he is taught by a Law that makes wise the simple Psalm. 19.7
. Such naturally, are most scholars in the School of Christ: very children in
understanding 1 Cor. 14.20
, dull of hearing Heb. 5.11
, and, dull of apprehension as those that are but newly weaned from the milk,
and drawn from the breasts, to whom precept must be upon precept, precept upon
precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little Isa. 28.9, 10
: and yet all little enough to make them to understand doctrine.

Many Christians are troubled with this dullness, in so much that whereas for
the time they might have been teachers, they have need that one teach them
again which he the first principles of the Oracles of God, and are such as have
need of milk, and not of strong meat, being unskilful in the word of
righteousness, for they are babes Heb. 5.12, 13
. We see this in the very Apostles themselves who understood not many of those
things which Christ preached unto them, although to them it were given to
understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven Mar. 9.32 Luke 18.31, 34
, in regard of grace bestowed by God, not of nature, to be of quick
understanding in those mysteries.

They are perpetual petties and A. B.C-daries in the things of the Kingdom.
Mat. 13.11
And that not only in regard of the common and humane inability for the high
mysteries of godliness which every sanctified man best sees and most
bewaileth in himself, saying with Agur, Surely I am more brutish than any man,
and have not the understanding of a man Prove. 30.2
: but also in regard of personal and special dullness, more in some than in
others; and, sometimes more in a Christian than in a child of wrath. There are
some good men of whom Christ (who used not to upbraid, without great cause) was
fain to complain, saying, O fools, and slow of heart, to believe all that the
Prophets have spoken Luke 24.25
. Yea, he found cause to upbraid the eleven Apostles, with their unbelief, and
hardness of heart Mar. 16.14
.

It is true that God requires not of every man alike measure, nor alike
clearness, of knowledge. He requires not so much knowledge in a Disciple, as
in a Teacher: nor so much of one private Christian as of another: because he
knows our frame Ps. 103.^4
, the very constitution of our bodies which furthereth, or hinders the
understanding of the mind. Some are able to wade through all, or most
controversies; others are not to be admitted to be so much as present at
doubtful disputations Romans 14.1
.

It is enough for such to hold the Head; and that also so far as it has been
taught them, and as they are able to receive teaching: beyond which, no
prejudice lies unless negligence intervene: it so falling out some times that
some Christians may be ignorant of some material points; as they who said, we
have not so much as heard whether there be an Holy Ghost Acts 19.2
; yet without danger. For these were believers, as there appears; and, it was
the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of faith 2 Cor. 4.3
, that enabled them to believe: forasmuch as no man can say (believing what he
says) that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost 1 Cor. 12.3
.

A Christian therefore that holds the foundation, may not come to the
knowledge of some things, which yet are in him. And it fares with him in point
of quickness of apprehension, as with many in the point of evidence and
assurance of Gods love in Christ, to their souls. Assurance cannot be
discerned in a fog, or mist of tentation, spiritual desertion, or grievous
falls. These for the present casts them into a swoon that seems to lay them
for dead; so that they lie sprawling for life upon the ground, having no sense
in themselves that they are alive. So does dullness of capacity disable a man
to apprehend and know the things which the Holy Ghost has undoubtedly wrought
in him: which defect is, in many, very hard (if not impossible) to be cured:
because although qualities be alterable and altered by grace, yet not the
natural constitution: in the room whereof, faith comes and enables to believe
whatever God speaks, though the believer cannot apprehend the reason or depth
of what is spoken; and, makes him when he cannot hold argument or disputes
about the truth, to be able and willing to die for the truth. A great help
hereunto, and to the sufficient knowledge of what a Christian yet apprehends
not, is his sincere obedience to the truth known. For, if any man be a doer of
his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God John 7.17
, and that's enough, till God illighten him further to look into the bowels of
the doctrine it self to know what it is, as well as to know whose it is. Hence
it comes to pass that such Christians, who are later, and more weakly
instructed, are yet sooner, and more persuaded of the truth of the Gospel,
according to that prayer of Noah, God persuade Japhet to dwell in the tents of
Shem Genesis 9.27
. For which prayer we all his posterity to this day fare the better; so that,
it is a wonder to see how such as understand little in worldly things, do
(beyond expectation profit in the knowledge of heavenly; as has been observed
in some that were counted but Naturals, or little better.

Differ.
Contrarily, the unregenerate, if he be dull in earthly things, he is a very
block in heavenly.

Better beat any thing into his head than Religion, because this is spiritual,
and he is not so much as rational in his carnal condition. If no natural man
can understand the things of God 1 Cor. 2.14
; much less he, that has obesum (though not laesum) principium, a gross and
heavy brain or understanding. To him, main articles of faith, as to others, the
great things of the Law, are counted strange things 1 Hos. 8.12
. He is ever learning, never learned 2 Timothy 3.7
. Nay happily, he is quick enough in other things, especially in evil things Jer.
4.24
: only this way, his wit serves him not.

Babes and Sucklings go before him Mat. 11.25
, and understand more of these matters, than he either does, or desires to do.
He loves not to beat his brains about such matters. It is out of his element,
as well as out of his learning. And the more he is advanced in the world, the
less he is verst in the things of God, and the less capable he is of them. If
he be thought fit to be a Judge; yet, if any thing of Religion come before him,
he neither does, nor will understand it, nor thinks it worthy of his cognizance.

If any man be (as Paul was) accused of persuading men to worship God contrary
to the Law, what cares he for God, or his Law either? He has another Law to
walk by, and therefore says in such a case, as Gallio to the Jews, If it were
a matter of wrong, or wicked lewdness, reason would that I should hear you:
But; if it be a question of words, and names, of your Law, look ye to it: for I
will be no Judge of such matters Acts 19.14, 19
. He looks upon all debates and discourses touching Religion to be but some
idle questions of their own superstition who set those questions on foot, and
of one Jesus which was dead, whom some affirm to be alive Act. 25.19
. So that such an one, unto his natural ignorance adds this bolt of
wilfulness and hardness of heart. Nor does he account his dullness in this
kind, the least disparagement: but thanketh God that he never troubled his
head, or his heart about these things.

Thus, the Christian if he be weak in spirituals, he is weak in other things
also; yea, when weak in other things, he is of best understanding in these: the
unregenerate the more natural understanding he has, the less he understands
of the things of God. And his wit serves him better for any other thing. The
one though a fool, shall not err in the highway of God Isa 35.8
. The other is as a madman that understands well enough, in other matters;
but, the things of God are the special subject of his frenzy and dotage.

In a Christian, prudence and discretion may be apparently wanting.

What Elihu the Buzite (descended of Buz the second son of Nahor, Abraham's
brother Genesis 22.20, 21. which shows that Job lived in, or near to Abraham's time.
said of Greatness and Age, Great men are not always wise, neither do the
Aged understand judgment Job. 32.9
: is as true of many good and holy men, that they are not always so prudent
and discreet in their walking, as the honor of Religion and grace would
require. Not that they affect folly; but, because they are not able to reach
wisdom in the managing of their affairs with discretion and judgment Psalm.
112.5
. For, as wisdom it too high for a fool Prove. 24.7
, so is it sometimes too much out of the reach of some whom God has made wise
in the main, to bring them to heaven: although, in regard of circumspect
walking Ephesians. 5.15
, not so prudent as others, through the defect of nature.

Every head is not alike fit for deliberation: which defect makes many a good
man's actions to savor of indiscretion. Great pity (were not God wiser than
man) it should be so: and, that the fools of the world should see any cause to
contemn a man Christianly wise: but, this being from a natural defect; and, in
the principles of natural constitution and temper, cannot (without a miracle)
be prevented, or removed, God is pleased by his own wisdom, to lead his own out
of that Labarinth into which their own indiscretion has brought them; while he
takes the wise in their own craftiness 1 Cor. 3.19
, making their wisdom to appear to be foolishness, altogether inconsistent
with true wisdom, while the follies of his own, will stand well enough with
wisdom, enough to save them.

Discretion is not common to all men; no, nor to all good men. Even these are
subject to too many indiscretions, not only in the sight of God (before whom,
the best do acknowledge their folly and bruitishnesse Psalm. 73.22
but even before men also, who can quickly epsy (for they look after nothing
else) the silliness and simplicity of many Christian babes, whom God has
called to divine wisdom for the saving of their souls; but, not freed from
natural incapacities in the sight of men, which makes them sometimes so weak in
their carriage, as to deserve to be pronounced very babes and children; yea,
carnal, and such as walk as men that have no true knowledge of God, nor
interest in him: as the Corinthians who hotly contended about their teachers,
which was the more excellent; which none but children and carnal men would have
done 1 Cor. 3.1, 2* 3 etc.
.

Howbeit, even here, grace leaves not the Christian without aid to bear him up
in, and to carry him through this weakness of nature; but, brings him first
into the Sanctuary Psalm. 73.17
, that is, sets him continually under the Word, the means of prudence, which
gives the true estimate of men and things. For, if humane histories give, or
be a means to give prudence, by recording what is past; much more does Gods
story, which foretells things to come, and what will be the end not only of
things, but of persons that walk on in their trespasses Psalm. 68.21.
.

Unto which outward means God adds his own Spirit of wisdom to instruct and
teach him in the way that he should go; and to guide him with his eye Psalm.
32.8.
. And so, the inspiration of the Almighty gives understanding Job. 32.8.
, even to him that is a child in understanding, so to train him up in the way
he should go, that when he is old, he will not depart from it. Prove. 22.6.
. To which God yet adds, his own fear wrought by his own spirit, making a
Christian to be of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord Isa. 11.3.
; and, to be wiser than his enemies; as David, to be wiser than Ahitophel, whom
he over-matcht, in prayer 2 Samuel 15.31.
; and thereby God out-reacht him in policy by a poor Archite whom Ahitophel
scorned 2 Samuel 16.23 Cap. 17.23.
.

Yea, such a weakling by nature is taught to see so much of his own weakness,
as to mistrust his own wisdom, and not to lean to his own understanding Prove.
5.3.
: but, to trust in the Lord only to direct his steps Jer. 10.23.
. Therefore, he puts himself under the wardship of the Word and Spirit: and,
stands upon their guard against the wisely wits of the world. So that (as by
the Germane policy against the Italians; and the Netherlanders, against the
Spaniard) Satan has more foiles from the Christian, though he seem to be but
simple and silly; than from all the wordly wise: because, though the Christian
cannot answer his arguments, yet he has the wit to bolt the door against him;
when the worldly wise do set up both doors and gates unto him 1 Pet. 5.9.
.

Differ.
Contrariwise, the unregenerate, how wise soever in other things, is most
sheepish and simple in the matters of salvation.

He is wise to do evil: but, to do good, he has no knowledge, although he, by
external profession, be ranged among Gods people Jer. 4.22.
. He is, in his own conceit, as Tire and Ziden, very wise Zech. 9.2.
: but, in the esteem of God, very brutish and foolish Jer. 10.8.
. So also are his children who glory to walk in the steps of their fathers, as
if none in the world had trodden so good a path as they. Therefore, God not
only pronounces the fathers, fools; but says also, they have sottish
children Jer. 4.22.
, that resolve to be no wiser than their fathers; let God, and all the world do
what they can to demonstrate their fathers to be fools; and, that there is no
fool to the old fool.

Nor is this the condition of the meaner sort only, and such as have been but
rudely bred, who can be no other but foolish, because poor: but, it is the
disease even of the great ones too; who, one would think, should better know
the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their God: but these are worse than
the other (as having more wit, but no more wisdom) and are therefore poor,
because foolish. They are not so ignorant as not to know the yoke, and bond of
God: but yet so desperately wicked, as altogether to break the yoke, and to
burst the bonds Jer. 5.4 5.
, which is much worse than not to know them.

Wherefore he that is naturally simple, is an easy prey to Satan, and to evil
Counsel, yet is not so great a sinner as they that prey upon him; or, as they
that seem to have more wit. For these make themselves simple, and so become
dangerous fools, that though they know not how to honor God, and to do good,
yet they can learn to swear, to lie, to steal, to commit adultery, etc. wherein
they need no Tutors or Instructers, but the Devil and their own hearts.

Thus, the Christian is the wiser and stronger even for his natural simplicity
and weakness 2 Cor. 12.10.
, because grace teaches him to clap all tentations under hatches. The
unregenerate is the weaker, even for his natural wit and strength, because he
thinks thereby to out-wit not only man, but even God himself. In the one,
simplicity is a defense against Satan: in the other, a breach to let him in. If
the one be foolish and simple; the other is frantic and mad.

A Christian may be weak and frail in memory through some defect in nature.

Memory is the Treasurer of the soul: or, that ability or faculty in man which
receiving strong impression of an Object, firmly retains it and lays it up,
that it may bring it forth again upon all occasions, when called for. That
which is most what looked upon as memory, is sensitive, which depends most upon
the animal spirits, and the temperature of the brain, wherein, (that is, in the
hinder part of the head, toward the spinal marrow, as in a place most retired,
and least disturbed) sensitive memory is seated. If the animal spirits be not
quick and active, common sense which apprehends, and the phantasy which
frames an image or impression of the object in the brain, will be dull in
their offices to lay in any thing, which memory should retain. And, if the
temperature of the brain, be not as it ought, the memory cannot hold what is
laid up in it.

Some tempers do dispose the brain to forgetfulness; or at least do indispose
it to remembrance, making it futile, and fickle. If the brain be too moist and
waterish, it is as wax boiling; which soon receives an impression, but retains
it not, because it is too thin and fluid; as we see in children, who quickly
learn a thing, and as soon forget it (unless it have something of wickedness
in it, which sinful corruption helps to retain in the heart:) if the brain be
too hot and dry, it receives no impression, as hard wax before it be melted;
so, the dry brain of age. There must be a proportionable degree of moisture and
heat, to receive an impression, and alike proportion of dryness and heat
tempered with moisture and cold, to enable the brain to retain what is
imprinted in. Hence Plato concludes, that it is hard to find a prompt wit and
a strong memory in the same man: because the one requires a brain more hot and
dry (yet not in extremes, for that causes madness;) the other requires the
brain more cold and moist: yet not too much of either, for that would breed
dullness, and blockish stupidity: which is the natural reason, why some are so
dull of apprehension. This natural defect, wherever it happens, is a great
affliction to diverse of Gods dear children who would fain remember what they
hear, but their sive-like memory will not retain it. Yet God leaves them not
without so much remedy and comfort, as puts them into a better condition in
point of memory, than the strongest memory in the world that is merely natural.

His memory, how weak so ever, is sanctified, as well as his heart. So that, as
Gods grace appears in making him careful and diligent in the use of means,
whereby what he cannot remember at once, by often hearing may be imprinted in
his heart: So his heart being set on heavenly things, hardly forgets them,
though other things pass away. For the edge of affection is apt to carve and
make impression in the memory, of the things wherein a man delights. Thus, as
the old man that loves money, hardly forgets his purse; or the young man,
his mirth and pastime; so the children of God profess the dersie of their soul
to be to his name, and to the remembrance of him Isa. 26.8.
.

Yea, he makes advantage of a weak memory, to forget and pack away follies,
vanities, and injuries, and such like as are not worth the keeping: as he that
has a running water by his door keeps his house the cleaner, by conveying
away of what otherwise would annoy him. By this means he that in cases of this
nature should study the Art of forgetfulness, (as once Themistocles desired to
do when one offered to teach him the Art of memory,) has the odds of others,
in an easy forgetting of those evils which he ought not to remember.

Add hereunto, the assistance of Gods holy Spirit that is graciously afforded
to be his Remembrancer, who not only performs the office of a Teacher to
teach him all things; but, of a Prompter also, to bring all things to his
remembrance whatsoever has been spoken to him by Christ Joh. 14.26.
. So that, if his memory be weak; yet, by these additional and supernatural
supplies it becomes best for the best things. Insomuch as he that cannot
perhaps relate the order and frame of a Sermon, yet he catches somewhat of the
substance of it that may best stand him in stead, and hides it in his heart.
Or, if let it slip at present, yet he never gives over plodding and meditating
upon it, till he recall and recover it. Or, if he be not able to bring it to
remembrance by meditation at present; yet, when occasion is of practicing it to
resist tentation, to support him in trouble, sickness, and to prepare him for
death, it is a wonder to see how memory at such times will serve and help him.
He remembers best at his greatest need: and he remembers to purpose, because he
is ever better for what he remembers. His memory leaves him a better Christian
than it found him.

Differ.
On the contrary, the unregenerate remembereth what is evil, and forgets all
good things, without trouble.

If he forget any news, tales, sums of money, prizes of things, etc. He is
ready to complain of his memory: but in the matters of God, he can see this
defect long enough (if others let him alone) without complaining. If he be
called upon to remember, or to confer about somewhat of the Sermon heard:
then he will excuse himself by crying out of his memory. I have, says he, a
very bad memory, God help me. I would gladly remember somewhat, but indeed I
cannot: yea, he accuses his memory without cause, that all his willing
forgetting of God Psalm. 50.22.
, and of the words of his mouth, and the works of his hands Isa. 5.12.
may be unjustly charged upon his memory which is nothing else but the
wickedness of his own heart that has no delight in God, or his Word.

He is not only unmindful of God Psalm. 10.4.
, but labors to put God out of his mind, and to thrust him from him, saying
to God, depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways Job. 21.14
. Heart says so, though his tongue be silent. He is sorry his memory serves
him no better for worldly businesses; but he is glad of so good an excuse for
not learning the things of God. I can remember nothing, says he; why then
should I go to Church?

But ask this man of any merry, (and perhaps obscene) jest, or discourse; a
play, a tale, any matter of profit that he has heard a long time sithence,
happily but once, this he can remember well enough many years after: and if he
happen to have forgotten any of it, he ruminates upon it, and scratcheth his
head, uses all means to rub up his memory to call it to mind: and will not
give over till he has recovered it, and then he cries (...), I have found it,
I have found it: which shows plainly that his want of memory in heavenly and
spiritual things, is not from defect of nature, but from excess of sin.

Thus, the Christians memory is as a pure glass that will hold wine, but will
burst with poison: but the memory of the unregenerate is like the Asses hoof,
good only to hold poison. The memory of the one will one way or other retain
what the soul needs; the memory of the other, in reference to the things of
God, is like the old vessel filled with new Wine, which breaks the vessel.

A Christian may be naturally faint-hearted and cowardly.

Gideon, Barak, Sampson, Jepthah, Samuel, David, etc. who through faith subdued
Kingdoms, -- stopped the mouths of Lions, -- out of weakness were made
strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens Heb.
11.33, 34.
. Much faith, much courage: little faith, little spirit, (...), men of little
faith ever shake hands with the Pusillanimous. And weak minds have diverse
needless troubles, as too commonly is seen in good and holy persons.

Christ often checked his Disciples for weakness of faith and pusillinamity
Mat. 6.30, 8 26, 16, 8.
, as a thing unworthy of rational men, who by strength of reason might master
diverse doubts and racking thoughts which want of faith brings upon them.
Courage is a goodly grace, wherein God himself delights John 36.5.
: and it becomes none so well as a Believer, who has more reason and better
ground to be valiant than the greatest Spirit in the world that is void of
faith. God stands by courage, and makes such instruments as he sets on work to
act more than men. He casts away none that is mighty in courage, till his
work be done, yet he bears with those that are weak and faint-hearted. Yea,
he gives power to the faint; and to them that have no migh, the increases
strength Isa. 40.29.
.

Indeed, if the heart be false, and so become cowardly upon that account, God
shows not such favor. He does good to such as be good, and to them that are
upright in their hearts Psalm. 125.4.
. He binds, and stitcheth up the riven heart, which otherwise would not hold
the liquor of consolation Psalm. 147.3
. And, as David, so he provideth for his fainting soldiers, that even they
also shall divide the spoil with the mighty. Yea, as Socrates fighting by
Alcibiades, defended his Scholar; so the Lord standing at the right hand of his
weak favorites, suffers none to be too strong for them, but causes all that
oppose them to fall under them. For the Lord himself defends the Inhabitants
of Jerusalem, and he that is feeble among them shall be as David; and, the
house of David, as God Zech. 12 8.
. Hence it comes to pass that the Christian may well say, when I am weak, then
am I strong 2 Cor. 12.10.
: yea, so strong, that the gates of hell are not strong enough to prevail
against him Mat. 16.18.
.

Contrarily, the unregenerate is most cowardly in the best cause. Differ.


So those false-hearted Spies, and faint-hearted Israelites, at the sight, or
news of Giants in Canaan; Of whom they were so much afraid, notwithstanding
Gods promise and presence, that those Spies counted themselves but Grasshoppers
in comparison of the Anakims Number. 13.33
; and all the congregation fell a howling, as if Moses and Aaron, yea, and God
himself had betrayed them. Whereas Joshuah and Caleb looked on those Giants but
as bread for one breakfast Number. 14.9.
for the people of God. So great is the odds between faith and infidelity in
cases of difficulty.

The unregenerate is not so much valiant, as foolhardy in the pursuit of evil:
wherein the fool rages, and is confident, even while the wise man is afraid
and departs from that evil Prove. 14.16.
. He can bend his tongue like a bow for lies: but he is not valiant for the
truth upon the earth Jer. 9.3.
. Here he is a very craven, and coward: and therefore justly does that befall
him; the fear of man brings a snare Prove. 29.25*
. It casts him into such a perplexity, that he knows not which way to turn
him, nor how to extricate himself. The very Heathen Satyrist has well
observed, and whipped this base cowardice in evil men.

Si ratio est, and honesta, timent, pavidoque gelantur Pectore.
Fortem animum praestant rebus quas turpiter audent.
In just and honest things, they fear, and quake.
In lewd attempted prancks, they courage take.
Thus, the Christian is as the wise man in whom fear overcome by discretion,
turns into valor: the hypocrite and wicked is as the horse that laughs at the
Sword and Spear, but starts at a bird: for, he runs desperately on the
pikes of Gods displeasure, but starteth at some great man's beck. The one, of a
coward becomes valiant for God: the other is never so cowardly, as where there
is most cause of courage.

The Christian, notwithstanding grace, is subject to evil inclinations.

He is inclined unto evil, not only because the seeds of original corruption
are in him, not wholly destroyed; but because in some men the soil, being more
apt, makes some of those seeds to grow more rank. Philosophers have observed
some natures are more apt for virtue, as Brutus: others, more averse, as
Cassius; of whom any wickedness may be presumed. As therefore there are some
natural virtues; so, some vices are to some men natural, bred as we say, with
the bone, and for that cause will hardly out of the flesh.

In like manner of some that are regenerate it may be said, that to some vices,
they are more prone than others to the same; or than themselves to other evils:
some are more given to deceit and stealing; some to uncleanness, some to envy
and malice, some to covetousness, etc. So that were it not for grace opposing
those corruptions, they would be dangerous members. And well is it for them
that there is any thing of the Spirit lusting against the flesh Gal. 5.17
, which still endeavors to hold up a Law in the members warring against grace
Rom 7.23
.

But, however the Christian be washed from that filthiness, in regard of the
guilt and stain, by justification; and in respect of the filth and power of it
by sanctification; yet some tincture of that bad nature will remain. He is in
this case as people borne under the Tropicks, which may change their habit,
diet, behavior, but not their color and complexion: (and yet healthful black,
is better than puling white:) He is black by his complexion and temper as
having some special corruption that finds him more work, and gives him more
trouble than any other member of the old man within him: yet, the truth of
grace remaining still in him, does so keep down and master that corruption,
that his spiritual comeliness is not taken away; but, at his worst, makes him
fairer in Gods eyes, than others that are not so much sullied and spotted with
that particular infirmity.

Nature indeed is a great help, where it is rightly tempered. There reason
gives direction, inclination, facility: and diligence brings forth what
perfection nature can afford. But grace is above all, which gives what it
finds not, and uses whatsoever it either finds or gives. It orders even
reason it self, or rather gives new reason where the old is defective. It
transformeth nature so far as to cleanse the heart Psalm. 51.10
, and to make easy and familiar the way of obedience Prove 8.9
. It gives industry and watchfulness to the sluggish Rev. 3.2
; and, unto all these, it adds a blessing.

Differ.
Contrariwise, In the unregenerate, whatever evil was once bred in him, is still
acted by him without redress, or remorse.

The inclinations that are in him to particular evils, are cherished and
abetted: so as he gives them no check, upon the account of God or of grace. And
therefore his thoughts are rather to make provision for the flesh Romans 13.14
, than any against it. And he not only nourishes the inclinations, but
pursues the acts too, so far as may stand with his safety in the world: as we
see in Cain, Esau, Ishmael, Pharaoh, and many more, that being sick of the
dropsy of sin, rather make use of strong water to feed and increase it, than
of physic to abate and cure it.

And whereas the impulse of natural constitution and temper of body, should be
the matter of his sorrow, he makes it the matter of his defense; thinking, if
he have but skill enough to demonstrate that the very temperative of his body
naturally inclines him to such a vice, he has said enough to excuse all the
wickedness that a corrupt heart can possibly put such a natural temper upon.
And albeit some vices may be in him in some part, and at some time corrected or
stopped for a season, yet that very nature will return again for want of the
fork of grace to expel, and keep it off. And so that sea of wickedness which
is in his heart, has always the same mire and dirt within it, although it
does not always cast it up.

Thus, as the miraculous wine which our Savior made of water, was better than
the natural John 2.10
; and as the best apple tree is that which is graffed upon a crab-tree stock;
so where grace corrects nature, it makes it better than some other natures
that wanted not so much correction. For grace corrects the pravity, and
helps the vigor of nature. But the unregenerate is as a vessel that retains
his first liquor as well as savor: and as clothes dyed of a scarlet color,
which are called Dibapha, twice died; once in the wool; and then, in the cloth,
and therefore will hardly take any other color, or return to their first
purity. The one is inclined to evil, overpowered by grace; the other suffers
his natural corruption to make use of his natural defects as of a furious horse
to ride post to damnation.

CHAP. V. The Christian transported with Passions Is he in whom natural
passions or perturbations are ill neighbors to grace. Defin.

NAtural passions and affections were created to be servants and handmaids, not
only unto reason; but, unto conscience, and religion. But man's presumption
against his Maker, has given God just cause to suffer man's passions to perk up
above both these guides and comforts of his life. For Philosophers, the Patrons
of Reason, have discovered as much in the behalf of her; and grace in Gods
children has complained no less, in behalf of her self. Yet, with this
difference; that Philosophy has found out the disease, but not the cause:
Grace has discovered not only the cause, but the remedy also, as well as the
disease.

Passions and affections are usually taken promiscuously, because, as water and
ice, they mutually beget one another. Passion affects the soul: affections put
the soul into passion: and indeed, they are in a manner indivisible; yet
distinguishable. For, as in the mind, there is an intellectual memory,
distinct from that which is properly sensitive: so in the soul rational, there
are certain affections rooted and seated in the Will, which are distinct from
those passions that are in the same soul as sensitive, which passions are not
only seated in sense, but in the body, and do in great part flow from the
temperature of it; as the impetuousnesse of anger, and lascivious lust, from
the overflowing of choler boiling the blood, and firing the spirits; as
sparks of fire struck into the driest tindar.

I shall not here enter a discourse of the differences between the affections
properly arising from the Will, as it is conversant about rational and
spiritual objects, not apprehended by sense; and those passions and affections
which spring from sense: but speak of both in the common acceptance of them,
promiscuously, as they are natural, and incident unto all men, as they are
either painful, or become sinful, and so are impediments unto goodness. For,
albeit they appear in some more, in some less: and some of them are more
apparent in one; and some in another: yet they deserve to be reckoned among
things common, because proceeding of nature, they might have been in all alike,
if the tempers of several bodies had not differed one from another.

And where they are naturally more violent, such, in whom they so prevail, by
course of nature cannot hinder it: where they are more moderate, no thank to
him, as whom nature, not vice or virtue has so tempered. But none are so well
tempered, whether by nature, reason, or grace, but that even the best, while
they are in this flesh and in this world, are (...), subject to like passions
Acts 14.15
with others, although not all alike subject to the same particular passions of
love, joy, anger, hatred, sorrow, fear, etc. by reason of their different
constitutions.

As original corruption over-spreadeth all men as men descending from the first
man by natural propagation, (whence the Prophet says, they like men have
transgressed; Hos. 6.7.
) so these are alike incident to all the sons of Adam, and are evil, but true
notes of our humane nature. From natural affections and passions Christ the
Son of God was not exempted. We read of love Mark 10.21
, anger John 19.26 Mark 3.5
, sorrow Mat. 26.38
, fear Heb. 5.7
, etc. even in him as man, albeit the manhood was assumed into, and personally
united to his Godhead. Only this was his privilege, that as he took our
nature without our corruption; so with our nature, he took our affections and
passions; and (to the end he might be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities Heb. 4.15
) was in all points tempted like as we are; yet without sin.

But in the dearest of Gods children, these passions are ever mingled with
corruption and sin, by means whereof they are not only impediments of
goodness, as troubling and hindering the Christian in duty; but, many times,
the midwives of the heart, to bring forth many great and high provoking sins
against God, causing love to be lustful, anger to be sinful, fear to be
servile, joy to be carnal, sorrow to be worldly, hatred to be devilish, etc.
Yea, so far do sinful passions prevail sometimes (by occasion of some sudden
and extraordinary temptation) in the holiest men, that in some respects they
are hurried on not only to commit the same sins (though not in the same
manner) that wicked men do; but even to outstrip them in some respects.

Even Moses, who was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of
the earth Numb. 12.3
, so far forgot himself in that very particular of Meekness, which he is so
highly by God himself commended for, and was so far transported with the
passion of anger at the murmuring of the children of Israel, that he spoke so
unadvisedly with his lips, Psalm. 106 33
that it cost him his life, notwithstanding all his prayers for the sparing of
it: and he that begged the lives of many thousands, could not obtain his own.
Holy David, a man after Gods own heart Acts 13.22
, was so overtaken with lust, that he could not forbear the wife of him that
was fighting for him in the field 2. Sam. 11.2, 3
, and, having gotten her with child, was so extremely impotent in the point of
shame; that, to cover that, he contrived and prosecuted that premeditated
murder of Vriah verse 15. 1 Kings 15.5
, in hope, by marrying his wife, to prevent all speech of his adultery
foregoing that marriage.

Elijah, was an holy Prophet, and a great Champion for God against Baal, and
all his Prophets 1 King. 18.40
and one who was so faithful and zealous that he is so justly styled the
chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof: yet even he was a man subject to
like passions as we are James 5.17
, (though not so often over-taken, nor so far engaged, as the common sort of
Christians;) as he showed, not only by his rash censure of the times and
people, as if all but he were gone after Baal 1 King 19.14
, when God had seven thousand as far as he from bowing to Baal verse 18.
, but also, through impatiency at his persecuted estate he wished he might die,
even before he had finished his work verse 4.
. To say nothing of the passion of fear in Peter, which was so strong, that he
not only denied, but for-swore; yea, cursed his Lord Mat. 26.74
, after all his protestations to live and die with him, when all others should
forsake him; yea, to lay down his life for him verse 35
.

But yet, in the midst of all this turbulency of passion in some Christians
above other, the Christian still, at the long run, gets the mastery of his
strongest lusts and passions, so as to subdue, though not to expel them
utterly. His heart is for God against them, though his flesh strongly hurry him
on to serve them. By which means, they are still by him opposed; and therefore
not imputed by God, who in the midst of such distempers owneth his servants,
and his own work in them, beyond millions of others who were never so violently
carried on to like acts of wickedness: because, in his own, there is a spirit
still opposing, that keeps passion from reigning.

Differ.
On the contrary, In the hypocrite and unregenerate, these passions dwell, and
rule alone.

Not only natural passions, but sin dwells in the regenerate, not alone,
but with that which proves too hard for this incroaching inmate. But, in the
hypocrite, sin has no rival: none that, in the issue, will get the mastery,
and break the yoke of sin from off its shoulder. If any violent passion like
a whirl-winde, or strong lust like an earthquake has once gotten hold of the
house of his soul; all that this passion, or lust has seized, is in peace:
there is no fear, nor danger of being surprised by a stronger, while grace is
wanting. And so not so much natural passion, as sinful corruption byassing and
inflaming nature swayeth, guides and commands the soul, yea, the whole man
whither it lists.

Natural conscience may sometimes brawl and chide with the passions and
affections when they show themselves too unruly; and reason may for a while
argue the case with them, and be troubled by them. But they cannot trouble
grace, which neither is, nor works in them. In which regard, the passions,
especially such as are most strong and violent, in the unregenerate are always
troublesome to others: but seldom to themselves: because reason corrupted,
deposes her self; and, for the most part resigneth her government unto
passion. But grace, where that comes, does always exercise, or contend for the
mastery over corruption, how often soever foiled and worsted by it.

Thus, passions and affections are in a Christian like a headstrong and
skittish horse, which he cannot be without, and therefore endeavors to
manage to the best advantage of grace: but in the unregenerate they are as
absolute Lords which manage him to the most advantage of sin: to the one,
they are as the fiery chariot that carried Elijah to Heaven: to the other, they
be as the chariot of Jehu, or rather as Jehu, driving furiously, to the
destruction of himself, as well as of others.

The true Christian, finding his passions and affections rising high, makes
them the matter

The many Penitentials of David, entered upon Gods own record, and the bitter
tears of Peter (as authentically recorded as the former) sufficiently
demonstrate the sad effects which sinful affections and passions produce in the
godly. The prayer of Moses the man of God Ps. 90.1
, declares no less. For, however Interpreters generally take the sense and
scope of that prayer to be, the breathings of his spirit in relation to the
miseries and mortalities of that people whom he led through the wilderness;
yet, it cannot reasonably be imagined, that so good, so holy a man should
forget to put himself into the number, in reference to his own particular
sentence to be cut off for his infidelity and sinful passion, as well as many
of them had been already, before either they, or he should enter Canaan.

Even Moses found by sad experience, the cause and effects of unruly passion,
which the higher it flies, the lower it lays and leaves the impotent patient.
No prayers or tears of his, could so far prevail, as to let him live till God
brought Israel into Canaan Deuteronomy. 3.25, 26, 27.
; or, so much as to let him have a sight thereof; unless from the top of a
mountain, at a very great distance Above 240. miles, east from Jebus;
afterward Jerusalem
. The Christian oft-times pays dearer, in this world, for his affections and
passions, than worldlings do. And reason good: for, he has more help against
them, and brings more dishonor to God by them 2 Samuel 12.14
.

Contrariwise, The hypocrite and unregenerate stirs up, Differ.
and nourishes these passions in himself.

It is not in his power properly to make them: for they are by nature, made to
his hand. But, if they be not in him, he could find in his heart to be unmade,
and new made again, that he might not be without them. As the nimblenesse of
bodily motion is from the plenty of choler, so the variety and activity of
sinful motions in a man void of grace, is from the strength of violent and
turbulent passions and affections, egging him on to rebellion against God.
Dullness and lumpishnesse in disposition is to him a great impediment to the
corrupt issues of sinful passions: therefore he had rather be subject to the
most exorbitant passions, than be unactive in that way of sin to which his
particular inclination more especially draws him.

Yea, he can be well content to be all lusts, and no natural affection: and
that unnatural lusts should blot out all natural affection to parents, wife,
children, country, etc. that he may take his fill of sin, which to him is
more deer than his nearest relations. And the more he abounds in such lusts
and passionate affections, the more contentment he takes in them. These he
nourishes with as much care and study as if all his happiness consisted in
them. For these he has baits and lures, fancies, tales, pictures, Laws, that
he not only observes himself, but imposes upon others under pain of his
displeasure and of censure of all generous spirits.

He has rules and Laws for intemperance in eating, drinking, etc. not like to
those of Ahashuerus given to the officers of his house to be observed by all at
his royal feast, wherein albeit they had wine in abundance according to the
state of the King, yet the drinking was according to the Law (not of
drunkenness, but) of sobriety; for, none might compel. But the unregenerate
man's Laws are to the quite contrary: you must not deny to pledge any health,
any way (how gross, or obscene soever) that he begins it: you must do him
right (as he calls it) as you are a friend, a gentleman, etc. although it be to
the health of his whore.

So, he has Laws of anger and revenge, even martial Laws of his own making,
for bloody dwelling and revenge: as, what affronts deserve the stab, the
pistol, the challenge: how the duel is to be fought, what is to be accounted
satisfaction: how far, and when the seconds are to engage, etc. All which, are
the mere inventions and rules of the devil to engage men in wickedness to
their confusion and damnation; expressly contrary to the Laws of God against
shedding of blood Genesis 9.6
, and taking revenge Romans 12.19
; which he makes a tush at, as being contrary to his own; and such, as are
rather a shelter for cowards, than worthy to be observed by any persons of
valor, or honor.

Thus, the Christian finds these violent passions in himself, as parents
epsy faults in their children which they grieve to find, and endeavor to
hide, as people do their uncomely parts: the unregenerate looks upon them as
characters of his worth wherein he glories, as being in sport; the one no
sooner finds these passions in eccentrick motions, but he carefully
resists; or at least, slowly and unwillingly follows such desperate guides;
Hunc trabit invitam nova vic. --
the other is as the furious horseman that whippeth and spurreth the too
forward horse, to the breaking of his own neck; the one covers shame, the
other exalts folly.

The Christian willingly harbors these untoward guests, so far as they are
natural.

By natural, understand, not the opposite to grace, but the desperate vice. As
the affections and passions are planted by nature, not biased and drawn awry
by corruption, he willingly harbors them. As they are perverted by sinful
corruption, so he makes a virtue of necessity and by grace improveth them to an
use, quite contrary to what sin intended, and over-powereth the violence of
corruption, as a wise man takes a sword, or canon out of the possession and
command of the enemy, and turns it against him.

He is no Stoic that under pretense of banishing all passions, as unworthy of
a man, is void of all affections that should make him serviceable to God, or
man. Therefore he accounts himself beholding to God and nature for them.
Originally, materially, and potentially they come from nature, being created by
God, and planted in that soul which he himself inspired into man. For though in
the state of innocence, only joy, and love, and such like pleasant passions
were exercised. Yet where there was joy, there might be sorrow, where there is
love, there may be hatred, etc.

It is true, that actually, and occasionally, sin gave birth to them, as to
their exercise. For, before man sinned, he was naked without shame, and
conversed with God (who is a consuming fire Heb. 12.29
) without fear. By sin also these passions have their course* penally, as
part of the punishment due to sin; as, in Adam, who after his fall, was both
ashamed, and afraid Gen 3.10
; and, for both, hid himself from God. Yea, they are abusively, and too
ordinarily, the instruments of sin: for, as it is said of wrath, in particular,
that it works not the righteousness of God Jam. 1.20
, it is too often verified of all other passions, that they are so far from
working righteousness, that they are the main engines of Satan by which he
hurryeth man upon so much unrighteousness and wickedness against God.

But yet, by grace, they become weapons of righteousness, against sin,
turning their enmity against grace, to an enmity and counterpoison against
sin, as Art makes medicines of poisons, causing the venom of herbs in the
field to purge venomous humors in the body, as the scorpion crushed is made a
plaster for her own wound. And, as the Canaanites, among other reasons, were
left in the land to destroy the wild beasts; or as the Gibeonites were
employed to draw water, and for other necessary services of the Sanctuary; so
these passions and affections are still retained, notwithstanding their
sinfulness, in the choicest servants of God, to quicken and stir up better
qualities in them, and to make them more instrumental in their several places
and relations to glorify God, by doing him more and better service, than could
possibly be performed without them.

Yea, being sanctified, they little differ (in their use) from virtues, when
rightly used; as, holy shame, godly sorrow, religious fear, zealous anger,
etc. If therefore, for some reasons, they deserve to be expelled, because,
through sin, they are of sin, for sin, and at the command of sin: yet for
other reasons they are worthy to be preserved, because they are of nature
created, part of Gods image, or assistants to it, notwithstanding their
uncomelinesse: and, being by grace rectified, they become weapons of the new
creature. Sharp, and dangerous weapons they are indeed. Yet as no wise man
throws away his knife when it has cut his fingers, or for-sweares fire and
gunpowder, because he has been scorched by them; but rather resolves to be
more cautelous in the use of them; so does a Christian not cast away, but more
charily keep, and carefully use these passions that he may neither fall under
the mischief, nor want the benefit of them.

Contrarily, Some hypocrites and other Moralists seemingly, but wickedly wise,
Differ.
finding the passions troublesome, have taught men to cut them off.

So the Stoics of old, and others after them, have hated passions; not because
sinful, but because painful and troublesome, by too much disturbing their own
ease, and laying too open their weaknesses unto others: as if a man should
rather maime himself, than be troubled with a useful member. Indeed he that
wants these affections is maimed and defective not only in nature but in
virtue. For, without affection there is either no virtue at all, or else a very
dull and lumpish virtue. It is as if, to keep men from going out of the way,
one should take off their chariot-wheels, or cut off the legs of their
horses; so taking away the means of motion, to hinder aberration and error in
moving. Thus many a Prince imagining to take away an enemy, cuts off an useful
friend or subject, for want of wisdom to use him.

The hypocrite may talk much of an Heaven upon earth by being freed wholly from
those boisterous winds and storms of violent passions which some men suffer
within themselves; and, that the best way to be rid of them, is, to grub up the
passions by the roots. Nor has he any spiritual power or skill to improve them
as the true Christian does: but he resolves to use (not all but some of) them
which trouble and shame him, as Saul did the Gibeonites, whom Saul slew, out of
his pretended zeal for the children of Israel and Judah 2 Samuel 21.2
; the Gibeonites being not Israelites, but of the Amorites, that by a wile had
over-witted the Israelites, in pretending to be not of the natives of Canaan,
but of a far country, whereby they obtained a league with Israel, and Israel
had sworn unto them, in the days of Joshuah Josh. 9.3.16, 17
. But God was angry with Saul and his house for this; and so will he be with
these men; and that for more faults than this: for they that are so forward to
kill these poor Gibeonites (which a Joshuah, a true Christian, would make good
use of for the service of the Sanctuary, verse 27
) are content to spare those Amalakites of pride, self-love, and vainglory,
which God would have to be utterly destroyed.

To have nothing to do with these passions at all, is the state of just men
made perfect in heaven. It is enough to a Christian here, if by grace he be
able to master them, and to force them to be serviceable unto his Lord. Wild
colts and horses, being tamed, are of great use to the owners: but pains must
be taken with them; not to knock them in head, but to bring them to the bridle,
saddle, pace, and hand, and then they are every man's money. So is it with the
passions. It is not warrant sufficient to destroy them, because they are
naturally wild, furious, and tumultuous: but more pains must be taken with
them to bring them to hand and use, and to make them serviceable against sin
that naturally are so instrumental to promote and increase sin in the hypocrite
and unregenerate.

They cannot be worse in their kind, than the earth, to Adam and his
posterity, after his fall. The ground was cursed for his sake, and in sorrow
was he to eat of it all the days of his life. Why so? because it grew so full
of thorns and thistles, which it brought forth unto him, that he was feign to
eat his bread in the sweat of his brows Genesis 3.17, 18 19
, by laboring to make the earth useful and fruitful, that was so apt to yield
thorns and weeds. Adam did not hereupon neglect or forsake the ground as
unworthy his care and labor; but, took the more pains with it, that it might
bring forth herbs meet for them, by (and for) whom it is dressed, and thereby
receive a blessing from God Heb. 6.7
.

Thus the true Christian is for the preserving and improving the passions, as
Jonathan was for the preserving of David, when Saul sought to destroy him;
saying, wherefore shall they be slain? what have they done Sam. 20.32
? The stoical hypocrite is like Saul, persuading himself that as David, so,
these must die; and to let them live is to preserve them to his own confusion:
the one continues them to make them serviceable against sin, the other seeks
to destroy them, because (through his own default) they are oft-times occasions
of his shame and vexation: the one mortifies them, that they may become useful;
the other ^ills them outright, and so renders himself useless.

Passions, to the Christian, are as malapert, yet useful servants.

Servants they are by condition, being now made so by grace; but, malapert of
disposition, as the sons of Zerviah were to David; and, many times, too hard
for him 2 Samuel 3.39
. In his wars he could not want them while he lived; but dying, he took order
to rid the world of them. So these passions, while we are in this life militant
against sin, are necessary, though saucy servants: but our Solomon shall one
day make an end of them when we have no further use of them.

In this life it were a fearful case for a child of God to be past sorrow or
shame for sin; or unmovable to anger in Gods cause. Who can repent, without
sorrow? who can be ashamed of the evil he has done, without shame? How can a
Christian hate them that hate the Lord, or be grieved with those that rise up
against God Ps. 139.21
, if it were not for an holy anger, and zeal that even eats him up Psalm. 69.6
John 2.^7
? He knows that his Lord was angry, and grieved at the hardness of men's
hearts Mark 3.5
: and that a Christian is commanded to be angry, for God, so he sin not in his
anger Ephesians. 4.26
: and therefore will not destroy, but improve that troublesome passion.

It is so far from unseemlinesse in a Christian, that it is his property
quickly to mourn and weep for his own sins Mat. 26 75
, and for the sins of others Ps. 119.156
, even with bitter passion and deepest grief. He is apt to dislike, and blush
for shame, at the very naming of sin, and connot endure the company of such as
make sport in the mention of obscenity and wickedness: which he could never
do, were it not for making use and improvement of those passions which where
they bear rule, are the worst, and most deformed. He makes use of the passions,
as wise men do of horses, or chariot-wheels, which are good to carry, but
naught to guide. He uses them in his journey, and at his need: but afterward,
shakes them off, as glad he shall no longer need them.

Differ.
On the contrary. To the unregenerate, Passions are imperious masters, and
tyrants.

He cannot command them, but they command him. They are not his servants, but
he theirs. He that rules his spirit, is better than he that takes a City
Prove. 16.32
. But, he that has no rule over his spirit, is like a city that is broken
down, and without walls Prove. 25.28
. Where, by Spirit is meant that (...), that appetite and desire of either
pleasure, or revenge that is natural to all (although in some, more predominant
and out-ragious. For, unto these two, all passions and affections are referred.

Now there cannot be a worse kind, or greater degree of slavery, than for man
to be subject to this base, and as it were bruit part, wherein (when this
spirit bears sway) he differs little, or not at all from the beast that
perishes. Howbeit, from this vassalage the natural man cannot free, or acquit
himself. What more plausible conquest of a city, than to dismantle it, and to
lay it open to every invasion? In innocence man was walled, and his affections
were under rampires and garrisons. But, by sin, as by a Nebuchadnezzar 2 Chr.
36.19
, these walls and fortifications were broken down; and so they lie, till grace,
as Nehemiah Nehem. 2.17
, come to rebuild them: which, sin in man, yea, even in these affections of
man, as Sanballet Nehem. 4.1
, is very angry at, and seeks to oppose with all its might.

Thus the Christian is troubled with passion, because disturbed in his
government of them; the unregenerate is troubled with them as governed by them:
the one makes use of them in his war with sin, as a wise Prince does of
stirring spirits in a state, that otherwise would be dangerous: the other
finds his passions to take state upon them, and to employ him, not he them:
and, to make peace with sins abroad, that they may more securely war and
wast, sack and spoil at home.

Sometimes the Christian suffers his affections too much to sway his will and
reasonable

There is no man so temperate, but he is at times transported, as Moses Ps.
106.32.33
. No man so wise but he is in some cases blinded, as Solomon 1 King. 4.1.2, etc.
. No man so watchful, but he is upon occasion surprised, as David 2 Samuel 11.2, 3
. No man so just, but at times, through prejudice or partial affection, he may
do unjust acts, as the same David, in the case of Mephibosheth, upon the false
information of Ziba 2 Samuel 16.3, 4
. David is said to be wise as an Angel of God to discern between good and evil
2 Samuel 14.17
, yet he foully failed in the case last mentioned, albeit he well knew that he
that rules over men must be just 2 Samuel 23.3
. His sons rebellion had so exasperated him that he lay open to the sycophancy
of a traitor, to wrong the simplicity of a loyal subject.

In heat of blood and high provocation, patience is wanting or overborn, even
in the best. Elijah threatened by Jezabel, makes a breach not only in his own
patience, but also against providence. He will needs die in all the have, that
she may not take off his head 1 King. 19.4
. Jonah, sick of the same disease, fell out with God himself, (after he had so
miraculously saved him in, and delivered him out of the whales belly) about a
gourd; yea, and thinks he has just cause so to do; I do well, says he, to be
angry even unto death Jonah 4.9
. He was scorched with the Sun, deprived of the shade of the gourd, his
denunciations took not effect, and the City of infidels was spared, which he
had prophesied should be destroyed. Every one in passion, especially of anger,
thinks he does well and right, because he suffers his passions to bear down
his reason to serve his humor, till he has again recovered himself.

Contrarily. Differ.
The unregenerate willingly subdueth his reason under his passion.

Not for a fit, or by occasion for a time, when himself is on the sudden, or
for want of due watchfulness, surprised: but he makes choice of such a
translation of passion into the room of reason; and sees, as he thinks, a
necessity to have it so. Herein is that of the wise man verified, I have seen
servants upon horses, and Princes walking as servants upon the earth Eccles.
10.7
. A notorious indignity to see Passion Lord it in a Coach, and Reason, as a
Lacquy footing it by his side. But now, new Lords, new Laws. Passion reigning
forces Reason to devise Laws against her self. For without Reason they cannot
be made, though they be made against Reason.

Even in cold blood, he determines to follow the commands of passion, and
silenceth reason, if it contradict this determination. He is herein as Caesar
that went soberly about the overthrow of the State, not for want of reason,
but as resolved not to hearken to it. So Cato killed himself with great
advisement and show of discretion. Thus men use all the Reason they have after
an evil committed, to make good what passion has done, that before trod it
under foot of passion, when Reason offered to hinder the doing of it.

It is a part of the triumph of Passion, to force Reason supparisitari,
Parasite-like, to maintain all acts of passion in the unregenerate. From hence
proceed all strained and profane Apologies for evil. Hence it is, that men add
thirst to drunkenness Deuteronomy. 29.19
: fuel to lust, because they think they can command Reason to make some excuse
for it: herein being worse than beasts; for they lust, but do not provoke to
lust, by cogitation, by diet, or such like courses. But this man is ready to
answer, Bestiae enim sunt. They provoke not, because they are beasts, and
understand no better. But he has more wit, and he employeth it to be more
wicked, and more brutish. He may say with the Idfornicator, Impetravi egomet,
ut me corrumperem. I have obtained leave of my reason and conscience, to defile
my self still. He likes because he loves; and sees faults, because he
hates. What he lusts after, Reason must not only not presume to oppose, but
not refuse to maintain.

Thus, the regenerate have too much mixture of passion; the unregenerate, an
habituated predominancy. The one gives way to passion, as fond Parents to their
children, who through over-doting affection love more and think better of their
children than they deserve, and so give them the reins more than is meet: the
other, as blind lovers, through rage of fancy, love where they should hate,
and like where they should loath. In the regenerate, fancy as a Phaeton gets
the chariot for a while: in the other, the cart always guides the horse, and
the horse the carter. Hence, the one, as David, blesses the means by which he
is stayed and reclaimed from giving further vent to his passion 1 Samuel 25.32 33
. The other, as Balaam, that would have killed his Ass for not carrying him
further Number. 22.29
, thinks he has no greater enemy than him that will stop his course in
sinning, or show him his error.

In a regenerate man may be forward, free, active, and quick affections.

The wind blows where it lists John 3.8
, and the Spirit works where he pleases. His wisdom knows of what
extraordinary u^e even the most quick and nimble passions, rightly guided, and
employed, may be: therefore he often takes delight in renewing and sanctifying
such whose affections and passions unsanctified would prove very dangerous;
but, being sanctified, become prime instruments in the hand of the Lord, to do
him excellent service and honor.

Who, fuller of affections than David? yet, through grace, he so employed them,
that God gives him this peculiar honor, to be a man after his own heart 1 Samuel
13.14
. Jeremy was a man of swift passions; especially of anger J^r. 8.9
, at the desperate wickedness, and of sorrow Jer. 9.1
, for the matchless miseries of the Kingdom of ^udah, that he first
prophesied, and after saw in part fulfilled upon them, yet God having
sanctified him in the womb, and ordained him a Prophet unto the Nations Jer. 1.5
, how great an instrument did God make him, over the Nations, and over the
Kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down; to
build, and to plant, etc Ver. 10
? Witness his Prophecies against Egypt Jer 46.2
, against Moab Jer, 48.1
, the Ammonites, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Hazor, Elam Jer. 49
, and ^ast of all* against Babylon it self Jer. 50, etc.
, the scourge, and destroyer of all the for me^, (so far as they were
destroyed,) and the events answering those denunciations.

But, as quicksilver must first be subdued in the poisonous quality of it,
before it can be used to any benefit; so these affections must be mortified, or
they will soon grow pernicious to him in whom they be found. No man, a more
zealous and industrious publisher, and Propugner of the Gospel, after his
Conversion, than blessed Paul 1 Cor. 15.10
: yet, before, no man such a Persecutor Act. 26.10, 11
.

Notwithstanding, affections, where they are naturally quick, they are seldom,
or never so absolutely mortified in this life, but that sometimes they break
out beyond due bounds. For, as a smooth, soft, and keen edge is soonest turned,
blunted, or gapped, or otherwise cuts and wounds him that uses it, if he be
not more than ordinarily careful in the use of it; so it not seldom happens,
that the quickest and most active affections, are soonest turned aside, dulled,
or corrupted to break out into disorderly and exorbitant actions. Hence it
comes to pass that the most forward natures, as they give great helps and
luster unto grace, while they be contained within order; so, at times breaking
out, they give greater foiles, and become greater blemishes, than the passions
of others of a more moderate temper, and less grace.

David, whose courage, (steeled with faith, and experienced by the killing of a
Bear, and a Lion) put him on to encounter Goliath, the terror of all Israel;
yet showed impotency enough in his sudden resolution to destroy Nabal, and his
house, upon a private affront, and disgust 1 Samuel 25.23
; had not the wisdom of a woman prevented his shedding of blood, and the
avenging his own private quarrel, with his own hand Verse. 33
. Those sons of Zebedee, James and John, as they were of a forward nature,
and fervent, which being sanctified, made them sons of thunder Mar. 3.17
; so, they were soon transported, as we see in their rash zeal against the
Samaritanes, for not receiving our Lord Luke 9.53, 54
, and in their ambitious desire of priority of the other ten Apostles Mat.
20.21 and v. 24
.

So Peter, as he was ever the most forward in attempting dangers, so he most
often and most dangerously stumbled, and hardly escaped, as we see in his weak
walking upon the sea Mat. 14.30
, his Satanical boldness in rebuking his Lord Mat. 16.22, 23
, and his desperate denial of him in the Highpriests Hall, even after he had
cut off an ear of the High Priests servant in the quarrel of his Master Mat.
26.35
, and promised to stand by him to the death Ver. 51
. Howbeit, such distempers and exorbitances of the regenerate, are duly
repented of, and thereupon graciously pardoned.

Contrariwise. An unregenerate man of quick and vehement affections and
passions, Differ.
is extremely wicked.

As his passions, so his actions are all in extremes. He is not only (...), one
that will do mischief, but (...), presently, suddenly in action. He cannot hold
off till he has seriously considered what he is about to do: and so he is full
of all mischief, even in an instant, as the Apostle describes Elimas Acts 13.10
. As Augustus was wont to say, that he should leave behind him an Emperor
(meaning Tiberius) that would not think twice of one thing: so it is with this
man; no sooner does Satan, ill counsel, or his own corruption put any evil in
his head, but his fingers itch to be at it. He rusheth upon it as the horse
rusheth into the battle Jer. 8.6
. If he but see a thief Psalm. 50.18
, he presently is so taken with him, that he not only consents to him, but
runs with him, and as some translate the word (...) * from (...) See
Ainsworth.
, which notes the readiness and earnestness of the affections unto theft.
His affections are as Gunpowder, fired, so soon as touched.

Mischief and wickedness in the height is his delight, and glory. He cannot
eat without this sauce, nor sleep without this pillow. He sleeps not, except
he has done (not only some small inconsiderable fault, but) mischief: and his
sleep is taken away unless he has caused some to fall. He eats the bread of
wickedness, and drinks the wine of violence Prove. 4.16, 17
. He is in extremes, not only for his hasty acting, but for the nature of the
sins which he acts. If it be possible to go beyond the worst, he will put on
with all his might to outstrip them. In an instant, ere he can be discerned,
he over-passeth the deeds of the wicked Jer 5.28
. Nor is this his grief, but his sport Prove. 10.23
. He boasts himself in mischief, his tongue devises mischiefs (in the
plural, if possible,) like a sharp razor working deceitfully, leaving nothing
behind it, but in pretending to cut the hair for haste, he cutteth the throat
also. He loves evil more than good Psalm. 52.1, 2, 3
, thinking nothing so good as to do evil with both hands Mic. 7.3
; as Doeg, that was not only forward to inform against Ahimelech, but, when
Saul's guard refused, he readily fell upon the Priests; and, not only cut off
eighty five persons that wore Ephods, but utterly destroyed all men, women, and
children, that belonged to them 1 Samuel 22.18, 19
. His feet were swift to shed blood Romans 3.14
.

Thus, in the regenerate, passion is sometimes as a swift dromedary traversing
her ways, sometimes too swift for the Rider Jer. 2.2, 23
: but, being mastered, shows mettle to very good purpose: but, in the
unregenerate, passion is as Asahel, as light of foot, as a wild Roe of the
field 2 Samuel 2.18
: and so swift, that it will not be stayed till it has carried him on to his
destruction, notwithstanding all admonitions to prevent it Ver. 21, 22, 23
. The one, by tentation may give way to his passions, too forward to evil; but,
having them under the command of grace, he usually turns them the right way,
to be zealous and earnest in that which is good, however they be too hard for
him at times to hurry him on upon the evil he hates. The other, is not only
forward but desperate in evil, and in evil only, having no command at all over
his passions, but rather delights to give himself up to them; and is then
best pleased, when they be most swift in the pursuit of the grossest
abominations.

In a true Christian there may be strong, sturdy, and untractable passions.

Such as the sons of Zerviah to David, whom he cannot rule 2 Samuel 3.39
. All passions corrupted are the stronger by corruption, while the man in whom
they are waxes weaker and weaker, as a man under a disease too hard for
nature. Such passions are hardly mastered with the bit and bridle of grace, no
more than the horse and mule which have no understanding Psalm. 32.9
. For usually, where passion is strong, reason is weak; and there, grace has
the harder task. Passion and Reason are the scales of the mind, as the one
goes down, the other goes up. Jonah must confess this to be so: for, neither
the whales belly nor the sea it self could drown his passion of anger, even
when he could expect nothing but the drowning of himself. He was a Prophet, and
therefore an holy man 2 Pet. 1.21
: yet his anger was too hard for his holiness, even after he had been in the
whales belly Jon. 4.9
.

This violence of the passions arises much from bodily temper or distemper
rather, and namely from melancholy, which is a tough and viscous humor, to
hold the impressions of passion. It is much also from education and liberty
given to the follies of childhood and youth, without crushing in the egg, and
nipping corruption in the bud. When children are used to have their will
without curbing, correction, or reproof in their first ordering, such, in short
time, grow so headstrong, that afterward they will hardly be governed by any
Law; correction then comes too late, unless to irritate corruption, and to
make them more desperately and incorrigibly wicked.

Unto such much grace is needful, and many prayers, and strivings more than
ordinary. In fine, there needs an Alexander, for such a Bucephalus, or strong
headed horse. Yet are not such passions to be wholly cast away, or knocked in
the head: forasmuch as they (being once mastered and renewed) may prove not
only good, but excellent. Even the Lion, the Bear, and the Wolf (that is, men
naturally as fierce, fell, rapacious, and violent, as those bruits) are
admitted into the Kingdom of Christ, and so tamed by the power of his grace,
that they lie down with the Lamb, the Kid, and the Calse Isa. 11.6, etc.
. For he has received gifts for the rebellious also, that the Lord God may
dwell among them Psalm. 68.18
.

The Jews were naturally a fierce, furious stiff-necked Nation Deuteronomy. 9.6, 7
, yet such of them as were renewed by grace, proved the Worthies of the Church
in both Ages. Such in a good cause, will stand as Eleazar, or as Shammah, in
the field of Lentiles, against the Philistines, although forsaken and all, and
fight till their hand cleave to their sword 2 Samuel 23.9, 10, 11
. Indeed such affections are as the loud-crying woman and the Scold sought out
to drive away the enemies Eccl. 26.27
. But he that has them to contend with them at home, shall be sure to be
acquainted with the troubles of war. Yet by the power of grace, he
maintains against them a difficult and perpetual conflict, till at last he
sing 10, triumphing over them, through Jesus Christ 1 Cor. 15.17
.

On the contrary, Differ.
an unregenerate man so tempered and hampered with headstrong and sturdy
passions, is dangerous to himself and others.

He has no command over himself, because himself is under command of his
passions. He is as a City broken down, and without walls Prove. 25.28
, which can resist no assault, but is at the enemies pleasure, to sack and
burn it, and to put all to the sword that are in it. He is ruled by his lusts
and passions, and will be ruled by naught else; neither man, nor God himself
shall rule him, further than his own affections please. The tentations of
Satan, the frauds and illusions of wicked men shall be of more force with him,
than any counsel from God. But his great and mighty lords, are his passions
within, whom he worshippeth and serves, as the covetous man, his wedge and
wealth Josh. 7.21 Prove. 18.11
. He cannot stand out against any sinful passion of his own heart, he cannot
curb the rage of that unruly member the tongue Jam. 3.8
, he is a slave to every noisome lust, and hellish vice that his corrupt
affections hurry him upon, whether it be quarrelling, railing, covetousness,
uncleanness, fraud, lying, theft, or whatever any vile affection within him
has a lust unto. It carries him on headlong with fury into all mischief and
misery, as wild and fierce horses not weighed, nor under command, run away
with a Coach to the hazard of the lives of all that are in it.

Such an one is unapt for counsel, and impatient of reproof. Yea, the more he
is reproved, the more he hardens his neck, until he be on the sudden
destroyed, and that without remedy Prove. 29.1
. In this disposition he delights more than in his estate, honor, friends:
his will, his lusts, are his Law, his God. Under color of constancy and
stayednesse to which he pretends, he makes his heart as hard as an
Adamant-stone Zech. 7.11, 12
, in wickedness, rendering it both desperately evil, and pertinacious in it. He
is so far from hearing others laboring to reclaim him, that he will not
hear the voice of his own reason and conscience. There is in him a perpetual
storm, as in a ship in a tempest, wherein for the noise of winds and waves,
the commands of the Ship-Master cannot be heard for the saving of the ship. His
passions are so often and much in uproars, and tumults, that when wisdom and
conscience speak loudest, they are no more regarded, than Alexander when he
beckned with his hand, and would have made his defense, to the enraged
Ephesians Acts 19.33, 34
. And if he do hear, he is resolved notwithstanding to do what he list,
although God himself speak to him to the contrary; as they, to Jeremy, As for
the Word that thou have spoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not
hearken unto thee. But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goes out of our
own mouth, etc Jer. 44.16, 17
.

Thus, passion in the regenerate is as an horse stiff of reins; but, under a
good rider most serviceable: in the unregenerate, as a wild Ass used to the
wilderness, snuffing up the wind at her pleasure Jer. 2.24
, and running away with her rider. The one seeing his danger, does what he can
to prevent it, the other humoureth that most which is most dangerous to him.

In the regenerate there may be soft, weak, and pliable affections.

Some natures are so facile, that a child may lead them; so capable of every
impression, that you may draw them to any thing; not so much out of a corrupt
inclination, as of a natural temper, and ductile disposition. They understand
well enough, and they mean well, but are so pliable to every motion that they
be overtaken and overcome of evil, ere they be aware, not as delighting in it,
but as not suspecting it, or thinking evil of him that enticeth and beguileth;
as those Israelites whose hearts were stolen away by Absalom, whom they
followed in the simplicity of their hearts, knowing nothing of his treason 2 Samuel 15.11
.

Such are soon won, and soon wounded, ere they be aware: apt for all
impressions, especially of sorrow, fear; and sometimes of jealousy also,
ready to call Gods love into question, and think themselves forsaken; They are,
as wayward children, sick folks, and women for the most part, too apt to be
displeased and distempered. Even a David is apt sometimes to say to God, in his
haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes; that is, cast out of thy sight
Psalm. 21.22
. And, at another time, all men are liers Psalm 116.^^
, even Prophets and all, that had prophesied that to him, which he could not
see performed. But he confesses his rashness, as taking the blame upon
himself, for his hasty, blaming of others.

But such an one, as he is soon hurt, so is he as soon healed: as he is quickly
offended, so he is as quickly pacified; as he is suddenly cast down, so is as
suddenly raised again and comforted. If he easily tread awry, he is soon
snibbed, and turned again into the right way. If he be not so careful and
cautious to keep in with the Lord, yet is he soon brought to see his wanderings,
and to mourn and lament after the Lord 1 Samuel 7.2
. He is as a soft-natured child, that easily offends his father, but is
never quiet till he be reconciled. Such an one because he wants resolution,
Prove. 28 14
has fear for his Guardian and Watchman (r): and, wanting strength to
withstand evil motions, his wisdom is to keep himself, as much as may be, out
of the noise and view of tentations Job 31.1
.

Differ.
Contrarily, the unregenerate of facile affections, is apt and ready for all
sinful purposes.

(...), an yielding man (says the Philosopher) is carried by every word and
wind. He enters not into consideration what is fit and warrantable; but, if
pressed by others, to do so and so, he presently yields, be it good or evil.
Such an one is for any faith or religion: yea, for any practice that others
will persuade him to; especially, if plausible, or such as carries not
abhorrency in the very face of it; and, that the snake lie not open to all men's
view in the highway, but hidden under the grass in a pleasing meadow. Any
specious pretense is sufficient to carry him whithersoever you please. Do but
say the word, he scorns to dispute, but readily obeys.

If he happen to fall into company and discourse with any insinuating Popish
Priest or Jesuit, whose policy and rule is to deal chiefly with the weaker
sex, and with effeminate, or obnoxious men, that will be more apt to hearken to
a Mountebank, promising an easy cure, (without destruction of the lusts
within,) than to a solid and faithful Physician that is more for taking away
the cause, than for giving present ease; the doors shall be open to any
Impostors whatsoever, that creep into houses, and lead captive silly women (and
weak men too) laden with diverse lusts, ever learning, and never able to come to
the knowledge of the truth 2 Timothy 3.6, 7
. The hook is no sooner let down, but he, not considering the danger, first
nibbles, by entertaining discourse (as Eve did with the Serpent) which he is
not able to maintain: and then, swallows the bait, and with it the hook, which
he cannot escape.

Such an one counts it his wisdom and glory, not to cross company, but to be
as they are. Any fashion, behavior, action, (except what is truly good)
faction, course, or conspiracy will suit with his disposition. Do but say, what
you will have him do, and he is your servant. The least beckning or holding up
the singer of him whom he thinks worthy of respect upon any account, is to him
enough. If a man of honor and power, such an one as Absalom, do but take him
by the hand 2 Samuel 15.5
, he presently takes him by the heart too, and steals it away, even to commit
treason and rebellion against his Sovereign, as Absalom did the hearts of the
men of Israel Ver. 6
: and as Garnet, Owen, etc. did the hearts of the Gunpowder Traitors.

He will quickly like, and as quickly loath, and both without cause, as Amnon
did his Sister Tamar 2 Samuel 13.14, 15.
. He liked her without cause, to make her his whore: and loathed her without
reason, so soon as he had forced her. In the things of God, he will not trouble
himself to stand in the ways (where God, in the Ministry of his Word uses to
set guides) to see, and ask for the old paths (the Law and the Testimonies)
where is the good way, that he may walk therein Jer. 6.16
: but he only asks what religion his fathers and Ancestors were of; and what
any flattering Priest will persuade him to, especially if outwardly pompous and
gaudy, he presently resolves (let Jeremy say what he will to the contrary) we
will certainly do what we and our fathers, our Kings and our Princes have done
Jer. 44.17
. But let Kings and Princes alter Religion, he is then for Cantemus canticum
novum: Let us sing a new Song, as hastily as any Perne of them all. Till then,
he will trust himself with any Popish Priests, loose companions, and corrupters
of youth, till he be engaged in the grossest evils that they think fit to draw
him into for advance of the Catholic cause, as they smoothly, but falsely
suggest.

Thus the regenerate by facile affections is sometimes overswayed, as the man
of God by the old Prophet of Bethel, pretending an unknown Word of the Lord, to
require the man of God to do contrary to what he had an express charge to
forbear 1 Kings 13.18 19.
; yet, in this he fares better in the issue, as it did with Barnabas, who,
being of a good nature, was, for a while, carried away with other men's
dissimulation; but, at length, recovered himself Gal. 2.13
. The unregenerate is as one of the simple ones, as the young man void of
understanding falling into the company of an harlot, and charmed by her
enticements, whereby he goes after her straightway, as an ox goes to the
slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks, till a dart strike
through his liver, as a bird that hasteneth to the snare, and knows not that
it is for his life Pro. 7.22, 23
. The one finding himself to be of a weak and yielding nature, marries his
Virgin unto Christ, that so when he is weak, he may become strong 2 Cor. 12.10
in the Lord, by putting himself under Covert-^aron of Christ: the other is as
Dinah, out of her fathers house, a prey for Shechem Genesis 34.1, 2
, or any loose Tempter.

In a Christian regenerated there are sometimes dull, heavy, and lumpish
affections.

Sometimes nature, sometimes sickness, otherwhile tentation, or spiritual
desertion makes him slow and unwieldy in the ways of God, in rejoicing in God,
and in honoring his holy Profession as he desires. Some are of a dull heavy
nature, even from their youth, not out of affected sloth, but by natural
phlegmatic constitution, such an one was Jacob, an honest, plain, quiet man,
not over-active abroad, but as a Shepherd dwelling in Tents, far unlike his
brother Esau, who was of a more vafrous subtle stirring nature, loving hunting
and more nimble exercises Genesis 25.27
. Some are so by age, in whom nature is spent and worn out, as old Barzillai,
so feeble as not to discern between good and evil to sense, to taste meat or
drink, with any quickness of tasting; or to judge of music with a
distinguishing ear 2 Samuel 19.35
. Some are so by sickness, in whom a disease confirmed, and deeply rooted,
does even alter the very temper and constitution of the body, as well as waste
and consume the spirits, making them so unwieldy and heavy in spiritual
motions, as the impotent man that had a long time layen at the pool of
Bethesda, for cure, and could never be so nimble as to get soon enough into the
water after the moving of it by the Angel, but that another stepped in before him
John 5.6, 7
. Some are so dejected by tentation, and the withdrawing the light of Gods
countenance, that they are as it were planet-smitten to the ground, and not
able to stir with any vivacity, as David who sometimes (especially after his
great fall, when God, notwithstanding his repentance and pardon, chastised him
for the scandal he had given whereby the enemies of God took occasion to
blaspheme the very ways of Godliness and Profession of Religion 2 Samuel 12.9,
10, etc. and v. 14.
; had much ado to hold up his soul in clean life, but that it would be cast
down, and disquieted within him, that he could hardly keep alive any hope in
God, within it Psalm. 42.5
.

In all which cases a Christian must needs be in a sad temper of spirit, for
his slow and heavy moving for, or toward God, in which he finds himself
out-stripped by all that have any truth of grace in them. When he sees others
as ready to follow God, and to express their forwardness, as David's servants
when he was forced to flee from Absalom (behold, thy servants are ready to do
whatsoever my Lord the King shall appoint 2 Samuel 15.15
) he himself is as lame Mephibosheth that cannot go with him 2 Samuel 19.26
: and is perhaps by some false-hearted Ziba (that should assist him) traduced
and slandered, as if he had some treacherous design against his Sovereign Ver.
27
.

Some are naturally more stoical and dispassionate than others. They are of an
even disposition, and so, take then when you will, whatever comes from them is
much what like the sound of a Bell, that always yields the same note. But
yet they come behind others in both duty; and comfort, the very sense whereof
cannot but much affect and afflict a true child of God, as it did holy David:
who was often troubled with his lumpish dullness Psalm. 43.5
.

Nevertheless, even herein he is not cast off as an unfaithful servant, nor
left without encouragement: but, the more he labors under this dull temper,
the more he stirs up himself to take hold on God, to quicken him in his way
Psalm. 119.37
. And so he finds that the spirit is willing, even when the flesh is weak,
heavy, and sleepy Mat. 26.41
. So that though he want the comforts that others more active do sometimcs
find, yet withal he is freed from sundry discomforts that they meet withal:
for, it much freeth him from excesses to which others are subject, and he comes
as soon and fast as he can to the Lord, although limping, as lame Mephibosheth
to David with as true an heart as those that are more forward.

Differ.
Contrariwise, an unregenerate man of this dull temper is dead unto all
goodness.

He is dull, and insensible of it. He is in a sad condition, and it is
impossible to make him to take his case to heart. He is as one that sleeps on
the top of a mast, and fears no danger: yea, he pleases himself in his
affected and corrupt sluggishnesse, and flattereth himself as being in the only
good temper. For, his slothfulness casts into a deep sleep Prove. 19.15
, he is lumpish and like a dead man, unless perhaps when he is about some evil
that pleases his palate more than ordinary. But in any honest and good
business, the way of this evil beast and slow-belly Tit. 1.12
, is as an hedge of thorns Prove. 15.19
; it appears to him to be full of difficulties and dangers, as a path that is
overgrown with briers and thorns.

He looks upon others of a quicker metal and sees them often to miscarry, and
stumble by their haste, for which he despises them. Hereupon he condemns
fervencie and forwardness in good duties, as excesses, and extremes not to be
imitated, and applaudeth his own sloth, as the only true even disposition
worthy of a wise man. If the Minister lifting up his voice as a Trumpet, do cry
fire, fire against sin. He asks not where? or what is the matter? but, what
ailes the man? is he mad? away with him to the prison Jer. 29.26
. In the mean time, for evil, he is as the still Sow, in the proverb, sly and
still, not forbearing the evil, but only careful to make no noise.

Thus, the regenerate is as Jacob, after wrestling with God, making what speed
he can Genesis 32.31
, although he be constrained to halt in going, not as unfaithful, but as unable
to make haste: the other is as the slothful in work, brother to him that is a
great waster Prove. 18.9
, and shall as certainly come to woe and misery, as if with the professed
Prodigal he resolved to consume all. The one although he be slow, yet is not
negligent; the other sits still and says, All in good time. No more haste than
good-speed. I shall get to heaven as soon as any hot-spurre of them all.

A regenerate man may be of a various and inconstant temper, in respect of
affections.

As to the main resolution of cleaving close to God without separation, he is
constant to the death Rev. 2.10
, and is kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation 1 Pet. 1.5
. But as to the temper of his particular affections and passions, he is
oft-times very variable and unconstant. Sometimes he is hot in love, by and by
he leaves his first-love Rev. 2.4
. Sometimes very zealous, sometimes remiss Ver. 20
. Sometime glad, and sometimes sad Psalm. 42.11
. One while quick, another while more dull Heb. 5.11
; Now confident, and shortly distrustful: At one time, valiant; and anon,
cowardly Mat. 14.30
. And this comes to pass not through intercisions of grace, Numb. 20 11
but from the constitution of nature, not thoroughly vanquished by grace.

But, as it was said of Alexander, that he excelled both in virtues and vices,
so such though sometimes they be more notorious in their falls, yet are they
upon recovery more notable for their graces. As Lute-strings, if they be true,
though sometimes, by being set too high or too low, they make an unpleasing
sound, yet being put into a right pitch and tune, they yield a more than
ordinary symphony and melody: so is it with a Christian of this temper,
although sometimes, when out of tune, he offends the eyes and ears both of
God and man, yet when he is again reduced to a good frame of spirit, he makes
excellent music beyond other men in the ears of both.

As for his own feelings, he has a kind of (...) in, his life, and in
himself. Sometimes more of the sweet, another while more of the sour: as he
finds the inconstancy of his temper to act him, or the power of grace
overcoming it. Nevertheless, he not only bewailes his sicklenesse, but labors
for constancy, and for that purpose enters into a stricter Covenant with his
eyes, lips, ears, and especially with his heart: then, with others, both with
his former companions in evil, that is, as Jacob with Laban, a parting
Covenant, a stone of separation Genesis 31* 51
, for ever to depart from them Ps. 119.115
; and with his Associates in Reformation, that the one may witness against the
other, if he should fall off, or fail; that the witness of the thing may bind
all the faster unto God Nehem. 9.38
. Yea, further, he renews Covenant with God himself, upon all such failings,
coming up even to the Oath and to the Curse, and that in his sight who alone is
able to help him to keep it Nehem. 10.29
. And having done this, he is careful to mind himself of it, and to make it
good, I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous
judgments Psalm. 119.106
.

On the contrary, the unregenerate, although he be unstable in all his ways,
Differ.
yet is he constantly evil, and always in it.

He is not only as the hypocrite, that has an heart, and an heart Jam. 1.8
, one (as he pretends) for God, and another, for any thing, like Theophrastus
his Partridges of Paphlogonia that had two heatts; but he has as many hearts
as lusts, and these carry and hurry him, now hither, now thither; any where,
every where, so that he is unstable in all his ways, that you know not where
to find him, save only in evil in the general, which agrees to all his ways.
For every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, are only evil continually
Genesis 6.5
.

He often varieth his steps, but never his way. He goes round as an horse in a
Mill: not from good to evil, for he was never good: not from evil to good, for
he never means to be good: but only from one way, or kind, or degree of evil
unto another; from one sin, error, or humor to another. He gaddeth about with
all earnestness, to change his way, as Judah, that sought first to the
Assyrian, then to Egypt, for help against the Chaldean; but never, to get into
Gods way, and therefore, with shame in both Jer. 2.36
, because still, in the way of sin.

Thus, the regenerate is uncertain in his particular walks, as a Deer that is
now here, now there; but always within the pales of the Park; but the
unregenerate roveth and strayeth as an out-lying stag, that is every where
trespassing upon the neighbors, not only within the purlues, but as far beyond
them, as he is able and dares to wander. The one is as the loyal wife, always
faithful, but otherwise very fickle and unconstant in her daily behavior
toward her husband: the other is as the loose gadding house-wife of Samaria
before her Conversion, that entertaineth a Paramour in stead of an husband,
after she had enjoyed husbands enough John 4
; or, as a wife that commits adultery, taking many strangers in stead of her
husband Ezekiel. 16.32
.
