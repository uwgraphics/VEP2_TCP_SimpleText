TO the end the World may the better take notice of His Majesty's Royal
Intention to observe the Act of Indemnity and General Pardon inviolably, for
the Public good and Satisfaction of all His Subjects, It was this day
Ordered, That a Copy of the Order of this Board of the 5th instant, touching
the illegal Proceedings in the Isle of Man against William Christian, and
putting him to death, contrary to the said Act of General Pardon, be sent unto
His Majesty's Printer; who is commanded forthwith to Print the same in the
English Letter, in Folio, in such manner as Acts of Parliament are usually
printed, and His Majesty's Arms prefixed.

Richard Brown.

At the Court at Whitehall, the 5th of August, 1663.
GEorge Christian, Son and Heir of William Christian deceased, having exhibited
his Complaint to His Majesty in Council, That his Father being at a House of
his in His Majesty's Isle of Man, was imprisoned by certain persons of that
Island, pretending themselves to be a Court of Justice; That he was by them
accused of High Treason, pretended to be committed against the Countess Dowager
of Derby, in the year 1651. And that they thereupon proceeded to Judgment, and
caused him to be put to death, notwithstanding the Act of General Pardon and
Indemnity (whereof he claimed the benefit) and his Appeal to His Majesty; and
humbly imploring His Majesty's Princely Compassion toward the distressed
Widow, and seven Fatherless Children of the deceased: His Majesty was
graciously pleased, with the Advice of His Council, to Order, That Thomas
Norris and Hugh Cannell, the two Judges (by them in that Island called
Deemsters) and Richard Stevenson, Robert Colcott, and Richard Tildesley, three
of the Members of the pretended Court of Justice, and Henry Nowell Deputy
Governor of the said Island, should be forthwith sent for, and brought up by a
Sergeant at Arms, here, before His Majesty in Council, to appear and answer to
such accusations as should be exhibited against them; which said six persons
being accordingly brought hither, and the fifteenth day of July last appointed
for a full hearing of the whole business, the Earl of Derby then also summoned
to appear, and the Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, and the Lord Chief
Baron of His Majesty's Exchequer, with the Kings Counsel Learned in the Laws
required to be present, and all parties called in, with their Counsel and
Witnesses; After full hearing of the whole matter on both sides, and the
parties-withdrawn, the said Judges being desired to deliver their Opinion, did
(in presence of the Kings Counsel Learned in the Laws) declare, That the Act of
General Pardon and Indemnity did, and ought to be understood to extend into
the Isle of Man, as well as into any other of His Majesty's Dominions, and
Plantations beyond the Seas; And that being a Public general Act of
Parliament, it ought to have been taken notice of by the Judges in the Isle of
Man, although it had not been pleaded, and although there were no Proclamation
made thereof: His Majesty being therefore deeply sensible of this great
Violation of His Act of General Pardon, whereof His Majesty has always been
very tender, and does expect and require, that all His Subjects in all His
Dominions and Plantations shall enjoy the full benefit and advantage of the
same; And having this day taken this business into further Consideration, and
all Parties called in and heard, did, by and with the Advice of the Council,
Order, and it is hereby Ordered, That all persons any way concerned in the
seizure of the Estate of the said William Christian deceased, or instrumental
in the Ejection of the Widow and Children out of their Houses and Fortune, do
take care, that entire Restitution be made of all the said Estate, as well real
as personal, as also all Damages sustained, with full Satisfaction for all
Profits by them received since the said Estate has been in their hands. And
that, whereas the said William Christian deceased, was one of the Two lives
remaining in an Estate in Lancashire, That the detriment accrewing by the
untimely death of the said William Christian, therein, or in like cases, shall
be estimated, and in like manner fully repaired. That in regard of the great
Trouble and Charges the Complaynants have been at in pursuit of this business,
Ordered, That they do exhibit to this Board a true Account upon Oath of all
Expenses and Damages by them sustained in the Iourneys of themselves and
Witnesses, and of all other their Charges in the following of this business.

And whereas Ewan Curghey, Samuel Ratcliffe, and John Caesar, were by the same
Court of Justice imprisoned, and had their Estates seized and confiscated,
without any legal Trial, It is Ordered, That the said Ewan Curghey, Samuel
Ratcliffe, and John Caesar be likewise restored to all their Estates real and
personal, and fully repaired in all the Charges and Expenses which they have
been at since their first Imprisonment, as well in the Prosecution of this
business, as in their Journey thither, or any other way whatsoever thereunto
relating; The which Satisfaction, Expenses, and all other Sums of Money to be
raised by virtue of this Order, are to be furnished by the Deemsters, Members,
and Assistants of the said Court of Justice, who are hereby Ordered to raise
all such the said Sums, and thereof to make due Payment, and give full
Satisfaction unto the Parties respectively hereby appointed to receive it.

And to the end the guilt of that Blood, which has been unjustly spilt, may in
some sort be expiated, and His Majesty receive some kind of Satisfaction for
the untimely loss of a Subject, It is Ordered, That the said Thomas Norris, and
Hugh Cannell, who Decreed this violent death, be committed, and remain
Prisoners in the Kings Bench, to be proceeded against in the Ordinary course of
Justice, so to receive condign punishment according to the merit of so heinous
a fact.

That Richard Stevenson, Robert Collcott, and Richard Tildesley be discharged
from farther Restraint, giving good Security to appear at this Board whenever
summoned, and not depart this City until full Satisfaction shall be given, and
all Orders of this Board whatsoever relating to this business fully executed in
the Island.

And in regard that upon the Examination of this business, it does appear, That
Edward Christian, being one of the Deemsters or Judges in the Isle of Man, did,
when the Court refused to admit of the deceased William Christians Plea of the
Art of Indemnity, make his Protestation against their Illegal Proceedings, and
did withdraw himself, and came into England to solicit His Majesty, and
implore His Justice: It is Ordered, That the Earl of Derby do forthwith by
Commission in due and accustomed manner, restore, constitute and appoint the
said Edward Christian one of the Deemsters or Judges of the said Island, so to
remain and continue in the due execution of the said place.

And lastly, It is Ordered, That the said Henry Nowell Deputy Governor, (whose
fault has been the not complying with, and yielding due obedience to the
Orders of His Majesty and this Board sent into the Island) giving good Security
to appear at this Board whenever summoned, be forthwith discharged from all
farther Restraint, and permitted to return into the Island; and he is hereby
strictly Commanded to employ the Power and Authority, which, by virtue of his
Commission he has in that Island, in performance of and obedience to all
Commands and Orders of His Majesty and this Board in this whole business, or
any way relating thereunto.
