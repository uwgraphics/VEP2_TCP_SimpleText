Cethegus's Apology FOR NONAPPEARANCE UPON HIS Conjurer's Summons.
THAT we appeared not at thy Friendly Call,
Know, 'twas not Want of Will nor Want of Gall,
(This the Sole Talent is of Souls in Thrall.
But We, once Slaves to ARBITRARY FATE,
Cannot Sham the LAWS of our COERCIVE STATE:
Then Muse not if I don't at SVMMONS come
To Thunder in GVILD-HALL, as erst in ROME.
Thy Friendly Lines received, and humbly Kissed,
I^ token of Applause our FVRIES Yelping, No North
Hissed:
And We, known Friends to your ASSOCIATION
Hell's Faction cited to swift CONSVLTATION.
From Korah down to Knox, All came on Breast,
With later IMPS shut out from BAXTER's Rest.
Thus met, We first Condol'd, That Souls born Free
Like Yours, should be retrenched by Monarchy,
Since Hells sole Privilege is Anarchy.
We pitty'd the Rejection of your Choice,
The Peoples (if not Gods) is sure Our Voice.
On quick Debate: Time must not now be spent;
(At this Consult BRADSHAW was PRESIDENT.
Resolved. -- No Devil like an Human wit,
None for GVILD-HALL Debates Below so fit.
On North-side of an useless, Tuberous Pile
A Wight lives, Chief Wigg-leader of your Isle:
Known to Men-Worthy, Hugged by Worthy Men,
Who ^ll Infernal Wiles has in his Ken.
To Him was Granted, in Year Forty Three
By Patent, Hell's Last Arch-Monopoly:
All Governments to Vex, in all admired to be.
To Him you have Applied; He Is All in All:
Our Furies need not, whilst His sill your Hall.
On then. -- All Hell's Extempore Effusions
Shall help to agravate That days Confusions;
We'll make such Medly with our Fiend-land Prayer,
That Ours with Yours sent up, shall Blast your Air.
Cartwright with our Ignatius shall join Tones,
A Wigg Nun.
Teresa with The wonderful Praying. Maid. of St. Ives, burnt afterward for a
Witch in New England.
Mall Hawkins send up Groans,
Jesuits and Wiggs shall all be Unisons.
Rest sure of Hells best wishes ALL and ONE,
From Cain to Mahomet and Muggleton.
Mean while by Pole and Noise Assert your Right
By Hell, it is Yours, although J. Moor deny't.
Let then no Foyles Heroique Souls Dismay;
Expect fresh Aids ere St. Michael's Day.
Sherman's Martyr's Day.
Disdain the slights of the Man you style LORD MAYOR;
His shall be Fallible, as PETER's Chair:
In this Assurance, Braves, your, Heads, up lift,
Dominion's Yours by Satan's DEED of GIFT:
And this Firm Tie Endears us to Your State
Both COVENANTS Love alike, alike ALLEGIANCE Hate.
FINIS.
