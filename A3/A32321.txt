His Majesty's Most Gracious SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Saturday
the 9th of November.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Am so very sensible of the great and extraordinary care you have already
taken, and still continue to show for the Safety and Preservation of my Person
in these Times of Danger, that I could not satisfy my self without coming
hither on purpose to give you All My most hearty thanks for it.

Nor do I think it enough to give you My thanks only, but I hold My Self
obliged to let you see withal, that I do as much study your Preservation too,
as I can possibly; and that I am as ready to join with you in all the ways and
means that may Establish a firm Security of the Protestant Religion, as your
own hearts can wish.

And this not only during My time (of which I am sure you have no fear) but in
all future Ages, even to the end of the world.

And therefore I am come to assure you, That whatsoever reasonable Bills you
shall present to be Passed into Laws, to make you Safe in the Reign of any
Successor (so as they tend not to Impeach the Right of Succession, nor the
Descent of the Crown in the true Line, and so as they restrain not My Power,
nor the Just Rights of any Protestant Successor) shall find from Me a ready
Concurrence.

And I desire you withal to think of some more effectual means for the
Conviction of Popish Recusants, and to expedite your Counsels as fast as you
can, that the World may see Our Unanimity, and that may have the opportunity of
showing you how ready I am to do any thing that may give Comfort and
Satisfaction to such Dutiful and Loyal Subjects.

FINIS.
