LONDON Printed by W. Godbid for J^h^ (...)

To the KING'S most Excellent Majesty, CHARLES the Second KING of Great
Britain, France and Ireland, Defendor of the Faith, etc.
Most Dread Sovereign,
THings Sacred are held most suitable for a Sacred Hand; And this emboldens me
to present These Hymns and Anthems to Your MAJESTY, the greatest part of them
being the Sense of the Royal Prophet King David; Which some of Your Majesty's
Servants, my Self and Others, have dressed in this Musical, though modern
Habit, principally to entertain Your own Royal and most Judicious Ear, that
having passed the highest Approbation may thereby appear without Exception.
Your Majesty since Your most happy Restoration has extended Your Royal
Bounty to the Advancement of this Divine Service more than any of Your
Ancestors, which must proceed from that Seraphick and judging Soul Your
Majesty is endued with above other Kings. The King of kings grant Your MAJESTY
a Long and Prosperous Reign over all Your Subjects, which is the daily Prayer of

Your Majesty's Ever-Loyall and most Obedient Subject, John Playford.

To all judicious Lovers and Understanders of MUSIC.
HAving formerly Published a Set of Music in folio, Entitled, [CANTICA
SACRA:] Containing Latin Hymns for Two and Three Voices to the ORGAN: all
Composed by our Famous Countryman Mr Richard Dering then Organist to the late
Royal QUEEN: And those finding so kind acceptance abroad, (especially among the
most judicious Professors of Music) gave me Encouragement to spare nor Cost
nor Pains to obtain more of that nature, to publish as an Addition for the
Benefit of such as had the Former. Those at the beginning (from the Second to
the Eighth) are much of Mr Dering's Way, yet by some believed not to be his,
but all that have heard them conclude them Excellently Good. The rest that
follow have their Authors Names written in their Foreheads, from whose Own
Hands I received them: which choice HYMNS, when exactly performed, will more
advance their due Commendations than my Pen is able.

With these Latin Hymns I thought to have concluded this Second Set; but some
noble Friends Seeing and Hearing performed (at my House) several Choice English
Anthems of like nature for Two Voices to an ORGAN, which I had obtained from
the Hands of these Excellent and knowing Masters, viz: Dr Gibbons, Dr Rogers,
Mr Matthew Lock, and Others; They much importuned me to Join them with the
Rest. To Gratify their Desires, and to Further any Thing that may conduce to
the Advancement of this Divine Science, I willingly consented, not doubting but
all that Know me will Believe I am a devout Lover and Encourager of MUSIC: For
which purpose, I have also adventured, at the End of all, to add some few
Compositions of mine Own; And if they find the least approbation, they will
encourage my further attempts of more.

As to the whole Work, I have (to the best of my skill) contrived it both for
public and private use, as will appear not only by the Fewness of Parts, but
the CANTUS Parts are all Printed in the G sol re vt Cliffe, and may properly be
Sung by Men as well as Boys or Weomen (to avoid the late Complaint against our
use of so many various Cliffs.) And the English Anthems have often been Sung in
several Cathedral Churches and College Chapels where there are two eminent
Voices.

My End and Hopes are the Promotion of the Divine Use of MUSIC, To the Honor
of HIM whose Gift it is to Mankind to Sing HIS Praises here on Earth, that they
may Hereafter Sing Eternal HALLELUJAH's with the Blessed Saints and Angels in
Everlasting Glory,

Which will also be the Happiness of John Playford.

^ SIng unto the Lord, Sing unto the Lord O ye Saints of His, And give Thanks
at the remembrance of His Holiness: For his Anger endures but a Moment, but a
Moment, a Moment, In His favor is life: Weeping may endure for a Night Weeping

Lord, Lord, Lord by Thy favor Thou have made my Mountain to stand strong, Thou
did hide Thy Face and I was troubled, I was troubled. I cried unto Thee O
Lord, And unto Thee Lord I made my supplica -- tion. What profit is there in my
blood, What profit is there in my blood, When I go ^ down in -- to the Pit?

Appetite. Chorus. O Thou Shield of our defense! O Thou Sun, whose influence
sweetly glydes in -- to our Hearts! Thou, who all good, who all Good to Thine

LONDON Printed by W. Godbid for John Playford 167^

To the KING'S most Excellent Majesty, CHARLES the Second, KING of Great
Britain, France and Ireland, Defendor of the Faith, etc.
Most Dread Sovereign,
THings Sacred are held most suitable for a Sacred Hand; And this emboldens me
to present These Hymns and Anthems to Your MAJESTY, the greatest part of them
being the Sense of the Royal Prophet King David; Which some of Your Majesty's
Servants, my Self and Others, have dressed in this Musical, though modern
Habit, principally to entertain Your own Royal and most Judicious Ear, that
having passed the highest Approbation may thereby appear without Exception.
Your Majesty since Your most happy Restoration has extended Your Royal
Bounty to the Advancement of this Divine Service more than any of Your
Ancestors, which must proceed from that Seraphick and judging Soul Your
Majesty is endued with above other Kings. The King of kings grant Your MAJESTY
a Long and Prosperous Reign over all Your Subjects, which is the daily Prayer of

Your Majesty's Ever-Loyall and most Obedient Subject, John Playford.

To all judicious Lovers and Understanders of MUSIC.
HAving formerly Published a Set of Music in folio, Entitled, [CANTICA
SACRA:] Containing Latin Hymns for Two and Three Voices to the ORGAN: all
Composed by our Famous Countryman Mr Richard Dering then Organist to the late
Royal QUEEN: And those finding so kind acceptance abroad, (especially among the
most judicious Professors of Music) gave me Encouragement to spare nor Cost
nor Pains to obtain more of that nature, to publish as an Addition for the
Benefit of such as had the Former. Those at the beginning (from the Second to
the Eighth) are much of Mr Dering's Way, yet by some believed not to be his,
but all that have heard them conclude them Excellently Good. The rest that
follow have their Authors Names written in their Foreheads, from whose Own
Hands I received them: which choice HYMNS, when exactly performed, will more
advance their due Commendations than my Pen is able.

With these Latin Hymns I thought to have concluded this Second Set; but some
noble Friends Seeing and Hearing performed (at my House) several Choice English
Anthems of like nature for Two Voices to an ORGAN, which I had obtained from
the Hands of these Excellent and knowing Masters, viz: Dr Gibbons, Dr Rogers,
Mr Matthew Lock, and Others; They much importuned me to Join them with the
Rest. To Gratify their Desires, and to Further any Thing that may conduce to
the Advancement of this Divine Science, I willingly consented, not doubting but
all that Know me will Believe I am a devout Lover and Encourager of MUSIC: For
which purpose, I have also adventured, at the End of all, to add some few
Compositions of mine Own; And if they find the least approbation, they will
encourage my further attempts of more.

As to the whole Work, I have (to the best of my skill) contrived it both for
public and private use, as will appear not only by the Fewness of Parts, but
the CANTUS Parts are all Printed in the G sol re vt Cliffe, and may properly be
Sung by Men as well as Boys or Weomen (to avoid the late Complaint against our
use of so many various Cliffs.) And the English Anthems have often been Sung in
several Cathedral Churches and College Chapels where there are two eminent
Voices.

My End and Hopes are the Promotion of the Divine Use of MUSIC, To the Honor
of HIM whose Gift it is to Mankind to Sing HIS Praises here on Earth, that they
may Hereafter Sing Eternal HALLELUJAH's with the Blessed Saints and Angels in
Everlasting Glory,

Which will also be the Happiness of John Playford.

Gloria Deo

depiction of harpist

To the KING'S most Excellent Majesty, CHARLES the Second, KING of Great
Britain, France and Ireland, Defendor of the Faith, etc.
Most Dread Sovereign,
THings Sacred are held most suitable for a Sacred Hand; And this emboldens me
to present These Hymns and Anthems to Your MAJESTY, the greatest part of them
being the Sense of the Royal Prophet King David; Which some of Your Majesty's
Servants, my Self and Others, have dressed in this Musical, though modern
Habit, principally to entertain Your own Royal and most Judicious Ear, that
having passed the highest Approbation may thereby appear without Exception.
Your Majesty since Your most happy Restoration has extended Your Royal
Bounty to the Advancement of this Divine Service more than any of Your
Ancestors, which must proceed from that Seraphick and judging Soul Your
Majesty is endued with above other Kings. The King of kings grant Your MAJESTY
a Long and Prosperous Reign over all Your Subjects, which is the daily Prayer of

Your Majesty's Ever-Loyall and most Obedient Subject, John Playford.

To all judicious Lovers and Understanders of MUSIC.
HAving formerly Published a Set of Music in folio, Entitled, [CANTICA
SACRA:] Containing Latin Hymns for Two and Three Voices to the ORGAN: all
Composed by our Famous Countryman Mr Richard Dering then Organist to the late
Royal QUEEN: And those finding so kind acceptance abroad, (especially among the
most judicious Professors of Music) gave me Encouragement to spare nor Cost
nor Pains to obtain more of that nature, to publish as an Addition for the
Benefit of such as had the Former. Those at the beginning (from the Second to
the Eighth) are much of Mr Dering's Way, yet by some believed not to be his,
but all that have heard them conclude them Excellently Good. The rest that
follow have their Authors Names written in their Foreheads, from whose Own
Hands I received them: which choice HYMNS, when exactly performed, will more
advance their due Commendations than my Pen is able.

With these Latin Hymns I thought to have concluded this Second Set; but some
noble Friends Seeing and Hearing performed (at my House) several Choice English
Anthems of like nature for Two Voices to an ORGAN, which I had obtained from
the Hands of these Excellent and knowing Masters, viz: Dr Gibbons, Dr Rogers,
Mr Matthew Lock, and Others; They much importuned me to Join them with the
Rest. To Gratify their Desires, and to Further any Thing that may conduce to
the Advancement of this Divine Science, I willingly consented, not doubting but
all that Know me will Believe I am a devout Lover and Encourager of MUSIC: For
which purpose, I have also adventured, at the End of all, to add some few
Compositions of mine Own; And if they find the least approbation, they will
encourage my further attempts of more.

As to the whole Work, I have (to the best of my skill) contrived it both for
public and private use, as will appear not only by the Fewness of Parts, but
the CANTUS Parts are all Printed in the G sol re vt Cliffe, and may properly be
Sung by Men as well as Boys or Weomen (to avoid the late Complaint against our
use of so many various Cliffs.) And the English Anthems have often been Sung in
several Cathedral Churches and College Chapels where there are two eminent
Voices.

My End and Hopes are the Promotion of the Divine Use of MUSIC, To the Honor
of HIM whose Gift it is to Mankind to Sing HIS Praises here on Earth, that they
may Hereafter Sing Eternal HALLELUJAH's with the Blessed Saints and Angels in
Everlasting Glory,

Which will also be the Happiness of John Playford.
