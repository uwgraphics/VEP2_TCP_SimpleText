A PROCLAMATION Declaring and Enjoining Observance of the Articles of Peace,
Commerce and Alliance, between His Majesty and the King of Spain.
CHARLES R.

BE it known unto all men, That to the glory and praise of Almighty God, for
the good and welfare of Christendom, and particularly for the increase of the
Happiness and Prosperity of Our Kingdoms and Dominions, and those of Our good
Brother the King of Spain, there have been Concluded in a Treaty at Madrid, the
Thirteenth day of May last, and now lately Ratified between Us and the said
King, Articles of Peace, Commerce and Alliance, not only for the renewing the
ancient Friendship which has been formerly between Our Royal Progenitors and
the Kings of Spain, but also for the maintaining a nearer Correspondence and
Intercourse, and enlarging the Liberties of Trade between the two Crowns and
their Subjects, and for the settlement thereof upon lasting Foundations.
Wherefore We do declare to all Our loving Subjects Our Will and Pleasure, That
the said Articles of Peace and Commerce be observed inviolably, as well by Land
as by Sea, and Fresh-waters, throughout all the Lands, Countries and Dominions
under Our Obedience; strictly Charging and Commanding them to take notice
hereof, and to observe and accomplish all that hereunto belongs.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twelfth day of February 1667/8. In the
Twentieth year of Our Reign.
