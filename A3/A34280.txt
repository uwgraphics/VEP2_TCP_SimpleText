A Congratulatory Poem ON His R. H's Entertainment in the City.
I Llustrious Prince, Heroical and Great,
Royal by Birth, with every Grace complete.
Wisdom and Virtue both adorn that Breast,
Framed for the Nations public Interest.
At your Approach Joy sits on every brow:
Know, Sr, the City does esteem you now.
Loyalty so long banished from this Place,
Returns with greater Splendour, sweeter Grace.
The late dark Clouds of Ignorance are gone,
And Faction that so spurred the Rabble on.
Popular Cheats appear in open view,
And men begin to love their Prince and you.
A Caesar's brother now has Justice done,
And shines more bright than the unclouded Sun.
To you next him we will our Tribute pay,
Scourge the dull Rout and teach them to obey.
I make a Present of our Youngsters Hearts,
Who Will die e're they will submit to Traitors Arts.
Successive Rights we with our Bloods will own,
Against all Associators of the Town,
Those Crack-brain'd Elves that level at the Crown.
Kingdoms and Thrones, Hereditary are,
Heaven has decre'd it and shall Mortals bare
To contradict what is determined there?
No, we know better things, but till that day
We Will for your Health and Safety, hourly pray.
