To the READER.
THis worthy Man, especially in his latter times, was surrounded (through Gods
blessing on him) with a very great confluence of what might give forth
Contentment to a vast spirit of his rank and calling. He was enriched with a
large measure of abilities and opportunities in serving his Lord (to glorify
whom, and do much good to others, is the divine part of a man gracious (which
he was) the highest and most solid satisfaction, and in many respects exceeds
what personal communion with God, singly considered, brings in) Besides, he
lived and dyed in a fullness of honor and esteem with the best of men, of
Saints; yea, the worst of enemies: Likewise of estate, and outward comforts
within his sphaere and rank; all which might and did afford Contentment to what
was outward in him. In the midst of these his study was to find out a more
sublime way, and hidden art of self sufficiency, then was in the power of all
things to contribute or teach: Such a skill as did not only poyse and compose
his spirit in the present enjoyment of all; but might fortify and furnish him
with provision for the future against the loss of all, in times wherein no man
knows what evil will be in the earth. This mark his first lines show he shot
at: This Art some Philosophers of old pretended themselves Masters of, and to
instruct other in, through the assistance of Natural and Moral elements,
elevated to the utmost height their Principles could carry them; but in vain:
Their Chemistry in this kind being able to produce no more but a sullen
obstinacy and obdurateness of mind. The natural Spirit of a man feeling it
self greater then all creatures, gathering up and consolidating it self into
it self, is able (as Solomon says) to sustain its own, and all other
infirmites. But that Autarchy this Author here presents, is a Mystery, which 1 Timothy 6.6.
none of these Princes of the world knew, 1 Cor. 2.
or the wisdom of man teaches, but the holy Ghost teaches; and which few,
but those that are perfect, do attain: Teaching the soul to deny it self
into weakness, emptiness, in and to its self and all things else; and thus
dissolved to unite it self to him who only has blessedness and
all-sufficiencie, with whom associated and made intimate, it melts it self
into all his interests, making them its own, and thereby comes to have all
that All Sufficiency of the High God to be its self-sufficiency: And then, what
state can that soul be in, wherein it may not be content? seeing it has God
to be the chiefest comfort in its best times, and only comfort in its worst.
This, though it be the inheritance of every Saint, in the right and title to
it, yet the possession and enjoyment of it, depepends upon an improvement of
this inheritance, and that upon a skill which is to be learned by experience
and much exercise (as Paul speaks) I have learned in whatsoever estate I am,
therewith to be content. This piece of learning this serious spirited man
inured himself unto, and digging for it as Rubies, as Solomon's scholar for
wisdom, has found it, and has hewn forth this Jewel (a Title given neither
by himself, not us the Publishers, to the subject it self, yet the materials
themselves deserving it) out of the Rock, and has artificially cut it) that
the innate rays of this so glorious a Grace might shine forth to others. And
here it comes to be presented, though set forth as the richest Jewels are,
often for awhile, in ruder metal, until bargained for, but then are placed in
Tablets worthy of them. The only seat this is ordained for; is the precious
Tablets of men's Hearts, in and from which alone the native luster of it will be
made conspicuous. Reader, buy it, set and wear it there, Prove. 3.
and it shall (as Solomon speaks) be life unto thy soul, and grace unto thy
neck: Thou shall not be afraid when thou lie down; yea thy sleep shall be
sweet unto thee: for the Lord will be thy confidence.

FINIS.
THE RARE JEWEL OF CHRISTIAN Contentment.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


HERE is a very seasonable Cordial to revive the drooping spirits of the Saints
in these sad and sinking times: For the hour of temptation is already come upon
all the world to try the Inhabitants of the earth; and in special, this is the
day of Jacobs troubles in our own bowels.

Our great Apostle experimentally holds forth in this Gospel-Text, the very
life and soul of all practical Divinity; wherein we may plainly read his own
proficiency in Christ's School; and what lesson every Christian that would
evidence the power and growth of godliness in his own soul, must necessarily
learn from him.

These words are brought in by Paul, as a plain argument to persuade the
Philippians that he did not seek after great things in the world, and that he
sought not theirs, but them: He did not pass for a great estate; he had better
things to take up his heart withal. I do not speak (says he) in respect of
want, [ For] whether I have or have not, my heart is fully satisfied, I have
enough; I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

I have learned.] Contentment in every condition is a great art, a spiritual
mystery: It is to be learned, and so to be learned as a mystery; And therefore
verse 12. he affirms, I know how to be ab^sed, and I know how to abound, every
where and in all things I am instructed: The word (...)
which is translated [ Instructed] is derived from that word (...).
which signifies Mystery; and it is as much as if he had said, I have learned
the mystery of this business. Contentment is to be learned as a great mystery;
and those that are thoroughly trained up in that art, have learned a deep
Mystery; The which is, as Sampsons riddle to a natural man. [ I have learned
it.] It is not now to learn; neither had I it at first; I have attained it
though with much ado, and now by the grace of God I am become master of this
art.

In whatsoever state I am.] The word [ State] is not in the Original, but,
(...).
In what I am, that is, in whatsoever concerns or befalls me, whether I have
little or nothing at all.

Therewith to be content] The word (...),
which we render Content here, has in the Original much elegancy and fullness
of signification in it. In strictness of phrase it is only attributed unto
God, who has styled himself God alsufficiant, as resting wholly satisfied in
and with himself alone; but he is pleased freely to comunicate of his fullness
to the creature so that from God in Christ the Saints receive grace for grace,
Joh. 1.16. in so much that there is in them an answerablenesse of the same grace
in their proportion that is in Christ. And in this sense Paul says, I have a
Self-sufficiency, as the word notes.

But has Paul a self-sufficiency you will say? How are we sufficient of our
selves? Our Apostle affirms in another case, That we are not sufficient of our
selves to think any thing as of our selves? 2 Cor. 3.5. His meaning therefore
must be, I find a sufficiency of satisfaction in my own heart, through the
grace of Christ that is in me; though I have not outward comforts and worldly
accommodations to supply my necessities, yet I enjoy portion enough betwixt
Christ and my own soul abundantly to satisfy me in every condition. And this
interpretation is suitable to that place, Pro. 14.1^. A good man is satisfied
from himself; and agreeable to what he verifies of himself in another place;
that though he had nothing yet he possessed all things; because he had right to
the covenant and promise, which virtually contains all, and an interest in
Christ the fountain and good of all, and having that, no marvel he says that
in whatsoever state he was in, he was content. Thus you have the genuine
interpretation of the text. I shall not make any division of the words, because
I take them only to prosecute that one duty most necessary, viz. The quieting
and comforting the hearts of Gods people under the troubles and changes they
meet withal, in these heart-shaking times, And the doctrinal conclusion is in
brief this.

Doct. That to be well skilled in the mystery of Christian Contentment is the
Duty, Glory, and Excellency of a Christian.

This Evangelical truth is held forth sufficiently in Scripture; yet take one
or two parallel places more for the confirmation of it. 1 Timothy 6.6, and 8. you
have both the duty expressed, and the glory thereof: Having food and raiment
(says he verse. 8.) let us be therewith content, there is the duty; But
godliness with Contentment is great gain, verse. 6. there is the glory and
excellency of it: as if godliness were not gain except there were Contentment
withal. The like exhortation you have in Heb. 13.5. Let your conversation be
without Covetousness, and be content with such things as you have. I do not
find any Apostle or Writer of Scripture treat so much of this spiritual mystery
of Contentment as this our Apostle has done throughout his Epistles.

For the clear opening and proving of this practical conclusion, I shall
endeavor to demonstrate these four things;

First, The nature of this Christian Contentment, what it is.

Secondly, The art and mystery of it.

Thirdly, What those lessons are that must be learned to work the heart to
contentment.

Fourthly, Wherein the glorious excellencies of this grace does principally
consist.

Concerming the first, take this description; Christian Contentment is that
sweet, inward, quiet, gracious frame of spirit, freely submitting to, and
taking complacency in Gods wise, and fatherly dispose in every condition.

I shall break open this description, for it is a box of precious ointment,
very comfortable and useful for troubled hearts, in troubled time and
conditions.

First, Contentment (I say) is a sweet [inward] heart thing, it is a work of
the spirit within doors: It is not only a not-seeking help to our selves by
outward violence, or a forbearance of discontented murmuring expressions, in
froward words and carriages against God or others; but it is the inward
submission of the heart. Psalm. 62.1. Truly, my soul waits upon God; and ver.
5. My soul wait thou only upon God, so it is in your Books; but the words may
be translated as rightly, My soul be thou silent unto God; Hold thy peace O my
soul: Not only the tongue must hold it is peace, but the soul must be silent:
Many may sit down silently, forbearing discontented expressions, yet are
inwardly swollen with coffeehouse; now this manifests a perplexed
distemper and a great frowardness in their hearts: And God notwithstanding
their outward silence hears the peevish fretting language of their souls. The
shoe may be smooth and neat without, whilst the flesh is pinched within: There
may be much calmnesse and stillness outwardly, and yet wonderful confusion,
bitterness, disturbance and vexation within. Some are so weak that they are
not able to contain the disquietness of their own spirits, but in words and
behavior discover what woeful perturbations there are within, their spirits
being like the raging Sea casting forth nothing but mire and dirt, being not
only troublesome to themselves but to all those they live with: Others there
are who are able to keep in such distempers of heart, (as Judas did when he
betrayed Christ with a kiss,) but still they boil inwardly and eat like a
Cankes: As David speaks concerning some whose words are smoother than honey,
and butter, and yet have war in their hearts; and as he says in another place,
whilst I kept silence my bones waxed old; so these, whilst there is a serene
calm upon their tongues, have yet blustering storms in their spirits, and
whilst they keep silence their hearts are troubled, and even worn away with
anguish and vexation; they have peace and quiet outwardly, but war from the
unruly and turbulent workings of their hearts, that is within. If the
attainment to true Contentment were as easy as keeping quiet outwardly, there
need be no great learning of it; it might be had with less skill and strength
than an Apostle had; yea than an ordinary Christian has or may have. Therefore
certainly there is a great deal more in it than can be attained by common
gifts, and ordinary power of reason, which often bridles in nature. It is a
heart-businesse.

Secondly, It is the [quiet] of the heart; All is sedate and still there, and
to understand this the better; This quiet gracious frame of spirit, It is not
opposed.

1 To a due sense of affliction. God does give leave to his people to be
sensible of what they suffer: Christ does not say, Do not count that a cross
which is a cross, but take up your cross daily. As it is in the body natural,
if the body takes physic and is not able to bear it but presently vomits it
up, or if it be not at all sensible, if it stir not the body; either of these
ways the physic does no good, but argues the body much distempered and will
hardly be cured. So it is with the spirits of men under afflictions; if either
they cannot bear Gods potions but cast them up again, or are not sensible of
them, and their souls are no more stirred by them than the body is by a draught
of small beer, it is a sad symptom that their souls are in a dangerous and
almost incurable condition. So that this inward quietness is not in opposition
to the sense of affliction: for indeed there were no true Contentment if you
were not apprehensive and sensible of your afflictions when God is angry. It is
not opposed.

2 To an orderly making our moan and complaint to God, and to our friends.
Though a Christian ought to be quiet under Gods correcting hand, yet he may
without any breach of Christian contentment complain to God; (as one of the
Ancients says) though not with a tumultuous clamor and skreeking out in a
perplexed passion, yet in a quit still submissive way he may unbosom his heart
unto God. And likewise communicate his sad condition to his gracious friends,
showing them how God has dealt with him and how heavy the affliction is upon
him, that they may speak a word in due season to his wearied soul. It is not
opposed.

3 To all lawful seeking out for help into another condition, or simply
endeavoring to be delivered out of the present affliction by the use of
lawful means. No, I may lay in provision for my deliverance, and use Gods
means, waiting on him, because I know not but that it may be his will to alter
my condition, and so far as he leads me I may follow his providence, it is but
my duty. God is thus far mercifully indulgent to our weakness, and he will not
take it ill at our hands if by earnest and importunate prayer we seek unto him
for deliverance, till we know his good pleasure therein. And certainly thus
seeking for help with such a submission and holy resignation of spirit, to be
delivered when God will, and as God will, and how God will, so that our wills
are melted into the will of God, this is no opposition to the quietness which
God requires in a contented spirit.

Quest. But then, what is this quietness of spirit opposed unto?

Ans. To murmuring and repining at the hand of God; as the discontented
Israelits often did, which if we our selves cannot endure either in our
children or servants, much less can God bear it in us.

2 To vexing and fretting; which is a degree beyond murmuring. It is a speech I
remember of an Heathen, A wise man may greive under, but not be vexed with his
afflictions. There is a vast difference betwixt a kindly grieving and a
distempered vexation.

3 To tumultuousness of spirit: When the thoughts run distractingly and work in
a confused manner, so that the affections are like the unruly multitude in the
Acts, who knew not for what end they were come together. The Lord expects that
you should be silent under his rod, and as he said in Act. 19.36. You ought to
be quiet and to do nothing rashly.

4 To unsetledness and unfixedness of spirit, whereby the heart is taken off
from the present duty that God requires in our several relations, both toward
God, our selves, and others. We should prize duty at a higher rate than to be
taken off by every trivial occasion; a Christian indeed values every service of
God so much, that though some may be in the eye of the world and of natural
reason, a slight empty business, beggarly rudiments, foolishness, yet seeing
God calls for it, the authority of the command does so over awe his heart, that
he is willing to spend himself and to be spent in the discharge of it. It is an
expression of Luthers, ordinary works that are done in faith, and from faith,
are more precious than heaven and earth. And if this be so, and a Christian
know it, it is not a little matter that should divert him: but he should answer
every avocation, and resist every tentation, as Nehemiah did chap. 6.3.
Sanballat, Geshem, and Tobiah (when they would have hindered the building of the
wall) with this, I am doing a great wo^k (says he) so that I cannot come down,
why should the work of the Lord cease?

5 To distracting, heart-eating cares and fears. A gracious heart so estimates
it is union with Christ and the work that God sets it about, as it will not
willingly suffer any thing to come in to choke it, or dead it. A Christian is
desirous that the word of God should take such full possession as to divide
between soul and spirit, but he would not suffer the fear and noise of
evil-tidings to take such impression in his soul, as to make a division and
struggling there, like the twins in Rebeckah's womb. A great man will permit
common people to stand without his doors, but he will not let them come in and
make a noise in his closet or bedchamber when he purposely retires himself
from all worldly employments. So a well tempered spirit though it may inquire
after things abroad without doors in the world, and suffer some ordinary cares
and fears to break in to the suburbs of the soul, so as to have a light touch
upon the thoughts: Yet it will not upon any terms admit of an intrusion into
the privy-chamber, which should be wholly reserved for Jesus Christ as his
inward Temple.

6 To sinking discouragements. When things fall not out according to
expectation, when the tide of second causes runs so low that we see little left
in the outward means to bear up our hopes and hearts. That then the heart
begins to reason as he in the Kings, If the Lord should open the windows of
heaven how should this be? Never considering that God can open the eyes of the
blind with clay and spittle, he can work above, beyond, nay contrary to means;
he often makes the fairest flowers of man's endeavors to wither, and brings
improbable things to pass, that the glory of interprizes may be given to
himself. Nay if his people stand in need of miracles to work their deliverance,
miracles fall as easily out of Gods hands, as to give his people daily bread.
Gods blessing is many times secret upon his servants that they know not which
way it comes; as 2 Kings, 3.17. Ye shall not see wind, neither shall you see
rain, yet the valley shall be filled with water, God would have us depend on
him though we do not see means how the thing should be brought to pass, else
we do not show a quiet spirit; though an affliction be upon thee, let not thy
heart sink under it. So far as thy heart sinks and thou art discouraged under
thy affliction, so much thou want of this lesson of Contentment.

7 To sinful shiftings and shirkings out for ease and help. As we see in Saul
running to the witch of Endor, and in his offering sacrifice before Samuel
came: Nay the good King Jehoshaphat joins himself with Ahaziah 2 Chronicles. 20.
Vlt. And Asa goes to Penhadad King of Assyria for help, not relying upon the
Lord, (2 Chr. 16.7, 8.) Though the Lord had delivered the Ethiopian Army into
his hands, consisting of a thousand thousand, 2 Chro. 14.11. And good Jacob
joined in a lie with his mother to Isaac, he was not content to stay Gods time,
and use Gods means, but made too great haste and stepped out of his way, to
procure the blessing which God intended for him: as many do through the
corruption of their hearts and weakness of their faith, because they are not
able to trust God, and follow him fully in all things and always; and for this
cause the Lord often follows the Saints with many sore temporal crosses, (as we
see in Jacob) though they obtain the mercy. It may be thy wretched carnal heart
thinks, I care not how I be delivered, so I may but get free from it: Is it not
so many times in some of your hearts when any cross or affliction befalls you?
Have not you such kind of workings of spirit as this; Oh that I could but be
delivered out of this affliction any way, I would not care; your hearts are far
from being quiet. And this sinful shifting is the next thing in opposition to
this quietness, which God requires in a contented spirit.

The Eighth and last thing that this quietness of Spirit is opposite to, is
desparate risings of heart against God in a way of rebellion: That is most
abominable. I hope many of you have learned so far to be content, as to keep
down your hearts from such distempers; and yet the truth is, not only wicked
men, but sometimes the very Saints of God find the beginnings of this, when an
affliction lies long, and is very sore and heavy upon them indeed, and strikes
them as it were in the master vein; they find somewhat of this in their hearts,
arising against God, their thoughts begin to bubble, and their affections begin
to stir in rising against God himself; especially such as together with their
corruptions have much melancholy, and the Devil working both upon the
corruptions of their hearts, and the melancholy distemper of their bodies;
though there may lie much grace at the bottom, yet there may be some risings
against God himself under affliction. Now Christian quietness is opposite to
all these things: that is, When afflictions come, be it what affliction it will
be, yet you do not murmur, though you be sensible, though you make your moan,
though you desire to be delivered, and seek it by all good means, yet you do
not murmur nor repine, you do not fret, nor vex, there is not that
tumultuousness of spirit in you, there is not unsetledness in your spirits,
there are not distracting fears in your hearts, no sinking discouragements, no
base shiftings, no rising in rebellion any way against God: This is the
quietness of Spirit under an affliction, and that is the second thing when the
soul is so far able to bear an affliction as to keep quiet under it.

Now the Third thing I would open in the description is this, It is an inward,
quiet, gracious [frame] of Spirit. It is a frame of Spirit, and then a gracious
frame of Spirit. Contentment it is a Soul business, First it is inward;
Secondly quiet; Thirdly it is a quiet Frame of Spirit. [ Frame] by that I mean
these Three things: There are Three things considerable when I say, Contentment
consists in the quiet frame of the Spirit of a man.

First, That it is a grace that spreads it self through the whole Soul: as thus,
It is in the judgment, that is, The judgment of the soul of a man or woman
tends to quiet the heart: In my judgment I am satisfied, that is one thing to
be satisfied in ones understanding and judgment, as thus, This is the hand of
God; and this is that that is suitable to my condition, or best for me; although
I do not see the reason of the thing, yet I am satisfied in my judgment about
it.

And then it is in the thoughts of a man or woman: As my judgment is
satisfied, so my thoughts are kept in order.

And then it comes to the will, My will yields and submits to it, my affections
are all likewise kept in order, so that it goes through the whole soul. There is
in some a partial Contentment, and so it is not the frame of the soul, but some
part of the soul has some Contentment, as thus, Many a man may be satisfied in
his judgment about a thing, and yet cannot for his life rule his affections,
nor his thoughts, cannot rule his thoughts, nor the will, nor the affections
though the judgments be satisfied: I make no question but many of you may know
this by your own experience, if you do but observe the workings of your own
hearts. Cannot you say when such an affliction befalls you, I can bless God I
am satisfied in my judgment about it, I have nothing in the world to say in
respect of my judgment against it, I see the hand of God and I should be
content: yea I am satisfied in my judgment, that my condition is a good
condition in which I am; but I cannot for my life rule my thoughts, and will,
and my affections, me thinks I feel my heart heavy, and sad, and troubled more
than it should be, and yet my judgment is satisfied. This seemed to be the case
of David, Psalm. 43. O my Soul why art thou disquieted? David as far as his
judgment went, there was a contentedness, that is, His judgment was satisfied
in the work of God upon him; and he was troubled, but he knew not wherefore, O
my soul why art thou east down within me? That Psalm is a very good Psalm for
those that feel a fretting, discontented distemper in their hearts at any time,
for them to be reading or singing: he has it once or twice in that Psalm, Why
art thou cast down O my soul? In verse. 5. And why art thou disquieted within
me? hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him, for the help of his
countenance. David had enough to quiet him, and that that he had had prevailed
with his judgment, but after it had prevailed with his judgment he could not
get it further. He could not get this grace of Contentment to go through the
whole frame of the Soul. There is a great deal of stir sometimes to get
Contentment into their judgments, that is, To satisfy their judgment about
their condition: Come to many, that the hand of God is upon perhaps in a
grievous manner, and seek to satisfy them, and tell them that there is no such
cause to be disquieted, O not such cause says the troubled spirit! O then
there is no cause that any should be disquieted; there was never any such
affliction as I have! and a hundred things they have to put off what is said to
them, so as you cannot so much as get into their judgments to satisfy them;
but there is a great deal of hope of Contentment if once your judgments come to
be satisfied, that you can sit down and say in your judgments, I see cause to
be contented; but though you have gotten thus far, yet you may have much to do
with your hearts afterward: for there is such unrulinesse in our thoughts and
affections, that our judgments are not able always to rule our thoughts and
affections, and that makes me to say, That Contentment is an inward, quiet,
gracious frame of Spirit, that is, the whole Soul, Judgment, Thoughts, Will,
Affections and all are satisfied and quiet. I suppose in the very opening this,
you begin to see it is a lesson that you had need learn, and it is not a thing
soon got, if Contentment be such a thing as this is.

The Second thing is this, which is very observable, That spiritual contentment
comes from the frame of the Soul. A man or woman that is contented in a right
way, their Contentment does not so much come from outward arguments, or any
outward thing that helps them to be content, as it does from the disposition of
their own hearts; It is the disposition of their own hearts that causes this
Contentment; that brings forth this gracious Contentment rather than any
external thing that does it; as thus I would open my self, one that is
disquieted, suppose a child, or man, or woman, if you come and bring them some
great matter to please them, that perhaps will quiet them, and they will be
contented; it is the thing you bring them that quiets them, but it is not the
disposition of their own spirits, not from any good temper that there is in
their own hearts: but from some external thing that is brought them: but when a
Christian is contented in a right way, the quiet does come more from the inward
temper and disposition of their own hearts than from any external arguments, or
possession of any thing in the world. I would yet open this further to you in
this Similitude. The being content upon some external thing, it is like the
warming of a man's clothes by the fire; but being content by the inward
disposition of the soul, it is like the warmth that a man's clothes has from
the natural heat of his body: A man that is of a healthful body, he puts on his
clothes, and perhaps when he puts them on at the first in a cold morning he
feels his clothes cold; but after he has them on a little while, they are
warm; why how come they warm? they came not nigh the fire: No, but it came from
the natural heat of his body. Now a sickly man that has his natural heat
decayed, if he put on his clothes cold, they will not be hot in a long time,
but he must have them warmed by the fire, and then they will quickly be cold
again; So this will difference the Contentments of men. There are some men now
that are very gracious, and when an affliction comes upon them, indeed at first
it seems to be a little cold, but after it has been on a while, the very
temper of their hearts being gracious it makes their afflictions easy, and
makes them to be quiet under it, and not to complain of any coffeehouse. But
now you shall have others that have an affliction upon them, that have not this
good temper in their hearts, their afflictions are very cold upon them and
grievous; and it may be if you bring them some external arguments, somewhat from
without, as the fire that warms the clothes, perhaps they will be quiet for a
while: but alas, wanting a gracious disposition within in their own hearts that
warmth will not hold long. The warmth of the fire, that is, a Contentment that
comes merely from external arguments will not hold long, but that holds that
does come from the gracious temper of the Spirit. It is from the frame and the
disposition of the spirit of a man or woman, there is the true Contentment. But
this we shall speak too further in the opening of the Mystery of Contentment.

The Third thing is this, It is the frame of Spirit, that shows the
habitualness of this grace of Contentment. Contentment is not merely one act, a
flash in a good mood; you shall have many men and women, that take them in some
good mood and they will be very quiet; but this will not hold, this is not in a
constant way, there is not a constant tenor of their spirits to be holy and
gracious under affliction: But I say, It is the quiet frame of spirit, by that
I mean, The habitual disposition of their Souls, that it is not only at this
time, and the other time when you take men and women in a good mood, but it is
the constant tenor and temper of the heart; that is a Christian that has
learned this lesson of Contentment, that in the constant tenor and temper of
heart is contented, and can carry it is self quietly in a constant way, or else
it is worth nothing: for there is no body that is so furious in their
discontent, but will be quiet in some good mood or other. Now First it is a
heart-business; Secondly, it is the heart-quiet; and then Thirdly, it is the
frame of the heart.

But Fourthly, It is the [gracious] frame of the heart. Indeed in Contentment
there is a composition of all graces if the Contentment be Spiritual, if it be
truly Christian, there is I say a composition of all Spiritual graces; As it
is in some Oils, there is a composition of a great many very precious
ingredients: so in this grace of Contentment, which we shall yet further speak
of in the opening of the Excellency of it. But now the gracious frame of Spirit
is in opposition to Three things;

1 First, In opposition to the natural stilness that there is in many men and
women. There is some of such a natural constitution that makes them to be more
still and more quiet than others: others are of a violent and hot constitution,
and they are more impatient than others.

2 Secondly. In opposition to a sturdy resolution. As some men through the
strength of some sturdy resolution, they have not seemed to be troubled let
come what will come; and so it may be that through a sturdy resolution at some
times they are not so much disquieted as others are.

Thirdly, In way of distinction, from the very strength of reason (though not
sanctified) the strength of natural reason may quiet the heart in some measure.
But now I say, A gracious frame of spirit is not a mere stillness of body
through a natural constitution and temper, nor sturdinesse of resolution, nor
merely through the strength of reason.

You will say, wherein is this graciousness of Contentment distinguished from
all these? More of this will be spoken to when we show the mystery of it, and
the lessons that are learned, but now we may speak a little by way of
distinction here, as now, From the natural stillness of men's spirits, many men
and women have such a natural stillness of spirit, and constitution of body,
that you shall find them seldom disquieted. But now mark these kind of people
that are so, they likewise are very dull, of a dull spirit in any good thing,
they have no quickness, nor liveliness of spirit in that which is good; but
now mark where contentment of heart is gracious, the heart is very quick and
lively in the service of God, yea the more any gracious heart can bring its
self to be in a contented disposition Oh the more fit it is for any service of
God, and is very active and lively in Gods service, not dull in the service of
God: And as a Contented heart is very active and stirring in the work of God,
so he is very active and stirring in sanctifying Gods Name in the affliction
that does befall him: The difference will appear very clear thus, One that is
of a still disposition, he is not disquieted indeed as others, neither has he
any activenesse of spirit in sanctifying the Name of God in the affliction; but
now one that is content in a gracious way as he ^s not disquieted, but keep his
heartt quiet in respect of vexing and trouble, so on the other side he is not
dull nor heavy but is very active to sanctify Gods Name in the affliction thas
is upon him, for it is not enough merely not to murmur, not to be discontented
and troubled, but you must be active in the sanctifying Gods Name in the
affliction. And indeed this will distinguish it from the other, from a sturdy
resolution, I will not be troubled: but though you have a sturdy resolution
that you will not be troubled, is there a conscionablenesse in you to sanctify
Gods Name in your affliction, and does it come from thence? That is the main
thing that brings the quiet of heart, and helps against discontentednesse in a
gracious heart. I say the desire and care that thy soul has to sanctify Gods
Name in an affliction, it is that that quiets the soul, which does not in the
other. Neither when it is merely from reason: As Socrates it is said of him
(though he were but an heathen) that what ever befell him he would never so much
as change his countenance, and he got this power over his spirit merely by
strength of reason and morallity: but now this gracious contentment comes from
principles beyond the strength of reason. I cannot open that, (from whence it
comes) till we come to open the mystery of spiritual Contentment. I will only
give you this one note of difference between a man and a woman that is
contented in a natural way, and another that is contented in a spiritual way.
Those that are contented in a natural way, they overcome themselves when
outward afflictions does befall them, they are contented, yea and they are
contented as well when they commit sin against God, either when they have
outward crosses or when God is dishonored it is all one, either when
themselves are crossed or when God is crossed; but now a gracious heart that is
contented with it is own affliction, yet mightily rises when God is dishonored.

The Fifth is [ Freely] freely submitting to, and taking complacency in Gods
dispose, it is a free work of the spirit: now there are four things to be
opened in this freedom of spirit.

First, that the heart is readily brought over, that that one does freely there
is no great stir to bring them to it; there are many men and women when their
afflictions are grievous upon them, with much ado they are brought to be
contented, a great deal of stir there is to quiet their hearts when they are
under affliction, yet at last perhaps they are brought to it, I but now this
does not come off freely: if I desire a thing of another and I get it perhaps
with much ado, and a great deal of stir there is, but here is no freedom of
spirit; but when a man is free in a thing do but mention it and presently he
comes off to it. So if you have learned this art of Contentment, you will not
only be contented after a great deal of do to quiet your hearts, but readily as
soon as ever you do come to think that it is the hand of God, your heart
presently closes.

Secondly, freely, That is not by constraint, not patience by force (as we use
to say.) As many will say that you must be content, this is the hand of God and
there is no help for it; O this is too low an expression for Christians, yet
when Christians come to visit one another, they say friend or neighbor you
must be content, this is to low an expression for a Christian, Must be content,
no, readily, and freely I will be content. It is suitable to my heart to yield
to God, and to be content, I find it is a thing that comes off of it self, that
my soul will be content. Oh you should answer your friends so that come and
tell you you must be content, nay I am willing to yield to God, and I am freely
content, that is the Second. And then a free act it comes after a rational way,
that is freedom, that is, it does not come through ignorance, because I know no
better condition, or that I know not what my affliction is, I but it comes
through a sanctified judgment, for that is the reason that no creature can do
an act of freedom, but the rational creature, the liberty of action is only in
rational creatures, and it comes from hence, for that is only freedom and out of
liberty that is wrought in a rational way, as a natural freedom is when I by my
judgment see what is to be done, understand the thing, and then there is a
closing with what I do understand in my judgment, that is freely done; but now
if a man does a thing, and understands not what he does, he cannot be said to
do it freely. So if men are contented, but it is because they understand not
what their affliction is, or because they understand no better, this is not
freely: as for instance, Suppose a Child born in a prison and never in all his
life went out, the Child is contented, why? Because he never knew better, but
this is no free act of Contentation. But now for men and women that do know
better, that know that the condition in which they are in it is an afflicted
condition, and a sad condition, and yet they can bring their hearts to a
Contentation out of a sunctified judgment, this is freedom

Thirdly, This freedom it is in opposition to stupidness, for a man and woman
may be contented merely out of want of sense, this is not free, as a man in a
dead palsy that does not feel you nip his flesh, he is not freely patient; but
if one should have their flesh nipt, and feel it, and yet for all that can be
able to bridle themselves, and do it freely, that is another matter. So it is
here, many are contented merely out of stupidnesse, they have a dead palsy
upon them; but now a gracious heart has sense enough, and yet is contented,
and therefore is free.

Sixthly, Freely [submitting] to, and taking complacency in Gods dispose.
Submitting to Gods dispose, What is that? The word Submit, it signifies nothing
else, but to send under; as thus, One that is discontented, the heart will be
unruly, and would even get above God so far as coffeehouse prevails; but
now comes the grace of Contentment and sends it under; to submit, it is to send
under a thing; now when the soul comes to see the unrulinesse that there is in
it, here is the hand of God that brings an affliction, and my heart is troubled
and discontented; what says the Soul? Will thou be above God? Is it not Gods
hand, and must thy will be regarded more than Gods? O under, under, O thou soul
get under, keep under, keep low, keep under Gods feet; thou art under Gods
feet, and keep under his feet, keep under the Authority of God, the Majesty of
God, the Soveraignity of God, the Power that God has over thee: Keep under,
that is to submit; then the Soul can submit to God when it can send it is self
under the Power and Authority, and Soveraignity, and Dominion that God has
over it; that is the Sixth Particular: Yea but that is not enough, yet you have
not got to this Grace of Contentment, except in the next place you take.

Seventhly, Taking a [complacency] in Gods dispose. That is thus, I am well
pleased in what God does, so far as I can see God in it, though as I said, I
may be sensible of the affliction, and may desire that God in his due time
would take it off, and use means to take it off; yet I may be well pleased so
far as Gods hand is in it. To be well pleased with Gods hand, that is a higher
degree than the other: and this comes from hence, not only because I see that I
should be content in this affliction, but because I see that there is good in
this affliction. I find there is honey in this rock, and so I do not only say, I
must, or I will submit to Gods hand: no, but the hand of God is good; it is
good that I am afflicted. That it is just that I am afflicted, that may be in
one that is not truly contented; I may be convinced that God deals justly in
this, God is righteous and just, and it is fit I should submit to what he has
done, O the Lord has done righteously in all his ways: but that is not enough,
but thou must say Good is the hand of the Lord, the expression of old Ely, Good
is the word of the Lord, when it was a sore and hard word, that word that did
threaten very grievous things to Ely and his house, and yet, Good is the word
of the Lord, says Ely. Perhaps some of you may say as David, It is good that I
was afflicted; nay, you must come to say thus, It is good that I am afflicted.
Not good when you see the good fruit that it has wrought, but when you are
afflicted to say, It is good that I am afflicted: Whatever the affliction be,
yet through the mercy of God my condition is a good condition; it is the top
indeed, and the height of this art of Contentment to come to this pitch, to be
able to say, Well, my condition and afflictions are thus and thus, and is very
grievous and sore, yet I am through Gods mercy in a good condition, and the
hand of God is good upon me notwithstanding. Now I should have given you diverse
Scriptures about this, I shall but give you one or two that are very
remarkable; you will think this is a hard lesson to come thus far, not only to
be quiet, but to have a complacency in affliction. Prove. 16.6. In the house of
the righteous is much treasure, but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
Here Is a Scripture now that will show that a gracious heart has cause to say,
it is in a good condition what ever it be. In the house of the Righteous is
much Treasure, his house, what house? it may be a poor Cottage, perhaps he has
scarce a stool to sit on; perhaps he is fain to sit upon a stump of wood, a
piece of a block, instead of a stool; or perhaps he has scarce a bed to lie
upon, or a dish to eat in; yet says the Holy Ghost, In the house of the
righteous is much treasure: Let the righteous man be the poorest man in the
world: It may be there are some that have come and taken all the goods out of
his house for debt; perhaps his house is plundered and all is gone, yet still,
In the house of the righteous is much treasure; the righteous man can never be
brought to be so poor, to have his house rifled and spoiled, but there will
remain much treasure within, if he has but a dish or a spoon or any thing in
the world in his house, there will be much treasure; so long as he is there,
there is the presence of God and the blessing of God upon him, and therein is
much treasure; but in the revenues of the wicked there is trouble: There is
more treasure in the poorest bodies house, if he be godly, than in the house of
the greatest man in the world, that has his brave hangings, and brave wrought
beds, and chairs, and couches, and cupbords of plate, and the like; what ever
he has, he has not so much treasure in it, as in the house of the poorest
righteous soul; therefore in a verse, or two after my text, no mervail though
Paul (says he) was Content, you shall see in Phil. 4.18. But I have all, and
abound, I am full. I have all: Alas poor man what had Paul that could make him
say he had all; where was there ever man more afflicted than Paul was? many
times he had not tatters to hang about his body, to cover his nakedness, he
had not bread to eat, he was often in nakedness, and put in the stocks, and
whipped and cruelly used, yet I have all (says Paul) for all that. Yea you shall
have it in 2. Cor. 6.10. he professes there, That he did possess all things, as
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing, as poor, yet making many rich, as having
nothing, and yet possessing all things, but mark what he says, it is, As
having nothing, but it is Possessing all things. He does not say as possessing
all things, but possessing all things; it is very little I have in the world,
but yet possessing all things: So that you see a Christian has cause to take
complacency in Gods hand, whatsoever his hand be.

The Eight thing in Contentment it is [In Gods dispose] Submitting to and
taking complacency in Gods dispose. That is, the soul that has learned this
lesson of Contentment, looks up to God in all things; looks not down to the
instruments or the means, as such a man did it, and it was unreasonablenesse of
such and such instruments, and the like barbarous usage of such and such; but
looks up to God; a contented heart looks to Gods dispose, and submits to Gods
dispose, that is, sees the wisdom of God in all, in his submission sees his
soveraignity, but that that makes him take complacency, it is Gods wisdom; the
Lord knows how to order things better than I, the Lord sees further tha^ I do,
I see things but at present, but the Lord sees a great whil hence, and how do I
know but had it not been for this affliction, I had been undone? I know that
the love of God may as well stand with an afflicted estate, as with a
prosperous estate; and such kind of reasonings there are in a contented spirit,
submitting unto the dispose of God.

The last thing is, This is in [ every condition,] It may be in some things you
could be content: You shall have many will say, if my affliction were but as
the affliction of such a one I could be content, yea but it must be in the
present affliction that is upon you. We use to say, There is a great deal of
deceit in Universals; in the general, come to any man or woman and say Will not
you be content with Gods dispose? Yes say they God forbid but we should submit
to Gods hand what ever it be; you say thus in the general, it is an easy
matter to learn this lesson, but when it comes to the particular, when the
cross comes sore indeed, when it striks you in the heaviest cross that you
think could befall you, what says your heart now? Can you in every condition
be content not only for the matter, but for the time, that is to be in such a
condition so long as God would have you, to be content to be at Gods time in
that condition, to have such an affliction so long as God would have the
affliction abide upon you, to be willing to stay and not to come out of the
affliction no sooner than the Lord would have you come out of it? you are not
content in your condition else; to be content merely that I have such a hand of
God upon me, and not to stay under the hand of God, that is not to be content
under every condition, but when I can find my heart submitting to Gods dispose
in such particular afflictions that are very hard, and very grievous, and yet
my heart is quiet, here is one that has learned the lesson of Contentment:
Contentment, it is the inward, quiet, gracious frame of spirit, freely
submitting to and taking complacency in Gods dispose in every condition: That
is the description. Now in this there has been Nine several things opened.

1 First, That Contentment is a heart-work within the soul. 2 Secondly, It is
the quieting of the heart. 3 Thirdly, It is the frame of the spirit. 4
Fourthly, It is a gracious frame. 5 Fifthly, It is the free working of this
gracious frame. 6 Sixthly, There is in it a submission to God, sending the soul
under God. 7 Seventhly, There is a taking complacency in the hand of God. 8
Eighthly, All to Gods dispose. 9 Ninthly, In every condition, every condition
though never so hard, though continue never so long: Now those of you that have
learned to be Content, have learned to attain unto these several things; the
very opening of these things I hope may so far work upon your hearts as, First,
That you may lay your hands upon your hearts upon this that has been said, the
very telling of you what the lesson is, I fay may cause you to lay your hands
upon your hearts, and say, Lord I see there is more in Christian Contentation
than I thought there was, and I have been far from learning this lesson, I
indeed have learned but my A B C in this lesson of Contentment, I am but in the
lower form in Christ's school if I am in it at all; but these we shall speak
too more afterward; but the special thing I aimed at in the opening of this
point, is to show how great a Mystery there is in Christian Contentment; and
how many several lessons are to be learned, that we may come to attain to this
Heavenly disposition, that Saint Paul did attain too.

SERMON II.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. Stepney. Aug. 3. 1645.
For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.


WE have made entrance (you may remember) into the Argument of Christian
Contentment. And have opened the words, and showed you what this Christian
Contentation is; that it is, The inward, quiet, gracious frame of Spirit,
freely submitting too, and taking Complacency in Gods dispose in every
condition. And therein came to this last thing, [ In every condition] Now we
shall a little in large that, and so proceed:

1 Submitting to God in what ever Affliction befalls us: for the kind.

2 For the time and continuance of the Affliction.

3 For the variety and changes of Affliction: Let them be what they will, yet
there must be a submitting to Gods dispose in every condition.

First for the kind, Many men and women will in the general say, that they must
submit to God in affliction; I suppose now if you should come from one end of
this Congregation to another, and speak to every soul thus; Would not you
submit to Gods dispose, in what ever condition he should dispose of you too;
you would say, God forbid it should be otherwise, but we use to say, There is a
great deal of deceit in generals. In general you would submit to any thing: but
what if it be in this and that particular, that is most cross to you? Then any
thing but that: we are usually apt to think that any condition is better than
the condition that God does dispose us too, now here is not Contentment; it
should not be only to any condition in general, but for the kind of the
affliction, if it be that which is most cross to you. God (it may be) striks
you in your Child, Oh if it had been in my Estate says one, I should be
content; perhaps he striks you in your Match, Oh says he I had rather have
been stricken in my health; and if he had struck you in your health, Oh then if
it had been in my trading I would not have cared; but we must not be our own
carvers, what particular afflictions God shall dispose us to, there must be
Contentment in them.

Secondly, There must be a submission to God in every affliction, for the time
and continuance of the affliction. It may be says one I could submit and be
content, but this affliction has been upon me a long time, a quarter of a
year, a year, diverse years, and I know not how to yield and submit to it, my
patience is even worn and broke; yea it may be it is a spiritual affliction,
you could submit to God you say in any outward affliction, but not in a
soul-affliction, or if it were an affliction upon the soul, trouble upon the
heart, if it were the withdrawing of Gods face, yet if this had been but for a
little time I could submit; but seeking of God so long a time and yet God does
not appear, Oh how shall I bear this! We must not be our own disposers for the
time of deliverance no more than the kind and way of deliverance, and I will
give you a Scripture or two about this; That we are to submit unto God for the
time as well as the kind, in the latter end of the 1. Chap. of Ezekiel. When I saw
it I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke, (the Prophet was
cast down upon his face, but how long must he lie upon his face) And he said
unto me, Son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee, and the
Spirit entered into me, when he spoke unto me and set me upon my feet. Ezekiel
was cast down upon his face, and there he must lie till God bid him stand up,
yea and not only so, but till Gods Spirit came into him to enable him to stand
up: So when God casts us down, we must be content to lie till God bid us stand
up, and Gods Spirit enter into us to enable us to stand up. So you know Noah he
was put into the Ark, certainly he knew there was much affliction in the Ark,
having all kind of creatures shut up with him for twelve months together, it
was a mighty thing, yet God shutting him up (though the waters were assuaged)
Noah was not to come out of the Ark til God bid him: So though we be shut up in
great afflictions, and we may think there may be this and that and the other
means to come out of that affliction, yet till God does open the door we should
be willing to stay; God has put us in, and God is to bring us out: As we read
in the Acts, of Paul, when they had shut him in Prison and would have sent for
him out; Nay, says Paul they shut us in, let them come and fetch us out: So in
a holy gracious way should a soul say, Well, this affliction that I am brought
into, it is by the hand of God, and I am content to be here till God brings me
out himself. God does require it at our hands, that we should not be willing to
come out till he comes and fetches us out. In Josh. 4.10. you have a notable
history there that may very well serve our purpose; we read of the Priests,
that the Priests bear the Ark and stood in the midst of Jordan; you know when
the children of Israel went into the Land of Canaan they went through the River
of Jordan: Now the going through the river Jordan was a very dangerous thing,
only God bad them to go, they might have been afraid that the water might have
come in upon them: but mark, it is said, The Priest that bear the Ark stood in
the midst of Jordan till every thing was finished that the Lord commanded
Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua,
and the people hasted and passed over: and it came to pass when all the people
were clean passed over, that the Ark of the Lord passed over, and the Priests
in the presence of the people. Now it was Gods dispose that all the people
should pass over first, that they should be safe upon the land; but the
Priests they must stand still till all the people be passed over, and then they
must have leave to go, but they must stay till God would have them go, stay in
all that danger; for certainly in reason and sense there was a great deal of
danger in staying: for the text says, the people hasted over, but the Priests
they must stay till the people be gone, stay til God calls them out from that
place of danger; and so many times it does prove that God is pleased to dispose
of things so that the Ministers must stay longer in danger than the people, and
Magistrates and those in public place, which should make people to be
satisfied and contented with a lower condition that God has put them into:
Though your condition be low, yet you are not in that danger that those are in
that are in a higher condition; God calls them in public place to stand longer
in the gap and place of danger than other people, but we must be content to
stay even in Jordan till the Lord shall be pleased to call us out.

And then for the variety of our condition, we must be content with the
particular affliction, and the time and all the circumstances about the
affliction; for sometimes the circumstances are greater afflictions than the
afflictions themselves: And for the variety, if God will exercise us with
various afflictions one after another: As that has been very observable even
of late, that many that have been plundered and come away, afterward have
fallen sick and died: They have fled for their lives and afterward the plague
has come among them, and if not that affliction it may be some other
affliction, it is very rare that one affliction comes alone, commonly
afflictions are not single things but they come one upon the neck of another;
it may be God strikes one in his estate, then in his body, then in his name,
wife or child or dear friend, and so it comes in a various way it is the way of
God ordinarily (you may find it by experience) that seldom one affliction comes
alone, now this is hard when one affliction follows after another, when there
is a variety of afflictions, when there is a mighty change in a condition, up
and down, this way, and that way; there indeed is the trial of a Christian;
there must be submission to Gods dispose in them. I remember it is said even of
Cato that was a Heathen, that no man saw him to be changed, though he lived in
a time when the Commonwealth was so often changed, yet it is said of him, he
was the same still though his condition was changed, and he ran through variety
of conditions. Oh that it could be said so of many Christians, that though
their conditions be changed yet that nobody could see them changed, they are
the same. Look what gracious sweet and holy temper they were in before, that
they are in still: thus we are to submit to the dispose of God in every
condition.

Obj. But you will say, This that you speak of is good indeed if we could
attain to it, but is it possible for one to attain to this?

Answer. It is if you get skill in the Art of it, you may attain to it, and it
will prove to be no such difficult thing to you neither, if you understand but
the mystery of it; as there is many things that men do in their callings, that
if a country man comes and sees, he thinks it a mighty hard thing, and that he
should never be able to do it, but that is because he understands not the art of
it, there is a turning of the hand so as you may do it with ease. Now that is
the business of this exercise, to open unto you the art and mystery of
Contentment: What way a Christian comes to Contentment, there is a great
Mystery and art in it, by that has been opened to you there will appear some
mystery and art, as that a man should be content with his affliction and yet
thoroughly sensible of his affliction too, to be thoroughly sensible of an
affliction, and to endeavor the removing of it by all lawful means, and yet to
be content, there is a mystery in that, how to join these two together to be
sensible of an affliction as much as that man or woman that is not content, I
am sensible of it as fully as they, and I seek ways to be delivered from it as
well as they, and yet still my heart abides content, this is I say a mystery
that is very hard to be understood by a carnal heart; but grace does teach such
a mixture, does teach us how to make a mixture of sorrow and a mixture of joy
together; and that makes Contentment, the mingling of joy and sorrow, of
gracious joy and gracious sorrow together, grace teaches us how to moderate and
to order an affliction so as there shall be a sense of it, and yet for all that
Contentment under it.

There are diverse things further for the opening of the Mystery of Contentment

The First Thing therefore is this, To show that there is a great mystery in
it. One that is contented in a Christian way it may be said of him that he is
the most contented man in the world, and yet the most unsatisfied man in the
world, these two together must needs be mysterious, I say a contented man as he
is the most contented so he is the most unsatisfied of any man in the world.
You never learned the mystery of contentment except it may be said of you that
as you are the most contented man so you are the most unsatisfied man in the
world.

You will say how is that? A man that has learned the art of Contentment is
the most contented with any low condition that he has in the world, and yet he
cannot be satisfied with the enjoyment of all the world, and yet he is
contented if he has but a crust, but bread and water, that is if God disposes
of him for the things of the world to have but bread and water for his present
condition, he can be satisfied with Gods dispose in that, yet if God should
give unto him Kingdoms and Empiers, all the world to rule, if he should give it
him for his portion he would not be satisfied with that, here is the mystery of
it, though his heart be so enlarged as the enjoyment of all the world and ten
thousand worlds cannot satisfy him for his portion; yet he has a heart
quieted under Gods dispose, if he gives him but bread and water, to join these
two together, this must needs be a great art and mystery. Though he be
contented with God in a little, yet those things that would content other men
will not content him; The men of the world they seek after estates, and think
if they had thus much, and thus much, they would be content, they aim at no
great matters; but if I had (perhaps some man thinks) but two or three hundred
a year, then I should be well enough; If I had but a hundred a year, or a
thousand a year (says another) then I should be satisfied: but says a
gracious heart, If he had ten hundred thousand times so much a year, it would
not satisfy him, if he had the quintescence of all the excellencies of all the
creatures in the world, it could not satisfy him, and yet this man can sing,
and be merry, and joyful when he has but a crust of bread and a little water
in the world: Surely Religion is a great mystery, great is the mystery of
godliness, not only in the Doctrinal part of it, but in the Practical part of
it also. Godliness teaches us this mystery, Not to be satisfied with all the
world for our portion, and yet to be content with the meanest condition in
which we are. As Luther, when he had great gifts sent him from Dukes and
Princes, he refused it, and says he, I did vehemently protest God should not
put me off so; it is not that which will content me: A little in the world will
content a Christian for his passage: Mark, here lies the Mystery of it, A
little in the world will Content a Christian for his passage, but all the world
and ten thousand times more will not Content a Christian for his portion: Now a
carnal heart will be Content with these things of the world for his portion;
and there is the differnce between a Carnal heart and a Gracious heart: But
says a gracious heart, Lord do with me what thou will for my passage through
this world, I will be content with that, but I cannot be content with all the
world for my portion: so there is the mystery of true Contentation. A contented
man though he be most contented with the least things in the world; yet he is
the most unsatisfied man that lives in the world. That Soul that is capable of
God, can be filled with nothing else but God; nothing but God can fill a soul
that is capable of God: though a gracious heart knows that it is capable of
God, and was made for God; Carnal hearts think of no reference to God, but a
gracious heart being enlarged to be capable of God, and enjoying somewhat of
him, nothing in the world can fill a gracious heart, it must be only God
himself; and therefore you shall observe, That let God give what he will to a
gracious heart, a heart that is godly, except he gives Himself, it will not do;
a godly heart will not only have the mercy, but the God of that mercy as well
as its self, and then a little matter is enough in the world, so be it he has
the God of that mercy he does enjoy; In Phil. 4.7.9. I shall need go no further
to show a notable Scripture for this, Compare verse. 7. with verse. 9. And the
peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds
through Jesus Christ. The peace of God shall keep your hearts. Then in verse. 9.
Those things which ye have both learned and received, and heard, and seen in
me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you, The peace of God shall keep
you, and the God of peace shall be with you. This is that that I would observe
from this Text, That the peace of God is not enough to a gracious heart except
it may have the God of that peace. A carnal heart could be satisfied if he
might but have outward peace, though it be not the peace of God; peace in the
State and his trading would satisfy him: But mark how a Godly heart goes
beyond a Carnal, all outward peace is not enough, but I must have the peace of
God: But suppose you have the peace of God, Will not that quiet you? No, I must
have the God of peace, as the peace of God so the God of peace, that is, I must
enjoy that God that gives me the peace, I must have the cause as well as the
effect; I must see from whence my peace comes, and enjoy the fountain of my
peace, as well as the stream of my peace; and so in other mercies, have I
health from God, I must have the God of my health to be my portion, or else I
am not satisfied: It is not life, but the God of my life; it is not riches, but
the God of those riches that I must have, the God of my preservation, as well
as my preservation; a gracious heart is not satisfied without this, To have the
God of the mercy, as well as the mercy. In Psalm. 73.25. Whom have I in heaven
but Thee, and there is none upon the earth that I desire besides thee. It is
nothing in heaven or earth, can satisfy me, but thy self; if God give thee not
only earth but heaven, that thou should rule over Sun, Moon, and stars, and
have the rule over the highest of the sons of men, it would not be enough to
satisfy thee, except thou hadest God himself; There lies the first mystery of
Contentment; and truly a contented man, though he be the most contented man in
the world, yet he is the most unsatisfied man in the world, that is, Those
things that will satisfy the world, will not satisfy him.

Secondly, There is this Mystery in Christian Contentation. A Christian comes
to Contentment, not so much by way of addition, as by way of Substraction, that
is his way of Contentment, and that is a way that the world has no skill in. I
open it thus, Not so much by the adding to what he would have, or to what he
has, not by adding more to his condition, but rather by substracting of his
desires, and so to make his desires and conditon to be even and equal. A carnal
heart knows no way to be Contented but this, I have such and such an estate,
and if I had this added to it, and the other comfort added that now I have not,
then I should be Contented; it may be I have lost my estate, if I could have
but that given to me so as to make up my loss, then I should be a contented
man: But now Contentmet does not come in that way, it comes not in I say by the
adding to what thou want, but by the substracting of thy desires; it is all
one to a Christian, either that I may get up unto what I would have, or get my
desires down to what I have; either that I may attain to what I do desire, or
bring down my desires to what I have already attained; my estate is the same,
for it is as suitable to me to bring my desire down to my condition, as it is to
raise up my condition to my desire. Now I say a heart that has no grace, and
is not instructed in this Mystery of Contentment, knows no way to get
Contentment, but to have his estate raised up to his desires; but the other
has another way to Contentment, that is, He can bring his desires down to his
estate, and so he does attain to his Contentment. So the Lord fashions the
hearts of the Children of men: Now if the heart of a man be fashioned to his
condition, he may have as much contentment as if his condition be fashioned to
his heart; some men have a mighty large heart, but they have a straight
condition, and they can never have Contentment when their hearts are big and
their condition is little; but now though a man cannot bring his condition to
be as big as his heart, yet if he can bring his heart to be as little as his
condition, to bring them even, from thence is Contentment. The world is
infinitely deceived in this, To think that Contentment lies in having more than
they have; here lies the bottom and root of all Contentment, when there is an
evennesse and proportion between our hearts and our conditions; and that is the
reason that many that are godly men that are in a low condition live more sweet
and comfortable lives than those that are richer: Contentment is not always
clothed with silk, and purple, and velvets, but Contentment is sometimes in a
russet sure, in a mean condition as well as in a higher; and many men that
sometimes have had great estates, and God has brought them into a lower
condition, they have had more Contentment in that condition than the other: Now
how can that possible be? Thus easily, For if you did but understand the root
of Contentment, it consists in the sutablenesse and proportion of the spirit of
a man to his estate, and the evenness, when one end is not longer and bigger
than another; the heart is contented, there is comfort in that condition; now
let God give a man never so great riches, yet if the Lord gives him up to the
pride of his heart, he will never be contented: But now, let God bring any one
into a mean condition, and then let God but fashion and suit his heart to that
condition and he will be content. As now in a man's going, Suppose a man had a
mighty long leg, and his other leg were short, why though one of his legs be
longer than ordinary yet he could not go so well as a man that has both his
legs shorter than he. I compare a long leg, when one is longer than another, to
a man that has a high condition, and is very rich, and a great man in the
world, but he has a great proud heart too, and that is longer and larger than
his condition: now this man cannot but be troubled in his condition: Now
another man that is in a mean condition, his condition is low, and his heart is
low too; so that his heart and his condition is both even together, and this
man goes on with more ease abundantly than the other does: So that now a
gracious heart works after this manner, The Lord has been pleased to bring
down my condition, now if the Lord bring down my heart and make it even with my
condition, then I am well enough: And so when God brings down his condition, he
does not so much labor to raise up his condition again as to bring down his
heart to his condition: The Heathens themselves they had a little glimps of
this; they could say, That the best riches that is, it is the poverty of
desires: that is a speech of a Heathen, that is, If a man or woman have their
desires cut short, and have no large desires, that man and woman they are rich
when they can bring their desires to be but low: So this is the Art of
Contentment. Not to seek to add to our conditions, but to substract from our
desires. Another has this, The way to be rich, says he, it is not by
increasing of wealth, but by diminishing of our desires; for certainly that man
or woman is a rich man or woman that has their desires satisfied; now a
contented man has his desires satisfied, God satisfies his desires, that is,
all considered, he is satisfied in his condition for the present to be the best
condition, and so he comes to this Contentment by way of Substraction, and not
Addition.

The Third thing in the Art of Contentment is this, A Christian comes to
Contentment, not so much by getting off his burden that is upon him, as by the
adding another burden to him; this is a way that flesh and blood has little
skilll in. You will say how is this? In this manner, art thou afflicted, and is
there a great load and burden upon thee by reason of thy affliction? thou
think there is no way in the world to get Contentment, but, O that this
burden were but off, O it is a heavy load, and few know what a burden I have!
What do thou think there is no way for the Contentment of thy spirit but
this getting off thy burden? O thou art deceived, the way of Contentment is to
add another burden, that is, labor to load and burden thy heart with thy sin,
and the heaviour the burden of thy sin is to thy heart, the lighter will the
burden of thy affliction be to thy soul, and so shall thou come to be Content:
If thy burden were lightened that would content thee, thou think there is no
way to lighten it but to get it off, but thou art deceived, for if thou can
get thy heart to be more burdened with thy sin; thou will be less burdened
with thy afflictions: You will say this is a strange way, for a man or woman to
get ease to their condition, when they are burdened, to lay a greater burden
upon them? You think there is no other way when you are afflicted, but to be
jolly and merry, and get into company, Oh no, you are deceived, your burden
will come again, alas this is a poor way to get his spirit quieted, poor man,
the burden will be upon him again; but if thou would have thy burden light,
if thou can get alone and examine thy heart for thy sin, and charge thy soul
with thy s^n: if thy burden be in thy estate, for the abuse of it, or if it be
a burden upon thy body, for the abuse of thy health, and strength, and the
abuse of any mercies that now the Lord has taken away from thee, thou have not
honored God with those mercies that thou have had, but thou have walked
wantonly and carelessly; and so fall a bemoning thy s^n before the Lord, and
thou shall quickly find the burden of thy affliction to be lighter than it was
before; do but try this piece of skill and art, to get your souls contented
with any low condition that God puts you into; many times in a family, when any
affliction befalls them, Oh what a deal of coffeehouse is there between man
and wife, if crossed in their estates at Land, or ill news from Sea, or those
that they trusted are broke and the like, and perhaps somewhat in the family
falls cross between man and wife, or in reference to the children or servants,
and there is nothing but brabling and discontent among them, now they many
times are burdened with their own discontent, and perhaps will say one to
another, this life is very uncomfortable for us to live thus discontented so as
we do; but have you ever tried this way, the husband and the wife? have you
ever got alone and said, Come, Oh let us go and humble our souls before God
together, let us go into our chamber and humble our souls before God for our
sin, whereby we have abused those mercies that God has taken away from us, and
we have provoked God against us, Oh let us charge our selves with our sin, and
be humbled before the Lord together, have you tried such a way as this is? Oh
you would find the cloud would be taken away, and the Sun would shine in upon
you, and you would have a great deal more Conntentment than ever yet you had:
If a man's estate be broken, either by plunderers, or any other way; now how
shall this man have Contentment? how? By the breaking of his heart, God has
broken thy estate, Oh seek to him for the breaking of thy heart likewise;
Indeed a broken estate, and a whole heart, a hard heart, will not join
together, there will be no Contentment; but a broken estate, and a broken
heart, will so suit together, as there will be more Contentment than there was
before; add therefore to the breaking of thy estate, the breaking of thy heart
what thou can, and that is the way to be Contented in a Christian manner,
which is the Third Mystery in Christian Contentation.

The fourth thing is this, It is not so much the removing of the affliction
that is upon us, as the changing of the affliction, the Metamorphosing of the
affliction, when it is quite turned and changed into another thing: I mean in
regard of the use of it, though for the matter the affliction abide still. The
way of Contentment to a carnal heart it is only the removing of the affliction,
Oh that it may be gone; no but says a gracious heart, God has taught me a way
for Contentment though the affliction shall continue still for the matter of
it; but there is a virtue of grace to turn this affliction into good; it takes
away but only the sting and poison of it; As now, Suppose poverty, A man's
estate is lost; well, is there no way to be contented till your estate be made
up again? Till your poverty be removed? Yes, certainly Christianity would teach
Contentment, though poverty continues yet it will teach you how to turn your
poverty to spiritual riches; that you shall be poor still for your outward
estate; but this shall be altered, whereas before it was once a natural evil to
you, it comes now to be turned into a spiritual benefit to you; and so you come
to be content. It is a speech of Ambrose, Even poverty it is self it is riches
unto holy men: Godly men do make their poverty turn to be riches, they get more
riches out of their poverty then ever they get out of their revenues, out of
all their trading in this world they never had such incomes as they have had
out of their poverty; this a carnal heart will think strange that a man shall
make poverty to be the most gainful trade that ever he had in the world; I am
persuaded that many Christians have found it so, that they have got more good
by their poverty than ever they got by all their riches, you find it in
Scripture, therefore think not this strange that I am speaking of, you do not
find any one Godly man that came out of an affliction worse than when he came
into it, though for a while he was shaken, yet at last he was better for an
affliction; but a great many Godly men you find have been worse for their
prosperity, scarce one Godly man that you read in Scripture of but was worse
for prosperity (except Daniel and Nehemiah, I do not read of any hurt they got
by their prosperity that they had) scarce (I think) is any one example of any
Godly man, but was rather worse for his prosperity than better; so that you see
it is no such strange thing, neither to one that is gracious that they shall get
good by their affliction: Luther has such an expression in his Comment upon
the 5. Chap. of the Galatians; in the 17. verse in his Comment upon that place
says, A Christian becomes a mighty worker and a wonderful creator, that is
(says he) to create out of heaviness joy, out of terror comfort, out of sin
righteousness, out of death life, and brings light out of darkness. It was
Gods prerogative and great power, his creating power to command the light to
shine out of darkness; now a Christian is partaker of the divine nature, so
the scripture says, Grace it is part of the Divine Nature, and being part of
the Divine Nature it has an impression of Gods Omnipotent power that is, to
create light out of darkensse, to being good out of evil, now by this way a
Christian comes to be content. God has given a Christian such a virtue, as can
turn affliction into mercyes, can turn darkness into light; if a man had the
power that Christ had when the water pots were filled, he could by a word turn
the water into wine; if you that have nothing but water to drink, yet if you
had a power to turn it into wine then you may be contented: Certainly a
Christian has received this power from God, to work thus miraculously; it is
the nature of grace to turn water into wine, that is, to turn the water of your
affliction, into the wine of heavenly consolation. If you understand this in a
carnal way, I know it will be rediculous for a Minister to speak thus before
you, and many carnal people are ready to make such expressions as these to be
rediculous, understanding them in a carnal way: Just as Nicodemus in the 3. of
John, What can a man be born when he is old, can be enter the second time into
his mothers womb and be born? So when we speak of grace that it can turn water
into wine, and turn poverty into riches, and make poverty a gainful trade,
says a carnal heart, Let them have that trade if they will, and let them have
water to drink, and see if they can turn it into wine: Oh take heed thou
speak not in a scornful way of the ways of God; grace has the power to
turn afflictions into mercies. Two men shall have one affliction, and to one
man it shall be as gall and wormwood, and it shall be wine, and honey, and
delightfulness, and joy, and advantage, and riches, to another. This is the
mystery of Contentment, not so much by removing the evil, as by Metamorphosing
the evil by changing the evil into good.

The Fifth thing is this, A Christain comes to this Contentment by making up
the wants of his condition, by the performance of the work of his condition.
This is the way of Contentment. There is such a condition that I am in, many
wants, I want this and the other comfort, well, how shall I come to be
satisfied and content? A carnal heart thinks this, I must have my wants made up
or else it is impossible that I should be content: No, but says a gracious
heart, What is the duty of the condition God has put me into? Indeed my
condition is changed, I was not long since in a prosperous condition, but God
has changed my condition: the Lord has called me no more Naomi, but Marah;
Now what am I to do? what can I think now, are those duties that God requires
of me in the condition that he has now put me into? and let me put forth my
strength, in the performance of the duties of my present condition. Others they
spend their thoughts in those things that shall disturb and disquiet them, and
so they grow more and more discontented; yea, but let me spend my thoughts in
thinking what my duty is, what is the duty of my present condition which I am
in: O says a man whose condition is changed and he has lost his estate, Had I
but my estate as I had heretofore, how would I use it to his glory! But God
has made me to see that I did not honor him with my estate as I ought to have
done: Oh had I it again, I would do better than ever I did! but this may be but
a temptation, therefore you should rather think, What does God require of me in
the condition I am now brought into? And thou should labor to bring thy
heart to quiet and Contentnent, by setting thy soul on work about the duties of
thy present condition: And the truth is, I know nothing more available for the
quieting of a Christian Soul, and getting Contentment then this, The setting
thy heart on work about the duties of the very present condition that now thou
art in, and take heed of thy thoughts about other conditions as a mere
temptation. I cannot compare the folly of men and women that think to get
Contentment with their musing about other conditions better than to the way of
Children; perhaps they are gotten upon a hill, and they look a good way off and
see another hill, and they think if they were on the top of that, then they
were able to touch the clouds with their fingers; but when they are on the top
of that hill; alas then they are as far from the clouds, as they were before:
So it is with many that think, If they were in such a condition, then I should
have Contentment; and perhaps they get into that condition, then they are as
far from Contentment as before: But then they think if they were in another
condition, they would be contented, and then when they have got into that
condition, they are still as far from Contentment as before. No, no, let me
consider what is the duty of my present condition, and content my heart with
this, and say, Well, though I am in a low condition, yet I am serving the
counsels of God in that condition wherein I am; it is the counsel of God that
has brought me into this condition that I am in, and I desire to serve the
counsel of God in that condition. There is a notable Scripture concerning
David, it is said of him, That he served his Generation, after David had served
his Generation according to the will of God, then he slept. It is a Speech of
Paul concerning him, in Act. 13.36. So it is in your books, After he had served
his generation according to the will of God: But now the word that is
translated will, it is the counsel of God, and so it may be translated as
well, That after David in his generation had served Gods counsel, then he fell
asleep. We ordinarily take the words thus, That David served his generation;
that is, He did the work of his generation, that is to serve a man's generation.
But it is more plain, if you read it thus, After David in his generation had
served the Counsel of God, then David fell asleep. O that should be the care
of a Christian to serve out Gods Counsels. What is the Counsel of God? The
condition that I am in, God does put me into it by his own Counsel, the Counsel
of his own will; Now I must serve Gods Counsel in my generation, look what is
the Counsel of God in my condition, I must look to serve that; and so I shall
have my heart quieted for the present, and shall live and die peaceably, and
comfortably, if I be careful to serve Gods Counsel.

A Sixth thing in the mystery of Contentment is this, A gracious heart is
contented by the melting of his will and desires into Gods will and desires, by
this means he gets Contentment; and this is a mystery to a carnal heart. It is
not by having his own desires satisfied as before, but by melting his will and
desires into Gods will: So that he comes to have (in one sense) his desires
satisfied though he has not the thing that before he did desire, yet he comes
to be satisfied in this, because he makes his will to be all one with Gods
will. This is a little higher degree than submitting to the will of God. You
all say, you should submit to Gods will; but a Christian has gotten beyond
this; that is, he can make Gods will and his to be the same: So it is said of
believers, that they are joined to the Lord, and are one spirit, that is, look
what Gods will is, I do not only see reason to submit to it, but Gods will is
my will: When the soul can make over (as it were) it is will to God, it must
needs then have Contentment. Others would fain get the thing they do desire, O
but says a gracious heart, that that God would have, I would have too, I will
not only yield to it, but I would have it too; a gracious heart has learned
this art, not only to make the commanding will of God to be it is own will, that
is, what God commands me to do I will do it, but to make the providential will
of God, and the opperative will of God to be his will too: God commands this
thing, which perhaps you that are Christians may have some skill in, but
whatsoever God works, you must will as well as what God commands, you must make
Gods providential will, and his opperative will, as well your will, as Gods
will, and so you must come to Contentment; here a Christian makes over his will
to God, and in making over his will to God, he has no other will but only
Gods; as suppose a man makes over his debt to another man, if that man that I
owe the debt to, be satisfied and contented, I am satisfied because I have made
it over to him, and I need not be discontented and say, my debt is not paid,
and I am not satisfied, yes, you are satisfied, for he that you made over your
debt to, he is satisfied: Just thus it is for all the world between God and a
Christian, a Christian heart makes over his will to God, now then if Gods will
be satisfied, then I am satisfied, for I have then no will of mine own, it is
melted into the will of God, for so that is the excellency of grace, grace does
not only subject the will to God, but it does melt the will into Gods will, so
that they are now but one will; what a sweet satisfaction must the soul have
then in this condition, when all is made over to God; You will say this is
hard? I will express it a little more: A gracious heart must needs have
satisfaction this way, because godliness does teach him this, to see that his
good is more in God than in himself, the good of my life, and comforts, and my
happiness, and my glory, and my riches is more in God than it is in my self;
(that perhaps we may speak too further, when we come to the lessons that are to
be learned.) But upon this it is, that a gracious heart has Contentment, he
does melt his will into Gods, for says he, if God have glory, I have glory,
Gods glory is my glory, and therefore Gods will is mine, if God have riches,
then I have riches, if God be magnified, then I am magnified, if God be
satisfied, then I am satisfied, Gods wisdom and holiness is mine, and
therefore his will must needs be mine, and my will must needs be his; here is
the art of a Christians Contentment, he melts his will into the will of God,
and makes over his will to God, Oh Lord thou shall choose our inheritance for
us. Psalm. 73.

The Seventh thing in the Art of Contentment is this, The Mystery consists not
so much by bringing any thing without, to make my condition more comfortable,
as to purge out something that is within. The men of the world now, when they
would have Contentment, and want any thing, Oh they must have somewhat from
without to content them; but says a godly man, let me get something out that is
in already, and then I shall come to Contentment; As suppose a man has an
aguish humor that makes his drink taste bitter, now says he, You must put
some sugar into my drink, and his wife puts in some, and yet the drink tastes
bitter, Why? Because the bitterness comes from a bitter choleric humor
within; but let the Physician come and give him a bitter potion to purge out
the bitterness that is within, and then he can taste his drink well enough:
Just thus it is with the men of the world, Oh such a condition is bitter, and
if I could have such and such a mercy added, to this mercy, then it would be
sweet; now if God should put a spoonful or two of sugar in, it would be bitter
still. But the way to Contentment is to purge out thy lusts and bitter humors.
Jam. 4.1. From whence are wars, and strifs, are they not from your lusts that
are within you? they are not so much from things without, but from within; as
sometimes I have said, it is not all the storms that are abroad that can make
an earthquake, but the vapors that are got within: and so if those lusts that
are within, in thy heart, if they were got out, thy condition would be a
contented condition. These are the mysterious ways of godliness, that the men
of the world never think of; when did thou ever think of such a way as this
is, for to go and purge out the distempers of thy heart that are within: Here
are Seven particulars now named, there were a great many more that I had
thought of, and now without the understanding of these things, and the practice
of them, you will never come to a true Contentation in your way, Oh you will be
bunglers in this trade of Christianity; but the right perceiving of these
things, will help you to be instructed in it as in a Mystery.

SERMON III.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


THE Mystery of Contentment will appear yet further. A gracious heart gets
Contentment in a mysterious way, a way that the world is not aquainted with

Eighthly, He lives upon the dew of Gods blessing. It Is the similitude of one
Adrian Junius setting out a Contented man by a Grasshopper, leaping and skipping
up and down, that lives upon the dew, and he has this motto, I am content with
what I have, and hope for better. A grasshopper does not live upon the grass as
other things do, you cannot know what it feeds upon, other things though as
little as grashppers, yet feed upon seeds or little flies, and such things, but
the grasshopper, you know not what it feeds upon. So a Christian can get food
that the world knows not of, in a secret way is a Christian fed by the dew of
the blessing of God, a poor man or woman that has but a little which has
grace, lives a more contented life than his rich neighbor that has a great
deal coming in, we find it so ordinarily, so that though they have but a
little, yet they have a secret blessing of God going in it, that they are not
able to express to any other man; if you would come to them and say; How comes
it that you live so comfortably as you do? they are not able to tell you what
they have, but they find there is a sweetness in what they do enjoy, and they
know this by experience that they never had such sweetness in former times,
that though they had more plenty in former times than now they have, yet they
know they had not such sweetness; but how this comes they cannot tell; and we
may show some particulars, even in that godly men do enjoy, that make their
condition to be sweet.

As now, Take these four or five particulars that godly men finds Contentment
in what he has, though it be never so little.

1 Because in what he has, he has the love of God, he has Gods love to him
in what he has: If a King should send a piece of meat from his own table, it
is a great deal more comfortable to a Courrier than if he had twenty dishes at
ordinary allowance, if the King send but any little thing and say, Go and carry
this to such a man as a token of my love, Oh how delightful is that unto him?
are your husbands at Sea and send you a token of their love, it is more than
forty times so much that you have in your houses already: Every good thing the
people of God do enjoy, they enjoy it in Gods love, as a token of Gods love,
and coming from Gods eternal love unto them, and this must needs be very sweet
unto them.

2. What they have it is sanctified to them for good; Other men have what they
enjoy in a way of common providence, but the Saints in a special way; Others
have what they have and there is all, they have meat, and drink, and houses,
and clothes, and money and that is all. But a gracious heart finds contentment
in this, I have it, and I have a sanctified use of it too; I find God going
along with what I have to draw my heart nearer to him, and sanctify my heart
to him: If I find my heart drawn nearer to God by what I enjoy; it is more a
great deal than if I have it without any sanctifying my heart by it; there is a
secret dew that goes along with it, there is the dew of Gods love in it, and the
dew of sanctification.

3. A gracious heart what he has he has it upon free-cost, he is not like to
be called to pay for what he has: The difference between what a godly man
has; and a wicked man is in this: A godly man is as a child in an Inn; an
In-keeper has his child in his house, and the Father provides his diet, and
lodging, and what is fit for him; Now there comes a stranger, and the stranger
has dinner and supper provided, and lodging, but the stranger must pay for
all; it may be the child's fare is meaner than the fare of the stranger, the
stranger has boyld, and roast and baked; but he must pay for it, there must
come a reckoning for it. Just thus it is, many of Gods people have but mean
fare; but God as a father provides it, and it is on free-cost, and they must
not pay for what they have, it is paid for before; but the wicked in all their
pomp, and pride, and bravery, they have what they call for, but there must come
a reckoning for all, they must pay for all in the conclusion, and is it not
better to have a little upon free cost, than to come to have all to pay for?
Grace does show a man that what he has, he has it on free cost, from God as
from a Father, and therefore must needs be very sweet.

Fourthly, A godly man may very well be content, though he has but little, For
what he has he has it by right of Jesus Christ, by the purchase of Jesus
Christ, he has a right to it, another manner of right to what he has, than
any wicked man can have to what he has; a wicked man has these outward
things; I do not say they are usurpers of what they have, but they have a right
to it, and that before God, but how? it is a right by mere donation, that is,
God by his free bounty does give it to them; but the right that the Saints
have, it is a right of purchase, it is paid for, and it is their own, and they
may in a holy manner, and holy way, challenge whatsoever they have need of. We
cannot express the right of a holy man, the difference between his right, and
the right of the wicked more fully than by this similitude; a Malefactor that
is condemned to die, yet he has by favor granted to him his supper provided
over night, and you cannot say though the Malefactor has forfeited all his
right to all things, to every bit of bread, yet if he shall have a supper
granted to him he does not steal it, though all his right is forfeited by his
fault, after he is once condemned he has no right to any thing; so it is with
the wicked, they have forfeited all their right to all comforts in this world,
they are condemned by God as Malefactors and are going to execution; but if God
will in his bounty give them something to preserve them here in the world, they
cannot be said to be thieves or robbers: Now a man has granted to him a supper
over night before his execution, but is that like the supper that he was wont
to have in his own house, when he eat his own bread, and had his wife and
children about him? Oh a dish of green herbs at home would be a great deal
better than any dainties in such a supper as that is; but now a child of God
has not a right merely by donation, but what he has it is his own through the
purchase of Christ; every bit of bread that thou eatest, if thou be a godly
man or woman, Jesus Christ has bought it for thee, thou go to market and
buyest thy meat and drink with thy money, but know that before thou have bought
it, or paid money, Christ has bought it at the hand of God the Father with his
blood, thou have it at the hands of men for money, but Christ has bought it at
the hand of his Father by his blood: And certainly it is a great deal better
and sweeter now though it be but a little*

Fifthly, There Is another thing that shows the sweetness that there is in that
little that the Saints have, by which they come to have contentment, whereas
others cannot; that is, Every little that they have, it is but as an earnest
penny of all the glory that is reserved for them, it is given them by God, but
as the Forerunner of those eternal mercies that the Lord intends for them; now
if a man has but twelve pence given to him as an earnest penny for some great
possession that he must have; is not that better than if he had forty pounds
given unto him otherwise? So every comfort that the Saints have in this world,
it is an earnest penny to them of those eternal mercies that the Lord has
provided for them; as every affliction that the wicked have here it is but the
beginning of sorrows, and forerunner of those eternal sorrows that they are
like to have hereafter in Hell; so every comfort thou have is a forerunner of
those eternal mercies thou shall have with God in Heaven; not only the
consolations of Gods Spirit are the forerunners of those eternal comforts thou
shall have in Heaven; but when thou sit at thy Table, and rejoycest with
thy wife and children and friends, thou may look upon every one of those but
as a forerunner, yea the very earnest-penny of eternal life unto thee. Now
then if this be so, no marvel though a Christian be contented; (this is a
mystery to the wicked:) I have what I have out of the love of God, and I have
it sanctified to me by God, and I have it of free-cost from God by the purcase
of the blood of Jesus Christ, and I have it as a forerunner of those eternal
mercies that are reserved for me; and in this my soul rejoices, There Is a
secret dew of Gods goodness, and blessing upon him in his estate that others
have not; and by all this you may see the meaning of that Scripture, Prove.
16.8. Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues without right.
A man that has but a little, yet if he has it with righteousness, it is
better than a great deal without right; yea, better than the great revenues of
the wicked: so you have it in another Scripture; That Is the next Particular in
Christian Contentment; the mystery is in this, That he lives upon the dew of
Gods blessing, in all the good things that he does enjoy.

The Ninth thing wherein the mystery of Christian Contentment consists, is
this, Not only the good things that he has, he has the dew of Gods blessing
in them, and they are very sweet to him; but all the afflictions, all the evils
that do befall him he can see love in them all: And can enjoy the sweetness of
love in his afflictions, as well as in his mercies; yea the truth is, the
afflictions of Gods people comes from the same Eternal love that Jesus Christ
did come from. And that speech of Hierom, He is a happy man that is beaten when
the stroke is a stroke of love. All Gods strokes are strokes of love and mercy,
all Gods ways are mercy and truth, to those that fear him and love him, Psalm.
25.10. The ways of God, the ways of affliction, as well as the ways of
prosperity, are mercy and love to him. Grace gives a man an eye, a piercing ye
to pierce into the Councels of God, those Eternal Counsels of God for good unto
him, even in his afflictions, to see the love of God in every affliction as
well as in prosperity. Now this is a mystery to a carnal heart, they can see no
such thing, perhaps they think God loves them when he prospers them, and makes
them rich; but they think God loves them not when he does afflict them, that is
a mystery; but grace instructs men in that mystery, grace inables men to see
love in the very frowns of Gods face, and so comes to receive contentment.

In the Tenth place, A godly man has Contentment in the way of a mystery,
because as he sees all his afflictions come from the same love that Jesus
Christ did; so he sees them all sanctified in Jesus Christ, sanctified as a
Mediator; he sees (I say) all the sting and venom, and poison of them all to be
taken out by the virtue of Jesus Christ, the Mediator between God and Man: As
now for instance, Thus, a Christian when he would have Contentment falls a
working, what is my affliction? Is it poverty that God strikes me withal?
Jesus Christ had not a house to hide his head in, the Fowls of the air had
nests, and the Foxes had holes, but the Son of Man not a hole to hide his head
in: now my poverty is sanctified by Christ's poverty, I can see by faith the
curse and sting and venom of my poverty, taken out by the poverty of Jesus
Christ, Christ Jesus he was poor in this world to deliver me from the curse of
my poverty, that it should not be cursed unto me, then my poverty is not
afflictive, if I can be contented in such a condition. That is the way, not to
stand and repine, because I have not what others have, no, but I am poor, and
Christ was therefore poor that he might bless my poverty to me.

And so again, Am I disgraced, dishonored, is my good-name taken away? why
Jesus Christ he had dishonor put upon him, he was called Beelzebub, and a
Samaritan, and they said he had a Devil in him, all the foul aspersions that
could be were cast upon Jesus Christ, and this was for me, that I might have
the disgrace that is cast upon me to be sanctified unto me, whereas another man
his heart is overwhelmed with dishonor, and disgrace, and he goes this way to
work to get Conntetment; perhaps if you be spoken ill of, you have no other way
to ease and right your selves, but if they do rail upon you, you will rail upon
them again; and thus you think to ease your selves: Oh but a Christian has
another manner of way to ease himself, others rail and speak ill of me, but did
they not rail upon Jesus Christ, and speak ill of him? and what am I in
comparison of Christ? And the subjection of Christ to such an evil, it was for
me, that though such a thing should come upon me, I might know that the curse
of it is taken from me through Christ's subjection to that evil; thus a
Christian can be contented when any body speaks ill of him; now this is a
mystery to you to get Contentment after such a manner as this is: So if men
jeer and scoff at you, did they not do so to Jesus Christ? they jeered and
scoff't at him, and that when he was in his greatest extremity upon the Cross,
say they, Here Is the King of the Jews, and they bowed the knee, and said hail
King of the Jews, and put a Reed into his hand, and mocked him: now I get
Contentment in the midst of scorns and jeers, by considering that Christ was
scorned, and by acting faith upon that which Christ did suffer for me. So, am I
in great pain of my body? Jesus Christ had as great pain upon his body as I
have, though it is true he had not such kind of sicknesses as we have, but yet
he had as great pain and tortours in his body, and that that was deadly to him,
as well as any sickness is to us: the exercising of faith upon what Christ did
endure, that is the way to get Contentment in the midst of our pains: one lies
vexing and fretting, and cannot bear his pain, art thou a Christian? have thou
ever tried this way of getting contentment, to act thy faith upon all the pains
and sufferings that Jesus Christ did suffer? this would be the way of
Contentment, and a Christian gets contentment under pains after this manner:
sometimes one that is very godly and gracious, you shall have them lie under
grievous pains and extremities very cheerfully, and you wonder at it, this is
the way that he gets it, he gets it by acting his faith upon what pains Jesus
Christ did suffer, thou art afraid of death; the way to get Contentment, it is
by exercising thy faith upon the death of Jesus Christ; yea, it may be thou
have inward troubles in thy soul, and God withdraws himself from thee, but
still thy faith is to be exercised upon the sufferings that Jesus Christ
endured in his soul, he poured forth his soul before God, then when he sweat
drops of water and blood, he was in an Agony in his very Spirit, and he found
even God himself in a way to forsake him; now the acting thy faith upon Jesus
Christ thus, brings Contentment, and is not this a mystery to carnal hearts? a
gracious heart finds Contentment in a way of a mystery: no marvel though Saint
Paul says, I am instructed in a Mystery, to be contented in whatsoever
condition I am in.

In the Eleventh place, there is yet a further mystery (for this I hope you
will find a very useful point unto you) and you will see what a plain way
there is, (before we have done) for one that is skilled in Religion to get
Contentment, though it is hard for one that is carnal. I say the Eleventh
mystery in contentment is this, A gracious heart has contentment by fetching
strength from Jesus Christ, he is able to bear his burden by fetching strength
from another: now this is a riddle indeed, and it would be a rediculous thing
to be spoken of in the schools of Philosophers, to say, if there be a burden
upon you, you must fetch strength from another; indeed to have another to come
and stand under the burden, that way they would know, but that you shall be
strengthened by another strength, that is not near you to your outward view,
that they would think rediculous: but now a Christian finds satisfaction in
every condition by getting strength from another, by going out of it is self to
Jesus Christ, and by faith acting upon Christ, and bringing the strength of
Jesus Christ into it is own soul, and thereby is enabled to bear whatsoever God
lays upon him, by the strength that he finds from Jesus Christ, of his
fullness do we receive grace for grace, there is strength in Christ not only to
sanctify and save us, but strength to support us under all our burdens and
afflictions, and Christ expects that when we are under any burden that we
should act our faith upon him to draw virtue and strength from him, the acting
of faith that is the great grace that is to be acted under afflictions, it is
true, other graces should be acted, but the grace of faith it draws strength
from Christ, in looking upon him that has the fullness of all strength to be
convayed into the hearts of all believers. Now if a man has a burden upon him,
yet if he can have strength added to him, if the burden be doubled, yet if he
can have his strength to be tribled, the burden will not be heavier but lighter
than it was before to our natural strength. Indeed our afflictions may be
heavy, and we cry out, oh we cannot bear them, we cannot bear such an
affliction: Though thou can not tell how to bear it with thine own strength,
yet what can thou tell what thou shall do with the strnegth of Jesus Christ?
Thou say thou can not bear it, why do thou think that Christ could not
bear it? if Christ could bear it, why may not thou come to bear it? You will
say, Can I have the strength of Christ? Yea, that is made over to thee by
faith, so the Scripture says That the Lord is our strength, God himself is our
strength, and Christ is our strength, diverse Scriptures we have that way; that
Christ's strength is thine, made over to thee, that so thou may be able to
bear whatsoever lies upon thee, and therefore we find such a strange kind of
expression in the Epistle of Saint Paul to the Collossians, praying for the
Saints, that they might be strengthened with all might according unto his
glorious power, unto what? Unto all patience and long suffering with
joyfulnesse. Strengthened with all might, according to the power of God, the
glorious power of God, unto all patience, and long-suffering with joyfulness;
You may not therefore be content with a little strength, so that you are able
to bear what a man might bear by the strength of reason and nature; But to be
strengthened with all might, according to the glorious power of God, unto all
patience, and to all long suffering; Oh you that are now under very heavy and
sad afflictions more than ordinary, look upon this Scripture, and consider how
this Scripture is made good in you, why may you not have this Scripture made
good in you, if you be godly? You should not be quiet in your own spirits,
except that you in some measure do get this Scripture to be made good in you;
so that you may with some comfort say, through Gods mercy I find that strength
coming into me that is here spoken of in this Scripture. You should labor when
you are under any great affliction (you that are Godly) to walk so, that others
may see such a Scripture made good in you; Here is the glorious power of God
that does strengthen his servants to all long suffering; and that with
joyfulness. Alas it may be you do not exercise so much patience, as a wise man
or a wise woman that has but natural reason. But where is the power of God,
the glorious power of God? where is the strengthening with all might, unto all
long-suffering and patience and that with joyfulnesse? It is true, the spirit
of a man may be able to sustain his infirmities, may be able to sustain and
keep up his spirits, the natural spirit of a man, but much more then when this
spirit is acted with grace and holiness, and when it is filled with the
strength of Jesus Christ; this is the way of a godly man's getting Contentment,
the Mystery of it, it is by fetching in strength from Jesus Christ.

Twelfthly, Another Mystery, that there is in it, it is, That a godly heart,
injoys much of God in every thing it has, and does know how to make up all
wants in God himself: that is another Mystery, he has God in what he has;
that I spoke too somewhat before, in showing the dew of Gods blessing in what he
has, for God is able to let out a great deal of his power in little things,
and therefore the miracles that God has wrought, have been as much in little
things as in great; now as God lets out a great deal of his power in working
miracles in smaler things, so he lets out a great deal of goodness and mercy,
in comforting and rejoicing the hearts of his people in little things, as well
as in great; there may be as much riches in a pearl as in a great deal of
lumber; but now this is a distinct thing.

Further, a gracious heart as he lives upon Gods dew in a little that he has,
so when that little that he has shall be taken from him, what shall he do
then? Then you will say, If a man have nothing, there can be nothing fetched out
of nothing: But if the children of God have their little taken from them, they
can make up all their wants in God himself: Such a man is a poor man, the
plunderers came and took away all that he had, what shall he do then when all
is gone? But when all is gone, there is an art and skill that godliness
teaches to make up all those losses in God. Many men that have their houses
burnt, go about gathering, and so get up by many hands a little; but a godly
man knows whither to go to get up all, even in God himself, so as he shall
enjoy the quintescence of the same good and comfort as he had before, for a
Godly man does not live so much in himself as he lives in God. This is now a
Mystery to a Carnal heart, I say a gracious man does not live so much in
himself as he does in God, he lives in God continually; if there be any thing
cut off from the stream he knows how to go to the fountain, and makes up all
there; God is his all in all while he lives, I say it is God that is his all in
all. Am not I to thee (says Elkanah to Hannah) instead of ten Children? So
says God to a gracious heart, thou want this, thy estate is plundered: Why?
Am not I to thee instead of ten houses, and ten shops, I am to thee instead of
All, yet not only instead of All, but come to me, and thou shall have all again
in me: This indeed is an excellent Art, to be able to draw from God what it had
before in the creature: Christian, how did thou enjoy Comfort before? was the
creature any other to thee but a Conduit, a pipe that did convey Gods goodness
to thee? The pipe is cut off says God, come to me the Fountain and drink
immeadiately: though the beams be taken away, yet the Sun remains the same in
the firmament as ever it was; What Is that that satisfies God himself, but
because he does enjoy all fullness in himself, so he comes to have satisfaction
in himself; now if thou injoyest God to be thy portion, if thy soul can say
with the Church in Lamentations, 3.24. The Lord is my portion, says my soul,
why should thou not be satisfied and contented as God; God is contented, he
is in eternal Contentment in himself; now if thou have that God to be thy
portion, why should not thou be contented with him alone? God is contented
with himself alone, if thou have him thou may be Contented with him alone,
and it may be, that is the reason that thy outward comforts are taken from
thee, that God may be All in All to thee: It may be whilst thou hadest these
things here they did share with God in thy affection, a great part of the
stream of thy affection ran that way, now God would have the full stream run to
him: As you know it is with a man that has water come to his house, and if
there be several pipes, upon which he finds the water comes but scantly into
his wash-house, he will rather stop the other pipes that he may have all the
water come in where he would have it. So here it may be God had some stream of
thy affection that ran to him then when thou did enjoy these things; yea,
but a great deal was let out to the Creature, a great deal of thy affections
did run waste; now the Lord would not have the affections of his Children to
run waste, he does not care for other men's affections, but for thine they are
precious, and God would not have them to run waste, therefore does he cut off
thy other pipes that thy heart might run wholly upon him: As if you have
Children, because you have servants perhaps do feed them and give them things,
you perceive that your servants do steal away the hearts of your Children, you
would hardly be able to bear it, you would be ready to turn away such a
servant, and when the servant is gone, the Child is at a great loss, it has
not the nurse; but the father or mother intends by her putting away, that the
affections of the Child might run the more strongly toward himself, or
herself; and what loss has the Child that the affections that ran in a rough
channel before toward the servant, it runs now toward the mother? So those
affections that runs toward the creature, God would have them run toward
himself, that so he may be All in All to thee here in this world. And a
gracious heart can indeed tell how to enjoy God to be All in All to him: that is
the happiness of Heaven, to have God to be All in All. The Saints in Heaven
have not houses, and lands, and money, and meat and drink, and clothes, you will
say, they do not need them; why do they not? It is because God is All in All to
them imediatly: now while thou live in this world, thou may come to enjoy
much of God, you may have much of heaven; while we live in this life we may
come to enjoy much of the very life that there is in Heaven, and what is that
but the enjoyment of God to be All in All to us: There is one text in the
Revelations that speaks of the glorious condition of the Church that is like to
be even here in this world, Revel. 21.21. And I saw no Temple therein, for the
Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it; and the City had no need
of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did
lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. They had no need of the Sun or
Moon. It speaks of such a glorious condition that the Church is like to be in
here in this world; this does not speak of Heaven: and that appears plainly
that this is not spoken of Heaven, but of a glorious estate that the Church
shall be in here, in this world, for it follows presently in the 24. and 26.
verse, And they (speaking of the Kings of the earth:) And the Kings of the
Earth do bring their glory and honor unto it. Why, the Kings of the Earth
shall not bring their glory and honor into Heaven; but this is such a time,
when the Kings of the Earth shall bring their glory and honor to the Church.
And in the 26. verse. And they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations
into it; therefore it must needs be meant here in this world and not in Heaven:
Now if there be such a time here in this world, that God shall be All in All,
that in comparison there shall be no such need of creatures as now there is,
then the Saints shall labor to live as near that life as possibly they can,
that is, To make up All in God: Oh that you would but mind this Mystery, that
it may be a reality to the hearts of the Saints in such times as these are,
they would find this privilege, that they get by Grace, to be worth thousands
of worlds: Hence is that of Jacob that I mentioned in another case, it is
remarkable, and comes in fully here, in Genesis 33. that notable speech of Jacob
when his brother Esau did meet him, ye find in one place, that Esau he refused
Jacobs present, in the 8. verse, when Jacob gave his present to him, he refused
it, and told Jacob that he had enough; What meanest thou by all this drove
which I meet? And he said, These are to find grace in thy sight: And Esau said,
I have enough. Now in the 11. verse, there Jacob urges it still, (and says
Jacob) I beseech thee take it for I have enough: now in your books it is the
same in English, I have enough (says Esau:) and I have enough (says Jacob:)
but in the Hebrew, Jacobs word is different from Esau's, Jacobs word signifies,
I have all things, and yet Jacob was poorer than Esau. Oh this should be a
shame to us, that an Esau should say, I have enough; but now a Christian should
say, I have not only enough, but I have all: how has he all? because he has
God that is All. And it was an notable speech of one, He has all things, that
has him that has all things. Surely thou have all things, because thou have
him for thy portion who has al things: God has all things in himself, and
thou have God to be thine for thy portion, and in that thou have all, and this
is the Mystery of Contentment; It makes up all wants in God, this is that that
the men of the world have little skill in.

Now I have diverse other things yet to open in the Mystery of Contentment. I
should show likewise that a godly man not only makes up all in God, but finds
enough in himself to make up all, to make up all in himself, not from
himself, but in himself, and that may seem to be stranger than the other: to
make up all in God is somewhat, nay to make up all in himself, not from
himself, but in himself, that is, a gracious heart has so much of God within
himself, that he has enough there to make up all his wants that are without.
In Pro. 14.14. A good man shall be satisfied from himself, from that that is
within himself, that is the meaning, a gracious man he has a bird within his
own bosom that makes him melody enough, though he wants music, The Kingdom of
heaven is within you: In Luke, 17.21. He has a Kingdom within him, and a
Kingdom of God: you see him spoken ill of abroad, he has a conscience within
him that makes up the want of a name and credit, that is instead of a thousand
witnesses.

Thirtenth, A gracious heart fetches Contentment from the Covenant that God
has made with him. Now this is a way of fetching Contentment that the men of
the world know not of; they can fetch contentment, if they have the creature to
satisfy them: But to fetch contentment from the Covenant of grace that they
have little skill in. I should here have opened two things, First, how to fetch
Contentment from the Covenant of grace in general. (But I shall speak to that
in the next Sermon and now only a word to the Second) Secondly, how he fetches
Contentment from the particular branches of the Covenant, that is, from the
particular promises that he has for the supplying of every particular want:
there is no condition that a Godly man or woman can be in, but there is some
promise or other in the Scripture to help him in that condition. And that is the
way of his Contentment, to go out to the promises, and fetch from the promise,
that that may supply. But this is but a dry business to a carnal heart; but
it is the most real thing in the world to a gracious heart; when he finds want
of Contentment he repaires to the Promise, and the Covenant; and falls a
pleading the promises that God has made. As I should have shown several
promises that God has made let the affliction be what it will, I will but only
mention one that is the saddest affliction of all; in case of the Visitation,
and the Plague. In Psalm, 91. now those that cannot have their friends come to
them by reason of the plague, and that cannot have other comforts, in other
afflictions they might have their frinds and other things to comfort them, but
in that they cannot, Psalm. 21.10. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall
any plague come nigh thy dwelling; then here is a promise for the penilence in
the 5. and 6. verses, this is a Scripture to those that are in danger of it,
you will say, this is a promise that the Plague shall not come nigh them, but
mark these two are joined There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall the
plague come nigh thee; the evil of i^ shall not come nigh thee.

Object. You will say, It does come to many godly men, and how can they make
use of this Scripture, it is rather a Scripture that may trouble them, because
here is a promise that it shall not come nigh them, and yet it does come nigh
them as well as others.

Ans. First, this is the Answer I would give, the promises of outward
delivera^ces that were made ^o the people of God in the time of the law, were
to be understood then a great deal more literally, and fulfilled more
literally tha^ in the times of the Gospel, God makes it up otherwise with as
much mercy, though God made a covenant of grace and eternal life in Christ with
them, yet I think there was another Covenant too, that God speaks of as a
distinct covenant for outward things, to deal with his people by according to
their ways, either in outward prosperity, or in outward afflictions, more than
now, in a more punctual, set way, then in the times of the Gospel; and
therefore when the Children of Israel did but sin against God, they were sure
to have public judgments to come upon them, and if they did well, always
public mercies; the general constant way of God was to deal with the people
of the Jews according as they did well or ill, (in an ordinary way,) with
outward judgments, and outward mercies: but it is not so now in these times of
the Gospel; we cannot bring such a certain conclusion, that God did deal so
severely with men by such and such afflictions, that he will deal so with them
now: and so, that they shall have outward prosperity as they had then: therefore
that is the first thing, for the understanding of this, and all other texts of
that kind.

The Second Answer I would give is this, It may be their faith does not reach
to this promise; and God brings many times many outward afflictions, because
the faith of his people does not reach the promise, and that not only in the
old Testament, but in the times of the new Testament, Zachariah his time may be
said to be in the time of the new Testament, when he was struck with dumbness
because he did not believe, and that is given to be the cause why he was struck
with dumbness. But you will say now, has faith warant to believe deliverance,
that it shall be fully delivered? I dare not say so, but it may act upon it, to
believe that God will make it good his own way; perhaps you have not done so
much, and so upon that, this promise is not fulfilled to you.

Thirdly, When God does make such promises to his people, yet still it must be
with this reservation, that God must have liberty to these three things.

1. That notwithstanding his promise, he will have liberty to make use of any
thing for your chastisement.

2. That he must have liberty, to make use of your estates, or liberties, or
lives, for the furtherance of his own ends: If it be to be a stumbling block to
wicked and ungodly men: God must have liberty, though he have made a promise to
you he will not loose the propriety that he has in your estates and lives.

3. God must have so much liberty to make use of what you have, for to show
that his ways are unsearchable, and his judgments past finding out, God
reserves these three things in his hand still.

Object. But you will say, What good then is there in such a promise that God
makes to his people?

First; That thou art under the protection of God more than others. But what
comfort is this if it does befall me?

Ans. Thou have this comfort, that the evil of it shall be taken from thee,
that if God will make use of this affliction for other ends, yet he will do it
so as he will make it up to thee some other way. Perhaps you have given your
children such a thing, but yet afterward if you have use of that thing, you
will come and say, I must have it, why father may the child say you gave it me?
But says the father I must have it, and I will make it up to you some other
way: Now the child does not think that the fathers love is ever a whit the less
to him. So when there is any such promise as this is, that God by his promise
gives thee his protection, and yet for all that such a thing befalls thee, it is
but as if the father should say, I gave you that indeed, but let me have it and
I will make it up to you some other way that shall be as good; says God let me
have your health and liberty, and life, and it shall be made up to you some
other way.

Secondly, When ever the Plague or Pestilence comes to those that are under
such a promise, it is for some special and notable work, and God requires of
them to search and examine in a special manner to find out his meaning; there is
so much to be learned in the promise that God has made concerning this
particular evil, that the people of God they may come to quiet and content
their hearts in this affliction. I read in this Psalm that God has made a
promise to his people, to deliver them from the Plague and Pestilence, and yet
do I find it to come: It may be I have not made use of my faith in this promise
heretofore; and if God do bring afflictions upon me, yet God will make it up
some other way, God made a promise to deliver me, or at least to deliver me
from all the evil of it, now if this thing does befall me and yet I have a
promise of God, certainly the evil of it is taken away, this promise tells me
that if it does befall me yet it is for some notable end, and because God has
use of my life, and intends to fetch about his glory some way that I know not
of: And if he will come in a fatherly way of chastisement, yet I will be
satisfied in the thing: So a Christian heart by reasoning out of the word,
comes to satisfy his soul in the midst of such a heavy hand of God, and in
such a distressed condition as that is. Now Carnal hearts they find not that
power in the Word, that healing virtue that there is in the Word, to heal their
destracted cares, and the troubles of their spirits; but now, those that are
godly when they come to hear the Word they find out, that in the Word there is
as a plaster to all their wounds, and so they come to have ease and
Contentment, in such conditions as are very grievous and miserable unto others.
But now, for other particular promises, and more generally for the Covenant of
grace, how, and in what mysterious way the Saints do work to fetch out
Contentment and satisfaction to their souls, we shall refer to the next time.

SERMON IV.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


IN the last Exercise we spoke of diverse things in the Mystrie of Contentment,
and in the close we spoke of two more, but we could not have time to open
either of them, I shall open them a little more largely, and then proceed to
some few more, and so to other things in the point.

That Is the next then, A Christian heart has not only Contentment in God, (and
certainly, he that has God, must have all, he that has him that has all, he
has all) But he is able to make up all his outward wants of creature comforts
from what he finds in himself: That may seem to be more strange: It Is true,
perhaps we may convince men though they do not feel by experience what it is
to make up all in God, yet we may convince them that if they have him that has
all things, then they have al; for there is such a fullness in God, he being the
infinite first-being of all things that may make up all their wants. But here is
another thing that is further, I say a godly man can make up whatsoever he wants
without the creature, he can make it up in himself, in the 14. of the Prove. 14.
A good man is satisfied in himself: as now, If he wants outward comforts, good
cheer, feasting; a good conscience is a continual feast, he can make up the
want of a feast by that peace he has in his own conscience: if he wants melody
abroad, he has a bird within him that sings the most melodious songs that are
in the world, and the most delightful. And then does he want honor? he has
his own conscience witnessing for him, that is as a thousand witnesses, the
Scripture says in the 17. of Luke, v. 21. Neither shall they say, Lo here, or
lo there, for behold the Kingdom of God is within you; a Christian then
whatsoever he wants he can make it up, for he has a Kingdom in himself, the
Kingdom of God is within him. If one that is a King should meet with a great
deal of trouble when he is abroad, yet he Contents himself with this, I have a
Kingdom of mine own; now here it is said the Kingdom of God is within a man;
truly, upon this Scripture of the Kingdom of God being within, those that are
learned if they would but look into that Coment upon the Gospel that we have of
a learned man, they shall find a very strange conceit that he has about this
very text, he confesses indeed it is unutterable, and so indeed it is; the
Kingdom of God is within you, he makes it that there is such a presence of God
and Christ within the soul of a man, that when the body dies, he says, that
the soul goes into God and Christ that is within him, the souls going into God
and Christ, and enjoying of that Communion with God and Christ that is within
it is self, that is Heaven to it (says he) he confesses he is not able to
express himself, nor others cannot understand fully what he intends; but
certainly for the present before death, there is a Kingdom of God within the
soul, such a manifestation of God in the soul that is enough to Content the
heart of any godly man in the world, the Kingdom that he has now within him,
he shall not stay till afterward, till he goes to Heaven, but certainly there
is a Heaven in the soul of a godly man, he has Heaven already: many times when
you go to comfort your friends in their afflictions, you will say Heaven will
pay for all; nay, you may certainly find Heaven pays for all already: there is
a Heaven within the souls of the Saints, that is a certain truth, no soul shall
ever come to heaven, but that Soul that has Heaven come to it first. When you
die you hope you shall go to Heaven: But if you shall go to Heaven when you
die, Heaven will come to you before you die. Now this is a great Mystery to
have the Kingdom of Heaven in the Soul, no man can know this but that Soul that
has it, that Heaven which is within the Soul for the present (I say) it is
like the white stone and the new name, that none but those that have it can
understand it: It Is a miserable condition my brethren to depend upon creatures
altogether for our Contentment, you know that rich men account it a great
happiness, if they need not go to buy things by the penny as others do, they
have all things for pleasure or profit upon their own ground; and all their
inheritance lies entire together, they have no body comes within them, but they
have all within themselves, there lies their happiness: Whereas other poorer
people are fain to go from one Market to another to provide them necessaries,
but yet great rich men they have sheep and beeves, corn and clothing, and all
things else of their own within themselves, and herein they place their
happiness: But this is the happiness of a Christian, that he has that within
himself that may satisfy him more than all these; That place that we have in
the first of James, seems to allude to that condition of men that have all
their estates within themselves, Jam. 1.4. But let patience have her perfect
work that we may be perfect, and entire, wanting nothing: the word there used
signifies to have the whole inheritance to our selves, not a broken
inheritance, but that where all lies within themselves; as a man that has not
a piece of his estate here, and a piece there, but he has it all lie together;
and the heart being patient under afflictions finds it self to be in such an
estate as this is, finds his whole inheritance to be together, and all entire
within it is self. And now still to show this by further similitudes, it is with
him being filled with good things, just like as it is with many a man that
injoys abundance of comforts at home, at his own house, God grants to him a
convenient habitation, a comfortable yoke fellow, and fine walks and gardens,
and has all things at home that he could desire; now this man cares not much
for going abroad, other men are fain to go abroad to take the air, but he has
a sweet air at home, and they are fain to go abroad to see friends, because
they have raylings and contendings at home; many ill husbands will give this
reason, (if his wife make any moan, and complaint of his ill husbandry) of
their bad husbandry, and will make that their excuse to go abroad, because they
can never be quiet at home. Now we account those men most happy that have all
at home; those that have close houses that are unsavory, and smells ill, they
delight to go into the fresh air; I but it is not so with many others that have
these at home; those that have no good cheer at home, they are fain to go
abroad to friends, but those that have their Tables furnished, they had as live
stay at home: so a carnal man he has but little Contentment in his own spirit;
it is Austins similitude (says he) an ill conscience is like a scoulding wife,
a man (says he) that has an ill conscience he cares not to look into his own
soul, but loves to be abroad, and look into other things, but never looks to
himself, but one that has a good conscience he delights in looking into his
own heart, he has a good conscience within him: and so a carnal heart, because
there is nothing but filthiness, a filthy stink in himself, nothing but
vileness and baseness, within him; upron this it is that he seeks his
Contentment else where: And as it is with a vessel that is full of liquor, if
you strike upon it it will make no great noise, but if it be empty then it
makes a great noise; so it is with the heart, a heart that is full of grace and
goodness within, such a one will bear a great many strokes, and never make any
noise, but an empty heart if that be struck that will make a noise, those men
and women that are so much complaining, and always whyning, it is a sign that
there is an emptiness in their hearts, but if their hearts were filled with
grace they would not make such an noise as now they do. As a man that has his
bones filled with marrow, and veins filled with good blood, he complains not of
cold as others do; so a gracious heart having the Spirit of God within him, and
his heart filled with Grace, he has that within him that makes him find
Contentment. It is a speech of Seneca, Indeed those things that I suffer will
be incredible heavy when I cannot bear my self; but now if I be no burden to my
self, if I have all quiet within mine own heart, then I can bear any thing:
many men through their wickedness they have burdens without, but the greatest
burden is the wickedness of their own hearts, they are not burdened with their
sins in a godly way, that would ease their burden, but they have still their
wickedness in the power of it, and so they are burdens to themselves. The
distempers of men's hearts are mighty burdens to them; many times a godly man
has enough within to Content him; Virtue it is Content with its self, for to
live well; (Its a speech of Cicero, and its in one of his Paradoxes) It finds
enough within its own sphere for the living happily: but how few are acquainted
with this Mystery? Many think O if I had that that another man has, how
happily and comfortably should I live: Oh but if thou be a Christian,
whatsoever thy condition be, yet thou have enough within thy self, you will say
such and such men that has all things they need not be beholding to any body,
you shall have many that will labor and take pains when they are young, that
they might not be beholding to others, I love to live of my self; now a
Christian may do so; not that he does not live upon God (I mean not so) but
upon that that he has of God within himself, that he can live upon, although
he does not enjoy the comforts that are without himself, that's it which I
mean, and those that are godly and keep close to God in their Communion with
him, they understand what I mean by this, that a Christian has supply of all
his wants within himself; and here you may see that the spirit of a Christian
is a precious spirit, a godly spirit is precious, why? because it has enough
to make him happy within himself.

The next thing that the Mystery of Contentment consists in is this, That a
gracious heart fetches supply of all from the Covenant and so comes to have
Contentment; which is a dry thing to a carnal spirit: Now there are two things
here.

First, he fetches Contentment from the Covenant in general, that is from the
great Covenant that God has made with him in Christ.

Secondly, From the particular promises that God has made with him in the
Covenant.

First, From the Covenant in general. I Will give you one Scripture for that,
it is very remarkable, in the second of Sam. 23. verse. 5. Although my house be
not so with God, yet he has made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in
all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although
he make it not to grow. It Is a most admirable Scripture of David, that yet had
not the Covenant of Grace opened so fully as we have. But yet mark what David
says, Although I find not my house so, that is, so comfortably every way as I
would, although it be not so, what has he to content his spirit? says he, He
has made with me an everlasting Covenant; this is that that helps all: I am
not (may some men say) thus and thus with God, I do not find God come in so
fully, or it is not with my house and family as I hoped it might be, perhaps
there is this or that affliction upon my house; suppose you should have the
plague come into your house, and your house is not safe, and you have not that
outward comfort in your house as formerly you had, but can you read this
Scripture, and say, Although my house be not so blessed with health as other men's
houses are; although my house be not so, yet he has made with me an
everlasting Covenant, I am one yet in Covenant with God, the Lord has made
with me an everlasting Covenant: as for these things in this world, I see they
are but momentary, they are not everlasting, I see in a family when all was
well but a week ago, now all is down, and the plague has swept away a great
many of them, and the rest are left in sadness and mourning: we see there is no
resting in the things of this world, yet the Lord has made with me an
everlasting Covenant ordered in all things: I find disorder in my heart, in my
family; but the everlasting Covenant, that is ordered in all things; yea, and
that is sure: alack, there is no surenesse here in these things, I can be sure of
nothing here, especially in these times, we know that a man can be sure of
little that he has, who can be sure of his estate? perhaps some of you here
that have lived well and comfortably before, and all was well about you, and
you thought your mountain was strong, but you see within a day or two all taken
away from you, so that there is no surenesse in the things of this world: But
says he the Covenant is sure, what I venture to Sea that's not sure, but here is
an assurance Offiice indeed, here is a great assurance Office for the Saints,
and they are not at charge, but only the exercising of Grace, for they may go
to this Assurance Office to assure every thing that they venture, either to
have the thing it self, or be paid for it: In an assurance Office you cannot be
assured to have the very goods come in that you insured, but if they be lost
the Insurers do engage themselves to make it good to you. And this Covenant of
grace that God has made with his people, it is Gods Assurance Office, and the
Saints in all their fears may and ought to go to the Covenant to assure all
things to them, to assure their estates and assure their lives. You will say,
how are they sure, their lives and estates go as well as others? But God
ingages himself to make up all: And then mark what follows, This is all my
Salvation, Why David will thou not have salvation from thine enemies and
outward dangers, from pestilence and plague? The frame of his spirit is
quieted, as if he should say, if that Salvation comes, well and good, I shall
praise God for it, but that that I have in the Covenant, that is my salvation, I
look upon that as enough: Yea and then further, This is all my salvation, and
all my desire, Why David is there not something else that thou would have
besides this Covenant? No says he, it is all involved in this. Now surely
those men or women must needs live contented lives that have all their desires;
now says the holy man here, this is all my desire, And though he make it not
to grow. But for all this Covenant perhaps you will not prosper in the world as
other men do, true, but I am at a point for that: Though God does not make my
house to grow, I have all my desires.

Thus you see how a godly heart finds contentment in the Covenant, many of you
speak of the Covenant of God, and of the Covenant of grace, but have you found
it so effectual to your souls? have you sucked this sweetness from the Covenant
and content to your hearts in your sad conditions? It Is a special sign of the
truth of grace in any soul, that when any affliction does befall him, in a kind
of natural way he does presently repair to the Covenant; just as a Child as
soon as ever it is in danger, you shall not need to tell him and say, when you
are in danger you must go to your father or mother, nature tells him so: so it
is with a gracious heart, as soon as it is in any trouble or affliction there
is a new nature that does carry him to the Covenant presently, and there it
finds ease and rest: and if you find that your hearts do thus work, presently
to be running to the Covenant, it is an excellent sign of the truth of grace:
that's for the general.

But now for particular promises in the Covenant of grace. A gracious heart
looks upon every promise as coming from the Root of the great Covenant of
grace in Christ. Other men look upon some particular promises, that God will
help them in straights, and keep them and the like; but they look not upon the
conection of such particular promises, to the root, the Covenant of grace: Now
Christians do miss of a great deal of comfort they might have, from the
particular promises in the Gospel, if they would look upon their conectio^ to the
root, the great Covenant that God has made with them in Christ. Now I remember
I spoke a little about that, that in outward promises in the time of the Law,
they might rest more upon them than we can in the time of the Gospel. I gave
you the reason why we that live in the time of the Gospel cannot rest so fully,
for a litteral performance of outward promises that we meet withal in the
Old Testament, as they might in the time of the Law: for there was a special
Covenant, that God pleased to call a New Covenant by way of distinction from
the other Covenant that is made with us in Christ for eternal life: And so even
the Law was given to them in a more peculier way for an external Covenant of
outward blessings in the land of Canaan; and so God did deal with them in a
more external covenant than he does now with his people. Yet godliness, has
the promise of this life, and that which is to come. We may make use of the
promises for this life, but yet not so much to rest upon the litteral
performance of them as they might; but that God will make them good some way or
other, in a spiritual way, if not in an outward way. We must lay no more upon
outward promises than this, and therefore if we will lay more, we make the
promise to bear more than it will bear out. For to give some instance; to
believe fully and confidently, that the Plague shall not come nigh such a house
(I say) it is to lay more upon such a promise than it will bear. I opened that
promise in Psalm. 91. now if I had lived in the time of the Law, perhaps I might
have been somewhat more confident of the litteral performance of the promise,
than I can now in the time of the Gospel; the promise now bears no more than
this, that God has a special protection over his people, and that he will
deliver them from the evil of such an affliction; and if he does bring such an
affliction it is more than an ordinary providence, it is some special
providence that God has in it. I had thought to have given you diverse promises
for the contentment of the heart in the time of affliction. Isa. 43.2. When
thou passest through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers
they shall not overflow thee; when thou walk through the fire thou shall
not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. Certainly though this
promise was made in the time of the law, yet it will be made good to all the
Saints now, one way or other, either in the letter or some other ways. For so
we find it plainly, that promise that was made to Joshua, I will not fail thee
nor forsake thee, Josh. 1.5. It Is applied to the Christians in the time of the
Gospel. So that here is the way of faith in bringing Contentment by the
promises, that all the promises that ever were made to our forefathers, from
the beginning of the world, the Saints of God have an interest in them, they
are their inheritances, and so goes on from one generation to another, and by
that they come to have Contentment, because they do inherit all the promises
made in all the book of God, So Heb. 13.5. shows plainly, that it is our
inheritance, and we do not inherit less now than they did in Joshuas time, but
we inherit more; for you shall find in that place of the Hebrews there is more
said than is to Joshua; to Joshua God says, He will not leave him nor forsake
him; now in that place in the Hebrews in the Greek there is five negatives, I
will not, not, not, not, not again, there is the elegancy of it very much, in
the Greek (I say) there is five negatives in that little sentence; as if God
should say, I will not leave you, no I will not, I will not, I will not, with
such earnestness five times together: So that we have not only the same
promises that they had, but we have them more enlarged and more full, though
still not so much in the litteral sense, for that indeed is the least part of
the promise, In Esa. 54.17. there God made a promise, That no weapon formed
against his people should prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against
them in judgment thou shall condemn, (and mark what follows) This is the
heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me says
the Lord: this is a good promise for a soldier, though still not to lay to
much upon the litteral sense: True, it holds forth thus much, that Gods
protection is in a special manner over soldiers that are godly, And every
tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn: and this
is against false witness too: Oh you, that your friends never left you any
thing, you will say, my friends died and left not me a great, but I thank God,
God has provided for me; But though thy father or mother died and left thee no
heritage, yet thou have a heritage in the promise, This is their heritage. So
that there is no godly man or woman, but is a great heir. Therefore when thou
look into the Book of God and find any promise there, thou may make
that thine own. Just as an heir that rides over diverse fields and meadows,
says he, this meadow is my heritage, and this corn-field is my heritage; and
then he sees a fair house, and says he, this fair house is my heritage; and he
looks upon them with another manner of eye than a stranger that shall ride over
those fields. So a carnal heart reads the promises, and reads them but merely
as stories, not that they have any great intrest in them: But a godly man every
time he reads the Scriptures (remember this note when you are reading the
Scripture) and there meets with a promise, he ought to lay his hand upon it
and say, this is a part of my heritage, it is mine, and I am to live upon it,
and this will make you to be Contented. Here Is a mysterious way of Contentment,
So in Psalm. 34.10. and 37.6. there is diverse other promises that brings
Contentment. In Isa. 58.10. And thus much for the Mystery of Contentment by
way of the Covenant.

There is two or three things more that show how a godly man, has Contentment
after another kind of way than any Carnal heart in the world has, it is a
mysterious way, as thus.

He has Contentment by realizing the glorious things of heaven to him, he has
the Kingdom of heaven as present, and the glory that is to come, by faith he
makes it as present. So the Martyrs they had Contentment in their sufferings,
for said some of them, though we have but a hard breakfast, yet we shall have a
good dinner, we shall presently be in heaven; do but shut your eyes (says one)
and you shall be in heaven presently. 2 Cor. 4.16. We faint not (says the
Apostle) Why? Because these light afflictions that are but for a moment,
works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. They see
heaven before them and that contents them. You Mariners when you can see the
haven before you, though you were mightily troubled before you could see any
land, yet when you come nigh the shore and can see such a landmark, that
contents you exceedingly: a godly man in the midst of the waves and storms
that he meets withal, he can see the glory of heaven before him and so
contents himself; one drop of the sweetness of heaven is enough to take away
all the sower and bitter of all the afflictions in the world: Indeed here we
know that one drop of sower, or one drop of gall will make bitter a great deal
of honey, put a spoonful of sugar into a cup of gall or wormwood, that will
not sweeten it, but if you put a spoonful of gall into a cup of sugar it will
imbitter that; now its otherwise in heaven, one drop of sweet will sweeten a
great deal of sower affliction, but a great deal of sower and gall will not
imbitter a soul that sees the glory of heaven that is to come: now a Carnal
heart has no Contentment but from what he sees before him in this world but a
godly heart has Contentment from that that he sees laid up for him in the
highest heavens.

The last thing that I would name is this, A godly man has Contentment by
opening and letting out of his heart to God, other men or women they are
discontented, but how do they help themselves? by railing, by ill language,
such a one crosses them, and they have no way to help themselves but by railing
and by bitter words, and so they ease themselves that way when they are angry,
but a godly man when he is crossed, how does he ease himself? he is sensible of
his cross as well as you, and he goes to God in prayer, and there opens his
heart to God, and lets out his sorrows and fears, and then can come away with a
joyful countenance; now do you find that you can come away from prayer and not
look sad? As it is said (in 1 Samuel 1.18.) of Hannah, that when she had been at
prayer her countenance was no more sad, there she was comforted; and this is
the right way of Contentment. Thus we have done with the Mystery of
Contentment. Now if you can but put these things together that we have spoken
of, you may see fully what an Art Christian Contentment is; Paul had need learn
it; you see Contentment is not such a poor business as many make it, to say,
you must be content etc. But it is a great art and mystery of godliness to be
contented in the way of a Christian, and it will appear yet further to be a
mystery, when we come to the Third Head; and that is to show what those lessons
are that a gracious heart does learn when it learns to be contented. I have
learned to be Contented; Learned, what lessons have you lern'd? As now a
Scholar that has great learning and understanding in Arts and Sciences, how
did he begin it? he began (as we use to say) his A B C, and then afterward he
came to his Testament, and Bible, and Accidence, and so to his Gramer, and
afterward to his other books; so he learned one thing after another: So a
Christian coming to Contentment is as a Scholar in Christ's School, and there
are diverse lessons to teach the soul to bring it to this learning: every godly
man or woman is a scholar, it cannot be said of any Christian that he is
illiterate, but he is litterate, a learned man, a learned woman: now the
lessons that Christ teaches, to bring us to Contentment, are these:

The First great Lesson is, The lesson of Self-denial: and though it be a great
lesson and hard; as you know a child at first cries, It Is hard. It Is that that
I remember Bradford the Martyr says, Whosoever has not learned the lesson of
the Cross, has not learned his A B C in Christianity. Here Christ begins with
his Scholars, yea those in the lowest form must begin with this; if you mean to
be Christian at all, you must buckle to this or you can never be Christians:
There is none can be a Scholar except he does learn his A B C: so thou must
learn the lesson of self-denial or thou can never come to be a Scholar in
Christ's School, to be learned in this mystery of Contentment: That Is the first
lesson that Christ teaches any soul: Oh self-denial that brings Contentment,
that brings down and softens a man's heart; a thing (you know) that is soft if
you strike upon it it makes no noise, but if you strike upon a hard thing it
makes a noise; so the hearts of men that are full of themselves, and hardened
with self-love, if they have any stroke they make a noise, but a self-denying
Christian yields to Gods hand, and makes no noise; as when you strike upon a
woolsack it makes no noise because it yields to the stroke; So a self-denying
heart yields to the stroke and thereby comes to this Contentment. Now in this
lesson of self-denial there are diverse things, I will not enter into the
Doctrine of self-denial, but only show you how Christ teaches self-denial, and
how that brings Contentment.

First, Such a one learns to know that he is nothing, he comes to this, to be
able to say, Well, I see I am nothing in my self, now that man or woman which
indeed knows that he or she is nothing, and has learned it thoroughly will be
able to bear any thing: The way to be able to bear any thing, it is to know our
selves to be nothing in our selves. Says God to us, Will thou set thine heart
upon that which is nothing? Pro. 23.5. speaking of riches; Why blessed God do
not thou do so? thou have set thy heart upon us and yet we are nothing. God
would not have us set our hearts upon riches because they are nothing, and yet
God is pleased to set his heart upon us, and yet we are nothing, that is Gods
grace, free grace, and therefore it is no great matter what I suffer for I am as
nothing.

Secondly, I deserve nothing. I am nothing, and I deserve nothing: suppose I
have not this and that that others have, I am sure I deserve nothing except it
be Hell: you will answer any of your servants so that is not content, I marvel
what you deserve? or your children, Do you deserve it that you are so eager
upon it? you think to stop their mouths thus; so we may easily stop our own
mouths, we deserve nothing, and therefore why should we be impatient if we
have not what we desire, if we had deserved any thing, we might have some
trouble of spirit, as a man that has deserved well of the State, or of his
friends and he finds not an answerable encouragement, it troubles him mightily,
but if he be conscious to himself that he has deserved nothing he is content
with a repulse.

Thirdly, I can do nothing. Without me you can do nothing, says Christ Joh.
15.5. why should I stand much upon it to be troubled and discontented if I have
not this and that, when the truth is I can do nothing? If you should come to
one that is angery because he has not such diet as he desires, and is
discontented with it, you will answer him, I mervail what you do, what use you
are of? Shall one that will sit still and be of no use, yet for all that he
must have all the supply that possibly he can desire? Do but consider of what
use you are in the world; if you consider what little need God has of you, and
what little use you are of, you will not be much discontented: If you have
learned this lesson of self-denials though God does cut you short of such and
such comforts, yet since that I do but little why should I have much, this very
thought will bring down a man's spirit as much as any thing, That Is the Third.

Fourthly, So vile I am that I can receive no good neither of my self, I am not
only an empty vessel, but a corrupt and unclean vessel that would spoil any
thing that comes into it: so are all our hearts, every one of our hearts is not
only empty of good, but are like a mustie vessel that if any good licquor be
powered into it it spoils it, And that is the Fourth thing.

Fifthly, If God does cleanse us in some measure, and does put into us some
good licquor some grace of his Spirit: yet in the fifth place, We can make use
of nothing neither when we have it, if God does but withdraw himself; If God
does but leave us one moment after he has bestowed upon us the greatest gifts,
and whatsoever abilities we can desire, if God should say, I will give you them,
now go and trade now I have given you these and these abilities, we cannot stir
one foot further neither if God does but leave us. Does God give us gifts and
parts? Then let us fear and tremble least God should leave us to our selves,
for then how foully should we abuse those gifts and parts, you think other men
and women have memory and gifts and parts and you would fain have them, But
suppose God should give you these and there leave you, you would utterly spoil
them.

Sixthly, We are worse than nothing. For by sin we come to be a great deal worse
than nothing; sin makes us more vile than nothing, sin makes us contrary to all
good: now it is a great deal worse to have a contrariety to all that is good,
than merely to have an emptiness of all that is good, we are not empty pitchers
in respect of good, but we are like pitchers filled with poison, and is it much
for such as we are to be cut short of outward comforts?

In the Seventh place, If we perish there will no loss of us. If God should
anihilate me what loss would there be of me? God can raise up another in my
place, to do him other manner of service than I have done. Now put but these
Seven things together and then has Christ taught you Self-denial: I may call
these the several words in our lesson of Self-denial; Christ teaches the soul
this, so that as in the presence of God upon a real sight of its self it can
say, Lord I am nothing, Lord I deserve nothing, Lord I can do nothing, I can
receive nothing, I can make use of nothing, I am worse than nothing, and if I
come to nothing and perish, there will be no loss at all of me, and therefore
what great matter is it for me to be cut short here? A man that is little in
his own eyes, such a man or woman will account every affliction to be little,
and every mercy to be great: Saul, There was a time (the Scripture says) that
he was little in his own eyes, and then his afflictions were but little to him,
when some would not have had him to be King but spoke contemptuously of him he
held his peace, but when Saul began to be big in his own eyes, then the
affliction began to be great upon him. There was never any such contented man
or woman at this self-denying man or woman: There was never any denied himself
so much as Jesus Christ did, he gave his cheeks to the smiters, he opened not
his mouth, he was as a lamb when he was led to the slaughter, he made no noise
in the street, Oh he denied himself above all, and was willing to empty
himself, and so he was the most contented that ever any was in the world, and
the nearer we come to learn to deny our selves as Christ did, the more
contented shall we be, and by knowing much of our own vileness, we come to
learn to justify God, whatever the Lord shall lay upon us, yet, righteous is
the Lord, for he has to deal with a most wretched creature. A discontented
heart he is troubled because he has no more comfort; but one that is a
self-denying man he rather wonders that he has so much as he has: Oh says
one, I have but a little; I but says he that has learned this lesson of
Self-denial, I rather wonder that God bestows upon me the liberty of breathing
in the air, knowing how vile I am, and knowing how much sin the Lord does see
in me: And that is the way of Contentment, by learning Self-denial.

Eighthly, There is a further thing in self-denial which brings Contentment,
Because thereby the Soul comes to rejoice and take satisfaction in all Gods
ways, (I beseech you observe this) If a man be selvish and have Self-love
prevail in his heart, those things that suits with his own ends he will be glad
of them, but a godly man that has denied himself he will suit with and be glad
of all things that shall suit with Gods ends: Says a gracious heart, Gods ends
are my ends, and I have denied mine own ends, and so he comes to find
Contentment in all Gods ends and ways, and his comforts are multiplied,
whereas the comforts of other men are single, it is but very rare that Gods
ways shall suit with a man's particular end, but always Gods ways suit with
his own ends; now if you will only have contentment when Gods ways suits with
your own ends, you can have it but now and then, but a Self-denying man denies
his own ends and only looks at the ends of God and therein is contented: When a
man is selvish he cannot but have a great deal of trouble and vexation, for if
I regard my self, my ends are so narrow that I shall have a hundred things will
come and jussel me, and I cannot have room in those narrow ends of mine own; as
you know in the the City what a deal of stir there is in narrow streets, as
Thames street being so narrow they jussel and wrangle and fight one with
another because the place is so narrow, but now in the broad streets there they
can go quietly; so men that are selvish they meet and so jussel one with
another, one man is for self in one thing, and another man is for self in
another thing, and so they make a great deal of stir, but those whose hearts
are enlarged, and make public things their ends, and can deny themselves,
they can walk at breadth and never jussel one with another so as the other do.
The lesson of Self-denial is the first lesson that Jesus Christ does learn men
in the seeking of Contentment.

The Second lesson is, The vanity of the Creature. That Is the Second lesson in
Christ's School that he teaches those that he would make Scholars in this Art:
The vanity of the Creature, That whatsoever there is in the Creature has an
emptines in it, Vanity of vanities all is vanity, that is the lesson that the
Wiseman learned, that the Creature in it is self can do us neither good nor
hurt, but it is all but as wind, there is nothing in the Creature that is
suitable to a gracious heart to feed upon for the good and hapdinesse of it. My
brethren the reason why you have not Contentment in the things of the world, it
is not because you have not enough of them, that is not the reason, but the
reason is because they are not things proportionable to that immortal soul of
yours that are capable of God himself; many men think when they are troubled
and have not Contentment that it is because they have but a little in the
world, and if they had more then they should be content. That were just thus,
suppose a man is an hungry, and so satisfy his craving stomak he should gape
and hold open his mouth to take in the wind, and then should think the reason
why he is not satisfied is, because he has not enough of the wind; no, the
reason is because the thing is not suitable to a craving stomach, truly there is
the same madness in the world; the wind that a man takes in by gaping will as
soon satisfy a craving stomach which is ready to famish, as all the comforts
in the world can satisfy a soul that knows what true happiness means. You
would be happy, and you seek after such and such comforts in the Creature;
well, have you got them, do you find your hearts satisfied as having that
happiness that is suitable to you? No, no it is not here, but you think it is
because you want such and such things: O poor deluded man, it is not because
you have not enough of it, but because it is not the thing that is
proportionable to that immortal soul that God has given you. Why do you lay
out your money for that which is not bread, ( Isa. 55:2.) And your labor for
that which satisfies not? You are mad people, you seek to satisfy your
stomaks with that that is not bread, you follow the wind, you will never have
Contentment, all creatures in the world say, Contentment it not in us, riches
says Contentment is not in me, pleasure says Contentment is not in me, if you
look for Contentment in the creature you will fail; No, Contentment is higher:
When thou come into the School of Christ, Christ teaches thee that there is a
vanity in all things in the world, and the soul that by coming into the School
of Christ, by understanding the glorious mysteries of the Gospel comes to see
the vanity of all things in the world, that is the soul that comes to true
Contentment. I could tell you of abundance of sentences from Heathens that
shows the vanity all things in the world, and yet they did not learn the vanity
of the Creature in the right School. But now when a Soul comes into the School
of Jesus Christ, and there comes to see a vanity in all things in the world,
then such a soul comes to have Contentment. If you seek Contentment else where,
you do like the unclean spirit, seek for rest but find none.

A Third lesson that Christ teaches a Christian when he comes into his School
is this, He learns him to understand what that one thing is that is necessary
which he never came to understand before: you know what he said to Martha, O
Martha thou cumberest thy self about many things, but there is one thing
necessary. The Soul before sought after this and the other thing, but now says
the Soul I see really that it is not necessary that I should be rich, but it is
necessary that I should make up my peace with God, it is not necessary that I
should live a pleasurable life in this world, but it is absolutely necessary
that I should have pardon of my sin, it is not necessary that I should have
honor and preferment, but it is necessary that I should have God to be my
portion, and have my part in Jesus Christ, it is necessary that my soul should
be saved in the day of Jesus Christ; the other things are pretty fine things
indeed, and I should be glad if God would give them me, a fine habitation, and
comings-in, and clothes, and promotion for my wife and childrrn, these are
comfortable things, but these are not the necessary things, I may have these
and yet perish for ever, but the other is absolutely necessary; no matter
though I be poor so be it I may have that that is absolutely necessary; thus
Christ instructs the Soul. There Is many of you have had some thoughts about
this that it is indeed necessary for you to provide for your Souls, but when
you come into Christ's School, there Christ causes the fear of eternity to fall
upon you, and there he causes such a real sight of the great things of eternity
and the absolute necessity of those things, that possesses your hearts with
fear, and that takes you off from all other things in the world. Now I should
have shown you how that will bring Contentment to the Soul when it comes to be
instructed in the thing that is absolutely necessary; but thus much for this
time.

SERMON V.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


I Mentioned Three lessons the last time, that Christ teaehes those Scholars
that comes into his School whereby they might come to get Contentment.

First, The lesson of Self-denial.

Secondly, The lesson of the vanity of the Creature.

Thirdly, The right understanding of that one thing that is necessary. A little
to enlarge this one, and so to proceed to others.

It is said of Pompie, that when he was to carry corn to Rome in time of darth,
he was in a great deal of danger by storms at Sea, but says he, We must go on,
it is necessary that Rome should be releived, but it is not necessary that we
should live. So it would he certainly when the soul is once taken up with the
things that are of absolute necessity, it will not be much troubled about other
things. What are the things that do disquiet us here but some by-matters in
this world? and it is because our hearts are not taken up with that one
absolute necessary thing; who are the men that are most discontented, but idle
persons, persons that have nothing to take up their minds, every little thing
disquiets and discontents them? but now a man that has business of great
weight and consequence, if all things goes well with his great business that
is in his head, he is not sensible of meaner things in the family; but now a
man that lies at home and has nothing to do, he finds fault with every thing;
so it is with the heart, when the heart of a man has nothing to do but to be
busy about creature comforts, every little thing troubles him; but now, when
the heart is taken up with the weighty things of eternity, with the great
things of eternal life, the heart being taken up with them, these things that
are here below that did disquiet it before, are things now of no consideration
with him in comparison to the other, so as how things fall out here is not much
regarded with him, if the one thing that is necessary be provided for.

The Fourth lesson that the Soul is instructed in to come to this knowledge in
the art of Contentment, is this: The soul comes to understand in what relation
it stands in here to the world. By that I mean thus, God comes to instruct the
soul effectually through Christ by his Spirit, upon what terms it lives here in
the world, in what relation it is that it does stand: as thus, While I live in
the world my condition is to be but a pilgrim, a stranger, a traveller, and a
soldier: now the right understanding of this, and being taught this not only
by rote, that I can speak the words over, but when I come indeed to have my
soul possessed with the consideration of this truth, that God has set me in this
world, not as in my home, but as a mere stranger and a pilgrim, that I am
traveling here to another home, and that I am here a soldier in my warfare;
it is a mighty help to Contentment in whatsoever befalls one: as now to
instance in all these conditions, When a man is at home, if he has not things
according to his desire he will be finding fault, and is not contented, but if
a man travels abroad, perhaps he meets not with conveniences as he desires, the
servants in the house are not at his beck, or are not so diligent as his own
serveants were, and his diet is not as at home, and his bed not as at home, yet
this very thought may moderate a man's spirit, I am a traveller, and I must not
be finding fault, I am but in another man's house, and it were not manners for
one to find fault when he is abroad in another bodies family though things be
not so as in my own family; If a man meets with ill weather he must be content,
it is travelers fare (we use to say) both fair weather and foul weather, this
is the common travelers fare, and we must be content with it; but if a man
were at home and it should drop down in his house, he would account it an ill
thing, an affliction to him, and he cannot bear it: but when he is traveling
abroad though he meet with rain and storms he is not so much troubled: When
you are abroad at Sea, though you have not those many things that you have at
home, you are not troubled at it, you are contented; why? you are abroad at
Sea, you are not troubled at storms that do arise, and though you have many
things otherwise than you would have them at home, but still you are quieted
with that you are at Sea. Mariners when they are at Sea they care not what
clothes they have then, though they be pich't and tar'd, and but a clout about
their necks, and any mean clothes, but they think when they come home, then
they shall have their fine silk stockings, and brave suits, and laced bands and
such things, and shall be very fine; and so they are contented abroad upon that
thought that it shall be otherwise with them when they come home, and though
they have nothing but salt meat, and a little hard fare, yet when they come to
their houses then they shall have any thing: Thus it should be with us in this
world, the truth is, we are all in this world but as Seafaring men, tossed up
and down on the waves of the Sea of this world, and our haven is Heaven, and we
are here traveling, but our home it is another world, that long home. Indeed
some men have better accommodations than others have in traveling; it is true,
it is a great mercy of God to us in England, in that we can travel with such
delight and accommodations more than they can in other Countries; and through
Gods mercy we have as great accommodations in our traveling to Heaven in
England as any place under Heaven has, but yet though we do meet with
travelers fare sometimes, yet it should not be greiveous to us: The Scripture
tells us plainly that we must behave our selves here but as pilgrims and
strangers, In 1 Peter, 2.11. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and
pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the Soul: Consider what
your condition is, you are pilgrims and strangers, do not think to satisfy
your selves here. A man when he comes into an Inn, If there be a fair cupbord
of plate he is not troubled that it is not his own, Why? Because he is going
away; so let us not be troubled when we see othar men have great estates, but
we have not, why? we are going away into another Country, you are lodging here
but as it were for a night, if you should live an hundred years in comparison
of eternity it is not so much as a night, it is but as you were traveling, and
were come into an Inn: And were not this a madness for a man to be discontent
because he has not what he sees there, seeing it may be he is to go away again
within half a quarter of an hour? So you find it in David, this was the
argument that brought off David's heart from the things of this world, and set
him upon other manner of things, Psalm. 119.19. I am a stranger in the earth,
hide not thy Commandments from me: I am a stranger in the earth (what then)
then Lord let me have the knowledge of thy Commandments and it is sufficient,
as for the things of the earth I stand not upon them whether I have much or
little, but hide not thy Commandments from me, Lord let me know the rule that
I should guide my life by.

Again, We are not only travelers but soldiers, this is the condition of the
life in which we are here in this world: and therefore we are to behave our
selves accordingly. So the Apostle makes use of this argument in writing unto
Timothy, 2 Timothy 2.3. Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of
Jesus Christ. The very thought of the condition of a man that is a soldier,
does still his disquiet of heart: when he is abroad, he has not that
accomodations in his quarters as he has in his own family; perhaps a man that
had his bed and curtains drawn about him, and all accomodations in his chamber;
now perhaps sometimes he must be put to lie upon straw, and he thinks with
himself, I am a soldier and it is suitable to my condition: he must have his
bed warmed at home, but he must lie abroad in the fields when he is a soldier;
and the very thought of this condition in which he stands quiets him in all
things; yea and he goes rejoicing, to think this is but suitable to my condition
in which God has put me: so it should be with us in respect of this world. Now
would it not be an unseemly thing to see a soldier go whyning up and down with
the finger in the eye and complaying, that he has not hot meat every meal, and
his bed warmed as he had at home. Now Christians they know that they are in
their warfare, they are here in this world fighting and combating with the
enemies of their souls and eternal condition, and they must be willing to
endure hardness here. The right understanding of this, that God has put them
into such a condition, it is that that will content them, especially when they
consider that they are certain of the victory, and that ere long they shall
triumph with Jesus Christ, and then all their sorrows shall be done away, and
their tears wiped from their eyes. A soldier is content to endure hardness
though he knows not that he shall have the victory, but a Christian knows
himself to be a soldier, and knows that he shall conquer and triumph with
Jesus Christ to all eternity. And that is the fourth lesson that Christ does
teach the soul when he brings it into his School, to learn the Art of
Contentment, he makes him understand thoroughly the relation in which he has
placed him in, in this world.

The Fifth lesson that Christ teaches, it is this, He teaches us wherein
consists any good that is to be enjoyed in any creature in the world. It Is
true, before it has been taught that there is a vanity in the Creature, that
is, take the Creature considered in it is self, but yet though there be a vanity
in the Creature in it is self, in respect of satisfying the soul for it is
portion, yet there is some goodness in the Creature, though there be a vanity
there is some desirablenesse: But wherein does that consist? It consists not in
the nature of the Creature it self, for that is nothing but vanity, but it
consists in the reference it has to the first being of all things. This is a
Lesson that Christ teaches, if there be any good in an estate, or in any
comforts in this world, it is not so much that it pleases my sense, that it is
suitable to my body, but the reference it has to God the first being, that by
these creatures there should be somewhat of Gods goodness conveyed to me, and
I may have a sanctified use of the creature to draw me nearer to God, and that
I enjoy more of God, and be made more servicable for the glory of God in the
place where God has set me, here is the good of the Creature; Oh were we but
instructed in this lesson, did we but understand, and thoroughly believe this to
be a truth, that there is no creature in all the world has any goodness in it
any further then it has reference to the first infinite supreme good of all,
that so far as I can enjoy God in it, so far it is good to me, and so far as I
do not enjoy God in it, so far there is no goodness in any thing that I have
in the Creature, how easy were it then for one to be contented; as thus,
Suppose a man had a great estate but a few years ago, and now it is all gone, I
would but appeal to this man, when you had your estate, wherein did you
account the good of that estate to consist? a carnal heart would say, any body
might know that; that it brought me in so much a year, and that I could fare of
the best, and be a man of repute in the place where I live, and men would
regard what I said, I might be clothed as I would, and lay up portions for my
children, in this consisted the good of my estate; this man now never came into
the School of Christ to know wherein the good of an estate did consist, no
marvail if he be disquieted when he has lost his estate: But now a Christian
that has been in the School of Christ, and has been instructed in the art of
Contentment, when such a one has an estate, he thinks, in that I have an
estate above my brethren, in this consists the good of it tome, in that I have
an opportunity to serve God the better, and I enjoy a great deal of Gods mercy
to my Soul conveyed to me through the Creature, and hereby I am enabled to do a
great deal of good, and therein I account the good of my estate. Now God has
taken this away from me, now if God will be pleased to make up the enjoyment of
himself another way; that is, will call me to honor him by suffering, and if I
may do God as much service now in my way of suffering, that is to show forth
the Grace of his Spirit in the way of my suffering as I did in the way of
prosperity, I have as much of God as I had before; if I may be led to God in my
low condition, as much as I was in my prosperous condition, I have as much
comfort and contentment as I had before.

Obj. But you will say, it is true, If I could honor God in my low estate as
much as in my prosperous estate then it were somewhat, but how can that be?

Answ. You must know the special honor that God has from his creatures in
this world, it is the manifestation of the Graces of his Spirit; It Is true, God
has a great deal of honor when a man is in a public place, and so he is able
to do a great deal of good, to countenance Godliness, and discountenance Sin,
but the main thing is in our showing forth the virtues of him that has called
us out of darkness into his mavelous light. Now if I can say that through
Gods mercy in my affliction I find the Graces of Gods Spirit working as
strongly in me as ever they did when I had my estate, I am where I was, yea I
am fully in as good a condition, for I have that good now that I had in my
prosperous estate, for I accounted the good of it but in my enjoyment of God,
and honoring of God, and now God has blessed the want of it to stir up the
Graces of his Spirit in my soul, and this is the work that now God calls me to,
and I must account God is most honored when I do the work that he calls me to,
he set me a work in my prosperous estate at that time, to honor him in that
condition, and now he sets me a work at this time to honor him in this
condition: Now God is most honored when I can turn from one condition to
another according as he calls me to it: would you account your selves to be
honored by your servants, when you set them about a work that has some
excellency, and they will go on and on, and you cannot get them off from it?
Now let the work be never so good, yet if you will call them off to another
work you do expect that they should manifest so much respect to you as to be
content to come off from that, though they be set about a meaner work, if it be
more suitable to your ends. So you were in a prosperous estate, and there God
called you to some service that you took some pleasure in; but suppose God
says, I will use you in a suffering condition, and I will have you honor me
in that way, now here is the honoring of God that you can turn this way or that
way, as God calls you to it; thus now you having learned this, That the good of
the Creature cansists in the enjoyment of God in it, and the honoring of God
by it, you can be content, because you have the same good that you had before.
And that is the Fifth lesson.

The Sixth Lesson that Christ does teach the soul that he brings into this
School, is this, He does instruct such a man or woman in the knowledge of
their own hearts: you must learn this or you will never learn Contentment; you
must learn to know your own hearts well, to be good studients of your own
hearts, you cannot al be scholars in the arts and sciences in the world, but
you may all be students in your own hearts, you cannot read in the book (many
of you,) but God expects that every day you should turn over a leaf in your own
hearts; you will never come to get any skill in this Mystery, except you study
the book of your own hearts: Mariners, they have their books that they study,
those that will be good Navigaters, and Scholars they have their books; those
that study Logic, they have their books according to that; and those that
would study Rhetoric and Philosophy have their books according to that; and
those that study Divinity, they have their books whereby they come to be helped
in the study of Divinity: but a Christian next to the book of God is to look
into the book of his own heart, and to read over that, and this will help you
to Contentment these three ways:

1. By the studying of thy heart, thou will come presently to discover wherein
thy discontent lies; when thou art discontented, thou will find out the root of
any coffeehouse if thou do study thy heart well: many men and women they
are discontented, and the truth is they know not wherefore, they think this and
the other thing is the cause, but a man or woman that knows their own heart,
they will find out presently where the root of their discontent lies, that it
lies in such a corruption, and distemper of my heart, that now through Gods
mercy I have found out; It is in this case as it is with a little child that
is very froward in the house, if a stranger comes in he does not know what the
matter is, perhaps the stranger will give the child a rattle, or a nut, or such
a thing to quiet it, but when the Nurse comes she knows the temper and
disposition of the Child, and therefore knows best how to quiet it; so it is
here just thus for all the world, when we are strangers with our own hearts we
are mightily discontented, and know not how to quiet our selves, because we
know not wherein the disquiet lies: and indeed when we are strangers to our
own hearts we cannot tell how to quiet our selves, but if we be very well verst
in our own hearts, when any thing falls out so as to disquiet us, we find out
the cause of it presently, and so quickly come to be quiet. So a man that has
a Watch, and he understands the use of every wheel and pin, if it goes amiss
he will presently find out the cause of it: but one that has no skill in a
Watch, when it goes amiss he knows not what the matter is, and therefore
cannot mend it. So indeed our hearts are as a Watch, and there are many wheels,
and windings and turnings there, and we should labor to know our hearts well,
that when they are out of tune we may know what the matter is.

2 This knowledge of our hearts will help us to Contentment because by this we
shall come to know what is most suitable to our condition. As thus, a man that
knows not his own heart he thinks not what need he has of affliction, and upon
that he is disquieted; but that man or woman that has studied their own
hearts, when God comes with afflictions upon them, they can say, I would not
for any thing in the world have been without this affliction, God has so suited
this affliction to my condition, and has come in such a way, that if this
affliction had not come I am afraid I should have fallen into sin; a poor
country man that takes Physic, the Physic works, and he thinks it will kill
him, because he knows not the ill humors that are in his body, and therefore
he understands not how suitable the Physic is to him; but a Physician takes a
purge, and it makes him extremely sick, says the Physician I like this the
better, it does but work upon the humor that I know is the matter of my
disease, and upon that such a man that has knowledge and understanding in his
body, and the cause of his distemper, he is not troubled or disquieted: So
would we be if we did but know the distempers of our own hearts, carnal men and
women they know not their own spirits, and therefore they fling and vex upon
every affliction that does befall them, they know not what distempers are in
their hearts that may be healed by their afflictions, if it please God to give
them a sanctified use of them.

3 By knowing their own hearts, they know what they are able to manage, and by
this means they come to be Content; the Lord perhaps takes away many comforts
from them that they had before, or denies them some things that they hoped to
have got; now they by knowing their hearts know this, that they were not able
to manage such an estate, and they were not able to manage such prosperity,
God saw it, and (says a poor soul) I am in some measure convinced by looking
into mine own heart, that I was not able to ma^nage such a condition. A man
desires greedily to gripe more perhaps than he is able to ma^nage, and so
undoes himself: as country men do observe, that if they do over-stock their
Land it will quickly spoil them, and so a wise Husbandman that knows how much
his ground will bear he is not troubled that he has not so much stock as
others, why? because he knows he has not ground enough for so great a stock,
and that quiets him; so many men and women that know not their own hearts, they
would fain have a prosperous estate as others have, but if they knew their own
hearts they would know that they were not able to manage it: if one of your
little children of three or four years old should be crying for the coat of her
that is twelve or twenty years old, and say, why may not I have a coat as long
as my sisters? If she had, it would soon trip up her heels, and break her face,
but when the Child comes to understanding she is not discontented, because her
coat is not so long as her sisters, but says, my coat is fit for me, and
therein takes Content; So if we come to understanding in the School of Christ
we will not cry, why have not I such an estate as others have? the Lord sees
that I am not able to manage it, and I see it my self by the knowing of mine
own heart. You shall have children if they see but a knife, they will cry for
it because they know not their strength and that they are not able to manage
it, but you know they are not able to manage it, and therefore you will not
give it them, and when they come to so much understanding as to know that they
are not able to manage it, they will not cry for it; so we would not cry for
such and such things if we knew that we were not able to manage them: when you
vex and fret for what you have not, I may say to you as Christ says, you know
not of what spirits you are. It was a speech of Oecolampadius to Parillus,
says he (when they were speaking about his extreme poverty,) Not so poor,
though I have been very poor, yet I would be poorer, I could be willing to be
poorer than I am, for the truth is (as if he should say) the Lord knew that
that was more suitable to me, and I knew that my own heart was such, that a poor
condition was more suitable to me than a rich; so certainly would we say if we
knew our own hearts, that such and such a condition is better for me than if it
had been otherwise.

The Seventh lesson, Is the burden of a prosperous estate. Such a one that
comes into Christ's School to be instructed in this Art, never comes to attain
to any great skill in this Art until he comes to understand the burden that is
in a prosperous estate.

Object. You will say, What burden is there in a prosperous estate.

Answ. Yes certainly a great burden, and there needs a great strength to bear
it: as men had need of strong brains that can bear strong wine, so they had
need of strong spirits that are able to bear prosperous conditions, and not to
do themselves hurt; there is a fourfold burden in a prosperous estate. Many men
and women look at the shine and glittering of prosperity, but they little think
of the burden, but there is a fourfould burden.

1 There Is A burden of trouble. A rose has it is prickles, and so the Scripture
says that he that will be rich pierces himself through with many sorrows, 1 Timothy 6.10. If a man's heart be set upon it that he must be rich, and he will be
rich, such a man will pierce himself through with many sorrows; he looks upon
the delight and glory of riches that appears outwardly, but he considers not
what piercing sorrows he may meet withal in them: The consideration of the
trouble in a prosperous condition I have diverse times thought of, and I cannot
tell by what similitude to express it better than by traveling in some
champian country, where round about is very fair and sandy ground, and you see
there a Town a great way off in a bottom, and you think, Oh how bravely is that
Town seated, but when you come and ride into the Town, you shall ride through a
durty lane and through a company of fearful durty holes, and you could not see
the durty lane and holes when you were two or three miles off; so sometimes we
look upon the prosperity of men and think such a man lives bravely and
comfortably, but if we did but know what troubles he meets withal in his
family, in his estate, in his dealings with men, we would not think his
condition so happy. One may have a very fine new shoe, but no body knows where
it pinches him but he that has it on; so you think such and such men are
happy, but they may have many troubles that you little think of.

2 There is a burden of danger in it. Men that are in a prosperous condition
they are in a great deal of danger, you see some times in the evening when you
light up your candles, the mothes and the gnats will be flying up and down in
the candle, but they scorch their wings, and there they fall down dead; so there
is a great deal of danger in a prosperous estate, those men that are set upon a
Pinnacle on high, these men they are in greater danger than other men are. Honey
we know does invite Bees and Wasps unto it, and so the sweet of prosperity does
invite the Devil and temptation. Men that are in a prosperous estate are
subject to many temptations that other men are not subject to. The Scripture
calls the Devil Beelzebub, that is the god of flies, and so Beelzebub come where
the honey of prosperity is, they are in very great danger of temptations that
are in a prosperous condition. The dangers of men that are in a prosperous
estate that have more than others, should be considered of by those that are
lower, think with thy self, though they be above me, yet they are in more
danger than I am, the tal trees are more shattered a great deal than low
shrubs, so you know the ship that has all the sails up, the top sail and all
in a storm, this is in more danger than that that has all the sails drawn in:
And so men that have their Top-gallant, and all up and brave, they are more
like to be drowned, drowned in perdition than other men are; and therefore you
know what the Scripture says, how hard it is for rich men to go into the
kingdom of Heaven: such a text should make poor people to be contented with
their estates. We have a notable example for that in the Children of Kohath,
you shall find that they were in a more excellent estate than the other of the
Levites, but they were in more danger than the other, and more trouble.

First, That the Children of Kohath were in a higher condition than other of
the Levites, that I Will show you out of the fourth of Numb. 4. verse. there you
shall find what their condition was. This shall be the service of the sons of
Kohath in the Tabernacle of the Congregation about the most holy things. Mark,
the Levites were exercised about holy things; but the sons of Kohath, their
service was about the most holy things of all: and you shall find in the 21. of
Joshua, verse. 10. That God did honor the sons of Kohath in a more special
manner than he did honor the other Levites, which honor the Children of Aaron
(being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the Children of Levi)
had, for theirs was the first lot, and they were preferred before the other
families of Levi, those that were employed in the most honorable employment,
they had the most honorable Lot, the first Lot fell to them: thus you see God
honored the Children of the Kohathites. But (might other Levites say) how has
God preferred this family before us? They were honored more than the other
were: But now, mark their burden that comes in with their honor, and that I Will
show you out of two Scriptures, the first is, Numb. 7.6, 7, 8, 9. And Moses
took the Wagons and the Oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. Two wagons and
four oxen be gave unto the sons of Gershom, according to their service: and
four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto
their service, under the hand of Ithamer the son of Aaron the Priest. But says
he in the 9. verse. Unto the sons of Kohath he gave none; because the service of
the Sanctuary that belonged unto them, was, that they should bear upon their
shouldiers. Mark, the other Levites had oxen, and wagons given to them, to ease
them of their service: but (says he) to the sons of Kohath he gave none, but
they should bear their service upon their shoulders; and that is the reason why
God was so displeased, because that they would have more ease in Gods service
than God would have them, for whereas they should carry it upon their
shoulders, they would carry it upon a cart: Mark here, you see the first burden
that they had, beyond what the other Levites had. And those indeed that are in
more honorable places than others, those that are under them think not of
their burden that they are to carry upon their shoulders, when as others have
means to ease them; and many times those that are employed in the Ministry, or
Majestracie, that sit at the stern to order the great Affairs of the
Commonwealth and State, you think they live bravely: they lie awake when you
are asleep; if you knew the burden that lies upon their spirits, you would
think that your labor and burden were very little in comparison of theirs.

2. There Is another burden of danger more than the rest, and that you shall
find in Numb. 4.17. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, Cut
ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites,
but thus do unto them that they may live and not die: When they approach unto
the most holy things, Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them every one
to his service and to his burden; but they shall not go in to see when the holy
things are covered, lest they die. Mark this text: says the Lord to Moses and
Aaron, Cut ye not off the tribe of the family of the Kohathites from among the
Levites. Cut them not off, why? what had they done? had they done any thing
amiss? no, they had not done any thing that provoked God: but the meaning is
this; Take a great care of the family of the Kohathites, to instruct them in
their duty that they were to do; for (says God) they are in a great deal of
danger, being to serve in the most holy things: if they should go in to see the
holy things more than God would have them, it is as much as their lives are
worth, and therefore if you should but neglect them, and not inform them
thoroughly in their duty they would be undone: (says God) they are to administer
in the most holy things, and if they should but dare to presume to do any thing
otherwise than God would have them about those services, it would cost them
their lives; and therefore be not you careless of them, for if you neglect
them you will be a means of cutting them off. Thus you see the danger that the
family of the Kohathites were in; they were preferred before others, but they
were in more danger. So you think there are such men in a parish that bear the
sway, and are employed in public service, and they carry all before them; but
you consider not their danger. And so the Ministers, they stand in the
forefront of all the spite and malice of ungodly men: indeed God imployes
them in honorable service, and that service that the Angels would take delight
in; but though the service be honorable, above the employment of other works,
yet the burden of danger, that likewise is greater than the danger of men that
are in an inferior condition. Now when the Soul comes to get wisdom from
Christ to think of the danger that it is in, then it will be content with that
low estate in which it is. A poor man that is in a low condition, thinks, I am
low, and others are raised, but I know not what their burden is: and so, if he
be rightly instructed in the school of Christ he coms to be contented.

3. I a prosperous estate there is the burden of duty. You look only at the
sweet and comfort that they have, and the honor and respect that they have
that are in a prosperous condition; but you must consider of the duty that they
owe to God: God requires more duty at their hands than at yours, you are ready
to be discontented that you have not such parts and abilities as such have, but
God requires more duty of them that have more parts, God requires more duty of
them that have greater estates than of you that have not such estates: Oh you
would feign have the honor, but can you carry the burden of the duty.

4. The last is, The burden of account in a prosperous estate. There is a great
account that they are to give to God that enjoy great estates and a prosperous
condition: Now we are all stewards, and one is a steward to a meaner man,
perhaps but an ordinary Knight; another is a steward to a Nobleman, an Earl:
now the steward of the meaner man, he has not so much as the other has under
his hand: now shall he be discontented because there comes not so much under
his hand as under the others? No thinks he I have less, and I am to give the
less account: So your account in comparison of the Ministers and Magistrates
will be nothing; you are to give an account of your own souls, and so are they,
you are to give an account for your own family, and so are they, but you are
not to give account for Congregations, and for Towns, and Cities, and
Countries. You think of Princes and Kings, Oh! what a glorious condition they
are in. But what do you think of a King to give account for all the disorder
and wickedness in a Kingdom that he possibly might have prevented? What
abundance of glory might a Prince bring to God if so be that he bent his soul
and all his thoughts to lift up the Name of God in a Kingdom; now what God
loses for want of this, that King, Prince, or Governor he must give an account
for. It Is a speech of Chrysostom in that place of the Hebrews, where it is said
that men must give an account for their souls, he wonders that any men in
public place can be saved, because their account is so great that they are to
give. And I remember I have read a speech of Philip that was King of Spain,
(though the story says of him, that he had such a natural conscience, that he
professed he would not do any thing against his conscience, no not in secret for
the gaining of the world, yet when this man was to die) Oh says he, that I had
never been a King; Oh that I had lived a sollitary and private life all my
days; then should I have died a great deal more securely, I should with more
confidence have gone before the Throne of God to give my account: but here is
the fruit of my kingdom, that I had all the glory of it, it has made my
account to be harder to give to God: and thus he cries out when he was to die.
And therefore you that live in private conditions remember this, If you come
into Christ's School, and be taught this lesson, you will be quiet in your
afflictions, or private estate, in regard your account is not so great as
others. It Is a speech I remember I have met withal in Latimers Sermons that he
was wont to use, The half is more than the whole. That is, when a man is in a
mean condition, he is but half way toward the height of prosperity that
others are in: yet says he, this is more safe though it be a meaner condition
than others. Those that are in a high and prosperous condition there is anexed
to it the burden of trouble, and of danger and of duty, and of account. And
thus you see how Christ trains up his Scholars in his School, and though they
be weak otherwise, yet by his Spirit he gives them wisdom to understand these
aright.

The Eight lesson is this, Christ teaches them what a great and dreadful evil
it is to be given up to ones hearts desires. The understanding this lesson that
it is a most dreadful evil, one of the most hideous and fearful evils that
can befall any man upon the face of the earth, for God to give him up to his
hearts desires: when the soul understands this once, and together with it, (for
it goes along together) that spiritual judgments are more fearful than any
outward judgments in the world, the understanding of this will teach any one to
be content in Gods crossing of them in their desires. Thou art crossed in thy
desires, now thou art discontented and vexed and fretted at it, is that thy only
misery that thou art crossed in thy desires? no no, thou art infinitely mistaken,
the greatest misery of all is for God to give thee up to thy hearts lusts and
desires, to give thee up to thine own counsels: so you have it in Psalm, 81.11,
12. But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would none of me
[what then?] So I gave them up unto their own hearts lusts, and they walked in
their own counsels. Oh says Bernard let me not have such a misery as that is,
for to give me what I would have, to give me my hearts desires, it is one of
the most hideous judgments in the world for a man to be given up to his hearts
desires. We have not indeed in Scripture any certain evident sign of a
reprobate, we cannot say except we knew a man had committed the sin against the
Holy Ghost, that he is a reprobate, for we know not what God may work upon him,
but the nearest of all and the blackest sign of a reprobate is this, for God to
give up a man to his hearts desires, all the pain of diseases, all the
calamities that can be thought of in the world, are no judgments in comparison
of this, for a man to be given up to his hearts desires; now when the Soul
comes to understand this, the Soul then cries out, why am I so troubled that I
have not my desires? There is nothing that God conveys his wrath more through
than a prosperous estate. I remember I have read of a Jewish Tradition that
they say of Vzziah, when God struck Vzziah with a Leprosy, they say that the
beams of the Sun was darted upon the forehead of Vzziah, and he was struck
with a Leprosy by the darting of the beams of the Sun upon his forehead; the
Scripture says, Indeed the Priests looked upon him; but they say there was a
special light and beam of the Sun upon the forehead that did discover the
Leprosy to the Priests, and they say it was the way of conveying of it.
Whether that were true or no, I am sure this is true, that the strong beams of
the Sun of prosperity upon many men makes them to be leprous; would any poor
man in the country have been discontented that he was not in Vzziahs
condition? he was a great King, I but there was the Leprosy in his forehead,
the poor man may say, though I live meanly in the country yet I thank God my
body is whole and sound, would not any man rather have russet and skins of
beasts to cloth him with, than to have satin and velvet that should have the
Plague in it; The Lord conveys the plague of his curse through prosperity, as
much as through any thing in the world, and therefore the soul coming to
understand this, this makes it to be quiet and content.

And then spiritual judgments are the greatest judgments of all; the Lord
lays such an affliction upon my outward estate, but what if he had taken away
my life, a man's health is a greater mercy than his estate, and you that are
poor people you should consider of that; but is the health of a man's body
better than his estate? what is the health of a man's soul? that is a great deal
better; the Lord has inflicted external judgments, but he has not inflicted
spiritual judgments upon thee, he has not given thee up to hardness of
heart, and taken away the spirit of prayer from thee in thine afflicted estate,
Oh then be of good comfort though there be outward afflictions upon thee, yet
thy soul, thy more excellent part is not afflicted. Now when the soul comes to
understand this, that here lies the sore wroth of God to be given up to a man's
desires, and for spiritual judgments to be upon a man, this quiets him, and
contents him, though outward afflictions be upon him; perhaps one of a man's
children has the fit of an ague, or the toothache, but perhaps his next
neighbor has the plague, or all his Children are dead of the plague, now
shall he be so discontented, because his Children have the toothache when his
neighbors Children are dead? now think thus, Lord thou have laid an afflicted
condition upon me, but Lord thou have not given me the plague of a hard heart.
Now take these Eight things before mentioned, and lay them together, and you
may well apply that Scripture in the 29. of Isa. the last verse, says the text
there, They also that erred in spirit, shall come to understanding; and they
that murmured shall learn doctrine. Has there bin any of you (as I fear many
may be found) that have erred in spirit, even in regard of this truth that now
we are preaching of, and many that have murmured, Oh that this day you might
come to understand, that Christ would bring you into his School, and seach you
understanding, And they that murmured shall learn doctrine: what doctrine shall
they learn? These Eight Doctrines that I have opened to you. And if you will
but thoroughly study these lessons that I have set before your eyes: It will be
a special help and means to cure your murmurings against, and repinings at the
hand of God: And so you will come to learn Christian Contentment. The Lord
teach you thoroughly by his Spirit these lessons of Contentment.

SERMON VI.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. Aug. 31: 1645.
For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.


I Shall only add one lesson more in the learning of Contentment, and then I
shall come to the Fourth Head, The excellency of Contentment.

The Ninth and last lesson that Christ teaches those that he does instruct in
this Art of Contentment, It is the right knowledge of Gods providence, and
therein are these Four things.

1 The universality of providence, that the Soul must be thoroughly instructed
in to come to this Art, to understand the universality of providence, that is;
how the providence of God goes through the whole world, extends it is self to
every thing: Not only that God by his providence does rule the world, and
govern all things in general, but that it reaches to every particular, not
only to Kingdoms, to order the great affairs of Kingdoms, but it reaches to
every man's family, it reaches to every person in the family, it reaches to
every condition, yea to every passage, to every thing that falls out concerning
thee in every particular, not one hair falls from thy head, not a Sparrow to
the ground without the providence of God. There Is nothing befalls thee good or
evil, but there is a providence of the infinite eternal First-Being in that
thing, and therein indeed is Gods infiniteness, that it reaches to the least
things, to the least worm that is under thy feet: Then much more it reaches
unto thee that art a rational creature, the providence of God is more special
toward rational creatures than any others: The understanding in a spiritual
way the universality of providence in every particular passage from morning to
night every day; that there is not any thing that does befall thee but there is a
hand of God in it, it is from God, it is a mighty furtherance to Contentment.
Every man will grant the truth of the thing that it is so, but as the Apostle
says in Heb. 11.3. By faith we understand that the worlds were made, by faith
we understand it: why by faith? we can understand by reason that no finit thing
can be from it self, And therefore that the world could not be of it is self,
but we can understand it by faith in another manner than by reason. So
whatsoever we understand of God in way of providence, yet when Christ does take
us into his School we come to understand it by faith in a better manner than we
do by reason.

2 The efficacy that there is in providence; that is, That the providence of
God goes on in all things with strength and power, and it is not to be altered
by our power; let us be discontented and vexed and troubled, and fret, and rage,
yet we must not think to alter the course of providence by our discontent. Some
of Jobs friends said to him, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall
the rock be removed out of his place? Job, 18.4. when they saw him to be
impatient. So I may say to every discontented impatient heart, what shall the
providence of God change it is course for thee? Do thou think it such a weak
thing that because it does not please thee it must alter it is course? be thou
content or not content, the providence of God will go on, it has an efficacy
of power, of virtue, to carry all things before it: Can thou make one hair
black or white with all the stir that thou keep? When you are in a ship at
Sea that has all her sails spread with a full gale of wind, and swiftly
sailing; can you make it stand still with running up and down in the ship? No
more can you make the providence of God to alter and change it is course with
your vexing and fretting, but it will go on with power do what thou can. Do
but understand the power and efficacy of providence and it will be a mighty
means for the helping to learn this lesson of Contentment.

3 The infinite variety of the works of providence, and yet the order of
things, one working toward another; there is infinite variety of the works of
God in an ordinary providence, and yet all work in an ordinary way; we put
these two together; for God in the way of his providence causes a thousand
thousand things one to depend upon another, there are infinite several wheels
(as I may so say) in the works of providence, all the works that ever God did
from all eternity or ever will do, put them all together, and all make up but
one work, and they have been as several wheels that have had their orderly
motion to attain the end that God from all eternity has appointed: We indeed
look at things by pieces, we look at one particular and do not consider the
reference that one thing has to another, but God he looks at all things at
once, and sees the reference that one thing has to another: As a child that
looks upon a clock, looks first upon one wheel, and then upon another wheel, he
looks not at all together or the dependence that one has upon another, but the
workman has his eyes upon all together and sees the dependence of all one upon
another, and the art that there is in the dependence of one upon another; so it
is in Gods providence. Now observe how this works to Contentment; where there
is such a passage of providence befalls me, that is one wheel, and it may be if
this wheel should be stopped, there might a thousand other wheels come to be
stopped by this: as in a clock, stop but one wheel and you stop every wheel,
because they have dependence one upon another: so when God has ordered a thing
for the present to be thus and thus, how do thou know how many things do
depend upon this thing? God may have some work that he has to do twenty years
hence that may depend upon this passage of providence, that falls out this day,
or this week. And here (by the way) we may see a great deal of evil that there
is in discontent, for thou would have Gods providence altered in such and
such a particular, indeed if it were only in that particular, and that had
reference to nothing else it were not so much, but by thy desire to have thy
will in such a particular, it may be thou would cross God in a thousand
things that he has to bring about, because it is possible there may be a
thousand things depend upon that one thing that thou would fain have to be
otherwise than it is, just as if a child should cry out and say, let but that
one wheel stop, though he says but one wheel, yet if that stop, it is as much
as if he should say they must all stop; so in providence, let but this one
passage of providence stop, it is as much as if a thousand stopped: Let me
therefore be quiet and content, for though I be crossed in some one particular God
attains his end, at least his end may be furthered in a thousand things by this
one thing that I am crossed in; therefore let a man consider this is an act of
providence, and how do I know what God is about to do, and how many things
depend upon this providence? Now we are willing to suffer our friends will to
be crossed in one thing, so that our friend may attain to what he desires in a
thousand things; if thou have a love and friendship to God, be willing to be
crossed in some few things, that the Lord may have his work go on in the
universal, in a thousand of other things. Now that is the Third thing to be
understood in Gods providence, that Christ does learn those that he teaches in
the Art of Contentment.

4 Christ teaches them the knowledge of providence, that is, The knowledge of
Gods usual way in his dealings with his people more particularly. The other is,
the knowledge of God in his providence in general: But the right understanding
of the way of God in his providence toward his people and Saints, is a notable
lesson to help us in the Art of Contentment. If we come once to know a man's way
and course we may better suit and be contented to live with him, than before we
come to know his way and course: as when a man comes to live in a society with
men and women, it may be the men and women may be good, but till a man comes to
know their way and course and disposition, many things may fall very cross,
and we think they are very hard, but when we come to be acquainted with their
way and spirit, then we can suit and cotton with them very well; and the reason
of our trouble is, because we do not understand their way. So it is with you,
those that are but as strangers to God, and do not understand the way of God,
they are troubled with the providence of God, and they think them very strange
and cannot tell what to make of them, because they understand not the ordinary
course and way of God toward his people. If a stranger sometimes comes into a
family and sees such and such things done, he wonders what the matter is, but
those that are acquainted with it, it troubles them not at all. So servants,
when they come first together and know not one another, it may be they are
froward and discontented, but when they come to be aquainted with one another
ways, then they are more contented: just so it is when we come first to
understand Gods ways.

Object. But you will say, What do you understand by Gods ways?

Answ: By that I mean these Three things. And when we come to know them we
shall not wonder so much at the providence of God, but be quiet and contented
with them.

1. The First thing is this, Gods ordinary course is, that his people in this
world should be in an afflicted condition: God has revealed in his Word, and
we may there find he has set down to be his ordinary way even from the
beginning af the world to this day, (but more especially in the times of the
Gospel,) that his people here should be in an afflicted condition. Now men that
do not understand this, they stand and wonder to hear of the people of God that
they are afflicted, and the enemies prosper in their way; for those that seek
God in his way, and seek for Reformation, for them to be afflicted and routed
and spoiled, and the enemies to prevail, they wonder at it: but now, one that
is in the School of Christ, he is taught by Jesus Christ that God by his
eternal Counsels has set this to be his course and way, to bring up his people
in this world in an afflicted condition, and therefore says the Apostle,
Account it not strange concerning the fiery trial. 1 Pet. 4.12. We are not
therefore to be discontented with it seeing God has set such a course and way,
and we know such is the will of God that it should be so.

The Second thing that is in Gods way is this, Usually when God intends the
greatest mercy to any of his people, he does bring them into the lowest
condition. God does seem to go quite cross and work in a contrary way; when he
intends the greatest mercies to his people he does first usually bring them
into very low conditions, if it be a bodily mercy, an outward mercy that he
intends to bestow he uses to bring them bodily low, and outwardly low, if it
be a mercy in their estates that he intends to bestow, he brings them low in
that and then raises them; and in their names he brings them low there, and
then raises them, and in their Spirits God does ordinarily bring their Spirits
low and then raises their spirits, usually the people of God before the
greatest comforts have the greatest afflictions and sorrows, now those that
understand not Gods ways they think that when God brings his people into sad
conditions, that God leaves and forsakes them, and that God does intend no
great matter of good to them; but now a Child of God that is instructed in this
way of God, he is not troubled; my condition is very low, but (says he) this
is Gods way when he intends the greatest mercy, to bring men under the greatest
afflictions. When he intended to raise Joseph to be the Second in the Kingdom,
God cast him into a dungeon a little before. So when God intended to raise
David and set him upon the Throne, he made him to be hunted as a partrige in
the mountain, 2 Samuel 26.20. God went this way with his Son; Christ himself went
into glory by suffering, Heb. 2.20. And if God deal so with his own Son, much
more with his people; as a little before break of day you shall observe it is
darker than it was any time before; so God does use to make our conditions
darker a little before the mercy come. When God bestowed the last great mercy
at Nazby, we were in a very low condition, God knew what he had to do
beforehand, he knew that his time was coming for great mercies; it is the way
of God to do so. Be but instructed aright in this course and tract that God
uses to walk in; and that will help us to Contentment exceedingly.

The Third thing that there is in Gods way and course is this, It is the way of
God to work by contraries, to turn the greatest evil into the greatest good.
To grant great good after great evil is one thing, and to turn great evils into
the greatest good that is another; and yet that is Gods way, the greatest good
that God intends for his people, many times he works it out of the greatest
evil; the greatest light is brought out of the greatest darkness: and Luther
(I remember) has a notable expression for this, (says he) it is the way of
God, he does humble that he might exalt, he does kill that he might make alive,
he does confound that he might glorify; this is the way of God (says he:) but
says says he, Every one does not understand this, this is the Art of Arts,
and the Science of Sciences, the knowledge of knowledges to understand this,
that God does use when he will bring life, he does bring it out of death, he
brings joy out of sorrow, and he brings prosperity out of adversity, yea, and
many times he brings grace out of sin, that is, makes use of sin to work
furtherance of grace; it is the way of God to bring good out of evil; not only
to overcome the evil, but to make the evil to work toward the good: here is the
way of God: now when the soul comes to understand this, it will take away our
murmuring and bring Contentment into our spirits: But I fear there are but few
that understand it aright, perhaps they read of such things, and hear such
things in a Sermon, but they are not by Jesus Christ instructed in this, that
this is the way of God, To bring the greatest good out of the greatest evil.

Now, thus having dispach'd the Third Head, the Lessons that we are to learn;
we come to the Fourth, and that is, The excellency of this Grace of
Contentment: And there is a great deal of excellency in Contentment; that is a
kind of Lesson too for us to learn. And this Head likewise will be somewhat
long.
Says the Apostle, I have learned. As if he should say, Blessed be God for
this: Oh! it is a mercy of God to me that I have learned this lesson, I find so
much good in this Contentment, that I would not for a world but have it: (I
have learned it says he.)

Now the very Heathens had a sight of a great excellency that there is in
Contentment: I remember I have read of Antistenes a Philosopher, that desired
of his gods, (speaking after the heathenish way) nothing in this world to make
his life happy, but Contentment; and if he might have any thing that he would
desire to make his life happy, he would ask of them, that he might have the
spirit of Socrates, that he might have such a spirit as Socrates had, to be
able to bear any wrong, any injuries that he met withal, and to continue in a
quiet temper of spirit whatsoever befell him; for that was the temper of
Socrates, whatever befell him he continued the same man, whatever cross befell
him no body could perceive any alteration of his spirit though never so great
crosses did befall him. This a Heathen did attain to by the strength of Nature,
and a common work of the spirit: Now this Antistenes saw such an excellency in
this spirit: As when God said to Solomon, What shall I give thee? he asked of
God wisdom: so says he, If the gods should put it to me to know what I would
have, I would desire this thing, that I might have the spirit of Socrates: he
saw a great excellency that there was in this. And certainly a Christian may
see abundance of excellency in it: I shall labor to set it out to you in this
Sermon that you may be in love with this Grace of Contentment.

In the First place, By Contentment we come to give God that worship that is
due to him: It is a special part of Divine worship that we owe to God, if we be
content in a Christian way, according as has been opened to you; I say it is a
special part of the Divine worship that the creature owes to the infinite
Creator, in that I do tender that respect that is due from me to the Creator.
The word that the Greeks have that signifies to worship, it is as much as to
come and crouch before another, as a dog should come crouching unto you, and be
willing to lie down at your feet; so the creature in the apprehension of its
own baseness, and the infinite Excellency that there is in God above it; when
it comes to worship God, it comes and crouches to this God, and it lies down at
the feet of God, then does the creature worship God. When you see a dog come
crouching to you, and you can make him with holding your hand over him to lie
down at your feet; then consider, thus should you do before the Lord, you
should come crouching to him, and lie down at his feet even upon your backs or
bellies, to lie down in the dust before him, so as to be willing that he should
do with you what he will; as sometimes you may turn a dog this way or that way
up and down with the hand, and there he lies before you, according to your
showing him with your hand: So when the creature shall come and lie down thus
before the Lord, then a Creature worships God, does tender you that worship
that is due to God. Now in what disposition of heart do we thus ^ouch to God
more, than when we have this Contentation in all conditions that God disposed
us unto? This is a crouching unto Gods dispose, to be like the poor woman of
Canaan, when Christ said, it is not fit to give Childrens meat to dogs, but
(says she) the dogs have crumbs. I am a dog I confess, I but let me have but a
crum. And so when the soul shall be in such a disposition as to lie down and
say, Lord I am but as a dog, yet let me have a crum, then does it highly honor
God. It may be some of you have not your table spread as others have, but God
gives you crumbs; now says the poor woman, dogs have crumbs, and when you can
find your hearts thus subjecting unto God, to be but as a dog, and can be
Contented and bless God for any crum: I say this is a great worship of God,
you worship God by this more than when you come to hear a Sermon, or spend half
an hour, or an hour in prayer, or when you come to receive a Sacrament; These
are the acts of Gods worship, I but these are but external acts of worship, to
hear, and pray, and receive Sacraments: But now this is the Soul-worship, to
subject its self thus to God. You that often will worship God by Hearing, and
Praying, and receiving Sacraments, and yet afterward will be froward and
discontented, know, that God regards not that worship, he will have the
soul-worship in this subjecting of the soul to God. Observe it I beseech you,
in active obedience, there we worship God by doing that that pleases God, but
by passive obedience we do as well worship God by being pleased with that that
God does. Now when I perform a duty, I worship God, I do what pleases God: why
should I not as well worship God when I am pleased with what God does? As it
was said of Christ's obedience, Christ was active in his passive obedience, and
passive in his active obedience: So the Saints they are passive in their active
obedience; they are first passive in their reception of grace, and then active:
And when they come to passive obedience they are active, they put forth grace
in active obedience, when they perform actions to God, then says the Soul, Oh!
that I could do that that pleases God, when they come to suffer any cross, Oh
that what God does might please me. I labor to do what pleases God, and I
labor that what God does shall please me, here is a Christian indeed that shall
endeavor both these; now this is but one side of a Christian, to endeavor to
do what pleases God, but you must as well endeavor to be pleased with what God
does, and so you shall come to be a complete Christian when you can do both.
And that is the first thing in the excellency of this Grace of Contentment.

The Second thing in the opening of this excellency of Contentment is, That in
Contentment there is much exercise of Grace, There is much strength of Grace,
yea there is much beauty of Grace in Contentment, there is much exercise of
Grace, strength of Grace, and beauty of Grace, I put all these together.

1 Much exercise of Grace, There is a composition of Grace in Contentment,
there is faith, and there is humility, and love, and there is patience, and
there is wisdom, and there is hope, all graces almost are compounded, it is an
oil that has the ingredients of all kind of graces, and therefore though you
cannot see the particular grace, yet in this oil you have it all; God sees the
Graces of his Spirit exercised in a special manner, and this pleases God at the
heart to see the Graces of his Spirit exercised. In some one action that you do
you may exercise some one grace especially, but now in Contentment you exercise
a great many graces at once.

2 There is a great deal of strength of Grace in Contentment, It argues a great
deal of strength in the body, the body to be able to endure hard weather and
whatsoever falls out, and yet not to be much altered by it; so it argues
strength of Grace to be content: You that complain of weakness of memory, and
weakness of parts, you cannot do what others do in other things, but have you
this gracious heart-contentment that has been opened to you; I know that you
have attained to strength of Grace in this, when it is so spiritual as has
been opened to you in the explication of this point. As it is with a man's
brain, if a man be distempered in his body and has many obstructions in his
body, has an ill stomach, and his spleen and liver obstructed, and yet for all
this his brain is not distempered, it is an argument of a great strength of
brain, and though there be many ill fumes that rises from his corrupt stomach,
yet still his brain is not distempered but he continues in the free exercise of
the use of his reason and understanding; every one may understand that this man
has a very strong brain, that such things shall not distemper him, whereas
other people that have a weak brain, if they do not digest but one meals meat,
the fumes that do arise from their stomachs, does distemper their brain and
makes them unfit for every thing, whereas you shall have others that have
strong heads, and strong brains, though their stomachs be ill that they do not
digest meat, yet still they have the free use of their brain, this argues
strength: So it is in a man's spirit, you shall have many that have weak
spirits, and if they have any ill fumes, if accidents befall them, you shall
presently have them out of temper, but you shall have other men that though
things do fume up yet still they keep in a steady-way, and have the use of
reason and of other graces, and possess their Souls with patience. As I
remember it is reported of the Eagle, it is not like other fowls, other fowls
when they are hungry make an noise, but the Eagle is never heard to make an
noise though it wants food, and it is from the magnitude of his spirit that it
will not make such complaints as other fowls will do when they want food, it is
because it is above hunger, and above thirst: So it is argument of a gracious
magnitude of spirit that whatsoever befalls it, yet it is not always whyning
and complaining so as others are, but goes on still in it is way and course, and
blesses God and keeps in a constant tenor whatsoever thing befalls it, such
things as causes others to be dejected and fretted and vexed, and takes away
all the comfort of their lives, it makes no alteration at all in the spirits of
these men and women, I say this is a sign of a great deal of strength of Grace.

3 It Is also an argument of a great deal of beauty of Grace. It Is a speech that
Seneca a Heathen once had, says he, When you go abroad into groves and woods;
and there you see the tallness of the trees and their shadows, it strikes a
kind of awful fear of a Deity in you, and when you see the vast rivers and
fountains, and deep waters that strikes a kind of fear of a God in you but
(says he) do you see a man that is quiet in tempests, and that lives happily
in the midst of adversities, why do not you worship that man? he does think
him a man even to be honored that shall be quiet and live a happy life though
in the midst of adversities. The glory of God appears here more than in any
of his works; there is no works that God has made, the Sun Moon and Stars and
all the world wherein so much of the glory of God does appear, as in a man that
lives quietly in the midst of adversity. That was that that covinc'd the
King, when he saw the three Children could walk in the midest of the fiery
furnace and not be touched, the King was mightily convinced by this, that surely
their God was a great God indeed, and that they were highly beloved of their
God that could walk in the midst of the furnace and not be touched, whereas the
others that came but to the mouth of the furnace were devoured, so when a
Christian can walk in the midst of fiery trials, and not his garments singed,
but have comfort and joy in the midst of all (as Paul in the stocks) can sing,
(that wrought upon the jaylour:) so it will convince men when they see the
power of grace in the midst of afflictions, such afflictions as would make
others to rore under them, yet they can behave themselves in a gracious and
holy manner; Oh it is the glory of a Christian. It is that that is said to be
the glory of Christ, (for so by Interpreters it is thought to be meant of
Christ) In Micah, 5.5. And this man (the text says) shall be the peace when
the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces.
This man shall be the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land; for one
to be in peace when there is no enemies it is no great matter, but says the
text when the Assyrian shall come into our land, then this man shall be the
peace; that is, when all shall be in an hubbub and uprore yet then this man shall
be peace. That Is the trial of grace when you find Jesus Christ in your hearts
to be peace when the Assyrian shall come into the land. You may think you find
peace in Christ when you have no outward troubles, but is Christ your peace
when the Assyrian comes into the land, when the enemy comes? Suppose you should
hear the enemy come marching to the City and had taken the works, and were
plundering, what would be your peace? Jesus Christ would be peace to the soul
when the enemy comes into the City, and into your houses; If there be any of
you that have been where the enemy has come, what has been the peace of your
souls? That that is said of Christ may be applied to this grace of Contentment,
when the Assyrian, the plunderers, the enemies, when any affliction, trouble,
distress does befall such a heart, then this grace of Contentment brings peace
to the soul; at that time brings peace to their soul when the Assyrian comes
into the land: The grace of Contentment it is an excellent grace, ther^'s much
beauty, much strength in it, there is a great deal of worth in this grace, and
therefore be in love with it.

The Third thing in the excellency of Contentment is this, By Contentment the
soul is fitted to receive mercy, and to do service, I Will put those two
together, Contentment makes the soul fit to receive mercy, and to do service;
no man or woman in the world is so fit for to receive the Grace of God, and to
do the work of God as those that have contented spirits.

1 Those are fitted to receive mercy from the Lord that are contented: As now,
if you would have a vessel to take in any licquor, you must hold the vessel
still, if the vessel stir and shake up and down you cannot power in any thing,
but you will bid hold still that you may power it in and not loose any; so if we
would be the vessels to receive Gods mercy, and would have the Lord power in his
mercy to us, we must have quiet still hearts, we must not have hearts hurrying
up and down in trouble discontent and vexing, but we must have still and quiet
hearts if we would receive mercy from the Lord: If a child throws and flings up
and down for a thing, you will not give it him then when he cries so, but first
you will have the child quiet, though perhaps you do intend the child shall
have the thing he cries for, but you will not give it him till he is quiet and
comes and stands still before you and is contented without it and then you will
give it him: and truly so does the Lord deal with us, (for our dealing, with
him are just as your froward childrens are with you) as soon as you would have
a thing from God if you have it not you are disquieted presently and all in an
upprore (as it were) in your spirits: God intends mercy to you, but says God
you shall not have it yet, I will see you quiet first, and then in the
quietness of your hearts come to me and see what I will do with you. I appeal
to you, you that are any way acquainted with the ways of God, have you not
found this to be the way of God toward you, when you have been troubled for
want perhaps of some spiritual comfort, and your hearts were vexed at it, you
get nothing from God all that while; but now if you have got your heart into a
quiet frame, and can say, well, it is fit the Lord should do with his poor
creatures what he will, I am under his feet, and am resolved to do what I can
to honor him; and let him do with me what he will I will seek him as long as I
live, I will be content with what God gives; and whether he gives or no I will
be content; yea, are you in this frame (says God) now you shall have comfort,
now I will give you the mercy. A prisoner must not think to get off his fetters
by pulling and tearing, he may gall his flesh and rend it to the very bone,
certainly he will be unfettered never the sooner, but if he would have his
fetters taken off he must quietly give up himself to some man to take them off;
If a beggar after he has knocked once or twice at the door and you come not,
and thereupon he is vexed and troubled and thinks much that you let him stand a
little while without any thing, you think that this beggar is not fit to
receive an alms, but if you hear two or three beggars at your door, and if you
hear them out of your window say, let us be content to stay, perhaps they are
busy, it is fit that we should stay, it is well if we have any thing at last, we
deserve nothing at all, and therefore we may well wait a while; you would then
quickly send them an alms; so God deals with the heart, when it is in a
disquiet way then God does not give; but when the heart lies down quietly under
Gods hand, then is the heart in a fit frame to receive mercy: Your strength
shall be to sit still (says God,) you shall not be delivered from Babylon but
by your sitting still.

2 As fit to receive mercy, So fit to do service, Oh the quiet fruits of
righteousness, the peaceable fruits of righteousness; they indeed do prosper
and multiply most when they come to be peacable fruits of righteousness. As
the Philosophers say of every thing that moves, nothing that moves but it moves
upon something that is immovable; as a thing that moves upon the earth, if the
earth were not still it could not move.

Object. The ships move upon the Sea, and that is not still.

Answ. But the Seas they move upon that which is still and immovable, there is
nothing moves but it has something immovable that does uphold it: The wheels
in a Coach they move up and down, but the exletree that moves not up and down;
so it is with the heart of a man. As they say of the Heaven, it moves up and
down upon a pole that is immovable: so it is in the heart of a man, if he will
move to do service to God he must have a steady heart within him, that must
help him to move in the service of God, those that have unsteady disquiet
spirits that have no steadfastnesse at all in them, they are not fit to do
service for God, but such as have steadfastnesse in their spirits they are men
and women fit to do any service, and that is the reason that when the Lord has
any great work for any servants of his to do, usually he does first quiet their
spirits, he does bring their spirits into a quiet sweet frame to be contented
with any thing, and then he sets them about employment.

The Fifth excellency is this, Contentment it does deliver us from abundance of
temptations. Oh the temptations that men of discontented spirits are subject
to, the Devil loves to fish in troubled waters. That Is our proverb of men and
women, their disposition is to fish in troubled waters, they say it is good
fishing in troubled waters, this is the maxim of the Devil, he loves to fish
in troubled waters, where he sees the spirits men and women troubled and vexed,
there the Devil comes, says he, there is good fishing for me, when he sees men
and women go discontented up and down and he can get them alone, then he comes
with his temptations, says he, will you suffer such a thing? take such a
shifting indirect way, do not you see how poor you are, others are brave, you
know not what you shall do against winter, to provide fuel and get bread for
you and your children, and so he tempts them to unlawful courses; this is the
special distemper that the Devil fastens upon, when he brings men and women to
give up their souls to him, it is upon discontent: That Is the ground of all
those that have been witches, and so have given up themselves to the Devil, the
rise of it has been their discontent, and therefore it is observable that
those the Devil works upon to make them witches, usually they are old and
melancholy people, and women especially, and those that are of the poorer sort,
that are discontent at home, their neighbors trouble them and vex them, and
their spirits are weak and they cannot bear it, so upon that the Devil fastens
his temptations and draws them to any thing; if they be poor, then he promises
them money, if they have revengefull spirits, then he tells them that he will
revenge them upon such and such persons, now this quiets and contents them. Oh!
there is matter of temptation for the Devil where he meets with a discontented
spirit. As Luther says of God, God does not dwell in Babylon, but in Salem,
Babylon signifies confusion, and Salem signifies peace: now God does not dwell
in spirits that are in a confusion, but he dwells in peacable and quiet spirits.
Oh if you would free your selves from temptations, labor for Contentment, It
is the peace of God that guards the heart from temptation. I remember I have
read of one Marius Curio that when he had bribes sent him, to tempt him to be
unfaithful to his Country, he was sitting at home at dinner with a dish of
turnips, and they came and promised him rewards, says he, That man that can be
contented with this fare that I have, will not be tempted with your rewards, I
thank God I am content with this fare, and as for rewards let them be offered
to those that cannot be content to dine with a dish of turnips. So the truth is
we see it apparently, that the reason why many do betray their trust, as in the
Parliament service and Kingdom, because they cannot be contented to be in a low
condition. Let a man be contented to be in a low condition, and to go meanly
clothed if God sees it fit, such a man is shot-free (as I may so say) from
thousands of temptations of the Devil, that do prevail against others to the
damning of their souls; Oh in such times as these are when men are in danger of
the loss of their estates, I say these men that have not got this grace are in
a most lamentable condition, they are in more danger for their souls then they
are for their outward estates, you think it is a sad thing to be in danger of
your outward estates that you may loose all in an night, but if you have not
this contented spirit within you, you are in more danger of the temptations of
the Devil to be plundered that way of any good, and to be led into sin; Oh when
men think thus, they must live as brave as they were wont to do, these men make
themselves a prey to the Devil; but for such as can say let God do with me what
he pleases, I am content to submit to his hand in it, the Devil will scarce
meddle with such men. It Is a notable speech of a Philosopher that lived upon
mean fare, and as he was eating herbs and roots, says one to him, If you would
but please Dionisius you need not eat herbs and roots: but he answered him
thus, If you would but be content with such mean fare you need not flatter
Dionisius. So temptations will no more prevail upon a contented man, then a
dart that is thrown against a brazen wall. That Is the Fifth particular.

The Sixth excellency is, The abundant comforts in a man's life that Contentment
will bring: Contentment will make a man's life exceeding sweet and comfortable,
nothing more than the grace of Contentment; many ways I will show how it
brings in Comfort.

1 As first, What a man has he has it in a kind of Independent way, not
depending upon any Creature for his Comfort.

2 A Contented man whose estate is low, if God raises his estate he has the
love of God in it, and then it is abundantly more sweet than if he had it and
his heart not contented: for if he had not the love of God in it, for it may be
God grants to a discontented man his desire, but he cannot say it is from love;
if a man has quieted his spirit first, and then God grant him his desire, he
may have more comfort in it, and more assurance that he has the love of God in
it.

3 This Contentment is a comfort to a man's spirit in this, that it does keep in
his comforts, and keep out whatsoever may damp his comforts, or put out the
light of them: I may compare this Grace of Contentment to a Mariners Lanthorn,
a Mariner when he is at Sea let him have never so much provision in his ship,
yet if he be thousands of leagues from land, or in a rode that he shall not
meet with a ship in three or four months, if he has never a Lanthorn in his
ship, nor nothing whereby he can keep a Candle light in a storm, he will be in
a sad condition, he would give a great deal to have a Lanthorn, or some thing
that may serve in stead of it. When a storm comes in the night, and he cannot
have any light come above-board, but is puffed out presently, his condition is
very sad: so many men can have the light of comfort when there is no storm, but
let there come but any affliction, any storm upon them their light is puffed out
presently, and what shall they do now? When the heart is furnished with this
Grace of Contentment; this Grace is (as it were) the Lanthorn, and it keeps
comfort in the spirit of a man, light in the midst of a storm and tempest. When
you have a Lanthorn in the midst of a storm you can carry a light every where
up and down the ship to the top of the Mast if you will, and yet keep it light;
so the comfort of a Christian when it is enlivened with the grace of
Contentment, it may be keept light whatever storms or tempests come, yet he can
keep light in his soul. Oh! this helps thy comforts exceeding much.

Seventhly. There is this Excellency in Contentment, that it fetches in the
comfort of those things we have not really in possession; and perhaps many that
have not outward things, have more comfort than those have that do enjoy them
themselves: As now, a man by distilling herbs, though he has not the herbs
themselves, yet having the water that is distilled out of them, he may enjoy the
benefit of the herbs: so though a man has not the real possession of such an
outward estate, an outward comfort, yet he by the grace of Contentment may
fetch it in to himself. By the art of Navigation we can fetch in the riches of
the East and West Indies to our selves; so by the art of Contentment we may
fetch in the comfort of any condition to our selves, that is, we may have that
comfort by Contentment, that we should have if we had the thing it self. There
is an notable story you have for this in Plutarch, in the life of Pyrus; one
Sineus comes to him, and would very fain have had him desist from the wars, and
not war with the Romans; says he to him, May it please your Majesty, it is
reported that the Romans are very good men of war, and if it please the gods
we do overcome them, what benefit shall we have of that Victory? Pyrhus
answered him, We shall then straight conquer all the rest of Italy with ease.
Says Sineus, Indeed it is likely which your Grace speaks: But when we have
won Italy, will then our wars end? If the Gods were pleased said Pyrhus, that
the victory were achieved, the way were then broad open for us to attain great
conquests, for who would not afterward go into Africa, and so to Carthage? But
(says Sineus) when we have all in our hands, what shall we do in the end? then
Pyrhus laughing, told him again, we will then be quiet, and take our ease, and
make feasts every day, and be as merry one with another as we can possible:
says Sineus, What lets us now to be as quiet, and merry together, fith we
enjoy that presently without further travel and trouble which we should go seek
for abroad, with such shedding of blood, and so manifest danger: Cannot you sit
down and be merry now? So a man may think, if I had such a thing, then I would
have another, and if I had that, then I should have more: and what if you had
got al your desire? then you would be content, why? you may be content now
without them. Certainly our Contentment does not consist in the getting of the
thing we desire, but in Gods fashioning our spirits to our conditions: There Is
some men that have not a foot of ground of their own, yet will live better than
other men that are heirs to a great deal of land. I have known it in the
country sometimes, that a man lives upon his own land, and yet lives very
poorly, but you shall have another man that shall farm his land, and yet by his
good husbandry, and by his care shall live better sometimes than he that has
the land of his own: so a man by this art of Contentment may live better
without an estate than another man can of an estate: Oh! it adds exceeding much
to the comfort of a Christian: and that I may show it farther, there is more
comfort even in grace of Contentment than there is in any possessions
whatsoever; a man has more comfort in being content without a thing, than he
can have in the thing that he in a discontented way does desire.

You think, if I had such a thing, then I should be content. I say, There is
more good in Contentment, than there is in the thing that you would fain have
to cure your discontent, and that I shall open in diverse particulars, As thus,

1. I would fain have such a thing, and then I could be content; but if I had
it then it were but the creature that did help to my Contentment; but now it is
the Grace of God in my soul that makes me content: and surely it is better to
be Content with the Grace of God in my soul, than with the enjoying of an
outward comfort.

2. If I had such a thing, indeed my estate might be better, but my soul would
not be better, but by Contentment my soul is better, that would not be bettered
by an estate, or lands, or friends; but Contentment makes my self to be better:
and therefore Contentment is a better portion than the thing is that I would
fain have to be my portion.

3. If I get Content by having my desire satisfied, that is but self-love; but
when I am Contented with the hand of God, and am willing to be at his dispose,
that comes from my love to God in having my desire satisfied, there I am
contented through self-love, but through the Grace of Contentment I come to be
contented out of love to God; and is it not beteer to be contented from a
principle of love to God, than from a principle of self-love.

4. If I am contented because I have that that I have a desire to, perhaps I am
contented in that one particular, but that one particular does not furnish me
with Contentment in another thing; perhaps I may grow more dainty and nice, and
froward in other things: if you give children what they would have in some
things, they grow so much the more coy and dainty, and discontented if they
have not other things that they would have; but if I have once overcome my
heart, and am contented through the grace of God in my heart, then this does
not content me only in a particular, but in general, whatsoever befalls me. I am
discontented, and would fain have such a thing, and afterward I have it: now
does this prepare me to be contented in other things? no, but when I have
gotten this Grace of Contentment, I am prepared to be contented in all
conditions: and thus you see that Contentment does bring comfort to a man's
life, fills a man's life full of comfort in this world: yea, the truth is, it is
even a Heaven upon Earth, why? what is Heaven, but the rest and quiet of a man's
spirit; what is the special thing that is in Heaven, but rest, and joy, that
makes the life of Heaven, there is rest and joy, and satisfaction in God: so
it is here in a contented spirit, there is rest, and joy, and satisfaction in
God: In Heaven, there is singing praises to God; a contented heart is always
praising and blessing God; thou have Heaven while thou art upon earth when thou
have a contented spirit, yea, in some regards it is better than Heaven. How is
that you will say? there is some kind of honor that God has in it, and some
excellency that he has not in Heaven, and that is this,

In Heaven there is no overcoming of temptations, they are not put to any
trials by afflictions: there in Heaven they have exercise of grace, but they
have nothing but encouragement to it, and indeed those that are there their
grace is perfect, and in that they do excel us; but there is nothing to cross
their grace, they have no trials at all to tempt them to do contrary; but now
for a man or woman to be in the midst of afflictions, temptations and troubles,
and yet to have grace exercised, and yet to be satisfied in God and Christ, and
in the Word and Promises in the midst of all they suffer, this may seem to be
an honor that God has from us, that he has not from the Angels and Saints in
Heaven. Is it so much for one that is in Heaven that has nothing else but good
from God, has nothing to try them, no temptations, is that so much for them to
be praising and blessing God, as for the poor soul that is in the midst of
trials and temptations, and afflictions, and troubles? for this soul to go on
praising and blessing, and serving God; I (say) it is an excellency that thou
shall not have in Heaven, and God shall not have this kind of glory from thee in
Heaven, and therefore be contented, and prize this Contentment, and be willing
to live in this world as long as God shall please, and do not think, Oh that I
were delivered from all these afflictions and troubles herein this world! if
thou were, then thou should have more ease to thy self: but here is a way of
honoring God, and manifesting the excellency of Grace here when thou art in
this Conflict of temptation that God shall not have from thee in Heaven, and
therefore be satisfied and quiet, be contented with thy Contentment: I want
such and such things that others have, but blessed be God I have a contented
heart that others have not, then I say be content with thy Contenement, for
that is a rich portion that the Lord has granted unto them, if the Lord should
give unto thee thousands here in this world, it would not be such a rich
portion as this, that he has given thee a contented spirit: Oh go away and
praise the Name of God, and say, Lord, it is true these and these comforts that
others have I should be glad if I had them, but thou have cut me short, but
though I want these, yet thou have given me that that is as good and better,
thou have given me a quiet contented heart, to be willing to be at thy dispose.

SERMON VII.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


WE proceed now. There are some two or three things more of the excellency of
Contentment and then we are to proceed to Applycation of the point.

The Eight excellency is, Contentment is a great blessing of God upon the Soul.
There is Gods blessing upon those that are content, the blessing of God is upon
them, and their estates, and upon all that they have. We read in Deuteronomy. of the
blessing of Judah the principal Tribe; this is the blessing of Judah, And he
said hear Lord the voice of Judah and bring him unto his people, let his hands
be sufficient for him, and be thou an help to him from his enemies. Let his
hand be sufficient for him, that is, bring in a sufficiency of all good unto
him that he may have of his own, that is the blessing of Judah. So when God
gives thee a sufficiency of thine own, (as every contented man has) there is
the blessing of God upon thee, the blessing of the principle Tribe of Judah is
upon thee. It is the Lord that gives us all things to enjoy, we may have the
thing and yet not enjoy it except God comes in with his blessing now whatsoever
thou have thou do enjoy it: Many men have estates and do not enjoy them,
it is the blessing of God that gives us all things to enjoy, it is God that
through his blessing, has fashioned thy heart and made it suitable to thy
condition.

The Ninth excellency, Those that are content they may expect reward from God,
that God shall give unto them the good of all those things that they are
contented to be without, and this brings in abundance of good to a contented
spirit: There is such and such a mercy that thou think would be very
comfortable unto thee if thou had it, but can thou bring thy heart to
submit to God in it? thou shall have the blessing of the mercy one way or
other; if thou have not the thing it self in re; thou shall have it made up one
way or other, thou shall have a bill of exchange to receive somewhat in lieu of
it, there is no comfort that any soul is content to be without, but the Lord
will give either the comfort or somewhat in stead of it: Thou shall have a
reward to thy soul for what ever good thing thou art content to be without. You
know what the Scripture says of active obedience, and the Lord does accept (of
his servants) their will for the deed, though we do not do a good thing, yet if
our hearts be upright, to will to do it, we shall have the blessing though we
do not do the thing: You that complain of weakness, you cannot do as others
do, you cannot do as much service as others do, if your hearts be as upright
with God, and would fain do the same service that you see others do, you would
account it a great blessing of God upon you, the greatest blessing in the world
if you were able to do as others do; now you may comfort your selves with this,
having to deal with God in the way of the Covenant of Grace you shall have from
God the reward of all you will do, as a wicked man shall have punishment for
all the sin he would commit, so thou shall have the reward for all the good
thou would do. Now may not we draw an argument from active obedience to
passive; there is as good reason why thou should expect that God will reward
thee for all that thou art willing to suffer, as well as for all that thou art
willing to do, now if thou be willing to be without such a comfort and mercy
when God sees it fit, thou shall be no looser, certainly God will reward thee
either with the comfort or with that that shall be as good to thee as the
comfort, therefore consider how many things have I that others want, and can I
bring my heart into a quiet contented frame to want what others have? I have
the blessing of all that they have, and I shall either possess such things as
others have, or else God will make it up one way or other, either here, or
hereafter in eternity to me; Oh what riches are here! with Contentment thou
have all kind of riches.

Tenthly and lastly, By contentation the soul comes to an excellency near to
God himself, yea the nearest that may be, for this word that is translated
Content, it is a word that signifies a Self-sufficiencie, as I told you in the
opening of the words. A contented man is a self-sufficient man, what is the
great glory of God but to be happy and self-sufficient in himself? Indeed he is
said to be All-sufficient, but that is but a further addition of the word All,
rather than of any matter, for to be sufficient, is All-sufficient, now is this
the glory of God to be Sufficient, to have sufficiency in himself,
El-shaddai, to be God having sufficiency in himself? now thou come near to
this, thou partakest of the Divine Nature, as by grace in general, so in a
more peculiar manner by this grace of Christian Contentment, what is the
excellency and glory of God but this? Suppose there were no creatures in the
world, and that all the creatures in the world were anihilated, God would
remain the same blessed God that he is now, he would not be in a worse
condition if all creatures were gone, neither would a contented heart if God
should take away all creatures from him, a contented heart has enough in the
want of al creatures and would not be more miserable than now he is. Suppose
that God should continue thee here, and all creatures that are here in this
world were taken away, yet thou still (having God to be thy portion) would
be as happy as now thou art, and therefore contentation has a great deal of
excellency in it.

Thus we have showed in many particulars the excellency of this grace,
laboring to present the beauty of it before your souls that you may be in love
with it.

Now my brethren what remains but the practice of this, for this Art of
Contentment it is not a Speculative thing, only for contemplation, but it is an
art of Divinity, and therefore practical, ye are now to labor to work upon
your hearts, that there may be this grace in you, that you may honor God and
honor your profession with this grace of Contentment, for there is none does
more honor God, and honor their profession than those that have this grace of
Contentment. Now that we may fall upon the practice there, is required,

First, That we should he humbled in our hearts for the want of this, that we
have had so little of this grace in us. For there is no way to set upon any
duty with profit, till the heart be humbled for the want of the performance of
the duty before; many men when they hear of a duty that they should perform,
they will labor to perform it, but first thou must be humbled for the want of
it, therefore that is the thing that I shall endeavor in the Application, to
get your hearts to be humbled for the want of this grace; Oh had I had this
grace of Contentment, what a happy life I might have lived? what abundance of
honor I might have brought to the Name of God? and how might I have honored
my profession? and what a deal of comfort might I have enjoyed? but the Lord
knows it has been far otherwise, Oh how far have I been from this grace of
Contentment that has been opened to me? I have had a murmuring, a vexing and a
fretting heart within me, every little cross has put me out of temper and out
of frame, Oh the boisterousnesse of my spirit, what a deal of evil does God see
in my heart, in the vexing and fretting of my heart, and murmuring and repining
of my spirit? Oh that God would make you to see it: Now to the end that you
might be humbled for the want of this, I shall endeavor in these particulars
to speak unto it.

First, I shall set before you, The evil of a murmuring spirit, there is more
evil than you are aware of.

In the Second place, I will show you some agravations of this evil, It Is evil
in all, but in some more than in others.

Thirdly, I shall labor to take away the pleas that any murmuring discontented
heart has for this distemper of his.

There Is these Three things in this use of humiliation of the Soul for the want
of this grace of Contentment.

For the first, now at this time. The great evil that there is in a murmuring
discontented heart.

In the first place, This thy murmuring and discontentedness it argues much
corruption that is in the Soul, as Contentment argues much grace, and strong
grace, and beautiful grace; so this argues much corruption, and strong
corruption, and very vile corruptions in thy heart. As it is in a man's body, if
a man's body be of that temper that every scratch of a pin makes his flesh to
ranckle and to be a sore, you will say, surely this man's body is very corrupt,
his blood and his flesh is corrupt, that every scratch of a pin shall make it
ranckle, so it is in thy spirit; if every little trouble and affliction shall
make thee discontented, and make thee murmur, and even cause thy spirit within
thee to ranckle, or as it is in a wound in a man's body, the evil of a wound, it
is not so much in the largeness of the wound, and the abundance of blood that
comes out of the wound, but in the inflammation that there is in it, or in a
fretting and corroding humor that is in the wound; an unskilful man when he
comes and sees a large wound in the flesh, looks upon it as a dangerous wound,
and when he sees a great deal of blood gush out, he thinks these are the evils
of it, but when a Surgeon comes and sees a great gash, says he, this will
be healed within a few days, but there is a less wound and there is an
inflammation or a fretting humor that is in it, and this will cost time (says
he) to cure, so that he does not lay balsome and healing salves upon it, but
his great care is to get out the fretting humor, or inflammation, so that the
thing that must heal this wound it is some drink to purge; But (says the
patient) what good will this do to my wound? You give me somewhat to drink, and
my wound is in my arm, or in my leg, what good will this do that I put in my
stomach? Yes it purges out the fretting humor, or takes away the inflammation,
and till that be taken away the salves can do no good. So it is just for all
the world in the souls of men, it may be there is some affliction upon them
that I compare to the wound; now they think that the greatness of the
affliction is that that makes their condition most miserable: Oh no, there is a
fretting humor, an inflammation in the heart, a murmuring spirit that is within
thee and that is the misery of thy condition, and that must be purged out of
thee before thou can be healed, and let God do with thee what he will, till
he purges out that fretting humor thy wound will not be healed; a murmuring
heart is a very sinful heart, so that when thou art troubled for such an
affliction, thou had need turn thy thoughts, rather to be troubled for the
murmuring of thy heart, for that is the greatest trouble, there is an affliction
upon thee and that is grievous, but there is a murmuring heart within and
that is more grievous. Oh that we could but convince men and women that a
murmuring spirit is a greater evil than any affliction, let the affliction be
what it will be. We shall show more afterward that a murmuring spirit is the
evil of the evil, and the misery of the misery.

Secondly, The evil of murmuring is such, that God when he would speak of
wicked men, and describe them, and slew the brand of a wicked and ungodly man
or woman, he instances in this sin in a more special manner: I might name many
Scriptures, but that Scripture in Jude is a most remarkable one, in the 14.
verse, and so forward, there it is said, That the Lord comes with ten thousands
of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken
against him* Mark here in this 15. verse, there is four times mentioned ungodly
ones; All that are ungodly among them, all their ungodly deeds which they have
ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches, which ungodly sinners have
spoken against him: This is in the general. But now he comes in the particular
to show who these are, these are (says he) Murmurers: that is the very first.
Would you know who are ungodly men, that God when he comes with ten thousand of
Angels shall come to punish for all their ungodly deeds that they do, and those
that speak ungodly things against them; These ungodly ones are murmurers,
murmurers in the Scripture are put in the fore front of ungodly one, it is a
most dreadful Scripture, that the Lord when he speaks of ungodly ones puts
murmurers in the very forefront of all, you had need look to your spirits, you
may see that this murmuring, which is the vice contrary to this Contentment is
not so small a matter as you think, you think you are not so ungodly as others,
because you do not swear and drink as others do, but you may be ungodly in
murmuring, it is true there is no sin but some seeds and remainers of it are in
those that are godly, but when they are under the power of this sin of
murmuring, it does convince them to be ungodly, as well as if they were under
the power of drunkenness, or whordom, or any other sin, God will look upon you
as ungodly for this sin as well as for any sin whatsoever. This one Scripture
should make the heart shake at the thought of the sin of murmuring.

Thirdly, As it is made a brand of ungodly men, so you shall find in Scripture
that God accounts it rebellion, that is contrary to the worship that there was
in contentedness: that is worshipping of God, crouching to God and falling down
before him, even as a dog that would crouch when you hold a staff over him,
but a murmuring heart it is a rebellious heart, and that you shall find if you
compare two Scriptures together, they are both in the book of Numb. 16.41. But
on the morrow (says the text) all the congregation of the Children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of
the Lord. They all murmured, now compare this with the Chap. 17. and verse. 10.
And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aarons rod again, before the testimony to
be kept for a token against the Rebels. In the 16. Chap. they murmured against
Moses and Aaron, and in the 17. Chap. bring the rod of Aaron again, before the
testimony, for a token against the Rebels. So that to be a murmurer, and to be
a Rebel you see in Scripture phrase is all one, It is a rebellion against God:
as it is the beginning of rebellion and sedition in a kingdom when the people
are discontent, and when coffeehouse comes it grows to murmuring, and you
can go into no house almost but there is murmuring when men are discontent, so
that within a little while it breaks forth into sedition or rebellion.
Murmuring it is but as the smoke of the fire, there is first a smoke and smother
before the flame breaks forth, and so before open rebellion in a kingdom there
is first a smoke of murmuring, and then it breaks forth into open rebellion;
but because it has rebellion in the seeds of it therefore it is accounted
before the Lord to be rebellion. Will thou be a Rebel against God? When thou
feel thy heart discontented and murmuring against the dispensations of God
toward thee, thou should check thy heart thus, Oh thou wretched heart, what
will thou be a Rebel against God? will thou rise in a way of Rebellion against
the infinite God? yet thus thou have done, charge thy heart with this sin of
rebellion, you that are guilty of this sin of murmuring you are this day by the
Lord charged as being guilty of Rebellion against him, and God expects that
when you go home you should humble your souls before him for this sin, that you
should charge your souls for being guilty of rebellion against God, many of you
may say, I never thought that I had been a Rebel against God before, I thought
that I had many infirmities, but now I see the Scripture speaks of sin in
another manner than men do, the Scripture makes men (though but murmurers) to
be Rebels against God, Oh this rebellious heart that I have against the Lord
that has manifested it is self in this way of murmuring against the Lord?
That Is a Third particular in the evil of coffeehouse.

A Fourth particular in the evil of Coffeehouse, it is a wickedness that is
exeeeding contrary to Grace, and especially contrary to the work of God, in
bringing of the soul home to himself; I know no distemper more opposite and
contrary to the work of God in conversion of a sinner, than this is.

Quest. What Is the work of God when he brings a sinner home to himself?

Answ. The usual way is for God to make the soul to see and be sensible of the
dreadful evil that there is in sin, and the great breach that sin has made
between God and it, for certainly Jesus Christ can never be known in his beauty
and excellency till the soul know that. I do not speak what secret work of the
Holy Ghost there may be in the soul, but before the soul can actually apply
Jesus Christ to its self, it is impossible but it must come to know the evil of
sin, and the excellency of Jesus Christ: there may be a seed of faith put into
the soul, but the soul must first know Christ, and know sin, and be made
sensible of it. Now how contrary is this sin of murmuring to any such work of
God; has God made me see the dreadful evil of sin, and made my soul to be
sensible of the evil of sin as the greatest burden? how can I then be so much
troubled for every little affliction? certainly if I saw what the evil of sin
were, that sight would swallow up all other evils, and if I were burdened with
the evil of sin, it would swallow up all other burdens; what am I now murmuring
against Gods hand (says such a soul) when as a while ago the Lord made me see
my self to be a damned wretch, and apprehend it as a wonder that I am not in
Hell?

2. Yea, it is mighty contrary to the sight of the infinite excellency and glory
of Jesus Christ, and of the things of the Gospel. What am I that soul that the
Lord has discovered such infinite excellency of Jesus Christ to? and yet shall
I think such a little affliction to be so grievous to me, when I have had the
sight of such glory in Christ that is more worth than ten thousand worlds? (for
so will a true convert say) Oh! the Lord at such a time has given me that
fight of Christ that I would not be without for ten thousand thousand worlds;
but has God given thee that, and will thou be discontent for a trifle in
comparison to that?

3. A Third work when God brings the soul home to himself it is, By taking the
heart off from the Creature, the disingaging the heart from all
Creature Comforts: that is the Third work ordinarily that the soul may perceive
of its self. It Is true, Gods work may be altogether in the seeds in him, but
in the several actings of the soul in turning to God it may perceive these
things in it; the disingagement of the heart from the Creature, that is the
calling off the soul from the world, Whom the Lord has called he has
justified: what is the calling of the soul but this, the soul that was before
seeking for Contentment in the world, and cleaving to the Creature, now the
Lord calls the soul out of the world, and says, Oh soul, thy happiness is not
here, thy rest is not here, thy happiness is elsewhere, and thy heart must be
loosned from all these things that are here below in the world; and this is the
work of God in the soul to disingage the heart from the Creature, and how
contrary is a murmuring heart to such a thing; a thing that is glued to another
you cannot take off, but you must rend it, so it is a sign thy heart is glued to
the world, that when God would take thee off, thy heart rends, if God by an
affliction should come to take any thing in the world from thee, if thou can
part from it with ease without rending, it is a sign then that thy heart is not
glued to the world.

4. A Fourth work of God in the converting of a sinner, is this, The casting of
the soul upon Jesus Christ for all its good: I see Jesus Christ in the Gospel
the Fountain of all good, and God out of free Grace tendering him to me for
life, and for salvation, and now my soul casts its self, rouls it self upon the
infinite Grace of God in Christ for all good; now have thou done so? has God
converted thee, and drawn thee to his Son to cast thy soul upon him for all thy
good, and yet thou discontented for the want of some little matter in a
creature-comfort? art thou he that has cast thy soul upon Jesus Christ for all
good? as he says in another case, Is this thy faith?

5. The Soul is subdued to God; and then it comes to receive Jesus Christ as a
King, to rule, to order and dispose of him how he pleases, and so the heart is
subdued unto God. Now how opposite is a murmuring discontented heart to a heart
subdued to Jesus Christ as a King, and receiving him as a Lord to rule and
dispose of him as he pleases.

6. There is in the work of thy turning to God the giving up of thy self to God
in an everlasting Covenant? as thou take Christ the Head of the Covenant to
be thine, so thou give up thy self to Christ; In the work of Conversion there
is the resignation of the Soul wholly to God in an everlasting Covenant to be
his; have thou ever surrendered up thy self to God in an everlasting Covenant?
then certainly this thy fretting, murmuring heart is mighty opposite to it,
certainly thou forgettest this Covenant of thine, and the Resignation of thy
self up to God, it would be of mavelous help to you to humble your Souls when
you are in a murmuring condition; if you could but obtain so much liberty of
your own spirits as to look back to see what the work of God was in converting
you, there is nothing would prevail more than to think of that. I am now in a
murmuring discontented way, but how did I feel my soul working when God did
turn my Soul to himself? Oh how opposite is this to that work, and how
unseeming? Oh what shame and confusion would come upon the spirits of men and
women, if they could but compare the work of corruption in their murmuring and
discontent, with the work of God that was upon their Souls in conversion, now
we should labor to keep the work of God upon our Souls that was at our
Conversion; for Conversion must not be only at one instant at first: men are
deceived in this, if they think their Conversion is finished merely at first,
thou must be in a way of conversion to God all the days of thy life, and
therefore Christ says to his Disciples, except ye be converted and become as
little children: Ye be Converted, why, were they not converted before? Yes they
were converted, but they were still to continue the work of Conversion all the
days of their lives, and what work of God there is at the first Conversion it
is to abide afterward. As thus, always there must abide some sight and sense
of sin, it may be not in the way which you had, which was rather a preparation
than any thing else, but the sight and sense of sin it is to continue still,
that is, you are still to be sensible of the burden of sin as it is against the
Holiness, and Goodness, and Mercy of God unto thee, and the sight of the
excellency of Jesus Christ is to continue, and thy calling out of the Creature:
and thy casting of thy Soul upon Christ, and thy receiving Christ as a King,
still receive him day by day, and the subduing of thy heart, and the
surrendering of thy self up to God in a way of Covenant; now if this were but
daily continued there would be no space nor time for murmuring to work upon thy
heart: that is the Fourth Particular.

The Fifth thing in the evil of coffeehouse, Murmuring and coffeehouse is
exceedingly below a Christian; Oh! it is too mean and base a distemper for a
Christian to give place to it. Now it is below a Christian in many respects.

1 How below the relation of a Christian? The relation in which thou stand.
With what relation (you will say?)

First, The relation thou stand in to God: Do not thou call God thy
father? and do not thou stand in relation to him as a child? what? thou
murmer? In 2 Samuel 13.4. it is a speech of Jonadab to Amnon, Why art thou, being
the Kings Son, lean from day to day, will thou not tell me? and so he told him;
(but that was for a wicked cause) he perceived that his spirit was troubled,
for otherwise he was of a fat and plump temper of body, but because of trouble
of spirit he was even pined away why? what is the matter? thou that stand in
this relation to the King and yet any thing should trouble thy heart, (that is
his meaning) is there any thing that should disquiet thy heart, and yet
stand in such a relation to the King, the King's Son? So I may say to a
Christian, Art thou the King's Son, the Son, the Daughter of the King of
Heaven, and yet so disquieted and troubled, and vexed at every little thing that
falls out? as if a King's Son should cry out, he is undone for losing a babble,
what an unworthy thing were this: So do thou, thou criest out as if thou
were undon, and yet a Kings Son, thou that stand in such relation to God, as
unto a father, thou do dishonor thy father in this; as if so be either he
had not wisdom, or not power, or not mercy enough to provide for thee.

2. The relation that thou stand in to Jesus Christ, thou art the spouse of
Christ: what! one married to Jesus Christ and yet troubled and discontented?
have thou not enough in him; does not Christ say to his spouse, as Elkanah said
to Hannah, (1 Samuel 1.8.) Am not I better to thee than ten sons? So does not
Christ thy husband say to thee, Am not I better to thee than thousands of
riches and comforts? such comforts as thou murmurest for want of; has not God
given thee his Son? and will he not with him give thee all things? has the
love of God bin to thee to give thee his Son in way of marriage? why art thou
discontented and murmuring? consider thy relation to Jesus Christ, as thou art
a spouse and married to him, his person is thine, and so all the riches of
Jesus Christ is thine, as the riches of a husband are the wives, and though
there are some husbands so vile as the wives may be forced to sue for
maintenance; certainly Jesus Christ will never deny maintenance to his
spouse, it is a dishonor for a husband to have the wife go whining up-and down;
what, thou art macht with Christ and art his spouse, and will thou murmur now
and be discontented in thy spirit? You shall observe among those that are newly
matched, when there is discontent between the wife and the husband, their
friends will shake their heads and say, they do not meet with that that they
did expect, ye see ever since they were married together how the man looks, and
the woman looks, they are not so chearly as they were wont to be, surely (say
they) it is like to prove an ill match. But it is not so here, it shall not be
so between thee and Christ: Oh Jesus Christ does not love to see his spouse to
have a lowering countenance: no man loves to see coffeehouse in the face of
his wife, surely Christ does not love to see coffeehouse in the face of his
spouse.

3 Thou stand in relation to Christ not only as a spouse, but as a member,
Thou art bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh; and to have a member of
Jesus Christ to be in such a condition, it is exceeding unworthy.

4. He is thy Elder brother likewise, and so thou art a Co heir with him.

5 The relation that thou stand in to the Spirit of God, thou art the Temple
of the holy Ghost, the holy Ghost is thy Comforter, it is he that is appointed
to convey all comfort from the Father and the Son, to the Souls of his people.
And art thou the Temple of the holy Ghost, and does he dwell in thee, and yet
for all that thou murmur for every little matter.

6 The relation that thou stand in to the Angels, thou art made one body
with them: for so Christ has joined principalities and powers with his Church,
they are Ministering Spirits for good to his people, to supply what they need,
and thou, and they are joined together, and Christ is the head of you and
Angels.

7 The relation that you stand in to the Saints, you are of the same body with
them, they and you make up but one mystical body with Jesus Christ, and if they
be happy you must needs be happy; Oh how beneath a Christian is a murmuring
Spirit if he considers his relations in which he stands.

Secondly, A Christian should consider, That murmuring and discontentednesse is
below the high dignities that God has put upon him: Do but consider the high
dignity that God has put upon thee; the meanest Christian in the world is a
lord of heaven and earth; he has made us Kings unto himself, Kings unto God,
not Kings unto men to rule over them, and yet I say every Christian is lord of
heaven and earth, yea of life and death. That is, as Christ he is Lord of all,
so he has made those that are his members to be lords of all, all are yours
says the Apostle, even life and death, every thing is yours. It Is a very
strange expression that death should be theirs, death is yours, that is, you
are as it were lords over it, you have that that shall make death to be your
servant, your slave, even death it is self, your greatest enemies are turned to
be your slaves; faith makes a Christian to be as lord over all, to be lifted up
in excellency above all creatures that ever God made except the Angels, yea and
in some respect above them, I say the poorest Christian that lives is raised to
an estate above all the creatures in the world except Angels, yea and above
them in diverse respects too, and yet discontented, that thou who were as a
firebrand of hell, and might have been scorching and yelling and roaring there
to all eternity, yet that God should raise thee to have a higher excellency in
thee than there is in all the works of creation that ever he made except
Angels, and other Christians that are in thy condition, yea and thou art nearer
the Divine Nature than the Angels, because thy nature is joined in an
hypostatical union to the Divine Nature, and in that respect thy nature is more
honored than the nature of the Angels. And the death of Christ is thine, he
died for thee and not for the Angels, and therefore thou art like to be raised
above the Angels in diverse respects: yea thou that art in such an estate as
this is, thou that art set apart to the end that God might manifest to all
eternity what the infinite power of a Deity is able to raise a creature too;
for that is the condition of a Saint, a Believer, his condition is such as he is
set apart to the end that God might manifest to all eternity what his infinite
power is able to do to make the creature happy; art thou in such a condition?
Oh! how low and beneath this condition is a murmuring and discontented heart
for want of some outward comforts here in this world: How unseemly is it that
thou should be a slave to every cross, that every affliction shall be able
to say to thy soul, bow down to us: We accounted that a great slavery, when men
would say to our souls, bow down: As the cruel Prelates were wont to do in
imposing things upon men's consciences, they did in effect say, let your
consciences, your souls bow down to us, that we may tread upon them; that is
the greatest slavery in the world, that one man should say to another, let your
consciences, your souls bow down that we may tread upon them; but will thou
suffer every affliction to say, bow down that we may tread upon thee? truly
it is so, when thy heart is overcome with murmuring and discontent: Know that
those afflictions which have caused thee to murmur, have said to thee, bow down
that we may tread upon thee; nay, not afflictions, but the very Devil does
prevail against you in this: Oh! how beneath is this to the happy estate that
God has raised a Christian unto! What! the son of a King, shall he have every
base fellow to come and bid him bow down that he may tread upon his neck? thus
do thou in every affliction: the affliction, the cross, and trouble that
does befall thee, says bow down that we come and tread upon thee.

Thirdly, Murmuring it is below the Spirit of a Christian. Below his Spirit, the
Spirit of every Christian should be like the Spirit of his Father; every father
loves to see his spirit in his child, loves to see his image, not the image of
his body only, to say, here is a child for all the world like the father, but he
has the spirit of his father too: a father that is a man of spirit, loves to
see his spirit in his child, rather than the feature of his body; Oh the Lord
that is our Father, loves to see his Spirit in us: Great men love to see great
spirits in their Children, and the great God loves to see a great Spirit in his
Children; we are one Spirit with God, and with Christ, and one Spirit with the
Holy Ghost, therefore we should have a Spirit that might manifest the glory of
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost in our Spirits; that is the spirit of a
Christian indeed. The spirit of a Christian should be a lyon-like Spirit, as
Jesus Christ is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, (so he is called) so we should
manifest somewhat of the Lyon-like Spirit of Jesus Christ; he manifested his
Lyon-like Spirit in passing through all afflictions and troubles whatsoever
without any murmuring against God: When he came to drink that bitter cup, and
even the dregs of it, he prayed to God (indeed) that if it were possible it
might pass from him, but presently, not my will, but thy will be done: As soon
as ever he did mention the passing of the cup from him, (though it were the
most dreadful cup that ever was drunk since the world began, yet at the
mentioning of it) not my will, but thy will be done; here Christ showed a
Lyon-like Spirit in going through all kind of afflictions whatsoever with out
any murmuring against God in them: now a murmuring spirit is a base dejected
spirit, cross and contrary to the Spirit of a Christian, and it is very base. I
remember that the Heathens accounted it very base, Plutarch does report of a
certain people that did use to manifest their disdain to men that were overmuch
dejected by any affliction, they did condemn them to this punishment, to wear
women's clothes all their days, or such a space of time at least they should go
in woman's clothes in token of shame and disgrace to them because they had such
effeminate spirits, they thought it against a manlike spirit, and therefore
seeing they did un-man themselves they should go as women, now shall they
account it an unmanlike spirit, to be overmuch dejected in afflictions; and
shall not a Christian account it an unchristian-like spirit to be overmuch
dejected by any affliction whatsoever? I remember another compares murmuring
spirits, to children when they are weaning, what a deal of stir have you with
your children when you wean them, how froward and vexing are they? So when God
would wean thee from some outward comforts in this world, Oh how fretting and
discontented art thou! Children will not sleep themselves, nor let their
mothers sleep when they are weaning; and so when God would wean us from the
world, and we fret, vex, and murmur, this is a childish spirit.

Fourthly, It Is below the profession of a Christian. The profession of a
Christian, what is that? A Christians profession is to be dead to the world, and
to be alive to God, that is his profession, to have his life to be hid with
Christ in God, to satisfy himself in God; what is this thy profession? and yet
if thou have not every thing that thou would have to murmur and be
discontent, thou do in that even deny thy profession.

Fifthly, It is below that special Grace of faith. Faith is that that does
overcome the world, it is that that makes all the promises of God to be ours:
Now when thou tookest upon thee the profession of Religion, did God ever
promise thee that thou should live at ease, and quiet, and have no trouble?
I remember Austin has such an expression, What is this thy faith? what did I
ever promise thee, (says he) that thou should ever flourish in the world?
art thou a Christian to that end? and is this thy faith? I never made any such
promise to thee when thou tookest upon thee to be a Christian: Oh it is mighty
contrary to thy profession, thou have never a promise for this, that thou
should not have such an affliction upon thee: And a Christian should live by
his faith; it is said, that the just do live by faith; now thou should not
look after any other life but the life that thou have by faith; now thou have
no ground for thy faith, to believe that thou should be delivered out of
such an affliction; and then, why should thou account it such a great evil
to be under such an affliction? Certainly that good that we have in the ground
for our faith, it is enough to content our hearts here, and to all eternity: A
Christian should be satisfied with that that God has made to be the object of
his faith, the object of his faith is high enough to satisfy his soul, were it
capable of a thousand times more than it is: Now if thou may have the object
of thy faith full, thou have enough to content thy soul: And know that when
thou art discontented for want of such and such comforts, if thou would but
think thus, God did never promise me that I should have these Comforts, and at
this time, and in such a way as I would have, but I am discontented because I
have not these which God did never yet promise me, and therefore I sin much
against the Gospel, and against the grace of faith.

There is yet another thing, It Is below the hopes of Christians: Oh! the most
glorious things that the Saints hope for.

And against the helps that Christians have, Christians have great helps that
may help them against murmuring.

And it is against that which God expects from Christians. God he expects other
manner of things from them than this.

Yea, and it is below that that God has from other Christians. These things I
shall open at another time.

SERMON VIII.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.1. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
content.


Sept. 21. 1645.
I Mentioned diverse things the last day to set out the evil of discontent; I
shall name Two or Three more.

Sixthly, It is below a Christian in this, Because it is below those helps that
a Christian has more than others have; they have the promises to help them
that others have not; it is not so much to have a Nabal have his heart sink,
because he has nothing but the creature to uphold him, but it is much for a
Christian that has promises and ordinances to uphold his spirit which others
have not.

Seventhly, It Is below the expectation that God has of Christians, for God
expects not only that they should be patient in afflictions, but that they
should rejoice and triumph in them: now Christians, when God expects this from
you, for you not so much as to have attained to contentedness under
afflictions, Oh this is beneath the expectation of God from you.

Eighthly, It is below that that God has had from other Christians. Others have
not only bin contented with little crosses, but they have Triumphed under great
afflictions, they have suffered the spoiling of their goods with joy, read but
the latter part of the 11. of the Hebrews, and you shall find what great things
God has had from his people, and therefore not to be content with smaler
crosses, this must needs be a great evil.

The Sixth evil that there is in a murmuring spirit, is this, By murmuring you
undo your prayers, for it is exceeding contrary to the prayers that you make
unto God: When you come to prayer to God, you acknowledge his Sovereignity over
you, you come there to profess your selves to be at Gods dispose, what do you
pray for except you acknowledge that you are at his dispose, except you will
stand (as it were) at his dispose never come to petition to him, if you will
come to petition him, and yet will be your own carver you go cross to your
prayers, to come as if you would beg your bread at your Fathers gates every
day, and yet you must do what you list, this is the undoing of the prayers of a
Christian. I remember I have read of Lattimer that speaking concerning Peter
that denied his master, (says he) Peter forgot his Paternoster, for that was,
hallowed be thy name, and thy kingdom come: So we may say, when you have
murmuring and discontented hearts you forget your prayers, you forget what you
have prayed for, for you must make the Lords-prayer to be as a pattern for your
prayers though you say not always the same words, what do you pray, but give
us this day our daily bread? for that is Christ's intention that we should have
that as a pattern, and is a directory (as it were) how to make our prayers, now
God does not teach any of you to pray, Lord give me so much a year, or let me
have such kind of cloth, and so many dishes at my table, Christ does not teach
you to pray so; but he teaches us to pray, Lord give us our bread, showing that
you should be content with a little, what have you not bread to eat? I hope
there is none of you here but have that.

Obj. But I do not know if I should die what should become of my children: Or
if I have bread now I know not where I shall have it the next week, or where I
shall have provision for the winter.

Answ. Where did Christ teach us to pray, Lord give us provision for so long a
time; no, but if we have bread for this day Christ would have us content:
Therefore when we murmur because we have not so much variety as others have, we
do (as it were) forget our Paternoster; It Is against our prayers, we do not in
our lives hold forth the acknowledgement of the Sovereignity of God over us as
we seem to acknowledge in our prayers; therefore when at any time you find your
hearts murmuring then do but reflect upon your selves and think thus, is this
according to my prayers, wherein I held forth the Sovereign Power and Authority
that God had over me?

The Seventh thing that I add for the evil of coffeehouse, is, The woeful
effects that comes to a discontented heart from murmuring, I Will name you five,
there are five evil effects that comes from a murmuring spirit.

1 By murmuring and discontent in your hearts, you come to loose a great deal
of time; how many times do men and women when they are discontented let their
thoughts run, and are musing and contriving through their present
discontentednesse; then let their discontented thoughts be working in them, for
some hours together, and they spend their time in vain. When you are alone you
should spend your time in holy meditation, but you are spending your time in
discontented thoughts; you who complain that you cannot meditate, you cannot
think on good things, but if you begin to think of them a little, presently
your thoughts are off from them, but if you be discontented with any thing,
then you can go alone, and muse, and roll things up and down in your thoughts
to feed a discontented humor: Oh labor to see this evil effect of murmuring,
the losing of your time.

2. It does unfit you for duty: A man or woman that is in a contented frame,
you may turn such a one to any thing at any time, he is fit for to go to God at
any time; but when one is in a discontented condition, then a man or woman is
exceeding unfit for the service of God. And it causes many distractions in
duty, it unfits for duty, and when you come to perform duties, Oh the
distractions that are in your duties, when your spirits are discontented; when
you hear of any ill news from Sea and cannot bear it, or of any ill from a
friend, or any loss or cross, Oh what distractions do they cause in the
performance of holy duties! When you should be in enjoying communion with God,
you are distracted in your thoughts about the cross that has befallen you,
whereas had you but a quiet spirit, though there should great crosses befall
you, yet they would never hinder you in the performance of any duty.

3 Consider what wicked risings of heart, and resolutions of spirit there are
many times in a discontented fit. In some discontented fits the heart rises
against God, and against others, and sometimes has even desperate resolutions
what to do to help themselves. If the Lord should have suffered you to have
done, (sometimes in a discontented fit) what you had thought to do, what
wonderful misery had you brought upon your selves! Oh it was a mercy of God
that did stop you, had not God stopped you, but let you go on when you thought to
help your selves this way and the other way, Oh it had been ill with you, do
you but remember those risings of heart and wicked resolutions that sometimes
you have had in a discontented mood, and learn to be humbled upon that.

4 Unthankfulness, that is an evil and a wicked effect that comes from
discontent. Unthankfulness the Scripture does rank among very great sins. For
men and women that are discontent though they enjoy many mercies from God, yet
they are thankful for none of them, for this is the vile nature of
coffeehouse, to lessen every mercy of God, to make those mercies they have
from God to be as nothing to them, because they have not what they would have.
Sometimes it is so even in spiritual things, if they have not all they would
have, the comforts that they would have, then what they have is nothing to
them, do you think that God will take this well? If you should give a friend, a
kinsman, a purse of money to go and trade withal, and he should come and say,
what do you give me? they are but a few counters, they will do me no good: you
cannot bear this at his hand if he should do so, because he has not as much
money as he would: So for you to be ready to say, All that God has given me is
nothing worth, will do me no good, they are but counters; though they are the
precious Graces of Gods Spirit that are more worth than thousands of worlds,
yet for you to say, they are nothing, they are but common gifts, and all is but
in hypocrisy, all counterfeit, Oh! what an unthankful thing is this! the
graces of Gods Spirit are nothing to a discontented heart that has not all
that it would have; and so for outward blessings, though God has given you
health of body, and strength, and has given you some competency for your
family, some way of livelihood, yet because you are disappointed in somewhat
that you would have therefore all is nothing unto you; Oh! what unthankfulness
is here? God expects that every day you should spend some time in blessing his
Name for what mercy he has granted unto you, there is not any one of you who
are in the lowest condition but you have abundance of mercies to bless God
for, but discontentednesse makes them nothing. It Is an excellent speech that I
remember Luther has, (says he) This is the Rhetoric of the Spirit of God,
(it is a very fine speech of his) to extenuate evil things, and to amplyfie good
things; if there falls out a cross, to make the cross to be but little, but if
there be a mercy to make the mercy to be great; as thus, If there be a cross,
if the Spirit of God prevails in the heart, such a man or woman will wonder
that it is no greater, and will bless God that though there be such a cross,
yet that it is no more; that is the work of the Spirit of God; and if there be a
mercy, wonders at Gods goodness that God granted so great a mercy: The Spirit
of God extenuates evils and crosses, and does magnify and amplify all
mercies, and makes all mercies seem to be great, and all afflictions seem to be
little. But (says he) the Devil goes quite contrary, the Rhetoric of the
Devil is quite otherwise, he does lessen Gods mercies, and amplify evil
things, as thus, A godly man wonders at his cross that it is no more, a wicked
man wonders his cross is so much, Oh (says he) none was ever so afflicted as
I am! If there be a cross, the Devil puts the soul upon musing on it, and
making it greater than it is, and so it brings discontent: And then on the
other side, if there be a mercy, then it is the Rhetoric of the Devil to lessen
the mercy, I indeed (says he) the thing is a good thing, but what is it, it is
no great matter, and for all this I may be miserable. Thus the Rhetoric of
Satan does lessen Gods mercies, and does increase afflictions: And for this
I Will give you a notable example that we have in Scripture, it is the example of
Korah, Dathan and Abiram, In Numb. 16.12, 13. And Moses sent to call Dathan,
and Abiram the sons of Eliab: which said, we will not come up: Is it a small
thing that thou have brought us up out of a Land that flows with milk and
honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thy self altogether a
Prince over us? Mark, they slighted the land that they were going unto, the
Land of Canaan, that was the Land that God promised them that should flow with
milk and honey: But mark here their discontentednesse, because they met with
some troubles in the wilderness, Oh it was to slay them, they made their
affliction in the wilderness to be greater than it was, Oh it was to kill them,
though it were indeed to carry them to the Land of Canaan. But now their
deliverance from Egypt though it was a great mercy, they made that mercy to be
nothing, for say they, you have brought us out of a land that flows with milk
and honey, what land was that? It was the Land of Egypt, the Land of their
bondage, but they call it a Land that flowed with milk and honey, though it
were the land of their most cruel and unsupportable bondage; whereas they
should have blessed God as long as they had lived for Gods delivering them out
of the land of Egypt, yet meeting with some cross they make their deliverance
from Egypt no mercy, no, it was rather a misery to them, Oh (say they) Egypt
was a land that flowed with milk and honey. Oh what baseness is there in a
discontented spirit! a discontented spirit out of envy to Gods grace will make
mercies that are great to be little, yea to be none at all. Would one ever have
thought that such a word should have come from the mouth of an Israelite that
had been under bondage and cried under it, and yet when they meet with a little
cross in their way to say, you have brought us out of the Land that flows
with milk and honey, to say they were better before than now, and yet before
they could not be contented neither; this is the usual unthankful expression of
a discontented heart: And it is so with us now when we meet with any cross in
our estates, any taxations and trouble, especially if any among you have been
where the enemy has prevailed, you are ready to say, we had plenty before and
we are now brought to a condition of hardship, we were better before when we
had the Prelates and others to domineer: and so we endanger our selves to be
brought into that bondage again; Oh let us take heed of this, of a discontented
heart, there is this woeful cursed fruit of discontent to make men and women
unthankful for all the mercies God has granted to them, and this is a sore and
grievous evil.

And lastly, There Is this evil effect in murmuring, It causes shifttings of
spirit: they that murmur and are discontent, are liable to temptations, to
shift for themselves in sinful and ungodly ways, discontent is the ground of
shifting courses and unlawful ways. How many of you may have your consciences
condemn you of this, that you in the time of your afflictions have fought to
shift for your selves by ways that have been sinful against God, and your
discontent was the bottom and ground of it? If you would avoid shiftings for
your selves by wicked ways, labor to mortify this sin of discontent, to
mortify it at the root.

The Eight evil that there is in murmuring and discontent is this, There is a
great deal of folly, extreme folly in a discontented heart, it is a foolish sin.
I shall open the folly of it in many particulars.

1 It takes away the present comfort of what you have, because you have not
somewhat that you would have. What a foolish thing is this, that because I have
not what I would have, I will not enjoy the comfort of what I have? Do not you
account this folly in your children, you give them some victuals and they are
not contented, perhaps (they say) it is not enough, they cry for more, and if
you do not presently give them more they will throw away that they have, and
though you account that folly in your children, yet you deal thus with God; God
gives you many mercies, but you see others have more mercies than you and
therefore you cry for more; I but God gives you not what you would have and
upon that you throw away what you have, is not this folly in your hearts? It
is unthankfulness.

2 There Is a great deal of folly in coffeehouse, for by all your discontent
you cannot help your selves, you cannot get any thing by it. Who can by taking
any carking care add one cubit to his stature, or make one hair that is white
to be black? You may vex and trouble your selves, but you can get nothing by
it. Do you think that the Lord will come in a way of mercy ever a whit the
sooner because of the murmuring of your spirits, Oh no, but mercy will be
rather deferred the longer for it, though the Lord were before in a way of
mercy, yet this distemper of your hearts were enough to put him out of his
course of mercy, and though he had thoughts that you should have the thing
before, yet now you shall not have it. If you had a mind to give such a thing
to your child, yet if you see him in a discontented fretting way you will not
give it him; and this is the very reason why there are so many mercies denied
to you, because of your coffeehouse, you are discontented for want of them,
and therefore you have them not, you do deprive your selves of the enjoyment of
your own desires because of the coffeehouse of your hearts, because you have
not your desires, and is not this a foolish thing?

3 There Is a great deal of folly in this, there are many foolish carriages
commonly that a discontented heart is guilty of: They carry themselves
foolishly toward God and toward men, there are such expressions, and such
kind of behavior comes from them, as makes their friends to be ashamed of them
many times, their carriages are so unseemlie, they are a shame to themselves
and their friends.

4 There is a great deal of folly in discontent and murmuring; for it does eat
out the good and sweetness of a mercy before it comes. If God should give a
mercy that we are discontented for the want of, yet the blessing of the mercy
is as it were eaten out before we come to have it. Discontent is like a worm
that eats the meat out of the nut, and then when the meat is eaten out of it,
then you shall have the shell. If a child should cry for a nut that has the
meat eaten out, or all worm-eaten, what good would the child have by having the
nut; so such an outward comfort you would fain have and you are troubled for
the want of it, but the very trouble of your spirits is the worm that eats out
the blessing of the mercy, and then perhaps God gives it you, but gives you it
with a curse mixed with it that you were better not have it than have it. That
man or woman that is discontented for want of some good thing, if God does give
that good thing to them before they be humbled for their discontent that did
proceed from them, such a man or woman can have no comfort of the mercy, but
it will be rather an evil than a good to them: And therefore for my part if I
should have a friend or brother or one that were as deer to me as my own soul,
that I should see discontented for the want of such a comfort, I should rather
pray, Lord keep this thing from them, til thou will be pleased to humble their
hearts for their discontent, let not them have the mercy til they come to be
humbled for their discontent for the want of it, for if they have it before
that time they will have it without any blessing: And therefore it should be
your care when you find your hearts discontented for want of any thing, to be
humbled for it, thinking thus with your selves, Lord if that that I do so
immoderatly desire should come to me before I be humbled for my discontent for
want of it, I am certain I can have no comfort of it, but I shall rather have
it as an affliction to me. Many things which you desire as your lives, and
think that you should be happy if you had them, yet when they do come you find
not such happiness in them, but they prove to be the greatest crosses and
afflictions to you that ever you had, and upon this ground, because your hearts
were immoderatly set upon them before you had them. As it was with Rachel, she
must have children or else she died, well says God seeing you must, you shall
have them, but though she had a child she died according to what she said, Give
me children or else I die. So in regard of any other outward comforts, people
may have the thing, but often times they have it so as it proves the heaviest
cross to them that ever they had in all their lives, such a child as you were
discontent for the want of it, it may be it was sick, and your hearts were out
of temper for fear that you should lose it, and God restores it, but he
restores it so as he makes it a cross to your heart all the days of your
lives. One observes concerning Manna, when the people were contented with their
allowance that God allowed them, then it was very good, but when they would
not be content with Gods allowance, but would gather more than God would have
them; then (says the text) there was worms in it: So when we are content with
our conditions, and that that God disposes of us to be in, there is a blessing
in it, then it is sweet to us, but if we must needs have more, and keep it
longer than God would have us to have it, then there will be worms in it and no
good at all.

5. There Is a great deal of folly in discontentedness, for it makes our
afflictions a great deal worse than otherwise it would be; it no way removes
our affliction, nay, while they do continue they are a great deal the worse and
heaviour, for a discontented heart is a proud heart, and a proud heart will not
pull down his sails when there comes a tempest and storm: If a Mariner when a
tempest and storm comes should be froward and would not pull down his sails,
but is discontented with the storm, is his condition the better because he is
discontented and will not pull down his sails? Will this help him? Just so is
it for all the world with a discontented heart, a discontented heart is a proud
heart, and he out of his pride is troubled with his affliction, and is not
contented with Gods dispose, and so he will not pull down his spirit at all,
and make it bow to God in this condition in which God has brought him; now is
his condition the better because he will not pull down his spirit? no certainly
abundantly worse, a thousand to one but the tempest and storm over-whelms his
soul. And thus you see what a great deal of folly there is in the sin of
coffeehouse.

The Ninth Evil of murmuring and coffeehouse is this, There is a mighty deal
of danger in the sin of coffeehouse, for it exceedingly provokes the wrath
of God; it is a sin that does much provoke God against his creature; we find
most sad expressions in Scripture (and examples too) how God has been provoked
against many for their discontent; in Numb. 14. you have a notable text, and
one would think that that were enough for ever to make you fear murmuring, in
the 26. verse, it is said, The Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,
what did he say? How long shall I bear with this evil Congregation which
murmur against me? How long shall I bear with them says God, This evil
congregation; Oh it is an evil congregation that murmur against me! And how long
shall I bear with them? they do murmur, and they have murmured: as those that
have murmuring spirits, and murmuring dispositions, they will murmur again, and
again, How long shall I hear with this evil congregation that murmur against
me? How justly may God speak this of many of you that are this morning before
the Lord, How long shall I bear with this wicked man or woman that does murmur
against me, and has usually in the course of their lives murmured against me
when any thing falls out otherwise than they would have it? And mark what
follows after, I have heard the murmurings of the Children of Israel: You
murmur, it may be others hear you not, nay it may be you speak not at all, or
but half-words, yet God hears the language of your murmuring hearts, and those
muttering speeches, and those half-words that comes from you. And observe
further in this verse, how the Lord repeats this sin of murmuring, How long
shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me? Secondly, I
have heard their murmuring, Thirdly, which they murmur against me: Murmur,
murmur, murmur, Three times in one verse he repeats it; and this is to show his
indignation against the thing: When you express indignation against a thing,
you will repeat it over again, and again: now the Lord because he would express
his indignation against this sin, he repeats it over again, and again, and it
follows in the 28. verse. Say unto them, as truly as I live says the Lord, as
ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you. Mark, God swears against a
murmurer; sometimes in your discontent you will be ready to swear (it may be,)
do you swear in your discontent? So does God swear against you for your
discontent. And what was it that God would do unto them? verse, 29, 30.
Doubtless your carkeises shall fall in the wilderness, and you shall not come
into the land concerning which I swear, to make you dwell therein: as if God
should say, if I have any life in me, your lives shall go for it, as I live it
shall cost you your lives. A discontented murmuring fit of yours may cost you
your lives. You see how it provokes God, there is more evil in it than you are
aware of, it may cost you your lives, and therefore look to your selves, and
learn to be humbled at the very beginnings of such distempers in the heart. So
in Psalm. 106.24, 25. Yea they despised the pleasant Land, they believed not his
word; But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the
Lord; therefore be lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the
wilderness. Here are diverse things observable in this Scripture.

First, That which we spoke to before, How a murmuring heart does slight Gods
mercies, so it is here, They despised the pleasant land: and that a murmuring
heart is contrary to faith, they believed not his word, but (says the text)
they murmured in their tents, and hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. Many
men and women will hearken to the voice of their own base murmuring hearts,
that will not hearken to the voice of the Lord; if you would hearken to the
voice of the Lord there would not be such murmuring as there is: But mark what
follows upon it, you may not think to please your selves in your murmuring
discontentednesse, and think that no evil shall come of it; Therefore he lifted
up his hand against them to overthrow them: you that are discontented, you lift
up your hearts against God, and you cause God to lift up his hand against you;
perhaps God lays his finger upon you softly in some afflictions that are upon
you, in your families or else where, and you cannot bear the hand of God that
lies upon you as tenderly as a tenderhearted nurse that lays her hand upon
the child, you cannot bear the tender hand of God that is upon you in a lesser
affliction; it were just with God to lift up his hand against you in another
manner of affliction; Oh a murmuring spirit provokes God exceedingly. There is
another place in 16. of Number. compare the 41. verse, and the 46. verse. together,
But on the morrow all the Congregation of the Children of Israel murmured
against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord:
and mark in the 46. verse, And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a Censer and put
fire therein, from off the Altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the
Congregation and make an atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out from
the Lord, the plague is begun; mark how Gods wrath is kindled; in the 41.
verse, the Congregation had murmured; and they murmured but against Moses and
Aaron, (perhaps you murmur more directly against God) and that was against God
in murmuring against Gods Ministers, it was against God but not so directly;
but it may be the murmuring of your hearts is more directly against Gods
dealings with you, if you murmur against those that God makes instruments,
(because you have not every thing that you would have) as against the
Parliament, or such and such that are public instruments, it is against God;
it was but against Moses and Aaron that the Israelites murmured, and they said
that Moses and Aaron had killed the people of the Lord, though it was the hand
of God that was upon them for their former wickedness, in murmuring. It is
usual for wicked vile hearts to deal thus with God, that when Gods hand is a
little upon them for to murmur again and again, and so to bring upon themselves
even infinite kind of evils; but now the anger of God was quickly kindled, Oh
says Moses, Go, take the Censer quickly for wrath is gone out from Jehovah,
the plague is begun: so while you are murmuring in your families, the wrath of
God may quickly go out against you, quickly, in a morning or evening, when you
are murmuring, the wrath of God may come quickly out upon your families or
persons, you are never so prepared for present wrath as when you are in a
murmuring discontented fit, those that stand by and see you in a murmuring
discontented fit, have cause to say, Oh let us go and take the censer, let us
go to prayer, for we are afraid that wrath is gone out against this family,
against this person: And it were a very good thing for thee that art a godly
wife when you see your husband come home and fall to murmuring because things
go not according to his desire, to go to prayer, and say, Lord perdon the sin
of my husband; and so for the husband to go to God in prayer falling down and
beseeching of him that wrath may not come out against his family for the
murmuring of his wife. And the truth is, at this day there has been (at least
lately) as much murmuring in England as ever was, and even in this very
particular the plague is begun, and this very judgment it does come many times
upon murmuring upon those that are so discontented in their families and are
always grumbling and murmuring at any thing that falls out amiss, (I say) this
text of Scripture in Numbers does clearly hold forth this, that the Lord brings
the plague upon men for this sin of murmuring, he does it in kingdoms and
families, and upon particular persons. Though we cannot always point out the
particular sin that God brings this for, yet this should be examined how far we
are guilty of the sin of murmuring; because the Scripture holds forth this so
clearly, that Moses when he did but hear that they murmured, Do they murmur?
(says he) Go forth quickly, and seek to passifie the anger of God, for wrath
is gone out, and the plague is begun. And in 1 Cor. 10.10. there you have an
notable example of Gods heavy displeasure against murmuring, Neither murmur ye
as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. Take heed
of murmuring as some of them did, (he speaks of the people of Israel in the
wilderness,) but says he, what came of it? They were destroyed of the
destroyer. Now the destroyer is thought to be the fiery-serpents that were sent
among them: They murmured, and God sent fiery serpents to sting them. What do
you think that such a cross and affliction does sting you? perhaps such an
affliction is upon you, and it seems to be grievous for the present, what? do
you murmur and repine? God has greater crosses to bring upon you: Those people
that murmur for the want of outward comforts, for want of water, (sometimes)
and for the want of bread, they murmur, but the Lord sends fiery-serpents among
them. I may say to a murmuring heart, Woe to thee that strivest with thy Maker:
woe to that man, that woman that strives against their Maker; what do thou
else, but strive against thy Maker? Thy Maker has the absolute dispose of
thee, and will thou strive against thy Maker? What does this murmuring
discontented heart of thine do otherwise but wrangle and contind and strive
even with God himself? Oh woe to him that strives against his Maker! I may
further say to thee, as Gods speaks to Job: Job, 38.1, 2. when Job was
impatient, Now God spoke (says the text) out of the whirlwind, and said, Who
is this that darkneth counsel by words without knowledge? So, do thou speak
against Gods ways, and his providence that has fallen out concerning thy
estate and outward comforts? who is this? Who is this that darkneth counsel by
words without knowledge? Where Is that man or woman whose hearts are so bold and
impudent, as dares speak against the administration of Gods providence?

The Tenth Evil of murmuring and discontent is this, There Is a great curse of
God upon it, so far as it does prevail in one that is wicked it has the curse
of God upon it. In Psalm. 59.15. see there what the curse of God is upon wicked
and ungodly men, Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
not satisfied. That is the imprecation and curse upon wicked and ungodly men,
that if they be not satisfied they shall grudge; when thou art not satisfied in
thy desires and find thy heart grudging against God, apply this Scripture,
What, is the curse of the wicked upon me? This is the curse that is threatened
upon wicked and ungodly ones, That they shall grudge if they be not satisfied.
And in Deuteronomy. 28.27. There it is threatened as a curse of God upon men, that they
cannot be content with their present condition, But they shall say in the
morning, would God it were even; and at even, would God it were morning; and so
they lie tossing up and down and cannot be content with any condition that they
are in, because of the sore afflictions that be upon them; and therefore it is
further threatened as a curse upon them, in the 34. verse, That they should be
mad for the sight of their eyes which they should see: This is but the
extremity of their discontentednesse; that is, they shall be so discontented,
as they shall be even mad: Many men and women in discontented moods are mad
kind of people, and though you may please your selves in such a mad kind of
behavior, yet know, that it is a curse of God upon men to be given up to a
kind of madness for evils that they suppose are upon them, and that they fear.
In the 47. verse, there is a notable expression for to show the curse of God
upon murmuring hearts; the Lord threatening the curses that shall be upon them,
(says he) verse 45, 46, and 47. The Curse shall pursue thee, and they shall be
upon thee for a sign, and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever: Because
thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart,
for the abundance of all things. God here threatens to bring his curse so upon
them, as to make them a wonder and a sign to others, why? Because they served
not the Lord with joyfulness of heart, (that may be added to that of the wrath
of God upon men) therefore God would bring such a curse upon them as would make
them a wonder to all that were about them; Oh how far art thou then that have a
murmuring heart, from serving the Lord with joyfulnesse?

The Eleventh evil of discontent and murmuring is this. There is much of the
spirit of Satan in a murmuring spirit. The Devil is the most discontented
creature that is in the world: He is the proudest creature that is, and the
discontentedst creature; and the most dejected creature. Now therefore so much
coffeehouse as thou have, so much of the spirit of Satan thou have. It was
the unclean spirit that went up and down and found no rest; so when a man or
woman's spirit has no rest, it is a sign that it has much of the unclean
spirit, of the spirit of Satan, and thou should think thus with thy self, Oh
Lord what have I the spirit of Satan upon me? It is Satan that is the most
discontented spirit that is, and Oh! how much of his spirit have I upon me that
can find no rest at all?

Twelfthly, Murmuring and discontent has this evil in it, There is an absolute
necessity that thou should have disquiet all the days of thy life. As if a
man that is in a great crowd should complain that other folks touch him; While
we are in this world God has so ordered things that afflictions must befall us,
and if we will complain and be discontented upon every cross and affliction,
why we must complain and be discontent all the days of our lives, yea God in
just judgment will let things fall out on purpose to vex those that have vexing
spirits, and discontented hearts, and therefore there is a necessity that they
should live disquiet all their days: and men will not much care to disquiet
those that are continually murmuring, Oh they will have disquiet all their
days.

Lastly, there is this dreadful evil in discontent and murmuring, God may justly
withdraw his care off you, and his protection over you, seeing God cannot
please you in his administrations. We use to say so to discontented servants;
nay, if you be not pleased mend your selves when you will. If you have a
servant not content with his diet and wages, and work, you say, mend your
selves; so may God justly say to us, we that profess our selves servants to
him, to be in his work, and yet are discontented with this thing or that in
Gods family, God might justly say, mend your selves. What if God should say to
any of you, If my care over you do not please you, then take care of your
selves, if my protection over you will not please you, then protect your
selves: Now all things that do befall you, befall you through a providence of
God, and if you be those that belong to God there is a protection of God over
you, and a care of God. Now if God should say, Well, you shall not have the
benefit of my protection any longer, and I will take no further care of you:
would not this be a most dreadful judgment of God from Heaven upon you? Take
heed what you do then in being discontent with Gods will toward you, and
indeed upon discontent this may befall you. And this is the reason why many
people though Gods protection has bin very gracious over them for a time, and
they have thriven abundantly, yet afterward almost all that behold them may
say that they live as if God had cast off his care over them, and as if God did
not care what befell them. Now then my brethren, put all these together, all
that we were speaking of the last day, and these particulars that have been
added now this morning for the setting out of a murmuring and discontented
spirit, Oh what an ugly face has this sin of murmuring, and discontentednesse,
Oh what cause is there that we should lay our hands upon our hearts, and go
away and be humbled before the Lord because of this! whereas your thoughts were
wont to be exercised about providing for your selves, and getting more comforts
to your selves, let the stream of your thoughts now be turned to humble your
selves for your discontentednesse, Oh that you may have your hearts break
before God, for otherwise you will fall to it again, Oh the wretchedness of
man's heart! You shall find in Scripture concerning the people of Israel, how
strangely they fell to their murmuring again and again, do but observe three
texts of Scripture, for that, the first in the 15. of Exodus at the beginning,
there you shall have Moses and the Congregation singing to God and blessing God
for his mercy, Then sang Moses and the Children of Israel this song unto the
Lord, and spoke saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed
gloriously, the Horse and his Rider has he thrown into the Sea. And then, The
Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation, he is my God and I
will prepare him an habitation, my Fathers God and I will exalt him; and so he
goes on, and who is like unto thee O Lord amongst the gods, who is like thee,
glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? Thus their hearts
triumphed in God, but mark before the Chapter is ended in the 23. verse, When
they came to Marah (in the same Chapter) they could not drink of the waters of
Marah for they were bitter, therefore the name of it was called Marah, and the
people murmured against Moses. After so great a mercy as this was, what
unthankfulnes was there here in their murmuring! Then God gave them water, but
in the very next Chapter they fell to their murmuring, (you read not that they
were humbled for their former murmuring, and therefore they murmur again) Exodus
16.1. etc. All the Congregation of the Children of Israel came to the
wilderness of Sin, etc. And the whole Congregation (in the second verse) of
the Children of Israel murmured against Moses, and against Aaron in the
wilderness, and the Children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had
dyed by the hand of the Lord in the Land of Egypt, when we sat by the
fleshpots, and when we did eat bread to the full. Now they want flesh, they
wanted water before, but now they want meat, they fell to murmuring again, they
were not humbled for this murmuring against God, neither when God gave them
flesh according to their desires, but they fell to murmuring again, they wanted
somewhat else. In the very next Chapter, (they went not far) in the 17 of Exodus
beginning. And all the Congregation of the Children of Israel journied from the
wilderness of Sin and pitthed in Rephadim, and there was no water for the
people to drink: then in the second verse, Wherefore the people did chide with
Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink, and Moses said unto them, Why
chide you with me? wherefore do you tempt the Lord? And in the third verse, And
the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses and
said, Wherefore is this, that thou have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us,
and our Children, and our Cattle with thirst? So one time after another, still
as soon as ever they had received the mercy then they were a little quieted,
but they were not humbled. I bring these Scriptures for this to show, that if
we have not been humbled for murmuring, the next cross that we meet withal we
will fall to murmuring again.

And now there are diverse agravations of this sin of murmuring, I Will mention
but one now, and I shall but begin that. The first Agravation is this.

To murmur when we enjoy abundance of mercy, the greater and the more abundant
the mercy is that we enjoy, the greater, and the viler is the sin of murmuring.
As here now when God had newly delivered them out of the house of bondage, for
them, now to murmur, because they want some few particulars that they desire,
Oh to sin against God after a great mercy this is a great agravation, and a
most abominable thing. Now my brethren, the Lord has granted us very great
mercies, I Will but speak a word of what God has done of late, what mercies has
the Lord granted to us this summer, heaped mercies upon us, one mercy upon
another, what a condition were we in at the beginning of this summer? and what
a different condition are we in now! Oh what a mercy is it that the Lord has
not taken advantages against us, that he has not made those Scriptures (before
mentioned) good upon us for all our murmuring, the Lord has gone on with one
mercy after another. We hear of mercy in Bristol, and mercy to our brethren
in Scotland: But still if after this we should have any thing befall us that is
but cross to us, that we should be ready to murmur again presently; Oh let us
not so requite God for those mercies of his; Oh let us take heed of giving God
any ill requital for his mercies; Oh give God praise according to his excellent
greatness, to his excellent goodness and grace.

And now has God given to you the Contentment of your hearts? Take you heed of
being the cause of any grief to your brethren, think not that because God has
been gracious unto you, that therefore he has given you liberty for to bring
them into bondage, Oh let not there be such an il effect of Gods mercy to you,
as for you to exclude by petitioning, or any other way your Brethren that the
Lord has been pleased to make Instruments of your peace, let not that be the
fruit of it, nor to desire any thing that your selves do not yet understand.
God is very jealous of the glory of his mercy, and if there should be an ill
use made of the mercy of God after we enjoy it, Oh it would go to the heart of
God! nothing is more grievous to the heart of God than the abuse of mercy: As
now, if any way that is hard and rigid should be taken toward our Brethren,
and those especially that God has made such special Instruments of good to us,
that have been so willing to venture their lives, and all for us; now when we
have our turns served, let God and his People, and Servants that have been a
means to save us shift for themselves as well as they can: Oh! this is a great
aggravation of your sin, to sin against the mercies of God: But for this
Aggravation, and specially in this particular, we shall speak to (God willing)
the next day.

SERMON IX.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


NOW because it is very hard to work upon a murmuring spirit, there are diverse
aggravations (I told you) we are to consider of for the further setting out of
the greatness of this sin; I mentioned but only one the last day, now we shall
proceed in that.

The first Agravation of the sin of discontent and murmuring is this, For men
and women to be discontent in the midst of mercies, in enjoyment of abundance
of mercies. To be discontent in any afflicted condition, is sinful and evil,
but to be discontent when we are in the midst of Gods mercies, when we are
not able to count the mercies of God, yet after to be discontent because we
have not all we would have, this is a greater evil. I only mentioned this the
last day, that I might show to you what a great sin it is at such a time as
this. The Lord this summer has multiplied mercies one upon another, the Lord
has made this summer to be a continued miracle of mercy; never did a Kingdom
enjoy (in so little space of time) such mercies one upon another: Now the
public mercies of God should quiet our hearts and keep us from discontent; and
the sin of discontent for private afflictions is exceedingly aggravated by the
consideration of public mercies to the Land; when the Lord has bin so
merciful to the Land, will thou be feetting and murmuring, because thou have
not in thy family all the comforts that thou would have? As it is a great
aggravation of a man's evil for him to rejoice immoderately in his own private
comforts when the Church is in affliction, when the public suffers grievous
and hard troubles, if any man shall then rejoice and give liberty to himself,
at that time to satisfy his flesh to the uttermost in all outward comforts,
this is a great aggravation of his sin: So on the contrary for any man to be
immoderately troubled for any private afflictions when it goes well with the
public, with the Churches, this is a great aggravation of his sin: It may be
when the Church of God was lowest, and it went worst in other parts, yet thou
did abate nothing of the comfort of thy flesh, but gave full liberty to
satisfy thy flesh as formerly, know this was thy great sin; so on the other
side when we have received such mercies in public, we should have all our
private afflictions swallowed up in the public merci^s* and we should think
with our selves, though we be afflicted for our particular, yet (blessed be
God) it goes well with the Church, and with the public; the consideration of
that should mightily quiet our hearts in all our private discontents, and if it
does not so, know that our sin is much increased by the mercies of God that are
abroad. Now shall Gods mercies aggravate our sins? This is a sad thing, this is
to turn the mercies of God to be our misery. Did not thou pray to God for
these mercies that God has sent of late to the public, these great victories
that God has given, did not thou pray for them? now thou have them, Is not
there enough in them to quiet thy heart for some private trouble thou meetest
withal in thy family? Is not there goodness enough there to cure thy
coffeehouse? Certainly they were not such mercies worthy to be prayed for,
except they have so much excellency in them as to countervail some private
afflictions. Public mercies are the aggravation of private discontent, as so of
public discontent too; if we receive so many public mercies, yet if every
thing goes not in the public according as we desire, if we be discontent at
that it will exceedingly aggravate our sin, God may say, what shall I bestow
such mercies upon a people, and yet if they have not every thing they would
have they will be discontent? Oh! it is exceeding evil. So in particular, the
mercies that concerns thy self, thy family, if thou would consider thou have
a great many more mercies than thou had afflictions, I dare boldly aver it
concerning any one in this Congregation, (suppose thy afflictions be what they
will) there is never a one of you but that have more mercies than afflictions.

Object. You will say, I, but you do not know what our afflictions are, our
afflictions are so as you do not conceive of them because you feel them not?

Answ. Though I cannot know what your afflictions are, yet I know what your
mercies are, and I know they are so great as I am sure there can be no
afflictions in this world so great as the mercies you have: If it we^e but this
mercy, that you have this day of grace and salvation continued to you, it is a
greater mercy than any affliction, set any affliction by this mercy and see
which would weigh heaviest, this is certainly greater than any affliction; that
you have the day of grace and salvation, that you are not now in Hell, this is
a greater mercy, that you have the sound of the Gospel yet in your ears; that
you have the use of your reason; this is a greater mercy than your
afflictions; that you have the use of your limbs, your senses, that you have
the health of your bodies, health of body is a greater mercy than poverty is an
affliction, there is no man that is rich but if he be wise, if he has a sickly
body, he would part with all his riches that he might have his health,
therefore thy mercies are more than thy afflictions. We find in Scripture how
the holy Ghost does aggravate the sin of discontent from the consideration of
mercies, you have a notable Scripture for it in the 16, of Numb. 8. verse etc.
It Is a speech of Moses to Korah and his company when they murmured, And Moses
said unto Korah, hear I pray you ye sons of Levi, (there is somewhat that you
are sons of Levi,) Seems it but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel
has separated you from the Congregation of Israel, to bring you near to
himself to do the service of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before
the Congregation to minister unto them? Korah and his company were murmuring,
but mark how Moses aggravates this; Seems it a small thing unto you that the
God of Israel has separated you from the Congregation of Israel to bring you
near to himself to do the service of the Tabernacle of the Lord? etc. You see
it is a great honor that God puts upon a man a great mercy that he does bestow
upon any man to separate him from others for himself, to come near to him, to
employ him in the service of the Tabernacle, to minister to the Congregation in
holy things, this is a great mercy, and indeed it is such a mercy as one would
think there should be none that God bestows such a mercy upon that should have
a murmuring heart for any affliction; It Is true, many Ministers of God they
meet with hard things that might discourage them, and trouble and grieve their
spirits, but now this consideration that God is pleased to employ them in such
a service near to himself, that though they cannot do good to themselves, yet
they may do good to others, this should quiet them. And yet in the 10. verse,
And he has brought thee near to him, and all thy Brethren the Sons of Levi
with thee, and seek ye the Priesthood also? have not you enough already? but
still you are discontented with what you have and must have more, seek ye yet
more? Seek ye the Priesthood also? for which cause both thou and all thy
company are gathered together against the Lord: And what is Aaron that ye
murmur against him? what has God given you such things, and yet will you be
murmuring, because you cannot have more? Me thinks that this place should keep
Ministers from murmuring, though they should meet with never such afflictions
and crosses, and unkind dealings from men, yet still they should go on with
hearts quieted and comforted in the work that God has set them about, and
labor to countervaile all their Afflictions by being more abundant in the work
of the Lord. That is the first text of Scripture that shows how the mercies we
enjoy are Aggravations to the sin of murmuring.

And then a second Scripture is in the 2. of Job, 10. verse. A speech of Job to
his wife, what says Job when his wife would have had him curse God and die?
(that was a degree beyond murmuring) says he, Thou speak as one of the
foolish women, shall we receive good at the band of God and not evil? you see
Job did help himself against all murmuring thoughts against the ways of God
with this consideration, that he had received so much good from the Lord; what
though we receive evil, yet do not we receive good as well as evil? let us set
one against the other, that is the way we should go. In the 17. of Ecclesiastes
the 14. verse. you have a notable Scripture there whereby you may see what
course is to be taken when the heart rises in murmuring, In the day of
prosperity be joyful, but in the day of Adversity consider; what should they
consider? (mark what follows) God also has set the one over against the other,
to the end that man should find nothing after him. God also has set the one
over against the other, that is thus, When thou art in prosperity, then indeed
every man can be joyful, but what if Afflictions befalls him, what then? then
consider, consider what? That God has set one over against the other, thou
have a great deal of Affliction, and thou have had a great deal of prosperity,
thou have many troubles, and thou have had many mercies, make one column of
mercies, and one column of afflictions, and write one against the other, and
fee if God has not filled one column as full as the other, you look altogether
upon your afflictions, but look upon your mercies also; for instance, It may be
God has afflicted you in one child, but he has been merciful to you in
another child, set one against the other, God afflicted David in Absalom, but
he was merciful to David in Solomon, and therefore when David cried out, Oh
Absalom my Son my Son! if David had thought upon Solomon, and cried, Oh Solomon
my son my son, it would have quieted him. And it may be God has been merciful
to thee in a wife, or in thy husband, set that against thy affliction, it may
be God crosses thee in thy estate, but it may be he does employ thee in his
service, it may be thou art afflicted in some of thy friends, but thou have
other friends that are great mercies to thee, and therefore you should set one
against the other, and it does concern you so to do, for those mercies will be
aggravations of your sins, and you had better make Gods mercies a means to
lessen your sins, than to be the aggravation of your sins: If you make not the
mercies of God to help you against your murmuring, you will make them to be
aggravations of the sin of murmuring: I beseech you for this take but this one
consideration further, and if you will but work it upon your hearts I hope you
may find a great deal of power in it, You find afflictions, and your hearts are
troubled and murmur, consider how Gods mercies does aggravate this sin, thus:
In the midst of our sins we do make account God should accept of our services,
do but consider thus, if in the midst of our many sins we hope that God will
accept of our poor services, why then should not we in the midst of our
afflictions bless God for his many mercies? shall God be thus gracious to us
that notwithstanding our many sins, yet he will not cast away our poor duties
and services that we perform, then why should not we in the midst of our
sufferings accept of what mercies we have, and not slight them and disregard
them? If thou in the midst of Gods mercies shall not be willing to bear
afflictions that God lays upon thee, then it were just with God that in the
midst of thy sins he should not regard any of thy duties, now is there not as
much power in thy manifold sins to cause God to reject thy duties and services,
as there is power in afflictions (in the midst of many mercies) to take off thy
heart from being affected with Gods mercies? And that is the first aggravation
of the sin of murmuring, to murmur in the midst of mercies.

A Second Aggravation of the sin of murmuring is, When we murmur for small
things. Says Naamans servant to him, Father (for so he called him) if the
Prophet had required you to do some great thing, would not you have done it?
how much more this little thing. So I say, if the Lord had required you to
suffer some great matter, would not you have been willing to suffer? How much
more this little thing. I remember I have read in Seneca a Heathen, he has
this similitude which is a very fine one to set out the great evil of murmuring
upon smaller afflictions, (says he) Suppose a man has a very fair house to
dwell in, and he has fair orchyards and gardens, and set about with brave tall
trees for ornament, if this man now should murmur because the wind blows off a
few leaves off his trees, what a most unreasonable thing were it for him to be
weeping and wringing his hands because he loses a few leaves off his trees,
when he has abundance of all kind of fruit? thus it is with many (says he)
though they have a great many comforts about them, yet some little matter, the
blowing off of a few leaves from them is enough to disquiet them. It was a
great evil when Ahab having a kingdom, yet the want of his neighbors vinyard
had such power to disquiet him: So for us to murmur, not because we have not
such a thing as we have need of, but because we have not what possibly we might
have, this is a very great sin. Suppose God gives a child that has all the
limbs and parts complete, a child that is very comely, and has excellent parts,
wit, and memory, but it may be there is a wart that grows upon the finger of
the child, and she murmurs at it, and Oh what an affliction is this to her! she
is so taken up with that as she forgets to give any thanks to God for her
child, and all the goodness of God to her in the child is swallowed up in
that; would not you say, this were a folly and a very great evil in a woman so
to do? Truly our afflictions if we weighed them aright they are but such kind
of things in comparison of our mercies. Rebeckah she had a mighty desire to
have children, but because she found some trouble in her body when she was with
child, says she, Why am I thus? As if she should say, I had as good have none,
only because she found a little pain and trouble in her body. To be discontent
when the affliction is small and little, that increases very much the sin of
murmuring, it is to much for any one to murmur upon the heaviest cross that
can befall one in this world, but upon some small things to be discontent and
murmur, that is worse. I have read of one when he lay upon a heap of
damask-roses, he complained that there was one of the rose leaves lay double
under him: So we are ready thus for very small things to make complaints and
to be discontented with our condition. And that is a Second aggravation.

A Third aggravation is this, For men that are of parts and abilities, that God
has given wisdom to, for them to be discontent and murmur, that is more than
if others do it. Murmuring and discontentednesse is too much in the weakest,
yet we can bear with it sometimes in children and women that are weak, but for
those that are men, men of understanding, that have wisdom, that God imployes
in public service, that they should be discontent with every thing, this is an
exceeding great evil; for men in their families (to whom God has given parts
and wisdom) when things fall out amiss there, to be always murmuring and
repining, their sin is greater than for women or children to do it.

A fourth aggravation, Is the consideration of the freeness of all Gods mercies
to us. What ever we have it is of free cost, what though we have not all we
would have, seeing what we have is free? If what we have were earned then it
were somewhat, but when we consider that all is from God, for us to murmur at
his dispensations is very evil. Suppose a man were in a family entertained by
a friend, and he did not pay for his board, but he has it given him for
nothing, it is expected such a one should not be ready to find fault with every
thing in the house, with servants or with meat at table or the like, i^ such a
one that has plentiful provision and all given him Gratis, and paies nothing
for his board, should be discontented if a cup should not be filled for him as
he would have it, or if he should stay a minute of an hour longer for a thing
than he would, this we would account a great evil: So it is with us, we are at
Gods table every day, and it is upon free-cost whatever we have: It is
accounted very unmannerly for a man at his friends table to find fault with
things, though at home he may be bold: Now when we are at the table of God (for
so all Gods administrations to us are his table) and are at free-cost, now for
us to be finding fault and be discontented this is a great Aggravation of our
sin.

A fifth Aggravation of the sin of murmuring is this, When men and women murmur
and are discontented and impatient when they have the things that they were
discontented for the want of before they had them. So it is sometimes with
children, they will cry for such a thing, and when you give it them then throw
it away, they are as much discontented as they were before. So it was with the
people of Israel, nothing would quiet them but they must have a King, Samuel
persuaded them to be contrary, and told them what kind of King they should
have; and when they had a King, Hos. 10.3. What shall a King do to us? they
were not contented when they had one. So Rachel, she must have children or else
she died, and when she had a little trouble she was discontented too; so that
we are neither well full nor fasting (as we use to say.)

The sixth Aggravation of the sin of murmuring is this, For those men and women
to be discontent and murmur that God has raised from mean and low estates and
conditions; This is a very great aggravation if thou be discontent now: There
was a time when thou were low enough, and perhaps when thou were so low then
thou did say, oh if God would deliver me from such an affliction, or give me
but a little more in my estate I should think my self in a good condition: but
if God by his providence does raise thee, thou art as greedy of more still as
thou were before, and as much discontented as thou were before: this is an evil
thing for people that had mean breeding, and poor beginings for them to be so
nice, and dainty that nothing can please them, whereas there was a time not
long since that they were low and mean enough; but it is very ordinary for
those that are raised from a low and mean condition to be the more nice and
dainty, and more proud when they are raised than others that are of better
breeding: It Is to much for a child to be discontented in his fathers house, but
if a man has taken a poor beggar boy, if you had taken such a one into your
house that lay begging at your door, and set him at your own table, could you
bear that such a one should complain that such a thing is not well dressed, or
the like, you could not bear it if your children should do it, but you could
bear it a great deal better with them than to hear such a one do it: But thou
art a poor beggar, and God has (as it were) taken thee into his great family,
and if the Lord has been pleased to raise thee higher, that now thou have a
competency, that thou may live as a man, to be of use and service in the
place where God has set thee, now will thou be discontent because thou have
not every thing that thou desire? We know the Prodigal, when he came to
himself, Oh! says he, In my fathers house is bread enough. He did not say,
there is good-chear enough, and a great deal of dainties; no, he thought of
nothing but bread, there is bread enough: So it is ordinary for men and women
when they are in a low condition, they think that if they may have bread, any
competency, they will be contented and bless God, but when they have their
bread and things convenient, they must have more or else they are not
contented; know that this is an exceeding great aggravation to thy
coffeehouse, when you are raised from a very low condition and yet you
cannot be contented with what you have.

A Seventh Aggravation of this sin is this, For them to be discontent that have
been very great sinners and ungodly in their former time. For men and women
that have much guiltiness upon them, the guilt of very many sins upon them,
that have provoked God exceedingly against them, and have brought themselves in
a most dreadful manner under the sentence of Gods justice, and yet God being
pleased to reprieve them, for them to murmur and to be discontent with Gods
administrations toward them, this is exceeding evil, Oh it were consideration
enough to quiet any murmuring in our hearrs, to think thus, We are but sinners,
why should not we be sufferers that are sinners? but then consider, we that are
such great sinners, guilty of such notorious sins, that it is a wonder that we
are out of Hell at this present, yet for us to be discontent and murmur, how
exceedingly does this increase our sin! Consider how we have crossed God in our
sins, then if God should cross us in the way of our sufferings, should not
we sit down quiet without murmuring? Certainly thou never knew what it was
to be humbled for thy manifold sins, that art discontented at any
administration of God toward thee.

The Eighth Agravation of the sin of murmuring is, For those men that are of
little use in the world, for them to be discontented. If you have but a beast
that you make much use of, you will feed it well, but if you have but litttle
use of him then you turn him into the commons, little provision serves his turn
because you make not use of him: If we lived so as to be exceeding useful to
God and his Church, we might expect that God would be pleased to come in in
some encouraging way to us, but when our consciences tell us, we live and do
but little service for God, what if God should turn us upon the commons, yet we
are fed according to our work? according to our employment? why should any
creature be servicable to thee, who art so little servicable to God? This one
meditation would much help us, to think, I am discontent because such and such
creatures are not servicable to me, but why should I expect that they should be
servicable to me when I am not servicable to God? And that is the Eighth
Aggravation.

A Ninth Aggravation of the sin of murmuring is this, For us to be discontent
at that time when God is about to humble us. It should be the care of a
Christian, to observe what are Gods ways toward him, what is God about to do
with me at this time? Is God about to raise me, to comfort me? let me close
with Gods goodness, and bless his Name, let me join with the work of God,
when he offers mercy to me to take the mercy he offers. But again, Is God about
to humble me? is God about to break my heart, and to bring my heart down to
him? let me join with God in this work of his, this is for a Christian to walk
with God. It is said that Enoch, and Noah walked with God; walked with God,
what is that? That is, To observe what is the work of God that God is now about,
and to join with God in that work of his; so that according as God turns this
way or that way the heart should turn with Grd, and have suitable workings unto
the workings of God toward him. Now then, I am discontented and murmuring
because I am afflicted; Therefore thou art afflicted because God would humble
thee, and the great design that God has in afflicting of thee, is to break and
humble thy heart; and will thou now maintain a spirit quite opposite to the
work of God? for thee to murmur and be discontented is to resist the work of
God, God is doing thee good if thou could see it, now if he be pleased to
sanctify thy affliction to break that hard heart of thine, and humble that
proud spirit of thine, it would be the greatest mercy that ever thou had in
all thy life, now will thou yet stand out against God? it is even as if thou
should say, well, the Lord is about to break me, and humble me, but he shall
not; this is the language of thy murmuring and thy discontentednesse, though
thou dare not say so, but though thou say not so in words, yet it is
certainly the language of the temper of thy spirit, Oh consider what an
aggravation this is: I am discontented when God is about to work such a work
upon me as is exceedingly for my good, but yet I stand out against him and
resist him, and that is another aggravation.

A tenth Aggravation of the sin of murmuring and discontent is this, The more
palpable and remarkable the hand of God appears to bring about an affliction,
the greater is the sin of murmuring and discontent under an affliction. It Is a
great evil any time to murmur and be discontent, but though it be a sin, when I
see but an ordinary providence working for me not to submit to that, but when I
see an extraordinary providence working that is a greater sin, that is, when I
see the Lord in some remarkable way working about such an affliction beyond
what any could have thought of, shall I resist such a remarkable hand of God,
shall I stand out against God when I see God does express his will in such a
remarkable manner that he would have me to be in such a condition? indeed
before we see the will of God apparent we may desire to avoid an affliction,
and may use means for it, but now when we see God expressing his will from
heaven in a manner beyond ordinary and more remarkably, then certainly it is
fit for us to fall down and submit to him, and not to oppose when God comes
with a mighty stream against us, it is our best way to fall down before him and
not to resist; for as it is an argument of a man's disobedience, when there is
not only a command against a sin but when God reveals his command in a terrible
way, the more solemn the command of God is, the greater is the sin in breaking
that command; so the more remarkable the hand of God is in bringing an
affliction upon us, the greater is the sin for us to murmur and be
discontented. Then God expects that we should fall down when he (as it were)
speaks from Heaven to thee by name and says, well, I will have this spirit of
thine down, do not you see that my hand is stretched out, my eyes are upon you,
my thoughts are upon you, and I must have that proud spirit of thine down? Oh
then it is fit for the creature to yield and submit unto him. When you speak in
an ordinary manner to your servants, or children, you expect they should regard
what you say, but when you make them stand still by you and you speak to them
in a more solemn way, then if they should disregard what you say, you are very
impatient: So certainly God cannot take it well when ever he does appear from
Heaven in such a remarkable way to bring an affliction, if then we do not
submit to him.

The eleventh aggravation of the sin of murmuring is this, To be discontented
though God has been exercising of us long under afflictions, yet still to
remain discontented. For a man or woman at first when an affliction befalls them
to have a murmuring heart then it is an evil, but to have a murmuring heart when
God has been a long time exercising them with affliction it is more evil.
Though an heifer at first when the yoke is put upon him he wrigles up and down
and will not be quiet, but if after many months or years it shall not draw
quietly, the husbandman would rather feed it fat and prepare it for the butcher
than be troubled any longer with it: So though the Lord was content to pass by
that discontented spirit of thine at first, yet God having a long time kept the
yoke upon thee, thou have bin under his afflicting hand (it may be) diverse
years; and yet thou remain discontent still; it were just with God that he
should bear thy murmuring no longer, and that thy discontent under the
affliction should be but a preparation to thy destruction. So you see when a
man or woman has been long exercised with afflictions and yet are discontent,
that is an aggravation of the sin: Mark that text in Heb. 12.11. Now (says the
Scripture) No chastening for the present is joyous, but grievous, nevertheless
afterward it yields the peacable fruit of righteousness unto them which are
exercised thereby. It Is true, our afflictions are not joyous but grievous,
though at first when our affliction comes it is very grievous, but yet (says
the text) afterward it yields the peacable fruit of righteousness to those
that are exercised thereby; when thou have been a long time in the School of
afflictions, thou art a very dullard in Christ's School if thou have not learned
this Contentment, I have learned (says Saint Paul) in every state therewith to
be content: Paul had learned this lesson quickly, thou have been a learning
many years, perhaps thou may say as Heman did, That thou art afflicted from
thy youth up, in the 88. Psalm. Oh it is a very evil thing if being exercised
long with afflictions you are not yet contented: The eye in the body of a man
is as tender a part as any part that a man's body has, but yet the eye is able
to continue in and bear a great deal of cold, because it is more used to it; so
those that are used to afflictions, those that God exercises much with
afflictions, (though they have tender spirits otherwise) yet they should have
learned contentedness by this time. A new cart may creek and make a noise, but
after the use of it a while it will not do so: So when thou were first a
Christian and newly come into the work of Christ, perhaps thou make a noise
and can not bear affliction: but art thou an old Chistian and yet will thou
be a murmuring Christian? Oh that is a shame for any that are ancient
professors, that have been a long time in the School of Jesus Christ to have
murmuring and discontented spirits. And thus you have had Eleven Aggravations
of this sin of murmuring and discontent.

But now my brethren because this discontented humor is a very tough humor,
and it is very hard to work upon, there is none that are discontented but will
have something to say for their discontent, I shall therefore desire to take
away what every discontented heart has to say for himself.

The Pleas of a discontented heart.
In the first place, Says one that is discontented, It is not coffeehouse,
it is the sense of my condition, I hope you would have me sensible of my
condition: perhaps when God takes away a friend or some other comfort they are
inordinatly sorrowful, and wringing their hands as if they were undone, and let
any one but speak to them, (say they) Would you not have me sensible of my
affliction? And thus many would hide their sinful murmuring under Gods hand
with this pretense, that it is but sensibleness of their affliction.

To that I answer, First, there is no sense of any affliction that will hinder
the sense of Gods mercies, nay the more we are sensible of our afflictions if
it be in a gracious manner, the more sensible we will be of Gods mercy, but
thou art so sensible of thy affliction as it takes away the sense of all thy
mercies; Oh this is sinful discontent, this is not to be sensible of thy
condition as God would have thee, but it is to be sensible in a wicked way, you
go beyond your bounds: By this rule you may come to know when your sorrows and
troubles for your afflictions goes beyond the bounds, we may be sorrowful when
God afflicts, but Oh! that I might know when my sorrow goes beyond the bounds
of it; truly thou may know it by this, does the sense of thy afflictions
take away the sense of thy mercies? If it does then it goes beyond the bounds.

Secondly, If it were but a bare sense of an affliction it would not hinder
thee in the duties of thy condition, the right sense of our afflictions will
never hinder us in the performance of the duties of our condition, but thou art
so sensible of thy affliction as thou art made unfit for the performance of the
duties of the condition that God has put thee in, surely it is more then mere
sense of thy affliction.

Thirdly, If it were but mere sense of thy affliction, yet then thou could
in this thy condition bless God for the mercies that others have, but thy
discontentednesse usually breeds envy at it, when any one is discontented with
their condition, they have an envious spirit at the conditions of those that
are delivered from what afflictions they bear, certainly then it is turned to be
sour and naught, when thou art so sensible of thy afflictions, and unsensible
of mercies as thou art unfit for the duties of thy condition, and envious at
others that are not afflicted as thou art.

The Second Plea.
But will a discontented heart say, I am not so much troubled with my
afflictions, but it is for my sin rather than my affliction, and I hope you will
give leave that we should be troubled and discontented with our sin, and were
it not for sin that I see in my self I should not be so discontented as I am,
Oh! it is sin that is heavy upon me, and it is that that troubles me more than
my afflictions.

Deceive not thine own heart, there is a very great deceit in this, there is
many people that when Gods hand is out against them they will say, they are
troubled for their sin, but the truth is, it is the affliction that does trouble
them rather than their sin, their heart does exceedingly deceive them in this
very thing: For,

First, They were never troubled for their sin before this Affliction came; but
you will say, It Is true, I was not before, for my prosperity blinded me, but
now God has opened mine eyes by afflictions: Has he so?

Secondly, Then thy great care will be rather for the removing of thy sin, than
thy affliction, art thou more solicitous about the taking away thy sin, than
the taking away of thine affliction?

Thirdly, If it be thy sin that troubles thee, if God should take away thy
afflictions, yet except thy sin be taken away, and thy heart be better, this
would not content thee, thou could not be satisfied: but we see it
ordinarily, that if God removes their afflictions there is no more trouble for
their sin. Oh! many do belly themselves in this, in saying, that they are so
troubled for their sin, and especially those that are so troubled that they are
in danger to miscarry, and to make away themselves, there is not one in ten
thousand that are in such a condition as this is, but it is afflictions rather
than sin that puts them to it; indeed you lay all upon this, as if it were the
work of the word or the spirit of bondage: I remember I heard not long since of
a Divine that being judicious, and used to such kind of things, there came a
man to him mightily troubled for his sin, and he could not tell what to do, he
was ready to despair, the Divine looks upon him, says he, are you not in
debt? he confessed that he was; and at length the Minister began to find it out,
that that was his trouble rather than his sin, and so was a means to help him
that way, that his Creditors should not come upon him, and then the man was
pretty quiet, and would not make away himself any longer, for it is a usual
thing, that if any thing befalls a man that does cross him, Oh then it is their
sin that does trouble them. Sometimes it is thus with servants, if their
Governors cross them, then they are vexed and fre^, and come to deal with
them, Oh then they will say they are sorrowful for their sin: but we must take
heed of dallying with God* that is the Seer and Searcher of the secrets of all
hearts, many of you go sullen and dumpish up and down your families, and then
you say it is your sin that lies upon you, when God knows it is otherwise, it is
because you cannot have your wills as you would have.

Fourthly, If thou be troubled for thy sin, then it will be thy great care
not to sin in thy trouble; not by thy trouble to increase thy sin, but thou art
troubled in such a way as the truth is thou do increase thy sin in thy
trouble, and since thou say thou were troubled for thy sin thou have
committed more sin than thou did before.

And then lastly, if it be thy sin that troubles thee, then thou have the more
need to submit to Gods hand; and accept of the punishment of thine iniquity, as
it is in Levit. 26.41. There Is no such consideration to take away murmuring, as
to look upon my sin ae the cause of my affliction.

The Third Plea.
Oh says another, I find my Affliction is such that God withdraws himself from
me in mine Affliction, that is that that troubles me, and can any body be quiet
then, can any body be satisfied with such a condition when the Lord shall
withdraw himself? Were my Affliction never so great, yet if I find not God
withdrawing himself from me I hope I could be content with any Affliction, but
I cannot find the presence of God with me in this Affliction, as some times I
have found; and it is that that troubles me, and makes me to be in such a
condition as I am.

Now to that I answer thus, First, it is a very evil thing for men and women
upon every Affliction to conclude that God is departed from them, it may be
when it comes to be examined there is no other reason why thou think that
God is withdrawn and departed, but because he does afflict thee, now for thee
to make such a conclusion, that every time God lays an Affliction upon thee he
is departed; this is a sinful distemper of thy heart, and is very dishonorable
to God, and grievous to his Spirit. In the 17. of Exodus 7. verse, you may see
how God was displeased there with such a kind of distemper as this is, And he
called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the chiding of the
Children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord
amongst us or not? Mark, they did murmur because they were brought into
Afflictions, but see what the Text says, therefore the place was called Massah
and Meribah, because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord amonst us or
not? This was to tempt God, sometimes we are afraid God is departed from us,
and it was merely because we are afflicted, I beseech you observe that
Scripture, God calls it a tempting of him when he afflicts any, for them to
conclude and say that God is departed from them. If a child should cry out of
his Father, and say that his Father is turned to be an enemy to him, because he
does correct him, this would be taken ill, I beseech you consider of this one
place, it may be of very great use to you, that you may not be ready to think
that God is departed because you are afflicted.

Secondly, If God be departed, the greatest sign of Gods departing is because
you are so disquiet, you make your disquiet be the fruit of Gods departing, and
if it comes to be examined your disquiet is the cause of Gods departing from
you, if you could but cure your disquiet, if you could but quiet your own
hearts and get them into a better frame of contentedness under Gods hand in
afflicting of you, then you would find Gods presence with you, will you be thus
disquiet till God comes again to you? your disquiet drives him from you, and
you can never expect Gods coming to manifest himself comfortably to your souls,
till you have gotten your hearts quiet under your afflictions; and therefore
here you see how crosly you reason, you reason, I am disquiet because God is
gone, when the truth is God is gone because thou art disquiet; reason but the
other way, Oh my disquiet has driven God from me, and therefore as ever I
would have the presence of God to come again to me, let my heart be quiet under
the hand of God.

Thirdly, Do thou find God departing from thee in thine affliction? will thou therefore depart from God too? is this thy help? Can thou help thy self
that way? Because God is gone will thou go too? Do I indeed feel God departing
from me? It may be it is so, it may be God for thy trial is departed a little
from thee, and is it so indeed? what unwise course do I take? I commit further
sin and so I go further off from God, what a case am I in? God goes from me,
and I from God: If the child sees the mother going from it, it is not for the
child to say, my mother is gone yonder and I will go the other way, no, but the
child goes crying after the mother; and so should the soul say, I see the Lord
is withdrawing his presence from me, and now it is best for me to make after
the Lord with all my might, and I am sure this murmuring humor is not a making
after God, but by this I go further and further off from God, and what a
distance is there like to be between God and me within a little while? These
are some of the reasonings and pleas of a murmuring and discontented heart:
there are many others that we shall meet withal, and endeavor to speak to your
hearts in them, that so this tough humor of discontent may (as it were) be cut
with the Word and softened with the Word, that so it may pass away: for that is
the way of Physicians when they meet with a body that has any tough humor
then they give that that has a peircing quality, when there is a tough humor
that stops the water that it cannot pass, they give that that has a peircing
quality that may make passage for it; and so thou have need of such things that
are piercing to make way through this tough humor that is in the spirits of
men and women whereby they come to live very uncomfortably to themselves and
others, and very dishonorable unto God.

SERMON X.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


NOW there are many Pleas and reasonings yet remain, for there is a great deal
of do with a discontented murmuring heart. And I remember I find that the same
Hebrew word that signifies [ to lodge, to abide] it signifies to murmur, they
use one word for both, for murmuring is a distemper that does lodge in men,
where it gets in once it lodges abides and continues, and therefore that we
may unlodge it and get it out, we will labor to show what are the further
reasonings of a discontented heart.

The Fourth Plea.
Me thinks I could be content with Gods hand (says one) so far as I see the
hand of God in a thing I can be content: but when men deal so unreasonably and
unjustly with me I know not how to bear it, I can bear it that I should be in
Gods hands, but not in the hands of men: my friends or acquaintance when they
deal so unrighteously with me, Oh this goes very hard unto me, that I know not
how to bear it from men.

For the taking away of this reasoning, first, Though they be men that bring
this cross upon you, yet they are Gods Instruments, God has a hand in it, and
they can go no further then God would have them go. This was that that quieted
David when Shimei cursed him, (says he) God has a hand in it, though Shimei be
a base wicked man yet I look beyond him to God. So, is there any of your
friends that deal injuriously with you, and cross with you, look up to God and
see that man but as an instrument in Gods hands.

Secondly, If this be your trouble that men do so wrong you, you are rather to
turn your hearts to pity them than to murmur or be discontented: For the truth
is, if you be wronged by other men, you have the better of it, for it is better
to bear wrong than to do wrong a great deal, if they wrong you your heart
cannot submit; you are in a better condition than they, because it is better to
bear than do wrong. I remember it is said of Socrates that being very patient
when wrong was done to him, they asked him how he came to be so, says he, If I
meet with a man in the street that is a diseased man, shall I be vexed and
fretted with him because he is diseased? those that wrong me I look upon them
as diseased men and therefore pity them.

Thirdly, Though you meet with hard dealings from men; yet you meet mith
nothing but kind good and righteous dealings from God: when you meet with
unrighteous dealings from them, set one against the other. And that is for the
answer to the fourth Plea.

A Fifth Plea.
Oh but that affliction that comes upon me is an affliction that I never looked
for, I never thought to have met with such an affliction, and that is that I
know not how to bear, that is that which makes my heart so disquiet because it
was altogether unlookt for and unexpected.

For the answer of this, first, it is thy weakness and folly that thou did
not look for it and expect it, In Acts, 20.22, 23. see what Saint Paul says
concerning himself, And now behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem,
not knowing the things that shall befall me there, save that the Holy Ghost
witnesses in every City saying, that bonds and afflictions abide me. It Is true
says he, I know not the particular affliction that may befall me, but this I
know that the Spirit of God witnesses that bonds and afflictions shall abide
me every where, I look for nothing else but bonds and afflictions wheresoever
go; so a Christian should do, he should look for afflictions wheresoever he is,
in all conditions he should look to meet with afflictions, and therefore if any
affliction should befall him, though indeed he could not foresee the
particular evil, yet he should think, this is no more than I looked for in the
general. Therefore no affliction should come unexpectedly to a Christian.

A second answer I would give is this, Is it unexpected? then the less
provision thou made for it before it came, the more careful should thou be
to sanctify Gods Name in it now it is come: it is in this case of afflictions
as in mercies, many times mercy comes unexpected (and that might be a third
answer) to you, set one against the other, I have many mercies that I never
looked for as well as afflictions that I never looked for, why should not one
rejoice me as well as the other disturbs me? As it is in mercies, when they
come unexpected, the less preparation there was in me for receiving mercy, the
more need I have to be careful, now to give God the glory of the mercy, and to
sanctify Gods Name in the enjoyment of the mercy; Oh so it should be with us
now, we have had mercies this summer that we never expected and therefore we
were not prepared for them, now we should be so much the more careful to give
God the glory of them: so when afflictions come that we did not expect, then it
seems we laid not in for them before hand, we had need be the more careful to
sanctify Gods Name in them, we should have spent some pains before to prepare
for afflictions and we did not, then take so much the more pains to sanctify
God in this affliction now. And that is a fifth reasoning.

The Sixth Plea.
Oh! but it is very great, mine affliction it is exceeding great says one, and
how ever you say, we must be contented, it is true, you may say so that feel not
such great afflictions, but if you felt my affliction that I feel you would
think it hard to bear and be content.

To that I answer, Let it be as great an affliction as it will, it ^^ not so
great as thy sin, He has punished thee less than thy sins.

Secondly, It might have bin a great deal more, thou might have bin in Hell:
And it is (as I remember) Bernards speech, (says he) It is an easier matter to
be oppressed than perish. Thou might have been in Hell, and therefore the
greatness of the thing should not make thee murmur, grant it be great.

Thirdly, It may be it is the greater because thy heart does so murmur: for
shackles upon a man's legs, if his legs be sore it will pain him the more, if
the shoulder be sore the burden is the greater; it is because thy heart is so
unsound that thy affliction is great unto thee. And that is the sixth reasoning.

A Seventh Plea.
But howsoever you may lessen my affliction, yet I am sure it is far greater
than the afflictions of others.

First, It may be it is thy discontent that makes it greater, when (indeed) it
is not so in its self.

Secondly, If it were greater than others: why is thy eye evil because the eye
of God is good? why should thou be discontented the more because God is
gracious to others?

Thirdly, Is thy affliction greater than others? then in this thou have an
opportunity to honor God more than others; so thou should consider, Does
God afflict me more than other men? God gives me an opportunity in this to
honor him in this affliction more than other men? to exercise more grace than
other men, let me labor to do it then.

Fourthly, If all afflictions were laid upon a heap together: It is an notable
expression of Solon that wise Heathen (says he,) Suppose all the afflictions
that are in the world were laid upon a heap, and every man should come and take
a proportion of those afflictions, every one equally, there is scarce any man
but would rather say, let me have the afflictions that I had before or else he
were like to come to a greater share, a greater affliction if so be he should
equally share with all the world: Now for you that are poor, (that are not in
extremity of poverty) if all the riches in the world were laid together, and
you should have an equal share, you would be poorer; but take all afflictions
and sorrows whatsoever, if all the sorrows in the world were laid together in a
heap, and you had but an equal share of them, your portion would be rather more
than it is now for the present: And therefore do not complain, that it is more
than others, so as to murmur because of that.

An Eighth Plea.
Another reasoning that murmuring hearts have is this, They think that if the
affliction were any other than it is, then they would be more contented.

First, You must know that we are not to choose our own rod that God shall beat
us with.

Secondly, It may be if it were any other than it is, it were not so fit for
thee as this is, it may be therefore God chooses it because it is the most
cross to thee, as seeing it most suitable for the purging out of that humor
that is in thee. If a patient comes to take physic and finds himself sick by
it, shall he say, Oh! if it were any other potion I could bear it, it may be if
it were any other than it is it would not fit thy disease; yea if it did not
work as it does it would not fit thy disease: so when thou say of an
affliction, if it were any other than it is thou could bear it, do but
answer thy self with this, it may be if it were any other than it is it would
not be fit for me, it would not hit right to that sinful humor that there is
in my soul, and therefore God sees this to be the fittest and the most suitable
for me.

Thirdly, Know that this is the excellency of grace in a Christian to be fitted
for any condition, not only to say, if it were this or that, but if it be any.
As now, a Mariner if he has skill he would not say, if it were any other wind
but this, if the wind did blow in any point but this, I could tell how to
manage my ship, I could show skill in other points but not in this; would not
Mariners laugh at such a one? it would be a shame for him to say that he has
skill in any other points but this: So it should be a shame for a Christian to
say that he has skill in any other affliction but this: a Christian should be
able to manage his ship if the wind blow any way; to guide his soul any way.

The fourth and last answer is this, Know that the Lord has rewards and crowns
for all graces, and for the honoring them in all conditions. It may be in such
a way as thou think thou could honor God, God has a crown for that, and
God has another crown to set upon the heads of those that honor him in such a
way as this is, yea he has several sorts of crowns (as I may so say) in
Heaven, and those crowns he must put upon some bodies head, and therefore he
exercises thee in variety of conditions, that so thou might have the several
rewards and crowns that God has to reward and crown those that are faithful in
several conditions.

A Ninth Plea.
Oh but the condition that God has put me in makes me to be unservicable, and
this troubles me; it is true, if it were only an affliction and trouble to my
self it were not so much, but I am put into such a condition by this affliction
as I am unservicable, and am like to do God no further service, God puts me
into a mean estate, and what good can I do? and how burdensome is my life to me
because I can do no service for God! and this is grievous to me.

Indeed if it he true that this is thy great grief, it is a good sign, If thou
can say as in the presence of God, above all afflictions here in this world
to be laid aside and not to be employed in the service of God, I account that
the greatest Affliction: I had rather bear any trouble in the world so I might
do more service, then to be freed from trouble and to be laid aside and do
little service: Can thou say so? It is a good sign of grace for a man to
account afflictions to be great because he can do the Lord but little service.
Few men account that no affliction at all.

But yet there may be a temptation in this. To murmur at Gods dispose when your
calling is low and mean and you can do little service, this is many times a
temptation to those that are poor, those that are servants and those that are
of weak parts and are fain to work hard to provide bread for their families,
it is many times a grievous burden to them to think, such men the Lord uses in
public service, and I live in an obscure way, and to what purpose is my life?

First, To help against this temptation that thou may not murmur against
this condition, Do but consider though thy condition be low and mean, yet thou
art in the Body, thou art a member of the Body though thou be but a mean
member, the toe and the finger has it is use in the body, though it be not the
eye, though it be not the head, or the heart yet it has it is use in the body.
And it is an excellent expression that I remember Austin has about this,
(says he) It is better to be the meanest member in the Body, than to be the
highest member and more excellent and cut off from the Body, it is better to be
a little sprig in the tree joined to the Root, than to be an arm cut off from
the Root. Now other men that have but common gifts in the world, that are not
members of Jesus Christ, (indeed) they seem to have more excellency than those
that are godly, that are in a mean condition, mean parts, mean callings, but
they are not of the Body, they are not joined to the Root, and therefore their
condition is worse. As a great arm of a tree when it is cut off it has a
great many leaves upon it, and it seems a great deal more glorious than those
little sprigs that are upon the tree, but that little sprig is in a better
condition, why? Because joined to the tree and has sap from the Root and
flourishes, but the other will wither and die within a while: So it is with
the men of the world, they be but like great boughs cut off from the tree,
though they have excellent parts, and have great estates and pomp and glory in
the world, they have no union with Jesus Christ the Root: But now others that
live in a poor condition, a poor tradesman, a poor servant, a poor
labouring-man that labors for his family everyday, yet he being godly, (says
he) though I have but little for the present, little glory, little credit,
little comfort yet I am joined to the Body, and there I have supply and that
that will feed me with comfort, blessing, and mercy to all eternity: So all
that are in a poor condition in this world if they be godly, do but think of
that; though thou be mean yet thou art in the Body, and joined to the Root,
thou art joined to the principal of comfort, good, blessing, and mercy that
will hold out to eternity, when thousand thousands of glorious pompious men in
the world shall wither and perish everlastingly, and therefore be not troubled
at thy mean condition.

Secondly, Though thou have but a mean calling in this world, and so art not
regarded as a man of use in the world, yet if thou be a Christian God has
called thee to a higher calling, thy general calling it is a high calling,
though thy particular calling be but low and mean: And for that you have a
place in the Chapter before my text, Phil. 3.14. I press toward the mark
(says the Apostle) for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus:
So that every Christian has a high calling of God in Christ Jesus, God has
called him to the highest thing that he has called any creature to that he
has made, the Angels in Heaven have not a higher calling than thou have. Thou
that perhaps spendest thy time in a poor business, in the meanest calling, if
thou be a dung-raker, to rake channels, or cleanse places of filth or any
other thing in the world that is the meanest that can be conceived of, thy
general calling as a Christian does advance thee higher than any particular
calling can advance any man in the world; others indeed that are called to
manage the Affairs of the State, they are in a high calling, or Ministers they
are in a high calling, but thine in some respect is higher. A poor servant that
must be scraping all day about poor mean things, many times may have such a
temptation as this is, Oh what a poor condition has God disposed me to! will
God have regard to such a one that is in such a poor low place as I am? Oh yes,
Christ has regard to the meanest member, as a man has as true regard to the
toe if it be in pain, and will tender that as truly and verily as any other
member; so Christ has regard to his lowest and meanest ones.

Thirdly, thou art in a high calling though thy outward calling be low in
respect of men, yet in respect of God thou art in the same calling with the
Angels in Heaven, and in some degree called to that that is higher, for the
Scripture says, that the Angels come to understand the mystery of the Gospel
by the Church; thou that art a Christian in that general calling of thine, thou
art joined with Principalities and Powers, and with Angels, in the greatest
work that God has called any creature to, and therefore let that comfort thee
in this.

Fourthly, Thy calling is low and mean, yet be not discontented with that, for
thou have a principle within thee (if thou be a godly man or woman) of Grace
that does raise thy lowest actions to be higher in Gods esteem, than all the
brave glorious actions that are done in the world; the principle of faith does
it, for any man or woman to go on in obedience to God in a way of faith in the
calling that God has set them, (I say doing this through a principle of faith)
it does raise this action, and makes it a more glorious action than all the
glorious victories of Alexander and Caesar, than all their Triumphs and
glorious pomp that they had in all their conquests; it was not so glorious as
for thee to do the lowest action out of faith. For, as Luther speaks of a poor
Milk-maid, and yet being a Believer, and does it in faith, he compares that
action to all the glorious actions of Caesar, and makes that a great deal more
eminent and glorious in the eyes of God, therefore faith raises thy works that
are but mean, raises them to be very glorious.

Yea, and the truth is, there is more obedience to submit to God in a low
calling, than to submit to him in a higher calling, for it is clear obedience,
mere obedience that makes thee go on in a low calling, but there may be much
self-love that makes men go on in a higher calling, for there is riches, credit
and account in the world, and rewards comes in by that, which does not in the
other, to go on quietly in a low calling is more obedience to God.

Fifthly, Know further in the last place, there is like to be more reward: For
the Lord when he comes to reward, he does not come to examine what the work
has been that men and women have been exercised in, but what their
faithfulness has been, Well done good and faithful servant says the Lord, he
does not say, well done good servant for thou have bin faithful to me in public
works, ruling Cities and States, and Affairs in Kingdoms, and therefore thou
shall be rewarded, no, but Well done good and faithful servant; now thou may
be faithful in little as well as others are in more, by going on and working
thy days labor, when thou gettest but a couple of shillings to maintain thy
family, thou may be as faithful in this as those are that rules a Kingdom;
now God looks to a man's faithfulness, and thou may have as great a reward
for thy faithfulness that art a poor servant in the Kitchen all the day, as
another that sits upon the Throne all day, and as great a Crown of glory thou
may have at the day of judgment, as a King that sits upon the Throne, that
has ruled for God upon his Throne; yea, thy faithfulness may be rewarded by
God with as great glory, as a King that has swaid his Scepter for God; because
I say the Lord does not so much look at the work that is done, as at the
faithfulness of our hearts in doing it, then why should not every one of us go
on comfortably and cheerfully in our low condition, for why may not I be
faithful as well as another? it is true, I cannot come to be as rich a man and
as honorable as others; but I may be as faithful as any other man, that every
one of you may conclude with your selves: what does let but that you that are
the poorest and meanest may be as faithful as the greatest, yea you may have as
glorious a crown in Heaven, and therefore go on comfortably and cheerfully in
your way.

A Tenth Plea.
There Is another reasoning that some may have and that is this. Oh I could bear
much affliction in some other way but this is very grievous to me, the
unsetledness of my condition, though my condition were but low yet if it were
in a settled way I could be content, but it is so unconstant, and so unsettled,
that I can never know what to trust to, but am tossed up and down in the world in
an unsettled condition, and this is hard to be content with.

Now to that I answer, First, that the Psalmist says, That every man in his
settled estate is vanity, in Psalm, 36.5. your books have it, Every man at his
best estate is vanity, the word is his settled estate; you think if you were but
settled, Oh then you could be content, but the truth is, man in his settled
estate is vanity.

Secondly, I answer thus, that perhaps God sees it is better for thee to live
in a continual dependence upon him, and not to know what thy condition shall be
one the morrow, then for thee to have a more settled condition in respect of the
comforts of the creature; do but remember that we spoke of before, that Christ
does not teach you to pray, Lord, give me enough that will serve me for two or
three years, but, this day our daily bread; to teach us we must live upon God
in a dependent condition every day for daily bread. Here was the difference
that is observable between the Land of Canaan and Egypt, the land of Canaan
that depended upon God for the watering of it with showers from Heaven, but
Egypt had a constant way of watering the country, that did not so much depend
upon Heaven for water, but upon the river Nylus, which did at some certain time
overflow the country: and they knowing that the watering of their country did
depend upon that river and not upon Heaven they grew more proud: And therefore
the Scripture, to express Pharoah's pride, brings him in saying, The River is
mine: he could order the river as he pleased, for it was his: Canaan, which was
a country which was to depend upon God, though they had rain at one time, yet
they knew not whether they should have it at another time, and lived always in
a dependence upon God not knowing what should become of them: Now God thought
this to be a better land for his people than Egypt, and this is given as one
reason among others for it, because the Lord looked upon this, as more suitable
to the state of his people that were to live by faith, to be continually
depending upon Heaven, upon Himself, and not to have a constant settled way in
the creature for their outward dependence: and we find it by experience, that
when those that are godly live in the greatest dependence upon God, and have no
settled comings-in from the creature, they do exercise faith more, and are in a
better condition for their souls than before. Oh! many times it falls out that
the worse thy outward estate is the better thy soul is, and the better thy
outward estate is the worse thy soul is. We read in Ezra, 4.13. the objection
that the enemies had against the people of Isreal's building of the wall of the
City: their writing to Artaxerxes against them, says, Be it known unto the
King, that if the City be builded, and the walls set up again, then they will not
pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shall endamage the revenue of the
Kings. If the wall be built (say thy) then they will refuse to pay toll,
tribute and custom to the King: that is thus, so long as they live in such a
condition, where they have dependence wholly upon the King, and lie at the
Kings mercy, that is, they are in no City that has walls built, but the King
may come upon them when he will, so long they will pay custom to the King, but
if once they come to build a wall, and can defend themselves, and have not
their dependence upon the King as before, then they will deny paying toll,
tribute, and custom. So it is thus for all the world between God and men's
souls, when a soul lives in way of mere dependence upon God, that sensibly he
sees God has him at advantage every moment, Oh then such a soul will pay toll
and custom, that soul exercises faith, and begs every day his daily bread; but
if God hedges that man about with an estate, with prosperity, perhaps he has
an inheritance befallen him, perhaps he has a constant office that brings in
so much yearly to him duly paid, this man is not so sensible now of his
dependence upon God, he begins now to pay less toll and custom to God than
before, God has less service from this man now than before. God sees it
better for his people to live in a depending condition: we are very loath in
respect of God to be dependant, we would be all independants this way, we would
be of our selves, and have no dependence upon the Lord, but God sees it better
for us to live in a depending condition.

Further, This may be thy comfort, though for outward things thou art mightily
unsettled, yet for the great things of thy soul and eternal estate, there thou
art settled, there thou have a settled way, a constant way of fetching supply, Of
his fullness we receive grace for grace, thou have there abundance of treasure
to go to, and fetch all that thou stand in need of; and observe it, that now
thy condition is more settled in the covenant of grace than it was in the
covenant of works; in the covenant of works there God gave man a stock to trade
with, but he put it in his own hand, so that he might trade, and get or lose;
but now in the Covenant of grace God makes sure, the stock is kept in the hand
of Christ, and we must go to him for supply continually, for Christ keeps the
stock; perhaps we may trifle away somewhat in our trading, but God takes that
care still we stall never spend the stock: As a man when his Son breaks, having
squandered away his stock that he gave him before, afterward he puts his stock
into a friends hand, and says he, you shall keep the stock and it shall not be
at his dispose; so we are in a more settled condition in respect of our eternal
estate then Adam was in innocence; therefore let that comfort us in all our
unsettled conditions in the matters of the world.

A Eleventh Plea.
But yet there is another reasoning that many murmuring hearts think to feed
their humor withal, (say they) If I never had bin in a better condition then I
could bear this affliction, if God had always kept me in so low a condition I
could be content, Oh but there was a time that I prospered more, and I had
things at more full hand, and therefore now it is harder to me to be brought
low; as in these times, perhaps a man that had five or six hundred a year, but
now has had nothing for a great while, if that man had not bin born to so
much, or never had prospered in any higher degree than now he is in, this
affliction had bin less, perhaps he has some money and friends to live upon,
but if he had never bin in a better condition he would not have accounted it so
great a matter to have been without it now. This many times is our greatest
wound, that once we were in a better condition; and this is the most
unreasonable thing for us to murmur upon this ground of any.

For first, Is thy eye evil because God has been good to thee heretofore? It Is
an ill thing for us to have our eye evil because God is good to others, but to
look upon our condition with an evil eye now, because God was once good to us;
has God done thee any wrong because he was formerly more good to thee than he
was to others?

Secondly, Thou did heretofore more prosper, did God heretofore give thee
more prosperity? it was to prepare thee for afflictions, we should look at all
our outward prosperity as a preparation to afflictions, if thou had done so
then it would not have bin so difficult for thee to have endured affliction
now; when thou had a great estate, yet if thou had made use of this mercy
of God to prepare thee for thy afflicted estate, then the change of thy estate
would not be so grievous. That every Christian should do: have I an estate now?
I should prepare for poverty, have I health now? I should prepare for sickness,
have I liberty? let me prepare my self for imprisonment? what know I what God
may call me to? have I comfort and peace now in my conscience, does God shine
upon me? while I have this let me prepare for Gods withdrawing from me: am I
delivered from temptations? let me prepare now for the time of temptations; If
thou would do so, the change of thy condition would not be so grievous to
thee: Mariners that are in a calm will prepare for storms, would they say, if
we never had calms we would bear storms? but now we have had calms so many
years or weeks together, this is grievous: In thy calm thou art to prepare for
storms, and the storm would be less, thou should reason quite contrary and
say, Now I am in an afflicted condition, Oh but blessed be God I was in a
comfortable condition, and blessed be God that he was a forehand with me in the
ways of his mercy, this one consideration may help murmuring hearts. Do thou
murmur because once thou were better? know God was beforehand with thee in the
ways of mercy, thou should rather think thus, I have lived for these many
years (forty years perhaps or more) in a comfortable condition, I have lived in
health, and peace, and plenty, what though the remaining part of my time have
some sorrow and affliction? The Lord has granted to me a comfortable sunshine
all the day long till toward evening, and what if at seven or eight a clock at
night it begins to rain? let me thank God I have had so fair weather all day.
You that are going a voyage, if you have a comfortable wind, and very fair for
many months together, what if you have a little storm when you are within sight
of land, will you murmur and repine? Oh no, but rather bless God that you have
had such a comfortable voyage so long: Oh this consideration would help us all;
If it were so that now God should say, well, you shall never see comfortable
day more for outward things in this world, Oh then you have cause to fall down
and bless Gods Name that you have had so many comfortable days: Now you
reason quite contrary, whereas you should bless God that you have had so much
comfort, you make what you have had before to be an aggravation of your
afflictions now, and so murmur and are discontented. That which God gave you
before, upon what terms did you hold it? did you hold it so as you have in your
writings, To have and to hold for ever, God gives no such thing, God gives to
no man (I say) any thing but grace to run upon that tenor, there is no such
thing in all Gods writings for any outward comforts, To have and to hold for
you and your heirs; indeed for grace he does give it to your selves, to have
and to hold for ever, though not for every one that comes out of your loins to
have and to hold for ever; God does not give any outward thing so upon no such
tenor as that is; if God gives me an understanding of himself, and faith, and
humility, and love, and patience, and such graces of his Spirit he gives them
me for ever, If he gives me Himself and his Christ, and his promise, and his
Covenant, he gives me them for ever, what am I therefore that the Sun should
always shine upon me, that I must have fair weather all my days? that which
God gives to me he gave it to me as a pledge of his love, let me return it to
him as a pledge of my obedience, there is all the reason in the world for it,
all that a godly man receives from God he receives it as a pledge of Gods love
to him, therefore when he comes into an afflicted condition, says God, Return
to me as a pledge for your obedience that that you had from me as a pledge of
my love; we should cheerfully come in to God and bless God that we have any
thing to render unto him as a pledge of our obedience, and say, Oh it is thy
love O Lord that has given us any thing, that does enable us to render a
pledge of our obedience to thee. When God calls for thy estate or any comforts
that thou have, God calls for it as a pledge of thy obedience to him.

A Twelfth Plea.
Another reasoning of a murmuring heart is this. Oh but after I have taken a
great deal of pains for such a comfort, yet then I am crossed in it, after a
great deal of labor and pains that I have taken now to be crossed, Oh this goes
very hard.

First I answer, The greater cross, the more obedience and submission.

Secondly, When thou did take a great deal of pains, was it not with
submission to God? Did thou take pains with resolution, that thou must have
such a thing when thou labourest for it? Then know that thou labourest not as a
Christian, but if thou did labor and take pains, was it not with
resignation to God, Lord I am taking pains in the way of my calling, but with
submission, I depend wholly upon thee for success and a blessing; And what was
it that thou did aim at in thy labor? was it not that thou might walk
with God in the place that God had set thee? A Christian should do so in his
outward calling, I am diligent in my outward calling, but it is, that I might
obey God in it; it is true, I do it that I might provide for my family, but the
chief thing that I aim at is, That I might yield obedience to God in the way
that God has set me: Now if God calls thee to another condition to obey him in
though it be by suffering, thou will do it if thy heart be right.

Thirdly, There will be the more testimony of thy love to God, if so be thou
shall now yield up thy self to God in that that cost thee dear, shall I offer
that to God (says David) that cost me nothing? thy outward comforts has cost
thee much, and thou have taken much pains to obtain them, and now if thou can
submit to God in the want of them, (I say) in this thy love is more shown that
thou can offer that to God that cost thee dear. Now these are the principal
reasonings of a discontented heart.

A Thirteenth Plea.
There Is one Plea more that may be named, and that is this, says some, Though
I confess my affliction is somewhat hard, and I feel some trouble within me, yet
I thank God I break not out in discontented ways to the dishonor of God, I
keep in although I have much ado with my own heart.

Oh! do not satisfy your selves with that, for the distempers of your hearts,
and their sinful workings are as words before God. My soul be silent to God:
That we spoke of in the beginning of the opening of this Scripture, it is not
enough for thy tongue to be silent; but thy soul must be silent, there may be a
sullen discontentednesse of heart as well as a discontentednesse manifested in
words: And if thou do not mortify that inward sullenness, if thou be
afflicted a little more it will break forth at last.

And thus the Lord I hope has met with the chief reasonings and Pleas for our
discontent in our conditions, I beseech you in the Name of God consider these
things, and because they do concern your own hearts, you may so much the better
remember them. I had thought to have made a little entrance into the next
head, and that is some way of helping you to this grace of Contentment. It is a
most excellent grace, of admirable use as you have heard, and the contrary is
very sinful and vile.

SERMON XI.
PHILIPPIANS. 4.11. For I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content.


Oct. 12. 1645.
NOW we are coming to the close of this point of Contentment that Jesus Christ
does teach those that are in his School: we have opened the point unto you, and
showed you wherein the Art, and Skill, and Mystery of Christian Contentment
lies; and diverse things in the way of application rebuking the want of this and
the last day I finished that point of showing the several Reasonings of a
murmuring and discontented heart. I shall now (as being desirous to make an
end) leave what was said, and proceed to what remains. There are only these two
things for the working of your hearts to this grace of Christian Contentment.

First, The propounding of several Considerations for the contenting of the
heart in any afflicted condition.

Secondly, The propounding of Directions what should be done for the working of
our hearts unto this,

The First Consideration.
We should consider (in all our wants and inclinations to discontent) The
greatness of the mercies that we have, and the meanness of the things that we
want. The things we want, (if we be godly) they are things of very small moment
in comparison to the things we have, and the things we have are things of very
great moment; for the most part that that people are discontent and murmur for
the want of, it is because they have not such things as reprobates have, or may
have; why should thou be troubled so much for the want of that that a man or
woman may have and yet be a reprobate, as that thy estate is not so great, thy
health not so perfect, thy credit not so much, thou may have all those
things and yet be a reprobate; now will thou be discontent for that that a
reprobate may have? I shall give you the example of a couple of godly men
meeting together, Anthony and Diddimus, Diddimus was blind, and yet a man of
very excellent parts and graces, Anthony asked him if he was not troubled at
this his want of sight, he confessed he was, but (says he) shall you be troubled
at the want of what flies and dogs have, and not rather rejoice and be thankful
that you have what Angels have? God has given you those good things that makes
Angels glorious, is not that enough to you, though you want what thing a fly
has? And so a Christian should reason the case with himself, what am I
discontented for? I am discontented for want of that that a dog may have, that
a Devil may have, that a reprobate may have, shall I be discontent for not
having that, when as God has given me that that makes Angels glorious? Blessed
be God (says the Apostle in Ephe. 1.3.) that has blessed us with all
Spiritual blessings in heavenly places. It may be thou have not so great
blessings in earthly places as some others have, but if the Lord has blessed
thee in heavenly places that should content thee, there is blessings in heaven,
and he has set thee here for the present as it were in heaven, in a heavenly
place, the consideration of the greatness of the mercies that we have, and the
littleness of the things that God has denied us, is a very powerful
consideration to work this grace of Contentment.

The Second Consideration.
The consideration that God is beforehand with us with his mercies should
content us (I spoke to this as an aggravation of our discontent, but now I
shall use it as a consideration to help us to Contentment) Thou want many
comforts now, but has not God bin beforehand with thee heretofore? Oh thou
have had mercy enough already to make thee spend all the strength thou have and
time thou shall live, to bless God for what thou have had already. I remember I
have read of a good man that had lived to fifty years of age and enjoyed his
health for eight and forty years exceeding well, and lived in prosperity, and
the two last years his body was exceedingly diseased, he had the strangury, and
was in great pain; but he reasoned the case with himself thus; Oh Lord thou
might have made all my life to have been a life of torment and pain, but
thou have let me have eight and forty years in health, I will praise thy mercies
for what I have had, and will praise thy justice for what now I feel. Oh it is a
good consideration for us to think that God is beforehand with us in the way of
mercy: Suppose God should now take away your estates from some of you that have
lived comfortably a great while, you will say, That aggravates our misery that
we have had estates; but it is through thy unthankfulness that it does so; we
should bless God for what we have had, and not think that we are worse because
we have had thus and thus, we might have been always miserable, and certainly
that man's condition is not very miserable that has no other great aggravation
of his misery but because once he was happy; If there be nothing else to make
you miserable, that is no such agravation but that thou may bear it, for
there is much mercy in that that thou had once, and therefore let that
content thee.

A Third Consideration.
The consideration of the abundance of mercies that God bestows and we enjoy.
It is a speech of Luther (says he) the Sea of Gods mercies should swallow up
all our particular afflictions, name any affliction that is upon thee, there is
a Sea of mercy to swallow it up. If you power a pail full of water on the flour
of your house it makes a great show, but if you throw it into the Sea there is
no appearance of it; so afflictions considered in themselves we think they are
very great, but let them be considered with the Sea of Gods mercies we do
enjoy, then they are not so much, they are nothing in comparison.

A Fourth Consideration.
Consider the way of God toward all creatures, God carries on all creatures in
a visicitude of several conditions; as thus, we have not always summer, but
winter succeeds summer, we have not always day, but day and night, we have not
always fair weather, but fair and foul, the vegitive creatures do not always
flourish, but the sap is in the root and they seem as if they were dead,
there is a visicitude of all things in the world, the Sun does not shine always
to us here, but there is darkness comes after light, now seeing God has so
ordered things with all creatures that there is a mixture of conditions; why
should we think it much that there should be a visicitude of conditions with
us, sometimes in a way of prosperity, and sometimes in a way of affliction.

A Fifth Consideration.
A further consiadertion is this, The creatures do suffer for us, why should
not we be willing to suffer, to be servicable to God? God subjects other
creatures, they are fain to lose their lives for us, to lose what ever beauty
and excellency they have to be serviceable to to us, why should not we be
willing to part with any thing in way of service for God; certainly there is
not so great a distance between other creatures and Mankind, as there is
between Mankind and God. It Is an expression of that Martyr Master Hooper, that
we read of in the Book of Martyrs, in laboring to work his own heart, and the
hearts of others to contentedness in the midst of his sufferings; he has this
similitude, and you may be put in mind of that every day, (says he) I look
upon the creature, and see what it suffers to be useful to me; as thus, The
bruit beasts must die, must be roast in the fire, and boiled, must come upon the
trencher, be hackt all in pieces, must be chewed in the mouth, and in the
stomach turned to that which is loathsome if one should behold it, and all to
nourish me, to be useful to my body; and shall not I be willing to be made any
thing for God, for his service? what abundance of alterations the creature
comes under to be made useful for me, to preserve me: then if God will do so
with me for his use, as he does subject the creatures to me for my use, why
should not I rest contented? If God will take away my estate, and make me poor,
if God will take away my life, hack me in pieces, put me in prison, whatsoever
he does, yet I shall not suffer more for God than the creature does for me, and
surely I am infinitely more bound to God than the creature is to me, and there
is not so much difference between me and the creature as between me and God:
such considerations as these wrought the heart of that Martyr to contentedness
in his sufferings; and every time the creature is upon your trenchers you may
think, What! does God make the creature suffer for my use? not only for my
nourishment, but for my delight; what am I then in respect of the infinite God?

A Sixth Consideration.
Another Consideration for the working of Contenement, it is, To consider that
we have but a little be time in this world: If thou be godly thou shall
never suffer but only in this world; why do but shut your eyes and presently
another life is come: as that Martyr said to his fellow Martyr, Do but shut
your eyes, (says he) and the next time they are opened you shall be in another
world. Athanasius says, it is but a little cloud (when he was banished) and it
will be over (notwithstanding) presently. These Afflictions they are but for a
moment? a Mariner when he is abroad does not think it much if a storm arises,
especially if he can see the Heavens clear beyond it says he, it will be over
presently: Consider we have not long to live, it may be it may be over before
our days be at an end, but suppose it should not, death will put an end to
all, all Afflictions and troubles will soon be at an end by death.

A Seventh Consideration is this.
Consider the condition that others have been in that have bin our betters. We
made some use of that before to show the evil of coffeehouse: But further
for to work this upon our hearts, it is a mighty Argument to work upon our
hearts a contentedness in any condition.

Thou many times do consider who are above thee, but consider who are under
thee.

Jacob that was the heir both of Abraham and Isaac, (for the blessing was upon
him) and the Promise ran along in him, yet was in a poor mean condition.
Abraham that was his Grandfather was able to make a kind of Army of his own
household, 300. to fight with a King, yet Jacob his Grandchild he goes over
Jordan with a staff, and lives in a very poor and mean condition for a long
time: and Moses that might have had all the treasures in Egypt, and as some
Historians say of him Pharoahs Daughter adopted him for her son, because
Pharaoh had no heir for the Crown, and so he was like to have come to the
Crown, yet what a low condition did he live in when he went to live with Jethro
his Father in law 400. years together, afterward when he returned to Egypt, he
and his wife and children, and all that he had, and yet he had but one beast to
carry him to Egypt, he went in a mean condition when he went from his Father in
law to Egypt back again.

And Elijah we know how he was fed with Ravens, and how he was fain to shift
for his life from time to time, and run into the wilderness up and down, and
so did Elisha, he was diverse times in a very low condition, the Prophets of God
they were to be hid in a Cave by Obadiah, and there to be fed with bread and
water, and the Prophet Jeremiah put into a Dungeon, and oh how was he used! and
it were an endless thing to name the particulars of the great sufferings of the
people of God. In former time we have sometimes made use of this Argument other
ways, the great Instruments of God in the first Reformation they lived in
great straights, in a very low condition, even Luther himself when he was to
die (says he) Lord (though he were a man of such public use, and was a great
man in the Courts of Princes) Lord I have neither house nor lands, nor estate
to leave any thing to wife or children, but I commit them to thee: and so
Musculus that was a very choice Instrument of God in his time, though he were a
man that was worth even a Kingdom for the excellency of his spirit, and
learning, for he was one of the learned men of his time, yet sometimes he was
put to dig in the common ditch to get bread for his family; what would we do if
we were in such a condition as these men were? But above all set Christ before
us, that professes that the birds of the air had nests, and the Foxes had
holes, yet the Son of man had no place to hide his head in, that low condition
he was in; the consideration of such things as these are very useful. It is
likewise useful for men and women of estates to go to poor peoples houses and
see how they live, to go to Hospitals, and to see the wounds of soldiers and
others, and to see the lamentable condition that people live in that live in
some Almshouses, and what poor fare they have, and what straights they are put
to, you hear sometimes of them, but if you went to see them it would not only
stir up charity in your selves toward them, but stir up thankfulness in your
hearts toward God, it would be a special means to help you against any
discontent, you would go away and see cause to bless God and say, if I were in
such a condition as they are in what should I do? how could I bear it? and yet
what reason is there that God does so order and dispose of things that they
should be so low in their estates and I so high: I know no reason but free
grace, God will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy: These are some good
considerations for the furtherance of Contentment.

The Eighth Consideration.
A further consideration may be this, That before your conversion, before God
wrought upon your souls, you were contented then with the world without grace,
though you had no interest in God nor Christ, why cannot you now be contented
with grace and Spiritual things without the world? If you your selves were
content with the world without grace, there is reason you should be content with
grace without the world? Certainly there is infinitely more reason. Yea, you see
that many men of the world have a kind of contentment, do not murmur nor repine
when the world comes though they have no interest in God and Christ. Then
can not thou have as much Contentment with God and Christ without the world,
as they can with the world without God and Christ? This is infinite shame it
should be so.

The Ninth Consideration.
Yea consider when God has given thee such contentment, thou have not given
him the glory. When God has let thee have thy hearts desire, what have thou
done with thy hearts desire? thou have not bin the better for it, it may be
thou have bin the worse many times and therefore let that satisfy thee: I meet
with crosses, but when I had contentment and all things coming in, God had but
little or no glory from me, and therefore let that be a means now to quiet me
in my discontented thoughts.

The Tenth Consideration.
Yea lastly, Consider all the experience that you have had of Gods doing good
unto you in the want of many comforts. When God crosses you, have you never had
experience of abundance of good in afflictions, it is true, when a Minister only
tells men that God will work good out of their afflictions, they hear them
speak, and think they speak like good men, but they feel little or no good,
they feel nothing but pain; but when we cannot only say to you that God has
said he will work good out of your afflictions, but we can say to you, that you
your selves have found it so by experience, that God has made former
afflictions to be great benefits to you, and that you would not have been
without them, or without the good that came by them for a world; such
experiences will exceedingly quiet the heart and work it to contentment:
therefore think thus with thy self, Lord, why may not this affliction work as
great a good upon me as afflictions have done heretofore? Perhaps you may find
many other considerations besides in your own meditations, these are the
principal ones that I have thought upon: I Will one add one word more to this, of
one that once was a great merchant and tradesman, and it happened one a time
that he suffered ship-rack, and says he, I never made a better voyage and
sailed better than at that time that I suffered ship-rack: this was a strangs
speech (his name war Zeno) that he should never make a better voyage: it would
be a strange parradox to you that are mariners, to say, that that's a good
voyage when you suffer ship-rack: but he meant because he got so much good by
it, God was pleased to bless it so far to him that he gained so much unto his
soul by it, so much soul-riches that he made account it was the best voyage
that ever he had: and truly, sometimes it is so, yea, to you that are godly I
make no question but you find it so, that your worst voyages have proved your
best, when you have met with the greatest crosses in a voyage, God has been
pleased to turn them to a greater good to you in some other way. It is true, we
may not desire crosses that they may be turned to other advantages; but when
God in his providence does so order things, that you meet with ill voyages, you
may expect that God will turn them to a greater good, and those that have been
exercised in the ways of godliness any long time, I make no question but they
have abundance of experiences that they have gained by them: You know sometimes
it is better to be in a little ship, for they have advantage of greater ones in
storms many times, in a storm a little ship can thrust into a shallow place and
so be safe, but your great ships cannot, they must be abroad and tossed up and
down in the storm and tempest, and so many times split against the rocks. And
so it may be God sees there is a storm a coming, and if thou be in thy
great ship thou may be split upon rocks and sands, God therefore does put
thee into a lesser vessel that thou may be more safe. We will lay aside the
speaking of those considerations now, but I would not have you lay them aside
and put them out of your thoughts, but labor (those especially that most
concern you) to make use of them in the needful time, when you find any
discontentednesse of spirit to arise in you.

But the main thing that I intended for this exercise, It is propounding
directions what to do for the helping of our hearts to Contentment. For as for
any further considerations we have prevented the speaking largly of them,
because we have opened the most things in showing what the lessons are that
Christ teaches men, when he brings them into his School, to teach them this
Art. I say there we have spoken of the special things that are most
considerable for the helping of us to this grace of Contentment. Therefore now
all that I shall further do about this point, shall be the giving of some
directions what course to take that we may come to attain this grace of
Contentment.

The First Direction.
The first is this, All the rules and helps in the world will do us little good
except we get a good temper within in our hearts; you can never make a ship go
steady with propping of it without, you know there must be ballast within the
ship, that must make it go steady: And so there is nothing without us that can
keep our hearts in a steady constant way but that that is within us, grace is
within the soul and that will do it.

The Second Direction.
Secondly, If you would get a contented life, do not gripe too much of the
world, do not take in more of the business of the world than God calls you to,
be not greedy of taking in a great deal of the world, for if a man will go
among thorns when he may go in a plainer way, there is no reason that this man
should complain that he is pricked with them; thou go among thorns, is it thy
way? must you of necessity go among them? then it is another matter, but if thou will electively choose that way when thou may go another, then thou have no
cause to complain; so for men and women that will put themselves upon things of
the world that they need not, then no mervail though they be pricked, and meet
with that that does disquiet them? for such is the nature of all things here in
the world, that every thing has some prick or other in it, we are like to meet
with disappointments, and discontentments in every thing we meddle with, and
therefore those that have least to do in the world, (that is, except God calls
them to it, we must put in that) they are like to meet with many things that
will discontent tehm.

The Third Direction.
Thirdly, Be sure of thy call to every business thou go about, though it be
in the lea^t business be sure of thy call to it: then whatever thou meetest
withal thou may quiet thy heart with this, I know I am where God would have
me, there is nothing in the world will quiet the heart so much as this; when I
meet with any cross, I know I am where God would have me in my place and
calling, I am about the work that God has set me, Oh this will quiet and
content thee when thou meetest with trouble: that that God calls a man to with
that he may have comfort in whatsoever befalls him, God is to look to thee, and
to see thee blessed if thou be in the work God calls thee to.

The Fourth Direction.
And especially if I add a fourth rule, and that is. That I walk by rule in
that work I am called to. I am called to such a business, but I must manage
this work that I am called to by rule, I must walk by the word, order my self
in this business according to Gods mind so far as I am able, then add this to
the other, and then the quiet and peace of that soul may be made even perfect
in a kind, when I know it is not the work I put my self upon but God has
called me to it, and I walk by the rule of the word in it, then let come what
will come God he is to take care of me there. It was a spech of a Heathen
(says he) if thou will subject all things to thy self, do thou subject thy
self to reason, and by that thou will make all things to be under thee; I may
add a little more to it, if you will subject all things under you, subject
your self to God, and then the truth is all things are under you; It has been
that that many times we have hinted, the reason why many of our Gentry have
been so malignant among us is, because they are willing to be slaves themselves
under some above them at Court, so they may keep their neighbors under to be
slaves to them: for you know anyman heretofore that was great at the Court, he
could crush any country man that he was angry withal. If there were an
Arbitrary-government, then all those that would be willing to be vassals and
slaves to the Prince, they can make all others vassals and slaves to them. Now
be thou willing to be a vassal to God, to be absolutely under Gods command, and
then I say all things in the world are under thee, All are yours (says the
Apostle) Life and death, every thing is yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ
is Gods: All things in the world are servicable to that man or woman that is
servicable to God. It is a mighty commendations of Gods service, be thou
willing to be servicable to God and God makes all things in the world to be thy
servants, for so they are. You will say, how are they my servants, I cannot
command them? They are servants in this, that God does order them all to work
for thy good, there is nothing in the world but (says God) it shall work for
thy good, and be servicable to thee, if thou will be servicable to me; who
would not be now Gods servant? Subject thy self to God, and all things shall be
subjected to thee. Now so long as we keep within our bounds we are under
protection, but if once we break our bounds we must expect it should be with us
as it is with the deer in the Park; while the deer keeps within the pale, there
is no dogs come upon them, but they can feed quietly, but let the deer be got
without the pale, and then every dog in the country will be hunting after them;
so it is with men, let men and women keep within the bounds of the command of
God, of the rule that God has set them in his word, and then they are
protected by God, and they may go about their business with peace and never be
troubled for any thing, but cast all their care upon God, God provides for
them, but if they will go beyond the pale, if they will pass their bounds then
they may expect to meet with troubles, and afflictions, and discontent; and
therefore that is a fourth direction. Walk by rule.

The Fifth Direction.
A fifth rule is this, Exercise much faith, that is the way for contentedness.
After thou have done with all considerations that reason may suggest to thee,
if thou find that these do not do it, Oh then call for grace of faith, a man
may go very far with the use of reason alone to help him to contentment, but
when reason is at a nonplus then set faith a work. It was a speech of the
reverend Divine master Perkins that God made so instrumental in his time, the
life of faith (says he) it is a true life indeed, the only life. Exercise
faith not only in that promise that all shall work together for good to them
that fear God, but likewise exercise faith in God himself, as well as in his
word, in the Attributes of God. It was a speech of Socrates a Heathen, (says
he) since God is so careful for you, what need you be careful for any thing
your selves? It was a strange speech of a Heathen.

Oh Christian! if thou have any faith, in the time of extremity think thus,
this is the time that God calls for the exercise of faith, what can thou do
with thy faith if thou can not quiet thy heart in discontent. It was the
speech of one Theodosius that had been a King, and afterward was brought to
such a low condition to get his living by being a Schoolmaster, one comes and
asks him, What have you got by your Philosophy from Plato and others? what have
I got (says he) I have got this, that though my condition be changed from so
high a condition to so low, yet I have got this, I can be content. So what
do thou get by being a Believer, a Christian? what can thou do by thy
faith? I can do this, I can in all estates cast my care upon God, cast my
burden upon God, I can commit my way to God in peace, faith can do this.
Therefore when reason can go no higher, let faith get upon the shoulders of
reason and say, I see land though reason cannot see it, I see good that will
come out of all this evil.

Exercise faith in thy often resignation of thy self to God, in giving of thy
self up to God and his ways, the more thou do in a believing way surrender
up thy self to God, the more quiet and peace will thou have; that is the fifth
thing.

The Sixth Direction.
The sixth Direction for Contentment is, To labor to be spiritually minded;
that is, be often in meditation of the things that are above, Col. 3.1.
If we be risen with Christ (says the Scriptures) let us seek the things that
are above, where Christ is that sits at the right hand of God. Be much in
spiritual thoughts, in conversing with things above; many Christians that have
an interest in the things of Heaven yet converse but very little with them,
their meditations are not much upon heavenly things. It is that that some give
as the reason why Adam did not see his nakedness, some think that he had so
much converse with God and with things above Sense, that he did not so much
mind or think of nakedness what it was, but whether that were so or no I will
not say, but this I say and am certain of, the reason why we are so troubled
with our nakednesses with any wants that we have, it is because we converse so
little with God, so little with spiritual things, the conversing with spiritual
things would lift us above the things of the world; Those that are bit or stung
with a Snake, it is because they tread upon the ground, if they could be lifted
up above the earth they need never fear to be stung with the Snakes that are
crawling underneath: so I may compare the sinful distemper of murmuring, and
the temptations and evils that comes from thence to be like Snakes that crawl
up and down below, but if we could get higher we should not be stung by them: A
heavenly conversation is the way for Contentment.

The Seventh Direction.
A seventh rule is, Do not promise to your selves too much beforehand, do not
make account of too great things: It is good for us to take hold very low and
not think to pitch too high, do not soar too high in your thoughts beforehand,
to think, oh if I had this and this, and imagine great matters to your selves,
but be as good Jacob, you know he was a man that lived a very contented life in
a mean condition, (says he) Lord if I may but have clothes to put on, and meat
to eat; he looked no higher, he was content with that: so if we would not pitch
our thoughts high and think that we might have what others have, so much, and
so much, when we meet with disappointments we would not be so much troubled:
and so Paul, If we have but meat and drink and clothing, let us be therewith
content; he did not soar too high aloft, those that look at high things in the
world they meet with disappointments and so they come to be discontent; be as
high as you will in Spiritual meditations, God gives liberty there to any one
of you to be as high as you will, above Angels, but for your outward estate God
would not have you aim at high things, Seek thou great things (says the
Lord to Baruch) seek them not, you shall have your life for a prey. In these
times especially, it were a very great evil for any to aim at great things,
Seek them not, be willing to take hold low, and to creep low, and if God does
raise thee thou shall have cause to bless him, but if thou should not be
raised there would not be much trouble, one that creeps low cannot fall far,
but it is those that are on high whose fall does bruise them most; that is a
good rule, Promise not your selves great matters, neither aim at any great
things in the world.

The Eighth Direction.
Labor to get your hearts mortified to the world, dead to the world: we must
not content our selves that we have gotten some reasoning about the vanity of
the Creature, and such kind of things as these are, but we must exercise
mortification, and be crucified to the world, says Paul, I die daily, we
should die daily to the world, We are baptized into the death of Christ, that
is to signify that we have taken such a profession as to profess to be even
as dead men to the world, now there is no crosses that falls out in the world
that does trouble those that are dead, if our hearts were dead to the world we
should not be much troubled with the changes of the world, nor the tossings
about of worldly things. As it is very observable in those soldiers that came
to break the bones of Christ, they brake the legs of one that was crucified
with him, and of the other, but when they came to Christ they found he was
dead, and so they did not break his legs, there was a providence in it, to
fulfill a Prophecy, but because they found he was dead they did not break his
bones. Let Afflictions and trouble find thee with a mortified heart to the
world and they will not break thy bones; the bones of those that are broken by
crosses and afflictions are those that are alive to the world, that are not
dead to the world; but one that has a mortified heart and dead to the world,
no afflictions or troubles will break the bones of such a one, that is, they
will not be very grievous or painful to such a one as is mortified to the
world: This I fear is a mystery and riddle to many, for one to be dead to the
world, to be mortified to the world. Now it is not my work to open to you what
Mortification is, or death to the world is, but only thus, to have our hearts
so taken off from the things of the world, as to use them as if one used them
not, not to make account that our lives, our comforts, our happiness does
consist in these things, they are things that are of another nature that our
happiness does consist in, and we may be happy without these, this is a kind
of deadness to the world.

The Ninth Direction.
Let not men and women pore too much upon their Afflictions, that is, busy
their thoughts too much to look down into their Afflictions; you shall have
many people that all their thoughts are taken up about what their crosses and
afflictions are, they are altogether thinking and speaking of them, it is just
with them as with a child that has a sore about him, his finger is always
upon the sore; and so men and women their thoughts are always upon their
afflictions, when they awake in the night their thoughts are upon their
afflictions, and when they converse with others (nay it may be when they are
praying to God) they are thinking of their afflictions. Oh! no mervail though
you live a discontented life, if your thoughts be always poring upon such
things, you should rather labor to have your thoughts upon those things that
may comfort you: You shall have many that if you propound any rule to them to
do them good, they take it well while they are with you, and thank you for it,
but when they are gone they soon forget it. It is very observable of Jacob,
that when his wife died in childbirth, his wife called the child Ben-oni, that
is, a son of sorrows; now Jacob, he thought with himself, if I should call this
child Ben-oni, every time that I name him it will put me in mind of the death
of my dear wife, and of that affliction, and that will be a continued
affliction to me, therefore I will not have my child have that name; and so the
text says, that Jacob called his name Benjamin, and that was, the son of my
right hand: now this is to show us thus much, that when afflictions befalls us
we should not give way to have our thoughts continually upon them, but rather
upon those things that may stir up our thankfulness to God for mercies. It it
the similitude of Basil, a learned man, faith he, It is in this case as it is
with men and women that have sore eyes, now it is not fit for those to be
always looking upon the fire, or upon the beams of the Sun; no (says he) one
that has sore eyes must get things that are suitable to him, and such objects
as are fit for one that has such weak eyes, therefore they will get green
colors, as that being a more easy color and better for weak eyes, and they
will hang green sarsnet before their eyes because it is more suitable to them:
So weak spirits it is the very same, a man or woman that has a weak spirit,
they must not be looking upon the fire of their afflictions, upon those things
that deject, that cast them down, but they are to be looking rather upon that
which may be suitable for the healing and helping of them, they should be
considering of those things rather than the other. It will be of very great use
and benefit to you if you do lay it to heart, not to be poring always upon
afflictions, but upon mercies.

The Tenth Direction.
I beseech you observe this though you should forget many others. Make a good
interpretation of Gods ways toward you, if there can be any good
interpretation made of Gods ways toward you, make it. Ye think it much if you
have a friend that should always make bad interpretations of your ways
toward him, you would take that ill: If you should converse with people that
you cannot speak a word in their hearing but they are ready to make an ill
interpretation of it, and take it in an ill sense, you would think their
company to be very tedious to you; it is very tedious to the Spirit of God when
we make such ill interpretations of his ways toward us. If God deals with us
otherwise than we would have him, if there can be any sense worse than other
made of it we will be sure to make it; as thus, when an affliction does befall
you, there may be many good senses made of Gods works toward you, you should
think thus, it may be God intends only to try me by this, it may be God saw my
heart too much set upon the Creature, and so intends to show me what there is
in my heart, it may be that God saw that if my estate did continue I should
fall into sin, that the better my estate were the worse my soul would be, it
may be God intended only to exercise some grace, it may be God intends to
prepare me for some great work which he has for me, thus you should reason.

But we on the contrary make bad interpretations of Gods thus dealing with us,
and say, God does not mean this, surely the Lord means by this to manifest his
wrath and displeasure against me, and this is but a furtherance of further
evils that he intends toward me: Just as they did in the wilderness; God has
brought us hither to slay us. This is is the worst interpretation that possibly
you can make of Gods ways, Oh why will you make these worst interpretations
when there may be better? In 1 Cor. 13.5. when the Scripture speaks of love
(says the text) Love thinks no evil. Love is of that nature that if there
may be ten interpretations made of a thing if nine of them be naught and one
good, Love will take that which is good and leave the other nine; and so though
there might be ten interpretations presented to thee concerning Gods ways
toward thee, and if but one be good and nine naught, thou should take that
one that is good and leave the other nine. I beseech you consider, God does not
deal by you as you deal with him, should God make the worst interpretation of
all your ways toward him, as you do of his toward you it would be very ill
with you, God is pleased to manifest his love thus to us, to make the best
interpretations of what we do, and therefore it is, that God does put a sense
upon the actions of his people that one would think could hardly be, as thus,
God is pleased to call those perfect that have but any uprightness of heart in
them, he accounts them perfect, Be ye perfect as your heavenly father is
perfect; uprightness in Gods sense is perfection. Now alas when we look into
our own hearts we can scarce see any good at all there, and yet God is plesed
to make such an interpretation as to say, it is perfect: When we look into our
own hearts we can see nothing but uncleanness, God, he calls you his Saints,
he calls the meanest Christian that has the least grace under the greatest
corruption, his Saint; you say, we cannot be Saints here, but yet in Gods
esteem we are Saints: You know the usual title the holy Ghost gives (in several
of the Epistles) to those that had any grace, any uprightness, is, To the
Saints in such a place; you see what an interpretation God puts upon them, they
are Saints to him, and so I might name in diverse other particulars, God makes
the best interpretation of things, if there be abundance of evil and a little
good, God rather passes by the evil and takes notice of the good: That sometimes
I have made use of, which is a very observable placs in Peter, concerning
Sarah, Sarah had a speech to her husband in Genesis, 18.12. she called her
husband lord, but there was but that one good word in an ill speech, it was an
unbeleeving speech, but yet when the Apostle mentions that speech in 1 Pet.
3.6. the holy Ghost leaves all the ill, and commends her for calling her
husband lord, for putting a reverend title upon her husband; thus how
graciously does God deal with us? If there be but one good word among a great
many ill, what an interpretation God makes! so should we do, if there be but
any one good interpretation that we can make of a thing we should rather make
use of the good one than of the ill; Oh my brethren, (I would I could now speak
only to such as are godly) retain good thoughts of God, take heed of judging
God to be a hard master, make good interpretations of his ways, and that is a
special means to help you to Contentment in all your courses.

The Eleventh Direction.
Do not so much regard the fancies of other men, as what indeed you feel your
selves; for the reason of our coffeehouse many times, is rather from the
fancies of other men than from what we find we want our selves, we think
poverty to be such a great evil, why? because it is so esteemed by others, more
than what people feel in it themselves except they be in extremity of poverty:
I Will give you an evident demonstration that almost all the discontent in the
world is rather from the fancies of others than from the evil that is upon
themselves. You that think your estates to be low and you are thereupon
discontent, and it is a grievous affliction to you, but if all men in the world
were poorer than you, then you would not be discontent, then you would rejoice
in your estates though you had not a penny more than you have: As take a man
that can get but his twelve pence a day, and you will say, this were but a poor
thing to maintain a family? but suppose there were no man in the world that
had more than this, yea that all other men but your selves had somewhat less
wages than you, then you would think your condition pretty good, you should
have no more then than you have now, therefore it appears by this that it is
rather from the fancies of other men than what you feel that makes you think
your condition to be so grievous, for if all the men in the world looked upon
you as happy, more happy than themselves then you would be contented; Oh let
not your happiness depend upon the fancies of other men. It is a speech of
Chrisostom I remember in this very case, Let us not make the people in this
case to be our lords, as we must not make men to be the lords of our faith, so
not the lords of our comforts; that is, that our comfort should depend more
upon their imaginations, than upon what we feel in our selves. It may be others
think you to be in an afflicted condition, yea but I thank God, for my self I
do not so apprehend it, were it not for the disgrace, dis-esteem and slightings
of other men, my condition would not be so bad to me as now it is, this is that
that makes my condition afflictive.

The Twelfth Direction.
Be not inordinately taken up with the comforts of this world when you have
them. When you have them do not take too much content in them: that is a certain
rule that, look how inordinate any man or woman is in sorrow when a comfort is
taken from them, so much immoderate were they in their rejoicing in the comfort
when they had it: as now for instance, God takes away a child and you are
inordinately sorrowful, beyond what God allows in a natural or Christian way,
now though I never knew before how your heart was toward the child, yet when I
see this, (though you be a mere stranger to me) I may without breach of charity
conclude that your heart was immoderately set upon your child or husband, or
upon any other comfort that I see you greiving for when God has taken it away;
If you hear ill tidings about your estates, and your hearts are dejected
immoderately, and you are in a discontented way because of such and such a
cross, certainly your hearts were immoderatly set upon the world; and so
likewise for your credit, if you hear others report this or that ill of you,
and your hearts are dejected because you think you suffer in your name, your
hearts were inordinatly set upon your name and credit; now therefore the way
for you not to be immoderate in your sorrows for afflictions, it is not to be
immoderate in your love and delights when you have prosperity. And these are
the principal Directions for our help that we may live quiet and contented
lives.

My brethren, to conclude all for this point, if I could tell you that I knew
how to show you a way never to be in want of any thing, I make no question but
then we should have much flocking to such a Sermon, when a man should undertake
to mannifest to people that they should never be in want any more, but I have
been now preaching unto you that that comes to as much, that that countervails
this, that which is in effect all one. Is it not almost all one, never to be in
want, or never to be without Contentment? that man or woman that is never
without a contented spirit, truly, can never be said to want much, Oh! the Word
holds forth a way full of comfort and peace to the people of God even in this
world, you may live happy lives in the midst of all the storms and tempests in
the world, there is an Ark that you may come into, and no men in the world may
live such comfortable, cheerful, and contented lives as the Saints of God: Oh
that we had learned this lesson: I have been many Sermons about this lesson of
Contentment, but I am afraid that you will be longer in learning of it than I
have been preaching of it; it is a harder thing to learn it than it is to speak
or preach of it. (I remember) I have read of one man reading of that place in
the 39. Psalm, I will take heed that I offend not with my tongue: says he, I
have been these 38. years a learning this lesson and have not learned it
thoroughly. The truth is, there are many (I am afraid) that have been professors
near eight and thirty years have hardly learned this lesson, it were a good
lesson for young professors to begin to learn this betimes: But now, this
lesson of Christian Contentment it is as hard, and perhaps you may be many
years in learning it: I am afraid there be some Christians that have not yet
learned, Not to offend grossly with their tongues: The Scripture says, All a
man's Religion is vain, if he cannot bridle his tongue; therefore, those that
make any profession of godliness, one would think they should quickly learn
this lesson, such a lesson that except learned, it makes all their Religion
vain: But for this lesson of Christian Contentment it may take up more time to
learn, and there is many that are learning it all the days of their lives and
yet are not Proficients; but God forbid that it should be said of any of us
concerning this lesson, as the Apostle says of Widows in Timothy, That they
were ever learning, and never came to the knowledge of the truth. Oh let us not
be ever learning this lesson of Contentment and yet never come to have skill in
it. You would think it much if you had used the Sea twenty years, and yet to
have attained to no skill in your art of navigation, you will say, I have used
the Sea 20. or 30. years and I hope I may know by this time what belongs to
Sea; Oh that you would but say so in respect of the Art of Christianity! When
there is any thing that is spoken concerning the duty of a Christian, Oh that
Christians could but say I have been a Christian thus long, and I hope I am not
to seek in such a thing that is so necessary for a Christian, here is a
necessary lesson for a Christian that Paul said, He had learned in all estates
therewith to be content. Oh be not content with your selves till you have
learned this lesson of Christian Contentment, gotten some better skill in it
than heretofore.

Now there is in the text another lesson, which is a hard lesson, I have
learned to Abound, that does not so nearly concern us at this time, because the
times are afflictive times, and there is now (more than ordinary) an
uncertainty in all things in the world, in such times as these are, there is
few that have such an abundance that they need to be much taught in that lesson.

FINIS.
THE SAINTS DVTY IN TIMES OF EXTREMITY.
WHAT the certainty of the cause of those fears that are upon the hearts of
people is not yet apparent, but that there are many distracted fears in their
hearts, that is apparent to the full; and therefore though I prepared for that
ordinary course as formerly, yet for this time I desire that you would turn to
that Scripture (that I might speak a word in season) in

EXODUS, 14. part of the 13. verse. Stand still, and see the Salvation of the
Lord.

THE beginning of the verse is thus, And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye
not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord. In the former Chapter we
have Pharaoh dismissing Israel out of Egypt: In this Chapter we have him
pursuing Israel with a newheated fury, against all common sense and reason, his
malice and rage besotted him, because God intented to destroy him: though Gods
hand appeared gloriously for his People before, yet Pharaoh will not see the
Majesty of the Lord, but he shall see it; he gathers all the strength that
possibly he can, and seems too rash in his way, he overtakes, and overtakes
them in a place of the greatest advantage that possibly could be; for the Text
says, that they were before Pi-hahiroth, in the first verse, between Migdol
and the Sea, over against Baal-zephon, and that by Gods appointment too; they
were there when Pharaoh comes to find them, there the Sea is before them, all
the strength of Egypt is behind them, and they were at Pi-hahiroth: Carverna
rupibus inclus^, so turned by some, not the proper signification, for Pi is the
mouth, and hahiroth that signifies f^ramen; they were got into a hole, (as it
were) into the mouth of a hole, that was compassed about with rocks one each
side, that had high rocks about it, so the word imports: and not only so, but
between Migdol over against Baal zephon, Migdol signifies a tower; so that in
that place the Egyptians had a tower built likewise: besides the advantage of
the rocks and of the hills, there was a tower built for their further
strengthening, and there the people of Israel were, an unarmed people; yea, not
only by the tower, but they were over against Baal-zephon. I remember in the
last Exercise, I showed you what Baal was, and what several Baals there were
that the Heathens worshipped for their gods, a general name it is, sometimes for
any other Idol: This Baal-zephon it was a god that they worshipped upon this
ground, they had an Idol set in that place, at the going out of Egypt, that was
to watch those that were to go out, for so zephon comes of zuri speculatus est,
the god was to watch, was to stand and watch any run-away-servant, or any
people that did go out of Egypt without any leave, they trusting in this Baal,
that he would stop them, and stay them, and he was set in that place for that
very purpose; and thereupon his name was Baal-zephon: As Conjurers by their
magic arts will have their spells, spirits that shall stop men in such a place,
they shall not go out of such an orchyard, or such a yard where they come in:
So the Egyptians had there by their magical arts, they got (as it were) a Spel,
a Baal-zephon, a god to stop people in that place where they would have them
stopped: that is the meaning of this name of the Idol Baal-zephon. So that you
see what a strait Israel was in upon their going out of Egypt, they were got
before the Sea, the Egyptians had all their strength behind, in a hole of
rocks, and a tower, and their god to stop them altogether, so that they
themselves made sure of them, and said that they were entangled in the land of
the wilderness; Being in those great straits their hearts began to fail them,
they began to be extremely troubled, and in a most grievous distemper of spirit
they were coming, and chiding with Moses, and said to Moses in the 11. verse.
Because there were no graves in Egypt, have thou taken us to die in the
wilderness, wherefore have thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of
Egypt? We had rather we had continued in Egypt still, What! Brought to these
straits! these extremities! such a perplexity as we are now in? would to God we
had bin in Egypt: this was the baseness of their spirits, they would rather be
under vile bondage, than endure any hazard, then be put to any straits and
difficulties: It is the baseness of the spirits of many at this day amongst us,
because they see that those ways that have bin taken by the Parliament brings
some troublesome difficulties, some straits, they cry out of the times, I would
to God we were, as we were before, we were well enough before, we were quiet
enough before, we never knew what such stirs as these meant before, now we are
brought into these perplexities, I, this they have brought us into; and thus
they are ready to murmur and repine. Oh unthankful unworthy generation! men,
women of vile spirits that shall do so. It was a speech of Cyrus, speaking unto
his soldiers, The Historian has this expression of him. It is the part of a
true valiant man, either to live honorably, or die honorably, one of them;
but that is the part of a base coward, rather to live basely than to die
honorably, rather to be under any base servitude, than to be in any hazard of
their lives, though perhaps their lives may be saved too. I remember Philo tells
us, even of women, (for in these times, the publik cause of the Kingdom,
suffers exceedingly much by the timorousness of the spirits of women) that
being in danger of their enemies, of being brought into bondage by them, they
took their children and threw them into the rivers, with these words, You shall
not serve, we had rather see you die than be slaves. I commend not that fact
that it was well done, but to show what a spirit the heathen women had to see
their children die rather than have them bondslaves: Indeed, what were our
lives worth? were they worth having if we return to our bondage again? The
utmost of the danger is, our lives, the killing of our bodies, yet we hope God
will preserve them too, but suppose the worst, it is but death; but if our
lives should not be hazarded now, and if through base cowardice, we should
decline the Cause of God, surely our lives would not be worth taking up, the
living after that manner we are like to live, in that bondage unto these
Cavalliers, notorious wretches, blasphemers of God himself, that would make our
lives worth very little, nay your children perhaps to be brought up in Popery,
and to hold a candle to a Mass Priest at the Altar; that may be the employment
of your children, if so be that they should live: But these people being now in
this extremity, and manifesting so much passion, being in a distemper; Moses as
the Captain of the Lord comes to the people, and speaks bravely to them,
encouraging of them, says Moses, Fear not, but stand still, and see the
salvation of the Lord: stand still, the word is (...) state, it signifies to
settle and compose, to be in a settled condition; it is a reflect word upon our
selves, so the Learned know, that it is to work upon our selves, to form,
signifies so, it is as much as if he should say, Do you work upon your own
hearts, to get your hearts to stand still, work upon your hearts to do that,
work arguments upon your spirits, and never leave working until you have
wrought your hearts into such a frame, as that you may stand still, and be
quiet: At first even the dearest servants of God will find their hearts to shake
in time of hazards and extremities, but when they come to work upon their
spirits, to bring arguments to lay to their hearts, there they get some
advantage, that their hearts grow quiet quickly: For that we have a notable
text in the example of David, in the 62. Psalm, (says David there, in the 1,
and 2. verses) Truly my Soul waits upon God, from him comes my salvation,
he only is my Rock and my Salvation, he is my defense, I shall not greatly be
moved; Mark, he begins to exercise Faith, and he says, he shall not greatly be
moved, as if he should have said, I confess, I cannot say, but that my heart
is somewhat stirred, I am somewhat afraid, and I feel some working in my
spirit, but I hope I shall not greatly be moved; he falls a working upon his
heart more, and considers of his innocence; and of the mischievous device of
the ungodly; how long will ye imagine mischief against a man, ye shall be
slain all of you; then again in the 5. verse; My soul wait thou only upon
God, for my expectation is from him, he only is my Rock: And then he repeats
the words again, after he had been rubbing upon his heart the same meditation,
then he fetches in the words again, that he had in the 2. verse; He only is my
Rock and my salvation; but mark now, what advantage he gets of himself, in the
6. verse, He only is my Rock and my salvation, and my defense, I shall not be
moved; before, he is my Rock, my salvation, my defense, I shall not greatly be
moved, but after he had been working further upon his own heart, then he gains
and says, now he is my Rock, and my salvation, and my defense, I shall not be
moved; I have overcome these distracting fears, I have got the advantage and
the victory, blessed be God I have overcome them, God is my salvation, and my
glory; now he begins to glory and triumph after he had wrought upon himself; So
that he in this did indeed stand still in this phrase, by working upon his own
heart, though he was stirred a little at first, yet he got the victory: So
indeed not to be moved, the 70. turn this word, stand still stete only, but yet
the notes upon it, they say it is read likewise stetite, that is, a standing
fast, stand fast, it is a word, taken from soldiers in their ranks; soldiers
that are in their ranks when they apprehend a danger, they must not go out of
their way, because of the danger, it is as much as their lives are worth, to go
out of the way, but they must stand, they must stand stille, though there be
never such danger, yet they must stand still in their ranks: that is the
meaning of the word: I shall open more what the meaning of the holy Ghost is by
and by, what kind of stand still, this should be; but thus for the word, it is
such a stand still, as the soldiers have in their ranks, not to go out of
their ranks for fear. The word is used in Scripture diverse times for, standing
fast, as in the 1 of Philiphians, 27. That you stand fast in one spirit; now
the word fast, is not in the Greek Text, but only the other word in the Greek
Text; and so you have the same word in the other Scriptures; in the 1. of the
Corinthians, 16.13. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, Stetite, it is only two
words in the Greek, as it is in the English, stand fast; so that this stand, it
is not only a standing, but a standing fast, stand still in your ranks, fast,
be not in a hurry up and down, and be not in a confusion: If upon danger
soldiers should presently be in a confusion in the Army, what would become of
them? and so the truth is, in a City, in any place, where there is any danger,
if people grow to a confusion, they are gone, they are lost, you must stand
still in your ranks, stand still; There are several stand-stils, some very vile
and naught, and others very good: there is first,

1 A stand-still out of amazement, When a man through fear is at a stand, and
dears not stir any further; now this cannot be meant in the text; for Moses
says, Fear not, but stand still, therefore it is not a standing still out of
fear, because I am astonished.

2 There is a stand-still, out of ignorance; Because I do not know which way to
take; and this is not in the text neither: Thus many in our time, they stand
still, they plead ignorance; they stand still, they will be of no side, and
they plead ignorance, they know not what to do; they say, they know not what to
do, one says one thing, and another says another thing, the King commands one
thing, and the Parliament another, they know not what to do; to go against the
King, is it not Rebellion? and so they stand still because they plead
ignorance, and their consciences are not informed. It has bin the work of
diverse Ministers, that have hazarded themselves in this, to open to you the
Counsel of God, and to set your consciences at liberty; diverse things I have
spoken in this place, but certainly men do blind their own eyes, and are
willing to stand still, to plead ignorance, after so much light revealed: It is
strange that any rational man should speak of rebellion now, when as we know,
that the King himself sent aid to the Rochellers, and that (we know) in the
case of their liberties, and Religion; they took up arms to defend themselves
against their own King, and he sent help to them, surely he did not himself
take them to be rebels, and King James in his answer to Byron that enveighs
against the Protestants in France; he does stand to justify what the
Protestants in France did, even King James himself in that book of his, in his
answer to Byron; and besides we must acknowledge all the Protestant Churches in
the world to be Rebels, if it be Rebellion, merely to take up arms. Know we
not that our own King has matched his Daughter to the young Prince of Orange,
now we know the Prince of Orange is the General of the States in their fields,
as the Earl of Essex is the General of our forces here; and their business
against the King of Spain (it was their praise) to defend their Liberties, and
Religion, and still they maintain the same quarrel, and the Prince of Orange he
is their General, and undertakes it: We desire nothing but the maintenance of
our Liberty and of our Religion, though things be not gone so far yet, as to
take our estates, yet the Cause that they began withal, it is our Cause, and
what the General was there, the same in a kind (there is no great difference)
here; and certainly if it were Rebellion, our King would never have matched his
Daughter unto the Son of such a Rebel; if it should be Rebellion merely to take
up Arms to defend Religion, and to defend the Liberties of the Country that
are according unto Laws; yea, we know further, that the King himself has
acknowledged our Brethren the Scots, to be loving subjects, to be his loyal
subjects, do we more than they? do we more in our cause? nay, have we done so
much in our cause, as they have done? how generally was it there in their
Kingdom, and shall it be acknowledged they are loving subjects doing so much,
and we be accounted Rebels? surely no man can plead, to stand still through
ignorance upon that ground.

3. There is a third stand-still, and the truth is, though it be not through
Ignorance, it is though a worse principle, and that is of Neuteralizing; that
is, when men though they are informed well enough, yet they stand still to see
which will be the strongest side, and are loath to appear yet, they know not
which side will most prevail, but they have such a principle in their spirits,
to go to the strongest side, which way soever it be, only they will stand still
till it appear: My brethren, certainly we can admit of no Neuters in these
times; the times are grown to a greater height, than that any should be
admitted as a Neuter, either for us or against us; whatsoever is not for us at
this time, now coming to this straight, may well be concluded to be against us.

4. There is a fourth wicked stand-still, and that is out of sullenness of
spirit; and that is more particular, and that is of many men and women,
especially that are in some troubles of conscience, and when they are seeking
of God, and performing duties that God requires of them, and do not find that
encouragement that their hearts desire, they leave off all, and have no mind to
do any thing, but even stand still and die, and will even sink in a sullen
discouragement, and go no further, leave off their work, leave off duty, what
should I go on in doing duty, for I get no good by it, I am never a whit the
better? and so they stand still out of a sullen discouragement: The Devil
himself is the most discouraged Spirit in the world, and yet he is the
proudest Spirit in the world; and this standing still out of discouragement,
may come out of pride, and stoutnesse of heart, though you think it is out of
Humility.

5. There is a sluggish standing still, and that is sinful and wicked, when
people stand still because they are idle, and are loath to venture themselves,
or to put themselves to trouble, to go forward in any work, this work is
tedious; and thus the sluggard he stands still, and is ready to catch at any
Argument, that may plead for his standing still: My brethren this is not that
stand still here, that we should stand still and do nothing, and be sluggards;
no, but the stand still here is, after we have gone on, and done to the utmost
that we are able, that then we should stand still, and commit the work to God,
as if we had done nothing at all; there is the stand still: I shall speak of
more presently; As that worthy Divine said, he would labor to preach, as if he
expected no assistance, and then he would expect assistance, as if he had not
labored at all; So Warriors and people in danger, they should prepare in the
use of all means, as if they expected no further help, and then they should
expect help from God, as if they had used no means at all; so we must use
means: As that brave speech of Joab, Come let us play the men, let us fight for
our Cities, and the people of our God, and then let God do what seems him
good; then he would stand still, and look for his salvation of God; a speech
even of Joab himself, not then a sluggish stand still, it is no hindrance at
all to any preparations that may be used: therefore all these are naught.

6. There is an obediential stand-still; that is, for the hearts of men and
women to stand still, to wait, to know further of Gods mind, what God
reveals, our hearts are willing to yield unto, and we will listen to hear
what the mind of God further is, what God would have us to do; to stand still,
to hearken to what the Lord would have us to do, with hearts resigned up to
him, and resolved to walk accordingly to it; this is good, and that is somewhat
of it, but that is not all.

7. There is a stand-still out of faith; a believing standstill; and that is
when (though in the greatest extremity) I having used what means I can for
helping me, yet I see my self wrapped up in extremity, I will now exercise
Faith. First,

1. To quiet my heart; to get out of my spirit those distracting thoughts of
that hurry and tumult that there is in the heart, and to get all silenced, all
murmurings, all distractions, all giddiness of spirit; and upproar that many
times is in the hearts of men and women in time of danger; so by faith I come
to quiet these, and to get my heart to be still, to be still within me; Be
still O my soul; and therefore the Scripture expresses the waiting upon God out
of Faith by a word of silence, in the 62. Psalm, at the beginning, and verse
5. My soul waits upon God, it is silenced, so the Hebrew word signifies, it
signifies a silence in God: there is many times in the hearts of men and women
(when they apprehend any danger) a great deal of hurrying and noise in their
hearts, all is in a combustion in their hearts; it is a grievous thing to see a
City all in a combustion, and in a tumult; there are many men and women's
hearts, in as great a tumult upon apprehension of danger, as many times a whole
City is, there is a rising in their hearts, and a mighty noise there: Sometimes
they keep (it may be in private and public exigencies) their tongues silent,
but their hearts boil within them: but your hearts must be silent, you must
cry to your heart, be silent there; my heart is now in a mutiny, and a great
deal of stir, cry silence to your hearts, that your hearts and thoughts may be
composed; that is the meaning of the word, that there should be a settled
composed frame of spirit in the hearts of men and women, in the times of
extremity: that is the first. Secondly,

2. When it is out of Faith, there should be a keeping our stations till God
calls us out; not to run up and down this way and that way, and to think of
nothing but of shifting courses, to shift for our selves: As in time of danger
(I verily believe) if we could look into the thoughts of many men and women,
they scarce have any thought but merely of shifting their place or house; they
think to shift for themselves: Now we should not busy our thoughts so much
about shifting, as about quieting our hearts in believing: For (my brethren) in
times of extremity of danger, God calls for Courage more than discretion;
though it is true, Discretion is not excluded, yet that is not that explicit
and special work that is called for in times of danger; I mean discretion to
shift for your selves; but discretion so far as may improve courage: the main
work that God now calls for at this time, it is Courage and Discretion, and
Prudence only so far as to manage Courage, and to drive it on further, and to
improve it, not to abate it, that is not the Discretion certainly that now is
called for, but to keep our station.

Quest. But you will say, In time of danger may we not fly? must men keep their
stations? is it not lawful to avoid danger and to fly? Then we shall accuse
many of our brethren, that heretofore have fled in time of danger.

Resp. (My Brethren) you are to know, that the case now is far different from
the case that was heretofore; the case heretofore was especially (for the
present) directed against particulars, not against the general, though there
were plots against the general, but the hazard and the danger was against such,
and such particular men, as especially your Ministers that were most faithful
and conscionable, they were the forefront, they did bear the brunt, and it was
aimed especially against them; now the case is far different when the aim of
the Adversary is against particulars, and not against the godly in general;
when it is against particulars there may be all lawful means, by an avoiding
and flying: when it is against the godly in general then every one should stand
still, and keep in their ways and stations, to come in, and add what strength
they can to the public cause; and certainly those that shall shift then, and
think to fly then, God may justly meet with them; as we read of Jeremiah, and
Vrijah, Vrijah the Priest he flies in public time of danger, and he was sent
for, and catched, and put to death; Jeremiah stays, and is saved: But when the
case is the danger of particular persons, then it is nothing against this text,
to fly in any lawful way; many people will cry out against flying by a lawful
way in times of danger, because they think they may shift from flying
themselves; and if others that are in danger should not do so, they would be
far enough from helping and assisting them in extremities, and yet they will be
crying out against it; Peter Martyr I remember has this answer to it; It is
just for all the world in this case, as a man that has a dangerous sickness
upon him, and the Physicians tell him, there is no way but by taking such
strong Physic, or by cutting off a leg, or a limb, now he comes and pleads, I
will not so distrust God, and be so impatient of my present pain, as to take
such a course to help me, I Will rather continue patient and quiet, and endure my
present pain, and trust in God, rather than put my self to any such hazard; now
is this man more patient, than another man that will take such strong Physic
or have a member cut off? is it through the strength of his patience? no, it is
rather through the weakness of his spirit, because the other is a certain
great pain and hazard, and while he goes on in the use of ordinary means, he
has a lesser pain, with hope that he may be delivered from a greater, and
preserved himself. So this is the Objection against flying in particular
danger, because the flying is a certain great suffering, they that have fled,
have found it so: now others will rather satisfy themselves to endure a little
uncertain suffering, than to go upon a certain great suffering; and that is the
very ground. But that this is not against Faith at all, to fly in danger, when
it is particularly aimed at particulars, I Will give you but a Scripture or two
for that to clear it, that it is not against Faith, It is remarkable (we might
spend a great deal of our time in this case here, but I have done with it) in
the 10. of Matthew, When they persecute you (says Christ) in this City, fly
into another: he speaks of particular persecution of this or that body, and not
of a whole Kingdom: now flee (say they!) we will be more believing, and trust
in God, and not be afraid, have we not a good cause, and is not God with us?
this would argue too much fear; Mark, in the next words Christ speaks after he
had given them liberty, and commanded them to fly; (says he) fear them not
therefore (though it is the next thing he speaks of in the 28. verse) and fear
not them that can kill the body: you see these two can well stand together,
that there is not fear of them that can kill the body, and yet there is a
flying; and so Christ himself flies in the 12. of Matthew, when he did but hear
what Herod did to John, when Jesus knew it (that was when the Pharisees sought
him, when he knew it) he did withdraw himself, in the 12, and 13. verses, And
when Jesus heard of it, be departed thence, etc. When he heard but what was
done to John, Christ withdrew himself and went away: Therefore it may stand
with faith, so to avoid danger in particular Cases: But now when persecution is
general, we are to stand still and not avoid our station.

The third thing in this stand still of faith is, The looking up for the
Salvation of God, the expecting a good issue one way or other; I know not how
Salvation will come, but that there will be Salvation one way or other, that my
soul rests upon; I stand not still out of stoutness of spirit, or because I
think I have means enough to resist, whether I have means or no, when I am put
into the greatest extremity, yet I can stand still, and look for Salvation.
What* stand still, and look for the Salvation of the Lord? what talk you of
Salvation (might they say to Moses) when there is nothing but destruction
before us? True, if you look before you, behind you, and without you, and
within your selves there is nothing but destruction, yet look up to Heaven and
there is salvation, stand still and see the Salvation of the Lord. I have done
no more than the mere openning of the text, and what is contained in it: There
are these 4. Doctrinal Conclusions in the Text.

1. Doct. That when God is in a way of mercy and salvation to his people, he
does many times bring them into great straights, even then when he is in a way
of Salvation. 2. Doct. That in time of these great straights, even the people
of God are subject to have their hearts to be overwhelmed with trouble,
distracting fears, and to be disquieted. 3. Doct. That it is our duty to stand
still, keep quiet, and look for Gods Salvation in the time of the greatest
straights. 4. Doct. That the sight of Gods Salvation coming after straights, is
a glorious sight to behold: Stand still, see the savation of God. These are the
4. For the first then.
First, When God is in a way of salvation, yet he may and does diverse times
bring his people into very great staits. Truly, this straight in the text is
exceeding remarkable: but I Will show you further, how when God was about to save
this people of Israel out of the Egyption bondage, (which is the work God has
now to do with us to save us out of the Egyptian bondage that we were in, and
that we were going further into,) after they were delivered from this straight,
from Pharaoh and all his host; yet in the 15. Chap. you shall find, (the very
next Chapter;) after they were come out of the Sea, they presently wanted water
to drink, yea, the waters were bitter that they could not drink them (says the
text 15. verse.) The waters were bitter, they could not drink them, they were
ready to perish for want of water: As soon as ever they were delivered out of
that strait, mark the 16. Chap. they were in another as bad as that, there you
shall find they want bread, and were ready to starve for hunger; in Chap. 16.2,
3. And all the Assembly were ready to be killed for hunger (the text says:)
well, Moses cries to God, and God delivered them out of that straight too: In
the next Chap. they were in as great a straight too: They pitched at Rephidim,
and there they had no water to drink again: I might go through the story, and
show you in the wilderness, what great straights God put them in, and yet God
was working salvation for them. When they come to possess the land, (because I
will not go through the story the time will not permit) they have Jordan to pass
over without any bridge, whether the bridges were cut down, or whether there
were none, I cannot tell; but it was more danger to pass over the bridges (if
there were any) because at that time (the text says) it was that Jordan flowed
over all his banks: so then it was at the worst time that could be, when the
banks of Jordan were all overflowed, yet God delivered them out of that
straight; When they were got over, there I might show you many other straights,
but I shall mention only one, that was this: The first enemy the people of God
fought with all in Canaan, they were discomfited, they were beaten back at the
first battle that ever they fought, when they came to set upon the land of
Canaan, and to fight with the adversary, there the adversary comes out, and
gets the day and makes them fly before them, that was at the fight at Ai, They
fled before the men of Ai, upon this Joshua fell down upon the ground; Why
Lord! What are we come to this? After all these straights that we come now to
fight with the people of Canaan, and they at the very first blow have the day,
and make us fly before them? now all the people will come out against us. If so
be people have such distracting fears now, suppose there should be a meeting of
both Armies, and you should hear that one Army flies before another, that our
men fly before those that come out against them, before the Cavelliers, what a
fear and distraction would there be then? yet so it was with the people of
Israel, though God was coming in with such a mighty hand to deliver them, and
to possess them of Canaan, yet at the very first blow, they had the worst, and
the people overcame them: It would take a mighty deal of time to show you the
straights that David, and Jos^ah, and Jehoshaphat, and Hezekiah werein, I Will
only give you a word or two about David, because it may be a very great help to
poor troubled spirits in time of straights; David he was in such straights
sometimes, that he professes himself even overwhelmed, Psalm. 61. and the
beginning: You shall find Psalm. 77.4. He could not speak. Many poor souls are
in grievous afflictions, and when we put them to go and open their hearts to
God and men, Oh I cannot speak (say they) David was in such straights that he
could not speak, yea he could not so much as look up, Psalm. 40.12. not so much
as look up to God, grievous straights that he was in. And the people of Israel
in their other Captivity, there were mountains before them; what straights did
God put them into? When they were come forth of Babylon, In Zech. 4. What art
thou O great mountain, that art before them? But examples will be needless to
illustrate the thing, it is so clear, that thus was Gods dealing with his
people. As with wicked men, when God is in a way of wrath against the ungodly,
he many times suffers them to prosper in the highest way, with the most
flourishing prosperity that ever they had in their lives: So when he is in a
way of salvation of his Saints, he lets them be in the lowest ebb that ever
they were in in all their lives: As in Job, 20. says the text there at the 5.
verse, In the fullness of his sufficiency be shall be in straights. In the
fullness of his sufficiency; what a phrase is here! A wicked man shall be in
straits when he is full, when he has sufficient (as he thinks,) in the fullness
of his sufficiency he shall be in straights: and on the other side, a godly man
in his greatest straights, he has a fullness of sufficiency; I will show you
that clear, in 2 Cor. 1.5. As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
consolation also abounds by Christ: We have a fullness of Consolation, when we
have a fullness of Suffering; yea, not only abound, but do super abound, for so
the word is; in 2 Cor. 7.4. I am (says he) filled with comfort, I am exceeding
joyful in all our tribulations: We are brought into tribulation, into great
straights, and I have a fullness filled with comfort, and exceeding joyful, more
than abundantly-joyful; so the word signifies: there is abounding in the other
text, but here is a super added to it, a super-abounding, more than joyful,
not in times of prosperity only: Carnal hearts never know how to rejoice but
in times of prosperity, when they can eat, and drink, and play, then they can
be merry; but the Saints know how to joy, how to be filled with joy, how to
abound in joy, and how to be exceedingly abounding in joy when they are in
tribulation: Thus, as wicked men are in straights in their sufficiencies; so
godly men when God is in a way of comfort, they may be in a way of great
affliction, and the reason of it may be,

1. Reason. Because God will humble his people, when he is in a way of
salvation: when God intends the greatest good to his people, and to raise them
the highest, he is very careful to keep them very low; that has always bin
the manner of Gods administrations: You see the reason of the peoples having
straights in the wilderness, it was from hence, in the 8. of Deuteronomie,
there God gives the reason, in the second verse, Thou shall remember all the
way, which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to
what end? why were they so long in the wilderness? it was (says the text) to
humble them; I brought thee into the wilderness, and it was to humble thee:
Does God (my brethren) bring us into straights, now in these times? Certainly
he is in a way of salvation for England, he is in a way of salvation to do us
good in the latter end, but yet he is bringing us into straights, Oh! we may
thank the pride of our spirits, we have not been brought low enough to this
very day: There has been (indeed) some humiliation of some of the people of
God, in fasting and praying, they have humbled their souls; but yet though
there has been humble expressions, yet not humble hearts; for after those
times they have had (many of them) exceeding froward spirits, and that argues
apparently, their hearts are not humbled and broken, when their spirits after
days of humiliation, still should be froward and pettish as before: But
especially for the generallity of the Kingdom, how far are we from being an
humbled people! we are not yet capable of what mercy God intends for us, in
this regard, because we are not humbled; Oh the exceeding pettishness, envy,
and pride (and worse a great deal) not only in many people of the Land, but
even in those that are godly and gracious! how are the spirits of men, of one
brother opposite to another! that because there is some difference in judgment
in such and such a thing; O they could be content (many of them) to have them
rid out of the Land, and if God did not prevent (whereas the persecution by
Bishops is now at an end) who knows (except God humble their hearts more)
whether many of Gods dear servants, that do but differ in some point of
judgment, might not meet with a great deal of sufferings, even from those
that are godly, and that is the worst suffering, better a thousand times suffer
from wicked men, it is not so hard to the spirits of godly men to suffer from
never so many Bishops, and wicked men, as to suffer from one godly man: Oh!
there wants that charity and tenderness of spirit one toward another that
should be; we are not yet humbled and brought upon our knees, and therefore it
is just with God to lay us upon our backs a while, or that we should even be
with our faces upon the ground, and confounded in our own thoughts before that
great Salvation comes that God intends for us. That Is the first reason.

2. Reas. God brings to straights, because he takes much delight in the
Exercise of faith. (My beloved) Faith, it is a most glorious grace, it is one
of the most glorious things that ever God enabled any creature to do, and
especially now, when there is so much guilt upon them; it is a more glorious
work than Adam performed in Innocence, For a poor creature to believe upon God,
for his good here; and in the midst of all extremities to rely upon him, it is
a most glorious work, and God is exceedingly delighted in it, and therefore the
Scripture calls Faith, Precious Faith, in the beginning of the 2 Epistle of
Peter: now God loves the acting of precious things; God loves to see the
actings of all his creatures, every creature active in his way; but when God
has put such a precious grace as faith into the heart; Oh! how God does
delight to see the acting of that precious Faith: and therefore it has been the
way of God to go quite cross, after the Lord has made a promise of mercy and
salvation, he goes seemingly cross, only to exercise Faith; I think I have
told you sometimes of that to Abraham, that there were but two promises made to
him, first, That the Country that God would give him, should flow with milk and
honey: and secondly, His seed should be as the stars of Heaven: and mark what
way God goes to bring this about, as soon as ever he gets into Canaan, he was
ready to starve there; is this the country that flows with milk and honey? and
then for the other, His seed should be as the stars of Heaven; he stayed twenty
years before he had a child, and Isaac stayed forty years before he had a
child; and yet his seed should be great; and Isaac must be killed too: and then
there was another thing exercised his faith, he would give him the Land, and
yet notwithstanding, during his life, he must not possess one foot of the
Land, but only a burying-place, and what was the reason of all this? It was to
exercise his faith; and the promise God makes to his Son Christ, I will give
thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth
for thy possession; yet Christ must not have a hole to hide his head in, he
has not so much as the foxes and the birds have to hide his head in. Thus the
way of God is, to seem to go quite contrary, that he might draw forth that
glorious work of faith he so much delights in, and because this is the only
time of exercising this precious grace, and there shall be no such faith in
Heaven exercised as this is, and therefore God (because he will have as much as
may be of the excellency of this faith) though he be in a way of salvation, he
brings his people into straights.

3. Reas. Because the Lord delights so much in the prayers of his people, that
he might draw out their prayers: Oh! the voice is sweet, the voice of prayer it
is very melodious in the ears of God: It Is true, God delights in a praising
voice too, but here in this world, rather in prayer, why? because God shall
have a praising voice to all eternity, Gods Saints shall be praising him to all
eternity, but they shall not be praying to him to all eternity; now God
delighting so much in the praying voice of his Saints, and he knowing he shall
have a great deal of praise from his people when they are delivered from great
troubles, no marvel he does exercise his people: that which pleases God more
than Heaven and Earth is, the exercise of the faith and the prayers of his
people, they are the most pleasing things to God in all the world, and
therefore he brings into straights.

4. Reas. Because God would discover wicked men: Before he brings his great
salvation, he would discover those that are vile and wicked, that they should
not partake of that great salvation: As in our times, we know how God in every
straight we have been in has made some useful discovery to us, it has been a
discovering time, of many that we have known to be vile and naught, that we did
not know before: Luke, 2.35. (you know the place) A sword shall pierce through
thy soul, why? that the thoughts of many may be discovered: there shall be
great afflictions and troubles, and the end I aim at is, to discover the
thoughts of many: How have men's thoughts been discovered by plots? when God was
bringing his people into Canaan he would not have a rebellious generation come
in among them; and all the trouble they had in the wilderness, it was by a
mixture of a base and vile generation, that you have plain in Number. 11. when
they were in such a distressed condition, and in a murmuring and a vexing way,
mark the 4. verse, The mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting: They
disturbed all the host of God: And certainly if men should not be discovered,
more than they are, if God should come to set up a full reformation amongst us
herein England, to bring us to that Canaan we desire, we should be so troubled
with a mixed multitude, the mixed multitude would so vex and trouble the Church
of God, that they should scarce ever have peace among themselves; and therefore
God in mercy will discover them beforehand, before Canaan comes he will
discover this mixed multitude.

5. Rea. God will bring them into straits, because he might give occasion to
the Adversary to vent his malice to the utmost, and to ripen his sin that it
may be ripe to the full, before God comes to deliver us; that they may be
gathered together to be a great sacrifice to the Lord, therefore Gods people
are brought to such straights; that if they will blaspheme, they shall blaspheme
to the full. In our times now, the more straights we are brought into, the
greater are the blasphemies of the wicked, and if God should bring us into more
straights, and give them the better over us, I believe there will be that
horrible blasphemy in England, that never was in any place in the world, the
heavens never did hear, nor the earth never did bear such blasphemies, and
blasphemers, as there would be, if God should but deliver up his people in any
degree to the hands of their enemies; we know not, but for the ripenning of
their sins, and that so they may come to be remarkable for Gods vengance on
them here in this world, God may give them power over his people, and bring his
people yet into greater straights. And then the last reason is,

(6. Reas) Because the work of Jesus Christ will more appear at the last, the
greater the straight is; And therefore in Dan. 9.25. He will build up the City
even in troublesome times. Every one can build in quiet times, but in troubled
times Christ will build up the City: And he rules in the midst of his enemies:
Christ loves to rule in the midst of his enemies, that so his rule may be the
more conspicuous.

1. Use, Is it so with us? Take heed then that we have not our hearts sinck,
because of straights: Let us not say, why is it thus with us? If God be in a
way of mercy, why deals he thus with us? and presently be ready to conclude
against the ways of God; certainly all is gone, God is gone, surely whatsoever
the hopes and confidences of such and such were, we see all is undone, all
their hopes are undone. God forbid there should be such an unbeleeving heart in
any of you, or such murmuring and repining speeches among any of you,
whatsoever straight you are brought into!

2 Doct. In these straights, Gods people are mightily troubled. It was so here,
in every straight they repined, and were in a distraction, and especially at
this time; stand still (says Moses,) what mean you to do? They were all in a
confusion; and as it was there, so it is many times in many of Gods Saints. As
the blessed man Heman, that made that 88. Psalm, you shall find in that Psalm,
he was distracted; and yet though Heman was one of the wisest men upon the
earth, for so you shall find it in the 1. of Kings, (where the holy Ghost
speaks of wise men) in 4.31. Solomon did exceed the wisdom of all in Egypt,
for (says the text) he was wiser than all men, than Heman, and yet Heman was
in woeful perplexity, when he was brought into straights. And in the 8. of
Isaiah, It was the same case there, that seems to be ours now; Oh there was a
Confederacy, a Confederacy, and many people did join together against Gods
servants, and upon that (the text says) in the 11. verse, The Lord spoke to me
with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
people saying, say ye not, A Confederacy to all them to whom this people shall
say, A Confederacy, neither fear ye their fear. Mark, God was fain to speak to
the Prophet with a strong hand, that he should not be so troubled, as other
people were in the time of their fears. Yea we shall find, that many of Gods
Saints, that he has delivered in a most glorious way, yet at some other times
they have been too secure, their hearts have bin all in a confusion, and were
not able to stand before the difficulties that they met withal: And for that
you have a famous example, 1 Kings, 19. of Elijah; if you read the 18. Chap.
you may see what a Spirit Elijah had, he would appear before Ahab, As the Lord
of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show my self to him, to day,
(to Ahab:) and he did show himself to Ahab, and tells him, it was he and his
people, that troubled Israel, when Ahab said to him, Art thou he that troubles
Israel, No (says he) It is thou, and thy fathers house that troubles Israel:
And then he comes and gets the Priests of Baal together, and gets fire from
heaven, to consume the Sacrifice, and destroies all the Priests of Baal: and
gets rain from heaven to rain upon the earth: What an excellent Spirit had
Elijah in the 18 Chapter? Yet in the 19. Chapter, Jezabel did but threaten
Elijah, and he takes himself to his heels, and runs away at the threatening of
wicked Jezabel; though he had such a brave Spirit in the former Chapter: So it
is truly with many men, at some time their courage makes their adversaries
afraid, and at other times, their cowardice makes their friends ashamed; many
have been so, they have been a terror to their adversaries one day, and a shame
to their friends another day.

Reas. 1. Because we have much flesh still in the best of us all, and we are
much led by sense; and because we are not thoroughly skilful in the ways of
God, because the fear of God is so weak in us, therefore it is that the fear of
man is so strong, and therefore we know so little of Gods secrets; the secrets
of God are with them that fear him, did we fear God more we should know his
secret ways, and not be so much troubled.

Reas. 2. Because there is a great deal of guilt rests in the best, and that
will make any one afraid; where there is much guiltiness in their hearts, it is
exceeding troublesome to the soul.

Reas. 3. Because they are too to confident in the flesh, they are too to
confident in themselves, Thence it is that God withdraws himself from them; and
at what time they are afraid, they cannot trust in God, as David (it is an
admirable sweet text) professes of himself, That at what time he was afraid, he
would trust in God: There is many a man that for the present thinks he can
trust in God, but he cannot do it at that time when he is afraid: Psalm. 56.3.
What time I am afraid, I will trust in the Lord. When your passion comes, then
you make no use of your faith, to trust in God: As now, many a man or woman can
be meek and quiet, till they have a temptation, but when your passion is up,
can you be meek then? and rise then, and beat it down with the contrary grace?
So when the passion of your fears and troubles come up, can you then trust in
God? I, that is somewhatlike; but because we trust so much in our selves,
therefore when the time comes we should trust in God, God withdraws himself
from us, and we are most afraid.

Use. This is that we should lay our hands upon our hearts, and charge our
souls for, and be ashamed for before the Lord: Never a one here but has cause
to lay his hand upon his heart and say, Oh that I, that have had so much
experience of God, of his ways of helping and delivering me, out of six
troubles and seven, and yet the Lord knows upon any new trouble I am to seek as
much as ever, and in any hurly-burly in as great distemper of fear as ever; be
ashamed of this before the Lord. It is true, Gods people may be so, and you are
so, therefore be ashamed of it, and labor to prepare for such times; those
that are troubled with fainting fits, use to carry their bottle of Aqua-vitae
about with them; so you that have been disquieted in times of trouble, lay up
somewhat that may help in those times. Though a candle light will serve to
carry in a yard in calm weather, yet it must be a torch, a great light that
must serve when the wind blows; so a little may serve now, but a great deal
must be laid up for times of extremity.

First, Lay up encouraging Promises.

Secondly, Lay up encouraging experiences, that may help you against such times
of fainting and trouble.

Use 2. But then, if it be so with the Saints and Gods own people, that when
they are in straights, they are so ready to be troubled with distracting fears
and cares, what shall become of the wicked and ungodly then? when they come in
straights, how must their hearts sink in horror, because all their straights
are no other, but the beginning of eternal straights? present sorrows making
away to eternal sorrows, the way of their deliverance from present straights
is, by being brought into greater straights: many women with child have strong
pains in their child birth, yet when they think they shall be delivered, they
have joy in stead of sorrow; but a woman that is with child, and is only
reprieved because she is with child, till she be delivered, though she have a
great deal of trouble and pain before she be delivered, she desires not to be
rid of it, because then she knows she shall come to greater, to be hanged, and
if she could live seven years together and never be delivered, she could be
content with the trouble, because when that is gone, greater comes: So wicked
and ungodly men that are in great straights for the present, may well be
content with them, because when they are gone, greater will come.

3. Doct. In the time of these straights, it is our duty, to stand still and
look for Gods salvation, to quiet our spirits, and look up to God.

First, For the quieting of our spirits.

As they were to be delivered out of this bondage in that way; so they were to
be delivered out of the Babilonish bondage in the same way: So you shall find
it Isa. 30. see what God says for that deliverence, he tells them plainly at
the 15. verse. In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength, and you
would not: In quietness and confidence, it is true, they were in a passionat
way, and God tells them, that in quietness and in confidence is their strength,
and they would not: So, come to many people that are in great extremities, to
some women and others, (when they are wringing their hands, and hanging about
their husbands necks) and tell them, your confidence must be in quietness, they
will be ready to row you off. But they would not (says God) So in Isa. 30.7. I
cried concerning this, Their strength is, to sit still: My Brethren, this day
in the Name of God, do I cry concerning al our straights, after we have used
all the means we can, we are to sit still, and see the salvation of our God, to
quiet our hearts with this believing stand still, and look up to God for our
salvation. It was their great fault, they did not so in their deliverance out
of their captivity, there is one remarkable place for that Jer. 31.22. How long
will thou go about? Oh thou backsliding daughter! for the Lord has created a
new thing in the earth: How long will thou go about, Oh thou backsliding
daughter? What Is the meaning of this text? It is thus, In the time of their
deliverance from Captivity, they met with a great deal of difficulty, many
straights, and they went about to this and that sharking course, and did
backslide, when they were in a good way, they went back again, and the Prophet
could not get the^ (...) stand still (...) any way; as if he should have said,
go on right in the way, be not discouraged; by difficulties, by extremities,
seck not any shifting way, be not backsliding, but stand to your tackling and
work God has set you about, for the Lord has created a new thing; Perhaps you
will say, there was never the like straight we are in; well, God has such
mercy as he never showed the like before; God has created a new thing; many
cry out in their straights, O my affliction, and my straitght is such as never
was in the world! well, gratify them so; (as many times, we must needs
gratify distempered spirits, when they cry out of the greatness of their
straights) yet is there no comfort for them to stay them? yes, Isa. 64.4. It
was never known since the beginning of the world, what God has laid up for
them that wait for him: Do but wait for him, and there was never such mercy
shown in the world, as God has laid up for thee; so that come let us grant it,
that there was never the like of that affliction that thou art under, yet there
is reason enough for thee to wait, and look for the salvation of God, in such a
way, in such a condition.

I shall give some reasons of that part of the doctrine, that we are to stand
still, and be quiet: for by our standing still, and our quieting our hearts in
our straights,

1. Reas, We are fit to look to the Wisdom, Faithfulness, and Power of God; we
are not able to see Gods Wisdom, Faithfulness, and Power, nor to make use of
it, except we get our spirits to be quiet: first get them quiet, and then we
can look up to God, Psalm, 46.10. Be still (says the text) and know that I am
God, there is a God in Heaven that can help and succor, in time of great
straights and extremities, but for all this, people are in a hurly-burly, and
their spirits are distempered, and they are wringing their hands, and crying,
they cannot know that God is God, they can have no use of all the power and
goodness, and faithfulness, and mercy of God. First get your hearts still and
quiet in your Families, and in your own spirits, and then you shall know that
God is God: God will not appear till first you be still.

2. Reas. We are not able to make use of our own Graces, till we be quiet and
still; If God have bestowed Graces when we are in a hurly-burly, we have no use
of them at all; therefore says the text, Psalm, 4. Stand in awe, sin not,
commune with your own hearts upon your beds, and be still: Commune with your
own hearts: you have somewhat (perhaps) in your own hearts that may quiet you;
commune with your own hearts, and be still; you are not fit to commune with
your own hearts till you get them quiet; first be quiet, and then commune: (Oh!
my brethren) A man or woman of a staid, sound, quiet, and still spirit, has a
mighty advantage of all passionate spirits; there are many of you, that are
passionate at all other times, and that is the reason that in such great
extremities, you are so overrul'd with passion; you are so overruled with your
passion of anger at other times, and out of Gods just judgment, you are
overruled with the passion of Fear now: But if at other times you would labor
to keep in your spirits, God would help you now.

3. Reas. Because without this stilness, and quietness, we cannot manifest that
subjection to God we owe him; for then there is a great deal of sin, and pride,
and stoutness committed against God; and therefore in that fourth Psalm, the
old Latin has it My soul be silent; my soul is subject to God; the subjection
of our souls to God, depends much upon this Quieting of our hearts.

4. Reas. Our reverence of God depends much upon it: and therefore in this 4.
Psalm, Stand in aw and sin not, commune with your own heart, and be still: for
us to behave our selves in such a manner as many people do, throwing out their
hands, and wringing, and keeping such a stir as they do; this shows there is
not in their hearts that reverence they owe to God; stand in awe; If your
hearts were possessed with Gods fear, you would not keep such a stir as you do
in times of great danger.

5. Reas. This makes people unfit to listen to any thing that is spoken to
them; let any thing be spoken to them, that is of any use, they eannor hear it,
nor make use of it; as we read of the people of Israel, Exodus 6.9. when Moses
came to tell them of their deliverance, the text says, He spoke to the
Children of Israel, but they hearkened not to him: why? for anguish of spirit:
How many in trouble of conscience, and in other times of extremity, have their
spirits in such anguish, that they never hearken to any thing that is delivered
to them; and therefore they come with the same objection over and over again, a
hundred times in cases of conscience.

6. Without this Quietness of spirit, you are mighty hinderers of others, and
you daunt and discourage the hearts of others, and many times the cause
miscarries merely upon the unquietness of the hearts of men and women in time
of danger; therefore you must be quiet, and look up to God for salvation; for
Faith has this excellency, that it is able to bring life out of death, light
out of darkness; it has a kind of creating virtue; as God himself brings one
contrary out of another, so faith has such a kind of working, if faith be of
the right stamp, a genuine faith, it has a mighty power in times of extremity
to behold Gods salvation, and make use of it: I Will give you one example of the
use of faith in times of extremity; and that is of David, when he fled from
Saul, and when he was in the Cave; mark, Be merciful to me O God, be merciful
to me, for my soul trusts in thee, yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I
make my refuge. What was the shadow of Gods wings? poor David was got into the
shadow of the Cave, and the Sun did not shine upon him, but he looked upon
himself in the Cave, as under the shadow of Gods wings: You poor people that
live it may be in Cellers, and in poor dark holes and Lanes, the Sun scarce
shines upon you in a year, yet if you be godly, you are under Gods wings by
faith.

I shall now speak to the Second part of the Doctrine that we are to expect
Salvation from God.

David did fly from Absalom, and yet what confidence had David (in that case)
in God? read but that third Psalm, and you will see confidence enough in David,
and yet flying too: Diverse grounds and reasons I shall give for this, why we
must look up to God, as well as be still:

Rea. Hereby we sanctify Gods Name; Fear ye not their fear, but sanctify God
in your hearts (says the text.) You sanctify not God else: I suppose many of
you would be loath to be guilty of swearing, and taking Gods Name in vain in
that kind, but by your distracting thoughts, and unbeseeming carriage in times
of danger, you take Gods Name in vain, you break the third Commandment.

2. Rea. This shows the beauty and excellency of Faith, as David said, Thou
shall see what thy servant can do: So now, there is a great deal of talk of
faith in the world, let us see now what it can do; the truth of love is, when I
can love God for himself without his gifts; so when I can believe in God
without experience, I show the excellency of my faith, when I can trust in God
merely upon his word; as I love God merely for himself, when my faith taks Gods
single bond without any security, that is the excellency of Faith; when I would
have outward helps and assurances, there I call for sureties: So Christians
when they must needs have outward helps, and former experiences, they call to
God for sureties, as if they would not trust God upon his simple bond; that is
the excellency of faith to trust God upon his single bond.

3. Rea. When we look up to God for salvation, we engage God in our cause; God
owns not the cause till then, and then he owns it: Now how happy were we, if
thus we could do in all our particular and private straights, stand still and
look up to God for help and for salvation: It Is true, you cry out and complain,
I have lost a dear husband, and a dear friend, never man lost such a friend,
and these great straights I am brought into; but lose not the quiet of thy
heart too, take heed of that, that is a greater loss than any loss thou can
have in this world. I remember I have read of a Philosopher that had this
expression, (says he) If the gods would grant to me my desire, and bid me ask
what I would have, I would ask of them this thing, that I might have the
composed spirit of Socrates, that I might have such a spirit as Socrates had;
for it is observed of him, that he did scarce change his countenance upon any
thing that befell him, he was always in a quiet composed frame, (and yet a
Heathen;) How much more should a Christian say; If God would give me my asking,
I would ask nothing but that; for indeed there is a great deal of glory and
excellency in a composed spirit: this is worthy of the Gospel; therefore mark
what the Apostle says, Phil. 1.27. Only let your conversation be as it
becomes the Gospel of Christ, that whether I come to see you, or be absent
from you, I may hear of your affairs and that you stand fast in one spirit:
This is to walk worthy of the Gospel, to stand fast in one spirit: and observe
this, that except we do stand fast, and quiet our hearts, we lose every thing
that should help us: when we are in a hurly-burly in our spirits to get some
help, alas, we lose all our help: Therefore in Phil. 4. Let the peace of God
keep your hearts, the word in the Original is, Guard your hearts; The peace of
God in your hearts, must be the best guard of your hearts in the time of
danger, now because you would avoid trouble, you put away your guard, what a
madness is this? the casting away the peace of God, is the casting away of
your guard, therefore keep that in your hearts, whatsoever you lose; yea, it is
our Arms, mark, Ephesians. 6. what is the Arms of a Christian? first, The girdle of
truth, fear dissolves the heart, and makes a man he cannot gird himself: When
he is in fear, his heart is melted, and he has little use of his truth, the
girdle is loosed then; In the text, there is the helmet of salvation, but in
fear hope is gone; there is the brestplate of righteousness, but in fear, a man
has no use of his righteous conversation, nor no use of the sword of the
Spirit, he can use nothing in times of such distracting fears, therefore lose
not your Arms: It is very observable, in the 6. of the Ephesians. how the holy
Ghost still calls upon us to stand, verse 10. My brethren be strong in the Lord,
and not only strong, But strong in the Lord, and strong in the might of the
Lord, and in the power of his might; put on the whole armor of God, that you
may be able to stand; then again, in the 13. verse, Wherefore take ye all the
whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand the evil one, and having
done all, ^o stand: Though perhaps, you have overcome at one time, yet still
look to your own hearts, when you have done all, stand, four times we are
called upon to stand, nothing, what a great advantage we have by standing; It Is
true, our afflictions are great, and the soul says, The Lord is my portion:
perhaps temptations and afflictions say otherwise, but the soul says, The Lord
is my portion; and it is good for a man to say, what shall I that am so full of
sin, yet not be willing to have some trouble, but be so full of fears upon
every trouble that befalls me? why should not I yield to Gods providential will
as well as to his commanding will? how know I, but that God may have glorious
ends, to work out of these extremities and troubles I am in? why should I not
give up my self to God, to have his will upon me? and has not God heretofore
delivered me from great straights and extremities, even from the wrath of God
himself, and from his justice? greater and other manner of straights than those
I am now in; and if I believe not in God now, but be disquieted, perhaps these
straights may be to bring me to greater straights; what if these straights of
affliction should bring me to greater straights? and it is just with God to
leave me to fall into the straights of sin, that cannot bear the straights of
afflictions, therefore let me stand still and look up to Gods salvation; Let us
be so affected with our straights as to carry us up to God in prayer: pray as
much as ye can, but still keep your hearts in a quiet frame; and if your
prayers be right, they will be to you, as Luther says, they were the leeches
of his cares; Luther had a great many corrupt cares, (as in a corrupt body,
there is much corrupt blood) but now his prayers were the leeches to suck out
his cares: when you are distempered, go to prayer, and then examine what a deal
of corrupt blood has my prayers sucked out of my heart? As Hannah, when she had
been at prayer, she looked no more sad. There are many things I thought to have
given you, to slay your hearts in time of extremities: Peace shall be to that
man, that has his heart stayed on God, and blessed is that man that stays
his heart upon God: and if ever people had cause to stay their hearts upon God,
certainly we have at this day, for we have God with us; Therefore it is unworthy
of a Christian to have a distempered spirit. I remember I have read of the
Romans, that when Hannibal was just before them, yet they bought and sold their
ground as they did at other times; they were so quiet in their hearts. It was a
speech that Antigonor had, when some were afraid of the multitude that came
against him, (say they) So many are coming against us, says he, How many do
you reckon me for? So may we say, we hear of so many thousands coming against
us; But how many do you reckon Jesus Christ for? How many reckon you him for,
that is the Captain of all our Hosts: Have not prayers been sent up to God? Why
despise you the prayers of the Saints of God, as if there were nothing in their
prayers? Is not Gods Name engaged in all this business? Oh therefore stand
still and be not afraid: And especially let me speak a word to you, that are of
timorious and fearful spirits, Isa. 35.4. Say to them that are of a fearful
heart, Fear not: Do not excuse your selves in this, that you are of a timorious
nature; (says God) Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Fear not: And
especially mark what the holy Ghost speaks to women, In 1 Pet. 3. Women they
must cloth themselves with a meek and quiet spirit, (that is in the 4. verse)
which is in the sight of God of great price, and in the 6. verse, And as Sarah
obeyed Abraham, and called him Lord, whose daughters ye are, as long as you do
well, and are not afraid of any amazment: What should be the meaning of that,
that woman must be the daughters of Sarah upon these terms? Thus, Abraham was
brought into straights many times, and carried from his own Country; now Sarah
if she had been of such a spirit as many women are, Oh how would Sarah have
hindered her husband Abraham in every straight he was brought into? and have
said, Husband, why go we from our own Country, and our friends, and so are
brought into such straights? pray husband go back again, and venture not your
self thus and thus: but it seems she was of a gracious spirit, and quieted her
self in God, and was not afraid with amazement: If you would approve your
selv's the daughters of Sarah, do ye so, when God calls your husbands to any
service, though it be with some hazard, do not you hang about their necks, and
wring your hands, and say, I beseech you husband consider what will become of
me and my children, will you leave me now? Take heed, you are not the daughters
of Sarah at such a time, if you hinder your husbands at such a time as this is.

4. Doct. That the sight of salvation after straights, will be a glorious
thing. If we be brought into straights, that that is coming will pay for all,
there is enough to satisfy; let us not be troubled at greater straights, than
yet we have; Suppose blood should be shed (beloved) God has such mercy for
England, that shall pay for all the blood of his Saints that shall be shed; and
the blood of his people, is a precious thing: Every drop of the blood of his
people is very precious; and the Adversary shall be accomptable for every drop;
God will value it, and there shall be a valuable consideration given for every
drop of blood; and the more difficulties we have in obtaining that mercy God is
about to give us, the mercy shall be the greater: Isa. 54.11. O thou afflicted
and tossed with tempests, thy foundations shall be laid with Saphires, and with
precious stones. If we be afflicted and tossed with tempests, and the blood of
Gods people go for it; comfort your selves with this; The more precious blood
that is shed in this business, the greater mercy is to come, for God will have
a valuable consideration for all the blood of his Saints.
