To the Honorable the Lords and Commons now assembled in the High Court of
Parliament.
The humble Petition of the University of Cambridge
HUmbly presents to your Honorable consideration the sad dejected estate of
the said University: How our Schools daily grow desolate, mourning the absence
of their Professors and the wonted Auditories: How in our Colleges our
numbers grow thin, and our Revenues short, and that subsistence we have
abroad is for the most: part involved in the common miseries: How frighted by
the neighbor noise of War, our Students either quit their Gowns or abandon
their Studies: How our Degrees lie disesteemed, and all hopes of our public
Commencement are blasted in the bud besides sundry other pressing
inconveniences which We forbear to mention.

We cannot but conceive your Honorable piety (out of a Noble zeal to Learning)
will cordially pity our sad condition, and (as the present general calamities
give way) afford us some succor and encouragement. Your Wisdoms best: know
what Privileges and Immunities have been in all good times afforded to the
seats of Learning, and the Professors of it; and even in the fury and heat of
War, places of Religion and Devotion have usually not only (on both sides)
been spared from ruin, but supported, and esteemed as Sanctuaries. Hence is it
that the Members of our University (by Charter confirmed by Act of Parliament,)
stand expressly freed from all preparations and contributions to War: Hence is
it, that in neighbor Territories, where the Excise is most: in use, the
Universities with all their Students are exempt.

May it not therefore be displeasing to your pious wisdoms, if in all humility
we crave at your hands a tender commiseration of our case, that you will be
pleased to exempt our poor estates from all such Rates and Impositions; to
vouchsafe such freedom to our persons (not giving just offense) as may enable
us the better to keep together and daily to offer up our joint prayers to God
for a blessed union betwixt our Gracious Sovereign and you, and the blessing
of peace upon the Land.

This came forth about ye beginnings of March 1643.
