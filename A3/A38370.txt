I Conceive shall greatly expected Treaty vulle put nour present state^ of
affairs (...) a prudential Balance, place in th^ls Presbyterians in one scale;
one the (...) In^^^^ ^^dents in an other to ^rutinate and try quich is thel
more poy^ant or pre^^erant, so to discover quich dofe 'em severally, vulle
finally stand or fall, (...) Royal Party standein in a sort, only is
spectators to cast in leyr. gra^nes into (...) one, or thel other part dofe
thel pe^ghts or weights, as ley vee, or see cause. (...) thel Independent
Combination exceedes thel Presbyterian Faction, in (...) grains (...) degrees,
py^^or by reason ley^ Arrive has almax^ or almost alm^ (...) or all in its
power. Yet vould I not have thels Royalists or thel Cavallears to cast^ any
grains into thel Presbyterian seal, for pyr thist, ley vulle so much eleva^^
and levighten thel Independent seal as it vulle finally redounde to thels
Cavallear soune destruction in case thels Presbyterians prevail pyr leyr
additional conjunction: or at minst and at least, thels Cavallears pyr leyr
superadditional poyse, vull^ leashe or leave thel Balance in silch or such an
equilibrie, as vulle only serve (...) continue, and not to compose nour
sanguinarie combustions and disnatural Debates* Now I perceive His Moderate
Matie is content to exclude thel Scots and treat avi^^ 'em apart (as sum
months passed I propounded to his serious consideration in my^ Mercurius
Moderatus) quich sure vulle greatly facilitate his peaceable Restorement, if
anithient vulle mollify his refractorie subjects minds; or if possiblely
reconcilable one com another; quich now I really apprebende as thel greatel^
difficulty impeditive to a firmly foundationed Accommodation, so many
opposed Factionaries (especially in Religionarie affairs) sieing or bieing
morally impossibilitated to meet in one, quich in substance in my fundamental
reason movein me greatly to doubt (yet not to despair) dofe a sufficiently
mutual concordancie. Yet if only so tractable ley fere, were as every
adversely contendei^ Party vould or would in sum rational measure cede or
yield leyr Reights, so^ sam or am able to apprehende it effectible: especially
if ley vould almne unanimously conspite in admittein leyr Sovereigne Prince for
leyr unical Vinculun Pacis, ot ultimate Umpiere, and supreme Arbitrator. For if
ley rejecte 'im, the^ley liniunt absque temperatura, ley daube senze mortar:
and so leyr labors and edifiremain exposed to fall pyr by every flast of
veind; so as accordein to thel judicious Tacitus in a sembleable case, Non
aliud discordantis Reipublica restabat remedium quam vt ab uno regeretur. For,
as glorious S, Cyprian (not much diffrently to thist masme or same purpose)
verse reightly instructs us, Vnitas ab unconsurgit, Unity naturally resulteth
dofe one; namely one supreme Governo^ or Superior: Thist now tou clearly and
costly experience has doughte us, since (...) long as almn or all thel subjects
continued united subter one Monarchic^ Sovereigne, and affected noe new
Masters, ley passed in peace, plenty, and quietnes^ quen as now ever since sum
studious dofe Novelties and Innovations excussed thi^^ sweet yoke dofe
obedience and subordination, ley suffer silch miseries and oppressions as vulle
yet daily increase and multiply into a total desolation (sum peu or fev^^ only
excepted quoe subsiste per thel ruins dofe others) if not opportunely
prevented, pyr^un uniforme agreement in thist due subordination quich is thel
prime^ and price pally n^cessarie Principle for Peace, let us then have thist,
and cetera omnia adjicientur nobis, thel rest vulle subsecute and foloe.
Contrarily, if nee we cemente not thel and structure dofe nour so much labored
for Pacification, per a submissive aduinculation to nour supreme angular lapid
or stone, it vulle prove no^ firmer then discemented bries quich let in corrupt
air dofe Differences and Divi^^^ to a notable disturbance dofe reciprocel
Peace and A ^^nistie intrcene, id est, (...) ween one subject and another, in
relation to l^yr common Soyereigne and su^^^me Ruler.

(...) vould have thels Cavalleares to ciste in for ileyr o^ their parts a
double grain (...) more into thel more preponderatein scale for Peace. One in
move in his Maje^^^ alone (for thel Scots regard not thist present
Parliamental Convention) Publi^^ly to declare thels Scots Rebels in case ley
vulle not retracte leyr Army, and cease to invade and caterpille nour Coun
tie; as formerly he proclaimed 'em them and leyr Covenant Rebellious, at leyr
precedent entrance, quen invited pyr thels then Presbyterian Parliamenters. Yet
let not thels Royalists in any case suffer thels Levellers to cast any one
grain into thel pu^l que B^llince; for iley'r or they will revolve and spoil
tore, anc so ley vulle totully pertur bate nour pacifyein Tractation to equalle
almne to leyr soune or own new phansies, as even at thist present plainlyer
than ever, appears pyr leyr newly published ^x^ravagant Petition presented to
thel Parliamental Assemblye. So for avoydance dofe perturbation and procreation
dofe a new guarre or war, and tore perteinein to new Combustions, special
care is adhibende or to bie adhibited and used, ley meddle not in thel rule
dofe nour prementioned Balance, minst, or least ley turn tote topsie turvie.

Cavalleares I name lem, not Knights; quich appellation is now so odious as I
vould have it for thel future totally abolished, exceptein only for Knights
o'th Post, and only thel more glorious Title dofe Cavalleare used as more
consorant to loy altie and obedience to leyr Sovereigne, quoe conferres 'em
thist honor, not to others quoe have so ingrately opposed 'im.

Another grain I vould advyse thel Royalists cautiously to put in thel
Balance, namely concernein Religion, in propoundein to thel Reingues or Kings
Majesty ajoynt com or with his Parliamental Commissioners, to establishe a
general liberty for exercise dofe almne considerable Professions in Religion,
even thel Papists Profession tou; blasphemous Heresies only excepted. For if
thist gracious Indult is not generally conceded and granted, and thel Scotch
Covenant either quyte dissolved, or greatly moderated, I profess I sam not
able to conceive any constant Accommodation, in regard if one only Party
dofe so many dissentein Dictamens in Religion, totally prevail as superior to
almne others, thel rest vulle remain in continual discontent, anc opposein
reluctance, so never reconcilable subter or under one only Form dofe
Government in Religionarie affairs, as perpetually timorizein either
precedently inflicted, or new infligend, and infligeable oppressions per thels
predominant Rulers, so as ley vulle never desiste to machinate mischiess to
thel notable perturbance dofe thel State, anc spititual anc temporal Government
a joint.

Vrue or true it is, Unity anc Conformity in Religion quen senze great
inconveniencie it is possible to sie or bie had, is a principal producer anc
fomenter (...) Peace even in temporal Regimen: Yet quen so many preseminated
discordan^ Errors anc Heresies continually pullulate, to contend for
preeminencie in an^ Protestant particular or single Profession more than in
another, is to sake or make an overture to perpetual dissentions.

To quich incommoditie one M. Farrar, (quose Propositions for Peace an^ Safety.
fare or are more rational anc tractable then any I have yet viewed or perused,)
very prudently alludein, judiciously, and considerately affirms; A happy
settlement vulle or Will never be in thist Kingdom, unless great care be had
ofe tende^ consciences, so numerous they are so just their pretense, etc. Out
of quich numbe^ as I probablely collect pyr sum other his passages, he vould
not have even Papis^ excepted, as reightly reflectein to thels dangerous
Sequiles quich vould result dofe thel negation dofe so rational a concession as
in reallitie (leyr greater Antiquity and ancient possission peculiarly
pondered,) silch an exception, neither policy, nor Religion, no nor common, or
mutual humanity vould ever approve; especially ley havein noe longue time
passed, exhibited so satislactorie assurance for leyr future Loyalty an^
temporal Allegiance to thel present State, as fas conse^ sedly pyr ilose those
to quome it fas or was offered, abundantly sufficient. To (...) confirmation
dofe quich if it sart sie or shall be required, ley vulle more sover o^ more
over, procure leyr chief Pastor the^ Papes public Engagement to suspende
almne coactive exercise dofe his accustomed Power, inithel Reingdome dofe
Angland, quich his interposeive, an^ mediative obligement vulle even alone
sufficiently anc supersufficiently abolishe almne suspicion, anc danger dofe
distutbance to thel public Peace in thels Roman Professors. So let 'em in
reason anc Christian piety injoye sum tolerable liberty in thel exercise dofe
loyr Religion, at thel minst, or at the least per a favorable Composition as
long or as far as leyr poor ability anc possibility vulle extend.

Ey sure thel contrary fere were great impietye in a time anc opportunitye, in
quich it plainly appears, in a manner almn people generally conspyre in a
rationally expected gracious Indult or Concession dofe his moderate Majestye,
and Parliamental concurrence for thel ease dofe tender Consciences; in quich
(as have (...) tenderly endured so long anc tedious molestations) Roman
Catholics, m^xt justly request to have leyr proportion. Conform to quich
charitable favor let one grain more sie or bie superadded to thel former,
namely quat that noe Juraments or Oaths, or other silch Engagements sie or be
enforced to any dofe thels subjects consciences, more than mearely to secure
leyr temporal Allegiance, since indubiously thel contrary vould greatly averte
thels minds dofe many tender conscientioned people derom or from almne
peaceable Atonement, anc amiable R^conciliation.

Anc I incidently observe as pyr ilose so great anc irreconcilable difference
anc ^^^rial Divisio^s, Sects and Factions in Religion super comemmored no
Pro^estant ^^^fesser judicious anc tender dofe his eternal salvation is not
greatly moved either to renounce or at thel minst to doubt his Profession is
not ilat one Religion quich Deod as Deus pacis and non dissentionis exactes
dofe us. So contrarily noe ^eniated anc judicious Roman Catholic is not
greatly confirmed ey an^ com^^ted in his Faith and Religion quen he
contemplates thel infinite mercy dofe ^^^od in his deliverance dout dofe silch a
foul chaos an^ confusion; an^ in his ad^^ittance for a Member dofe his soune
quiet an^ peaceable Congregation.

Finally, let thel loyal and honest part dofe thels Independent Combination,
^^ch desire leyr Sovereigns honorous Restoration, put as much poyse as ley
they please into thel Royal scale, and so thels Royalists enter in into an
amiablely ^^^ual Conjunction, it vulle sufficiently serve to recover his facred
Majesty's R^yal Reights, Person, and Honor not obsistein tote thel opposition
thels other Fastions sure able to prosecute, and derom or from quome is thel
Reingue or Kings Majesty in reason to exspect his deliverance save only pyr
or by ilem or them qube have ^m actually in leyr custody, and quoe in a great
measure possess thel tole or whole power dofe his Reingdome, anc or and dofe
his Anglish Domitions; I intend and mean thel Royal Independents, for thel
popular or levellein I^dependents, (as clearly is discoverd in leyr new
Petition dated Sep. 11. 1648.) have a Project to render thels Representative
Commons nour supreme Governers, anc to transverte thel accustomed Form dofe
Regimen established pyr thels anciently established Laws dofe thist
Monarchical Realm, quich leyr Peti^ on in my dictamen is partly founded in
groasse ignorance; partly almnso in a licklein and puriginous affect dofe
noveltie, and change, and partly in an incapacitie to distinguishe original and
formal Authority. For in reallitie supreme Power is only originally in thels
legally established Laws quich, (as even common sense suggestes) are not
repealeable, save only pyr thel masme Authority pyr quich ley fere or were
inacted, so ley sare not annulleable, or changeable pyr thels Commons alone,
quoe pyr lemselps had not power derived to 'em pyr thel represented Reingdome
to constitue silch Laws; mut pyr thel Reingdome, ^omnes or Lords and Commons a
joint, quoe in leyr several degrees concurred to I^yr est ablishment. Thist
convinces my judgment and rationally moves me to estieme thel very foundation
dofe thel prementioned Petition for erroneously false jointly in Law and
Reason. Cavete a stater a falsa. Thels Authors dofe thist perniciously cross
Petition and false Baliance sare ilose Catabibazonists quich corrupt nour now
favorable Constellation, for Union, Concord anc Peace. To quich touchein for
removal dofe present obstacles; peculiarly tonchein Retractations for
sangfusions or bloodshed, thel only easy Atonement vulle prove Solomon's
Counsels: nec mihi nec tibi, sed dividatur.

I vould not have his Moderate Majesty proceed prodigally in his
Condescensions, for peradventure quen ilose quoe have 'im now in agitation anc
baitein, br^^ atteined leyr desires, sum others vulle set fresh dogs at 'im,
namely thels Leve lers, or Levellein Independents.

For an ultimate conclusion, let thel City put one only grain in thel one or
other seal, vidolicet, firmly to resolve, never to contribute to a renewed
qua^^ or War, mut or but only to an amiable pacification: For indubitablely
thist (...) prove the strongest staff to beat thels refractorie Factions into
a peaceable Accommodation. Let us thens diligently apply nour maxt or most
humb^^ Petitions anc Supplications to thel divine Majesty, as to thel pryme
Motor a^ Moderater dofe almne, so to mollifye, direct, and guide thels minds
and intention dofe thels Tractators, and Transactors, to applyc leyr extremest
indevors, and for^ for every part and party in thels Subjects to receive a
satisfactorie content and con^^ fort. For consecution dofe quich special
Benediction and gracious favor, let us it stantiously solicit, and daily
supplicate for a legal and uniforme Procedure in th^^ and almne other future
Parliaments, for nour gracious Sovereign, his Royal Consort, and Issues
honorous Restorement to leyr precedently enjoyed Estates and Conditions,
Parliament and People to leyr formerly accustomed Privileges etc. (...) thel
prenamed Gentlehamn M. Farrar in his Propositions for Peace and Safeti^ very
piously and rationously suggestes touchein thist and diverse other particular^
Only I marvelle he is so confident in affirmein or supposein an other new
Parliament vulle not have Power to annulle thels decrees inacted in thist
present Parliamentatie Assemblye, since in my Dictamen, noe Juraments, Oaths,
or any other Engagements have force to oblige in thist nature any other suture
legally procredein Parliaments quich vulle contain other new Members, nor fare
or are ye^ in existence or essence.

One I cognosce, and perfectly knoe, quome I refuse to nominate, quoe if in
case he had thel Balance in his rule anc guidance, he vould so moderately
order thels scales dofe affairs as vould infalliblely render thels Subjects
felicious and happy in leyr temporal conditions and estates. He vould so
equally balance and ponderate thels severally dissentein Parties causes
(prudently ponderein 'em as equally disputeable at thel minst,) as in reason
and equity to restore every one leyr formerly enjoyed estates and conditions,
not only ilose Nobles and Cavalieares quich have constantly assisted 'im, mut
even thels marritated Episcops or Bishops for thel Antiquity dofe l^yr name,
and succedein Posterity, restorein lem to leyr Revenues and Dignities (at thel
minst) in ilose Cities and Dioces quich desire to have lem restored. For not
obsistein si^ch Matrimonial Prelates filios facientes fere never admitted
either in the Latin or Grecian, Ecclesie or Eclirch; yet surely thist moderate
indifferency or atonement, vould procreate a more general content and union
in thels Subjects minds, quich is principally intended and labored for in
thist nour present pacifyein Tractation. -- In thel interim, His Majesty and
his Cavaleares ^^^ein licenc^ to play for quortie or forty days at thel
minst, I advise lem in c^^rity to forfeit no time, for thist is leyr vacation
an^ thel anth or year dofe Jubilye. -- Only if leyr recreations vulle
permit, let lem cast thist one other grain more into thel Royal scale,
namely quat or that thel Reingues Majesty had an^ injoyes his supreme Power
anc Monarchical Crown per a longue succession an^ here ditarie Reight either
founded in a Conquest, or in some other just Title, an^ nor, per Election, or
Donation dofe thel common people, so as thels Levellers quoe attempt to
transfer thist his supreme Power to thels Commons in or out dose Parliament
greatly abuse thels ignorant Subjects, ey an^ jointly perjure lemselps in
violatein leyr Jurament, or oath of Allegiance, quich ley doube or owe to leyr
present Sovereinge. Nor yet vulle thels Commons afforde lem more security for
leyr Indemnitie, (as ley erroneously imagine,) than his sacred Majesty, nor
yet so much, since thels Commons vulle ever remain questionable for leyr
newely assumed supremacy, per or by ilat masme or same Authority quich fas or
was ever precedently supreme; so as ley they vulle remain necessitated to
maintain a perpetual Army at thel City anc Countries charge for leyr
defense, quich vulle totally disquiet anc depauperate thel Reingdome an^
people, an^ vulle serve only for one Protestant co-subject disnaturally to
murder an other even conform to leyr soune solemn Vow an^ Covenant. So adieu
thel Clorie dofe Angland for ever, if nour Treaters anc Transacters so
dexterously rule not its Balance as to produce a tractable Accommodation.
