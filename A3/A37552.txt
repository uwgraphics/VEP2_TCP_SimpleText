London trading to the East Indies, exhibited to the Right Honorable the Lords
and Commons, in the High Court of Parliament assembled.

THE HUMBLE REMONSTRANCE OF Those Reasons which the Governor and Company of
Merchants of London trading to the East India, do make upon the Quaeres that
are annexed unto their Petition, exhibited in the Honorable House of COMMONS,
assembled in PARLIAMENT.
And First,



Whether it does not greatly increase the general Traffic of the Kingdom,
not only as it is a very ample Trade of it self between England and the
Indies; but also as it is an ample Staple or Magazine of many rich Indian wares
to send from hence into other foreign Countries.

THE Trade to the East Indies some few years past, when we had war with the
Portugals, did employ fifteen thousand tons of Shipping all at once, either
going or coming, or Trading there from Port to Port; but since (upon good
experience) we find that so great a charge is neither necessary for our
defense; nor comportable by the benefit of the Traffic, until some further
Discoveries may be made in China, or elsewhere, as is hoped: Nevertheless
(according to the present times) there may be employed and maintained eight
thousand tons of great and warlike Shipping, besides two thousands tons
more here in the Kingdom continually repayring for the next supply of those
Voyages.

THis Trade as it is thus great in it self; so does it yet further enlarge our
Traffic and strength, by furnishing this Kingdom with all sorts of Indian
wares, not only for our own use, but more especially for the necessary wants
of foreign Nations, which has greatly increased the number of our Warlike
Ships, to export them from hence into Turkey, Italy, the East Countries, and
other places: For proof whereof we instance some former-times, when we have
brought into England above eight thousand bags of Pepper from the Indies in
one year (and may do so again if the Trade subsist) Where this Kingdom does
not consume above one thousand and three hundred bags per annum at the most;
So the rest are transported into foreign Countries; and the like may be said
for Callicoes, Indigo, and some other Indian Wares.

ALl which additions of shipping unto our former strength by Sea before this
Trade began, do employ many of his Majesty's subjects in sundry Arts to build
and repair the said ships, together with the making of Ordnance, Muskets,
Powder, Shot, Swords, Pikes, Cordage, Canvas, and other necessary Amunitions
and provisions thereunto belonging; besides a multitude of Mariners, whereof
many of them are shipped from hence. Land-men or such as were not formerly used
to the Seas, but are bred and made good Mariners by these Voyages, which
otherwise at home (being without Arts or maintenance) are a heavy burden to
their friends and Country.

ANd if it be objected, that this great increase of shipping which is here
declared, is not always in the Kingdom upon occasion of service, the answer
is. That neither are the ships of any other Merchants here at home, but some
are going, some are coming, and ever the least part are in the Kingdom; yet
still wheresoever they are, his Majesty's subjects have by them their
employment and maintenance, and the Kingdom as well as the East India Company
have had their service: For how famous are their exploits to all Nations? How
many rich Carracks have they suncke and spoiled? How many assaults of Spanish
Gallions have they withstood and foiled? What slaughter of their soldiers,
sack of their Towns, subversion of their trades, and such like honorable
actions have they performed? and all with little loss of ships or men? It
would require a large discourse, to declare the particulars: Neither does the
East India Company commonly want two thousand Tuns of shipping or more here in
the Kingdom, which are either in building or repayring, together with all
their Ordnance and other Warlike furniture, besides their storehouses and
Dock-yards, plentifully provided with Timber, Plancke, Cordage, Powder, shot,
and many other necessary Ammunitions both for themselves, and oftentimes to
help others with such provisions as cannot elsewhere be found for money in this
Kingdom.

THere is yet one common Objection, but it is so weak that it scarce deserves
an answer, which is, that this East India Trade destroys our shipping and
Mariners, when clean contrary to this we have already showed the great
increase of both, and if men dye in these long voyages, and ships by length of
time be laid up, either here or in the Indies, yet what is all this but natures
course? and that which happens here at home in our nearest Trades, although
with far less noise and notice; How many brave Commanders have we bred from
mean degree? (whereof diverse are still in our service) some at this present
are found worthy good places in his Majesty's Navy, others (being grown rich)
do either keep at home, or follow shorter voyages; but leaving these
advantages we do answer all with this, that whatsoever is pretended in the
decay of shipping or death of men, yet notwithstanding the Kingdom, by this
trade has obtained no less increase or clear addition both of the one and
the other, which continually subsist and are in action, then is before declared.

Whether it does not increase the general stock and wealth of the Kingdom.

Whether it be not a means to save the particular Subjects much money yearly
in their ordinary expenses upon all sorts of Indian wares.

Whether it does not much increase his Majesty's Customs and Imposts in the
yearly revenue.

Whether it is not a good means to improve the price of Lands, Woolls, Tynne,
Iron, Lead, and other the Wealth.
native commodities of this Kingdom.



HEre we have five Quaeres which must be all proved severally, the first is
general, wherein we must consider how the whole Kingdom may be enriched by
our Commerce with strangers, the which to perform, although it has one and
the same rule in all the particular places of the Trade, yet is not every
Country alike profitable to this Commonwealth, for the remotest Traffic is
always most beneficial to the public Stock, The places of our remotest
Traffic are most profitable to the Commonwealth.
the example may be framed thus. Suppose we therefore, that Pepper were
constantly worth 2. shillings the pound here in England, if we should then
fetch the same from Holland the Merchant may pay there to the stranger twenty
pence the pound out of this Kingdoms stock, and gain well by the bargain,
but if he fetch this Pepper from the East Indies, he cannot give there above
five pence the pound at the most to obtain the like gain, when all charges
are considered; which does sufficiently show the great advantage we have to buy
our wares in those remote Countries, not only for that part alone which we
spend and consume, but especially for that great quantity which from hence we
transport yearly into other Countries to be sold at higher price then it is
worth here in England; Whereby it is plain, We may grow rich in Trade by the
Stock of other Nations.
that we make a far greater Stock by gain upon these Indian Commodities,
then those Nations do where they grow; and to whom they properly appertain,
as being the natural wealth of their Countries: neither is there less honor
and judgment by getting riches in this manner, upon the Stock of other
Nations, then by an industrious increase of our own means, especially when
this latter is advanced by the benefit of the former, as we have found in the
East Indies by sale of much of our Cloth, Cloth and Lead vented in the
East Indies.
Lead; and other native Commodities, the vent whereof does daily increase in
those Countries, which formerly had no use of our Wares, but for the better
understanding of that which has been said, we must not forget to distinguish
between the gain of the Kingdom, and the profit of the Merchant. A
distinction between the gain of the Kingdom, and the profit of the Merchant.
For although the Kingdom pay no more for this Pepper then is before supposed,
nor for any other Commodity bought in foreign parts, more then the stranger
receives from us for the same; yet the Merchant pays not only that price,
but also the freight, ensurance, interest, custom, impost, and many other
charges which are exceeding great in these long Voyages; but yet all these in
the Kingdoms account are but commutations among our selves, and no privation
of the public stock, they remain still in the Kingdom.

NOw concerning that which every particular subject of the Realm saves in his
ordinary expense of Indian Wares, it is manifest that heretofore when we
brought Indico from Turkey, that sort was ordinarily sold here for seven
shillings the pound or more, which now we sell for five shillings the pound and
under, Pepper then ordinarily at three shillings and three shillings four
pence the pound, which now is sold by the East India Company The Hollanders in
grossing of Cloves, Maces, and Nutmegs, have made them exceeding dear.
for 18. pence the pound, with long time also given therewith for payment, and
so likewise of diverse other wares: but for Cloves, Maces, and Nutmegs, they are
at very dear prices, because the Hollanders having expelled our people from the
Islands of the Moluccoes, Banda, and Amboina, do still keep us by force from the
trade of those Spices: In which wares when we enjoyed the freedom in the
Indies that unto us belongs, we sold those Spices at two rates: But as the
Dutch have raised the price of these Commodities, so would they much more
inhaunce them and all other the rich Wares of those Countries, if we should
abandon or be basely driven from the Trade.

THe next Quaere needs but little proof, for who can truly say that his
Majesty's Customs and Impost are not multiplied, when the Traffic of this
Kingdom is so much increased: only this we will affirm, that if the Trade to
the East Indies were so well encouraged that it might be effectually followed,
it would yearly bring to his Majesty's Coffers much more then now it does.

THe next Quaere Concerns the Kingdom nearly, for it is no small worth to
improve the price of Lands, which never has not can be done, (to the common
benefit) but by the prosperous success of our foreign trade, the Balance
whereof is the only means and rule of our treasure: The balance of our
foreign trade is the true rule of our treasure.
that is to say, when either by issuing out of the Realm yearly a greater
value in Wares then we consume of foreign Commodities we grow rich, or by
spending more of Strangers goods then we sell them of our own, we are
impoverished; For the first of these courses does bring in the money which we
have, the last will carry it away again when we have got it. It is a true
saying, that plenty or scarsity of money makes all things dear or cheap in a
Commonwealth, but it is necessary to distinguish the seeming plenties of money
from that which only is substantial and able to perform the work; For there
are diverse ways and means to procure plenty of money into a Kingdom, (for a
short time) which do not therefore enrich, but rather impoverish the same, by
the several inconveniences which ever accompany such alterations.

FOr first, if we should melt down our Plate into Coin, which suits not with
the Majesty of so great a Kingdom, except in cases of great extremity, it
would cause plenty of money for a time, yet should we be nothing the richer,
but rather this Treasure being thus altered, is made the more apter to be
carried out of the Kingdom, if we exceed our means by excess in foreign
wares, or maintain a War by Sea or Land, where we do not feed and cloth the
Soldier, and supply the armies with our own native provisions; by which
disorders our Treasure will soon be exhausted, for it is not the Merchants
exchange by bills that can prevent the last of these evils, as some have
supposed. Again if we think to bring in store of money by suffering foreign
Coins to pass current here at higher rates then their intrinsicke value,
compared with our standard; or by debasing, or by inhaunsing our own moneys
(as some men have projected) all these actions bring their several
inconveniences, and notable ruins, as well to the King, as to his Subjects, of
which we omit to enlarge, (because it is not much pertinent to our cause in
hand) but rather admitting that by these courses, plenty of money might be
brought into the Realm, yet should we be nothing the richer, neither can such
treasure (so gotten) long remain with us, for, whether Treasure which cannot
long remain with us.
it be the stranger or the English Merchant that brings in this money, it must
ever be done upon a valuable consideration, either for wares carried out
already, or after to be exported, which helps us nothing except the evil
occasions of excess or War aforenamed be removed, which will exhaust our
treasure; for otherwise, the money that one man brings in for gain, an other
shall be forced to carry out for necessity, because there shall ever be a
necessity to balance our account with Strangers, although it should be done
with great loss upon the rate of the money which is exported, and peril or
consiscations also, if it be intercepted by the Law, for necessity orgaine will
ever find some means to violate such Laws.

BUt if it should be objected that the price of our Lands are not improved
only by Treasure gained in our foreign Trade, but also by a great increase
of people, whether they be natives or strangers, The great increase of
strangers inhabiting here, does impoverish this Kingdom, and beggar our poor
by depriving them of their Arts and manufactures, raising the price of corn,
victuals Rents, and the like.
or both: The answer is, that the first of these ways does perform it to the
(common benefit) and the latter to the enriching of the Landlords only by a
manifest impoverishing of the Kingdom: For our experience in one particular
does teach us, that of late years we are grown so populous, that we can spare
no corn to transport into foreign Countries, but sell it all here to serve
our own wants at dear rates, which formerly when it was much cheaper employed
many ships and mariners to export it unto strangers, and thereby returned us
store of Treasure, which great benefit to the Kingdom is now lost. And as
hereby the exportation of our native Commodities is much diminished, so our
consumption of foreign Wares is as much increased, which is a double means to
impoverish this Kingdom.

THe business then is briefly thus, that as the treasure which is brought into
the Realm by the balance of our foreign trade, is that money which only
does abide with us, and by which we Treasure that does remain with us enrich
us, and does improve our Lands.
are enriched, so by this plenty of money thus gotten (and no otherwise) do
our lands improve, for when the Merchant has a good dispatch beyond the Seas,
for his Cloth, and other our native wares, he does presently return to buy up
the greater quantity which raises the price of Woolls, and other commodities,
which does improve the Landlords rents, as the Leases expire daily; and also
by this means money being gained and brought more abundantly into this
Kingdom, it does enable many men to buy Lands which must make them the dearer:
but if our foreign Trade come to a stop or declination by neglect at home, or
injuries abroad, whereby the Merchants are impoverished, and so the Wares of
the Realm less issued, then do all the said benefits cease, and our Lands
fall of price daily: whereupon we conclude, that as the flourishing estate of
our general Trade is the only means to make our Lands improve, so the
particular Trade to the East Indies, is a principal instrument therein,
because (as we have already proved) it has so much increased the Traffic of
this Kingdom.

THe next Quaere seems to be a mystery which many of our Adventures do not
well understand, for (say they) how can the Kingdom gain by this Trade, when
we who are the members thereof, have lost so grievously? they do not well
discern that their private loss may be far less in proportion, then the
public benefit, as we shall instance some examples to make the business
plain.

IN the course of foreign Trade, there be three Three degrees of gain in
foreign Trade.
sorts or degrees of gain, the first, that of the Commonwealth, which may be
done when the Merchant (who is principal agent therein) shall loose. The
second is the gain of the Merchant, which he does sometimes justly and
worthily effect, although the Commonwealth be a looser. The third is the gain
of the King, whereof he is ever certain even when the Commonwealth and the
Merchant shall be both loosers.

COncerning the first of these, we have already sufficiently showed the ways
and means whereby the Commonwealth may be enriched in the course of Trade, by
the balance of the same, when excesses are avoided: therefore it is needless
here to make any further repetition: only we do in this place affirm that
such happiness may be in the Commonwealth, when the Merchant for his
particular shall have no occasion to rejoice. As for example, suppose the
East India Company should send out one hundred thousand pounds in Wares or
money into the East Indies, and receive home for the same, the full value of
three hundred thousand pounds, hereby it is evident that this part of the
public stock is trebled, and yet we may boldly say, that which we can well
prove, that our said Company of Merchants shall be loosers by such an
adventure, if the returns be made in Spice, Indico, Callicoes, Benjamin,
refined Saltpeter, Cotton-yarne, and such other bulkey wares in their several
proportions, according to their vent and use in these parts of Europe: for the
freight of shipping, the insurance of the Adventnre, the charges of Factors
abroad, and Officers at home, the forbearance of the Stock, his Majesty's
custom and imposts, with other petty charges incident, will be above two
hundred thousand pounds, which being added to the principal produces loss,
and thus we see that not only the Kingdom, but also the KING The King and
Kingdom may get by Trade; even when the Merchant loses.
may get very much, even when the Merchant notwithstanding shall loose in his
proportion, which gives good occasion here to consider how much more the
Realm is enriched by this Trade, when all things p^sse so happily that the
Merchant is a gayner also together with the KING and Kingdom.

BUt for the better explaning of that which has been already alleged, we
must understand that if the said hundred thousand pounds should be trebled by
the return of so much Silks and other fine Wares out of the Indies, then the
Merchant likewise should receive good gain by such an adventure; and the
reason is, because this great wealth would require but five hundred tun of
shipping to lade and bring home the same, which is but a very small charge in
respect of four thousand tons of shipping, which would be required to lade
home the like value in the bulkie Commodities of Spice and the like, which are
afore-written.

THe second sort of gain in the course of trade is, when the Merchant by his
laudable endeavors may both bring in and carry out Wares to his advantage, by
buying them and selling them to good profit, which is the end of his labors:
Yet nevertheless, the Commonwealth shall decline and grow poor by a disorder
in the people, when through pride and other excesses they do consume more
foreign Ware in value, then the wealth of the Kingdom can satisfy and pay
by the exportation of our own Commodities, which is the very quality of an
unthrift, who spends beyond his means.

THe third sort of gain is the Kings, who is ever sure to get by Trade, when
both the Commonwealth and the Merchant shall loose severally, as
afore-written; or jointly, as it may and does sometimes happen when the
Merchants success is bad, and when our Commodities are over balanced by
foreign Wares consumed: but if such disorders be not prevented, his Majesty
in the end shall be the greatest looser, when his Subjects be impoverished.

Spain and his Subjects, and to exhaust their Treasure.

Whether it be not a means to Counterpoize the Hollanders swelling-greatnesse
by Trade, and to keep them from being absolute Lords of the Seas, if they may
drive us out of this rich Traffic, as they have long endeavored to perform.

THe safety of the Kingdom consists not only in i'ts own strength and
wealth, but also in the laudable and lawful performance of those things which
will weaken and impoverish such powerful Princes, as either are, or may become
our Enemies; Amongst which we will now rank the Spaniard in the first place,
who being euabled by the power of his Indian Treasure, not only to keep in
subjection many goodly States and Provinces in Italy, the Low Countries, and
elsewhere, (which otherwise would soon fall from his obeyfance) but also by a
continual War taking his advantages, does still enlarge his Dominions,
aiming at nothing more then Monarchy by this plenty of his money, which are the
very synewes of his strength, that lie so far dispersed into so many Countries,
yet hereby united, and his wants supplied both for War and peace in a
plentiful manner from all the part of Christendom, which are therefore
pertakers of his Treasure by a necessity of commerce, Spanish Treasure is
exhausted by anecessity of commerce.
Wherein the Spanish policy has ever endeavored to prevent all other Nations
the most it could; For, finding Spain to be too poor and barren to supply it
self and the WEST INDIES, with those varieties of foreign Wares, whereof
they stand in need, they knew well that when their native Commodities come
short to this purpose, then their moneys must serve to make up the reckoning
whereupon they found incredible advantage by adding the Traffic of the
East Indies Spanish policy and profit in the East India Trade.
to the Treasure of the West: For the last of these being employed in the first
they stored themselves infinitely with rich Wares, to barter with all the parts
of Christendom for their Commodities, and so furnishing their own
necessities, prevented others for carrying away their moneys, which in point of
State they hold less dangerous to impart to the remote Indians then to their
neighbor Princes, least it should too much enable them to resist (if not
offend) their Enemies: And this Spanish policy against others is the more
remarkable being done likewise so much to their own advantage; For, every
Ryall of Eight which they sent to the East Indies; brought home so much Wares,
as saved them the disbursing of six Royalls of Eight here in EUROPE (at the
least) to their neighbors; especially in those times when that Trade was only
in their hands: But now this great profit is failed, and the mischief removed
by the English and Dutch, who partake in those East India Trades as amply as
the Spanish Subjects.

IT is further to be considered that besides the disability of the Spanyard, by
their native Commodities to provi^e foreign wares for their necessities
(whereby they are forced to supply their wants with money) they have likewise
that Canker of war which does infinitely exhaust their Treasure and disperse

into Christendom even to their Enemies, part by reprisall, but especially
thorough a necessary maintenance of those Armies which are composed of many
strangers, and lie so far remote that they cannot feed, Cloth, or otherwise
provide them out of their own native means and provisions, but must receive
this relief from other Nations: which The effects of different wars concerning
Treasure.
kind of war is far different to that which a Prince makes upon his own
confines, or in his Navies by sea, where the soldier receiving moneys for his
wages must every day deliver it out again for his necessities, whereby the
Treasure remains still in the Kingdom, although it be exhausted from the
King, but we see that the Spanyard (trusting in the power of his Treasure)
undertakes Wars in Germany and other remote places which would soon beggar
the richest Kingdom in Christendom of all their money, the want whereof would
presently disorder and bring the Armies to confusion, as it falls out
sometimes with Spain it self (who has the fountain of money) when either it
is stopped in the passage by the force of their Enemies, or drawn out faster
then it flows by their own occasions; whereby also we often see that Gold and
Silver is so scarce in Spain, that they are forced to use base copp^r money,
to the great confusion of their Trade in want of supplies, and not without the
undoing also of many of their own people.

BUt now that we have seen the occasions by which the Spanish Treasure is
dispersed into so many places of the world; it is The Spanish treasure which is
exhausted either by commerce or war, does all come in the end into the
general Commerce of diverse Nations.
needful likewise to discover, how and in what proportion each Country does
partake of these moneys: For we find that Turkey, and diverse other Nations
have great plenty thereof, although they drive no Trade with Spain, which
seems to contradict the former reason, where we say that this Treasure is
obtained by a necessity of Commerce; but to clear this point we must know,
that all Nations (who have no Mines of their own) are enriched with Gold and
Silver by one and the same means, which is already showed to be the balance
of their foreign trades, and this is not strictly tied to be done in those
Countries where the fountain of Treasure is, but rather with such order and
observations in the Trade and against excess as are prescribed: for suppose
England by Commerce with Spain may get and bring home five hundred thousand
Ryalls of Eight yearly, yet if we loose as much by our Trade in Turkey, and
therefore carry the money thither, it is not then the English, but the Turks
who have got this Treasure; although they have no Trade with Spain, from
whence it was first brought. Again if England having thus lost with Turkey,
do notwithstanding gain twice as much by France, Italy, and other members of
her general Trade, then will there remain five hundred thousand Ryalls of
Eight clear gains by the balance of the same; and this comparison holds
between all other Nations, both for the manner of getting, and the proportion
that is yearly gotten. But yet if a question should be made, whether all
Nations get Treasure, and Spain only loose it* we answer no; for some
Countries by War or by excess do loose that which they had gotten, as well
as Spain by War and want of Wares does loose that which was its own.

ANd so much shall suffice to show, that to partake in the Trade of the
East Indies, does not only weaken Spaniards Navigation and strengthen our
own; but also to impeach him in this rich Trade, does mightily exhaust his
Treasure and increase our moneys.

HAving done with the powerful Spaniard, we must now say something of our
professed friends, the Hollanders, who of late years are become a The
Hollanders greatness by Trade.
flourishing People, Wealthy and strong, both by Sea and Land, by nothing else
but Trade; and yet we know that they have little in their own Country
wherewithal to Trade; but we must not therefore imagine, that so great a
building is either raised or can stand without a strong foundation, which these
industrious men wanting means in their own Land, do find out rich Mines in
his Majesty's Seas; Golden Mines we may term them, for so the Lords States
themselves do call them, and The Hollanders best foundation is the English
Fishing.
thus also in their public Proclamations, which they have set forth in all
occasions for the better preservation of this Fishing, a treasure it is
(indeed) inestimable, and an employment most profitable: From hence originally
proceeds the increase and maintenance of their People, their flourishing Arts,
their private wealth, their public Treasure, the multitude of their Ships
which fetch materials, to build ships, the swarms of their small Vessels which
catch Fish, to lade their great Ship which Trade with Fish; the proceed whereof
does furnish them with all their wants of foreign Wares, and makes them all
rich in Treasure; with which Treasure they do also enlarge their Trade into
all the quarters of the world, whereby they are become the Magaz^nes for
England, France, Spain, Turkey, and other places, for Corn, Cordage,
Ordnance, Powder, Shot, Ships, Wines, Fruits, Canvas, and many others, besides
the rich Wares from the East and West Indies, serving each Country according
to their several wants and occasions: In which course of Trade, they are not
less industrious to supplant others (especially the English) then they are
careful to strengthen themselves with more then ordinary diligence; for they
know well, that, Trade has raised their fortune, and does feed their Hopes; We
desire not here to aggravate their Actions against us in the East Indies, for
they are already too well known to all the world, but we rather with patience
expect the means of our satisfaction and future safety; wherein we doubt not
of his Majesty's most gracious favors and resolutions so well begun, and in so
good away to settle and support a Trade of such great consequence; the which if
the Hollanders might soly enjoy (as they endeavor) they would (by the power If
our Trade to the East Indies should fall our other best Trades will fall with
in.
thereof) soon make themselves Masters (also) of our other best Trades into
the Str^ights, and be the only Merchants even of our Cloth and other native
Commodities into those Countries, as they are already possessed of the
Exportation of (almost) all our Herrings, Pilchards, and New-land Fish, to the
maintenance of their Shipping and decay of ours, which is the more considerable
because it may be wished, that Corn, and Victuals, might be exported, only in
English Shipping, but the Hollanders are diligent observers of such occasions
as may give them advantage; they know well how to work their own ends in all
places where they come; and as they have infinitely prevailed in the
augmentation of their Trade by the declination of other Nations, so they aim
at nothing more now then to weaken the English in their Traffic, for we only
are their Corrivals, able to keep them from the absolute Dominion of the Seas,
wherein we may hope ever to prevail, if we loose not the power we possess,
and the rich Trades, which we have so well discovered.



THis position is so contrary to the common opinion, that it will require
strong Arguments, to maintain and prove it, before it will be accepted,
especially of the multitude, who bitterly exclaim when they see any Moneys
carried out of the Realm; affirming thereupon that we have absolutely lost so
much Treasure, being an Act against the long continued Laws of this Kingdom,
and that many other places, nay, Spain it self (which is the fountain of
Money) forbids the Exportation thereof, some cases only excepted. To all which
we might answer, that Venice, Florence, Genoa, Savoy, Marcellis, Turkey, the
Low Countries, and diverse other places permits it, their people applaudes it,
and find great benefit by it; but all this makes a noise and proves nothing:
We must therefore come to those reasons which concern the business in
question.

FIrst, therefore we will take that for granted which none will deny us, that
we have no other means to get Treasure but by Foreign We have no Treasure
but by Trade.
Trade, for Mines we have none which do afford it, and how this Money is
gotten in the mannaging of our said Trade, we have already showed, that it is
done By making our Commodities which are Exported, to overbalance in Value
the foreign Wares which we consume; so that it rests only to show how our
moneys may be added to our Commodities, and being jointly exported may so much
the more increase our Treasure.

ANd here we will suppose, that our yearly consumption of foreign wares is
to the value of twenty hundred thousand pounds, and our exportations to exceed
that two hundred thousand pounds, which sum we may A near estimation of our
yearly exportations and importations, as they have bin found by good inquiry.
thereupon affirm is brought to us in Treasure to balance the account; but
now if we add three hundred thousand pounds more in ready money unto our former
exportation in wares, what profit can we have (will some men say) although by
this means we should bring in so much ready money more then we did before,
seeing that we have carried out the like value.

TO this the answer is, that when we have prepared our exportations of wares,
and sent out as much of every thing as we can spare or vent abroad; it is not
therefore said, that then we should add our money thereunto to fetch in the
more money immediately, but rather first to enlarge our Trade therewith, by
inabling us to bring in more foreign wares, which being sent out again into
the places of their consume, they will in due time much increase our Treasure,
for although in this manner we do yearly multiply our importations to the
maintenance of more shipping and Mariners, improvement of his Majesty's
Customs and other benefits, yet our consumption of those foreign wares is no
more then it was before: so that all the said increase of commodities brought
in by the means of our ready money sent out as is before written, does in the
end become an exportation unto us of a far greater value then our said moneys
were, which is proved by three several examples following.

FIrst, we will suppose that one hundred thousand pounds sterling being sent in
our shipping into the East Countries, will buy there one hundred thousand
quarters of wheat clear of all charges aboard the ships, which being after
brought into England and housed, to export the same at the best time for vent
thereof in Spain, or Italy it cannot yield less in those parts then two
hundred thousand pounds to make the Merchant but a faver, yet by this reckoning
we see the Kingdom has doubled that Treasure.

Again this profit will be far greater when we Trade thus with our money in
remote The trade to the East Indies (in its proportion) is the best trade and
means we have to increase our Treasure.
Countries, as for example, if we send one hundred thousand pounds into the
East Indies to buy Pepper there and bring it hither, and from hence send it for
Italy or Turkey, it must yield five hundred thousand pounds at least in those
places, in regard of the excessive charge which the Merchant disburseth in
those long voyages in shipping, wages, victuals, insuirance, interest,
customs, imposts, and the like: all which charges notwithstanding the King and
the Kingdom gets. And we may here observe, that as the public profit by
foreign Trade is the only means whereby we gain our Treasure: So this
Trade to the East Indies (in its proportion) does far excel all others.

THe third example is, where the voyages are short and the wares rich, which
therefore will not employ much shipping, the profit to the Kingdom will be far
less; as when an other hundred thousand pounds shall be employed in Turkey, in
raw silks, and brought hither to be after transported from hence into France,
the Low Countries, or Germany, the Merchant shall have good gain although he
sell it there for one hundred and fifty thousand pounds: and thus take the
voyages all together in their Medium, the ready moneys exported will be returned
unto us near trebled. But if any man will yet object that these returns come
to us in wares, and not really in moneys as they were issued out.

THe answer is, (keeping our first ground) that if our consumption of foreign
wares be no more yearly then is already supposed, and that our exportations be
so mightily increased by this manner of Trading with ready money as is before
declared: it is not then possible (in the course of trade) but that all the
overbalance or difference should return either in money or in such wares as
we must export again; which as is already plainly showed, will be still a
greater means to increase our Treasure: For it is in the stock of a Kingdom,
as in the estates of private men, who having store of wares, do not therefore
say that they will not venture out, or trade with their money, (for this were
ridiculous) but do also turn that into wares, whereby they multiply their
money; and so by a continual and orderly change of one into the other grow
rich, and when they please, turn all their estates into Treasure, for they
that have wares cannot want money, and therefore the former objection is not
considerable: for what begot the moneys which we sent out, but our wares?

NEither is it said that money is the life of Trade, as if it could not subsist
or pass current without the same; for we know that there was great Trading by
way of Commutation or Barter, when there was little Money stirring in the
world. The Italians and some other Nations have such remedies against this
want, that it can neither decay nor hinder their Trade, for they transfer
Bills of Debt, and have other ways whereby they assign their Credits from one
to an other daily for very great sums with ease and satisfaction by Writing
only, whilst in the mean time, the Mass of Treasure which gave foundation,
to those Credits is employed in foreign Trade as a merchandise, which does
much increase Money inlargeth Trade, and Trade increases money.
their traffic. It is not therefore the keeping of our Money in the Kingdom,
which makes a quick and ample trade, but the necessity and use of our Wares in
foreign Countries, and our want of their Commodities which causes the Vent
and consumption on all sides.

We must not here forget the practice of the great Duke of Tuscany in his Port
of Leghorne, which of late years from a poor town is become a fair City,
and one of the most famous places for trade in Christendom, by the resort of
many Nations, but most especially by the English and Dutch with Merchandise to
a very great value yearly, and yet it is worthy observation that the multitude
of Ships and wares which come thither, have little or no means to make their
returns from thence, but only in ready money, which they may, and do carry
away freely at all times and without Custom, and such charges to the
incredible advantage, of the said Duke of Tuscany and his Subjects, who are
much enriched by the continual great concourse of Merchants, from all the
States of the neighbor Princes, bringing them plenty of money daily to supply
their wants of the said wares. And thus we see that the Current of Merchandise
which carries away their Treasure, becomes a flowing stream to fill them
again in a greater measure with money.

THe example of this growing greatness, has lately moved the Duke of Savoy,
publickely to declare his Princely resolution to all Nations, offering them
many privileges and immunities, that shall come to Trade in his free Port of
Vila Franca, and especially a liberty to carry away ready moneys for all the
Wares they bring, or other occasions: and yet we know that neither in Tuscany
or Savoy, are any Mines or moneys more then they have and do daily get by
Trade; but they know likewise that if we yearly bring them wares (although for
a very great value) the money will immediately follow, for, let no man doubt
but that money must ever attend on Merchandise, for they go together: and it
is worthy the noting that those Princes are content to part with their treasure
only to enjoy the trade of the wares which are brought them, for which (to
encourage the Merchant) they take no Custom; whereas we by sending out our
money do gain the employment of our shipping, the Trade of the wares, and the
profit of the Customs which is a treble benefit.

THere is yet an objection or two as weak as all the rest: The first is that
if we trade with our money, we shall issue out the less wares, as if a man
should say, those Countries which heretofore had occasion to consume our
Cloth, Lead, Tynne, Iron, Fish, and the like, shall now make use of our moneys
in the place of those necessaries, which to affirm were most absurd, or that
the Merchant had not rather carry out wares (by which there is ever some gains
expected) then to export money, which is still but the same without any
increase.

BUt on the contrary there are many Countries which may yield us very large and
profitable Traffic for our money, that otherwise afford us no trade at all
because they have no use of our wares, as namely the East Indies for one, in
the first beginning thereof although since by industry in our Commerce with
those Nations we have brought them into the use of much of our Cloth, Lead,
and other things, which is a good addition to the former vent of our
Commodities.

Again, some men have alleged that those Countries which permit money to be
carried out, do it, because they have few or no wares to trade withal: but we
have great store of Commodities, and therefore their action ought not to be our
example.

TO this the answer is briefly; That if we have such a quantity of wares, as
does fully provide us of all things needful from beyond the Seas, why should
we then doubt that our moneys sent out in trade must not necessarily come back
again in Treasure, together with the great gains which it may procure in such
manner as is before set down? and on the other side if those Nations which send
out their moneys, do it because they have few wares of their own; how come
they then to have so much treasure as we ever see in those places, which suffer
it freely to be exported at all times and by whom so ever. We answer even by
trading with their moneys: For by what other means can they get it, having no
mines of Gold or Silver?

THus may we plainly see, that when this weighty business is duly
considered in its end (as all our human actions ought well Our humane actions
ought especially to be considered in their ends.
to be weighed) it is found much contrary to that which most men esteem
thereof, because they search no further then the beginning of this work, which
mis-informes their judgments and leads them into error: For if we only
behold the actions of the Husbandman in the seed time, when he cas^eth away
much good corn into the ground, we will rather account him a mad man then a
Husbandman: but when we consider his labors in the Harvest, which is the end
of his endeavors; We find the worth and plentiful increase of his actions.



WE have endeavored upon all the former Quaeres to be as brief as
conveniently we might without obscurity, and now upon this last point there
will be no occasion at all to enlarge; for when it shall be found that the
trade to the East Indies is so good a means to increase our strength, wealth,
safety, and treasure, and that those discoveries have spread his Majesty's fame
into Persia, Iapan, China, the Dominions of the great Magull, and many other
remote Nations of the Eastern world, there will be no denial, but that these
great blessings are so precious and honorable both to the King and his
Kingdoms, that they ought to be preserved with our best endeavors against the
strongest opposition.

And for conclusion the East India Company do humbly declare unto your
Lordships and the honorable House of Commons, that they have not made their
Petition and this Remonstrance for their own private ends, but for the public
good; And even so having performed their duties, they hope it shall be their
sufficient discharge in all future times concerning the Suppressing or
Supporting of the said Trade.

FINIS.
