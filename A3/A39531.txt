CHARLES! -- ah forbear, forbear! lest Mortals prize
His Name too dearly; and Idolatrize,
His Name! Our Loss! Thrice cursed and forlorn
Be that Black Night, which ushered in this Morn!
CHARLES our Dread-Soveraigne -- hold! lest Out-lawed Sense
Bribe, and seduce tame Reason to dispense
With those Celestial Powers; and distrust
Heaven can Behold such Treason, and prove Just.
CHARLES our Dread-Soveraign's murdered! -- Tremble! and
View what Convulsions Shoulder-shake this Land.
Court, City, Country, nay three Kingdoms run
To their last Stage, and Set with Him their Sun.
CHARLES our Dread-Soveraign's murdered at Hi^ (...)
Fell Feinds! dire Hydra's of a Stiff-neck't-State!
Strange Bodie-Politicke! whose Members spread,
And, Monster-like, swell bigger then their HEAD.
CHARLES of Great Britain! He who was the known
King of three Realms, lie's murdered in his Own.
He! He! who lived, and Faith's Defender stood,
Die'd here to re-Baptize it in His Blood.
No more, no more. Fame's Trumpe shall Echo all
The Rest in dreadful Thunder. Such a Fall
Great Christendom never Pattern'd; and 'twas strange
Earth's Center reeled not at this dismal Change.
The Blow struck Britain blind; each well-set Limb
By Dislocation was lop't off in HIM.
Though She yet live's, She live's but to condole
Three Bleeding Bodies left without a Soul.
RELIGION put's on Black. Sad LOYALTY
Blushe's and Mourn's to see bright-Majestie
Butchered by such Assassinates; nay both
Against GOD, against LAW, ALLEGIANCE, and their OATH.
Farewell sad Isle! Farewell! Thy fatal Glory
Is Summed Cast up* and Cancelled in this Story.
