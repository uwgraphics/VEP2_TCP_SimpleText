A PROCLAMATION Prohibiting the Exportation of Saltpeter.
CHARLES R.

THe King Our Sovereign Lord taking into His serious and provident
Consideration the most necessary and important use of Gunpowder, as well for
supply of His own Royal Navy and the Shipping of His loving Subjects, as
otherwise for the Safety and Defense of His People and Kingdom; and that by
reason of great Exportations of late, the Stores thereof are much exhausted:
Now to the end His Majesty's Magazines and Subjects may be furnished at home,
without any necessity to depend upon the dangerous, casual, and chargeable
supply thereof from Foreign parts; His Majesty has thought fit (by and with
the Advice of His Privy Council) to prohibit and forbid, and does by this His
Royal Proclamation prohibit and forbid, and straightly Charge and Command all and
every person and persons whatsoever as well Merchants as others, of what estate
or degree soever, That they or any of them, do not at any time or times within
the space of Three months, to be accounted from the publishing of this His
Royal Proclamation, Carry or Transport, or cause or procure to be Carried or
Transported out of this Realm of England and Dominion of Wales, or any part
thereof, into any the parts beyond the Seas, any Saltpeter whatsoever. And His
Majesty does hereby straightly Charge and Command the Farmers of His Customs the
Surveyors, Searchers, and other Officers of His Ports, and Members thereof, in
England and Wales, and all other His Officers and Subjects whatsoever, of what
quality or degree soever, That they and every of them do diligently and
carefully observe and take notice of this His Royal Will and Command, and not
presume directly or indirectly to act or do, or permit or suffer any thing to
be acted or done contrary thereunto, as they and every of them will avoid His
Majesty's displeasure, and the censure of being holden Contemners of His Royal
Command in a matter of high consequence for the public Service and Safety of
the State, and upon such further Penalties and Punishments, as for Example or
Terror to others, their Contempts and want of Duty shall demerit, and by His
Majesty's Prerogative Royal or otherwise shall be found fit in Honor and
Justice to be inflicted upon them.

Given at Whitehall this 17th day of March, 1663. in the Sixteenth year of His
Majesty's Reign.
