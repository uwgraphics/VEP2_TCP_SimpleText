A DECLARATION OF BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.
THe infinite mercy, and providence of the Almighty God has been abundantly
manifested since the beginning of this Parliament, in great variety of
protections and blessings whereby he has not only delivered us from many
wicked Plots, and designs, which if they had taken effect would have brought
ruin, and destruction upon this Kingdom; but out of those attempts has
produced diverse evident, and remarkable advantages to the furtherance of those
services, which we have been desirous to perform to our Sovereign Lord the
King, and to this Church and State in providing for the public peace, and
prosperity of his Majesty, and all his Realms: which in the presence of the
same all-seeing deity, we protest to have been, and still to be the only end
of all our counsels and endeavors, wherein we have resolved to continue
freed, and enlarged from all private aims, personal respects or passions
whatsoever.

In which resolution we are something discouraged, although the heads of the
malignant party disappointed of that prey, the Religion and liberty of this
Kingdom, which they were ready to seize upon, and devour before the beginning
of this Parliament, have still persisted by new practices, both of force and
subtility, to recover the same again: for which purpose they have made
several attempts for the bringing up of the Army; they afterward projected
the false accusation of the Lord Kimbolton, and the five members of the House
of Commons, which being in it self of an odious nature, they yet so far
prevailed with his Majesty as to procure him to take it upon himself, but when
the unchangeable duty and faithfulness of the Parliament could not be wrought
upon by such a fact as that, to withdraw any part of their reverence and
obedience from his Majesty, they have with much art, and industry advised his
Majesty to suffer diverse unjust scandalls, and imputations upon the
Parliament, to be published in his name, whereby they might make it odious to
the people, and by their help to destroy that, which hitherto has been the
only means of their own preservation.

For this purpose they have drawn his Majesty into the Northern parts far from
the Parliament, that so false rumors might have time to get credit, and the
^ust defenses of the Parliament find a more tedious, difficult, and
disadvantagious access, after those false imputations and slanders had been
first rooted in the apprehension of his Majesty, and his Subjects, which the
more speedily to effect, they have caused a Press to be transported to York,
from whence several papers, and writings of that kind are conveyed to all
parts of the Kingdom, without the authority of the great seal, in an unusual
and illegal manner, and without the advice of his Majesty's Privy Counsel;
from the greater, and better part whereof having withdrawn himself, as well as
from his great Council of parliament, he is thereby exposed to the wicked and
unfaithful counsels of such as have made the wisdom, and justice of the
Parliament dangerous to themselves, and this danger they labor to prevent by
hiding their own guilt, under the name and shadow of the King: infusing into
him their own fears, and as much as in them lies, aspersing his royal person
and honor with their own infamy, from both which it has always been as much
the care as it is the duty of the Parliament, to preserve his Majesty, and to
fix the guilt of all evil act^ons and counsels, upon those who have been the
authors of them.

Amongst diverse writings of this kind, we the Lords and Commons in
Parliament, have taken into our consideration two printed papers; the first
containing a declaration which they received from his Majesty in answer of
that which was presented to his Majesty from both Houses of Parliament at
Newmarket the ninth of March. 1641. The other his Majesty's answer to the
petition of both Houses presented to his Majesty at York the 26 of March.
1642. Both which are filled with harsh censures, and causeless charges upon
the Parliament concerning which we hold it necessary to give satisfaction to
the Kingdom, seeing we find it very difficult to satisfy his Majesty, who to
our great grief, we have found to be so engaged to, and possessed by those
misapprehensions which evil counselors have wrought in him, that our most
humble and faithful Remonstrances, have rather irritated and imbittered, then
any thing allayed or mitigated the sharp expressions which his Majesty has
been pleased to make in answer unto them, for the manifestation whereof, and of
our own innocence, we desire that all his Majesty's loving Subjects may take
notice of these particulars.

We know no occasion given by us which might move his Majesty to tell us that
in our declaration presented at Newmarket, there were some expressions
different from the usual language to Princes.

Neither did we tell his Majesty either in words or in effect, that if he did
not join with us in an Act which his Majesty conceived might prove
prejudicial, and dangerous to himself, and the whole kingdom, we would make
a Law without him, and impose it upon the people. That which we desired, was,
that in regard of the imminent danger of the Kingdom, the Militia, for the
security of his Majesty, and his people, might be put under the command of such
noble and faithful persons, as they had all cause to confide in, and such was
the necessity of this preservation, that we declared, that if his Majesty
should refuse to join with us therein, the two Houses of Parliament being the
supreme Court and highest council of the Kingdom, were enabled by their own
authority to provide for the repulsing of such imminent, and evident danger,
not by any new Law of their own making as has been untruly suggested to his
Majesty, but by the most ancient Law of this Kingdom, even that which is
fundamental and essential to the constitution and subsistence of it.

Although we never desired to encourage his Majesty to such replies as might
produce any contestation betwixt him and his Parliament, of which we ^ever
found better effect, then loss of time, and hindrance of the public
affairs; Yet We have been far from telling him of how little value his
words would be with us, much less when they are accompanied with actions of
Love and Justice, His Majesty has more reason to find fault with those wicked
counselors, who have so often bereaved him of the honor, and his people of
the fruit, of many gracious Speeches, which he made to them, such as those in
the end of the last parliament; That in the word of a King, and as he was a
Gentleman he would redress the grievances of his People as well out of
Parliament as in it, were the searching the Studies and Chambers, yea, the
Pockets of some, both of the Nobility, and Commons the very next day; The
Commitment of Master Bellasis, Sir John Hotham, and Master Crew, the continued
oppressions by Ship money, Coat and Conduct money, with the manifold
imprisonments, and other vexations thereupon, and other ensuing violations of
the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, (all which were the effects of evil
counsel, and abundantly declared in our general Remonstrance of the State of
the Kingdom) actions of love and Justice, suitable to such words as those.

As gracious was his Majesty's Speech in the beginning of this Parliament; That
he was resolved to put himself freely, and clearly upon the Love and affection
of his English Subjects, whether his causeless complaints and Jealousy, the
unjust imputations so often cast upon his Parliament, his denial of their
necessary defense by the Ordinance of the Militia, his dangerous absenting
himself from his great council, like to produce such a mischievous division
in the Kingdom have not been more suitable to other men's evil counsels then
to his own words, will easily appear to any indifferent Judgment.

Neither have his latter speeches been better used, and preserved by these
evil and wicked counselors: could any words be fuller of Love, and Justice
then those in his answer to the Message sent, to the House of Commons the 31th
of December 1641. We do engage unto you solemnly the word of a King that the
security of all, and every one of you from violence, is and ever shall be as
much our care, as the preservation of Us and our children, and could any
actions be fuller of injustice and violence then that of the Attorney general,
in falsely accusing the six Members of Parliament, and the other proceedings
thereupon, within three or four days after that Message, for the full view
whereof let the declaration made of those proceedings be perused, and by those
instances (we could ad many more) Let the world Judge, who deserves to be taxed
with disvalewing his Majesty's Words, they who have as much as in them lies,
staynd and sullied them with such foul counsels, or the Parliament, who have
ever manifested with joy, and delight their humble thankfulness for those
gracious words, and actions of love, and Justice, which have been conformable
thereunto.

The King is pleased to disavow the having any such evil Counsel or
Counselors as are mentioned in our Declaration to his knowledge, and we hold
it our duty, humbly to avow there are such, or else we must say, that all the
ill things done of late in his Majesty's name, have been done by himself,
wherein we should neither follow the direction of the Law nor the affection of
our own hearts; which is as much as may be to clear his Majesty from all
imputation of misgovernment, and to lay the fault upon his Ministers; the false
accusing of six members of Parliament, the Justifying Mr. Attorney in that
false accusation, the violent coming to the house of Commons, the denial of
the Militia, the sharp Messages to both houses, contrary to the Customs of
former Kings, the long and remote absence of his Majesty from Parliament; the
heavy and wrongful taxes upon both houses, the Cherishing and countenancing a
discontented party in the Kingdom against them, these certainly are the fruits
of very ill Counsel, apt to put the kingdom into a Combustion, to hinder the
supplies of Ireland, and to countenance the proceedings and pretententions of
the Rebels there, and the Authors of these evil Counsels, we conceive must
needs be known to his Majesty, and we hope our laboring with his Majesty, to
have these discovered, and brought to a just censure, will not so much wound
his honor in the opinion of his good Subjects, as his laboring to preserve
and conceal them.

And whereas his Majesty says, he could wish that his own immediate Actions
which he avowes on his own honor, might not be so roughly censured under
that Common style of evil Counselors: We could also heartily wish that we
had not cause to make that style so Common, but how often and undutifully
soever these wicked Counselors fix their dishonor upon the King, by making
his Majesty the Author of those evil actions, which are the effects of their
own evil Counsels; We his Majesty's Loyal and dutiful subjects can use no
other style according to that Maxim in the Law, the King can do no wrong, but
if any ill be committed in matter of state, the Council; if in matters of
Justice, the Judges must answer for it.

We lay no charge upon his Majesty, which should put him upon that apology,
concerning his faithful and zealous affection of the protestant profession;
Neither does his Majesty endeavor to clear those, in greatest authority
about him, by whom (we say) that design has been potently carried on for
diverse years, and we rather wish that the mercies of heaven then the
Judgments may be manifested upon them, but that there have been such, there
are so plentiful and frequent evidences, that we believe there is none either
protestant or Papist, who has had any reasonable view of the passages of
latter times, but either in fear or hope, did expect a sudden issue of this
design.

We have no way transgressed against the Act of Oblivion, by Remembering the
intended war against Scotland, as a Branch of that design to alter religion,
by those wicked Counsels, from which God did then deliver us, which we ought
never to forget.

That the Rebellion in Ireland was framed and cherisht by the Popish and
Malignant party in England, is not only affirmed by the Rebels, but may be
cleared by many other proofs; The same Rebellious principles of pretended
Religion, the same politic ends are apparent in both, and their malicious
designs and practices are maskt, and disguised with the same false color of
their earnest zeal to vindicate his Majesty's prerogative from the supposed
oppression of the Parliament, how much these treacherous pretenses have been
countenanced by some evil Counsel about his Majesty may appear in this,
that the Proclamation, whereby they were declared traitors was so long withheld
as to the second of January, though the Rebellion broake forth in October
before, and then no more but forty Coppies appointed to be printed, with a
special command from his Majesty not to exceed that number, and that none of
them should be published till his Majesty's pleasure were further signified, as
by the warrant appears, a true Coppie whereof is hereunto added, So that a few
only could take notice of it, which was made more observeable, by the late
contrary proceedings against the Scots; who were in a very quick and sharp
manner proclaimed, and those proclamations forthwith dispersed, with as much
diligence as might be through all the Kingdom, and ordered to be read in all
Churches, accompanied with public prayers and execrations; another evidence
of favor, and countenance to the Rebels in some of power about his Majesty
is this, that they have put forth in his Majesty's name, a causlesse complaint
against the Parliament; which speaks the same language of the Parliament
which the Rebels do, thereby to raise a belief in men's minds, that his
Majesty's affections are alienated, as well as his person is removed from that
his great council, All which does exceedingly retard the supplies of Ireland,
and more advance the proceedings of the Rebels, then any Jealousy or
misapprehension begotten in his Subjects, by the declaration of the Rebels.
Iniunction of Rossetti, or information of Trestram Whitcombe, so that
considering the present state and temper of both kingdoms, his Royal presence
is far more necessary here, then it can be in Ireland, for redemption or
protection of his Subjects there. His Majesty not charged with intention of
any force.


And whether there be any cause of his Majesty's great indignation for being
reproch'd to have intended force or threatening to the Parliament: We desire
them to consider who shall read our declaration in which there is no word
tending to any such reproach, and certainly we have been more tender of his
Majesty's honor in this point, then he whosoever he was that did write this
declaration, where in his Majesty's name, he does call God to witness, he
never had any such thought or knew of any such resolution of bringing up the
Army, which truly, will seem strange to those, who shall read the deposition
of Master Goring, Information of Master Percie, and diverse other examination of
Master Wilmot; Master Pollard and others, the other examinations of Captain
Leg, Sir Jacob Ashley, Sir John Connyers, and consider the condition and
nature of the Petition, which was sent unto Sir Jacob Ashley, under the
approbation of C. R. which his Majesty does now acknowledge to be his own
hand, and being full of scandal to the Parliament, might have proved dangerous
to the whole kingdom, if the Army should have interposed betwixt the King and
them, as was desired.

We do not affirm that his Majesty's warrant was granted for the Passage of
Master Iermine, Mr. Iermins esescape by his Majesty's warrant.
after the desire of both houses for restraint of his Servants, but only that
he did pass over after that restraint by virtue of such a warrant. We know the
warrant bears date the day before our desire, yet it seems strange to those
who know how great respect and Power Mr. Iermiae had in Court, that he should
begin his Journey in such have, and in apparel so unfit for Travail, as a
black Satin suit, and White Boots, if his going away were designed the day
before.

The Accusation of the Lord Kimbolton, Accusation of the Lo. Kimbolton etc.
and the five members of the house of Commons is called a breach of privilege,
and truly so it was, and a very high one, far above any satisfaction that
has been yet given, how can it be said to be largely satisfied, so long as
his Majesty labored to preserve Mr. Attorney from punishment; who was the
visible Actor in it, so long as his Majesty's has not only Justified him, but
by his letter declared, that it was his duty to accuse them, and that he would
have punished him, if he had not done it, So long as those members have not the
means of clearing their Innocence, and the Authors of that malicious charge
undiscovered, though both houses of Parliament have several times petition his
Majesty to discover them, and that not only upon grounds of Common Justice,
but by Act of Parliament; his Majesty is bound to do it, so long as the King
refuses to pass a Bill for their discharge, alleging that the Narrative in
that Bill, is against his honor, whereby he seems still to avow the matter
of that false, and scandalous accusation, though he deserts the prosecution,
offering to pass a Bill for their acquitall, yet with intimation that they
must desert the avowing their own innocence, which would more wound them in
honor, then secure them in Law.

And in vindication of this great privilege of Parliament, we do not know
that we have invaded any privilege belonging to his Majesty, as is alleged
in this declaration.

But we look not upon this only in the Notion of a breach of privilege, which
might be, though the accusation were true, of false, but under the Notion of a
heinous crime, in the attorney and all other Subjects, who had a hand in it, a
Crime against the law of nature, against the rules of Justice, that innocent
men should be charged with so great an offense as Treason, in the face of the
highest Iudicatory of the Kingdom, whereby their lives and estates, their
blood and honor are endangered, without witness, without evidence, without all
possibility of reparation, in a Legal Course, yet a crime of such a nature,
that his Majesty's command can no more warrant, then it can any other Act of
Injustice. it is true that those things which are evil in their own nature,
such as a false testimony or false accusation, cannot be the Subject of any
Command, or induce any obligation of obedience upon any man, by any authority
whatsoever, therefore the Attorney in this case, was bound to refuse to execute
such a command, unless he had had some such evidence or Testimony as might
have warranted him against the parties, and belyable to make satisfaction if it
should prove false, and it is sufficiently known to every man, and adjudged in
Parliament, that the King can be neither relater, informer nor witness, if it
rest as it is without further satisfaction, no future Parliament can be safe,
but that the members may be taken, and destroyed at pleasure, yea the very
principles of government, and Justice will be in danger to be dissolved.

We do not conceive that numbers do make an assembly unlawful, Tumultuous
numbers.
but when either the end or manner of their Carriage, shall be unlawful,
diverse just occasions might draw the Citizens to Westminster, where many
public and private Petitions, and other Causes were depending in Parliament,
and why that should be found more faulty in the Citizens, then the resort of
great numbers every day in the term to the ordinary Courts of Justice we know
not; that those Citizens were notoriously provoked and assaulted at
Westminster, by Colonel Limsford, Captain Hide, with diverse others, and by
some of the servants of the Archbishop of York is sufficiently proved, and
that afterward they were more violently wounded and most barbarously mangled
with Swords by the Officers and Soldiers near White Hall, many of them being
without weapons, and giving no cause of distaste, as is likewise proved by
several testimonies, but of any scandalous or seditious misdemeanors of
theirs, that might give his Majesty good cause to suppose his own person or
those of his Royal Consort, or Children to be in apparent danger, we have had
no proof ever offered to either House, and if there had been any complaint of
that kind, it is nor doubt the Houses would have been as forward to join in
an order for the suppressi^g of such Tumults as they were, not long before upon
another occasion when they made an order to that purpose. Whereas those
Officers and Soldiers which committed that violence upon so many of the
Citizens at Whitehall, were cherisht and fostred in his Majesty's House, and
when not long after, the Common Council of London presented a Petition to his
Majesty, for reparation of those injuries, his Majesty's Answer was (without
hearing the proof of the complainants) that if any Citizen were wounded or ill
entreated, his Majesty was confidently assured, that it happened by their own
evil and corrupt demeanors.

We hope it cannot be thought contrary to the du^y and wisdom of a
Parliament, if many concurring and frequently reitterated and renewed
advertizements from Rome, Venice, Paris, and other parts, if the solicitation
of the Popes Nuntio and our own discontented fugitives, do make us jealous
and watchful for the safety of the State. And We have been very careful to
make our expressions thereof, so easy and so plain, to the capacity and
understanding of the people, that nothing might justly stick with them, with
reflection upon the Person of his Majesty. Wherein We appeal to the judgment
of any indifferent person, who shall read and peruse our own Words.

We must maintain the ground of our fears, to be of that moment, that We
cannot discharge the trust and duty which lies upon us, unless We do apply
our selves to the use of those means, to which the Law has enabled us in
cases of this nature, for the necessary defense of the Kingdom, and as his
Majesty does graciously declare the Law shall be the Measure of his power, so
do We most heartily profess, that We shall always make it the rule of our
obedience.

Prudent omissions in the Answer.
The next point of our Declaration was with much caution artificially passed
over by him who drew his Majesty's Answer, it being indeed the foundation of
all our misery and his Majesty's trouble, that he is pleased to hear general
taxes upon his Parliament, without any particular charge to which they may give
satisfaction, and that he has often conceived displeasure against particular
persons upon misinformation, and although those informations have bin clearly
proved to be false, yet he would never bring the accusers to question, which
lays an impossibility upon honest men of clearing themselves, and gives
encouragement unto false and unworthy persons to trouble him with untrue and
groundless informations. Three particulars we mentioned in our Declaration,
which the Penner of that Answer had good cause to omit: the words supposed to
be spoken at Kensington, the pretended Articles against the Queen, and the
groundless accusation of the six Members of the Parliament, there being
nothing to be said in defense or denial of any of them

Concerning his M^^^sties desire to join with his Parliament, and with his
faithful Subjects in defense of Religion, and public good of the Kingdom; we
doubt not but he will do it fully when evil Counselors shall be removed from
about him, and until, that be, as we showed before of words, so must we also
say of Law^^, that they cannot secure us; witness the Petition of Right, which
was followed with such an inundation of illegal taxes that we had ^ust cause
to think that the payment of eight hundred and twenty thousand pounds was an
easy burden to the Commonwealth in exchange of them, and we cannot but
justly think that if there be a continuance of such ill Cou^sel^ors and favor
to them, they will by some wicked device or other, make the Bill for the
Trien(...) Parliament, and those other excellent Laws mentioned in his
Majesty's Declaration, of less value then words.

That excellent Bill for the continuance of this Parliament was so necessary,
that without it we could not have raised so great sums of money for the (...) of
his Majesty and the Commonwealth as we have done and without which the ruin
and destruction of the Kingdom must needs have followed. And we are resolved,
the gracious favor of his Majesty expressed in that Bill, and the advantage
and security which thereby we have from being dissolved shall not encourage us
to do any thing, which otherwise had not been fit to have been done. And we
are ready to make it good before all the world, that although his Majesty, has
passed man^ Bills very advantageous for the Subject yet in none of them have we
bereaved his Majesty of any just, necessary, or profitable Prerogative of the
Crown.

We so earnestly desire his Majesty's return to London that upon it, we
conceive depends the very safety and being of both his Kingdoms. And therefore
we must protest, that as for the time past, neither the government of London,
nor any Laws of the Land, have lost their life and force for his security; So
for the future, we shall be ready to do or say anything that nay stand with
the duty or honor of a Parliament, which may raise a mutual confidence
betwixt his Majesty and us, as we do wish, and as the affairs of the
Kingdom do require.

Thus far the Answer to that which is called his Majesty's Declaration has led
us, now we come to that which is Entitled his Majesty's Answer to the Petition
of both Houses, presented to him at York. the 26 of March, 1642. In the
beginning whereof, his Majesty wishes that (...) Privileges on all parts we
so Stired, that this way of correspondency might be preserved, with that
freedom which has been used of old; we know nothing introduced by us, that
gives any impediment hereunto, neither have we affirmed our Privileges to be
broken, when his Majesty denies us any thing, or gives a reason why he cannot
grant it, or that those who advised such denial were enemies to the peace of
the Kingdom, and favorers of the Irish Rebellion, in which aspersion, that is
turned into a general asersion, which in our Votes is applied to a particular
case, wherefore we must maintain our Votes, that those who advised his Majesty
to contradict that which in both Houses in the Question concernig the Militia,
had declared to be Law, and command it should not be obeyed, is a high breach
of privilege, and that those who advised his Majesty to absent himself from
his Parliament, are enemies to the peace of the Kingdom, and justly to be
suspected to be favorers of the Rebellion in Ireland the reasons of both are
evident, because in the first, there is as great a derogation from the trust
and authority of Parliament; and in the second, as much advantage to the
proceedings and hopes of the Rebels, as may be, and we hold it a very
causeless imputation upon the Parliament, that we have herein any way
impeacht, much less taken away the freedom of his Majesty's Vote, which does
not import a liberty for his Majesty to deny any thing, how necessary soever
for the preservation of the Kingdom, much less a License to evil
Counselors, to advise any thing though never so destructive to his Majesty,
and his people.

By the Message of the twentieth of January, his Majesty did propound to both
Houses of Parliament, that they would with all speed fall into a serious
consideration of all those particulars which they thought necessary as well for
the upholding and maintaining his Majesty's just and Regal authority, and for
the settling his Revenue, as for the present and future establishing our
Privileges, the free and quiet enjoying our estates, the Liberties of our
Persons, the security of the true Religion professed in the Church of England,
and the settling of Ceremonies in such a manner as may take away all just
offense, and to dig^st it into one entire body.

To that point of upholding and maintaining his Royal authority, We say
nothing has been done to the prejudice of it, that should require any new
provision; To the other of settling the revenue, the Parliament has no way
abridged or disordered his just revenue, but it is true that much wast and
confusion of his Majesty's estate has been made by those evil and
unfaithful Ministers whom he has employed in the managing of it, whereby his
own ordinary expenses would have been disappointed, and the safety of the
Kingdom more endangered, if the Parliament had not in some measure provided
for his Household, and for some of the Forts, more then they were bound to do,
and they are still willing to settle such a revenue upon his Majesty as may
make him live Royally, plentifully and safely, but they cannot in wisdom and
fidelity to the Commonwealth, do this, till he shall choose such Counselors
and Officers as may order and dispose it to the pablicke good, and not apply it
to the ruin and destruction of his people as heretofore it has been, but
this and the other matters concerning Our selves, being works of great
importance, and full of intricacie, will require so long a time of
deliberation, that the Kingdom might be ruined before We should effect them,
wherefore We thought it necessary, first to be suitors to his Majesty so to
order the Militia, that the Kingdom being secured, We might with more case
and safety apply our selves to debate of that Message wherein We have been
interrupted by his Majesty's denial of the Ordinance concerning the same,
because it would have been in vain for Us to labor in other things, and in
the mean time to leave our selves naked to the malice of so many enemies, both
at home and abroad, yet We have not been altogether negligent of those things
which his Majesty is pleased to propound in that Message, We have agreed upon
a Book of Rates in a larger Proportion then has been granted to any of his
Majesty's Predecessors, which is a considerable support of his Majesty's
public charge, and have likewise prepared diverse Propositions and Bills for
preservation of our Religion and liberties, which We intend shortly to present
to his Majesty, and to do whatsoever is fit for Us to make up this unpleasant
breach betwixt his Majesty and the Parliament.

Whereas diverse exceptions are here taken concerning the Militia, first, that
his Majesty, never denied the thing, but accepted the persons, (except for
Corporations) only that he denied the way, to which We answer, that that
exception takes off London, and all other great Towns and Cities, which makes
a great part of the Kingdom, and for the way of Ordinance it is ancient, more
speedy, more easily alterable, and in all these and other respects, more proper
and more applicable to the present occasion, then a Bil, which his Majesty
calls the only good old way of imposing upon the subjects, It should seem that
neither his Majesty's Royal Predecessors, nor our Ancestors, have heretofore
been of that opinion, 37 Ed. 3. We find this Record: the Chauncelour made
declaration of ^he Challenge of the Parliament, the King desires to know the
griefs of his Subjects, and to redress inormities, The last day of the
Parliament the King demanded of the whole Estates, whether they would have such
things as they agreed on, by way of Ordinance or Statute, who Answered by way
of Ordinance, for that they might amend the same at their pleasures, and so it
was.

But his Majesty objects further, that there is somewhat in the preface, to
which he could not consent with Justice, to his honor and innocence, and that
thereby he is excluded from any power in the disposing of it: these objections
may seem somewhat, but indeed will appear nothing, when it shall be
considered, that nothing in the Preamble lays any charge upon his Majesty, or
in the body of the Ordinance, that excludes his Royal Authority in the
disposing or execution of it, But only it is provided that it should be
signified by both Houses of Parliament, as that channel through which it will
be best derived, and most certainly, to those ends for which it is intended,
and let all the world judge, whether We have not reason to insist upon it,
that the strength of the Kingdom should rather be ordered according to the
direction or advice of the great Council of the Land, equally entrusted by the
King and by the Kingdom, then that the safety of the King, Parliament and
Kingdom should be left at the devotion of a few unknown Counselors, many
of them not entrusted at all by the King in any public way, nor at all
consided in by the Kingdom.

We wish the danger were not imminent, or not still continuing, but cannot
conceive that the long time spent in this debate is evidence sufficient, that
there was no such necessity or danger, but a Bill might easily have bin
prepared, for when many causes do concur to the danger of a State, the
interruption of any one may hinder the execution of the rest, and yet the
design be still kept on foot for better oportunities: who knows whether the
ill success of the Rebels in Ireland has not hindered the insurrection of the
Papists here? whether the preservation of the six Members of the Parliament,
falsely accused, has not prevented that plot of the breaking the neck of the
Parliament, of which we were informed from France, not long before they were
accused? yet since his Majesty has bin pleased to express his pleasure,
rather for a Bill then an Ordinance, and that he sent in one for that purpose,
we readily entertained it, and with some small and necessary alterations,
speedily passed the same: But contrary to the custom of Parliament, and our
expectation grounded upon his Majesty's own invitation of us to that way, and
the other reasons manifested in our Declaration, concerning the Mili^ia, of the
fifth of May, instead of his Royal assent, we met with an absolute refusal.

If the matter of these our Votes, 15, and 16 of March, be according to Law, we
hope his Majesty will allow the Subjects to be bound by them, because he has
said he will make the Law the Rule of his Power, and if the question be whether
that be Law which the Lords and Commons have once declared to be so, who shall
be the Judge? Not his Majesty, for the King judges not of matters of Law, but
by his Courts, and his Courts, though sitting by his authority, expect not his
Assent in matters of Law, not any other Courts, for they cannot Judge in that
case because they are Inferior, no appeal lying to them from Parliament, the
Judgment whereof is in the eye of the Law, the Kings Judgment in his highest
Court, though the King in his person be neither present nor assenting thereunto.

The Votes at which his Majesty takes exceptions are these*

I.

That the Kings absence so far remote from the Parliament, is not only an
obstruction, but may be a destruction to the Affairs of Ireland.

II.

That when the Lords and Commons shall declare what the Law of the Land is, to
have this not only questioned, and controverted, but contradicted, and a
command that it should not be obeyed, is a high breach of the privilege of
Parliament.

III.

That those persons that advised his Majesty to absent himself from the
Parliament, are enemies to the Peace of the Kingdom, and justly may be
suspected to be favorers of the Rebellion in Ireland.

That the Kingdom has bin of late, and still is in so eminent danger both
from enemies abroad, and a Popish and discontented party at home, that there
is an urgent and inevitable necessity of putting his Majesty's subjects into a
posture of defense, for the safeguard both of his Majesty, and his people,

That the Lords and Commons fully apprehending this danger, and being sensible
of their own dury, to provide a suitable prevention, have in several Petitions
addressed themselves to his Majesty, for the ordering and disposing the Mi^itia
of the Kingdom, in such a way as was agreed upon by the wisdom (...) House
to be most effectual and proper for the present exigents of the Kingdom, yet
could not obtain it, but his Majesty did several times refuse to give his
Royal Assent thereunto.

That in this case of extreme danger, and his Majesty's refusal the Ordinance
of Parliament agreed upon by both Houses for the Militia, does obliege the
people, and ought to be obeyed ny the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom.

By all which it does appear that there is no Color of this Ta^, that we go
about to introduce a new Law, much less to exercise an arbitrary power, but
indeed to prevent it, for this Law is as old as the Kingdom. That the Kingdom
must not be without a mean^s to preserve it self, which that it may be done
without confusion this Nation has entrusted certain hands with a Power to
provide in an orderly and regular way, for the good and safety of the whole,
which power, by the Constitution of this Kingdom, is in his Majesty, and in
his Parliament together, yet since the Prince being but one person, is more
subject to a^cidents of nature and chance, whereby the Commonwealth may b^e
deprived of the fruit of that trust which was in part reposed in him, in cases
of such necessity, that the Kingdom may not be enforced presently to return
to its first principle, and every man left to do what i^ aright in his own eye,
without either guide or rule, The Wis^dome of this State has entrusted the
Houses of Parliament with a power to supply what shall be wanting on the part
of the Prince, as is evident by the constant custom and practice thereof; in
cases of nonage, natural disability, and captivity, and the like reason does
and must hold for the exercise of the same power in such cases, where the
Royal trust cannot be, or is not discharged, and that the Kingdom runs an
evident and imminent danger thereby* which danger, having been declared by the
Lords and Commons in Parliament, there needs not the authority of any person or
Court to affirm; nor is it in the power of any person or Court to revoke that
judgment.

We know the King has ways enough in his ordinary Courts of justice to punish
such seditious Pamphlets and Sermons as are any way prejudicial to his Rights,
Honor, and authority; and if any of them have been so insolently violated and
vilified, his Majesty's own Council and Officers have been too blame, and not
the Parliament; we never did restrain any proceedings of that kind in other
Courts, nor refuse any fit complaint to us. The Protestation Protested was
referred by the Commons House to a Committee, and the Author being not
produced, the Printer committed to prison, and the Book voted by that
Committee, to be burnt; but Sir Edward Dcering who was to make that report of
the Votes of that Committee, neglected to make it; The Apprentizes Protestation
was never complained of, but the other seditious Pamphlet, To your Tents oh
Israel was once questioned and the full prosecution of it was not interrupted
by any fault of either House, whose forwardness to do his Majesty all right,
therein may plainly appear, in that a Committee of Lords and Commons was
purposely appointed to take such informations as the Kings Council should
present, concerning seditious words, practices or tumults, Pamphelets or
Sermons, tending to the derogation of his Majesty's Rights, or Prerogative; and
his Council were enjoined by that Committee, to enquire and present them, who
several times met thereupon, and received this Answer and Declaration from the
Kings Council, that they knew of no such thing as yet.

If his Majesty had used the service of such a one in penning this Answer, who
understood the Laws, and government of this Kingdom, he would not have
thought it legally in his power to deny his Parliament a guard, when they stood
in need of it, since every ordinary Court has it; neither would his Majesty,
if he had been well informed of the Laws, have refused a guard as they
desired, it being in the power of inferior Courts to command their own guard,
neither would he have imposed upon them such a guard under a Commander, which
they could not confide in; which is clearly against the Privileges of
Parliament, and of which they found very dangerous effects, and therefore
desired to have it discharged; But such a guard and so commanded, as the Houses
of Parliament desired, they could never obtain of his Majesty, and the placing
of a guard about them contrary to their desire, was not to grant a guard to
them, but in effect to set one upon them: All which considered, we believe in
the judgments of any indifferent persons, it will not be thought strange if
there were a more then ordinary resort of people at Westminster, of such as
came willingly of their own accord to be witnesses and helpers of the safety
of them whom all his Majesty's good subjects are bound to defend from violence
and danger: or that such a concourse as this, they carrying themselves quietly
and peaceably (as they did) ought in his Majesty's apprehension, or can in the
interpretation of the Law, be held tumultuarie and seditious.

When ^as Majesty in that question of violation of the Laws had expressed the
observation of them indefinitely without any limitation of time, although we
never said or thought any thing that might look like a reproach to his
Majesty, yet we had reason to remember that it had been otherwise; lest we
should seem to desert our former Complaints and proceedings: thereupon as his
Majesty does seem but little to like or approve of them: for although he does
acknowledge here that great mischief that grew by that arbitrary power then
complained of, yet such are continually preferred and countenanced as were
friends or favorers, or related unto the chief Authors and Actors of that
Arbitrarie Power, and of those false colors, suggestions of imminent danger
and necessity, whereby they did make it plausible unto his Majesty; and on
the other side, such as did appear against them, are daily discountenanced and
disgraced: which whilst it shall be so, we have no reason to judge the disease
to be yet killed and dead at root; and therefore no reason to bury it in
oblivion. And whilst we behold the Spawnes of those mischievous Principles,
cherisht and fostered in that new generation of Councillors, friends and
Abettors of the former, or at least concurring with them in their malignancie
against the proceedings of this Parliament, we cannot think our selves secure
from the like or a worse danger.

And here the Penner of this Answer bestows an admonition upon the Parliament,
bidding us take heed we fall not upon the same error, upon the same
suggestions: but he might have well spared this, till he could have showed
wherein we had exercised any power otherwise then by the rule of the Law, or
could have found a more authentic or a higher Judge in matters of Law, then
the high Court of Parliament.

It is declared in his Majesty's name, that he is resolved to keep the rule
himself, and to his power to require the same of all others: we must needs
acknowledge that such a resolution is like to bring much happiness and
blessing to his Majesty, and all his Kingdoms; yet with humility we must
confess, we have not the fruit of it, in that Case of my Lord Kimbolton, and
the other five Members accused contrary to Law, both Common Law, and the
Statute Law, and yet remains unsatisfied; which Case was remembered in our
Declaration as a strange and unheard of violation of our Laws: But the Penner
of this Answer thought fit to pass it over, hoping that many would read his
Majesty's Answer, which has been so carefully dispersed, which would not read
our Declaration.

Whereas after our ample thanks, and acknowledgement of his Majesty's favor in
passing many good Bills, we said that truth and necessity enforced us to add
this, that in or about the time of passing those Bills, some design or other
has been a foot; which if it had taken effect, would not only have deprived
us of the fruit of those Bills, but would have reduced us to a worse condition
of confusion, then that wherein the Parliament found us. It is now told us that
the King must be most sensible of what we cast upon him, for requital of those
good Bills, whereas out of our usual Tenderness of his Majesty's Honor, we
did not mention him at all: but so injurious are those wicked Councillors to
the name and Honor of their Master and Sovereign, that as much as they can
they lay their own infamy and guilt upon his Shoulders.

Here God also is called to witness His Majesty's upright intentions at the
passing of those Laws; this we will not question, neither did we give any
occasion of such a solemn asseveration as this is: The devil is likewise
defied to prove there was any defigne with His Majesty's knowledge or privitie;
This might well have been spared, for we spoke nothing of his Majesty; But
since we are so far taxed as to have it affirmed that we laid a notorious and
false imputation upon His Majesty, we have thought it necessary for the just
defense of our own innocence, to cause the oaths and examinations which have
been taken concerning the design to be published in a full Narration, for
satisfaction of all His Majesty's subjects, out of which we shall now offer
some few particulars, whereby the world may judge whether we could have
proceeded with more tenderness toward His Majesty then we have done. Master
Goreing confesses, that the King first asked him whether he were engaged in
any Caball concerning the Army, and commanded him to join with Master Piercy
and Master Jermyn, and some other whom they should find within at Master
Peircy's Chamber, where they took the oath of secrecy, and then debated of a
design propounded by Master Jermyn to secure the Tower, and to consider of
bringing up the Army to London, and Captain Leg confessed, he had received the
draught of a Petition in the Kings presence, and His Majesty acknowledges it
was from His own hand; and whosoever reads the sum of that Petition, as it
was proved by the Testimony of Sir Jacob Ashley, Sir John Conyers, and Captain
Leg, will easily perceive some points in it apt to beget in them some
discontent against the Parliament. And can any man believe there was no design
in the accusation of the Lord Kimbolton and the rest, in which His Majesty
does avow himself to be both a Commander and an Actor: these things being so,
it will easily appear to be as much against the rules of Prudence, that the
Penner of this Answer should entangle His Majesty in this unnecessarie
Apology; as it is against the rules of Justice, that any reparation from us
should be either yielded, or demanded.

It is professed in His Majesty's name, that he is truly sensible of the
Burdens of His people, which makes us hope that he will take that course which
will be most effectual to ease them of these burdens, that is, to join with
his Parliament in preserving the peace of the Kingdom, which by his absence
from them has been much endangered, and which by hindering the voluntary
Adventures for recovery of Ireland, and disabling the Subjects to discharge the
great tax laid upon them, is like to make the war much more heavy to the
Kingdom. And for His Majesty's wants, the Parliament have been no cause of
them, we have not diminished His just Revenue, but have much eased His public
Charge, and somewhat his private. And we shall be ready, in a Parliamentary
way, to settle His revenue in such an Honorable proportion, as may be
answerable to both, when he shall put himself into such a posture of
Government, that His Subjects may be secure to enjoy His just protection, for
their Religion, Laws, and Liberties.

We never refused His Majesty's gracious offer of a free and General Pardon,
only we said it could be no security to our present fears and jealousies: And
we gave a reason for it, that those fears did not arise out of any guilt of our
own Actions, but out of the evil designs and attempts of others; and we leave
it to the world to judge, whether we herein have deserved so heavy a Tax and
exclamation (that it was a strange world when Princes proffered favors are
counted reproaches, such are the words of His Majesty's Answer) who do esteem
that offer as an Act of Princely grace and bounty, which since this Parliament
began we have humbly desired we might obtain and do still hold it very
necessary and advantageous for the generality of the Subject, upon whom these
Taxes and Subsidies lie heaviest, but we see upon every occasion how unhappie
we are in His Majesty's misapprehensions of our words and actions.

We are fully of the Kings mind as it is here declared, that he may rest so
secure of the affections of His Subjects, that he should not stand in need of
foreign force to preserve him from oppression, and are confident that he
shall never want an abundant evidence of the good wishes and assistance of His
whole Kingdom, especially if he shall be pleased to hold to that gracious
resolution of building upon that sure foundation, the Law of the Land: but why
His Majesty should take it ill, that we having received informations so deeply
concerning the safety of the Kingdom, and should think them fit to be
considered of, we cannot conceive; for although the name of the person was
unknown, yet that which was more substantial to the probability of the Report
was known (that is) That he was servant to the Lord Digby, who in his
presumptuous Letter to the Queens Majesty, and other Letters to Sir Lewis
Dives, had intimated some wicked Proposition suitable to that Information, but
that this should require reparation, we hold it as far from Justice as it is
from truth, that we have mixed any malice with these rumors, thereby to feed
the fears and jealousies of the People.

It is affirmed his Majesty is driven (but not by us yet) from us, perchance
hereafter if there be opportunity of gaining more credit, there will not be
wanting who will suggest unto his Majesty, that it is done by us. And if his
Majesty were driven from us, we hope it was not by his own fears, but by
the fears of the Lord Digbie, and his retinue of Cavaliers, and that no fears
of any Tumultuary violence, but of their just punishment for their manifold
insolence and intended violence against the Parliament. And this is expressed
by the Lord Digby himself, when he told those Cavaliers, that the principal
cause of his Majesty's going out of Town was to save them from being trampled
in the dirt; but of his Majesty's person there was no cause of fear in the
greatest heat of the peoples indignation after the accusation, and his
Majesty's violent coming to the House, there was no show of any evil
intention against his Regal Person, of which there can be no better evidence
then this, that he came the next day without a Guard into the City, where he
heard nothing but Prayers and Petitions, no threatenings or irreverent speeches,
that might give him any just occasion of fear, that we have heard of, or that
his Majesty expressed; for he stayed near a week after at White Hall, in a
secure and peaceable condition, whereby we are induced to believe, that there
is no difficulty nor doubt at all, but his Majesty's residence near London
may be as safe as in any part of the Kingdom: We are most assured of the
faithfulness of the City and Suburbs; And for our selves we shall quicken
the vigor of the Laws, the industry of the Magistrate, the authority of
Parliament, for the suppressing of all tumultuary insolences whatsoever, and
for the vindicating of his Honor from all insupportable and insolent
scandalls, if any such shall be found to be raised upon him, as are mentioned
in this Answer, and therefore we think it altogether unnecessary and
exceeding inconvenient to adjourne the Parliament to any other place.

Where the desire of a good understanding betwixt the King and the Parliament,
is on both parts so earnest as is here professed of his Majesty to be in him,
and we have sufficiently testified to be in our selves, it seems strange we
should be so long asunder, it can be nothing else but evil and malicious
Council, misrepresenting our carriage to him, and in disposing his favor to
us, and as it shall be far from us to take any advantage of his Majesty's
supposed straits, as to desire much less to compel him to that which his
Honor or interest may render unpleasant and grievous to him, so we hope that
his Majesty will not make his own understanding or reason the rule of his
Government, but will suffer himself to be assisted with a wise and prudent
Council, that may deal faithfully betwixt him and his people; And that he
will remember that his resolutions do concern Kingdoms, and therefore ought
not to be molded by his own, much less by any other private person, which is
not alike proportionable to so great a trust, and therefore we still desire and
hope that his Majesty will not be guided by his own understanding, or to
think those Courses straights and necessities, to which he shall be advised by
the Wisdom of both Houses of Parliament; which are the Eyes in this Politic
Body, whereby his Majesty is by the Constitution of this Kingdom to discern
the differences of those things which concern the public peace and safety
thereof.

We have given his Majesty no cause to say, that we do meanly value the
discharge of His public duty, whatsoever Acts of Grace or Justice have been
done, they proceeded from his Majesty by the advice and Council of his
Parliament; yet we have and shall always answer them with constant gratitude,
obedience, and affection; and although many things have been done since this
Parliament of another nature, yet we shall not cease to desire the continued
protection of Almighty God upon His Majesty. And most humbly Petition him to
cast from him all those evil and contrary Counsels which have in many
particulars formerly mentioned, much detracted from the Honor of his
Government, the happiness of his own Estate, and prosperity of his people.

And having past so many dangers from abroad, so many Conspiracies at home, and
brought on the public work so far, through the greatest difficulties that
ever stood in opposition to a Parliament, to such a degree of success, that
nothing seems to be left in our way able to hinder the full accomplishment of
our desires and endeavors for the public good; unless God in his justice,
do send such a grievous Curse upon us, as to turn the strength of the Kingdom
against it self, and to effect that by their own folly and credulity, which
the Power and Subtlety of their and our enemies could not attain, That is, to
divide the people from the Parliament, and to make them serviceable to the ends
and aims of those, who would destroy them. Therefore we desire the Kingdom
to take notice of this last most desperate and mischievous Plott of the
malignant party, that is acted and prosecuted in many parts of the Kingdom,
under plausible Notions, of stirring them up to a care of preserving the Kings
Prerogative, maintaining the Discipline of the Church, upholding and continuing
the reverence and solemnity of Gods Service, encouraging of Learning. And upon
these grounds, diverse mutinous Petitions have been framed in London, Kent, and
other Counties, and sundry of his Majesty's Subjects have been solicited to
declare themselves for the King, against the Parliament: and many false and
foul aspersions have been cast upon our proceedings, as if we had been not
only negligent, but averse in these points: whereas we desire nothing more,
then to maintain the purity and power of Religion, and to Honor the King in
all His just Prerogatives: and for encouragement and advancement of piety and
learning, we have very earnestly endeavored, and still do to the uttermost
of our Power, that all Parishes may have learned, pious, and sufficient
Preachers, and all such Preachers competent Livings.

Many other Bills and Propositions are in preparation for the Kings Profit and
Honor, the peoples safety and prosperity, In the proceedings whereof, we
are much hindered by His Majesty's absence from the Parliament, which is
altogether contrary to the use of his Predecessors, and the Privileges of
Parliament, whereby ou^ time is consumed by a multitude of unnecessary
Messages, and our innocence wounded by causeless and sharp invectives. Yet
we doubt not, but we shall overcome all this at last, if the people suffer
not themselves to be deluded with false and specious shows, and so drawn to
betray us to their own undoing, who have ever been willing to hazard the
undoing of our selves, that they might not be betrayed by our neglect of the
trust reposed in us, but if it were possible, they should prevail herein, yet
we would not fai^e through Gods grace still to persist in our duties, and to
look beyond our own lives, estates, and advantages, as those who think
nothing worth the enjoying without the liberty, peace, and safety of the
Kingdom: not any thing too good to be hazarded in discharge of our Consciences,
for the obtaining of it; And shall always repose our selves upon the
Protection of Almighty God; which we are confident shall never be wanting to
us (while we seek his glory) as we have* found it hitherto, wonderfully
going along with us in all our proceedings.

IT is his Majesty's pleasure that you forthwith Print in very good Paper, and
send unto me, for his Majesty's Service, forty Copies of the Proclamation
enclosed, leaving a convenient space for his Majesty to sign above, and to
affix the Privy Signet underneath: And his Majesty's express Command is, that
you Print not above the said number of forty Copies, and forbear to make any
further publication of them, till his pleasure be further signified, for which
this shall be your Warrant.

Whitehall 2. January, 1641. Edw. Nicholas. For His Majesty's Printer.

The Examination of Colonel Goring, taken June 19. 1641.
HE says, To the first Int.
That in Lent last (as he remembers) about the middle of it, Sir John Suckling
came to him on Sunday morning as he was in his bed: And this Examinate
conceiving he had come to him about some business of money that was between
them; and thereupon falling upon that discourse, Sir John Suckling told him he
was then come about another business, which was to acquaint him, That there
was a purpose of bringing the Army to London, And that my Lord of New Castle
was to be General, and he this Examinate, Lieutenant General, if he would
accept of it. And further said, That he should hear more of this business at
Court: to which this Examinate answered only this, Well, then I will go to the
Court; which was all that passed between them at that time, to the best of this
Examinates remembrance.

To the second, He cannot depose.

To the third, He says, That as he was coming in his Coach in the street, out
of the Covent Garden into St Martins Lane, he met there Mr Henry Jermyn, who
was likewise in a Coach; and seeing this Examinate, sent his Footman to him,
desiring him to follow him, because he would speak with him; which this
Examinate did: And Mr Jermyn going a little further, alighted, and went into a
house (to which house, as this examinate was but yesterday in formed, Sir John
Suckling did then usually resort) and thither this Examinate followed him; and
coming after him to the top of the Seayr^s, Mr Jermyn said to him, He had
somewhat to say to him concerning the Army, but that this was no fit place to
speak of it, and desired him to meet him that evening at the Court, on the
Queens side; which this Examinate accordingly did; and meeting Mr Jermyn in the
Queens drawing Chamber, he was there told by him, That the Queen would speak
with him, and thereupon Mr Jermyn brought him into the Queens Bedchamber: But
before this Examinate could enter into any discourse with the Queen, the King
came in, and then this Examinate did withdraw, and went away for that time, but
returned again the same night, and met Mr Jermyn again on the Queens side, who
told him that he must necessarily meet with some Officers of the Army, to hear
some Propositions concerning the Army. The next day, being Monday, this
Examinate came again to the Court in the afternoon, and went into the Queens
drawing-Chamber, ^here Her Majesty then was, who was pleased to tell him that
the King would speak with him, and bade him repair to the room within the
Gallery, into which Room the King soon after came; and His Majesty asked him if
he was engaged in any Cabale concerning the Army: to which he answered, That he
was not: whereupon His Majesty replied, I command you then to join your self
with Peircy, and some others whom you will find with him. And His Majesty
likewise said, I have a desire to put my Army into a good posture, and am
advised unto it by my Lord of Bristoll: which was the effect of what passed
between the King and this Examinate at that time. This Examinate meeting
afterward with Mr Jermyn, Mr Jermyn told him that they were to meet that
evening at nine of the Clock with Mr Peircy, and some others, at Mr Peircyes
Chamber; and accordingly Mr Jermyn and he went thither together, and there
found Mr Peircy himself, Mr Wilmot, Mr Ashburnham, Mr Pollard, Mr Oneal, and
Sir John Bartley; Mr Peircy then in the first place tendered an Oath to this
Examinate and Mr Jermyn, the rest saying they had taken that Oath already: this
Oath was prepared in writing, and was to this effect, That they should neither
directly nor indirectly disclose any thing of that which should be then said
unto them, nor think themselves absolved from the secrecy enjoined by this
Oath, by any other Oath which should be afterward taken by them: They having
taken the Oath, Mr Peircy declared, That they were were resolved not to admit
of any body else into their Counsels: And Mr Jermyn and this Examinate moved
that Sir John Suckling might be received amongst them; which being opposed by
the rest, after some debate, it was laid aside: And some speech there was of
Sir John Suckling his being employed in the Army; but how it was agreed upon,
this Examinate does not remember.

After this, Mr Piercy made his Propositions, which he read out of a paper,
which were to this effect, That the Army should presently be put into a posture
to serve the King, and then should send up a Declaration to the Parliament, of
these particulars, viz. That nothing should be done in Parliament contrary to
any former Act of Parliament, which was explayned, That Bishops should be
maintained in their Votes and Functions, And the Kings Revenue be established.
From these Propositions none of Mr Percyes Company did declare themselves to
dissent. Then came into consideration, if the Army should not immediately be
brought to London, which, as this Examinate remembers, was first propounded by
Mr Jermyn, and also the making sure of the Tower. These things this Examinate
did urge, to show the vanity and danger of the other Propositions, without
undertaking this. In the conclusion, this Examinate did protest against his
having any thing to do in either design; for the proof of which, he appeals to
the consciences of them that were present, and so parted with them. About this
business this Examinate says, That they had two meetings, and cannot
distinguish what passed at the one, and what at the other, but the result of
all was as he formerly declared: further then which, he cannot depose.

To the fourth Int. He can say no more then he has already said.

To the fifth Int. He says, That the very day that Sir John Suckling first
moved this unto him, he gave some touch of it to my Lord Dungarvan: and the day
after his second meeting at Mr Peircyes Chamber, he discovered it to my Lord of
Newport, and defined him to bring him to some other Lords, such as might be
likeliest to prevent all mischief: And accordingly the next day my Lord of
Newport brought him to my Lord of Bedford, my Lord Say, and my Lord Mandevill,
to whom he imparted the main of the business, but not the particulars, in
regard of his Oath; and desired them to make use of it as they should see
cause, for the safety of the Commonwealth, but not to produce him, nor name
any person, except there were a necessity for it. He further says, That he did
at the same time make a Protestation unto those Lords, of his fidelity unto the
Commonwealth, and of his readiness to run all hazards for it.

George Goring.

Master PERCIES LETTER written to the Earl of NORTHUMBERLAND, June 14th. 1641.
WHat with my own innocence and the violence I hear is against me, I find my
self much distracted, I will not ask your council, because it may bring
prejudice upon you; but I will with all faithfulness and truth tell you what
my part has been, that at least I may be cleared by you whatsoever becomes of
me.

When there was 50000 pound designed by the Parliament for the English Army,
there was as I take it a sudden demand made by the Scots at the same time of
25000 pound, of which there was but 15000 pound ready, this they pressed with
so much necessity as the Parliament after an Order made, did think it fit for
them to deduct 10000 pound out of the fifty formerly granted, upon which, the
soldiers in our house were more scandalized, amongst which I was one, and
sitting by Wilmott and Ashburnham, Wilmott stood up and told them, if such
papers as that of the Scots would procure moneys, he doubted not but the
Officers of the English Army might easily do the like, but the first order was
reversed notwithstanding, and the 10000 pound give to the Scots; this was the
cause of many discourses of dislike amongst us, and came to this purpose, that
they were disobliged by the Parliament; and not by the King, this being said
often one to another, we did resolve, that is, Wilmott, Ashburnham, Pollard,
Oneale, and my self to make some expression of serving the King in all things
he would command us, that were honorable for him and us, being likewise
agreeable to the fundamental laws of the kingdom, that so far we should
live and dye with him. This was agreed upon by us, not having any communication
with others, that I am coupled now withal; and further, by their joint consent
I was to tell his Majesty thus much from them; but withal I was to order the
matter so, as that the King might apprehend this as a great service done unto
him, at this time when his affairs were in so ill a condition, and they were
most confident that they could engage the whole Army thus far, but farther
they would undertake nothing, because they would neither infringe the liberties
of the Subject, or destroy the Laws, to which I and every one consented; and
having their sense, I drew the Heads up in a paper, to which they all approved
when I read it; and then we did by an oath promise to one another to be
constant and secret in all this, and did all of us take that oath together.
Well Sirs, I must now be informed what your particular desires are, that so I
may be the better able to serve you, which they were pleased to do, and I did
very faithfully serve them therein, as far as I could: this is the truth and
all the truth upon my soul. In particular discourses after that, we did fall
upon the petitioning the King and Parliament for money, there being so great
arreares due to us, and so much delays made in the procuring of them, but that
was never done.

The preserving of Bishops functions and votes.

The not disbanding of the Irish Army, until the Scots were disbanded too.

The endeavoring to settle his revenew to that proportion it was formerly, and
it was resolved by us all, if the King should require our assistance in these
things, that as far as we could, we might contribute thereunto without
breaking the Laws of the kingdom, and in case the King should deny these
things being put to them, we would not fire from him.

All these persons did act and concur in this as well as I. This being all
imparted to the King by me from them, I perceived he had been treated with by
others concerning something of our Army, which did not agree with what we
proposed, but inclined a way more high and sharp not having limits either of
Honor or Law, I told the King he might be pleased to consider with himself,
which way it was fit for him to hearken unto. For us, we were resolved not to
depart from our grounds, and if he employed others we should not be displeased
whosoever they were: but the particulars of their design, or the persons, we
desired not to know, though it was no hard matter to guess at them; in the end
I believe the dangers of the one, and the justice of the other, made the King
tell me he would leave all thoughts of other propositions but ours, as things
not practicable, but desired notwithstanding that Goring and ^ermine, who were
acquainted with the other proceedings, should be admitted amongst us* I told
him, I thought the other Gentlemen would never consent to it, but I would
propose it; which I did, and we were all much against it; but the King did
press it so much, as at the last, it was consented unto, and Goring and
jermine came to my chamber, there I was appointed to tell them, after they had
sworn to secrecy, what we had proposed which I did: but before I go on to the
debate of the ways, I must tell you, Mr. Jermine and Goring were very earnest
Suckling should be admitted, which we did all decline; and I was desired by all
our men to be resolute in it, which I was, and gave many reasons; whereupon I
remember M. Goring made answer, he was so engaged with Suckling* he could not
go or do any thing without him. Yet in the end, so that we would not oppose
Suckling his being employed in the Army, that for his meeting with us they were
contented to pass it by. Then we took up again, the ways were proposed,
which took a great debate, and theirs ((...) will say) differed from ours in
violence, and height, which we all protested against and parted, disagreeing
totally; yet remitting it to be spoken of by me, and Jermine, to the King which
we both did. And the King constant to his former resolution told him, that all
those ways were vain and foolish, and would think of them no more. I omitted
one thing of M. Goring, he desired to know, how the chief Commanders were to
be disposed of, for if he had not a condition worthy of him, he would not go
along with us, we made answer that no body had thought of that, we intending if
we were sent down, to go all in the same capacity we were in, he did not like
that by no means, and upon that did work so by M. Chidley, that there was a
Letter sent by some of the Commanders to make him Lieutenant General: and when
he had ordered this matter at London, and M. Chidley had his instructions, then
did he go to Portsmouth pretending to be absent when this was a working: we all
desired my Lord of Essex or my Lord of Holland, and they (if there were a
General) Newcastle, They were pleased to give out a report I should be
General of the Horse; but I protest, neither to the King or any else did I
ever so much as think of it: my Lord of Holland was made General and so all
things were laid aside: and this is the truth, and all the truth I know of all
these proceedings; and this I do and will protest upon my faith; and Wilmote,
Ashburnham, and Oneale, have at several times confessed and sworn, I never
said any thing in this business, they did not every one agree unto, and would
justify. This relation I send you, rather to inform you of the truth of the
matter, that you may know the better how to do me good: But I should think my
self very unhappy to be made a betrayer of any body; what concerned the Tower
or any thing else I never meddled withal, nor never spoke with Goring, but that
night before them all; and I said nothing but what was consented unto by all my
party. I never spoke one word to Suckling, Carnarvan, Davenant, or other
creature: me thinks if my friends and kindred knew the truth and justice of
this matter, it were no hard matter to serve me in some measure.

Die Martis 10. Maii, 1640. The Examination of Captain James Chudleigh.
To the first Interogatory, and to the second;

THis Deponent says, That about March and April last he was at Burrowbrig,
where diverse Officers and Commanders of the Army met, to whom he used some
speeches concerning the Parliament, that he saw no pr(...)lity that the Army
would be suddenly paid by the Parliament, because they had promised so much to
the King, and to the Scots, as well as to the Army; but that the King did
commiserate their case, and said, That if they would be faithful to him, he
would pawn his Jewels rather then they should be unpaid; and says further,
That he knows of such a Letter sent by the Army to my Lord of Northumberland,
to be showed to the Parliament; and that he told them at that meeting, that the
Parl* was much displeased with that Letter, and that those who had subscribed
it should be sent for up particularly, that my Lord of Essex, and my Lord of
Newport had expressed much dislike of that Letter, and of them who had sent it,
and said, that they had forfeited their necks: which he had from Sir John
Suckling, Master Davenant, and (as he conceives) from Sergeant Major Willis:
And this he declared to those Officers, as giving them an account of his
journey, and the service in which they had employed him.

To the third Interogatory;

He says he has answered before.

To the fourth Interogatory;

That Sergeant Major Willis told him upon the way, as they were in their
journey down into the North, that Colonel Goring was a brave Gentleman, and
fit to command the Army, and that the King had a good inclination to him, that
he should be Lieutenant General; and says further, that before he came out of
London, Sir John Suckling had likewise highly commended him, and said he was
fitter to command in chief, then any man he knew, and that the Army was not now
considerable, being without a head, and indeed was but a party (Colonel Goring
being away) who commanded a Brigado, and that they did undiscreetly to show
their teeth except they could bite, which the said Sir John Suckling wished him
to declare unto the Army, saying, He could not do a better service to the
Officers who had employed him, then to let them know it, whereupon he did
acquaint them with it accordingly.

To the fifth Interogatory;

That Sir John Suckling brought him into some-room of the Queens side at White
Hall, where Master Iermyn and he had private conference together, and
oftentimes looked toward this Deponent: Sir John Suckling afterward told him,
that the King would be well pleased if the Army would receive Colonel Goring
to be their Lieutenant General, and said that Master Henry lermyn said so.

To the sixth Interogatory;

That Master Davenant told him, that things were not here as they were
apprehended in the Army, for that the Parliament was so well affected to the
Scots, as that there was no likelihood the Army should have satisfaction so
soon as they expected it.

To the seventh Interogatory;

That when he brought the Letter from the Army, he met with Master Davenant,
who told him it was a matter of greater consequence then he imagined, and
thereupon brought him to Master Henry Iermyn, and Master Iermyn told him he
heard he brought such a Letter, and asked to see a copy of it, which this
Deponent did show unto him, and Master Iermyn asked if he might not show it
to the Queen, and offered to bring this Deponent to her, which he excused
himself of, lest he should have anticipated my Lord General from shevving the
Letter first himself.

To the eighth Interogatory;

That after he had brought up that Letter, he staid some 8 or 9 days in
London, before he returned down to the Army.

To the ninth Interogatory:

That Sergeant Major Willis told him most of the noble Gentlemen in England
would show themselves for the Army: And that the French that were about
London would receive Commanders from them, to join with them: And besides,
that there would a thousand horse likewise be raised to come to their
assistance, which horse at last he confessed were to be found by the Clergy.

To the tenth Interogatory;

That Sergeant Major Willis said moreover, that the Army would be very well
kept together, for that the Prince was to be brought thither, which would
confirm their affections: which this Deponent did declare at Burrovvbrig unto
the Officers, and does believe Willis did the like; and V(...)llis told them
also, that if my Lord of Newcastle was their General, he would feast them
in Nottinghamshire, and would not use them roughly, but that they should be
governed by a Council of war.

To the eleventh Inter.

That both Sergeant Major Willis and this Deponent, did persuade the Officers
at that meeting, to write a Letter to Colonel Goring, which was to let him
know, that they would heartily embrace him to be their Lieutenant General, if
it was his Majesty's pleasure to send him down, which Letter was subscribed by
Colonel Fielding and Colonel Vavasour, and diverse others; and was by him
brought to London upon Monday, where not finding Colonel Goring; ^he delivered
it to Sir John Sucklin, who carried it to the King, and afterward brought him
to kiss the King and Queens hand, and within a day or two returned the Letter
to him again, which Letter this Deponent the Saturday after carried down
himself to Colonel Goring to Portsmouth.

To the 12 Inter.

That there was likewise a Letter written to Mr. Endimion Porter, assigned by
Colonel William Vavasour and Colonel Fielding, which was to this effect, to
desire him to inform his Majesty, that the Army was very faithful to him,
and no doubt need be made by his Majesty concerning their proceedings. This
Letter Sir John Sucklin would not have to be delivered, but took it himself,
for that he said Mr. Porter knew nothing of the Kings intentions.

To the 14 Inter.

That when he came to Portsmouth, Colonel Goring showed him the strength of
that place, and told him, that if there should be any mutiny in London, the
Queen meant to come down thither for her safety, and that she had sent him
down money to fortify it.

To the 15 Inter.

That what he learned from Sergeant Major Willis, he got from him by degrees,
as he urged it from him by way of discourse; and that Willis, Sir John Sucklin,
and Mr. Davenant, did all of them give him great charge to keep things secret,
and to be very careful to whom he communicated any thing, which he accordingly
observed; for he dealt with the Officers there severally.

Die Martis 18 Maii. The second Examination of Cap. Chudleigh.
To the 31.

THat at the meeting at Burrowbrig, he declared unto the Officers some thing
out of a paper, which he read, and told them that he had received it from Mr.
Iermyn, and that Mr. Iermyn had received it from the King. And he said
likewise, that some others about the King were acquainted with it, and named
Mr. Endiuion Porter, to whom he thought the King had declared in this business^.

To the 34.

That Mr. Iermyn asked him. if he thought the Army would stick to their
Officers, in case the King and Parliament should not agree, or words to that
effect.

He says further, that he had set down all those things in writing, which he
declared to the Officers at Burrowbrig, and thought to have sent it down to
them; but upon better consideration he went himself* and read it to them out
of that paper, but severally, and not to them all together. And particularly,
that he read it to Lieutenant Colonel Ballard, and to Lieutenant Colonall
Lunsford, That he did not acquaint them all with it, and the reason why he did
not, was because he conceived some were of more judgment than others, and
fitter to be trusted with matters of secrecy.

The Examination of Thomas Ballard. Lieutenant Colonel to the Lord Grandison;
taken May 18. 1641.
To the 19.

THat he did meet at Burrowbridge, being sent to by Captain Chidley, and none
other; but he found there Sergeant Major Willis, and diverse other Officers of
the Army: this was sometime in April last, as he remembers.

That Mr. Chidley did propound to him certain propositions, which as he
affirmed, he did receive from Mr. Henry Iermyn, and from another great man
which he might not name. Captain Chidley further said, that M. Iermyn told him
that he received those propositions from the King: But Chidley told him
further, that when he kissed the Kings hand, his Majesty said nothing to him
of any such propositions. The first proposition was That he should not acquaint
either Sir Jacob Ashely, or Sir John Conyers, with any thing of this design.
The second, that if there were occasion, the Army should remove their Quarters
into Nottingham-shire, where the Prince and the Earl of New Castle should meet
them with a thousand Horse, and all the French that were in London should be
mounted, and likewise meet them. These propositions were read by Captain
Chidley, out of a paper, which he said he had written himself, thinking to
have sent them down; but upon better consideration he brought them down
himself. That they likewise should desire, that Colonel Gering should be the
Lievtenant-Generall to the Army: There was likewise offered a Paper to this
effect, as he was then told, That if the King would send Colonel Goring to be
Lievtenant-Generall, they would accept of him; which Paper he, this Examinant,
refused to read, or to set his hand to it: but heard that diverse others signed
it. He further says, that there was no other Paper propounded to him to be
signed, nor to any other to his knowledge. He further says, that this was not
delivered to the Officers in public, but severally.

He likewise says, That presently after Colonel Vavasour said publicly, that
he never consented to these propositions in his heart; and desired that there
might be a meeting immediately, whereupon they agreed upon a meeting at York
the Wednesday following, at which meeting they generally concluded, not to
interesse themselves in any of those designs that had been propounded to them
by Captain Chidley; and they presently writ by the Post to Captain Chidley to
London, that if he had not delivered the Paper, he should forbear to deliver
it.

Thomas Ballard.

The Examination of Captain Leg, taken May the 18. 1641.
To the 19 Inter.

HE says, That he heard of a meeting at Burro wbridge, but was not there
present, but was present at another meeting at York not long after, where he
was told that the King was not well satisfied with the affections of the
Officers to his service; and therefore it was thought fit, to make a
Declaration of their readiness to serve his Majesty; which declaration was
accordingly drawn, but not finding any great cause for it, it was after torn.
He further says, That the night before the meeting at Burrowbridge, he spoke
with Captain Chidley at York, who persuaded him to go to Burrowbridge, where
he had propositions to impart to the Army; but this Examinate refusing to go,
he would not acquaint him wi^h them at that time; but told them that diverse
Lords and Officers of the Army were fallen off from the King, naming the Fatle
of Essex, the Earl of Newport, Commiss^ry Wilm^tt Colonel Ashburnham, and
others, which this Examinate so much disliked, that they sorbore any further
discourse.

Will. Leg.

The Examination of Colonel Vavasour, taken the 29 of May, 1641.
THat at the mee^ing at Burrowbridge, Sergeant Major Willis and Captain
Chidley, of one of them, told the Officers there, that the Parliament had taken
great offense at the Letter which they had written up to my Lord of Northumber
and; and that those who had subscribed it, should be questioned, and that there
was small hopes of money from the Parliament for the present.

That the King would take it very well, if he might receive assurance from
them, that they would accept of Colonel Goring for their Lieutenant General,
and wished that the Army were united.

When the King had this assurance from them, there should come a General that
would bring them money, this they said they had good Commission to deliver unto
them, having received it from Mr. Herry Iermyn and Sir John Sucklin, he
likewise says Captain Chidley spoke it with more confidence, and Sergeant
Major Willis rather as having heard it from others: he further says, there was
a Letter written to Colonel Goring, for to let him know if the King would send
him down with a Commission to be Lieutenant General, they would willingly
receive him, and this Letter was proposed unto them by Captain Chidley and
Sergeant Major Willis. There was another letter written to Mr. Endimion Porter,
which as he remembers was to let him know, that though the Army was now
commanded by Sir Jacob Ashley, yet if that it were his Majesty's pleasure to
appoint Colonel Goring to be Lieutenant General, they were confident the
Army would receive him the better, being only subscribed by Colonel Fielding
and himself. And further says that he hears this Letter was never
delivered, for that Sir John Suckling told Master Chidley that Master Porter
was a stranger to the business.

Given at White Hall this 14. of May, 1641.
To our Trusty and Well-beloved Servant George Goring Governor of Portsmouth*
The Examination of Captain William Leg, taken upon Oath before the Lords
Committees upon Saturday the 30. of October, 1641.
To the first Interrg.

Says, That he does know Master Daniel Oneale who was Sergeant Major to Sir
John Conniers, does not certainly remember the precise time going from the
Army to London, nor of his return back, but believes he returned about June and
July.

To the ninth.

That he was at York when the said Master Oneale returned thither from
London, and can say no more to this ninth Interrg.

To the tenth.

That there was a Petition prepared to be delivered to the parliament from the
Army, which consisted of many particulars, as to show how much they suffered
for want of Martial Law, and for want of pay, and because their principal
Officers were not amongst them, and they did likewise set forth in it, That as
the wisdom of the King did cooperate with the Parliament, So they did hope
the Parliament would do something concerning the Kings Revenue; but says he
does not remember what the particular was which was desired, and further that
they heard of great tumults about London, and therefore offered themselves to
serve the King and Parliament: with the last drop of their bloods. He says
that this Petition was approved of by all the Officers that saw it, but was
laid aside till further consideration should be had of the manner of the
delivery, That himself was afterward sent for to London by order of the house
of Commons, and was examined, and after his examination, when he saw there was
no further use to be made of that Petition he burnt it.

He farther says, That he staid in this Town some five or six days, and
was with the King, and had some speech with His Majesty about a Petition to
come from the Army, and gave him an account of the Petition that was formerly
burnt, and there he received another Petition to the same effect with the
other, but bandso^lier written, upon which there was a direction indorsed to
this purpose, This Petition will not offend yet let it not be shown to any but
Sir Jacob Ashley.

He farther says there was no name to this direction but only two L^^ters, but
what those Letters were, he will not say nor cannot swear who writ those two
Letters, because he did not see them written.

He says he did deliver the same paper with the directions to Sir Jacob
Ashley, and told him withal here is a paper with a direction, you know the
hand, keep it secret, I have showed it to no body* if there be no occasion to
use it, you may burn it, and says he spoke no more of it to him, till after
my Lord of Hollands coming down to be General, and then he spoke to him to
burn it.

William Leg.

The Examination of Sir Jacob Ashley taken before the Lords Committees this
twenty ninth of October, 1641,
To the first Interog.

He says that he has known Sergeant Major Daniel Oneal very long and that he
was long absent from the Army the last Summer, but knows not at what time he
did return, nor knows not how long it was that he stayed in the Army before
his going into the Low Countries, but thinks it to be about three weeks.

To the second Interog.

He says that Mr. Oneale told him after his coming down last, that things
being not so well betwixt the King and Parliament, he thought a Petition from
the Army might do very much good, and asked him if a draught of such a
Petition were brought unto him, whether he would set his hand unto it, the
particulars which he desired to have the Army received in, were the want of
Martial Law, want of pay, and for words spoken in the House of Parliament
against the Army, as that the City was disaffected to the Kings Army, and would
rather pay the Scots then them.

To the third Inter. He cannot answer.

To the fourth Inter. He cannot answer.

To the fifth Inter.

He says that he received a Letter by the hands of Captain Leg, the tenor
whereof as far as remembers was to this effect, the Letter being written in
two sides of paper and somewhat more, first that diverse things were pressed by
parties to insafe into the Parliament things to the Kings disadvantage, and
that diverse tumults and disorders were near the parliament to the disservice
of the King, diverse other particulars were contained in this Letter, and in the
close of this Letter, it was recommended to this Examinat that he should get
the hands of the Officers of the Army to such a declarat on to be sent to the
Parliament, and that this would be acceptable to the King. He further says,
he knows not of whose hand writing it was nor who delivered it to Captain
Leg.

To the 7. Inter.

He says that Mr. Oneal telling him of the dislikes which were between the
King and the Parliament and of those things which were done to the disadvantage
of the King, they must fight with the Scots first and beat them before they
could move Southward; and that done, they must spoil the Country all along as
they go, and when they do come to London, they would find resistance by the
Parliament and the Scots might rallie and follow them: to which Oneale replied,
what if these Scots could be made neutrall: This Examinat then said, that the
Scots would lay him by the heels, if he should come to move such a thing, for
that they would never break with the Parliament.

Presently replied; I wondered that Counsels should be so laid as had been
spoken of: of the marching of the Army to the South.

8. Inter. D.

He further says that there was at the end of the Letter a direction to this
effect, Captain or Willam Leg, I command you that you show this Letter to
none but Jacob Ashley, above this direction were set these two Letters, C. R.

Jacob Ashley.

The Examination of Sir John Coniers, taken upon Oath before the Lords
Committees upon Friday the 29. of October 1641.
TO the first Interog. He says, that he knows very well Master Daniel
O-Neale, who was Sergeant Major to his Regiment, that the said O-Neale came up
to London about November last, and returned to the Army about Midsummer.

To the second, That O-Neale, after his return to the Army in Summer, spoke
twice unto this Examinant of a Petition to be sent from the Army to the
Parliament, and told him, that because they did not know if himself would
consent unto it, they would first petition him, that he would approve of it,
but that as yet there were but few hands to that Petition, which was to be
preferred to him; and therefore would not show it him.

To the fourth, That the said O-Neale, used persuasions to this Examinant, that
he would serve the King, that if he did not, he should be left alone, and
would but ruin himself, for that all the Troops under him were that way
inclined: That therefore he should adhere to the King, and go those ways that
the King would have him, or words to that effect.

To the fifth, That he saw a paper, containing some directions for a
Declaration to be subscribed unto by the Officers of the Army: which paper was
in Sir Jacob Ashleys hand; he says, it was long, containing two sides of a
sheet of paper or thereabout: the effect whereof was something concerning
Martial Law, and better payment for the Army, together with some other
particulars; that it was to be directed to the Parliment, and that there were
two Letters, viz. C. R. at the end. That he does not know who brought it unto
Sir Jacob Ashley, but that both of them were very much troubled at it. He says
further, that there was a direction at the end of the writing, that no body
should see it but Sir Jacob Ashley; and the two letters, C. R. were as he
remembers to that direction, but whether before or after that direction he
cannot affirm.

To the seventh, That he never heard Master O-Neale himself speak of his going
to New Castle, but that he heard it from others, and as he takes it from his
wife the Lady Coniers, and that whosoever it was that told him so, told him
withal, that O-Neale himself said so.

Io. Coniers

The second examination of Sir John Coniers, taken before the Lords Committees
upon Saturday the 30. of October.
TO the fourth inter. That Master O-Neal said to him, that if he this
Examinant, had been well known to the King, the King would have written to him,
and therefore he conceived, this Examinant should do well to write unto the
King; to which he replied, That he could not serve the King in that point, and
therefore he thought, it would be of no use, to trouble the King with his
letters.

To the fifth, That the paper mentioned in his former examination to have been
secne by him in Sir Jacobs Ashleys hand, contained directions for a Petition to
be presented to the King and Parliament: In which, was a clause to this effect,
That whereas all men ought to give God thanks, for putting it into the Kings
heart, to condescend to the desires of the Parliament, not only to deliver up
unto them many of his servants and others, who were near unto him to be at
their disposing, but also to do many things, which none of his Ancestors would
have consented unto, as giving way to the Triannuall Parliament: and granting
many other things for the good of his Subjects, yet not withstanding some
turbulent spirits, backed by rude and tumultuous mechanic persons, seemed not
to be satisfied, but would have the total subversion of the government of the
State, that therefore the Army, which was so orderly governed, not withstanding
they had no martial Law, and ill payment, and but few Officers, being of so
good comportment, might be called up to attend the person of the King and
Parliament for their security. This Examinant further says, that there were
many other passages in this Petition which he does not now remember, only that
there was some expression of a desire, that both Armies should be disbanded
for the case of the Kingdom; and likewise a direction to procure as many of
the Officers hands, as could be gotten.

To the seventh, That he remembers well it was not his wife, but Sir Jacob
Ashley, that said to him those words, O. Neal goes, or else O-Neal says he will
go to New Castle; but which of the sayings it was, he does not well remember;
but says he replied to it, that O-Neal said, nothing to him of that.

This Examinant further says, that he took occasion upon these passages from
O-Neal, to command him and Sir John Bartler and all the other Officers to
repair to their Quarters, to be ready to perfect their accounts with the
Country against the time they should be called for. Io. Comers.

The Examination of Sir Foulke Huneks, taken before the Lords Committees upon
Friday, October. 29. 1641.
TO the first Interrog. he says, that he does well know Master Daniel O-Neale,
who was Sergeant Major to Sir John Ceniers; That he went from the Army to
London about the time that the King came out of the North to the Parliament;
and that he returned again to the Army, about that time when Commissary Wilmot
and the other Soldiers were committed by the Parliament.

To the second. That the said O-Neale persuaded him this Examinant to take part
with the King, or something to that purpose; and that thereupon this Examinant
acquainted the Lieutenant General with it, and presently repaired to his own
Quarter, to keep the Soldiers in order; where he staid not above two or three
days, till he heard that O-Neal was fled. He further says, that O. Neale
dealt with him to have the troops move; To which he replied, that he had
received no such direction from his Superiors, nor from the King: And that
then he offered him a paper, and pressed him to sign it; whereupon he this
Examinant asked, if the General, or Lieutenant General had signed it; to
which O. Neale answering they had not, he said, that he would not be so
unmannerly as to sign any thing before them, and refused to read it. He says
likewise that Captain Armstrong was present at the same time, and that O-Neale
offered it to him; who looking upon this Examinant, this Examinant did shake
his head at him, to make a sign that he should not do it, and withal went
out of the room: and Armstrong afterward refused it, giving this reason, That
he would not sign it when his Colonel had refused it; which he told this
Examinant.

To the third he says, That O-Neale told him he had very good authority for
what he did; but did not tell him from whom.

To the seventh. That Master O-Neale told him he was to go to the Scottish
Army, but says he does not know for what end and purpose he would go thither;
for that he this Examinant shunned to have any thing more to do with him.

Foulk Huncks.

The Examination of Sir William Balfour Lieutenant of the Tower, taken the
second of June.
To the first Interrog. he says he was commanded to receive Captain
Billingsley into the Tower with 100. men for securing of the place, and that he
was told they should be under his command.

To the second Interrog: he says, The Earl of Strafford told him it would be
dangerous in case he should refuse to let them in.

To the third Interrog. He refers himself to the former depositions of the
three women, taken before the Constable and himself. And further says, That
the Earl of Strafford himself, after he had expostulated with him for holding
Master Slingsby at the Tower gate; and after his telling the said Earl he had
reason so to do, in regard of what the women had deposed, by which it appeared
there was an escape intended by his Lordship; himself acknowledged he had
named the word Escape twice or thrice in his discourse with Master Slingsby,
but that he meant it should be by the Kings authority, to remove him out of
the Tower to some other Castle; and that he did ask Master Slingsby where his
brother was, and the ship.

To the fourth Interrog. This Examinant says, the Earl of Strafford sent for
him some three or four days before his death, and did strive to persuade him
that he might make an escape; and said, for without your connivence I know it
cannot be: and if you will consent thereunto, I will make you to have 20000.
pounds paid you, besides a good marriage for your son: To which this
Examinant replied, he was so far from concurring with his Lordship, as that
his honor would not suffer him to connive at his escape; and withal told him,
he was not to be moved to hearken thereunto.

HE says that one Ancient Knot told him several times the last week, that Sir
John Suckling was raising of Officers for three Regiments for Portugal: and
says that he this Examinant was at the Portugal Ambassadors on Sunday last,
and then the Ambassador told him that he knew not Sir John Suckling, nor any
thing at all of Sir John Sucklings raising of men for Portugal; and the
Ambassador himself had no Commission to treat for any men till he heard out of
Portugal.

Tuesday the 11. of May, 1641. The Examination of John Lanyon.
HE was upon Easter Eve last, and several times since, troubled by Captain
Billingsley to enter into an expedition for Portugal with Sir John Sucklin.
And when this Examinant told him that he was His Majesty's servant, and could
not go without leave, Captain Billingsley bid him take no care for that, he
should have leave procured, and further desired him to get as many Canoneers as
he could.

This Examinant doubting whether they were real in that Design; repaired to
the Portugal Ambassadors, and there understood from his Secretary, that he was
willing to have men, but they knew neither Sir John Suckling, nor Captain
Billingsley; neither had they from them any Commission to raise men.

He likewise says, that Captain Billingsley did after solicit this
Examinant to come to Sir John Suckling, and that upon Sunday was sennight last
Sir John Suckling and Captain Billingsley, with many other Officers, repaired
unto his house in the afternoon, and there staid two hours at least; The
Examinant not coming in they left a note he should be with them that night at
the Sparragus Garden at Supper: whereof this Examinant failing, Captain
Billingsley comes again to his house the Monday morning, and not finding him
there, left word that he must needs come to the Covent Garden to Sir John
Sucklings lodging, which accordingly he did; but not finding him there, the
same day he was with Captain Billingsley at the Dog Tavern in Westminster, at
which time he did farther appoint this Examinant upon Wednesday to promise Sir
John Suckling a meeting at the Dolphin in Grayes Inn lane about nine of the
clock in the forenoon, where the same day came some thirty more which were
appointed by Sir John Suckling and Captain Billingsley; but neither Sir John
Suckling or Billingsley came, only there came one and gave them money, and so
dismissed them for the present.

This Examinant further says, that Captain Billingsley having notice that he
had some store of Arms of his own, told him, Sir John Suckling would buy them
all, if he pleased to fell them.

Captain Billingsley likewise told this Examinant, that Sir John Suckling, had
furnished himself for money, and all the company.

Quarto die Maii, 1641.
ELizabeth Nutt, wife of William Nutt of Tower-street London, Merchant, and
Anne Bardsey of Tower-street aforesaid widow, say, that they being desirous to
see the Earl of Strafford, came to Anne Vyner wife of Thomas Vyner Clerk to
the Lieutenant of the Tower, whose lodging being near to the Kings Gallery,
where the said Earl uses to walk, carried them to a back door of the said
Gallery, the said Earl with one other being then walking. And they three being
then there, and peeping through the key hole and other places of the door to
see the said Earl, did hear him and the said other party conferring about an
escape, as they conceived, saying, that it must be done when all was still, and
asked the said party where his brothers ship was, who said she was gone below
in the River, and heard him say, that they three might be there in twelve
hours, and doubted not to escape if some thing which was said concerning the
Lieutenant of the Tower, were done; but what that was, as also where they might
be in twelve hours, they could not hear by reason that when they walked
further off, they could not perfectly hear. And the said Ms Nutt and Ms
Bardsey say, that they heard the said Earl then say, that if this Fort could be
safely guarded or secured for three or four months, there would come aid
enough: and diverse other words tending to the purposes aforesaid, which they
cannot now remember.

And further all of them say that they heard the said Earl, three times
mention an escape, saying, that if any thing had been done, his Majesty might
safely have sent for him; but now there was nothing to be thought on, but an
escape: And heard the said other party telling his Lordship, that the outward
gates were now as surely guarded as those within. To whom the said Earl said,
the easier our escape that way, pointing to the East, if the said party and
some others should obey the directions of the said Earl: But what those were
they know not; but heard the said party answer, they would do any thing his
Lordship should command.

The Superscription of the Letter. For my worthy Friend Sir Jews Dyves Knight,
at the Earl of Bristolls house in Queen Street,

London. Dear Brother,
I Hope you will have received the Letter which I wrote unto you from aboard
Sir John Pennington, wherein I gave you account of the accident of O-Neals man,
and why I thought fitting to continue my journey into Holland; going still upon
this ground, that if things go on by way of accommodation, by my absence the
King will be advantaged: If the King declare himself, and retire to a safe
place, I shall be able to wait upon him from hence, as well as out of any part
of England, over and above the service which I may do him here in the mean
time. Besides that, I found all the Ports so strict, that if I had not taken
this opportunity of Sir John Peningtons forwardness in the Kings service, it
would have been impossible for me to have gotten away at any other time.

I am now here at Middle borough, at the Golden Fleece upon the Market, at one
George Petersons house, where I will remain till I receive from you
advertisement of the state of things, and likewise instructions from their
Majesty's; which I desire you to hasten unto me by some safe hand: and withal
to send unto me a cipher, whereby we may write unto one another freely. If you
knew how easy a passage it were, you would offer the King to come over for
some few days your self. God knows I have not a thought toward my Country
to make me blush, much less criminal; but where Traitors have so great a
sway, the honestest thoughts may prove most treasonable.

Let Dick Sherley be dispatched hither speedily, with such black clothes and
linen as I have: and let your letters be directed to the Baron of Sherborn,
for by that name I live unknown. Let care be taken for Bills of Exchange.

Yours.
Middleborough Jan. 20. 1641.
The Examination of Owen Connelly Gent. taken before us whose names ensue. the
22. of October 1641.
WHo being duly sworn and examined, says, That he being at Mommore in the
County of Londonderry on Tuesday last, he received a Letter from Colonel Hugh
Ogemacmahon, desiring him to come to Connagh in the County of Monayhan, and to
be with him on Wednesday or Thursday last: whereupon he this Examinant came to
Connagh on Wednesday night last, and finding the said Hugh come to Dublin,
followed him hither: He came hither about six of the clock this Evening, and
forthwith went to the lodging of the said Hugh, to the house near the Boot in
Oxmantowne, and there he found the said Hugh, and came with the said Hugh into
the town, near the Pillory, to the lodging of the Lord Mac-quire; where they
found not the Lord within: and there they drank a cup of Beer, and then went
back again to the said Hugh his lodging. He says that at the Lord Mac-quire
his lodging the said Hugh told him that there were and would be this night
great numbers of Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Irish Papists, from all the
parts of the Kingdom, in this Town, who with himself had determined to take
the Castle of Dublin, and possess themselves of all his Majesty's Ammunition
there; and to morrow morning being Saturday: and that they intended first to
batter the Chimneyes of the said Town; and if the City would not yield, then
to batter down the houses, and so to cut off all the Protestants that would not
join with them.

He says further, That the said Hugh then told him, that the Irish had
prepared men in all parts of the Kingdom, to destroy all the English inhabiting
there to morrow morning by ten of the clock; and that in all the Seaports, and
other Towns in the Kingdom, all the Protestants should be killed this night;
and that all the Posts that could be could not prevent it. And further says,
That he moved the said Hugh to forbear the executing of that business, and to
discover it to the State for the saving of his own estate: who said, that he
could not help it: But said, that they did owe their due allegiance to the
King, and would pay him all his Rights, but that they did this for the
tyrannical Government was over them; and to imitate Scotland, who got a
privilege by that course. And he further says, That when he was with the said
Hugh in his lodging the second time, the said Hugh swore that he should not go
out of his lodging that night, but told him that he should go with him the
next morning to the Castle, and said, if this matter were discovered, some body
should die for it: Whereupon this Examinant feigned some necessity for his
easement, went down out of the Chamber, and left his sword in pawn, and the
said Hugh sent his man down with him; And when this Examinant came down into
the yard, finding an opportunity, he this Examinant leaped over a wall and two
pales, and so came to the Lord Justice Parsons.

The examination of Mark Pagett Parson of Morlestowne, near Kingsale in
Ireland, and Deane of Rosse there, had and taken at Plimmouth, in the County of
Devon: before Thomas Ceely Merchant, Mayor of the Borough of Plimmouth
aforesaid, William Birch, and Ioh: Bound, Merchants; three of his Majesty's
Justices of the Peace, within the said Borough, the fourth day of March, 1641.
The said Examinant says, that he came from Kingsale this day was seven-night,
and says, that the Rebellion in Ireland is general; (except the Port Towns
and Fortifications) and says, that he conceives that the Forces of the
Rebels in Munster is between twenty or thirty thousand, which lie near Cork
and Bandam Bridge, in two bodies; whereof the chief of one is Baron Loughland,
the Lord Mungarret, the Lord Dunboi^e, and diverse other Lords: and the chief
of the other are Macarte Reath, Teage Adowne, Teage Adun van Durmet, Glacke,
and Macke Phenning, and diverse others. And this Examinant has for certain
heard, that the Earl of Clanrikard is likewise in Arms in Connough against
the English Protestants; and further says, that he knows that the Rebels
have very good intelligence out of England, of all passages here, and for the
most part speedier then the English have there: and further says, that they
threaten that as soon as they have rooted out the British* and English there*
to invade England, and assist the Papists in England* And further says, that
they have the Popes Lega^e amongst them (as they report) who sits constantly in
counsel with Sir Phil^me Oneale, (who writes himself now Prince Oneale from
his Palace Charlemount:) the Lord Meggennys and diverse others, who directed
and advised the rest of the Rebels. And farther says, That the Irish Rebels,
do report that they have the Kings Warrant and Great Seal for what they do,
and say they are his Majesty's true Subjects; and that the English Protestants
are Rebels, and not they. And further says, that the Rebels do generally
report that there are three factions in England, whereof one is the Kings;
which consists for the most part of Courtiers and Bishops, with some few Lords
and Gentry: Another the Puritans, which is supported by the House of Commons,
some Lords, and the Corporations and Cities in England: And the third is the
Queens, which they say is the greatest; and consists of the Catholics, some
Lords, all the Priests and Jesuits, besides the expectation they have of
foreign forces: And farther says, that they report that the Queens faction
will set such a division between the two others, that it will root out both of
them at last, And farther says, that the said Irish do brag that the
Queens faction has the command of most of the Fortes and Forces of England.
And this Examinant farther says, that he kneweth this to be usually reported
amongst them, for that he has lived in Ireland these two and thirty years,
and been incumbent of the said Church eighteen years, and has heard diverse
of the Irish Papists of the better sort to affirm so much, which does much
hearten the Rebels, and dishearten the English: And farther says, that the
Rebels have taken the Iron-workes at Glannorreth, and great quantities of Iron;
and there, and elsewhere cast Ordinance, make Muskets, heads for Pikes*
Skeanes, and other weapons; and farther says, that the greatest part of the
nine thousand Irish Soldiers which the Earl of Strafford had at Nockvargas in
Ireland, and there exercised and trained a long time, are the most expert
Commanders, Leaders, and Officers amongst the Rebels.

Thomas Ceely Mayor.

Madame,
I Shall not adventure to write unto your Majesty with freedom, but by
expresses, or till such time as I have a cipher, which I beseech your Majesty
to vouchsafe me. At this time therefore I shall only let your Majesty know
where the humblest and most faithful servant you have in the world is; Here at
Middleborough where I shall remain in the privatest way I can* till I receive
instructions how to serve the King and your Majesty in these parts. If the King
betake himself to a safe place, where he may avow and protect his servants
from rage (I mean) and violence, for from Justice I will never implore it, I
shall then live in impatience and in misery, till I wait upon you. But if
after all he has done of late, he shall betake himself to the easiest and
complyantest ways of accommodation: I am confident, that then I shall serve
him more by my absence then by all my industry, and it will be a comfort to me
in all calamities, if I cannot serve you by my actions, that I may do it in
some kind by my sufferings for your sake; having (I protest to God) no measure
of happiness or misfortune in this world, but what I derive from your
Majesty's value of my affection and fidelity.

Middleborough the 21. of January, 1641.
