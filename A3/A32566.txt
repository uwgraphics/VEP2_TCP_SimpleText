By the King.
A PROCLAMATION For the further Proroguing the Parliament.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, taking into His Princely Consideration, the
hazardous consequences, and perils which may ensue by the extraordinary resort
of people which must necessarily attend the Sitting of the Parliament, if the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons should Assemble at Westminster at the
time now prefixed; by which occasion (especially at this season of the year) the
late Contagion in the Cities of London and Westminster, (where at present, by
Gods great mercy, it is almost totally abated) may be again increased; And for
other weighty considerations, His Majesty does by the Advice of His Privy
Council, Publish, Notify, and Declare His Will and Pleasure to be, That the
Parliament shall be Prorogued from the Three and twentieth day of this instant
Month of April, until the Eighteenth day of September now next coming: Whereof
the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, and all
others whom it may concern, may hereby take notice, and order their Affairs
accordingly: We letting them know, That We will not at the said Three and
twentieth day of April, expect the attendance of any, but only such as being
in or about Our Cities of London or Westminster, may attend the making of the
said Prorogation, as heretofore in like case has been accustomed.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the 6th day of April, 1666. in the 18th year
of Our Reign.
God save the King.
LONDON, Printed by John Bill and Christopher Barker, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty, 1666.
