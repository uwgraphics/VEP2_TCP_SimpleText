A DECLARATION From the PEOPLE CALLED Quakers, To the Present Distracted Nation
of ENGLAND.

With Mourning and Lamentation over it, because of its Breaches, and the Cause
thereof laid down, with Advice and Council how Peace, Union, and Happiness may
be restored, and all the present troubles removed.

LONDON, Printed in the Year 1659.

To the Present Distracted and Broken Nation of ENGLAND, and to all her
Inhabitants.
A Presentation and Declaration from the Seed of God, and from the People
called Quakers, with their Sense and Knowledge published, concerning the
present Divisions and Confusions come to pass in the Land, with the Causes
thereof laid down and discovered, and also good Council and Advice held forth,
how Peace and Unity may be restored, and how the present tribulations may be
removed.

OH poor distressed Nation, and full of troubles; how art thou broken and
divided? how has divisions and distractions compassed thee about, and entered
into thy bowels? and how are thy inhabitants, and thy people divided even into
hatred one against another? and how are they filled as with mischief one
toward another? even as it were, thirsting for the blood one of another. Oh!
how are thy Rulers and thy Subjects, thy great men and thy poor, confounded
amongst themselves? and how is the wisdom of thy wise men turned into folly;
and their union into present contention? and how do they seek the overthrow
one of another; and how do they lie in wait to be avenged one against another?
and how are the hearts of many filled with envy, contention, and revenge; and
love, peace, and unity, are far away, meekness, patience, and long
suffering, which ought to be among thy people, seems to stand afar off; And oh
Nation, this is the day of thy trouble, and the beginning of thy sorrows.

And for as much as it has pleased the Lord God Almighty, to bring and suffer
things thus to be brought to pass, as if he would make our Nation a heap, and
suffer destruction upon it, and having suffered the Rulers and great men to
overturne and break down one another, and to rend and tear one another from off
the Throne; pulling down others, and setting up themselves, even thorough their
ambition and vain glory, and for corrupted ends to themselves; whereby this our
Nation is brought into present confusion, and many are begotten thorough these
things into fury, heart burnings, and malitiousnesse; as if men were ready to
devour each one his neighbor, and their Brother; about Government, and Rule;
being greatly divided and distracted in this matter; some crying up one way of
Religion, and Church, and Civil Government; and some crying up another way,
being each one sort of people seeking themselves, and the prosperity of their
own interests, and to have their own desires accomplished, but few seeking the
Lord, and to advance him in truth, and righteousness.

And because of this, there is no establishment in the Earth, but strife, and
contention, and heart burnings in the bowels of the Nation, and great want of
true love, true unity, and true peace, and all the contrary does abound among
the people; because of which the Nation is subject to present misery, even to
bloodshed and murders, and liable also to greater judgments which may also
come upon it, because of these things; all which we have deeply considered,
with mourning, and with breakings of heart, on the behalf of the Nation, the
Land of our Nativitie; we have seen, we have seen, the cause of thy
distractions, to be the Sins of thy Rulers and People, and we have seen the
effect of them, to be doleful and miserable unto thee, except the hand of the
Lord turn it backward.

And oh, how do we mourn and lament, to behold the out goings of men, and the
present condition of the People and Rulers in this the day of their trouble;
alas they do not behave themselves toward the Lord that his judgments may be
turned away, they do not seek him in truth and righteousness, they do not
turn unto him with all their hearts, neither do they tremble at his Word: But
they the rather reject his Counsel, and despises his visitation, and they
seek themselves, and exalt their own horn, and loves the honor of this world,
and their hearts are hardened, and the great men seems to be utterly insencible
of what the Lord is a doing, but seeks great things for themselves, and each
one rejoicing in another fall, and glorying in their advantages one over
another; one sort being first down, and another sort comes up, boasting
themselves over the fall of their Enemies, and not knowing, that their time
also is but very short. And thus is our poor Nation tossed to and fro thorough
the ambition of men; who even makes a prey upon the poor peoples Persons and
Treasure, for their own corrupted ends, and thy Rulers has not had respect
unto the counsel of the Lord, but seems to refuse the way of peace, and even
adds fuel to the fire of Gods wrath, by heaping up one trausgression upon
another, and they receive not the instructions of the Almighty. Behold, oh
Nation, great trouble is upon thee, and the men that should rule thee, and
which have pretended to govern thee, they do not walk in the way of thy peace,
neither do they bring healing to thee. These things we have considered, and
thus we lament over thee, and over thy present State. Oh Nation, how are thou
like an ungirded vessel, that is ready to fall one piece from another? and how
art thou like a body without a head, and all thy joints out of order? and what
confusion art thou fallen into, which is thy present State, and art even ^s a
widow without a husband, and art left comfortless unto this day, and ready to
devour thy self thorough the envy that lodges in thy own bowels; though
thou have had Kings over thee, and chosen the Parliaments, and, set up
Protectors; and Committees and Councels have bin creaated in thee, to have bin
as a defense upon thee, and to have borne the Scepter of thy Government; but
alas these have all left thee, and thou art now as alone, and left in trouble,
and confusion, and none of all these that have sitten on thy Throne, have
brought salvation unto thee, but thou art left comfortless even as a widow
unto this day, and the Staff of thy hand has peirced thee, and thy strength
and considence has betrayed thee, and them whom thou have chosen have wrought
no deliverance at all in thee, even the men that thou thoughest should have
healed thee, they have made thy wound more incurable, and they in whom thou
have reposed trust, they have been deceiptfull and treacherous in thee, for
many have sought themselves, and who should be the greatest, and they have
trifled away many precious hours in vain contentions about Government, what
it should be, and who should Govern, while as no good thing has been effected
by them, but in the mean time of their delays, and while they have been
making themselves rich with the Nations Treasure, and loved this worlds
perishing honor, and vain titles, the Nation has starved for want of mercy
and just judgment, and the cause of its necessity has bin forgotten, and
mercy, and truth, and the freedom of the people neglected, and the cause of
the faeherlesse, widow, and stranger, and the cause of the afflicted people,
have they not respected; Oh Nation, the men that have sitten on thy Throne,
they have left thee groaning yet under great oppressions, wounded with the
spirit of Tyranny yet un-cast out, and thy people are yet unhealed, but the
breach has been made wider, even by that Spirit which has possessed thy
Kings, thy Parliaments, thy Protectors, thy Councils, thy Committees, who has
proved unto thee Physicians of no value, but have bin the encreasers of thy
grief, and even because of their iniquities, and the Sin of their ambition and
oppression, has the Lord dealt thus with them, and suffered them to dash one
another in pieces, and through judgment unto themselves and thee, oh Nation,
are they at present ceased from thee, and thou art left alone, and without a
deliverer in the Earth, full of troubles and distractions; oh that thou
would now look unto the Lord, and seek him in righteousness, that he may
heal thee, for there is none of all them that do pretend to Rule thee, that do
rightly proceed in the way of thy deliverance, they do not apply healing balm
unto thy wound, they rather add unto the cause of thy sorrow, then removes it
from thee, their hearts are not aright before the Lord, and how then should
thee prosper in their doings.

All these things have we veiwed, and pitied the condition of our Nation, and
thus we do declare that the very cause of these things that are come to pass
in thee, is in that, oh Nation, thou have sinned, thou have sinned; and the cry
of thy iniquities is come up before the Lord, even the sins of thy Rulers, and
thy People, is the cause of Gods displeasure against thee, and he is provoked,
through their transgressions, in thee is found the blood of the innocent, in
thee is found the murder of Souls, in thee is found treachery against God, and
hypocrisy, and dissimulation with God and men, in thee is found pride, and
oppression, whoredom, and drunkenness, stealing, and murder, in thee is
found the very burden of iniquity, and the full measure of transgression,
even the transgression of Gods whole Law, deceit is found in the unsoundnesse
of heart, and unconstancy in all good things, multitude of hypocritical
fastings, prayers, and services, in thee is found, even destroying sins of all
sorts does abound, and thou have provoked the Lord God by thy abominations: Thy
Rulers have bin oppressors, thy Teachers deceivers of Souls, and thy People
are froward, and perverse, against the Lord, in thee is found the men that
judge for rewards, and the Priests that preach for hire, and the Prophets that
divine for money, thy fins are like Israells of old, for number, and
greatness, and thou have lost Gods favor, and gained his fury, by thy own
doings, and thou art the very cause of this misery, and have brought it upon
thy self, and because thou art departed from the living God by thy
transgressions, therefore has he confounded thee, and turned thy wisdom into
folly, and he is departed from thee, and out of thy counsels; and men are left
to the counsels of their own hearts, and as it were ready to destroy one
another, Ruler against Ruler, and Neighbor and Friend full of strife one
against another, and this is happened unto thee as a judgment for thy iniquities,
who have also neglected a glorious day of visitation, thy Rulers and
inhabitants have bin warned, and the cry of repentance has bin sounded toward
them all, by a despised people, but warning has not bin regarded, but the Word
of the Lord rejected by thy Rulers and People, and lo what wisdom is there in
them, not so much wisdom from God as can preserve them, but it may be just
with the Lord to suffer them to drink the blood one of another, even because
they have finned against God, and rejected his counsel, therefore is this come
to pass in the Nation: for had thou, oh Nation, walked in the light of the
Lord, it had bin better with thee, had every one obeyed the light in his own
conscience, and had every one sought the Lord, and not himself, had thy Rulers
Ruled for God, and had thy people bin Ruled of God, then this day had not bin a
day of trouble, but it had bin a day of joy, and sorrow and anguish had bin
removed far from thee, and blessings had filled thy habitations.

And now whereas many wise men have bin advising and consulting the peace of
this our Nation, and they have given in their counsel for the removing these
troubles, yet peace and unity seems to be far away, and though they have
sought peace for this nation, yet they have not walked in the perfect way
thereof, for innocence, truth, and simplicity, have bin wanting, which God only
will bless, and by flatteries, and deceipts, and the policy, and wisdom of
this world, have they thought to make up thy breach, but it cannot be, for in
the way of that proceeding will not the Lord be found in a needful time; and
his presence has bin wanting in their counsels, and therefore the fruit of
peace is not yet grown up; this we have seen, and therefore thus we do declare,
O Nation, the inward cause of thy distractions must be removed, even thy
iniquities must be forsaken, and thy transgressions repented of, thou must
forsake thy former ways and doings that are not right, thou must leave off thy
hypocrisies and flatteries with God and men; thou must repent thee of thy
profannesse, and of thy profession also, thy sin and thy righteousness must
thou put away, which are both abominations unto God, thou must cease to do
evil, and learn to do well, and thou must be uncovered of thy Sheeps
clothing, thy large profession of Religion, and the multitude of thy prayers,
and Sermons, and the number of thy Oblations, and Offerings, these things have
not bin pleasant unto the Lord from thee, but because hrreof is he the rather
provoked against thee, and thou must be stripped of thy filthy garments, and
set as in the day that thou wast borne, before thou can be clothed with
divine righteousness, and, O Nation, thou must be changed, not in name only, but
in nature; thou must be converted, that the wrath of the Lord may be turned
back from thee; every inhabitant in thee must become a fighter against the evil
in his own heart, and the plague thereof must be sought out and removed; the sin
must be forsaken, that judgment may cease, and every one must cease to provoke
the Lord, and no longer vex his Spirit within them, and every one must love the
light of Christ in his own conscience, and become a follower of it, that will
lead him out of all sin, and every man must put off his transgressions and
forsake himself, and lay down the enmity, and cast it out of his heart, that he
has against Persons, and he must war against the Enemies of his own Soul,
and the Enemies of his own house must be slain, even his own lusts, and even
the evil affections of his own heart must he become an Enemy unto, and every
man must deny the false Teachers and Deceivers, and must come to be taught of
the Lord, every one must turn to him, and come into his Covenant, and hear his
Word, and obey his Voice, and become humble and meek, and must tremble at the
word of the Lord, and must become upright and innocent.

And, O Nation, if it were thus with thee, then should thou be a happy
people if thou do these things, then shall all thy breaches be healed, and thy
sorrows be turned into joy, and the Lord shall cease to smite thee, and his
anger shall be turned clean away: This is our counsel unto thee, remove thy
iniquities by repentance, be converted to the Lord, and he shall heal thee,
and his love shall be shed abroad; peace, plenty, and satisfaction, unity, and
concord, shall be unto all thy inhabitants, and the Lord himself shall be thy
King, thy Judge, and thy Lawgiver: he will judge thee with equity, and not with
oppression, he will teach thee in the perfect way, and thou shall not err, he
will defend thee from all thine Enemies, and Tyrants shall not have power over
thee; Oh Nation if thou do these things, even turn to the Lord with all thy
heart, that he may walk in thee, and dwell in thee, then should thy light break
out of obscurity, and the dew of mercies should fall upon thee, and it should
be unto thee as a Morneing without clouds, and thou should be refreshed
after all thy sorrows, the Nation should be happy, and the People blessed, and
the Government of peace, and truth should be established, never to be
confounded any more.

And thus thy iniquities being removed, the plague should cease, and the cause
of destruction being taken away, no fruit thereof should appear, wherefore let
men cease to hatch mischief one against another, and to seek vengeance one of
another; and let them seek with all speed, and sincerity, to get victory over
their own sins, and that vengeance may be taken upon their own transgressions;
and this is our counsel for the healing of our Nations breach, and for the
turning away of the anger of the Lord. But and if, O Nation thou continue in
thy perverseness, and in thy transgressions which the Lord hates, and if thou will not turn to him that smites thee, and love his Rod that corrects thee,
but wilt always greive the Spirit of the Lord, and will be obstinate, and
stout-hearted against the Lord, and his reproves, and if thou will continue in
thy accustomed sins, then shall the reward thereof be upon thee, even breach
upon breach, and one judgment upon another; and mercy shall be withheld from
thee, and the dew shall not fall upon thee, but thou shall be as a barren
heath, and thou shall be given up to consume thy self, in mischief, and in thy
heart burnings one toward another, if thou will set up Rulers of thy own proud
and ambitious men, and will not choose the Lord to Rule over thee, but reject
him, and his people, then shall thy breach never be healed by the men whom thou
choosest, but through them shall thy breach be more desperate, and thy wound
made more incurable, and if thou will set up Teachers that teach for filthy
lucre, and Prophets that divine for money, and Priests that preach for hire,
and will not receive the Covenant of the Lord, and him to be thy Teacher, by
his Spirit; then shall thou Err in thy ways, and stumble, and fall, and never
know perfect peace with God, nor one with another, but as thou love
oppression and deceit, and walk in transgression, so shall it be unto thee,
and thou must eat the fruit of thy own doings, misery upon miseries shall be
upon thee, and thou shall not see the face of the Almighty to refresh thee;
wherefore O Nation, consider before the night come upon thee, when no way will
be found by thee to be delivered, for in the midst of thy confusions; God is a
working, he has a work to bring forth, which shall be a work of great mercy,
and deliverance, or of sorrow, and of great judgment, even to the whole Land.

And as for us, we hereby declare unto thee, we are not thy Enemies, we seek
not thy hurt, nor do we desire vengeance upon our Enemies, we seek not thy
destruction, but we desire thy repentance, that thou may be healed; we have
not the spirit of mischief, and rebellion in our hearts toward thee, neither
are we for one party, or another, nor do we side with one sort, and rebel
against another, neither do we join our selves to this sort, or the other, nor
do we war against any by carnal weapons, neither shall we ever provoke the
Nation against us, otherwise then by our righteous and holy walking, and we do
declare that we are not for men, nor names, nor shall we join with this, or
that sort of men, but as they act righteousness alone, nor any thing which yet
appears, can we fully embrace or rejoice in; for they are all corrupted in
their ways, and that cursed spirit of self seeking, seems to be the rule of,
and to leaven their principal actions, and we rather yet choose to suffer by
all, as for a long time we have don already; then to lose our integrity, and
innocence, by joining to any, in their unjust ways, for we reject all places
of corrupted honor, and we are yet kept free. It is true, we are a people
gathered of the Lord into one Spirit, and though a people littie in account,
and very low in reputation, and greatly reproched, and even a suffering people
by all sorts of men, yet we are a people loved of the Lord, and his presence is
among us, and his dread fills our hearts, and though we are accounted as a
cast-out people, yet are we dreadful unto the wicked, and must be their fear,
for we have chosen the Son of God to be our King, and he has chosen us to be
his people; and he might command thousands, and ten thousands of his Saints at
this day, to fight in his cause, he might lead them forth, and bring them in,
and give them victory over all their Enemies, and turn his hand upon all their
persecutors, but yet his Kingdom is not of this World, neither is his warrfare
with carnal weapons, neither is his victory by the murdering, and killing of
men's persons, neither has he chosen us for that end, neither can we yet
believe that he will make use of us in that way, though it be his only right to
rule in Nations, and our heireship to possess the uttermost parts of the
Earth, but for the present we are given up to bear, and suffer all things for
his names sake, and our present glory, and renown therein stands, till the
appointed time of our deliverance, without the Arm of flesh, or any multitude
of an host of men; this we declare, and O Nation, though we have born thy
reproaches these many years, and have passed under the Rod of thy wicked
Rulers, and people, and we have bin afflicted through their hard-heartednesse,
though we never have provoked thee, otherwise then by our well doing; and
though persecution, imprisonments, whippings, banishments, and all hard things
have bin our portion from thee, yet this has bin for righteousness sake, and
not for any evil doing, and we have borne all these things in much patience,
and we are not now provoked against thee, to seek thy hurt, or to work evil in
thee, though thou have smitten us, yet would we have thee to be healed, and
though thou have sought to destroy us, yet would we have thee to repent and be
saved, and we are at this day thy mourners, and are afflicted for thee in our
hearts, even because thou have provoked the Lord against thee, though we do
rejoice in the judgments which smites thee; yet we mourn for thee who has
deserved such woe full stripes; and also because thou refusest the way of peace,
and counts them that reprove thee even thy Enemies, and hardnest thy heart
against Gods instructions; and counts his free borne people thy bondslaves;
who has not any larg portion, not great places of honor in this Nation, nor
ny thing to glory in from thee, but sufferings, afflictions, and tribulations;
where is the place in this Nation, that we have not bin reproched? in what
Street have not we bin reviled; and in what Prison have not we bin unjustly
imprisoned? and among what sort of people have not we bin hated? and what oue
of thy Judges and Rulers can clear themselves before the Lord, from the guilt
of our unjust sufferings; O Nation, our portion in thee, for these many years,
has bin thy cruel reproaches; our greatest place of honor in thee, has bin
under thy cruel oppressions, and these things, and the guilt thereof will God
charge upon thee, and reward thee for, one time or another; yet notwithstanding
all this, our present desires for thee are good, and not evil, that thou may
be saved and not destroyed, healed and not wounded unrecoverably; and we would
^ot add unto thy grief; by any just provocation, through any evil toward the,
neither would we vvoek offense in thee, further then vhat thou take for
righteousness sake; and for the exercise of our pure conscience.

And though there has bin in this Nation diverse and sundry overturnings of
late days, and some have bin turned out, and others brought into place, each
one sort of them crying against the evil of another, and promising to
accomplish such and such good things in the Nation; yet alas, what is there
effected unto this day? what freedom and true liberty to subjects more then was
many years ago? what oppressions taken off from the people? what establishment
in Government? Alas, not any of-these things are accomplished, neither do we
see a right thing propounded, and rightly prosecuted, by any party yet
appearing; but the cause hardly yet appears, carried on by any among them,
which can be said of it, this is of the Lord, and is perfectly right, and the
Lord will prosper it, for most of the men that have yet appeared on the Throne,
they have rejected the Word of the Lord and his Council; and what wisdom is
there in them, only the policy, and subtlety, and wisdom of this world,
wherein they build, but the Lord throws down, even before it be finished; and
they consult therein, and the Lord dasheth to pieces; they set up, but he pulls
down, because they want his spirit and wisdom, and his authority amongst them,
and they are as the Potsheards of the earth, that the iron Rod must break in
pieces; and this we declare, the men (yet) seems not to appear in all these
Parties, which are worthy to handle the Lords Scepter, and to be crowned with
the honor of Authority in his Government; but even this party, and the other
party seems to be un worthy to rule for the Lord, for they appear to be
choked with the honor of this world, and corrupted thereby, and incapable of
receiving that anointing that men must have, that shall truly rule for God; and
though many in our days that have ruled over us, have promised great things to
the Nation, yet we see all hitherto have wanted power to perform, and have not
bin blessed with the Presence of the Lord, so as this Nation has bin healed
and redeemed by them, and we are utterly out of all hopes of this party, or the
other party, of this man, or that man, to bring salvation unto this Nation,
from all its bonds and oppressions, for we know, whatsoever men profess to do,
yet they cannot perform any good thing, nor Rule for God in our Nation, till
that themselves be reformed, and ruled by him, and have the Spirit of God
poured upon them for such a work, and this we declare, till that a man, or men,
be ruled of the Lord, they can never rightly Rule for him, nor bring
deliverance and freedom to an oppressed Nation, though men may, and have
promised much, yet their fruit is but little; and thou O Nation, have long bin
deceived by such men, who have flattered thee with the multitude of fair
words, and promised thee deliverance; and hereby might thou learn wisdom, O
England, never more to rest under the shadow of such men, make no more a
mountain to cover thy self, rest not under the shadow of dead Trees, that
wants the virtue of God, but now look at the living God, and wait for that King
of righteousness, and peace, whose right alone it is to Rule, for he alone can
bring salvation to thee, he alone can heal thy breaches, even Jesus Christ,
whose coming is at the door, and in the mean time O Nation, while he is
absent, thou art dry, and barren, and empty, thou art tossed, and shaken, and
thou art tossed, and perplexed, and cannot be rightly comforted; for men shall
not be a rest unto thee, but one after another shall they be overturned, for it
is the Lord alone, and under his Government shall people find perfect rest,
and freedom from all oppression, for what is a King? and what is a Parliament?
what is a Protector, and what is a Council? or any other sort of men, while
the presence of the Lord is not with them, and while his Spirit and Authority
is wanting to them, what can any of these bring forth, none of all these
whatsoever, if the Lord be not chief in them, and amongst them, and his
counsel their only guide, shall be any otherwise unto this Nation, then as a
broken Reed to lean upon, and no more then a shadow which shall not save the
people from the heat, nor from the storm; this we know, and this we declare,
in the Name of the Lord; and we are not for Names, nor for Men, nor for Titles
of Government, nor are we for this party, nor against the other, because of its
name, and presence, but we are for Justice, and Mercy, and Truth, and Peace,
and true freedom, that these may be exalted in our Nation; and that goodness,
righteousness, meekness, temperance, peace, and unity, with God, and one with
another; that these things may abound, and be borught forth abundantly, such a
Government are we seeking, and waiting for, wherein truth, and righteousness,
mercy, and justice, unity and love, and all the fruits of holiness may
abound, and all the contrary be removed, cast out, and limmitted; and we are
not for such and such Names, and Titles of Government, that promises fair, and
performs nothing; but if a Council, if a Parliament, if any one Man, or a
number of men whatsoever, that shall have the Spirit of the Lord poured upon
him, or them, and shall be anointed of the Lord for such an use, and end, to
Govern this Nation, under such only shall the Nation be happy, and enjoy rest,
from such men fitted of the Lord, and called by him, and under such a
Government, of truth, and righteousness, shall thou O Nation, enjoy rest from
all thy Travells, and under such a Government, shall the righteous rejoices and
the whole Land sing for joy of heart, when Tyranny, and oppression shall be
clean removed, strife, and contention, and self seeking, utterly abandoned,
and when peace, and truth, flows forth as a stream, and the Lord alone rules
in thy Rulers, and he the principal amongst them, and under such men, and such
a Government only and not under any other, shall thou O Nation, be happy, and
thy people a free people.

Wherefore, O Nation! when will thou begin to look to the Lord; when will thou
begin to set up him, and not man, when will thou mind his Power and Presence
in and through men, more then any men themselves; when shall it once be, O ye
people of our Nation, that you will seek after him, to be the principal and
chief power among you: Oh let your eyes be turned to the Lord alone, that he
may deliver you, and bring salvation and freedom, and look no more at men, but
only as they are in him, and guided by his Spirit; and only expect good from
men, as men are guided by the Lord; and then shall you not ever any more be
deceived, as long you have bin, with Kings, with Parliaments, with Councels,
with Armies, nor any others; for in these have you trusted, and not in the
Lord; from these have you expected great things without him; whenas alas, what
shall men accomplish, or what can they bring forth, while they reject the
Counsel of the Lord, and his Word, as hitherto they have done, and therefore
has he broke them and confounded them, yea, and he will break them and crush
them under his Rod, even till they learn his judgments, and know him the alone
Power, and give honor to him that does whatsoever he will, and he will
overthrow yet once and again, even till he come, whose right it is to Rule,
and he is at work in this his day, and because of iniquities does he visit with
tribulation, and through great tribulation, and overturning of Men, and Powers,
will he advance his own Kingdom, and Government, and the end of all these
things shall bring forth his glory, and men that will not honor him by dealing
righteously in their day upon Earth, they must honor him in their destruction,
at their latter end, and let not men glory one over another, while some are put
down, and others set up, but let them all know, they have but each sort their
hour, and their end will come even as others, for an everlasting Kingdom, and
Government will God set up, that must rule over all, and this is the hope of a
poor despised people, though for present hated of all, and sought to be
destroyed by all, yet our souls are anchored and stayed, even in the sure
promises of our God, in this the day of the Nations trouble, and though we are
very poor, and rejected of all, and have nothing to glory in amongst any party
or sort of people, but even in our reproaches, and sufferings, that we sustain
from all, yet have we perfect rest in God, and satisfactions over all these
distractions, we know him in whom we have believed, and we trust in the shadow
of his wing, and we are not of a doubting heart, concerning what can come, or
whomsoever does Rule, for this we know, though all seeks after our blood, yet
he can deliver us if he will, we know him that can do all things, and if he
save none can destroy, if he bless none can curse; him we know, and in him we
rest, and we give our power in all things to him, and not unto mortal man,
whose breath is in his nostrills, who must perish as the dung, we cannot be
afraid of their horror, nor can we be drawn by their love, but we trust in his
Name, and under his defense shall we be saved, we give our power to him, to be
defended and preserved by him alone, and we are well contented with our
sufferings, and murmurs not, our sufferings are our present Crown; but yet woe
unto that Authority which makes us to suffer, and woe unto the men upon whom
God shall charg the guilt of our oppressions, and woe unto that Spirit that is
found acting against Gods anointed, behold, ye Mountains of the Earth,
behold! ye Rulers, and ye People, the Lord has blessed his people, and every
tongue that rises up in witness against them shall be condemned, and every
weapon that is formed against them shall be broken; this is our hope in this
gloomy day, and the hope of a Kingdom of righteousness, and peace which must
be set up, is our refreshment in this day of trouble, and let not our Enemies
glory over us, for though we are poor, yet shall we be made rich, and though we
have no carnal weapon, yet shall we conquer: and thus have we declared our
selves in much plainness and (...) to our Nation whom we love, and whose
present condition we pity and lament over, and we are freonds to any Appearance
of good, that may come forth in truth and sincerity, and as righteousness
does appear in any, we are ready to join with it in our prayers and desires,
yea, and otherwise; even that which has the Image, of our God upon it,
whenever it shall appear, we shall rejoice therein and add our help thereunto
that it may prosper, for, for the establishing of righteousness in the earth,
our all is not dear unto us, though hitherto we have bin silent and not meddling
with this party or the other, but by way of reproof of the evil in all, and
informing all to the good; and it cannot be charged upon us, that we have sided
with one or another, for we have beheld all hitherto out of the right way as we
have said, but we truly seek the general good of our Nation, and though we are
accounted so and so, yet we have not lost true reason nor understanding, but we
well know what is wrong, and what would be right, even in way of Gover^^^nt,
but the time appears not to be yet, when innocence and simpli^^^^^ of heart
can be embraced, for men are yet too wise in their own wisdom, and cannot
receive the Council of the Lord that they may prosper, and therefore are they,
and must they be confounded amongst themselves; and dashed one against another,
till they learn the way of Righteousness and Truth.

The substance of this was given forth the twentieth day of this tenth month,
being moved of the Lord by his Spirit thereunto, through E. Borough, and is
now judged meet to be published to the Nation, in the behalf of us and our
friends, under our hands.
