THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
IT is the accustomed way to Dedicate Books to some Honorable Person, that
thereby the Book might have the greater Esteem. This Book needs no such
Dedication, for the Name of the Author (which will never dye, Ingenious Mr.
John ted at the end of the Book, whereby the Reader may see it no ways
derogates from the Old Copy, and thereby may see how full and plain the New
Rules are in comparison to the Old.

This Book is a fit Companion for all Gentlemen, Merchants, Scriveners, and
other Tradesmen, that deal much in lending of Money upon Interest, Mortgages,
buying of Estates either in Fee, Copy, or Lease, holding Annuities, Rent
Charges, Forbearance of Money, Discompt, or any other way concerning Interest,
etc.

When any Person does perfectly understand the large Rules, he may if he
pleases lay by the Book, and only use the Compendium with the Tables to be
carried about in a Letter Case; and I hope in perusing this small Treatise the
Reader will find that which will give him Satisfaction, both as to the Rules
and Tables.

Yours, J. D.

Decimal Arithmetic.
A Decimal Fraction is such a one whose Denominator is understood, and not
expressed; and is an Unit with as many Ciphers following it, as there are
Figures and Ciphers in the Numerator.

Corollary, Wherefore the annexing of Ciphers toward the right hand of a
Decimal, alters not its value. A Decimal Fraction of Coin may be easily valued
without the help of Tables. For each Unit in the first place is in value 2 s. 5
in the second place 1 s. and the rest Farthings; but if they exceed 25/48 there
must be two farthings abated.

Example.
So,854 is in value 17 s. 1 d.,418 8. 4

Addition and Substraction in Decimals is the same, as in whole Numbers,
keeping the place of Units just under each other.

Multiplication in Decimals is the same, as in Common Arithmetic, saving as
many Decimal Parts as are in both Multipliers, so many must be cut off from the
Product, which if it have not so many places, the Defect is to be supplied with
Ciphers toward the left hand.

Division is the same as in whole Numbers, without regard to Decimals till the
Work is done, and then use the Converse of the Rule for Multiplication (viz.)
so many Decimals as are in the Dividend, so many there must be in the Divisor
and Quote, and if there be not so many, the Quotient must be supplied with
Ciphers toward the left hand.

Simple Interest.
PROP. 1.
TO compute the Interest for a day, 6/365 is the Interest of 100 l. for a Day
the 1/100, whereof is the Interest of 1 l. for a Day (viz.) 6/36500; Or 6 (with
Ciphers put on at pleasure) divided by 36500 is, 000164383 the Interest of 1 l.
for a Day.

Prop. 2. The Decimals of Days in the Table at the end will serve to find the
amount of 1 l. Simple Interest of any Rate for any time under 365 Days or a
Year.

If you take the Decimal for one day (or more) and multiply that by, 06. 7. 8.
etc. per Cent. or any other Rate, the Product will give the Interest of one
pound for a Day, or more under 366 Days at Simple Interest.

Example 1.
The Decimal for a day is,002739726,06 The Interest of 1 l. for a
day,00016438356

Example 2.
The Decimal of 121 days is,331506849,06 The Interest of 1 l. for 121
days,01989041094,002739726 Decimal for a day,07 per Cent.,00019178082 The
Interest of 1 l. for a day at 7 l. per Cent.

And so of any other rate of Interest.

Prop. 2. Forbearance of Money at Simple Interest.
The Interest of 1 l. for any Number of days, at what rate of Interest you
please, be first found by the first Proposition, that Product multiplied by the
Sum propounded, gives the Interest thereof for the time required.

Example.
To know the Amount of 140 l. for 121 days, at 6 l. per Cent. Simple Interest.

The Decimal of 1 l. for 121 days 1,019890410 Multiplied by 140 Which is 142 l.
15 s. 8 d. 40795616400 1,019890410 142,784657400

Prop. 3. Rebate, or the Present worth of Money due hereafter.
Find the Interest of 1 l. for the time given, as in Prop. 1. And thereto add
an Unit by it. Divide any other Sum propounded, and the Quote is its present
Worth.

Example.
If 142 l. 15 s. 8 d. be due at the end of 121 days, what is it worth in ready
Money? ^

Worth in ready Money 140 l. at 6 l. per Cent. Simple Interest, and may be done
for any other rate of Interest, working by the first Proportion and this former
Rule.

Prop. 4. Equation of Payments.
By Prop. 3. compute all the Present Worths, and then by Proportion. If all
those Present Worths amounted to the Total of all those Payments, what did one
pound amount to in the said time? From the result substract an Unit, the
Remainder is the Interest of 1 l. for the time sought, which divide by the
Interest of 1 l. for a day, the Quote is the Number of days sought.

If you are to Aequate an Annuity, at Simple Interest. I presume a Compendium
may be found in Mengolus his Arithmetical Quadratures (a Book I never saw) who
it is probable by a Compendium gets the fact of an Arithmetical Progression, and
adds Fractions that have a constant Numerator, and an Arithmetical Progression
for their Denominators.

So much for Simple Interest, my Design being more for the Explanation of the
Tables for Compound Interest and Annuities.

Of Compound Interest.
THe Original thereof is Derived from Simple Interest, for if it be Lawful to
take Interest at all, then it is as Lawful to put out the Interest-Money to
Use, as the Principal.

For ease in Calculating Questions that concern Compound Interest,
Arithmeticians do usually frame Tables in store, to show what 1 l. Principal
forborne at any Rate for any determinate time shall amount unto; the
Construction whereof is by the Golden Rule, as follows;

As 100 l. Principal is to the amount thereof at the years end;

So is an Unit. To its amount (to wit.)

So is 1. 1, 06. If 6 be the rate of Interest, then it will hold again for the
next year.

As 1. 1, 06, so 1, 06, to 1, 1236, the principal and Interest at the second
year.

Now because an Unit is in the first place, which does not divide, it
follows, that the second years amount Squares the Number 1, 06, being the
Quotient of 1, 06 divided by 100, and that is the amount of 1 l. forborne a
year, the Compound Interest the third year Cubes it, etc. And the said Number
1, 06 is by Arithmeticians called the Ratio, Quote or Denominator of the Ratio
propounded, and the Logarythm thereof multiplied by the time does raise those
Powers agreeable to the nature of Logarythms.

By the former Proportion was the following Table for years made, or for
Abridgment by Addition, only by help of a Table of 1,06 multiplied by all the
Digits; And this raising of Powers is by some called Involution, and as for
that of Months may be made by finding mean Proportionals, and those of days by
help of the Common Logarythms, or without, supplied far enough downward, by
help of mean Proportionals, and a Decimal Table for time, and three Months here
is understood to be the precise of a whole year, and so of the rest.

That which we add concerning it, is, That it self is in effect no other than a
Table of Logarythms, but of another kind than those in Print, yet herein
agreeing therewith, that in both the Logarythm of an Unit is O, and therefore
this Table may be continued for any large time by one or some few
Multiplications, it is here continued to each year for 50 years, then for every
10 years to 100, whereby you may perceive that an Inheritance, or a Sum due
after such a time is worth little more than a three hundred and fortieth part
of its present Worth.

And in the next place it will supply the Defect of all other Tables
(especially those that relate to the said rate of Interest) whether of Discount
of Money or of Forbearance of and Discount of Annuities, or for the Purchase
thereof.

In the Tables following the number of years are the Logarythms or Indexes, and
the Amounts are the Numbers to which the Logary thms belong, and because this
is no full Table of Logarythms to ten or one hundred thousand, we therefore use
Multiplication and Division to supply those Defects, wherefore the first Prop.
is;

Prop. 1. To continue the said Table.
Multiply the Numbers together that belong to any Numbers of years, that added
together make the years of Continuance required.

Example.
Let it be required to find the Amount of 1 l. for 50 years.

20 Years 3,20713 30 Years 5,74349 50 Years Product is 18,42015

and is the Number sought, omitting the five superfluous places of Decimals.

Another Example.
It is required to find the Amount of 1 l. forborne 20 years three quarters.

20 Years is 3,20713 9 Months 1,04467 The Product 3,25180

And the like may be done for days, and the Converse when an Amount is given,
the time thereto may be found by Division, searching in the Table what Number
amongst the Decimals for time agrees to the Divisors and last Quote. See Prop.
8. the First Section.

And here it is worth noting, That many Questions may be put concerning
Compound Interest, which are of the like difficulty, as to raise the printed
Logarythmetical Cannon.

For Example such a Question may be put;
One pound was put out at Compound Interest, and in 10 years time amounted to
10 l. in what space of time did it amount to 2 l. the answer is the Logarythm
of the Number two (to wit) 3,01023 years which was not raised without much
toil, and the rate of Interest in those Logarythms is near 26 l. per Cent. to
wit 25,89292.

The Uses of the said Table.

Prop. 2. A Sum forborne for any time, to find to what it shall amount to at 6
l. per Cent. Compound Interest.
Find in the Table, or Compute by 1. Prop. the amount of 1 l. for the said
Time, and then it holds.

As 1 l. is to its Amount;

So any other Sum to its Amounts: Wherefore the Amount of 1 l. must be
multiplied by the Sum proposed.

Example.
What shall 136 l. 15 s. 06 d. amount unto being forborne 20 years at 6 per
Centum?

The Amount of 1 l. for 3,20713 20 years is Which multiplied by 136,775 The
Product is 438,655

Reduced is 438 l. 13 s. 1 d. 4^

Prop. 3. A Sum of Money due hereafter, to find what it is worth in ready Money.
Find in the Table what 1 l. forborne, the like time shall amount unto at
Compound Interest, then it holds.

As the said Amount is to an Unit;

So is any Sum propounded, to its present Worth.

Corollary. Therefore if an Unit be the Sum whereof you would find the present
Worth, you will frame the Numbers in the usual Table for Discount, and for all
other Sums: Because an Unit does not Multiply, it will follow they must be
divided by the Amount of 1 l. for the like time.

Discount, or the present Worth of Money due hereafter.

Example first, for making the Table of Discount.
An Unit divided by 3,20713, the Quotient is 311804, the present Worth of 1 l
due 20 years hence.

Example second.
If 400 l. be due 20 years hence, What is it worth in ready Money, abating
Compound Interest at 6 per Centum per Annum?

Divide 400 by 3,20713, the Amount of 1 l. forborne 20 years at Compound
Interest, and the Quotient is 124 l. 722, or 124 l. 14 s. 5 d. And how to
reduce sundry Payments, to an Equation of time at Compound Interest. See first
Example of Prop. 8.

Prop. 4. Of Forbearance of Annuities. To find the Arrearages of an Annuity.
The Difference between the Forbearance of an Annuity, and of a Principal put
out to Interest, is this, that every year there is a Principal like the first
added.

The Proportion holds.

As, 06 the Compound Interest of 1. l. for a year, is to the Amount less by an
Unit of one of one pound forborne at Compound Interest for the time proposed.

So is any Annuity or yearly payment of Rent forborne the like time, and at the
same Rate, to the Arrearages thereof due. And when the Rent

is payable Half-yearly, Quarterly,

the first term in the proportion must

be the Compound Interest of 1 l. for acordingly, etc. Half a year, Quarter,

Example.
Let it be required to find what one pound a year Annuity forborne for 30 years
at 6 per Centum shall amount to.

One pound forborne at Compound Interest so long amounts to 5, 74349 which
lessened by an Unit is 4, 74349 which divided by 06, the Quotient is 79, 0581
and this is the Number found in the Vulgar Tables for forbearance of Annuities.

Second Example.
Let it be required to find what 20 l. Annuity forborne for 15 years shall
amount unto at 6 per Centum.

1 l. Principal forborne 15 years amounts to 2, 39655 from which subtracting an
Unite it holds.

As, 06 to 1,39655 so 20 to 465, 516, that is 475 l. 10 s. 4 d.

Third Example.
A Quarterly Rent of 25 l. was respited 20 years, by the first Proportion the
amount of 1 l. so long forborne was 3, 34978. And the Interest of one pound for
a quarter is 0, 14675 Wherefore by Proportion, As, 014675 Is to 2, 34978: So is
25 to 4003, 032 that is 4003 l. 00 s. 7 d.

This Useful Proportion I thus demonstrate which the Reader may pass by.

Imagine the Land or Stock that yields an Annuity to be such a Principal sent
out for the whole term as will bring in so much yearly Interest as the Annuity
comes to, then at last the whole at Compound Interest is to be repaid, whereof
so much is supposed to be repaid in the Value of the Land, as its first
Principal came to, and the rest in Money; wherefore out of the whole Amount of
that Principal and its Interest, the Principal must be deducted unless to shun
it by that which Geometers call conversion. See Commentators on 16 Def. Quinti
Euclidis etc. we say,

As the first term is to the difference of the first and second;

So the Third Term to the difference of the third and fourth.

The Plain Proportion grounded upon the former Considerations runs thus,

As 1 l. Principal. Is to its Amount for the time forborne;

So the Principal that shall bring in any Annuity proposed. To the Sum of the
said Principal and of the Arrearages of the Annuity.

Then it will hold by conversion of Reason. As 1 l. forborne at Compound
Interest is to its Amount less by an Unit for the time forborne;

So is the Principal of an Annuity, forborne the like time,

To the Arrearages of the Annuity.

And instead of the third term of this Proportion, we may take in a fraction
equivalent thereto, the Numerator whereof is the Annuity or yearly payment of
Rent, and the Denominator the Interest of 1 l. for a year; for to find the
Principal of an Annuity say,

As 6 is to 100. Or rather, 06: 1.

So is the Annuity to its Principal.

And both these latter Proportions compounded into one will be the proportion
first delivered, the Units in each being expunged as insignificant either in
Multiplication or Division.

Prop. 5. To find the present worth of an Annuity.
If an Annuity be forborne till the last payment be due, then for as much as the
Interest of each particular payment is by the former or 4th. Proposition
computed, if by the 3d. Proportion the same, together with the rebate of each
payment be destroyed (to wit) the present worth of the whole Arrearage be
computed it shall be the present worth of the Annuity, the Proportion in both
those Propositions being after the manner of the 4th. prop. composed into one
it will hold for Annual payments at 6 per Centum.

As the fact of (,06) the Interest of 1 l. for a year, and of the Amount of one
pound Compound Interest for the time proposed, is to the said Amount less an
Unit.

So is the Annuity or yearly Rent to the present worth thereof.

Example. First for making the Tables.
To find the present worth of an Annuity of 1 l. per Annum, to continue 25
years at 6 per Centum compound Interest.

The Amount of 1 l. for that time is 4,29187 which Multiplied by,06 the fact
is,257512, whereby dividing 3,29187 the Quote is 12 l.,78335 the present worth
sought.

Example. Secondly for half-yearly Payments.
An Annuity of 40 l. payable, 20 l. each half year is to befold for 12 years at
6 per Centum.

The Compound Interst of 1 l. for half a year is --,029564 The amount of 1 l.
forborne 12 years -- 2,012196

Multiply these two together, and that added together makes the fact of both;

Which is --,058487 It therefore holds,

As,058487 is to,1,012196.

So is 20 to 346, 166 that is 346 l. 3 s. 4 d. the present worth thereof.

If this Annuity were paid yearly it must be of less Value because the money is
longer in coming in, and accordingly the worth of it l. s. d. would be but --
335 -- 7 -- 1 Admit it were required to know what an addition of 8 years more
is worth after 12 are expired. The worth of the said Annuity for 20 years, is
-- 458. 15. 11 The difference of these two is -- being the present worth of the
8 years sought. 123. 8. 10

Prop. 6. To find what Annuity any Sum of ready Money shall purchase.
This is but the Converse of the former Proposition, and it holds therefore;

As the Amount of 1 l. forborne at Compound Interest less an Unit is to the fact
of, 06 and of the Amount of one pound so forborne,

So is any Sum of ready money to the Annuity it shall purchase.

In this and the two former propositions by,06 is understood the Compound
Interest of 1 l. for a year, and when the payment is by quarters or half years,
instead thereof must be put in the Interest of a quarter or half a year. And
instead of the Annuity or yearly payment, the Quarterly or Half-yearly payment
accordingly.

Corollary.
If 1 l. be the sum of ready money then the two middle Terms of the proportion
are the fact above mentioned, and you will frame the other Vulgar Table for
this purpose.

Example the first.
To find what Annuity 1 l. shall purchase to continue 30 years, it holds;

As 4,74349 to,06. So 5,74349 to 0,07264.

Example Second.
Let it be required to find what rent payable yearly 8 l. shall purchase at 6
per Centum to continue 21 years.

As 2,39956 the Amount less an Unit of 1 l. for 21 years is to,20397 the fact
of,06 and the amount,

So is 8 to,68 or 13 s. 7 d. the Annuity sought.

Memorandum, That by the Fact is meant that you should multiply the foregoing
Figures by,06. Viz. 2,39956 by,06,

Which makes 2,2039736.

Now whereas the Lease of a house of 1 l. per Annum to continue 21 years is
commonly sold for 8 l. or 8 years purchase, and your money will purchase a
certainty but of 13 s. 7 d. ^ per Annum, you see by this supposition you are
abated 6 s. 5 d. 3/^nt of Taxes Reparations and Casualties; and verygood Reason
there is for great abatements, for a Tenant taking a Lease on a Tunber house,
if it be burnt down by a Fire beginning at his Neighbors as leases commonly
Run, is bound to build it up again and has no relief either in Law or Equity
against his Landlord, as I am informed by able Council, only he has the
benefit of a Benevolence, his Action against them where the fire began (who
perchance are ruined.)

s. s. d. will purchase an -- 11 -- 11 10 Annuity to continue 21 years of -- 12
-- 9 10 -- 14 -- 5 -- 15 -- 17 1 -- 5 -- 3 -- 1-00-0

Hence it appears that the Value of Leases of Houses cannot be estimated near
the Truth by the Common Tables for Annuities at the current rate of Interest,
and that if any one would use them to this purpose it were much nearer the
truth first to abridge the Rent as aforesaid.

Prop. 7. Any number of years in a Lease or Annuity being propounded to find
the present Worth of any greater or lesser Number of years therein.
This is one of the most usual and useful Propositions of this Nature, and as
propounded is not sufficiently Limited, and the Question in this Cas^ will be,
What is the most equitable rate of Interest whereby to resolve the Proposition;
to find out which it is either necessary to assign how many years purchase the
Fee Simple or Inheritance is worth, or the present Worth of a Lease of any
Number of years therein.

1. If the Worth of the Inheritance be assigned, then thereby divide 100 the
Quote shows the Annual Interest for.

Example:
Let the Fee Simple or Copyhold Lands be worth 16 years 8 months Purchase,
then dividing 100 by 16 the Quotient is 6, whereof 6 pound in the 100 is an
equitable Rate of Interest whereby to compute the present worth of a Lease of
any number of years therein, and so e contra if money were at 8 per Centum, the
Laws of Arithmetic allow the worth of the Inheritance of the best Land that
is, to be but 12 years Purchase, which some would confirm, from this reason,
because otherwise their money would yield a better income at Simple or Compound
Interest, but the most proper Reason is derived from the Nature of a
Geometrical Progression decreasing ad Infinitum; for instance, admit you have a
Tenant in the Tenure or Possession of 1 l. per Annum, and you say to him, pay
the rent now that will be due at the end of 1 Years, etc. ad infinitum. 2 3 4
and you will rebate him after the rate of Compound Interest. I say the Total of
all those Payments shall never exceed 12 l. 10 s. 00 d.

The Proportion for casting up the sum of a sinite Geometrical Progression runs
thus,

As the difference of an assumed extreme and its next inward mean is to the
next inward mean;

So is the difference of the remote extremes to the sum of the Progression,
except the assumed extreme.

The reason whereof is, That if a rank of Numbers be in Geometrical Progression
their sums and differences are likewise in the same Proportion. See 35 of 9
Book of Euclid, or Briggs his Arithmetica Logarithmica.

Example.
6, 18, 54, 162, 486, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729

Wherefore it holds by Euclid. 6 As one difference Is to its Consequent -- 9 So
is the Sum of all the differences (which is here the difference between the
first and last term) -- 726

To the Sum of all the Consequents is 1089.

Wherefore the sum of the whole progression is -- 1092.

And supposing this Progression to decrease infinitely, then will the first
term be o, and the sum of all the Differences 729, and it holds. As ^

Wherefore the sum of this infinite Progression is 1093, and can never exceed
it, and the said progression continued but in part toward the left hand, would
stand thus, etc. 1/729 1/243 1/81 1/27 1/9 I.

2. But admit the present worth of a Lease for a certain number of years be
given, some third term must be further given, let that be the yearly rent, and
then you cannot assign the rate; (and the contrary) in this Case to find the
rate is one of the most difficult Questions that commonly happens about
Annuities, because the Proposition in the 5, 6, (also 4th.) Prop. will not hold
conversly, there are but two terms in the Proposition given, which contain but
a bare ratio, etc. therefore though out of Tables of Forbearance of Money at
compound Interest, you can make those for Annuities, yet the converse will not
hold.

In this Case you must either by help of the 5 Prop. and common Logarithms, or
of Tables of the present worth of Annuities, calculated to the best rate that
shall suit the Inheritance, find the present worth of the Number of years
proposed according to two rates assumed as near the truth as you can possible,
and then if you have not lighted upon the given worth of the years assigned,
use the help of this Approximation.

As the difference of the present worths found, is to the difference of the
assumed rates of Interest;

So the difference between the given worth and the truest of those Trial worths;

To the difference between the rate of Interest of the trial worth and that
sought.

And when the rate of Interest is truly found, compute accordingly the present
worth of the years sought.

But this were to send away the Reader, as if we could in this Case give no
answer to the question, by help of the table here used; whereto I answer, That
if the worth of the Inheritance be assigned, repair to the following
Proposition.

But if not, let the Casualty as in the 6th. Proposition be reduced to a
certainty; viz. if it concern the Lease of a house which is a Casualty, abridge
the Annual Rent, and then you may by the 5th. Prop. cast up the Value of any
Number of Years therein.

But herein I would not be misunderstood, as if when a Lease of a House of 1 l.
yearly for 21 Years is sold for 8 l. 10 s. the which will purchase an Annuity
or Certainty of 14 s. 5 per Annum, and any Number of years in this Certainty
shall be equivolent to as many in that Casualty, that therefore Tables made to
both Rates, and a Computation to both the Yearly Rents must needs agree,
because all Tables of Annuities are made for Certainties not Casualties.

Or lastly, repair to the first and last Prop. and you will there find how to
cast up the Amount of 1 l. Principal for any time, and at any Rate, where the
true manner of such Equations is showed.

In this second Case is couched two usual Questions, most commoly propounded
without sufficient Limits: As,

1. When a Lease is sunk by a Fine to a certain Yearly Rent, for a certain term
of time, What the whole Lease is worth: Or,

2. What any number of years to be added, after the term in Lease is expired,
is worth.

In Order to the Resolution of either of these Questions it must be agreed how
much the sunk Rent was, or at least as much given as before was required, and
then as before you have a foundation whereon to raise a Rate of Interest, for
there is now given the yearly Rent sunk, its present worth, and the time, and
the Rate being found, you may then, according as is done in the 5th. Prop.
resolve both these Questions.

Prop. 8. A Table for the forbearance of Money at any Rate of Interest being in
store to extend it to serve to all other Rates.
It was before asserted that any such Table was a Table of Logarithms, and if
filled up with Proportionable Numbers (by 1. Prop.) or otherwise suitable to
such time or Decimals thereof, as may come in use, might for these purposes be
more convenient than those already made, because it would admit a manifold
Proof, as also because the differences would not be so vast near the beginning,
but in some other respects inferior thereto. And so contrarily, a Number being
assigned to find the Logarithm thereto made, upon any kind of Rate or
Supposition, it may easily be done out of the Common Logarithms, for the
differences of all Logarithms are either equal or directly Proportional.

Example first.
As 74108, Speidells difference of the Logarithm of 13 and 14.

Is to 32184 d. Brigs his difference of those Logarithms;

So is 16000, Speidells difference of the Logarithms of 62 and 63.

To 69487, the difference of those Logarithms in Mr. Brigs, or the Common
Tables.

Moreover Van Schooten in his Miscellanies gives you an Account of all Numbers
under 1000, that are prime or incomposite, to wit, 1226 in Number, viz. the
which no other Number will divide, to the which if the differences be first
found by Proportion, which in this Case having the two fixed Terms fixed, may be
converted into a Multiplication or Division, and that Multiplier or Divisor
being Multiplied by all the Digits into an Addition or Substraction, the
Logarithms of all the Composite Numbers will easily be made out of the rest, by
the continual Addition of the Logarithm of 2, or otherwise.

In the Table here used the time is the Logarithm, and the Amount the Number
thereto belonging, and a Proportion accordingly may be applied to any kind of
Logarithms, to find the Excess of time above a year, in which a 100 l. at 6 per
Centum did amount to 108 l. But it may be more easily thus done.

As, 02530586, the Logarithm of the Amount 1, 06.

Is to 1, viz. One year the time that 1 l. Principal was forborne;

So is, 03342375 the Logarithm of the Amount 1, 08.

To 1, 32079, the time required, and that is 1 Year, 3 Months, and about 26
Days, and thus the nearest way of resolving such a Proposition, having the
Common Logarithms in Store, is by a Division of the Logarithms: But supposing
no such Tables, it may be supplied by two Divisions by help of this Table,
which I shall explain in two Cases.

Sect. 1. The Amount of 1 l. being proposed, to find what time it must be
forborne, at 6 per Centum to amount unto as much.

Divide the given Amount by some Amount in the Table, next lesser, and that
Quotient, again by the next lesser Amount, reserving the Quotient.

If the time in the Tables belonging to the two first Divisors, and last Quote
be added together, it is the time sought.

Example.
1 l. in a Year at 8 per Centum did amount to 1 s., 08, in what time at 6 per
Centum, shall it amount to so much.

In Decimals Time Dividend 108 1. Divisor -- 106 -- 1 Year 1 Quote -- 1,018867
Second Dividend 2. Divisor -- 1,014675 -- 3 Months,25 1,0041 Quote 26 days
fere,07079 1,32079

But to save the Reader this trouble we have added the Equated time for these
Rates.

l. years 100 l. shall 105 In,83732 at 6 per 106 1 Centum 107 1,16114 amount
108 1,32079 unto 109 1,47896

And by the second Proposition the present worth of sundry payments due
hereafter being computed, after the manner of this Example, a ^ue time may be
found when the total of all those Payments may equitably be paid at once.

Sect. 2. The Rate of Compound Interest, and the time being given to find what
1 l. Principal did amount to in that time.

Or rather let it be thus proposed:

How long shall one pound at 6 per Cent. be forborne to amount to as much as 1
l. forborne any space of time at any other Rate of Interest does amount unto,
and what is the said Amount?

By the time Proposed multiply the Equated time, next before found (in the
first Case) that agrees to the Rate proposed, and you have the time sought, and
what it shall amount, is found by the first Proposition.

For instance, if 1 l. be forborne 18 years at 8 per Centum, what shall it
amount to?

Or (...)
How long shall 1 l. at 6 per Centum be forborne, to amount 10 as much, as if
the said 1 l. had been forborne 18 years at 8 per Centum, and what is the said
Amount?

By the former Example the Equated time or Logarithm of the Ratio found, was,

years 1,3207 This Multiplied by 18, the Product is 23,7726

To wit the time of forbearance.

And the Product of the Interest Sums belonging to the true time is 3,99601 --
or 3 l. 19 s. 11 d. the Amount of 1 l. forborne 18 years at Compound Interest,
and the Amount of 1 l. being in Store, you see before that thereby all other
Questions concerning Annuities are Resolved.

But when the Law settles a New Rate of Interest, it may be more speedy to
frame a Table thereto, or use such as the Scale of Interest, or other Authors
afford. Now what I have hitherto wrote was chiefly to explain the Use of the
Table, and to show, That in case of necessity, with a little more pains, it
takes away those Multitudes of Tables that are made, as well for quarterly as
yearly Payments, at several Rates for Interest and Annuity Questions, and by
reason it, with its Precepts, is contained in one quarter of a sheet of Paper,
which I made my constant Companion in my Letter Case, that thou might reap
the like benefit of it, it is also Printed apart. It is not my intent to
enlarge upon a Multitude of Particular Questions, which would all be reduced
unto or resolved by some of the former Propositions. That I leave to the
Practice of the Studious.

MErcennus in the Preface of his Synopsis Mathematica, speaking of certain
Supplements made to Geometry, and amongst the rest of Torricello's Hyperbolical
Solid of an infinite length, found equal to a finite Cylinder, says, That a
certain Geometer found the like in a Space made by a curved Line drawn through
the tops, all right proportional Lines (supposed) and by a right Line, on which
the said Proportional Lines stand as Perpendiculars at a like parallel distance
from each other; if it may be said to be a Space which is not closed, unless
perchance at an infinite distance, which Proportionals, he says, would not
long after be published: He wrote it in 1644, but as yet I cannot hear of any
such Treatise.

Now, as I said before, the time being the Logarithms, and the Amounts the
Proportional Numbers thereto belonging, by the help of the Curved Line he
mentions (which may also be described by mean or continual Proportionals in
Lines without the help of Numbers) the Logarithmetical Lines of Numbers, Sines,
Tangents, Versed Sines, on Gunter's Rule may be Graduated, and the Meridian
Line of Mercator's Projection, or the true Sea Chart (being in the same Ratio
with the Logarithmetical Tangents) supplied, and whereas he mentions by one
Curved Figure, there will also arise another for the same purpose, when the
equal parts increasing in Arithmetical Progression, are raised as
Perpendiculars on their Proportional Numbers placed in a base Line, and then
the tops of those Perpendiculars joined with a slexuous Curved Line passing
through them; but the Properties of these Figures as their Areas or Contents,
Centors of Gravity, round Solids, and their first and second Segments, etc. are
not as yet treated of by Geometers, and perchance might be more worthy their
Contemplation than diverse other Speculations, which seem to be of less Use, to
which (amongst many) might be added the Curves made by the Annuity Lines, and
the Curve in Mercator's Chart that represents a Semicircle of the great Arch,
with a method of discribing it by Points, or Instrument (if possible) from its
own Intrinsic Nature, without the help of Calculations or other Projections;
also how to cut a Cylinder that the Surface thereof unrolled shall render the
Curve proposed of the like Nature, standing upon the Stage of Proposal, have
troubled all France and Galileus for 35 years together, and since his death
received their Resolution.

The Doctrine of DECIMAL ARITHMETIC, Simple Interest, etc.

AS ALSO Of Compound Interest and Annuities:

Generally performed for any time of Payment, or Rate of Interest, by help of
any particular Table of Forbearance of 1 l. Principal.

Abridged for Portability in a Letter Case.

By John Collins Accomptant, Philomath.

A Decimal Fraction is such a one whose Denominator is understood and not
expressed; and is an Unit with as many Ciphers following it, as there are
Figures and Ciphers in the Numerator.

Corollary. Wherefore the annexing of Ciphers toward the right hand of a
Decimal alters not its value. A Decimal Fraction of Coin may be easily valued
without the help of Tables. For each Unit in the first place is in value 2 s. 5
d. in the second place 1 s. and the rest Farthings; but if any exceed 15/48
there must be Farthings abated:

So,854 is in value 17 s. 1 d.,418 8 4.

Addition and Substraction in Decimals is the same as in whole Numbers, keeping
the place of Units under each other.

Multiplication in Decimals; as many Decimal parts as are in both Multipliers,
so many must be cut off from the Product; which if it have not so many places
the Defect is to be supplied with Ciphers toward the left hand.

Division in Decimals is the Converse annex Ciphers sufficient (if need be) to
the Dividend toward the right hand, that it may have more Decimal Parts than
the Divisor, then as many Decimal Parts as are in the Dividend, so many must be
in the Divisor, and Quote, when the Division is finished; and in case of
defect, the Quote is to be supplied with Ciphers toward the left hand.

Simple Interest.
Prop. 1. To compute the Interest of 1 l. for a Day.
6/105 is the Interest of 100 l. for a day, the 1/100 whereof is the Interest
of 1 l. for a day, viz. 6/16500, Or 6 divided by 36500, namely,

Days Interest of 1 l. 1,000164384 2,000328768 3,000493152 4,000657536
5,000821920 6,000986304 7,001150688 8,001315072 9,001479456

Prop. 2. Forbearance of Money at Simple Interest.
The Interest of one pound for any number of Days may be taken from this Table
by Addition, (instead of a Multiplication, by the number of days, the trouble
whereof is by the help of this Table spared) and that Product multiplied by any
other given Sum, makes the Interest thereof for the time given.

Prop. 3. Rebate, or the present worth of Money due hereafter.
Find the Interest of one pound, for the time given, and thereto adding an
Unit. By it divide any other Sum given, and the Quote is its present worth.

Prop. 4. Equation of Payments.
By Prop. 3. Compute all the present worths, and then by Proportion. If all
those present worths amounted to the Total of all those Payments, What did 1 l.
amount to in the said time? From the Result substract an Unit, the Remainder is
the Interest of 1 l. for the time sought, which divide by the Interest of 1 l.
for a day, the Quote is the number of days sought. If you are to Equate an
Annuity at Simple Interest, I presume a Compendium may be found in Mengolus his
Arithmetical Quadratures, (a Book I never saw) who its probable by a Compendium
gets the Fact of an Arithmetical Progression, and adds Fractions that have a
constant Numerator, and an Arithmetical Progression for their Denominators.

The annexed Table is a Table of the Forbearance or Amount of 1 l. at Compound
Interest at 6 per Cent. per An. This Table as to the Years, is composed by the
continual Multiplication of 1,06 (or by Addition tabulating the same) and as to
the Days may be supplied either by continual Proportionals, or the common
Logarithms, which also are no other than Answers to Interest Questions, at the
rate of near 26 per Cent. (or the Amount is as 1, to 1,2589292) supposing 1 l.
in 10 Years to amount to 10 l. the Logarithms (distinguishing the first Figure
with a Conmma) show the Years and Decimals when it amounted to 2 l. 3 l. etc.
And those Logarithms may be raised from the former. For the differences of all
sorts of Logarithms of any four Numbers, are directly Proportional, and may be
raised from any Table of Forbearance of Money at Compound Interest.

Prop. 1. To continue the said Table, or to find the Amount of 1 l. forborne for
any time proposed.
Multiply those Amounts together that belong to such time, as added together
makes the time given.

Prop. 2. The Amount of 1 l. being given, To find the time of Forbearance.
Search the Amount in the Tables, and divide by the next lesser amount, and
that Quote again by the next lesser Amount, etc. reserving the Quotes, the time
belonging to the Divisors, and the last Quote is the time sought. Example, 1 l.
did amount to 1,08 in 1,32079 years.

Prop. 3. To compute the Amount of 1 l. for any time at any Rate of Interest.
By Prop. 2. compute in what time at 6 per Cent. 1 l. shall amount to as much
as in one Year at the Rate proposed, that keep in store, and multiply by the
time proposed, the Fact is the time in which at 6 per Cent. 1 l. shall amount
to as much as it should do at the other Rate given; to know which, use Prop. 1.

Example, 100 l. did amount to 105 l. in, 83732 Years.
l. Or, 1 l. did amount to 1,05 In Years,83732 1,06 1, 1,07 1,16114 1,08
1,32079 1,09 1,47896 1,10 1,63569

Admit it were required to find what 1 l. amounted to in 20 Years at 8 per
cent. multiply 1,32079 by 20, the Fact or Product is 26,14158, and by Prop. 1.
1 l. at 6 per cent. in that time did amount to 4 6609.

Now if the Amount of 1 l. be given, Annuity Problems are salved thereby. And
for the advantage of this Proposition the Decimals of time were added.

Prop. 4. Forbearance of Moneys at Compound Interest.
As an Unit is to its Amount in the Tables suitable to the time given:

So is any other Sum to its Amount.

Prop. 5. Discount of Money at Compound Interest, the Converse of the former.
As the Tabular Number,

Is to an Unit, its present Worth:

So is any other Sum, To its present Worth.
In Annuity Questions the Proportions are suited for yearly Payments; if the
Payment be half-yearly, then instead of,06 (or 1,06) and the Annuity in any
term, take half a years Interest,029565, and the half yearly Payment; and for
quarterly Payments the Quarters Interest,014674, and the quarterly Payment, etc.

Prop. 6. Forbearance of Annuities.
As,06 the Annual Interest of 1 l.

Is to the Amount less an Unit of 1 l. forborne any term:

So is the Annuity or yearly Pension,

To the Sum for the whole Arrearages thereof.

Prop. 7. Discount of Annuities, or their present Worth.
As the Fact of,06 and of the Amount of 1 l at Compound Interest for the time
proposed,

Is to the said Amount less an Unit:

So is any Annuity, To its present Worth,
To this Proposition belongs the Purchase of the Fee-simple.
For yearly Payments divide the Rent 1 l. by the Interest,06 the Quotes are 16,
half-yearly,5,0295613 16,91303 quarterly,25,01674 17,07843

And so many pounds (or years purchase) is the Inheritance worth (as may be
proved from Tacquet's Arithmetic) which Sums are no other than the Totals of
the present Worths of the infinite Payments to be made. Hereto also belong
Equation of Payments at Compound Interest: for having computed the present
Worths, by proportion, you may find what 1 l. amounted to in the time sought,
and by the second Proposition the time it self.

Prop. 8. To find what Annuity any Sum of ready Money shall purchase for any
time proposed.
As the Amount less an Unit of 1 l. forborne at Compound Interest, the time
proposed,

Is to the Fact of, 06, and of the Amount of 1 l. so forborne:

So is any Sum of ready Money,

To the Annuity it shall purchase.

From these three Propositions the Tables in common use may be raised, if you
put an Unit in the third place.

Prop. 9. The Worth of an Annuity being proposed, To find the time of its
Continuance.
Get the difference of the Facts of 1,06 into the Annuity,

And of,06 into the Sum of the present Worth and Annuity,

Then, as the said difference, is to an Unit:

So is the Annuity, To the Amount of 1 l. for the time sought (to be found by
the second Proposition.)

Prop. 10. An Annuity, its present Worth, and time of Continuance proposed, To
find the Rate of Interest.
This is the hardest of Annuity Problems, and not to be resolved with
Logarithms without Position or Trials; the use is to find the value of any
other Number of Years therein: To facilitate which, observe, That by Prop. 8.
for 21 years at 6 per Cent. you may purchase Annuity of

s. d. For l. s. 11 11 7 00 12 9 7 10 13 7 8 00 14 5 8 10 15 3 9 00 17 10 00

And these are the Rates for Leases of Houses of such a time, to wit, 1 l. a
year for 21 years, is worth about 7 l. 10 s. or 8 l. as men agree, which is a
certainty of 12 s. 9 d. or 13 s. 7 d. per Annum, whereby you have a direction
to accord an abate for Casualty, and then use the 6 Proposition. Most of the
many Propositions in the Learned Doctor Wallis his Arithmetic concerning
Geometrical Progression; as also in Mr. Dary's sheet of Algebra, may be easily
resolved by help of the former Table: But this I have handled in my Supplements
to Accomptantship, where also somewhat of Logarithm Curves, derived from Mean
or Continual Proportionals, or Tables of Interest, and serve for making the
Logarithm Scales of Numbers, Sines, Tangents, (or Mercator's Meridian Line)
Geometrically.

Prop. 9. More easily.
As on Annuity, less the Fact of,06 into its present Worth,

Is to the Annuity: So is an Unit, To the Amount of 1 l. for the time sought.
If the Payments be half yearly, for the Annuity in the first and third Terms,
take half the Annuity, and for,06 in the first Term as a Multiplier, take,02956
the half Years Interest.

For another Rate of Interest as 8 per Cent. take in,08 as a Multiplier, and
find the time in Years and Decimals by 2. Prop. as at 6 per Cent. which divide
by the fitted Number of the Rate in Prop. 3. to wit 1,32079, the Quote is the
true time sought in Years and Decimals, which is easily reduced into Days by
the Decimal Table of Days.

Example.
50 l. a Year at 8 per Cent. is worth 490 l. 18 s. 2, or 490,91, the time of
continuance is 20 years. ^

An Amount is proposed for 20 years to be 4,6609, what is the Rate of Interest?

1. The time in which 1 l. came to so much at 6 per Cent. is 26,4158, found by
the second Proposition.

2. Divide 26,4158 by 20, the time proposed, the Quote is 132079 years.

3. 1 l. at 6 per Cent. in that time amounted to 1,08, the Ratio sought.

A PERPETUAL ALMANAC,
To find what day of the Week the first of March shall happen upon.

ADD to the Number 2 the Year of our Lord, and the fourth part of that,
neglecting the odd, and divide by 7, the Remainder is the day of the Week; but
if none remains it is Saturday, for you must account from Sunday, Monday, etc..

Example.
So that the First of March is the First Day, that is, Sunday.

The Number -- 2 The Year of our Lord, 1685. 1685 The fourth Part -- 421
Divisor -- ^

To find on what day of the Week any Day of any Month in the said Year happens.
To perform this Proposition, the following Verse being in Effect a Perpetual
Almanac, is to be kept in Memory.

In this Verse are twelve Words relating to the Number of the twelve Months of
the Year, accounting March the First; wherefore the word proper to that Month,
is An, and so in order of the Alphabet, which will never exceed Seven; and the
Number of the said Letter shows what day of the Month proper to the said word
shall be the same day of the Week the First of March happened upon, as the
Example above.

To find the Prime or Golden Number and Epact.
Add to the Number 1 the Year of our Lord, and divide by 19, the remainder
gives the Prime. Multiply the Prime by 11, and divide by 30, gives the Epact.

A Table of Primes or Golden Numbers and Epacts for ever. ^

To find Easter for ever.
Substract the Epact (if less than 28 or 29) from 47, if the Epact be 28 or 29
from 77, the remainder is Easter limits; so the first Sunday after the
remainder, beginning from March, is Easter Sunday.

To find the Age of the Moon.
Add to the Epact the Day of the Month, and so many more as there are Months
from March (accounting March one) the Sum if less than 30 is the Moon's Age (if
more) Substract 30, (when 31 Days in the Month) but if 30 Days or less,
Substract 29, the Remainder is the Moon's Age.

To find the Southing of the Moon, and High Water at London Bridge.
Multiply the Moon's Age by 8/10 shows the Southing, to which add 3 hours,
shows High Water at London Bridge.

To find it another way.
Multiply the Moon's Age by 4, and divide by 5, the Quotient shows it, every
Unit that remains is in value 12 Minutes, at full Moon reject 15 from it. Add
to this 3 hours, shows High Water at London Bridge.

To find what Day of the Month the Sun enters into any Sign of the Zodiac, by
the following Verse.
Aries Taurus Gemini Cancer Leo Virgo



Evil attends its Object, unva^^'d Vice,

Libra Scorpio Sagittar. Capricorn Aquar. Pisces



Vain Villains, jest into a Paradise.

In which are twelve Words to represent the twelve Months of the Year, the
first March, the second April, etc. and over the respective Words are the
Characters of the twelve Signs of the Zodiac, thereby denoting, that in the
Month to which the Word belongs, the Sun is in that Sign over head: And if it
be required to know the day of the Month in which the Sun enters into any of
those Signs; if the first Letter of the Word, proper to the Month, be a
Consonant, the Sun enters into the Sign thereto belonging on the eighth Day of
the said Month, as in the Word Paradise, belonging to February, in that Month
he enters Pisces the eighth Day; but if it be a Vowel, as all the rest are, add
so many Days unto eight, as the Vowel denotes; now the Vowels are but five in
Number.

To know in what Degree of the said Sign he is for any other Day.
If the Number of the Day of the given Month exceed the Number of that Day in
which the Sun enters into any Sign, Substract the lesser from the greater, and
the Remainder is the Degree.

Example.
On the 21 of April I would find the Sun's place by the Verse. It appears the
Sun enters into Taurus on the ninth of that Month, which taken from 21, there
remains 12, showing that the Sun is in the 12 Degree of Taurus, the second Sign.

2. But if the Number of the Day of the given Month be less than the Number of
that Day in which the Sun enters into the beginning of any Sign, the Sun is not
entered into the said Sign, but is still in the Sign belonging to the former
Month. In this Case Substract the given Day from the Day of his Entrance into
the next Sign, and again Substract the Remainder from 30, and the Remainder
shows his place in the Sign of the former Month.

Example.
Let it be required to know the Sun's place the fifth of August on the
thirteenth day of the Month the Sun enters into Virgo, 5 from 13 rests 8, and
that taken from 30 there remains 22, showing that the Sun is in the 22 degree
of Leo, the fifth Sign.

FINIS.
