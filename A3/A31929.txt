BY THE KING.
His Majesty's gracious Proclamation to the Cittyes of London and Westminster.
WHEREAS amongst other Arts used by the Promoters of this horrid and desperate
Rebellion against Us, great Industry and Subtilty has been applied to corrupt
Our Subjects of Our Cittyes of London and Westminster, first by engaging them
in Factions and Tumults to awe the Members of both Our Houses of Parliament who
would not consent to their seditious Designs; then by persuading them to
Loanes and Contributions for the maintenance of the Army now in Rebellion
against Us, upon pretense that the same was raised for the defense of Our
Person* the Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and Privilege of
Parliament (WHEREAS in truth it is for the destruction of them all) by their
yielding obedience to, and executing the pretended Ordinance of the Militia:
and lastly by infusing into them a desperate sense of their own Condition, and
that We are so much incensed against them for the premises, that We intend to
plunder, and give up the wealth of those Our Cittyes as a prey to Our
Soldiers; We do hereby declare, That We are yet far from being so much
incensed against those Our Cittyes as these men desire to be believed, and in
truth have endeavored to make Us; but We believe that those Tumults were
contrived by the Persons whom We have formerly accused of that practice, and
raised out of the meanest and poorest People of those Our Cittyes and Suburbs
without the privity and consent of the best and substantial Cittyzens and
Inhabitants, and that the Loanes and Contributions which have been since raised
(though they have passed more generally then We expected from the duty and
sobriety of men of fortunes and understanding) have been wrested and extorted
from them by threats and menaces, and fear of plundering and violence. And
therefore We do hereby offer Our free and gracious Pardon to all the Cittyzens
and Inhabitants of Our said Cities of London, and Westminster for all Offenses
concerning the premises committed against Us before the publishing of this Our
Proclamation (except all those Persons whom We have excepted in Our Declaration
of the 12 of August, and except Alderman Fulke and Captain Manwaring, against
all which We shall proceed according to the Rules of Law, as against Traitors
and Stirrers of sedition against Us) and We do assure them in the word of a
King, that no violence shall be offered by Our Army, or any part of it to any
of them, not doubting but their demeanor will henceforward be such* that We
shall not be compelled to bring Our Army against them. Provided that this Our
Grace shall not extend to any Person, who after the publishing this Our
Proclamation shall presume by Loan or Contribution to assist the said Army of
Rebels to assemble and muster themselves in Arms without Authority derived
from Us under Our hand, or to enter into any Oath of Association for the
Assistance of the Earl of Essex, how spetiously soever the same be pretended
for Our safety, for since the encounter on Sunday the 22th of this Month where
they used all possible means and malice to have destroyed Us, and whe^^e it
pleased God to give Us so great a victory over them (though with the loss of
many worthy man) no man can be unsatisfied in the mischief and malice of their
Rebellion, And therefore We must, and do declare, That whosoever shall
henceforward by Money, Plate, or otherwise assist the said Rebellion, shall
take Arms by virtue of any pretended Ordinance, or shall enter into any Oath
of association against Us, or without Our Consent, shall be esteemed by Us as
an Enemy to the public Peace, a Person disaffected to Us, the Religion and
Law of the Kingdom, and shall accordingly receive condign punishment; of which
We give them timely notice, that they may proceed accordingly at their perils.
And to the end that they may receive all possible and particular assurance from
Us of Our gracious Intentions toward them, We shall be willing that such a
number of grave and substantial Cittyzens be employed from Our said City to
Us, as shall by them be thought fit, who may propose such things to Us on their
behalf as shall be desired, to which We shall give a gracious and just Answer.
And we do assure them and all the world, that as the Scandalls and Imputations
upon Us concerning Our favoring of Papists have been groundless, and
maliciously contrived by the Authors of this Rebellion to beget a
misundertanding between Us and Our Subjects, so all the professions We have
made in Our several Declarations for the suppression of Popery, and the
maintenance of the true reformed Protestant Religion established in the Church
of England, and for the defense of the Laws of the Land, and the just
Privileges of Parliament shall be as inviolably observed by Us, as We expect
blessing from the Almighty God, and obedience from Our Subjects.

Given at Our Court at Ayno this 27. of October. in the Eighteenth years of Our
Reign.
God save the King.
