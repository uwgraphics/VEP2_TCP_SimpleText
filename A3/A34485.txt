YORK: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty:
And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.

To our much Honored Friends, Sir Thomas Hutchinson Knight, and Robert Sutton
Esquire. Knights of the Shire, for the County of Nottingham.
Gentlemen,
FInding to our great grief (by diverse printed Declarations) the unhappy
differences betwixt his Majesty and His Parliament, and from thence
apprehending great fear of further distractions, we have thought fit to impart
our hearts freely unto you as men chosen by us, and entrusted for us, to
represent us, and our desires in Your Honorable House of Commons. Where, in
the first place, upon all occasions, we desire you to tender the
acknowledgement of our humble and hearty thanks for those many good Laws, which
by their Care and Wisdom, together with his Majesty's Grace and Favor have
been obtained for us, both for the securing us in the point of our Property,
and also for the fre^ing us from the unlimited power of Arbitrary government:
And herein His Majesty having concurred with you in all that we could expect
or can desire both for our Persons and Estates, and at several times promised
to join with his Parliament, for the reforming and reducing both the Doctrine
and Discipline of the Church to the best and purest times since the
Reformation; And if this were done, what others would expect we know not, we
desire (...) him for the future. This is the clear expression of our hearts;
this is that we desire you to consent in for us. And we shall heartily pray
that we might be an example to many others to make the like expressions: And
then we should not doubt but this would bring a right Understanding betwixt the
King and his people, and take away all fears and jealousies, and settle a firm
peace amongst us. We should gladly, with all humility, have petitioned your
Honorable House but still to this purpose. And we Understand some Countries
have done so, which has been displeasing unto them because contrary to their
sense, and we, perhaps, through ignorance might fall into the same error. Yet
we hope it will not be displeasing unto you, that we give you our sense freely,
for you are us, and we hope you will not be unwilling to follow our sense, so
far as you conceive it to be the sense of your County whose you are, and for
whom you serve.

And so we rest your very loving Friends, and Countrymen. JOhn Digby, High
