His Majesty's GRACIOUS MESSAGE To the COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT, January, the
Fourth, 1680/81.
CHARLES R.

HIS Majesty received the Address of this House, with all the disposition they
could wish, to comply with Their reasonable Desires; but upon perusing it, He
is sorry to see their Thoughts so wholly fixed upon the Bill of Exclusion, as
to determine that all other Remedies for the suppressing of Popery will be
ineffectual: His Majesty is confirmed in His Opinion against that Bill by the
Judgment of the House of Lords, who rejected it. He therefore thinks there
remains nothing more for Him to say in answer to the Address of this House, but
to recommend to Them the Consideration of all other Means for the Preservation
of the Protestant Religion, in which They have no reason to doubt of His
Concurrence, whenever they shall be presented to Him in a Parliamentary Way;
and that They would Consider the Present State of the Kingdom, as well as the
Condition of Christendom, in such a manner, as may enable Him to preserve
Tangier, and secure His Alliances abroad, and the Peace and Settlement at home.

FINIS.
