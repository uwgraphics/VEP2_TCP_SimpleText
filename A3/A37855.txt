UPon the Humble Complaints of several Poor Cardmakers of London, who having

Realm: It is this day Ordered by this Committee, That the Officers of the
Custom House of the Port of London, and likewise of the Out-Ports within the
Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales, and all other Officers whom it does
concern respectively, do seize and put into safe Custody, all sorts of
Playing-Cards of Foreign making, which Are, or hereafter shall be brought
into this Kingdom or Dominion of Wales; And that they do thereupon proceed
against the Parties so offending, according to the Laws and Statutes in that
Case provided.

And it is further Ordered, That the Copy hereof be sent unto the Custom House
of the Port of London, and unto all other the Out-Ports within the Kingdom of
England and Dominion of Wales, that the Officers may take notice thereof
accordingly.
