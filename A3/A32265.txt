His Majesty's GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, At their
Prorogation.
My Lords, and Gentlemen,
I Need not tell you, how unwillingly I call you hither at this time, being
enough sensible what advantages My Enemies both abroad and at home will reap by
the least appearance of a difference betwixt Me and My Parliament; nay, being
assured, they expect more success from such a Breach (could they procure it)
then from their Arms.

This, I say, shall (whilst I live) be My chief endeavor to prevent, and for
that reason I think it necessary to make a short Recess, that all Good Men may
recollect themselves against the next Meeting, and consider, Whether the
present posture of Affairs will not rather require their applications to
matters of Religion, and Support against Our only Competitors at Sea, then to
things of less importance; and in the mean while, I will not be wanting to let
all My Subjects see, that no care can be greater then My Own, in the effectual
suppressing of Popery: And it shall be your faults, if in your several
Countries, the Laws be not effectually executed against the Growth of it.

I will not be idle neither in some other things which may add to your
Satisfaction, and then I shall expect a suitable Return from you.

FINIS.
