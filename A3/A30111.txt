BUMM-FODER OR, VVASTE-PAPER
Proper to wipe the Nation's RUMP with, or your Own.
FRee quarter in the North is grown so scarce,
That Lambert with all his men of Mars
Have submitted to kiss the Parliaments Arse,
Which no body can deny.
If this should prove true, (as we do suppose)
It Is such a wipe as the RUMP and all is Foes
Could never give to old Olivers nose:
Which, etc.
There Is a Proverb come to my mind not unfit,
When the head shall see the RUMP all be-shit,
Sure this must prove a most lucky hit:
Which etc.
There Is another Proverb which every Noddy
Will jeer the RUMP with, and cry Hoddy Doddy,
Here Is a Parliament all Arse and no Body.
Which etc.
It Is a likely matter the world will mend
When so much blood and treasure we spend,
And yet begin again at the wrong End:
Which etc.
We have been round and round about twirl'd,
And through much sad confusions hurled,
And now we are got into the arse of the world:
Which etc.
But it is not all this our courage will quail,
Or make the brave Seamen to the RUMP strike sail,
If we can have no head, we will have no Tail:
Which etc.
Then let a Free-Parliament be turned trump,
And nere think any longer the Nation to mump
With your pocky, perjui 'd, damnd, old Rump:
Which etc.
But what does Rebel Rump make here
When their proper place (as Will. Pryn does swear)
Is at the Devils arse in Derbyshire:
Which etc.
Then thither let us send them a tilt,
For if they stay longer, they will us beguilt
With a Government that is loose in the Hilt:
Which etc.
You Will find it set down in Harringtons Moddle,
Whose brains a Commonwealth do so coddle,
That t'as made a Rotation in his noddle:
Which etc.
It Is a pitiful pass you men of the Sword
Have brought yourselves to, that the Rumps your Lord,
And Arsie-Versie, must be the word,
Which, etc.
Our powder and shot you did freely spend,
That the Head you might from the Body rend,
And now you are at us with the But-end,
Which, etc.
Old Martin and Scot have still such an itch,
That they will with the Rump try to'ther twitch;
And Lenthal can grease a fat Sow in the britch:
Which, etc.
That's a thing that would please the Butchers and Cooks,
To see this stinking Rump quite off the hooks,
And Jack-Daw go to pot with the Rooks.
Which, etc.
This forward Sir John (who the Rump did never fail)
Against Charles Stuart, in a Speech did rail;
But men say it was without head or tail,
Which, etc.
Just such is the Government we live under,
Of a Parliament thrice cut in sunder;
And this has made us the worlds wonder,
Which, etc.
Old Noll when we talked of Magna Charta,
Did prophecy well we should all smart-a,
And now we have found his RUMPS Magni Fart-a,
Which, etc.
But I cannot think Monck (though a Soldier and sloven)
To be kin to the Fiend, whose feet are cloven,
Nor will creep in the Rumps Arse, to bake in their Oven,
Which, etc.
Then since he is coming, e'ne let him come
From the North to the South, with Sword and Drum,
To beat up the quarters of this lewd Bum;
Which, etc.
And now of this Rump I Will say no more,
Nor had I begun, but upon this score,
There was something behind, which was not before;
Which, etc.
FINIS, In English, The RUMP.
