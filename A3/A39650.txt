May it please your Lordships,
Upon Saturday last, I received a Declaration of Parliament, with a Commission
from his Excellency the Earl of Essex, to command in chief, over the Forces
of the North, and other adjacent Counties, which great honor and Trust, far
above any ambition or merit, by your Lordships conferred on me, I shall
exercise withal care, and fidelity, not doubting but that your Lordships will
enable me therein, with such other Supplies as the necessity of the Service
shall require, and that represented from hence.

The State of the affairs in these parts, since my last dispatch of the first
of this month, stand in this manner, the Earl of Newcastle is come to York,
and Joined his forces to the Earl of Cumberlands, making in all as I am
informed about 8000 men horse and foot, of which there is about 2000 Horse and
Dragonneers, strength far too potent to be resisted by the small power which I
have here, whereof I send a list enclosed; our strength was once estimated by
our selves far greater then now it appears, for upon the Earl of Newcastles
coming over the Tees, Sir Edward Loftus with all the Richmond shire men, and
Sir Henry Anderson with all the Cleveland men and the rest of the North riding,
which were estimated at 1000 men, did all return to their own Houses, save
about 130 men brought hither by Sir Matthew Boynton, some other Gentlemen, and
our Troop of Horse, raised by Sir Henry Forlis, and about 40. Horse more,
brought hither by Captain Anderson; And besides this defect, our numbers are
decreased by Sir Hugh Cholmley, to whom I have sent diverse Orders to match
Northward, to join with Captain Hotham, and the rest in resisting the Earl of
Newcastles entry, before he came into Yorkshire, and since his entry, to come
to me, and the rest of the Army at Todcaster, but he found such impediments as
he could do neither: And now I hear, he is gone to Scarborough, and taken
his Forces with him, which were about 700 Men, and Colonel Boynton, whose
Regiment consisted of 800 Foot, is likewise marched toward Hull, although I
sent him diverse Orders to march up hither to assist the forces at Todcaster,
giving me neither reason of his not coming to me, nor of his march toward
Hull, and I understand that Sir John Gell had raised 800 men in Darbishire,
sent unto him to march hither, to our Succors, but I have received an Answer
from him, that he is not able yet to stir from thence; from Sir Anthony Irby,
nor the Lincolnshire men, I hear nothing, though I have sent to them express
Messengers, so our whole strength here, (upon return of the formerly sent into
the North) consisting of 21 Companies of Foot, and 7 Troops of Horse, and one
Company of Dragoneeres, we did send of them two Companies of Foot to secure
Selby, and one Company to secure Cawood-Castle, and quartered the rest, part of
them at Weatherby, under Command of Captain Hotham, whom I have nominated to
be Lieutenant General of the Army, and the rest at Todcaster, under my own
command, and upon Tuesday receiving intelligence that the Earl of Newcastle
with his whole forces intended to fall upon our Quarter at Todcaster, I sent to
Captain Hotham, to bring up the forces at VVeatherby, which being done, and
the Earl of Newcastles Army come in sight, we drew our men into the uttermost
part of our Quarter, where we had raised some breast-works for our Musketeers,
and there the fight began about 11 of the clock; and so continued in sharp
dispute until about 4 of the clock in the evening; in which time there was at
least 40 Thousand Muskets shot discharged, on both sides, and great numbers of
cannon shot.

The Enemy had once won part of the Town and beaten our men, and placed some
of their Companies in two or three houses, which did much endanger us, but in
the end our men with great courage forced them out again, recovered and burnt
the houses, and killed many of the Enemies men that were there placed, and in
conclusion, forced the whole Army to retreat, leaving very many of their men
dead, and very great numbers wounded, the certain numbers, nor qualities of
the persons we could not take, but it is generally said by the Country people
that there were at least 100 found killed and burnt, and we took 17 prisoners in
the fight, and on our part we lost 6 men, and Captain William Lyster, a
valiant and gallant Gentleman who was shot with a Musket bullet in the head,
and we had about 20 more wounded, and lost not one Prisoner in the Battle,
though diverse of our men being negligent of their duty stayed behind us when we
quit the Quarter, and so were taken the next day there, by the Enemies, and
made Prisoners; in this fight our men behaved themselves with very great
resolution, far beyond expectation, in so much as I conceive we might have
maintained the place still if we had bin furnished with Powder and shot, but
having spent in a manner all our whole store of Bullet, Match, and Powder, I
advised with the Commanders, and by general consent it was though fit, to rise
with our Forces, and march to Cawood; and Selby, to secure those places, and
there receive supplies of Ammunition and men, which was accordingly done, and
now I am at Selby, with part of the Army, and the rest with Captain Hotham at
Cawood; And yesterday I sent my son Sir Thomas Fairfax with five Companies of
Foot, and two Troops of Horse to Leedes, intending he should continue there to
secure that place, and the other Clothing towns, against the Earl of
New-Castells forces, if it were possible; But the Enemies forces were laid so
strong in the way, as he could not pass, so he only beat up a Quarter of the
Enemies in a small Village, took five Prisoners, and retreated to Selby.

Thus my Lords I have briefly represented the condition of this Army at
present, which I must confess I fear will very suddenly grow worse, if not
utterly broken up, and that especially for want of money, I having not above a
weeks pay provided before hand, and no visible means left to raise
maintenance for them unless I should give the Soldiers free quarter upon the
Country, a cure in my conceit as dangerous as the disease, and peradventure
not possible to be effected, If the Enemy be still master of the field, and cut
off our men as they go abroad to levy Sustenance* which they may do, and yet
not able to beat up our Quarters. I have hitherto supported this Army by the
Loanes and Contributions for the most part of the parishes of Leedes Hallifax
and Bradford, and some other small Clothing-townes adjacent, being the only well
affected people of the Country, who I much fear may now suffer by this Popish
Army of the North merely for their good affection to the Religion and Public
Liberty* Out of the rest of the Country I was not able to draw any
considerable help, the Enemy having Garrisons in so many places, who threatened
to ruin any that should assist the Parliament and the cause with money or
rather helps. My Lords in sum the State of this Country is thus, The Enemy is
mighty, and master of the field, plentifully supplied from his Majesty and the
Popish and malignant party, with moneys and all necessaries, the well affected
party as now it is divided not considerable, the ayds from Lincolnshire
Darbyshire and other Counties very uncertain, the want of moneys here, such
as will force us to disband within 10 days, and if the Enemy become absolute
Master of Yorkshire, they will force contribution, and succors from the
Country, which will raise a very formidable Army and put (...) peril, if God
do not miraculously defend it, I beseech your Lordship seriously to consider
it, and send such speedy supplies of men, and money as may Enable me to go
foreward in the service, which I shall not fail to do with a constant
fidelity. Your Lordships have heretofore assignd two thousand Pounds, for our
succor; but the most part of it is still at London where it lies for want of
Exchange or convoy, and therefore what shall now be sent, must come either by
sufficient convoy of Forces by Land, or else by sea to Hull, and so hither to
me: the Scottish Officers are now come hither, yesterday, but now we are so
straightened, that we can have no men resort to us, to put under command, nor
have we money to pay them. The further relation of these Affairs, I shall
leave to Captain Hatcher, who follows these Letters purposely to give true
Relation to the House of these Affairs, and has bin an eye witness of most
of the passages, in this County* from the first raising of Arms; to whose
further expression, I shall leave it, with this addition only, That if the
Country or cause suffer, your Lordships will discern by this Relation, in
whom the default has bin, and impute it accordingly: For nothing has bin
omitted possible to be effected by

Your Lordships most faithful and humble Servant Fardinando Fairefax.
From Selby, 10. Dec. 1642.
FINIS.
