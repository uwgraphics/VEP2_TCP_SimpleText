St Andrews 11. December. 1645. A Declaration from the Commission of the General
Assembly.
IT has been our constant custom and continual care, from the sense of the
trust committed unto us, to give warning unto this Kirk and Kingdom of their
condition and duty; and it cannot be but very seasonable and necessary at this
time, to declare and make known our judgment of the carriage of the people of
the Land, in the day of darkness and hour of temptation, that they who have
stood may find matter of encouragement and praise, and such as have fallen may
recover themselves and repent.

We were void of understanding if we should not observe, and more then ungrate
if we should not acknowledge the loving kindness of the Lord toward us, in
the midst of our confusions and fears: Temptations were many and fierce,
because of the power and pride of an insolent enemy, whose blasphemies and
cruelty is matter of abomination unto this, and shall be a wonder unto the
following generation, yet was there a remnant who reserved their integrity,
entertaining all thoughts of backsliding and complying with the adversary with
indignation and detest, patiently suffering the spoiling of their goods, the
loss of their friends, and expense of their blood, standing to the Cause of
God in the midst of difficulties and straits, neither fearing the threats nor
regarding the promises of such as oppose the famine: These, as they be for a
name of joy and praise unto the most high, the excellency of whose power is
perfited in weakness; so for a witness unto the Truth and to the work of
Reformation, and for a shame and reproach unto the haters of Zion, whose
subtilty and violence is more then conquered by the faith and patience of the
Saints. We cannot but think that unto such the testimony of integrity from
within must needs be more comfortable, then the remembrance of any sufferings
or losses from without can be grievous; and are persuaded, that as their name
is precious amongst men, so shall their reward be great in heaven.

Yet is it matter of much sorrow and astonishment unto us, that in the land of
uprightness so many should have done foolishly, and notwithstanding of all
that work of power and mercy which their eyes have seen, and of their own vows
and promises fallen from their excellency, and turned aside unto corrupt and
crooked ways with the workers of iniquity. The bond of the Covenant is such,
as every religious heart cannot but remember the violation thereof with horror
and trembling; yet has the Oath of God been forgotten and despised by many. It
were but the renewing of our grief, and tedious unto the hearers, to reckon up
all those things wherein men miscarried in the day of trial; neither can we
attain the knowledge of all the hidden things of dishonesty, which hate the
light, and love to vail themselves under a shadow of secrecy and darkness: We
desire every man to turn his eyes upon himself, and to read in his own
conscience whether his carriage has been in all things answerable unto that
which he swore unto the Lord. It beseems our compassion, and is worthy of our
care, to lay open the causes and evil of this defection, that we may with
meekness instruct those that have fallen or opposed themselves, if God
peradventure will give them repentance unto the acknowledging of the truth.

It is the admirable way of the working of the wisdom of God, to overruled all
the purposes and actions of the sons of men unto his own ends: He whose ways
toward us have all been mercy and truth, meant a discovery of those whose
indifferency or treachery would ere long have procured a sure and sensible
ruin unto us; and now has he brought his purpose to pass. This is a mercy
which being rightly managed may countervail all our sufferings and pains, and
prove very wholesome unto the Land and advantageous unto the Cause of God.

It is not any strength of reason on the side of our adversaries that could
have shaken so many; their pretexts of the Kings service, our Rebellion, and
such like, as they are poor and void of truth in themselves, so do they
easily evanish before every discerning and rational man. The service of Kings
is not to cut down thousands of their faithful and loyal subjects, whose
multitude is their glory and strength; but to do those things which the Laws of
the Kingdom prescribe, and that are consonant unto the will of God, and unto
the wealth of the people, whose safety is the supreme Law and main study of
every King ruling in righteousness and judgment. Our souls are not privy
unto, and our actions plead us innocent from the guilt of Treason and
Rebellion; our witness is in heaven, and our record is on high, that it was
never our purpose or intention to subvert lawful Soveraigntie, nor to encroach
upon any of the due rights and privileges of the same; and we trust that
whiles we live nothing shall escape us to the contrary.

We are able to justify our union with England, as ane undeniable testimony
of our duty unto our brethren in the time of their straits by the Popish and
Prelaticall party, as a necessary mean of our own defense, and of the
preservation of Religion in its purity and power in this, and of its
Reformation in the neighbor Lands, and surest bulwark of a stable and
continuing peace betwixt the Kingdoms. The League and Covenant with England, as
it was studied and set on foot in the days of our fathers at Barwick in the
year 1586; so was it from the beginning of this glorious work of Reformation
endeavored by our selves, as stands upon record in the Articles of the large
Treaty, unto which some of those who have now fallen to oppose it, were then
neither strangers nor adversaries. Both Covenants, in regard of the principals
whence they issue, the heads which they contain, and the ends which they
pursue, are one and the same: And that the extent of the last unto our dear
brethren in England should procure enmity to the intentions and substance of
the first, seems to us to be a riddle, which none can resolve but perfidious
Rebels who have made shipwreck of a good conscience.

Who can but be amazed to hear the treacherous designs and bloody practices of
perjured men, palliat under a pretense of the prosecution of the ends of our
national Covenant: We know that James Grahame then Earl of Montrose, now an
excommunicate and forefaulted Traitor, did with tears in his eyes, and both
his hands lifted up to heaven, swear unto the Lord in the public assembly of
his people to build those things which he now destroys, and to destroy those
things which he now builds; though the Kings Majesty, of whose authority he
now pretends to be so zealous, had not then given his royal consent and
approbation unto our affairs: But we do as well know that he proved unstable,
and light as water: His ambition, as it made him impatient of his own
condition, and of the estimation of those of better deserving then himself, so
to hearken to the promises of the Court, and to study a faction within, and to
entertain secret correspondence and intelligence with the adverse party
without the Kingdom. And though those his base and treacherous ways were
diverse times discovered, yet did he still drive his own crooked designs,
until at length he was shut up in prison, where if he had not met with more
mercy then justice, the due reward of his iniquity had anticipate all that
mischief which he now acts.

Not long after his enlargement (contrary to his own promise and Act of
Parliament thereanent) he betook himself to Court, where to the utmost of his
wit and power he did foment and maintain that unnatural and bloody War, set on
foot by the malignant party in England, against his Majesty's loyal subjects
there, contrary to the Articles of the large Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms; and
labored to beget and increase jealousies in the Kings mind concerning the
intention of his subjects in this land: Neither did he satisfy himself with
private whisperings, but was so impudent as to present to his Majesty and the
pretended Parliament at Oxford, a railing Libell, wherein he accuses our
Parliaments and Committees (which have been in all things most tender of the
Kings just greatness and authority) as treacherous in their proceedings, and
the solemn League and Covenant (which has been a mean of many blessings and
much consolation unto the Lords people) as damnable, Offering himself and the
utmost of his endeavors against the same; And never did he cease until he
obtained a Commission for invading his native Country, and came within the
confines thereof in an hostile way; whence he was shamefully repulsed and
forced to flee back into England, where he found cold entertainment of his own
party, because his success had not answered his undertakings.

Whilst himself was now despised, and his hopes forlorn in both Nations, this
Kingdom was invaded in the North by a base and barbarous Crew of Irish Rebels,
drunk with the blood of our Brethren in Ireland, and sworn enemies, not only
to our Covenant, but to our Profession it self: yet so strongly did the spirit
of Satan (to whom he was now delivered) work in that wretched Man, that he did
rather choose to associat himself unto those, than to fail in the attaining of
his mischievous ends. With those, and some of our unnatural Countrymen, void
of Religion and humanity, has he eaten the flesh, and drunk the blood of that
Land that gave him life, spoiled that People with whom he was in Covenant, and
preyed upon that Church in which he was baptized: neglect of the worship of
God, countenancing of Idolaters, complying with Papists, burning of Houses and
Corn, imprisoning and killing of Ministers, ravishing of Women, murdering of
old and young, and contemning the highest censures of the Kirk, are but things
of small consequence and care with him: This is the Man who would make the
world believe, that he stands for the National Covenant: Every one whose eyes
are not blinded by the god of this world, cannot but entertain this his
Profession, so contrary to sense and reason, with derision and contempt.

Success, as it argues not the equity of our adversaries cause, so neither
the iniquity of ours: No man knows either love or hatred by that which is
before him: Success is not the touchstone of Truth, but Truth of Success:
Israel may fall before the Philistims; yea, the Ark may be taken by the
Philistims: And what wonder though we have fallen, and been smitten by the
basest of men? they were the rod of the Lords anger, and the staff in their
hand was his indignation; because of our contempt of the Gospel, ingratitude,
confidence in the arm of flesh, murmurings and repinings, delaying of Justice,
walking unanswerable to the Covenant, and the like, were such instruments armed
against us, to correct us, and harden themselves unto the day of their just
destruction.

For these transgressions also of Jacob, and for these sins of the house of
Israel, did the Lord shut out our prayers, and cover himself with a cloud of
indignation, that our Petitions could not pass through; and not for meddling
with the Kings Castles and Rents: His Castles have always been employed for
the safety of the Kingdom; his Rents have not been meddled with since the
Pacification, neither yet before it, but for a public use, which was afterward
approven by the King himself. And they who would now fasten this upon us, as a
cursed thing, may remember that themselves were accessorie thereunto. Neither
yet were our Prayers without a return of mercy in the day of our deepest
distress: The Work of Reformation (which is of greater esteem with us than our
own things) did prosper in the hand of his servants; and we trust, that even
these Prayers which were derided by the wicked, shall in due time return in
showers of vengeance upon the heads of our enemies, whereof we have already
comfortable experience.

It is our hearts desire and hope, that all this course of providence, thus
abused by men void of understanding, may be improven by our selves as a mean of
serious and sound humiliation, that we may search and try our ways, and turn
again unto the Lord, who will do good unto us, because of the railing of our
adversaries; notwithstanding of all calumnies and reproaches, the
righteousness of our cause shall be counted of us our glory, and in regard of
it, we will not remove our integrity from us: our righteousness we will still
hold fast, and not let it go, and our heart shall not reproach us so long as we
live; yea, though our adversaries would write a book against us, surely we
would take it on our shoulder, and bind it as a crown unto us.

The true and real causes of our backsliding are to be sought amongst our
selves. If all the Watchmen of the house of Israel had bin faithful and zealous
in discharge of their trust, then had the Lords people better known the
excellency of the Gospel, and stuck closer to the profession of the same;
because of the negligence and perverseness of some of those, have many halted for
want of instruction and lack of knowledge; but from the corruptions which men
have harbored in their own breasts, has mainly issued all the degrees of
their declination.

There be amongst us many rotten and hollow hearts, who though they joined with
us through subtlety or fear, did still abide in the gall of bitterness, and
bond of iniquity, and wished nothing more, than the subversion of our cause:
What wonder though such took advantage of a prevailing party, to disclose their
envy, wherewith they were now grown big, almost unto bursting: And there is a
generation whose ignorance and sloth has detained them, that they have not
sufficiently examined, nor rightly considered Zions controversy with those
that plead against her, because of her love to the Truth: They conceive the
debate to be about things civil; at least, not to go so high as the hazard of
any thing important in Religion. And such is the negligence of those, that they
despise the means of instruction, largely offered and holden forth unto them
in many Warnings and Declarations, which they will not be at the pains to
peruse: Love to the things of the world, has stumbled men of earthly minds,
who had rather choose to endanger their souls, and make shipwreck of a good
conscience, than to suffer the spoiling of their Goods, and ruin of their
Estates: And Atheism prevails in many, which as it is not acquainted with the
excellency of JESUS CHRIST, nor with the preciousnesse and sweetness of his
ways, so has it no regard to his Commandments to obey them, nor respect to
his Gospel, to suffer any thing for it. And seeing formalitie and profanitie
abounds, is it not just with GOD to send them strong delusion to believe lies,
who do not receive the Truth in love. And what if some being puffed up in mind,
have trusted to the power of their own strength, and neglected to employ that
mighty One, upon whom our help is laid.

Though we cannot but think, that all such as are not given up to delusion and
hardness of heart, have already begun to consider the evil of their ways,
and to remember their inconstancy with detestation and sorrow; yet, for
convincing of the obstinate, reclaiming of the more flexible, and increasing of
the repentance of those who desire to loathe themselves, because of their
backsliding, we cannot but discover the guiltiness that many involved
themselves into, in the hour of temptation that came upon the Land. As there
be degrees of duties in the Covenant, so degrees of offenses against the same:
We would have none so gross to plead innocence, because they have not broke
forth in open opposition: Indifferency and neutralitie is no less against our
Oath, then professed enimitie: And what also if it be as odious in the sight of
GOD, who spues the lukewarm out of his mouth? How then shall we judge of
backsliding and express malignancie? Surely disobedience unto public order,
or prevarication in the same, commending of adversaries their purpose, power,
or carriage, traducing the Instruments and Work of Reformation, be but the
bitter fruits of an evil heart, disaffected to the truth, and cleaving to the
love of the paths of those, who study the obstruction and dis-appointment of
all those ends designed in the Covenant: Silence when we had a calling to
speak: Setting on of Bonfires: Preparing entertainment for the Rebels, and
receiving them into our Houses, are but at the best sinful temporizing in an
evil time, a betraying of our zeal for the Lord, a strengthening of the
ungodly in their wicked courses, and yielding unto them a ground of hope for
further complying with them, and an high contempt of the dreadful sentence of
Excommunication, if any of those with whom fellowship was kept, were under the
same: Intelligence and correspondence with the Enemy, furnishing them with
Men, Money, Horses, Ammunition, or Clothes, seducing of the people, receiving
Commissions, or executing the same, and joining in actual service. Those
things if done out of affection, and not through fear, as some of them hardly
can be, are sure tokens of a heart desperately perverse, and wholly malignant,
which esteems it but a light thing to hazard upon express perjury, and
howsoever done, draw upon the doers a manifest breach of Covenant, and fearful
guilt of helping those whom the Lord hates.

What though it be lawful in some cases to capitulate, yea with Turks or
Pagans; shall it therefore be lawful to do that which may argue subjection and
imply submission unto a perfidious Rebel, and the sworn enemy of the League
and Covenant with England, going about to drive the people of the Land from
their duty for the Covenant, to a compliance with him against it. In this
case, all and every one are called unto the asserting of the confession of
their Faith, and of their own innocence and righteousness in joining with
England; Both which they do betray and condemn, and take with that guiltiness
of Treason and Rebellion, which the Adversaries would fasten upon them, when
they capitulate to do any thing inconsistent with open and professed enimitie, or
that tends unto the disserting of those duties to which the Covenant does
oblige them: Such Capitulations must needs be very sinful, and contrary to the
Covenant. Neither can we judge any better of Protections from such an Enemy
because they do imply the authority of one who is forfeit by the State, and
excommunicat by the Kirk; and do either expressly or tacitly engage the
Receivers, if not to join, yet not to resist; they lay a stumbling block
before all the Inhabitants of the Land, to make them forbear action, or decline
suffering, by following such a course: If all had done so, it may soon be
foreseen what should have been the end; Though happily they who were the doers,
were not so apprehensive as to reach the depth of the evil, yet the end of the
work in it self, and in the intention of enemies, was to make them Masters of
all the lives and estates within the Land.

Capitulations and Protections, howsoever accounted of by those who walk after
the wisdom of the flesh, are destructive to our Covenant, almost in all the
Heads and Articles thereof: They tend unto the corrupting of Religion in this
Land, and obstructing the Work of Reformation in England, unto the
countenancing and strengthening of the Popish and Prelaticall party, unto the
subversion of the due Rights and Privileges of the Parliaments, and
diminishing of his Majesty's just greatness and authority, unto the
withdrawing of Incendiaries and Malignants from condign punishment, unto the
overthrow of the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, unto the deserting of our
Brethren, following of divisive motions, and denying to hazard or suffer the
loss either of lives or estates in the defense of the Cause, and them that
adhere thereunto. We see not any strength of reason in that seeming necessity,
unto which many pretend themselves to have been redacted: If men could not have
retired from the fury and violence of the Enemy, or had not some probable way
of resistance and defense against the same, they should have taken it as an
evidence of the will of GOD, calling them to suffer and give a testimony unto
his Truth. Our Covenant does no less oblige us to suffering, than to doing;
and it is the ignorance or ineffectuall consideration of our duty that makes
us thus to wipe our mouths, as if we had done nothing worthy of rebuke:
Neither yet does it excuse, that some were not active to obtani Protections,
the receiving of them was to prostitute the chastity of that affection which
we owe unto the Cause of GOD, and could be no better than a bribe that blinds
the eyes of the wise, and hinders from doing judgment unto the afflicted.

The deep apprehension of their souls danger, moves us seriously, and in the
bowels of JESUS CHRIST, to entreat all Temporizers and Back-sliders to remember
whence they are fallen, and to repent: Let it not be a light thing unto such,
that they have despised the Oath of GOD, under-valued the precious Truth of the
Gospel and drawn upon themselves the guilt of their Brethrens blood, by
forsaking them in their just defense. If the due sense of their sin shall bring
them to lament after the Lord, they may hope to find him gracious and
merciful, to forgive their iniquity, and heal their backslidings: But if they
shall harden themselves, and continue in their provocation, they have cause of
fear that the Lord of Hosts shall avenge the quarrel of his Covenant upon them
who have sworn falsely by his Name.

Yet is it not that those alone have cause to mourn; All the Land have done
foolishly, and provoked the holy One of Israel unto wrath: The Lord has been
glorious in the midst of us, but who has regarded his work, or considered the
operation of his hands? Though he has been liberal in the offer of his love,
yet few have believed the Gospel, and studied to walk worthy of the name: JESUS
CHRIST has neither been known nor honored; who has valued him in the
excellency of his Person, or employed him in the virtue of his Offices? Holy
duties have been neglected, and piety and godliness reproached: Is there not
cause to lament for the Atheism, ignorance of GOD, blaspheming of his Name,
swearing by them that are no gods, intemperancie, uncleanness, deceit, and
oppression that prevails amongst many? And should not our eyes run down with
tears, because of jealousies, self-seeking, and obstructing of Justice amongst
our Judges, because of rioting and excess, spoiling and oppressing amongst our
Soldiers, because of negligence and profanitie amongst Ministers, because of
murmurings and grudgings, deep securitiy, carnal confidence, neutralitie, and
lukewarmnesse almost amongst all. The Covenant which has been attended by a
stately work of more than ordinary providence, and sealed with many rich and
precious blessings from Heaven, is by many under-valued and set at naught; nay,
by some blasphemed, as an accursed and unholy thing. Because of those things,
thousands have fallen by the Sword, and ten thousands by the Pestilence, our
highways are desolate, and our Cities left without inhabitants, the like has
not been heard in our days, nor in the days of our Fathers: And yet the wrath
of the Lord is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. O that men
were wise to hear the voice of the rod, and who has appointed it! Shall we
continue to tempt the most High, and strive with our Maker until he make an end
of us? Let us confess our iniquity, and be humbled for our sin, let us sow to
our selves in righteousness, and reap in mercy, let us break up our fallow
ground, for it is time to seek the Lord, until he come and rain righteousness
upon us.

We cannot but from the sense of those judgments that lies heavy upon the
Land, and from that wrath that still threatens us, warn every man to repent
and set on to duty. Let Rulers and Judges do judgment, and execute Justice
without respect of persons: Let Officers and Soldiers live soberly, do
violence to no man, and more mind the Cause of GOD, than their own advantage:
Let Pastors feed the flock of CHRIST in love, be zealous in advancing the Work
of Reformation, and purging of the House of GOD: And let every one in his
station, mind those things whereunto the Lord has called him. Though we be
afflicted and sore broken, yet if we return unto the Lord, he will have mercy
on us, and heal us; Has he not already begun to revive us, and to raise us up?

It is a mercy worthy to be had in everlasting remembrance, that in the day of
the power and pride of our cruel and insolent Enemies, the Lord should have
showed himself glorious and mighty, to give victory and salvation to his
people, when our hopes were near gone: We were in a low condition, not only at
the weakest, but even at the worst, under the guilt of many provocations,
repining against the Lord, and hasting to the paths of the Destroyer: yet the
Preserver of men had regard unto us, to keep us from destruction, and to ease
and avenge us of many of our adversaries, whose carcasses he made as dung unto
the earth in the day of his fury and indignation. If after so great a mercy,
any should be found amongst us to turn away from the Lord, and again to submit
unto, or comply with the Enemies of his Truth, they could not but sin against
their own souls, and provoke the eyes of his glory until there were no remedy.
We beseech all the Lords People throughout the Land, nay we Charge them before
GOD and the Lord JESUS CHRIST, who shall judge the quick and the dead, to hold
fast the Truth in love, to have regard to the glory of the Son of GOD, the
excellency of the Gospel, the sacred and inviolable Bond of the Covenant, the
beauty of the Work of Reformation, and the worth of a good Conscience, above
all earthly losses and advantages; and from the due sense and apprehension of
those things, to arm themselves with strong resolutions against all the
degrees of backsliding or complying with the Enemy; That they be no more as
Reeds shaken with the wind; but that they may give a proof of their Faith,
Patience and Courage, in the midst of all the difficulties and straits which
they shall meet with. Every one who knows the Lord, will cleave to their duty,
and wait for his salvation: He is faithful, and will not suffer us to be
tempted above that we are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to
escape, that we may be able to bear it. The rod of the wicked shall not rest
too long upon the lot of the righteous. But when the Lord has performed his
whole work upon mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, he will punish the fruit of the
stout heart of the proud Enemy, and bring down the glory of his high looks:
Then shall all the haters of Zion be astonished and confounded, but the Lords
People shall be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
