To the READER.
Courteous Reader,
THy grateful reception of our first Collection has induced us to a second
essay of the same nature; which, as we are confident, it is not inferior to
the former in worth, so we assure our selves, upon thy already experimented
Candor, that it shall at least equal it in its fortunate acceptance. We serve
up these Delicates by frugall Messes, as aiming at thy Satisfaction, not
Saciety. But our design being more upon thy judgment, than patience, more to
delight thee, than to detain thee in the portall of a tedious, and seldome-read
Epistle; we draw this displeasing Curtain, that intercepts thy (by this time)
gravid, and almost teeming fancy, and subscribe,

Choice DROLLERY: SONGS AND SONNETS.
The broken Heart.
1.
Dear Love let me this evening dye,
Oh smile not to prevent it,
But use this opportunity,
Or we shall both repent it:
Frown quickly then, and break my heart,
That so my way of dying
May, though my life were full of smart,
Be worth the worlds envying.
2.
Some striving knowledge to refine,
Consume themselves with thinking,
And some who friendship seal in wine
Are kindly killed with drinking:
And some are rackt on the' Indian coast,
Thither by gain invited,
Some are in smoke of battles lost,
Whom Drums not Lutes delighted.
3.
Alas how poorly these depart,
Their graves ffill unattended,
Who dies not of a broken heart,
Is not in death commended.
His memory is ever sweet,
All praise and pity moving,
Who kindly at his Mistress feet
Does dye with over-loving.
4.
And now thou frown'st, and now I dye,
My corpse by Lovers followed,
Which straight shall by dead lovers lie,
For that ground's only hollowed:
If Priest take it ill I have a grave,
My death not well approving,
The Poets my estate shall have
To teach them the art of loving.
5.
And now let Lovers ring their bells,
For thy poor youth departed;
Which every Lover else excels,
That is not broken hearted.
My grave with flowers let virgins strew,
For if thy tears fall near them,
They Will so excel in scent and show,
Thy self wilt shortly wear them.
6.
Such Flowers how much will Flora prise,
That Is on a Lover growing,
And watered with his Mistress eyes,
With pity overflowing?
A grave so decked, well, though thou art
Yet fearful to come nigh me,
Provoke thee straight to break thy heart,
And lie down boldly by me.
7.
Then every where shall all bells ring,
Whilst all to blackness turning,
All torches burn, and all quires sing,
As Nature's self were mourning.
Yet we hereafter shall be found
By Destiny's right placing,
Making like Flowers, Love under ground,
Whose Roots are still embracing.
Of a Woman that died for love of a Man.
NOr Love nor Fate dare I accuse,
Because my Love did me refuse:
But oh! mine own unworthiness,
That durst presume so mickle bliss;
Too mickle'twere for me to love
A thing so like the God above,
An Angels face, a Saint-like voice,
Were too divine for humane choice.
Oh had I wisely given my heart,
For to have loved him, but in part,
Save only to have loved his face
For any one peculiar grace,
A foot, or leg, or lip, or eye,
I might have lived, where now I dye.
But I that strived all these to choose,
Am now condemned all to lose.
You rural Gods that guard the plains,
And chast'neth unjust disdains;
Oh do not censure him him for this,
It was my error, and not his.
This only boon of thee I crave,
To fix these lines upon my grave,
With lcarus I soar too high,
For which (alas) I fall and dye.
On the TIME-POETS.
ONe night the great Apollo pleased with Ben,
Made the odd number of the Muses ten;
The fluent Fletcher, Beaumont rich in sense,
In Complement and Courtships quintessence;
Ingenious Shakespeare, Massinger that knows
The strength of Plot to write in verse and prose:
Whose easy Pegassus will amble ore
Some threescore miles of Fancy in an hour;
Cloud-grapling Chapman, whose Aerial mind
Soars at Philosphy, and strikes it blind;
Danbourn I had forgot, and let it be,
He died Amphibion by the Ministry;
Silvester, Bartas, whose translatique part
Twinn'd, or was elder to our Laureat:
Divine composing Quarles, whose lines aspire
The April of all Poesy in May,
Who makes our English speak Pharsalia;
Sands metamorphos'd so into another
We know not Sands and Ovid from each other;
He that so well on Scotus played the Man,
The famous Diggs, or Leonard Claudian;
The pithy Daniel, whose salt lines afford
A weighty sentence in each little word;
Heroic Draiton, Withers, smart in Rhyme,
The very Poet-Beadles of the Time:
Panns pastoral Brown, whose infant Muse did squeak
At eighteen years, better than others speak:
Shirley the morning-child, the Muses bred,
And sent him born with bays upon his head:
Deep in a dump John Ford alone was got
With folded arms and melancholy hat;
The squibbing Middleton, and Haywood sage,
Th'Apologetick Atlas of the Stage;
Well of the Golden age he could entreat,
But little of the Metal he could get;
Threescore sweet Babes he fashioned from the lump,
For he was Christ'ned in Parnassus pump;
The Muses Gossip to Aurora's bed,
And ever since that time his face was red.
Thus through the horror of infernal deeps,
With equal pace each of them softly creeps,
And being dark they had Alectors torch,
And that made Churchyard follow from his Porch,
Poor, ragged, torn, and tackt, alack, alack,
You Would think his clothes were pinned upon his back.
The whole frame hung with pins, to mend which clothes,
In mirth they sent him to old Father Prose;
Of these sad Poets this way ran the stream,
And Decker followed after in a dream;
Rounce, Robble, Hobble, he that writ so high big
Basse for a Ballad, John Shank for a Jig:
Sent by Ben Johnson, as some Authors say,
Broom went before and kindly swept the way:
Old Chaucer welcomes them unto the Green,
And Spencer brings them to the fairy Queen;
The finger they present, and she in grace
Transformed it to a May-pole'bout which trace
Her skipping servants, that do nightly sing,
And dance about the same a Fayrie Ring.
The Vow-breaker.
WHen first the Magic of thine eye
Usurpt upon my liberty,
Triumphing in my hearts spoil, thou
Did lock up thine in such a vow:
When I prove false, may the bright day
Be governed by the Moons pale ray,
(As I too well remember) this
Thou said, and seald'st it with a kiss.
Oh heavens! and could so soon that tie
Relent in sad apostasy?
Could all thy Oaths and mortgaged trust,
Banish like Letters formed in dust,
Which the next wind scatters? take heed,
Take heed Revolter; know this deed
Has wronged the world, which will fare worse
By thy example, than thy curse.
Hide that false brow in mists; thy shame
Never see light more, but the dim flame
Of Funerall-lamps; thus sit and moan,
And learn to keep thy guilt at home;
Give it no vent, for if again
Thy love or vows betray more men,
At length I fear thy perjured breath
Will blow out day, and waken death.
The Sympathy.
IF at this time I am derided,
And you please to laugh at me,
Know I am not unprovided
Every way to answer thee,
Love, or hate, what ere it be.
Never Twinns so nearly met
As thou and I in our affection,
When thou weepst my eyes are wet,
That thou like is my election,
I am in the same subjection.
In one center we are both,
Both our lives the same way tending,
Do thou refuse, and I shall loath,
As thy eyes, so mine are bending,
Either storm or calm portending.
I am careless if despised,
For I can contemn again;
How can I be then surprised,
Or with sorrow, or with pain,
When I can both love and disdain?
The Red head and the White.
1.
COme my White head, let our Muses
Vent no spleen against abuses,
Nor scoff at monstrous signs in the nose,
Signs in the Teeth, or in the Toes,
Nor what now delights us most,
The sign of signs upon the post.
For other matter we are sped,
And our sign shall be in the head.
2.
Oh! Will^ Rufus, who would pass,
Unless he were a captious Ass;
The Head of all the parts is best,
And has more senses then the rest.
This subject then in our defense
Will clear our Poem of nonsense.
Besides, you know, what ere we read,
We use to bring it to a head.
1.
Why there is no other part we can
Style Monarch over this Isle of man:
It Is that that wears Nature's crown,
It Is this does smile, it is this does frown,
O what a prize and triumph 'twere,
To make this King our Subject here:
Believ'e, it is true what we have sed,
In this we hit the nail of the head.
2.
Your nails upon my head Sir, Why?
How do you thus to villifie
The King of Parts, amongst all the rest,
Or if no king, methinks at least,
To mine you should give no offense,
That wears the badge of Innocence;
Those blows would far more justly light
On thy red skull, for mine is white.
1.
Come on in faith, that was well sed,
A pretty boy, hold up thy head,
Or hang it down, and blush apace,
And make it like mines native grace.
There Is never a Bung-hole in the town
But in the working puts thine down,
A byle that is drawing to a head
Looks white like thine, but mine is red.
2.
Poor fool, 'twas shame did first invent
The color of thy Ornament,
And therefore thou art much too blame
To boast of that which is thy shame;
The Roman Prince that Poppeys topt,
Did show such Red heads should be cropped:
And still the Turks for poison smite
Such Ruddy skulls, but mine is white.
1.
The Indians paint their Devils so,
And it is a hated mark we know,
For never any aim aright
That do not strive to hit the white:
The Eagle threw her shellfish down,
To crack in pieces such a crown:
Alas, a stinking onions head
Is white like thine, but mine is red.
2.
Red like to a blood-shot eye,
Provoking all that see it to cry:
For shame nere vaunt thy colors thus
Since it is an eyesore unto us;
Those locks I Would swear, did I not know it,
Were threads of some red petticoat;
No Bedlams oaker'd arms afright
So much as thine, but mine is white.
1.
Now if thon'lt blaze thy arms I Will shew't,
My head does love no petticoat,
My face on one side is as fair
As on the other is my hair,
So that I bear by Heralds rules,
Party per pale Argent and Gules.
Then laugh not 'cause my head is red,
I Will swear that mine is a noble head.
1.
The Scutcheon of my field does bear
One only field, and that is rare,
For then methinks that thine should yield,
Since mine long since has won the field;
Besides, all the notes that be,
White is the note of Chastity,
So that without all fear or dread,
I Will swear that mine is a maidenhead.
1.
There Is no Camelion red like me,
Nor white, perhaps, thou wilt say, like thee;
Why then that mine is far above
Thy hair, by statute I can prove;
What ever there does seem divine
Is added to a Rubric line,
Which whosoever has but read,
Will grant that mine is a lawful head.
2.
Yet add what thou may, which by years,
Crosses, troubles, cares and fears,;
For that kind nature gave to me
In youth a white head, as you see,
At which, though age it self repine,
It never shall change a hair of mine;
And all shall say when I am am dead,
I only had a constant head.
1.
Yes faith, in that I Will condescend,
That our dissension here may end,
Though heads be always by the ears,
Yet ours shall be more noble peers:
For I avouch since I began,
Under a color all was done.
Then let us mix the White and Red,
And both shall make a beauteous head.
1.
We mind our heads man all this time
And beat them both about this rhyme;
And I confess what gave offense
Was but a hairs difference.
And that went too as I dare swear
In both of us against the hair;
Then jointly now for what is said
Lets crave a pardon from our head.
SONNET.
SHall I think because some clouds
The beauty of my Mistress shrouds,
To look after another Star?
Those to Cynthia servants are;
May the stars when I do sue,
In their anger shoot me through;
Shall I shrink at storms of rain,
Or be driven back again,
Or ignoble like a worm,
Be a slave unto a storm?
Pity he should ever taste
The Spring that fears Winters blast;
Fortune and Malice then combine,
Spite of either I am thine;
And to be sure keep thou my heart,
And let them wound my worser part,
Which could they kill, yet should I be
Alive again, when pleases thee.
On the Flower-de-luce in Oxford.
A Stranger coming to the town,
Went to the Flower-de-luce,
A place that seemed in outward show
For honest men to use;
And finding all things common there,
That tended to delight,
By chance upon the French disease
It was his hap to light.
And lest that other men should fare
As he had done before,
As he went forth he wrote this down
Upon the utmost door.
All you that hither chance to come,
Mark well ere you be in,
The Frenchmens arms are signs without
Of Frenchmens harms within.
ALDOBRANDINO, a fat Cardinal.
NEver was humane soul so overgrown,
With an unreasonable Cargazon
Of flesh, as Aldobrandine, whom to pack,
No girdle served less than the zodiac:
So thick a Giant, that he now was come
To be accounted an eighth hill in Rome,
And as the learned Tostatus kept his age,
Writing for every day he lived a page;
So he no less voluminous then that
Added each day a leaf, but 'twas of fat.
The choicest beauty that had been devised
By Nature, was by her parents sacrificed
Up to this Monster, upon whom to try,
If as increase, he could, too, multiply.
Oh how I tremble lest the tender maid
Should dye like a young infant over-laid!
For when this Chaos would pretend to move
And arch his back for the strong act of Love,
He falls as soon orethrown with his own weight,
And with his ruins does the Princess fright.
She (lovely Martyr) there lies stewed and pressed,
Like flesh under the tarr'd saddle dressed,
And seems to those that look on them in bed,
Larded with him, rather then married.
Often did he cry, but still in vain to force
His fatness powerfuller then a divorce:
No herbs, no midwives profit here, nor can
Of his great belly free the teeming man.
What though he drink the vinegars most fine,
They do not wast his fleshy Apennine;
His paunch like some huge Istmos runs between
The amarous Seas, and lets them not be seen;
Yet a new Dedalus invented how
This Bull with his Pasiphae might plow.
Have you those artificial torments known,
With which long sunken Galeos are thrown
Again on Sea, or the dead Galia
Was raised that once behind St. Peter's lay:
By the same rules he this same engine made,
With silken cords in nimble pullies laid;
And when his Genius prompteth his slow part
To works of Nature, which he helps with Art:
First he intangles in those woven bands,
His grovelling weight, and ready to commands,
The sworn Prinadas of his bed, the Aids
Of Loves Camp, necessary Chambermaids;
Each runs to her known tackling, hasts to hoyse,
And in just distance of the urging voice,
Exhorts the labor till he smiling rise
To the beds roof, and wonders how he flies.
Thence as the eager Falcon having spied
Fowl at the brook, or by the Rivers side,
Hangs in the middle Region of the air,
So hovers he, and plains above his fair*
Blessed Icarus first melted at those beams,
That he might after fall into those streams,
And there allaying his delicious flame,
In that sweet Ocean propogate his name.
Unable longer to delay, he calls
To be let down, and in short measure falls
Toward his Mistress, that without her smock
Lies naked as Andromeda at the Rock,
And through the Skies see her winged Perseus strike
Though for his bulk, more that sea monster like.
Mean time the Nurse, who as the most discreet,
Stood governing the motions at the feet,
And balanced his descent, lest that amiss
He fell too fast, or that way more than this;
Steeres the Prow of the pensile Galleasse,
Right on Loves Harbor the Nymph lets him pass
Over the Chains, and 'tween the double Fort
Of her incastled knees, which guard the Port,
The Burs as she had learnt still diligent,
Now girt him backwards, now him forwards bent;
Like those that levelled in tough Cordage, teach
The murall Ram, and guide it to the Breach.
Jack of Lent's Ballat.
1.
LIst you Nobles, and attend,
For here is a Ballat newly penned
I took it up in Kent,
If any ask who made the same,
To him I say the authors name
Is honest Jack of Lent.
2.
But ere I farther pass along,
Or let you know more of my Song,
I wish the doors were locked,
For if there be so base a Groom,
As one informs me in this room,
The Fiddlers may be knocked.
3.
It Is true, he had, I dare protest,
No kind of malice in his breast,
But Knaves are dangerous things;
And they of late are grown so bold,
They dare appear in cloth of Gold,
Even in the rooms of Kings.
4.
But hit or miss I will declare
The speeches at London and elsewhere,
Concerning this design,
Amongst the Drunkards it is said,
They hope her dowry shall be paid
In naught but Clarret wine.
5.
The Country Clowns when they repair
Either to Market or to Fair,
No sooner get their pots,
But straight they swear the time is come
That England must be overrun
Betwixt the French and Scots.
6.
The Puritans that never fail
Against Kings and Magistrates to rail,
With impudence aver,
That verily, and in good sooth,
Some Antichrist, or pretty youth,
Shall doubtless get of her.
7.
A holy Sister having hemmed,
And blow^ her nose, will say she dreamed,
Or else a Spirit told her,
That they and all these holy seed,
To Amsterdam must go to breed,
Ere they were twelve months older.
8.
And might but Jack Alent advise,
Those dreams of theirs should not prove lies,
For as he greatly fears,
They will be prating night and day,
Till verily, by yea, and nay,
They set's together by the ears.
9.
The Romish Catholics proclaim,
That Gundemore, though he be lame,
Yet can he do some tricks;
At Paris, he the King shall show
A pre-contract made, as I know,
Five hundred twenty six.
10.
But sure the State of France is wise,
And knows that Spain vents naught but lies,
For such is their Religion;
The Jesuits can with ease disgorge
From that their damned and hellish forge,
Foul falsehood by the Legion.
11.
But be it so, we will admit,
The State of Spain has no more wit,
Then to invent such tales,
Yet as great Alexander drew,
And cut the Gorgon knot in two,
So shall the Prince of Wales.
12.
The reverend Bishops whisper too,
That now they shall have much ado
With Friars and with Monks,
And eke their wives do greatly fear
Those bald pate knaves will mak't appear
They are Canonical punks.
13.
At Cambridge and at Oxford eke,
They of this match like Scholars speak
By figures and by tropes,
But as for the Supremacy,
The Body may King James's be,
But sure the Head's the Pope's.
14.
A Puritan stepped up and cries,
That he the major part denies,
And though he Logic scorns,
Yet he by revelation knows
The Pope no part of the headpiece ows
Except it be the horns.
15.
The learned in Astrology,
That wander up and down the sky,
And their discourse with stars,
Foresee that some of this brave rout
That now goes fair and soundly out,
Shall back return with scars.
16.
Professors of Astronomy,
That all the world knows, dare not lie
With the Mathematicians,
Prognosticate this Somer shall
Bring with the pox the Devil and all,
To Surgeons and Physicians.
17.
The Civil Lawyer laughs in's sleeve,
For he does verily believe
That after all these sports,
The Citzens will horn and grow,
And their ill-gotten goods will throw
About their bawdy Courts.
18.
And those that do Apollo court,
And with the wanton Muses sport,
Believe the time is come,
That Gallants will themselves address
To Masks and Plays, and Wantonness,
More than to fife and drum.
19.
Such as in music spend their days,
And
And study Songs and Roundelayes,
Begin
Begin to clear their throats,
For by some signs they do presage,
That this will prove a fidling age
Fit for men of their coats.
20.
But leaving Colleges and Schools.
To all those Clerks and learned Fools,
Lets through the city range,
For there are Sconces made of Horn,
Foresee things long ere they be born,
Which you will perhaps think strange.
21.
The Major and Aldermen being met,
And at a Custard closely set
Each in their rank and order,
The Major a question does propound,
And that unanswered must go round,
Till it comes to th'Recorder.
22.
For he is the City's Oracle,
And which you will think a Miracle,
He has their brains in keeping,
For when a Cause should be decreed,
He cries the bench are all agreed,
When most of them are sleeping,
23.
A Sheriff at lower end of the board
Cries Masters all hear me a word,
A bolt I Will only shoot,
We shall have Executions store
Against some gallants now gone over,
Wherefore good brethren look to it.
24.
The rascal Sergeants fleering stand,
Wishing their Charter reached the Strand,
That they might there intrude;
But since they are not yet content,
I wish that it to Tyburn went,
So they might there conclude.
25.
An Alderman both grave and wise
Cries brethren all let me advise,
Whilst wit is to be had,
That like good husbands we provide
Some speeches for the Lady bride,
Before all men go mad.
26.
For by my faith if we may guess
Of greater mischiefs by the less,
I pray let this suffice,
If we but on men's backs do look,
And look into each tradesmans book
You Will swear few men are wise.
27.
Some threadbare Poet we will press,
And for that day we will him dress,
At least in beaten Satin,
And he shall tell her from this bench,
That though we understand no French,
At Paul's, she may hear Lattin.
28.
But on this point they all demurre,
And each takes counsel of his furre
That smells of Fox and Cony,
At last a Mayor in high disdain,
Swears he much scorns that in his reign
Wit should be bought for money.
29.
For by this Sack I mean to drink,
I would not have my Sovereign think
for twenty thousand Crowns,
That I his Lord Lieutenant here,
And you my brethren should appear
Such errant witless Clownes.
30.
No, no, I have it in my head,
Devises that shall strike it dead,
And make proud Paris say
That little London has a Mayor
Can entertain their Lady fair,
As well as ere did they.
31
S. Georges Church shall be the place
Where first I mean to meet her grace,
And there St. George shall be
Mounted upon a dapple gray,
And gaping wide shall seem to say,
Welcome St. Dennis to me.
32.
From thence in order two by two
As we to Paul's are used to go,
To the Bridge we will convey her,
And there upon the top of the gate,
Where now stands many a Rascal's pate,
I mean to place a player.
33.
And to the Princess he shall cry,
May't please your Grace cast up your eye
And see these heads of Traitors;
Thus will the city serve all those
That to your Highness shall prove foes,
For they to Knaves are haters.
34.
Down Fishstreet hill a Whale shall shoot,
And meet her at the Bridges foot,
And forth of his mouth so wide a
Shall Jonas peep, and say, for fish,
As good as your sweetheart can wish,
You shall have hence each Friday.
35.
At Grace-church corner there shall stand
A troop of Graces hand in hand,
And they to her shall say,
Your Grace of France is welcome hither,
*It Is merry when Graces meet together,
I pray keep on your way.
36.
At the Exchange shall placed be,
In ugly shapes those sisters three
That give to each their fate,
And Spaine's Infanta shall stand by
Wringing their hands, and thus shall cry,
I do repent too late.
37.
There we a pair of gloves will give,
And pray her Highness long may live
On her white hands to wear them;
And though they have a Spanish scent,
The givers have no ill intent,
Wherefore she need not fear them*
38.
Nor shall the Conduits now run Claret,
Perhaps the Frenchman cares not for it,
They have at home so much,
No, I will make the boy to piss
No worse then purest Hypocris,
Her Grace never tasted such.
39.
About the Standard I think fit
Your wives, my brethren, all should sit,
And eke our Lady Mayris,
Who shall present a cup of gold,
And say if we might be so bold,
We Will drink to all in Paris.
40.
In Paul's Churchyard we breath may take,
For they such huge long speeches make,
Would tire any horse;
But there I Will put her grace in mind,
To cast her Princely head behind
And view S. Paul's Cross.
41.
Our Sergeants they shall go their way,
And for us at the Devil stay,
I mean at Temple-barre,
And there of her we leave will take,
And say 'twas for King Charles his sake
We went with her so far.
42.
But fearing I have tired the ears,
Both of the Duke and all these Peers,
I Will be no more uncivil,
I Will leave the Mayor with both the Sheriffs,
With Sergeants, hanging at their sleeves,
For this time at the Devil.
A SONG.
A Story strange I will you tell,
But not so strange as true,
Of a woman that danced upon the ropes,
And so did her husband too.
With a dildo, dildo, dildo,
With a dildo, dildo, dee,
Some say 'twas a man, but it was a woman
As plain report may see.
She first climbed up the Ladder
For to deceive men's hopes,
And with a long thing in her hand
She tickled it on the ropes.
With a dildo, dildo, dildo,
With a dildo, dildo, dee,
And to her came Knights and Gentlemen
Of low and high degree.
She jerk'd them backward and foreward
With a long thing in her hand,
And all the people that were in the yard,
She made them for to stand.
With a dildo, etc.
They cast up sleering eyes
All under-neath her clothes,
But they could see no thing,
For she wore linen hose.
With a dildo, etc.
The Cuckold her husband caper'd
When his head in the sack was in,
But grant that we may never fall
When we dance in the sack of sin.
With a dildo, etc.
And as they ever danced
In fair or rainy weather,
I wish they may be hanged in the rope of Love,
And so be cut down together.
With a dildo, etc.
Upon a House of Office over a River, set on fire by a Coal of TOBACCO.
OH fire, fire, fire, where?
The useful house over Water clear,
The most convenient in a shire,
Which no body can deny.
The house of Office that old true blue
Sir-reverence so many knew
You now may see turned fine new.
Which no body, etc.
And to our great astonishment
Though burnt, yet stands to represent
Both mourner and the monument,
Which no body, etc.
Ben Johnson's Vulcan would do well,
Or the merry Blades who knacks did tell,
At firing London Bridge befell.
Which no body, etc.
They Will say if I of thee should chant,
The matter smells, now out upon it;
But they shall have a fit of fie on it.
Which no body, etc.
And why not say a word or two
Of she that is just? witness all who
Have ever been at thy Ho go, haut goast.

Which no body, etc.
Earth, Air and Water, she could not
Affront, till chollerick fire got
Predominant, then thou grew*st hot,
Which no body, etc.
The present cause of all our woe,

Upon the Spanish Invasion in Eighty eight.
1.
IN Eighty eight, ere I was born,
As I do well remember a,
In August was a Fleet prepared,
The month before September a.
2.
Lishone, Cales and Portugal,
Toledo and Granada;
They all did meet, and made a Fleet,
And called it their Armada.
3.
There dwelt a little man in Spain
That shot well in a gun a;
Don Pedro hight, as black a wight
As the Knight of the Sun a.
4.
King Philip made him Admiral,
And charged him not to stay a,
But to destroy both man and boy,
And then to come his way a.
5.
He had thirty thousand of his own,
But to do us more harm a,
He charged him not to fight alone,
But to join with the Prince of Parma.
6.
They say they brought provision much
As Biskets, Beans and Bacon,
Besides, two ships were laden with whips,
But I think they were mistaken.
7.
When they had sailed all along,
And anchored before Dover,
The English men did board them then,
And heaved the Rascals over.
8.
The queen she was at Tilbury,
What could you more desire a?
For whose sweet sake Sir Francis Drake
Did set the ships on fire a.
9
Then let them neither brag nor boast,
For if they come again a,
Let them take heed they do not speed
As they did they know when a.
Upon the Gunpowder Plot.
1.
ANd will this wicked world never prove good?
Will Priests and Catholics never prove true?
Shall Catesby, Piercy and Rookwood
Make all this famous Land to rue?
With putting us in such a fear,
With huffing and snuffing and guni-powder,
With a Ohone hononoreera tarrareera, tarrareero hone.
2.
*Against the fifth of November, Tuesday by name,
Peircy and Catesby a Plot did frame,
Anno one thousand six hundred and five,
In which long time no man alive
Did ever know, or hear the like,
Which to declare my heart grows sike.
With a O hone, etc.
3.
Under the Parliament House men say
Great store of Powder they did lay,
Thirty six barrels, as is reported,
With many faggots ill consorted,
With bars of iron upon them all,
To bring us to a deadly fall.
With a O hone, etc.
4.
And then came forth Sir Thomas Knyvet,
You filthy Rogue come out of the door,
Or else I swear by Gods trivet
I Will lay thee flatlong on the floor,
For putting us all in such a fear,
With huffing and snuffing, etc.
5.
Then Faux out of the Vault was taken
And carried before Sir Francis Bacon,
And was examined of the Act,
And stoutly did confess the Fact,
And swore he would put us in such a fear.
With huffing, etc.
6.
Now sure it is a miraculous thing,
To see how God has preserved our King,
The Queen, the Prince, and his Sister dear,
And all the Lords, and every Peer,
And all the Land, and every shire,
From huffing, etc.
7.
Now God preserve the Council wise,
That first found out this enterprise;
Not they, but my Lord Monteagle,
His Lady and her little Beagle,
His Ape, his Ass, and his great Bear*
From huffing and snuffing, and gunni powder.
Other news I heard moreover,
If all was true that is told to me,
Three Spanish ships landed at Dover,*
Where they made great melody,
But the Hollanders drove them here and there,
With huffing, etc.
A CATCH.
DRink boys, drink boys, drink and do not spare,
Troule away the bowl, and take no care.
So that we have meat and drink, and money and clothes
What care we, what care we how the world goes.
A pitiful Lamentation.
MY Mother has sold away her Cock
And all her brood of Chickins,
And has bought her a new canvasse smock
And righted up the Kitchen.
And has brought me a Lockeram bond
With a v'lopping pair of breeches,
Thinking that Jone would have loved me alone,
But she has served me such yfiches*
Ise take a rope and drown my self,
Ere Is It endure these losses:
I Will take a hatchet and hang my self
Ere Is It endure these crosses.
Or else I Will go to some beacon high,
Made of some good dried furzon
And there I Will seem in love to fry
Sing hoodle a doodle Cuddon*
A Woman with Child that desired a Son, which might prove a Preacher.
AMaiden of the pure Scociety,
Prayed with a passing piety
That since a learned man had o're-reacht her,
The child she went withal should prove Preacher.
The time being come, and all the dangers past,
The Goodwife asked the Midwife
What God had sent at last.
Who answered her half in a laughter,
Quoth she the Son is proved a Daughter.
But be content, if God does bless the Baby,
She has a Pulpit where a Preacher may be.
The Maid of Tottenham.
1.
ASI went to Totnam
Upon a Market Day,
There met I with a fair maid
Clothed all in gray,
Her journey was to London
With Buttermilk and Whay,
To fall down, down, derry down,
down, down, derry down,
derry, derry dina.
2.
God speed fair maid, quoth one,
You are well over-took;
With that she cast her head aside,
And gave to him a look.
She was as full of Leachery
As letters in a book.
To fall down, etc.
3.
And as they walked together,
Even side by side,
The young man was aware
That her garter was untied,
For fear that she should lose it,
Aha, alack he cried,
Oh your garter that hangs down!
Down, down, derry down, etc.
4.
Quoth she I do entreat you
For to take the pain
To do so much for me,
As to tie it up again.
That will I do sweetheart, quoth he,
When I come on yonder plain.
With a down, down, derry down, etc.
5.
And when they came upon the plain
Upon a pleasant green,
The fair maid spread her legs abroad,
The young man fell between,
Such tying of a Garter
I think was never seen.
To fall down, etc.
6.
When they had done their business,
And quickly done the deed,
He gave her kisses plenty,
And took her up with speed.
But what they did I know not,
But they were both agreed
To fall down together, down
Down, down, derry down,
Down, down, derry dina.
7.
She made to him low curtsies
And thankt him for his pain,
The young man is to High-gate gone
The maid to London came
To sell off her commodity
She thought it for no shame.
To fall down, etc.
8.
When she had done her market,
And all her money told
To think upon the matter
It made her heart full cold
But that which will away, quoth she,
Is very hard to hold.
To fall down, etc.
9.
This tying of the Garter
Cost her her Maidenhead,
Quoth she it is no matter,
It stood me in small stead,
But often times it troubled me
As I lay in my bed.
To fall down, etc.
To the King on New-yeares day, 1638.
THis day inlarges every narrow mind,
Makes the Poor bounteous, and the Miser kind;
Poets that have not wealth in wished excess,
I hope may give like Priests, which is to bless.
And sure in elder times the Poets were
Those Priests that told men how to hope and fear,
Though they most sensually did write and live,
Yet taught those blessings, which the Gods did give.
But you (my King) have purified our flame,
Made wit our virtue which was once our shame;
For by your own quick fires you made ours last,
Reformed our numbers till our songs grew chaste.
Far more then famed Augustus ere could do
With His wisdom, (though it long continued too)
You have performed even in your Moon of age;
Refined to Lectures, Plays, to Schools a stage.
Such virtue got why is your Poet less
A Priest then his who had a power to bless?
So hopeful is my rage that I begin
To show that fear which strives to keep it in:
And what was meant a blessing soars so high
That it is now become a Prophecy.
Your self (our Plannet which renewes our year)
Shall so inlighten all, and every where,
That through the Mists of error men shall spy
In the dark North the way to Loyalty;
Whilst with your intellectual beams you show
The knowing what they are that seem to know.
You like our Sacred and indulgent Lord,
When the too-stout Apostle drew his sword,
When he mistook some secrets of the cause,
And in his furious zeal disdained the Laws,
Forgetting true Religion does lie
On prayers, not swords against authority.
You like our substitute of horrid fate
That are next him we most should imitate,
Shall like to him rebuke with wiser breath,
Such furious zeal, but not revenged with death.
Like him the wound that is given you strait shall heal,
Then calm by precept such mistaking zeal.
In praise of a deformed woman.
1.
I Love thee for thy curled hair,
As red as any Fox,
Our fore fathers did still commend
The lovely golden locks.
Venus her self might comelier be,
Yet has no such variety.
2.
I love thee for thy squinting eyes,
It breeds no jealousy,
For when thou do on others look,
Methinks thou look on me.
Venus her self, etc.
3.
I love thee for thy copper nose,
Thy fortune's never the worse,
It shows the metal in thy face
Thou should have in thy purse
Venus her self, etc.
4.
I love thee for thy Chessenut skin,
Thy inside's white to me,
That color should be most approved,
That will least changed be.
Venus her self, etc.
5.
I love thee for thy splay mouth,
For on that amarous close
There Is room on either side to kiss,
And never offend the nose.
Venus her self, etc.
6.
I love thee for thy rotten gummes,
In good time it may hap,
When other wives are costly fed,
I Will keep thy chaps with pap.
Venus her self, etc.
7.
I love thee for thy blobber lips,
It Is good thrift I suppose,
They Are dripping-pans unto thy eyes,
And save-alls to thy nose.
Venus her self, etc.
8.
I love thee for thy huncht back,
It Is bowed although not broken,
For I believe the Gods did send
Me to thee for a Token.
Venus her self, etc.
9.
I love thee for thy pudding wast,
If a Tailor thou do lack,
Thou need'st not send to France for one,
I Will fit thee with a sack.
Venus her self, etc.
10.
I love thee for thy lusty thighs,
For tressels thou may boast,
Sweetheart thou have a water-mill,
And these are the mill-posts.
Venus her self, etc.
10.
I love thee for thy splay feet,
They Are fools that thee deride,
Women are always most esteemed,
When their feet are most wide.
Venus her self may comelier be, etc.
On a TINKER.
HE that a Tinker, a Tinker, a Tinker will be,
Let him leave other Loves, and come follow me.
Though he travells all the day,
Yet he comes home still at night,
And dallies, dallies with his Doxie,
And dreams of delight.
His pot and his tossed in the morning he takes,
And all the day long good music he makes;
He wanders up and down to Wakes and to Fairs,
He casts his cap, and casts his cap at the Court and its cares;
And when to the town the Tinker does come,
Oh, how the wanton wenches run,
Some bring him basins, and some bring him bowls,
All maids desire him to stop up their holes.
Prinkum Prankum is a fine dance, strong Ale is good in the winter,
And he that thrumms a wench upon a brass pot,
The child may prove a Tinker.
With tink goes the hammer, the skellit and the scummer,
Come bring me thy copper kettle,
For the Tinker, the Tinker, the merry merry Tinker,
Oh he is the man of mettle.
Upon his Mistris's black Eyebrows.
HIde, oh hide those lovely Brows,
Cupid takes them for his bows,
And from thence with winged dart
He lies pelting at my heart,
Nay, unheard of wounds does give,
Wounded in the heart I live;
From their color I descry,
Loves bows are made of Ebony;
Or their Sable seems to say
They mourn for those their glances slay;
Or their blackness does arise
From the Sunbeams of your eyes,
Where Apollo seems to sit,
As he is God of Day, and Wit;
Your piercing Rays, so bright, and clear,
Shows his beamy Chariots there.
Then the black upon your brow,
Say wisdoms sable hue,
Tells to every obvious eye,
There Is his other Deity.
This too shows him deeply wise,
To dwell there he left the skies;
So pure a black could Phoebus burn,
He himself would Negro turn,
And for such a dress would slight
His gorgeous attire of light;
Eclipses he would count a bliss,
Were there such a black as this:
Were Night's dusky mantle made
Of so glorious a shade,
The ruffling day she would outvie
In costly dress, and gallantry:
Were Hell's darkness such a black,
For it the Saints would Heaven forsake;
So pure a black, that white from hence
Loses its name of innocence;
And the most spotless Ivory is
A very stain and blot to this:
So pure a black, that hence I guess,
Black first became a holy dress.
The Gods foreseeing this, did make
Their Priests array themselves in Black.
To my Lady of Carnarvon, January 1.
IDol of our Sex! Envy of thine own!
Whom not to have seen, is never to have known,
What eyes are good for; to have seen, not loved,
Is to be more, or less then man, unmoved;
Deigne to accept, what I in the name of all
Thy servants pay to this days Festival,
Thanks for the old year, prayers for the new,
So may thy many days to come seem few,
So may fresh springs in thy blew rivolets flow,
To make thy roses, and thy lillies grow.
So may all dressings still become thy face,
As if they grew there, or stole thence their grace*
So may thy bright eyes comfort with their rays
The humble, and dazzle those that boldly gaze:
So may thy sprightly motion, beauties best part,
Show there is stock enough of life at heart.
So may thy warm snow never grow more cold,
So may they live to be, but not seem old.
So may thy Lord pay all, yet rest thy debtor,
And love no other, till he sees a better:
So may the new year crown the old years joy,
By giving us a Girl unto our Boy;
In The one the Fathers wit, and in the other
Let us admire the beauty of the Mother,
That so we may their several pictures see,
Which now in one fair Medall joined be:
Till then grow thus together, and however
You grow old in your selves, grow still young here;
And let him, though he may resemble either,
Seem to be both in one, and singly neither.
Let Ladies wagers lay, whose chin is this,
Whose forehead that, whose lip, whose eye, then kiss
Away the difference, whilst he smiling lies,
To see his own shape dance in both your eyes.
Sweet Babe! my prayer shall end with thee,
(Oh may it prove a Prophecy!)
May all the channells in thy veins
Express the several noble strains,
From whence they flow; sweet Sydney's wit,
But not the sad, sweet fate of it;
The last great Pembroke's learning, sage
Burleigh's both wisdom and his age;
Thy Grandsires honest heart express
The Veres untainted nobleness.
To these (if any thing there lacks)
Add Dormer too, and Molenax.
Lastly, if for thee I can woo
Gods, and thy Godfathers grace too,
Together with thy Fathers Thrift:
Be thou thy Mothers New-years-gift.
The Western Husband-man's Complaint in the late Wars.
UDs bodykins! Chill work no more:
Do think chill labor to be poor?
No ich have more a do:
If of the world this be the trade,
That ich must break zo knaves be made,
Ich will a blundering too.
Chill zel my cart and eke my plow,
And get a zword if ich know how,
For ich mean to be right:
Chill learn to zwear, and drink, and roar,
And (Gallant leek) chill keep a whore,
No matter who can vight.
God bless us! What a world is here,
It can never last another year,
Vor ich cannot be able to zoe:
Do think that ever chad the art,
To plow the ground up with my cart,
My beasts be all a go.
But vurst a Warrant ich will get
From Master Captain, that a vet
Chill make a shrewd a do:
Vor then chave power in any place,
To steal a Horse without disgrace,
And beat the owner too.
Ich had zix oxen the other day,
And them the Roundheads vetcht away,
A mischief be their speed:
And chad zix horses left me whole,
And them the Cabbaleroes stole:
Chee voor men be agreed,
Here ich do labor, toil and zweat,
And dure the cold, with dry and heat,
And what do think ich get?
Vaith just my labor vor my pains,
The garrisons have all the gains,
Vor thither all is avet.
There goes my corn and beans, and pease,
Ich do not dare them to displease,
They do zo zwear and vapor:
When to the Governor ich do come,
And pray him to discharge my zum,
Chave nothing but a paper.
U'ds nigs do think that paper will
Keep warm my back and belly fill?
No, no, go vange thy note:
If that another year my vield
No profit do unto me yield,
Ich may go cut my throat.
When any money chove in store,
Then straight a warrant comes therefore,
Or ich must blundred be:
And when chave shuffled out one pay,
Then comes another without delay,
Was ever the leek azee?
If all this be not grief enough,
They have a thing called quarter too,
O'ts a vengeance waster:
A pox upon it they call it vree,
Cham zure they make us zlaves to be,
And every rogue our master.
The Highway man's Song.
I Keep my Horse, I keep my Whore,
I take no Rents, yet am not poor,
I traverse all the land about,
And yet was born to never a foot;
With Partridge plump, and Woodcock fine,
I do at midnight often dine;
And if my whore be not in case,
My Hostess daughter has her place.
The maids sit up, and watch their turns,
If I stay long the Tapster mourns;
The Cook-maid has no mind to sin,
Though tempted by the Chamberlin;
But when I knock, O how they bustle;
The hostler yawns, the geldings justle;
If maid be sleep, oh how they curse her!
And all this comes of, Deliver your purse sir.
Against Fruition, etc.
THere is not half so warm a fire
In the Fruition, as Desire.
When I have got the fruit of pain,
Possession makes me poor again,
Expected forms and shapes unknown,
Whet and make sharp tentation;
Sense is too niggardly for Bliss,
And pays me dully with what is;
But fancy's liberal, and gives all
That can within her vastness fall;
Veil therefore still, while I divine
The Treasure of this hidden Mine,
And make Imagination tell
What wonders does in Beauty dwell.
Upon Mr. Fullers Book, called Pisgah-sight.
FUller of wish, than hope, methinks it is*
For me to expect a fuller work than this,
Fuller of matter, fuller of rich sense,
Fuller of Art fuller of Eloquence;
Yet dare I not be bold, to entitle this
The fullest work; the Author fuller is,
Who, though he empty not himself, can fill
Another fuller, yet continue still
Fuller himself, and so the Reader be
Always in hope a fuller work to see.
On a Sheepherd that died for Love.
1.
CLoris, now thou art fled away,
Aminta's Sheep are gone astray,
And all the joys he took to see
His pretty Lambs run after thee.
She Is gone, she is gone, and he always,
Sings nothing now but welladay.
2.
His Oaten pipe that in thy praise,
Was wont to play such roundelayes,
Is thrown away, and not a Swain
Dares pipe or sing within this Plain.
It Is death for any now to say
One word to him, but welladay.
3.
The May Pole where thy little feet
So roundly did in measure meet,
Is broken down, and no content
Came near Amyntas since you went.
All that ere I heard him say,
Was Cloris, Cloris, welladay.
4.
Upon those banks you used to tread,
He ever since has laid his head,
And whispered there such pining woe,
That not one blade of grass will grow.
Oh Cloris, Cloris, come away,
And hear Aminta' s welladay.
5.
The embroidered scrip he used to wear
Neglected hangs, so does his hair.
His Crook is broke, Dog pining lies,
And he himself naught does but cries,
Oh Cloris, Cloris, come away,
And hear, etc.
6.
His gray coat, and his slops of green,
When worn by him, were comely seen,
His tar-box too is thrown away,
There Is no delight near him must stay,
But cries, oh Cloris come away,
Aminta' s dying, welladay.
The Shepherds lamentation for the loss of his Love.
1.
DOwn lay the Shepherds Swain,
So sober and demure,
Wishing for his wench again,
So bonny and so pure.
With his head on hillock low,
And his arms on kembow;
And all for the loss of her Hy nonny nonny no.
2.
His tears fell as thin,
As water from a Still,
His hair upon his chin,
Grew like time upon a hill:
His cherry cheeks were pale as snow,
Testifying his mickle woe;
And all was for the loss of her hy nonny nonny no.
3.
Sweet she was, as fond of love,
As ever fettred Swain;
Never such a bonny one
Shall I enjoy again.
Set ten thousand on a row,
I Will forbid that any show
Ever the like of her, hy nonny nonny no.
4.
Faced she was of Filbard hew,
And bosomed like a Swanne:
Backed she was of bended yew,
And wasted by a span.
Hair she had as black as Crow,
From the head unto the toe,
Down down all over, hy nonny nonny no.
5.
With her Mantle tuckt up high,
She foddered her Flock,
So buckesome and alluringly,
Her knee upheld her smock;
So nimbly did she use to go,
So smooth she danced on tip-toe,
That all men were fond of her, hy nonny nonny no.
6.
She simpred like a Holy Day,
And smiled like a Spring,
She pratled like a Popinjay,
And like a Swallow sing.
She tript it like a barren Do,
And strutted like a Gar-crowe:
Which made me so fond of her, hy, etc.
7.
To trip it on the merry Down,
To dance the lively Hay,
To wrestle for a green Gown,
In heat of all the day,
Never would she say me no.
Yet me thought she had though
Never enough of her, hy, etc.
8.
But gone she is the blithest Less
That ever trod on Plain.
What ever has betided her,
Blame not the Shepherd Swain.
For why, she was her own foe,
And gave her self the overthrowe,
By being too frank of her hy nonny nonny no.
A Ballad on Queen Elizabeth;
to the tune of Sallengers round.
I Tell you all both great and small,
And I tell you it truly,
That we have a very great cause,
Both to lament and cry,
Oh fie, oh fie, oh fie, oh fie,
Oh fie on cruel death;
For he has taken away from us
Our Queen Elizabeth.
He might have taken other folk,
That better might have been mist,
And let our gracious Queen alone,
That loved not a Popish Priest.
She ruled this Land alone of her self,
And was beholding to no man.
She bare the weight of all affairs,
And yet she was but a woman.
A woman said I? nay that is more
Nor any man can tell,
So chaste she was, so pure she was,
That no man knew it well.
For whilst that she lived till cruel death
Exposed her to all.
Wherefore I say lament, lament,
Lament both great and small.
She never did any wicked thing,
Might make her conscience prick her,
And scorned for to submit her self to him
That calls himself Christ's Vicker:
But rather chose courageously
To fight under Christ's Banner,
Against Turk and Pope, I and King of Spain,
And all that durst withstand her.
She was as Chaste and Beautiful,
And Fair as ere was any;
And had from forain Countries sent
Her Suitors very many.
Though Mounsieur came himself from France,
A purpose for to woe her,
Yet still she lived and died a Maid,
Do what they could unto her.
And if that I had Argus eyes,
They were too few to weep,
For our sweet Queen Elizabeth,
Who now does lie asleep:
A sleep I say she now does lie,
Until the day of Doom:
But then shall awake unto the disgrace
Of the proud Pope of Rome.
A Ballad on King James;
to the tune of When Arthur first in Court began.
WHen James in Scotland first began,
And there was crowned King,
He was not much more then a span,
All in his clouts swaddling.
But when he waxed into years,
And grew to be somewhat tall,
And told his Lords, a Parliament
He purposed to call.
That Is over* much quoth Douglas though,
For thee to do I fear,
For I am Lord Protector yet,
And will be one half year.
It pleases me well, quoth the King,
What thou have said to me,
But since thou stand on such terms,
I Will prove as strict to thee.
And well he ruled and well he curbed
Both Douglas and the rest;
Till Heaven with better Fortune and Power,
Had him to England blessed.
Then into England straight he came
As fast as he was able,
Where he made many a Carpet Knight,
Though none of the Round Table.
And when he entered Barwicke Town,
Where all in peace he found:
But when that roaring Megge went off,
His Grace was like to swound.
Then up to London straight he came,
Where he made no long stay,
But soon returned back again,
To meet his Queen by the way.
And when they met, such tilting was,
The like was never seen;
The Lords at each others did run,
And near a tilt between.
Their Horses backs were under them,
And that was no great wonder,
The wonder was to see them run,
And break no Staves in sunder.
They ran full swift and coucht their Spears,
O ho quoth the Ladies then,
They run for show, quoth the people though,
And not to hurt the men.
They smote full hard at Barriers too,
You might have heard the sound,
As far as any man can go,
When both his legs are bound.
Upon the death of a Chandler.
THe Chandler grew near his end,
Pale Death would not stand his friend;
But took it in soul snuff,
As having tarryed long enough:
Yet left this not to be forgotten,
Death and the Chandler could not cotton.
1.
Far in the Forest of Arden,
There dwelt a Knight hight Cassimen,
As bold as Isenbras:
Fell he was and eager bent
In battle and in Turnament,
As was the good Sr. Topas.
2.
He had (as Antique stories tell)
A daughter cleped Dowsabell,
A Maiden fair and free,
Who, cause she was her fathers heir,
Full well she was y-tought the leire
Of mickle courtesy.
3.
The Silk well could she twist and twine,
And make the fine Marchpine,
And with the needle work.
And she could help the Priest to say
His Mattins on a Holy Day,
And sing a Psalm in Kirk.
4.
Her Frocke was of the frolique Green,
(Might well become a Maiden Queen)
Which seemly was to see:
Her Hood to it was neat and fine,
In color like the Columbine,
y-wrought full ^eatuously.
5.
This Maiden in a morn betime,
Went forth when May was in her prime,
To get sweet Scettuall,
The Honey suckle, the Horelock,
The Lilly, and the Ladies-Smock,
To dight her summer Hall.
6.
And as she romed here, and there,
Y-picking of the bloomed brier,
She chanced to epsy
A Shepherd sitting on a bank,
Like Chanticleere he crowed crank,
And pip'd with merry glee.
7.
He leerd his Sheep as he him list,
When he would whistle in his fist,
To feed about him round,
Whilst he full many a Caroll sung,
That all the fields, and meadows rung,
And made the woods resound.
8.
In favor this same Shepherd Swain
Was like the Bedlam Tamerlaine,
That kept proud Kings in awe.
But meek he was as meek might be,
Yea like the gentle Abell, he
Whom his lewd brother slew.
9.
This Shepherd ware a freeze-gray Cloak,
The which was of the finest lock,
That could be cut with Sheere:
His Aule and Lingell in a Thong,
His Tar-box by a broad belt hung,
His Cap of Minivere.
10.
His Mittens were of Bausons skin,
His Cockers were of Cordowin,
His Breech of country blew:
All curle, and crisped were his Locks,
His brow more white then Albion Rocks:
So like a Lover true.
11.
And piping he did spend the day,
As merry as a Popinjay,
Which liked fair Dowsabell,
That wod she ought, or wod she naught,
The Shepherd would not from her thought,
In love she longing fell:
12.
With that she tucked up her Frock,
(White as the Lilly was her Smock,)
And drew the Shepherd nigh,
But then the Shepherd pip'd a good,
That all his Sheep for sook their food,
To hear his melody.
13.
Thy Sheep (quoth she) cannot be lean,
That have so fair a Shepherd Swain,
That can his Pipe so well:
I but (quoth he) the Shepherd may,
If Piping thus he pine away,
For love of Dowsabell.
14.
Of love (fond boy) take thou no keep,
Look well (quoth she) unto thy Sheep;
Lest they should chance to stray.
So had I done (quoth he) full well,
Had I not seen fair Dowsabell,
Come forth to gather May.
15.
I cannot stay (quoth she) till night,
And leave my Summer Hall undight,
And all for love of men.
Yet are you, quoth he, too unkind,
If in your heart you cannot find,
To love us now and then.
16.
And I will be to thee as kind,
As Collin was to Rosalinde,
Of courtesy the flower.
And I will be as true (quoth she)
As ever Lover yet might be,
Unto her Paramour.
17.
With that the Maiden bent her knee,
Down by the Shepherd kneeled she,
And sweetly she him kissed.
But then the Shepherd whoop'd for joy,
(Quoth he) was never Shepherds boy,
That ever was so blist.
Upon the Scots being beaten at Muscleborough field.
ON the twelfth day of December,
In the fourth year of King Edwards reign
Two mighty Hosts (as I remember)
At Muscleborough did pitch on a Plain.
For a down, down, derry derry down, Hey down a.
Down, down, down a down derry.
All night our English men they lodged there,
So did the Scots both stout and stubborn,
But well-away was all their cheer,
For we have served them in their own turn.
For a down, etc.

All night they carded for our English men's Coats,
(They fished before their Nets were spun)
A white for Sixpence, a red for two Groats;
Wisdom would have stayed till they had been won.
For a down, etc.

On the tewelfth day all in the morn,
They made a fere as if they would fight;
But many a proud Scot that day was down born,
And many a rank Coward was put to his flight.
For a down, etc.

And the Lord Huntley, we hadden him there,
With him he brought ten thousand men:
But God be thanked, we gave him such a Banquet,
He carried but few of them home again.
For a down, etc.

For when he heard our great Guns crack,
Then did his heart fall until his hose,
He threw down his Weapons, he turned his back,
He ran so fast that he fell on his nose.
For a down, etc.

We beat them back till Edenbrough,
(There Is men alive can witness this)
But when we looked our English men through,
Two hundred good fellows we did not miss.
For a down, etc.

Now God preserve Edward our King,
With his two Nuncles and Nobles all,
And send us Heaven at our ending:
For we have given Scots a lusty fall.
For a down, down, derry derry down, Hey,
Down a down down, down a down derry.
Lips and Eyes.
IN Celia a question did arise,
Which were more beautiful her Lips or Eyes.
We, said the Eyes, send forth those pointed darts,
Which pierce the hardest Adamantine hearts.
From us, (replied the Lips) proceed the blisses
Which Lovers reap by kind words and sweet kisses.
Then wept the Eyes, and from their Springs (did power
Of liquid Oriental Pearl a shower:
Whereat the Lips moved with delight and pleasure,
Through a sweet smile unlockt their pearly
And bad Love judge, whether did add more grace, Treasure:
Weeping or smiling Pearls in Celia's face.
On black Eyes.
Black Eyes; in your dark Orbs do lie,
My ill or happy destiny,
If with clear looks you me behold,
You give me Mines and Mounts of Gold;
If you dart forth disdainful rays,
To your own die, you turn my days.
Black Eyes, in your dark Orbs by changes dwell,
My bane or bliss, my Paradise or Hell.
That Lamp which all the Stars does blind,
Yields to your luster in some kind,
Though you do wear, to make you bright,
No other dress but that of night:
He glitters only in the day.
You in the dark your Beams display.
Black Eyes, etc.

The cunning Theif, that lurkes for prize,
At some dark corner watching lies;
So that heart-robbing God does stand
In the dark Lobbies, Shaft in hand,
To rifle me of what I hold
More precious far then Indian Gold.
Black Eyes, etc.

Oh powerful Negromantick Eyes,
Who in your circles strictly pries,
Will find that Cupid with his dart,
In you does practice the black Art:
And by the Enchantment I Am poslest,
Tryes his conclusion in my breast.
Black Eyes, etc.

Look on me though in frowning wise,
Some kind of frowns become black eyes,
As pointed Diamonds being set,
Cast greater luster out of Jet.
Those pieces we esteem most rare,
Which in night shadows postur'd are.
Darkness in Churches congregates the sight,
Devotion strayes in glaring light.
Black Eyes, in your dark Orbs by changes dwell,
My bane, or bliss, my Paradise, or Hell.
CRVELTY.
WE read of Kings, and Gods that kindly took
A Pitcher filled with water from the Brook.
But I have daily tendered without thanks,
Rivers of tears that overflow their banks.
A slaughtred Bull will appease angry Jove,
A Horse the Sun, a Lamb the God of Love.
But she disdains the spotless sacrifice
Of a pure heart that at her Altar lies:
Vesta's not displeased if her chaste Urn
Do with repaired fuel ever burn;
But my Saint frowns, though to her honored name
I consecrate a never dying flame:
The Assyrian King did none in the furnace throw,
But those that to his Image did not bow:
With bended knees I daily worship her,
Yet she consumes her own Idolater.
Of such a Goddess no times leave record,
That burnt the Temple where she was adored.
A Sonnet.
WHat ill luck had I, filly Maid that I am,
To be tied to a lasting vow;
Or ere to be laid by the side of a man,
That wooed, and cannot tell how;
Down didle down, down didle me.
Oh that I had a Clown that he might down didle me,
With a courage to take mine down.
What punishment is that man worthy to have,
That thus will presume to wedde,
He deserves to be laid alive in his grave,
That wooed and cannot in bed;
Down didle down down didle me.
Oh that I had a Lad that he might down didle me,
For I fear I shall run mad*
The Doctors Touchstone.
I Never did hold, all that glisters is Gold,
Unless by the Touch it be tried;
Nor ever could find, that it was a true sign,
To judge a man by the outside.
A poor flash of wit, for a time may be fit
To wrangle a question in Schools.
Good dressing, gay clothes, with other fine shows,
May serve to make painted fools.
That man will beguile, in your face that will smile,
And court you with Cap and with knee:
And while you're in health, or swimming in wealth,
Will vow that your Servant he will be.
That man I Will commend, and would have to my friend
If I could tell where to choose him,
That will help me at need, and stand me in stead,
When I have occasion to use him.
do not him fear, that will swagger and swear,
And draw upon every cross word,
And forth with again if you be rough and plain,
Be contented to put up his sword.
Him valiant I deem, that patient can seem,
And fights not in every place,
But on good occasion, without seeking evasion
Durst look his proud Foe in the face.
That Physician shall pass that is all for his glass
And no other sign can scan,
Who to practice did hop, from Apothecaries shop,
Or some old Physicians man.
He Physic shall give to me whilst I live,
That has more strings to his Bow,
Experience and learning, with due deserving,
And will talk on no more then he know.
That Lawyer I hate, that will wrangle and prate,
In a matter not worth the hearing:
And if fees do not come, can be silent and dumb,
Though the cause deserves but the clearing.
That Lawyer's for me, that is not all for his see,
But will do his utmost endeavor
To stand for the right, and tug against might,
And lift the truth as with a Leaver.
The Spark I do scorn, that is only well born,
And brags of his ancient house,
Yet his birth cannot fit, with money nor wit,
But feeds on his friends like a Louse,
That man I more prize, that by virtue does rise
Unto some worthy degree,
That by breeding has got, what by birth he (had not,
A carriage that is noble and free.
I care not for him, that in riches d th swim,
And flants it in every fashion,
That brags of his Grounds and prates of his Hounds,
And his business is all recreation.
For him I will stand, that has wit with his Land,
And will sweat for his Countries good,
That will stick to the Laws, and in a good cause
Will adventure to spend his heart-blood.
That man I despise, that thinks himself wise,
Because he can talk at Table,
And at a rich feast break forth a poor jest,
To the laughter of others more able.
No, he has more wit, that silent can sit,
Yet knows well enough how to do it,
That speaks with reason, and laughs in due season
And when he is moved unto it.
I care not a fly, for a house that is built high,
And yields not a cup of good beer,
Where scraps you may find, while Venison's in kind
For a week or two in a year.
He a better house keeps, that every night sleeps
Under a Covert of thatch,
Where Is good Beef from the Stall, and a fire in the Hall,
Where you need not to scramble nor snatch.
Then lend me your Touch, for dissembling (there is much,
I Will try them before I do trust.
For a base needy Slave, in show may be brave,
And a sliding Companion seem just.
The man that is down right, in heart and in sight,
Whose life and whose looks does agree,
That speaks what he thinks, and sleeps when (he winks,
O that is a companion for me.
A copy of Verses of a money Marriage.
1.
NO Gypsy nor no Blackamore,
No Bloomesbery, nor Turnbald whore,
Can halse so black, so foul appear,
As she I chose to be my Dear.
She Is wrinkled, old, she is dry, she is tough,
Yet money makes her fair enough.
2.
Nature's hand shaking did dispose,
Her cheeks fair red unto her nose,
Which shined like that wanton light,
Misguideth wanderers in the night.
Yet for all this I do not care,
Though she be foul, her money's fair.
3.
Her tangled Locks do show to sight,
Like Horses manes, whom haggs affright.
Her Bosom through her veil of Lawne,
Shows more like Pork, her Neck like Brawn.
Yet for all this I do not care,
Though she be foul, her money's fair.
4.
Her teeth, to boast the Barbers fame,
Hang all up in his wooden frame.
Her lips are hairy, like the skin
Upon her brows, as lank as thin.
Yet for all this I do not care,
Though she be foul, her money's fair.
5.
Those that her company do keep,
Are rough hoarse coughs, to break my sleep.
The Palsy, Gout, and Plurisie,
And I^iue in her leg and thigh.
Yet me it grieves not, who am sure
That Gold can all diseases cure.
6.
Then young men do not jeere my lot,
That beauty left, and money got:
For I have all things having Gold,
And beauty too, since beautie's sold.
For Gold by day shall please my sight,
When all her faults lie hid at night.
The baseness of Whores.
TRust no more, a wanton Whore,
If thou love health and freedom,
They are so base, in every place,
It Is pity that bread should feed 'um.
All their fence, is impudence,
Which some call good conditions.
Stink they do, above ground too,
Of Chirurgions and Physicians.
If you are nice, they have their spice,
On which they will chew to flout you,
And if you not discern the plot,
You have no Nose about you.
Furthermore, they have in store,
For which I deadly hate 'um,
Persumed gear, to stuff each ear,
And for their cheeks Pomatum.
Liquorish Sluts, they feast their guts,
At Chuffs cost, like Princes,
Amber Plumes, and Mackarumes,
And costly candy'd Quinces.
Potato plump, supports the Rump,
Eringo strengthens nature.
Viper Wine, so heats the chine,
They Will gender with a Satyr,
Names they own were never known
Throughout their generation,
Noblemen are kind to them,
At least by approbation:
Many dote on one gay Coat,
But mark what there is stamped on it,
A stone Horse wild, with tool defiled,
Two Goats, a Lion rampant.
Truth to say, Paint and Array,
Makes them so highly prized.
Yet not one well, of ten can tell,
If ever they were baptized.
And if not, then it is a blot,
Past cure of Sponge or Laver:
And we may sans question say
The Devil was their Godfather.
Now to leave them, he receive them,
Whom they most confide in,
Whom that is, ask Tib or Sis,
Or any whom next you ride in*
If in sooth, she speaks the truth,
She says excuse I pray you,
The beast you ride, where I confide,
Will in due time convey you.
A Lover disclosing his love to his Mistress.
LEt not sweet St. let not these eyes offend you,
Nor yet the message, that these lines impart,
The message my unfeined love does send you,
Love that your self has planted in my heart.
For being charmed by the bewitching art
Of those inveigling graces that attend you:
Love's holy fire kindled has in part
These never-dying flames, my breast does send you.
Now if my lines offend, let love be blamed,
And if my love displease, accuse my eyes,
And if mine eyes sin, their sins cause only lies
On your bright eyes, that has my heart inflamed.
Since eyes love, lines err, then by your direction,
Excuse my eyes, my lines, and my affection.
The contented Prisoner his praise of Sack.
HOw happy's that Prisoner
That conquers his fates,
With silence, and never
On bad fortune complains,
But carelessely plays
With his Keys on the Grates,
And makes a sweet consort
With them and his chayns.
He drowns care with Sack,
When his thoughts are oppressed,
And makes his heart float,
Like a Cork in his Breast.
The Chorus.
Then,
Since we are all slaves,
That Ilanders be,
And our Land's a large prison,
Enclosed with the Sea:
We Will drink up the Ocean,
To set our selves free,
For man is the World's Epitome.
Let Pirates wear Purple,
Deep died in the blood
Of those they have slain,
The Scepter to sway.
If our conscience be clear,
And our title be good,
With the rags we have on us,
We are richer then they.
We drink down at night,
What we beg or can borrow,
And sleep without plotting
For more the next morrow.
Since we, etc.

Let the Usurer watch
Ore his bags and his house,
To keep that from Robbers,
He has rackt from his debtors,
Each midnight cries Thieves,
At the noise of a mouse,
Then see that his Trunks
Be fast bound in their Fetters.
When once he is grown rich enough
For a State plot,
Buff in an hour plunders
What threescore years got.
Since we, etc.

Come Drawer fill each man
A peck of Canary,
This Brimmer shall bid
All our senses goodnight.
When old Aristotle
Was frolic and merry,
By the juice of the Grape,
He turned Stsgarite.
Copernicus once
In a drunken fit found,
By the coruse of his brains,
That the world turned round.
Since we, etc.

It Is Sack makes our faces
Like Comets to shine,
And gives beauty beyond
The Complexion mask,
Diogenes fell so
In love with this Wine,
That when 'twas all out,
He dwelt in the Cask.
He lived by the sent
Of this Wainscoated Room;
And dying desired
The Tub for his Tomb.
Since we, etc.

Of DESIRE.
FIre, Fire!
O how I burn in my desire.
For all the tears that I can strain
Out of my empty lovesick brain,
Cannot assuage my scorching pain.
Come Humber, Trent, and silver Thames,
The dread Ocean haste with all thy streams,
And if thou can not quench my fire,
Then drown both me and my Desire.
Fire, Fire!
Oh there is no hell to my desire.
See how the Rivers backward lie,
The Ocean does his tide deny,
For fear my flames should drink them dry.
Come heavenly showers, come pouring down,
You all that once the world did drown.
You then saved some, and now save all,
Which else would burn, and with me fall.
Upon kind and true Love.
It Is not how witty, nor how free,
Nor yet how beautiful she be,
But how much kind and true to me.
Freedom and Wit none can confine,
And Beauty like the Sun does shine,
But kind and true are only mine.
Let others with attention sit,
To listen, and admire her wit,
That is a rock where I Will not split,
Let others dote upon her eyes*
And burn their hearts for sacrifice,
Beauty's a calm where danger lies.
But Kind and True have been long tried,
And harbor where we may confide,
And safely there at anchor ride.
From change of winds there we are free,
And need not fear Storme's tyranny,
Nor Pirat, though a Prince he be.
Upon his Constant Mistress.
She Is not the fairest of her name,
But yet she conquers more than all the race,
For she has other motives to inflame,
Besides a lovely face.
There Is Wit and Constancy,
And Charms, that strikes the soul more than (the Eye.
It Is no easy lover knows how to discover
Such Divinity.
And yet she is an easy book,
Written in plain language for the meaner wit,
A stately garb, and a gracious look,
With all things justly fit.
But age will undermine
This glorious outside, that appears so fine,
When the common Lover
Shrinks and gives her over,
Then she is only mine.
To the Platonic that applies
His clear addresses only to the mind;
The body but a Temple signifies,
Wherein the Saints inshrin'd,
To him it is all one,
Whether the walls be marble, or rough stone;
Nay in holy places, which old time defaces,
More devotion's shown.
The Ghost-Song.
It Is late and cold, stir up the fire,
Sit close, and draw the table nigher,
Be merry, and drink wine that is old,
A hearty medicine against the cold;
Your bed of wanton down the best,
Where you may tumble to your rest:
I could well wish you wenches too,
But I am dead, and cannot do.
Call for the best, the house will ring,
Sack, White and Claret, let them bring,
And drink apace, whilst breath you have,
You Will find but cold drinking in the grave:
Partridge, Plover for your dinner,
And a Capon for the sinner,
You shall find ready when you are up,
And your horse shall have his sup.
Welcome, welcome, shall fly round,
And I shall smile, though under ground.
You that delight in Trulls and Minions,
Come buy my four ropes of St. Omers Onions.
FINIS.
