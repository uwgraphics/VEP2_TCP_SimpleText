His Majesty's Proclamation concerning the bringing in of Arms to His Magazine
in the City of Worcester.
WHEREAS We are informed, that several Persons in Our County of Worcester, who
by Law ought not to have Arms, have underhand provided themselves of great
Quantities, and that both they, and other Persons have in their hands great
store of Arms sold, lost and left in that County, by Our Army, and by the Army
of the Rebels, under the Command of the Earl of Essex, which Arms it highly
concerns Our Safety and the Peace of that County, in a time of so great Danger
and Distractions, that especial Care be taken, least they remain in unknown
hands, and so be in danger to be employed against Us, and Our good Subjects;
Therefore Our Will and Pleasure is, and We do hereby charge and Command all
such of Our Subjects in Our County of Worcester, who by Law ought not to have
Arms, and all such who have in their Custody any Arms either for Horse or
Foot belonging to any of the Soldiers of Our Army, or to the Army under the
Command of the Earl of Essex, or were sold or lost by them, That they fail
not to bring them in, within four days after this Publication of Our
Pleasure, to Our to Colonel Sandys; or to such Magazine at Worcester, and
deliver them to Colonel Sandys; or to such Persons as he shall appoint And
hereof We require them not to fail, as they desire not to give Us any
Testimony of their ill Affection to Us, and as they will answer the contrary at
their uttermost perils. And this Our Proclamation We require the high Sheriff
of that Our County to cause to be read in all Churches and Chappells within the
same; That notice of this Our Pleasure may be taken by Our Subjects, and speedy
Obedience given thereunto. And We require that Our high Sheriff to search the
Houses of all such of Our Subjects, as he shall have cause to suspect to
conceal such Arms as aforesaid, and to seize the Arms and Persons of all
such, who upon search and examination, shall appear to have been disobedient
to this Our Command.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, this fourteenth day of December, in the
Eighteenth year of Our Reign.
God save the King.
