A Copy of Verses delivered to a Minister of the Church of England, whilst he
was Officiating the Divine Service of Thanksgiving, Appointed by His Majesty,
September the 9th. 1683.
YOU Hypocrites leave off your Pranks,
To Murder Men, and then give Thanks,
Forbear your Tricks, pursue no further;
For God accepts no Thanks for Murder.
An Answer written on Sight, by a Loyal Hand.
YOU damned Phanatiques, leave off your Cants;
You never shall pass for Protestants.
Though CHARLES the Father you did Murder,
Forbear the Son, and Plot no further.
Leave off your Damned Associations,
Your Solemn Leagues and Protestations:
So long as God your Tricks defeat,
Our Daily Thanks We Will Repeat.
LONDON, Printed by J. Redmayne, for William Battersby at Thavies Inn Gate in
Holborn. 1683.
