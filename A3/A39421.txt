Charles R.
RIGHT trusty and welbeloved, and Trusty and welbeloved, We greet you well.
We are informed that there are several persons who go under the name of
Quakers, or other names of separation, now in the Gaols for London and
Middlesex, for being at unlawful Assemblies, who yet profess all Obedience and
Allegiance unto Us. We would be glad that all Our Subjects could be brought to
agree in an Uniform Worship of God; and We hope that the foresight of the
Dangers which they run into by a wilful contempt of the Laws, and Our
present indulgence, may prevail with some of these persons, to reduce them to a
better Conformity: And therefore We do willingly lay hold of this time and
occasion of public Joy for the first coming of Our dear Consort the QUEEN to
Our Royal Palace at Westminster, to Declare this Our Royal pleasure unto you,
That you cause all such of the said persons in Our Gaols for London and
Middlesex, who have not been Indicted for refusing the Oath of Allegiance, nor
shall appear to you to have been Ringleaders or Preachers at their Assemblies,
to be enlarged.

Given at Hampton Court this 22th day of August. 1662. By His Majesty's
Command. Edward Nicholas.

To Our Right trusty and welbeloved and to Our Trusty and welbeloved the Lord
Mayor of London, and others our Commissioners and Justices for the
Jail-deliver of Oier and Terminer and of the Peace in Our City of London and
County of Middlesex.
Printed by James Flesher, Printer to the Honorable City of London.
