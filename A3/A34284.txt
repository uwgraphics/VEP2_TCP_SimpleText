A Congratulary Poem On the most Illustrious WILLIAM HENRY Prince of Orange.
HAIL, Mighty Prince, by whose preventing Hand
The threatened Pillars of our Albion stand!
Hail wondrous Man! that could without a Blow,
Retrieve lost Freedom, and new Life bestow,
(Such are the Blessings which to thee we owe.)
And sure such wondrous Cures thus wrought by the Command.
Entitle thee, The Savior of the Land.
From Fears and Jealousies we now are free,
From Bonner's Logic and Divinity;
England her Faith's Defender sees in Thee.
A William 'twas did England first subdue,
The second Victor of the Name is You:
But with these happy Odds, he used the Sword;
You came, and knew to conquer with a Word.
But on, the glorious Work is but as yet half done,
Consummate, Hero, what thou have begun.
Write, write at length thy Name, and then advance;
A HENRY too it was that conquered France.
Auspicious Names! how justly are ye joined,
To consecrate this Hero to Mankind.
Excellent Prince! how justly may thou claim
All Honors, Praises due unto thy Name.
Tremble ye Walls of Conquest the strongest City of Normandy, taken by Henry
the 5th, when he conquered France.
Conquest at the sound,
A Henry 'twas first razed you to the Ground.
How will that Monarch's Ghost be joy'd to see
The Ball young Henry lost, rebound to Thee!
On then, Victorious Prince! and may thou prove
Successful there in Arms, as here in Love.
FINIS.
