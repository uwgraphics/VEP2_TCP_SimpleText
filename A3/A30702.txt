LONDON, Printed for Will. Thackeray at the Angel in Duck-Lane, Anno Dom. 1682.

TO THE Honorable and worthy Gentleman, Sir Charles Hoghton of Hoghton, in
LANCASHIRE, Baronet; Grace and Peace.
SIR,
THE Price that Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. 1.
that famous Divine, did set upon all his Athenian ^earning (wherein he greatly
^xcelled) was no other, but only ^his; That he had something of Worth to esteem
as nothing, in ^omparison of Christ: Herein imi^ating the Example of St. Paul,
^ho, though he profited in the ^ewish Religion above many o^^ers, yet when the
Son of God ^as Revealed in him, Gal. 1.14.16. Phil. 3.8.
laid it all ^de as Loss and dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of
Christ Jesus his Lord. And it was the Devout Profession which St. Austin once
made of himself, Confess. lib. 3. c. 4.
when speaking of the great delight which he took in Cicero's Hortensius (as
containing a most liberal Exhortation to the love of Wisdom, without any bias
or partiality toward Sects) he affirms, that the heat of this his Delight
was by this only Reason abated, because there was not in that Book to be found
the Name of Christ; without which Name, nothing (though otherwise never so
polite and elaborate) could wholly possess those Affections which had been
trained up to a nobler study. The consideration of which Sacred Affections in
those holy men, and the like in all such, who are principled with the like
precious Faith and Grace, (so as the Loadstone upon their Affections is (as
Bucer used to say that) Aliquid Christi) is undoubtedly the strongest Motive
and Encouragement, emboldning many Persons beyond their proper Inclination, and
inviting them to the Publishing of those Papers, which otherwise might have
been shut up and smothered in the confused rubbish of a private Closet. So much
of Encouragement is contributed unto Christian Labors, from a faithful and
ready acceptance of them. Who amongst men, but under a due reflection upon
themselves, must needs be conscious of their insufficiency, especially in
matters of such Import, for which the Apostle implies None to be suffificient?
2 Cor. 2.16 and 2 Cor. 3.5.
The sense whereof could not but shut a man up in silence, did not the
consideration of that Christian Candor, and Love to the least Glimpse of Truth,
wherewith gracious Hearts are endued on the one part; and a desire to help in
the building of the spiritual Temple on the other part, bear a man out beyond
his proper temper and inclination, especially in an Age wherein Critical
Censure holds an universal judgment.

1 Timothy 3.16.
Great is the Mystery of Godliness; great also is that Natural Blindness that
is upon the hearts of men; and those who are Enlightened, 1 Cor. 13 9
they see but in part, and know but in part: and if but in part, then there is
a part they do not know. In which respect, the best may truly take up the
Apology of that good Father, Si nihil aliud profecerim, saltem Socraticum illud
habeo, scio quod nescio.

SIR,

The many Experiences of your Abundant Favors, and of your Family, and free
Expressions of Love toward me, have not only obliged, but emboldened me to
Prefix your Honored Name before these poor Pieces of my Labors in God's
Church. Other Argument in these Papers there is none to procure either your
Honors View or Patronage, than this One (which that good Father could not find
in all the Writings of Plato and Cicero) That they have for the Subject of
them, the Discovery of the emptiness and insufficiency of all Creature
Comforts, and Worldly Enjoyments, as to the true, satisfactory, and saving
Enrichment of the Soul: and this in order to the advancement of the Kingdom,
and good Things of that high and holy Person, the knowledge of whom is not only
our Greatest Learning, but our Eternal Life.

In this Confidence I have presumed to present these Papers to your Honor, as
a Public Testimony of my most Humble Duty: And that I might with most Hearty
Prayers Commend you and yours to the Good of God's Chosen; Psa. 106.5.
^^d after a Plentiful Enjoyment of the Blessings of Life here, to the full
Fruition of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light Col. 1.12.
hereafter. Now that God may be the Strength of your Heart, and your Portion
for ever, is the unfeigned desire of

Your Honors Beneficiary In all humble Observance, SETH BVSHELL.

TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,
THe Ensuing Treatise is the Substance of several Sermons under some
Abridgments, though not altered as to their Method. Our Lot is fallen, I must
confess, into a forward age, wherein men are rash for, and ripe in censure: and
usually those who are least able to judge, we find to be most free in passing
sentence. I know, from what I daily see, that some will presently be ready,
upon the first view, to spend a puff of breath, in some sudden and undigested
Quaere; as, to what purpose is this? Why this Subject? Why in this Form? To
such, and this Preposterous Frame I shall only say, That we live in an Age
that is over Squeamish, whose Nauseous Frame, through sin and faction is so
indisposed, that let Divine and Sound Truths (thoug^ in what Mould soever cast)
be presented, they shall scarcely find acceptance. Sin has filled our Stomachs
with bad Humors, and wholesom^ food will not be digested. We are loath to stay
by Truth, till it take hold of us: only with Pilate, if we have any, they are
some sudden flashing Quoeres about it, as, what is Truth? Joh. 18.38
And then we turn aside. Exceptions enough Treatises of this Nature shall meet
withal from men of the World, as to matter, manner, words, form, method. This
say some is too flat, others too sharp: This too high, that too low: This too
plain, that too polite: Here is too short, there is too long: Here too concise,
there it is tedious. Thus all men almost, as to the Books they meet with, pass
a d fferent Censure, according to the several sense they have of things, and
their various fancies. Jam. 4.10. Psalm. 25.9.
All become Judges of the Law: but the meek humble-hearted learners, to whom
the promise is made of being taught, are but a very few. As it was in our
Saviors time, so it is now, men are hardly gained. Though there is no net
comparable to that of the Gospel, as ordered and fitted in all Respects to
take; yet the men of this World have their cunning shifts to evade it, and
cheat themselves by misconstructions into ruin. Let John come to them in the
way of righteousness, in the most Austere, Abstemious, and Severest way of
living, and they say, ^at. 11.18, 19. and 21.32.
he has a Devil. Let the Son of Man come eating and drinking, and they say!
Behold, a man gluttonous, and a Winebibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.
The Children of this World will neither be Piped into a Dancing Frame, Mat.
11.17.
nor Mourned into a Lamenting Temper. Oh, how wayward men are, and hard to be
won! What subtle shifts have they found out, and thereby only to Gull their
Souls into Eternal ruin? Let the Law be expounded, and the Sins therein
forbidden, and Duties Commanded, urged home upon the Conscience, then you shall
have men start aside like broken bows. These (say they) are hard sayings, who
can hear them? Oh, say they, here is nothing to be heard but Hell and Damnation,
and a heavy Yoke, and grievous Burdens, which to take up, and bear, there is
neither delight nor pleasure. You shall find them to be of the same Temper with
those the Prophet mentions, for (after you have done all you can) they will
hold fast their deceit, refusing to return. Jer. 8.5.
Let the Gospel in its excellency and beauty be presented to them, and the
good things of the Kingdom of Heaven never so freely tendered thereby to win
them over, and gain them to Christ, so as the Word seems to stream out Milk and
Honey: yet they would rather dye in their Sins, Joh. 8.24.
than believe and be saved. So true is that mournful complaint of our Savior
over a disobedient, and gainsaying people, Joh. 5.40. Luke 13.34.
Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life: for though I would have
gathered you together, as a Hen does gather her brood under her wings, yet ye
would not.

Hence it may well be said, that there can be but small Hopes of doing much
good either by speaking or writing. What then? Shall any, who are entrusted
with a talent, hide it in a Napkin? Luke 19.20
Shall Mortal Man be more wise than God, or shall he confront the Wisdom of the
Almighty? The Lord Commanded Ezekiel Ezekiel. 37.4 Mat. 3.9.
to Prophecy upon dry bones: and the same God is able of stones to raise up
Children unto Abraham. How easy is it for him that made the Heart, to new
mould it; and to take away the stony Heart, and to give an Heart of Flesh?
Ezekiel. 36.26. Act. 17.26.
And since he has determined the times before appointed, which are so ordered
by his overruling Providence, as may be most Conducent to his own Glorious
Ends: therefore it is an excellent Piece of Christian Prudence, as well as Duty,
to employ our selves, and la^ out the Talents we are betruste^ with, on a good
design, and to acquiesce in his Dispensations, leaving the Issue to the Lord
his blessing. This is, according to that of the Prophet to sow beside all
Waters, Isa. 32.20. And, as the wiseman directs, to cast our bread upon the
Waters. Eccles. 11.1.
Let Us not dispute, neither curiously enquire, What this Man shall do? Or what
the other? How this will take? Or how the other? What will become of this? Or
what the other? But let us labor to acquaint our selves with the Kingdom of
God, and sincerely exercise our selves in the Duties of that Kingdom, and this
will be Peace in the end. We have a Word for it. Mark the perfect Man, and
Behold the upright: for the end of that Man is Peace, Psalm. 37.37.

Briefly, Reader, from the Nature of this discourse, and plainness ^f its style
(which I have endea^oured) agreeable thereunto, thou ^ayest percieve, that the
design ^hereof is not, by a neat Couch of Words, either to feed an aerie fan^y,
or to blandish an itching hu^or: but its intent is to do thy ^oul good, and
really to settle it upon that better Portion; the good things whereof are such,
as shall never be taken away from thee.

Thine in all Christian Duty and Service, Seth Bushel.

THE Worldly Portion.
LUKE 16.25. Son, remember that thou, in thy lifetime, receivedst thy good
things.


CHAP. I. Containing the Drift and Scope of the Parable, with the Observations
from the Words.
Sect. I.
THe Scope and Drift of our Savior Christ in this Parable, begun Verse 19, is
to be ga^hered, not from the precise con^^deration of any particular part
^hereof, but from a survey of the Series of the whole in genera^ in the which
yet we find the be^ thereof chiefly and principal^ inclining toward, and so
man be resolved into, these six part^culars: which put together (...) sum up
the whole.

First, To show the vanity (...) confidence reposed in world^ things, or the
placing our fel^ city in the enjoyment of the things of this present life. Wh^^
more of the good things he^ below could the rich man ha^^ desired, to have
rendered h^ condition happy? what mo^ could he have wished to feli^tate his
estate? who had his be^ly filled with the best, to an ove^ flow; his body
clothed in t^ richest array: his Coffers stor^ with a stock of rich Provisio^
for the future: and a large R^venue to perpetuate the felici^^ of his
Posterity: and so mig^^ say to his Soul in the langua^^ of the world, Soul,
take thi^ ease. And yet we see, he w^ truly miserable in the midst of all: for
ere long (if not that night) the fool's Soul was required of him. Luke 12.19,
20.


Secondly, It is sometimes the lot of those that fear God to be miserable, and
afflicted in this present World. Though no good thing is wanting to them, the
which is not supplied some other way: yet many of those which are accounted the
good things of this life, they may seem to stand in need of, and their worldly
supplies are but mean and low. Yet under such despicable outsides there lies a
treasure of more worth than all the world: And under such their contemptible
appearances, there is a jewel and grain, which God will own, as his, in the day
when he makes up his Jewels: Mat. 13.30 Mal. 3.17.
and gathers the wheat into his barn.

Thirdly, That such as are in misery, and afflicted in this world are not to be
contemned, but compassionately dealt withal. They, to whom God ha^ given of the
good things of this life to enjoy, Phil. 4.14. Isa. 58.7. Job 31.17.
are to communicate with their afflictions; and not t^ hide themselves from
their own flesh. They are not to eat their morsel alone, but (with Job) to
impart it to the needy. For whos^ has this world's good, and sees his brother
have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the
love of God in him? 1 John 3.17.

Fourthly, That the Torments of hell are unsufferably grievous, extended to the
uttermost height and pitch that a creature in Being, and without annihilation,
can undergo: They are adequately suited to the uttermost of what an immortal
soul can bear, or suffer. O! the howling, and orying, and gnashing of teeth
there, where mercy is not to be found, in the grant of one drop of water on the
fingers tip to cool the tongue. There the day of patience is no more, to wait
upon the sinner, as here, with a when shall it once be? Jer. 13.27.
And How long? Jer. 31.22. But Justice is then let loose, and at large with the
scourge of wrath, to revenge the quarrel of abused mercy, and to vindicate the
glory of a despised Covenant.

Fifthly, That out of Hell there is no delivery; no redemption from this grave.
The condition, into which man enters, when launching out of this world into the
depth of eternity, whether of weal, or woe, it is a fixed state; there is no
change thereof. A delivery from torments (the portion of the damned) is not to
be expected: neither is a plucking out of Abraham's bosom, or the Fathers hand,
(the inheritance of the faithful) to be feared, John 10.29.

Sixthly, The Voice of God in the Scriptures, and by his Messengers is now to
be hearkened, and attended to in this present life, in order to the life to
come: the which if it be neglected by us, there is no expecting Apparitions
from the dead to call us to repentance: which (if yet they were to be had)
would nevertheless prove ineffectual to that end; if the witness of God in his
Word be not embraced by us. The Word of God is of more efficacy to work upon,
and convert the heart, than if one should arise from the dead to Preach unto
us. It is God's Ordinance, and has the virtue of a Divine Institution for such
an end going with it. Whereas for the dead to arise, and speak unto us, there
is no such Institution; the which if it were miraculously granted upon trial,
yet it would not avail; for expressly our Savior tells us, That, if we hear not
Moses, and the Prophets, neither would we be persuaded though one rose from the
dead.

There are diverse other particulars that lie sententiously couched in, and
which the parts of the Parable, under a precise and narrow consideration, may
seem to offer: Parabolae non urgenda sunt verba, and circumstantiae, sed scopus.
But as similitudes are not to be stretched, beyond their proper intent: so in
all Doctrines to be founded thereon, there is an especial respect to be had to
the Analogy of Faith, and the general Rules of Scripture; according to which
the true Exposition of all Parables is to be made: and what is otherwise is to
be rejected as spurious, forced, or imposed. In things of this nature that Rule
of the Schools is no less true, than ancient; In illis quae Metaphorice
dicuntur, non oportet accipere similitudinem secundum omnia. It is too evident
how much the Church of God has been burdened, and the truth obscured by errors,
through the fancies of men, working upon parables, and similitudes, and thence
endeavoring to draw conclusions, whereon to bottom and found their unsound
Opinions, or patronize their corrupted practices. How many (neglecting the main
drift of Parables, Allegories, and Metaphors, as if they did per omnia
quadrare) have dared to found on them such Paradoxes, and thence such Heterodox
Notions have proceeded, Theologia symbolica non est argumentativa.
as through custom in process of time, have had the reception as of Articles of
Faith, and truths Canonical; when as the firmest bottom whereon they are built,
have only been some parabolical Expressions, or from Allusions in some general
Metaphors and Similitudes, which yet are not in the least of their properly
intended scope and aim? In illis quae Metaphorice dicuntur, non oportet
accipere similitudinem secundum omnia. Regula Scholasticorum.
Parables have their circumstantial accessaries interlarded in order to the
carrying on their main design, and so to render their principal drift the more
perspicuous. Of which sort in this Parable there are not a few to be found: any
of which, if strained beyond ^he principal bent, will make the similitude bleed.

Sect. II.
But to the Words, and the subject Matter principally designed in the reading
of them; with their genuine scope and purport: Son, remember that thou, in thy
lifetime, receivedst thy good things.

The words are part of Abraham's return to the desire of the rich man in
torments. Who, in his lifetime, had of Drinks choice, and sorts of Wines; but
now could not get a drop of Water to cool his tongue. Whose days were then
spent in pleasure, but now all is night, and darkness, and utter torment with
him. Who then did but ask, and had it; the comforts of the creature were at his
beck: but now he may earnestly beg and crave, and yet the least of comforts is
denied. The time of hi^ good things is over, and so Abraham tells him, Son,
remember, etc*

He calls him [Son,] a sweet compellation sometimes, but here of a general
import. A Son, but how? not a Son of believing Abraham, who died in impenitency
and unbelief; nor a Son of God, who had not the seed of God in him, as born of
him, or as united to his Son; nor a Son of the Church, which he never owned as
Mother, nor the Members thereof as Brethren; for then he would have been more
kind to Lazarus: But a Son in general, or of wickedness, as David has it, Psalm.
89.22. or a foolish Son, as Solomon does express it, Prove. 17.25. or an unwise
Son, Hos. 13.13. or (...), a Son of perdition, as our Savior speaks of Judas,
John 17.12. But the term may seem rather to note the sweet and heavenly temper
of the Speaker, than any way to express the condition of ^he person, to whom it
is applied.

Remember] i. e. call to mind the days of old, and what formerly thou have
enjoyed, and ^^t not the present sense of just pain and torment take away the
^emembrance of that delight and pleasure which sometimes thou did enjoy.
Think of the plea^ant sweet that is bypast, which ^n a sort was as full and
large, as now thy pain and sufferings. Thou have had thy good things already.

Thy good things.] What were ^hey? Even what was desirable ^o satisfy fleshly
lusts; so as neither the heart was withheld from any joy, but the reins at
large given to it, to run its course with a full career, nor any pleasant
object wanting. Lust ran which way it would without restraint, and enjoyed at
large what it did desire without abatement. And this in

Thy lifetime.] i. e. whilst thou wast in the other world, which was the time
of living. The world wherein thou now art, it is thy time of dying; but so,
that it is ever a doing, but never done, since the death thereof it is eternal.
Whilst thou were alive in the other world, all thy lifetime there thou
receivedst thy good things, which were confined to the time of that life. But
now that life being ended, there is an end so put unto all those good things,
and all other good things too, as thou art never to expect them any more.

The Words under this explication clearly present their proper drift and
purport. And also from them may be collected diverse particular Observations,
which as so many several Heads of Fruit do arise and grow out of the particular
Branches of the Text. And they are such as these. -- As,

1st. From that Term or Appellation [Son] we may Note, The sweet temper, and
blessed frame Jude 9. 1 John 4.7, 8.

2ly. From the title given to the things of this present life, the blessings
and comforts thereof are called [good things.] Hence Note, That the Mercies and
Blessings of [good things.] Though they are often, through the corruption of
man's heart, abused; yet in themselves considered, they are good things, Josh.
23.14. Job 22.18.

3ly. In that these good things are said to be [received] hence Note, That all
the Blessings and Enjoyments [received] as given to us. They are not merely
gotten by us, as of our own work; but chiefly dispensed unto us, as of God's
mercy, Deuteronomy. 8.17, 18.

4ly. In that it is said [thy good things:] the which he called so, and did
appropriate to himself, as his own. Hence we may Note, Hos. 12.8. It Is the
Tempters language of old, whereby he prevails to captivate and ensnare the
wicked, [The world and the glory of it is mine, and if thou will worship me,
all shall be thine, Luke 4.6, 7.

5ly. In that it is said [in thy ^ife-time] hence Note, That the good things of
this present Eccles. 11.7, 8.

6ly. From the word [remember] thence we may observe, That the wicked, though
now they Rev. 20.12, 13.

7ly. Lastly from the Words under an entire consideration, yet with some
reference had to some of the peculiar Notes foregoing, this general Observation
may be offered, and which, in a genuine and proper manner also from the whole
contexture, does arise,

This Seventh and last Point is laid as the Subject and Foundation of this
ensuing Treatise: and the main that is intended to be insisted on. But before
we enter upon it, there lie some Queries in the way, which seem to start out of
this Scripture, and require a word at least in transcourse.

CHAP. II. Containing an Answer to some Queries which are briefly touched, as
offering themselves on the by.
Sect. I.
Quer. WHether there be any Society or Intercourse of ^ommunion betwixt the
Celestial and ^nfernal Inhabitants, or the Blessed and Damned Spirits, which
^his Parable may seem to hold forth, and accordingly has been alleged ^s a
choice Pillar for the upholding such a Tenent?

Answ. Thereto it is answered, verse 26.) quashes the force of ^uch a fancy.
Isa. 63.16.
If Abraham be ignorant of his Seed here upon earth, and Israel do not
acknowledge them, as the Prophet tel^ us, then much less do the ble^sed Saints
and Patriarchs co^verse or treat with the Damne^ Souls, so as to acquaint the^
either with their conditions i^ bliss and happiness: or to receive a report
from them o^ their wretched state in woe an^ torment. Therefore we are t^ look
upon the Parable in i^ main drift and scope, and i^ what it aims at, and not to
endeavor an establishing of Doctrines thereupon, not only t^ the perversion of
a part thereon from its genuine purport, bu^ the subversion of the Doctrine and
Analogy of the true Chr^stian Faith, and the Souls tha^ are builded thereupon,
as b^ many Arguments might be evi^ced in Scriptures and in the Writings of the
Fathers at larg^ laid down.

Sect. II.
Quere, How are the good things which the wicked in this present li^^ (...)
enjoy, said to be their own? ^here they are called [thy good ^ngs.]

Answ. We are not to look ^on the men of the world as ^er usurpers for what
they ^fully get in the world, as if ^^ey were to answer merely for ^^eir using
what they have, as ^t having a right to use. True ^s, they shall answer for
their ^t right using; but they shall ^t answer for their right to use ^^at
which they have lawfully ^tten in the World. There is ^right unto things upon
diverse ^counts, by which they may be ^d to be our own.

1. A right from justice, when ^e can lay claim to things upon ^e account of
justice, and say ^^at's mine own, upon the ac^^unt of justice, it is due unto ^e
by the rules of justice. Thus ^e good things of this life no ^an of himself can
lay claim ^to as his own.

2. There Is a right from Creation; God gave to man a rig^^ to things at his
first Creation* He gave him to be Lord over a^ the Creatures by Sea and Land He
set him over the works of h^^ hands, and put them in subjecti^^ under his feet.
He made hi^ Vicegerent under him through out the whole Universe. The by
Creation he had a right to a^ the good things of this prese^ life. But this is
lost by sin, an^ with a fiery flaming Sword, Man (being expelled and driven out
is hindered from returning to h^ Paradise of Pleasure, his fo^mer Sovereignty
under Go^ over the Creatures. And the his right by Creation's gone.

Psalm. 8.6.
3. There is a right by promise. God has now promise to give good things unto h^
people; and those who are interested in the promises have (...) right to these
good things. No^ this right the wicked cannon plead, they have no interest i^
Christ, in whom All the promise^ (...) God are Yea and Amen, 2 Cor. (...) 20.
and so can have no inter^t in the promises, and there^^re not a right by virtue
of the ^romise to the good things of ^is life. This is the peculiar ^riviledge
and plea of true be^evers.

But 4ly. There is a right from ^onation. God is pleased to ^^ve to wicked men:
his boun^y is extended toward them in ^he large distribution and dole ^f
outward things. Cum quis propter nullam aliam causam donat, quam ut libertatem
and munificentiam exerceat; haec proprie Donatio appellatur. Julian. D. de
Donation. lib. 1.
But their right to hold is but (...) this manner; even as a ^an that is
condemned to ^ye for some notorious Crime, and there being a ^^ttle reprieving
for two ^r three days before his ^xecution, the Prince, out of his ^ndulgence
and grace, gives or^er to have provision made for ^im according to his quality,
that if he be a Gentleman, he shall have such provision; if a Knight, a
Nobleman, a Peer of the Realm, he shall have pr^sion according to his qua^ till
his execution. Now no (...) can say, this man usurps, tho^ he has forfeited
all his righ^ his land and estate, yet if King will give him this refr^ment, he
is no usurper. Bu^ is a poor right he has, its a ri^ from donation. And thus
(...) gives to the ungodly men in (...) world: they have a right outward
comforts, but thi^ all the right they have. (...) have your good things, but
(...) see how you hold them, and (...) on what account they are cal^ your own.

Or otherwise, but more (...) properly the good things the wi^ed do enjoy in
this present (...) may be said to be their own, fr^ the endeared affection and
lo^ they bear unto them; the souls are bound up in them, (...) in the bundle of
life, and the know no other, no better goo^ for in them is lodged their A^
Moreover they look upon themselves as having the first, and ^rime interest in
them, and that ^n the highest manner of right ^hey belong unto them, as if
^here were none above them, ^or Lord over them, from whom ^hey hold, Psalm.
12.4. And thus ^hey entitle themselves to the good things of this present life,
and hold and account of them as their own.

Sect. III.
Quer. Whether in another world there be any remembrance of the things that
have passed in this: or that all whatever was done, had, or suffered in this
present life, be then forgotten?

Answ. Though the joys of Heaven be infinitely great and glorious, and the
spirits of just men made perfect be swallowed up in the beatifical vision of
the Almighty, yet the powers and faculties of the Soul which are essential
thereunto, are so far by that glory from being destroyed, that they are thereby
heightne^ and quickened, and made more spiritually active and vigoro^^ in a
blessed way. The unde^standing perfectly clear; the w^ freely and perfectly
obedie^tial; the memory purged from that dross and corruption which rendered it
too oblivious and i^ retentive of good things, fr^quently keeping in the dros^
but letting go the purer metta^ But now all this good is brough^ to
remembrance, and the contemplation thereof with no little joy affecting the
soul. What ca^ we say, but that in glory all the powers of the soul are
perfecte^ in an holy way? The work o^ grace in holiness here begun, i^ there in
glory full completed wherein all the faculties of the soul are concerned. And
as for the torments of the damned though they be great, even t^ perfection, and
such wherei^ the smallest mercy (even the lea^^ drop of water to cool the
tongue) cannot be granted, yet the Es^ence and Being of the soul is not
destroyed therein, and therefore neither are the powers and ^aculties thereof
(which are es^ential thereto) taken away. Well were it for those damned ^pirits
if those torments would ^tterly consume their substance, and, through some
annihilating ^ower, reduce them to non enti^^es back again; for so their
tor^ents would come to an end, (...) the making an end of them. ^ut that cannot
be, for their ^mmortal substance runs parallel ^ith eternity, and so is capable
^f eternal torments. And fur^er, that which adds to the ^rievousness of their
torments, is ^^e remembrance they have of ^rmer things, and those passed (...)
their lifetime in this present ^orld. As whatever may tend (...) make the
condition of the ^essed more happy, is remem^ed by them; so whatever may
^gravate the misery of the damned comes up upon the^^ minds in a fresh return.
O^ the sad aggravations they ly^ under! when they remember the Mercies they
have enjoyed; the blessed means they have neglected; the precious time they
have misspent; the opportunities the^ have lost; the patience the^ have abused;
the motions a^^ waitings of grace they ha^^ slighted; the precious bloo^ they
have trampled under foot the Covenants they have broken; the resolutions they
have altered from; the many Sermon calls to repentance they ha^^ stopped their
ears against; the sin they have chosen; the goo^ Master they deserted; the b^
Lord they sold themselves unt^ the happiness they have los^ which once was
offered to them and the torments they have no^ cast themselves into, to all
ete^nity, which in time they mig^^ have avoided. Surely the r^membrance of
these and t^ like must needs so aggravate the ^orments of the damned, and
cruciate their minds with such exquisitely-vexatious torture, as shall
equalize, if not exceed, their other torment. Now this way ^o glorify it self
upon them, ju^tice would be deprived of, were their memories in Hell
extinguished. And therefore, Son, ^saith he) Remember that thou, in ^hy
lifetime, receivedst thy good things.

Thus having done with the Queries that are obvious from ^he Words, the subject
Matter ^f our Discourse, and Observa^ion principally aimed at, (unto which what
is said, is but premised, as making way,) now ^ollows, to be more largely (ut
^x proposito) insisted on.

CHAP. III. The Subject Matter of the ensui^ Treatise laid down, and offere^ in
several parts, in order to methodical procedure therein.
THe Subject now lying before us, and which is the pri^cipal Scope of the
Discourse e^suing, we laid down and offere^ in the Seventh Observation before
mentioned, in these words viz.

That there are a Generation (...) Men to whom God grants t^ enjoyment of some
good thin^^ only in this present life, whi^^ ended, after that they shall ha^
no more. Here Is their All good that ever they are like enjoy. In the handling
of this Poin^ that we may more fully sift o^ the Matter in it, and more o^
^erly step from one part thereof unto another: and in that the ^nvailing of a
Method; and ^eering the course designed in ^he entreating on a Subject from ^^l
corrupt and self-reserved-pro^edure, has always been judged ^ more advantageous
way; therefor, that we may more readily ^old on our course, not let ^y the
bar of intricacy in the ^anner of the discourse, we shall ^onsider the whole
under these ^articulars: 1. View some Examples recorded in Scripture of such
men, who have had all their good in this present life. From whence the truth of
the Assertion is in general evinced to us. Chap. IV.

2. We shall enquire into the Reasons, Why God will give good things to the
wicked in this present life? Why there is such a large dole of outward Mercies
sometimes given to them? Chapter V.

3. Show that all the good thing they do enjoy are confined to thi^ present
life; so as when their life ends, all their good is a^ an end, if it end not
before Chap. VI.

4. We shall examine what the condition of such men is, who have all their good
in this present life* with respect to the nature of the good things that they
do here enjoy, Chap. VII.

5. Endeavor to mark out, so fa^ as we can, (being guided by the Notes of Holy
Scripture) wh^ that man or woman is, that, i^ such a condition, is like to have
all their good in this present life Chap. VIII.

6. Conclude the whole in some Uses, and Improvements, in order to a Spiritual
Advantage, from the premised Considerations; with diverse proper Help^ to a
better Portion, Chap. IX, X, XI, XII.



The Argument that now lies before us, calls for a most serious consideration
from us, for therein is matter of chief concernment to examine our selves about.
As St. Hierom sometimes spoke of that saying, Arise ye dead, and come to
judgment, that it was a dreadful Scripture that sounded continually in his
Ears; he thought he heard a Voice night and day, ever and anon, proclaiming the
same. So may this Scripture (duly considered) strike a trembling into the
heart, and amuse the stoutest spirit; Son, in your lifetime, you had your good
things: Here you have your reward, and after this you are never like to have
any more. Let none separate themselves, or put off this Scripture, as if they
were out of its reach, or that it did not concern them. For before we have
done, you shall find, that (though (true it is) this Scripture may be of nearer
concernment to some, than others, yet) it is of exceeding great usefulness in
the several Notes therefrom, an^ practical Improvements thereabout, unto us all.

CHAP. IV. Containing several Examples recorded in Scripture, of suc^ men who
had all their good thing in this present life.
AS to the first particular proposed in the handling o^ the Point laid down, we
are to take a view of some Examples recorded in Scripture of such persons, who
had all their good in this present life. They did enjoy their felicity here in
this present world. Genesis 27.39.
Had not Esau a goodly portion of outward things? what an ample blessing was
conferred upon him? His Cup did even overflow; His dwelling was the fatness of
the earth, and of the dew of Heaven from above; The Heavens did (as't were)
conspire together ^o distill down a blessing upon Esau, and to make his soil fat
and plenteous. Nay Esau had so much, that he said, He had enough. When his
brother Jacob did present him with a drove of Cattle, to find grace in his
sight, ^ays he, I have enough, my brother, keep that thou have to thy self.
Prove. 30.15.
Genesis 33.9. (...). Arist. Polit. l. 1. c. 9.
How far ^oth Esau outstrip all the Worldlings of our days, who are as the
daughters of the Horseleech, crying, [Give, ^ive,] and never say it is enough.
Brother, says he, I have enough: most rich men are complaining; they go not so
far as Esau; they have their Portion, and yet com^lain: Now Esau has his
Por^ion, and thought he had enough.

What a Portion had Nabal of the good things of this life? 1 Samuel 25.2.
He was very great upon the account of his possessions; and blessed himself in
his abundance and yet this man, void of humane courtesy, for he was chu^lish;
ver. 14, 21.
and of Piety, for he wa^ evil in his doings; and of Pity for he had no
commiseration o^ David in his distress; and o^ Moral ingenuity, for he did no^
know to requite good to them that had done good to him, bu^ railed on David and
his men who had been his benefactors and requited evil for good unt^ them. And
yet we see this man flourished in all abundance, ha^ his belly full of worldly
treasure but this was all the good tha^ ever he was to enjoy, for he wa^ a man
of Belial, verse 25.
Nabal was hi^ name, and folly was with him and before death utterly smot^ him,
his heart died as a ston^ within him, 1 Samuel 25.37, 38.

The Rich man spoken o^ Luke 12. whose grounds brough^ forth so plentifully,
that he ha^ no room where to bestow hi^ fruits, but might ampliate his
Granaries, and enlarge his Buildings, that so he might house ^is plentiful
Crop; surely he had a large portion of these outward things: and they were good
things somewhat adequate ^o his hearts desire too, otherwise he would never
have cheered up his soul in the enjoyment of them, thus saying, Soul, soul,
thou have much goods laid up for many years, take thine ease, eat, drink, and
be merry: (other than which what could he have said, if he had had the soul of
a swine?) Yet these were all the good things that ever he was like to enjoy,
for the Fool's Soul that night was required of him. And that put an end to all
his present hopes of future comfort, Luke 12.20.

You read of a generation of men, Job 22.17, 18. who were so drowned in
sensuality, that they did not only utterly depart from God themselves, but bid
God himself depart from them too and despighted the Almighty, a^ if there were
nothing of goo^ that he could do unto them They said unto God, depar^ from us,
and what can the Almighty do for them? And ye^ (such were the overflowings o^
God's bounty toward them that) he filled their houses wit^ good things: They
had a ful^ portion for a time, but presently they were cut down, out of time
and their foundation was overflow^ with a flood: and so all their good came to
an end, Job 22.16.

Some of Christ's hearers, in Luke 6.24. they had their good things in this
life, Woe unto you for here is your consolation, says our Lord Christ unto
them. Oh* dreadful Speech! Woe to thi^ man, woe to these; here is their
consolation. They have, and may take some comfort in sensual delights here for
a time, but these once ended, they are never to expect any more.

The Psalmist tells us of some ^en who have their portion in his life, and
whose belly God ^lls with his hid treasure, Psalm ^7.14. and they leave the
rest of their substance to their Babes. They have their bellies filled with
outward good things, and ^he surplus thereof they store up ^s a substance for
their Babes. Now all is but a belly-full; it is but as meat for their belly, and
the belly for it, both which God will destroy: 1 Cor. 6.13.
And the men to whom this falls in portion, they are but men of the world, and
so cannot long enjoy these delicious dainties: They are mortals, and so must
yield to the stroke of death, which will put an end both to their life and
portion, after which they shall never enjoy good any more.

God's mercy it is his own, and he will extend the line of it as he pleases.
God so disposes of his mercy, that there are some that shall have Heaven and
Earth to be their portion; an^ their portion is indeed a blesse^ portion. There
are some tha^ shall have earth, but not heaven and their portion is poor, an^
mean, and sad. There are others that shall have heaven, bu^ not earth, and
their portion (...) good: And there are other that shall neither have heaven
nor earth, and their portion (you will say) is miserable indee^ God's mercy is
his own to dispose of as he will, and to le^ out as he pleases, It is your
Fathers pleasure to give you a kingdom Luke 12.32. We read of Jehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 21.3. That he gav^ to his other sons gifts, but the kingdom he gave to
Jehoram So Abraham calls for Ismael an^ Hagar, and he gives them ^ piece of
Bread and a bottle o^ Water, and sends them away There Is an end of them, the^
may go and wander in the wilderness of Beer-sheba, Genesis 21.14 So God has
people to whom h^ gives pieces of bread, and bottles ^f water, yea, some to
whom he ^ives great gifts in this world: ^ut he keeps the inheritance for ^is
Isaac, and the kingdom for ^ehoram. As for the other who ^ave their good in
this present ^^fe, they are as sent away, and may take their portion with them,
for there is their All.

CHAP. V. Containing some Reasons why there is such a large Dole of outward
Mercies given to the Wicked in this present world. And why the Lord is
oftentimes so bountiful toward them.
ALL the Works of God are rationally carried on, I mean there is a spiritual
reason in them; though, because of that darkness that is naturally upon man's
understanding, and so has clouded the discursive faculty of the soul through
sin, he cannon so fully apprehend them, as the^ are truly in themselves. No^
whereas it is the good pleasur^ of the Almighty to give som^times unto the
wicked a larg^ Dole of the good things of the present life, so as they flouri^
in all wealth and store: doub^ less the work of God therein ^ right, and done
in truth, an^ there is ground of such his bounty toward them. Therefore w^
will enquire into the Reason that are more obvious: W^ God will give good
things to the Wicked in this present life? Wh^ there is such a large Dole of
outwar^ Mercies oftentimes shared out (...) those who are Enemies unto Him who
is the Author of every goo^ and perfect Gift? which is the second thing offered
to enquir^ in the handling the Point we a^ upon.

Sect. I.
And first, they are all God'^ creatures, though sin have depraved and
corrupted their na^^res, and rendered them trai^urs and rebels to their Crea^^r,
yet they are God's crea^^res still, though rebellious, ^^ey are the workmanship
of his ^nds, though Satan bear sway (...) their hearts. And upon that ^ry
account, as being his work^anship, God has some respect ^r them, Luke 6.35.
He is kind to the un^^ankful, and to the evil. Though ^^ey have cast him off,
yet he ^es not utterly cast them out ^om all the good things of this ^^esent
life. He owns them as ^s creatures still, who disown ^m as their Lord and
Sovereign. though they will not have him (...) rule over them; yet he cannot
forget the workmanship of ^s hands. Says Jehu, concern^g Jezabel, Go, 2 Kings
9.34.
take away this ^rsed woman, though she be under the execution of the just
^^ntence of God upon her, and (...) liable to the uttermost of re^roach that
can be inflicted, yet show some respect unto her, her not lie there in the
stree^ but take her away: For she i^ kings daughter. So says Go^ Well, though
these be curs^ and fuel only fit for the ev^^lasting burnings, yet they (...)
my creatures, I cannot utte^ (here as yet) forsake the wo^ of mine own hands;
some ^spect they shall have from m^ some good I Will communicate them: they are
men of the wor^ and therefore they shall have belly-full of worldly treasur^
Whose belly thou fillest with the hid treasure, Psalm. 17.14. T^^ deep vein of
silver, and the h^^den place of gold, those sec^ (but rich) recesses shall pow^
out abundantly into their ^^soms: and I Will give them the portion here, and that
beca^ (though but men of the wor^ yet) they are my creatures. B^ it is not an
argument strong enough, that because you a^ God's creatures, therefore y^ shall
have eternal mercies: that ^^cause God is your Creator, ^erefore he will be
your Savior. a peoples title to eternal mer^^es be no more than this, then
(...) to them: For he that made ^m will have no mercy on them, ^d he that
formed them, will show ^em no favor, Isa. 27.11.

Sect. II.
Secondly, The time of this ^e is the time of God's pa^^ence, and the day of
his long-^^fferance: Now God waits, Isa. 30.18.
that (...) may be gracious, and his pa^^ence bears long, suspending ^^dgment.
Romans 2.4.
Now the goodness of ^od is leading men to repentance, ^^m. 2.4. And though the
riches ^his goodness, and forbearance, ^^d long-suffering be despised ^y the
wicked, yet the time of ^^is life is the day of his good^ess and patience
still: And ^erefore the wicked have their ^ercies here. In their lifetime ^^ey
have their good things. God ^nows (Oh that they would consider it) that there
is ^^ternity before them, where to pay them home fully for their sins; Deuteronomy.
32.42.
when there shall be (...) time of revenges upon the enem^ whereof there shall
be a begi^ning, but never end. So as t^^ time of this life being the d^ of
God's patience and lon^ suffering, therefore he deals o^ such a bountiful dole
unto man of the wicked. Says God, (...) him take his fill, and measure (...)
his sin; let him be filthy sti^^ since it is his wilful choice (...) wallow in
his own vomit, a^^ to defile himself in the mire (...) his lusts; I shall not
envy hi^ any the good things of this pr^sent life: psalm. 37.35. Job 21.11, 12,
13.
Let him spread himse^ as a green bay tree. Let him se^^ forth his little ones
like a flock, a^^ let his children dance; let the^ take the timbrel and harp,
and r^joyce at the sound of the organ^ Let them spend their days in wealt^ for
this is the time of my long-su^ferance: but in a moment they sha^ (...) down to
the grave. God's pa^^^nce bears with the wicked ^w, and lets them take this
^orld, and their portion here, (...) as some grow great by oppres^^n, some rich
by rapine, some ^l by fraud, some bigg by bribes, ^hers drunk with pleasures,
^d some swilled with the puffs (...) honor: They wax fat, Jer. 5.28. psalm.
50.21.
they ^ne, yea they overpass the deeds (...) the wicked, they judge not the
use, the cause of the fatherless, ^t they prosper. Thus God in ^^tience (as't
were) overlooks ^^em; and they think that he is ^^together such a one, as they
are ^^emselves: that he never will ^ll them to account, as they ^ever call to
account themselves. ^nt when the time of this long-^^fferance is over, then the
va^^ty of these worldly good ^^ings wherein they did so wan^only bless
themselves will ^ore than sufficiently appear unto them.

Sect. III.
Thirdly, the time of this l^ is the season of God's provide^tial
dispensations, which (thoug^ guided and ordered by an innite wisdom, yet)
promiscuo^ly fall amongst the children (...) men: so as oftentimes the Go^ly
here they have their cup fill^ with wormwood, Jer. 8.14. psalm. 73.14. psalm.
66.11, 12.
and the wa^ of gall given them to drink, T^^^ are plagued all the day long, a^
chastened every morning. They (...) brought into the nest, and afflicti^^ is
laid upon their loins: men r^ over their heads, they go throu^^ fire and water.
All these a^ many more hardships they e^dure, and yet none of the come to pass
without God's pr^vidence: which so orders the they shall be fully tried in the
present life, Luke 22.31 Amos 9.9.
and sifted like as co^ is sifted in a sieve. They ha^ their full dose and
share of gre^ and sore afflictions in this pr^sent life: for here is the time
all the misery, pain, and sorro^ that ever they shall endure, and after this
life all their grief shall ^e at an end. For God shall ^ipe away all tears from
their eyes, Rev. 21.4.
^^d there shall be no more death: neither sorrow, nor crying, neither ^all
there be any more pain; for ^^e former things are passed away. and as povidence
measures out ^^ch a share of this life often^^mes unto the godly; so it yields
(...) contrary portion unto the ^icked; the good things of this ^resent life
fall into their bo^oms, as if the windows of heaven were opened to shour down ^
blessing on them; and the slu^es of hidden (yet but worldly) ^^easure, being
opened, did con^urr by a joint confluence, to ^ake them happy. Their eyes
^^^and out with fatness: they have ^ore than heart could wish, Psalm. ^3.7. And
why? This is the ^ime for an infinitely wise and ^idden providence to exert it
^elf in various dispensations; ^o as no man may know either love or hatred by
all that is before hi^ Eccles. 9.1. The wicked ca^ not hereupon argue that G^^
loves them, because they (...) warm in the Sun of a prosp^rous Estate: neither
may t^^ faithful say that God ha^ them, because his dealings see^ to be so
harsh with them. (...) is no arguing from outwa^^ providential Dispensations
(...) things that are of an etern^^ nature, as God's love and h^tred are. We
should look upon the way of providence he^ to be more occult, and myst^cal,
than that the sense a^^ meaning thereof should so e^sily be discerned; and so
kno^ this, that because now is the time for providence to car^ on its hidden
works, therefore the wicked have such ^ large Dole of outward goo^ things given
to them.

Sect. IV.
Fourthly, Wicked men may ^o somewhat for God here, they ^ay be serviceable in
some re^pect, at least do something that ^aterially is a service, and God ^ill
not be indebted to them. He ^nows they are a mercenary and ^amorous generation,
and that (...) he should not give them wa^es for any service they are em^^oyed
in for him, they would ^^esently clamor on him. Now ^od will not have them
exclaim ^^ainst him, but if possible stop ^^eir mouths, and will give to ^ery
one something for what ^^ey do for him, though it be ^^ver so little, here in
this world. ^e have a notable place for this Ezekiel. 29.18, 19, 20.
Nebuchad^^^zar King of Babylon caused (...) Army to serve a great service
^^^inst Tyrus [every head was ^de bald, and every shoulder was ^ed;] this great
service God (...) him upon, and it seems he (...) not as yet given him wages;
well, God he requires abo^^ this, and seems to complai^ that when
Nebuchadnezzar a^^ his Army had done him such se^vice, yet he should not have
r^ceived his wages, but be, as were, forgotten all this while Therefore, says
God, Beh^ I will give the land of Egypt (...) Nebuchadnezzar king of Babyl^^
and he shall take her multitude, Ezekiel. 29.18.
(...) take her spoil, and take her pr^ and it shall be the wages for (...)
army. I have given him the l^ of Egypt for his labor where^ he served against
it, because (...) wrought for me, says the l^ God. The Lord will not be (...)
debted in the least to any wic^ man for the least service tha^ shall do for
him; nay he is (...) a bountiful Master, that he (...) pay those whom he does
imp^ not only according to the m^ of their service, the pains (...) have
endured, the difficult the work, the success that ensued, nay, take in all the
^cumstantial attendants, and ac^^^sories of their employment, (...) will not
only pay them ac^^rdingly, not abating an Ace, ^s usually said; but, as a
boun^^^ul Lord, he will give more, (...) cause his wages to overflow. ^d
therefore well may the ^cked, who are employed in ^d's service, or at least in
such ^rks which materially are a ^vice, have sometimes a large ^le of outward
Mercies. It Is ^e, the wicked in Scripture, (...) compared to thorns and bri^:
now we know that a thorn ^y serve to stop a gap, though ^e but a thorn-bush,
and if it ^^e to stop a gap, and be of (...) use, it has that benefit by (...)
that all that while the Sun ^es upon it, and it is kept ^m the fire; whereas
were it (...) for use, it might presently brought to the fire. An Ar^ent, by
the way, to provoke men to be of as much use to (...) Church of God as possibly
they can, to stop those gap whereby there might be an in to their harm, or an
occasion their prejudice. It may be t^ is the very thing, for which, yet, thou
art in the sun-shi^ and which keeps thee from fire; but if thou once comel^ be
unuseful, the fire is the (...) thing thou shall hear of. M^ wicked men God
does make of in diverse services; and m^ refreshing and good his Chur^^ shall
have from them: The L^ causes the very earth to help woman, and to swallow up
the (...) cast out of the Dragon's m^ to carry her away: Earthly (...) (not
only as to their frame Being, but as to their mind motions too) are someti^^
made use of for the good of Church: and God will no^ beholding to them for t^
work. 2 King. 10.30.
Is Jehu employed in G^ service against the house of ^hab? It was a work which
(...) had to do, and he put Jehu o^ t^en his children of the fourth ge^^^ation
shall sit on the throne of ^^^ael. If the Kenites show kind^^ss unto Israel
when they come ^t of Egypt, this shall not be ^^^gotten, but shall be
remem^^ed, whilst there is a Kenite. and though Saul be sent to de^oy the
Amalekites, 1 Samuel 15.6.
and the ^nite live amongst them, yet ^ey shall be severed from them, ^ Sam.
15.6. And Saul said unto ^e Kenites, Go, depart, get you ^wn from among the
Amalekites, (...) I destroy you with them: for (...) showed kindness to all the
chil^^en of Israel, when they came (...) out of Egypt. Austin, De Civitat. Dei,
lib. 5. cap. 12.
speak^^g of the Romans that had such (...) flourishing condition for a ^hile,
gives this for one reason, ^hey were Men of Heroic Spi^s, and had excellent
Moralities, ^d were delivered from that base^ss of spirit, that other People
had, ^d therefore God showed some kind (...) respect unto them. Many Instan^s
of the like kind might be gi^^n.

Sect. V.
Fifthly, God gives outw^ things to the wicked in the life; to let the world
see w^ little good there is in all (...) things that are here in (...) world.
The things of this (...) have no great worth in the^ otherwise they would never
so promiscuously cast up a down in the world: It is a gr^ argument against
their wort^ because the wicked have the in such abundance. Certai^ if there
were much good them, they should never ha^ them. It is an argument t^ strength
of body has no gr^ excellency in it; for an O^ has it more than man. An
^^gument, there is no great e^cellency in agility of body, f^ a dog has it
more than man nor in gay clothes, for a Pe^cock has them more than yo^ nor in
gold and silver, for t^ Indians, that know not God, e^joy of that worldly
treasu^^ more than you. And the like ^ay be said of Natural Excel^encies which
are common to ^an with sensibles, and of all ^orldly enjoyments; that surely
^here cannot be any great good (...) them, because creatures of a ^ower worth
have such a fullness ^f them. This might be enough ^o convince us of their
worth^esness, had we no other argu^ents. So likewise on the contrary we may
argue, that surely ^here is no great evil in afflicti^ns in this world, because
the ^earest children of God are of^entimes very sore afflicted, which would not
be, if there ^ere any such great evil in affli^tions, as the world accounts of.
The low esteem that the people ^f God have had of the great things of this
world, argues, that there is little true good in them. What said Luther of the
Turkish Empire, as great as it is? ^ven thus, Turcicum imperium ^uantum quantum
est, mica est quam pater-familias canibus projicit: (...) is no more but as a
crum which the householder throws unto ^ dog. The Almighty sees the things of
this world as worthle^ things comparatively to tho^ of a better life; and
therefore he will venture them amongst the wicked, though he sees they wi^ abuse
them, and not give unt^ him the glory that is due unt^ his great Name from them
Though the wicked corrup^ themselves in them, and be sacrilegious in the
enjoyment o^ them, robbing God of his glo^ry; yet however they are things of no
great worth, and therefore no matter if they have them for a season. As suppos^
you see a man gathering o^ Crabbs under the tree, thoug^ the Swine come
grunting about and take them up, yet he care^ not much to drive them away* they
are but Crabbs, let them have them: But if he were gathering any choice and
preciou^ fruit, if the Swine should come ^ithin the compass, then he ^resently
drives them away. ^o for choice Mercies in Christ ^hen these are dispensed, Oh
^hese are precious Fruit! as ^earls they are not cast amongst ^wine: Matt. 7.6.
Here God makes a di^inction, he expects to have ^ory to his great Name issuing
^om them; and therefore he ^egards whether men be prepa^ed to give him the
glory of them, yea or no; and because ^e will not lose his glory in this
^espect, therefore their hearts ^^all be prepared. But for the ^ommon blessings
of this world, which are but as Crabbs, the lord suffers the Swine of this
^orld to come grunting, and ^o take them up. A Black^mith that works upon Iron,
^^ough a great many Cinders, and little bits of Iron fly up and ^own, he
regards them not: ^ut a Goldsmith that is work^ng upon Gold, he preserves every
ray, every ramentum, a^ dust of gold; he will not lose t^ very filings. A
Carpenter the is only hewing of Timber, (...) regards it not much if Chips
(...) up and down; but a Lapida^ that is working upon precio^^ stones, every
little bit there he is careful to preserve. The^ outward things they are but
(...) Chips and Cinders, or such li^ worthless things, and therefo^ God lets
the wicked of t^ world sometimes of them to e^joy so great a share.

Sect. VI.
Sixthly, The wicked enj^ such fullness of outward thin^ in this life, that
thereby t^ Lord may show what great go^ things he has reserved for (...) own
children. Surely if t^ slaves and vassals fare so we^ it shall go well with the
ch^^dren: if the Master be so go^ and kind to those that are b^ in his family
of Creation, he w^ abundantly express his love and ^odness to those that are in
his ^mily of Adoption. Such shall, ^th the Psalmist, be rapp'd up ^to
admiration, Psalm. 31.18, 19.
O how great is ^y goodness, which thou have laid (...) for them that fear
thee. If ^ose that fear thee not are so ^eat and mighty in the world, ^at they
can and do speak grie^us things, proudly and contemp^usly against the
righteous: If ^ch are so high, and have their ^p so full, then surely the
good^^ss that is laid up for them that ^ar thee must needs be to all ^miration.
True believers may ^ise their hopes about the great ^od things that are in
store for ^em, from the consideration of ^at abundant confluence of out^ard
Mercies which meet upon ^e wicked. And God would ^^ve them to make this, as one
^e of it: and so we see David ^d, Psalm. 73.24, 25, 26. Psalm. 73.24.
The ^rmer part of the Psalm chiefly ^ns upon this Argument, i. e. an
Expostulation with deep re^soning about the prosperity (...) the wicked, which
was very o^vious unto David's eye, and (...) part startling unto his thought^
but when as he become bett^^ informed, and understood some what of this
mysterious cour^ and hidden way of God's dea^ing with them, amongst oth^^

laid down Verse 24. The shall guide me with thy counse^ and afterward receive
me to glor^ If the wicked have such a lar^ measure of worldly wisdom surely I
shall not want thy counsel, says David unto God. they be glorious with their
go^den chains, so as pride compass^ them about as a chain, ver. 6. surly the
glory reserved for t^^ children is exceeding great which after a while they she
be received to. Fugiendum est ad clarissimam patriam, ibi pater, ibi omnia.
Aug. de Civit. Dei.
Thus David i^ferrs and applies to himself (...) particular, Thou shall guide
(...) with thy counsel, and afterwar^ receive me to glory. And mark ^ow the
Psalmist pursues this ^nference in a glorious acclama^ion, Whom have I in
heaven but ^hee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee: My
flesh and my heart fails; but God is ^he strength of my heart, and my ^ortion
for ever. The wicked ^hey have their portion here, and the lines do often fall
to them in pleasant places: Surely then it shall go well with them that fear
God, which fear before him, Eccles. 8.12. The Lord himself he will be their
portion. ^f the Dogs fare so well, the father keeps a good house. If the
hang-bies may have such Doles, certainly there is good provision for the
children within. As by the afflictions that lie upon the Godly in this world,
God does declare to wicked men what fearful Judgments do abode them; and would
have them from thence to argue to their future dreadful state, and the great
evils that are like to befall them; For if judgment begin at the house of God,
what sha^^ the end be of them that obey n^^ the Gospel of God? 1 Pet. 4.17. So
by the prosperity of the wicked in this world, God dot^ declare to his
children, wha^ choice things are reserved for them, and would have them from
thence, to argue to their future happy estate, and the great good things they
shall enjoy.

Sect. VII.
Seventhly, The Lord knows that he has time enough to manifest his Justice
upon the wicked hereafter; Magna Dei ira est, quando peccantibus non irascatur
Deus. Hier. Epist. 33. ad Castrat.
and therefore he will let them enjoy somewhat here. The Lord has an eternity
hereafter for the punishment of the wicked. Their sweet bits shall cost them
dear enough, and their pleasant morsels go down with a sufficiently bitter
sauce. Says God, I have an Eternity for the declaration of my justice in
heaven, and therefore let them have somewhat for a while. As you know it is
natural in all, when they see a man going to Execution, that is not like to
^ive above an hour or two, every one is ready to pity him, and to be any way
officious to him: Oh, Aeternitas ^on est pe^ s^d ratime paenae, sed decidit
propter aeternitatem personae punitae, and culpae remanentis. Scot. in quart.
Sentent. distinct. 46. qu. 4.
(says every one) the Man shall not have comfort long, we cannot do much for
him, he shall have pain enough ever long, and misery enough ever long; and so
every one pities him, and that because his mis^ry is near, and before him. Even
so the misery of the wicked is not far off, it is before them, even a misery
that shall run parallel with Eternity, And therefore, says God, let them
rejoice a while, and let their hearts cheer them in this their day, they have
not long to be merry in, let them walk in the wa^s of their heart, and in the
sight of their eyes; after a while, I will bring them into judgment. Eccles.
11.9. Dan. 5.5, 6.
Surely this Consideration should be like Belshazzar's handwriting upon the
Plaster of the Wall to all wic^ed and ungodly ones, in the midst of their
worldly fulnes^ causing their countenances t^ change, and their thoughts t^ be
troubled in them; and the joints of their loins to be loo^ed, and their knees
to smite on^ against another, to think (O^ could they but lay it to heart!^
that this pleasant life will endure but for a while, these day^ will quickly be
at an end, an^ then they launch out into the miserable gulf of all Eternity
when their torment does begin but shall never end: and tha^ all the good things
of this present life they do enjoy are bu^ indulged them for a season; an^
this, because there is time enoug^ for their misery in Eternal Confinement, yet
behind, to sei^ upon them.

Sect. VIII.
Eighthly, God gives a large ^^rtion of outward Mercies unto ^e wicked in this
life, because (...) takes occasion from hence to ^^ch a great deal of glory to
his ^^n Name. In this way and ^urse of dealing with the wick^, he gains great
glory to him^^^f, in bringing about his own ^ds. As sometimes he does it, ^^at
they might stumble, and ^rden their hearts; How many ^cked men stumble upon the
^ock of their own enjoyments? their table becomes a snare before ^^m: Psalm.
69.22.
and that which should have ^n for their welfare does become ^rap. Psalm. 9.16.
They are snared in the ^rk of their own hands. And ^w are their hearts
hardened ^^rough their fullness, even to ^ch a pitch of hardness, that ^ey are
even as a piece of the ^her millstone? Isa. 8.15.
Though at last ^ey shall be broken by judg^ent, yet by mercies they can^t be
melted. Thus their mercies cause them to stumble and (...) and be b^oken, and
snared, (...) taken. Their mercies freque^^ly work to ripen them in the sins;
and from the pleasant r^ of worldly enjoyments, the grows in them the bitter
f^^ of [ gall and wormwood. Deuteronomy. 29.18.
] (...) wicked suck, as't were, a ju^ from their worldly fullness, wh^ feeds and
ripens them in the sin: Like the Spider, turn^ what she extracts from sweetest
flower into deadly p^^son. Tit. 1.15.
Unto them that are des^ and unbelieving, is nothing pr^ says the Apostle, but
even the mind and conscience is defil^ Hence the Lord lets wicked (...) go on a
long time, till their be fully ripe, and then to glo^^fie his great Name in a
way (...) justice on them, he puts in (...) sickle. So Isa. 33.1. Isa. 33.1.
Woe to t^ that spoilest, and thou wast not sp^ed, and dealest treacherously,
(...) they dealt not treacherously w^ thee; when thou shall cease to sp^ t^ou
shall be spoiled. Thou may on a while, and spoil as thou ^lt, but when thou
have done ^oiling, thou shall be spoiled. ^he King of Assyria may grow, ^ell,
and wax great; he may ^ise himself upon the ruins of ^od's people, but his
heart is ^eed up thereby to his destru^ion: For it shall come to pass, ^en the
Lord has performed his ^ole work upon mount Sion, Isa. 10.12, 16.
and (...) Jerusalem, that he will punish ^^e fruit of the stout heart of the
^ng of Assyria, and the glory of ^s high looks. The Lord of hosts ^ll send
among his fat ones lean^ss, and under his glory he will ^ndle a burning, like
the burning (...) a fire, Isa. 10.12, 16. As the ^ssyrian glorified himself in
the ^esolations of Israel, so will the lord bring about his own ends, ^d
glorify his great Name on ^oud Assyria: As he got him^^lf glory upon the
imperious ^gyptians before (when ripe for ^in) at the red Sea. Z^char. 11.8.
Thus the pride of Assyria is brought done and the scepter of Egypt depar^
away: and the Lord alone is (...) alted in that day, Isa. 2.17. Isa. 2.17.


Sect. IX.
Ninthly, Sometimes the wic^ed prosper in this world, b^come great, and are
mighty (...) power, that so by them Go^ may chastise and correct his ow^
people: And thus the flouris^ing rod of the wicked is la^ upon the lot of the
righteous; Psalm. 125.3.
an^ wicked men are advanced, the they may be as thorns and br^^ers unto God's
People. By the he scourges his own inher^tance. He gives a king in his a^ger,
and after takes him away (...) his wrath, Hos. 13.11. Hos. 13.11.
T^^ Canaanites were left in the lan^ that by them the Lord mig^^ prove Israel,
and they were ^ thorns to prick and grieve the^ Probably many of these wh^ were
thus bitter enemies unt^ Israel were mighty, and prosperous in the world, not
because God loves them, but that ^o they might be the more able, and fitted,
and so employed for ^courges unto his People. God ^ives the wicked such a large
Dole of outward Mercies, not ^ut of his love to them (though ^hey are ready to
gather that Argument) but out of his displeasure toward others. The Lord makes
use of them only ^s a Rod to whip others, where^n when they have served his
design, then the Rod shall be ^ast into the fire, and so burned. Thus the
Prophet speaks of the ^ofty Assyrian, and calls him the Rod of God's anger: and
says, Isa. 10.5.
that when the Lord shall have performed his whole work upon ^mount Sion, then,
under his glory, ver. 12, 16.
he will kindle a burning, like the burning of a fire, and so the rod of
Assyria shall be consumed. The Lord gives his Israel into the hands of the
Egyptians, under sore servitude, for many years, on the side of their
oppressors there Eccles. 4.1.
is power, but they had no comf^^ter: they are afflicted, and strangers serve
under hard bondage, they are in a land that not theirs, and hardly entrea^ed;
all this comes to pass, n^ because the Lord loved the ^gyptians, and hated the
Israelite* No, the Egyptians are only scourge, and as a pricking brie^ and
grieving thorn unto Isra^^ to preserve them in God's fea^ and quicken their
graces, a^^ spiritually raise their hearts, t^ the time appointed, and the that
nation whom they shall serv^ will I judge, (says the Lord Genesis 15.13, 14.) and
afterwa^^ shall they come out with great s^stance. The like might be sa^ of the
great men of Babylon whereof the Prophet Isaiah, ch^ 47.6, 7. and many others
in^ whose hands God has give^ great things, that so they mig^^ thereby be fit
instruments to ca^ry on his design in the scourg^ and chastisement of his
people.

Sect. X.
Tenthly, The Lord gives a ^ge Dole of outward mercies to the wicked in this
life, to ^ch us who profess the know^ge of God, and an interest him (as our
God) to be and (...) like unto him. Is God kind to his enemies? so should we
also unto our enemies. Is so bountiful in his gifts? then ^nce we should learn
to pra^ce those Divine Lessons left on record, and exemplified our Savior
Christ, Luke 6.27, 28, 35, 36.
to love our ^^emies, to do good to them that ^te us; to bless them that curse
(...); to pray for them, which de^^ghtfully use us: and to be merci^^l, as our
heavenly Father is also ^^rciful. Thus shall we be the ^^ildren of the highest,
for he is and unto the unthankful, and to ^^e evil, Luke 6.36. What bet^^r
pattern can be set before us, ^an a pattern from our heaven^^ Father? Whence
can we ^^ke an Exemplar whereon unerringly to build our pract^ but from the God
of truth, (...) whose ways are judgmen^ What more effectual mean^ the
impressing and setting ho^ of practical truths can there (...) than Example
upon Precept, (...) both these given by God h^^self? In that God is thus
bo^^tifully good and liberal to ^ wicked, hence we are to le^^ kindness to our
enemies, and do good, not only humanit^ (as they say) but homini; (...) only to
humane nature, but (...) men, though they act contr^ to us, and be against us.
W^ more against, and enemies un^ God, than the wicked of t^ world, who are dead
in sins, ^ trespasses? and yet we see ho^ bountiful the Lord is unto the^ in
dealing them out such lar^ Doles of outward mercies. O^ let us learn hence to
be like o^ heavenly Father in doing goo^ May not we argue our selv^ from hence
into such a fram^ Surely the design of God herein to teach us to lay aside all
ma^e and envy, and all revenges, 1 Pet. 2.1. Romans 12.19.
^d to overpower our passions ^ a spirit of meekness, and to (...) like God
himself, (whose ^age we bear) in heaping coals (...) fire upon the head of our
foes, (...) being overcome of evil, but ^^ercomeing evil with good, Romans ^.20,
21.

Sect. XI.
Again, The Lord gives such ^arge Dole of outward good ^ngs to the wicked in
this life, ^cause he would have no argu^^nt for love or hatred drawn ^m these
outward things ^^e nature of man is prone to ^her an Argument of love or ^red
from the dispensations (...) providence in this world: ^d herein judges after
the ^h, as if what is pleasing to (...) flesh, and sensual appetite ^uld argue
God's love; and ^at's grievous and burdensome (...) the carnal part should be
an argument of his displeasur^ How frequent are the concl^sions of men in
Scripture-R^cord, according to this hyp^thesis? Thus Rabshakeh argu^ for his
Master Sennacherib again Hezekiah. His Master had be very prosperous and
success in his Martial Undertaking (says he) Has any of the G^ of the nations
delivered his l^ out of the hand of the king of ^syria? Isa. 36.10, 18, 19, 20.
Where are the Gods of h^ math and Arphad? Where are (...) Gods of Sepharvaim?
And h^ they delivered Samaria out of (...) hand? Who are they amongst the Gods
of these lands, that h^ delivered their land out of my ha^ that the Lord should
deliver Je^^salem out of my hand? Am I (...) come up without the Lord aga^^
this land to destroy it? Isa. 36.^ Rabshakeh bolsters up himself a confidence
that God was w^ him: and why? forsooth t^^ had all along been so prosper^ and
successful. Am I now (...) ^ (says he) without the Lord against this land to
destroy it? ^he successes we have had are ^^guments sufficient to inform ^s,
that he is with us, and that ^e will succeed them to us. How ^any wicked men
are there, ^^at upon this bottom stay them^^lves, and yet fall so, as to rise
^o no more? They are but set (...) slippery places, (as the Psalmist ^eaks) and
then cast down into ^^struction, and brought into de^^lation, as in a moment,
they are ^terly consumed with terrors, ^sal. 73.18, 19. Psalm. 73.18, 19.
Thus they flat^^r themselves in their own ^^es, until their iniquity be ^^und
to be hateful. They say ^^ey shall die in their nest, and ^ultiply their days
as the sand. ^his was the ground upon which ^ob's friends argued so strongly
against him, That surely God ^d not love him, because it ^ent so ill with him:
There^re they did not speak of God ^e thing that was right, measuring his
thoughts by outwar^ providence in this world, a^ modelling all their Argumen^
according to this Rule. Now the is too low a way to measure the mind of God,
who is infini^ in knowledge, and of who^ understanding there is no rea^ It is
as high as heaven, what ca^ thou do? deeper than hell, wh^ do thou know? the
measure the^ of is longer than the earth, a^ deeper than the sea, Job 11. 8, ^
Job 11.8, 9.
The Lord would teach his peop^^ from the plenty of outwa^^ Mercies the wicked
do enjo^ to look for other evidences (...) his love; evidences of anoth^^
nature than these things are, (...) which the love of God may cleared up unto
them. T^^ seems to be the carriage of t^ Almighty in these his works Providence
unto his people You see how the draff and s^ of this world is cast bef^^^ them;
and how they wall therein, and fill their bellies: ^ot you look upon these
things ^s arguments of my love to those persons who enjoy them; ^or you see
what kind of crea^ures they are sometimes cast among, even amongst my most
^itter and cruel enemies, such ^s are, and will be so, and who ^buse these good
things to a fur^her hardening them in their ^nmity: but do not you regard
(...), envy not their Portion, neither judge their Condition therefore happy;
measure not any Love by outward Mercies; ^or I thus promiscuously cast them
abroad into the world, to ^ive check to such thoughts as ^ould argue either
love or ha^red from them, Eccles. 9.1.

Sect. XII.
Lastly, The Lord gives such (...) large Dole of outward Mer^ies unto the
wicked in this pre^ent world, because this is all that ever they are like to
have. They are never to expect any ^ore. The Lord deals with them as Abraham
did with t^^ Sons of the Concubines whi^ he had, he gave them gifts, a^ sent
them away from Isaac his s^ eastward into the east-countre^ but he gave all
that he had un^ Isaac, Genesis 25.5, 6. So t^^ Lord gives worldly gifts un^ the
wicked, and, as it were packs them far away, they m^ have nothing to do with h^
habitation, and his holy plac^ the Heavenly Jerusalem is rese^ved for his
Isaacs, the childr^ of the Promise. These Sons (...) the Concubine, they may t^
vail into the East-countrey and there gather their gold, a^^ silver, and
precious stones: among the smooth stones of the stre^ (as the Prophet speaks in
anoth^^ case) is their Portion: Isa. 57.6.
And the is all that ever they are like (...) have; they are to go their wa^
and expect no more. Thus dea^ Jehoshaphat likewise with tho^ Sons that were not
to plead (...) Title to his Kingdom, (inten^i^g the Throne and Crown for
^ehoram) their father gave them ^reat gifts of silver, 2 Chronicles. 21.3.
and of gold and of precious things with fenced ^ties in Judah; but the kingdom
^ave he to Jehoram, because he was ^^e firstborn. So God deals w^t^ ^any of
the wicked in this ^orld, as Jehoshaphat did with ^is other Sons, who gave them
their Dole before hand in great ^ifts, and so committed their ^ortion into
their hands, and ^hey were not to expect any ^ore: the kingdom it was for the
^^rst-born. Thus the wicked have ^reat gifts in this world, their ^ortion is
put into their hands, and they are to expect no more. They are not from hence
to ar^ue, That because he has done ^o well for them, that therefore ^e will do
better, and intends them a further good, cujus con^rarium est verum: Nay you
may ^ather gather an Argument ^uite the other way; because God intends no
further good unto you hereafter, therefore is you have so much now. The we use
to answer men that ha^^ had their Dole already giv^ them, and they will come
again Why do you come again, y^ have had your Dole alread^ So God will answer
to man men, when they shall cry to hi^ for mercy, at that day, W^ come you to
me for more? y^^ have had your Dole alread^ Have not you had more than (...)
your work comes to? Did n^^ your cup overflow in your lif^ time? Psalm. 73.7.
Had not you more the heart could wish? Why do yo^ come again? Did not I (sa^
God) show my self glorious (...) mercy in your day, that you b^ing so wicked as
you were, ha^ yet so much of the good things of the world as you had? I di^ not
only spare you, and eke o^ my long-sufferance toward yo^ but I loaded you then
with b^nefits, and heaped my blessing on you, if so be you would ther^ by have
been led to repentance: Romans 2.4.
and therefore though you be ^enied eternal mercies hereaf^^r, yet you have
cause to tell ^e Devils themselves, and ^mned creatures that shall be ^ur
companions, That God was ^ry merciful to you, while you ^ed in this world. You
had a ^rge Portion here, but here is ^ur All. Son, remember that ^ou, in thy
lifetime, receivedst ^y good things; thou can not ^pect them hereafter too.

CHAP. VI. ^^at the good things the Wicked do enjoy are confined to this
present life; and why?
Sect. I.
THE Third Particular propounded in the handling this Point, is to show, That
(...) the good things the wicked do enjoy are confined to this present life, so
as when their life ends then all their good is at an en^ When the wicked man
dies he shall carry nothing away His glory shall not descend aft^^ him, Psalm
49.17. Naked (...) came into the world, and nake^ he shall return. All his go^
things have their period wi^^ him, he cannot carry them alo^^ into another
world; when dea^ seizes on him, then he is par^ed from them: And then wh^
shall those things be which he h^ provided? Luke 12.20
Though whiles he ^ved, he blessed his soul; a^ his flatterers were about hi^
and his cogging Parasites, a^ they praised him, yet he s^^ go to the generation
of his f^thers, Psalm. 49.18
and shall never see ligh^ and then all his good thi^ are concluded with him.
A^ it is so, that the Portion of t^^ wicked cannot outlive, b^ is confined to
this present lif^ because,

First, That there are some men whose names are written in ^he earth, Cum
homines beati esse volunt; si vere volunt, profecto esse immortales volunt,
aliter enim beati esse non possunt. Aug. de Trin. l. 13. c. 8.
as the Prophet has it, Jer. 17.13. And ^f their names be mortal, why should
their good things be immortal? If their names be written ^n the earth, why
should ^ot their good things die, when their names perish? Their por^ion runs
parallel with their names: For he is swift as the wa^ers, their portion is
cursed in the ^arth, he beholds not the way of ^he vineyards, Job 24.18. It
is a ^readful thing to have the name written in the earth: to have ^arthly
Principles; earthly Mo^ions; an earthly Portion; the Nature earthly; and the
Name ^oo: all written in the earth, ^o as you can read nothing but ^arth in
them; nor read them any where but in the earth. Oh, ^his is a most sad and
dreadful ^tate! and yet we see that this is ^he lot and doom of many persons,
their names are written the earth. (...). Heb. 12.23. Phil. 4.3. Rev. 13.8.
Whereas the God they have their names written (...) heaven, Luke. 10.20. They
a^ enrolled there, as the word m^ be rendered. Their Names a^ in the Book of
Life of the La^ slain from the foundation of t^ world. They shall be called by
new name (says the Prophet which the mouth of the Lord she name, Isa. 62.2.
And their n^ shall remain, and shall be bet^ than of sons and daughters, Isa.
56* They shall have an everlasting na^ that shall not be cut off: Isa. 66.22.
Now the name being eternal, such is the portion too; it runs parallel w^ their
name to all eternity. B^ the name of the wicked (be^ written in the earth)
shall r^ and their good things wi^ them perish, Prove. 10.7.
and give up t^ Ghost.

Sect. II.
Secondly, The good things the wicked are confined to t^ present life, for it
is their o^ choice, they choose it them^ves. They desire the good ^ings of this
life, and they ^ve them, and in that they ^ve no wrong. Have they not ^e
portion they make choice (...)? As Moses set before the ^ople of Israel life
and death; (...) do the Ministers of God, ^en Preaching to you, they ^t life
and death before you, ^u have your choice; and in ^using the way of death, and
^rning from the way of life, when they lie both before you, ^d you are
praeacquainted with ^em) whom can you blame but ^ur selves? Have you not your
^oice? So there are temporal ^d eternal things set before ^u, the one vain and
fading, ^d such as cannot outlive this ^esent life; the other durable ^d
eternal, and to be revealed (...) the life to come, and so to ^ntinue to all
eternity: Now ^^u choose vanity to be your ^rtion, God does you no wrong to
give you your choice, Job 15.31.
van^ shall be your recompense. Y^ that will indent with God f^ your penny, you
cannot take ill, if, when the end of the d^ comes, God puts you off wi^ your
penny. Some of those the were hired in the Vineyard though they agreed to wo^
therein for a penny a day, (...) they began to murmur, wh^ they came to receive
their w^ges: But, says the Master (...) the Vineyard to them, Matthew. 20.11, 12.
Did (...) not agree with me so? were y^ not contented to work for yo^ penny?
and there you have (...) So the wicked hypocrites, the indent with God, and
implici^ly strike a bargain with him all they intend in God's servic^ is, that
they may have so^ present comfort in this wor^ some credit, applause,
prefe^ments, and estates, and the like these are the good things the choose,
and drive a trade abo^^ they dare not trust God for t^ future: They know not
whe^er the glorious, and blessed ^ings of the Covenant of Grace, ^d of
Eternity, be realities, ^^a, or no; they doubt they ^ay prove but imaginations:
and therefore (say they) Let ^s have somewhat new, some^hat for the present,
some pre^^nt pay, we like not to live ^xpectants, under (we know ^ot what)
uncertainties, wait^^g for a reward to come, and (...) so great a distance.
Well, ^says God) you would have pre^ent pay, down in hand, it seems: ^resent
pay you shall have, and ^o more; and do not you here^fter murmur, when you
shall ^ee how others are dealt withal, that would trust me, and wait upon me,
(who never shall be ^shamed of their trust;) do ^ot you then murmur, for you
^ave your choice, the good things you bartered with me for, you have enjoyed.
As there are servants that are hired, and work by the day, or for so^ set time
for wages upon agre^ment, these serve you so, a^ they expect their pay at nigh^
or when their day is out, an^ you give them their wage^ twelve pence a day, or
so, an^ there is an end: But there are other servants now, that serve (...)
expectation of some reversion^ and honor, especially when they serve noble men
and Princes; and these, though they ha^ no present pay given them a^ night, yet
they go on cheerful in their service, they expe^ some great reversions, as
lease^ and preferments, which afterward they may have: An^ these though they
have not their twelve-pence a day, as the other have, yet when the others be
falls them, they are then mad^ rich men, they and their posterities. Now the
poor man that has had his pay every day if when a lease or prefermen^ falls,
he should come in for hi^ part; No, he may be answered, ^^u had your pay every
day: ^re was one was content to ^^st and rely upon me, and ^^d no pay, and now
he is pre^^red. This is the direct dif^^^ence between the men of the ^orld and
God's children: the ^en of the world will do no^^ing without present pay, and
^^at which is just before them ^^ey must needs have, their ^arts are upon it,
they cannot ^^e without it, they choose it as ^^eir part: But the Saints they
^ar what blessings God has ^^vealed in his Word; what a ^^essed Covenant of
Grace there (...) what glorious things there ^e in reversion to be enjoyed,
(...) they will but wait for them, ^d in the service of the Prince (...) the
kings of the earth, Rev. 1.5.
cheer^ly spend their days. They ^ar what rich promises of glo^^ous things to
come, precious ^^omises there are: 2 Pet. 1.4.
Now they ^^lieve God, and trust in God for these, and they say, Lord let me
have my good things the life to come, whatever the do with me here. As Aus^
Hic ure, seca; ibi parce: h^ burn, here cut; but spare h^ after. I am content,
Lord, be burnt, to be cut, to end any hardship in the world, a^ sufferings that
can be laid up^ me; only hereafter I look somewhat else, and I Will wait
hereafter; my part and port^ shall be in reversion. You t^ will not wait for
hereafter, (...) you must have it for the prese^^ why, you have your choice, y^
portion is put into your o^ hands, and if it last no lon^ than this present
life, it is (...) present pay, you may blame y^^ selves. Oh, it is a very seri^
thing, and of no less than e^nal import we have now in ha^ How will many a soul
lam^ and howl, and curse it self et^^nally, that it was not cont^ to trust God
for hereafter, (...) would have present pay?

Sect. III.
Thirdly, The good things the ^cked enjoy in this present ^orld are the only
suitable ^^ings to their hearts, and what ^ould they do with any more
^^reafter? The things of this ^orld are the adequate objects (...) the frame of
their hearts. Caus^s corruptelarum, non in illecebris, sed in cordibus habemus;
and vitiositas nostra men's nostra est. Salvi de Guber. l. 6.
^hese things do exceedingly ^ease them, and give them all ^ntent, they are
commensurate (...) their desires: in these things ^^ey hugg and bless
themselves. ^t as for the things that are to ^^me hereafter, the full
revela^^on whereof is reserved to a ^^me at after this life shall be ^pired;
these they are utterly ^angers to, and (as disagre^^le to their genius) they
mind ^^em not. They desire no more ^t what will suit them now at ^^esent, what
is carnal, and ^^rthly, so as all their good then ^ds, when their life comes to
(...) end. And what would men that are carnal and wicked n^ do in heaven? Could
they w^ their corrupt principles, (...) wicked hearts have admo^^ there for a
while, (which is (...) possible) there would be noth^ there agreeable to their
temp^ If they be so contrary unto (...) now, much more would the^ contrary unto
him then. If (...) they say unto God, Job 21.14.
Depart f^^ us, for we desire not the knowl^ of thy ways; How griev^ would the

Saints of God now, cert^ly they would hate them m^ more then. Now the graces
(...) the faithful are imperfect, (...) yet they hate them for their ^ces sake,
much more would ^ hate them then, when their ^ces shall be perfect. Now wicked

when as (...) the one hand the godly shall glorious in holiness; and on (...)
other all the common gifts the wicked shall be taken a^y. The portion of the
wick^ must needs end with this pre^t life, the things of a better (...) are so
unsuitable to their ^arts. Their good things, per^s, may run parallel with
their ^es, holding out as long they live, so as they may (...) in their full
strength, Job 21.23.
being ^olly at ease and quiet, but when ^ath has cut the thread of ^eir lives
all their good comes an end.

Sect. IV.
Fourthly, The wicked abuse ^e good things which here they (...) enjoy, and
therefore they ^ll have none hereafter. They and them upon their lusts, ^d
sight against God in the ^ength of his own blessings: ^s gentleness makes them
great, and in this their gre^^ness they rebel against him. T^^ benefits they
are loaded wi^^ (which should teach them tha^ fullness toward, and dependa^
upon the giver) are turned a^ perverted by them to a qui^ contrary course, to
bless themselves in their evil way, a^ burn incense unto their dragg. Hab. 1.16.
T^^ goodness of God which sho^ lead them to repentance, Romans 2.4.
they d^spise, and after their hardn^ and impenitent heart, treasure^ unto
themselves wrath against day of wrath, and revelation the righteous judgment of
G^^ Now if the wicked be thus u^faithful (as how can they otherwise?) in the
Mammon unrighteousness, Luke 16.11.
(which, as (...) them thus abused, is rightly (...) who shall commit to their
tru^ true riches? If they be thus a^sive and unfaithful in the go^ things here,
surely the go^ things of hereafter they she not meddle with. Alas he^ ^o we
see wicked men abuse ^^eir mercies? their riches to ^ide, and carnal
confidence; ^eir pleasures to excess; their ^^fts to ostentation, and
vain^^ory; their preferments to am^tion; their power to oppres^^on; their
health to wanton^ess; their prosperity to vani^, and contempt of the Word ^^d
Gospel; Psalm. 69.22.
their very table be^mes a snare before them, and that which should have been
for their ^elfare, it becomes a trap. Now ^e abuse of their portion here, and
their squandring away Gods ^ercies, consuming them upon ^eir lusts, Jam. 4.3.
so as they serve not ^od at all in the abundance of ^l things, shall
unavoidably ex^ose them to a want of all good ^ings hereafter. Here they have
^^d their fill, hereafter they shall ^ve no more.

Sect. V.
Fifthly, The men of this ^orld, they have no interest (...) Jesus Christ; and
therefore though they have a large p^^tion of the good things of t^^ world here
given out unto the yet, being wicked, when t^^ life shall end, all their go^
comes to an end. They ha^^ not an interest in Christ, thro^ whom the rich
treasures of i^^^nite grace are let out to all et^^nity. There Is no way or m^
for the conveyance of eter^ mercies, but through the L^ Christ; nor through him
to a^ but those that are in him. S^ as have an Interest in Ch^ here, by a work
of grace up^ their hearts, that interest (...) carry on to the enjoyment (...)
eternal mercies; The Cond^ of God's mercies, through Chr^ will eternally flow
in glory ^^wards them. God has di^ Conduit pipes (as I may (...) of his grace,
to let out unto creatures: there are some ^ser Conduit pipes, and the are
opened, through God's et^nal bounty: oil, butter, a^ honey, (the good things of
this ^resent World) run generally through these Pipes, and so fa^l ^own as well
upon the wicked ^s the godly; The Influences of ^od's general bounty the wick^d
may partake of, and sit under ^s distillations: but now the ^urrent of God's
Eternal Mer^es is stopped by Justice from them, (...) as it cannot be opened to
have ^y drop of that mercy let out upon them, in that they have no ^^terest in
Christ, by whom a^ne Divine Justice is satisfied, ^^d this current opened: In
the ^ean while the other smaller ^pes, they run the general ^unty of God
toward them. ^ow the work of Jesus Christ, ^e Second Person in the blessed
^rinity, and that wherein the ^ry mystery of the Gospel lies, (...) that the
Second Person in the ^rinity, seeing the children of ^en capable of Eternal
happi^^ss, and that there are glori^s treasures with God to be communicated to
them, b^ through their sin this current (...) Divine Justice is stopped, a^ the
fiery Flaming Sword of t^^ Law is turning every way (...) keep the way of the
tree of Li^ so that these treasures cannot enjoyed, neither the current (...)
unless the way be cleared, a^ Justice satisfied; he, out of p^ to mankind, that
mankind (...) not be put off with these gene^ outward comforts: comes, a^
satisfies God's Infinite Justi^ that so he might open the ^rent, the Sluice of
God's Infi^^ and Eternal Mercies. Now h^^py are those creatures who h^ an
interest in the Lord Christ They are under the Influence God's Eternal Mercies,
the go^ things of the Life to come (...) theirs: He has satisfied (...)
Justice of God the Father (...) them, and so the great Pipe^ opened, the
Conduit of Eter^ Mercies, and then flows in (...) Grace; Infinite, Eternal Gr^
till running out toward them. ^w the men of the World ^ey live under the
droppings of ^mmon bounty, Job. 21.12, 13. Psalm 65.11, 12. Psalm. 73.7. Jerem.
12.1.
and so God's ^ths may drop fatness on them; ^t the current of Eternal Mer^s is
stopped toward them, ^^ey have no Interest in the Son. (...) these men have,
is but a little ^zling of God's general boun^ through some crannies, and ^s is
all the good, that ever ^^ey are like to have, which ^^en it ends, they shall
have no ^ore. The fruits of God's ge^rall bounty and patience are ^e sole, and
only portion of ^me men, who are under the ^urse of Justice, and these shall
^ve what they earn, and no ^ore: they are at work upon ^e hand terms of the
Covenant (...) works: but strangers to, and ^^t within the bounds of the
^ovenant of grace; and there^^re the Mercies of this Cove^nt which is full,
Ordered in all ^ings, and sure, they shall not have; the drizlings of comm^
bounty upon them as creatu^ shall be the all, 2 Samuel 23 5. Isa. 55.3. Acts.
13.34.
they shall enj^ Now Christ the head of the C^venant, undertaking for bel^vers,
satisfies God's Justice; a^ opens for them the Flood-gate^ Eternal Mercies: But
as for ^ unbelievers (who by their unb^lief exclude themselves) Just^ blocks up
the way of mercy ^ them. And here is the very ^ between the condition of so^
men, and of others: that so^ have all their good things he^ and others have an
higher go^ in the World to come. The have an Interest in Christ, the have none.

. VI.
Sixthly, They are no sons, ^ children, and therefore they ^ not to expect the
portion t^ belongs to children. There ^ some gifts that servants s^ have, and
there are portion ^at are left for children, and ^ese are vastly different one
^om the other. As rich men ^en they are to die, and so ^ake their Wills, and a
dispo^ion of their estates, they will ^ave some legacies to their ser^^nts, and
retainers who have ^ed with them, and in some re^rds been serviceable to them,
^rhaps to every servant in the ^use five pounds a piece, or so; ^t when they
come to write in ^eir Will concerning their chil^en, what such a son, or such a
^ughter shall have: that is ano^er manner of business than ^ur or five pounds,
the porti^s they leave to them are great ^rtions, such as are meet for the
^ildren of such a father: Nay ^^ey divide the all, they have ^^ong them,
excepting those ^w small bequests, which are not ^orth the naming. Now, the
^uth is, the whole World may ^ divided between children and ^^rvants; for
though the wicked be at defiance with God, (...) God by his overruling power
so swaies the Scepter througho^^ the World, that he makes the^ servants one way
or other: so (...) they serve those Superintende^ designs of his in the Worl^
which all things move in Subse^viency to, though the course (...) hidden. Now
these, as servan^ shall have some little legacy, b^ they must not expect the
chi^drens portions. This legacy (...) allotted to them here, and therefore the
portion of hereafte^ which is the childrens righ^ they must not look for. ^
Ezekiel. 46.16. Thus says t^^ Lord, If the Prince give a gift n^ any of his sons,
the inheritan^ thereof shall be his sons, it shall (...) their possession by
inheritance. B^ if he give a gift of his inher^tance to one of his servants,
then ^ shall be his to the year of libert^ This was God's Law, That if Prince
gave a gift to his son, the son should inherit it for ever^ but if he gave it
but to a servant, ^^en it should continue with him ^ut for a while. So here
lies the ^^fference of God's Administra^^on of all his gifts, some to sons, and
some to servants. The ^^ft he gives to servants shall ^ontinue but for a while,
with a short time, they shall all be ^lled for in again: All the good ^^ey
have, and comforts they en^y, all those sweet morsels they ^ave fed upon, and
pleasant de^^cacies they have delighted ^^emselves in, shall be all called ^or
in again. But that which he ^ives to his sons and children, ^^all be theirs for
ever: they ^^all have mercy for ever, though ^ot to enjoy it in the same way;
^leasures that shall never fade, their comforts shall abide, their ^ortion
endure, and their joy, ^one shall take away from them. ^oh. 16.22.

. VII.
Seventhly, The good things the wicked enjoy are limited to the present Life,
after which they sha^ have no more: in that all they have does come from God's
patience Now the day of patience shine upon them, and all the good the do enjoy
is indulged them upon that account: but the time wi^ come when patience shall
wait n^ longer, and forbearance shall b^ no more. God's Spirit shall n^ always
strive with man. Genesis 6.3* Impenitent and wicked man* And then when the day of
patience is over, and their Sun sets in a cloud, and the blackness o^ darkness
covers them, all their good things are gone. The^ flowed from patience whilst
it was manifested, and during that time, their good things they did enjoy; but
that day being past, and the curtain drawn, they bid adieu to all their good
for ever. As there are some Graces of the spirit of God in the Saints, that ^n
regard of their exercise shall ^ave an end here in this World. ^o there are
some Attributes of God, that in regard of, and as to ^he manifestation of them,
in that way that now God does manifest them in, shall here in this World ^ave
an end. As the patience ^f God toward ungodly ones, ^hen they die: If the long
suf^ering of God wait upon them ^ll their life long, yet then it shall wait
upon them no longer: There Is no room for, nor call unto repentance in the
grave. Now if the wicked hold all upon ^atience, when the time of the ^xercise
thereof in this World shall come to an end, then all their good shall end and
determine with it.

. VIII.
Ei^h^hly, After this Life, all the ^ood things of the wicked cease, for they
shall have to deal wi^ God immediately in the world^ come. This is worth the
whi^ of our observance: The ungod^ shall have to deal immediate^ with God in
the World to com^ Now they have to deal with Go^ through creatures, and in the
m^diation and intervention ^ creatures is all their convers^ And while they
have to de^ with God through creatures, ^ unjust Stewards, they may get great
deal, and may shift for much; but when they shall com^ to deal with God
immediatel^ then it will be otherwise wit^ them, As at great men's houses there
are a great many of Hang-bies and Parasites; these, perhaps when they come to
have t^ deal with the servants, get some bits and scraps, and many thing from
the servants, and to tha^ end, endeavor to ingratiat^ themselves into the
acquaintanc^ of such servants who are more facile, and whom they can bette^
^ork their designs upon. But ^ they know they can have no^^ing but from the
very hand of ^^e Knight, or Lord of the house himself, this presently checks
their attempts, and they will ex^ect no great matter in such ^ay; as otherwise
from the ^ands of the servants. So the ^icked men of this World, they ^re as
Hang-bies, and all that ^hey have are but as scraps from ^he servants; they
have to deal ^nly with creatures, they look no ^urther: but hereafter, things
shall ^e settled another way, and, all things shall be weighed by God himself
in a just balance; and distri^utions accodingly made by the ^ands of God
himself immediate^y, and now things will be carried after another manner: the
Lord himself will come to dispose of things. Here in this World the Lord
suffered them to intermed^e with his creatures, and they ^craped, and gathered
together, and spent upon their Lusts: whatsoever they hooked in they looked
upon as their own and the Lord, (as't were) overlooked them all the while: B^
now he will come near to them, t^ judgment: Malach. 3.5.
and all shall be weighed in an even balance, the righ^ they have to these
things shall b^ examined, and their title tried and having now to deal wit^ God
immediately, the course o^ things shall be quite altered, an^ they themselves
stripped bare an^ naked, and then whose shall these things be, which they have
provided? Luke. 12.20.

. IX.
Ninthly, All the good things o^ the wicked shall end when thi^ Life is done,
they are bounded a^ the utmost with this prese^ Life, for they have nothing t^
put into the scale for the goo^ things of another, that may bar^ any proportion
with them. No^ the good things of Eternity a^^ dispensed as well in a way of
^^stice, as of mercy. As God is ^ercifull, so he is just, in giving ^t an
Eternal Portion to his ^^ildren, so as their happiness (...) all Eternity is
founded in a ^ay of justice, as well as of merry. The children of God, have ^he
righteousness of Christ to ^ut into the Scale, which nothing can counterpoise,
but an ^xceeding and eternal weight of glory. 2 Cor. 3.17.
The righteousness and sa^isfaction of the Lord Christ their Mediator, will be
put into ^ne Scale, and the portion of ^he Saints into the other, and their
portion will be weighed by ^he righteousness of Christ: and ^he work of his
Mediation for them. But when the wicked ^ome before God, and are ^rought to the
balance! alas, what have they to put into the Scale? Interest in Christ they
have none, a title to his righteousness they cannot plead, they despighted him
all their days, and rejected the counsel of God ^^ainst themselves; Luke
7.30. and 19.14. Romans 10.3.
they would ^ have him to reign over them, neither submitted themselves to
(...) righteousness of God. And therefore of this prize (sometimes i^ the hands
of them, Fools) the^ have utterly deprived themselves. Well, but to the Sca^
they must come! Now, to p^ in their sins, they see these weig^ down to the
lowest Hell, an^ call for their Wages at the hand^ of a Just, Romans 6.23.
Righteous and Infinitel^ Holy God; they cry aloud for wrath and vengeance to
all Eternity: And therefore these (i^ it was possible, they would smother and
hide: oh! they shall then wish they had never committed them; and seeing the
ugliness and dreadful evil of sin^ they could, in that respect, desir^ the
mountains to fall upon them, and the rocks to cover them* Shall they put into
the Scale their formal services unto God^ their coming to Church, their
attendance upon God's Public ^rdinances, some good civil ^tions, or moral
works that ^ey have done? Says God to ^em, That which thou have had ^ready,
weighs down all these; ^r all this thou have had thy re^ard already, and much
more: (...) there be nothing to put into ^he Scale but this, thou art un^one,
and there is nothing for ^hee for Eternity. And this is another ground of the
confine^ent of the good things of the ^icked to this present Life; They have
nothing upon the ac^ount whereof they may plead and lay claim to the good
things of another: nothing of worth to put into the Scale; being laid ^n the
balance, all they have can bare no weight, and is not only vanity, but lighter
than vanity it self, and vexation of Spirit too. Their sin is their sorrow;
their righteousness and works shall not profit them; when they cry, their
companies shall not deliver them, the wind shall carry them all away, ^nity
shall take them: when he t^^ puts his trust in God shall posse^ the land,
and shall inherit his H^ Mountain. Isa. 57.12, 13.

. X.
Lastly, The good things (...) the wicked are confined to the present Life, in
that, all the^^ good is temporal: such a goo^ as suits the sensible part of man
and answers the lower and inferior faculties of the soul. No^ we know that
temporal goo^ things they are not long lived they cannot last to Eternity Nay,
do we not see how soo^ they are out of date? They eve^ perish with the using;
and are ^ vanishing, Col. 2.22. 1 Cor. 7.31.
whilst we are in the enjoyment of them. Few o^ them last out man's time, and
i^ there be any that run parelle^ with the date of his days; yet when his time
is out, they de^ermine too, and cannot go along with, much less follow their
po^sions into the other World. (...) not all the good of worldly ^n temporal,
to eat and drink, (...) sport and play, to buy, sell, ^d get gain? Is not their
^ength, study, parts, time, ^wer and policy, all laid out ^d employed, for the
getting ^d gaining of earthly things, ^d for the encompassing of car^l ends?
Spiritual good which of a lasting nature, they have ^one, yea are utterly
unacquaint^d with. The Graces of the spirit, Faith, Hope, Charity, they ^now
not what they mean: those branches of the Kingdom ^f God, righteousness, Romans
14.17.
peace and ^y in the Holy Ghost, find no place (...) them. Grace here which is
^onsummate in Glory hereafter, and from which a lasting good ^oth spring (so as
where it is, ^here an Eternal good shall fol^ow) of this they have no work upon
their hearts. How shall ^hey enjoy an Eternal good, who have not any thing as a
pr^vious foundation here laid in o^der thereunto? 1 Timothy 6.19.
Or how shall the^ present good stretch beyond t^ bounds of this temporary Life
which is of the same kind ther^ with, and in nature only fitt^^ and suited for
its service; so ^ when this Life ends, its resp^ctive service is concluded wi^
it? The men of the world e^quire after no more, but wh^ shall we eat, Mat.
6.31. 1 John 2.16.
what shall we drin^ and wherewithal shall we be cl^thed? The lust of the
flesh, the l^ of the eyes, and the pride of Li^ fills up the Scene of their
lives That Is all they look after, the care for no more. Now the^ good being all
temporal, an^ wholly so, it must needs be bounded with this present Life: S^
that when their Life ends, th^^ all their good determines wit^ it.

CHAP. VII. ^f the condition of such men, who have all their good in this
present Life, with respect to the nature of the good things they do here enjoy.
. I.
THe opening of this subject (the Worldy man's good) is so ^sefull, and the
concern thereof ^o general in order to the disco^ery of the sin, and folly of
the ^eceitfull, and desperately-wick^d heart of man, and the awake^ing of it to
enquire, and look ^ut for a better good; that the ^ull improvement of a point
of ^his nature cannot be but beneficial, if duly considered in the various and
distinct respects ^hereof. Therefore now in the next place, we are to take a
view of the condition of such men, all whose good is in thi^ present world, and
this with (...) respect to the nature of the good they do here enjoy: which i^
poor, low and mean, then accordingly must their condition need be. The nature
and quality o^ the good which the person fixes upon, does influence the
condition of the person so, as to render it consentaneous to it self. I^ the
good be true, real and lasting; then the condition of the person (whose good it
is) is happy, joyful and blessed: But if the good be deceitful, perishing and
a mere apparent; then the condition of the person is wretched. miserable and
accursed, as having nothing to hold by, and lean unto, but that which is, and
makes him so. And first, consider how poor and mean the things are, that the
men of the World do here enjoy. What are their comforts for the most part, but
imaginary? such as tickle, and please fancy or sense, a while, and then ^hey
pass away, and are gone. The things that make such a noise, and for which there
is ^uch a bustle in the World, all the good of them is but such as for a while,
pleases the imagination, or tickles the fancy in the per^uit of them, and when
it should come to be enjoyed, and laid ^old on by the embracing and ^etentive
faculty of the soul, then ^t turns into a Cloud, Ixion's Juno, and vanishes
away. The profit about to express Ephraim's vanity upon this account, says,
That Ephraim feeds on the wind, Hos. 12.1. That was but a silly food that
Ephraim fed upon; light and vain, and puffing up, (like a Witches feast)
leaving the soul empty and unsatisfied: There was no substantial, real good in
the food that Ephraim fed upon; the Objects of his persuit were vain, and all
his pleasant daintes, deceitful meat. It was, Isa. 29.8.
even as when an hungery man dreameth, and behold he eats* but he awaketh,
and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and behold, he
drinks, but (...) awaketh, and behold he is faint, an^ his soul has
appetite. The imaginary good that is in the thing of this Life may puff up the
heart and make it swell with pride an^ vanity; but the soul (alas) the better
part cannot relish or fee^ upon it. Thus a man may have his hearts desire, but
there is leaness sent into his soul. Psalm. 106.5.
And a when a bladder is filled up wi^ wind it biggens and swells, an^ seems as
though it would prov^ some great, solid and substantia^ thing; but one prick
with a pi^^ makes the whole abortive, and lets out all the wind: even s^ the
men of the World they fatten, swell, grow great, loo^ big in their own, and
other^ eyes; but when the prick o^ death comes, it lets out all their comforts,
their Sun sets in ^ Cloud: Then all darkness shall b^ hid in their secret
places, and a fire ^ot blown shall consume them. Job. ^0.26. And then whose
shall those things be which they have provided. ^uk. 12.20. Adrian the Emperor
when about to die, and the King ^f terrors drew near unto him; and ^e was to
bid adieu unto all his Worldly Glory, and to launch ^ut into the depth of
Eternity! How dismal was his condition, and how poor and mean did all Worldly
Good appear in his ^ye?

Animula vagula, blandula,
Hospes comesque corporis,
Quae nunc abibis in loca,
Pallidula, rigida, nudula,
Ne ut soles dabis Jocos?
The wise Solomon in his dissuasive from the immoderate love and persuit of the
things of this Life, and more particularly that piercing lust of the eyes,
riches, 1 Timothy 6.10. 1 John. 2.16.
uses this argument, and tells us, ^hey are not; he knows not how to
praedicate any thing of substance or reality on them. Will thou set thine eyes
upon that whi^^ is not? says he, Prove. 23.5. is not, there is no reality in*
All the good you fancy to (...) therein, it is but imaginary, it not true, nor
real: and therefo^ oh do not set your heart upon it; Psalm. 62.10
it is not worthy, nor wort^ the while to adulterate your precious souls
therewith. When Agrippa and Bernice came in gre^ Pomp and State to the Assembly
as you may read, Acts. 25.23 that which we read Pomp, it i^ in the Greek, (...).
with a great fanc^ However they themselves or others might look upon it, yet
the Holy Ghost tells us, That it was b^ a fancy, there was nothing real i^ it.
All the Pomp and Jollity i^ the World is but a fancy: Thi^ is the nature of all
Worldly good, it is a good, but merely i^ imagination; having no more worth
therein, than what the fancy puts upon it. Thus as the Earth is hanged upon
nothing. Job. 26.7. So all the Good of the Worldly Man is doubly hanged on
nothing: not only in that it is of the earth, earthy: but hung upon his own
conceit, which is vanity and less than nothing.

. II.
Secondly, All worldly good it is of a very low nature, so far below ^he soul
(that better and immor^al part of man) that it cannot ^each it, neither can the
soul in ^ts excellent motions hold any ^onverse with it: There is no Adequate
Proportion between ^n Immortal Soul, and all, or any earthly good whatever. The
soul is a spiritual substance ^n eternal Being; But Worldly Good is caduce, and
vain. The ^rophet speaking of the Egypti^ns Horses, says, Isa. 31.3.
They are flesh and not spirit: So it may be said ^f all Worldly Excellency it
is as ^esh, vain and fading, and not ^f a lasting nature as the immor^al part
of man; The soul is a spiritual Being, high, and of a noble extract: Worldly
good is as flesh, low, and of the earth, earthy. The soul requires Homogeneous
and similar objects to converse withal; whereas all Wordly Good it is but a
belly-full, if so; it but fills the belly, according to that of the Prophet
Psalm. 17.14. And hence Worldly minded Men do make their Belly their God, whose
God is thee Belly, says the Apostle. Phil. 3.19. But what is that to the Soul*
Their Body may be fat, the eye stand out with fatness. Psalm. 73.7. when the
Soul may be in a poo^ and wretched condition, leanes^ sent into the soul. Psalm.
186.15. Luke 12.19.
Indeed the ric^ man in the Gospel did say, So^ take thine ease, for thou have
go^^ laid up for many years, eat, drin^ etc. What Is all this to the Soul S.
Ambrose has such a speech upon the place, If the Man (sa^ he) had the Soul of
a Swine, w^^ could be said otherwise? If he (...) had the Soul of a Swine this
(...) course had been suitable to him; for these things are agreeing to the
Soul of a Swine: but greatly below the excellency and dignity of the rational
and immortal soul of man. These are things whose bounds are here below upon the
earth, and their course is in the Orbs of this present World: whilst the true
rest of the soul, it is above, and its regular and proper motion is upwards
(though by sin now obstructed) to the God of the Spirits of all flesh, Number 16.22
the Original and Fountain of its Being. And therefore no full and perfect
close can there be between the Soul of Man, and all his World^y Good; the one
in its Nature and Original being so high and excellent; and the other so mean
and low.

. III.
Thirdly, You shall f^nd that no man is a whit the better because of outward
things; these may render the outward condition of one man in the World better,
tha^ that of another, but they never make the man a jot the better, in
reference to that excellency from whence truly Good has its denomination. Do we
account the man the better, because of his fine clothes, rich array, sumptuous
buildings, large possessions, ample provisions, great retinue stately port and
garb, and the like magnificence? True it is this is a resplendent piece o^
glory in the eye of the World amusing it by its dazzling lustre^ but for all
this, the person where it is, is not a whit the better This may render him the
greater man, and perhaps may pejorate, and undoubtedly (where not satisfied)
will, and does corrupt his conditions more, bu^ the better man it can never
make him. Solomon tells us, that the heart of the wicked is little worth, Prove.
10.20. His estate may be somewhat worth, and so may his house and lands too:
but his heart, it is little worth: There Is no true excellency nor worth, at all
in that part, out of which the worth of a man cannot lie, and therefore
miserably worthless is the man: for all the possessions, glory, and good things
of this present World by him enjoyed cannot in the least add unto his worth,
whilst his heart is so little worth. The person whose these enjoyments are, may
meet with high and suitable entertainment in the World, but if we search into
the grounds of such respect, and examine whence it is, we shall find ^t given,
not upon the account of any intrinsic worth, whether natural or acquired of
his own* but it is for his servants sake, his rich enjoyments, for otherwise in
him there is no worth at all. It was the speech of Socrates once to one
Achilous, who had a fine house, and many brave things there, (says he) There
are many come to see thy house, t^ view thy Chambers, to walk thy Galleries,
and to delight themselves in those fine Objects there but no body comes to see
thee They know there is a worth i^ the fine house, and in the fine furniture, in
thy fruitful Orchards and pleasant Gardens, bu^ they see no worth in thee. The
good things of the World mak^ no man truly better; they neither give grace nor
glory, the^ do not truly enoble and enric^ the mind: man's spiritual condition
is not bettered by them; but in the fullness of such sufficiencies the condition
of the possesso^ is the same it was, as to sin o^ grace; though oftentimes in
respect of sin, a great deal worse.

Fourthly, Suppose the good things of the World were a suitable Object for the
Soul, y^ what thou have here is but a very poor pittance, a scanty portion; a l
that thou have is but a very little piece of the World. If thou had the
Devils offer at thy command, Mat. 4.9.
All these things will I give thee, thou would think that to be a matter of
some moment; yea but if God should make a thousand Worlds more for thee to
command, all this were but a poor pittance, to put off an Immortal Soul withal.
An Immortal Soul is more precious than in its worth, to be answered by the
fullness of all terrene enjoyments. But the all thou have, and which thou make
thy boast of is but a little Minnim in the World: it is less than a point to
the whole Circumference. The Prophet Isaiah tells us, that All Nations are as a
drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance. Isa.
40.15. What is thy dust then? what is thy Soul and Land, and possessions then?
If the Nations be but as the small dust of the balance before God, then surely
thy part (how great soever in thine eye) is as nothing before him, and is
counted to him less than nothing and vanity. ver. 17. As Socrates wittily
rebuked the pride of Alcibiades, who boasted of his Possessions and Manors,
and that he had so much Land lay together; he brought unto him his Map of the
World, and says, Pray show me where your land lies here; one prick of a pen
would have described it all. Search but for your great estates in the Map of
the World, and you see what a loss you are presently reduced unto, they cannot
be found. You whose thoughts are raised within you upon the account of your
Lands and Farms, and Manors, view but a Map of the World, and you see what a
little spot Great Britain is unto the World, and wherein then are your Farms
and Manors (which you reckon so much upon) to be accounted off? It was Luthers
expression concerning the Turkish Empire, so vast and large as it is, says he,
It is but a crum that the Master of the Family casts to dogs. Turcicum imperium
quantum quantum est, mica est quam paterfamilias canibus projicit. Luth. in
Genes.
The whole Turkish Empire in his esteem was but as a crum. And when the World
began a little to smile upon him, and the Gospel through Gods mercy found some
entertainment, so as the Opposition and Malignity wherewith he was before
infested, did seem to begin to cease, and there were great gifts sent in to him
by many of the great men of Saxony; he fearing God would put him off with a
present reward, and lest here should be his Portion, and to show how little he
valued the things of this present World, says he vehementer protestatus si m
me nolle sic abeo satiari, I did vehemently protest that I would not be put off
with these outward good things: He should not put me off so, that is his word,
according to the manner of the man; you know the man and his language; I did
profess, says he, the Lord should not put me off so. It Is true they that are
godly, account themselves unworthy of the least mercy they have here in this
World: but there is this Practical Maxim and Mystery of Religion; that a
gracious heart, though he thinks himself unworthy of the least crum of bread,
yet all creatures in Heaven and Earth will not serve him to be his Portion, nor
give him satisfaction. Though he has an Heart that looks upon the least mercy
as beyond his desert, and upon himself, with Old Jacob, as not worthy of the
least of all God's mercies; Genes. 32.10.
yet if God should give him Heaven and Earth, his Heart could not be satisfied
with a l those enjoyments, except God gives him himself too. Therefore, surely
all the good thou do enjoy, being but a minute part (if we may term it so)
of the good of the whole World, is but a poor pittance, and a very scanty
Portion.

. V.
Fifthly, The good things thou have, they will quickly vanish and come to
nothing, they are now ready to take wing and fly away: Though at present thou
enjoyest them, yet thou have no certainty of them, they are things that want a
Foundation; and therefore it is said of Abraham, (...).
that he looked for a City that had Foundations. Heb. 11.10. As if all worldly
excellency here below had nothing certain to stay upon. Job tells us, that the
earth is hanged upon nothing. Job. 26.7. And if the earth it self hang on
nothing, than surely all earthly good must needs have but a vain Foundation.
There is a worm at the root of every creature, and of all creature comfort,
that in time will consume it. Jon^h's Gourd flourished f^r a short time, and he
sat under its shadow with great delight: bu^ how soon did it fail and whither
away? It came up in a night, and perished in a night. Augustus nocturno visu
stipem quotannis die certo emendicabat a populo, cavam manum asses
porrigentibus praebens Sueton in Aug. c. 19.
Jonah. 4.10. So it is with all creature-excellency, it is but short lived, so
soon it passes away and is quite gone. Therefore riches are called uncertain
riches. 1 Timothy 6.17. neither trust (...), in the uncertainty of riches, which
soon disappear, or which are manifestly uncertain. The pleasures of sin are but
for a season. Heb. 11.25. Nay, the World passes away, and the lust thereof. 1 John 2.17. Therefore All that is in the World, the lust of the flesh the lust
of the eyes, and the pride of Life cannot be of any long continuance, but will
quickly vanish. All that is in the World is but as a morning cloud, or as the
early dew which passes away: The morning cloud hovers about for a while in the
air, but by and by, as evanid, by the motion of the air, and ^nfluenced upon by
the beams of ^he Sun, it is rarefied, dispersed, and gone. The early dew lies
^or a while upon the tender grass, ^ill the Sun arise, and by its ^preading
beams not only en^ightens, but warms the Earth and Heavens, and then they dew
is ^xhaled, dried up and gone. How soon is a Garment worn ^ut, and so cast by?
or upon ^he account of Fashion (as grown ^ut) laid aside? (...). Transversas
agit species
So the Fashion ^f this World passes away, says ^he Apostle. 1 Cor. 7.31. And
^oon do the things thereof wax ^ld like a Garment and as a Ve^ture change.
Psalm. 102.26. We ^ee that a dream is soon over, and a Night Vision quickly
pas^ed; the Dream ends in vanity, and the Vision disappears: such ^re the good
things of the World, they are for a while as ^n appearance, and anon they
disappear again. A Christian is made for an Eternal condition, and so must
leave these things behind him; the Soul of Man it is an Immortal Being, but a^l
Worldly Good and comforts are transitory, and can never attend their owners
into their Eternal States. When thou come to enter upon thy Eternal State, if
thou should then enquire, what shall I have now? What is it of all I have
that goes along with me now? I have now thus much, and thus much; so much
Lands, such Farms, such Commings in, such Revenues, so much of Power, Place,
Authority and Earthly greatness; so much of Renown and Honor, wealth in
abundance, a Multitude of Riches, as in Psalm. 49.6. My Life is full: But what
shall I have now I come to enter in upon my Eternal State? Truly, nothing at
all, ye shall carry nothing away with you, ver. 17. But naked shall you return
to go as you came, and shall take nothing of all your labor, which you may
carry away in your hand Eccles. 5.15. How sad will the condition of that man
be, when ^he is to leave all behind him; and has no good of an Eternal Nature
to carry with him into his Eternal State? If a man were to take a great voyage,
suppose to the Indies, and all the Provision he makes is this, he gets an Old
leaking Vessel, that can make shift to carry him a little way out of the
Harbor toward the Ocean, and he lays in a little Provision, so much as might
suffice for a short cut over some creek, or to coast the Land to some
neighboring Port; this he provides for, and so goes on, and begins his Voyage
toward the Indies, and is gotten into the Ocean: Alas, the Vessel is a rotten
Vessel, altogether unfit for service, and his Provision as poor as his Vessel
worthless: were not this an unwise man? Truly, this is the condition of
thousands in the World, they make no due Provision for their Eternal Estate.
Know, you ar^ made for an Eternal Condition God intends Eternity to ever^ one
of us, and expects that ou^ lives should be spent in makin^ Provision for this
our Eternal Estate; and we think of nothing but that we may provid^ for a few
years here, and live i^ some fashion, and be some bod^ in the World, and leave
our posterity accordingly, this is the whole that takes up our hearts* and the
thoughts of Eternity an^ laid aside. Oh, when you com^ to launch out into the
vast Ocea^ of Infinite Eternity, what a strange alteration shall you find* How
will your minds be changed in you, when you come to see that you have provided
nothing for Eternal Life, have made no Provision for Eternity? And now all the
Worldly Good you have enjoyed must be left behind you! Oh, the great difference
there is between the same men within a few days He that now flourishes in all
a^undance, when he enters upon ^is Eternal Estate, sees, how he ^ust make his
return naked, and ^l his good shall go no further ^ith him: His thoughts now
^ow are they changed from what ^^ey were? the difference will be (...) vast and
large, that it seems (...) bespeak him another man. ^o uncertain and deceitful
is all ^is Worldly Good that it will ^ot carry him into another World.

. VI.
Sixthly, All the good thou have (...) this present World, it is no ^ther, but
what may stand with ^^e Eternal hatred of an Infinite ^od toward thee. It is
consi^ent with God's Eternal hatred. and will thou rejoice in this as (...)
thing of worth? It may be ^^e Portion of a Reprobate; and will this serve thy
turn? ^ill that give satisfaction to thy Soul, that a Reprobate may have at
large as his Portion? Ther^ are many now that are sweltrin^ under the wrath of
the Infinit^ and Eternal God, that have ha^ as much, yea much more of the good
things of this present Lif^ than ever you enjoyed: The have had greater Estates
tha^ you, more Honor and Glory i^ the World than you, lived me^rier lives than
you, and yet a^^ now under the wrath of God and like so to continue to all
Eternity. Will a Reprobates Portion serve thy turn? Wilt tho^ sit down
contented with that notwithstanding which the wrat^ of God may abide upon thee?
Jo^ 3.36. Oh, those things sure^ are very low and mean, tha^ may stand with
God's Eternal hatred. Consider the having the Dominion of all the World man but
to have the least dram of saving Grace cannot stand wit^ God's Eternal hatred.
What ^ difference then is there betwee^ the having the least dram of true
^aving Grace, and the enjoyment ^f all the World? What a Goodly Portion is that
then, that the Men of the World do so much rejoice in, and busy themselves
about? Surely, the straitness of thy heart is the cause why these creature good
things seem so large unto thee: They would not appear so big and large, were
not thy heart very strait and norrow. As in a little Vessel a thing will appear
big and great, but in a mighty wide Vessel the same thing appears but small and
little: So when the Lord shall widen and enlarge thy heart by Grace, then all
the things of the World will be little to thee. When God shall open and enlarge
thine eye to see Spiritual things, then will the things below comparatively
appear to be exceeding small. Grace has the Image of God in it, it bears God's
likeness; Now you know what God says of himself, Isa. 40.15. That (...) the
World is but as a drop of a bucket, and as the small dust of the balance. And
so through the Image of God in a Graciou^ Heart, the Soul says thus o^ the
World, as God says of the World, that all the World i^ but as the drop of a
bucket, and the dust of the balance to me. The enlargment of the Heart through
Grace, effects a strange chang^ in the creature; when the min^ is renewed,
there is a kind of transformation wrought. So the Apostle. (...).
Romans 12.2. Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. When the Lord
promised to persuade Japhet to dwell is the Tents of Shem. Genesis 9.27. the words
that is rendered [perswade] it signifies also to (...) * (...) dilatet Deus
enlarge, that he would enlarge the Heart of Japhet. And indeed when God does
convert a Soul, the Lord does enlarge that Soul, does enlarge that Heart, and
therefore all the things of the World are now but little. Grace raises up man's
thoughts on high, and so he looks upon that which is below as little. Indeed if
a man be below here, and looks upon that which is next to him, that has any
bigness in it, it ^hews somewhat great; but if a man were advanced on high upon
the top of a Pinnacle, then that, which seemed great, appears but little to him.
So the men of the World, that lie graveling here below, and the curse of the
serpent is upon them, ( upon thy belly shall thou go, and dust shall thou eat.
Genesis 3.14.) they think the things of the World to be great matters: but Grace
^ifts up the Heart on high to God and Christ, mounts it up to Eternity, and
then they can look upon all these things here below, as mean things; nay, so
altogether mean, as they are consistent with the Eternal hatred of an Infinite
God toward those who do enjoy them.

. VII.
Seventhly, All that the wicke^ have in this World they hol^ but by a weak and
feeble tenure they do not hold their good i^ Capite: Alas, they have no
Interest in the Lord Christ, from whom mercies are rightly derived unto us,
(...), Chrysostom. Hom. 2. ad pop. Antioc.
and who is the head of whom they do not hold. Col. 2.19. They have no right
unto the promises, upon which the claim does lie: They are no^ within the
bounds of the Covenant, by virtue whereof they are issued out. Yet neither do
(...) think the men of the World to be usurpers for what they lawfully get in
the World. I do not think they shall answer merely for their using what they
have merely for their right to use; but they shall answer for their no^ right
using. They have some right unto the things they hold but their Tenure is such
as may make them quake. A right unto ^^ings is diverse, as from Justice;
^reation, Promise and Donation.

1. There is a right from Ju^^ice, when a claim is laid to a thing by Justice:
when it is no ^ore but what is just and equal that we enjoy that, which we ^ay
claim unto. This right unto ^ood all mankind has lost by sin^ing. All have
sinned and come ^hort of this. Sin has shut up all in justice under Vengeance;
made men the object of Gods wrath and hatred, and the Subjects upon whom his
Curse in Justice should be inflicted all to Eternity. For the wages of sin is
death. Romans ^6.23.

2. There is a right from Creation. That right man had when first created, and
in his Innocence it was put into his hands. Let them have dominion (says God)
over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattle,
and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the
Earth. The Dominion gives a right by Creation. This Dominion is derived from
God to Man, and (...) his right comes by Creation yet not simply by Creation,
b^ as so created; that is in God Image after his likeness; Let (...) make man
in our Image, after o^^ likeness, and so let him have Dominion. Genesis 1.26, 27.
No^ this blessed Image of God, which the Apostle tells us was in knowledge.
Col. 3.10. and in righteousness and true holiness. Ephesians 4.24. is by sin
defaced and blurred, and a deformed and ugly shape and likeness in the Image of
Satan in sin is introduced. So that now the right unto the good things of the
World which was by Creation in ma^^ Innocence, is lost and forfeited the Image
of God upon which that right was founded, being through sin blurred and deface
in him.

3. There is a right from Promise and by Covenant. God has now entered into a
new Covenant with his People in and through his Son, and therein promised all
good things to his people. So that the right they have unto any good thing now,
it is by a new Covenant, a better Covenant, (as the Apostle calls it) which was
established upon better promises. Heb. 8.6. The Children of God they now claim
by promise through Christ, in whom All the promises of God are Yea and Amen, 2
Cor. 1.20. The promise is an excellent Tenure by which they hold; and having an
Interest in the Lord Christ, in him they have a right to all the promises, and
so to all that unsearchable good that ^s wrapped up in the promises of Grace.
They may plead a promise, and such Pleas in Christ are always of avail. Now,
though it be by Promise, yet it is by Grace, because it is Faith alone by which
the Soul goes out unto, and lays hold upon the Promise; and which looks at and
acknowledges Grace to be the Fountain of all the Promises, and hence they are
sure to all the seed of God. Therefore it is of Faith (says the Apostle) that
it might be by Grace? to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed,
Romans 6.16. Now the wicked they have not an Interest in the Covenant, they a^^
without God and Christ in the World, they cannot lay clai^ unto the Promises:
Their heart^ condemn them that they have no confidence toward God, neithe^ can
they eye, nor apply his Promises, 1 Jo. 3.21.
For that they hate Instruction, and have cast God's word behind them. And thus
the wicked have not a right to claim from Justice, nor a right from their
Creation, nor the right of Promise: And yet neither are they in their enjoyment
of outward things to be looked upon simpl^ as usurpers: for they have a kin^ of
right, you will say, what right ^s that?

4. There is a right from Do^ation; God is pleased to give unto them: he is a
bountiful and munificent Lord, opens his ^and and lets them for a short ^ime
enjoy. But how? They ^old their Honors, Estates and Comforts, just thus; even
as a man that is condemned to dye, and their being a like Reprieving ^or two or
three days before ^is Execution, the Prince out of ^is Indulgence and Grace,
gives Order to have Provision made ^or him according to his Quali^y, till his
Execution; that if he ^e a Gentleman he shall have ^uch Provision, if be a
Knight, a Nobleman, or a Peer of the Realm, he shall have Provision according
to his Quality. Now no man can say, this man usurps; though he has forfeited
all his right to his Estate and Lands, yet if the King will Indulge him this
refreshment during his Reprieve until his Execution, he (...) no usurper: but
it is a poor rig^^ he has, it is a right from me^ Donation. This he may be sa^
to use, (...). Chry. ad pop. Antioc Hom. 2.
but not properly to e^joy: for that Imports a deligh^full, sweet, orderly use.
Ju^ thus it is with ungodly men (...) reference to their good in the present
World. They have (...) right to their outward comfort^ they shall not be
proceeded against in reference to their rig^^ to use, God as a bountiful Lord
granting to them: but alas, (...) Tenure they hold all by is e^ceeding sad, no
otherwise tha^ as that of a condemned Mal^factour to his present Provisio^
during the time of his Reprie^ till his Execution. It is such ^ right, the very
consideration whereof with its circumstanti^^ occurrents and respective
aggr^vations, were sufficient to sta^le the stoutest heart, and am^ the most
secure and self-confiden^ thoughts of man. If the App^rition of the singers of
a man's ^and-writing upon the Plaster ^f the Wall could so damp all
^elshazzar's joy, and blast the ^uddings of his sweet delight, that he could
not go on to ca^ouse in the Golden Vessels ^rought from the Temple which ^as in
Jerusalem, but his counte^ance was changed, Dan 5.5, 6.
and his thoughts ^roubled him, and the joints of his ^ins were loosed, and his
knees ^note one against another: How ^^all not the consideration of the ^enure,
upon which wicked ^^en hold their comforts, even ^ake away the sweetness of all
their comforts, and fill them as ^ith Gall and Wormwood? So that in the very
fullness of their ^uffiencies they shall be in straits: Job. 20.22. Isa. 38.15.
and all the time of their Re^rieve go on in the bitterness of their Soul, and
a fire not blown con^ume them. Job. 20 26. And yet ^or the most part such is
their ^upid and insensate hardness, ^roceeding from a reprobate sense, that in
the midst of these gifts, and danger too, through wantoncess they corrupt
themselves. Jude. 10.

. VIII.
Eighthly, There is a manifold mixture in all the good things that wicked men
do enjoy: and this mixture does exceedingly impair their excellency, and i^
taking off from their worth* does cause the sweet of them i^ pass away.

There is a fourfold mixture in the Worldly Good of ungodly men; care, grief,
guilt an^ vengeance.

First, There is a mixture (...) care and cumber? Who can number the troubles,
or reckon up the vexatious cares, which d^ attend, and are intrinsecally
impregnate in the enjoyments o^ Worldly men. They have one outward comfort, but
it is attended with many troubles. They labor in the very fire, and they weary
themselves for very vanity. Haback. 2.13. Their toil is incessantly great, and
their cumber grievous. And what do they so earnestly lay out themselves for,
and enlarge their desire as Hell? The prophet tells us, it is but for a burden,
and a troublesome one too, when they have it: it is but to lade themselves with
thick clay. Hab. 2.6. And as their toil and cumber in the procuring is so
extended, that death by them is rather sometimes desired,: So their care to
preserve and keep does no less torture and rack their thoughts. Their care is
such, that according to the Poet, -- Animum nunc huc, nunc dividit illuc
Et rapit in parts varias.
Virg. Aen.

Their minds are divided, and their hearts as torn assunder with corroding
cares, (...). Luke 12.26. (...), quia (...).
whilst they are in the midst of their bodies. They lie down in care, their
rest is in unrest, sleep departs from their eyes; they are fraughted with
fears, tossed with contrivances, hang in suspense and doubt; fear to loose,
care to keep, and contrivances how to increase and augment their Worldly Good
is the whole that is acted on the stage of their lives. And will not all this
exceedingly imbitter their enjoyments? The truth is, all the good things wicked
men do enjoy, will scarce answer the charge, they will not (as we may say) bear
charges; There is so much of trouble and cumber they meet withal here in this
World with their Portion, that the play is not worth their candle: And if so,
where then lies their Treasure? we do not account that as any part of our
treasure, which is allotted for spending money by the way. As if a man goes a
voyage, that which is to bear charges and to be spent by the way, is not
reckoned to be part of his Treasure. Now all we have here in this World is but
spending money to bear our charges, whilst we are on our way toward our longer
home.

Secondly, There Is a mixture of grief and anguish in and with the Worldly Good
of the wicked. They meet with manifold crosses, and invincible disappointments
in their way; their designs are frustrated, purposes are broken off, and their
intendments fail: and they being void of those Graces and Spiritual Endowments,
which alone enable with content to undergo cross occurrences, hence they are
perplexed, and stumble, and fall; and are broken, and snared, and taken. Isa.
8.15. They cannot bear their crosses patiently, they want the Grace of
Patience: nor can they take their afflictions humbly, they know not what
humility means: neither can they undergo their disappointments contentedly,
Phil. 4.11.
they ^ave not learned the way of true contentment. And so they lie open to all
that grief and anguish which any way can be occasionated from affliction
without; or that can seize upon a Soul that is void of a Work of true Grace (for
so their's is) within. The felicity of the wicked is not therefore to be the
Object of any your envy, neither is their State desirable. Will you envy them
the enjoyment of that which is interlarded with so much anguish as imbitters
all the sweet and pleasure; or desire that State wherewith you must have more
gall than gain, more grief than glory? oh, the many Thorns and Briers that are
with them, I mean the cares and cumber: and they dwell amongst Scorpions, in
the midst of grief and anguish. Now there being such a mixture as this in all
they have, surely their Portion is very poor in the Earth, and in their
greatest fullness they can never be accounted truly happy.

Thirdly, There Is a mixture of sin and guilt. The worst of evils is intermedled
with the best good things the wicked do enjoy. Sin it is the worst of evils,
because the cause of all, and sting of all. There Is nothing properly that can
be denominated evil, but so far as sin is in it, and in its respect to sin.
There Is sin and guilt in the enjoyments of the wicked: though the gifts of God
are good in themselves considered, and as from him; yet so far as their hand,
as to acquisition, is found therein, there is a streak that goes along. They
get and heap together, but they heed not how; they increase, but it is that
which is not theirs; they enrich themselves, Hab. 2.9.
but it is by violence; and the spoil of the poor is in their houses. Isa. 3.14.
They covet an evil coveteousness to their house, that they may set their nest
on high, that they may be delivered from the power of evil: and they sin
against their own Soul. Hab. 2.9, 10. All their work is to make provision for
the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof. Romans 13.14. They proceed from evil to
evil, and in their best enjoyments corrupt themselves. Idolatry is all their
worship, and their lust it is their Idol; their God is their belly. Phil. 3.19.
And as they get by wrong, so they do not use aright; the end of mercies is not
aimed at, much less answered by them; but all is perverted another way, so that
their course is evil, Jer. 23.10.
and their f^rce not right. And is not here a stream of guilt going with them
all along? So that let the whole of their race and way be remarked from their
first entry upon their portion, to the time of their close and parting with it,
and you find sin and guilt still to attend, so as every day adds new sin to the
old guilt, to the filling up the measure of their sin, till they become out of
measure sinful. Surely their condition must needs be very miserable, when
their Portion has sin thus for it is soul and ferment.

Fourthly, There Is a mixture of curse and vengeance in the good things of the
wicked. The curse runs along with all their enjoyments; though the bitterness
thereof may not be felt at present, yet it is gone out, and shall seize at
length. A Portion full of deadly Poison drunk off may not presently work, so as
in the very instant of its reception to put forth its venom, but by and by it
does appear. Suppose a man have a Son that Marries richly, he gets an Heir that
is a very rich match, and he has a large Portion with her, and you go and fetch
away the baggs of Gold and Silver that are her Portion, and he huggs himself in
his rich fortune, but if it should prove that every bagg of Gold you have of
your Wives Portion, should have the plague in it, it were but a poor Portion.
Certainly thus it is with all ungodly ones in the World, that whatsoever they
do enjoy, let their comforts be never so delightful, and their enjoyments
never so lovely, all the while they live, and continue wicked, they have the
curse of God that goes along, and makes way for their eternal misery. As true
believers have a blessing of God in outward things, that lead the way of their
eternal good unto them. So the wicked and impenitent have the curse of God
mingled with a^l their Worldly Good which makes way for their eternal torment.

. IX.
Ninthly, Consider the loss unavoidably incurred. Thou have gotten one Portion,
but thou losest a great deal more. Thou have gotten the bagg of Gold, but the
Plague therein, which shall cost thy live: So as there is the loss of life with
the wedge of Gold. Whilst thou have been busied about the gain and chaffer of
the World, Josh. 7.21.
thou have lost a bargain worth ten thousand Worlds. If a man should go to a
Fair or Market, and make some bargain about some petty thing, and afterward
when he comes home, knows, that by not buying such a thing, he has lost a
bargain, that would have made him and his posterity, he has little cause of
rejoicing in that bargain he has made. So though thou have gotten something
that may please and tickle thy vain fancy a little for the present, know thou
have lost a Portion of Infinite worth and value: a Portion the excellency and
dignity whereof no tongue of Man or Angel is able to express. The Devil could
she^ Christ all the Glory of the World in the twinckleing of (...) eye. Luke
4.5.
But he that would set fort the Glory of Heaven had ne^ have Eternity to do it
in. Col. 1.12. 1 Pet. 1.4. 2 Timothy 4.8. 2 Cor. 4.17.
The Inheritance of the Saints in light (...) incorruptible, undefiled, and
that fades not away. Their Crown i^ not only of Righteousness, but (...) Glory
too: and that an exceeding Eternal weight of Glory. But though the Portion of
the Saints be so unutterably great, as i^ cannot be shown in the full
Dimensions of it; yet let us take a scantling view thereof in some few glances,
so far as we may be helped to that sight, from the Nebo of Scripture: Deuteronomy.
32.49.
that so yo^ may guess at the dreadfulness of your loss, when as you fall short
of such a Portion. And

First, As Canaan was the Glory of all Lands flowing with milk and honey. Ezekiel.
20.6. So the Heavenly Inheritance does transcend in Excellency and Glory all
earthly enjoyments Infinit^y more, than Canaan did the ^est of the World; yea,
so far, ^s that they are not meet to bear ^he stress of a simile to shadow and
^et it forth. To what will you ^iken and compare the place of God's glorious
presence, the ^eat of his Throne, and the Habitation of his Honor? What we can
pitch upon with the eye, or reach unto by any either outward or inner senses
falls short of a resemblance for it. Surely then it must needs be glorious
beyond what we are able to imagine of it. The Apostle tells us, Eye has not
seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things
which God has prepared for them that love him. 1 Cor. 2.9.

Secondly, It is such a Portion as is fit and suitable for an Heir of Life and
Glory, the Heir of Heaven and Earth to posess; for the Son of God, the Second
Person in the Blessed Trinity: and therefore called by the Apostle the Kingdom
of his dear Son. (...). Col. 1.13.
Col. 1.13. or of the Son of his love. Surely the Inheritance must needs be
exceeding Glorious, when it is the Inheritance of him, whose Glory is that of
the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth. Joh. 1.14.

Thirdly, It is a Portion that is fit for the Spouse of the Lamb, for the Bride
the Lambs Wife. Revel. 21.9. See a description there of the Glory of this City,
the Brides Habitation, the Holy and Heavenly Jerusalem. ver. 10. having the
Glory of God, and her light clear, ver. 11. high walls, strong gates,
Angelical Guards, ver. 12. precious foundations, ver. 14. measure large, ver.
15. beautiful proportion, ver. 16. golden-street, ver. 21. a blessed temple,
ver. 22. Such a lightsome and Glorious Portion is this Heavenly Inheritance,
that there is no night there, nor darkness: and the Glory and Honor of Kings
and Nations is brought into it, ver. 25, 26, The Prophet Isaiah seems to hint
the Glory of this new Jerusalem in a Prophecy of the Churches Glory in Gospel
times. Behold, I will lay the stones with fair colors, and lay the foundations
with Saphirs: and I will make thy windows of Agates, and thy gates of
Carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones, Isa. 54.11, 12.

Fourthly, It is such a Portion as God does give it unto the Saints to this
very end, to declare what the Infinite Power of God is able to do in raising a
poor Creature to the height of happiness. Surely that must be transcendently
glorious, which is to declare to Angels and all Creatures, what the great God
is able to do to raise a poor Creature to bliss and happiness. Who can think
what this must be, which has such a glorious design as this intended in it? See
the Apostle in the Epistle to the Ephesians to this purpose, That ye may know
(sai^ he) what is the hope of his calling^ and what the riches of the Glory
(...) his Inheritance in the Saints: o^ what is the exceeding greatness o^ his
power to usward who believe Ephesians. 1.18, 19.

Fifthly, It is such a Portion a^ in which God attains unto the great design
that he had from a^ Eternity from making Heaven and Earth, and in the upholding
of them too; it was that h^ might magnify the riches of his Grace toward his
own people whom he had set apart for glory, and might show the exceeding riches
of his Grace in his kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus Ephesians. 2.7. Now
surely this must needs be a Glorious Portion, which in the design thereof, the
whole Fabric of Heaven and Earth is but subservient to. For the Heavens and
the Earth which are now, by the Word of God are kept in store, and reserved
against the Day of Judgment. 2 Pet. 3.7. When there shall be new Heavens and a
new Earth, wherein dwel^eth righteousness. ver. 13. And ^hen shall the great
design that God had from all Eternity be at^ained, when he shall make known ^he
riches of his Glory on the Vessels of mercy, which he had before ^repared unto
Glory. Romans 9.23.

Sixthly, 1 Cor. 15.53, 54.
It is a Portion that the Creature of it self though raised up to a Spiritual,
Incorruptible and Immortal State, yet is never able to undergo; it cannot of it
self bear the weight of that Glory that shall be revealed, but the Infinite
power of God is required to support a Creature to be able to undergo it. The
power of God must be let out to bear up the Creature under that exceeding and
Eternal weight of Glory. And this surely must needs be a State beyond
expression glorious, which would swallow up a Saint in Glory, unless the
concurrent, infinite power of the Almighty did strengthen and enable thereunto.
If the power of God be required to strengthen his people in patience and
long-suffering under their afflictions* strengthened with all might according to
his Glorious Power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness. Col.
1.11. How much more is that power requisite to bear them up under that Glory
which shall be revealed, which is of a far more exceeding and Eternal weight;
than their light affliction, which is but for a moment, ca^ be. 2 Cor. 4.17.
The Apostle speaking of this Glory of God expresses it thus; who only hat^
Immortality, dwelling in the ligh^ which no man can approach unto, whom no man
has seen, nor can see^ to whom be Honor and Power everlasting. 1 Timothy 1.16.
No man of himself has seen, or is able to see; but Power is his, and from him,
to enable them to approach his greatness: and Honor is his, and from them, to
extol him for his grace and goodness.

Lastly, And all this must needs ^e now to all Eternity. This ^ortion as it is
large and rich, and excellent; so it is lasting. And this is the property that
makes precious things to be of ^rue worth indeed; when they are of a lasting
Nature and will endure. The Transiency of the ^weetest delights, and most
plea^ant enjoyments is that, which ^o much, in a serious Judgment, derogates
from their val^e; and renders them less desirable, in that through their
fluidness they will not hold. Could the wicked man, in the midst of his
sinful, yet most pleasing delights propound this Question to himself, and
rationally take, and considerately weigh the answer: yea, but will these things
hold? will these sports and pastimes last? will this course continue? shall it
be always thus with me? how would this give check to his full Career, and
curb the rains let loose before him? how would it blast, and as a Worm at the
root cause all the Harvest of hi^ joy to whither? This would ^^tedate the
Prophets threatnin^ who tells him that his Harve^ shall be an heap in the day
of grie^ and of desperate sorrow. Isaiah. 5* 11. And that his root shall be
ro^tenness, and his blossom go up as dus^ Isaiah. 5.24. And the mo^ when he
considers what a Portion he has lost, which would have e^dured for ever: the
which ^ Moth nor Rust could corrupt, Math. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.4.
no^ Thieves break through and steal^ an Inheritance Incorruptible, Undefiled,
and that never fades away We read that when Esau did bu^ hear Isaac his Father
tell what ^ blessing he had given unto Jacob then Esau fell a weeping: oh, Esau
he fell a weeping, Genes. 27.37, 38.
when he saw what a blessing he was fallen short of. Oh that God would now
strike upon the Hearts o^ men, that have so little minded any thing, but the
things of this present World, that they may duly consider what a Blessed
Portion they hazard the Etern^l loss off. Oh. thou have cause ^o weep did
thou truly know ^hy loss and State. That which ^hou have heard of the good
things that the Lord has reserved to ^ll Eternity for his Saints, is but (...)
scantling hint of what might ^e given, and all Infinitely short ^f such an
Infinitely Blessed ^ortion. Now compare but that ^ith what is thy Portion, and
that is like to be thy Portion: and thou have cause to weep.

. X.
Lastly, What is like to be thy and, thou that have all thy good things in this
present World? That Is a matter of momentous ^onsideration. If indeed thou
^ouldest ruffle it out, and swag^er here, and enjoy thy hearts ^esire, and
there an end; it ^ere somewhat. And alas the ^allantoe's of the World never
question, but that their day (...) endure for ever, that to mo^^ shall be as
this day, and much m^ abundant. Isa. 56.12. Oh, b^ there is somewhat else
remains (...) afterward. This their swe^ must have a sower sauce: the^ vomit
up their sweet morsel^ and it proves bitterness in the latter end. Take but a
view ^ some particulars, and enter wi^ David into the Sanctuary of Ge^ and then
you shall understand the end. 2 Samuel 4.26. Jerem. 2.19
Psalm. 73.17. And

First, Oh, the perplexity o^ Spirit that Worldly men have when they come to
dye. H^ that has made Mammon his God when Death Arrests him, and h^ shall see
an end of all his Worldly Comforts, Quantumlibet delectant jactantia
divitiarum, and tumor bonorum, and vorago popinarum, and bella Theatricorum,
etc. Aufert omnia ista una febricula, and adhuc viventibus totam falsam
beatitudinem subtrahit; remanet manis and saucia conscientia. Aug. de Catechiz.
Rud. c. 16.
how wi^ he then be perplexed when he must bid farewell to all; now farewell
House and Lands and Friends and Acquaintance, and al^ merry Meetings, I shall
never have comfort in you any more. Oh, then Death it will be truly the King
of terrors to him. Job. 18.14. It was so with Adrian the Emperor when he was
to die; Animula, quae nunc abibis in loca? etc. O thou my Soul! my Soul!
whether art thou going? thou shall never have more Jests, nor be jocund any
more: O my poor pallid Soul, where art thou going? So a man that has all his
Good in this present World may say at his Death, whether is this poor Soul of
mine a going? I have lived here thus many years, and I have had many merry
Meetings; I have eaten the fat, and drunk the sweet, and gone in the best array:
I have had a day, and oh, that I were as in months past; but now my day is
gone, what shall become of me? I am now launching out into the black Ocean of
Eternity, where is darkness and dimness of anguish, oh, what shall become of me?
what Peace have I now, when all is gone? Oh, the perplexed cogitations,
confused reasonings and tumultuating thoughts that the Spirit of a Worldly Man
shall be tossed withal, when Death shall arrest, and dragg him out of his
dwelling. Oh then, what would he not give, do, or suffer for a little Peace but
Death's answer to him, will be like that of Jehu, (driving furiously) to
Joram's Messengers what have thou to do with Peace? turn thee behind me. Little
does he now think of it, but the Lord sees that his day is coming. Psalm. 37.13.
Though he see not his day a coming: yet the Lord sees that day is coming.
Latimer has a story in one of his Sermons that he Preached before King Edward,
of a rich man, 2 Kin. 10.18.
that when he lay upon his sick bed, there came one to him, and told him, that
certainly by all the reasons they can judge, he was like to be a man for
another World, a dead man; As soon as ever he hears but these words, (they are
Latimer's words: I only repeat them as his words; and they were before a King,
and so in due reverence spoke) they will not be too broad words, nor too rude,
I hope, for us to hear, (as soon as ever he did but hear this) what, must I dye
says he? send for a Physician: wounds, sides, heart, must I dye? and thus he
goes on, and there could nothing be got from him, but such horrid expressions,
must I dye? must I dye, and go from all these? here was all, here is the end of
this man, that has all his Good things in this present World. Another when he
lay upon his sick bed, calls for his baggs, and lays a bagg of Gold to his
Heart, and then bids them take it away says he it will not do. Another when he
lay upon his sick bed, his Friends came to him, and said, what lack you? what
would you have? would you have any Beer? would you be shift to the other side,
or to some other part of the bed? want you any thing? oh, no (says he) I want
only one thing, Peace of Conscience, that I would have: It is not Beer, nor
Friends, nor any easy Pillow I want, but Peace of Conscience; my thoughts are
troubled, my mind perplexed, Conscience is unquiet, and my Heart fails. Oh
consider now, whether there be not like to be perplexity in your Spirits, when
you come to dye. Let due forethoughts of your latter end now take up your
Hearts.

Secondly, Then you are to give an account for all, though (as I told you
before) not to account for the right to use, but for not right using of what
you have. Then you are to come up upon account: Here you go on to buy and sell,
and get gain, and are jovial and pleasant; you spend your days in wealth and
mirth, Jam. 4.13. Job. 21.13.
and in a moment go down to the Grave: but then an account is to be made for
all. A sad reckoning is at hand, and such as (alas) they little think of. As a
many of Prodigal spenthrifts met together do in the Tavern carouse all care
away, and amidst their spuming healths never think of the shot, or reckoning
that is to pay. Or as some wretchless Malefactors, desperately careless and
prodigal of their Lives, though Hue and Cry be at their heels, and the avenger
of blood pursue them, and no less lie at stake than their very lives; yet in an
Ale-shop met together, there they bench away all their cares, and drown their
fears; and never think of the reckoning they have to make, nor dread the
Officer at hand to take them: The Bar, Impii praesumendo sperant, and sperando
pereunt.
where they must hold up the Hand, and be arraigned, is not at all forethought
of by them. Even thus it is with the men of the World, amidst their sickly
healths they dread no evil, nor ever call their account to mind: but come ye,
say they, and I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our selves with strong drink,
and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant. Isaiah. 56.12. Oh,
sad will be the reckoning which such men have to make, and dreadfuull the
account when they are called to it. Do but now think with your selves, if you
have now so much as you cannot reckon, how then will you be able to reckon for
it: If now you have so much as you cannot count, how then will you be able to
give an account of what you have; especially when you shall be hurried thereto
at unawares, and have had no thoughts thereof beforehand.

Thirdly, Dreadful is the Portion of these men at the Day of Judgment. Oh, the
shame and confusion that will then be upon the Faces of the men of the World!
How will they then be confounded in themselves, and desire the Mountains to
fall on them, and the Rocks to cover them? Rev. 6.16. Jam. 2.3.
especially when they shall see their poor neighbors, or such, whom (when in
the World) they would have disdained to have set at their Footstool, or with
the Dogs of their Flock, taken up with Christ into Glory, and themselves cast
out: when these shall stand on the right hand, and they (as Goats) shall be set
on the left. Mat. 25.33
Perhaps a poor Boy or Servant in the House shall be advanced to Glory, and you
that are their great Masters shall be cast out Eternally: Oh, what an Infinite
shame and confusion would this be to you? what will you say? how will you
change your minds? Oh, now I see what it is to trust in God; and not to trust
in him. Now I see that there is a vast difference between a true believer and
an impenitent wretch. Now we may discern between the righteous and the wicked,
between him that serves God, Mal. 3.18.
and him that serves him not. These are happy that would trust for the future,
that durst take God's Word and Promise for their Portion and Inheritance: but I
miserable to all Eternity, that drust not trust him. And then the conclusion
what will it be? the Royal Prophet tells you, Psalm. 11.6. upon the wicked the
Lord shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest, this shall
be the Portion of their cup. Here Is the Portion of the ungodly at the last;
fire and brimstone is upon them, and it is rained down, so as it falls more
violently: and the Lord does it, and therefore it is an horrible tempest; and
their condition is denoted more wretched, in that they cannot escape, for in
snares rained down they are entangled; and moreover to add to this their woe
and misery, and make it out of measure miserable; They are not only to have
this fire and brimstone on them, but in them too: for all this is put into
their cup, and they are to drink it? and so to drink it, as not to leave the
dreggs behind, but to wring them out, and drink them. Psalm. 75.8. And this
shall be the Portion of their cup. They have had a Goodly Portion in the World,
which they have abused, their cup did overflow; and now they shall have as
dreadful a Portion at the Day of Judgment: for this shall be the Portion of
their cup. The servant that eats and drinks with the drunken, and so does
abuse the mercies put into his hand, shall have his Portion appointed him with
the Hypocrites: Mat. 24.51.46.
there shall be weeping and gnashing Teeth. Think but of one Text and I have
done with this particular, Job. 27.8. What is tht hope of the Hypocrite, though
he has gained, when God takes away his Soul? Note hence, there are many
Hypocrites that aim to get in the World, and cannot, God crosses them, and
disappoints them in their devices; and will not let their covered intentions
prosper: Well, but suppose they aim at gain, and get it; and so attain what
they do desire: yet what hope has the Hypocrite, though he has gained,
though he has grown never so rich, and gained what he did desire, when God
takes away his soul, (...) Si evellat Deus animam ejus; Job. 27.^. Luk 12.20.
plucking it (as it were) in anger from him? Thou fool, this night thy Soul
shall be required of thee: Then whose shall those things be which thou have
provided? Where Is thy gain, and what is thy hope, when thy Soul is plucked away?
The Portion thou have gained is gone, and another woeful Portion there is
behind, which now thou art to enter upon to all Eternity.

Now know that this time is coming, it will be ere long, and then perhaps this
Text of mine may ring in your ears; when you lie upon your sick beds, and days
of weakness come upon you, and your thoughs rationally work about, and are
fixed upon your latter end, then this argument may come into your mind, and
conscience preach this over again unto you; telling you, I heard such a time
there were a Generation of Men, who had all their Good things in this present
World, but after this Life was over, were never to have any more. And now I am
afraid I am one of them, and so there is an end of my Portion: only I must go to
my other Portion, that will be very dreadful, How can I bear the thoughts? Oh,
I die; I perish, I am consumed with dying. Number. 17.12, 13.

CHAP. VIII. Wherein is endeavored to mark out who, or what manner of persons
they are, that are like to have all their Good in this present World.
THe fifth particular proposed in the entrance upon this point, and for
carrying on the discourse, was to endeavor to mark out (so far as may be) who
that man or woman is, that in such a condition is like to have all their Good
things in this present World. For every one is apt to put it off from
themselves, and to shift the charge (whilst in general) upon another. Every one
is ready to go away and say, I hope it is not I, I hope that God has a better
Portion for me. We are unwilling to look upon our selves as the persons in
particular to be concerned, if the thing spoken of be represented as evil, or
under the face of danger. Fain would we catch at what is good as belonging to
us, though we have no Title to it: and loath are we to apply unto our selves the
evil, as having nothing to do therewith, though the thing it self do
immediately concern us. And therefore as a narrow, impartial search into the
state of our hearts and ways, is our undoubted duty: so help for the carrying
on this search, and the discovery of our state cannot be but exceeding useful.
Now let us endeavor to enquire and search out, who that man or woman is that
is like to have all his, or her Good in this present World: that, living and
dying in such a condition, as I am now about to speak of; in the present
condition wherein he is, if there be not a saving change wrought upon him, is
certainly the man, to whom the Lord pronounces it this day, that his Portion
is in this present World. Now who is he?

. I.
Answer,

First, That Man to whom God gives nothing in this Life, but what merely
belongs to this Life, that is the man apparently who is like to have all his
Portion here. If God give thee an estate, and load thee with outward mercies,
yet if he give thee not somewhat besides thy Estate, a Principle that is a seed
of Eternal Life in thee here in this World, certainly he never intends Good to
thee in the World to come. If thou have health and strength of body, vigor and
ingenuity of the mind, with a rare accomplished ripeness of the faculties of
the Soul; if thou have Power and Authority in thy hand, with an honorable
respect from those with whom thou do converse; If a rich and ample
confluence of all outward mercies requisite to felicitate the Life of man meet
upon thee, so as nothing's wanting of all that thy Soul desires: yet if by a
work of regeneration there be not here a Principle and seed of Eternal Life
laid and implanted in thee, John. 4.14.
and a Well of water springing up into everlasting Life; but thou live and
dyest in the midst of these enjoyments without the earnest of an Eternal
Inheritance upon thy Heart: certainly thou art the man who have all thy good
things here, and never art to expect any good hereafter. For those to whom God
intends good hereafter, he gives to such an earnest of that Eternal Good here
in this World, by putting a Principle, that is a seed of Eternal Life, into
them. There are many men have a great deal in this World, they are rich, and
fat and full, and they say, they hope God will be merciful to them in the
World to come. Now this is a certain truth, that man who is a stranger to
Spiritual mercies in this World, God will deny Eternal Mercy to him in the
World to come. The one has an Infallible dependence upon the other: Where there
is not a work of true saving Grace, there shall never be a State of Glory.
Grace must go before, or Glory can never follow after. It is against that
Divine Order that God has fixed, in Order to Eternal things, to give Glory to
Graceless Souls. He gives Glory but Grace too* The Lord will give Grace and
Glory. Psalm. 84.11. first Grace, and then Glory. This therefore should be thy
care, does God increase my Estate in this World? say, oh that the Lord would
give me a proportionable measure of Grace too, else it is nothing. It will be
nothing to my advantage to have an Estate, unless I have Grace also aright to
use it. Say, Lord thou give me here a great Estate, if thou give me not a
proportionable measure of Grace to use it to thy Glory, I had better have been
without it. Is this your care? Let me put it to your conscience? Are you as
solicitous for Grace to use your Estates aright, as you are industrious for the
gaining of them? As your Estates increase, does your care in like manner grow,
and are you earnest at the Throne of Grace, for the like due improvement of them
to the Glory of the Donor? If this be your course, Luke 10.42. Phil. 1.6.
it is a good argument you have chosen the better part for your Portion, and
that there is a good work begun in you, which will be performed until the day
of Christ. And that you have laid up in store for your selves a good Foundation
against the time to come, 1 Timothy 6.19
that you may lay hold on Eternal Life. But now if there be no work upon the
Soul in Order to the Life to come, it is not all a man's Worldly comforts and
enjoyments here, that can assure him, in the least, of an interest in Eternal
Mercies: but undoubtedly he is the man that has h^ Good things here.

. II.
Secondly, You may examine b^ the workings of your Hearts about your present
Portions. Se^ the frame and temper of yo^ Hearts about your Worldly Comforts:
as whether you^ Hearts terminate in what yo^ do enjoy. A Carnal Heart taken up
with its enjoyments. The Creature is its resting place. ^ desires no more, can
look no further than to the things of thi^ present World. Whereas one that is
Godly, and has his Portion beyond these things, though he enjoy the Good
things of this Creation, yet he looks beyond it, and God alone is the Adequate
Object of his Soul, it is God alone that gives his Soul satisfaction. When he
can taste the Love ^f God in the Creature, and see ^he goodness of God therein,
it ^s so far sweet unto him; or else ^t is dry and barren, and yields ^o more
taste nor relish, than ^here is (as Job says) in the white ^f an egg. Job. 6.6.
Thus the rich man ^akes up in his riches, and speaks ^o his Soul, take thine
ease, Luke 12.19
thou ^ast much goods laid up for many ^ears: He looks no further, ^here's his
all. Though the language of Esau and Jacob seems ^o be the same, yet there is a
great difference in the ground of their replies: Says Esau, concerning the
present, sent by his Brother Jacob to him, I have enough, my Brother, keep that
thou have unto thy self. But Jacob replies, Nay, I pray thee: receive my
present at my hand, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I
have enough. Genesis 33.9, 10, 11. Says Esau, I have enough, and so says Jacob
too. Yet the difference was great; for Esau looked no further than to the
Worldly Blessing; he had Sheep and Goats, and Cows, and Camels enough; this was
the enough that he meant, here he terminated, and he looked no further* But
Jacob looks beyond these things, his eye pierces through the Creature, and
therefore saie^ he, God has dealt graciously with me, and I have enough, or I
have all. ver. 11. Jacob saw the goodness and love of God in all his
enjoyments, and this gave him satisfaction: because he saw God dealt graciously
with him, therefore he had enough; or as the Hebrew men bear it, he had all;
all that was truly desirable, or that he could desire. Esau had the (...) Est
mihi multum (...) sunt mi hi omnia. Genesis 33.9.11.
multum; but Jacob had the omnia. Esau had the good things of this World and no
more, and therefore he had but multum; But Jacob had the good things of this
present World, and of the other too in promise, and therefore he had the omnia.
The things of this World were enough for Esau; But the things of this World
without the other could not be enough for Jacob: and therefore says Jacob I
have all: For God has dealt graciously with me. And as the tempers of their
minds were thus vastly different, so was their Blessing in its Intrinsic
Nature too. It seems much-what to be the same as to Worldly enjoyments: The Dew
of Heaven, and the fatness of the Earth, and plenty of Corn and Wine, was
Jacob's Blessing. Genesis 27.28. And it was Esau's too, Genesis 27.28.
thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the Earth, and of the Dew of Heaven from
above. ver. 39. The Blessings you see thus far to be much the same: and yet
herein they greatly differ; for Jacob had his with a God give thee, ver. 28.
God give thee of the Dew of Heaven: but now Esau's is only that his dwelling
shall be the fatness of the Earth; there is no God give thee in it; and
therefore properly it was not a Blessing, but a Prediction rather of Esau's
future State. If Esau got it, no matter how he came b^ it, by his Sword. ver.
40. or any way whatever; no matter whether he saw God therein, or no; he cares
not; no, not he, so he got it, and had it, it would give him satisfaction: the
bare enjoyment of the thing would serve his turn, and be enough for him, thus
Esau's Heart does terminate in the Creature. But now Jacob, though he have
never so much of outward Blessings, yet his Heart is still beyond them, and
unless he can see God's mercy and loving kindness in them, [a God give thee]
they are not enough to yield him the least of satisfaction: he cannot say he
has enough, unless he can taste the Love of God therein, and feel his mercy,
and then because God gives him, and deals graciously with him, therefore upon
that account, and that only he can say, he has en^ugh. Thus it is with a
Wordly Carnal Heart, as with Esau; it terminates in the Creature; and enjoys
what it has for it self, it enjoys the Creature, and runs away, and never
looks for God therein at all. But a Godly Heart (as Jacob) looks at the root of
all; it may be he has but a little in this World, yet he minds the root and
rise; the Love of God, and ^he Covenant of Grace, and God ^herein dealing
graciously with him; from this root his mercies ^pring, which (he seeing it)
gives ^im satisfaction. When a man ^akes a Potion of Physic, he ^uts it into
Posset-ale, the Posset-^le is not the thing that works, though it is that, that
is the ^reater part, but it is the Phy^ck in it. So it is the goodness ^f God
that satisfies a Gracious ^eart, and not the Creature that is Operative so much
upon (...), as to the working out its sa^isfaction.

. III.
Thirdly, Observe the going out of your Hearts toward your Worldly Comforts,
whether they are carried toward them with full bent and strength of desire, as
if you could not subsist nor live without them, but they are as all in all unto
you. These are the persons who have their Portion here. If you make your belly
to be your God, your end will be destruction. Phil. 3.19.
If the Comforts of the Creature be your only good, God will destroy both you
and them. Meats for the belly (says the Apostle) and the belly for meats: but
God shall destro^ both it and them. 1 Cor. 6.13. Look how your hearts follow
after the things of this World whether they bear toward the^ with full bent or
no. That (...) that has his Heart swallowe^ up in the things of this World
shall be like Corah, Dathan (...) Abiram, that were swallowed up in the Earth.
Are your morning thoughts contriving, and the vigor of your Spirits spending
themselves about your Worldly Comforts? does the strength of your Hearts move
and work toward them, as the Historian spakes of Otho that Roman Abso^om?
Adorare vulgus jacere oscula, and omnia serviliter pro imperio -- Tacit Hist.
l. 1. Mat. 6.21.
Then if the things of the Earth be a Gulf thus to swallow up your Hearts,
there is another Gulf to swallow you up hereafter. The man who has his Portion
in ^his World, his Heart will be with his Portion; where his trea^ure is, there
will his Heart be also. This Generation the Prophet ^arkes out, and reproves.
Isa. 55.^. (...). Aristot. polit. l. 7. cap. 7.
Wherefore (says he) do you ^pend money for that which is not ^read? and your
labor for that which satisfies not? And there ^ere that labored in the very
fire, and wearied themselves for very ^anity. Hab. 2.13. Demas for^ook the
Apostle having loved this ^esent World. 2 Timothy 4.10. And the Apostle says
expressly, that if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.
^ Joh. 2.15. Surely then, those who thus spend their money and labor, and
weary themselves in vain; who love this present World, and have not the love
(...) God in them; shall have none (...) the good things of his love hereafter;
they may content them selves with their present Portion here. Therefore if your
hear^ be carried out in full bent an^ strength after the things of t^^^ World,
so that they are as you God and your Good, and the desire of your Souls, it is
an arg^ment you are the persons (...) have all your good things here.

. IIII.
Fourthly, Consider how t^ loss of the things of this Wor^ does affect your
Hearts. Wh^ cross Providence do occur, (...) you are thwarted in your world
designs and hopes, how do such dispensations take with you? when God takes away
from you the desire of your eyes as with a stroke, how does it work upon you?
Do not you count your self undone, and are utterly disconsolate? Do not you cry
out of your selves as comfortless, utterly comfortless when you have lost some
Worldly Comforts? Does not your health and strength and the vigor of your
minds abate? And is not the joy of your Heart gone, and you as an undone man.
Why? what is the matter? I have lost some part of my Estate, I am utterly
disappointed in that, which I thought ^ had had most sure. Oh, this argues your
Heart to be exceeding Carnal, and that you are strangers to the true riches.
For one that is Gracious, though he may have some crosses, yet no ^osses at
all, because he enjoys all in God; whatever may be looked upon as a loss unto
him, he finds it fully to be made up in God, he has God to make up all his
losses. There is such a fullness of good in God, and this so overflows toward
him, that his Heart, with more than a considerable satisfaction, takes up here,
though crossed in other things. As a man travailing in his journey meets with
rain and wind, and storms, which beat upon him; but by and by he takes shelter
in his Inn, or comes unto his own Mansion House, and there he is at rest and
quiet: though the weather be tempestuous, and season stormy, yet there he
enjoys a sweet repose, and his weather-beaten Spirit is at ease in the comforts
of such refreshment. Or as the Mariner upon the Alt and open Seas may be
tossed by contrary winds and waves, yet his desired Haven (when safely
attained) fully answers his weary Soul with the incomes of joy and quiet; then
are they glad, because they are quiet: So he brings them unto their desired
Haven. Psalm. 107.30. Even so a Gracious Heart meets with many rubs and crosses
in its way, but there is a Divine Hospitium ever at hand, in which there is a
ready entertainment, and this gives ease and comfort through Faith at present:
and there is an Haven of rest, which in the end will more than fully pay for
all; the hopes whereof for the present are so influential, that (if well
grounded) they are able to stay and bear up the Heart. So that Gracious Souls
abide under the shadow of the Almighty: Psalm. 91.1.
and may safely say, Psalm. 32.7.
thou art my hiding place, thou shall preserve me from trouble, thou shall
compass me about with songs of deliverance. And the truth is, if thou were
truly Godly, whatsoever afflictions thou meetest withal (as we say a man may
put all in his eye, so) you might put all your crosses in your eyes: you are so
far from being undone by them. But now whereas upon thy Worldly Losses thou art
ready to cry out, undone, undone, it is a strong argument thou art the man who
have all thy good things here below.

. V.
Fifthly, Examine the suitableness of the things of the World to your Hearts.
Whether these be not the things between which, and your minds there is a full
correspondence: whether you bless not your selves in these, as it your
happiness. Many say, who will show us any good? Psalm. 4.6, 7.
And all the good they enquire after is but corn and wine, and oil, and the
increase thereof: and this gives joy and gladness to their Hearts, and is the
only adequate and suitable good they look for. The Lord by the Prophet
complains against Ephraim, that in their assembl^es, they sought not him, but
his; not the good in him, but good things from him: Hos. 3.5.
They did not fear the Lord and his goodness, but their corrupt natures did
take occasion from his goodness to rebel against him. They assemble themselves
(says he) for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. Hos. 7.14. Corn and
wine and oil were the only suitable things to their Hearts: Hos. 7.14.
Worldly Comforts were the adequate Objects of their Souls. These they loved;
after these they sought, these things were the burden of their solemn
services, and lay at the root of all their religious duties. The Ivy (we know)
will clasp about a rotten tree, and cannot be taken from it without tearing: So
the Heart of a Worldling will clasp about these rotten comforts, as the only
agreeable thing to it, and it is hard to divide between them. Sometimes you may
hear them tell with joy, when they are a chewing the Cud upon their stolen
dainties, oh, we were in such a place, and we were so jocund and merry, and had
the bravest meeting that could be. Oh, it was a merry meeting. And what was
there? why, there was singing, and ranting, and roaring, and cheating, and
couzening, and swearing, and drinking, and blaspheming the name of God, and yet
it was the bravest meeting could be: Oh, say they it was a gallant meeting, How
do men delight to chew the Cud in contemplative reviews of their unjustly
gotten gain? Thus stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
pleasant to them. Prove, 9.17. Does not these things evidently argue that a
Worldly Good and Sensual Comforts are the only suitable things to your Hearts?
When did you ever come from an Ordinance of God, and say, Oh, it was a brave
day to me, the Lord has spoken to my Heart this day? This day I have tasted
that feast of fat things, those wines on the Lees well refined? Isa. 25.6. Did
you never come from the Word with as merry a Heart, atd could rejoice for it
with as much joy, and more, as you did from a merry meeting? oh then, you may
fear, you are the men that have all your Good things here in this present World.

. VI.
Sixthly, Examine, wherein thou do account the chiefest Good of thy Estate
and Worldly enjoyments to consist. Thy Estate (may be) is greater than it was
before; or it is more than thy brother has. Now what do thou account to be
the good of thy Estate? Do thou thus reason, and make these arguments upon
thy Estate? Now I may live in better fashion than I could before; Now I may
have more freedom than I had before: Now I may have my ease, and my own mind,
and satisfy my sensual appetite more than I did before? I may say to my Soul,
Now Soul thou may take thine ease, Luke 12.19.
and be merry? Now I may have more credit in the World than I had before? Are
these the reasonings of thy Heart? If it be so, let me tell thee in the
language of the Prophet, that thou rejoycest in a thing of naught. Amos. 6.13.
And yet, alas, is not this a truth, that some of your Hearts, if they were
thoroughly searched, this would be the language of them? that you rejoice in
your Estates, because by them you have fuel ministered unto your lusts? Auro
parie^es, auro loquearia fulgent ca^ita columnarum, and ^udus atque ^suriens
ante fores nostras Christus in paupere moritur, Hieron. ad Gaudentium.
A poor man has not so much fuel for his uncleanness, as you have: nor so much
fuel for his lust of pride, as you have; nor so much fuel for his lust of
malice and revenge, as you have; your Worldly enjoyments give you an advantage
to the satisfaction of your lusts, beyond what poor men, destitute of such
enjoyments, have. Do not many rich men account the blessing, the good, and
happiness of their Estates to consist in this very thing, that now they have a
more ample mean and opportunity for the venting, or answering of their lust,
than ever they had before, or than others have? For a poor man cannot lay out
so much money on an unclean wretch, as you can do; a poor man cannot go abroad,
and drink, as you can do; and you rejoice in this. Now if this man have not
his Portion here, what man has? The Lord in mercy strike such a man's Heart in
time. But now on the other side, a gracious heart, when God blesses him in this
World with an in-come of outward mercies, though there be but a little grace,
yet it will be working thus: The Lord has raised my condition above my
brother, and therein the Lord gives me a larger opportunity to do him service,
than my brother has, or than I had before: there is such a poor man, he is an
honest man, but God knows he can do but little in the place where he is, he
has but little means: but God has given me means, and this enlarges my
opportunity to do God service, and for this my Soul blesses God: I account the
happiness and good of my Estate to consist in this, that now I may be of more
use, and do God more service, and bring in a greater income unto his glory in
doing good to my needy neighbor than otherwise I could have done, or my poor
brother can. You that are rich men, examine the workings of your hearts as to
the good of your Estates, wherein you account it lies. If you find them work in
this gracious way and manner, it will be a blessed testimony, that God gives
you a Portion here, and intends another Portion for you hereafter in the World
to come.

. VII.
Seventhly, Observe what that thing is you strive to make most sure, and
endeavor to guard against these dangers whereto you fear it may be obnoxious.
What is the thing you labor most to secure your interest in, that you may
maintain a clear and indisputable title to it? That which you strive to make
most sure is the thing you count your happiness chiefly to consist in: and what
you are most industriously bent to secure is your choicest good. Now are not
your lands and livings, your goods and credits the matter of your chief care?
Do not your thoughts most work about these, how to make them sure to your
selves, your heirs and posterity? Are not these the great concerns of your
Hearts, how to make good and maintain your title to your Possessions and
Estates? Is not this your inward thought, Psalm. 49.11.
that your houses might continue for ever, and dwelling places to all
generations, to call your lands after your own names; when in the mean while
your precious Souls ( more worth than Worlds) lie by neglected? How it fares
with them you regard not, or at least not so much; there is (...) * (...) misit
maciem in anima eorum. Psalm. 106.15.
leanness sent into them, and you are not affected with it: they prosper not,
and yet you lay it not to Heart. Earthly concerns are your great business, but
your Immortal Souls you overlook, and heed not to make sure their Eternal
interest. You are not solicitous about the pardon of your sin, and the
assurance of God's love in Christ; about renewing and confirming Grace, and the
great business of your Salvation; to make your calling and election sure, 2
Pet. 1.10
and to secure your interest in Eternal mercies, these are things the farthest
off from your thoughts. All you have to hold by, when these things are spoken
of, or dinted upon the mind, are some faint, weary, Soul-troubling sighs; or
cold, fruitless wishes; or dead, liveless hopes that God will be merciful; but
how, or when, or upon what account you know not, nor much care; so you can but
get these more sad and grievous thoughts wiped off, and your Hearts acquitted
of them; the new Moon and Sabbath gone: Amos. 8.5.
these solemn thoughts away, that is your desire. But as for the state of your
Souls, Luke 13.24 Mat. 11.12 Luke 16.16 2 Pet. 1.5. (...) Significat animi
intentionem. i. e. A serious beating ones thoughts about the business of
Eternity. Jansen. Beza. Gerhard.
and their Eternal welfare, you never strive about it, The Kingdom of Heaven
suffers no violence by you: you are not of the number of those that [press]
into it: and instead of giving all diligence to make sure your Eternal Estate;
you make sure to give none at all, whilst all your care, endeavors, and
strength of your Spirits is laid out about securing your Worldly contents, and
no pains nor diligence is thought too much, or grievous which is employed this
way, but the interest of your Souls lies by. Now if these be not the men that
have all their good in this present World? what men have?

. VIII.
Eighthly, Consider what it is thou do admire most men for, and for which
thou look upon them as happy. Is it because such a man has so much commings
in by the year; such possessions, houses, furniture; such goods, shop, trading;
such credit, esteem, and repute in the World, that therefore thou accountest
him as happy? Or he is a man of great interest, power and authority; he is also
to do; what not? and therefore thou do admire him? Never weighing him in
the balance of the Sanctuary, nor considering, whether or no there be a work
of Grace upon his Heart, which is the only thing truly valuable; but
overlooking this accountest him happy for his Worldly income and enjoyments.
This is an argument that thou art in the dark as to the true spiritual riches
to this very time. Perhaps the men thou do admire upon these accounts are
vile persons, being void of Grace, and the true saving knowledge of God in
Christ, and yet thou do admire them. Art thou not carnal? Is not the World
thy God? Do thou not herein show thy self like unto them, and one of them?
Otherwise, thou would not admire them thus, as happy? and upon mere Worldly
accounts call them blessed? Certainly God speaks exceeding contemptibly of all
ungodly ones in the World: though they be never so great in regard of outward,
and admired in the eyes of men; yet, if they be ungodly, they are contemptible
in his eyes. In the 11th of Daniel 21 verse, it is said, A vile person shall
stand up: who is this vile person? Interpreters generally consent in this, that
it is meant of Antiochus Epiphanes, that was a mighty great Prince, such a
Prince as when the Samaritans did write unto him, they writ, Antiocho Magno
Deo, So the Persian Emperors usurped Religious Worship: vid. Brison. de Regno
Pers. l. 1. p. 8. 14. The like Insolence we find in the Babylonish Monarchs.
Isa. 14.14. and 47.7, 8.
to Antiochus the great God, and his very name shows him to be a great one, it
is as much as Antiochus the illustrious, or the famous: and yet when the Holy
Ghost speaks of him, it is Antiochus a vile person. The wicked are vile in
God's eyes, notwithstanding all their greatness in the eyes of the World, and
though there is an honorable respect due to be paid unto them according to
the power and place wherein providence has set them in this World, which upon
that account they may claim; yet if they are not gracious, they want the
Principal ground of true honor, the Honor that comes down from Heaven and
which will endure for ever. But now can thou look upon even those that are
poor and mean in this world, that have the least Portion here, yet as most
happy creatures, because the Lord gives them the Grace of his Spirit: And think
thus, well, it is true, I have a greater Estate than such a poor man, that is my
neighbor, or than such a poor man; But God knows he far outstrips me in inward
excellencies: I have more of outward riches, than he, which only serve the
body: but he has more of the [true] inward riches, which only serve the soul.
Luke 16.11
He does God more service than I do; he prays more, and more heartily in one
day, than I do in a whole year. Oh the Lord has other manner of prayers, and
sighs come from his poor cottage, than ever he had from my brave building: it
was never so perfumed with praises, as his poor cottage is. The Church of God
is the better for his prayers. Oh I count him happy he lives by Faith; he will
believe in the fire and water: Psalm. 66.12.
whereas cannot believe on my bed o^ down. Though he is poor i^ the World, yet
he is rich i^ Faith; and God has more Honor from him, than he has from me. In
my family (perhaps) there is cursing, James. 2.5
and blaspheming the name of God, w^ereas in his cottage there is bl^ssing. Now
consider for what it is thou look upon a man as the mos^ happy in the World.

. IX.
Ninthly, Consider the services thou performest to God, what they are. From the
nature of the services that a man offers up the nature of the Portion that will
fall to his share and lot may be guessed: his services point at his Portion.
Are your services slight, and perfunctory, done ^ith eye-service only as men
pleasers, Col. 3.22. Ephesians. 6.6. 1 These. 2.4. Isa. 28.13.
and not in singleness of Heart? Is ^ot the will of God done in your services
from the Heart? Do you ^raw near to God with your lips, ^ut your Hearts are
removed far from him? And think to put off God with the slight services? This
argues your Portion to be of God's slight mercies. If your services are from a
Spirit of Bondage, and not done with good will. Ephesians. 6. (...), (as the Apost.
has it) with a good and ready mind, so as the will be engaged in the work: but
your services are Ishmaell-like of the bondwoman Hagar, forced and strained as
it were from you, having no other rise nor principle but mere compulsion, and
the bond of natural conscience forcing thereunto: so as there is no
agreeableness, nor inward suitableness between the frame of your Heart, and
holy things; no workings of the Spirit of Adoption, no establishment wh^ God's
free Spirit, Psalm. 51.12.
but bondag^ all along. Then its more th^^ probable a servants Portion is (...)
you are like to have, and not ^ child's. It will fare with such ^ man and his
services as it di^ with Hagar and her Son; C^ out the bondwoman and her son,
Gal. 4.30.
for the son of the bondwoman shall (...) be Heir with the Son of the free^
woman. Genes. 21.14.
Hager has a loaf of brea^ given her, and a bottle of water these are put upon
her shoulder, (...) may take them for her share, and so she is sent away. Genesis
21.14* So if thy services be but as of Hagar, the work of a mere servant thou
shall not abide for ever. For the servant abides not in the house for ever:
Joh. 8.35.
but the son abides ev^^ Joh. 8.35. Thou may go an^ wander in the
Wilderness li^ Hagar, and take thy Portion (...) thy shoulder; all thou art
like t^ have is but what suits back an^ belly, some clothes for thy bac^, and
bread and a bottel of water for thy belly, Hos. 10.2. Hos. 7.16.
and there is thine all. Or if thou art Hypocritical in thy services: or come
before God with a divided heart, an heart, and an heart: an heart that seems to
be intended and bent toward God, but aims another way, like a deceitful Bow
that shoots the Arrow aside from ^he mark, it seems to aim at: Hos. 7.16. And
so seek the ^raise of men more then the praise ^f God; the honor from men,
Joh. 12.43 1 These. 2.6. Joh. 5.44.
more ^hen the honor that comes from God only: If this be thy case in ^hy
services, that the great Prin^iple in them is Hypocrisy; it (...) a sign, thou
art the man, that ^ere shall have all thy reward. We know what our Savior
says ^oncerning the Hypocrites, who ^d all their works to be seen of men, ^ey
gave Alms, but it was be^e men, to be seen of them. Mat. 23.5. Mat. 6.1. Mat.
6.5.
They ^ayed but it was standing in the ^nagogues, and in the corners of ^e
Streets: Note by the way, ^at their posture as standing in prayer (either as
arguing the stoutness and unbrokenness of their hearts, or else their desire of
vain glory, and so the more to be taken notice of) is expressly by our Savior
pointed at, and in them taxed, because the frame of their hearts was not right;
for the praised standing, and it was to be seen of men. So they fasted, but
then they disfigured their faces, Mat. 6.16.
that they might appear unto men to fast. No^ what follows hereupon, Vti volunt
Deo, ut fruantur mundo. Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. 15. c. 7.
what'^ their Portion? what is it tha^ falls to their share? why, Ou^ Savior
tells us plainly, Verily ^ say unto you (says he) they have their reward. They
have it, the^ have it in this World, they have it now. What they look for, an^
what falls to their share, the have it in hand, present pa^ down right, and
without dela^ They look for reverence, respe^ and applause amongst men, a^ they
have it: They would b^ called of men Rabbi, Rabbi, (...) men call them so: They
would be fat and shine, according to that of the Prophet Jer. 5.28. and have
their cup with the good things of this life to overflow; and they have their
desire. This is the reward they look for, and they have it. Verily I say unto
you, they have their reward: And here is all that ever they are like to have.
Thus Hypocritical services sometimes meet with Temporal good things here; but
they never reach Eternal.

. X.
Tenthly, Let me ask the question, have thou been heretofore forward in the
profession of Religion, having had some works of Conviction and Illumination
passed over thy conscience, and so have tasted the good word of God, and the
powers of the World to come? have thou formerly heard the word preached, and
with joy received it? Heb. 6.5. Luke 8.13. Isa. 58.2. Si quis Christo
temporalia praeponat, non est in eo fundamentum Christus. Aug. de Civit. Dei.
lib. 21. cap. 26.
have thou taken delight in approaching unto God, and to know his ways? and
now art turned back to the old Vomit, and have forsaken the ways of God, so as
those Ordinances which sometimes were sweet to thee, are (as unsavory) laid
aside, and have lost their wonted relish in thy account? oh, this is a fearful
sign, that the World and Lusts thereof have gotten a strong hold in thy heart,
and sway the Scepter there; and that thou art one of those, who shall have all
their good things here. There is ^ dreadful Scripture for this, i^ Jerem.
17.13. O Lord, the ho^^ of Israel, all that forsake thee sha^ be ashamed: and
they that depar^ from me shall be written in the Earth, because they have
forsaken the Lord, the fountain of livi^^ waters. All that depart from God
shall be written in the Earth; An heavy Doom is this for all those that have
profe^^^^ the knowledge of God and his ways, and yet turn from the Holy
Commandment delivered unto them. Oh, 2 Pet. 2.21.
it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, then
after they have known it to turn aside. To depart from God after there has been
a turning to him is so evil in it is nature, Multi amissa charitate propterea
non exeunt for as, quia secularibus emolumentis tenentur, and sua quaerentes,
non quae Jesu Christi, non a Christi unitate, sed a suis commodis nolunt
recedere. Aug. de Bapt. Contr. Donat. lib. 4. cap. 10.
that it is a grievous provocation: As in all sin there is a departing from
God, so this is attended with an extraordinary aggravation. Hence the Lord
expostulates the case with Israel about this sin in an upbraiding manner, Jer.
2.5. Thus says the Lord, what iniquity have your fathers found in me, that
they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
And threatens them ver. 9. Wherefore I will yet plead with you, says the Lord,
and with your Childrens Children will I plead. I will not only plead with you,
but with your Childrens Children: I will remember this your sin to suceeding
generations. And here, they that depart from God, and forsake his ways, shall
be written in the Earth. The names of true believers are written in Heaven.
Luke 10.20. they are enrolled there in those everlasting records never to be
razed nor blotted out: They have an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
Isa. 56.5. But those that depart from the Lord have their names written in the
Earth: they may take their Portion, there, their name and substance is lodged
in the Earth, and after a while shall rot and perish. Sad is the sentence of
having the name written in the Earth which, when it is sought for, is blotted
out, and cannot b^ found: yet thus it will be with all those that depart from
God, they shall have their names written in the Earth. Psalm. 109.13.
He loved the Earth (says God of the worldling) and let him take it; he had
rather have had a great name in the Earth, ( to call his Lands after his own
name, Psalm. 49.11.) than to have his name written in the Book of Life, and so
he forsook my ways: therefore his name shall be written in the Earth; and let
him take his good things there. But when my People come up in remembrance
before me, and the Book of remembrance shall be opened, Mal. 3.16. to give them
Eternal Mercies; the memory of this man, whose name is written in the Earth,
shall perish. Therefore if thou have been forward heretofore, and now when thou
come to be more ancient, thou art remiss, and dull, and careless in the way
and work of the Lord, here is a text for thee; go home, and tremble, least thou
be the man or woman whose name is written in the Earth, and so art never to
enjoy the good things of Heaven.

. XI.
In the Eleventh place, consider whether God at present do not curse thy
blessings: so as thou find that the more thou have, the worse thou growest.
Thou art not bettter, but worse from time to time, by the good things of the
WorId that are heaped upon thee. The outward Portion thou enjoyest it works
not for the better, but for the worse unto thee. True it is, thou art better as
to thy body, thine eyes may stand out with fatness: Psalm. 73.7, 8. Job. 20.6.
Job. 21.7.12, 13.
and collops of fat are upon thy flanks, as Job has it, chap. 15.27. thy head
it reaches unto the Clouds: and thy tongue it walks through the Earth, Psalm.
73.9. thou art mighty in power; and thy House is safe from fear: thou spendest
thy days in wealth, rejoicing at the sound of the Organ. Thus thou have got a
belly-full of the good things of this World: but how fares it with thy soul all
the while? Alas, it is poor, and lean, and thin, and bare: thy body's in good
likeing, but there is leaness sent into thy soul, Psalm. 106.15. It Is worse with
thee now than it was formerly. Since thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair
is grown (Ezekiel. 16.7.) it is worse with the, than when thou wast naked and bare.
In former days thou wast more humble, and holy, and self-denying: more
pitiful and compassionate to the needy: more upright and conscientious in thy
dealings. Job. 20.23
But now in the fullness of thy sufficiency, pride compasses thee about as a
chain: and violence covers thee as a garment. Psalm. 73.7. The more thou have
the worse thou art grown. This is a sign, that together with thy Portion, thou
have the curse of God along upon thee. And if so, thou art the man, that is
likely to have all thy good things here. He for whom there is a reservation of
eternal mercies in the life to come, has the blessing of God going along with
his enjoyments here, sanctifying them unto him, and enabling him through grace
to a right improvement of them: so as his soul is bettered by them, growing
more thankful, more holy, more heavenly, this is the fruit of Gods grace and
blessing, as well upon a prosperous, as adverse condition. For all conditions
of themselves are equally insufficient for the production of any spiritual
good, without the concurrence of Gods grace and blessing with them. Now this
argues something of good reserved in store for us for the time to come, where
the blessing of God is upon us in our enjoyments here, keeping us low, humble,
holy, and self denying. But where the mercies of God abound, and the heart
grows worse, and worse; so as the more that Worldly Good comes in, the less of
Spiritual Good there is to be found, this aboads the condition evil, as having
the curse of God upon it. As if a man should eat meat at ones table, and as
soon as he has eaten it, begin to swell, he will conclude certainly the meat
was poisoned: So when thy estate rises, and thy heart rises in pride together
with it, surely thy corruption poysoneth thy estate unto thee; and instead of a
blessing, thou have the curse of God upon it. And if so, thou may take the
World here for thy portion, for thou art the man who art likely to have no good
thing hereafter.

. XII.
Twelfthly, Whether has God convinced thee of that which stops the great
current of his mercy, and of the right way to have it opened? What it is that
lays (as it were) a restraint, and why, upon the current of his choice
mercies; and how that restraint is to be removed? If the choice mercies in
Christ be designed for thy portion; this he has, or will certainly convince
thee of. Now that which stops the great current of Gods choice mercies is,
Divine Justice: and this by reason of our sin. So that until Divine Justice be
satisfied, and sin removed, and taken away, the great current of Gods choice
mercies cannot be opened. But now the Lord Christ the Son of God, and Second
Person in the Blessed Trinity he is come into the World, and by his Blessed
Mediation for us, satisfies Divine Justice, and is that Lamb of God, Isa.
53.11. Joh. 1.29.
which takes away the sin of the World: and in and through him only the great
current of Gods Eternal Grace is opened, even the exceeding riches of his
grace, in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 2.7. Now has
the Lord convinced thee of this, (...), Matthew. 20.28. (...), 1 Timothy 2.5. (...)
Ephesians. 5.2. (...), Heb. 9.12. (...), Gal. 3.13. (...). 1 Cor. 1.30. (...), 1 John
2.2.
and let thee see thy great need of Christ, and that without him, thou art
undone for ever; so that thy heart breaths after him, as the great and alone
peacemaker between God and thy Soul? Do thou see that wide breach which thy
sins have made between God and thee, and which by no other means can be made
up, but only by the Mediation of the Son of God? And art thou convinced that
the current of Gods Eternal Mercies can flow out no other way toward thee, but
only through the Golden Pipe of the Lord Christ's Mediation? And therefore,
thou say, Lord it is not from any righteousness of mine, nor from any thing
that any Creature in Heaven or Earth can do, that I expect to have my Portion,
but through the Mediation of the Son of God. That Is the thing I look after, my
heart closes with that Mediation, I looked upon that as the mean of all my
worth, and of the conveyance of all my mercies. If it be thus with thee, then
here is the man indeed, that is not like to have his good things in this World.
He looks for other guess mercies from the Mediation of Christ, than any this
World can afford; and in due time shall have them. But now the man that has his
Portion in this World, looks no further but to Gods general bounty: never
considers what stops the great current of Gods Grace; is not convinced of the
indispensable perfection of Gods Justice, nor of that infinite breach which sin
as made betwixt God and Man; is not sensible of the absolute need there is of
Christ, and of his satisfaction unto Divine Justice: and so to pant after
Christ for relief and succor, through whom alone he may enjoy the pardon of
his sin, and have the Conduit of Gods choice mercies opened. No, these are all
as Ridles to him, he understands not what they mean; all he looks after, is
some overflowings of Gods General bounty here in this World toward him, in the
enjoyment whereof (had he 'em but) he could securely acquiesce, and sing a
requiem to his Soul, now Soul, take thine ease: as if his Soul were no other
than of a brute. This now is the man that is like to have all his good things
here. For those to whom God gives Eternal Mercies, he convinces them of the
evil of their sin, of that infinite breach that sin has made between God and
their Souls, and how that no Creature in Heaven or in Earth could satisfy
Divine Justice, and make up that breach, and open the current of Gods Eternal
Grace, but only the Lord Christ must come, through whom alone there is Peace
and Reconcilation to be enjoyed: and so lets them see their absolute need of
Christ for Salvation, and stirs up all the powers of their Souls to breath
after him, and Eternal mercies in him. Now if it be not thus with thee, that
God has not caused this Conviction-work to pass upon thy Soul, and enlarged thy
heart after these things, through which he carries on his People to a full
enjoyment of himself in Glory; but thou sit down under the shade of Gods
general bounty, and so make to thy self a figleaf covering and there take
up thy rest; know that the issues of Gods general bounty are like to be thy
Portion, and thou have all thy good things here.

. XIII.
Moreover, that man is like to have all his good things in this present life,
whose days are spent and past away, without some fear upon his heart, lest God
should put him off with the things of this present world. He that enjoys a
considerable Income of outward mercies, and has not his Spirit sometimes
touched with a fear and dread least God should put him off so: this is very
likely to be the man, all whose good things are here. There is some danger in
this respect; and it is to be fea^ed, that there are not a few, who fill their
Bellies with the good things of this l^fe, and never so much as call their
state in question within themselves, nor mind the answer of their hearts, how
it shall go with them to all Eternity: whether the things they now enjoy be not
the All, that ever they are like to have? Job hints such a Generation to us,
whose outward condition in this world was prosperously happy: Job 21.13.
they had what heart could wish: but perhaps this might not long continue with
them, they might perchance outlive their felicity. No, says he, They became
old, and were mighty in power still, Job 21.7. But surely then in their old age
they would begin to consider their latter end; Job 32.7.
Days would speak, and multitude of Years would teach wisdom: Hos. 7.9.
When gray hairs were here and there upon them; they would then surely bethink
themselves* and since their condition has been all along so good and happy,
they would fear lest here should be their Portion? No, they would not: Their
houses are safe [or peace] from fear, all is calm and quiet with them: Ay, but
before they come to die, they will surely put the Question to themselves about
their Eternal state; they will never go on so ^ottishly to their very latter end,
but they will examine and enquire before they drop into the Grave? No, they will
not; They spend their days in wealth [ (...)
mirth] and in a moment go down to the grave: Job 21.13. A sad going down,
eternal de^truction entered upon in a moment. Consument in bono dies suos. Job
21.13.
How miserably are these men deceived, they thought their condition happy, and
blessed themselves in their Enjoyments, they never feared nor questioned lest
their portion should be in this World: This never came ^p upon their thoughts,
and so, they spent their days in wealth, and in a moment went down to the
grave. The like senseless frame of heart we find set forth by David in the 49th
Psalm, Psalm. 49.6.
speaking there of such a Generation of men, who did trust in their wealth, and
boast themselves in ^e multitude of their riches: yea, (...) surely they would
not always trust, but sometimes fear lest their wealth and the multitude of
their riches should be all their Portion? No, their inward thought is, that
their Houses shall continue for ever; and their dwelling Places to all
Generations; they call their Lands after their own Names, verse 11. But surely
before they die they will bethink themselves? No, they go on still in a secure
condition, void of fear, and like Sheep they are laid in the Grave, Death shall
feed on them, and the Upright shall have dominion over them in the Morning;
verse 14. They lived like Brutes, seeking satisfaction to their sensual
appetites, and like Brutes they come to die* like Sheep they are laid in the
Grave, and Death feeds upon them. The Apostle tells us of some men, who feed
themselves without fear. Jude 12. These are spots when they feast with you,
feeding themselves without fear. They never question what their latter end
shall be, or whether here shall not be the All of good that ever they are like
to enjoy. You can go now to a Merry-meeting, and you can feast and feed upon
^he Cheer, and you eat without fear; you never have such a thought in your
heart; What ^f God should put me off with these things? I hear indeed there are
some men put off so, what if it should prove to be my Portion? Oh, what a
miserable Creature were I then! I fear there are some men never had such a
thought in all their lives. The wicked are described to be men that eat without
fear, never thinking of a change, nor having the least suspicion or jealousy
of their present states: And so as the Fishes that are taken in an evil Net,
and as the Birds that are in the Snares; so are they snared in an evil time,
when it falls suddenly upon them: Eccles. 9.12.

. XIV.
Furthermore, That man (...) like to have all his good things (...) this life,
whose thoughts are (...) relieve his Conscience, in (...) guilt of the least
sin, with the consideration of the outwar^ Comforts he does enjoy. The is the
temper of wicked worldly-minded men, who have the^^ Portion in this life; they
see^ to relieve their consciences, their guilty consciences, with the rejoicing
in their Riches, and i^ their Estates, and in what the have gotten. We have a
notable Scripture for this; Isa. 57.10. Thou have found the life ^ thine hand,
therefore thou wast n^ grieved. It may be if a man goe^ on in an evil way, and
does no^ prosper in it, if God crosses him in it, then he begins to bethink
himself; Is not this a sinful way? Does not God oppose me in it? And then, not
finding the life of his hand, -- populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo ipse domi
simulac nummos contemplor in arca.
he be^ins to be grieved: But if he ^an find the life of his hand go on, and
prosper, and have what he ^esires, than he will not be grie^ed, but his heart
grows hard^ed. Thus wicked men set their Riches and Estates against all their
sin and guiltiness, and think ^hey will countervail it. Oh, this ^s a sure sign
of a worldly heart; none more sure, than when a man can set the good things of
this world against the guilt of sin; can put any worldly thing into the Balance
to weigh down the guilt of sin; here is a worldly heart indeed, a wretched
heart, one like to have his Portion here. This was the wicked frame of Ephraim,
in charge against him by the Prophet Hosea, Chap. 12.7, 8. There he reproves
their fraud and oppression in matters of Trade and dealing, and tells Ephraim,
that he is a Merchant, the Balances of Deceit are in his hand, he loves to
oppress: Here Ephraim's sin is plainly detected, and charged home upon him But
how does this Reproof tak^ with Ephraim? Why, see, how he awards the blow: he
ha^ found the l^fe of his hand, he grown rich, and fat, and full and his
corrupt heart is taugh^ this Devilish guile, to set hi^ Gain against his
Guilt, and to countervail his Sin by his Substance: For thus he pleads, i^ not
openly, yet in the reserve of his own heart, and it serve his turn for the
present; Well (as if he he should say) Choose it, here is a Charge brought
against me, and laid upon my Conscience, but I matter it not; though there be
some guilt in it, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out Substance.. You tax
me with fraud and oppression in my dealing, I know more of the mystery of Trade
than you can tell me: But however (say what you will) I prosper and thrive by
the bargain; I am become rich, I have found me out substance; I have this to
set against the guilt of any sin you can charge upon me. Oh, here is a man of
the World indeed, that can thus trust in uncertain riches: 1 Timothy 6.17. And
bless himself in his Estate; and endeavors to daub up the Wall of his guilty
Conscience with the untempered Mortar of his ill-gotten Substance: and though he
has contracted much guilt in an evil way, yet he can set the gain of sin
against its evil, and countervail sin's guilt, by its advantage. Now if this
man have not his Portion in this World, what man shall?

. XV.
Moreover, That man also is very likely to have all his good things here, whom
God suffers to go on and prosper in a wicked way; and lets him take his fill of
the vanities of this world without control. The Psalmist speaks of such as
have [no bands in their death] Implying that they have no bands in their life
neither. Job 21.9.
For the Rod of God is not upon them: They are not in trouble as other men,
neither are they plagued like other men: Psalm. 73.4, 5. Therefore pride
compasses them about as a Chain; violence covers them as with a garment.
These are the ungodly, who prosper in the world, they increase in riches, verse
12. Now thus to go on and prosper in a way of wickedness, is a pregnant
Evidence that such men have all their good in this present World. For see the
end of these men, as in the same Psalm described: Thou did set them (says he)
in slippery places: thou castest them down into destruction. How are they
brought into desolation as in a moment? they are utterly consumed with terrors:
Psalm. 73.18, 19. Surely all the good, and good days of these men must needs be
past before, when as now they are cast down into destruction, and there not
only consumed, but [utterly consumed] with terrors: which argues the final and
full reward and wages of sin to be issued out upon them. Thus, the Lord, having
no further nor other good in store for a People, than what here they do enjoy,
finding them incorrigible in their way of wickedness, has sometimes left them
to themselves to go on in sin, and prosper; resolving not to cross them in
their evil course, till he caused final destruction to seize upon them. A
notable Scripture we have for this in Hosea 4.14. Hos. 4.8.
Israel had given themselves to spiritual whoredom, and they set their heart on
their iniquity; Percussi sunt animi caecitate, ut nec intelligant delicta nec
plangant. In ignantis Dei major est haec ira. Cypria. de laps.
they were incorrigibly bent upon their evil way. Therefore (says God) I will
not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they
commit adultery. He positively resolves to leave them to themselves, and to
have no more to do with them in any way or means that may either destroy their
Sin, or save their Souls; and therefore (says he) Your daughters shall commit
wheredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. Oh, it is a sad doom, to have
Sin for a man's Portion here, and not Suffering to take it off: to prosper in a
way of wickedness, and no punishment to restrain its course. I will not punish
your daughters when they commit whoredom (says God) nor your spouses when they
commit adultery. As if he should say, What more could have been done to reclaim
them, than I have done? How have I endeavored to convince them of their sin,
to turn them from it, and bring them home unto me? But all in vain, and to no
purpose: I have stricken them, Jer. 5.3.
but they have not grieved; I have consumed them, but they have refused to
receive correction. Jer. 7.26.
I have sent unto them my Prophets, daily rising up early, and sending them;
yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear. They are wicked,
perverse, incorigible: And therefore because I would have purged you, and you
were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more: Ezekiel.
24.13. But go on, add sin to sin: I will not punish your daughters, when they
commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery. Let them take
their fill, and wallow in the mire of their Lusts. Let them walk in the ways of
their heart, Eccl. 11.9.
and in the sight of their eyes: but yet the people that does not understand,
Hos. 4.14.
shall fall: And so fall at length, that all their sensual good shall leave
them, and they shall never enjoy good any more. And thus that man whom God lets
prosper in a wicked way, is like to be the person, who shall have all his
Portion of good things in this present World.

. XVI.
Lastly, That man's Portion is likely to center in the bare good things of this
present life, to whom God has not given an heart to do good with his Substance
to Gods Church and People. This is an Argument of a man, of the World, who would
rather pull down, than lend the help of a stone for Bethel. Who thinks the
least of charge put upon him about the Repairs or Necessaries of God's House or
Worship, to be too much. To lend his help upon any such account, is a burden to
him; and did not the Law of the Nation bind, he has no mind at all unto it:
though such places separated for Religious Meetings, be God's Houses, Sacred to
him, dedicated, assigned, and given to him, and he has an Interest in them. If
an Idol's Temple be an Idol's Temple; that is, such an house as an Idol has
interest in, and is sacred with a false and unholy kind of sacredness: Sure
then a Church to God, is God's Church, and such a Church as he is interessed
into, and is Sacred with a true and real Sacredness. Matthew. 21.13. Matthew. 11.17.
Mine house shall be called an house of prayer of all Nations. Lo, an house of
prayer; that is, of Public Worship, (a part for the whole) and this House,
God's House, and that, among all Nations. Would you wish a clearer Proof for
the Warrant of Churches, and their Sacredness? Multi non a Christi unitate, sed
a suis commodis nolunt recedere. Aug. de Bapti. 1.4. cap. 10.
And yet the men of the World care not if one stone were not left upon another,
but that all were thrown down: And so closely are their hearts glewed to the
things o^ this present life, that what comes from them toward the maintenance
of God's House and Worship, is rather extorted from, than given by them* is a
matter of Covetousness, an^ not of Bounty; from a grudging Necessity, and not a
cheerful Freedom: 2 Corin. 9.5, 7. Oh, this disposition and frame of heart, is
a sure Argument of a man that has all his Good in this present World. Such a
wordly frame of heart as this would part with nothing toward the maintenance
of God's Worship, his Gold is his God, and Silver [ his pleasant Pictures. Isa.
2.16.
] He would lay out nothing for God* though true it is, God himself personally
can receive nothing* but by giving it to his Worship and the Places, and
Things, and Persons that belong to his Worship, it is accounted given to him.
Now such an heart will twist, and writhe, and argue any way, so as it may hold
what it has, Mal. 3.8.
and will rob God in Tithes and Offerings. And though such men may press
Examples of Scripture upon other accounts, yet they forget old Jacobs Pattern,
of whom we read, that he vows, that of all that God should give him, he would
surely give the Tenth unto him. Genesis 28.22.


If there be any amongst you, that think Examples of Holy Writ to bind him; as
it seems ^ome do in other things (where ^he matter is such as will put them to
no great cost:) Let them ask their Consciences, why should not this Example of
^ld Jacob bind them, as well as any other Example? That it should be a typical,
ceremonial, and temporal Ordinance, to ^ive God Tithe of all we have. I could
never yet hear any Reason of any great force Some do strain their Wits to find
out a kind of Shadow in it, and tell what it may signify: but the Scripture,
for ought I know, does not give any notice of any such thing. It was the use
before the Levitical Priesthood (as in Abraham, Genesis 14.20. So in Jacob's Vow,
Genesis 28.22.) And therefore is not a thing depending upon the Levitical
Priesthood. Nay, the Apostle rather, Heb. 7. makes mention of it, as a thing
due to the Eternal Priesthood of Melchisedec. It may seem plain, that Abraham
and Jacob would never have observed this Portion in measuring out these
Payments to God, if they had not conceived it a perpetual and a natural Duty.
It is undoubtedly a Moral Precept to Honor God with our Goods, and by bringing
Presents to him. Seeing these holy men thought it fit to grant God so liberal a
Portion, why should not we think him worthy as much, or that something must be
due to God, and that in a liberal quantity? Surely Gospel Privileges do not
destroy, but establish Moral Duties; and God is worthy to be honored with our
Substance as much now as ever. Do we Honor God if we bring him no Present? No
Gift? Will God account this a good Improvement of the Mammon of unrighteousness
committed to our trust? Are we faithful Stewards, when we are so far from
employing for, that we detain from the Masters use, what is his own, and which
only by a Commitment for a time is in our hands? Yet this is the frame of a
worldly heart, that all that it has, it enjoys for its self, and nothing would
it return unto God the Giver.

CHAP. IX. Containing some Corollaries by way of Inference from the Point
foregoing.
NOW we come to the last Particular promised in the entrance upon this
Discourse, and for the handling of the Doctrinal Proposition therein laid down;
viz. The closing up the Point in some Uses. We have seen, that there is a
Generation of men to whom God grants the enjoyment of some good things only in
this present life, which ended, after that they shall never have more. Here Is
their all of good that ever they are like to enjoy. This has been evidenced by
several Examples from Scripture Record: And further we have enquired into the
Reasons, why God will give such a large Dole of good things to the wicked in
this life. And moreover have seen, that all the good things they do enjoy, are
confined to this present life; so as when this life ends, all their good is at
an end. We have also looked into the miserable Condition of such men, who have
all their good things here; and have endeavored to mark out, so far, as we
may, who that Man or Woman is, that in such a condition is like to have all
their Good Things in this present World. And now we come to the promised Uses,
issuing from, and referring to the present Argument under the foregoing
considerations: And first some Inferences from the Point. As

. I.
First, If there be a Generation of men who have all their good in this present
World, then hence we may gather the reason why the men of the World are so
cunning in the things of this World. Why they can make so good shift for
themselves rather than other men can. They are subtle, and crafty in and about
their Worldly concerns; they seek deep to hide their Counsel, Isa. 29.15.
and their works are in the dark. Why, this is the reason; Here Is their
Portion: their very happiness, and all their good is here. No marvail then
though they make such shift in the World as they do. Will not all the powers
and faculties of the Soul be active, and diligent to get and preserve that
wherein happiness is presented as consisting, and which accordingly is
apprehended by them? This puts the men of the World upon their shifts, and
makes them so active and cunning about their Portion. The Children of this
World are wise in their Generation, Luke 16.8.
yea wiser (says our Savior) than the Children of Light. They have a notable
Serpentine Wisdom, they know how to gather and heap together, they are
instructed in the subtle mystery of overreaching and circumventing: Hab. 2.6.
they know how to increase that which is not their own, and with an
indiscernable cunning to carry it on; beguileing silly Souls sometimes by
serious Protestations, sometimes by earnest and seemingly real Promises;
vailing sometimes their unworthy actions under a Vizard and Color of Religion,
that they may with less remorse of Conscience, and more justifiably (if
possible) before the World, devour widows Houses. Mat. 23.14
Much of the Serpents wisdom may be seen put forth in the men of the World, and
notably they act it as his instruments. Now the Apostle says on the other
hand, 1 Cor. 2.12. We have not received the Spirit of the World. We cannot tell
how to shift in the World, as the men of the World do: we cannot cheat,
deceive, and cousen as they do. We look further then these Earthly things, and
so cannot shift as other men can. We have not the Spirit of the World, as they,
who have their Portion in this World, and so cannot use their cunning: we are
led by another Spirit, and guided up to another Portion, and have our senses
exercised about other Objccts, and therefore cannot act in their way. The men
of the World (you know) are compared to Swine in Scripture, Mat. 7.6. Luke 15.4.
and the children of God to sheep: Now a Swine though it goes abroad all day
long wandering up and down, it knows the way to the trough at night. But a sheep
if it go wandering a little out of its place, does not know how to come home
again, but goes astray and wanders up and down, till it be even lost; it knows
not its pasture to return unto it. But Swine are not so, they know their
trough, and their swill, and though they go abroad all day, yet at night they
will come home again. So ungodly men, though they go up and down wandering, they
know how to come to their ^rough at night, they have better skill in the World,
and are more artificial in the things of ^he World, they have in them better
understanding. The Children of this World are in their Generation wiser, than
the Children of Light. And why? For here is their Portion.

. II.
Secondly, If there be a Generation that have all their good things in this
present World, then hence we may see the reason, why, many that have so large a
Portion of the good things of this Life, regard so little the good things of
the Life to come. Why? It Is not their Portion: those things that concern
another Life are no part of their Portion. Religion* Piety, the ways of God,
and the Church of God are matters they look upon themselves altogether
unconcerned in, their interest lies not there, and therefore they care so
little for them* whether they sink or swim, rise or fall, it is no matter at all
to them. They only mind what concerns the present Life, because their Portion's
there. No wonder therefore if we see rich Worldly men so carelessly to overlook
the great concernment ^f their Souls; they live as if ^here were no other Life
hereaf^er; the proper language of ^^eir actions is: Isa. 22.13. Amos. 6.3.
Let us eat and ^^ink, for to morrow we shall die. ^hey put far away the Evil
Day: and the thoughts of Eternity ^ver come up upon their ^earts. How careless
and ne^^tive are they of the things ^^at concern their peace, and (...) it
fares with the Church of ^od, and things of God, how (...) ways of God do go
on and ^osper, or decline and fall in (...) World? They never trou^^e their
thoughts about these ^^^ngs. They matter not what comes of the Kingdom of
^^rist among men, whether ^^re be an Obedience yielded his Laws and Scepter; or
(...) rise up in Arms and open ^^stility and Rebellion against (...) Divine
Majesty; Gallio-like ^y care for none of these things. Act 18.17
(...) great Truths of God, and Fundamental Principles of Religion are to them
no otherwis^ but as Idle Tales; and the V^sions of the Prophets, as Drea^ and
Fancies; The Doctrine^ the Law of God it is to them, Questions of words and
names, A^^ 18.15. without savor or sign^fication. And it is no wonde^ if we
see it to be thus with the^ alas, their Portion lies (...) here, their
concernment is n^ imbarqued in matter of Relig^on: If it were, they would
e^ercise more care about it. Y^^ need not doubt, but ever to fi^ the Heart
working about i^ Treasure: But alas their Tre^sure is not in the Promises; the^
riches lie not in Religion, the^ hope is not laid up in Heaven and therefore
Heaven, Relig^on, and the Promises of t^^ Gospel are so utterly neglect^ by
them. Is it likely that ^ Carnal Heart should care f^^ Spiritual things? Or
that a m^ that has his Portion here, shou^^ have his Heart in Heaven? It Is
^mpossible to divide the Heart from the Portion, to take off the ^ind from the
Treasure. For ^here the Treasure is (says our ^aviour) there will the Heart be
al^, Luke 12.34. You may still and the Heart hanckring about that Object,
wherein it esteems ^s chiefest good to lie: the stay ^hereof is upon its
Portion. What the men of the World set their minds upon is sum'd up by ^he
Apostle under three heads, ^iz. The Lust of the flesh, the Lust of the eyes,
and the Pride of Life, 1 John 2.16. Here Is their Good, and their God, and their
All; about these things (accord^ngly as they are led) they are ^xceedingly
careful and solici^ous. But as for the matters of Religion, they are rather to
them as matter of burden and reproach; and as such are wholly laid aside. Oh
sad; they are not their Portion.

. III.
Thirdly, If there be some m^ that have all their good in the present World,
then this r^solves the question, why m^ are so sunk down and swallow^ up (as it
were) in the Gulf (...) grief and sorrow upon the (...) of some Worldly Good a^
Comforts. Their Hearts a^ not able to bear up against the stream of a cross
occurence, b^ fall down, despond, and dy^ What Is the reason? Their Go^ is gone,
and do you ask the^ why? Their language is that (...) Micah unto the Danites,
Judge. 4.18
the Gods are gone, and what have the^ more? We know how it wa^ with rich,
churlish Nabal, wh^ his Wife told him David's desig^ against him, and the danger
h^ had, by his churlishness, run him self, and his, and all that he ha^ into: 1 Samuel 25.37.
his Heart died within his* and he became as a stone. He could not stand up
under the thoughts (...) the loss that might be near at ^and: his rich
Possessions that ^ere in Carmel bore up his ^eart; and the bare thoughts (...)
a deprivall of them, set on, ^^d cast it down. If the bare ^pprehension of an
evil to come, and of a danger run upon be so ^^esented by Carnal Men, as to
^amp all their joys; How then ^ust the loss indeed of that, which they account
their Porti^n, affect them, when it falls? shall not their Hearts then sink,
and dye, and perish? Genesis 27.46
What good ^ill their lives then do them, when ^he comforts thereof are taken
from them? It Is a sad thing for ^ man to have his good in this ^resent World:
such a one is ^able to be more afflicted in af^^iction than other men, though
^is affliction be but a wound in ^he flesh. How does such a one grieve, and
fret, and cruciate ^is Soul, when he meets with ^ross disappointments? He
cannot bear nor undergo the loss what he does account his Port^ on. But now a
Gracious Hear^ which is endowed with an He^venly Principle, and whose goo^ is
not lodged in things belo^ though such a one may meet wi^ many crosses and
disappointments in the World, yet is (...) ready to despond, and dye, as all
were lost and gone, while his God is with him. While God remains a God in
Covenant with him, and so appear^ he is so far from resenting (...) condition
as desperate (thoug^ never so doleful) that he nakedly does rejoice in God
alone Habak. 3.17, 18. Although t^^ fig tree shall not blossom, neithe^ shall
fruit be in the Vines; the labor of the Olive shall fail, and the Fields shall
yield no meat, the Flo^ shall be cut off from the Fold, an^ there shall be no
Herd in the Stalls* Yet I will rejoice in the Lord: ^ will joy in the God of my
Salvation. Such a Soul knows that when Father and Mother do forsake, Psalm.
27.10 Psalm. 73.26 Psalm. 144.15.
then the Lord is at hand to take it up. And though Heart fail and Flesh fail,
yet God is the strength of the Heart and the Portion for ^ver. Happy is that
People that is in such a case, whose God is the Lord. They are not liable to
the same grievances, or so to be afflicted under their afflictions as others
are. They may be troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed, but not
in despair. The reason is they have not their Portion here below: 2 Cor. 4.8
but their good things are all above, laid ^p there, where none can take them
away from them. We see therefore that it is a thing not ^o be wondered at, why
so many ^re of Baruch's temper, sigh, and ^aint, and grieve, and sorrow, ^o is
me (say they) for there is ^rief added to my sorrow, Jer. 45.3, 4, 5.
I faint ^n my sighing, and I find no rest: And when is this? when they ^re
crossed and disappointed in their Worldly designs and hopes: When the Lord
breaks down that which they have built, and plucks up that which they have
planted. And why is all this? they seek great things for themselves, and their
Portion is lodged in this present World. Jer. 45.4, 5.

CHAP. X. Containing some instructions expressing the more particular duties of
those to whom God has given some Evidences of their Interest in a better
Portion, than in this present World is to be enjoyed.
THe foregoing discourse seems to hint some things more particularly to those
whom the Lord has been pleased to endow with a better goo^ than this World
affords, who^ the Lord has given to see the good of his chosen: and who have
made choice of that good part which shall not be taken away from them. Psalm.
106.5 Luke 10.42
God might have put you off with the swill and draff of this present World,
have given you a belly full, and so an end. He might have dealt with you, as it
was with Hagar; have given you a Loaf of Bread, and a Bottel of Water, and so
have sent you away; but he has not done so, he has dealt otherwise with you,
than as with Slaves, and Vassals; he has adopted you for Sons and Daughters,
and given you Childrens Portions, the lines are fallen to you in pleasant
places, you have a goodly Heritage: Psalm. 16.56
for the Lord is the Portion of your Inheritance, and of your Cup. Now seeing
you have some evidences that God has given you a better Portion, and not put
you off with the good things of ^his World: it concerns you to ^earn and
practice those instru^tions that your condition calls ^or. As

. I.
First, Oh, Bless the Lord for his goodness to you all your days. Say with the
Psalmist, Bless the Lord, Psalm. 103.1.
O my Soul, and all that is within me Bless his Holy Name. The Lord has showed
you better things than these are; he might have put you off with some outward
Worldly Good, and have made it to be your All: But your line is fallen in
pleasant places, and you have a goodly Heritage. Oh therefore let your Souls be
enlarged in blessing, and let the assured happiness of your State, and your
riches in reversion raise your Hearts. The least mercy is in a sort infinitely
beyond our deserts; if we consider either the infinite excellency of the
Author, or the Wretched Unworthyness of our own Hearts, and so justly engages
us unto Blessings praise. How much more when we are made the Subjects of
Eternal Mercies, and are to have the Treasures of Eternity opened unto us as
our own? Surely our Resolutions should be knit up into that of David: While I
live will I Praise the Lord, I will sing Praises unto my God, while I have any
Being. Psalm. 146.2.

. II.
Secondly, If the Lord has given you some Evidences of a better good stored up
for you in Heaven, the good of his chosen. Psalm. 106.5. then these Evidences
and hopes seem to impress upon you the Doctrine of contentment: be contented
then with your present state. Do not murmr and repine because your condition
as to the outward of this World is not so good as others; you perhaps want
many comforts, which you think others have: you are abridged and cut short of
many delights which you see others do enjoy; Oh, be not troubled at it, for
thou have that which will make the happy to all Eternity. Though thou have no
such a confluence of riches; neither art attended with such Worldly Pomp; Psalm.
73.7.
do not suck the blood of the Grape, neither art fed with the fat of the
Earth as others; though thou do not so swill in the Bowl of pleasures, as
those who have more than Heart could wish; yet thou have all this made up by
inward incomes, and thou have so much in Reversion sure, as ten thousand Worlds
cannot balance. Take a true believer at his lowest Ebb, and put it to him, and
he would not, he cannot, he dares not exchange conditions with the greatest
Monarch in the World, that is barely so, not having a work of Regeneration
passed upon him. At the very mentioning an exchange his thoughts startle, and
his Spirit recoils within him. For all Worldly Created Comfort cannot give him
satisfaction, and should he be reversed into the condition of an unbeliever,
how miserably wretched were he to all Eternity? Now should not such be
contented with their Lot, as it is cast for them in this present World? Why
should such repine and murmr, as dislikeing their (...) they will not change
conditions with t^o^e (were it put to them) from whose felicity their
corruption would take the occasion of coffeehouse? Has God given you Jesus
Christ, His beloved Son to redeem you? Has he given you the Holy Spirit to
Sanctify your Natures? Has he given you himself to be your Portion? And are
you troubled that you have no more of that sensual delight, which a reprobate,
yea a brute in some respects may have, as well as you? Oh, be ashamed of any
murmuring discontentments for want of the comforts of this World.

. III.
Thirdly, Do not you envy any wicked men for their ^^rtion; Psalm. 37.35
though their Leaf be green; and they spread like a Bay tree, yet envy them not
their good. Let not thy Heart envy Sinners: but be thou in (...) lon^* says
Soloman, Prove. 23.17. ^mplying that envy at the feli^^y of the wicked is a
great Enemy to the true fear of God, expelling and driving it out of the Heart,
or keeping it from entering in, (...) that as (...) comes in, the fear of God
go^ out. Envy puts out fear. Now this is a startling consideration, and strong
argument against that bitter root of envy. What shall such a worm be harbored
in the bosom as preys upon the Vitalls? Shall such a Thief be entertained into
our inmost lodgings, which will rob us of our choicest Treasure? The fear of
^he Lord is his Treasure, Isa. 33.6. Now you to whom God gives Eternal Mercies
have the ^east reason in the World to grudge the wicked their enjoyments. If
they have some little ^efreshing before they dye; some lightnings (as they say)
before they launch out into the vast Ocean of dark ^ternity; and so take an
Eternal ^arewell of all their joy and ^omfort, shall you be displeased at this?
When your mercies are crowned with further mercies, Pro. 20.20.
their Lamp it is pu^ out in obscure ^arkness: when your account ^oncludes with
joy, theirs is ^umm'd up with a dismal total: when your grace shall end in
Heavenly Glory, their World^y Glory shall shut up in Eternal woe and misery. Oh
then, why should you envy them their lucida intervalla a little before they
dye? I have read a story of a poor Soldier that was condemned to dye, merely
for taking a bunch of Grapes; for there was a strict law, that whosoever should
take any thing from that place they went through, should die for it: Now this
Soldier had taken a bunch of Grapes, and was for that condemned to die; and as
he went to execution, he went eating the bunch of Grapes; and some came to him,
and said, thou should think of somewhat else: he answered, I beseech you,
Sirs, do not envy me my Grapes, they will cost me dear. So may I say of all the
men of the World, we have no cause to envy them for any thing they have, it
will cost them dear.

. IIII.
Fourthly, Has God given you some Evidence of a better good reserved for you,
than in this world is to be enjoyed? oh then, study to know this good more, and
interest your selves therein more. (...). Ephesians. 3.19. (...). Ephesians. 3.8.
This good is incomprehensible; the love of Christ passes knowledge. Ephesians.
3.19. And the riches of Christ they are unsearchable, Ephesians. 3.8. Never think
with your selves that you are sufficiently acquainted with your chief good. The
excellency thereof is such that it will yet be the Object of more study, and
yet of a further search into it; and when you have done all, and come to the
furthest of your seize, your term will determine in the admiration of
it. For any to sit down satisfied with a set measure of Grace, argues they know
not the Nature of Grace, neither have a true work thereof upon their Hearts. So
to sit down with a knowledge of your Eternal Good, and not press forward to
know it more, more fully, more clearly, more certainly, argues you know it not
at all. Oh, labor to know your Heavenly good things more, use all good means
for the advance of knowledge in this respect: Pray that you may know: and not
barely to know, but to know it as your own, and your interest therein more and
more; to know it practically, so as the knowledge thereof may have a full and
thorough Influence upon your Hearts, and Lives: This will sweeten your
knowledge to you, when you know the thing as good, and as your own. Knowledge
of a good without an interest therein is but of small Influence, unless to vex,
and torment the mind. The Devils they know, but wanting interest, it does but
increase their torment. The damned Spirits at the last day they shall see and
know; The rich man ('it is said) sees Lazarus in Abraham 's bosom, Luke 16.23.
Mat. 25.41
And they shall see the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with power
and great Glory: all the Holy Angels with him. They shall see the Sheep on his
right hand; They shall hear that a Kingdom is prepared for his sheep, whilst
they (miserable wretches) must depart from him Cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Mat. 25 41.
This knowledge of theirs without interest shall gnaw their Souls in Hell, Jam.
5.3.
and shall eat their flesh as fire. But now to know good things, and to know
them as our own: oh, this is an healing knowledge, this sweetens knowledge to
us. Now your interest in the good things of Heaven is not so clearly
apprehended by you, but it may be more clear; they are not so sure to you, but
you may come up to a further assurance of them; though they be most sure in
regard of promise, yet Faith that lays hold upon the promise is capable of
some gradual additions, for the filling you with All joy, and peace in
believing, Romans 15.13. Therefore has God given some Evidence of Eternal
Mercies, labor to clear this Evidence both more fully in respect of its
Object; and more particularly in regard of your personal interest and claim
unto it.

. V.
Fifthly, If you have some Evidences of an Eternal Good as your own; oh, then
prize your Portion; set a Value on that, the worth whereof is beyond all value.
Heb. 12.16, 17.
Esau is branded as a profane Person, because for One morsel of meat he sold
his Birthright. The Birthright, Genesis 25.34.
which was attended with the Blessing, he set a low price upon: It was of more
worth and value, than so to have been despised by him. But you will say, it was
for his life, he was at the point to die: Genesis 25.32. What then? The Blessing
was more worth than his Life should have been unto him: he should rather have
parted with his life, than the Blessing of the firstborn,, which was a
Privilege that led to Christ. Afterward when he would have inherited the
blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he
sought it carefully with tears. Oh, let this sad Example of Esau be before your
eyes, and learn to prize your Blessing; prize it above your lives. And well you
may, for this Blessing will be Life in Death; it will be unto you eternal life.
If Esau be called a profane person, and said to despise the blessing, for
parting with it, when sore straited, and his life in danger: How much more are
those justly to be accounted profane, and Despisers of their choicest good,
who turn their backs upon it (as too many do) without any necessity or force
upon them? Never did any Soul lose by sticking to its Portion: Though a man lay
down his life for his eternal good, he loses nothing thereby, for he only
changes a temporal life, for an eternal; a momentany and an uncertain good, for
a good that is sure, and abides for ever. Things that are precious we do set a
value on, and rate them according to their worth. Now what can be of more worth
with us, than that good which is of everlasting concernment for our Souls? It
is a sad thing to see how slightly the world looks upon eternal mercies; what
low thoughts men have of true Peace, and of the things that belong unto it. How
are the great things of the Gospel slighted and contemned by them? They deal no
otherwise with them, than as Swine would do with the choicest Pearls; whilst in
the mean time they hugg their God Mammon. Oh, let this their vain and wretched
carelessness, stir you up more seriously to consider the Price that is put into
your hand; and the less they value, so much the more do you prize your eternal
mercies. Let it appear to all the World, that your Treasure is in Heaven, by
directing your hearts thither: And that you have something better than your
lives, in that you value it above your lives. We cannot prize that too much,
which we can never prize enough. Now if carnal men do so highly estimate their
worldly good, which will not long continue: much more should gracious hearts
prize their heavenly mercies, which will endure for ever.

. VI.
Sixthly, You that have some Evidences that God has not put you off with the
good things of this World, but reserved in store a further and better good for
you in the life to come; let this teach you to trust God for the Provisions of
this present life: wait upon God in the use of lawful means for a supply of
those things, the Lord sees to be needful for you. He that has promised Never
to leave you, Heb. 13.5.
nor forsake you, will not fail to supply you. You give check to those
Evidences you have of eternal mercies, should your ^houghts be suspended about
outward Necessaries. Has God made an Eternal Provision for ^ou through his
Son, cleared the way, and opened the Gate un^o Eternal Life? Has he showed you
those blessed Mansions that are in Heaven prepared for ^ou, and given you an
heart to lose with and embrace them ^s your own? Do you pro^ess to live in
expectancy of those Riches that are in rever^^on? And yet do you fear the ^ant
of outward? This surely cannot be. The Lord that feeds ^he Ravens will take
care that ^is Sons and Daughters have their Daily Bread. And he those Bounty
over-flows to the ^icked, will certainly supply ^he Necessities of his Saints.
^erhaps you may want some of those Superfluities which the men of the World
enjoy: bu^ did the Lord see them good for you, you should not want them* he
sees they would turn to sin^ and therefore you shall no^ have them. He that
gives Grace and Glory, will withhold no goo^ thing from them that walk
uprightly. Psalm. 84.11.
If the Lord have give^ you the upper Springs, he will no^ deny the nether.
Make use o^ this as the great Argument t^ strengthen your Faith in Go^ for the
Provisions of this present lif^. Say, has the Lord brought me thus far, and no^
will he cast me off? Has he given me his Son,, Himself, hi^ Grace, his
Kingdom, and shall I perish with hunger? Has he opened to me the Treasures of
the Everlasting Gospel, Ephesians. 3.8.
(the unsearchable riches of Christ) and shall I be forgotten in this world, as
a dead man out of mind? Psalm. 31.12.
This cannot be. Argue as Manoah's Wife did, If the Lord were pleased to kill
us, he would not have showed us all these things, neither ^ould he have told us
such things ^s these: Judges 13.23.

. VII.
Seventhly, You that have some Evidences of the good things of ^he life to
come, as yours, do ^ou live like such as God has ^ot put off with the Portion
of ^his World. Manifest in your Conversations, that you look for higher and
better things, ^han this present World affords. How excellent is it when
Christians declare their Country by their carriage: as did the Fathers of old:
Hebr. 11.14. when by their heavenly-mindedness, their holy. Converse, their
Self-denial, and resignation, they manifest themselves to be Citizens of the
New Jerusalem: and show themselves to be such as believe the Immortality of the
Soul, by an holy neglect of the body; and who have hope of Eternal Life by the
contempt of a temporary. Many who profess these things, surely they do not
really believe them; for did they believe that their Souls were immortal, and
that there were a life to come, could they steer such a course as they do, so
unsuitable to an eternal life, and the happiness of an immortal Soul, as if
they were born merely to live, and lust, and die, and so an end? But now you
that not only profess to believe a life to come, but have some Evidences of an
Interest in that life, and that you have a Portion there laid up for you to all
eternity: Oh, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation
and godliness. 2 Pet. 3.11
How suitably to that Interest you profess your selves to have, should you
endeavor to lead your lives? Phil. 3.20.
The Apostle's Conversation was in Heavem; and that which did influence upon
his Converse, to render it so divine and heavenly, was, that he had a Depositum
in Heaven; his treasure was there: There was his Lord and Savior; from thence
he looked for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. His Portion was laid up
there, the Lord had it in keeping for him. So he tells us, 2 Timothy 2.12. I know
(says he) whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that
which I have committed unto him against that day. You that have such a blessed
Portion, it becomes you to live up to your Portion. Beware of exposing the
Portion you profess an expectancy of, to scandal, by the unsuitableness of your
lives: neither do you prostitute your hopes to reproach by a disagreeing
converse. Undoubtedly the glorious Name, and Hopes you make a profession of,
will suffer amongst the men of the World, if you live not suitably, and up unto
them: if the frame of your lives be not agreeable to thi^ nature of your
hopes.. Your Portion it is holy, heavenly, no^ of this World: Oh, let you^
Conversations be holy, heavenly, and not according to the Course of this World:
Ephesians. 2.2 Do not the Sons of Princes, an^ Monarchs, and of the great men of
the Earth live suitabl^ to their Enjoyments and Possessions? Does not their
Por^ and Granduer make it appear that they are the Great One of the World?
Shall they live up to their earthly Portion, and shall not the Sons of Sion
live up to their heavenly? Shall earthly Enjoyments raise the heart of man to
an higher pitch than the common rate; and shall not an Interest in Heaven* and
a Portion there do it much more? Oh, shame not your Portion by the baseness of
your ways; neither reproach your Redeemer by the vassalry o^ your lives in any
evil way: As if you were born to sin; or redeemed, not from, but to serve the
motions of your flesh or mind: Ephesians. 2.3. Let your Souls enjoy their purchased
freedom, and your affections work gloriously according to the nature of your
Portion. You that have the Sun for your clothing, and a Crown of twelve Stars
upon your beads, let the Moon be under your feet. How should the holiness and
self-denial of your lives evidence to all the World, that you are of the number
of those, whose good things are not of this World, but have their Treasure laid
up in Heaven? You read how it was with Abraham (whose Children according to the
Spirit you profess your selves to be) though he was in the land of promise, yet
he sojourned therein, as in ^ strange Country: Hebr. 11.9. It Is strange he
should thus overlook the Land of promise; and when as it was given to him, and
to his Seed, that yet he should no more stay upon it, and take up with it: but
be as a Sojourner where he should have been as a man at home: The reason's
given, he did not look upon it as his Portion; for he looked for a City which
has foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God; verse 10. And he, and the
Fathers of old, both by their words and actions, did declare plainly, that they
sough^ a Country; verse 14. Yea, perhaps some better Soil, more fruitful, and
so more advantageous for their Cattle, and their own benefit? No, it was not
such a Country which the^ sought, but a better Country, th^^ is an heavenly;
ver. 16. They declared plainly by their course and converse, that they were
Denizens of the heavenly Jerus^lem; and that they were but Pilgrims and
Sojourners, till the^ came there at home. Oh, the Lord likes well this frame
(...) heart and life; and therefore is not ashamed to be called their God;
neither will he let the hopes of such be frustrate: For he has prepared for
them a City: Heb. 11.16. Blessed therefore are they who have such a Portion,
and who are influenced upon thereby to live up unto it.

CHAP. XI. Containing an Exhortation to endeavor after an Eternal Good, with
some Arguments and motives to enforce it.
THE foregoing Doctrinal Observation seems to speak ^o you all, that every one
^ould put on to make more ^^re of another Good, besides ^he Good in this
present world. There Is no need to put men on ^o make sure an Interest in this
^orld, all are forward enough that way: But alas, how backward and remiss are
we to ^^sue an Interest in Matters of Eternal Moment. The spirit of deep sleep
is poured out upon this Generation: Isa. 29.10. We are apt to put all to the
venture, let it fall as it will; and mind not the things of Everlastin^
Concernment for our Souls. Y^^ see that there are a generation of men, whose
All of Good they ever shall enjoy, is laid up in some trash of this present
World; and you see furthe^ that there is a choice Good t^ be enjoyed, the Good
of God'^ Chosen: Psalm. 106.5. Were i^ not now a very sad thing t^ think it,
that there should (...) such a Good and blessed Portion offered, Heb. 4.1.
and you to come sle^^ of it, and only to take up ^ll the Trash and Lumber of
the World? That you should (...) so spiritually mad and in a ^^ted, as to
choose Chips inste^^ of Pearls, Lust before Life, (...) Grass in rome of Glory?
The you should put on so eagerly after shadows, and in the mean while let go
the substance? Oh, be wise before it be too late, and take the opportunity now
offered; put on to make sure your Eternal Portion. There Is the greatest reason
for it, if you do but consider.

. I.
First, You are made capable of higher and better things, than the things of
this World are: God has endowed your Nature with such Principles, as do adapt
you to converse with Matters of Eternal Moment. You are informed with rational
and immortal Souls, which are capacitated for Communion with the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, and fitted for Divine Converse with the blessed Deity: and
that is another manner of business, Exodus 32.6.
than to Eat and drink, and rise up to play; and enjoy a little sensual
pleasure here awhile. The very Heathens could discern in the Fabric of Humane
Nature, another-guess Design couched, than only to indulge and please the
sensual and carnal Appetite. They looked upon his erected Countenance as
pointing him Heaven-wards.

Os homini sublime dedit, coelumque tueri
Jussit, and erectos ad sydera tollere vultus.
Do but consider how fearfully and wonderfully you are made according to that
of the Psalmist: Psalm. 139.14. I am fearfully and wonderfully made: fearfully
when you look Godwards, wonderfully when you reflect upon your selves:
fearfully, in that the great God should be employed about such a Protoplasm;
and wonderfully, in regard of the Curiousness of the Work. When I was curiously
wrought; verse. 15. like a Piece of [ (...) * (...) Vary compactus sum in imis
terrae. Psalm. 139.15.
Embroydery.] Your Souls are precious Jewels, and your Bodies are Cabinets in
frame and composure excellently fitted for so rich a Treasure. Now are you made
capable of the Good Things of Eternity, and will you take up with the Dross of
this World? Shall the Glorious End of your High Creation, and Wonderful
Constitution be thus unworthily disappointed? Has God made your Natures
capable of Eternal Glory, and will you bury them in the Slime and Mud of this
evil World? Moses's Complaint is against you, Deuteronomy. 32.6. Do you thus requite
the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy Father that has bought
thee? Has he not made thee? Oh, do not debase you selves, and prostitute the
Excellency of Humane Nature to Brutish Vanity: feed not upon Husks, where is
Meat enough in your Father's House Remember this, Luke 15.2.
and show your selves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors: Isa.
46.8.

. II.
Secondly, Put on to make sure this Eternal Portion, for you have trifled long
enough in the way: You have spent too much of the precious time of life
(allotted as a space and time for repentance) in the pursuit of Vanity: Does it
not therefore concern you to bestir your selves now? Look back upon your
by-past-time, and consider your former ways: weigh the Fruit they have brought
forth unto you; Romans 6.21.
see whether it be such, as in which upon second thoughts you can rejoice: or
such, which you cannot without shame reflect upon. Now if you have the
misgivings of Conscience in you, as upon an impartial search and judgment it
cannot otherwise be (unless sin have seared your hearts) then think with your
selves, and say, surely it is now hightime to put on for Eternity, considering
the Vanity and mispence of my former days. I have trifled long enough in the
way; The night is far spent, the day is at hand: Romans 13.12.
It concerns me now (and now or never) to cast off the works of darkness, and
to put on the armor of light. Hos. 7.9.
Are not gray hairs here and there upon me, and yet I have not laid it to
heart. The time past of my life may suffice me to have wrought the will of the
Gentiles, 1 Pet. 4.3.
when I walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings,
banquettings, and the like enormities. The flower of my days is over, and yet I
have not taken one step Heavenwards. I have often had some faint thoughts, and
feeble resolutions to put on for an Eternal Portion, and they have never
brought forth, but have always withered in the Bud, and proved abortive: and If
I should hold on at this trifling rate; I should lose my self for ever, and my
precious Soul, which is o^ more rate than ten thousan^ Worlds, would never com^
into the Bundle of Life with the Lord my God: 1 Samuel 25.29.
That Blessed Portion which the Lord Christ has purchased by his Precious
Death, and which is now freely offered in the Gospel, would be forfeited by me.
And therefore now I Will press toward the Mark; and the more supin^ and careless
I have hitherto been, so much the more through Grace I hope I shall reach o^
for the future to Those things which are before: Phillipians 3 13, 14. If you
could find you^ hearts working at this rate, i^ would be a good Argument no^
only that your Judgments ar^ convinced, but that your Wi^^ are overcome, and
that the Day of Gods Power has lightened upon you to make you willing. Psalm
110.3.
Do not we see that a man in his Journey, when he has lost some time in his
way, does speed his pace the more, and hasten toward the latter end of the
Day, to redeem the lost time, before Night come on? And do we not see, that the
shorter time a man has to do his work in, having slipped some time already, so
much the more does he double his Diligence, and apply himself to his Business,
that he may regain what is lost, and inn all at latter end? The Case is your
own, you have lost much time, and trifled long in the way; therefore now put on
to make sure your Eternal Portion.

. III.
Thirdly, There Is a possibility that yet you may enjoy an Eternal Good
hereafter, and therefore you should put on. You know not of any definitive
sentence that is out against you, you know not, neither can you say, Heb. 3.18.
Deuteronomy. 29.29.
that God has sworn in his wrath, that you shall never enter into his rest.
Secret things belong to God, but things which are revealed belong unto us, and
to our children. And God never told you, neither has ever revealed it to any
man living, that you shall be excluded his Eternal Mercies; and therefore put
on. Argue with your selves the possibility of Eternal Happiness from the great
sinners that have been received to mercy; were not Manasseh, the prodigal, the
thie^ upon the cross, and Paul (the chief of sinners) all received to mercy? 2 Chronicles. 33.12, 13 Luke 15.20. and 23.43. 1 Timothy 1.15. Were not the Corinthians
as vile as the vilest? such were some of you (says the Apostle) and yet they
were washed, and sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and
by the Spirit of their God. 1 Cor. 6.11. Had not the Ephesians their
conversation in times past, in the Lusts of the Flesh, fulfilling the desires
of the Flesh, and of the Mind, and were by Nature the Children of Wrath, even
as others? And yet God who is rich in mercy did quicken them together with
Christ, Ephesians. 2.3, 4. Consider whilst you are on this side the Grave, there is
hopes, Isa. 38.11.
that yet you may see the Lord in the Land of the Living. Say, surely the Lord
would not have lengthned out my days hitherto, unless he had meant it to be a
space for Repentance, and for a time wherein to turn unto him; he would not
have offered mercy to me thus long, and still hold on to offer mercy, were my
state hopeless, and helpless, and desperate. Were I got beyond the time of
possibility, I should never hear such Gracious Invitations and tenders of mercy
made, as by Gods Messengers and Ambassadors of Reconciliation, are from time
to time held out unto me. Say the Lord would never have put such thoughts into
my Heart, as these, about my present and Eternal state, and his ways and
dealings with me in order thereunto, if there were not a possibility for me to
be saved. I Will conclude therefore that it is possible, and so I Will put on for
it. Why may not I come to enjoy the sure mercies of David, Isa. 55.3.
as well as others? What should let? If I repent truly of my sins, and by a
steadfast Faith, cleave unto the Promises of the Gospel; does not Gods Eternal
Faithfulness back them, and his Justice rest satisfied in the Merit of his Son?
And is not he Faithful and Just to forgive us our sins? 1 John 1.9.
Surely the possibility that yet you may enjoy an Eternal good should be a
cogent argument to put you on.

. IIII.
Fourthly, Not only the possibility, but the probability may much prevail with
you. For on Gods part it seems more probable thou may enjoy an Eternal
Good, than Millions in the World. For howsoever many men by abuse of the means,
may make their condition far worse than that of Heathens and Pagans: yet if we
speak strictly in respect of the means themselves, it is far more probable thou
that have the means, should enjoy an Eternal Good, rather than those that
enjoy them not. The greatest part of the World sits in horrible darkness
without any light: to them the Word has not come, the light of the Gospel
revealing an Eternal Good has not shined forth; so that on Gods part, and the
means, it is far more likely that God wills thy enjoyment of an Eternal
Portion of Good, rather than those to whom he sends no Prophets at all. It is
true, the Word is sometimes sent to harden men, and it becomes the Savor of
Death; but this is after men have horribly abused it: and it is not the proper
and genuine effect of the Word, but accidental through the Indisposition and
Obstinacy of the hearers. Then, only it is, that God says, Go and make the
Heart of this People fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, Isa.
6.10. Well then, let this consideration encourage you to put on for an Eternal
Good: God has not withdrawn, or denied the means to thee; yet he sends his
Prophets, and Ministers to call thee to him: Why does God Vouchsafe all this to
me? Who should awake and bethink themselves if I do not? Who should put on for
^n interest in the Everlasting Good, if I do not, who am so ^ften exhorted? Do
any in the World stir up themselves to ^ake hold of the good of Gods chosen;
and shall not I who en^y the powerful means of Grace? Thus, that probability
which yet thou art under (if du^y considered) may put thee on.

. V.
Fifthly, You know not how ^ong the offer of such a mercy, ^s an Eternal Good,
may be ^ade unto you; and therefore ^ow put on to make it sure. The time of
this offer will not ^ndure for ever. You have now ^n opportunity, but (...),
the opportunity will not ^ong continue: (...), the opportunity is cou^^ed
within time, and you may lose the opportunity, and ye^ time be still.
Opportunity Head is bald behind, post est occasio calva; and so if you let it
sl^^ by, you cannot lay hold on it to pull it back again. Meet opportunity as it
comes, and take it b^ the fore-lock, if you intend the advantage of it. Now you
have the offer of mercy, and Go^ calls upon you; Now he sta^^ at the door,
Revel. 3.20. Cant. 5.2.
and knocks: and (...) Head is filled with dew, and (...) Locks with the drops
of the night You know not how long Merc^ at this wonderful rate may wa^ upon
you; and therefore p^^ on. The Scripture speaks of ^ time of Visitation, a time
of Salv^tion, a time whilst God may (...) found; A time when he hold out the
Golden Scepter; a tim^ wherein the Fountain runs, an^ the Spirit
proclaims, Ho, every one that thirsts, come ye to the waters, Luke 19.44. 2
Cor. 6.^^ Psalm. 32.6. Est. 5.2. Revel. 22.17. Isa. 55.1. Thus Jerusale^ had her
time; and all the several Churches in Asia had their time, and now we have our
time; And if we misimprove this time, and walk unworthy of this Grace, and
Gospel of Christ, this time will have an ^^d, and this Sun will go down at
noon, and set upon your heads, and so set, as to arise no more. That dreadful
Oath Sworn by the Angel with such Solemn Circumstance will be clapped upon our
heads, that there shall be time ^o longer, Revel. 10.6. A time of Grace, no
longer, a time wherein Gods Patience and Longsufferance shall wait upon us, no
longer; a time wherein the Mercies of the Everlasting Gospel shall be tendered
to us, no longer. This day if you will hear my voice, harden not your Hearts,
said God to Israel; but they hardened their Hearts, and therefore God swear to
them in his Wrath, Psalm. 95.8.11.
that they should never enter into his rest. If it be so with us, as it was
with Israel in the Wilderness, we do not know but this very day the Lord may
clap an Oath upon our Heads, that we shall never enter into his rest. Therefore
take the time now, and learn of the Ant, Prove. 6.8. Prove. 10.5.
that provideth her me^ in Summer, and gathers her for in Harvest. Be as the
Wise So^ (of whom Solomon speaks) tha^ gathers in Summer. Consider the time
of Mercy hastes away* and we cannot, with Joshua, bid this Sun stand still.
There is n^ Market, nor Fair day, that lasts always; if the country w^^ not
come in, the Trades-ma^ will at last put up his wares: S^ the Lords standing
may be open, and his shop free, for suc^ and such a time; but if Soul will not
come in, and buy without money, and without price, h^ will at last put up his
wares (a^ his Jewels of Grace) and the^ be gone. Oh then, do not sle^^ in
Harvest to the shame and confusion of your Souls: but say thi^ is our time, and
therefore what we will do for our Souls, we will do it now. Surely better it is
now to accept of the best Mercies offered, than in pain, and torments to wish
for Mercy; when the least of Mercies will not be granted, even one drop of
water to cool the Tongue, Luke 16.24.

. VI.
Sixthly, Consider the assistance that is now offered you in order to the
enjoyment of a Blessed Portion; and this will be a great encouragment for you
to put on. You have assistance offered, and such as if you close with will not
fail to help you forwards to the obtainment of what is desired. Though the end
designed be never so Glorious, yet if difficulty obstruct in the way, and the
helps to carry on the design be slender, or none at all, this will wonderfully
check the undertaking, and render the attempter despondent in his hopes. What
can he do, with whom there is no power, and who has no helps* as to the
effecting matters high and arduous? Will not his Spirit fail, as the body does
succumb, and crouch down under a burden? But now if assistance and help comes
in, and such as may raise the hopes upon account of probability to attain
what is aimed at; this revives the man, and stirs up strength: these hopes and
helps do reinforce, and give encouragment to put on. Thus it is with mortal men
in order to the enjoyment of this Eternal Portion. When they reflect upon their
own weakness, and consider the difficulties in the way; when the height and
dignity of the prize is objected, and the lowness of their present state
considered, their Hearts may well sink down in a despairing despondence, and
they desist, as men out of Heart and Hope. But now when ^ssistance and help is
offered, and ^uch as will undoubtedly (if well ^ccepted) in the end effectually
^ring forth; how will this re^ew the strength, and engage ^he Heart to more and
fresh at^emps? You need not want help, though never so weak in your ^elves, to
carry on the most Glo^ious design for the Eternal Good of your Immortal Souls.
God himself offers to come in to ^elp: The Lord is your helper. Psalm. 72.12
Nehem. 9.20.
He offers you his Spirit; He ^^ve his good Spirit unto Israel to ^^struct
them, and withheld not his Manna from their mouth. The Spirit that proceeds
from the Father, and the Son, is offered ^ou to guide you into all truth, Joh.
16.13 Psalm. 19.105. Psalm. 119.130.
and to show you things to come. You have the Word of God to be a Lamp unto
your Feet: and a Light unto your Fath^^ though you are ignorant, yet this word
is an enlightening help; the entrance of thy word gives light, it gives
understanding unto the simple, says the Psalmist. The ve^ Angels are
Ministering Spirits se^ forth to Minister for them, Heb. 1.14
who she be Heirs of Salvation. Psalm. 91.12
And the shall bear you up in their hands lest you dash your Foot against
stone. The Messengers and M^nisters of the Gospel, they a^^ for your help, and
you may r^ckon of them, as yours: Wheth^ Paul, 1 Cor. 3.22. 2 Cor. 1.24. 1
These. 2.7, 11. Col. 1.28.
or Apollo, or Cephas, the are all yours: and are helpers (...) your joy; they
Cherish you as Nurse does her Children, they e^hort and comfort you, as a Fath^
does his Children: Their ende^vours are to present every m^ perfect in Christ
Jesus. Ephesians. 4.12. Ephesians. 6.11.
They a^ the gifts of Christ unto h^ Church, for the perfecting of (...)
Saints, for the work of the Mi^stery, for the edifying of the be^ of Christ.
You have the who^ Armor of God, which you m^ put on to fence you against t^
fiercest Assaults and Encounte^ of your Spiritual Foes in yo^ travail toward
your Heavenly Canaan: This is offered you, and it is Armor of proof, complete,
for the whole man, wherein you may defy the Devil and all his Instruments,
Ephesians. 6.13, 14.
and be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Consult the Apostle
about this Spiritual Armor, and the encouragment given by him thereupon, and
see whether ^his will not put you on. You ^ave moreover your Viaticum said in
for the way; and still in ^eadiness upon occasion: the Lord will make you to
lie down in ^een pastures, Psalm. 23.2, 3, 5.
and will lead you ^side the still waters: he will pre^are a table before you,
and your ^p shall overflow. If your Souls ^e a fainting by the way, he is ^ill
ready to restore you, he re^oreth my Soul, says the Psal^st. You shall not
want the ^st and sweetest of Soul refresh^g comforts in your journey to^ards
your Heavenly Sion, Isa. 43.2.
the ^rd himself will be with you, and your Companion. Isa. 63.9.
Though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil:
for thou art with me, thy Rod, and thy Staff, they comfort me. Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow (...) all the days of my Life, and I wi^ dwell in the
House of the Lord for ever, Psalm. 23.5, 6. Oh therefore, since you have so man^
helps offered in order to you^ enjoyment of an Eternal Good let these encourage
you wit^ confidence to put on: Why d^ you thus loyter and loose tim^ in the
way? Oh, suffer not the^ helps any longer in vain to wa^ upon you, whilst, you
triffle a^ way your own Salvation.

. VII.
Seventhly, Consider an interest ^n this Eternal Portion will a^undantly make
up and answer whatsoever of want and perplex^ent your Spirits may meet ^ith or
labor under in this pre^ent World, and therefore put ^n for the enjoyment of
it. ^here cannot any cross nor af^ction here befall you, but an ^nterest in
this Eternal Good ^ill bear up your Hearts. This ^ill keep your Heads above
wa^er, and still secure you from ^rowning, amidst the cross Seas, and contrary
surges of the trou^lesome Ocean of this World. ^ou shall not sink, whilst you
^ave the Plank of an everlasting ^ood to ride upon. And therefor put on for
it. Though you ^e troubled on every side, yet you shall not be distressed:
though you ^e perplexed yet you shall not be (...) despair: though you be
persecuted, yet you shall not be forsaken ^ though you be cast down, yet you
shall not be destroyed. Whence is all this? Because you have an interest in
this Eternal Treasure* 2 Cor. 4, 7. 8. Nay such is the virtue thereof that it
will no^ only supply the want, but it w^ do more; through Christ yo^ shall not
only Conquer, but b^ more than Conquerours, says the Apostle. Romans 8.37. Wh^
would not be Ambitious of suc^ a Sovereign remedy still at han^ against all
distempers, of such ^ strengthening Cordial against a^ discouragments, and such
a s^ supply against every want ^ The Philippians were not onl^ exposed to
wants, but probabl^ exercised under many; No^ the Apostle opens unto them ^
Fountain of full supply, where^ they might have free recours^ and by Faith be
interested in* My God (says he) shall supply a^ your need, according to his
rich^ in glory, by Christ Jesus, Phil. ^ 19. From hence it was that the Apostle
had that excellent Lesson of contentment insculpt upon his Heart in every
condition, Phil. 4.11. He that has ^an interest in this Eternal Por^ion is the
only happy man, how miserable soever he appear in ^he World: he is the truly
rich man, how poor and indigent soever as to his outward condition he may seem
to be: He has that Philosophers stone that turns all to Gold. He sleeps as
quiet^y when he has but a stone for ^his Pillow, as Old Jacob did, Genesis 28.11
when he was on his way to his Uncle Laban. His mind is not only brought down
to his condition, and equalled with his estate (wherein the quintessence of
contentment lies) but his Heart is raised above these things to converse about
his Eternal Portion by Divine contemplation; and seeing his interest there,
this gives him satisfaction. Jam. 2.5.
Thus the poor of this World are (said to be) rich i^ Faith; being Heirs of the
Kingdom, which God has promised t^ them that love him. Oh then, pu^ on for an
interest in this Inheritance, which will be as a Panpharmacon for all your
grievances: as wherewith you man check your Worldly Fears, remove Carnal
Doubts, and qui^ your minds under Earthly di^contentments: from hence yo^ may
fetch a supply adequate t^ all your wants, a Plaster abroad, as any of your
sores* and this you may effectually oppose to the All that may seem t^ be
against you in this World The want of an interest here, o^ of the actual
knowledge and application of it, is that which destroys Persons: and so they
cry out as miserable undone creatures, when they fall under, o^ are to
encounter with any cros^ Providence in this World.

. VIII.
Lastly, Consider, if you miss of an Eternal Portion, though you have never so
much of Outward, you are undone for ever. What shall it profit a man, if he
shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Mar. 8.36.
says our Savior. Many think they have well provided for themselves, their
Families, and Posterity, having got a large Portion of outward good things, so
as their Cup is full; when in the mean while they know not, neither much matter
it, how, or what claim they can lay to the things of Eternal Moment: wherein
yet if you fail, all your Externals will yield ye no advantage, but you are
undone for ever. When you are at the point to die, and then shall perceive that
you have vainly trifled away Eternity for some transient Pleasures, or
temporary Good Things, which now you must utterly part withal; you will then say
of all your worly good, as Esau sometimes did of his Birthright, (though he
from a profane discontented Spirit, and you from deep conviction) Behold I am
at the point to die; and what profit shall the good things of this life do to
me? Then there is no hope in them, nor help from them, nor staying by them;
they all become blasted, withered, dead, and dry. The Bud yields no Meal: Hos.
8.7. You shall then find, that you have all your life-long but Sown the wind;
and now must reap the Whirlwind. And ('it is Solomon's question) what profit has
he, that has labored for the wind? Eccles. 5.16. Oh therefore lose not the
Substance whilst you catch at Shadows; neither exchange an Eternal Portion
offered, and brought to hand, for a worldly good flying from you, whilst you do
pursue it. And if it chance you overtake, and so be answered in the desires of
your hearts, yet missing of the true good, you shall find your Gain to be your
loss, and your loss such, as is irreparable by all your gain. The loss it will
be of your Souls; and what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul? Now these
Considerations duly weighed, Mar. 8.37.
methinks should rouse up and awaken the dull and supine Spirits of poor
Mortals to put on for Eternity, now in this their day. Let us fear (says the
Apostle to the Hebrews) lest a Promise being left us of entering in^o his rest,
any of you should seem ^o come short of it: Heb. 4.1. The Promise is left to
us, as well as unto them, and it stands sure: But now to take up short of this
Promise, and so to miss of it, is ^o deprive our selves of all the Good that is
in it; and then, though we have never so much of worldly good, yet we are
utterly undone for ever.

CHAP. XII.
WE have diverse Arguments to stir us up to put on for an Eternal Portion, and
to lift up our heads, and look beyond present things. The door by which an
Entrance is to the enjoyment of an eternal Good, stands open for all Comers
who have an heart to enter There is as fair a way for the poorest sort who have
but a little Portion in this World, to have the God of Heaven and Earth to be
their Portion: to have whatsoever Jesus Christ has Purchased by his Blood, to
be their Portion; to have Heaven, and Eternity, and immortality to be their
Portion; as there is for the Greatest Potentate in the World. Many poor people
are ready to say, Alas, I am poor, I have little, I know little, I am able to
do little; I live upon others Charity, how shall I ever come to enjoy an
Interest in this Eternal Portion? My Father is dead, and has left me no
Portion, and my Friends they are poor, and those few of them that are
otherwise, they overlook me. I, but for all this, you may come to have a
Portion: It Is possible some poor Wretches may have a Portion in God, and
Christ, and Immortality, as well as the greatest and richest of all. Raise up
therefore your hearts, you that are poor and mean; and know, that you are born
for high things: How meanly soever you live now, you may be glorious Creatures
hereafter, if so be you have an heart to put upon it, and to seek after this
Eternal Portion. But now, you will all say, Lord, what should we do, that our
Portion may be an higher Portion, and our Good a more choice Good, than this
World is able to vouchsafe unto us? Oh, says the rich man, that is truly and
thoroughly convinced of the insufficiency of all Worldly Good, as to Eternal
Satisfaction (for though it is hard for such to be convinced, yet not
impossible, and with God most easy) What shall I do, that I may enjoy this
blessed Portion? And says the poor man, Since it is possible for the poorest and
meanest Wretches to have an Interest in this Eternal Good, I am resolved to
cast in my Lot, and what shall I do? Now the Directions that I would lay before
you (some whereof may suit all sorts, and all of them one or other) are these
that follow.

. I.
First, If you would have the Good Things of Eternity for your Portion, then
consider from whom Every good gift, Jam. 1.17.
and every perfect gift does come; and pray to the Father of Lights, that he
would vouchsafe you an Interest in that Eternal Portion. As Prayer at all times
is a Christians duty; so when Matters of Great Concernment are before us, no
less than the Everlasting Welfare of the Immortal Soul, surely then this Duty
is firstly to be practiced. Therefore begin with Prayer; we ought not to set
about any of our lawful and just Callings, without a particular addressing our
selves to God. This was the practice of good Eleazar, Abraham's Servant, when
he was employed in finding out a Wife for his Master's Son; O Lord God of my
Master Abraham, Genesis 24.12
I pray thee send me good speed this day: And this also was the practice of
good Nehemiah, Neh. 2.4.
in the distresses of the people; I prayed unto the God of Heaven, and then I
spoke unto the King. These were but Matters of a temporal concern, how much
more than is Prayer to lead the way in Matters of Eternal Moment? The remisness
of Christians in this Duty shall be condemned by the very Heathens, who in this
Point shall rise up in Judgment against many profane Christians, who look
oftener upon their Gold, than upon their God, as Salvian speaks. We read often
in their Writings, that in any general Calamity, they did jointly Morbis
grassantibus vel prodigiis nunciatis, pacem Deum exposci moris erat: vide
Brisson de Formul. l. 1. page 81. Edit. 1592.
implore the Peace and Favor of their Idolatrous Gods: that in any Plin.
Panegyr. Been ac sapienter majores instituerunt ut rerum agendarum, ita dicendi
initium a praecationibus capere, etc. Sueton. in Aug. cap. 35. Vide Brisson. de
Form. l. 1. p. 42. Et Coquei Comment. in Aug. de Civit. Dei, lib. 2. cap. 8.
number. 2.
matter of Consequence they made their entry upon it by Prayer, commending the
success thereof to the Power and Providence of those Deities which they
believed. Insomuch that we read of Livius, lib. 26. A. Gell. Noct. Attic. lib.
7. ca. 1. Cujus ab adolescentia vita describitur Diis dedita, templisque
nutrita. Aug. de Civit. Dei lib. 3. c. 21.
Pub. Scipio a great Roman, that he ever went to the Capitol, before to the
Senate, and began all the Businesses of the Commonwealth with Prayer. How much
more then ought we to do it, who have not only the Law and Dictate of Nature to
guide us; who have not deaf and impotent Idols to direct our Prayers to, as
their Gods were: but have,

First, The Law of Christ requiring it; Pray always: Ephesians. 6.18. Pray without
ceasing: 1 These. 5.17. In every thing by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God: Phil. 4.6. Who have,

Secondly, The Example of Christ to enforce it; whose custom was to pray not
only Morning and Evening: Luke 22.39. Mark 1.35. Matthew. 14.23. but upon every
other solemn occasion. As for Example, before his Preaching: Mark 1.35, 38.
before his Eating: Mark 6.41. before the Election of his Disciples: Luke 6.12,
13. before his Transfiguration in the Mount: Luke 9.28, 29. before his Passion:
Matthew. 26.36. John 17.1. and in his Passion: Hebr. 5.7. Who have,

Thirdly, From Christ that [legitimate, ordinary, fundamental Prayer (as
Tertul. de Orat. cap. 9.
Tertullian calls it) the Lord's Prayer] not only appointed for our use, but as
a Rule and Directory by him framed, to instruct us how to pray, and to bound
and confine our extravagant and vast Desires.

And,

Fourthly, Who gave the Altar of Christ to receive; the Incense of Christ to
perfume; the Name and Intercession of Christ, to present our Prayers unto God
by: Who have Christ sanctifying; and, as I may so speak, Praying our Prayers
unto his Father for us. As we read of the Angel of the Covenant, who had a
Golden Censer, and much Incense, to offer up the Prayers ^f the Saints: Rev.
8.3, 4. which was nothing else but the Media^ion of Christ, bearing the
Ini^uity of our holy things, as Aaron was appointed to do; Exodus 28.38. nothing
but his Intercession for us at the right hand of his Father: Romans 8.34.

How much then (these things considered) not only of Reason, but Encouragement
have we to ^eek to God by Prayer, and that ^n the first place, and the rather
when the things we are about are Matters of Eternal Moment. This we shall find
to be an efficacious way, as of gi^ing Glory to God, so to con^ribute to our
own advantage, ^n bringing to pass the Event in Aim. For by this means we do,

1. Acknowledge our Dependency on God as the first Cause* 2 Chronicles. 14.11. and
20.6.
and give him the Glory of his Sovereign Power and Dominion over all Second
Agents, and of effectuallizing all Means in order to the End designed; in
acknowledging that without hi^ we can do nothing: Mat. 8.2.
and this Power of God is the ground o^ Prayer.

2. By this means we put Go^ in mind of his Promises, Isa. 43.26.
and s^ acknowledge not our Dependence on his Power only, bu^ on his Truth and
Goodness too and the Promises and Truth o^ God are the Foundation of a^ our
Prayer. That which encouraged Daniel to set his face t^ seek unto God in prayer
for the restitution of liberty out o^ Babylon, Dan. 9.1, 2, 3.
was God's Truth an^ Promise revealed by Jeremia^ the Prophet, that he would
accomplish but Seventy years i^ the desolation of Jerusalem. That which
encouraged Jehosaphat to seek unto God against the multitude of the Moabites
which came up against him, 2 Chronicles. 20.9.
was his Promise that he would hear and help those that did pray toward his
House in their Afflictions. That which encouraged David to pray unto God for
the stability of his House, was the Covenant and Truth of God; Thou have
revealed to thy Servant, saying, I will build thee an House; 2 Samuel 2.27, 28.29.
therefore has thy Servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
And now, O Lord, thou art that God; that is, the same God in thy fidelity and
mercy, as thou were, and thy Words be true, and thou have promised this
Goodness to thy Servant; therefore let it please thee to bless the House of thy
Servant, etc. Excellent to this purpose is that which Saint Austin observes of
his Mother, who very often and earnestly prayed unto God for her Son, Aug.
Confess. l. 5. c. 9.
when he was an Heretic: Chirographa tua ingerebat tibi: Lord, says he, she
urged thee with thine own Handwriting, she challenged in an humble and fearful
confidence, the performance of thine own obligations.

3. Moreover, by this means we hasten the Performance of God's decreed Mercies:
as also we retardate, yea quite hinder his almost purposed and decreed
Judgments. The Lord had resolved to restore Israel to their wonted Peace and
Honor. Ezekiel. 36.37.
Yet for all these things will I be enquired unto by the House of Israel to do
it for them, says the Prophet. The Lord had threatened destruction against
Israel for their Idolatry, Psalm 106.23.
Had not Moses stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath; as the
Psalmist speaks. And we read of the Primitive Christians, Just. Mart. Apolog.
that their Prayers procured Rain from Heaven, when the Armies of the Emperors
were even famished for want of Water: Tertul. Apolog. ca. 5.
and that their very Persecuters have begged their Prayers. All this is to let
you see, as the Excellency, so the Necessity to season your Undertakings with
Prayer. And now you being to look out after a Matter of so great Moment, as an
Eternal Good for your Immortal Souls: Surely it is requisite to begin with
Prayer. When you consider the Excellency and Worth of the Prize desired; then,
in the sense of your inability, look up to the Power of God as able, to the
Truth of God as faithful to accomplish and make good all his Promises. Say,
that he has commanded us to seek him, Amos 5.4.
to seek his strength and his face; and that he has promised, Psa. 105.4.
that those that ask shall have, Matthew. 7.7.
and they that seek shall find: And that he has promised to give that which is
good; Psa 85.12.
and good gifts to them that ask Luke 11.13.
him: and that he would hasten and speed the Work, when he is sought unto about
it; for before they call, Isa. 65.24.
he will answer: and whiles they are yet speaking, he will hear.

And thus as you are to begin with Prayer, so by Prayer also you are to carry
on and season, as the whole of your Christian Life; so every of those
directions or means, that shall be offered to you, or embraced by you, in order
to the obtainment of your desired End.

. II.
Secondly, Imaginaria in seculo and nihil very. Tertul. de coron. mil. cap. 13.
Would you have an Eternal Good to be your Portion? endeavor then to yet a
true sight and through apprehension of the Nature of all Worldly and Created
Good: See the Vanity that is in it, and the Vexation of Spirit issuing from it.
Consider it in its Insufficiency to satiate the Des^res, and quiet the Motions
of an Immortal Soul. Behold it not as it comes, but as going from you: View not
so much its Face and Promises, as its Back-parts and Disappointments. Lift up
and look under the Vizard that is upon all Worldly Good and see it in its
Intrinsic Nature, and view it fully to its latter end, and then your
Affections cannot but loosen from it, as from a filthy Harlot, whose rotten and
deformed Carcass is only set off with a little Paint, or some outward Dress
and Trimming, on purpose to allure the Simple to destruction. Nay, if there
were any solid Good in these Worldly Enjoyments to be found, (which there is
not) How fleeting and uncertain notwithstanding are they? How short is the time
wherein we may hope for (not promise to our selves at all) a fruition of them?
The words of the Apostle are very Emphatical to this purpose; 1 Corint. 7.29.
The time is short: It remains, that both they that have Wives, be as though
they had none: and they that weep, us though they wept not: and they that
rejoice, as though they rejoiced not: and they that buy, as though they
possessed not: and they that use this World, as not abusing it. That is, as not
to be drowned, and smothered in the Businesses of this Life, as if there were
any fundamental and solid Utility in them; for says he, The fashion of this
World passes away. The Apostle's Exhortation is beset at both ends with a
strong Enforcement: First, The Time is short. The Apostle, as the Learned
conceive, uses a Metaphor from Sails, or Curtains, or Shepherds Tents, (as
Hezekiah makes the Comparison: Isaiah 38.12.) Such things as may be gathered
together into a narrow room. Time is short; that is, that Time which the Lord
has spread over all Things like a Sail, has now this ^ive thousand years been
rol^ing up, and the end is now at hand, as Saint Peter speaks: ^ Pet. 4.7. The
Day is approaching when Time shall be ^o more: And so the Words ^n the Original
will well bear ^t; (...), The remainder of time ^s short, or Time is short, for
so much as yet remains of it to be folded up; and therefore we ought to
behave our selves as men that have more serious things to consider of; as men
that are very near to that everlasting Haven, where there shall be no use of
such Sails any more. And in the Apostle's close the same Reason is farther yet
enforced: For the fashion of this World passes away; (...), the Figure;
intimating that there is nothing o^ any firmness, Quodcunque nunc nascitur
mundi ipsius senectute degenerat, ut nem^ mirari debeat singula in mundo
caep^sse deficere, cum totus ipse jam mundus in defectione sit. Cyprian. Cont.
Them.
or solid Consistancy in the Creature: it is but a Surface, an Outside, an
empty Promise, all the Beauty o^ it is but skin-deep: And the^ that little
which is desirabl^ and precious in the eyes o^ men, (which the Apostl^ calls,
The lust of the World 1 John 2.17.) (...), it passes away, and is quickly gon^
The Word, as the Learned di^ferently render it, has th^^ several Arguments in
it (...) express the Apostle's Exhortation.

1. It [deceives or couzens] and therefore use it, as if you used it not; use
it as a man in a serious business would use a false Friend, that profers his
assistance: though his Protestations be never so fair, yet so employ him, as
that the business may be done though he should fail thee.

2. Transversum agit, It carries a man headlong: The Lusts of the World are so
strong and impetuous, that they are apt to inflame the desires, and even
violently to carry away the heart of a man: And for this cause likewise use it,
as if you used it not; engage your selves as little upon it as you can: do as
Mariners in a mighty Wind, hoise up a few Sails, expose as few of thy
affections to the rage of Worldly Lusts as may be: beware of being carried
where two Seas meet; as the Ship wherein Paul suffered Shipwreck; I mean of
plunging thy self in a Confluence of many boisterous and conflicting
Businesses, lest for thine inordinate prosecution of Worldly Things, the Lord
either give thy Soul over to suffer Shipwreck in them, or strip thee of all thy
Lading and Tackling, break thine Estate all to pieces, and make thee glad to
get to Heaven upon a broken Plank.

3. The Fashion of this World passes over, it does but go along by thee, and
salute thee, and therefore use it, as if thou usedst it not: do to it as thou
would do to a stranger whom thou meetest in the way, he goes one way, and
thou another: Salute him, stay so long in his company til^ from him thou have
received better Instructions touching the turnings and difficulties of thy own
way; but take heed thou turn not into the way of the Creature, lest thou lose
thine own home. Thus if you study the nature of all Worldly En^oyments, and
their insufficiency as to Eternal Satisfaction, you will find from such
^onsiderations an advantage^us Income. The practical knowledge of the vanity of
all ^emporal good, will be one ^ood step in the way toward ^he enjoyment of
Eternal.

. III.
Thirdly, Get an Eye of Faith, to look through and above the Creature. A man
shall never get to look off from the World, til^ he can look beyond it. For the
Soul will have hold fast of something, and the reason why me^cling so much to
the Earth, is because they have no assurance if they let go that hold, of
having any Subsistence else where Labor therefore to get an interest in
Christ, to find an everlasting footing in the stedfastness of Gods promises in
him and that will make thee willing to suffer the loss of all things; Phil. 3.8.
i^ will implant a kind of hatred and disestimation of all the mos^ precious
endearments which the Soul did feed upon before. St Peter says of wicked men,
that they are Pur-blind, they cannot see a far off; (...).
they can see nothing but that which is next them, and therefore no marvel if
their thoughts cannot reach unto the end of the Creature. There is in a dim eye
the same constant and habitual indisposition, which sometimes happens unto a
sound Eye, by reason of a thick mist: though a man be walking in a very short
lane, yet he sees no end of it: (...) Arist. Rhet l. 2.
and so a natural man cannot reach to the Period of Earthly things; Death and
Danger are still a great way out of his sight. Whereas the eye of Faith can
look upon them as already expiring, and through them look upon him, who
therefore gives the Creatures unto us, that in them we might see his Power, and
taste his Goodness. And nature it self methinks may seem to have intended some
such thing as this in the very order of the Creatures: downwards a man's eye
has something immediately to fix on, all is shut up in darkness save the very
surface, to note, that we should have our desires shut up too from those
Earthly things which are put under our feet, and hid from our eyes, and buried
in their own deformity. All the beauty and all the fruit of the Earth is placed
on the very outside of it, to show how short and narrow our affections should
be toward it. But upward the eye finds scarce any thing to bound it; all is
transparent and diaphanous, to note how vast our affections should be toward
God, how endless our thoughts and desires of his Kingdom, how present to our
Faith the Heavenly things should be even at the greatest distance. The Apostle
says, Heb. 11.1.
that Faith is the substance of things hoped for, that it gives being and
present subsistency to things far distant from us, makes those things, which in
regard of natural causes are very remote, in regard of Gods promises to seem
hard at hand. And therefore though there were many hundred years to come in the
Apostles time, and for ought we know, may yet be to the dissolution of the
World: yet the Apostle tells us, that even then it was the last hour; (...). 1 John 2.18
because Faith being able distinctly to see the truth, and promises of God, and
the endlesness of that life which is then presently to be revealed, the
infinite excess of vastness in that, made that which was otherwise a great
space, even seem as nothing, no more in comparison than the length of a Cane or
Trunk, through which a man looks on the Heavens, or some vast country. And ever
the greater Magnitude or light there is in a body, the smaller will the medium
or distance seem from it: The reason why a Perspective Glass draws remote
Objects close to the eye, is, because it multiplies the Species. We then by
Faith apprehending an infinite, and everlasting Glory must needs conceive any
thing through which we look upon it, to be but short and vanishing. And
therefore though the promises were a far off in regard of their own existence,
yet the Patriarchs did not only see but embrace them; their Faith seemed to
nullify and swallow up all the distance. Abraham saw Christ's day and was glad;
Joh. 8.56.
He looked upon those many ages which were between him and his promised seed,
as upon small and inconsiderable distances in comparison of that endless Glory
into which they ran; they were but as a Curtai^ or piece of Hangings, which
divide one room in a House from another. Labor therefore to get a distinct
view of the height* and length, and breadth, and depth, and the unsearchable
love o^ God in Christ, and to find in thy own Soul the truth of God in his
promises, and that his word abides for ever, and that will make all the Glory
of other things to seem but as grass.

. IIII.
Fourthly, Would you have this Eternal good to be your Portion, then labor to
take off your Hearts from all the outward comforts, that are in this present
World. Let not your Spirits bottom here. Men naturally fix upon things that are
here below, and look no higher: The borders of this World are the utmost
confines of their thoughts, they look no further. All their care and study is,
what they shall eat, Mat. 6.31.
and what they shall drink, and wherewithal they shall be clothed. The bent of
their Hearts, Thoughts and Works, is wholly intended to resolve the old doubts,
which Carnal Men do make, how to satisfy the Lusts of the old man by gathering
together a stock of Worldly Comforts? In this bottom we find all their Hearts
imbarqued. But now if you have a desire to look upwards, and to trade toward
Eternity; let your Souls loose from these outward Comforts; Faith (as was told
you) to see beyond them, will loosen your Souls from them: shake them off your
Hearts, as S. Paul did the Viper from his hand. Act. 2^.5.
Solatio miserorum, non gaudia beatorum. Aug. Epist. 119.
Look upon them no further than as merely serviceable to you in the way toward
you^ journies end; whereto yet the^ can contribute no further but only as a
Viaticum for the body: If your thoughts entertain them at any higher rate, they
will prove a snare and clog unto you in the way. They that will be rich, 1 Timothy
6.9.
fall into Temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful Lusts
which drown men in destruction and Perdition. Know, it is not necessary that
you should be rich, and great, and eminent in this World: or that you should
have great Estates and incomes here, that is not necessary. But it is necessary,
say, that I should have my Heart established with grace, Heb. 13.9. It is
necessary that I have peace with God, and that my sins be pardoned, and my Soul
renewed; It is necessary that I should provide for my Soul, and look after the
things of Eternal moment: but how things go here with me in this present World,
there is no great necessity so much to concern my self, or be affected with
them. Thus if you will have an interest in the better Portion, let your Hearts
loose from Worldly Comforts. Meditate often upon that saying of our Savior
Christ, what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole World, and lose
his own Soul? Mark. 8.36. Pray that the Lord would give you the true sense and
understanding of this Text, that you may know and inwardly digest the meaning
of it, and find that virtue in it, as may loose your Hearts from this present
World.

. V.
Fifthly, Let the whole course of your life be carried on in the fear of God,
and thence seasoned with a fear, lest that here should be the All, that ever
you are like to enjoy. As this was made use of as a sign before, so now as a
means. Let the whole course of your life be steered (as it were) with the fear
of God, lest that God should put you off with present things. Think oftentimes
with your selves, what if I should never enjoy more good, than here I have, and
that with this present life all my good should end? Should God now this night
take me away out of the Land of the living, and give me my Portion in the
Infernal Pit of darkness, what would all the good of this present life avail
me? Had it not been infinitely better that I had never known it, nor enjoyed it,
than thus to be put off with it; and for a few transitory hours of fading
comforts, now to lie howling under the justly deserved wrath of an infinite God
in pains unsufferable to all Eternity? Often do you meditate and think upon
the conditions of those, how infinitely forlorn they are, to whom it falls out
to be their lot to have all their good things here. Think with your selves,
that though they now abound in all wealth and store, yet you even see them on
slippery ground, Psalm. 73.18, when all their good and jolly thoughts shall
perish, and they never like to enjoy good hereafter any more. Let the course of
your life be seasoned with such thoughts as these. And especially you that have
great Portions in this World, and you know that hitherto you have done God, his
Church, or People, little or no service; you have not served him in the
abundance and fullness you do enjoy. You know there are many poor People that
live upon Alms have done God more service, and have contributed more to the
Honor of his name, than you have done with all your wealth in all your days.
Oh, you have great cause to fear, lest you be the persons who may take up with
this World, and for whom there is no good reserved in the World to come. Rulers,
and governors and the great men of the World had need here be cautioned to
consider, as having cause to fear lest here should be their All. Oh, that
amidst their fullness they would mind their latter end. Chrysostom, on the
thirteenth Chapter to the Hebrews speaking of Governors, has such a Speech as
this, I wonder (says he) that any governer should be ^aved. We will not say
so. But they are liable to a great deal of temptations, and to assaults that
are much more furious and violent to the carrying them away, than others are,
who want those Worldly Comforts and advantages which they do enjoy. And our
Savior Christ tells us, that a man who has a great Portion in this World,
though it is possible he may have more hereafter, yet it is hardly, Mat. 19.23,
24. Oh, therefore fear lest your good things here should be your All.

. VI.
Sixthly, Honor the Lord with your substance here: It is the wise man's
Counsel, Prove. 3.9. If you would not be put off with a Portion in this World,
then improve the Portion that God gives you here to the Honor of his name in
order to the life to come. Think, that you cannot better lay out your Estate
and enjoyments, than in and about the service of God, who does expect it from
you, as having for that, chiefly, amongst other ends, entrusted you with, and
lent it for a while unto you. You are here no more nor otherwise than as
stewards, and the commitment of these outward mercies for a time is to you: but
if you shall not be faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to
your trust the true riches? Luke 16.11. Oh! therefore improve and lay out your
Estate for God. Be convinced of one Principle in Divinity more, Si bona hujus
mundi desunt, non per mala opera quaerantur; si adsunt in mundo, per bona opera
serventur in caelo. Aug Epist. 205.
and that is this that there is more excellency and good in one virtuous
action, than there is in all the creatures in Heaven and Earth (besides the
works of Angels, and others of the Saints; excepting them:) Take all Creatures,
Sun, Moon, Stars, Seas, Earth, all the riches in the World, the choicest
Jewels, richest Pearls, put all together; this is a truth in Divinity, that
there is more excellency in one virtuous action, than there is if thou had
all those things to be thy possession. If men were convinced of this, they
would be abundant in good works then; they would surely be rich in good works,
ready to distribute, willing to communicate, and so lay up in store for
themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold
on Eternal Life. 1 Timothy 6.18, 19. Oh, labor to Honor God with your
Substance, dedicate some good part of your Substance to God; and as God has
blessed you, lay something still aside; If you think God will not reward such a
quantity as the Tenth, why then Honor him with a ninth, or an eighth, or a
seventh, or a fifth, with something I say, that shall show you are desirous to
obey every Commandment, and so to prove your selves sincere to God. Surely to
mark how God prospers a man's labor, and then to be constant in laying aside a
good Portion for God, this shall be none of mine, it shall be Gods, ready at
hand for pious uses, to keep up, and beautify Gods House, to strengthen the
hands of Gods Messengers, to further Gods Worship any way, and to relieve the
poor Members of Christ, would make you so rich in good works, and so increase
your liberality by exercise; as would undoubtedly pull a rich blessing upon
you, and cause you to have interest into the blessing of having your prayers to
run over with increase. Show your selves liberal to God, check not with
niggardize the Profession of your lips; for so you give others reason to think
(though your selves be so full of self love, that you will not think so) that
you draw near unto him with your mouth, and with your lips only do honor him;
but your Heart is removed far from him, Isa. 29.13.

If any say his state is so poor that he cannnot. I answer

God has propounded this as a means to get riches; and the poor man has no
reason to think that Gods means will be unavailable. But a poor necescitous man
that is fain to live of the bounty much what of others, must not be a rule for
those that have better Estates. I am verily persuaded, that one great cause of
many a Christian man's poverty, is this; he Honors not God with his riches, and
why should God make him rich? If we see a man not to Honor God with his wit,
or strength, and then God deprive him of wit, and strength; do we not readily
impute this cross to the desert of that sin? And why are we not induced to
conclude, God does not prosper this man in his Estate, because he did not
Honor God with his Estate? You think it is a brave thing that you have so much
coming in by the Year, do but one good action for God out of an upright
Principle, and there is more excellency in that one action, than there is in
this Estate, if thou had ten thousand times more added to it. There is a
richness in good works, as well as in any Estate; 1 Timothy 6.17, 18.
So the Apostle, Charge them that are rich in this World, that they be rich in
good works. Oh, improve, lay out your Estate for God. S. Ambrose in his Sermons
upon the rich man, says he, Is it not more Honor, that so many Children shall
ask of you as their Father, than that so many pieces of Gold shall call you
their Lord? The pieces of Gold, they do (as it were) call you Lord: and there
are two or three Children shall call you Father; is there not more excellency,
to have a couple of Poor Orphans, while you are alive in this World, to call
you Father, than to have so many baggs of Gold call you Master? Oh, therefore
lay out your Portion for God, Give a Portion to seven, and also to eight. Eccl.
11.2.
Make to your selves Friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye
fail, they may receive you into Everlasting Habitations, Luke 16.9.

. VII.
Seventhly, Would you have an interest in this Eternal Portion, then make
Christ your Portion here; Take not up with any thing in this present World
short of the Lord Jesus: fix not your Heart below him, who is the strength of
the Heart, Psalm. 73.26.
and the Portion for ever. They only are the Generation, for whom the good
things of Eternity are reserved, to whom God has given, and who accordingly
accept of the Lord Christ as their Portion here: who take him as the chiefest
of ten thousands, and prefer him before all, and so he becomes to them an
Everlasting Foundation. In eo fundamentum non est Christus, cui caetera
praeponuntur. Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. 21. c. 26.
You have the Lord Christ offered daily unto you in the Ministry of the Word,
he is held forth in the Gospel of Reconciliation, and held forth to you, to be
accepted by you, and upon Gospell-terms embraced, to become your own to all
sanctifying, and saving ends and purposes: on this errand the Ministers of the
Gospel are sent, to Preach Christ Crucified, and to tender him unto you, to
beseech you to receive and entertain him, and to pray you, in Christ's stead, as
his Ambassadors, to be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5.20. They are sent to hold
forth his excellencies, to Preach his unsearchable riches, to open his
benefits, (...). Ephesians. 3.8.
to make known the privileges and blessings you shall partake of, by your
acceptance of him: amongst which this is one we are to Publish, and upon Gospel
trust to tender, even a right in him to an Everlasting Portion, 1 Pet. 1.4.
an Inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away,
reserved, in Heaven for you: This undoubtedly is yours, if Christ be yours: Nay
all things are yours, whether Life, or Death, 1 Cor. 3.21, 22.
or things present, or things to come, ^ll are yours: if Christ be yours. Oh
therefore lay out for him, and make him your Portion ^ere; God offers him, and
would give him, do not you ne^lect so great Salvation. Heb. 2.3. Act. 13.46.
Judge ^ot your selves unworthy of Everla^ting Life by putting away from ^ou
this Blessed Portion, which ^n, and with Christ is held out unto you. An
accepting of him ^y a true Faith now in this pre^ent World, will undoubtedly
^^sue to a full fruition of him, and of perfect happiness in him, (...) the
World to come. The ^olly of men in this respect is ^xceeding palpable, who
having ^ Glorious end set before them, and means Infallible conducing to that
end, without or beside which, it is given in assurance to them that they shall
never attain that end; and they are convinced that the end is truly excellent
and desirable, the mean probable and easy to be attempted; and they have some
fai^ thoughts toward it, and co^^ wish the enjoyment of it, th^^ they might
dye the Death of ^^e righteous, Number. 23.10.
and that their last^d might be like his; yea, and perhaps they have some
hopes, but vain, and upon empty grounds that it shall go well with them* and
yet they will not enter into the way, nor accept the mean^ appointed for the
obtainment o^ the end. They regard not t^ make Christ their Portion her^ and
yet they hope for an Eternal Portion of good things her^ after: Whereas Christ
is the way, John. 14.6.
the truth, and the life, the hope to come to life, and nev^^ set one step in
the way, nor regard whether there be a work of true saving Grace and Faith upon
their Hearts, or no. Is not this palpable madness? Is not this self-condemning
folly? And yet we find the whole World to lie a-sleep in this secure condition,
without God and Christ; insensibly sliding down into deep destruction, whilst
by a cursed Hope-well they promise good unto themselves, and yet the proper and
only means appointed by God, for the attainment of that good (and without which
there is no hope) is laid aside, and wholly neglected of them.

. VIII.
Eighthly, See to the services you perform to God, that they be choice
services. Do you look for the good of Gods chosen? Psalm. 106.5. then your
services should be chosen services. True it is the Inheritance is given upon
the account of Sonship, and not Servitude: but yet these Sons are to Honor
their Father in a way of Service, they are to show their Obedience by serving
him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of
their Lives. Luke 1.74, 75.
Our Savior Christ, though he were a Son, yet (says the Apostle) he learned
Obedience; and being made perfect is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to
all them that obey him, Heb. 5.8, 9. Service here goes before the reward
hereafter, though the reward is not reckoned of Debt, but of Grace: for when we
have done all those things that are commanded us (were that possible, or within
our compass) yet we are unprofitable Servants, and have done but that which was
our duty to do, Luke 17.10. Now if you expect choice mercies, let your
services be choice services; such as in some measure may aim at an Heavenly
Portion. Let your services, as on the one hand influenced on by, so on the
other be tendent to the Grace of Eternal Life. How should your services be
seasoned with Faith, and Fear, and Self-denial? How should they be sprinkled
with the salt of the Graces of Gods Spirit? If you expect, and move toward an
Eternal Portion; how serious and earnest, how real and intended should your
thoughts be, and the workings of your affections in and about your services?
Let your designs in your duties be Heavenly, if you design the Inheritance of
the Saints in Light. See to the choiceness of your Services in their Principle,
end, and manner. A Supernatural Principle is requisite to a Supernatural
Work. Those Principles which are congenite, and naturally inbred, will not
enable to the performance of a Supernatural Work: Joh. 3.6.
For that which is born of the flesh, is flesh; but that which is born of the
Spirit, is Spirit. Grace it is a Supernatural Principle, and works beyond what
conviction merely is able to raise one to, it brings a suitableness between the
Work and the Heart, to which otherwise the Heart will not be inclined, but
naturally is averse and indisposed. Hence all that enmity in Souls that are in
the state of unregeneracy to the things of God; they cannot away with Gods
Service and Worship, the Work of God it is a burden to them, they cannot bear
it; they complain under it, as irksome, tedious, wearysome: saying with those
the Prophet mentions, When will the New Moon be gone, Amos. 8.5. Mal. 1.13.
and the Sabbath? What a weariness is it? They snuff at it. Why is all this;
but because they want a Principle of Grace enclining the Heart toward Gods
Law. Psalm. 119.36.
A Choice Service must have a Choice Principle. And so the end must be suitable
too, or else the Service will not find acceptance. The end has a great
Influence upon the Work to render it acceptable, or rejected: if the end and
aim be toward God, to Honor him, in Obedience to him, to fulfill his Will, to
please him, to testify our Submission to, and dependence upon him, our
thankfulness for mercies received, benefits conferred, and our trust in him:
thus the end's good, and will so far dignifie and put a value upon the Work.
But if the end and aim be toward our selves, as our own praise, Self-esteem,
Worldly credit, if it be to Honor our selves, by seeking to receive Honor one
of another: Joh. 5.44. If the aim be at our profit, advancement, or advantage
in this World, it is a poison to our services; and of such Our Savior Christ
says, Verily I say unto you, they have their reward, Mat. 6.2.5.16. They have
what they aim at, and they have it now. And we are to see that our Services be
Choice in their manner too. The modality of the Act, as well as the matter, and
end thereof, is duly to be considered: Circumstances are to be weighed, not
only the bonum but the been is to be regarded. Seneca, in giving of his rule,
how to know the affections, when they are natural, and when not, says he, you
shall know a natural affection by this, if it be kept within bounds, it is
natural; if it be out of bounds, it is not natural. I Will make use of it in
another way, when you come to the Service of God, if you think to limit God in
his Service; you will go so far, as may be consistent perhaps with ease, or
profit, or credit, and there stop, this is but a natural Service. But if the
Service be Supernatural, you will let out your Hearts (if it were possible)
Infinitely to God. You will propound no bounds, no limits to your Service. And
this is indeed the truth of Grace, when it has the impression of Gods
Infinitness upon it: that the Soul sets no limits, nor bounds in the way of
Grace, but desires to answer God (if it were possible) by an infinite way: as
he is without all bounds and limits, so the Soul would set no bounds nor limits
to Grace in Service. This is a Choice Service, in a Supernatural way.

. IX.
Ninthly, If you would not have your Portion in this world, then be willing to
part with, and freely cast away from you, whatever of your Portion you have
sinfully gotten. Let not the riches of iniquity abide with you, neither what
you have sinfully gotten load conscience any longer. You bear about with you a
secret, and inward witness which is privy to all your ways, and takes
Cognizance of all your dealings. The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord
(says the wise man) searching all the inward parts of the belly, Prove. 20.27.
Now if you are conscious to your selves of any unjust, or unrighteous dealing;
or that you have wrongfully gained by oppression, cousnage, extortion, or
fraud, or by any other unjust, or unwarrantable way, and means, sleep not with
it; lie not down one night with the wages of iniquity in your bosom; do not any
longer maintain a War with conscience about it, neither take part with Carnal
Reasonings to stop the course of good Convictions; but yield and deliver up
your selves in obedience to the revealed will of God. Know that all such sweet
Morsells which you have delightfully swallowed down, and now perforce withhold,
they must up again; And therefore be rather willing to part with them now.
Resolve upon it, whatsoever thou have gotten wrongfully, never to keep ^t
against thy will; but do it willingly, else thou can have no comfort in thy
present Portion, nor an interest in the blessed Portion of the World that is to
come. If there be any true Divinity in the World, this is ^rue: and yet it is
hard to convince any covetous Worldly minded men, who have gotten much this
way. It Is an old rule but a true, that all the Repentance you have in this
World, Non remittitur peccatum nisi restituatur ablatum. August.
all your fasting and sorrow for your sin will never obtain Pardon, without
restitution, if you be able. Unless you do what you are able to restore, you
can never quit your conscience, take comfort, nor have the pardon of that sin.
Consider the Doctrine of our Savior Christ, Mat. 5.23, 24. If thou bring thy
gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy Brother has ought against
thee: leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be
reconciled to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy gift. The Sacrifice of
Repentance, or of a sorrowful Heart (which yet is but Hypocritical, where
there is not Restitution) will not come up with acceptance upon Gods Altar, if
you do not first what you are able to restore, and so sincerely to be
reconciled to your Brother. Notable for this is the example of Zacheus, the
truth of whose Repentance was fully evidenced, and that he was one of those,
whose treasure was laid up in the good things of Eternity, when he does
ingeniously profess, saying, Lord, if I have taken any thing from any man by
false accusation, I restore him fourfold, Luke 19.8. Zacheus was freely to part
with and cast away from him whatever of his Portion he had sinfully gotten: he
was willing to make Restitution for the wrong he had done. Behold here a true
Son of Abraham, a man to whose house Salvation was come. And Jesus said unto
him, this day is Salvation come to this house, for so much as he also is the
Son of Araham.

. X.
Tenthly, If you would have your Portion in the good things of Eternity, then
keep the eye of your Soul fixed upon the good things of the Life to come. A
steadfast fixing of the eye upon an Object will greatly influence upon the Soul
to change, Fugiendum est ad clarissimam patriam: ibi pater, ibi omnia. Aug. de
Civit. Dei.
assimilate, or conform it to the nature of that Object fixed upon: so as the
Soul shall become united with it, interested in it, or shall embrace it, as its
interest. A man that is Worldly minded and whose converse is with terrene
Objects, to these he looks, and in these he lives. This Soul-converse with the
things of this World will so work upon him, as to assimilate and conform him
to the nature of the World, his Heart shall be worldly, his affections Worldly,
his Meditations and Reasonings Worldly; nay he looks upon his interest as
embarked in the things of this World: Thus shall he be blinded as to his
choice concerns; and this from a keeping the eye of his Soul as't were fixed
upon things below. So it is with a Gracious Heart in its motions according to
its temper; by fixing its eye upon Spiritual and Eternal Objects, and
conversing there, it becomes assimilated, conformed, and as it were changed
into the Nature of such Objects, and so becomes Heavenly in its Affections,
Reasonings, and Meditations; and apprehends its interest to lie in these
things: so Divinely raised, and spiritualized shall the due fixing the eye upon
Eternal Mercies render the Heart to be. The ignorance or want of Practice of
this Piece of Divinity renders Christians, to the shame of their Professiion,
so terrene and earthly in their courses, so mean and low in their Performances,
so deficient and deceived as to the fixing their proper interest, so impatient
under Afflictions, unsteady in their motions, and their conversations so below
the Gospel of Christ: that there appears little or no difference betwixt them
and the mere Moral Heathen, unless in their falling short of him in walking up
to the Principles of true Morality: which is matter of great Lamentation. The
Apostle expressly sets down the Influence and Efficacy, that such an open fixing
the eye will have upon the Soul, in 2 Cor. 3.18. But we all (says he) with
open face, beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the
same image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. The
beholding Gods glory in the Glass of the Gospel is Influential by the Spirit
of the Lord upon the beholder, so fixing his eye, to change him into the same
Glorious Image of Righteousness, and Holiness, and that from one degree unto
another; till he grow up into the measure of stature of the fullness of Christ.
Ephesians. 4.13.
Keep therefore the eye of your Soul fixed upon Eternal Mercies. Look not (as
the Apostle says) at the things which are seen, 2 Cor. 4.18
but at the things which are not seen: That so you may be changed into the same
Image, and behold your interest there. You shall experiment a great advantage
accrewing to your Souls in their Christian Course, from an intended bent of
mind to Spiritual Objects: not looking upon them cursorily, and passiing them
over with a transient, and superficial view, but seriously weighing, and duly
considering them, in their breadth, and length, and depth, and height, that so
you may know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, and be filled with
all the fullness of God, Ephess. 3.18, 19.

. XI.
Moreover, If you would have your Portion in the good things of Eternity, set
before you the examples of the faithful, which are upon record for your
direction, and who now enjoy a blessed Portion: and follow them. It Is the
Apostles exhortion, be followers of them, Heb. 6.12.
who through Faith and Patience Inherit the promises. The faithful who are
gone before us, and whose lives and ways are recorded in Holy Scripture, are
proposed as pat^erns for our imitation. To ^his end we have that great Cloud of
Witnesses spread, in ^he Eleventh Chapter, of the Epistle to the Hebrews, that
by their example we may be stirred ^p to lay aside every weight, and the sin
which does so easily beset us, Heb. 12.1, 2.
and to run with Patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus
the Author, and Finisher of our Faith, 1 Cor. 11.1
Be ye followers of me, even as, I also am o^ Christ: Says the Apostle to the
Corinthians. And he tells the Thessalonians, that they, the Apostles, 2 Thessalonians.
3.7.9.
were examples for them t^ follow. We reject the Counsel of God against our
selves, if w^ cast aside the examples of the faithful, whose ways in Christ
are upon record made know^ unto us: and the Scripture, (...) far, as to us, is
rendered va^^ and unprofitable, unless to aggravate our Guilt and Condemnation,
if we have no more regar^ unto it. Wherefore are the^ recorded, but for our
imitat^on? The Praise in the Gospe^ is not more theirs, then the benefit
intended thereby, ours, upon a good improvement of their examples. Do we think
to enjoy a Portion in Eternal Bli^ and Happyness in another way, than the
faithful have attained it, who have gone before us? So as their way was one,
and ours must be another? As if there were not one, but another Gospel? Or as
if the Gospel were diverse from it self? Do you think there are different and
opposite ways to the same blessed end? As though God were not one, his word
one, the way, the truth, and the life one. Surely these Imaginations are vain
and empty, and by the Principles of right reason to be exploded. Let us
therefore arm our selves with the same mind, 1 Pet. 4.1. Phil. 3.16. Hebr. 13.7.
which the faithful had that have gone before us. Let us walk by the ^ame
rule, by which they walked; considering the end of their conver^ation: they
aimed at Happyness, and they constantly held on ^n a way of Holiness to the
en^oyment of it. Phil. 3.17.
Be followers together of me (says the Apostle to ^he Philippians) and mark
them which walk so, as ye have us for an example. Surely this frequent and
earnest pressing the good examples of the faithful for Christian imitation,
argue^ the acceptance of them as patters to be a Christian duty Why are they
urged, if not to be accepted? Why are they se^ before us, if not to be followe^
by us? Etiamsi codices omnes qui toto orb habentur, intercidissent, vita and
passio Christi abund^ Christianis omnibus sufficeret, ad virtutem omnem and
veritatem perdiscendam. Ludov. Blos. specul. spiritual. cap. 10.
But above all set before you that grand examplar, the Lord Jesus Christ, in
his Life and in his Death: he has left u^ an example (says the Apostle^ that
we should follow his steps, ^ Pet. 2.21. By the same wa^ that the Captain of
our Salvation came to the Crown, in the same way are all his followers t^ be
crowned: and none are tru^ly such, but they that are led o^ by him in the same
steps, tha^ he has trodden out before them Oh, therefore follow him, (...) you
expect your Portion wi^^ him. If you look that he (...) dole out your share
unto you from and out of that fullness that is in himself, give up your selves
to be guided by him. As ^ou acccept him for your only Savior, so take him also
for ^our most perfect pattern, 1 Pet. 2.22
who did no sin, neither was guile found ^n his mouth. And then ye, Mat. 19.28.
which have thus followed him in ^he Regeneration, when the Son of Man shall
sit in the Throne of his Glory; ye also shall receive your Crown of Glory that
fades not away, 1 Pet. 5.4.

Twelfthly, Whatever may be ^n hinderance in your course ^owards Eternal good
things, or a let to your enjoyment of them, cast that away, lay that a^ide. The
Christian life it is a ^ace toward the obtainment of a prize. Now we know,
that ^n a race the runners lay aside, and put off whatever may be an ^inderance
or let unto them; They will not carry any thing of weight about them, that may
prove burdensome in their race but in order to their quickness and nimbleness,
and that they may speed away in their course, they fairly acquit themselves of
whatever otherwise might be an occasion of trouble to them. So ought it to be
with true believers, in their Christian race toward the prize that is set
before them. They are to lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so
easily beset them. Heb. 12.1.
Whatever may prove a block in their way or if ported with them, an occasion of
trouble to them, they are to bid adieu unto it. Though it were a right hand, or
a right eye, or a right foot, yet they are to cut it off, and pluck it out, and
cast it from them Though it were the dearest o^ all outward things, yet if i^
would be an hinderance to them in their Heavenly course, they are to say to it,
as our Saviou^ Christ to Peter (diswading hi^ from going on upon that blessed
design, for which he came into the World) Get thee behind me Satan, Mat. 16.23
thou art an offense unto me. Cast it off, throw it aside, whatever offers to
interrupt you in your Heavenly race. Hearken not to the voice of such charms,
who would inchant you, and, by their Soul-deluding sorcery charm you out of the
things that concern your Peace. How many dear lusts, and beloved sins shall you
find smoothly pressing for the yet saving of their lives? Crying, Master yet
save us; let us not thus soon perish, yet a little breathing time; Oh spare us
yet for a little while, torment us not before the time: yet a little sleep, a
little slumber, Prove. 5.22.
a little folding of the hands, and the like; as the sluggard argues himself
into a state of Invincible sloth, and poverty; so sin in its motions is still
importunately pressing, till it get further hold, so as at last the sinner
shall be holden with the cords of his sins. Consider, therefore, when yo^ hear
the voice of these temptin^ Sirens, that their preservatio^ will be your
destruction: kno^ that it is for your life, which they would now bring to the
stake, Prove. 7.23.
that they so earnestly move for a Reprieve. The Counsel that the Lord gives
Jeremiah for the securing himself against his subtle persecutors is good in
this case, Jer. 12.6. Believe them not, though they spea^ fair words unto thee.
Say, you have a race to run, and the sands in the glass are passing too, and
you cannot stand dallying with them any longer: Say, you know their design, and
what lurks in the bottom, that (as Nebuchadnezzar said to his wise men) they
would but gain the time, Dan. 2.8.
that you might lose your prize: and therefore either be gone, or they are dead
before you. Say, you have a race to run which requires speed and have, and
agility; and you have not time now to reason the case any longer with them:
(...), etc. Chrysostom. ad pop. Antioch. hom. 5.
and to carry them any longer with you, you find they are a Mass of deadly
lumber upon your loins. Say, it heartily repents you of your folly that you
have dodg'd with them thus long, and trifled away your precious time, in
harkening to their tempting Pleas, by which you have found your self, through a
sad experience, thus far to have been but gulled all along; and therefore now
you are utterly resolved to bid an everlasting adieu unto them: and that your
Heart rejoices that now at length you shall part with such bad companions as
they now appear indeed to be: and you are much more assured, that should you
hold on to keep them company, they would prove far worse in the latter end,
even bitter as Wormwood, sharp as a two edged Sword; destructive to Soul, and
Body too, depriving you of your Peace, and promoving your Eternal woe. Thus
whatever may be an obstruction to you in your course toward the Crown,
resolvedly lay it by, never to resume it: So lay it by as to forget it too.
This was the Apostles practice in his Christian course and rule to us?
forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things
which are before, he pressed toward the mark, for the prize of the high
calling of God in Christ Jesus, Phil. 3.13, 14.

. XIII.
Lastly, Whatever may help forward or advance your Interest in, and enjoyment
of an Eternal Portion, be sure you cleave to and hold it fast; make use of that
to such an end. He that has a work to accomplish, and his design on foot is
great, the means which is appropriate for the effecting such a work, and the
bringing about such design shall not be neglected by him; but with all
Industrious Diligence, according to the value such Design bears in his
thoughts, you shall find him apply himself unto the means. If a Soldier design
the gaining of a Victory, a Prize, Glory, or the pleasing of his Captain, you
shall have him act accordingly in such ways and means, as probably may conduce
to such an end, arming himself with cou^age and resolution, as well as weapons;
with a magnanimous and heroic Spirit, as well as Shield and Buckler: not
overborn with the love of life, or unmanned with the fear of death, or
entangling himself with the things and cares of this present world. So we find
the Apostles phrase, 2 Timothy 2.4. No man that warreth entangleth himself with
the affairs of this life, that he may please him, who has chosen him to be a
Soldier. So a Christian that has a noble aim, no less than at Eternity, Life,
and Glory; and who accordingly estimates the things aimed at, will not surely
be remiss in the diligent use and improvement of all good means, suitable to,
and appointed for the effecting of his aim. The end will put him upon the
means; and the more excellent the end is in his eye, so much the more
diligently will he intend the means. Now an heavenly Portion, an everlasting
Inheritance the good things of Eternity, the excellency of their Name points at
their Worth, so as no end can be more glorious: and therefore this must needs
spirit to an intention upon the means. Who can think to attain the end of a
Journey, which he never entered upon, nor, in order to it set a foot in the way?
or if he have entered into the way, yet shall linger therein, and make no
riddance? Or shall, after some progress therein made, turn again out of it? Can
this man hope to attain his journeys end? surely no. The slighting of means in
affairs natural or moral, and yet a discoursing of the end, argues the folly
and vanity of such Pretenders: and much more are such pretensions not only
vain, but dangerous, when the Concerns are spiritual to which they are
referred. Do you look for a Portion, an heavenly, and therefore an high, full,
and lasting; then apply your selves to the means conducent to the obtaining of
it. Truly accept, of the Lord Christ tendered in the Gospel; give up your selves
unto him; live the life of Faith; follow after Holiness; learn and practice the
great Lesson of Self-denial; diligently attend God's Ordinances; sanctify
God's Sabbaths, manifest in your whole course a gracious change, and wait
constantly all your days for a glorious change. Consider how the Apostle St.
Paul draws on to a conclusion his Epistle to the Philippians, in these words,
Phil. 4.8.
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are
lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any virtue, and if
there be any praise, think on these things. Keep in mind these things to follow
them and cleave unto them. And add to your faith, virtue (says St. Peter 2
Pet. 1.6, 7
) and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance,
patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and
to brotherly kindness, charity; for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you
abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of our: Lord and Savior Jesus Christ*
Psalm. 16.11.
In whose presence is fullness of joy, and at whose right hand there are
pleasures for ever more. And now, Oh, that these Sayings might sink down into
your hearts, and that you (thoroughly considering the misery of those men that
have their good things in this present life) might never cease your endeavors
in the pursuit of an Eternal Portion, till you come to find and enjoy the true
Pe^rl of price, Mat. 13.45.
even God your God, and Christ your All.

FINIS.
