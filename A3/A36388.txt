TO Sion most beloved I sing,
of Babylon a Song; (J wot
Concerns you more: full well
then ye do think upon.
Belchazer Lo, behold the King
feasting his thousand Lords;
Phoebus and Mars, praised on each string
every day records.
2
The vessels of Gods house in Them,
boldly they drink about:
It Is like His own were made away,
bids holy Things bring out.
Praising the Gods of gold and brass,
of Jron, Wood, and Stone
Which hear nor see, Not out alas
in Court are praised alone.
3
A Hand appeared in his sight,
as he did drink the Wine;
Upon the Wall against the Light,
it Wrote about a Line.
Before his Lords, the Jmage like
of any ghastly Skull;
In knees nor loins, he had no might
not set an hour full.
4
In vain to veiw, who could it read?
Belchazer he does shout,
Calls for Magitians, in with speed
came in; as wise went out.
Caldeans and Southsayers sage,
this meaning he which can;
Of MEAN, MEAN, and so forth,
clothed in purple the Man.
5
Thus now, when all at their wits end
wise men, all those Lords too,
A woman Lo to her they come:
to Learn what is to do.
His Majesty forgets to Supp,
Nobles astonished all:
Musicians may their Pipes put up,
such gazing on the Wall.
6
When mildly came the graceful Queen,
where no small noise did Ring:
Comes to the Banqueting House so wide,
said ever live O King.
Daniel he shall end this strife,
brought with no little speed:
Was by the King saluted thus,
of Thee we stand in Need.
7
Excellent things have heard of thee,
how in my fathers days:
Inspired by the holy gods,
thy sayings truth always.
When vissions divine sent him,
of future things most high:
Then by thy Skill deliverst Them,
decreed which were to die.
8
Make known this Thing, then if thou do
as sailed Thou have never:
Wear gold and purple too, it is Thine,
choice Make of whatsoever.
For Courtly phrase, returned plain,
Sir Keep your gifts in store:
High Offices let others gain,
too much ye have given before.
9
Yet to the King make known I shall,
and read the Writing true:
As sure as in thy Treasure house,
where all the world may veiw.
The vessels of my God are brought,
also as J am one,
Of the Captivity that mourn,
in BABYLON so Long.
10
For vessels which profand by Thee,
before the End: it is sent
Not ignorant of all those Things,
how paid that twelve-moneths Rent.
Which on thy Grandsir came to pass,
so careless yet for all:
As if a Feigned story but,
his miserable fall.
11
O King even Thou, Nebuch: Signifies, a Grandfather, and a Father both.
the most high God,
unto Thy Grandsir bold:
Caldean Land a Nation fell,
gave them to have and hold.
The Royal Septer and the Crown,
advanced whom he would have:
And whom he would, he pulled down
could put to death and save.
12
But raised himself above the Stars,
Names Not his god at all:
Pride thus forgetfulness begets;
Full Tides Lo have their FALL.
Excellent Majesty how soon,
departed 'twas and gone?
As much to say, but Bruitesh where
The End is unthought On.
13
Now whilst The Earth bedewed with tears,
he Eats the heye which grows:
Bewayld of all dejected Soul,
Not knows his friends from foes.
The Earth, who late made seem to dance,
with Songs of Triumph Loud:
Then flees every wight as fast,
among the Beasts does Crowde.
14
Nails His overgrown from head to feet
and Hair like horns that stares:
His Scarf turned to a chain of Brass,
His lodgeing as he fares.
Of Devils Legions lead by them,
a Monarch made a Slave:
Till served out his seven times,
for rest in vain to crave.
15
VValking in pride, deposed at length,
driven from sonns of men:
Frighted was at the twelve-moneths End,
taken in his vaunting then.
No feigned Metamorphos'd one,
as Memory knowing well:
After that feast, how soon expelled,
the wild ASS with did dwell.
16
To school sent to the OX to learn,
that owner knows of his:
Fowls also their appointed time,
more senseless sure he is.
That Is mindlesse of the time to Come,
and beating needs more:
Wilfulness brother of the fool,
then bend, will break before.
17
Woods all for woe, as well as Men
ring out, and Echos call:
For mercy on this savage King,
in Holy Temples all.
Who gave by Stare-light for device,
A Heart in silver field:
An Eagle mounted on the Crest,
graven upon His Shield.
18
Both deposed thus; Thou know well:
Belchazer O his Son,
And of deliverance renownd so;
how to his glory turned.
A day a Trumpet made to sound,
To generations all:
Heavens hand solemnizd with a feast,
that No Time might recall.
19
The memory of such an Act,
yet as it had not been;
Who are Thy favorites more this day;
or Matched to thy Kinn?
Then those adoreing Wood and Stone,
for Statutes most divine:
Meditate Carved statues on,
in faction do Combine.
20
With Enemies of God most high,
to thrust Him from his Throne:
And thus have lifted up thy self;
so facile and so prone.
Against the Lord of heaven thy King,
not humbling of thy heart:
But stiffned have with Pride thy neck,
unto thy future smarte.
21
Besides polluting holy Things,
with Sabaths so divine:
Jdolatry and Revels in,
That Day and Night made thine:
But he in whose hand thy Life is,
thy Breath, and thy Ways all:
Have Thou not glorified Him,
has sent This on the Wall.
22
Thy Kingdom GOD has finished,
by Proclamation here;
How light soever made thereof,
He that sees far and near.
Has in the Balance weighed Thee,
and as Thy weightlesse gold;
Lo thou his Image wanting: found
more light then can be told.
23
Divided Thy kingdom here given,
unto the Medesis;
At hand no doubt The Hand it shows,
Darius partly His.
Standing divided like Thy mind,
so Mean Mean then:
Bids Thee beware the Judgment day,
at Hand, Amen, Amen.
24
His fathers Son wild over-growne,
as Daniel reproved his Sin:
Who might by no means moved be,
glory to render Him.
Ignorance with; not to be Cloak'd,
but Pride and Malice high:
So have not Thou Sir, done just so,
And finding it no Lie.
25
Of Mean Mean to Thee sent,
Even twice fullfil'd to be:
The Hand pointing at Twenty-five,
Heavenly Palmistry.
Which Year reveald GODS Dreadful day,
whose Hand-mayd for a Sign:
Our Troubles foretold as come to pass,
how never such a Time.
26
Then is not He Belchazer right,
when all, and more then all;
Which could be thought, though fulfilled since,
Mindlesse on GOD to Call.
The Faithless Steward rather then,
Michael who is like GOD: Dan. 12.

Become like one of us This Man,
shall cause Him Kiss the RODD.
27
When Death for one as it is no less,
by Statute Law of Late:
To have two Wifes at once, yet thine
own Case or present State.
What is it but to say the Truth?
the Beam does not Epsy;
Rather to be plucked out Then,
a Mote in others Eye.
28
Which Hand as here betokn's a Blow,
The Balance who knows not:
Cruelty and Injustice show,
SIR AMEND You know what.
And so go Little Book to be,
Sung as a pleasant Song:
The Times at hand, another Note
Great Britain sings ere Long.
29
Drunkards also, Here Is to You,
beware the Trumpets Call:
For from Pride yours, and surfeiting,
proceeds our Troubles all.
Praying down with your Twelse-tyde-Shews,
Stage Plays and Foolery then,
Lest in a Moment changed as He,
Turned into Devils from MEN.
30
So Cruelty and Pride farewell,
That great Assyrians fall:
who meant at once to put to Death,
his wise Men even All.
Neither regards His GOD nor Man,
driven out as those that Braye:
The DIADEM as well fitts Thee,
GO ASS, as much to say.
DANIEL: J End ALL.
