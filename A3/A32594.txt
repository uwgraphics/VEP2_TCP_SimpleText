By the King.
A PROCLAMATION, Forbidding His Majesty's Subjects to give Assistance to any
the Subjects of the King of Spain now in Rebellion against him.
CHARLES R.

WHereas Complaint has been made unto Us by Don Pedro Ronquillos, Envoy
Extraordinary from his Catholic Majesty the King of Spain, That several
Merchants and others Our Subjects, have carried Provisions, and given
Assistance and Succor to those of Messina in the Kingdom of Scicily, now in
Rebellion against his said Catholic Majesty, contrary to the Treaty made in
1667, between Us and the said King; We being desirous to give all just
Satisfaction to Our good Brother the King of Spain, and to maintain inviolably
the Articles contained in the said Treaty, do by this Our Royal Proclamation
expressly Enjoin and Command all Our Subjects of what Condition soever, That
they forbear giving any manner of Assistance, Countenance or Succor to those
of Messina, or any other of his Catholic Majesty's Subjects in Rebellion
against him, upon pain not only of Our high Displeasure, but suffering such
Punishment as by Law may be inflicted on such as wilfully violate our Treaties,
and infringe the Peace betwixt the two Crowns.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Seventeenth day of June 1675, In the Seven
and twentieth Year of Our Reign.
God save the King.
