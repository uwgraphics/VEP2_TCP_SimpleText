A PROCLAMATION For prohibiting the Importation or Retailing of any Commodities
of the Growth or Manufacture of the States of the United Provinces.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most excellent Majesty having duly considered and weighed the
present state of Affairs between Him and the States of the United Provinces,
and finding the differences on their parts daily multiplied and heightened; and
particularly, that they have prohibited the Importing and Vending of any Goods
or Wares made in this Kingdom, or any His Majesty's Dominions, into any their
Provinces or Dominions, upon great Penalties; His Majesty has therefore
thought fit, and by and with the Advice of His Privy Council, does hereby
Publish and Declare, and also straightly Charge and Command, That no Goods,
Merchandises or Commodities whatsoever of the Growth or Manufacture of the
Dominions of the said States of the United Provinces, or of any of their
Plantations or Factories wheresoever, shall at any time or times hereafter be
brought or imported into any of His Majesty's Realms or Dominions, or any Port
or Creek of the same, or if hereafter imported, shall not be there retailed,
uttered, bartered or sold by any person or persons whatsoever, upon pain of
Confiscation and Forfeiture thereof to His Majesty's use: Of which Confiscation
and Forfeitures His Majesty is pleased the Informer shall have one Moiety. And
hereof His Majesty's pleasure is, That all his loving Subjects, and all others
whom it may concern, do take notice at their peril: And to that end does hereby
straightly Charge and Command, as well all and every the Officers of the
Admiralty, as also all and singular Farmors, Customers, Comptrollers,
Searchers, Waiters and other Officers, in all Ports, Havens, Creeks and other
places, that they and every of them respectively take special care to see this
his Royal Pleasure and Command put in due execution at their perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Fifteenth day of March, 1664/5. in the
Seventeenth year of Our Reign.
