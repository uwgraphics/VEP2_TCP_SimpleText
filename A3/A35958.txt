EDINBVRGH, Printed by Andro Anderson, ANNO DOM. 1655.

TO THE READER.
SInce CHRIST'S fair Truth craves no man's art,
Take this rude Song in better part.
TRUE CHRISTIAN LOVE.
I Have a heart for love, and love
I cannot choose but have,
A love that can give full content,
the least as I can crave.
I want not, Psalm. 4. 6, 7* 1 John 2. 15, 16, 17.
suitors, and they all
have agents still with me,
Who promise that which I do seek,
but sure I know they lie.
Though honor height to lift me up,
and mammon me to serve:
Yet their attendants skars me not, 1 Timothy 6. ^

nor makes my heart to swerve.
Pale fear, duske envy, care and toil,
with other ill hewed wights
Wait for my service if I weed,
their masters, O what sights.
The only thing like to prevail,
was match unto my mind:
When fancy buskde my party with, Eccles. 1. 2.

perfections of each kind.
But now I see that fancy is,
not real as it seems:
No earthly love can give content,
all loves but Christ's are dreams.
Then why want I contenting love,
since Christ's love may be had:
In whom is all that I do seek,
or can be thought or said?
What other loves do seem to have,
is truly in him found;
The scattered beauties of them all
in him are jointly bound. Can. 5. 10.

What they do lack and cannot have*
because they finit be,
Its infinite, in him it stands
for ever still: O He,
He, he is only worthy love,
and nothing else but he,
Alas, that vanity so long
has so bewitched me.
Why heard I flattering idols words?
why did I parley keep:
Why suffered I affection
to sing me so asleep?
How went I on so foolishly, Psa. 77. 22.

and keept so often their tryst,
As if false loves could be found true,
and had no mind of Christ.
No, not when Christ was suiting me,
and they found often untrue:
I stack still in their bonds and could
my self no ways rescue.
Yet good and wise Lord Jesus Christ, Psa. 73. ^.

did still pursue my love:
He knew though I refused, my heart
was his; he could me move.
And now its done, my love is thine,
Lord Jesus home receive Cant. 1. ^

This whorish heart, and suffer not
my soul hence to deceive.
There shall my suitors all me serve,
but thou my love shall be,
They shall be mine, not I theirs, else
they shall not follow me.
Thus shall I have advantage twice,
and blessed shall be my lot,
I Will get my lovers goods, and love
above theirs, well I wot.
A love that will not me despise, Cant. 8. 1

though I unworthy be,
Though vile and loathsome, Ezekiel. 16 5, 6.
yet will he
not loath but pity me.
Though fickle I, (...) ^. 6
he will not change,
his constancy is known;
Of change no shadow is with him, Iam. 1. 17
he loves for ay his own:
When I for want of wit, John 13. 4
and strength
offend and do confess:
He will not chide but pardon me, Psalm. 10; 8, 9.

my faults both more and less.
He will not charge upon me lay, 1 Cor. 10 19.

more nor I may well bear,
But will my burdens as I need,
support, I do not fear.
No wrath at others will cause him
unpleasant be to me: Hab. 3. ^.

No flanderer will get his ear,
to hear of me a lie.
He will not misconstruct my words, Isa. 27. 4

he will not angry be:
Nor fret without a cause, Psalm. 103. 3
nor frown,
nor fitch a fault falsely.
Nor mark my ways so narrowly, ^ Pet. 4. 8

as nothing to pass by:
His love will hide my sin in love,
faith safely may rely.
He will not waste his heritage,
nor will himself disgrace,
No foes can hurt him, Psa. 89. 22
and their spyt,
he turns upon their face.
His love to other Saints shall not, John 13. 1

work prejudice to me,
More then the Suns light unto all,
does hinder me to see.
No causeless jealousy will vex
at any time his mind,
But if he see my heart go wrong, Isai. 30. 21

I know he is so kind, Rev. 2. 19.

As to admonish and rebuke,
and chasten if it need,
And so me save from perishing,
too often deserved indeed.
If I be sad, he will be loath,
yet more to vex my heart,
If any other will do so,
against them he will take my part:
And those that grieve me he will grieve,
and curse them more and less,
That curses me, Genesis 12. 3
so will he those that bless me surely bless. Number. 24. 9.

If trouble set about me round, Job 5. 29

he will not me forsake.
Nor leave me comfortless alone, Psa. 61. 15
but pity on me take.
And if he hide his face a while, Pet. 1. 9 7.

as wisdom often requires: James 1. 2 3, 12

He does but exercise my faith,
and sharpen my desires.
And if he seem to stay well long,
that I become so dead,
As I can neither say nor sing,
nor meditate, nor read,
Nor do ought else that might asswadge
hearts pangs in such a case,
But sit and droup and hang my head,
long looking for his grace.
Uttering but broken words or none,
perplexed with thoughts confusde,
Suggestions whisper all the while,
as if I were refusde,
Yet still his gracious hand does me
support, Joh. 5. 14
with secret strength:
And makes me in these deeps not drown, Isa. 13. 2

but brings me through at length.
Mean time he keeps my scattered words, Psa. 56. 8

and failing those my tears:
In books and bottels, and takes course,
to rid me out of fears.
And failing both my words and tears,
he makes each woeful groan:
And failing those, my sighs, and all
the parcels of my moan.
Yea; Psalm. 120. 2
when I fit astonished,
my lifted hands and looks:
Speaks all my mind to him, as if
it written were in books.
For he does search the heart and knows,
what is the spirits mind:
And as its fit, gives answer to
needs cry, in every kind.
And look how sharp these trials are,
their fruit is far more sweet:
His countenance compenseth all, Rom 8. 27

with one blink when we meet. Psalm. 20. 5

For he does make my heart more glad, Psalm 4. 7

then any tongue can tell: Psalm. 34. all

Though grief was great, Psalm. 76 to 10 verse
yet joy is now,
more sweet nor grief was fell.
For judge ye whosoever felt,
what weight in sin, what grief,
In mind oppressed what angnish is;
when soul sees no relief,
What torment in perplexity,
what horror in Gods wrath,
What hell in feared eternity,
at loosing of his breath?
And presuppon a soul were sure
to dwell at last above,
In heaven with Christ, yet know ye not,
what langour is in love?
What sickness in deferred-hopes? Prove. 13 12

what battle with our so:
What trouble when God hides his face, Psa. 22. 14

and seems us to forgo?
Now judge again, Psalm. 116. 3* 14. and 7, 8
when weights are lift
grief, anguish, torments gone.
For wrath, death, hell, eternity,
of fear now there is none.
But in their place the heart lift up;
life, light, and rest, is come
Felt love, peace, victory, hearts health,
and Christ's Sprit, all in sum.
Judge when our much prokocked Lord,
himself shows reconcilde,
If with the joy that then is felt,
a heart may not be filde.
Now what can others love do here, Joh. 15. 13

to soul in such a case
But add more grief, and make the veil
more thick to hide Christ's face.
Then others loves all get you gone,
or else take servants place:
Too hard conditions were to me,
for you to quite his face,
For one hours joy in him is more, Psa. 84. 10

though mixed with drierie tears,
Then all earths honor, pleasure, wealth
can yield in many years.
Now let me rest and ruse my love, Psalm 116 7.

who first me loved, and chusde,
And long called for my wortalesse love, Gal. 2 20

and would not be refusd.
I Will seek his love, as he sought mine,
and learn of him to love,
Since he invites I cannot miss,
though whiles he shall me prove.
My love's his Fathers eldest son, John 2 18.

his Father, King of Kings:
His heritage is Heaven and earth
and in them both all things. Dan. 2 47

His wisdom laid the worlds round, Psalm 2. 8.

and parted Sea and Land, Heb. 1. 2

Earths body through, Prove. 8. 22, etc.
as vines he drew
the waters with his hand.
He made the Sun and Stars so swift,
yet not be seen to move,
Least men on earth had vexed been
with motions from above.
His strength upholds this weighty globe
and yet which is far more,
He bare our sins and heavy wrath,
deserved of us therefore:
For truth Gods promises in him, 2 Cor 1. 20.

are all, Yea, and Amen:
For love, Romans 5. 8
his death for us a proof,
sufficient has been.
For justice he can do no wrong,
for mercy there is none
Or shall in hell be, who have sought
for grace through him alone.
Most lofty and most lowly mind, Deuteronomy. 32 4

most good and most severe, Isa. 57. 15

Most lovely, and most terrible.
do all in him cohere.
The meekest lamb to all his friends, Mat. (...). 29.

a Lion to his foes,
He gives his peace to all that comes,
wrath follows all that goes.
No foe can stand before his face, Mal. 3. 2
no fugitive can flee,
No lurking hole can hide from him, Psalm 139 7, 8, 9, 10 11, 12

his eyes do all things see.
Almighty, Rev. 4. 7
all where present, though,
his body heaven contain, Mat. 28. 20

Eternal God, though he as man,
man's properties retain.
No robry for his majesty Phil. 2. 6
his fathers match to be,
The fathers godhead and the Spirits, 1 Ioh. 5. 7

and his are one all three,
Therefore when I do love the Son,
I love the father too:
And so the Spirit who dwell in him,
to all I worship do.
He is the tree of Life to me, Genesis 3 22

and so to all his own,
No fiery sword debars us now, ^^^d. 24

all we for friends are known: John 5. 14* 15

In him my Sabbath is begun,
he teaches me to cease Genesis 2 2. 3

From mine own works, Heb. 4. 10.
and leads me to
his rest by steps, of peace.
Flood branchd in four to water all
new plants of paradise, Genesis 2. 10

Redeemde, and holy, making them,
and righteous and wise,
Though we have slain him, yet his blood
speaks better things for us,
Then Abels crying curse but his
cries, Genesis 4* 10
Lord be gracious.
Though wrath should overflow the land, Genesis 6. 14

as with a new deludge,
Or fire consume the earth, yet Christ's
safe Ark is for refuge,
For now no wrath unmixt with love,
shall of his own be felt,
Because God in his sacrifice,
the smell of rest has smelt.
And as the bow in clowd is pawn Genesis 8. 21

of not returning flood: Genesis 9. 31

So is that offering constant pledge
of our eternal good. Isai. 54. 9

True Isaac offered up to me,
not minted at but slain:
Most Isaac like in this escape,
though slain he rose again
Sweet Joseph by his brethren sold,
by our means made to serve:
He has provided well our food,
least we through want should sterve,
From Egypts bonds and slavery base,
its he that sets us free:
Its he that does prepare our way,
through floods and raging sea.
The Prophet raisde like Moses true, Heb. 3. 2, 3

but fruitfuller then he,
He law, John 11 17
and curse, and types of good,
Christ, grace and truth gives me.
My duty Moses shows but strength
none can he give to do, 2 Cor. 3. 6, etc. Heb. 7. 26 etc.

But Christ, by teaching gives me life,
and will, and action to.
The priest that offered only once;
and pacified for ay:
And needs not Aaron-like repeat
his sacrifice each day.
For Aarons offering often did prove
his offering unperfite,
But Christ's because it perfect makes, Heb. 10. 14

God still our sins to quite.
In him all leav's and types are filled. Heb. 7. 1^

in him they have an end,
No further use of them since God
did Christ their substance send,
No priest by office now on earth,
no proper sacrifice,
No alter of materials
no fixed place of service.
The tent where God dwells bodily,
the temple where the tryst,
Is set for meeting of our God,
as reconciled is Christ.
He arc with ready Angels eled. Heb. 9. 2 etc*

he mercy seat of God,
Access, and oracles of peace,
giving to us abroad.
By him the withered rod bears fruit, Number. 17. 8

with him is manna hid,
The Law in him lies closde from speech,
except through mercies lid.
By him my prayers are perfumed
and smell as insence sweet:
By him my cup is furnished,
and table filled with meat.
The Priest, the alter and the Lamb,
the laver washing all:
And what else any rite did sign,
he fills up great and small. Col. 1. 17

The judge which rids his people from
all adversaries hand.
Our kindly King by whom we may
possess that promised land.
To all his iubjects affable,
above all earthly Kings,
His basest servants have his ear,
at all times in all things.
He is the Churches dare love,
and therefore must be mine,
Though I be base, Isai. 57. 1
yet will his grace
to be my love incline.
Often has he proved his love to me,
and will not now decline,
Often has his love much sweeter been
to me then finest wine Cant. 1. 2

Often has the preaching of his word, Cant. 1. 2

in straits and fears of death,
As sweetest kisses been to me,
convoyed with lively breath.
Often has his Apples hunger stayde, Cant. 2. 5

my thirst his flaggons quenched,
Often has his shadow me refresht, Cant. 2. 3

as herbs by dew bedrench'd
Often in his love withdrawing, He
from bed has made me rise,
And seek him long before I fand, Cant. 5. ^
to make me after wise.
And when we met, his wrath was gone,
he called me spouse betroath'd,
And washing me by pardon, said
my fair love though self loathed: Cant. 1. 5

Now fairest love, Cant. 1. 16
let my soul say,
who made me clean but thou?
Who made a child of wrath like me
stand reconciled now. Hos. 2. 3

What makes me lovely, but thy love
that set the price on me:
Whose beauty makes me fair but thine
what have I not from thee:
My exaltation is come,
to be a child of God
By thy descending to be man,
and some whiles here abode:
Thy clean conception and birth, Luke 1. 35

proves thee to be the tree:
Where cut from Adams filthy stock
^impted clean must be.
Thy manger makes my bed more soft,
thy stable gives me innes:
Thy banishment home brings me where, Luke 2. 16

my countrey-people winnes.
Thy wisdom in thy childhood hides
my foolish youthly toys, Mat. 2. 13

Thy self devoting unto griefs
is ground of all my joys. Luke 2. 47

Thy emptying my fullness is,
thy meannesse me promots.
Thy hyding of thy royal state
a Kingdom me allots.
Thy servants shape and service done, Phil. 2. 7

from service sets me free*
And bondage of proud Satan's yoke,
and sins strong tyrranie.
Thy lurking thirty years unknown,
for ever makes me shine
With glory far above the reach
of subtilest ingine.
Thy name inrold in sinners book,
by baptism makes my name
To be inrolde among the Saints,
even those of greatest fame.
Thy offering suretiship for me
to God at Iordans bank,
Has fred me of my sins, and hell,
well's me and God I thank,
I hear thee say to God, Isai. 8. 18
Behold
me and my children all:
I hear the Father answer thee,
I love you great and small.
I hear thee say: Take me for them,
let me their burden bear: Isai. 55. 3

I hear the father cry, Content
come children, come and hear.
Come hear the Covenant between
me and my dearest Son,
Come give your hearts consent thereto,
and then your bargan's done.
I hear thee say, Man's due is death,
I Will do thy will, O Lord.
My soul and body both for theirs, Psalm. 4. 8

let suffer I accord.
I hear thy Fathers voice from Heaven
cry, lovely Son art thou
These all, and this, (and that was I)
are thine, I Am pleased now.
I hear him say to all, and me,
Go hear my Son and live:
He drew. I came thou welcomed me;
and life I feel do give?
Now take me with thee where thou will
for we must never shed. Psalm. 61. 2

In faith my soul is glew'd to thee,
lead me as blind are led.
Cross Satan's teeth, if our way ly*
and cross each other foe
To Priests, Mat. 27. 33
to beanch, to Golgotha,
lead me and I will go.
But lead; and leave me not, or else
I cannot miss to fall:
If thou do hold me in thy hand,
I fear no foe at all. Romans 8 31

Thy combats makes me not amazde,
for what could make me woe: Mat. 8. 31

Thy victory my conflict makes,
to be with vanquishde so.
Thy going to the wilderness
brings me to Saints city: Matthew. 4. 1

Thy fighting all alone makes me
fight in thy company:
Thy being tempted forty days, Matthew 4. 1

all my days makes me sure,
Thy presence, Heb. 2. 18
help and comfort shall
with tempted me endure.
If by some wrong mean I be tempt, Mat. 4. 3

to fill my natures lust,
Or God to tempt, Mat. 46
neglecting means,
under pretense of trust.
To help or hazard life, some way,
which God will not allow:
I see thee still before me, Lord,
my helper here be thou.
Its true my flesh does grieve to think,
what may thy Saints befall,
What horrible suggestions,
and blasphemies withal.
What shapes and apparitions,
by night some, some by day:
Yea power of this flesh, yet thou
So usde my fear do stay.
Most dangerous of all, me thinks,
when Satan God to scorn, Mat. 4. 8

In false religion worship craves, Mat. 4. 6

and hids both hoof and horn.
And Angel-like in some man's mouth,
bids to some Image bow,
And worldly motives brings thy truth
to cause me dis-avow.
In this case Lord give light, Mat. 4. 10
that I
may Satan bid avoid:
For thousands here for fault of light
guild have been and destroide.
To free me from this ill, I know
new trouble shall me breed:
And make the world me persecute
with spite, in word and deed.
But so I may thy truth contain,
and still adhere to thee:
I fear no persecution,
nor wickeds injury.
More hatred can I not, then thou,
no more despised be:
More chargde with bitter calumnies,
nor ofter get the lie.
More scornde and mocked in my face* Luke 23. 11

more followed at the back:
Finger and tongue shut forth withal, Psalm. 22. 7

murgeons that mockers make.
Less welcome where I offer love; John 1. 11

less thanked for good deeds:
Worse intertaind in my country,
worse furnished in my needs:
More friendly handled by my friends,
and those of mine own blood,
Then thou was, I, yea none can be
who suffer shall for good.
What can befall me which did not
before befall to thee?
What more distressed for righteousness,
can I expect to be?
What ludging less then ly thereout? Mat. 8. 20

what harder bed then rocks:
What sharper rest then not to sleep,
or to preveene the cocks,
What scant or want, Mat. 7. 27
more then to have
no penny in my purse.
Among such people as me hate,
and in their heart me curse.
What greater hunger then to fast,
and when its come to eat,
To send and buy some course piece bread
and get no other meat. John 4. 5

What greater drouth then want a drink,
in journey at midday?
And for a drink of water call, John 4* 5

and hear on say me nay?
What spoil of goods more then to strip
me naked to the skin,
And in my sight divide my clothes,
and then to scorn begin.
What danger more then present death, Mat. 2. 37

by stones lift up to cast.
There steep down rocks, John 8. ^^
here man adjudgd,
to be thrown down made fast. Luke 4. 20

What banished can I more be then
for life chasde here and there: Mat. 8. 2^

Without a hole to hide my head,
which even to beasts is rare?
What prison worse then fall in hands
of persecuting Priests, Mat. 26 5^

Thirsting like Wolves for blood of Saints
to grace their godless feasts?
What judgment more unjust then find
my party sit as judge, Mat. 26. 65

And still the less fault he can find,
the more at me to grudge?
And if I speak a modest truth
to smite me on the face: Joh. 18. 22

And pull the hair off head and cheeks, Isa. 50. 6

and all me to disgrace.
What torment more then pricks thurst in
on's head fourscore at once? Mat 27. 29

Yea all the flesh with scourging rent,
and nothing safe but bones.
And those so racked in all joints,
as sinews none go free.
But legs and arms asunder spelde, Mat ^7. 25

hung up and naild on tree.
And what might seem to be untouchde,
thy tender bowels all.
So burnt as slockning welcome was,
by vinegar and gall.
All this thou suffered, Lord, and more
then any can express. Mat. 27. 4

Why should I then be feared for such
like suffering more, or less.
Thou came to witness for the truth,
and so must all thine do:
Thou came to suffer for the truth,
and so must all thine too.
None follow thee, except they be
content thy cross to bear: Mat. 16. 24

None crownde shall be, 1 Timothy 2. 12
except they will
for truth thy livery wear.
The truth is limit to thy word,
thine and none others saw;
Thy scriptures meaning thou will have
my rule and thy full law. Ioh. 5. 39

O that I were inclinde to do
what duties there are namde!
Then when I suffer should for truth
I could not be ashamde: 1 Pet. 4. 16

And suffer must we, Mat. 15. 19
else do wrong,
when men from age to age,
To chop and change thine ordinance
run headlong in a rage,
And by their own traditions
do make thy precepts void,
Urging their own will more then thine, Psalm 119 116

so lies thy Law destroide.
But thou Lord, over all declares
such worship to be vain: Mat. 15. 9

And ere we yield, thy jealousy
wills rather we be slain.
Yea ere we do a needless work
and weaken little ones,
We choose our urgers should us sink
in deep seas with milstones. Mat. 18. 6

Then strengthen, Lord, my faith in thee,
that flesh I do not fear. Psalm. 56. ^

But fear may only thine offense,
whose love be bought so dear,
And since thou have me bought so dear, John 13. 1

why may I not be sure:
That love which made thee pay my price
shall steadfastly endure?
If I should lean to my free will
or strength, I could not stand,
Often had I perished, if my life
had line in mine own hand.
I wonder not that such as lean
to their works, will or strength,
Fit, others for, and make themself
apostasy at length.
For such do not deny themselves, Mat. 16. 24
and so not follow thee,
I chasde am to thee for refuge, Heb. 6. 18
and so preservde must be.
Chasde souls are sensible of sin,
and sensible of wrath.
And flee from both to thee for life,
and in thee draw their breath.
How then can such not persevere,
and so be saved at length,
Whom thou do empty of their own, John 6. 37

and fills with thy fresh strength.
These are the souls that come to thee.
whom thou will not cast out:
These souls are drawn and driven to thee,
whom thou must save no doubt
These are thy sheep for whom thou prays
for whose life thou did die John 17. 9

Whom liars shall not long deceive, Ioh. 10. 28

whom non can pull from thee.
These did thy Father give to thee, Ioh. 6. 39

with this express command,
Son? see thou loss not one of those,
I Will crave them at thine hand.
Keep them and make them persevere, Ioh. 6. 39

and lead them all the way,
Through life and death, and raise them up
to glory at that day
Thou do accept this charge and pawns,
thy honor charge to keep.
Our faithful Sheepherd well I know Psalm. 111 4.

not slumber will nor sleep. Heb. 9

These sin and Law chasde souls thou counts
true Isaaks all to be: Romans 8. 9

Children of promise styling them, Romans 8. 17
and heirs annexed with thee. Tit. 1, 1

These are Gods Elect, Romans 8. 9
whom he has
predestinat of old,
And in his council has decreed
to save as he has told.
Whom to assure of endless life
by his unchanged decree, Heb. 6. 18

His truth and oath he laid in pawn, Heb. 6. 13

in which he cannot ly,
And swore by his eternal self,
for greater there was none:
That of this elect company
there should not perish one:
And though these souls like ship on sea
may fearfully be tossed. Isa. 54. 1^

And whiles may seem close overwhelmed
yet none such shall be lost. Heb. 6. 19

Their anchor lies within the veil,
no wind can make it drive:
It lies where thou art landed Lord,
and where we shall arrive.
Now who so says that thy elect Romans 8. 28

for all this perish may
And that thy Saints of purpose called
from thee may fall away.
And looses us from leaning on
the strength of thy right hand:
They draw from building on the rock, Mat. 7. 24

and bids us build on sand,
They say Peter and Judas are
alike beloved of thee,
And that they both for gifts received,
alike beholden be:
As Judas for his perishing, Mat. 26. 15

may wit the love of pelf:
So Peter his free will for life
may praise and thank himself.
They say thou know not who are thine*
of none they make thee sure:
They say the Lords foundation
does not ay firm endure: 2 Timothy 2. 10

They say thou chooses some to day, Heb. 6. 1, 17 18

and casts them off the morn:
They make thee like vain man to be, John 17 9

and do thy counsel scorn.
They make thee pray for thine Elect, Romans 8 34

and not get thy request: Heb. 7 25

Yea though thou for them live for ay,
to interceed as Priest. Romans 8. 16

Gods Elect whom to he gives right,
to be his sons and heirs,
They make them want sure right to have, Ioh. 10. 28

the heritage for theirs.
That Saints till death seduced may be,
and sheep pulled from thine hand,
Whom God thee chargd to keep and save
to say, Heb. 6. 18
they do not stand.
Thy word, thy oath, thy covenant
they make no certainty:
Faiths anchor they make drive, they speak
in iubstance blasphemy.
They make the merchand nothing wise,
and very short of thought*
Who paid the price, Ioh. 10. 11
and was not sure
to have what thou had bought:
Yea, so unwise, as for thy sheep
thine own life not to spare,
Whom thou may loss, though so dear bought
such foolish blocks are rare. Ioh. 13. ^

O wicked thoughts be far from me, Rom, 8. 28

I know thy love does last:
And whom of purpose thou do call
Thy grace does hold them fast. (...) 5. 8

Whom thou do love for them thou died,
for whom thou died they live:
Thy love, thy ransoning, and heaven,
all jointly thou do give.
And whosoever hates his sin, 1 Ioh. 4. 19
and sets his love on thee,
May be assured thou lovd'st him first,
and for his life did die,
Now, Lord, thou knows I hate my sin,
and seeks to have it slain*
Thou that knows all, Ioh. 21. 17
knows I thee love,
and feels it not in vain.
Then Lord my love thou will allow, Gal. 2. 20

that I apply thy death.
And by that means persuaded rest, Psalm. 116. 17

to be exeemd from wrath,
And well I wot the ransom is
sufficient eneugh
Me to redeem from hell, and imp
me in thee as thy bough.
For me thou emptied thy self, Romans 4. 5
and stood in Fathers aw:
For me thou emptied thy self, Phil. 2. 7
and fulfilled the law.
For me thou took on thee the curse, Gal. 3. 14

and felt thy Fathers wrath:
For me often plunged was thy soul, Mat. 26. 38

and heavy to the death,
For which I sinfully did laugh,
thou mournd and wept full sore:
For pleasure taken in my sin
through grief often did thou roar.
For mine ill words thou silencd was,
and knew not what to say:
For mine ill deeds thou Lord was bound, Mat. 27

condemned and led away.
Thy ditty were each one my wrongs
against both God and man:
Thy sentence was my due desert
for sins whereto I ran. Isai. 53. 9

These lashes laid upon thy skin,
those stripes and all thy wounds
Were for my souls wounds made with sin* John (...). 27

O love which thus abounds!
O thus my love to see thee sad,
O thus to see thee weep:
O thus to hear thee groan and pant, Mat. 2^ 3, 8

and cry with sighs cut deep.
O agony! O fearful sweat!
O tears! O bloody drops!
How mingled down from cheeks to feet
each chasing other hops. Luk 2^. 24

To see my love for love of me
on bloody shoulders bear Mat. 27

That cross, that curse, that growing wrath
and trembling thus for fear.
To see almighty God so weak,
life's fountain thus to die:
With shame and pain ov'rchargd, Mat. 26. 45
till heaven
wondered and all for me.
Woes me for all my sins! woes me,
for roots of sin so strong:
Which have so long time grown in me,
and like to stick so long:
Oh help my Love* Romans 7. 4
to have them slain:
Oh here revenge thy death!
Oh on this ill avenge me too,
which wronged us both so has:
Well's me, I wot thou will anon
grant this, Ioh. 16. 23
and each request:
Anon our joy perfect shall be, Romans 5. 25

anon our marriage feast.
For as thou died for me, for me
so also did thou rise:
And reigns as God, and shall me fetch,
so makes thy Word me wise.
Fond lovers! (...) 4.
Tell me now if you
have any love like this?
Come take a share with me, (...) 5. 10
my Love
wholly spiritual is.
Come change your loves* (...)ant. 5 16
and love with me
or else you perish shall:
Go charge your loves to do the same, Cor. 16

or perish shall you all:
Gods curse on him that loves not
my Love Lord Jesus Christ: (...) 24

Or loves not them that do love him,
this curse with death keeps tryst*
(...) this is my Love, Acts 2. ^4
yet if
(...) could like your love die,
All these excellencies of his
should work my misery. Rev. 1. 18

Or yet if I by death could be
deprived of this my Love: ^ Cor. 5. 1

All that is said or can be more
were naught to my behove.
But now my Love shall never die,
his days shall never end;
His life shall eternize his Love, Rev. 1. 1^

his life to love does tend. Heb. 1. 1^

And I by death shall have no loss,
my love shall then be more,
Both mine to him, 1 Cor. 13. 1^
and his to me,
Blessed be God therefore.
Yea, and because I cannot live,
and broke his love beneath,
My chariot to eternal life
death he appointed has.
Therefore till death his love shall be
the best part of my life: 2 Kin. ^. 1^

In him I Will strive against baser loves,
and death will end the strive.
Only, my Lord, still pity me,
and tarry not too long:
My sprite and flesh cry, Rev. 22. 2^
Come Lord, come
death shall renew my song.
FINIS.
