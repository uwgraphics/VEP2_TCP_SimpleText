Instructions for the RECORDER.
THIS Delightful Companion, the Pipe Recorder, has been for a long time out of
use; but now it is beginning to be in a greater Repute than ever it was before:
And indeed there is no Music so near a natural Voice, it admits of excellent
Harmony in Consort of two and three Parts. I have therefore with the Assistance
of several able Masters set down these plain and easy Instructions for
Beginners.

The first thing that a Practitioner is to observe, is the true manner of
holding the Pipe, and placing his Fingers exactly on the holes; for the
perfecting of which, observe these Rules following:

First, hold your Pipe with your left hand uppermost next your Mouth, then
observe there is eight holes upon the Pipe, viz. seven before and one
underneath, which we call the uppermost, and is to be stopped with your Thumb,
the next with your fore finger, the third with your second finger, the fourth
with your third finger, next stop the next or fifth hole with the fore finger of
your right hand, your second finger of the same hand stop on the sixth hole,
then stop the seventh hole with your third finger, the last or lowest hole stop
with your little finger; having thus placed your fingers, be sure to stop them
all close, then begin to blow with a gentle breath, which will sound the first
Note or Stop which is called F-fa-ut, next take off your little finger, keeping
all the rest close, then you will sound or stop G-sol-re-ut, and so you are to
proceed in all the Notes ascending, which are pricked upon five lines, and named
and placed according to the proper places in Space and on Rule according to the
Scale or Gamut, the several Stops are placed under them by Dots on seven Lines,
the seven Dots do express all to be stopped by your fingers as is
aforementioned; where you see no Dots are placed, there the holes are open, as
you may plainly see and learn by this following Table.

The first Table of ye Plain Notes Assending.

A la mj re B fa mj C sol fa D la sol Left Hand Thumb First Finger Second Finger
Third Finger Right Hand First Finger Second Finger Third Finger Fourth Finger

Secondly, In this Table observe, That the lower seven Lines represent the
several holes, and the Dots upon those lines what holes are to be stopped.

The little finger or eighth hole has no peculiar line, but is placed below
the other seven lines, and is expressed by this Signature or Circumflex marked
thus; next observe, that for G-sol-re-ut, above which we call in Alt, you are
to keep on your second finger on the third hole (as you find underneath it a
Dot on the third line) and not to blow the Pipe open as on the Flagelet, for so
the Pipe will be out of Tune.

Next you are to observe, That the seven Lines and Dots are not intended for a
method or constant Rule to play by, for it is not a commendable way, neither do
I advise any to use it any other ways than to attain to the right knowledge of
the Stops for every Note, that so you may the readier know them when you come
to play any Tunes pricked in the right Musical way upon five Lines, as all the
following Tunes are.

table of fingerings on the recorder A Scale of all the Notes gradually
Assending both Flatt and Sharp.


This Table directs, and is a Guide, to know all the Stops upon the Recorder or
Flute, both Flat and Sharp, or the half Notes ascending and descending,
according to the Scale of Music.

table of fingerings on the recorder A Table of ye Several Notes which require
Shakes or Back falls


Of these Graces, a Beat is marked thus ^, a Shake is marked thus ^ A Beat is
fetched from the half Note below the Note it stands over; and a Shake is fetched
from, or shaked in the proper Note above it; a Slur is thus marked ^, when it
is over or under two Notes tied together, and is a sliding from one Note or
more to another in the drawing of one breath. In all the Airs or Tunes in this
Book, you will meet with these Graces set over the several Notes that are to be
so Graced.

The last and most chiefly to be understood is the Notes, their Names and
Proportions of Time, which are here set in the plainest method I could invent,
beginning with the Semibreve, which is accounted a whole Measure.

The Names of the Notes.
Semibreve. * * Minim. * * Crotchet. * * Quaver. * * Semiquaver. * *
These two last are often for convenience tied together, sometimes 4 or 6.

The Rests or Pauses for each Note is thus marked.
Semibreve. * * Minim. * * Crotchet. * * Quaver. * * Semiquaver. * *


A Semibreve is the longest Note (being a full Time) for which you must keep
your Breath on the Pipe so long as you can leisurely in imagination tell four,
which are to be Crotchets, for in the Common Time all Notes are reckoned double
in proportion to the Semibreve, as two Minims, four Crotchets, eight Quaver,
sixteen Semiquavers, as this first Example directs, which is marked with this
Character * or Mood, which is set at the beginning of all Lessons.

Common Time.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Tripla Time by 3
Minims.
*^ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Tripla Time by 3 Crotchets.
*^ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

The second and third Examples direct the Tripla Time, which is numbered by 3,
and this Character *3 or Mood is placed at the beginning of all Lessons: In
these two Proportions of Time you often meet with Pricks added to the Notes,
which Pricks are half the measure and proportion of the Notes to which they are
added.

Example. ^

Thus I have in the most plain and easiest manner I could, set down the
Examples of all Notes and Proportions of Time; such as desire to see the same
more at large, I refer them to Mr. John Playford's Introduction to Music.

To conclude; By these Rules and Directions, with a little help of some able
Master to explain the true meaning and use thereof, you may in a short time
become good Proficients on this Instrument. Thus hoping that these my
Endeavors will be kindly accepted, it will be an Encouragement for me to
present you with a Second Part of this nature in a few Months.

Your Servant, ROBERT CARR.
