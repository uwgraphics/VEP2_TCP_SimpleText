former showing The Nature and Extent of the Inspiration vouchsaf't by the Holy
Ghost to the Penmen of the Scriptures, and the distinct share of each therein.

The latter showing the Divine Authority of the Vowels and Accents in the
Hebrew Text; by new and intrinsic Arguments: in a Discourse concerning the

THE PREFACE.
WHAT Assaults have bin made of late Years upon the Divine Authority of the
Holy Scriptures, is not unknown to those that think it their concern to attend
unto such matters. This was done more closely and covertly diverse Years ago by
F. Simon in his Critical History of the Old Testament: In reference to which,
that very Learned and Judicious Divine Mr. W. Lorimer, has translated and
published, A Vindication of the five Books of Moses, with an Appendix of his
own, in Answer to F. Simon's Exceptions. A more open Attack was made upon it by
the Author of the five Letters: These were first answered among us by Mr.
Louth, an ingenious Member of the famous University of Oxford. I was much
pleased with the Candor of a passage in his Preface: In the last place, says
he, I must desire of those, who think I have not carried the Inspiration of the
Scriptures so high as I ought, not to be angry with me, or uncharitably to
censure me, as if I designed to betray the Cause which I pretend to maintain;
but if they are not satisfied with my performance, to undertake the Argument
themselves, and do Justice to so good a Cause: I assure them, I shall heartily
wish 'em Success in their Undertaking, and shall be glad if my Arguments appear
weak, because their's are stronger: for I can do nothing against the Truth, but
for the Truth, p. 16. After him comes Mr. La Mothe, who takes notice of that
passage, and makes use of it as an Invitation to his Undertaking: and withal
adds, If my Example should excite some others -- to write upon the same
Subject, the Public will be obliged to me for it. In that Discourse of his, he
has fully and satisfactorily Vindicated the Divine Inspiration of the Books of
the New Testament: so that those Letters may be dismissed from any further
Consideration, being solidly and fully answered.

But as to what Mr. La Mothe offers concerning the Nature of that Inspiration,
I am not so well satisfied: It seemed to me very defective, which excited me to
seek after further satisfaction: Whereupon I perused all those Authors (within
the compass of my Curta supellex) wherein I might reasonably expect to have met
with something that might have quenched my Thirst, but returned with my Pitcher
empty: Thereupon I fell a plowing with my own Heifer, and that which follows is
the Crop which the Reader may reap, if he thinks it worth while to bestow so
much pains upon it. And this I intend only as Cumulative to what is delivered
by Mr. Louth, and La Mothe.

Besides this late debate, there has bin another Controversy of longer
standing, which has bin hotly canvast and contested pro and con between the
most learned Pens on both sides, which has a great influence upon the divine
Authority of the holy Scriptures also, viz. about the Original of the Vowels
and Accents in the Hebrew Text of the Old Testament. Much confidence (or,
according to modish word, Assurance) has bin showed on both sides. This point
was studied by me when I was in the University above fifty Years ago: And since
then I have bin looking into what I met with on that subject. Of late I have
bestowed some thoughts upon it upon this occasion. Being desired to draw up A
brief Concordance to be added to the third Edition of Mr. Pool's Annotations I
intended to Preface it, with an Account of the Division of the Bible into
Chapters and Verses, the foundation of all exact Concordances, and without
which they cannot but be very lame and defective. Thereupon making Enquiry into
the Original of the Chapters and Verses in the Old Testament, it naturally led
me into that weighty Controversy about the Authority of the Points in the
Hebrew Text, which occasioned it is growth into a larger bulk than was fit for a
Preface; whereupon I was feign to slip it off, and separate it from that Root,
and so it grew up into a distinct Discourse by it self; wherein the Reader will
meet with something not to be found else where (for I would not trouble the
World with old matters new vamp't up.)

When this Discourse was first conceived and brought forth; (which was some
Years ago) as they say the Eagle tries her young ones by exposing 'em to the
light of the Sun, so, being desirous that the Truth and Soundness of my Notion
might be thoroughly tried, I sent it to some learned Persons for their Opinion
about it. I found that they had a different apprehension of the Controversy
from mine, and made some slight Objections against my judgment of it: but none
of 'em did attempt any Answer to any of my Arguments, or endeavor in the least
to overthrow the foundation of my Building, viz. The Connection between the
Verses, Accents and Vowels; which confirmed me in my Opinion, that it is built
upon good Grounds, because the most learned Persons that have perused it, have
so little to object against it. The most considerable Objection made by a very
learned, judicious Divine was (not so much against my Opinion it self, as) that
it is not sufficiently proved that all the Hebrew Accents are, and must be
coetaneous with the Verses and Language. I grant that my Argument does not
directly prove that All the Accents are Coevous with the Vowels, but only
Athnach and Silluk: But then if it be considered, that they all have a
dependence one upon another, i. e. the Duces and Subditi, or Ministri, upon the
Reges; then the proving of some of 'em to be coetaneous with the Vowels and
Verses, bids fair for the proof of 'em all.

The Usefulness of the Accents, and their intimate connection with, and
dependence one upon another, is very fully showed of late by Mr. Walter Cross
in his Taghmical Art (as he calls it; though I should think, according to the
Rules and Analogy of Grammar, it should rather be called, the Tangnamical Art,
(as from Talmud, Talmudical:) for the Noun Substantive, is (...) tangnam, an
Accent,) which very well deserves the diligent Study of all those that desire
to be exact in the Hebrew Tongue, and consequently in the understanding of the
Scriptures of the Old Testament: only one great Disaster has befallen it,
(which probably might come to pass by his Illness, or Death) that it is very
false Printed.

It has bin suggested to me by some learned Men that have seen those Papers,
That being fit only for the View of the Learned, (and, alas! not for all of
them neither) it should have bin dressed up and sent abroad in a learned Habit;
but falling only accidentally upon that Question, I spun out my thoughts upon
it by degrees, after the same rate that I had begun it, till I had finished my
Web, and don't think it now worth while to put it into a new dress, but even
let it go as it is, and approve it self to the Candid Reader as well as it can.

The Third Discourse treats of a nice and curious Point (The Testimony of the
Spirit,) which is not so much a matter of Speculation as Experience: Concerning
which I know nothing that has bin published of late about it, distinctly by it
self; and therefore perhaps it may find the better Acceptance with the Reader,
especially if he be one that has his Senses exercised about such things.

An Exercitation, Disquisition, or Enquiry into the Nature and Extent of the
Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures.
. 1. THE Works of God in general, are very unsearchable by any humane
Understanding. Great things does he which we cannot comprehend, says Elihu,
Job 37. -- 5, nor find out, v. 23. So that, No man can know the work that God
does from the beginning to the end; as Solomon assures us, Eccles. 3. -- 11.
Particularly,

Concerning the Works of Providence, the Psalmist pronounces of 'em, that they
are a great deep, Psalm. 36.6. and again, 77.19. Thy way is in the sea, and thy
path in great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. This moved Zophar to put
the question to Job, c. 11. 7, 8. Can thou by searching find out God? Can
thou find out the Almighty to perfection? It is high as heaven, What can thou
do? deeper than hell, what can thou know? The consideration whereof drew that
Exclamation, or Admiration from the great Apostle, (...)! O the depth of the
riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his
judgments! and his ways past finding out, Romans 11.36.

. 2. But especially the Work of the Spirit in and upon the Souls of Men, is
very mysterious, and incomprehensible, as to the finer strokes of it. Our
Savior Christ compares it to the Wind, Joh. 3.8. The Wind blows where it
lists, and thou hear the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it
comes, and whither it goes. So is every one that is born of the Spirit. As the
Effects of the Wind are sensible and discernible enough, but the Manner is
unaccountable; so the effects of the Work of the Spirit are evident enough, but
the Manner is very mysterious and incomprehensible.

. 3. This may be applied (among other things) to the Inspiration of the Spirit
in the holy Men of God, the Penmen of Scripture. That it is so, that they were
Divinely inspired, we have demonstrative proof and evidence sufficient; but the
Manner of it is not obvious, nor easily understood; yet it is sought out of all
them that have pleasure therein; as the Psalmist speaks, c. 111. 2. This
therefore I shall endeavor to open and explain pro modulo meo, so far forth as
I can attain unto; and to adjust the bounds, and fix the limits, as near as I
can, between the Holy Ghost, and the holy Men of God; and show the Work and
share of each in this performance; and that because there is none that I have
met with in the narrow compass of my Reading, that has handled it to my
satisfaction.

Wherein I implore the Assistance of that Holy Spirit, the Inditer of the Holy
Scriptures, that I may steer an even course without turning aside to the right
hand or to the left, by attributing either too much or too little to either of
'em, but may render to God the things that are God's, and to Man the things
that are Man's.

. 4. There is indeed a late Author (La Mothe) who has written a Discourse upon
this Subject, Entitled, [The Inspiration of the New Testament asserted and
explained.] I shall first. give an account of his Explication, and then offer
my own sense and thoughts to consideration. His Judgment in the case he
expresses thus; That we may have a distinct Idea of the Inspiration of the Holy
Writings, it is requisite to distinguish the things which they contain; which I
shall do into three Orders. In the first I shall put the Revelations. The
second is for those things which the Apostles learnt by the natural assistances
of their Hearing and Sight. In the third you shall see the Progress which they
made by reasoning upon the Truths of the two first Orders. -- So that you see
the Apostles wrote things which they knew by Revelation, by Sense, or by
Reasoning. P. 103.

In reference to the Revelations which the Apostles had, he says, The Holy
Ghost acts two ways in relation to the Truths which he has revealed by the
Apostles. First he suggested those Truths which he imprinted in their Souls by
some of those ways which I have set down, wherein the Apostles were in a
passive disposition; like a piece of Cloth that receives the Colors. It Is in
this manner that they were instructed; but when they set themselves to instruct
others, and communicate in writing what the Holy Ghost had taught 'em, he acted
after another manner: he pusht 'em forward to write: he strengthened and
refresht their Memories; and so directed their Pens that they wrote nothing
which was not to the purpose, and according to the most exact Rules of Truth.
There was then in the written Revelations which they have left us, two sorts of
Inspiration; Inspiration of Suggestion, and Inspiration of Direction. P. 108.
He suggested to 'em those things that they knew not; but as for those things
which they knew they had need only of his Direction to render 'em infallible in
their Writings. P. 109. And presently after he speaks to this purpose, That
some things they knew by their Education: others by common Conversation.
Concerning these a new Suggestion was absolutely needless, because Miracles are
not to be multiplied without necessity. Therefore he did not whisper into the
Ears of the Apostles what they knew before. He was not obliged to begin but
where Nature had ended. It was enough that he spoke when she became silent. Let
us not imagine that he was only a Spectator of the Functions of Nature; He
brought her to Perfection, and hindered her from going astray. P. 111. The share
which we believe the Holy Ghost had in the writing of those things (which they
knew before) is 1. That he was the Primum Mobile of the Composition; 'twas he
that set the Apostles at work, whether it were in furnishing 'em with Occasions
and Subjects to write upon; or whether it were by secretly stirring 'em up to
write, I may say, He put the Pen in their Hands. 2. He presided in the Choice
of the Matter which was to be put into the work, not suffering the Apostles to
write any thing but what was true, and to the purpose. This is an Inspiration
of Direction; nor does there need any more to be said, as to the Truths which
they had heard and seen. P. 112. He let us 'em alone when they go right, and
when they are about to miscarry, he brings 'em back again. P. 121.

For their own Reasonings, It Is known, says he, to be the usual custom of the
Apostles, to accompany the Truths which the Spirit suggested to 'em with
certain Reflections. e.g. St. Peter joining the Vision of the Sheet, to the
Vision that was seen by Cornelius, Of a truth, says he, now I perceive that
God is no respecter of persons, etc. St. Paul, after he had declared what the
Spirit had said in express terms touching such as would depart from the Faith,
makes a short Discourse upon it, 1 Timothy 4.1. -- When thus they reasoned upon
the Oracles, the Apostles had no need of being inspired; to take the word in a
sense of Suggestion. Their Reason fortified and guided by the Holy Ghost, whose
Instruments they were, was sufficient for 'em to find out in the revealed
Propositions the Conclusions that were included in 'em. Natural Logic would
have served the Turn: Here we have no recourse to the Holy Ghost, but to
warrant the Infallibility of the Reflection of the Apostles. P. 113, 114.

This is the substance of the whole of his Judgment herein. But this account
seems to me very lame and defective, and also Derogatory to the Majesty and
Authority of the Holy Scriptures; and therefore I have bestowed some thoughts
upon it for my own satisfaction; which I have mustered up together, and drawn
forth in these ensuing Propositions.

. 5. Prop. I. The Holy Scriptures contain Matter of several sorts. The Subject
Matter of the Holy Scriptures is various, and of diverse sorts; Some Parts of
the Scripture are Historical, recording what has bin done in former times: Some
are Prophetical, foretelling what shall be done hereafter: Some Doctrinal,
teaching what we must Believe; and some Practical, acquainting us with our
Duty, which we must do, or leave undone. And these are interwoven with
Precepts, Prohibitions, Promises, Threatenings, Prayers, Soliloquies, and the
like.

It is necessary that we distinguish these well the one from the other, because
they require several sorts of Inspiration, as will appear in what follows.

6. Prop. II. It is the Property and Prerogative of all Scripture, of what sort
soever, to be by Inspiration of God. This not being my main business, but only
in order to it, as I pass along, I shall not go far for evidence, but content
my self with such Proofs as are ready at hand, and offer themselves willingly
to my thoughts.

7. This Proposition I shall prove particularly and by Parts, in reference to
the Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament: Wherein it is not so much my
purpose to convince or confute Antiscripturists (this has been done abundantly
and unanswerably by many more able and learned Pens) as to confirm honest,
humble Souls, that are willing to be satisfied by such plain, intrinsic
Arguments as are contained in, and taken out of the Bowels of the Scripture it
self.

First, The Scriptures of the Old Testament are by Inspiration of God.

This I shall prove,

1. By the Testimony of the two great Apostles, Peter and Paul. It is expressly
affirmed by the Apostle Paul, 2 Timothy 3.16. (...). All Scripture (not only some
parts of such and such Books, but the whole Scripture, and whole of Scripture:
Whatsoever comes under the name of Scripture, without any distinction or
difference; by whomsoever written is (...), God-inspired. Not [All Scripture
that is God-inspired] (as the Polonian-Merchants would have it) as if there
were some that were not so: for the Verb Substantive must needs be understood
between (...) and (...), and not between (...) and (...), because the
Conjunction comes between, which renders (...) to be the second Epithet of)
(...), as (...) is the first. Here are two things affirmed concerning the
Scripture (as Estius observes,) (1.) Its Authority, that it is from God. (2.)
Its Utility, that it is profitable for the Ends and Purposes following. This
then must needs include at least all the Scriptures of the Old Testament.

Again, The Apostle Peter also affirms the same, 2 Pet. 1.21. For the prophecy
came not in old time (or rather at any time, (...)) by the will of man: but
holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Where observe (1.)
The Subject he speaks of; with the Title whereby he expresses it, Prophecy:
which is not to be understood strictly, for the Foretelling of things to come;
or the Writings only of the Prophets; but largely, for any Revelation or
Discovery of the Will of God to the Penmen of Scripture. This appears by v. 19.
where he says, We have a more sure word of Prophecy (that is, of the
Revelation of the Will of God, viz. in Scripture; in contradistinction to the
Revelation of God's Will in that Voice that came from Heaven to Christ at his
Transfiguration) -- whereto you do well to give heed. This is a duty that
belongs to the whole Scripture of the Old Testament, as well as to the
Prophetical parts, and therefore includes the whole. Hence all the Penmen of
the Old Testament are called Prophets, Ephesians. 2.20. Romans 16.26. And therefore the
word [Prophecy] here, must include the whole. Of this Voice he shows the
Original: and that both Negatively; It came not by the Will of man. It was not
the Conception, Composure, Indictment or Product of men's own Brains, nor the
Suggestion of their own Spirits; They were not the first Movers in this Work:
But, Positively, holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
Where observe (1.) The primum mobile, or first Mover, the Holy Ghost. (2.) The
Instrumental Cause, or Instruments he made use of, holy men of God. Such were
all the Penmen of the several Books of the Old Testament. (3.) What befell 'em:
How it fared with 'em in this Work, when they wrote these Books; they were
moved by the Holy Ghost; (...). As the Writings of the Scriptures were (...)
(according to Paul) so the Writers were (...) (according to Peter here) acted
and moved by the Holy Ghost: under his immediate Conduct and impulse. As the
Spirit came upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost, as a rushing, mighty
wind, Act. 2.2. (the same word is used there, (...)) so he rushed in a powerful
manner upon these holy men of God, the Penmen of the holy Scriptures. (4.)
When, or upon what Occasion it was thus with 'em: It was in reference to what
they spoke: which includes their Writing also: For the Prophets did deliver all
their Prophesies to the People by word of mouth first, and then wrote 'em down
afterward, as appears by some Passages in Jeremy. But for some other parts of
Scripture they were only written: yet this Writing, or what was so written, was
(...), as Paul assures us in the place beforementioned. Besides, The Subject
that Peter is here treating of is the whole Scripture; as appears by the
Context, v. 19. and I proved before. And so the word (...) is used concerning
the whole Scripture, Acts 2.31. David spoke of the Resurrection of Christ,
(viz. Psalm. 16.10.) i. e. wrote. So Acts 3.24. All the Prophets from Samuel,
and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of
these days, Romans 3.19. Whatsoever the law (i. e. the whole Scripture of the Old
Testament, as appears by the foregoing words) says, it says to them that are
under the law. Hence the Scriptures in general are called (...), the Oracles of
God, Romans 3.2.

8. 2. That the Scriptures of the Old Testament are by Divine Inspiration, I
prove by a distinct view and consideration of the several Books of the Old
Testament; whereby it will appear that there is an evident character and stamp
of Divinity imprinted upon 'em.

First, For the Books of Moses: They contain an account of many things before
his own Time, which he must have either by Revelation, Tradition, or Writings
and Records.

(1.) Some things must of necessity be by Revelation: As, What God said to
Cain, Genesis 4.6, 7, 9, etc. for it is very unlikely that Cain himself would tell
it to any. So Lamech's Speech to his Wives, v. 23, 24. God's purpose to destroy
the Old World by the Flood, chapter 6. 3, etc. God's accepting of Noah's Sacrifice,
chapter 8. 21. -- he said in his heart. What God said concerning the building of
Babel, chapter 11. 6, 7. The cause of the Plague on Pharaoh and his House, chapter 12.
17. God's dealing with Abimelech concerning Sarah, chapter 20. 3. etc. The Passages
between Abimelech and Isaac concerning his Wife, chapter 26. 8. etc. What God said
to Laban in a Dream, chapter 31. 24. Rachel's sitting upon the Images, v. 34. The
Conspiracy of Joseph's Brethren against him, chapter 37. 18, etc. The reason why Er
and Onan were slain, chapter 38. 7 -- 10. Judah's lying with Tamar, v. 12, etc. and
many such Passages.

(2.) For Tradition and Writing, It Is very unlikely that many things recorded
by Moses should either be conveyed by Tradition, or committed to Writing: As,
The Agreement between Abram and Sarah to say, She was his sister, Genesis 12.11,
etc. What passed between Abram and Pharaoh, v. 18. etc. What passed between
Abram and Lot, c. 13. 8, etc. Sarah's giving her Maid to Abram, c. 16. 2, 3.
What Rebecca said to Isaac, c. 27. 46. Jacob's device about the Sheep, c. 30.
37, etc.

These, and multitudes of such private, particular, personal Passages, are not
proper matter either for Tradition, or a History: and therefore they must be
made known to Moses by Revelation.

Some things also which were done in his Time, and recorded by him, yet were
foreign Affairs: Such wherein he had no personal concernment, and therefore
could not be known by him but by Revelation: as the Passages between Balack and
Balaam; and the Angel's standing in the way to slay Balaam, Number. 22, and 23,
and 24.

9. Secondly, For the Historical Books, which contain Matters of Fact, there
are many things there also which could not be known but by immediate
Revelation: As, God's being angry with Israel, and what he said thereupon;
Judge. 2.20 -- 23. What Gaal said privately to the men of Sechem, c. 9. 28, etc.
The Passages between Micah and his Mother, c. 17. 2-5. What the Danites said
one to another, c. 18. 14. The Passages between the Levite and his
Father-in-law, c. 19. 5-10. and those Passages, v. 16-26. All the Book of Ruth.
The carriage of the Philistines about the Ark, 1. Sam. 5.6. How should it be
known what the Servants of the King of Syria said to him, but by Revelation? 1
King. 20.23-25. All the beginning of the Story of Naaman (2 Kings 5.) probably
was by Revelation only. What is spoken of God, 2 Kings 14.26, 27.

It Is evident that these things, or most of 'em, could be known no otherwise
than by immediate Inspiration: And if some be by Inspiration, then all are; for
Christ makes no difference when he bids us search the Scriptures: And Paul
says expressly, That all Scripture is (...).

10. Thirdly, For the Book of Job, it may be looked upon as an Historical Book,
though the History does contain Doctrinal matter of diverse sorts, yet it is all
Matter of fact; being a Narrative of what was spoken by one and another:
wherein, though Job's Friends were in the wrong as to their particular
Application of what they said to Job, yet it is observed, That they were so
guided (by the Spirit of God, doubtless) that there is no one Sentence
considered singly by it self, that is contrary to other Scripture. Besides,
This is one of the Books we have received from the Jews, who were God's
Trustees and Depositaries for the safe custody of the Oracles of God; Romans 3.2.
and they were never taxed for unfaithfulness in this trust, either by Christ or
the Apostles: And further, the Authority thereof is fully confirmed by that
Passage of St. James, c. 5. 11. and by those other Passages quoted in the New
Testament out of it.

11. Fourthly, That the Psalms were indicted by the Spirit of God appears by
these places; 2 Samuel 23.2. Mark 12.36. Acts 4.25. and 1.16. Heb. 3.7. And then,
many of 'em are Prophetical, of Christ, his Kingdom, Sufferings, etc. and of
the Calling of the Gentiles.

Fifthly, The Writings of the Prophets are most evidently of Divine
Inspiration; for they are generally nothing but a Rehearsal or Transcript of
what God spoke To and By 'em; as appears by the several particulars.

Esaias is nothing but a Collection of his Prophecies, and so, all the very Words
of God: only with a part of Hezekiah's History, chapter 36-39.

Jeremy and Ezekiel are mostly the same too; interwoven with some Historical
Passages of the Affairs of the Church in those times, and some of their own
personal Concerns: Wherein, tho some things were the product of their own
Spirits (as those passionate Expressions, Jer. 20.14, etc. yet the recording of
'em in Scripture was by the special direction of the Holy Ghost.

Daniel is a good part of it Prophetical, and therefore must be of divine
Original.

Hosea contains nothing but the Words of God; except the account of his
Obedience to God's Command, c. 1.

Joel is all the Words of God.

Amos the same; except a Narrative of some Visions, c. 7. 8. 9.

Obadiah, only the Words of God.

Jonah Historical.

Micah, the Words of God mostly.

Nahum the same.

Habakkuk a kind of Dialogue between God and the Prophet, c. 1, and 2. and a
Prayer, c. 3.

Zephaniah, all of it the Words of God.

Haggai the same.

Zechariah consists most of Visions concerning the State of the Church in those
days. See the Argument to it in my Annotations.

Malachi, all of it the Words of God.

So that it is most apparent that all this part of Scripture is of divine
Inspiration; yea that the very words were dictated to 'em by the Spirit of God,
though accommodated to the particular genius of every one; as will be seen
Prop. 5.

12. 3. How many things are there in the Scriptures of the Old Testament (as
well as the New) which transcend all humane Abilities, and not to be matched in
any humane Writings, and are peculiar to God alone? Never could enter into the
heart of man any thing like that Dialogue between God the Father, and God the
Son, Esa. 49.1-12. Never did or could any man declare the sincerity of the
heart, whenas the Actions might seem to argue the contrary, as in Asa, 2 Chronicles.
15.13. with 16.10, 12. Never did, nor could any speak in the name of God, as
the Scripture frequently does: Thus says the Lord. Never did any man pretend
to make such Promises and Threatenings of Spiritual and Eternal things, as the
Scripture does. Where are such lofty strains to be found in any humane Authors,
as that Description of the Entertainment of the King of Egypt by his Dead
Confederates? Ezekiel. 32.21-32. or that Elegant Prosopopeia of the Inanimate
Creatures, and the dead at the destruction of Babylon; and for the King of
Babylon's Entertainment in the Grave, Isa. 14.9-20. as also of God's Judgments
upon the Jews for their treacherous dealing with the Messiah, Isa. 24.17-23.
Consider also the lofty strain of those Passages and Prophecies which are
spoken by the Prophets in the name of God; as Isa. 24. and Isaiah's Address to
God thereupon, c. 25. and 26. So, no man could ever have certainly told that
the reason why the Corinthians were visited with such sicknesses and
weaknesses, was for their eating and drinking unworthily at the Lord's Table,
if it had not been immediately dictated to him by the Holy Ghost. These things
and many such like could not have their Rise from any Man's brain, but must
come aliunde, yea (...) from above; must be put into 'em by the immediate
Dictate of the Spirit of God.

. 13. Secondly, the Scriptures of the New Testament are equal sharers with
those of the Old Testament in this Privilege and Prerogative to be (...),
God-inspired. For,

1. The Writings of the New Testament are comprehended in the word [Scripture]
and called by that name, as well as the Writings of the Old Testament. Peter
gives this Title to Paul's Epistles, 2 Pet. 3.16. -- As also in all his
Epistles, in which there are some things hard to be understood, which they that
are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do the other Scriptures to their own
destruction; implying that Paul's Epistles stand upon the same ground, and have
as good a title and claim to the word [Scripture] as any other Writings
whatsoever.

2. The Scriptures of the Apostles are the foundation of our Faith, as well as
the Scriptures of the Prophets, Ephesians. 2.20.

3. Paul was endued with Divine Wisdom in what he wrote, 2 Pet. 3.15. and
expressly affirms of himself, that what he spoke and wrote was, The Word of God,
1 Cor. 7-40. and 14.37. 1 These. 2.13.

4. The Gospel Dispensation being much more glorious in many respects than that
of the Law, (2 Cor. 3.7-11.) and the Apostles being the chief Officers in the
New Testament, they must at least have an equal assistance with the highest
under the Law. Nay rather, as he that is least in the Kingdom of God is greater
than he that was greater than all the Prophets, so the Divine Abilities of the
Apostles must much more excel those of the Prophets.

5. Otherwise all the Promises and Threatenings delivered by the Apostles would
be of no force nor efficacy, nor could have any influence upon the Conscience;
the contrary whereto is found by daily experience; and therefore their Writings
must be immediate dictates of the Holy Ghost as well as those delivered by the
Prophets, and which Christ spoke with his own mouth.

And if these Promises and Threatenings were uttered by the Inspiration of the
Holy Ghost, then also what goes before, and what follows after; for they are so
nearly linkt together, and interwoven one with another that they must proceed
from the same Spirit. For, can any one think that the Holy Ghost assisted the
Apostles by Suggestion in one Verse and passage, and only by Direction, (i. e.
by watching over 'em that they should not err) in the next? Look over all those
precious Promises wherewith the Apostolical Writings are bespangled, as the Sky
with Stars, (which I have recited in the Table of the Promises at the end of my
Annotations on the Bible) and judge whether they could proceed from any but one
immediately acted and assisted by the Holy Ghost in the writing of 'em. And
then further consider 'em with the Antecedents and Consequents, and the close,
intimate Union between 'em, and then judge whether they don't evidently
discover the same kind of Assistance in the whole. I Will instance but in one,
viz. that Promise, Romans 6.14. For sin shall not have dominion over you. Observe
how the Apostle brings it in, in the same thread, or tenor of discourse with
what goes before: and therefore they must be all of the same stamp; and if the
Promises (and so for the Threatenings) be the immediate Dictates of the Spirit,
so must the rest also.

It is not with the Writings of the Apostles as with a piece of Embroidered
work, which is first wrought in the Loom by one hand, and then Embroidered by
another; but like a piece of rich Silk inwrought with Flowers of Gold and
Silver, all of a piece; wrought by the same hand, all at the same time, yet one
part is richer than another: So it is with these composures, though one part be
richer than another, yet all is the work of the same hand.

6. Yet we may observe some difference between the Writings of the Prophets and
Apostles, in these three respects especially. (1) The Prophets delivered all in
the Name of the Lord: Thus says the Lord: whereas the Apostles wrote in their
own Names: so most of the Epistles begin, and have the Name of the Penman set
in the Front. (2) The Books of the Prophets are but a Collection, or aggregate
Body of several Prophecies or Visions added one to another: whereas the
Writings of the Apostles are carried on in a continued tenor of Discourse,
without any such interruptions, and breaking off the thread of the Matter, as
in the Prophets. (3.) The Prophets had not a constant, uninterrupted influx of
the Spirit, but he fell upon 'em at certain Times and Seasons, according to his
own pleasure; therefore you have the several Prophecies of the same Prophet
bearing date at several times: and Ezekiel was made dumb, in some respect, till
a certain season, c. 3. 26, 27. and 24. 27. See my Annotations there. So when
the Captains of the Forces and Johanan came to Jeremy for direction from him (
Jer. 42.1-3.) it is said, v. 7. that after ten days came the Word of the Lord
to Jeremiah: Whereas the Apostles seem to have had a constant assistance of the
Spirit upon all occasions; so that wheresoever they came, they were ready to
preach the Word of God to the People of those places. And therefore in this
respect the Apostles had much the pre-eminence and advantage of the Prophets,
as was hinted just now, n. 4.

So then the whole Bulk and Body of Scripture contained in the Writings of the
Old and New Testament is (...), God-inspired; which is the second Proposition.

. 14. Prop. III. This Inspiration did not deprive the Persons inspired, of
their Reason and Understanding. Thus indeed it befell those by whom the Devil
delivered his Oracles: for the Evil Spirit that possessed 'em, used to swell and
blow up their Bodies, especially their Breasts and Bellies, like a Bladder or
Bottle, (as it is recorded of the Pythian Prophetess, or Witch rather) and to
cast 'em into a kind of Frenzy, and then delivered his Oracles by 'em with a
hoarse or hollow Voice, as if they spoke out of their Bellies (thence called
(...), by the Greeks) or out of a Bottle, whence they had their Name (...) in
Hebrew. But it was not so with those that were (...): they were not mente
capti, and so used only as Pipes to convey such and such things through 'em, to
which they contributed nothing at all, except the Writing, but were merely
Passive. Bid (on 2 Pet. 1.19.) mentions and confutes some in his time that
maintained this foolish fancy. Neither were they used as mere Amanuenses to
write what the Holy Ghost dictated word for word to 'em, without the use of
their own Judgment: but the Holy Ghost employed 'em as reasonable Persons,
endu'd with abilities of Understanding, Judgment, and the like. Their Faculties
were not laid aside, nor laid asleep (as Adam's was when he lost his Rib.) They
did not put off Man when they put on God: But,

. 15. Prop. IV. The Holy Ghost made use of the Natural Faculties and Abilities
of those whom he employed in writing the Holy Scriptures. Their Understanding,
Reason, Judgment, Memory, Affections were all set on work, and did concur. He
made use of their Heads and Hearts as well as Hands. So that they made use of
their own Reason, Judgment and Understanding; as is undeniably evident from
Luke's Preface to his Gospel, where the Examples of others was one
(subordinate) Motive to engage him to write: Since many have taken in hand --
it seemed good to me also -- Luke 1.1-3. Yet withal, he was moved by the Holy
Ghost also, so that he might have added (as the Council of Jerusalem did) It
seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to me. So David's heart was inditing a good
matter, Psalm. 45.1. And Peter upon consideration of his sudden departure, was
careful to leave that in Writing which might be of use to 'em after his
decease, that they might have those things always in remembrance, 2 Pet. 1.14,
15,

To this Head must be referred such passages as these. Romans 15.28. When I have
performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I Will come by you into
Spain. These were his present thoughts; wherein yet it is supposed he was
prevented by the Providence of God. 1 Cor. 7.10. To the married I command; yet
not I, but the Lord, etc. Heb. 13.22, 23. I beseech you Brethren, suffer the
word of Exhortation; for I have written a Letter to you in few words. Know ye
that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I
will see you. 2 Cor. 11.17. That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord,
but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting. V. 23. I speak as a
fool. So c. 12. 2. I knew a man in Christ -- whether in the body or out of the
body, I cannot tell, etc. Here the Holy Ghost directs Paul to speak only his
own thoughts and knowledge, without acquainting him whether it was in the Body
or out of the Body. Thus everywhere generally the Apostle speaks all in his
own Person, though withal he asserts his having the Spirit, 1 Cor. 7.-40. So that
I say, There was a concurrence of both.

And by this Assistance of the Holy Ghost, their natural Faculties were
advanced and improved to the highest pitch (as will be seen more fully
afterward.) As Grace is ingrafted into and inoculated upon Nature to refine
and perfect it, so this divine afflatus was superadded to their natural
Abilities to rectify and elevate 'em: as appears in Paul's Arguings
everywhere; especially in his Epistles to the Romans, Galatians and Hebrews.

. 16. Prop. V. As the Holy Ghost in the composure of Scripture, made use of the
Reason and Understanding of the Penmen, so He attemper'd and accommodated his
Inspiration to the particular genius of each Writer. Hereby it came to pass,
That the Liquor savored of the Pipe through which it ran. As God concurrs with
all Creatures according to their particular Natures; with Natural Agents
Naturally; with Free Agents Voluntarily; so he did assist these Writers in a
way suitable to their own natural Apprehensions and Abilities; so that their
Style and Language wherewith they clothed their Matter, was of the same Strain
and Make with that which they used commonly in expressing their own Conceptions
by, upon other occasions. Yet this must be understood only for the generality;
for doubtless upon some special Occasions the Holy Ghost might suggest other
Words, as well as Matter to 'em, than what they had been accustomed to formerly.

Dr. Owen indeed seems to be otherwise minded, That there was nothing of their
own particular genius to be found in any of their Writings: for he expresses
himself thus: Neither has their success been much better, who have exercised
their Critical Ability in judging of the Style of the particular Writers of the
Scripture, preferring one before and above another; whereas the Style of every
one of them is best suited to the subject Matter whereof he treats, and the End
aimed at, and the Persons with whom he had to do. And herein Jerome (Praefat. in
Isaiam and Amosum) has led the way to others, and drawn many into a common
mistake. The Style of Isaiah, he says, is proper, urbane, high and excellent:
but that of Hosea, and especially of Amos, low, plain, improper, savouring of
the Country, and his Profession, who was a Shepherd. But those that understand
their Style and Language will not easily give consent unto him, tho the report
be commonly admitted by the most. It is true, there appears in Isaiah an
excellent (...) in his Exhortations, Expostulations and Comminations; attended
with Efficacious Apostrophes, Prosopopaeiaes, Metaphors and Allusions; a
compacted Fullness in his Prophecies and Predictions, a sweet Evangelical
Spiritualness in his Expression of Promises, with frequent Paranomosiaes and
Elleipses, which have a special Elegancy in that Language; whence he is usually
instanced in by learned Men, as an Example of the Eloquence of the divine
Writings, and his (...) preferred to that of Eschines, Demosthenes or Cicero.
But the Reader must take heed that he look not for the peculiar Excellencies of
that Prophet absolutely in the Words used by him, but rather in the Things that
it pleased the Holy Ghost to use him as his Instrument in the Revelation of.
But the other part of Jerome's Censure is utterly devoid of any good foundation.
The Style of Amos, considering the subject Matter that he treats of, and the
Persons with whom he had to do, in suiting of Words and Speech, wherein all
true solid Eloquence consists, is every way as proper, as Elegant as that of
Isaiah. Neither will the knowing Reader find him wanting in any of the
Celebrated Styles of Writing, where occasion unto them is administered. Thus he.
Exercit. on Ep. to Heb. Vol. 1. p. 15.. 27.

But that the Holy Ghost did thus accommodate himself to the particular genius
of the Penman, both as to Words and Style, seems evident to me by diverse
instances; as of David, whose natural Inclination led him to Music, to which
he was addicted from his Youth, 1 Samuel 16.18. and probably to Poesy too, in
regard of the near Affinity that is between 'em; and accordingly the Holy Ghost
imploys him in composing and inditing of Psalms: whence he was called The sweet
Psalmist of Israel, 2 Samuel 23.-1. So Solomon, famous for Wisdom, was used in
Writing of Proverbs, wherein the Quintessence and Marrow of Wisdom does
discover it self: He likewise having had the fullest Experience of the Vanity
of all worldly Enjoyments that ever any one had, is employed to write upon that
Subject. So Paul, who was both a great Scholar, and wrapped up into the third
Heaven, shows more Learning than any other of the Apostles, and also treats of
the most sublime and divine Mysteries of the Gospel.

This likewise appears in the different Praeterea scito unum quemque Prophetam
paculiare quid habere, and in ca lingua, caque loque^i ratione quae ipsi est
familiaris and consue^a, ipsum impelli a Prophetia sua ad loquendum ei qui
intelligit ipsum. Maim. More Nev. p. 11. c. 29.
Styles of the Prophets. Esaias, a Courtier, writes in a lofty, elegant Style,
embellished with frequent Paranomasies. Jeremy writes in a more plain and easy
Style. Ezekiel is full of Parables, Types, Allegorical and Mystical
Representations; which occasioned profane Spirits to scoff at him as an
Enigmatical, obscure Writer. c. 20. 49. Does he not speak Parables? Hosea's
Style is very concise, and consequently obscure.

Now this difference cannot arise merely from the difference of the Subjects
(as I grant it must needs do in some cases, viz. Historical and Poetical
Writings) for the Prophecies of Jeremy and Ezekiel; as they agree very much in
respect of Time, so they do in Argument also: viz. To denounce Judgments
against the Jews for their Sins, and particularly to foretell the Babylonish
Captivity for seventy years; as Jeremy does: and also the Destruction of the
Temple and City; as Ezekiel does: And for Ezekiel to confirm what Jeremy had
delivered, and to Prophecy the same things (though more vehemently) in Chaldea,
that Jeremy had done in Judea.

So that, I say, this difference of their Styles did not proceed either from
the Subjects they wrote about, nor merely from the Holy Ghost, but their own
particular genius (mostly) and way of Expression.

These things I have premised by way of Introduction, to usher in my main
Design and Business, which is to open the Nature of that (...), or (...),
wherewith the Penmen of the sacred Oracles were assisted in the Composition of
the Holy Scriptures: which I now enter upon in

. 17. Prop. VI. The Inspiration of the Holy Ghost to the Penmen of Scripture
does include and contain diverse things in it. It does consist of several
Ingredients, as I may say. The Holy Ghost assisted the Penmen of Scripture
several ways. His Agency herein may be laid out in these following Particulars.

1. He moved and stirred 'em up to write by a particular Impulse. He was the
primum mobile that set all the Wheels a going. He called 'em into this
Vineyard, and set 'em all a work. This he did sometimes by a particular,
express Command: as to Moses to write several things, Exodus 17.14. and 34.27.
and to Jeremy, c. 30. 2. and 36. 2. and to John, Rev. 1.10: But most usually by
a strong Impulse ((...)) upon their Spirits, which effectually inclined, and
disposed 'em to the Work. He spoke to 'em with a strong hand, Esa. 8.11. See
Jer. 20.9.

The Penman did not first resolve and purpose with himself to write such a
Book (as in ordinary Cases) and then the Spirit did (...) (as it is said in
another case, Romans 8.26.) No; this was not the Method: This is expressly
denied, 2 Pet. 1.19. The prophecy came not in old time by the Will of Man. The
Will of Man was not the first Mover, but the Spirit of God; as it follows there.

True indeed, they made use of their Understanding and Reason (as I said
before,) It seemed good to me, says Luke: And hence the Work wrought, or
Effect produced was Theirs: called therefore The Gospel of Matthew: The Epistle
of Paul, etc. But inasmuch as they were therein assisted by the Holy Ghost in
those ways and manners as are here laid down, the Work done may be also
ascribed to the Holy Ghost. And so it is Heb. 3.7. The Holy Ghost says, To day
if you will hear his voice, etc. And of the Prophets in general it is said,
That the Spirit of God in them did signify such and such things, 1 Pet. 1.11.
There was a Concurrence of both. So Mark 12.36. David himself said by the Holy
Ghost: and 2 Pet. 1.19. Holy Men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost. As that which is dictated by one, and written by another, the Work may
be ascribed to both; to one as the Principal, to the other as the Instrumental
Cause: Though, I confess, this instance does not fully reach the Case, because
the Penmen of Scripture had a greater share in the Work than as mere
Amanuenses, as was showed.

. 18. 2. The Holy Ghost was their Task-master to set 'em their Tasks. He cut
out every one's work for him. He appointed 'em their share: assigned 'em that
Part and Province they were to adorn and cultivate. There was a great Work to
be done; the perfect Revelation of the Will of God for our Salvation: diverse
Instructions and Directions to be given, some by one hand, some by another, to
teach us how to govern our selves in our Way, till we arrive at our Journey's
end: Much Provision of all sorts, both for Food and Physic was to be made:
many Workmen to be employed herein, who knew not each others Task: Therefore it
was necessary there should be one general Supervisor, or Overseer, to assign to
each one what his share should be; and that according to his particular Talent
and Ability. As in the Parable of the Talents it is said, The Owner of the
Talents gave to every man according to his several ability, Matthew. 25.15. So it
was here. The Work of the sweet Psalmist of Israel, was to compose Psalms: of
the Wisest of Men, to utter Proverbs: of that Apostle that was wrapped up into
the third Heaven, and there heard (...), unutterable matters, to declare, both
by Tongue and Pen, the deep things of God, concerning Election, Predestination,
Justification; Cutting off the natural Branches of the Olive, and ingrafting
wild Branches into their room; Abolishing the whole Frame of Mosaical
Institutions; opening the Nature of Christ's Priesthood: showing the Manner of
the Resurrection, and the Nature of Spiritual Bodies, and the like.

. 19. 3. The Holy Ghost assisted the Penmen of Scripture by way of
Illumination of their Minds, whereby they had a distinct understanding of all
those Truths, whether Doctrinal or Practical, that were to be delivered by 'em.
They saw all in a true and clear Light: and therefore they did not falter, or
swerve in the least from the truth in any point. They made no false steps, but
were secured, both from stumbling in the way, and stepping aside out of it.
Hence it comes to pass, that all their Arguings are sound and solid, and all
their Inferences from Scripture or Reason, are well bottomed.

. 20. For the Penmen of the Historical Parts of Scripture, this kind of
Assistance does not so much belong unto them, because their Writings contain,
for the most part, only Matters of Fact, which are easily intelligible: and
therefore I apply this kind of Assistance chiefly to the Writings of the
Prophets (strictly taken) and Apostles. Many things indeed in the Writings of
the Prophets are plain enough, the Subject of 'em being purely Practical; as
Instructions to the People about their Duty, Reproof for their Sins, Promises
of Mercy to the Penitent, Denunciations of Judgment against the Impenitent, and
the like; and sometimes also there are Matters Historical. And when among
these, any thing was Parabolically, Typically, or Mystically represented,
either they had a clear understanding of it themselves, or the meaning of it
was revealed to 'em by the Spirit of God: as we find in many instances: as, In
those Visions of an Almond-tree, and a Seething-pot, with the face toward the
North, Jer. 1.11-16. So the Types of a linen Girdle, and Bottles filled with
Wine, were expounded, Jer. 13.9-14. and in many other places of that Prophecy.
The like was done to Ezekiel, for his lying so many days upon his side, Ezekiel.
4.4-8. and to Amos c. 7. 7, 8. and 8. 2. Zech. 1.19, 21. and 4.11-14. and 5. 6,
etc.

. 21. Other things were Predictions of what was to come to pass hereafter; and
that either in a way of Judgment, as the Seventy years Captivity in Babylon,
and many suchlike Evils: or in a way of Mercy, as their Return from Babylon;
and all those Prophecies concerning Christ and his Kingdom, in the latter part
of Esaias, and other places. These they understood also, for the substance of
'em, though possibly not every Circumstance; for Peter says, They enquired and
searched diligently about the Salvation they prophesied of, searching what, or
what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it
testified beforehand the Sufferings of Christ, 1 Pet. 1.10, 11. However, I
say, they understood at least the Substance of their Prophecies; as appears by
those words Dan. 10.-1. A thing was revealed unto Daniel -- and he understood
the thing, and had understanding of the Vision. See also c. 9. 22. and 10. 14.
And when he did not understand some things, an Angel was employed to unfold the
meaning of 'em to him: as c. 8. 15-19. and 12. 8, 11.

. 22. Then for the Apostles, it is clear that the Holy Ghost did enable them
fully to Comprehend, or at least to Apprehend all those Mysteries of the
Christian Religion which they committed to Writing; as Paul testifies of
himself, Ephesians. 3. 3, 4. How that by Revelation he made known unto me the
mystery, as I wrote before in few words, whereby, when ye read, ye may
understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ. And it must needs be so; for

This Assistance of the Holy Ghost was promised to 'em by Christ, John 16.13.
When the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth; for he
shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak,
and he will show you things to come: and Luke 24.49. Behold I send the promise
of my Father upon you. That Promise of the Father was the Holy Ghost; as
appears by Acts 1.4, 5. And being assembled with them, commanded them that they
should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father,
which, says he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with Water, but
ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.

. 23. Yet concerning this I observe, That this Knowledge was not communicated
to 'em all at once, but by degrees: For (1.) They were trained up in Christ's
Family, and under the Influence of his continual Instructions. Mark 4.34. When
they were alone, he expounded all things to his Disciples. (2.) After his
Resurrection he expounded to 'em in all the Scriptures the things concerning
himself, Luke 24.27. (3.) After that, He opened their Understandings to
understand the Scriptures, v. 45. So that they could apply those
Scripture-Prophecies which concerned Christ, pertinently and patly, according
to the true meaning of the Holy Ghost in 'em: and that beyond the first and
immediate sense of the words: as in that passage of David, Psalm. 34.20. He
keeps all his bones: not one of 'em is broken: Wherein David seems to speak
only of Righteous men in general, and of God's watchful Providence over 'em: (
See Pool there:) but in John it is applied to that particular of Christ's bones
not being broken, John 19.36. (4.) Some further degrees of Knowledge, or the
Holy Ghost, were, doubtless, communicated to 'em, when Christ breathed on 'em,
saying, Receive the Holy Ghost, John 20.22. (5.) Afterward they were filled
with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2.4. And yet (6.) After that,
They were further instructed in some particular Points: as Peter was concerning
the Calling of the Gentiles, and the freedom of Conversation they might take
with 'em, by Vision, Acts 10.9-15. with v. 28, 34.

By all which ways they were furnished at length with such a stock and treasure
of Knowledge and Understanding, as might enable 'em both in Writing and
Preaching to bring forth things new and old, Matthew. 13.52. By these Ways, Steps
and Methods, all the Mysteries of the Christian Faith were fully and clearly
revealed to the Apostles and Prophets of the New Testament, Ephesians. 3.3-6.

. 24. But as for Paul, it was otherwise with him. His Case was peculiar. He was
not one of those that accompanied with the rest of the Apostles all the time
that the Lord Jesus went in and out before 'em (Acts 1.21.) but was (...) (1
Cor. 15.8.) an Abortive, a Castling, one born out of due time, not being called
while Christ was upon Earth (as the other Apostles were) but was called in an
extraordinary way by an immediate Voice from Heaven: therefore besides that
stock of common, natural Knowledge, which he acquired by his learned Education,
it may seem that his supernatural Knowledge in all the Mysteries of the
Christian Religion, was communicated to him all at once, when he was caught up
into the third Heaven, whereby he was filled with a larger measure of the
Spirit than the rest of the Apostles: As appears both by his abundant Labors,
his abundant Sufferings, and his abundant Writings. (1.) His Labors were more
abundant than the rest, 1 Cor. 15.10. I labored more abundantly than they all,
2 Cor. 11.23. In labors more abundant: Now Operari sequitur esse. More Labor
shows more Power. (2.) His Sufferings also were more abundant; of which he
gives us a large Catalogue and Inventory, 2 Cor. 11-23-27. (3.) His Writings,
and share in the Canon of the New Testament, is far more than of any of the
other Apostles. From all which we may fairly conclude, That he has a more
abundant Glory than the rest. For when Peter said unto Christ, Behold, we have
forsaken all, and followed thee: What shall we have? Christ thereupon replies,
Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me in the regeneration, when
the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory; ye also shall sit on
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel: And every one that has
forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and
inherit everlasting life, Matthew. 19.27-29. And again, When the Sons of Zebedee
desired to sit, one on his right hand, and the other on his left in his
Kingdom. Christ asks 'em, Whether they could drink of his cup, and be baptized
with his baptism? Mark 10.37, 38. implying, That the greatest Sufferers shall
be the greatest Gainers, and be most highly advanced in his Kingdom. Hence
then, I say, we may conclude, That since Paul's Sufferings (as well as his
Labors and Writings) were the greatest, That he shall not only sit on a
particular Throne, but on the highest Throne of all the Apostles, (and they
were above all the Tribes,) and that he shall have the highest degree in the
University of Heaven, as he was the highest Scholar in Christ's School on
Earth. But this by the Bye.

. 25. 4. The Holy Ghost assisted the Penmen of Scripture by strengthening and
refreshing their Memories, to recollect and recall whatsoever they had seen or
heard before, which He saw fit to be inserted into their Writings. This kind of
Assistance was afforded chiefly in relation to the Historical Parts of
Scripture, wherein Matters of fact, which they had been Eye, or Ear-witnesses
of, are recorded. And this was expressly promised by Christ, John 14.26. The
Comforter shall come -- who shall teach you all things, and bring all things to
your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you: and accordingly it was made
good unto 'em, as we see in the Writings of the Evangelists, which contain a
Narrative of the Birth, Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Death,
Resurrection and Ascension of Christ in an harmonious Discord.

This was necessary for the Writers of all the Historical Parts of Scripture,
that they might not be guilty of any omission, or the least mistake, which
would have defaced and fullied the Beauty of the whole, Eccl. 10.1.

. 26. 5. He assisted 'em by Directing 'em, among a Multitude of Matters of
Fact, what to Omit, and what to Commit to Writing; and to make Choice of such
particulars, as he in his infinite Wisdom saw fit to be left upon Record, for
the use of succeeding Generations. This is plain by those passages, John 20.30,
31. Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his Disciples, which
are not written in this book: but these things are written that you might
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might
have life through his Name: and 21. 25. There are also many other things which
Jesus did; the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even
the World it self could not contain the books that should be written. Now which
of these were to be written, and which to be left unwritten; what might be of
use, and what not, it was impossible for any humane Understanding to comprehend
and determine; and therefore must be the work of the Holy Ghost. In general,
All things were written for our Learning, Romans 15.4. and Admonition, 1 Cor.
10.-11. and particularly, either as Sea-marks by way of Caution, to warn us to
shun those Rocks and Shelves which others had split upon, 1 Cor. 10.6-10: or as
Landmarks, to show us how to steer our Course, that we may arrive safe in the
Harbor of true Happiness, Romans 15.-4. That we through patience and comfort of
the Scriptures might have hope: or by way of Encouragement, to quicken us to
the Performance of those Duties, or Exercise of those Graces, wherein the
People of God in former times have been Eminent. Romans 4.23, 24. Now it was not
written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him; but for us also to whom
it shall be imputed, if we believe on him, etc. No humane Understanding could
judge of these things; what was fit and useful, and what not; so that herein
the Direction and Conduct of the Holy Ghost was absolutely necessary.

And herein, among other particulars, his Wisdom was admirable in directing
Moses, in that compendious History of things written by him, to record the
Artifice of Jacob concerning the Sheep, Genesis 30. which may seem at first view
to be beneath the Majesty of the Holy Ghost, and Gravity of an inspired Writer:
But if it be well considered, we may find that Excellent use may be made of it,
to teach us how that the Providence of God is exercised over his Church and
People (which was then confined within the bounds of Jacob's Family for the
most part) for their Preservation and Provision; and also, To warrant the use
of natural means (such as that was, at least in part) in the pursuit of lawful
Ends.

And this Direction of the Holy Ghost was necessary to prevent stuffing their
Writings with frivolous, and impertinent Stories, fabulous Legends, and Jewish
Fables, wherewith their Talmud, and some of their Targums, and their Midrashim
do abound: which therefore the Apostle cautions against, 1. Tim. 1.4. and 4.7.
Tit. 1.14.

. 27. 6. The Holy Ghost assisted the Penmen of Scripture, by exciting and
calling forth those Idea's and Images of things which were treasured up in
their Memories.

As it sometimes comes to pass in Prayer and Preaching, the Holy Ghost brings
into the Mind such passages of Scripture, and other matters as are pertinent
and suitable to the occasion; though not with that Power, Evidence, and
Infallibility which attended the divinely-inspired Writers, but in a lower way;
yet however it is something of the same kind and nature.

Hereby, though he did not suggest any new Matter, or Notion to 'em, which they
knew not before; yet he brought such things into their Minds, as by his
infinite Wisdom he saw meet to be made use of, to other ends and purposes than
the Penmen were aware of, viz. for the Relief of the People of God upon all
occasions, in all their Doubts, Fears, and Troubles; and for Direction in all
the Occurrences of life: hence proceed those Multitudes of Directions about
particular Duties in Paul's Epistles.

All that Stock of habitual Knowledge, of what sort soever, whether Natural,
Acquired, or Infused, wherewith they were furnished before, was hereby educed,
and reduced into Act, so far forth as was needful for the general Design of the
Scripture, and there was occasion for it. What they knew before, whether by the
Light of Nature, Study, Conversation, or divine Revelation, was all Materials
for the Spirit to work upon, or with, in this way. As a Carpenter, when he
builds a House, chooses out such Timber, Stones, and other Materials, as are
fit for his work, and lets the other alone: or, As a Physician chooses out of
the Apothecary's Shop such Drugs and Medicines as are proper and suitable to
his purpose, so did the Holy Ghost. We need not say that the Spirit did teach,
or infuse into 'em (whisper in their Ears, as La Mothe expresses it) any thing
which they knew before, but only called forth, proposed and represented to
their Minds such of those things which he found there, and would have made use
of.

Hence it came to pass that Paul, the most learned of the Apostles, makes such
use of his Learning in his Writings, which is not to be found in the Writings
of any other of the Apostles: As when he quotes some Sayings of the Heathen
Poets: Of Aratus, in his discourse to the Learned Athenians, Acts 17.-28.
(...). Of Menander, 1 Cor. 15.33. (...). Of Epimenides, Tit. 1.12. (...). The
Spirit of God could have infused such Notions into the other Apostles (as he
enabled 'em to speak with Tongues which they never learned) by infusing the
Idea's of all those Languages into their Minds) but he made use only of such
things as he found in 'em (as to this particular.)

And herein, I take it, does chiefly consist the Assistance and Influence of
the Holy Ghost in the Indictment of the greatest part of Scripture. All the
Historical, Dogmatical, Doctrinal, and Practical Parts of Scripture owe their
Original to this Work of the Holy Ghost: his calling forth such and such
Matter, and Words, as should be fit for the Edification and Instruction of the
People of God in all generations. And hence it follows,

. 28. 7. The Holy Ghost assisted the Penmen of Scripture by immediate
suggesting and dictating to 'em, and imprinting on their Minds all such things
as were matters of pure Revelation: i. e. That could not be known by 'em no
otherwise than by Revelation: as, All things Past, of which there was neither
Tradition nor Record. Such things Present, as either they had never heard of,
or were without the reach of Man's Knowledge: as the Thoughts, Desires,
Purposes, Inclinations, and Sincerity of the Heart, which are often declared in
Scripture. And likewise things to Come, the Foretelling whereof God challenges
to himself as his peculiar Prerogative, Esa. 46.9, 10. and 41. 22, 23. and
45.21.

And here come in, under this Head of Assistance, all the Prophecies, Promises,
Threatenings which lie scattered up and down throughout the whole Book of God.
These are granted by all (except absolute Antiscripurists) to be of divine
Inspiration in the strictest and most proper sense, and the immediate Dictates
of the Holy Ghost.

. 29. 8. Besides the particular Scope of each Book, and the Penmen thereof,
the Spirit of God had moreover a general and transcendent Super-intendency and
Inspection reaching over the whole; viz. To make it a complete, perfect Canon
and Rule both of Faith and Life; containing all the Credenda, Agenda, Petenda,
and Speranda, that so the Man of God might be perfect, thoroughly furnished to
every good work. This was that which could never come within the Compass of any
particular Writer's aim, but was the Work of the Spirit in the whole: That
every one should write what, and so much as the Spirit saw fit: Every one
should cast in his (...), his Morsel or Share (as it is said of the Apostles in
the Creed,) so that all together it might be a perfect Revelation of the Will
of God for the Use of the Church, the Body of Christ: That it should contain
all things necessary to Salvation, and whatsoever was profitable for Doctrine,
for Reproof, for Correction, and for Instruction in Righteousness, 2 Timothy 3.16,
17.

And thus much for the Sixth Proposition, showing the several Branches, or Ways
whereby the Holy Ghost assisted the Penmen of Scripture; from all which I may
well conclude in the last Place,

. 30. Prop. VII. The whole Scripture, both in respect of Matter and Words, is
of divine Inspiration. This seems to me to be a plain and natural Consequence
of the foregoing Discourse, That both Matter and Words were equally under the
Direction and Influence of the Holy Ghost: Both of 'em had an equal share in
his Inspiration in the ways forementioned. Such Words, as well as Matter, were
brought into their Minds, as the Holy Ghost thought fit. This is denied by La
Mothe, part 2. c. 1. though he grants something like it. C. 5.. 3. p. 120. where
he says, The Words and the Things depend upon one and the same sort of
Inspiration: both the one and the other proceed from the same Spring, and are
guided by the same Hand: They proceed equally from humane Faculties, and are
equally directed by the Spirit of God --. 31. The Apostle seems to speak
expressly to this point, concerning the Words, 1 Cor. 2.13. Which things also we
speak, not in the Words which man's Wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost
teaches. Now, if it were so with 'em in their Speaking, much more in their
Writing (if it be not all one, and he does not mean the same thing: concerning
which see above, Prop. I. n. 1.) because their Writing was of larger Extent
than their Preaching, viz. for the Use of the Church in all Ages. Many passages
also in the Scripture seem to look this way, and to imply as much. As, (1.)
Those general Words, 2 Timothy 3.16. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,
must certainly signify more than a bare Direction (such as La Mothe asserts, p.
121. He lets 'em alone when they go right; and when they are about to miscarry,
he brings 'em back again,) viz. an immediate Impulse in those ways that have
been mentioned. So when the sacred Penmen thereof are said to be (...), born
up, carried above and beyond themselves, to speak his Words, and what he
endited to 'em. Owen of Commun. p. 284. (2.) It appears also by those words of
David, 2 Samuel 23.2. The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and his Word was in my
Tongue. He does not say, He spoke by the Spirit, but the Spirit by him. The
Spirit was the Principal Agent, he but the Instrument. Whereas, If the Spirit
only directed him in what he wrote, then he was the Principal, and the Spirit
only the Subordinate. Mr. Pool's Note upon these Words is this: The following
Words, and consequently the other Words and Psalms, composed and uttered by me
upon the like solemn Occasions, are not to be looked upon as my private Fancies,
or humane Inventions, but both the Matter and Words of 'em are suggested and
governed by God's Spirit, which is the great Teacher of the Church. (3.) The
Places following seem also to speak thus much. Luke 1.70. He spoke by the mouth
of his holy Prophets. Acts 4.25. Who by the mouth of thy holy servant David
have said. Mark 12.36. David himself said by the Holy Ghost, and more expressly
Acts 1.16. -- Which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before: and 28.
25. Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the Prophet. Heb. 1.1. God spoke in the
Prophets: and 3.7. The Holy Ghost says, To day if you will hear his voice,
etc. What can be more express than these places? A bare Guidance and Direction
certainly will never comprehend the full Extent and Sense of these Expressions.
Sure God and the Holy Ghost cannot be said to speak in and by the Penmen,
except the very Words they spoke and wrote were more than their own.

. 32. And of this Judgment are many worthy Divines, and learned Men, whose
Testimonies I could produce: but I shall content my self with two Eminent ones;
the one a Protestant, the other a Papist. The former is the Industrious,
Judicious Pool, in his incomparable Annotations. These words, He keeps all his
bones, etc. though here spoken of righteous Men in general, of whom they are true
in a Metaphorical sense; yet they have a further meaning in 'em, being dictated
by the Spirit of God, (which dictated to David not only the Matter, but very
Words and Expressions) to signify a great Mystery, That none of Christ's bones
should be broken. Pool on Psalm. 34.20. The other is of Estius, an Excellent
Commentator, Recte igitur and verissime ex hoc loco statuitur omnem Scripturam
sacram and canonicam Spiritu sancto dictante esse conscriptam; ita nimirum ut
non solum sententiae, sed and verba singula, and verborum ordo; ac tota
dispositio sit a Deo, tanquam per semetipsum loquente aut scribente. Est. in 2 Timothy 3.16. From this place (2 Timothy 3.16.) it is well and rightly gathered, that
all the Holy, Canonical Scripture, was written by the dictate of the Holy
Spirit; insomuch that not only the Sentences, but the very Words, and the Order
of the Words, and the whole disposal is from God, as if it were spoken or
written by Himself.

. 33. Now, from the foregoing Discourse, we may gather what was the peculiar
distinct Part and Share both of the Principal and Instrumental Causes of the
Scripture; (which was, That that I designed and aimed at at first to find out
and discover.) The Holy Ghost first set the Penmen of Scripture a work, and
moved 'em to write: He set 'em their Task, and appointed every one his Share,
and that according to their several Abilities: He furnished 'em with Matter for
their Work, by Enlightening their Minds to understand all their Work;
Strengthening their Memories to recall what was necessary; Directing 'em what
Matters to make choice of; Exciting and Calling forth into Act so much of what
they knew before, as was to be committed to Writing by 'em; Suggesting to 'em,
and Imprinting upon their Minds such things as they knew not, but were Matters
of pure Revelation; Providing that the whole should be a perfect Rule both of
Faith and Life. In these several Particulars, I conceive, with Submission, the
Inspiration, and Assistance of the Holy Ghost to the Penmen of Scripture did
consist. This was His Part.

Then for the Penmen themselves, their own Reason and Judgment did concur in
all they wrote: David's Heart indicted a good Matter, Psalm. 45.1. David himself
spoke, Mark 12.36. It seemed good to Luke to write, Luke 1.3. The Apostle spoke
generally in their own Persons. Hence the Work done is very properly ascribed
to both: To the Holy Ghost as the Principal Author and Efficient; to the Holy
Men of God, as Instruments employed by Him, and in Subordination to Him, to be
the immediate Authors of the Writings composed by them.

This is what I have to offer in this Point: wherein if there be any thing
found which may be useful, and shall approve it self to the godly judicious,
let God have the Glory; by whose Assistance alone this has been begun, carried
on, and brought to

Mar. 16.94/5.
THE END.
