A PROCLAMATION For the calling in all Moneys of Gold and Silver Coined or
Stamped with the Cross and Harp, and the Circumscription, The Commonwealth of
ENGLAND; and for making the same to be current only to the First of December
next, and no longer.
CHARLES R.

WHereas in the time of Our absence from this Our Kingdom of England, several
pieces of Gold and Silver were Stamped with new Motto's and Inscriptions, that
is to say, One Piece of Gold, supposed to be of the value of Twenty shillings
Sterling, to be called the Twenty shillings Piece, Stamped on the one side with
a Cross, and a Palm, and Laurel, with these words, (The Commonwealth of
England;) and on the other side with a Cross and Harp, with these words (God
with us;) One other Piece of Gold-money of Ten shillings, to be called the Ten
shillings Piece; and one other Piece of Gold-money of Five shillings, to be
called the Five shillings Piece, with the same Words, Inscriptions, Pictures,
and Arms on each side as the former. And for Silver-moneys, Pieces of Five
shillings, and Pieces of Two shillings six pence, and Pieces of Twelve pence,
and Pieces of Six pence, having the same Words, Inscriptions, Pictures, and
Arms on each side as the former; also Pieces of Two pence, and one penny,
having the same Pictures and Arms as the former, without any Words or
Inscriptions; and the halfpenny, having on the one side a Cross, and on the
other side a Harp. Which several Coyns of Gold and Silver were appointed by
the late Usurpers, to pass in all Receipts and Payments, as other lawful and
current Moneys used to do, and have accordingly been used in all Commerce and
Traffic ever since Our Return: Nevertheless, We cannot but take notice that
these Coyns were Stamped, not only without, but against Our Authority, and
were intended by the late Usurpers as a high Contempt of Us, Our Crown and
Dignity. And though We have hitherto forborne to restrain the use of these
Moneys, as being unwilling to make too sudden an alteration in the Common
Traffic and intercourse between Our Subjects; Yet having found by experience,
that this Our indulgence has proved the unhappy occasion of very great
mischief to Our People in general, whilst evil-disposed persons have taken a
liberty to Counterfeit, Wash, Clip, and File, as many of this Coin as they
thought fit* and do still continue such their practices, hoping thereby to
escape the penalties of Our Laws until these Moneys shall be made Legal and
Current Money by Our Proclamation. We have therefore thought fit, and do hereby
publish and declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That all such Pieces of Gold
and Silver as have been Coined since the year One thousand six hundred forty
eight, with the Stamps, Motto's, and Inscriptions aforesaid, and are of the
like Standart and Allay with the rest of the Current Moneys of this Our Realm,
shall from henceforth, and until the last day of November now next ensuing, be
received and used in all Payments as lawful Money of England, and so are hereby
made and declared to be according to their several and respective Rates and
Ualues, for which they were Coined: And that if any person or persons shall
hereafter presume to Wash, Clip, File, Counterfeit, or otherwise abuse any
Coyns having the Stamps and Impressions aforesaid, That then all and every such
offenders shall be proceeded against according to the Laws and Statutes of Our
Realm, made against such persons as Counterfeit, Wash, Clip, File, or otherwise
abuse the lawful and current Moneys of Our Realm, and shall suffer pains of
death, and incur such other Forfeitures and Penalties as use to be inflicted in
like cases. And that Our Subjects may not continue long under the daily hazard
of receiving false and adulterate Moneys, which are more frequently and usually
to be found in the Coyns of the Stamps and Impressions aforesaid; We do further
publish and declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That from and after the last
day of November, now next ensuing, no Moneys whatsoever, either of Gold or
Silver, having the Stamps and Impressions aforesaid, shall at any time be
received, allowed, or taken as current Money, nor shall the same be used in any
Receipts or Payments whatsoever, but shall from thenceforth cease to be lawful
Money of England, to all intents and purposes whatsoever. Nevertheless, that
such of Our Subjects in whose hands these Moneys shall be found, after the last
day of November next ensuing, may not suffer too great damage or prejudice
thereby, We are pleased further to declare, That all and every person and
persons who shall bring any Gold or Silver Coin of the Stamps and Impressions
aforesaid, into Our Mint in the Tower of London, shall there receive the like
quantity of lawful and current Moneys, weight for weight, allowing only for
the Coynage.

Given at Our Court at Whitehal, the Seventh day of September, 1661. in the
Thirteenth year of Our Reign. God save the KING.
