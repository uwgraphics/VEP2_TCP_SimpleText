A PROCLAMATION For removing the Receipt of His Majesty's Exchequer from
Westminster to Nonsuch.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty taking into His Princely Consideration the
great and dangerous increase of the Plague in and about the City of
Westminster, where His Majesty's Receipt of Exchequer has been hitherto kept;
and willing, as much as is possible, to prevent the further danger which might
ensue as well to His own Officers, which are necessarily to attend the same
Receipt, as to other His loving Subjects, who shall have occasion either for
Receipt or Payment of Moneys to repair thither; Has therefore taken Order for
the present Remove of the Receipt of His said Exchequer, together with the
Tally-Office, and all things thereunto belonging, from thence to His Majesty's
Honor of Nonsuch in the County of Surrey: And has thought fit by this His
Proclamation to Publish, That the same shall be there opened on the Fifteenth
day of August next, to the end that all persons whom the same may concern, may
take notice whither to repair upon all occasions, concerning the bringing in,
or issuing out of His Majesty's Treasure at the Receipt of His Exchequer.
Willing and requiring all Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Collectors, and all other
Officers, Accomptants, and persons whatsoever, who are to pay in any Moneys
into the said Receipt of His Majesty's Exchequer, or otherwise to attend the
same, to keep their days and times at Nonsuch aforesaid, and there to do, pay,
and perform in all things, as they should, or ought to have done at
Westminster, if the said Receipt of Exchequer had continued there. And this to
be done and observed until His Majesty shall publish and delare His further
Pleasure to the contrary.

Given at Our Court at Hampton Court, the Six and twentieth day of July, 1665.
in the Seventeenth year of Our Reign.
