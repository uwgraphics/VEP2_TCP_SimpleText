His Majesty's Message sent to both Houses of Parliament. January 20. 1641.
HIs Majesty perceiving the manifold distractions which are now in this
Kingdom, which cannot but bring great inconvenience and mischiefs to this whole
Government; In which as His Majesty is most chiefly interessed, so He holds
Himself by many Reasons, most obliged to do what in Him lies, for the
preventing thereof; Though He might justly expect (as most proper for the duty
of Subjects) that Propositions for the Remedies of these Evils, ought rather to
come to Him then from Him; Yet His fatherly care of all His people being such,
that He will rather lay by any particular respect of His own Dignity, then that
any time should be lost for prevention on of these threatening Evils, which
cannot admit the delays of the ordinary proceedings in Parliament; does think
fit to make this ensuing Proposition to both Houses of Parliament:

That they will with all speed fall into a serious consideration of all those
particulars, which they shall hold necessary, as well for the upholding and
maintaining of His Majesty's ^ust and Regal Authority, and for the settling of
His Revenue; As for the present and fu^e establishment of their Privileges;
The free and quiet enjoying of their Estates and fortunes; The Liberties of
their Persons; The security of the true Religion now professed in the Church of
England; And the settling of Ceremonies, in such a manner as may take away all
just offense. Which when they shall have digested, and composed into one entire
body, that so His Majesty and themselves may be able to make the more clear
Judgment of them; it shall then appear by what His Majesty shall do, how far
He has been from intending or designing any of those things, which the too
great Fears and Iealousies of some Persons seem to apprehend; And how ready He
will be to equal and exceed the greatest Examples of the most indulgent
Princes in their Acts of Grace and Favor to their People. So that if all the
present Distractions (which so apparently threaten the ruin of this Kingdom)
do not (by the blessing of Almighty God) end in an happy and blessed
Accommodation; His Majesty will then be ready to call Heaven and Earth, God
and Man to witness, that if has not failed on His part.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1642.
