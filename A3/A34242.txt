THE CONFESSION OF FAITH First agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at
Westminster. And now appointed by the General assembly of the Kirk of of
Scotland to be a part of Uniformity in Religion, between the Kirks of Christ in
the three Kingdoms.
CHAP. I. Of the holy Scripture.
ALthough the light of Nature, and the works of Creation and Providence, do so
far manifest the Goodness, Wisdom, and Power of God, as to leave men
unexcusable Romans 2.14.15. Romans 1.19.20, Psalm. 19.1, 2, 3. Romans 1.32.
; yet they are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and of his Will,
which is necessary un^o salvation 1 Cor. 1.11. and 2.14.15.
. Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in diverse manners, to
reveal himself, and to declare that his Will unto his Church Heb. 1.1.
; and afterward for the better preserving, and propagating of the Truth, and
for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the
corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the World; to commit
the same wholly unto writing Pro. 22^ 19, 20, 21. Luk 1.3, 4. Rom 15.4. Mat.
4.4, ^, 10. Isa 8.19, 20
; which makes the holy Scripture to be most necessary 2 Timothy 3.15.
; those former ways of Gods revealing his will unto his People, being now
ceased Heb. 1.1, 2. 2 Pet. 1.19.
.

II. Under the Name of Holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now
contained all the Books of the Old and new Testament, which are these.

Of the Old Testament.
GEnesis. Exodus. Leviticus. Numbers. Deuteronomie. Joshua. Judges. Ruth. I.
Samuel. II. Samuel. I. Kings. II. Kings. I. Chronicles. II. Chronicles. Ezra.
Nehemiah. Esther. Job. Psalms. Proverbs. Ecclesiastes. The Song of Songs
Isajah. Jeremiah. Lamentations. Ezekiel. Daniel. Hosea. Joel. Amos. Obadiah.
Jonah. Micah. Nahum. Habakkuk. Zephaniah. Haggai. Zechariah. Malachi.
Of the New Testament.
The Gospel according to MAtthew. The Gospel according to Mark. The Gospel
according to Luke. The Gospel according to John. The Acts of the Apostles. Paul
's Epistle to the Romans. I. Corinthians. II. Corinthians. Galatians.
Ephesians. Philippians. Colossians. I. Thessalonians. II. Thessalonians. To
Timothy. I. To Timothy. II. To Titus. To Philemon. The Epistle to the Hebrews.
The Epistle of James. The first and second Epistle of Peter. The first, second
and third Epistles of John. The Epistle of Jude. The Revelations.
All which are given by inspiration of God, to be the Rule of Faith and life
Luke 16.29.31. Ephesians. 3.20. Rev. 22.18.19. 2 Timothy 3.16.
.

III. The Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of Divine inspiration, are
no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore are of no Authority in the
Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other
humane writings Luke 24.27, 44. Romans 3.2. 2 Pet. 1.21.
.

IV. The Authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and
obeyed; depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon
God (who is Truth it self) the Author thereof; and therefore it is to be
received, because it is the Word of God. 2 Pet. 1.19 21. 2 Timothy 3.16. 1 Ioh.
5.9. 1 These. 2.13.
.

V. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church, to an high and
reverend esteem of the holy Scripture 1 Timothy 3.15.
. And the heavenliness of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the Majesty
of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is,
to give all glory to God,) the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's
salvation, the many other incomparable Excellencies, and the entire perfection
thereof, are Arguments whereby it does abundantly evidence it self to be the
Word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the
infallible truth, and Divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the
holy Spirit, bearing witness by, and with the Word in our hearts Ioh. 2.20, 27.
Ioh. 16.13 14* 1 Cor. 2.10.11, 12* Isa. 59.21.
.

VI. The whole Counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own
Glory, man's Salvation, Faith, and life, is either expr^sly set down in
Scripture, or by good and necessary conseq^ence may be deduc^d from Scripture:
un^o which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelation of the
spirit, or traditions of men 2 Timothy 3.15, 16, 17. Gal. 1.8, 9. 2 These. 2.2.
. Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to
be necessary, for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in
the word Ioh. 6.45. 1 Cor. 2.9, 10, 11, 12.
: and that there are some circumstances concerning the Worship of God, and
Government of the Church, c^mmon to humane Actions and Societies, which are to
be ordered by the light of Nature, and Christian ^rudence, according to the
general Rules of the Word which are always to be observed 1 Cor. 11.13, 14. 1
Cor. 14.26, 40.
.

VII. All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike
clear unto all 2 Pet. 3.6.
: yet those things which are necessary to be known believed, and observed for
salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some places of Scripture or
other, that not only the Learned but the Unlearned, in a due use of the
ordinary means may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them Ps. 119.103,
130.
.

VIII. The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the Native Language of the people
of God of Old) and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing
of it, was most generally known to the Nations) being immediately inspired by
God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are
therefore Authentical Mat. 5.1^
, so as in all controversies of Religion, the Church is finally to appeal unto
them Isa. 8.10. Act. 15.15. Ioh. 5.39.46.
. But because these Original Tongues are not known to the People of God, who
have right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear
of God, to read and search them Ioh. 5.39.
, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar Language of every Nation
unto which they come 1 Cor. 14.6, 9, 11, 12, 24, 27, 28.
, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an
acceptable manner Col. 3.16
, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope To. 15.4.
.

IX. The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, is the Scripture it
self and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of
any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it must be searched and known by
other places that speak more clearly 2 Pet. 1.20, 21. Act. 19.15.19.
.

X The Supreme Judge, by which all Controversies of Religion are to be
determined, and all decrees of Councils, Opinions of Ancient Writers, Doctrines
of men, and private Spirits, are to be examined; and in whose sentence we are
to rest, can be no other but the holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture Mat.
22.29.31. Ephesians. 2.10. Act. 28.25.
.

CHAP. II. Of God, and of the Holy Trinity.
THere is but one only Deuteronomy. 6.4. 1 Cor. 8.4, 6.

, and withal, ^ost just and terrible in his judgments Neh. 9.32.
; hating all sin Ps. 5.5, 6.
, and who will by (...) means clear the guilty N^h. 1.2.
.

II. God has all life Job. 5.26.
, glory Act. 7.2.
, goodness Ps 119.68.
, blessedness 1 Timothy 6.15
, in, and of himself, and is alone in and unto himself all-sufficient, not
^^anding in need of any creatures which he has made Act. 17.24, 25.
, nor deriving any glory from them I^^. 27.2.
, but only ma^ifesting his own glory, in, by, unto, and upon them: He is the
alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things
Romans 11.6.
, and has most Sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon
them, whatsoever himself pleases (...). 4.11. Dan. 4.25.
. In his sight all things are open and manifest Heb. 4.13.
, his knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the Creature Romans
11.33, 34. Psalm. 147.5
, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain Act. 14.18 Ezekiel. 11.5.
. He is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his
commands Ps. 145.17. Romans 7.12.
. To him is due from Angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever
worship, service, or obedience he is pleased to require of them Rev. 5.12, 13,
14.
.

III. In the Unity of the Godhead, there be three persons, of one substance,
power and eternity* God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost 1 Ioh.
5.7. Mat. 3.16, 17. Mat. 28.61 2 Cor. 13.4.
. The Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding: The Son is eternally
begotten of the Father Joh. 1.14, 15.
: the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son Joh. 15.26.
Gal. 4.6.
.

CHAP. III. Of Gods Eternal Decree.
GOD from all eternity did, by the most wise and holy Counsel of his own will,
freely, and unchangeably o^dain whatsoever comes to pass Ephesians. 1.1. Rom 11.33
Heb. 6.17 To 9 15.18.
; yet so, as thereby, neither is God the Author of sin Ia^. 1.13 17. ^ Job. 1.1.
, nor is violence offered to the will of the Creatures, nor is the liberty or
contingency of second Causes taken away, but rather established Act. 2.24. Mat.
17.12 Act. 4.27. Ioh. 19.11. Pro. 16.33.
.

II. Although God knows whatsoever may, or can come to pass upon all supposed
conditions Act. 15.18. Mat. 11.12 24.
, yet has he not decreed any thing, because he foresaw it as future, or as
that which would come to pass upon such conditions Romans 9.11, 13, 16, 18.
.

By the decree of God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and Angels
1 Timothy 5.21. Mat. 25.41
, are predestined unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to
everlasting death Rom 9.22, 23. Ephesians. 1.5, 6. Pro. 16.4.
.

IV. These Angels and men, thus predestined and foreordained, are
particularly, and unchangeably designed, and their number is so certain and
definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished 2 Timothy 2.19.
.

V. Those of mankind, that are predestined unto Life, God, before the
foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and immutable
purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his Will, has chosen in
Christ unto everlasting glory Ephesians. 1.4. Romans 8.30. 2 Timothy 1.9. 1 These. 5.9.
, out of his mere free grace, and love without any foresight of Faith, or good
works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature as
conditions or causes moving him thereunto To. 9.11.
, and all to the Praise of his glorious grace Ephesians. 1.4. Ephesians. 1.6.
.

VI. As God has appointed the Elect unto Glory, so has he by the eternal and
most free purpose of his Will, fore ordained all the means thereunto 1 Pet 1.2.
Ephesians. 1.4, 5. Ephesians. 2.10. 2 These. 2.13.
. Wherefore they who are Elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ 1
These. 5.9, 10. Tit. 2.14.
, are effectually called unto faith in Christ, by his Spirit working in due
season, are justified, adopted, sanctified Romans 8.10. Ephesians. 1.5. 2 These 5.18
, and kept by his power through faith unto salvation 1 Pet. 1.5.
. Neither any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted,
sanctified and saved, but the Elect only Ioh. 17.9. Romans 8.28. to the end.
Ioh. 10.26. Ioh. 8.47. ^ Ioh. 2.19.
.

VII. The rest of mankind God was pleased, according to the unsearchable
counsel of his own Will, whereby he extends, or withholdeth mercy as he
pleases, for the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by,
and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath, for their sin, to the praise of his
glorious justice Mat. 11.25, 26. Romans 9.12. ^ ^im. 2.19. 1 Pet. 2.8.
.

VIII. The Doctrine of this high Mystery of Predestination is to be handled
with special prudence and care To. 9.22. To. 11.35. Deu. 29.29.
, that men attending the will of God revealed in his Word, and yielding
obed^ence thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual Vocation, be
assured of their eternal Election 2 Pet 1.10
. So shall this Doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence and admiration of
God Ephesians. 1.6.
, and of humility, diligence and abundant consolation to all that sincerely
obey the Gospel To. 11.5, 6, 20. 2 Pet. 1.10. Romans 8.33. Luke 10.20
.

CHAP. IV. Of Creation.
IT pleased God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost Heb. 1.2. Ioh. 1.1, 2. Genesis 1.2.
Job. 26.13.
, for the manifestation of the glory of his eternal Power, Wisdom and Goodness
To. 1.20. Ier. 10.12. Ps. 33.5, 6.
, in the beginning to create, or make of nothing the World, and all things
therein, whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days and all very
good Genesis 1. Cap Heb. 11.5. Col. 1.16. Act. 17.2.
.

II. After God had made all other creatures, he created Man, male and female
Genesis 1.27.
, with reasonable and immortal souls Genesis 2.7. Luke 23.24 Mat. 10.28
, endued with knowledge, righteousness and tr^e holiness; after his own Image
Genesis 1.^6. Col. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.
, having the Law of God written in their hearts Romans 2.14, 15.
, and power to fulfill it Eccl. 7.29.
, and yet under a possibility of transgressing, being le^t to the liberty of
their own will, which was subject unto change Genesis 3.6. Eccl. 7.23.
. Beside this Law written in their hearts, they received a command, not to eat
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which whiles they kept, they
were happy in their Communion with God Genesis 2.12. and 2.8, 9, 10, 11, 23.
, and had Dominion over the creatures Genesis 1.26, 28.
.

CHHP. V. Of Providence.
GOD the great Creator of all things, does uphold Heb. 1.3.
, direct, dispose, and govern all creatures, acttions, and things Dan. 4.34.
Ps. 135.6. Act 17 25.26, 28.
, from the greatest even to the least Mat. 10.29, 30, 31.
, by his most wise and holy Providence Pro. 15.3
, according to his infallible foreknowledge Act. 15.18
, and the free and immutable counsel of his own Will Ephesians. 1.11. Psalm. 33.10.11.
, to the praise of the glory of his Wisdom, Power, Justice, Goodness, and Mercy.

II. Although in Relation to the foreknowledge and decree of God, Isa. 63.14.
Ephesians 3.10. Romans 9.17. Genesis 45.7. Psa. 14 5.7.
the first cause, all things come to pass immutably, and infallibly Act. 2.23.
, yet, by the same Providence he orders them to fall out according to the
nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely or contingently Genesis 8.22.
Ier. 11.35. Ex. 22.13. with Deuteronomy. 19.5. Isa. 10.6, 7.
.

III. God in his ordinary Providence makes use of means Act. 27.3. Isa. 55.10.
: yet is free to work without Hos. 1.7. Mat. 4.4.
, above Romans 4.19, 20, 21.
, and against them at his pleasure 1 Kin. 6.6. Dan. 3.26.
. IV. The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom; and infinite goodness of God so
far manifest themselves in his Providence, that it extends it self even to
the first fall, and all other sins of Angels and men Romans 11.31, 33, 34. 2 Samuel
24.1. 1 Chr. 10.4, 13, 14. 2 Samuel 19.10. Act. 2.23.
, and that not by a bare permission Act. 14.16.
, but such as has joined with it a most wise and powerful bounding Ps. 76.10.
2 Ki. 19.28
, and otherwise ordering and governing of them, in a manifold dispensation, to
his own holy ends Genesis 50.20 Isa. 10, 6.7.
: yet so, as the sinfulness thereof proceeds only from the creature, and not
from God who being most holy and righteous, neither is, nor can be the Author
or Approver of sin Iam. 1.13 14, 17. 1 Ioh* 2.16. Psalm. 50, 21
.

V. The most wise, righteous and gracious God does often times leave for a
season his own children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their
own hearts to chastise them for their former sins, or to discover unto them the
hidden strength of corruption, and deceitfulness of their hearts, that they may
be humbled 2 Cor. 12.25, 26, 31. 2 Samuel 24.
, and to raise them to a more close and constant dependence for their support
upon himself, and to make them more watchful against all future occasions of
sin, and for sundry other just and holy ends 1 Cor. 12.7, 8, 9. Psalm. 73.
throughout. Psalm. 77.1. to 12.
.

VI. As for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God as a righteous Judge for
former sins does blind and harden Romans 1.24, 26, 28. To. 11.7, 8.
, from them he not only witholdeth his grace, whereby they might have been
enlightened in their understandings, and wrought upon in their hearts Deu. ^9.4.
, but sometimes also withdraws the gifts which they had Mat. 13.12.
, and exposes them to such objects as their corruption makes occasion of sin
Deu. 2.30. 2 Reg. 8.12.
; and withal, gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the World,
and the power of Satan Ps. 81.11.12. 2 These. 2.10, 11, 12.
, whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves even under those means
which God uses for the softning of others Exodus 7.3. 2 Cor. 2.15. Isa. 8.14. 1
Pet. 2.7.8 Isa. 6.9, 14.
.

VII. As the providence of God does in general reach to all creatures; so after
a special manner it takes care of his Church, and disposes all things to the
good thereof 1 Timothy 4.10. Romans 8.28. Isa. 34.24.
.

CHAP. VI. Of the fall of Man, of Sin, and of the punishment thereof.
OUr first parents being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan,
sinned in eating the forbidden fruit Genesis 3.13. 2 Cor. 2.3.
. This their sin, God was pleased according to his wise and holy counsel, to
permit, having purposed to order it to's own glory To. 11.3.


II. By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion with
God Gen 3, 6, 7
, and so became dead in sin Genesis 2.17.
, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of soul and body Tit. 1.15.
.

III. They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed
Genesis 1.17. Act. 17.16. Romans 3.12, 15, 16, 17.
, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature, conveyed to all their
posterity descending from them by ordinary generation Ps. 51.5. Genesis 5.3. Job.
14.4.
.

IV. From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed,
disabled, and made opposite to all good Romans 5.6. Romans 8.7. Col. 1.21.
, and wholly inclined to all evil Genesis 6.5. Genesis 8.21. Romans 3.10.11, 12.
, do proceed all actual transgressions Iam. 1.14, 15. Ep. 2.2, 3. Mat. 15.19.
.

V. This corruption of nature during this life, does remain in those that are
regenerated 1 Ioh. 1.8. Iam. 3.2. Prove. 20.9. Eccl. 7.20.
, and although it be, Through Christ, pardoned and mortified, yet both it self,
and all the motions thereof are truly and properly sin Romans 7.5, 7, 8, 25. Gal.
5.17.
.

VI. Every s^n, both original and Actual, being a transgression of the
righteous Law of God, and contrary thereunto 1 Ioh 3.4.
, does in its own nature, bring guilt upon the sinner To, 2.15. and 3.9, 19.
, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God Ephesians 2 3
, and curse of the Law Gal. 3.1.
, and so made subject to death Romans 6*13.
, with all miseries spiritual Ephesians. 4.16.
, temporal Rom 8.20. Lam. 3.39.
, and eternal Ma. 25.41 2 These. 1.9.
.

CHAP. VII. Of Gods Covenant with man.
THe distance between God and the creature is so great, that although
reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their creator yet they could
never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some
voluntary condescension on Gods part, which he has been pleased to express by
way of Covenant Isa. 40.13.14, 15, 16, 17. Job. 9.32. 1 Samuel 2.25 Ps. 100.2, 3.
Job. 22.2, 3 Luke 17.10 Act. 17.24, 25.
.

II. The first Covenant made with Man, was a covenant of Works Gal. 3.12.
, wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity Romans 10.5. Rom
5.12. to 20.
, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3.4. Heb.
11.13. Ioh. 8.56 l
.

III. Man by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant,
the Lord was pleased to make a Second Gal. 3.7, 8, 9, 14.
, commonly called the Covenant of Grace: Wherein he freely offers unto
sinners, Life, and Salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him
that they may be saved Col. 2.17.
, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto Life, his holy
Spirit, to make them willing and able to believe Mat. 28.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23
24, 25.
.

IV. This Covenant of Grace is frequently set forth in the Scripture by the
Name of a Testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator,
Heb. 12.22. to 28. Ier. 31.33.
and to the everlasting Inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein
bequeathed Mat. 28.29. Ephesians. 2.15.16, 17, 18,
.

V. This Covenant was differently administered in the time of the Law, and in
the time of the Gospel Lu. 12.10.
. Under the Law, it was administered by Promises, Prophecies, Sacrifices,
Circumcision, the Paschal Lamb, and other Types and Ordinances delivered to the
people of the Jews, all fore-signifying Christ to come Oal. 3.14. Act. 5.1.
Rom' 3.2, 1.23, 28, 30. Psalm. 31.1. Heb. 13*8.
* which were for that time sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of
the spirit to instruct and build up the Elect in Faith in the promised Messiah
1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4. Heb. 11.13. Ioh. 8.56.
, by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal Salvation; and is
called, the Old Testament Gal. 3.7.8, 9, 14.
.

VI. Under the Gospel, when Christ the substance Col. 2.17.
, was exhibited, the Ordinances in which this Covenant is dispensed, are the
preaching of the Word, and the administration of the Sacrament of Baptism, and
the Lords Supper Mat. 28.19.20. 1 Cor. 11.23.24.25.
. Which though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity, and less
outward glory, yet, in them it is held forth in more fullness, evidence and
spiritual efficacy Heb. 12.22. to 28. Ier. 31.33.
, to all Nations both Jews and Gentiles Mat. 28.19. Ephesians. 2.15, 16, 17, 18.
; and is called the New Testament Lu. 12.10.
. There are not therefore two Covenants of Grace, differing in substance, but
one and the same, under various dispensations Gal. 3.14. Act. 5.1. Romans 3.21,
23, 28, 30. Psalm. 31.1. Heb. 12.8.
.

CHAP. VIII. Of Christ the Mediator.
IT pleased God, in his eternal purpose to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his
only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and Man Isa. 42.1. 1 Pet.
1.19. Joh. 3.16. 1 Timothy 2.5.
, the Prophet Act. 3.22.
, Priest Heb. 5.5.
, and King Ps. 2.6. Luke 1.33.
, the Head, and Savior of his Church Ephesians. 5.13.
, the heir of all things Heb. 1.2.
, and Judge of the World Act. 17.1.
: Unto whom he did from all eternity give a people to be his seed Ioh. 17.6.
Ps. 21.30. Isa. 53.10.
, and to be by him in time Redeemed, Called, Justified, Sanctified and
Glorified 1 Timothy 2.6. Isa. 55.4, 5. 1 Cor. 1.30.
.

II. The Son of God, the second Person in the Trinity, being very and eternal
God, of one substance, and equal with the Father; did, when the fullness of time
was come, take upon him man's nature Ioh. 1.1. 1 John 5.20. Phil. 2.6.
, with all the essential properties, and common infirmities thereof, yet
without sin Heb. 2.14. and 4.15.
: being conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin
Mary, of her substance Luke 1.27.31, 35. Gal. 4.4.
. So that two whole Perfect and distinct Natures, the Godhead and the
Manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without Conversion,
Composition or Confusion Lu. 31.35. Romans 9.5. 1 Timothy 3.26.
. Which person is very God, and very Man, yet one Christ the only Mediator
between God and man To. 1.2, 4.
.

III. The Lord Jesus, in his humane nature, thus united to the divine, was
sanctified and anointed with the holy spirit above measure Isa. 42.1. 1 Pet.
1.19. Job. 3.16. 1 Timothy 2.5.
, having in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge Act. 3.22.
: in whom, it pleased the Father, that all fullness should dwell Heb. 5.5.
, to the end, that being holy, harmless, undefiled and full of grace and truth
Psalm. 2.6. Luke 1.33.
, he might be thoroughly furnished to execute the Office of a Mediator, and
Surety Ephesians. 5.13.
: which Office he took not unto himself, but was thereunto called ^y his Father
Heb. 1.2.
, who put all power and judgment into his hand, and gave him commandment to
execute the same Act. 17.1
.

IV. This Office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake Job. 17.6* Psalm.
21.30 Isa. 53.10.
, which that he might discharge, he was made under the Law 1 Timothy 2.6. Isa.
55.4.5, 1 Cor. 1.30.
, and did perfectly fulfill it Ioh. 1.1. 1 Ioh. 5, 20.
, endured most grievous torments immediately in his soul Pil. 2.6.
, and most painful sufferings in his body Heb 2.14. and 4.15.
; was crucified and died Luke 1.27 31, 35. Gac. 4.4.
: was buried, and remained under the power of death; yet saw no ^^^^uption Lu.
31, 35. Romans 9.5. 1 Timothy 3.26.
. On the third day h^ arose from the dead Romans 1.2, 4
, with the same ^^dy in which h^ (...), with which also he ascend^^ i^to
heaven, and th^re sits at the ^ight hand of his Father g, making (...) h,
and shall return to judge m^n, and Angels at the end of the World Romans 14.^
Act. 1.11 Mat. 13.40 Jude v. 6. 2 Pet. 2.4*
.

V. The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience, and sacrifice of himself, which
he, through the eternal spirit once offered up to God, has fully satisfied the
Justice of his Father Romans 5.19 Heb 10.14* Ephesians. 5.2. Romans 3.25.
, and purchased, not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the
Kingdom of Heaven, for all those whom the Father has given unto him Dan. 9 2^
26 Col. ^.19.20. Ioh. 17.2. Heb, 9.12* 13.
.

VI. Although the work of Redemption was not actually wrought by Christ till
after his Incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefits thereof were
communicated unto the elect in all ages successively from the beginning of the
World, in, and by those promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein he was
revealed, and signified to be the seed of the Woman, which should bruise the
Serpents head; and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World; being
yesterday and to day the same, and for ever Gal. 4, 4, 5. Genesis 3.15. Rev. 13.8.
.

VII. Christ, in the work of Mediation, acts according to both Natures, by
each Nature doing that which is proper to it self Heb. 9.14 1 Pet. 3.18*
, yet by reason of the unity of the Person, that which is proper to one nature*
is some times in Scripture attributed to the Person denominated by the other
Nature Act* 20.28 Jo^. 3 13. 1 Jo^. 3.16
.

VIII. To all those for whom Christ has purchased* redemption, he does
certainly, and effectually apply and communicate the same Jo^. 6.37.
, making intercession for them ^ Jo^. 2.1. Romans 8.14.
, and revealing unto them, in and by the word, the Mysteries of Salvation Jo^.
15.13 ^ph. 1.7, 8. Joh. 17.6.
, effectually persuading them by his spirit to believe, and obey, and governing
their hearts by his word and spirit Joh. 14.16. Heb. 12.2. 2 Cor. 4.3. ^o. 8.9,
14. and 15.18.19 ^oh. 17, 17.
, overcoming all their enemies by his Almighty Power and Wisdom in such manner,
and ways, as are most consonant to his wonderful and unsearchable dispensation
Ps. 110.1. ^ Cor. 15.15. Mal. 4.2, 3. Col. 2.15.
.

CHAP. IX. Of Free Will.
GOD has endued the Will of Man with that natural liberty that is neither
forced, nor by any absolute necessity of Nature determined to do good or evil
Mat. 17.12 Jam. 1.14. D^^t. 30.15
.

II. Man, in his state of innocence, had freedom and power, to will, and to do,
that which was good, and well-pleasing to God Ecol. 7.29 Genesis 1.26.
; but yet, mutably, so that he might fall from it Genesis 2.16. and 3.6.
.

III. Man by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all ability of Will
to any spiritual good accompanying salvation Romans 5.6. and 8.7. Joh. 15.5.
; so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that good Re. 3.10.11.
, and dead in sin Ephesians. 2 1.5. Col. 3.13.
, is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself
thereunto Joh. 6.44. 1 Cor. 2.14. Tit. 2.3.4.
.

IV. When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of grace; he
freeth him from his natural bondage under sin Col. 1.13. Jo^. 8.31.36.
; and by his grace, inables him freely to will and to do that which is
spiritually good Phil. 2.13. To. 6.18.22
yet so, as by reason of his remaining corruption, he does not perfectly nor
only will that which is good, but does also will that which is evil Gal. 5.17.
Romans 1.15.18, 19, 21.
.

V. The will of man is made per^ectly and immutably free to good alone in the
state of Glory only Ephesians. 4.12. Heb. 11.13. Jude v. 24.
.

CHAP. X. Of effectual calling.
ALL those whom God has predestined unto life, and those only he is pleased
in his appointed and accepted time, effectually to call To. 8.30. and 11.7.
Ephesians. 10.21.
, by his word and Spirit 2 These. 1.13, 14. 2 Cor. 3.36.
, out of that state of sin and death, in which they are by nature, to grace and
salvation by Jesus Christ Rom 8.2. Ephesians. 2.1, 5. 2 Timothy 1.9.
, in lightning their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of
God Act. 26.18. Ephesians. 1.17.18.
; taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh;
renewing their wills, and by his Almighty power determining them to that which
is good Ezekiel. 11.19. Phil. 2.13. Deuteronomy. 30.6.
, Ezekiel 36.26.
and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ Ephesians. 1.19
; yet so, as they come most freely, being made willing by his grace Cant. 1.4.
Ioh 6.37.
.

II. This effectual Call is of Gods free, and special grace alone, not from any
thing at all foreseen in man 2 Timothy 1.9. Tit. 3.4.5.8.9.
, who is altogether passive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the
holy Spirit 1 Cor. 2.1.4. Romans 8.7. Ephesians. 2.5.
, he is thereby enabled to answer this Call, and to embrace the grace offered,
and conveyed in it Ioh 6.37.
.

III. Elect infants dying in Infancy are regenerated, and saved by Christ
through the Spirit Luke 18.15.16. Ioh. 3.3, 5.
, who works when where and how he pleases Ioh. 3.8.
: So also are all other elect Persons, who are incapable of being outwardly
called by the Word 1 Ioh. 5.12. Act. 4.12.
.

IV. Others, not elected, though they may be called by the Ministry of the Word
Mat. 22.14.
, and may have some common operations of the Spirit, Mat. 7.22 Heb. 6.4 5.
yet they never truly come unto Christ, and therefore cannot be saved Ioh.
6.64.65, 66. and 8.24.
: much less can men, not professing the Christian Religion, be saved in any
other way whatsoever, be they never so diligent to frame their lives according
to the light of Nature, and the Law of that Religion they do profess Act. 1 12.
Ioh. 14 6. Ephesians 2.12. Ioh. 4.22.
. And, to assert and maintain, that they may, is very pernicious, and to be
detested 2 Ioh. v. 9, 10, 11. Gal. 1.6.78
.

CHAP. XI. Of Justification,
THose whom GOD effectually calls he also freely justifies To. 8.30. and 3,
24.
not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by
accounting and accepting their persons as righteous: not, for any thing wrought
in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone: nor, by imputing faith
itself, the act of believing, nor any other evangelical obedience, to them as
their righteousness; but, by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ
unto them Romans 4 5.9, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 5.19. Romans 3.22.24, 25, 26. Tit. 3 5.7. Ephesians.
1.7. Ier. 23.6. 1 Cor. 1.30. Romans 5.17.18, 19.
, they receiving and resting on him and his righteousness by faith, which faith
they have, not of themselves, it is the gift of God Act. 10.44. Phi. 3.5. Act.
13.3^, 39.
.

II Faith, thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the
alone instrument of justification John 1.12. Romans 3.18.
; yet is it not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all
other saving graces, and is no dead faith but works by love ^am. 2.17. Gal.
5.6.
.

III. Christ by his obedience and death, did fully discharge the debt of all
those that are thus justified, and did make a proper, real, and full
satisfaction to his Fathers Justice in their behalf Romans 5.8. 1 Timothy 2.5. Heb.
10.10. Isa. 53.4, 5, 6, 10, 11.
. Yet in as much as he was given by the Father for them Romans 8.32.
, and his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead hand, both freely,
not for any thing in them, their justification is only of free grace Rom 3.24
, Mat. 3.17
that, both the exact justice, and rich grace of God, might be glorified in the
justification of sinners To. 3.26.
.

IV. God did from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect Gal. 3.8. Romans
8.30.
, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die f^r their sins, and rise again
for their justification Gal. 4.4. Rom ^.25.
: nevertheless they are not justified, until the holy spirit does in due time,
actually apply Christ unto them Tit. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
.

V. God does continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified Mat.
6.12. 1 John 2.1.2.
: and, although they can never fall from the state of justification Luk, 22.32,
^ Joh. 10, 8.
; yet, they may by their sins, fall under Gods fatherly displeasure, and not
have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble
themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their Faith and
Repentance Psalm. 8^.31, 32, 33. Mat. 26.75
.

VI. The justification of Believers under the Old Testament, was, in all these
respects, one and the same, with the justification of Believers under the New
Testament Gal. 3.9, 13, 14.
.

CHAP. XII. Of Adoption.
ALl those that are justified, God vouchsafes, in, and for his only Son Jesus
Christ, to make partakers of the grace of Adoption Ephesians. 1.5. Gal. 4 4, 5.
: by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and
privileges of the children of God Romans 8.17. Jer. 14.9. Rev. 3.12.
, have his Name put upon them c, receive the spirit of Adoption Romans 8.15.
, have access to the throne of grace with boldness Ephesians. 3.12.
, are enabled to cry Abba, Father Gal. 4.6.
, are pitied Ps. 103.13.
, protected Prove. 14.26.
, provided for Mat. 6.30 1. Pet. 5 7.
, and chastned by him, as by a Father Heb. 12.6
: yet never cast off Lam. 3.31
, but sealed to the day of redemption Ephesians 4 30
, and inherit the promises Heb. 6.12
, as heirs of everlasting Salvation 1 Pet. 1.3.4 Heb. 1.14.
.

CHAP. XIII. Of Sanctification.
THey who are effectually called, and regenerated, having a new heart, and a
new spirit created in them are further sanctified really and personally,
through the virtue of Christ's death and resurrection 1 Cor. 6.11 Act. 20.32.
, by his word and spirit dwelling in them Ioh. 17.17 Ephesians. 5.26.
: the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed Romans 6.6.
, and the several lusts thereof are more and more weakened and mortified Gal.
5.14. Rom, 8.13.
, and they, more and more quickened and strengthened in all saving graces Col.
1.12.
, 2 Cor 7.1. Heb. 12.12.
to the practice of true holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.

II. This sanctification is throughout, in the whole man 1 These. 5.23.
: yet imperfect in this life, there abides still some remnants of corruption
in every part 1 Ioh. 1 10 Romans 7 18.23. Phil. 3.12.
: whence arises a continual and irreconcilable war; the flesh lusting against
the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh Gal. 5.17. 1 Pet. 2 11.
.

III. In which war, although the remaining corruption, for a time, may much
prevail To. 7.23.
: yet through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of
Christ, the regenerate part does overcome To. 6.14.
: and so the Saints grow in grace 2 Pet. 3.18.
, perfecting holiness in the fear of God 2 Cor. 7.1.
.

CHAP. XIV. Of saving Faith.
THe grace of Faith, whereby the Elect are enabled to believe to the saving of
their Souls Heb. 10.39.
, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts 2 Cor. 4.13.
, and is ordinarily wrought by the Ministry of the Word Romans 10.14, 17.
, by which also, and by the administration of the Sacraments, and Prayer, it is
increased and strengthened 1 Pet. 2.2 Romans 4.1^.
.

II. By this Faith, a Christian believes to be true, whatsoever is revealed in
the word, for the authority of God himself speaking therein Ioh. 4.42. 2 These.
3.13
* and acts differently upon that which each particular passage thereof
contains, yielding obedience to the Commands Romans 16.26.
; trembling at the threatenings Heb. 11.13.
, Isa. 66.2.
and embracing the promises of God for this life, and that which is to come
Heb. 11.13.
. But the principal acts of saving faith, are Accepting, Receiving, and resting
upon Christ alone for Justification, Sanctification, and Eternal life; by
virtue of the Covenant of grace Ioh. 1.11. Act. ^6.32 Act. 15.11.
.

III. This faith is different in degrees, weak, or strong Heb. 5.13
: may be often and many ways assailed, and weakened, but gets the victory Luke
22.31. Ephesians. 6.16.
: growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through Christ Heb
6.11.12. Heb. 10.22. Col. 2.2.
, who is both the Author and finisher of our Faith Heb. 12.2.
.

CHAP. XV. Of Repentance unto life.
REpentance unto life, is an Evangelical grace Zech. 12.^0. Act 11.18
, the doctrine whereof is to be Preached by every Minister of the Gospel, as
well as that of Faith in Christ Luke 24.47. Mat. 1.^5.
.

II. By it, a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger, but
also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy
nature, and righteous Law of God: and, upon the apprehension of his mercy in
Christ to such as are penitent, so grieves for, and hates his sin^, as to turn
from them all unto God Ezekiel 18.30, 31. I^a. 30.22. Psalm. 51.4* P^a^. 119.128.
, purposing and endeavoring to walk with him in all the ways of his
Commandments Psa. 119.6.59.105. Luke 1.6* 2 Kings. 23.15.
.

III. Although Repentance be not to be rested in, as any satisfaction for sin,
or any cause of the pardon thereof Ezekiel. 36.31, 32. Ezekiel. 16.61.62, 63.
, which is the act of Gods free grace in Christ Hos. 14.24. Romans 3.24.
, yet is it of such necessity to all sinners, that none may expect pardon
without it Luke 13.3.5. Act. 17.50, 51.
.

IV. As there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation Romans 6.23. Mat. 22.36
; so there is no sin so great, that it can bring damnation on those who truly
repent Isa. 1.16.18.
.

V. Men ought not to content themselves with a general repentance, but it is
every man's duty to endeavor to repent of his particular sins, particularly Ps.
19.13. Luk* 9.8.
.

VI. As every man is bound to make private confession of his sins to God,
praying for the pardon thereof Ps. 51.4.
upon which, and the forsaking of them, he shall find mercy Prove. 28.13. 1 John
1.9.
: so he that scandalizeth his brother, or the Church of Christ, ought to be
willing by a private or public confess^on* and sorrow for his sin to declare
his repentance to th^se that are offended Jam 5.16. Luk 17 3. Joh. 7.19. Psalm
51. (...)
, who are thereupon to be recon^^^ed to him, and in love to receive him. ^
.

CHAP. XVI. Of good Woorks.
GOod Works are only such as God has commanded in his holy Word Mic. 6.8 Romans
12.2. Heb. 13.21.
, and not such as without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind
zeal, or upon any pretense of good intention Mat. 15.9. Isa. 29.13. 1 Pet.
1.18. Romans 10.2. Ioh. 16.2.
.

II. These good works done in obedience to Gods Commandments, are the fruits
and evidences of a true and lively faith Iam. 2.18 22.
: and by them, Believers manifest their thankfulness Psalm. 116.12, 13. 1 Pet.
2.9.
: strengthen their assurance 1 Job. 2.3.
, edify their Brethren 2 Cor. 6.2. Mat. 5.16.
, adorn the profession of the Gospel Tit. 2.5, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Timothy 6.1.
, stop the mouths of the adversaries 1 Pet. 2.15.
, and glorify God 1 Pet. 2.22. Ioh. 15.8.
, whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto Ephesians. 2.10.
: that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end, eternal life
Romans 6.22
.

III. Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly
from the Spirit of Christ Ioh. 15.4 Ezekiel. 16.26, 27.
. And that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already
received, there is required an actual influence of the same holy Spirit, to
work in them to will and to do, of his good pleasure Phil. 2.13 ^ Cor. 3.5.
: yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to
perform any duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to
be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them Phil. 2.12 Heb.
6.11.12. Isa. 64.7. 2 Timothy 26.6. Jude v. 20.21.
.

IV. They who in their obedience attain to the greatest hight, which is
possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and to do
more than God requires, as that they fall short of much which in duty they are
bound to do Luke. 17.10. Neh. 13.22. Ioh. 9.2.7. Gal. 4.17.
.

V. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the
hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the
glory to come; and the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom, by
them, we can neither profit, not satisfy for the debt of our former sins To.
3.20. Ephesians. 2.8.9. Psalm. 16.2. Job. 35 78
, but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are
unprofitable servants Luke 17.10.
, and because, as they are good they proceed from his spirit Gal. 5.22.
: and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled, and mixed with so much
weakness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of Gods
judgment Isa. 64.6. Gal. 5.17. Romans 7.15.18.
.

VI. Yet notwithstanding the Persons of believers being accepted through
Christ, their good works also are accepted in him Ephesians. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.5. Genesis
4.4. Heb. 11, 4.
, not as though they were in this life wholly unblamable and unreprovable in
Gods sight Job. 9.20.
, but that, he looking upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept and reward
that which is sincere, though accompanied with many weaknesses and
imperfections Heb. 13.20, 21. 2 Cor. 8 12. Heb. 6.10. Mat. 15.21 23.
.

VII. Works done by unregenerate men, although, for the matter of them they may
be things which God commands, and of good use, both to themselves and others 2
Kings 10.30, 31. Phil. 1.15.16, 18.
, yet because they proceed not from an heart purified by faith Genesis 4.9. Heb.
11.4*
, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word 1 Cor. 13 3, Isa. 12.
, nor to a right end, the glory of God Mat. 6.3.
, they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, or make a man meet to
receive grace from God Hag. 2.14. Tit. 1.15. Amos 5.21.22 Hos. ^.4.
. And yet their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing unto God Ps.
14.4. Job. 21.14, 15. Mat. 25.41.
.

CHAP. XVII. Of Perseverance.
THey whom God has accepted in his ^eloved, effectually called, and sanctified
by hi^ Spirit, can neither to^ally nor finally; fall away from the state of
grace: but shall certainly persevere ^herein to the end, and be eternally saved
Phi^. 1.6. 2 Pet. 1.10. 1 Ioh. 2.9. 1 Pet. 1.5.
.

II. This perseverance of the Saints depends not upon their own free will, but
upon the immutability of the decree of election, flowing from the free and
unch^ngeable love of God the Father 2 Timothy 2.18, 19. Ier. 31.3.
, upon the e^ficacy of the merit and in^ercession of Jesus Christ Heb. 10.10,
11. Heb. 9.12, 13.14, 15. Luke 12.32
* the abiding of the spirit, and of the seed of God within them Ioh. 4.16 John
2*27.
, and the nature of the Covenant of Grace Jer. 32.40.
: from all which arises also the certainty and infalli^ility thereof Joh.
10.28 1 John 2.19.
.

III. Nevertheless, they may through the temptations of ^atan and of the world,
the prevalency of corruption remaining in them; and the neglect of the means of
their preservation, fall into grievous sins Mat. 26.70, 71, 74.
, and for a time continue therein Psalm. 51.14*
, whereby they incur Gods displeasure Isa. 64.5.
, and grieve his holy spirit Ephesians. 4.30.
, come to be d^prived of some measure of their graces and comforts Psalm. 51.8.
, have their hearts hardened Isa. 53.17.
, and their consciences wounded Ps. 37.3.4
, hurt, and scandalize others Sam. 12.14.
, and bring temporal judgments upon themselves Ps. 89* 31.32.
.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the assurance of Grace and Salvation.
ALthough hypocrites and other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themselves
with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favor of God, and
estate of Salvation Job. 8.13 14. Mic. 3.11. Deuteronomy. 29.19
, which hope of theirs shall perish Mat. 7.22 Act. 26.6.23.
: yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity,
endeavoring to walk in all good conscience before him, may in this life be
certainly assured that they are in the state of grace 1 Ioh. 2.3 1 Ioh. 5.13
, and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of god which hope shall never make
them ashamed Romans 5.2, 5.
.

II. This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable persuasion, grounded
upon a fallible hope Heb. 6.11.19.
, but an infallible assurance of faith, founded upon the divine truth of the
promises of salvation Heb. 6.17.18.
, the inward evidence of those graces unto which these promises are made 1 Pet.
1.4.5, 10, 11. 1 Job. 2.3. 2 Cor, 1.12.
, the testimony of the spirit o^ adoption witnessing with ou^ spirits that we
are the children of God Romans 8.15
: which spirit is the earnest of inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day
of redemption Ephesians. 3.13.
.

III. This infallible assurance does not so belong to the essence of faith but
that a true believer may wait long and conflict with many difficulties before
he be partaker of it Ioh, 5.13 Isa. 30, 10. Mark 9.24. Psalm. 77. to ver. 12.
: yea, being enabled by the spirit to know the things which are freely given
him of God, he may, without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of
ordinary means, attain thereunto 1 Cor. 2.12 1 Ioh. 4.13 Heb. 6.11. Ephesians.
3.17.18* 19.
. And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his
calling and election sure 2 Pet. 1.10.
, that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the holy Ghost, in
love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of
obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance Romans 5.1, 2, 5 Romans 14.17.
Ephesians. 1.3, 4 Psalm. 4.6.7.
; so far is it from inclining men to looseness 1 Ioh. 2.1. Romans 6.1, 2. 2 Cor.
7.1. To. 8.1.12. 1 Ioh. 1.2.3 Psalm. 1^0.4 1 Ioh. 1.6.7
.

IV. True believers may have the assurance of their Salvation diverse ways
shaken, diminished, and intermitted, as by negligence in preserving of it, by
falling into some special sin, which wounds the conscience, and grieveth the
spirit, by some sudden or vehement temptation, by Gods withdrawing the light of
his countenance, and suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness, and
to have no light Cant. 5.2.3, 6. Psalm. 51.8, 12, 13. Ephesians. 4.30. Psalm. 77.1.
Mat. 26.69 Isa. 50.10. Psalm. 31.22 Psalm. 88. throughout.
: yet are they never utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of faith,
that love of Christ and the brethren, that sincerity of heart, and conscience
of duty, out of which by the operation of the spirit, this assurance may in due
time be revived Joh. 3.9. Luke 21.52. Job 13.15. Psalm. 73.15. Isa. 50.10.
, and by the which in the mean time their supported from utter despair Mic.
7.7, 8, 9. Jer. 32.10. I^a. 5.4, 7, 8, 9, 10. ps. 22.1. ps. 88. throughout


CHAP. XIX. Of the Law of God.
GOD gave to Adam a Law, as a Covenant of Works, by which he bound him, and all
his posterity to personal, entire, exact and perpetual obedience, promised life
upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it: and endued him
with power and ability to keep it Genesis 1.16 Genesis 2.17. To. 2.14.15 and 10.5.
Gal. 3.10. Eccl. 7.9. Job. 28.28.
.

II. This Law, after his fall continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness,
and as such, was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in ten Commandments, and
written in two Tables Jam. 1.25* and 2.8.1^, 11. To. 13.8, 6. Deuteronomy. 5.32. and
0.4. Exodus 34.1
, the four first Commandments containing our duty toward God, and the other
six, our duty to man Mat. 22.37, 33, 39, 40.
.

III. Beside this Law commonly called Moral, God was pleased to give to the
people of Is^ael, as a Church under age, Ceremonial Laws, containing several
typical Ordi^ances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ his graces, actions,
suffering^, and benefits Heb. 9. Chap. Heb. 10.1. Col. 2.17.
, and partly hold^ng forth diverse instructions of Moral duties 1 Cor. 5*2.
. All which Ceremonial Laws are now abrogated under the new Testament Col.
2.14.16, 17. Dan. 9.27. Ephesians. 1.15, 16
.

IV. To them also, as a body Politic, he gave sundry Judicial Laws, which
expired together with the state of that people, not obligeing any other now,
further than the general equity thereof may require Exodus 21. Chap. Exodus 22,
to 29. 1 Pet. 2.3, 14. Mat. 5.17.
.

V. The Moral Law does for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others,
to the obedience thereof Romans 13.8.9, 10.
, and that, not only in regard of the ^atter contained in it, but also in
respect of the Authority of God the Creator who gave it Iam 2.10.1.
. Neither does Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve but much strengthen this
obligation Mat. 5.17 18.19. Jam. 2.8. Romans 3.31.
.

VI. Although true believer* be not under the Law, as a Covenant of works, to
be thereby justified, or condemned Romans 6.14. Gal. 2.16. and 4, ^.5. Act.
13.^9. Romans 8.1.
, yet it is of great use to them, as well as to others, in that, as a rule of
life informing the of the will of God, and their duty, it directs and binds
them to walk accordingly Romans 7.21, 22, 25. Psalm. 119.4 5, 6. 1 Cor. 17.19
, discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts and lives Romans
7.7.
: so as examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of,
hum^liation for, and hatred against sin Iam. 1.23 Romans 7.9.
: together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the
perfection of his obedience Gal. 3.2^. Romans 8.3, 4.
. It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to restrain their corruptions: in
that it forbids sin Iam. 2.11 Psalm. 119.101, 104.
: and the threatenings of it serve to show, what even their sins deserve: and
what afflictions in this life, they may expect for them, although freed from
the curse thereof threatened in the Law Ezra 9.13, 14. Psalm. 89.30 31, 32, 33.
. The promises of it in like manner, show them Gods approbation of obedience,
and what blessings they may expect upon the performance there of Lev. 26.1. to
14. with 2 Cor. 6.10. Ephesians. 9.2, 3. Psalm. 19.11
: although not as due to them by the Law, as a Covenant of Works Gal. 2.16.
Luke 17.12.
. So as a man's doing good, and refraining from evil, because the Law
encourages to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his
being under the Law, and not under grace Romans 6 12 1 Pet. 3, 8.9, 10, 12. Heb.
12.28
.

VII. Neither are the fore mentioned uses of the Law contrary to the grace of
the Gospel, but do sweetly comply with it Gal. 3.21
, the spirit of Christ subduing, and inabling the will of man, to do that
freely and cheerfully, which the will of God revealed in the Law, requires to
be done Ezekiel. 36.27. Heb. 8.10.
,

CHAP. XX. Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience.
THe Liberty which Christ has purchased for Believers, under the gospel,
consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God,
the curse of the Moral Law Tit. 2.11. Gal. 3.13.
, and in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan,
and dominion of sin Gal. 1.4. Romans 6.14.
; from the evil of afflictions, the sting of death, the Victory of the grave,
and everlasting damnation Romans 2.8. 1 Cor. 15.54 55, 56, 57.
, as also, in their free access to God To. 5.1, 2.
, and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a Child
like love and willing mind To. 8.14. 1 Ioh. 4.18
. All which were common also to Believers under the Law. But under the new
Testament, the liberty of Christians is further enlarged, in their freedom from
the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, to which the Jewish Church was subject g, and
in greater boldness of access to the Throne of Grace h, and in fuller
communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the Law, did
ordinarily partake of Job. 7.58, 59. 2 Cor. 3.13.17, 18.
.

II. God alone is Lord of the conscience Jam. 4.12 Romans 14.4.
: and has left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men which are in
any thing contrary to his word, or beside it, in matters of Faith or Worship
Act. 4.19 Act. 5.29. Mat. 13.8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 1.24. Mat. 15.9.
. So that to believe such Doctrines, or to obey such commands out of
conscience, is to betray true liberty of conscience Col. 2.20.22, 23. Gal.
1.10. and 2.4, 5. and 5.1.
, and the requiring of an implicit. Faith, and an absolute and blind
obedience, is, to destroy liberty of conscience, and reason also To. 10.17 Isa.
4.20. Act. 17.11 Joh. 4.21. Hos. 5.11. Rev. 5.11.16, 17. Jer. 8.9.
.

III. They, who upon pretense of Christian Liberty, do practice any sin, or
cherish any Lust, do thereby destroy the end of Christian liberty, which is,
that being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, we might serve the Lord
without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our
life Gal. 1.13^ 1 Pet. 2.16 2 Pet. 2.19. Job. 8.34. Luke 1.74.
.

IV. And because the power which God has ordained, and the liberty which
Christ has purchased, are not intended by God, to destroy, but mutually to
uphold and preserve one another: They, who upon pretense of Christian liberty
shall oppose any lawful power, or the lawful exercise of it, whether it be
Civil or Ecclesiastical, resist the ordinance of God Ma. 12.29. 1 Pet. 2.13.14,
16. Romans 13.1. to 8. Heb. 13.17.
. And, for their publishing of such practices, as are contrary to the light of
nature, or to the known principles of Christianity, whether concerning Faith,
Worship, or Conversation: or, to the power of Godliness: or such erroneous
Opinions or Practices, as either in their own nature, or in the manner of
publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the external peace and order
which Christ has established in the Church, they may lawfully be called to
account, and proceeded against by the Censures of the Church To. 1.30. 1 Cor.
5.1, 5, 11.13. 2 John 10.11 2 These. 3.14 Tit. 1.10, 11, 12, and 3.12 Mat.
18.15, 16, 17. Rev. 3.2.
, and by the power of civil Magistrate Deuteronomy. 23.6. to 12. To. 13.3.4. 2 John
10.11. Ezra 7.23. to 28. Rev. 17.12, 16, 17. Neh. 13. to 30. 2 Kin, 23. to 21.
2 Chapter 34.35. and 15.12, 13. Dan. 3.21. Isa. 49.23. Zech. 13.2.3.
.

CHAP. XXI. Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath day.
THe light of Nature shows that there is a God, who has Lordship and
sovereignty over all, is good* and does good unto all, and is therefore to be
feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in and served with all the heart,
and with all the soul, and with all the might Romans 1.20 Psalm. 119.68. Ier.
10.7. Psalm, 18.3. Mark. 12.33.
. But, the acceptable way of worshipping the true God, is instituted by himself,
and so limited to his own revealed Will* that he may not be worshipped
according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan,
under any visible representations, or any other way not prescribed in the holy
Scripture Deuteronomy. 12.32. Mat. 15.9. Act. 17.25. Mat. 4.9.
.

II. Religious Worship is to be given to God, the Father, Son and holy Ghost;
and to him alone Mat. 4.10
; not to Angels, Saints, or any other Creature Col. 2.18. Rev. 19.10.
, and since the Fall, not without a Mediator; nor in the mediation of any
other, but of Christ alone Ioh. 4.6. 1 Timothy 2.5. Ephesians. 2.8.
.

III. Prayer with Thanksgiving being one special part of Religious Worship
Phil. 4.6.
, is by God required of all men Psalm. 65.2
: and that it may be accepted it is to be made in the name of the Son Ioh. 13.14
, by the help of his Spirit Romans 8.16.
, according to his will 1 Ioh. 5.14
: with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, Ps. 47.7.
and perseverance and if vocal, in a known tongue 1 Cor. 14.
.

IV. Prayer is to be made for all things lawful 1 Ioh. 5.14. Ioh. 17.20.
, and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter o: but not for
the dead 2 Samuel 12.21, 23. Rev. 13.12
, nor for those of whom it it may be known that they have sinned the sin unto
death 1 Ioh. 5.16.
.

V. The reading of the Scriptures with Godly fear Act. 15.21.
, the sound Preaching 1 Tit. 4.2.
, and conscionable hearing of the Word; in obedience unto God, with
understanding, faith, and reverence Mat 3.1.19.
: singing of Psalms with grace in the heart Col. 3.16. Iam. 5.13. Ephesians. 5.19.
: as also the due administration, and worthy receiving of the Sacraments
instituted by Christ; are all parts of the ordinary Religious Worship of God
Mat. 28.19.
; besides religious Oaths Deu. 6.63 Mat. 9.18.
, Vows Isa. 19.21. Eccles. 5.4, 5.
, Sollemn Fasting Joel. 2.12. Esther. 4.16. 1 Cor. 7.5.
, and Thanksgivings upon several occasions Ps. 107. throughout. Esther. 9.2^
, which are in their several times and seasons, to be used in an holy and
religious manner Heb. 12.28
.

VI. Neither Prayer nor any other part of Religious Worship, is now under the
Gospel, either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is
performed or toward which it is directed Ioh. 4.21
: but GOD is to be worshipped every where Mal. 1.11 1 Timothy 2.8.
, in Spirit and truth Ioh. 4.23.
: as in private Families Ier. 10.25 Ioh. 1*^.
, daily Mat. 6.11
, and in secret, each one to himself Mat. 6.6.
; so more solemnly in the public Assemblies, which are not carelessly or
wilfully to be neglected, or forsaken when God, by his word or providence
calls thereunto ^sa. 16.6. Heb. 10.2^. P^ov. 8.34. Act. 13.42*
.

VII. As it is of the Law of Nature, that, in general, a due proportion of time
be set apart, for the Worship of God: so in his word, by a positive, moral, and
perpetual Commandment, binding all men, in all Ages, he has particularly
appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto him Exodus 20 8,
10, 11. Isa. 56.1, 4.
: which from the beginning of the World to the resurrection of Christ, was the
last day of the week; and from the resurrection of Christ, was changed* into
the first day of the Week Genesis 2.2* 3
, which in Scripture is called the Lords Day Rev. 1.10.
, and is to be continued to the end of the World, as the Christian Sabbath
Exodus 20.8, 10. Mat^ 5.17.
.

VIII. This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men, after a due
preparing of their hearts and ordering of their common affairs beforehand, do
not only observe an holy rest all the day, from their own works, words and
thoughts about their worldly employments* and recreations Exodus 20.8. Exodus
3.15, 16, 17. Isa. 58.13. Nehem. 13.15. to 22.
, but also are taken up the whole time in the public and private exercises of
his Worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy Isa. 58.13
.

CHAP. XXII. Of Lawful Oaths and Vows.
A Lawful Oath is a part of religious Worship D^ut. 10.20.
, wherein, upon just occasion, the person swearing, solemnly calls God to
witness what he asserteth or promises; and to judge him according to the truth
or falsehood of what he swears Ex. 20.7: 2 Cor. 1.23. 2 Chronicles. 6.22, 23.
.

II. The Name of God only, is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it
is to be used with all holy fear and reverence ^eut. 6.13
. Therefore to swear vainly, or rashly, by that glorious and dreadful Name; or,
to swear at all, by any other thing, is sinful and to be abhorred Exodus 30.7.
Ier. 5.7. Mat. 5.34.
. Yet, as in matters of weight and moment, an Oath is warranted by the word of
God, under the New Testament as well as under the Old Heb 6.16.
; so a lawful Oath, being imposed by lawful Authority, in such matters ought to
be taken 1 King. 8.31.
.

III. Whosoever takes an Oath, ought duly to consider the weightiness of so
solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing, but what he is fully persuaded is
the Truth Exodus 20.7. Ier. 4.2.
, Neither may any man* bind himself by Oath to any thing but what is good and
just, and what he believes so to be, and what he is able and resolved to
perform Gen 24.2. to 9.
. Yet it is a sin, to refuse an Oath touching any thing that is good and just,
being imposed by lawful Authority Number. 5.1.9
.

IV. An Oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words without
equivocation, or mental reservation Ier. 4.2. Psalm. 24.14.
: It cannot oblige to sin; but, in any thing not sinful, being taken, it binds
to performance, although to a man's own heart 1 Samuel 25.32, 33, 34.
. Nor is it to be vio^ated, although made to Heretics o^ Infidels Ezekiel 17.16,
18, 19.
.

V. A Vow is of the like nature with a Promissary O^th, and ought to be made
with the like Religious care, and to be performed with the like faithfulness
Isa. 1^.21.
.

VI. It is not to be made to any Creature but to God a^one Ps. 76.11
, and that it may be accepted, it is to be made voluntarily, out of Faith, and
conscience of Duty, in way of thankfulness* for mercy received, or of the
obtaining of what we want: whereby we more strictly bind our selves to
necessary duties: or, to other things, so far, and so long as they may fitly
conduce thereunto Deu^. ^3.22, 23.
.

VII. No man may Vow, to do any thing forbidden in the word of God, or what
would hinder any duty therein commanded, or which is not in his own power, and
for the performance whereof, he has no promise of ability from God Act. 23.12,
14.
. In which respect, Popish Monastical Vows of perpetual single life, professed
Poverty, and Regular Obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher
Perfection, that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which, no
Christian may entangle himself Mat. 19.11, 12. 2 Pet. 4.2.
.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Civil Magistrate.
GOD, the Supreme Lord and King of all the world, has ordained Civil
Magistrates to be under him, over the people for his own Glory, and the public
good: and to this end, has armed them with the power of the sword, for the
defense and encouragement of them that are good, and for the punishment of evil
doers Romans 13.1, 2, 3, 4.
.

II. It is Lawful for Christians to accept and execute the Office of a
Magistrate, when called thereunto Pro. 8.15*
: in the managing whereof, as they ought especially to maintain Piety, Justice,
and Peace, according to the wholesome Laws of each Commonwealth Ps. 2.10. 1 Pet.
2.13.
: so for that end, they may lawfully now under the New Testament, wage War,
upon just and necessary occasion Luke 3.14 Mat. 8.9. Rev. 17.16.
.

III. The Civil Magistrate may not assume to himself the administration of the
Word and Sacraments, or the power of the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven 2 Chronicles.
26.18. Mat. 16.9. Romans 10.15 Heb. 5.4.
: yet he has Authority, and it is his duty, to take order that Unity and peace
be preserved in the Church, that the truth of God be kept pure and entire, that
all blasphemies and heresies be suppressed, all corruptions and abuses in
worship and discipline prevented, or reformed: and all the Ordinances of God
duly settled, administered and observed Isa. 49.23 Lev. 24.16. 2 King. 1 8 4. 1
Chr. 13.1. to 9.
: For the better effecting whereof, he has power to call Synods, to be present
at them, and to provide that whatsoever is transacted in them, be according to
the mind of God 2 Chr. 19.8, 9, 10.
.

IV. It is the duty of people to pray for Magistrates 1 Timothy 2.1.2.
, to honor their persons 1 Pet. 2.17.
, to pay them tribute and other dues Romans 15.6, 7.
: to obey their lawful Commands, and to be subject to their Authority for
conscience sake Romans 13.5.
Infidelity or indifference in Religion does not make void the Magistrates just
and legal Authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to him 1 Pet.
2.13, 16.
: From which Ecclesiastical persons are not exempted Romans 13.1. Act. 25.9. Jude
v. 8. to 11.
, much less has the Pope any power or jurisdiction over them, in their
Dominions, or over any of their people; and least of all to deprive them of
their Dominions, or lives, if he shall judge them to be Heretics or upon any
other pretense whatsoever 2 Th^s. 2.4.
.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Marriage and Divorce.
MArriage is to be between one Man and one Woman. neither is it lawful for any
Man to have more than one Wife, nor for any Woman to have more than one
Husband, at the same time Genesis 2.34. Mat. 19.5.
.

II. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of Husband and Wife Genesis 2.18.
, for the increase of Mankind, with a legitimate issue, and of the Church with
an holy seed Mal. 2.15
, and for preventing of uncleanness 1 Cor. 7.2.
.

III. It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with judgment
to give their consent Heb 13.4. 1 Cor. 7.36.
. Yet, is it the duty of Christians to marry only in the Lord 1 Cor. 7.39.
. And therefore such as profess the true reformed Religion, should not marry
with Infidels, Papists, or other Idolaters. Neither should such as are godly be
unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are notoriously wicked in their life,
or maintain damnable heresies Genesis 34.14. Deuteronomy. 7.34. Ne^. 13 25.
.

IV. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of Consanguinity or Affinity
forbidden in the Word Lev. 8. chap. 1 Cor. 5.1.
. N^r can such incest^o^s Marriages ever be made lawful by any Law of man, or
consent of Parties, so as those Persons may live together as Man and Wife Mar.
6.18 Levit. 18.24. to 28.
. The man may not ma^ry any of his wifes kindred nearer in blood, than he may of
his own; nor, the Wo^an of her Husbands kindred, nearer in blood than of her
own Levit. 26 19, 21.
.

V. Adultery or fornication committed after a Contract, being detected before
Mar^iage, gives just occasion to the innocent Party to dissolve that contract
Mat. 1.8.19, 20.
* In the case of Adultery after Marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party
to sue out a divorce Mat. 5.31*32.
, and after the divorce, to marry another, as if the offending party were dead
Mat. 19.9. Romans 7.2 3^
.

VI. Although the corruptions of man be such as is apt to study Arguments,
unduely to put asunder thos^ whom God has j^yned together in marriage: yet
^^thing but Adultery, or such wilful desertion as can no way be remedied by the
Church, or Civil Magistrate, is cause sufficient of dissolving the bond of
Marriage Mat. 19.8. 1 Cor. 7.15.
: Wherein, a public and orderly course of proceeding is to be observed: And,
the persons concerned in it, not left to their own wills and discretion in
their own case Deuteronomy. 14.1, 2, 3, 4.
.

CHAP. XXV. Of the Church.
THE Catholic or Universal Church which is invisible, consists of the whole
number of the Elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under
Christ the Head thereof; and is the Spouse, the Body, the fullness of him that
fills all in all Ep^. 1.10.
.

II. The Visible Church which is also Catholic or Universal, under the Gospel
(not confined to one Nation, as before under the law) consist^ of all those,
throughout the world* that pro^ess the true Religion 1 Cor. 1.2 Ren. 7.9.
, together with their Children 1 Cor. 7.14. ^ Ez^k. 16.20.21. Romans 11.16
: an^ is the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ Mat. 13.47.
, the House and family o^ God Ephesians. 2.19. Ephesians. 3.15.
, ou^ of which there is no ordinary possibility of Salvation Act. 2.47.
.

III. Unto this Catholic visible Church, Christ has given the Ministry,
Oracles, and Ordinances of God, for the gathering, and perfecting of the
Saints, in this life to the end of the World: and does by his own presence and
spirit, according to his promise, make them effectual thereunto 1 Cor. 12.28.
Ephesians. 4.11, 12, 13.
.

IV. This Catholic Church has been sometimes more, sometimes less visible
Romans 15.3, 4. Rev. 12.6, 24.
. And particular Churches, which are Members thereof, are more or less pure,
according as the Doctrine of the Gospel is taught and embraced, Ordinances
administered, and public Worship performed more or less purely in them Rev. 2.3.
.

V. The purest Churches under Heaven are subject both to mixture and error 1
Cor. 13.12. Mat. 13.24 to 47.
, and some have so degenerated as to become no Churches of Christ, but
Synagogues of Satan Rev. 18.2. Romans 11.18
. Nevertheless, there shall be always a Church on Earth to worship God
according to his will Mic. 6.18. Mat. 28 1^
.

VI. There is no other Head of the Church, but the Lord Jesus Christ Co^. 1.18.
. Nor can the Pope of Rome, in any sense be head thereof: but is that
Antichrist, that Man of sin, and Son of perdition that exalts himself in the
Church, against Christ and all that is called God Mat. 2.3, 8, 9, 10. Re^. 13.6.
.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Communion of Saints.
ALL Saints that are united to Jesus Christ their head, by his Spirit, and by
Faith, have fellowship with him in his graces, sufferings, death, resurrection,
and glory 1 Ioh. 1.3 Ioh. 1.16. Phi^. 3.10.
. And, being united to one another in love, they have communion in each others
gifts and graces Ephesians. 4.15. Col. 2.19.
, and are obliged to the performance of such duties public and private, as do
conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man 1 These.
5.11.14. 1 Ioh. 3.16
.

II. Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and
communion in the worship of God; and in performing such other spiritual
servic^s as tend to their mutual edification Heb. 10.24.25. Isa. 2.3.
: as also, in relieving each other in outward things according to their several
abilities, and necessities. Which Communion, as God offers opportunity, is to
be extended unto all those, who in every place call upon the Name of the Lord
Jesus Act. 2.44. 1 Ioh. 3.17.
.

III. This Communion which the Saints have with Christ, does not make them, in
any wise, partakers of the substance of his Godhead, or to be equal with
Christ in any respect: either of which to affir^, is impious and blasphem^us
Col. 1.18.19. 1 Cor. 8.6. Isa. 41.8. Heb. 1.89.
. Nor does their Communion one with another as Saints, take away, or infringe
the title or propriety which each man has in his goods and possessions Exodus
10.15. Ephesians. 4.28.
.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the Sacraments.
SAcraments are holy Signs, and Seals of the Covenant of grace Romans 4.12
, immediately instituted by God Mat. 28.19.
, to represent Christ, and his benefits; and to confirm our interest in him 1
Cor. 10.16. Ga. 3.7
. as also, to put a visible difference between those that belong unto the
Church, and the rest of the world Romans 15.8. Ex. 12.18.
; and solemnly to engage them to the service of God in Christ according to his
word Romans 6.3, 4. 1 Cor. 10.16.21.
.

II. There is in every Sacrament a Spiritual relation, or Sacramental union,
between the sign and the thing signified: whence it comes to pass, that the
names, and effects of the one, are attributed to the other Genesis 17, 10 Mat.
26.27
.

III. The grace which is exhibited in, or by the Sacraments rightly used, is
not conferred by any power in them; neither does the efficacy of a Sacrament
depend upon the piety, or intention of him that does administer it Romans 2.28.
; but upon the work of the Spirit Mat. 3.11. 1 Cor. 12.13
, and the word of institution, which contains, together with a precept
authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers Mat.
16.27, 28.
.

IV. There be only two Sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord, in the Gospel,
that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, neither of which may be
dispensed by any, but by a Minister of the word lawfully ordained Mat. 28.19.
Heb. 5.4.
.

V. The Sacraments of the Old Testament, in regard of the spiritual things
thereby signified, and exhibited, were, for substance the same with those of
the New 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4.
.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Baptism.
BAptism is a Sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ Mat.
28.19.
, not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized, into the visible
Church 1 Cor. 12.1, 3.
: but also, to be unto him a sign and seal of the Covenant of Grace Romans 4.11.
, of his ingrafting into Christ Gal. 3.27.
, of Regeneration Tit. 3.5.
, of Remission of sins Mat. 1.4.
, and of his giving up unto God through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of
life Romans 6.2.
, which Sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, to be continued in his
Church, until the end of the World Mat. 28.19, 20.
.

II. The outward Element to be used in the Sacrament, is Water, wherewith the
party is to be Baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, by a Minister of the Gospel, lawfully called thereunto Mat. 3.12
Ioh. 1.33.
.

III. Dipping of the person into the Water, is not necessary: but, Baptism is
rightly administered, by pouring, or sprinkling Water upon the person Heb. 9.10.
to 22.
.

IV. Not only those that do actually p^of^ss Faith in, and obedience unto
Christ Mat. 16.15.16.
, but also the infants of one, or both believing parents, are to be baptized
Genesis 7.9. Col. 2.11.12. Act. 2.38.39. Mat. 28.19.
.

V. Although i^ be a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance Luke 7.30.
Exodus 4.24.
, yet ^race and Salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no
person can be regenerated or saved without it Romans 4.11
, or that all that are baptized, are undoubtedly regenerated Act. 8.13.
.

VI. The efficacy of Baptism is not ^yed to that moment of time, wherein it is
administered Ioh. 3.58
, yet notwithstanding by the right use of this Ordinance, the grace promised,
is not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost to
such (whether of age, or infants) as that grace belongs unto, according to
the Council of Gods own Will, in his appointed time Gal. 1.27.
.

VII. The Sacrament of Baptism is but once to be administered to any person Tit.
3 5.
.

CHAP. XXIX. Of the LORDS Supper.
OUr Lord Jesus, in the night wherein he was betrayed, instituted the Sacrament
of his Body and Blood, called the Lords Supper to be observed in his Church,
unto the end of the world, for the perpetual Remembrance of the Sacrifice of
himself in his Death: the sealing all benefits thereof unto true Believers,
their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further engagement in, and
to all duties which they ow unto him, and to be a Bond and Pledge of their
Communion with him, and with each other, as Members of his Mystical Body 1 Cor
11.23, 24.
.

II. In this Sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father: nor, any real
Sacrifice made at all, for remission of s^n of the quick or dead Heb. 9.22 28.
, but only a commemoration of that one, offering up of himself, by himself,
upon the Cross, once for all, and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise
unto God for the same 1 Cor. 11.24, 36. Mat. 26.26
. So that, the Popish Sacrifice of the Mass (as they call it) is most
abominably injurious to Christ's one, only Sacrifice, the only propitiation for
all the sins of the elect Heb. 7.23 Heb. 10.12.
.

III. The Lord Jesus has in this Ordinance, appointed his Minister^ to declare
his word of institution to the People, to pray and bless the Elements of Bread
and Wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to a holy use: and to
take, and break the Bread, to take the Cup, and (they communicating also
themselves) to give both to the Communicants Mat. 26.26, 28. Luke 22.19
, but to none who are not then present in the Congregation Act. 10.7.
.

IV. Private Masses, or receiving this Sacrament by a Priest, or any other
alone 1 Cor. 10.6.
, as likewise the denial of the Cup to the People Mat. 14.23.
, worshipping the Elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for
adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use, are all
contrary to the nature of this Sacrament, and to the institution of Christ Mat.
15.9.
.

V. The outward Elements in this Sacrament duly set apart to the uses ordained
by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet
Sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they
represent, to wit, the Body and Blood of Christ Mat. 26.26, 27, 28.
: albeit in substance and nature, they still remain, truly and only Bread and
Wine, as they were before 1 Cor. 11.26, 28. Mat. 26.29
.

VI. That Doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of Bread and Wine,
into the substance of Christ's Body and blood (commonly called
Transubstantiation) by Consecration of a Priest, or by any other way, is
repugnant, not to Scripture alone, but even to common sense and reason;
overthrows the nature of the Sacrament, and has been, and is the cause of
manifold superstitions; yea, of gross Idolatries Act. 3.21 Cor. 11.26.
.

VII. Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of the visible Elements, in this
Sacrament 1 Cor. 2.28.
, do then also inwardly by faith really and indeed, yet not carnally and
corporally, but spiritually, receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and all
benefits of his death* The Body and Blood of Christ being then, nor corporally
or carnally, in, with or under the bread and Wine: yet, as really, but
spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the
Elements themselves are to their outward senses 1 Cor. 10.16.
.

VIII. Although ignorant, and wicked men receive the outward elements in this
Sacrament: yet they receive not the thing signified thereby; but by their
unworthy coming thereunto, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord to
their own damnation. Wherefore, all ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are
unfit to enjoy Communion with him, so are they unworthy of the Lords Ta^le* and
cannot without great sin against Christ while they remain such, partake of
these holy Mysteries 1 Cor. 11.27, 28, 29.
, or be admitted thereunto 1 Cor. 5.6.
.

CHAP. XXX. Of Church Censures.
THe Lord Jesus, as King and Head of his Church, has therein appointed a
Government, in the hand of Church Officers, distinct from the Civil Magistrate
Isa. 9.6, 7. Act. 20 17. Mat. 28.18.
.

II. To these Officers, the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed: by
virtue whereof, they have power, respectively, to retain, and remit sins: to
shut that Kingdom against the impenitent, both by the word and Censures; and to
open it unto penitent sinners, by the Ministry of the Gospel, and by absolution
from Censures, as occasion shall require Mat. 16.19. Mat 18.17. Ioh. 20.21.
.

III. Church Censures are necessary, for the ^eclaiming and gaining of
offending Brethren, for deterring of oth^^s from the like offenses, for pu^ging
out of that Leaven which might infect the whole Lump, for v^^dicating the
honor of Christ, (...) the holy profession of the Gos^^l, and for preventing
the wrath of God, which might justly fall upon the Church, if they should
suffer his Covenant, and ^he Seals thereof to be ^rofaned by notorious and
obstinate offenders 1 Cor. 5. chap. Mat. 7.6. Jude v. 23.
.

IV. For the better attaining of these ends, the officers of the Church are to
proceed by Admonition, suspension from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper for a
season; and by Excommunication from the Church, according to the nature of the
crime and demerit of the person 1 Th^s. 15.12, 2. Mat. 18.17
.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Synods and Councils.
FOr the better Government, and further edification of the Church there ought
to be such Assemblies, as are commonly called Synods or Councils Act. 15.2
.

II. As Magistrates may lawfully call a Synod of Ministers, and other fit
persons, to consult and advise with, about matters of Religion Isa. 49.23 1 Timothy 2.12. 2 Chronicles. 9.8, 9, 10, 11. Mat, 2.4.5.
: So, if Magistrates be open Enemies to the Church, the Ministers of Christ, of
themselves, by virtue of their Office; or they, with other fit persons, upon
delegation from their Churches, may meet together in such assemblies Act.
15.2.22, 23, 25.
.

III. It belongs to Synods and Councils, Ministerially to determine
Controversies of Faith, and cases of Conscience, to set down rules and
Directions for the better ordering of the public worship o^ God, and
Government of his Church: to receive complaints in cases of malice,
administration: and authoritatively, to determine the same; which Decrees and
Determinations, if consonant to the word of God, are to be received with
reverence, and submission: not only for their agreement with the word, but also
for the power whereby they are made as being an Ordinance of God appointed
thereunto in his Word Act. 15.15, 19, 24, 27, 28. Act. 16.4. Mat. 18.17 to 20.
.

IV. All Synods or Councils, since the Apostles times, whether general or
particular, may err, and many have erred. Therefore they are not to be made
the rule of Faith, or practice; but to be used as an help in both Ephesians. 2.20.
Act. 7.11. 1 Cor. 2.5.
.

V. Synods and Councils are to handle, or conclude nothing, but that which is
Ecclesiastical: and are not to intermeddle with Civil affairs which concern the
Common wealth, unless by way of humble petition in cases extraordinary: or by
way of advice, for satisfaction of conscience, if they be thereunto required by
the Civil Magistrate Luke 12.13, 14.
.

CHAP. XXXII^ Of the state of men after death, and of the Resurrection of the
dead.
THe bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption Genesis 3.19.
Act. 13.36.
: but their Souls (which neither die nor sleep) having an immortal subsistence,
immediately return to God who gave them Luke 23.43. Eccl. 12.7. 2 Cor. 5.1.
Phil. 1.13.
: the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received
into the highest Heavens where they behold the face of God, in light and glory,
waiting for the full Redemption of their Bodies Act. 3.21
. And the souls of the wicked are cast into Hell, where they remain in torments
and utter darkness, reserved to the Judgment of the great day Luke 16.23, 24. 1
Pet. 3.19.
. Besides these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the
Scripture acknowledges none.

II. At the last day, such as are found alive, shall not die, but be changed 1
These. 4.17.
; and all the dead shall be raised up, with the self same bodies, and none
other, although with different qualities, which shall be united again to their
souls for ever 1 Cor. 13.42, 43, 44.
.

III. The Bodies of the unjust, shall by the power of Christ be raised to
dishonor: the Bodies of the just by the Spirit, unto honor: and be made
conformable to his own glorious Body Act. 24.15. Ioh. 5.28.
.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of the last judgment.
GOD has appointed a Day, wherein he will judge the World in righteousness, by
Jesus Christ Act. 1^.21.
, to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father Ioh. 5.22.
. in which day, not only the Apostate Angels shall be judged 1 Cor. 5.3.
, but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth, shall appear before the
Tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words and deeds, and
to receive accordingly to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil
2 ^o^. ^.10.
.

II. The end of Gods appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the gl^ry
of his mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect: and, of his justice, in
the damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked, and disobedient: For, then
shall the Righteous go into everlasting Life, and receive that fullness of joy
and refreshing, which shall come from the Presence of the Lord: but* the
wicked, who know not God* and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be
cast into eternal Torments, and be p^nished with everlasting destruction from
the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of h^s power Mat. 25 31 Romans ^.22,
23*
.

III. As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that th^r^ shall be a
Day of Judgment, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater
consolation of the godly in their adversity Pet. 3.11
: so, will he have that day unknown to Men, that they may shake off all carnal
security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord
will come: and, may be ever prepared to say, Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly,
Amen M^^. 24.^6. Re^. 22.^^.

, nor in this life perfect in any Ioh. 1.8.
, but growing up to perfection 2 Cor. 7.1.

Gods promises, and by the spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those
graces to which the promises of life are made 1 Cor. 2.12.

the estate of grace, and that they shall be saved?

A. Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith Ephesians.
1.131.

, peace of conscience, joy in the holy Ghost, and hope of glory Romans 5.1.

to free them perfectly from sin and misery Rev. 14.15.
, and to make then* capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which
they then enter upon Luke 23.43.


Q. 89. What is the Communion in glory with Christ which the members of the
invisible Church enjoy immediately after death?

A. The communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible
Church enjoy immediately after death, is, in that their souls are then made
perfect in ho^iness (...) ^2.2^
, and received into the highest heavens 2 Cor. 5.6, 8.
, where they behold the face of God in light and glory Io^. ^.2.
, wanting for the f^ll redemption of their bodies Rom ^ 23.
, which even in death continue united to Christ 1 These. 4.14.
, and rest in their Graves as in their Beds Isa. 57.2.
; till at the last day they be again united to their souls Job. 19.26, 27.
: whereas the souls of the wicked are at death cast into hell, where they remain
in torments and utter darkness, and their bodies kept in their graves as in
their Prisons, till the great day Luke 16.73.
.

Q. 87. What are we to believe concerning the Resurrection?

A. We are to believe that at the last day there shall be a general
Resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust Act. 24.15
, when they that are then found alive, shall in a moment be changed, and the
self same bodies of the dead which were laid in the grave, being then again
united to their souls forever, shall be raised up by the power of Christ 1 Cor.
15.52.53.
; the bodies of the just by the Spirit of Christ, and by virtue of his
resurrection, as their head shall be raised in power, spiritual, incorruptible,
and made like to his glorious body 1 Cor. 15.22, 23, 42, 43, 44.
, and the bodies of the wicked shall be raised up in dishonor by him, as an
offended Judge Joh. 5.27
.

Q. 88. What shall immediately follow after the Resurrection?

A. Immediately after the resurrection shall follow the general and final
judgment of Angels and men 2 Pet. 2.4. Jude v. 6.7 14, 15.
, the day and hour whereof no man knows, that all may watch and pray, and be
ever ready for the coming of the Lord Mat. 24.35, 42, 4^.
.

Q. 89. What shall be done to the wicked at the day of Judgment?

A. At the day of judgment the wicked shall be set on Christ's left hand Mat.
25.33.
, and upon clear evidence, and full conviction of their own consciences Romans
2.15.
, shall have the fearful, but just sentence of condemnation pronounced against
them Mat. 25.41, 42, 43.
, and thereupon shall be cast out from the favorable Presence of God and the
glorious fellowship with Christ, his Saints, and all his holy Angels, into hell
to be punished with unspeakable torments, both of body and soul, with the Devil
and his Angels for ever 2 These. 1.8.
.

Q. 90. What shall be done to the Righteous at the day of Judgment? 1 These.
4.17.


A. At the day of judgment, the righteous being caught up to Christ in the
clouds, shall be set on his right hand, and there openly acknowledged and
acquitted Mat. 25.33.
, shall join with him in the judging of reprobate Angels and men 1 Cor. 6.2.
, and shall be received into heaven Mat. 25.34, 36. 1 Ephesians. 5.27.
, where they shall be fully and for ever freed from all sin and misery i,
filled with unconceivable joys Ps. 16.11.
: made perfectly holy, and happy both in body and soul, in the company of
innumerable saints, and holy Angels Heb. 12.22
, but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father, of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and of the holy Spirit, to all eternity 1 Ioh. 3.2
: and this is the perfect and full communion which the members of the invisible
Church shall enjoy with Christ in glory at the resurrection and day of Judgment.

Having seen what the Scriptures principally teach us to believe concerning
God; it follows to consider what they require as the duty of man.

Q. 91. WHat is the duty that God requires of man?

A. The duty which God requires of man, is obedience to his revealed will Romans
12.1, 2.
.

Q. 92. What did God at first reveal unto man as the rule of his obedience?

A. The rule of obedience revealed to Adam in the state of innocence, and to
all mankind in him, beside a special command, not to eat of the fruit of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was the moral Law Genesis 1.28.
.

Q. 93. What is the Moral Law?

A. The Moral Law is the declaration of the will of God to mankind, directing
and binding every one to personal, perfeect, and perpetual conformity and
obedience thereunto in the fruits and dispositions of the whole man, soul and
body Deuteronomy. 5.1.
, and in performance of all those duties of holiness and righteousness which he
owes to God and man Luke 1.75
; promising life upon the fulfilling, and threatening death upon the breach of
it Romans 10.5.
.

Q. 94. Is there any use of the Moral Law to man since the fall?

A. Although no man since the fall, can attain to righteousness and life by the
Moral Law So. 8.3.
, yet there is great use thereof as well common to all men, as peculiar either
to the unregenerate, or regenerate Tim. 1.8.
.

Q. 95. Of what use is the Moral Law to all men?

A. The Moral Law is of use to all men, to inform them of the holy nature and
will of God Lev. 11.44, 44.
, and of their duty, binding them to walk accorddingly Mic. 6.8 Iam. 2.10, 11.
; to convince them of their disability to keep it, and of the sinful pollution
of their nature, hearts, and lives Ps. 19.11, 12.
, to humble them in sense of their sin and misery Romans 3.9.25.
, and there by help them to a clear sight of the need they have of Christ Gal.
3.21 22.
, and of the perfection of his obedience Romans 10, 4.
.

Q. 96. What particular use is there of the Moral Law to unregenerate men?

A. The Moral Law is of use to unregenerate men, to awaken their consciences to
fly from wrath to come 1 Timothy 1.9, 10.
, and to drive them to Christ Gal. 3.24.
, or upon their continuance in the estate and way of sin, to leave them
unexcuseable Romans 1.20
, and under the curse thereof Gal. 3.10
.

Q. 97. What special use is there of the Moral Law to the regenerate?

A. Although they that are regenerate, and believe in Christ, be delivered from
the moral law as a Covenant of works Romans 6.14. Gal. 4.4, 5.
, so as thereby they are neither justified Romans 3.10
, nor condemned Gal. 5.23. Romans 8.1.
, yet, beside the general uses thereof common to them with all men, it is of
special use, to show them how much they are bound to Christ for his fulfilling
it, and enduring the curse thereof in their stead, and for their good Romans
7.24, 25.
, and thereby to provoke them to more thankfulness Luke 1.68, 69, 74, 75. Col.
1.12.
, and to express the same in their greater care to conform themselves thereunto
as the rule of their obedience Romans 7.22.
.

Q. 98. Where is the Moral Law summarily comprehended?

A. The moral Law is summarily comprehended in the ten Commandments, which were
delivered by the voice of God upon mount Sinai, and written by him in two
tables of stone Deu. 10.4.
, and are recorded in the twentieth chap. of Exodus: the four first
Commandments containing our duty to God, and the other six, our duty to man
Mat. 22.37, to 40.
.

Q. 99. What rules are to be observed for the right understanding of the ten
Commandments?

A. For the right understanding of the ten Commandments, these rules are to be
observed.

1. That the Law is perfect, and binds every one to full conformity in the
wholeman unto the righteousness thereof, and unto entire obedience, for ever;
so as, to requite the utmost perfection of every duty, and to for^^d the least
degree of every sin Psalm. 19.7 Mat. 5.21. to the end.
.

2. That it is spiritual; and so reaches the Understanding, Will, Affections,
and all other powers of the soul, as well as words, works and gestures To. 7.14.
.

3. That one and the same thing* in diverse respects, is required or forbidden
in several Commandments Col. 3.5. Amos. 8.5.
.

4. That, as, where a duty is commanded, the contrary sin is forbidden Isa.
58.13 Deuteronomy. 6.13.
, and, where a sin is forbidden, the contrary duty is commanded Mat. 1.21 to 25.
, so, where a promise is annexed, the contrary threatening is included Exodus
20.11.
* and where a threatening is annexed, the contrary promise is included Ier. 18.7
.

5. That, what God forbids is at no time to be done Job. 13.7
, what he commands is always our duty Deuteronomy. 4.8
, and yet every particular duty is not to be done at all times Mat. 12.7
.

6. That, under one sin or duty, all of the same kind are forbidden or
commanded, together with all the causes, means, occasions, and appearances
thereof, and provocations thereunto Mat. 5.21
.

to our places, to endeavor that it may be avoided or performed by others
according to the duty of their places Exodus 20.10.
.

8. That, in what is commanded to others, we are bound according to our places
and callings to be helpful to them 2 Cor. 1.24.
, and to take heed of partaking with others in what is forbidden them 1 Timothy
5.29.
.

people Genesis 17.7.
; who, as he brought them out of their bondage in Egypt; so he delivers us
from our spiritual thraldom Luke 1.74

all his Commandments 1 Pet. 1.15.16, 17, 18.
.

Q. 102. What is the sum of the four Commandments, which contain our duty to

profaned, or any way abused by us Lev. 19.12
, especially, because he is so far from acquitting and sparing the
transgressors of this Commandment, as that he will not suffer them to escape
his righteous judgment Ezekiel. 36.21, 22, 23.
, albeit many such escape the Censure and punishment of men 1 Samuel 2.12. to 24.
.

Q. 115. Which is the fourth Commandment?

thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle* nor thy
stranger that is within thy thy gates: For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, wherefore
the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it Exodus 20.8, 9, 10, 11
.]

Q. 116. What is required in the fourth Commandment?

A. The fourth Commandment requires of all men the sanctifying or keeping holy
to God, such set time as he has appointed in his Word; expressly, one whole day

, and in the new Testament called the Lords day Rev. 1.10.
.

Q. 117. How is the Sabbath o^ Lords day to be Sanctified?

A. The Sabbath or Lords day is to be Sanctified, by an holy resting all the
day Exodus 20.8* 10.
, not only from such works as are at all times sinful, but even from such
worldly employments and recreations as are on other days lawful Exodus 16.29. to
28.

to be taken up in works of necessity and mercy Mat. 12.10, to 13.
) in the public and private exercises of Gods worship Isa. 58.13 Act. 20.7.
Isa. 6 6.23.
: and to that end we are to prepare our hearts, and with such foresight,
diligence and moderation to dispose, and seasonably to dispatch our worldly
business, that we may be the more free and fit for the duties of that day Ex.
20.8.
.

Q. 118. Why is the charge of keeping the Sabbath more specially directed to
governors of families and other superiors?

A. The charge of keeping the Sabbath is more specially directed to governors
of families and other superiors, because they are bound not only to keep it
themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their
charge, and because they are prone often times to hinder them by employments of
their own Ex. 20.10 Ier. 17.20 21, 22.

A. The Reas^ns annexed to the fourth Commandment, the more to enforce it, are
taken from the equity of it, God allowing us six days of seven for our own
affairs, and reserving but one for himself, in these words, [ Six da^^ shall
thou labor and do all thy work Ex. 20.9.
.] from Gods challenging a special propriety in that day, [ The seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God Ex. 20.10
.] from the example of God, who in 6 days made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day, and from that blessing which
God put upon that day, not only in sanctifying it to be a day for his service,
but in ordaining it to be a means of blessing to us in our sanctifying it: [
Wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it Ex. 20.11
.]

Commandment?

in our preparation to keep it Ex. 16.23. Luke ^3.5^

title with v. 13.14.
, and to continue a thankful remembrance of the two great benefits of Creation
and Redemption which contain a short abridgment of Religion Genesis 2.2.3.
, and partly because we are very ready to forget it Eze. 12.26
, for that there is l^s light of nature for it Genesis 9.14.
, and yet it restrains our natural liberty in things at other times lawful
Ex. 34.31
: that it comes but once in seven days, and many worldly businesses come
between, and too often take off our minds from thinking of it, either to
prepare for it, or to sanctify it Deuteronomy. 54.14, 15.

II. Thou shall not make unto thee any graven I^age, or any likeness of any
thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that (...)
in the water under the Earth, thou shall not (...) down thy self to them nor

the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate me; and ^^ewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep

will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven, Give us this day our daily bread:
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; And lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the Kingdom, and the power,

THE CREED.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth: and in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the holy Ghost, born of
the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried:
He descended into Hell i. e. Continued in the state of the dead, and under the
power of death till the third day.
: the third day he rose again from the dead, he ascended into Heaven, and
siteth on the right ^and of God the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come
to judge the quick and the dead: I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy
Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
Resurrection of the Body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

SO much of every Question both in the Larger and Shorter Catechism, is
repeated in the Answer, as makes every Answer an entire Proposition, or
Sentence in it self; to the end, the Learner may further improve it upon all
occasions, for his increase in knowledge and piety* even out of the course of
catechizing, as well as in it.

And albeit the substance of the doctrine comprised in that abridgement,
commonly called the Apostles Creed, be fully set forth in each of the
Catechisms, so as there is no necessity of inserting the Creed it self, yet it
is here annexed, not as though it were composed by the Apostles, or ought to be
estee^ed Canonical Scripture, as the ten Commandments, and the Lords Prayer
(much less a Prayer, as ignorant people have been apt to make both it and the
Decalogue) but because it is a brief sum of the Christian Faith, agreeable to
the Word of God, and anciently recei^ed in the Churches of Christ.

THE SUM OF SAVING KNOWLEDGE, With the Practical use thereof.

John 6.37. All that the Father gives me, shall come to me: and him that
comes to me, I will in no wise cast out.

EDINBVRGH, Printed by George Swintoun, and Thomas Brown, and are to be sold
by James Glen, and David Trench. 1671.

A brief Sum of Christian Doctrine, Contained In Holy Scriptures, and holden
forth in the Confession of Faith and Catechism. Agreed upon by the Assembly of
Divines at Westminst^r, and received by the General Assembly of the Kirk of
Scotland.
The sum of Saving knowledge may be taken up in these four hea^s. 1. The woeful
condition wh^r^in all men are by nature, through breaking of the Covenant of
Works. 2. The R^medy pr^vided for the Elect in Jesus Christ, by the Covenant of
Grace. 3. The means appointed ^o make them part^kers of this Covenant. 4. The
blessi^gs which are effectually conv^yed unto the Elect by these means. Which
four heads are set down each of them in some f^w Propositions.

HEAD 1. Our woeful condition by nature, through breaking the Covenant of Works.
Hos. 13 9. O Israel, thou have destroyed thy self.
THe Almighty and Eternal God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, three
di^tinct persons, in one and the same undivided Godhead, equally in^inite in
all perfections; did before time most wisely decree for his own glory,
whatsoever comes to pass in time, and does most holily, and infallibly execute
all hi^ Decrees* without being partaker of the sin (...) any creature.

II. This God in six days made all things (...) nothing very good in their own
kind, in special^ he made all the Angels holy; and he mad^ our first Parents
Adam and Eve, the root (...) mankind* both upright and able to keep the Law
written in their heart. Which Law the^^ were naturally bound to obey under pain
(...) death, but God was not bound to reward their service, till he entered in
a Covenant or Contract with them, and their posterity in them* to give them
eternal life upon condition of perfect personal obedience, withal threatening
death in case they should fail. This is the Covenant of Works.

III. Both Angels and Men are subject to the change of their own free will as
experience proves (God having reserved to himself the incommunicable property
of being naturally unchangeable) For many Angels of their own accord fell by
sin from their first estate and became Devils our first Parents being enticed
by Satan, one of these Devils speaking in a serpent* did break the Covenant of
Works in eating the forbidden Fruit* whereby they and their posterity being in
their loins, as branches in the root, and comprehended in the same Covenant
with them, became not only liable to eternal death, but also lost all ability
to please God; yea did become by nature enemies to God and to all spiritual
good, and (...) lined only to evil continually. This is our original sin, the
bitter root of all our actual transgressions* in thought, word* and deed.

HEAD II. The remedy provided in Jesus Christ for the Elect by the Covenant of
Grace; Hos. 13.9. O Israel, thou have destroyed thy self, but in me is thine
help.
ALbeit man, having brought himself into this woeful condition be neither able
to ^elp himself, nor willing to be helped by God ^ut of it, but rather inclined
to ly still unsen^^^le of it, till he perish: yet God for the glory ^f his rich
Grace, has revealed in his Word ^way to save sinners, to wit, by faith in
Jesus Christ the Eternal Son of God, by virtue of and according to, the tenor
of the Covenant of Redemption, made and agreed upon between God the Father and
God the Son, in the counsel of the Trinity before the World began.

II. The sum of the Covenant of Redemption is this, God having freely chosen
unto life, a ^ertain number of lost mankind, for the glory ^f his rich Grace
did give them before the world began, unto God the Son appointed Redeemer, that
upon condition he would humble himself so far as to assume the humane nature ^f
a soul and body, unto personal union with ^is Divine Nature, and submit himself
(...) Law as surety for them, and satisfy Justice for them, by giving
obedience in their name, even unto the suffering of the cursed death of the
Cross, he should ransom and redeem them all from sin and death, and purchase
unto them righteousness and eternal life, with all saying graces leading
thereunto, to be effectually, by means of his own appointment, applied in due
time to every one of them. This condition the Son of God (who is Jesus Christ
our Lord) did accept before the world began, and in the fullness of time came
into the World, was born of the Virgin Mary, subjected himself to the Law, and
completely paid the ransom on the Cross: but by virtue of the foresaid
bargain made before the World began, he is in all ages since the fall of Adam,
still upon the work of applying actually the purchased benefits unto the elect:
and that he does by way of entertaining a Covenant of free grace and
reconciliation with them, through faith in himself, which Covenant he makes
over to every believer a right and interest to himself, and to all his
blessings.

III. For the accomplishment of this Covenant of Redemption, and making the
Elect partakers of the benefits thereof in the Covenant of Grace, Christ Jesus
was clad with the three^old Office of Prophet, Priest, and King. Made a
Prophet, to reveal all saving knowledge to his people, and to persuade them to
believe and (...) the same* Made a Priest, to offer up himself a sacrifice once
for them all, and to interceed continually with the Father for making their
persons and services acceptable to him. And made a King, to subdue them to
himself, to feed and rule them by his own appointed Ordinances, and to defend
them from their enemies.

HEAD 3. The outward means appointed to make the Elect partakers of this
Covenant, and all the rest that are called to be inexcusable, Mat. 22.14. Many
are called.
THe outward means and ordinances for making men partakers of the Covenant of
Grace are so wisely dispensed, as the Elect shall be infallibly converted and
saved by them, and the Reprobate among whom they are not, be justly stumbled.
The means are specially these four. 1. The Word of God. 2. The Sacraments. 3.
Kirk Government. ^. Prayer. In the Word of God preached by ^ent Messengers, the
Lord makes offer of Grace to all sinners upon condition of faith in Jesus
Christ, and whosoever do confess their sin, accept of Christ offered, and
submit themselves to his Ordinances, he will have both them and their children
received into the honor and privileges of the Covenant of Grace. By the
Sacraments God will have the Covenant sealed for confirming the bargain on the
foresaid condition. By Kirk Government he will have them ^edge in, and help
foreward unto the keeping of the Covenant. And by Prayer, he will have his own
gl^rious Grace promised in the Covenant, to be daily drawn forth, acknowledged
and employed. All which means are f^llowed either really, or in profession
only, according to the quality of the Co^enanters, as they a^e true or
counter^it believers,

II. The Covenant of Grace set down in the Old Testament before Christ came,
and in the New since he came, is one and the same in substance, albeit
different in outward administration: for the Covenant in the Old Testament,
being sealed with the Sacraments of Circumcision and the Paschal Lamb did set
forth Christ's death to come, and the benefits purchased thereby, under the
shadow of bloody sacrifices and sundry ceremonies: but since Christ came, the
Covenant, being sealed by the Sacraments of Baptism, and the Lords Supper, do
clearly hold forth Christ already crucified before our eyes, victorious over
death, and the grave, and gloriously ruling Heaven, and Earth for the good of
his own people.

HEAD IV. The bless^ngs which a^ effectually conveyed by these mea^ to the
Lords Elect or chosen one Mat. 22.24. Many are called, (...) few are chosen.
BY these outward Ordinances as our Lord makes the Reprobate inexcusable so, in
the power of his Spirit, he applies unto the Elect effectually, all saving
graces purchased to them, in the Covenant of Redemption, and makes a change in
their persons. In particular, 1. He does convert or regenerate them, by giving
spiritual life to them, in open^ng their understandings, renewing their wills,
affections and faculties, for giving spiritual obedience to his commands. 2. He
gives unto them saving Faith by making them in the sense of deserved
condemnation, to give their consent heartily to the* Covenant of Grace, and to
embrace Christ Jesus unfeigned. 3. He gives them Repentance, by making them,
with Godly sorrow in the hatred of sin, and love of Righteousness: turn from
all iniquity to the service of God, and, 4. He Sanctifies them, by making them
go on and persevere in faith, and spiritual obedience of the Law of God,
manifested by fruitfulness in all duties, and doing good works, as God offers
occasion.

II. Together with this inward change of their Persons, God changes also their
state: for so soon as they are brought by Faith into the Covenant of Grace, 1.
He Iustifies them, by imputing unto them, that perfect obedience which Christ
gave to the Law, and the satisfaction also which upon the Cross Christ gave
unto Justice in their name. 2. He Reconcials them, and makes them friends to
God, who were before enemies to God. 3. He Adoptes them that they should be no
more children of Satan, but children of God, enriched with all spiritual
privileges of his Sons: And last of all, after their warfare in this life is
ended, he perfects the holiness and blessedness, first of their souls at their
death, and then both of their souls and their bodies, being joyfully joined
together again, in the Resurrection, at the day of his Glorious coming to
Judgment* when all the wicked shall be sent away to Hell, with Satan whom they
have served; but Christ's own chosen and redeemed ones true Believers, Students
of holiness, shall remain with himself for ever, in the state of Glorification.

The practical use of Saving Knowledge, Contained in Scripture, and holden
forth briefly in the foresaid Confessions of Faith and Catechisms.
THe chief general use of Christian Doctrine is, to convince a man of sin, and
of Righteousness, and of Judgment, John 16.8. Partly by the Law or Covenant of
Works, that he may be humbled and become penitent, and partly by the Gospel or
Covenant of Grace, that he may become an unfeigned believer in Jesus Christ, and
be strengthened in his faith by good fruits* and so be saved.

The sum of the Covenant of Works, or of the Law, is this, If thou do all that
is commanded, and not fail in any point, thou shall be saved: But if thou fail,
thou shall die. Romans 10.5. Gal. 3.10, 12.

The sum of the Gospel or Covenant of grace and Reconciliation is this, If thou
flee from deserved wrath, to the true Reedemer Jesus Christ, (who is able to
save to the uttermost all that come to God, through him) thou shall not perish
but have eternal life, Romans 10.8.9, 11.

For convincing a man of sin, of Righteousness, and of Judgment by the Law* or
Covenant of Works let these Scriptures among many more be made use of.

1. For convincing a man of sin by the Law: consider, Ier. 17.9, 10.
THe heart is d^ceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know
it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, ^v^n to give every man
according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:

Here the Lord teaches these two things.

1. That the fountain of all our miscarriage and actual sinning against God is
in the heart, which comprehends the mind, will, affections and all the powers
of the soul, as they are corrupted and defiled with original sin: the mind
being not only ignorant and incapable of saving truth; but also full of error
and enmity against God* and the will and affections being obstinately
disobedient unto all Gods directions* and bent toward that only which is evil*
The heart, says he, is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked;
yea, and unsearchably wicked: so that no man can know it, and Genesis 6.5. Every
imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually (says the
Lord) whose testimony we must trust in this and all other matters: and
experience also may teach us, that till God make us deny our selves, we ^ever
look to God in any thing* but fleshly ^elf interest alone does rule us and move
all the wheels of our actions.

2. That the Lord brings our original sin ^r wicked inclination, withal the
actual fruits ^hereof, unto reckoning before his Judgment ^eat, for he
searches the heart and tries the ^eins, to give every man according to his
ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.

Hence let every man reason thus:

What God and my guilty conscience bears witness of, I am convinced that it
is true.

But God and my guilty conscience bears witness, that my heart is deceitful
above all things* and desperately wicked; and that all ^he imaginations of my
heart, by nature, are only evil continually.

Therefore I am convinced that this is true.

Thus a man may be convinced of sin by the Law.

^ For convincing a man of righteousness by the Law, consider, Gal. 3.10.
AS many as are of the w^rks of the Law, are under the curse: for it is
written, Cursed is ^very ^ne that continues not in all things which are
^ri^t^n in the Book of the Law to ^o them.

Here the Apostle teaches us three things.

1. That by reason of our natural sinfulness, (...) impossibility of any man's
being justified ^y the works of the Law is so certain, that whosoever do seek
Justification by the work of the Law, are liable to the curse of God, for
breaking of the Law; for, as many as are of (...) works of the Law are under
the curse, says he.

2. That unto the perfect fulfilling of the Law, the keeping of one or two of
the pr^^cepts, or doing of some, or of all duties (if (...) were possible) for
a time is not sufficient; (...) the Law requires, that a man continue in (...)
things which are written in the Book of the Law, (...) do them.

3. That because no man can come up to the perfection every man by nature is
under the curse; for the Law says Cursed is every one the continues not in
all things, which are written (...) the Book of the Law, to do them.

Now to be under the curse, comprehende^^ all the displeasure of God, with the
danger (...) the breaking forth more and more of his wrat^ upon soul and body,
both in this life and afte^ death perpetually, if grace do not prevent the full
execution thereof.

Hence let every man reason thus:

Whosoever, according to the Covenant o^ Works is liable to the curse of God,
for break^ing the Law, times and ways out of number cannot be justified or find
righteousness by the works of the Law.

But I (may every man say) according to the Covenant of Works, am liable to the
curse (...) God, for breaking the Law, times and ways (...) of number.

Therefore I cannot be justified, or have ^^ghteousness by the works of the Law.

Thus may a man be convinced of righteous^^^^, that it is not to be had by his
own works (...) by the Law.

^. For convincing a man of Judgment by the Law: consider, 2 These. 1.7.
THe Lord shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, ver. 8. In
flaming (...) ^aking vengeance on them that know not (...)* and that obey not
the Gospel of our Lord (...) Christ. ver. 9. Who shall be punished with
^^erlasting destruction from the presence of the (...), and from the glory of
his power. ver. 10. ^hen he shall come to be glorified in his saints, (...) to
be admired in all them that believe.

Wherein we are taught, that our Lord Jesus, ^ho now offers to be Mediator for
them who ^el^eve in him, shall at the last day, come armed ^ith flaming fire,
to judge, condemn and de^^roy all them who have not believed God, (...) not
received the offer of grace made in (...) Gospel, nor obeyed the Doctrine
thereof; (...) remain in their natural estate under the ^aw or Covenant of
Works.

Hence let every man reason thus:

What the righteous Judge has fore-warn^d, me shall be done, at the last day,
I am sure (...) just judgment.

But the righteous Judge has forewarned ^e, that if I do not believe God in
time, and obey the Doctrine of the Gospel, I shall (...) secluded from his
presence and his glory, at t^^ last day, and be tormented in soul and body
(...) ever.

Therefore I am convinced that this is (...) Judgment.

And I have reason to thank God heartil^ who has forewarned me to flee from
the wrat^ which is to come.

Thus every man may be, by the Law or C^^venant of Works, convinced of
judgment, (...) he shall continue under the Covenant (...) Works, or shall not
obey the Gospel of ou^ Lord Jesus.

For convincing a man of sin, righteous^ness, and judgment by the Gospel.
AS for convincing a man of sin, and righ^teousness, and judgment by the Gospe^
or Covenant of grace, he must understan^ three things. 1. That not believing in
Jesus Christ, or refusing of the Covenant of Grace offered in him, is a greater
and more dangerous sin, then all other sins against the Law^ because the
hearers of the Gospel* not believing in Christ, do reject Gods mercy in Christ*
the only way of freedom from sin and wrath, and will not yield to be reconciled
to God. Next, he must understand that perfect remission of sin and true
righteousness is to be had only by faith in Jesus; because God requires no
^ther conditions but Faith, and testfiies from ^eaven that he is well pleased
to justify sinners upon this condition. 3. He must understand that, upon
righteousness received by faith, ^udgment shall follow on the one hand, to the
^estroying of the works of the Devil in the ^eliever, and to the perfecting of
the work of ^anctification in him, with power: and that upon refusing to take
righteousness by Faith in jesus Christ, Judgment shall follow on the other
hand, to the condemnation of the misbe^^ever, and destroying of him with Satan
and ^is servants for ever.

For this end let these passages of Scripture, among many others, serve to make
the great^ess of the sin of not believing in Christ appear, ^r to make the
greatness of the sin of refusing ^f the Covenant of Grace, offered to us, in
^he offering of Christ unto us, let the fair offer ^f Grace be looked upon as
it is made, Isa. 55. ^. Incline your ear and come unto me (says the lord)
hear, and your soul shall live, and I will ^ake an everlasting Covenant with
you, even ^he sure mercies of David. That is, if ye will ^elieve me, and be
reconciled to me, I will by Covenant* give unto you Christ, and all saying
graces in him; repeated, Acts 13.24.

Again consider that this general offer in ^ubstance is equivalent to a special
offer made ^o every one in particular, as appears by ^^e Apostles making use
of it, Acts 16.13. ^elieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shall be saved
and thy house. The reason o^ which offer is given I^h. 3.16. For God so lov^^
the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, th^^ whosoever believes in him,
should not perish, bu^ have everlasting life. Seeing then this great salvation
is offered in the Lord Jesus, whosoever believe not in him, but lo^k for
happines^ some other way, what does he else, but observ^ lying vanities, and
forsake his own mercy which he might have had in Christ? Ion^h 2.8, ^* What
does he else but blaspheme God in hi^ heart? as it is said, 1 John 5.10. He
that believes not God, has made him a liar, because (...) believes not the
record that God gave of his Son and this is the record, that God has given to
us eternal life, and this life is in his Son; and that no si^ against the Law
is like unto this sin, Christ testifies, John 15.22. If I had not come and
spoken to them* they had not h^^ sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin.
This may convince (...) man of the greatness of this sin of not believing in
Christ.

For convincing a man of righteousness to be had only by faith in Christ ^
consider how, Romans 10.3, 4.
IT Is said, that the Jews being ignorant o^ Gods righteousness, and going
about to establis^ their own righteousness. have not submitted themselves unto
the righteousness of God, (and so they perished) for Christ is the end of the
La^ (...) righteousness to every one that believes: and ^cts 13.34. By Christ
Jesus all that believe, are ^^stified from all things, from which ye could not
be ^^stified by the Law of Moses: and 1 John 1.7. (...) blood of Jesus Christ
his Son, cleanses us from (...) sin.

For convincing a man of judgment, if a ^an embrace this righteousness:
consider, ^ John 3.8. For this purpose the Son of God was ^^nifested that he
mi^^t destroy the works of the ^evil. and Heb. 9.14. How much more shall the
(...) of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, (...) himself without spot to
God, purge your consci^ce from dead works to serve the living God.

But if a man embrace not this righteousness, (...) is pronounced, John 3.18.
He that be^^^veth not is condemned already; because he has (...) believed in
the Name of the only begotten Son of (...). And this is the condemnation, that
light is (...) into the World, and men love darkness rather (...) light.

Hence let the penitent desiring to believe, ^^ason thus:

What does suffice to convince all the Elect (...) the world of the greatness
of the sin of not ^^lieving in Christ, or refusing to flee to him (...) relief
from sins done against the Law, and ^^om wrath due thereto? and what suffices
(...) convince them that righteousness and eter^^l life is to be had by Faith
in Jesus Christ, or (...) consenting to the Covenant of Grace in him? and what
suffices to convince them of Judgment to be exercised by Christ for
destroying the works of the Devil in a man, and sanctifying and saving all that
believe in him, may suffice to convince me also.

But what the Spirit has said in these or other like Scriptures, suffices to
convince the Elect world of the foresaid sin and righteousness and Judgment.

Therefore what the Spirit has said in these and other like Scriptures,
serves to convince me thereof also.

Whereupon let the penitent desiring to believe take with him words, and say
heartily to the Lord; Seeing thou saye^t, seek ye my Face* my soul answers
unto thee, thy face, Lord will I seek, I have hearkened unto the offer of an
everlasting Covenant of all saving mercies to be had in Christ, and I do
heartily embrace thy offer, Lord let it be a bargain, Lord I believe, help my
unbelief: Behold I give my self to thee to serve thee in all things for ever,
and I hope they right ^and shall save me, the Lord will perfect that which
concerns me. Thy mercy* O Lord endures for ever, forsake not the works of
thy own hands. Thus may a m^n be made an unfeigned believer in Christ.

For strengthening the man's Faith who has agreed unto the Covenant of Grace.
BEcause many true believers are weak, and do much doubt if ever they shall be
sure of the soundness of their own Faith and Effectual calling, or made certain
of their Justification and Salvation, when they see, that many, who profess
faith, are found to deceive themselves; let us see how every believer may be
made strong in the faith, and sure of his own Election and Salvation upon solid
grounds by sure warrants and true evidences of faith. To this end among many
other Scriptures, take these following.

1. For laying solid grounds of faith, consider, 2 Pet. 1.10.

Wherefore the rather, brethren* give diligence to make sure your calling and
election, for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.

In which words the Apostle teaches us these four things, for help and
direction, how to be made strong in the faith.

1. That such as believe in Christ Jesus, and are fled to him for relief from
sin and wrath, albeit they be weak in the faith, yet they are indeed Children
of the same Father with the Apostles: for so he accounts of them, while he
called them brethren.

2. That albeit we be not sure, for the time of our effectual calling and
election, yet we may be made sure of both, if we use diligence: for this he
presupposes, saying, Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.

2. That we must not be discouraged, when we see many seeming believers prove
rotten branches and make defection, but we must the rather take the better heed
to our selves Wherefore the rather, brethren, says he, give all diligence.

4. That the way to be sure both of our effectual calling, and Election, is to
make sure work of our Faith, by laying the grounds of it solidly, and bringing
forth the fruits of our faith in new obedience constantly, For if ye do these
things, says he, ye shall never fall; understand by these things, what he had
said of sound faith, ver. 1, 2, 3, 4. And what he had said of the bringing out
of the fruits of faith, ver. 5, 6, 7, 8.

To this same purpose, consider, Romans 1.8. There is therefore now no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit. ver. 2. For the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Christ
Jesus, has made me free from the Law of sin and death. ver. 3. For what the
Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own
Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh.
ver. 4. That the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

Wherein the Apostle teaches us these four things, for laying of the ground of
faith solidly.

1. That every one is a true believer, who in the sense of his sin and fear of
Gods wrath does flee for full relief from both unto Jesus Christ alone, as the
only Mediator, and all-sufficient Redeemer of men, and being fled to Christ,
does strive against his own flesh, or corrupt inclination of nature, and
studieth to follow the rule of Gods Spirit, set down in his Word; for the man
whom the Apostle does here bless as a true believer, is a man in Christ Jesus,
who does not walk after the flesh, but after ^he Spirit.

2. That all such persons as are fled to Christ, and do strive against sin,
howsoever they may ^e possibly exercised under the sense of wrath, and fear of
condemnation, yet they are in no ^anger; for there is no condemnation (says
he) ^o them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit.

3. That albeit the Apostle himself (brought (...) here for examples cause) and
all other true ^elievers in Christ, be, by nature, under the ^aw of sin and
death, or under the Covenant ^f Works, (called the Law of sin and death,
because it binds sin and death upon us, till christ set us free) yet the Law
of the spirit of ^^e in Christ Jesus, or the Covenant of Grace ^o called,
because it does enable and quicken man to a spiritual life through Christ) does
set the apostle and all true believers free from the Covenant of Work^ or the
Law of sin and death, so that every man may say with him, The Law of the Spirit
of life, or the Covenant of Grace, has freed me from the Law of sin and death,
or Covenant of Works.

4. That the fountain and first ground from whence our freedom from the curse
of the Law does flow, is the Covenant of Redemption, past betwixt God, and God
the Son, as incarnate, wherein Christ takes the Curse of the Law upon him for
sin, that the believer, who could not otherwise be delivered from the Covenant
of Works, may be delivered from it. And this Doctrine the Apostle holds forth
in these four branches. 1. That it was utterly* impossible for the Law, or
Covenant of works, to bring righteousness and life to a sinner because it was
weak. 2. That this weakness and inability of the Law, or Covenant of Works, is
not the fault of the Law, but the fault of sinful flesh, which is neither able
to ^ay the penalty of sin, nor to give perfect obedience to the Law (presuppose
bygone sins were forgiven) the Law was weak (says he) through the flesh. 3.
That the righteousness and salvation of sinners, which was impossible to be
brought about by the Law, is brought to pass by sending Gods own Son, Jesus
Christ in the flesh, in whose flesh sin is condemned and punished, for making
satisfaction in the behalf of the Elect, that they might be set free. 4. That
by his means the Law loses nothing, because the righteousness of the Law is
best fulfilled this way: First by Christ, giving perfect active obedience in
our name unto it in all things: Next, by his paying, in our name, the penalty,
(due to our sins) in his death. And lastly, by his working of Sanctification in
us, who are true believers, who strive to give new obedience unto the Law, and
walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

Warrants yo believe.
FOr building our confid^nce upon th^s solid ground, these four Warrants and
special motives to believe in Christ may serve: The 1. whereof is Gods hearty
invitation, holden forth, Isa. 55.1, ^, 3, 4, 5.

Ho, every one that thirsts, come ye to the waters, and he that has no
money, come and buy without money, and without price. ver. 2. Wherefore do ye
spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which
satisfies not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and
let your soul delight it self in fatness. ver. 3. Incline your ear and come to
me; hear, and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting Covenant
with you, even the sure mercies of David. ver. 4. Behold I have given him for a
witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people, etc.

Here (after setting down the precious ransom of our Redemption by the
sufferings of Christ, and the rich blessings purchased to us thereby in the two
former Chapters) the Lord, in this Chapter,

1. Makes open offer of Christ and his grace by proclamation of a free and
gracious market of Righteousness and Salvation; to be had through Christ to
every soul without exception, that truly desires to be saved from sin and
wrath; ^o, every one that thirsts, says he.

2. He inviteth all sinners, that, for any reason, stand at distance with God,
to come and take from him riches of grace running in Christ as a River to wash
away sin, and to slacken wrath: Come ye to water, says he.

3. Lest any should stand back, in the sense of his own sinfulness or
unworthiness and ina^ility to do any good, the Lord calls upon such persons
in special, saying, He that has no money, come.

^. H^ craveth no more of his Merchant, but that he be pleased with the wares
offered, which are grace and more grace, and that he heartily consent unto, and
embrace this offer of grace, that so he may close a bargain and a formal
Covenant with God^punc; Come, buy without money (says he) Come eat, that is,
consent to have, and take unto you all saving graces, make the wares your own,
possess them, and make use of all blessings in Christ, whatsoever makes for
your spiritual life and comfort, use and enjoy it freely, without paying any
thing for it. Come, buy wine and milk without money and without price, says he,

5. Because the Lord knows how much we are inclined to seek righteousness and
life by our own performances, and satisfaction to have righteousness and
l^fe^punc; as it were by the way of works, and how lo^th we are to embrace
Christ Jesus, and to take life by way of free grace, through Jesus Christ, upon
the tearm^ whereupon it is offered to us, therefore the Lord lovingly calls us
off this our crooked and unhappy way, with a gentle and timous admonition,
giving us to understand that we shall but lose our labor in this our way,
Wherefore do ye spend your money (says he) for that which is not bread, and
your labor for that which satisfies not?

6. The Lord promises to us solid satisfaction, in the way of betaking our
selves unto the grace of Christ, even true c^ntentment, and fullness of
spiritual pleasure, saying, Hearken diligently unto me, and eat that which is
good, and let your soul delight its self in fatness.

6. Because faith comes by hearing, he calls for audience unto the
explication of the offer, and calls for believing of, and listening unto the
truth, which is able to beget the application of saving faith and to draw the
soul to trust in God. Incline your ear and come unto me, says he. To which end
the Lord promises, that this offer, being, received, shall quicken the dead
sinner, and that upon the welcoming of this offer, he will close the Covenant
of Grace with the man that shall consent unto it, even an indissolvable
Covenant of perpetual Reconciliation and Peace, Hearken and your soul shall
live, and I will make an everlasting Covenant with you.

Which Covenant he declares, shall be in substance the assignation, and the
making over of all the saving graces, which David (who is Jesus Christ, Act.
13.34.) has brought for us in the Covenant of Redemption, I will make a
Covenant with you (says he) even the sure mercies of David. By sure mercies he
means saving graces, such as are righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
Ghost, Adoption, Sanctification, and Glorification, and whatsoever belongs to
Godliness, and life eternal.

8. To confirm and assure us of the real grant of these saving mercies, and to
persuade us of the reality of the Covenant betwixt God and the believer of this
word, the Father has made a fourfold gift of his eternal and only begotten Son.

First, to be incarnate and born, for our sake, of the seed of David, his type,
for which cause he is called here, and Act. 13.34. ( David the true and
everlasting King of Israel.) This is the great gift of God to man, John. 4.10.
And here [I have given him to be David, or born of David to the people]

Secondly, he has made a gift of Christ to be a witness to the people, both of
the sure and saving mercies granted to the redeemed in the Covenant of
Redemption, and also of the Fathers willingness, and purpose to apply them, and
to make them fast in the Covenant of Reconciliation made with such as embrace
the offer; I have given him (says the Lord here) to be a witness to the
people: and truly he is a sufficient witness in this manner, in many respects.
1. Because he is one of the Persons of the blessed Trinity, and party
contracter for us, in the Covenant of Redemption before the World was. 2. He is
by Office as Mediator, the Messenger of the Covenant, and has gotten
commission to reveal it. 3. He began actually to reveal it in Paradise, where
he promised that the seed of the woman should bruise the head of the Serpent.
4. He set forth his own death and suff^ring^, and the great benefits that
should come th^reby to us, in the types and figures of sacrifices and
ceremonies before his coming. 5. He gave more and more light (...) this
Covenant, speaking by his Spirit, thou ag^ to age, in the holy prophets. 6. He
came him^^lf (...) the fullness of time, and did bear witness of all things
belonging to this Covenant, and of Gods willing mind to take believers into it,
partly by uniting our nature in one person with the Divine Nature, part^y by
Preaching the good tidings of the Covenant with his own mouth, partly by paying
the price of Redemption on the Cross, and partly by dealing still with the
people from the beginning to this day, to draw in and to hold in the redeemed
in this Covenant.

Thirdly, God has made a gift of Christ, as a Leader to the people, to bring
us through all difficulties, all afflictions and temptations, unto life, by
this Covenant. And he it is, and no other, who does indeed lead his own unto
the Covenant, and in the Covenant all the way on unto salvation. 1. By the
direction of his word and Spirit. 2. By the example of his own life, in faith
and obedience, even to the death of the Cross. 3. By his powerful working,
bearing his redeemed ones in his arms, and causing them to lean on him, while
they go up through the wilderness.

Fourthly, God has made a gift of Christ unto his people, as a Commander;
which Office he faithfully exercises, by giving to his Kirk and people, Laws
and Ordinances, Pastors and Governors, and all necessary Officers, by keeping
Cou^ts and Assemblies among them to see that his Laws be obeyed: Subduing by
his Word, Spirit and Discipline, his peoples corruptions; and by his Wisdom and
power, guarding them against their enemies whatsoever.

Hence he who has closed bargain with God, may strengthen his faith, by
reasoning after this manner.

Whosoever does heartily receive the offer of free grace made here to sinners,
thirsting for righteousness and salvation, unto him by everlasting Covenant
belongs Christ the true David, with all his sure and saving mercies.

But I (may the weak believer say) do heartily receive the offer of free grace,
made here to sinners, thir^^ing for righteousness and salvation.

Therefore unto me, by an everlasting Covevenant belongs Christ Jesus, with
all his s^re and saving mercies.

The second warrant and special motive to embrace Christ and believe in him is
the earnest request that God makes to us to be reconciled to him in Christ,
holden forth, 2 Cor. 5. ver. 14.19.2.21.
GOd was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
trespasses unto them: and has committed unto us the word of Reconciliation.
ver. 20. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you
by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. ver. 21. For he
has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him.

Wherein the Apostle teaches us these nine Doctrines.

1. That the elect World, or the World redeemed souls, are by nature in the
estate of enmity against God. This is presupposed in the word Reconciliation;
for reconciliation, or renewing of friendship, cannot be, except betwixt those
that have been at enmity.

2. That in all the time bypast, since the fall of Adam, Christ Jesus, the
eternal Son of God, as Mediator, and the Father in him, has been about the
making friendship (by his word and Spirit) betwixt himself and the elect World,
God (says he) was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.

3. That the way of reconciliation was in all ages one and the same in
substance, viz. by forgiving the sins of them who do acknowledge their sins,
and their enmity against God, and do seek reconciliation and remission of sins
in Christ, for God (says he) was in Christ reconciling the world to himself,
by way of not imputing their trespasses unto them.

4. That the end and scope of the Gospel and whole word of God, is threefold.

1. It serves to make people sensible of their sins, and of their enmity
against God, and of their danger if they should stand out, and not fear Gods
displeasure.

2. The word of God serves to make men acquainted with the course which God
has prepared for making friendship with him through Christ, viz. That if men
shall acknowledge the enmity, and shall be content to enter into a Covenant of
friendship with God, through Christ, then God will be contented to be
reconciled with them freely.

3. The word of God serves to teach men how to carry themselves toward God,
as friends, after they are reconciled to him, viz. to be loath to sin against
him, and to strive heartily to obey his Commandments, and therefore the Word of
God here is called the Word of Reconciliation, because it teaches us, what
need we have of reconciliation, and how to make it, and how to keep the
reconciliation of friendship, being made with God through Christ.

5. That albeit the hearing, believing, and obeying of this word, does belong
to all those to whom this Gospel does come, yet the Office of preaching of it,
with authority, belongs to none but to such only as God does call to this
ministry, and sends out with Commission for this work. This the Apostle
holds forth, ver. 18. in these words, he has committed to us the word of
Reconciliation.

6. That the Ministers of the Gospel should behave themselves as Christ's
Messengers, and should closely follow their commission set down in the word,
Matthew. 28.19, 20. and when they do so, they should be received by the people,
as Ambassadors from God: for here the Apole, in all their names, says, we are
Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.

7. That Ministers in all earnestness of affections should deal with people, to
acknowledge their sins, and their natural enmity against God more and more
seriously: and to consent to the Covenant of Grace and Embassage of Christ more
and more heartily; and to evidence more and more clearly their reconciliation
by a holy carriage before God. This he holds forth, when he says, we pray
you be reconciled to God.

8. That in the Ministers affectionate dealing with the people, the people
should consider, that they have to do with God and Christ, requesting them by
the Ministers to be reconciled, now there cannot be a greater inducement to
break a sinners hard heart, than Gods making request to him for friendship: For
when it became us, who have done so many wrongs to God, to seek friendship of
God, he preventeth, and (O wonder of wonders!) he requesteth us to be content
to be reconciled wit^ him: and therefore most fearful wrath must abide them,
who do set light by this request; and do not yield when they hear Ministers
with Commission, saying, We are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God.

9. To make it appear, how it comes to pass that the Covenant of
Reconciliation should be so easily made up betwixt God and a humble sinner
fleeing to Christ, the Apostle leads us unto the cause of it, holden forth in
the Covenant of Redemption; the sum whereof is this. It is agreed betwixt God
and the mediator Jesus Christ the Son of God Surety for the redeemed, as
parties contractors, that the sins of the redeemed should be imputed to
innocent Christ, and he both condemned and put to death for them upon this very
condition, that whosoever heartily consents unto the Covenant of Reconciliation
offered through Christ, shall by the imputation of his obedience unto them, be
justified and holden righteous before God, for God has made Christ who knew no
sin, to be sin for us (says the Apostle) that we might be made the
Righteousness of God in him.

Hence may a weak believer strengthen his faith, by reasoning from this ground
after this manner.

He that upon the loving request of God and Christ, made to him by the mouth of
his Ministers (having Commission to that effect) has embraced the offer of
perpetual reconciliation through Christ, and do purpose by Gods Grace, as a
reconciled person to strive against sin, and to serve God to his power
constantly, may be as sure to have righteousness, and eternal life given to him
for the obedience of Christ imputed to him, as it is sure that Christ was
condemned and put to death for the sins of the redeemed imputed to him.

But I (may the weak believer say) upon the loving request of God and Christ
made to me by the mouth of his Ministers, have embraced the offer of perpetual
reconciliation through Christ, and do purpose by Gods gra^e, as a reconciled
person, to strive against sin, and to serve God to my power constantly.

Therefore I may be as sure to have righteousness and ^ternal life given to me
for the obedience of Christ imputed to me, as it is sure that Christ was
condemned and put to death for the sins of the redeemed imputed to him.

The third warrant and special motive to believe in Christ, is the strait and
awful command of God, charging all the hearers of the Gospel to approach to
Christ, in the order set down by him, and to believe in him: holden forth, 1
Ioh. 3.23.
THis is his Commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus
Christ, and love one another, as be gave us commandment.

Wherein the Apostle gives us to understand these five Doctrines.

1. That ^f any man shall not be taken with the sw^et invitation of God, nor
with the humb^e and loving request of God made to him to be reconciled, he
shall find he has to do with the Sovereign Authority of the highest Majesty;
for this is his commandment, that we believe in him, says he.

2. That if any man look upon this Command as he has looked heretofore upon
the neglected Commandments of the Law; he must consider that this is a command
of the Gospel, posterior to the Law, given for making use of the remedy of all
sins; which if it be disobeyed, there is no other Command to follow but this:
Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire of Hell: for this is his commandment: the
obedience of which is most pleasant in his sight, ver. 22. And without which it
is impossible to please him, Heb. 11.6.

3. That every one who hears the Gospel, must make conscience of the duty of
lively faith in Christ, the weak believer must not think it presumption to do
what is commanded: the person inclined to despiration must take up himself, and
think upon obedience unto this sweet and saving command: the strong believer
must dip yet more in the sense of his need he has of Jesus Christ, and more
and more grow in the obedience of this command, yea, the most impenitent,
profane and wicked person, must not thrust out himself, or be thrust out by
others, from orderly aiming at this duty, how desperate soever his condition
seem to be; for he that commands all men to believe in Christ, does thereby
command all men to believe that they are damned and lost without Christ: he
thereby commands all men to acknowledge their sins, and their need of Christ,
and in effect commands all men to repent, that they may believe in him. And
whosoever do refuse to repent of their bygone sins are guilty of disobedience
to this Command given to all hearers, but especially to those that are within
the visible Church, for this is his commandment, that we should believe in the
name of his Son Jesus Christ* says he.

4. That he who ob^yeth this Commandment, has built his salvation on a solid
ground. For first, he has found the promised Messiah, completely furnished
with all perfections unto the perfect execution of the Offices of Prophet,
Priest, and King; for he is that Christ in whom the man does believe. 2. He
has embraced a Savior who is able to save to the uttermost; yea, and who does
effectually save every one that comes to God through him: for he is Jesus the
true Savior of his people from their sins. 3. He that obeys this command,
has bui^t his salvation on the Rock, that is, on the Son of God, to whom it is
no robbery to be called equal to the Father, and who is worthy to be the object
of saving Faith and of Spiritual Worship, for this is his command (says he)
that we believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ.

5. That he who has believed on Jesus Christ (though he be freed from the
curse of the Law) is not freed from the Command and obedience of the Law, but
tied thereunto by a new obligation, and a new command from Christ: Which new
command from Christ imports help to obey the command, unto which command from
Christ, the Father adds his authority and command also; for this i^ his
commandment (says John) that we believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ,
and love one another, as he has Commandded us. The first part of which command
enjoining belief in him* necessarily implies love to God, and so obedience to
the first tab^e, for believing in God, and loving God are inseparable. And the
second part of the command injoyneth love to our neighbor, (especially to the
household of faith) and so obedience unto the second Table of the Law.

Hence may a weak believer strengthen himself by reasoning from this ground
after this manner.

Whosoever in the sense of his own sinfulness and fear of Gods wrath, at the
command of God, is fled to Jesus Christ the only remedy of sin and mis^ry and
has engaged his heart to the obedience of the Law of Love, his Faith is not
presumptuous or dead, but true and saving Faith.

But I (may the weak believer say) in the sense of my own sinfulness and fear
of Gods wrath am fled to Jesus Christ the only remedy of sin and misery, and
have engaged my heart to the obedience of the Law of Love.

Therefore my faith is not a presumtuous and dead faith, but true and saving
faith.

The fourth warrant and spec^al motive to believe in Christ is much assurance
of life given, in case men shall obey the command of believing, and a fearful
certification, of destruction, in case they obey not: holden forth, Ioh. 3.35.
THe Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. ver. 36 He
that believes on the Son has everlasting life, and he that believes not the
Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.

Wherein are holden forth to us these five following Doctrines,

1. That the Father is well satisfied with the undertakings of the Son, entered
Redeemer and Surety to pay the ransom of believers, and to perfect them in
holiness and salvation. The Father loves the Son, says he, viz. As he
stands Mediator in our name, undertaking to perfect our Redemption in all
points. The Father loves him, that is, does heartily accept his offer to do
the work, and is well pleased with him: his soul delights in him and rests
upon him, and makes him in this his Office, the receptacle of love and grace
and good will, to be conveyed by him to believers in him.

2. That for fulfilling of the Covenant of Redemption, the Father has given to
the Son, (as he stands in the capacity of the Mediator) or as he is God
incarnate, (the word made flesh) all authority in Heaven and Earth, all
furniture of the riches of grace, and of spirit and life with all power, and
ability, which the Union of the Divine Nature with the Humane; or which the
fullness of the Godhead, dwelling substantially in his Humane Nature, or which
the indivisible all sufficiency and omnipote^^y of the inseparable, every where
present Trini^^ does import; or the work of Redemption ca^ ^equire; the Father
(says he) has given al^ ^hi^gs into the Sons hand, to wit, for acco^pl^^hing
his work.

3. (...) assurance of life is holden forth to all, who shall heartily receive
Christ and the offer of the Covenant of grace and reconciliation through him,
he that believes on the Son (says he) has everlasting life, for it is made
fast unto him, 1. In Gods purpose, and irrevocable decree, as the believer is a
man elected to life. 2. By effectual calling of him unto life by God, who as he
is faithful, so will he do it. 3. By promise and everlasting Covenant, sworn by
God to give the believer strong consolation in life and death upon immutable
grounds. 4. By a pawn and infestment under the great Seal of the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper, so often as the believer shall come to receive the symbols and
pledges of life. 5. In Christ the fountain and head of life, who is entered in a
possession, as attorney for believers, in whom our life is so laid up, that it
cannot be taken away. 6. By begun possession of spiritual life and
regeneration, and a Kingdom consisting in righteousness, peace, and joy in the
Holy Ghost, erected within the believer, as arles of the full possession of
everlasting life.

4. A fearful certification is given, if a man receive not the Doctrine
concerning righteousness and eternal life to be had by Jesus Christ: he that
believes not the Son, shall not see life, that is, not so much as understand
what it means.

5. He further certifieth, that if a man receive not the Doctrine of the Son of
God, he shall be burdened twice with the wrath of God once as a born rebel by
nature, he shall bear the curse of the Law, or the Covenant of Works; and next,
he shall endure a greater condemnation, in respect that light being come into
the world, and offered to him, he has rejected it, and loves darkness rather
than light, and this double wrath shall be fastened and fixed immoveably upon
him, so long as he remains in the condition of misbelief, the wrath of God
abides on him, says he.

Hence may the weak believer strengthen his faith by reasoning from this ground
after this manner.

Whosoever believes the Doctrine delivered by the Son of God, and finds
himself partly drawn powerfully to believe him, by the sight of life in ^im,
and partly driven by the fear of Gods wrath to adhere unto him, may be sure of
right and interest to life eternal through him.

But, sinful and unworthy I, (may the weak believer say) do believe the
Doctrine delivered by the Son of God, and do feel my self partly drawn
powerfully to believe in him, by the sight of life in him; and partly driven,
by the fear of Gods wrath to adhere unto him.

Therefore I may be sure of my right and interest unto eternal life through
him.

The evidences of true Faith.
SO much for the laying the grounds of faith and warrants to believe: now for
evidencing of true faith by fruits, these four things are requisite. 1. That
the believer be soundly convinced in his judgment, of this obligation to keep
the whole moral Law, all the days of his life: And that not the less, but so
much the more, as he is delivered by Christ from the Covenant of Works, and
curse of the Law. 2. That he endeavor to grow in the exercise and daily
practice of Godliness and righteousness. 3. That the course of his new
obedience run in the right channel, that is, through faith in Christ, and
through a good conscience, to all the duties of love toward God and man. 4.
That he keep strait communion with the fountain Christ Jesus, from whom grace
must run along for furnishing of good fruits.

For the first, viz. To convince the believer, in his judgment, of his
obligation to keep the Moral Law, among many passages, take Matthew. 5.16.
LEt your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father which is in Heaven. ver. 17. Think not that I am come to
destroy the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. ver.
18. For verily I say unto you, till Heaven and Earth pass, one jot or one title
shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfi^led. ver. 19. Whosoever
therefore shall break one of these least Commandments, and shall teach men so,
he shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and
teach them, the same shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven. ver. 20.
For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven.

Wherein our Lord,

1. Gives commandment to believers, justified by faith, to give evidence of
the grace of God in them, before men, by doing good works. Let your light so
shine before men (says he) that they may see your good works.

2. He induces them so to do, by showing that albeit they be not justified by
works; yet spectators of their good works may be converted or edified, and so
glory may redound to God by their good works, when the witnesses thereof shall
glorify your Father which is in Heaven.

3. He gives them no other rule for their new obedience, than the Moral Law,
set down, and explicated by Moses and the Prophets. Think not (says he) that I
am come to destroy the Law, and the Prophets.

4. He gives them to understand that the Doctrine of grace, and freedom from
the curse of the Law, by faith in him, is readily mistaken by men's corrupt
judgment, as if it did loose or slaken the obligation of believers to obey the
commands, and to be subject to the authority of the Law, and that this error is
indeed a destroying of the Law and of the Prophets, which he will in no case
ever endure in any of his Disciples, it is so contrary to the end of his
coming, which is first to sanctify, and then to save believers. Think not
(says he) that I am come to destroy the Law, and the Prophets.

5. He teaches, that the end of the Gospel and Covenant of Grace, is to
procure men's obedience unto the Moral Law, I am come (says he) to fulfill the
Law, and the Prophets.

6. That the obligation of the Moral Law, it^ all points, unto all holy duties,
is perpetual and shall stand to the worlds end, that is, till Heaven and Earth
pass away.

7. That as God has a care of the Scriptures from the beginning, so shall he
have care of them still to the Worlds end, that there shall not one jot or one
title of the substance thereof be taken away, so says the Text, v. 11.

8. That as the breaking of the Moral Law, and defending the transgression
thereof to be no sin, does exclude men both from Heaven, and justly also from
the fellowship of the true Kirk, so the obedience of the Law and teaching
others to do the same, by example, counsel and doctrine, according to every
man's calling, proves a man to be a true believer, and in great estimation with
God, and worthy to be much esteemed of by the true Church, v. 19.

9. That the righteousness of every true Christian, must be more than the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees; for the Scribes and Pharisees,
albeit they took great pains to discharge sundry duties of the Law, yet they
cutted short the exposition thereof: that it might the less condemn the
practice, they studied the outward part of the duty, but neglected the inward
and spiritual part: they discharged meaner duties carefully, but neglected
judgment, mercy and the love of God: In a word, they went about to establish
their own righteousness, and rejected the Righteousness of God by faith in
Jesus. But a true Christian must have more than all this, he must acknowledge
the full extent of the spiritual meaning of the Law, and have a respect to all
the Commandments, and labor to cleanse himself from all filthiness of flesh
and Spirit, and not lay weight upon what service he has done, or shall do, but
cloth himself with the imputed righteousness of Christ: which only can hide
his nakedness, or else he cannot be saved. So says the Text, Except your
righteousness, etc.

The second thing requisite to evidence true Faith, is that the believer
endeavor to put the rules of Godliness and Righteousness in practice, and to
grow in the daily exercise thereof: holden forth, 2 Pet. 1.5.
ANd besides this giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
knowledge, ver. 6. And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance, patience;
and to patience godliness: ver. 7. And to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to
brotherly kindness, charity. ver. 8. For if these things be in you, and abound,
they make you that ye shall neither be barre^ nor unfruitful in the knowledge
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Wherein, 1. The Apostle teaches believers, for evidencing of pious faith in
themselves, to endeavor to add to their faith seven other sister graces: the
first is Virtue, or the active exercise and practice of all Moral duties, that
so faith may not be idle, but put forth it self in work. The second is
Knowledge, which serves to furnish Faith with information of the truth to be
believed; and to furnish Virtue with direction what duties are to be done, and
how to go about them prudently. The third is Temperance, which serves to
moderate the use of all pleasant things, that a man be not cloged therewith,
nor made unfit for any duty, whereto he is called. The fourth is Patience,
which serves to moderate a man's affections, when he meets wi^h any
difficulty or unpleasant thing, that he neither weary for pains required in
well doing, nor faint when the Lord chastises him, nor murmur when he crosses
him. The fifth is Godliness, which may keep him up in all exercises of
Religion, inward and outward, whereby he may be furnished from God, for all
other duties which he has to do. The sixth is Brotherly kindness, which
keeps estimation of, and affection to, all the household of Faith, and to the
image of God in every one wheresoever it is seen. The seventh is Love, which
keeps the heart in readiness to do good to all men, whosoever they be, upon
all occasions which God shall offer.

2. Albeit it be true, that there is much corruption and infirmity in the
godly, yet the Apostle will have men uprightly endeavoring, and doing their
best, as they are able to join all these graces one to another, and to grow in
the measure of exercising of them: giving all diligence (says he) add to your
says, etc.

3. He assures all professed believers, that as they shall profit in the
obedience of this direction, so they shall Profitably prove the soundness of
their own faith, and if they want these graces, that they shall be found blind
deceivers of themselves, ver. 9.

The third thing requisite to evidence true faith is, that obedience to the Law
run in the right channel, that is through faith in Christ, etc. holden forth, 1 Timothy 1.5.
NOw the end of the Commandment is love out of a pure heart, and of a good
conscience and of says unfaigned.

Wherein the Apostle teaches these seven Doctrines.

1. That the obedience of the Law must flow from love, and love from a pure
heart, and a pure heart from a good Conscience, and a good conscience from
Faith unfaigned, this he makes the only right channel of good works, the end
of the Law is Love, etc.

2. That the end of the Law is not that men may be justified by their obedience
of it, as the Jewish Doctors did falsely teach: for it is impossible that
sinners can be justified by the Law, who for every transgression are condemned
by the Law: for the end of the Law is (not such as the Jewish Doctors taught,
but) love out of a pure heart, etc.

3. That the true end of the Law, preached unto the people, is that they, by
the Law, being made to see their deserved condemnation, should fly to Christ
unfaignedly, to be justified by faith in him: So says the Text, while it
makes love to flow through faith in Christ.

4. That no man can set himself in love to obey the Law, except in as far as
his conscience is quieted by faith, or is seeking to be quieted in Christ, for
the end of the Law is love of a good conscience, and faith unfaigned.

5. That feigned faith goes to Christ without reckoning with the Law, and so
wants an errand; but unfaigned faith reckons with the Law, and is forced to
fly for refuge unto Christ as the end of the Law, for righteousness so often
as it finds it self guilty for breaking of the Law: For the end of the Law is
faith unfaigned.

6. That the fruits of love may come forth in act particularly it is necessary,
that the heart be brought to the hatred of all sin and uncleanness, and to a
steadfast purpose to follow all holiness universal; for the end of the Law is
love out of a pure heart.

7. That unfaigned faith is able to make the conscience good, and the heart
pure, and the man lovingly obedient to the Law; for when Christ's blood is seen
by faith to quiet justice, then the conscience becomes quiet also, and will
not suffer the heart to entertain the love of sin, but sets the man on work to
fear God for his mercy, and to obey all his commandments out of love to God for
his free gift of justification by grace bestowed on him: For this is the end of
the Law indeed, whereby it obtains of a man more obedience than any other way.

The fourth thing requisite to evidence true faith is, the keeping of strait
communion with Christ, the fountain of all grace and of all good works: holden
forth, John 15.5.
I Am the true vine, ye are the branches, he that abides in me and I in him,
the same brings forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.

Wherein Christ in a similitude from a vine tree teaches us.

1. That by nature we are wild barren briers till we be changed by coming unto
Christ, and that Christ is that noble vine tree having all life and sap of
grace in himself, and able to change the nature of every one that comes to
him, and to communicate spirit and life to as many as shall believe in him: I
am the vine (says he) and ye are the branches.

2 That Christ loves to have believers so united unto him, as that they be not
separated at any time by unbelief: and that there may be a mutual inhabitation
of them in him by faith and love, and of him in them, by his Word and Spirit,
for he joyneth these together, if ye abide in me and I in you, as things
inseparable.

3. That except a man be ingrafted in Christ and united to him by faith, he
cannot do any the least good work of his own strength: yea, except in as far as
a man does draw spirit and life from Christ by faith, the work which he does is
naughty and null in the point of goodness in Gods estimation, for without me
(says he) ye can do nothing.

4. That this mutual inhabitation, is the fountain and infallible cause of
constant continuing and abounding in well-doing. For he that abides in me, and
I in him (says he) the same bears much fruit. Now as our abiding in Christ
presupposes three things, 1. That we have heard the joyful sound of the Gospel
making offer of Christ to us who are lost sinners by the Law. 2. That we have
heartily embraced the gracious offer of Christ. 3. That by receiving of him we
are become the sons of God, Job. 1.12. And are incorporated into his Mystical
body, that he may dwell in us as his temple, and we dwell in him as in the
residence of righteousness and life, So our abiding in Christ imports other
three things. 1. An employing of Christ in all our addresses to God, and in all
our undertakings of whatsoever piece of service to him. 2. A contentedness with
his sufficiency, without going out from him to seek righteousness or life, or
furniture in any case, in our own or any of the creatures worthiness. 3. A
fixedness in our believing in him, a fixedness in our employing and making use
of him, and a fixedness in our contentment in him, and adhering to him, so that
no allurement, no tentation of Satan or the World, no terror nor trouble may be
able to drive our spirits from firm adherence unto him; or from constant
avowing of his truth and obeying his commands, who has loved us and given
himself for us: and in whom not only our life is laid up, but also the fullness
of the Godhead dwells bodily, by reason of the substantial and personal
union of the Divine and Humane nature in him.

Hence let every watchful Believer, for strengthening himself in faith and
obedience, reason after this manner.
WHosoever does daily employ Christ Jesus for cleansing his conscience and
affections from the guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the Law, and for
making of him to give evidence of true faith in himself.

But I (may every watchful believer say) do daily employ Jesus Christ for
cleansing my conscience and affections from the guiltiness and filthiness of
sins against the Law, and for enabling of me to give obedience to the Law in
love.

Therefore I have the evidence of true faith in my self.

And hence also let the sleepy and sluggish believer reason, for his own
up-stirring thus.

Whatsoever is necessary for giving evidence of true faith, I must study to do
it, except would deceive my self and perish.

But to employ Christ Jesus daily for cleansing of my conscience and affections
from the guiltiness and filthiness of sins against the Law, and for enabling of
me to give obedience to the Law in love, is necessary for evidencing of true
faith in me.

Therefore this I must study to do, except I would deceive my self and perish.

And lastly, seeing Christ himself has pointed this fourth as an undoubted
evidence of a man elected of God unto life, and given to Jesus Christ to be
redeemed, if he come unto him, that is, close Covenant and keep communion with
him, as he teaches us, John 6.37. Saying, All that the Father has given me,
shall come to me, and him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast out. Let
every person who does not in earnest make use of Christ, for remission of sin
and amendment of life, reason hence, and from the whole premises, after this
manner, that his conscience may be wakned.

Whosoever is neither by the Law nor by the Gospel so convinced of sin,
righteousness and judgment, as to make him come to Christ and employ him daily
for remission of sin and amendment of life, he wants not only all evidence of
saving faith, but also all appearance of his election, so long as he remains
in this condition.

But I (may every impenitent person say) am neither by the Law nor Gospel
convinced of sin, righteousness and judgment, as to make me come to Christ and
employ him daily for remission of sin and amendment of life

Therefore I want not only all the evidence of saving faith, but also all
appearance of my election, so long as I remain in this condition.

FINIS.
