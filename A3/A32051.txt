BY THE KING.
A Proclamation for the removing of the Courts King's Bench and of the
Exchequer, from Westminster to Oxford.

WHEREAS the sole power of appoynting the Place or Places in which Our Great
Courts of Justice shall be kept, and of removing them from one place to
another, as urgent occasion shall move Us, by the Laws of this Kingdom is
inherent in Our Royal Person. And whereas it is of great importance to Our
service in these times of difficulty and distraction, to have Our Judges of Our
said Courts to attend near unto Us, by whose advice We may the better proceed
in all those Cases wherein the Judgment and knowledge of the Laws is
required. And whereas more especially the Chancellor, or Lord Keeper of the
Great Seal of England, and the Judges of Our Court, called the King's Bench,
were and are to follow the King; and Our Court of Exchequer, being the proper
Court of Our Revenue, ought to attend Us as We shall appoint. And whereas Our
Cities of London and Westminster have been, and yet are, the chief Causers,
and Maintainers of this prsent Rebellion against Us And We taking into Our
serious consideration, that while Our Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas, and
of Our Exchequer are kept at Westminster, many of Our good and Loyal Subjects
might be compelled or enjoined, by Process in Our name, to make their appearance
there, which they could not do without hazard of Imprisonment, or other
damage or violence from the fomentors of this Rebellion; and many might suffer
prejudice by Verdicts and Judgments had and obtained against them by default
or otherwise, when they could not with safety come to make their just defenses:
thereupon We did resolve to remove those Courts from Westminster to Our City of
Oxford, whether other of Our Courts of Justice have been and are already
removed by Our former Proclamation. And to the end that there might not be any
prejudice to any of Our Subjects, by discontinuance of their Suits in those
Courts or otherwise, We did send Our several Writs of Adjournment, directed to
Our Judges of Our said Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, and to Our
Barons of Out Exchequer, thereby commanding and giving Warrant and authority to
them respectively, to adjourne all Pleas and Prices depending before them, in
and from the Two and Twentieth day of November last past, to the first return
of Hillary Term next, commonly called Octabis Hillarii, to be helden then at
Our City of Oxford. But our Messenger sent with those Writs (as We have been
informed) for no other cause but for doing his duty in carrying and delivering
those Writs, was imprisoned, and in an unjust and illegal way Sentenced to
dye, and brought to a place of execution, and threatened to be Hanged, as at
that time another of Our Messengers for no other cause then for doing his duty
in the like kind, in carrying Our Proclamations to London, was then shamefully
Hanged and Murdered, (an Act so Barbarous as no former age can paraleli) and
We have not yet received any certain and particular information touching the
execution of those Writs. In pursuance therefore of Our former resolution of
removing those Courts from Westminster to our City of Oxford, We do for the
present by this Our Proclamation, authorized under Our Great Seal of England,
Ordain and appoint, and by these presents publish and Declare Our Will and
Pleasure to be, That Our said Courts of King's Bench and Exchequer, shall for
the next Hillary Term, at the usual and accustomed time for holding of the
same, be holden and kept at Our said City of Oxford, and not at Westminster,
and shall be continued and kept there during that whole Term and afterward at
the several times and Terms for holding and keeping of those Courts, until
Our farther pleasure be known and published for removing them from Oxford. And
We do hereby straightly charge and Command, all Our Judges of Our said Court
of King's Bench, and Our Barons of Our Exchequer, and all Officers,
Protonotaries, Clerks, (...)
