C. R.

By the KING.
A Proclamation prohibiting from henceforth all intercourse of Trade between
Our City of London, and other parts of Our Kingdom, until other direction
given by Us.
WHEREAS out of Our tender Care to Our City of London, and in hope to reduce
them to their due obedience to Us, We by Our Proclamation, hearing date at Our
Court at Oxford the eight day of December now last past, did Declare Our Royal
Pleasure to be, That there should be no stop or interruption to any of Our
loving Subjects, as they should travel to Our City of London with any Clothes,
Wares, or Merchandise, but that they should freely and peaceably pass without
any let, trouble or molestation whatsoever; Which Grace and Favor unto them,
have in these many Months wrought this contrary effect, That above all other
paths of this Our Kingdom A prevalent faction of that City (which overrules
the whole) has so far joined with, and in that horrid Rebellion, that it has
denounced war against the whole Kingdom, by violent opposing all the possible
ways to Peace; and so that City formerly famous for their Loyalty, and Love to
their Sovereigns, is now become the head of that Traitorous faction, and the
receptacle of all such as are disaffected to Our Government, and the Laws of
the Kingdom: and not only willingly consents and submits to all burdens and
impositions laid upon them, for the support and maintenance of the Rebellious
Armies raised against Us, but maliciously prosecutes and pursues all such who
are but suspected to wish well to Our Service. And when We pitying the
desperate and deplorable condition of Our People, were graciously pleased to
desire a Treaty for an Accommodation, and propounded that whilst that Treaty
should continue, there might be a cessation of Arms, and a free Commerce for
all Our loving Subjects in all parts of Our Kingdom, that so the benefits of
Trade and Commerce being enjoyed, Our good People might be the more in love
with Peace, yet this motion thus proceeding from Us was nevertheless by
special incitation from the City of London (which by the Grace of Our said
Proclamation enjoyed the said advantage of the whole Kingdom) scornfully
neglected by the enemies of Peace, and all intercourse interdicted to Our City
of Oxford, the present place of Residence for Our Court and Army, and that
restraint is continued upon all those who are thought to be serviceable, or but
well affected to Us: We therefore being thereunto enforced out of this
necessity, and finding that the Trade and Commerce of the Kingdom, which ought
to be maintained for the public benefit of all Our good People, is by this
means inverted only for the advantage of those Places, and Persons which
cherish this Rebellion, the Goods and Merchandise of such who are thought well
affected to Us being seized when they are brought, to London, have thought it
fit and reasonable to revoke and recall that Our former Act of Grace and
Favor. And by this Our Proclamation, We do publish and Declare to all Our
Subjects, That whosoever of them, either in their persons shall from henceforth
travel unto Our City of London, without License from Our Self, or one of Our
Principal Secretaries of State, the Generals, or Lieutenant-Generalls of Our
Armies, or the Governors of any of Our Towns, Castles, or Forts, or with
their Goods, Catle, Victual or Merchandise of any sort whatsoever, shall from
henceforth travel unto, or for Our said City of London or Suburbs thereof,
without Our express License for the same under Our Sign Manual, shall
adventure the same at their own Perils, We being resolved by all possible
means to seize the same; And that all those who from any parts of this Our
Kingdom shall furnish or serve Our said City of London or Suburbs thereof,
either by Sea or Land, with any Victuals, or other Provisions, or with any
Merchandise to maintain them or their Trade, as long as they shall obstinately
stand out in Rebellion aagainst Us, We shall esteem as persons disaffected to
Us, and to Our Government, and as Ayders and Assisters to the Rebels, and
shall accordingly deal with them, and proceed against them: And that this
restraint shall continue upon them until such times as the inhabitants of the
said City, finding their errors, shall return to their due obedience unto us,
straightly commandaig all the Officers of Our Armies, and all other Our Officers,
Ministers, and loving Subjects in all places through which any Person, Goods,
Cattle, Victual, or Merchandise shall pass or be convesed toward the said
City of London, to apprehend the persons, and seize and detain the Goods,
until upon speedy notice to us they shall receive Our further directions: We
hereby assuring them they shall receive part of such Goods so seized in
satisfaction and for their reward. But for the continuing of the general Trade
and Commerce of the Kingdom, and the Manufactures thereof (which We desire to
uphold and advance) We leave all Our Subjects to trade freely in, and unto all
other parts, and if and unto all other Ports, or Havens of this Our Kingdom,
not being in actual Rebellion against Us; and from those Ports to Trade with
their Merchandise freely into any other Parts whersoever beyond the Seas, being
in amity with Us, without any restraint whatsoever.

Given under Our Sign Manuallat Our Court at Oxford this seventeenth day of
July, in the nineteenth year of Our Reign.
