To the READER.
THis Catalogue contains the compleatest Collection of the Common and Statute
Law Books, ancient and modern, that has been hitherto published, or perhaps
will ever be exposed to Sale by way of Auction: So that I may presume to say,
that not one considerable Book of Price, or Use in the whole Body of the Law is
wanting. These Gentlemen were curious in collecting of the ancient, and scarce
Books of the Law, as is obvious to every one that shall please to peruse the
ensuing Names of them, especially of Books of old Customs, Usages, and
Charters; there being no less then three different Editions of that famed Book
of the Customs of Normandy, two of Stebunhith and Hackney; and of the Charters,
of Romeney-Marsh, of the Tinners in Cornwall, etc. with indeed all other Books
that respect the Law, that were useful, and in general Esteem, Which is
Invitation sufficient to all the Gentlemen of the Gown, to buy upon this
occasion, what they cannot so easily meet with, or not at all find, when their
Occasions require, or they are desirous of having them.

This Auction will begin on Monday the second Day of July, 1683, at the first
House on the left hand in Flying-Horse Court, in Fleetstreet, near the
King's Head Tavern at Chancery Lane End; at the Hours of nine in the Morning,
till twelve; and from three in the Afternoon to six. At which Place, and at the
aforesaid Hours, the Books will be exposed to view, for three whole Days before
the Sale, to all Gentlemen that please to inform themselves in the Editions or
Conditions of them.

The Conditions of Sale.
1. That he who bids most is the Buyer; and if any Difference arises, the same
Book or Books to be again exposed to Sale. 2. That the Books in this Catalogue
(not otherwise expressed) are, for ought we know, perfect; but if any of them
appear to be otherwise (before they be taken away,) the Buyer shall have his
choice, whether he will leave or take the same. 3. That the Money for the Book
or Books so bought, is to be paid within a Fortnight after the Auction is
ended, at the Place of Sale, where, upon Payment thereof, the Book or Books
