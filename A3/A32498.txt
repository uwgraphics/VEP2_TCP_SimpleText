A PROCLAMATION For Recalling Proclamations and Orders not agreeable to the
Acts of Navigation, and for Encouragement of Trade
CHARLES R.

WHereas We by an Order in Council of the Five and twentieth of October 1665.
upon the reasons therein expressed, did give Liberty to Merchants, and other
Our Subjects Trading to, and having Goods and Merchandise at Malaga, Alicant,
and other Foreign parts, to return, and bring home their Effects in Ships
belonging to any in Amity with Us, notwithstanding the said Acts; And We did
thereby declare, That when We should think fit to determine that Dispensation,
We would by Our Royal Proclamation give Six Months notice thereof, to the end
no Merchant, or other person therein concerned, should be surprised; Which
Order was not, nor could be intended to give Liberty to any of Our Subjects to
bring in their Goods in Ships belonging to any then in Amity with Us, after
they became Our Enemies: We taking the same into consideration, have thought
fit (with the Advice of Our Privy Council) to publish this Our Royal
Proclamation; And do hereby declare, That the said Order of the Twenty fifth of
October 1665. and the Liberty thereby given, shall from henceforth determine,
and be revoked; Yet so nevertheless, that all such Merchants as upon
encouragement of the forementioned Order, have made use of Foreign Ships as
aforesaid, shall not suffer any prejudice for their so doing, within the space
of Sir Months from the Date hereof. And further, His Majesty does declare,
That all other Proclamations, Orders, and Warrants that have been at any time
issued, or granted upon any occasion whatsoever, during the late War, which do
not agree with, or are in any wise contrary to the said Arts, or either of
them; And all and every the Dispensations, Licenses, Liberties, Clauses,
Matters and Things in the said Proclamations, Orders and Warrants, or any of
them contained, shall from and after the Date hereof, be void, and of no force,
to all intents and purposes whatsoever; Any thing in them, or any of them
contained to the contrary notwithstanding: Whereof all persons concerned are to
take notice, and conform themselves accordingly.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the 30th day of September, 1667.
