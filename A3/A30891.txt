Year 1689.

To The Right Honorable My Very Noble LORD John EARL OF ERROLL LORD HAY and
SLAINS etc. Great Constable of SCOTLAND, AND His Truly Noble and Religious
LADY Anna COUNTESS OF ERROLL
May it please Your HONORS,
I Know it is usual in addresses of this nature, to those who court favor to
themselves, or applause to their Books, to make the utmost stretches, in
complementing those Persons of Quality whose patronage they claim, and to spend
themselves in copious panegyricks fetched from all the Topics of flattery, so
far as they are capable to improve them: But I have the happiness of being fred
from this trouble, you being such as neither need, nor desire to be caressed in
that manner; And I may justly call this an happiness to me, since my natural
temper removes me to the greatest distance from the confines of that service
vice. I can not indeed withold my self from acknowledging, that I owe you all
the expressions of Gratitude which I can never be able to pay; and when I tell
the world, that as you have honors entailed upon you from a long Series of
Illustrious Ancestors, so you are like to transmit them unblemished to your
Posterity, to whose honors it will be an addition, to have it remembered that
they are yours; and that for your Noble Qualities and Virtues, you are justly
esteemed and beloved of all who have the honor of your acquaintance, I am
assured that I do not transgress the Rules of the severest modesty, their is
only one thing which I must utter to your commendation, because it ought not to
be concealed, namely, your being faithful to God and Conscience, in adhereing
to the true Protestant Religion, in a time when many have made defection, and
you have been assaulted with such tentations, as nothing but a brave
Resolution, and a mighty grace could have enabled you to conquer: And tho you
have been happily united, both in the conflict and Victory; yet let it not be
offensive that I relate what part each of you have acted therein, and of this I
shall say nothing but with the assurance of a Witness and with the Ingenuity
becoming a man of my Profession.

Those who understood your Inclinations, knew, that you could have been well
pleased, that the Romish Missionaries would have saved themselves the trouble
of the Visits they made you, And it was the opinion of some who were
sollicitous for your safety, that you should have rid your selves of them, by
denying them access; but as the sweetness of your tempers, does (as it were by
an inevitable force) carry you to deport your selves with an obliging civility
to all persons, so for other weighty considerations, you did not relish that
advice.

Upon you (MY LORD) they did begin to make some direct attempts, to seduce you
from your Holy profession; but Your Lo: took a wise and compendious method to
avoid their snares, by giving them to understand, that your mind was fully
satisfied of the truth of your Religion, and that you had something else to
do, then entangle your self in perplexing debates with them knowing no good
fruit that was to be reaped thereby: This resolute answer, made them perceive,
it was in vain to insist any further that way; but they hoped, by fetching a
compass a little about, to gain more ground.

It has been an old craft of seducers (considering what interest Ladies have
in the affection of their Husbands, and what power with their Children) to make
their utmost essays to proselite them to their Errors, not doubting, but if
they succeed, they shall quickly have the whole family at their Devotion: And
therefore You MADAM was the prize on which they set their eyes; But Your La:
did for see the danger, and provided to encounter it. These Champions of the
Romish Religion who were to make their addresses to you, were given out to be
men of vaste learning and admirable parts (for that is one of the arts of
Papists, as they boast that their Church is infallible, so they would have the
world believe, that their Clergy are an invincible sort of men, that they may
fright those whom they besiege upon the first summonds to make a surrender) you
therefore applied your self to a diligent use of all means, for your
establishment in the Truth, you Prayed, and Read, and conferred, and pondered
deeply the matters of Religion, and thought, all you could do in these ways,
no more then was needful in so weighty an affair. Heaven has endued you with
a great stock of excellent gifts, a composed and comprehensive mind, a
clearness and solidity of Judgment, a deep reach, and readiness of expression,
and these being joined with singleness and sincerity of heart, are such
ramparts and defenses against seduction that they make the Soul almost
impregnable: And that good God, who is never wanting to the assistance of his
faithful Servants, did furnish you with such light, and Grace, that your Faith
has remained unshaken. Those who designed to seduce you, soon percieved, that
they had not to do with a person of an ordinary capacity: Their usual common
places of arguments, they found you could easily answer; and your prejudices
against their Religion though you proposed them only by way of Queries, and
with the modesty of a Learner, were yet so framed, that it was evident to
them, you had so penetrated into the controversies of Religion, that they
thought it a sort of Victory to get of, without being at some visible
disadvantages, and I hardly knew any of them who having once made an essay,
were sond of a second encounter.

The Remembrance of the particular passages of your behavior, is still very
grateful to me, and the relating of them would sure be very pleasing to
others, but your modesty and humility is such, that I may not adventure to
publish them: Only give me leave to say concerning you both, that if either
crastie insiauations, or the charms of friendship, or worldly considerations,
or long importunities, or any thing that could be projected by the wit and
subtility of Seducers, could have corrupted or biased your minds, none of
these methods were left unessayed: And when all these efforts proved
unsuccessfull, and all Topics were exhausted; yet that they might be ever like
themselves; they had the impudence to write, and spread reports to distant
places in this Kingdom, that you were their Converts, or just at the turning
point: Whether this was done out of spite, or to be an Argument, to prevail
with others of a sequacious humor to imitate such noble Precedents I cannot
determine; but this I know that Hell it self could invent nothing more false

The Gracious God has in part rewarded your integrity, and constancy, and I
hope will do it yet more: Your says is strengthened, by these winds of
temptation, you have the joys of a good Conscience, you are hereby endeared to
all serious and Godly persons, and providence has of late interposed to bring
some secular affairs of great concernment to your Noble Family to a
confortable and desired period, and that at a nick of time, when it could
searce have been expected, and a few days longer delay might have quite ruined
them. I hope you will in all this observe the loving kindness of the Lord, and
ever remember your engagements to Jesus Christ who has interceeded for you,
that your says might not fail.

I have little to say concerning this Poem which I offer unto you, I confess it
is a mean present, yet you know its offered from an affectionat mind: After I
had write the first copy of it, I put it immediately in your hands; and you
were pleased to commend it, several copies of it are since spread, of which
some are very incorrect, to do my self justice I have at length resolved to
publish it: It cannot much serve the ends of my reputation, and so I may hope
that it cannot be imputed to vanity. My publishing it under your shadow, can
only signify that which I am well enough pleased the World should know,
namely, that you have a great goodness for me, when I can presume that you will
favorably accept of such a trifile: Gratitude obliges me to make you richer
offerings, but I have them not to make; my Prayers to God for you, are the best
compensations I can give for your favors to me, and these are, and daily shall
be offered up unto Heaven, for the prosperity of your Souls, the increass of
your grace and the flourishing of your Noble Family by

RIGHT HONORABLE, (YOUR HONORS) Most Affectionat, Most Oblidged and Humble
Servant, JOHN BARCLAY.

To the Reader
I Can not persuade my self that any have just reason to be offended with me,
or to clamor, that it is a thing unsuitable to a man of my Profession to
expose a Religion so Zealously mantained and propagated by so many great and
learned men, in such a dress as this: All that I shall say for my own
vindication is, that I am none of those that sport my self with the sins and
miseries of Mankind, and I ever abborred these jests which idle and profane
wits do break upon serious matters, that are not to be jested with:
Nevertheless, when a Party of men have under the venerable name of the Holy
Catholic Church so grossly abused the World, imposing on the belief of their
credulous Disciples, so many Reverend Absurdities, and perspicuous falsehoods,
and recommending to their practice, such superstitious trifles, and ridiculous
fopperies, unbeseeming the gravity of the Christian Religion, to give a just
representation of them in this manner, is a thing that may have it is own
usefulness, especially since it may be presumed, that many will read a Poem,
who will not set their eyes on a more serious Book. I have only therefore a few
things whereof to advertise thee concerning it.

Namely. That I have in a few passages of it taken a liberty to my self, in a
Poetical manner to intermix some of my own fancies, yet not without design.
As, when I produce an argument for the Caelibate of the Clergy, which I know
they never made use of, but let it be remembered that this is a Dream, and the
it were not, yet since they make such other inferences from that Text as I have
there mentioned, I suppose they might draw this Conclusion from it, as well as
the rest, and for any thing I know, it is an Argument against the marriage of
Church men of as great force, as any that they have heretofore hit upon.

But in truth my aim is to show what ridiculous interpretations of Scripture
these pretended infallible expounders of it, do often make. He who will prove
the Popes supremacy from Genes. 1. 1. Because it is there said In principio,
and not in Principiis (as Pope Boniface does) or his Precedencie to the
Emperor from Genes. 1. 16 Where it is said, that GOD made two great lights,
(as Pope Innocent 3) or his Civil and Ecclesiastic power, from Ecce duo
gladii: or the necessity of the Celibate of the Clergy. From Romans 8. 8. (as
Pope Siricius) I think may prove Quidlibet ex Quolibet. I have mentioned a
Relic which they pretend not to have; but in that I mean only to show in
whole manner these little wondrous things are usually alleged to be found.

All the Sirs which I say they call Venial; are by their Casuists put in that
rank: and that they account it much more Criminal, to neglect the observation
of the Traditions of the Church, then to break the Commandments of GOD, is so
well known, that it needs no prooff.

I have spoken at length of their Religious Houses and Orders, they being the
only things they boast of that have any show of Sanctity, and to evidence that
I meant nothing but fair dealing, I have not equally inveighed against all
persons among them.

The words of their Mystic Divinity that I have mentioned, are to be found
every one of them in their own books, with a great many more which I could not
get brought into verse. Thebodde talkings which they have of the
Superessentiall Life. The State of Totalitie, The Union of Nothing with
Nothing, The Dei-forme Fund of the Soul etc. I could no more make Rhyme, then
they can make Reason of them.

When I reflect on the rude disorders of some who betake themselves to the
Religious Houses. I do not slander them, the Epistle of Huldericus Bishop of
Augusta, to Pope Nicolas, wherein he tells of six thousand heads of Infants
found in one Mote, gives sufficient ground for the reproach.

I wrote this Poem in the Year 1679. When these Nations were allarmed with the
noise of the Popish plot. And I thought to have enlarged more on that Subject,
but ere I finished it, that began to be a suspect business, and it was come to
that which on ingeniously expresses thus.

That Shams with Shams, and Plots with Plots were cross't, And the true Plot,
among the false was lost.

If any expect that I should make an Apology for publishing it, the
Common-Heads of excuse in these cases are well enough known, and I may pretend
to have an equal right to them with other Men.

If their be any thing in it, that may be offensive to the severest modesty, I
shall be ready (upon conviction) to acknowledge my faultiness therein; but for
my little extravagancies, that may be found here. I hope thy censure will be
gentle, for it any sort of men have reason to expect some charitable allowance
for escapes, it can hardly be denied to A Dreaming Poet.

Farewell.
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH Described in a VISION.
I Find I Am haunted with a busy mind,
Swift as the Clouds, unstable as the wind,
It sometimes gets it Wings, and soars aloft,
Anon it steeps into delights more soft,
It Is sometimes serious, and it is sometimes vain,
Sometimes it is thoughts do please, and sometimes pain;
On while they are dark, and then they clear again;
Sometimes they are cheerful, sometimes they are sad;
They Are sometimes good, and often they are bad;
Sometimes, my self, my self's their only Theme,
Sometimes, they grasp at more then Caesar's claim:
They bring forth Joy, they nowrish Fear,
They Towers into the Air do rear,
All things do seem within their Sphere:
O what a wandering thing's the Mind!
What Contrares are there combined?
HOw shal't be held, or where confined?
O what a Web's a busy Thought!
Where is it made? whence is it brought?
How is it warpt, how is it wrought?
While thus my Mind was in this roving plight,
I did it chide, for it is uncertain flight,
I strove to settle it with all my might:
At length we did some composition make,
And it began some rest to take,
To be more plyant for good manners sake:
I firmly with my self did then conclude,
I would repair unto some solitude,
Beneath a pleasant Tree my Lodge I made,
Became the Tennant of it is cooling Shade,
Here (said I) I my self will shroud,
From scoarching Beams, from dropping Cloud,
Here shall I rest; and shall be free
From this Earth's noise, which seems to me
A blunt, a dull, ill-acted Comedy:
It Is Pleasnres I Will not prise,
It Is Honors I Will despise,
And all it is Wealth, as Dross I will disdain,
My Mind Religious Thoughts shall intertain.
RELIGION (thought I) is the way to Rest,
RELIGION is the choice that is surely best,
It raises no Commotions to infest,
It stills the noise of Passions and of Rage,
And turbulent Affections does assuage
It cools Youth, it is Comforts warm Old Age:
But lo again my Thoughts did range,
This lovely thing it is shape did seem to change,
In many Forms it did to me appear,
And many various Garbs I saw it wear,
I saw it fight in Fields, and making Wars,
I heard it scold in Schools, and raising Jarres:
A thousand different Parties cried, lo here
Thou'l't find the thing, should be to thee most dear,
Whom shall I hear? where shall I go?
What shall I choose? what shall I do?
I Am puzzled, and amazed too,
I love RELIGION, and I would her serve,
But while I seek Her, fear from Her to swerve.
While I am in this Labirinth involved,
The more I por'd, the less my Doubts were solved,
And to make yet more serious search resolved:
Sleep, (that great lovely thief, which often robs
Mine Eyes of vexing Sights, mine Heart of Sobs,
Which from my Books does steall away mine Eye,
And often from my Prayers steals me)
Came gliding on, and did me quite o'r shade,
With a thick Cloud of misty Vapors made:
Mine Eyes were shut, mine Ears were stopped,
My Hands were tied, my Senses locked,
The House was silent, Gates were blockt:
And now WILD FANCY did begin her Game,
And plays her self, with things I cannot name,
Things so many, and so strange,
Things that Shape and Color change,
Things which without Order range;
Yet still me thought RELIGION I did view
And did Her with some amorous thoughts pursue,
Amongst all that Crowd, I knew Her lovely hue.
She did Her self shift from among the Crowd,
I saw Her go, cried after Her aloud,
I called to Her, For Love and Pity stay,
Besought Her that She would not say me Nay;
But Wind, bore Her and my lost words away:
And when She Is gone, I found into Her room
A throng of wild, unruly things did come,
Roving Fancies, Horrid Sights,
Dismal Places, Uncouth Wights
Which put me in a wondrous plight
I Will tell what I can mind, and it is no Crime,
Of incoherent things to speak, in incoherent Rhyme.
I saw A CITY, very Great and Fair,
With which, scarce any other might compare,
Whose proud Walls, did all Batteries defy,
Whose prouder Towers, seemed to affront the Sky;
To him I first did meet What CITY'S this, said I?
A Question indeed said he! For this
No single CITY, but the whole World is.
I saw A MAN, in more than Kingly State,
And thousands, did his dread Command await,
Yet did his grifly Face, his panting Breath,
His failing Limbs, bewray the approach of Death:
But soon I found, that he was vile and proud,
He raised his Eyes, and spoke odd Words aloud
Of BULLS, and BRIEVES, and CANONS, and CROISADES
And whispered some Tales of WHORES and BAUDES,
And Stories, which imported nothing less
Than that He was grow'n old in Wickedness:
I ask't, What wretch was that who passed by?
And presently they made a dreadful Cry,
And said, I did blaspheme,
And spoke prophanly of an Heavenly Name,
Since Divine Honors were his rightful Claim.
I saw some YOUTHS; for I could guess
No other, by their beardless Face,
I heard them talk what I thought hardly Sense,
Yet talk; with an unblushing confidence:
What Striplings (said I) do yonder walk?
What new, unheard of Stories do they talk?
They called me mad, and said, they were
All REVEREND FATHERS I saw there,
And that the things they gravely told,
Were Mysteries, delivered of old,
Which the Apostles left them to unfold.
A PACK of IDIOTS next I saw,
For so I thought them; but I stood in awe
To call them so, till I did see
Them at their Childish plays to be,
Some were dandling painted babies,
Some numbering BEEDS, and telling GADIES,
Some mumbling GIBBERISH and such uncouth leid,
As no where else did I e're hear or read,
Alace what do these poor Fools? did I say,
Vile man (said they) they worship and they pray,
See what Devotion their looks do bewray.
To them some HELL HOUNDS did succeed,
Their eyes were sunk, their hands were red,
Their words were dreadful, threats were loud,
Their looks were grim, they breathed blood,
I saw them bring forth from dark Shopes,
Wheels and Racks, and Cords, and Ropes,
They gathered fuel, kindled fire,
And fastened stakes, I did enquire
What all these dreadful things did mean?
More dreadful then mine eyes had ever seen:
They told me, these were persons, whose great zeall
Did always level to the Churches weall,
And that these Tools, whose sight did shake mine heart,
Were instruments, by which they did convert
Men to the Faith: So they and I did part.
Sure (said I) I Am in some enchanted land,
Of all I see, I nothing understand,
What shall I think! O that some Angel would
These hidden wondrous things to me unfold,
For it is a work above all humane reach
Mine eyes to open, or my mind to teach.
While thus I Am wondering, and am bathed in tears,
A Gentle voice arrived to mine Ears,
From whence I know not; but the words were these,
Young man, thy wonder, and thy weeping cease,
What thou shall see, shall serve well to explain
What thou have seen: A little while again
It silent was; At length did only say,
Take Heed, Take Heed, see that thou watch and pray,
I heard no more, it vanished away.
I quite confounded lay, my mind was vex't
With thoughts confused, and with dark fears perplexed;
When lo, I wildly roll mine eyes, and see
That which a little calmed and cheered me;
A LADY, walking with a comely grace,
All beauties seemed combined in her face,
She courteously approached to the place,
Where I did now my self repose,
Which when I saw I humbly arose.
I am persuaded, that in man must be
An untaught skill of PHYSIOGNOMIE;
For when I at a distance did behold
This sumptuous DAME, attyr'd in Pearls and Gold,
I thought, such beauty was unseen before,
And that mine eyes should see the like no more,
I would have named all things in Heaven and Earth,
All that is pryz'd by Fancy, Wit, or Dearth,
To see if any thing I could compare
Unto a Creature, whom I thought so fair;
But as I did Her more distinctly view,
I thought my self deceived; sure (said I) now
Their's no such substance here, as there is show,
I know not what displeased me; but I wot
Something was in her face I liked not.
Yet wisely I concealed my distaste,
And seemed, mine Eyes upon her Eyes to feast,
At length I said GREAT LADY, pardon me
If I so rude, or so uncivil be
As to enquire your Name and Quality.
She courteously and modestly replied,
In this demand thou shall not be denied,
I all men's good and happiness intend,
To this, my thoughts, to this my aims I bend,
If thou be wise, and hearken unto me,
Thou seems perplex't; but thou may happy be.
Her words did charm me so, that I began
To chide my self, and say, Untoward man,
This is an ANGEL; what ill GENIUS brought
A disesteem of Her into thy thought?
I work my woe, she is fond to have me blessed,
I toil for Cares, she comes to give me rest,
She loves me; I distaste her in my mind,
How bold our passions are, and yet how blind!
These were the secreet workings of my breast,
My longings now to hear Her, were increast,
And she went on
And thus she spoke in an alluring tone:
I am THE HOLY CATHOLICK-CHURCH (said she,)
The porch of Heaven; none go there but from me:
And now I come to be A Guide to thee:
I saw thee lately cast thine Amorous eyes
Upon RELIGION, and I heard thy Cries,
She seemed to leave thee, and would make no stay,
Went out of sight, thou know not what way,
I know her path, to Her I will thee lead,
I listened well to all that she had said,
I Bowed mine Head, and low obeisance made,
Blessed now (said I) the day that I was born,
No longer will mine heart be racked and torn,
With doubts and Scruples, and with anxious cares,
With sinking fears, and languishing despaires.
Mine Eyes again I lift unto her face,
To fix them ever in that lovely place;
I rubbed mine Eyes, I thought they were diseased,
The more I looked, the more I was displeased:
I thought Her sometimes too Gay, to be Good,
Her Brow Imperious, and Her Looks too Proud,
Her Color oftener changed, then I can tell,
Her Breath (I judged) had an envenomed smell:
These things did somewhat cool my confidence,
And brought me in a very great suspense,
It is not good to be too Rash (said I)
It Is Good before I trust too much, to try.
She was sagacious, and soon found me out,
Uncertain Breath, and Looks bewrayed my doubt,
What means this Coldness (said she) Youth? mine hand
She grasp't, and ask't what meant I thus to stand?
Did I not to thee joyful tidings bring?
Is happiness to thee so small a thing?
Just now thou seemed inflamed with desire
To learn the way to Bliss, who quenched that fire?
Thy sails were hoysed, and thou seemed clear,
Unto RELIGION as thy port to steer,
I who esteem thy happiness my gain,
To be thy Pilot, I did not disdain.
I Am for the Voyage (said I) But it is fit
To know my Pilots skill, for fear I split,
For in RELIGION there are many Cheats,
No fewer then their are in Courts and States,
Each painted HARLOT, calls her self the Spouse,
And with the name of CHURCH, does Men amuse,
And therefore I again would hear your Name
And by what Right, you to that Honor Claim:
My Warrines She seemed to applaud,
And said, I might suspect from others Fraud;
But that HER WORD, might be sufficient,
To clear my mind, to clear her just intent,
For others do acknowledge they may Err;
But I my self Infallible aver,
And that thou may the more assured be,
I am the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, (said She)
That is my Name: (said I) their's on Word more
Now in your Name, then I did hear before,
And that same Word, (which makes me yet more Shy)
Does seem a Contradiction to imply:
Roman and Catholic, how can that consist?
In different Categories they themselves do list.
She froun'd, and then disdainfully. She smiled,
And said Poor Man, how far ar't thou beguiled,
Thy throat's too narrow, and thy Wit's too shallow,
If thou one Contradiction can not swallow;
That Is but a Gnat; go with me silly fool,
And I again will set thee to the School:
Once learn but to believe, I cannot Err,
A thousand Contradictions then Infer,
These triffles, will thee never more Deter.
My Pleas are great, for all I do pretend,
Mine Arguments are Infinite, without end,
Without beginning; then She stretched Her voice,
And made into mine Ears a dreadful noise;
What (said She) knows thou not mine Unity,
My SANCTITY my great ANTIQUITY
My MULTITUDE, My VISIBILITY,
My MIRACLES, SUCCESSION, yea my Name
Of CATHOLIC, does justify my Claim,
And therefore, now will I
I Will make the World, and thee to hear, I Will Cry
I Will thunder my INFALLIBILITY
But lest my words do not affect thine Heart,
That I more knowledge may to thee impart,
Make no delay; but quickly follow me,
And thou shal't be instructed by thine Eye,
Thou Wilt see RELIGION in her Glorious dress,
And by that sight, thy Love will much increase.
I Will lead thee first unto my Glorious HEAD,
In whom what Glory dwells, cannot be said,
Thou Wilt see, Thou Wilt wonder, thou shal't hear his words,
They Will charm thine Ears, they will pierce thine heart as swords,
They are all Oracles. O my Glorious HEAD?
I found She still inclined to proceed
Into his praise: And therefore I
Who had enough of curiosity,
To see Gay sights, did passionatly cry
O Lead me, I will follow instantly.
We spoke no more, but in a little space,
She bid me look to that resplendent place,
Lo that is the Palace, unto which we go,
It Is Name She told me was SAINT ANGELO.
Thither we came, and quickly entrance got,
MY GUIDE was there well known, tho I was not,
To Her they Bowed, to Her all homage paid,
And to the Palace we were straight conveyed:
I looked with a curious Strangers Eye,
Observing all things which I there did see,
The rooms, were stately which I did behold,
All paved with Marble, and all siel'd with Gold,
Which Struck with rays, reflected such a light,
As did at once please and confound my sight:
But that wherewith mine eyes I longest fed,
Was pictures wherewith they were garnished,
And these were draw'n and were colored so,
I doubted if they were alive or no.
Here was a judge, who on his bench did sit,
A mighty throng of men encompassed it,
I saw them gape, perceived they cried aloud
Away with him, and on us be his Blood;
I saw the man against whom they were so bent,
His looks, bespoke him wholly innocent;
They told me that was JESUS, whom I spied,
And these were Jews who thus against him cried,
I well took heed to all,
And thought, I Am now in Pilates Iudgement-Hall:
The manner of Christ's death, I saw so plain,
How he was mocked, how men did him disdain,
How he was stripped, and scourged, and crowned with thorn,
How he came forth, and how his Cross was born;
How he was pierced, and how he bowed his head,
That to my self with confidence I said,
Or here is the place in which my Lord was slain
Or else I Am sure he is murdered here again.
I was the more confirmed in this thought,
When to another little room I Am brought,
They showed me there, the tree that once him bo^^
The Nails, and Spear, which did his Body gore,
And all the cruel instruments of death,
By these (said they) he was bereaved of Breath:
I made no doubt, when I saw all entire,
But that the Executioner was also here.
MY GUIDE bids me go on, at length, did bring
Me, to her so much celebrated King;
He smiled on Her, and though he knew not me,
All Is welcome whom ye bring with you said he.
She told him that I was a Stranger, whom
She had desired along with her to come,
And to be blessed by seeing of his face,
And by his words to be inspired with grace;
Knowing, my doubts should be dispelled that hour,
That I shoud be informed of his power:
He bids me then draw near,
And thank the Heavens, and her who brought me here,
And as an introduction to my bliss,
He stretched out his foot to me to kiss.
To say the truth when I observed his face,
I thought it boaded very little grace;
His eyes were lofty, sparkling, full of wrath,
Upon his brow (me thought) at rage and death,
For he was very wrinkled, very pale,
His hands did tremble, and his limbs did faill.
A saw A TRIPLE CROWN upon his Head.
With some Inscriptions, which I longed to read:
Which that I might the better understand,
I did presume to draw some nearer hand:
What see I now?
It Is Holiness, that blurred word I trow,
It Is Blasphemy fair written on the brow,
It Is written here, SERVUS SERVORUM,
It Is written there DOMINUS DOMINORUM,
And 'twixt each word was written MYSTERY,
And Reason for it; for so was all to me.
Some while, I nothing did but looked, and gazed,
The more I looked, the more I was amazed;
He did interpret this my deep suspense,
To be the fruit of profound Reverence:
Some words at length he did begin to mutter,
But for some space, no sentence might he utter,
So Violent a cough did him assaill,
As stopped his speech, and made his breath to faill,
Which when it ceased, he made no longer stay,
But raised his head, and Eyes, and thus did say.
I Am He, that makes my dreadful Curses fly
Throughout the Earth, and penetrat the Sky,
Through Walls of stone these furious bullets may
Without controull force their impetuous way:
When I proclaim a Jubilee, all sin
Is quite discharged, and wealth to me comes in:
I can dispense with all the Laws Divine,
Cause sons against Parents fearlesly combine,
I say, and many swear that all the world is mine:
When I in Pomp do go,
Poor Kings, as pageants do attend the show:
When I decree, soon does a busy swarm
Of Black, White, Gray-Friars take alarm,
Men of all Colors, who can open breasts,
And creep into the most retired rests.
They cry, Thus has our HOLY FATHER said,
Who trembles not? who does not bow the Head?
Who does not profoundest homage pay?
Who dare once doubt the truth of what I say?
Garments of richest crimpson I do wear,
And Crowns of purest beaten gold I bear:
Heaven and Hells gates, it is vaults, and Cells all be
Shut or made open, as it pleases me:
None, dare be so presumptuous or bold
Amongst Mortals, to repine, or to withhold
From me their Conscience or their Gold:
If to infernal flames I thousands lead,
What do thou? should by no man be said:
If Virtues, Sins, or Sins, I Virtues call,
My words should firmly be believed by all
I can make Saints, I can make Kings,
I can make Him who made all things,
I can give others power to make him,
And give to thee the privilege to take him:
Blood I can make of Wine, and Flesh of Bread,
When I have but a very few words said,
I squeeze the living, to relieve the dead.
I Hallow all things with my words
I Hallow Helmets, Hallow Swords,
I Hallow Trees, I Hallow Stones,
I Hallow dry and rotten Bones;
I Hallow Meddalls, Hallow Oil,
I Hallow Water, Hallow Soil,
I Hallow Salt I Hallow Cells,
I Hallow Kirks, I Hallow Bells,
So strong and mighty are my spells,
That I with very little ado
Could Hallow Brothell-Houses too.
Commit thy self to me, then do not fear,
No Oath shall ty thee, thou may freely swear,
And freely break, this shall be thy defense,
How often thou swears, so often I can Dispense:
Be thou once mine, and from that happy time
Thou needst not stand in dread of any crime;
The greatest sins thy bliss shall not prejudge,
For my INDULGENCE shall be thy Refuge:
But as thou would avoid my heavy Curse,
Come never to me with an empty purse.
I longed to hear him speak; but longed sore
To hear him make an end, and speak no more:
At length, he fell a Coughing once again,
And only spoke these broken words with pain;
Shrew on this Phlegm, that dare assault my throat,
And stop my sacred breath; for did it not,
I Have more to say, and thou should hear a shoure,
Of mighty words, to show my mighty power.
I stood a while, Heart, Hand, and all was gone
I feared me transubstantiat to a stone,
My tender Stomach turned to see him spit,
My tender Conscience was fright out of wit;
I found my self in an unusual stir,
At last I modestly did say, Great Sir,
If Greater Titles I do not bestow
On you, I hope your Clemency you will show,
For that is the Greatest Title, that I know
Due unto men below:
Fellow (said he) thou should have called me
A GOD ON EARTH, for no less will I be,
I Am CHRIST'S VICAR, and who dare say less
To me, then, May it please your Holiness?
I as a wretched Heretic should thee use;
But Ignorance shall thee this once excuse:
I would I were away (thought I)
I fear he will force to Blaspheme, or die.
I spoke no more, until he gave command,
And bids me boldly propose my demand;
For now I Am in my SACRED CHAIR (said he,)
All 's Oracles* that now does flow from me:
The thing (said I) which I would gladly know,
Is, who did this great power on you bestow?
Some will deny't and some perhaps will flout it,
And how shall I convince one, who does doubt it?
I do not (said He) things uncertain boast,
I have convinced many to their cost
Of my great power; But would thou know it is spring,
I from SAINT PETER, He from Christ did bring
This Privilege; and did thou never read
That Christ bid him, His Sheep, his Lambs go feed?
Is not this in the Bible? Ah said I,
Upon that Book I dare not set mine eye,
Lest it pervert me into Heresy:
It Is true (said He) it is dangerons for thee;
But yet thou sees, this Text does speak for me,
Hear, I Will expound it now Infalliblie.
By SHEEP and LAMBS, all Men are understood,
Kings, Subjects, Churchmen, Laymen, Bad, and Good:
To Feed them, Is a word, will comprehend,
As much as thou can think or I intend:
First it imports, that I must Rule them all,
And they must Trust me, and obey my call,
They Are not right Sheep, if they once think they are free
To question mine INFALLIBILITY:
If Emperors, or Kings, shall disobey
These Rams-Horns, then its just that I should fray:
Then, all their Fleeces do to me belong,
And though my Sheirs go near, I do no wrong;
Yea I may some not only Fleece; but Flay,
And what is not fit to live, may justly Slay:
Such as I please I Weddens may create,
This warrants; well the Clergies Celibate:
And to conclude; for thou shall not be vex't
With all that may be said from this on Text,
If any do deny the power I claim,
I may send out my Dogs to worry them.
When thus he had me taught, he did expect
That I should thank him with profound respect;
And so I did: For gravely I did seem
To have each word he spoke in great esteem:
I told him I was raped in Admiration,
(I had no will to call it Veneration)
Of all I saw and heard, and well I wot
I spoke even as I thought, I lied not:
For wondrous was the preaching I did hear,
Th'Inscriptions wondrous which his Crowns did bear,
The Garb was wondrous which I saw him wear,
And wondrous were his Boasts, and wondrous was his Chair:
I well remember, of THE CHAIR I said
That of the Tree of Knowledge it was made,
It Is Back, and Boughs, did such learned notions give,
It Is Seat and Stoops were so Demonstrative:
He smiled at this, and nothing more did say,
I humbly took my leave, and went away.
MY GUIDE perceived, I did not well digest
The scalding dishes of this sumptuous feast,
She told me, that She well in mind did bear
The words, I uttered of the SACRED CHAIR;
And what I spoke of the forbidden Tree,
Assured her that the fruit displeased me:
Yet ceased she not, HER HEAD still to commend,
And bid me mind, how he did condescend
To teach poor me; She praif'd his Majesty,
And much applauded his Humility,
And said, I should be with much knowledge fraught,
If I remembered well what he had taught.
I promised that I should all retain,
And then I said, this GREAT KING I have seen,
But yet I would see more, theirs much report,
That to his COURT, all Nations do resort,
If there be great, Good, Wise men any where,
I am assured that they must be there;
And I am fond to see such Glorious sights,
May now mine eyes be bless't with those great lights*
She much applauded this my good design,
And promised, she would me thither bring,
I was well pleased to find her so benign,
Ready to humor me in every thing.
She brought me to a GLORIOUS COURT indeed,
In all things corresponding to it is HEAD,
Each Man was more then princely whom I saw,
And every object there, mine eyes did draw,
To all I crieng'd, of all I stood in awe:
Some had most sharp and piercing looks,
Some, Tongues more eloquent then Books,
I never saw, until that day,
So many in such gorgeous array,
I madly said, O that it might be ay
My Lot into this Paradise to stay.
Thus brain sick was I, thus my thoughts did roam,
And I had much ado to force them home,
I could not think, but men in such a state
Must surely be as good as they are great,
Or that unto the Bad, Wise Providence
Should all that is goodly in the Earth dispense.
It Is easy, when a man's in solitude,
To slight the gaudy World, to conclude
That all it is pomps, and Riches, are but lies,
An heap of gilded worthless vanities
And to contemn the flattering breath of fame,
The foolish whistlings of an honored name,
And hate that wild ambition, which with force
Does ride, and spurus, like unruly horse,
And these imperious lusts, which often cause
Men break all bonds, and trample on all Laws;
But things, we at a distance can despise,
When they approach us, do bewitch our eyes,
And charm our hearts, so strong's the snare,
So weak our minds, so faint our care,
So soon our resolutions do impair,
That were entangled, e're we be aware.
The scattered beams of my power reasons light,
At length united, and did Shine more bright;
E're I my self should with these men imbark,
I did resolve their manners well to mark:
Each of them did RELIGION much commend,
And in Her service vowed their lives to spend,
They said She taught them on such wealth to seize,
She did them to so great preferments raise,
She did procure them all these golden days:
Is It so? (thought I) then sure She is become
A kinder mistress, then she was to some
Who served her very faithfully of old,
To whom She gave no scarlet, gave no Gold,
But set them unto harder tasks then so,
All scorn, and all reproach to undergo,
Into all tempests, and rough seas to row,
Unto all wants, and to all death's to bow;
But since She uses these her Minions better,
Does with silk cords them to her service fetter,
If they deserve these favors, surely then
Their lives will prove, they are the best of men:
But when I had discovered their way,
By curious search, I to my self did say,
Is this THE HOLY COURT, where I have been?
Are these RELIGIONS DARLINGS, I have seen?
All here, are Masters of the art of sin,
They scarce have more of men, but shape and sikn;
They seem to be incarnat Furies all,
Or by what other name shall I themcall?
Gain, Honor, Pleasure, I see them implore,
No other Gods I think they do adore,
They looked not up to Heaven; but when they swore:
They often met, did often counsel take,
How they might all men their own subjects make,
And in their Consultations, did pretend,
That to advance RELIGION was their end:
RELIGION'S sacred name did cloak all things,
And they made it a Stall to all designs:
I marked them well, I found they were a Crew
Whose Eyes and Faces, were of yellow hue,
The love of Gold, (That jaundise of the Soul)
Had made their Visage odiously feul:
Vices I never heard of here I found,
Men who unto their pleasures set no bound;
With Floods of Wine, they drowned all their cares,
And did with Music over-noyse their fears:
Some the Buffoons here did play,
Some, poor Orphans did betray,
Some, projected by each Cheat,
How they might be rich or great,
They nothing did account unjust,
Might serve their humor or their lust;
Freely their Souls and Consciences they sold,
To ly on Beds of Silk, and heap up Gold;
Vice seemed to be their ^^lly occupation,
No word they loathed so much as REFORMATION
The CARD'NALL VIRTUES, I could tell before;
But CARD'NALL VICES, I found many more
Than I could number: Better be alone,
Then in this Court (said I) I will be gone.
MY GUIDE displeased was, to see, that I
So narrowly did into all things pry;
Some little Touch of Learning She did find
I had, and therefore to divert my mind,
Desired, that now I would HER SCHOOLS go view,
The Shops of Learning (said She) would me show:
I lyk't the motion, and alledg't that She
No greater favor could procure to me.
This sight at first did give me great content,
I thought I was into mine Element:
Men of Prodigious Learning, I saw there,
Prodigious heaps of Books, lay every where;
I saw some writting Volumes (I confess)
Which I did judge, would over-load the Press;
Some scraped out lines, some rent out leaves of Books,
Which pleased them not, (as I thought by their looks)
What meant that Havoc I conceived not,
They said, THEY PURGED WHAT THE FATHERS wrote,
Because in many things, they well did see
Their Books inclyn'd to favor Heresy:
Some took Old Parchment and did write on it,
In Antique letters, what they judged fit,
I asked what they wrote? It was, (they said)
Grave Old Traditions, new come in their head,
And by these suddled Parchments, men would see
These were the Doctrines of Antiquity,
For whatsoever the present Church does hold,
Must be believed to be very old,
I did admire their Wit; but could not be
Well satisfied with their Honesty.
I left the SCHOOLS, and to MY GUIDE did say
That I inclined to go to CHURCH, and pray
It was a very Solemn Holy Day;
And by my longing, thither was I led
To see the manner how they worsh ped.
The CHURCH was sumptuous, unto which I went,
No cost was spared for it is Ornament,
When I went in, about the walls around
Ca^ved and painted IMAGES I found
The Pictures of All Saints did here appear,
Yea even The Trinity was painted here:
The People flocking came unto the place,
And to each Image they did bow their face,
Then every one, his Prayers did direct
Unto the Saint, he chiefly did respect:
Many did to The BLESSED VIRGIN crowd,
Begged that She would their Souls protect, and shroud,
From all their foes, from all their feared harms,
They kissed her feet, they hugged her in their arms,
They did bespeak Her in all flattering terms,
Said, that they did their whole trust in Her place,
Called Her A GODDESS, LADY of all Grace,
And when they thought Her by these whinings won,
They did beseech Her TO COMMAND HER SON:
In on thing many much themselves o're-shot,
They called Her LADY, yet Her Sex forgot;
For when they kneeled, they gravely did accost Her,
First with an AVE then a PATER NOSTER:
I strang'd, to hear, that all that praying throng,
Did scorn to pray but in The Latin Tongue,
I thought they all were Clerks, until I found
They did poor Priscian very rudely wound,
Yea they did use such uncouth Barbarous terms,
That I suspect'd their prayers smelled of Charms,
Some Wives intending to rehearse their Creed,
Did enterlac't with handsome words indeed,
They wrestled through it, with a deall of pain,
And ended it with Beitt-im and Turnim again.
Now comes the PRIEST and did himself address
With many Rites to celebrate the Mass,
I prysed much the Vestments which he had,
So rich they were, so well embroydered,
His Mystic Robes did make a splendid show,
And he did gravely to the ALTAR go:
Sometimes He stood,
Sometimes He bowed,
Now mumbled, then spoke aloud,
He crossed once, He crossed twice,
Then at a Bend He crossed thrice:
Uncouth were the mouths he made,
Uncouth were the words he said,
He often crienged, and he kiss't,
And turning next, the people bless't;
He turned his face, he turned his back,
We understood not what He spoke;
But saw him tossed to every Art,
Thus Antickly he act'd his part.
After He thus had been as one in throws,
Had made strange gestures, and such warbling shows,
At length, FIVE WONDER-WORKING WORDS he says,
Whose strange effects, do far exceed all Faith:
That which just now, was only BREAD before,
He does assert, that it is Bread no more;
But did enjoin, that it we should Adore;
Nothing but Bread did in his hand appear,
Naught (said he) but it is Accidents are here.
It Is Bread we handle, Bread we taste, and see,
And yet we must believed no Bread to be:
The people all upon the Wafer gazed,
They trusted all he said, and were amazed,
They kneeled unto it, as a Deity,
They have a sturdie Faith, (in truth said I)
I made no Question next; but every Guest
Who was invited to this Holy Feast,
Should be admitted of the Drink to taste:
But that' sa favor which was quite denied,
He took THE CUP, but would it not divide,
He did allege, that liquor must not be
Bestowed upon the profane Laity:
I asked what did aile the surly Priest
Thus to refuse, what was allowed by Christ?
Why should he fear to give, since Jesus did it?
They said, A HOLY COUNCIL had forbid it,
Who Christ's appointment well did understand,
But what he bid, that it did counter-mand,
Behold the Canon is at hand,
Which with a NON OBSTANTE does begin,
Read it, and then you will see it is a Sin
For Laics to desire to drink that Cup
The Priest himself must drink it every sip,
And that because, It Is greatly to be feared,
Some Drops may stick unto a Lay-mans Beard.
Mass being done, the Priest with no mean grace
Himself into The Sacred Chair did place,
And frankly to his preaching work did fall,
The Text he chused, was Apocryphal, (Tebit. 6. 7.)

Anent the Fishes Liver, and it is Heart
Which to Tobias the Angel did impairt,
Whose dreadful smell away the Devil did drive,
And so did keep the Young Bridegroom alive:
From this fair Text, he did discourse at length,
Of these Bad Spirits cunning, and their Strength,
He Marshalled all the Devils in File and Ranks,
He told us Asmodeus place, and pranks:
How against Marriage he was so intent,
Because it is An Holy Sacrament:
Then had we such a talk of Holy Fish,
As did awake mine appetite to wish
I had some of them served in a dish?
He told us, how fit cheer they were for Lent,
How sure a token of a penitent,
It was, with these his table for to cover,
And with large draughts of wine to swill them over:
I cannot well remember every part;
But much he spoke of The Conjuring Art,
And much he praised the Holy Exorcists,
Who handle Devils as roughly as they list.
To shut up all, he told, that he had now
A worthy RELIC to us all to show,
Which he had purchased with no small expense,
Which we must view, with profound reverence,
It was, One of that Sacred Fishes FINN'S,
Of force to fright all Devils, and purge all Sins,
Into a hole in Tygris Banks, he said
Tobias when he caught the Fish it laid,
And now An Holy Hermit had it found,
By many wonders done about that ground:
At last he did that goodly thing present,
About whose Virtues, many words were spent;
My Spleen with laughter I had almost rent,
Yet seemed. in wondering with the rest to join,
For all he said, past here for goodly Coin.
When to that preaching we had listened,
A Child is brought him, to be Christened:
Thrice did he blow into the Infants face,
As if his Breath could have conveyed Grace:
Some dreadful Charming words, he then did say,
Meaning thereby to drive the Devil away;
As if the pained, and new delivered Mother
Had born a Child, and ugly Devil together:
With Holy Oil, the Babe he did besmear,
And Hallowed Garments, put on him to wear;
Then Holy Salt, was put into his Mouth,
Sure (thought I) that will breed the Child a drouth:
A Holy Candle's then put in his hand,
The use whereof I did not understand;
And last of all, The Priest did think it fit
Gently To stroke the Child with what he spit.
When all was done, one did The Priest accost,
Saying, A man who now gives up the Ghost,
Does for your presence earnestly entreat,
Now to assist him in his greatest strait;
He was not nice to go; and I
Resolved was to bear him company;
Not that I curious was to see
The poor man in his agony,
But that I thought, I might instructed be
How I my self might learn betimes to die.
Being intent upon this good design,
I very heedfull was to every thing:
The Dying man did earnestly request
The Father, to direct him, how he best
Might now arrive unto an happy rest:
The Priest sat down, and promised he should find
All ease, and satisfaction to his mind.
He first required, That he should confess
His Sins, and not conceall them more or less:
The house was ushered, and when all were gone,
He, and the dying man were left alone;
But sneakingly I creep't beneath a bed,
That I might hear all that was done, or said:
Into the Priest, the man much trust reposed,
And all the secrets of his Breast disclosed:
Often (said He) I have harbored flaming ires,
And often have I nowrish'd lustful fires,
Sometimes have drunk, sometimes to excess eated,
And often have I excessively prated,
Not seldom have I also rashly sworn,
And the most sacred name profanely torn,
And many times when I have prayed alone,
My lips have talked, when my heart was gone:
Officious lies made often he confess't,
As also lies, which he had made in jest.
The Priest said, these were faults indeed; Yet all
Or most of them, were only VENIAL;
Some Doctors have averred no less, (said he)
Which does suffice for PROBABILITY:
And then what other guilt there was, did ask?
The man did thus again begin his task:
The Churches Laws full often have I broke,
Against the Pope full often have I spoke,
The Holy days I carelessly despised,
And Holy Relics have not duly pryz'd,
Often (said He) I grievously have failed,
Some faults from my Confessor has concealed:
And then he made a very sad complaint,
That he had sometimes eaten Flesh in Lent,
And had on Friday's done so often times;
The Priest said, These were horrid MORTAL Crimes
Such as deserve Eternal punishment;
But now, By Virtue of the Sacrament
OF PENANCE, This deserved suffering shall
Be changed unto one that is Temporal,
Lo. I ABSOLVE Thee from the Guilt of all;
This Absolution thou shall boldly show,
And it shall be Thy PASS where thou dos't go:
But that no danger may thy Soul betide,
These Images, I lay down by thy side,
(Into these Guards thou safely may confide)
Here Is One, of Christ upon the Cross; Another,
The Image of the Blessed Virgin Mother,
The Third's, The Saint's whom thou thy Patron chose;
In whose help special trust thou did repose:
Embrace thou them, To them thy self commend,
They no small comfort unto thee will lend.
Yet that thou may the more secured be,
It Is fit; thou in Religious Habit die,
Put on this COU'L, put on this CLOAK,
Put on this HAIR-CLOATH, and this Frock
And gird this CORD about thy weast,
And ty this CROSS unto thy Breast;
This being done, take courage, and defy
All the black Guards of the Infernal fry,
They can not stand against this Artillery:
When they do see thee passing by their border,
They Will think thou have been of Saint Francis Order,
They Will tremble all, and sculk away,
As Thieves are used to do at break of day.
Thou art a man of Wit (thought I) indeed,
Fair fall that shaven, that Politic head,
That has contrived and taught so fine a wile,
By which men may the Devil himself beguile;
In truth it is a pretty handsome fraud,
And (if it work) I do it much applaud;
But for my very heart I can not think
That Couls and Chords, can make the Devil to shrink,
That Clothes can hide vile souls and cover sins,
As they can hide and cover fouled skins;
Or that such dead and cold assistants, can
Comfort a dying and dejected man:
But well I found, the man who there did ly,
To be by far more credulous then I;
With this discourse he seemed to be much cheered,
No further danger unto him appeared;
Until The Priest, did give new cause of fear,
And did put on a countenance severe.
For now he tells the man a dreadful story,
That he must shortly land in PURGATORY,
He so descriv'd that ghastly place, as might
The stoutest of all mortal men affright:
There is fire, and there is smoke,
There noisome heats, and vapors choke
There poor Souls are sadly toyled,
Some, in seething Caldrons boiled,
Some, in frying pans are broyled
Some, on spits are roast alive,
Some, the Fiends with Scourges drive,
Some, in streams of Brimstonly
There they Shreek, and there they cry,
Thus they suffer, thus they dye,
They Are confined into that Cage,
Some, a year; and some an Age,
Some for many Ages space
Stay into that dismal place:
And thou (said he) must still endure these pains,
Till thou be wholly purged from thy stains.
He then began the poor man to ANOINT,
Besmeard his Head, and Oyled every joint,
He Oiled his Ears, he Oiled his Eyes,
He Oiled his Hands, he Oiled his Thighs,
I thought, it would be far from my desire
First to be flamed, and then set to the fire.
The dying man did sigh, and weeping, say
How sad's my lodging! and how dark's my way!
What wealth would I not be content to give?
If wealth could from that Prison me reprieve;
Or if I can not from't be wholly free,
Oh that my stay therein might shortened be:
To hear of Ages, and of thousand years,
Does rack my mind, and fill my heart with fears,
Each hour I must stay there, an Age appears,
The Priest at this discourse pricked up his Ears;
And said, if frankly thou thy wealth bestow
Upon the Church, her Charity she will show,
The stock is great which she has in her Trust
The treasure of the Merits of the just,
And for thy safety will thereof dispense,
That quickly thou may be dismissed thence.
Sacred Bells, shall often be rung,
Many Masses shall be sung,
Holy Candles shall be lighted,
Whereby Friends are all affrighted,
All the Saints shall be Adored,
Holy Martyrs' all implored,
No endeavors shall be wanted,
Till thy free release be granted,
Prayers for thee shall not cease,
Till thy Soul be well at ease:
Some Holy Monk shall tell us in the end,
He in a Vision saw't to Heaven ascend,
And knew it is shape, when it did upwards tend.
The poor man's heart with this discourse was glad,
He bid him, if he pleased take all he had
And such a share he took, that they did find
There was not much to them that came behind.
No sooner came I out unto the street,
But that THE LADY did again me meet,
She ask't, if now I fully was convinced;
Or if my mind was yet with scruples pinch't:
I told Her, that I still desired to see
Some further proofs, of that great Sanctity
Which she at first discoursed of to me:
She did assure me, I should fully have
That granted, which I now did fondly crave:
And first (said She) to show thee I Will begin
Men, who are Doing Penance for their sin.
I saw some, who did Pilgrims Habites take,
And to the Shrynes of Saints long journeys make.
Some with crossed arms did Clothed with Sackloth go,
Some with bare feet did walk among the snow:
Some Lash't themselves, until their flesh did bleed,
Some only Strewed Ashes on their Head:
Some, did some Ave's, and some prayers rehearse,
As carelessly as ever I did verse;
They only seemed concerned to keep account
That they to such a number might amount:
Some said they Fasted, and no Flesh did taste,
And yet their meals lacked nothing of a Feast:
The difference was great that I saw there.
Some Pennances were slight, and some severe.
These cruel whippers of themselves (said I)
Their sins must sure be of a double die;
These other, who so lightly do escape,
No sinners are, or else sin very cheap:
Thou much mistakes (said she) and seems to be
Ill versed in the Rules of Policy*
Men in their tempers differ much, and I
With all of them endeavor to comply:
These whom thou thus torment themselves do see,
Thou must not think most Criminal to be;
They either fear the Divine Wrath, and find
That these their outward tortures, ease their mind;
Or else unto great Merit they aspire,
And I will not deny them their desire;
I bid them lash, till they make bare their Bones,
And fast till they become like Skeletones.
Others more joviall sinners are then so,
And will not such hard measures undergo,
Unto all thought of Merit, they are freezed,
Are not ambitious, to be Canonized:
They would 'scape Hell; but not disturb their ease,
And them I also careful am to please:
They have as easy Penance as they wish,
I charge them sometimes to eat only Fish,
For change of Heart, prescrive them change of Dish,
Some prayers they are appointed to say over,
No matter if their Hearts be fixed, or hover:
I show them very easy ways to bliss,
Yet ways so safe, that hardly they can miss
Of Heaven at last: And notwithstanding do
Put them in fear of Purgatory too;
But yet the fear is not so great; but they
Themselves indulge into their pleasures may;
They who are rich, if they a Pardon pryse,
And for it a little money can despise,
This will be sure at last to serve their turn,
Into these flames, they stay not long to burn:
They who to Sacred Chappells can but trot,
Indulgences in store may there be got,
Who can the Pilgrims happiness define,
Who visits but once LORETTO'S Shrine?
Angels did bring the famed Chapel there,
They bore the Stones and timber through the Air.
She next desired that I those should see,
Who to Religious Orders fixed be,
These (said She) are the Men of whom I boast,
These (in a manner) ride to Heaven by Post,
And to make good their journey, spare no cost:
These, did She show me, numerous as Bees,
All marshalled into diverse Companies:
Some, BENEDICTINS were, some CARMELITES,
Some called CARTHUSIANS, and some JESUITS,
Some from SAINT FRANCIS did their honor claim,
And some were styled by SAINT DOMINICKS name:
Their way much differed from the common road,
They had strange names, and habites which were odd,
These Men (said She) on Earth live Angels lives,
Possess no Riches, and enjoy no Wives.
Some of them, Preaching in the streets did walk,
Some, often of their Ecstasies did talk;
And some, their bread by Begging only got,
That idle sort of life, I liked not;
Such lusty fellows as these are (I said)
Should rather by their labor earn their Bread,
When this I spoke, She did a little loure,
Saying, they begged to relieve the poor
Much (says She) get they; but do little eat,
I know not, (said I) But they are like their meat.
Some went about with Relics, and did show
What Miracles these hallowed things could do,
And some of them, the people did acquaint
What Feats were wrought by every Countrey-Saint:
But above all, they did his praises sound,
Who did Their Order institute and found;
And all of them, professed themselves to be
Devoted Slaves unto the Romish see
And thundered fearful Dooms against those who Cope
With their Un-erring Glorious Head the POPE.
I to RELIGIOUS HOUSES did repair,
That I might see what SANCTITY was there:
Thither I found some Princes had retired,
And what had brought them thither I admit'd;
Until I found by inquiry, that some
Had for one cause, some for another come.
The consciences of some were racked with guilt,
Of Horrid crimes, and blood which they had spil't
On Beds of Silk, they could obtain no rest,
An Angry Conscience (that unwelcome Guest)
Came un-invited unto every feast,
Imbittered all things unto their taste,
And marred the mirth of many goodly jest
Until at length, they are taught this pretty knack,
Themselves unto some CLOISTER to betake
They lay aside the Purple, and the Crown,
They shave their Heads, put on the Hairy Gown,
They hide themselves among Religious Men,
And Conscience no more disturbes them then;
Their Crimes (they think) are expiat hereby,
Blood, and oppression will no longer cry,
Or if they cry, their cries will not be heard;
Heaven's anger by a MONK needs not be feared.
Thus DIOCLESIAN, after he did stain
His Soul, with blood of thousands, by him slain,
To the SALONIAN Gardens did retreat,
Leaving his palace, and imperial State,
And sought for ease into that lonely seat,
Ease which he could not in his triumphs find
Unto his frighted discontented mind.
Others were not so bad; but wearied were
Betwixt the various turns of Hope and Fear;
Afrai'd to stand on tops of humane State,
Upon the slipperie pinacles of Fate,
They rather choos'd, to come down to the dust,
Of free accord, then be by others thrust.
Others unto these lowly CELLS did flee,
Not for RELIGION, but for LIBERTY,
Finding that they could breath in free'r air,
Under an humble rooff, with homely fare,
Then those can do whose choice it is to wait
Upon a life of Business and State:
They by this postern did escape, and shroud
Themselves from War, and from all noise and crowd,
And all these inconveniences, that do
Attend on Great Ones, and confine them too.
Unto the meaner sort I looked then
Of those RELIGIOUS celebrated men,
Some of them, still did hatch mischievous things,
To imbroyle Kingdoms, and to murder Kings,
And for these ends, did with instructions load
The most Pragmatick and sent them abroad:
Some were for learning, and choos'd that retreat
As most convenient for the muses seat:
Some were Ambitious, and here courted Fame,
Fled from the world, to obtain a name;
Some Criminalls fled hither from the judge,
Fear of the Gibbet, made them take refuge
Into the CLOISTER; Some their Discontent,
Rather then their Religion hither sent:
And some their were, who did indeed bewray
That in their minds DEVOTION carried sway;
And yet when for it is genuine Sp'rit I sought,
Even among them, I missed it, I thought.
Each of them did their ORDER magnify,
And were too fond of their Austeritie,
They wanted not their factions, and much heat,
Their talking of their MERITS was too great,
The lives of others they too much disgraced,
Too much in FASTS, too much in HABITES placed,
External works, did for great matters pass,
And what was Sp'rituall, to much foundred was,
Except with very few; so that although
Their mealls were sparing, and their Garments rough,
And pleasures they unto themselves denied,
Yet here I found much of the life of Pride.
MY GUIDE said next, that now she would me call
To see the most alluring sight of all,
The HOLY LADIES, who no pleasures know;
But such as Contemplation does bestow,
All unstained VIRGINS, who go not abroad;
But wholly are devoted unto God,
And their whole time do in Devotions pass,
Disdaining to be trick't with comb and glass.
I who still entertained sincere respects
For virtuous persons of that lovely sex,
Made haste and to the MONASTRIES did hy,
And in their fashions curiously did pry:
Some did I see, into that homely place,
Whose sweet behavior did it is meanness grace,
Their gestures and discourse, I found to be
All coined, and stamp't with comely Modesty:
Beauty they had, whereby love might be warmed;
But against it is darts invincibly were armed;
Whenever any softer pleasures knocked
Loud at the door, they keep't it fast and locked:
I thought them wondrous good, and wondrous fair,
Their habit homely, and their diet spare;
I judged they were so pious, and so grave,
They well deserved all the praise She gave:
Amongst them an Old Governess I see,
Commanding, with imperious tyrranie,
And they obeyed whatever She required,
And they did yield, in all that She desired:
Only (poor Souls) I found they were oppress't,
Urged to Devotions formal at the best;
And taught, from true Humility to slide,
Taught, in their merits too much to confide:
Such things, I found did somewhat me displease;
But yet I HONORED These:
Others I found, of melancholy looks,
Were often musing, often reading books,
Their Words and Gestures, well assured me
That they had strech't their Brains a pin too high:
With HARPIUS works, some entertained their sight,
Some SU^O, some RUSBROCHIUS did delight,
Some MOTHER JULIANA'S works did read,
Odd Notions, and wild fancies filled their head;
Some MYSTIC words (I found) they learned thence,
Words strange to Scripture, and as strange to sense;
They talked of their Wondrous INSPIRATIONS,
Of PASSIVE UNIONS, and ANNIHILATIONS,
Of INTROVERSIONS, and IRRADIATIONS,
Of CONTEMPLATIONS Acted by the Will,
The Understanding mean while lying still:
They in GODS MID HEAD were beclos'd (they said)
And in his BUXOMNES and MEEK-HEID laid,
And that their Souls, did deeply in him Ground,
And knew him in the SPIRITS PUREST FUND:
In many words they talked at this rate,
Words, which I cannot in this place relate,
Such stubborn words as frowardly decline
With neighbour-words in verses to combine;
So that it to a Poet were a crime,
Once to attempt to fetch them into Rhyme:
I Grew impatient, and began, to huff,
To hear them rattling such non sensick stuff,
Yet when I did into their temper pry,
Observing, that their minds they did apply
Unto Religious thoughts; and were no Cheats,
But too much warmed with Entbusiastick heats,
And that their heads were weak. their musings long,
The Wine, was for the Bottle much too strong,
I blamed their Leaders, who did them abuse,
And suffered them to be too much Recluse,
And in their hands such Canting books did put,
Meanwhile the Bible keeping from them shut,
Against these impostors was my Choler moved,
But yet the harmless maids LOVED
Others, were like poor Birds shut in a cage,
Still flightering, and still were in a rage,
Some at their cruel Parents, who to save
Their Portions, had sent them to that Grave;
Some at themselves, who had not been more shy
To take these VOWS which they could not unty;
For their Novitious fervor, now was gone,
They found, they were not fit to live alone;
And yet their OATHS, had all their hopes defeat,
Of ever living in a married state:
This did their minds continually rack,
If they shall keep what they have vowed or break;
The thoughts of either, did them quite confound,
Both HORNS of this DILEMMA did them wound:
Their very frozen CELLS did nurse their fires,
Restraints, were fuel to their warm desires;
Yet Conscience, did put them still in fear,
Should they but once attempt these chains to tear:
Thus were they burdened; yet once being fast,
I found they were resolved to be chaste,
Their Lot was cast: They choosed to endure
Their angry thoughts, and not to seek a cure,
They judged, it was a more Religious life
To be a vexed maid, then perjured wife:
Their case (I thought) did much compassion claim,
And I did PITY them.
Others, I could not judge what they did see,
So very pleasing in a MONAST'RIE,
To draw them thither; but their pranks did show
They had no purpose to observe their Vow,
Or to die maids: it was their choice, or chance,
To be more versed in Love, then by Romance:
They did not on Religious scruples stand,
What they desired, they meant to have in hand;
But I Will forbear, and will not imitate
The Satyrists, who whilst they smartly rate
Actions not to be named, do never stay
Until their pens be as profane, as they
Who are the Actors: What they did was bad;
But the effects thereof, were much more sad;
What dismal sights were there? mine heart yet shakes
To think, what was into the drained Lakes:
What wretched HEROD'S cruelty, did act
Against the BABES, these did renew the fact;
No sooner did the mothers give them breath,
But as soon did their hands procure their death,
The BABES, who did no ill, and feared no harm,
No pity found, no breasts to keep them warm:
I much bemoaned the Harmless Infants fate,
But did The GUILTY MOTHERS HATE.
Now said MY GUIDE, say now what is thy thought?
What happy change upon thy mind is wrought?
When thou amongst the HOLY MONKS have been,
And when thou have the HOLY VIRGINS seen,
Have thou not looked with wonder, and delight,
Upon that pleasing and that Heavenly sight?
I answered Her more freely then was fit,
Bewrayed more Ingenuitie then Wit.
RELIGIOUS HOUSES such as these, (I said)
I think, might useful in the CHURCH be made,
There might more rough undanton'd youth be tamed,
And tender minds be to Religion framed,
And as the Prophets Schools they well might be,
To train men for the Heavenly Ministry:
And thither Aged persons might retreat,
When they are arrived at their decrepit state,
Have done their work, and now must leave the stage,
When stormed with sickness, and besieged with Age:
There, persons of a sad dejected mind,
Or sore afflicted, might a refuge find;
But that it should be free to every one,
Each guilty Wretch, or every idle Dron,
Each humorous Maid, or Child that is discontent,
Or such, whose lives might usefully be spent
To public good; For such in Cells to ly,
Is that wherewith my mind can not comply:
I care not much for all their fleshly shows,
I most of all Hate their ensnaring Vows,
Of Christian freedom I do judg't a breach,
To bind some thus, to things beyond their reach,
Things, which at first do with their minds agree;
But afterward, do make their lives to be
Nothing but constant toil and drudgerie:
My mind was well affected long (said I)
Unto these things, till further I did pry;
But what I thus admired unknown, I more
Admire my self, for liking it before:
Nor can I think, but I have elsewhere seen
As much Religion, where less noise has been:
Then freely I unto her did relate,
Whom I did HONOR, PITY, LOVE, and HATE;
So that I said my thoughts were as before,
Nor could they change, unless I yet saw more.
In hearing this, SHE was impatient;
Yet did She smother all her discontent,
She only seemed to bewail my State,
That I so long should be so obstinate.
ONE HOLY PLACE, there is as yet said She,
And thither now I will they Leader be,
When other means for thy Conversion fail,
I Am well assured that this shall prevail;
Such HOLY FATHERS are into that place,
Their very looks will charm thee into Grace;
They Will urge thee with such Arguments, as are
More efficacious, and more pungent far
Then any thou have heard: I none can name
Who unconverted did return from them:
Against HERETICS they with such reasons fight,
Each word they speak, is found a word of weight:
See how I do solicit thee for good?
I must not, nay I will not be withstood.
I thought SHE meant, and I did fear no ill,
But readily I did obey her will,
I said, I in the search of TRUTH do go,
It Is conquest, can not be my overthrow:
I ever much esteemed SANCTITY,
Which in These FATHERS I did hope to see,
To Mighty Reasons keep't an open ear,
Which from their sacred lips I hoped to hear:
I little did suspect (poor simple man)
How cunningly She meant me to trepan;
But by fair words, I was entited so
As harmless sheep unto the slaughter go.
Unto an House we came with Guards beset,
Where at the time some of These FATHERS met,
I thought them Reverend Men, long was their beard,
Their limbs were large, and grave their looks appeared;
MY GUIDE did whisper, what I was; they frowned.
And stamp't, and girn'd and did me quite confound:
I leave this man among your hands (said She)
I need not tell how he should used be,
They bowed to Her, and did without delay
Command the Guards to carry me away.
With weighty chains my hands and feet were tied,
In vain I moan'd, in vain for help I cried:
I only did desire to understand,
Who't was that thus to use me gave Command?
Who but The HOLY FATHERS doth't? said one
THE FATHERS OF THE INQUISITION;
Alace (said I) am I among their hands?
I never should have felt these heavy bands,
Had I but heard that name a while before,
But it is in vain to speak, I Will say no more.
They threw me in a dark and noisome pit,
Which, of the Sun did no dear glimpse admit,
No Stars, did here display their sparkling light,
Nothing was here, but an unquestioned night:
Here, all night's horrors did me still annoy;
But the night's silence I could not enjoy,
By Shreeks, and houlings they disturbed my peace,
Doubling the native terror of the place,
They did me from all humane converse keep
And as A Witch I was debarred from Sleep.
Some days I thus remained, on morn at last
The prison Doors were opened in haste
I first did see A Scent of juggling fires,
Then some appeared in Devils shapes and attires
To me they came, and closs by me did sit,
Only (I think) to fright me out of Wit:
Their Hair, as curling Serpents down did hang,
And from their mouth great flames of fire there sprang;
With Horns they often threatened me to push,
Their Cloven Feet they lifted, me to crush,
They roared aloud, they gnash'd their teeth with spite;
And gaped, as if they would devour me quite:
I should have thought, that I in HELL had been,
Had I not found against these ills a Skreen,
That Is wanting there, A QUIET CONSCIENCE,
Which was a witness of mine Innocence.
These SPECTERS being vanished and gone,
I was again for so ne few hours alone;
Thereafter, Some came in, who seemed to be
More friendly and Compassionate to me;
Said, they would interpose to set me free:
They did pretend, that they were grieved and sad
That I had met with usages so bad:
Thou art (said they) not far advanced in years,
No froward Symptom in thy face appears,
They bid me tell them, who my Parents were?
What was my Faith? who my Companions are?
What means I had? Or what Friends in that place?
And if I would The ROMAN FAITH embrace?
They ceased not to urge me to confess,
We Are Friends (said they) hide nothing more or less.
Fair were their words, and cunning were their arts,
Well had they learned to act The Traitors parts;
But I, who did not see within their mask,
Hoped well and told them all that they did ask;
Mean while, A Clerk behind the door they had,
Who did observe, and write all that I said.
After a while, some Officers do show,
That now The Judges call me, I must go;
I am led out, and brought unto the Bar,
And there inditements framed against me are:
They said they were no time with me to lose;
But bid me Swear, whatever they propose
Or ask of me, that faithfully I shall
Without Dissimulation answer all:
Then, such ensnaring questions they did ask,
To find an answer, was a vexing task;
Which to be rid of, I said I would be
As plain, as any could desire of me,
So that they should not need, thus to go on
In making further Inquisition,
They all applaud my Resolution.
Were I of that RILIGION you are of
(said I) It casie were for me to Scoff
At all your questions; being in this strait,
Though I have Sworn, I might: EQUIVOCATE;
But now, I do confess to you, that I
After that manner you call HERESY
So worship God: Do now what ye think fit,
Your power is great; but Heaven can limite it:
But all this freedom, did not satisfy,
My cruel Judges: Still they urged me,
Some said, I did my accomplices conceal,
Others that I had wealth, and must reveal
Where it was hid; some said I must recant,
And some alleged I did already faint,
A little feeling of the WHEEL or RACK
(They said) would all my resolution break,
All engines they of torture did present,
And threatened all most cruel punishment,
And promised favor, if I would repent.
Then was I back unto the Prison sent.
But as I went, It was my chance to meet
A throng of angry people in the street,
Some runn, some railed, some cudgelled all about,
So raging, so tumultuous was the rout:
My Guards, did what they could to part the fray,
And often cried to them to Make way;
But they were deaf to cries, and we e're long
Were compassed in the middle of the throng:
In this Confusion, they had need to see
To save themselves, who should have looked to me,
I did observe the opportunity,
And thus escaped from these TIGERS hands,
And found the means to be fred of my bands,
I fled, and cared not whether I did run,
So that I might The INQUISITION shun.
Wearie'd at length with my uncertain flight,
Toyling all day, and watching in the night
I did unto a desert place repair,
Freedom my Feast, contentment was my fare:
Now I began to think where I had been,
And to reflect on all that I had seen:
Thus (thought I) have I now a long time ranged,
Shall my Profession, shall my mind be changed?
What have I heard, should thus me influence?
Have I not heard much talk, and little sense?
And seen much show, which void of substance is?
RELIGION'S SHELL but did it is KERNEL miss:
When I return, each man will curious be
To ask, what I did in my travells see?
It Is fit, my mind a little compend draw
Thereof, to tell them what it was I saw.
I saw A PRELATE meddling in all things,
Enslaving Kingdoms, trampling on Kings,
He did all Laws, Divine, and humane tear,
Rant of his power, and boasted of his CHAIR,
Blasphemed all that is sacred without fear:
I saw HIS COURT, and there I scarcely spied
Any, but Children both of lust and pride.
LEARNED MEN I saw, who clossly were combined
To shape and mould RELIGION to their mind,
They seam'd CHRIST'S COAT with gaudie Liveries,
They mixed with wholesome Truths politic lies.
I saw RELIGION matched with POLICY,
I saw A WORSHIP mostly PAGEANTRIE
I saw some maimed profaned SACRAMENTS
I saw some wild and wanton PENITENTS
They said their AVE'S, and their Prayers told,
Their pardons bought, and then to sin were bold:
I saw a crowd of FRIARS of many hues,
Crafty as Foxes, covetous as JEWS,
With Shaved Heads, and Cutted locks,
With Petticots, and Hoods and Frocks
With faces hardened more then any Rocks,
They preached the virtues of the painted Stocks:
They fed, and yet alleged they did fast,
Defiled Women, and swore they were chaste,
They raised in the world much commotion,
And swore they spent their time in great Devotion,
They heaped up riches, and swore they were poor,
They blushed not to lie, and to perjure.
I saw some OVERWEENING NUNS, who thought
By living Virgins, they Heaven over-bought:
And Some FANTASTIC ONES, who did omit
Nothing, to show that they had lost their Wit:
I saw some Crafty, and RELIGIOUS WHORES
Locked up in Sacred, (but profaned) Bowers,
Attending clink of Bell, and praying hours;
Yet setting friendly trysts with paramours.
At last, I did begin to think upon
The FURIES of the INQUISITION;
But a strange Horror on my mind did seize,
I from my feat a little did me raise,
And looked about: Alace what do I see?
Here comes THE LADY who betrayed me;
And have I found thee here again? (said She)
FEAR, RAGE, HATE, ANGER, all did now awake,
And in my breast did strange confusion make,
My mind, now with unusual thoughts was filled,
Unusual language from my lips distilled;
O HERCULES (said I) who early killed
The hissing Serpents, which thy life assailed,
Why have thou not to me thy strength entailed?
That I might at this instant it employ
This folding, crooked serpent to destroy,
This forked tongue I would cut out,
Which does all deadly poison spout,
And thereby does these simple souls annoy
Who do not know Religion from a Toy.
She heard me, and She did begin to smyle,
And thus She answered in a jeering style,
I see thou art a convert now become,
Or have of thine opinions changed some:
When we met last, thou ceased not me to taunt,
Because I bid thee pray unto a SAINT;
But now a Heathen champion thou adores,
Thou beg's his Strength, and for his aid implores.
I blushed a little, when I heard that tale,
Thinking, perhaps my passion made me fail;
Recovering my self, I said, in vain
Thou Wilt think by jeers, to cheat me now again:
I lift no Hat, and I do bow no knee,
No string of such Devotion touches me:
But could I for the strength and puissance call
Of all the Giants, and the Hero's all,
That I might strike, thou with the stroke might fall;
And so might free the world from thy thrall;
Not all thy quick and nimble footed wit,
And smooth-pac'd Eloquence joined with it,
Not all thy cheating FRIARS attyres,
Not all thy talk of Ancient Syres
Not all thy INQUISITION Fires
Should break me of from this design,
Thy pride I Would crush, and I would end thy reign.
Alace (vain man) what means this heat? said She,
What have I done that thus incenseth thee?
What done? (said I) thou have betrayed me:
To HOLY FATHERS* thou wilt me bring thou said,
And thou to HELLISH FURIES did me lead,
Thou said, by reasons they my mind would turn,
And they did mean to ashes me to burn:
She said all this was but my foolish thought,
And that they naught but my conversion sought.
What then (said I) did mean that noisome PIT?
Why did they throw me down to it?
Why sent they DEVILS to fright, me from my wit?
What meant the RACK and WHEEL I there did see?
What meant THE FIRE was kindling for me?
That Pit (said She) they only put thee in,
That there thou might Do penance for thy sin,
These Ghastly Sights were sent, for frighting thee
Not from thy Wit; but from thine HERESY;
They meant to put thee on the Wheel and Rack,
Thy stubborn mind; but not thy Bones to break;
And Flames thou saw provided there that day,
Were only to consume thy Dross away.
Fair Tales (said I) but sure it is good for me
That from their hands I am escaped free.
O Fool (said She) thinks thou to keep the field?
Behold, What KINGS, What NATIONS to me yield?
And now I have a great design in hand,
Even to subject The NOBLE BRITISH LAND
Where once my power did uncontrolled sway,
Till from it is just obedience it did stray,
Can I endure to miss so brave a prey?
A while I have been hatching secret PLOTS,
But fie upon that cursed DOCTOR OATS,
And PRANSE, and BEDLO, DANGERFIELD, and such
Apostate Rogues, who have revealed so much:
These Gheating Villains, little were acquainted
With what I meant, they feigned, where they wanted;
They Are now confounded, I have found the way
To make men laugh at all that they do say;
These PLOTS they talked of, now are turned to PLAY:
Fie on them all that have me counter-wrought,
And have mine Agents unto Scaffolds brought.
But I am working still, and well I know
To catch my foes, whatever way they go;
For if these mines of secret treason fail,
With open force I will ere long assail,
Whom I can not corrupt, I shall destroy,
Where Plots do miss, the sword I will employ.
Vain are the trusts, wherein they do confide,
These HERETICS themselves in NUMBERS pride,
In PARLIAMENTS, In TESTS, in PENAL LAWS,
In Learned CHURCHMEN to defend their cause;
But all these things shall prove but broken reeds,
The times shall change, and they must change their Creeds
Their NUMBERS, I by ARMIES will o'rawe;
I Will raise a power, that shall DISPENSE with LAW
Their Parliaments Pl pack, their hands I Will bind,
Their Tests and Statutes, I Will cause them rescind:
Of mine own CLERGY, I Will hiss for a Fry,
That shall out-dispute, or shall theirs outcry;
These GOWN-MEN now look big, preach, write, and brag,
I Will quell their courage, or their mouths I Will gag.
No money will I spare, no pains, no cost,
And tho I will not of the issue boast
Too much before hand, yet I Am confident,
At length I shall not miss of mine intent:
I Will them confound, Divide, I Will burn, I Will stay,
I Will overturn, I Will do more then I say,
I may perhaps in one contrivance fail,
But in another, hope I shall prevail:
That ISLAND either shall take on my yoke;
Or else it shall in pieces quite be broke,
Better it should an empty desert be,
Then that it be not subject unto me:
I will, I will Rule in that stubborn ISLE,
It Is QUEEN it shall once more ere long me style.
In speaking this, Her countenance was fierce,
Her words, as darts my very heart did pierce;
O HEAVENS (said I) This Fury disappoint,
My knees did shake, I trembled every joint,
The mighty terror, and the panick fear
That did o'r-flow my mind, I could not bear;
So often did I startle, weep so sore,
MINE EYES BURST OPEN, I COULD SLEEP NO MORE,
FINIS.
