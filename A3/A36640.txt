Love and Jealousy: OR, A Song in the Duke of GUIES.
^ Tell me Thirsis, tell your anguish, why you sigh, and why you languish; when
^the Nymph whom you adore, Grants the blessing of possessing, what can Love
^and I do more? Love and I, what can Love and I do more? what can Love and ^I
do more? Think it is Love beyond all measure, makes me faint away with
^pleasure, strength of Cordials may destroy, and the blessing of possessing,
kills ^me with excess of joy. Thirsis how can I believe you, but confess and
I Will forgive ^you; Men are false and so are you, never Nature framed a
Creature, to enjoy and ^yet be true. Thirsis how can I believe you, but confess
and I Will forgive you; Men ^are false and so are you; never Nature framed a
creature, to enjoy and yet be true. ^Mine's a flame beyond expiring, still
possessing, still desiring, fit for Loves Imperial ^Crown; ever shining, and
refining, still the more it is melted down.

Printed for P. Brooksby, at the Golden-Ball, near the Hospital-gate, in West
Smithfield: 1683.
