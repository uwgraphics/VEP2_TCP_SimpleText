A PROCLAMATION For Recalling and Prohibiting Seamen from the Service of
Foreign Princes and States, and that no Prizes taken from the Dutch by virtue
of Portugal Commissions, be brought into His Majesty's Ports.
CHARLES R.

WHereas the Kings most Excellent Majesty has been advertised that great
numbers of Mariners and other Seafaring men, His Majesty's natural born
Subjects, many of them, by occasion of the late disbanding, and some others
before, have betaken themselves to the Services of Foreign Princes and States,
to the great disservice of His Majesty and their native Countries; and whereby
His said Majesty and His Realms are unfurnished of men of their sort and
calling, if there shall be cause to use them: Therefore for redress thereof at
present, and preventing the like for the future, the Kings most Excellent
Majesty by this His Royal Proclamation, with the advice of the Lords of His
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council, does Will, and strictly Charge and
Command all and singular Masters of Ships, Pilots, Mariners, Seamen,
Ship-wrights, and other Seafaring men whatsoever, and wheresoever, being His
Majesty's natural born Subjects, who are in the Service of any Foreign Prince
or State, or do serve in any Foreign Ships or Vessels, That forthwith they do
withdraw themselves, and depart from such Foreign Services, and return home to
their native Countries, and lawful vocations. And further, His Majesty does
hereby prohibit and forbid all and singular Masters of Ships, Pilots, Mariners,
Seamen, Ship-wrights, and other Seafaring men whatsoever, being His Majesty's
natural born Subjects, from entering themselves, and does hereby straightly
Charge and Command them, and every of them from henceforth, to forbear to enter
themselves into Pay, or otherwise betake themselves to the Service of any
Foreign Princes or States, or to serve in any Foreign Vessel or Ship, without
License had and obtained in that behalf. To all which His Majesty does and will
expect due obedience and conformity; and does hereby Publish and Declare, That
the Offenders to the contrary shall not only incur His Majesty's just
displeasure, but be proceeded against for their Contempt, by Seizure of their
Goods, Persons and Estates, wheresoever they shall be found, and otherwise,
according to the utmost severities of Law. And further, His Majesty does hereby
Authorize and Command all and every the Captains, Masters, and other Officers
serving or employed in any of His Majesty's Ships or Vessels at Sea, to stop
and make stay of all and every such person and persons as shall endeavor to
Transport or Enter themselves into the Service of any Foreign Prince or State,
contrary to the true intent and meaning of this His Majesty's Royal
Proclamation; and also to seize upon, take, and bring away all such Mariners,
Seamen, and other persons aforesaid, as shall be found to be employed or
serving in any Ships or Vessels, of, or belonging to any Foreign Prince or
State, or to any Merchant, or other person or persons, other then to His
Majesty, or to His Subjects.

And whereas His Majesty is advertised from His good Brother the King of
Portugal, that he has Revoked and Annulled all Commissions and Letters of
Marque or Reprisal by Him given to any persons whatsoever, either His own
Subjects or Strangers, against the States General of the United Provinces and
their Subjects; Therefore the Kings most Excellent Majesty does hereby straightly
Charge and Command all and singular His Governors, Officers and Ministers of
His Towns, Forts, Castles, and Ports, and other His loving Subjects whom it may
any way concern, not to suffer or permit any persons whatsoever, whether His
Majesty's own Subjects or Strangers, by virtue or pretense of Portugal
Commissions, to bring into His Majesty's Harbors, any Ships, Vessels, or
Prizes taken from the said States General or their Subjects, upon pain of being
severely punished.

Given at Our Honor of Hampton Court, the Twentieth day of June, 1662. in the
Fourteenth year of Our Reign. God save the King.
