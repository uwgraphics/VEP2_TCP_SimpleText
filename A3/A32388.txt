By the King.
A PROCLAMATION Concerning the Prorogation of the Parliament.
CHARLES R.

WHereas since Our last Session of Parliament the same was Prorogued by Us
until the third day of October then next coming and now near at hand, At which
time We did fully intend to have held Our next Session of Parliament at
Westminster, if it had pleased God to remove the Infection of the Plague from
the Cities of London and Westminster, Or to abate it in such measure that the
Parliament might have met there, without the manifest Peril of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons: And whereas the increase of the Plague
is now become so Dreadful, and the Infection thereof so generally dispersed in,
and about Our Cities of London and Westminster, that We have great reason to
fear We shall not be able to Assemble Our Parliament there where We chiefly
desired: We have therefore with the Advice of Our Privy Council thought fit,
and Do hereby Declare and Publish Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That the same
Parliament shall be again Prorogued from the Third of October unto the Ninth
day of the same October, and from the City of Westminster unto the City of
Oxford, Where We have taken care that good Accommodation be made and kept for
the several Members of both Our Houses of Parliament, to be there holden upon
the said Ninth of October. Whereof the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and all
and every the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the House of Commons, and all
others whom it does or may concern, are to take notice, and to order their
affairs accordingly; We letting them know, that although We shall not require
any of their Attendance at Westminster upon the said Third of October (except
such only who may conveniently be present at the making of the said Prorogation
in the usual manner) Nebertheless We do expect, and do hereby require and
strictly charge and command them, and every of them personally to appear at Our
said City of Oxford upon the said Ninth of October, then and there to proceed
in those Weighty and Urgent Affairs which shall be there handled, and shall be
most expedient for the general good of Us and Our Kingdoms.

Given at Our Court at Salisbury the Thirtieth day of August, in the
Seventeenth year of Our Reign. 1665.
God save the King.
