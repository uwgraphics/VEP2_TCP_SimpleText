TO THE READER.
Dear Friends,
THis Treatise was chiefly intended for the private use of me, and those of my
Family, that God had given me the tuition of; but upon the desire of some
Friends its now made public for your use and benefit; which through the
blessing of God (who many times uses weak instruments to accomplish great
designs;) I question not but it may.

The subject hereof is an Exposition of the Moral Law or ten Commandments,
the Confession of Faith or the Apostles Creed; and upon the Lords Prayer,
wherein all Christians may behold as in a Glass their duty both toward God and
their neighbor in their several relations, they may be Gods blessing grow
strong in faith and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, as also find
favor and comfortable acceptance with God by Prayer.

Despise it not for the plainness of the Style or Method, for therein have I
chiefly respected the ignorant and vulgar sort, whose edification and spiritual
grouth I much hunger after.

Well knowning and grieving that man's nature is so dull to receive and
entertain spiritual ex^rcises at the best; for as the Apostle says, The
natural man receives not the things that are of God, neither can he for they
are spiritualy discerned, nay inde^d he accounts them foolishness; And as there
is an aversness in Nature to heavenly doctrines, so the Will and Affections
being wholly settled upon the pleasures and profits of this life, do not solidly
regard and retain Divine Truths, most being as unwilling and unfitting to
learn, as they are unable and careless to apply Principles of saving knowledge
to their souls: for the Apostle Paul says of some among whom he preached, that
he could not speak to them as to men, but as unto babes; and that they were not
fit for strong meat, but for milk being babes, and tutors the Hebrews, that
after all his pains he was necessitated to lay again the Grounds, and first
Principles of the Doctrine of Christ amongst them, and whereas they might for
the time have been Teachers, they were yet fitter to be taught the very grounds
of Religion. And such I doubt we have amongst us, who after many years hearing
the Word are yet without spiritual and saving knowledge. Now for their sakes,
and for the unlearned, I have published this to the world, desiring with my
whole heart that none might perish, but that all might come to be saved in the
day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore to your serious perusal and diligent practice I heartily present it,
entreating that God from whom only comes all good, so by his Spirit to
accompany this and all other means of Knowledge to you, that in his mercy
through Jesus Christ your souls may be eternally saved, Which is the earnest
prayer of your poor Friend and Servant in our Lord Jesus Christ,

belongs to the order of my duty, my dear child, not so much to instruct thee
civilly Godliness in Childhood. D^ut. 4. 9. and thc 31. 12, 13. Psalm. 78. 3, 4.

in Learning and good Manners, as to furnish thy mind with good opinions, and
true Religion; for this age of childhood ought no less, yea also much more to
be trained with good Lessons to godliness then with good Arts to Humanity;
wherefore I thought meet to Examine thee by certain short Questions, that I may
surely know whither thou have well bestowed thy Study and Labor therein or no?


S^holar, And I, or my part, shall willingly answer your demands so far as I
have been able with wit to conceive or keep in memory, and can at this present
call to mind, and remember what I have heard you teach me out of the Holy
Scriptures.


Master. Go therefore now, and tell me what Religion thou professest.


Sch. The Religion that I profess is the same whereof the Lord Christ is the
Author C^^istian R^ligi^n. Ch^ist^ans named of Ch^i^t. Act. 11. 26.
and Teacher, and which is therefore properly and truly called the Christian
Religion, like as the Professors thereof are also named Christians.


Ma. Do thou then acknowledge thy self to be a Follower of Christian
Godliness and Religion, and a Scholar of our Lord and Savior Christ.


Sch. I do so acknowledge in deed, and do unfainedly and freely profess it, yea
I Romans 10. 9, 10.
do settle therein the sum of all my felicity, as in that which is the chiefest
good Psalm. 1. and 33. 12. Ioh. 3. 18.
that can come to man, and such as without it our State should be far more
miserable then the state of any bruit creature.


Ma. Well then, I would have the substance and nature of Christian Religion and
Godliness, the name whereof is most honorable and holy to be briefly expressed
with some definition of it.


Sch. Christian Religion is the true and The Definition. Deuteronomy 4. 1. 2. and 10.
12. Psalm. 19. 4.
godly worshipping of God, and the keeping of his Commandments.


Ma. Of whom do thou think it is to be learned?


Sch. Of none other surely of the heavenly Word of God himself, which he has
left unto us Written in the holy Psalm. 1. 2. and 78. 1. and 119. toto. Ioh. 3
39. 2 Timothy 3. 15.
Scripture.


Ma. What Writings be those which thou call the Word of God and the holy
Scriptures?


Sch. None other but those that have been published, first by Moses, and the
Prophets the friends of Almighty God, by the instinct of the holy Ghost in the
Exodus 32. 35, 16. 2 Pet. 1. 20.
Old Testament, and afterward more plainly in the New Testament by our Lord
Jesus Christ the Son of God, and by his holy Apostles inspired with the Spirit
of God, and have been preserved Ioh 1. 5. 9. and 8 12. Mat. 28 20. Ephe. 3. 5.
Isa. 40. 8. Mat. 5. 18.
unto our time whole and uncorrupted.


Ma. Why was it Gods Will so to open unto us his Word in Writing?


Sch. Because we of our selves (such is Ioh. 1. 5. 1 Cor. 21. Ephe. 4. 1^. Mat.
7 17. Heb. 10. 36. 1 Ioh. 2. 17.
the darkness of our hearts) are not able to understand the Will of Almighty
God, in the knowledge of whom, and in obedience toward him true godliness
consists, God having pity upon us has opened, and clearly set it out unto
Act 26. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 9.
us, and the same so clearly set out, he has left in the Book of the two
Testaments, Gal. 4. 24. Heb. 8 6. and 9. 15. Mat. 20. 26. 2 Timothy 3. 16. Mat 22.
29.
which are called the holy Scriptures, to the end that we should not be
uncertainly carried hither and thither, but that by his heavenly Doctrine there
should be made us, as it were a certain entry into heaven


Ma. Why do thou call Gods Word a Testament?


Sch. Because it is evident that in conceiving Mar. 12 24. Mat. 7. 21. and 12.
50. Gal. 3. 15, 17. Deuteronomy 4. 2. 5. 32. and 28. 14. Mat 15. 3, 4. 5, 6, 9.
of Religion it is the chief point to understand what is the Will of the
everliving God. And since by the name of Testament is signified not only a will,
but also a last and unchangeable Will, we are hereby admonished that in
Religion we follow nothing, nor seek for any thing further then we are therein
taught by God, but that as there is one only true God, so there is but one
godly worshipping and pure Religion of one only God, we should daily forge our
selves new fained Religions, and every Nation, every City, and every Man would
have his own several Religion, yea, we should in our doings follow for our guide
not Religion, and true godliness, the beginning and foundation of virtues, but
Superstition is a deceitful shadow of godliness, which is most plain to see, by
the sundry and innumerable, not religious, but worse then doting Superstitions
of the old Gentile Nation, who otherwise in Deuteronomy. 12. 13, and 13. 3, 4. Romans 1.
23.
worldly matters were wise men.


Ma. Do thou then affirm that all things necessary to godliness and
salvation, contained in the written Word of God?


Sch. Yea, for it were a point of intolerable Deuteronomy. 15 14, 18. Psalm. 12. 6.
and 18. 29. and 9. 6. etc. Ioh. 4. 25. 1 Cor. 1. 19. and 2. 6. Gal. 1 8, 9.
Col. 1. 25. Deuteronomy. 4 2 40. Pro. 30. 6. Isa. 10. 21.
ungodliness and madness to think either that God had left an unperfect
Doctrine, or that men were able to make that parfect, which God left unperfect,
therefore the Lord has most straightly forbidden men, that they neither add any
thing to, nor take any thing from his Word, nor turn any way, either to the
right hand or to the left.


Ma. If this be true that thou say, to what purpose then are so many things
so often in Councels and Ecclesiastical Assemblies decreed, and by learned men
taught in Preaching, or left in Writing?


Sch. All these things serve either to exponnding of dark places of the Word of
God, and to take away controversies that rise among men, or to the orderly
stablishing of the outward governance of the Church, and not to make new
Articles of Religion, for all things necessary to salvation, that is to say,
how Godliness, 2 Timothy 3 15, 16, 17.
Holiness, and Religion are to be purely and uncorruptedly yielded to God, what
obedence is to be given to God, by which alone the order of a godly li^e is to
be framed, what affiance we ought to put in God, how God is to be called upon,
and all good things to be imputed to him; what form is to be kept in
celebrating the divine Mysteries: all these things, I say, are to be learned of
the Word of God, without the knowledge whereof all things are either utterly
unknown or most absurdly done, so as it were far better that they were not
done at all, as the Lord himself witnesses, that ignorance of the Scriptures
is the Mat 2^. 29. Joh. 20. 9. Act, 23. 27. Mat. 19. 4* and 21. 13: Man. 7 6
(...). A^^^ 1^. 1^. and 15. ^^.
mother of all Errors, and he himself in his t^aching does commonly all^dge the
writt^n Word of God, and to it he send^^^ (...) ^^^rn of it; for this cause
ther^^^^* (...) times also, the Word of God wa^ op^^^y read in Churches, and
the help of expounders used when they might have them, as appears by the
His^ories of the Church, and the Lord himse^f immediately before his ascending
to heaven, gave principally in charge to his Apostles whom he had chosen, that
Mat. 18. 20. Mar. 16. 13. 15. Act. 14. 23.
they should instruct all men throughout the world with his word. And Paul
following his Example, ordained that some should be appointed in every Church
to teach the people, for he knew that Faith and all things pertaining to
godliness, do hang upon the reading and hearing of the word of God, and that
therefore Appostles, Teachers, Prophets Romans 10. 14. 17. 1 Cor. 12. 28. Ephesians.
4. 11. 12,
and Expounders are most necessary in the Church of God.


Ma. Do thou then think that we are bound to hear such Teachers and
Expounders:


Sch. Even as the Lord himself if he were present, so far as they teach only
those things which they have received of the Lord, which himself witnesses
saying, He that hears you hears me, He that Matthew. 10. 20. 40. Joh. 13. 20.
despises you despises me. Yea, and moreover to these Preachers of his word
he has given the power to bind and loose, that whose sins soever, they by the
Joh. 20. 23.
word of God, shall pardon or detain in Earth, the same shall be pardoned or
detained in Heaven.


Ma. Is it enough to hear them once treat of Religion.


Sch: We ought to be the Scholars of Matthew. 10. 22 and 24. 12. Rom* 11. 22
Christ to the end, or rather without end it is not therf^re enough for a man
to begin unle^^ (...), and such is our 1 Cor. 9. 24. 2 Timothy 3 14. Psalm. 106. ^.
14.
dullness an^ ^o g^tfulness, that we must often be taught and put in remembrance,
often pricked forward, as it were pulled by the Ear, for things but once or
seldom heard, are wont highly to slip out of mind, and for this cause (as is
aforesaid) every Sabbath day (as appears by the Ecclesiastical hystory) the
people Act 13. 15. 27. and 15. 21.
assembling together, the word was openly read, and the Expounders thereof, if
any were present, were heard, which custom is also at this day received in our
Churches by the Ordinane of the Apostles, and so of God himself.


Ma. Do thou then think, that the word of God is to be read in a strange
Tongue, and such as the people understand not.


Sch. That were grossly to mock God Dent. 4. 10. and 31. 11. 12. 13. Ios^a 8, 35.
and his people, and shamelesly to abase them both: For whereas God commands,
that his word be plainly read to young and old, men and women, namely, to the
intent that all may understand and learn to fear the Lord their God, as he
himself in his own word expressly witnesses; It were a very mockery, that the
word of God which is appointed by God himself to teach his people, should be
read to the people in a Tongue unknown to them, and whereof they can learn
nothing: Also Saint Paul does treat of this 1 Cor. 14. 1^.
matter, and thereupon concludes, that the unlearned people cannot answer,
Amen, to the Thanksgiving which they understand not; but that the Readers and
the Hearers should be strangers the one to the other, if any thing be spoken 1
Cor. 14. 18.
in the Congregation, that is understood of them that be present, and that he
had rather speak in the Church of God five words understood, then ten thousand
Psalm. 1. 2. and 9, 8, 9, 10.
words not understood.


Ma. Shall we then have sufficiently discharged our duties, if we so endeavor
our selves that we hear and understand Deuteronomy 27. 19. Gul. 5 6.
the word of God?


Sch. No, for we must not only hear and understand the word of God, but also
with stedfastness, and assent of mind embrace it as the Truth of God descending
from Heaven, and heartily love it, yiedling our selves to it, desirous and apt
to learn, and to frame our minds to obey it, that being once planted in our
hearts, it may take deep Root therein, and bring forth the fruits of a godly
life ordered according to the Rule thereof, that so it may turn to our
Salvation as it is ordained. It is therefore certain that we must with all our
travel endeavor, that in reading it, in studying upon it, and hearing it both
privately and publicly we may profit; but profit in any wise we cannot, if it
be set forth to us in a Tongue that we know not.


Ma. But shall we attain to such perfection as thou speak of, by only
reading the word of God, and diligently hearing it, and the Teachers of it.


Sch. Forasmuch as it is the Wisdom of God, men should vainly labor in either
Deuteronomy 29. 4. Act 16. 14. 2 Cor. 4. 6.
Teaching or Learning it, unless God would vouchsafe with the Teaching of his
Spirit to instruct our Hearts, as Paul teaches, That in vain is the planting
and the 1 Cor. 3. 7.
w^ter^ng unless God gives the Increase, Therefore that we attain the Wisdom of
God hidden in his word, we must with fervent Prayer crave of God, that with his
Spirit Psalm. 86 11. and 119. 33. 34. 35. Joh. 1. 5 1 Cor. 2. 14. Joh. 16. 13.
he lighten our minds being darkened with extreme Darkness. For him the Lord
has promised to us to be our Teacher s^nt from Heaven, that shall guide us
unto all Truth.


Ma. Into what chief parts do thou The di^ision of h^ word of ^od.
divide all the Word of God?


Sch. Into the Law and the Gospel.


Ma. How be these known then from the other?


Sch. The Law sets out our duties, both of godliness toward God, That is,
The true Worshipping of God, and of Charity toward our Neighbor, and severally
requires and exacteth our precise Mat. 12. 16. Mar. 12. 30. Joh. 3. 23. Levit.
26. toto Deuteronomy. 5. 32. and 28 toto. Joh. 14. 15. and 21: 23: Mar: 1. 15. and 16.
16. Ioh. 1. 17. Act: 2: 38: and 13. 28. Romans 1. 16. Gal. 3. 13. The sum of all
that has been said.
Obedience, and to the Obedient promises everlasting life, but to the
Disobedient, pronounces Threatenings and Pains, yea and eternal Death. The
Gospel contains the Promises of God, and to the offenders of the Law, so
that they repent them of their Offense, it promises that God will be merciful
through Faith in Christ.


Ma. Hitherto then thou have declared, that the word of God does teach us his
Will and contains all things needful to Salvation, and that we ought
earnestly to study upon it and diligently to hear the Teachers and Expounders
of it; but above all things, That we must by prayer obtain a Teacher from
Heaven, and what is the word of God, and of what parts it consists?


Sch. It is true.


Ma* Since then that Christian Religion flows out of Gods Word as out of a
Spring head as thou have before don with Gods Word, so now divide me also
Religion it self which is to be drawn out of Religion divided.
Gods Word into her parts and members, that we may plainly determine wher^unto
each part ought to be applied, and as it were to certain marks to be directed.


Sch. As of the word of God so of Religion, also there are principally two
parts, Levit. 16. 3. 14 Deuteronomy: 11: 6: Ioh. 14. 15. 21. 23. 24. Mar. 1. 15. and
15 15. 16. Rom 1. 16. and 3. 22. and 4 toto
Obedience, which the Law, the perfect Rule of Righteousness, commands; and
Faith, which the Gospel that imbraceth the Promises concerning the Mercy of
God, requires


Ma It seems yet that there are either more, or other parts of Religion for
some time in dividing it, the holy Scriptures do use other Names.


Sch. That is true, For sometime they divide whole Religion into Faith, and Gal.
5. 6. Mar. 1. 15. Mat. 22. 37: 39 Mar. 12. 30. 31 33.
sometime into Repentance and Faith, for sometime for Obedience, they set
Charity which by the Law is required to be perfect toward God and men: And
sometime Psalm. 14. 2. Rom 3 9. Mat. 4. 17. Act. 1. 38. Romans 3 20. and 7. 7.
Romans 3. 22. Gal: 2. 16: Psalm. 3^. 5: Ro^. 1^ 12 13 2 C^r. 1. 11. and 2 14.
Eph^s. 5. 4. ^0. ^sti^ 4 6. Coll 3: 17.
because we perform neither Obedience nor Charity such as we ought, they put in
place thereof Repentance most necessary for sinners to the obtaining of the
Mercy of God. Some which like to have more parts, do set forth first out of the
Law, the knowledge of our Duty, and Damnation by the Law for forsaking and
rejecting our Duty. Secondly out of the Gospel, The Knowledge and Affiance of
our Deliverance. Thirdly, Prayer and cra^ing of the mercy and help of God.
Fourthly, Thanksgiving for Deliverance, and other benefits of God; but
howsoever they differ in Names, they be the same things, and so those two
principal parts, Obedience and Faith, in which is contained all the sum and
substance of Religion, all the rest are referred: For whereas many do add as
parts, Invocation and Thanksgiving, and the divine mysteries most nearly
conjoined to the same, which are commonly called Sacraments, these in very Deed
are comprised within those two former parts, for no man can truly perform the
Duty toward God either of Affiance, or of Obedience, which will not when any
necessity distresseth him to fly to God, and account all things to come from
him, and when occasion and time serves, rightly use his holy mysteries.


Ma. I agree with thee, that all may be drawn to these two parts, if a man will
precisely, and some what narrowly treat of them, but forasmuch as the most
precise manner of dividing is not to be required of Children, I had rather that
somewhat in plainer sort thou divide Religion into more parts that the whole
matter may be made the clearer, therefore let us handle these things more
grossly, so it be more openly.


Sch. Where you like best to deal with me in plainer sort, I may conveniently
of two parts, make four, and divide whole Religion into Obedience, Faith,
Invocation, and Sacraments.


Ma. Go to then, since I desire to have this treating of Religion to be as plain
as may be, let us keep this Order.

First, To enquire of Obedience which the Law requires.

Secondly, Of Faith, which looks to, and imbraceth the promises of the
Gospel.

Thirdly, Of Invocation and Thanksgiving, which two are most nearly joined
together.

Fourthly and lastly, of the Sacraments and Mysteries of God.


Sch. And I shall willingly according to my slender capacity answer your
questions, as I am taught by the Holy Scriptures.


The first Part. Of the Law and Obedience.
MAster, Forasmuch as our Obedience Levit. 26. 3: Deuteronomy. 10. 13. and 28. toto.
Psalm. 119. 4.
whereof we have first to speak, is to be tried by the Rule of the Law of God,
it is necessary that we first search out the whole substance and nature of the
Law which being found and known, it it cannot be unknown what, and of what sort
our Obedience ought to be, therefore begin to tell me, what thou think of the
Law.


Sch. I think that the Law of God is the Deuteronomy: 4* 2: and 5: 32: and 31: 4:
Psalm: 19: 6: 7: Exodus, 20: toto and Deuteronomy 5: Isa 30. 21. Deuteronomy: 6: 17: 18. and 13.
18. Romans 12. 2. Ephesians. 5. 17. 8. 6. 7.
full and in all points, a perfect Rule, of the Righteousness that is required
of man, which commands those things that are to be done, and forbids the
contraries. In this Law God has restrained all things to his own Will and
Judgment, so as no godliness toward him, nor dutifullness toward men, can be
allowed of him, but that only which does in all things agree with the
straightness of this rule. vainly therefore do mortal men invent to themselves
forms of godliness Isa 26. 13. Mar 15. 3. 9. Exodus 31. 18. and ^4. 28. 29.
Deuteronomy. 4. 13. Mat. 22. 36. 40 1 Ioh. 3. 23. Deuteronomy. 5. 32. and 10 12. and 11. 20.
1. Ioh. 3. 24
and duties after their own fancy, for God has set forth his Law written in
two Tables as a most sure Rule both of our worshipping of God, and of our
Duties to men, and therewith has declared, that there is nothing on earth more
pleasant and acceptable to him then our Obedience.


Ma. Whereof treats the first Table?


Sch. It treats of our godliness toward Deuteronomy. 6. 5. Mat. 22: 36.
God and contains the first four Commandments of the Law.


Ma. Whereof treats the second Table.


Sch. Of the Duties of mutual Charity or Love among men, which contains Mat.
22. 39. Romans 13. 8. 9. Gal. 5. 14. Exodus 35* 28. Deuteronomy. 4. 14.
six Commandments, and so in a Sum the ten Commandments make up the whole
Law, for which cause the Law is called the ten Commandments.


Ma. Rehearse me the first Commandment of the first Table. Exodus 20. 1. 2, 3.
Deuteronomy. 5 6, 7. Psalm. 81. 8. 9. Mich. 6. 4.



Sch. God spoke thus, Hear O Israel, I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee
out of the Land of Egypt out of the House of Bondage, Thou shall have none
other Gods before me.


M. Why does God first speak somewhat of himself and of his benefit?


S. He had principally care that the Levit. 26. toto. Deuteronomy. 6. 6.
estimation of the Laws ordained by him should not be shortly abated by
contempt, and therefore that they might Deuteronomy. 10 12. Psalm. 135. and 136. 1. Isa
8, 13. and 43. 1. Mala 2. 10. 1 Timothy 6. 14, 15, 16. Mala. 1. 5, 6.
have the greater Authority, he used this as it were an entry, I am the Lord
thy God. In which words he teaches that he is our Maker, Lord and Savior, and
the Author of all good, and so with good right by his dignity a Lawmakers, he
challenges to himself the authority of commanding, and by his goodness, he
procures favor to his Law, and by them both together binds us with
necessity to obey it, unless we will be both Rebels against him that is most
mighty and unthankful toward him that is most bountiful.


S. But whereas he speaks of Israel by name, and makes expressly mention of
breaking the yoke of Bondage of Egypt, does not this belong only to the people
of Israel?


S. God indeed rescued the I^raelites by his servant Moses from bodily bondage,
Exodus 12. 14.
but he has delivered all them that be Joh. 8 34 36. Rom 6. 20. ^ol. 1. 13.
Heb. 2. 14, 1. 5. Acts 10. 38.
his by his, Son Jesus Christ from the spiritual thraldom of sin, and the
tyranny of the devil, wherein clse they had lien pressed and oppessed; this kind
of deliverance pertains indifferently to all men Romans 3 22. Job. 8. 51. Joh.
5. 11. Psalm 78. 13, 14, and 1^3. 2. Jer. 2 6. 2 Timothy 2. 26. 1 Pet. 5 8. Psalm 40
2. Isa. 59 3. 2 Pet. ^0. 22. Mat. 13 40. 2 Pet. 2 4. 2 Pet. 2. 20*
which put their trust in God their deliverer, and do t^ their power obey his
Laws, which if they do not, he does by this rehearsal of his most great benefit
pronounce that they shall be guilty of most great unthankfulness, for let every
man imagine the devil that hellish Pharao ready to oppress him, and how sin is
that most foul mire wherein he most filthily walloweth, let him set before the
eyes of his mind Hell the most wretched Egyptian Bondage, and then shall he
easily perceive, that this freedom whereof I speak is the thing which he ought
principally to desire as the thing of most Mat. 16. 26. Act^ 26 18. Romans 16. 20.
great importance to him whereof yet he shall be most unworthy, unless he honor
the Author of his deliverance Isa. 17. 10. Ioh. 14. 15. Romans 6. 13. 1 Cor: 6
19.
with all Service and Obedience.


M. Say on.


S. After that he had thus stablished the authority of his Law, now follows
the Commandment, Thou shall have no other Gods before me.


M. Tell me what this means.


S. This Commandment condemns and forbids Idolatry, which God thoroughly
hates. Levit. 26. 1. Deuteronomy. 12. 3. Jud. 10. 6. 16.



M. What is Idolatry, or to have strange gods?


S. It is the place of the one only true God, which has openly and manifestly
showed and disclosed himself unto us in Deuteronomy. 6. 4, 5. Mat. 12. 29. 32.
the holy Scriptures, to set other persons or things, and of them to frame and
make Isa. 44. 17. Dan 3. 5. 7. 12, 15.
to our selves as it were certain gods to worship them as gods, and set and
repose our trust in them, for God commands us to acknowledge him alone D^ut.
4 35, 30. and 6. 4, 5. Man. 12. 29. 32. Deuteronomy. 10. 20. Act. 10. 25. 26.
for our only God, that is, that of those things that wholly belong to his
Majesty, and which we owe to him alone, we transfer not any part, be it never
so little to any other, but to him alone and entirely we give his whole honor
and service, whereof to yield any whit to any other were a most heinous offense.


M. What be the things that we properly owe to God alone, wherein thou say
that his proper and peculiar Worshipping consists?


S. Innumerable are the things which we owe to God, but they all may be reduced
to four chief Points.


M. Which be they?


S. That we give unto his Majesty the Deuteronomy. 10. 12. Psalm. 29. 2. etc. and 96.
6, 7. Mat. 22. 37. 1 John 4. 17. and 5. 10. Psalm. 50. 6. Mat. 6. 9. Psalm. 34.
66. toto. Levit. 26. 2. Deuteronomy. 7. 6. Psalm. 95. 6, 7. and 33. 12. Heb. 8. 10.
Psalm. 33. 14. Isa. 29. 15. Jer. 17. 9, 10* Heb. 4. 13.
sovereign honor, and to his goodness the greatest love and affiance that we
flee to him and crave his help, that with thankfulness we yield as due to him,
our selves, and all that we have, these things are to be given as to none
other, so to him alone, if we desire to have him alone our God, and to be his
peculiar people.


M. What means those last words, Before me, or in my sight?


S. That we cannot once so much as tend to revolting from God, but that God is
witness of it; for there is nothing so close nor so secret that can be hid from
him: Moreover, he thereby declares that he requires not only the honor of
open confession, but also inward Isa. 1. 16. and 29. 13, 15. Mat 5. 8. and 15.
8, 12.
and sincere godliness of heart, for that he is the Understander and Judge of
secret thoughts.


M. Well then let this be enough said of the first Commandemement; now let us
go on to the Second.


S. Thou shall not make to thy self any grav^n Image, nor the likeness of any
thing Exodus 20. 4. Levit. 26. 1. Deuteronomy 4 15. and 5. 8, 9. 10 and 17. 15. Psalm.
97. 7. Isa: 42. 8.
that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, nor in the water
under the earth, thou s^alt not bow down to them nor worship them, for I the
Lord thy God am a Jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth g^n^ration of them that hate me, and show
mercy unto thousands in them that love me and keep my Commandments.


M. What is the meaning of these words?


S. As in the first Commandment, He commands that himself alone be honored
and worshipped, so in this Commandment He restrains us from all superstition
and from all wrongful and bodily inventions, for as much as the wo^shipping of
him ought to be spiritual and pure; and chiefly he fraieth us from the most
gross fault of outward Isa: ^. 18. Ioh. 4 23, 24.
Idolatry.

It seems then that this Law wholly condemns Psalm: 78. 64. Isa: 42. 8. 17.
and 44 9: ^e^: 10. 14. ^evit: 26. 1. Deuteronomy 4. 15. Isa: 40. 18. and 46. 5, 6.
the Arts of Painting and Portraiture, so that it is not lawful to have any
Images made at all.


S. Not so, but he first forbids us to make any Images to express or
counterfeit God or to worship him withal; and Psalm: 78. 64. Acts 17. 19. Deuteronomy:
5 8, 9. Psalm: 97. 7. and 106. 34. Isa: 44. 17. 19. Psalm: 115. 3, 4. Isa: 40.
10. etc. 1 Ioh. 4. 2. Romans 1. 20 23. Isa: 2. 18. 19. Isa: 40 18 19. and 46. 5,
6. Jer. 10. 14. Acts 17. 29.
secondly he charge us not to worship the Images themselves.


M. Why is it not lawful to express God with a bodily and visible form?


S. Because there can be no likness or agreeing between God which is a Spirit,
Eternal, Unmeasurable, Infinite, incomprehensible, severed from all mortal
composition, and a frail, bodily silly Spiritless and vain shape, therefore
they do most injuriously abate the Majesty of the most good and most great
God, when they go about in such sort to make resemblance of him.


M. Have not they then said well which affirm that Images are unlearned men's
Books?


S. I know not what manner of books they be; but surely concerning God they can
teach us nothing but Errors.


M. What manner of worshipping is that, which is here condemned?


S. When we intending to pray do Psalm: 97. 7. and 106. 34. Isa: 44. 17, 19.
Dan. 3. 5. 7. Hosea 11. 2. Mich. 5. 12. Acts 7. 41.
turn our selves to Portraitures or Images, when we do fall down and kneel
before them with uncovering our heads, or with other signs showing any honor
unto them, as if God were represented unto us by them: briefly, we are in this
Law forbidden, that we neither seek nor worship God in Images, or which is all
one, that we worship not the Images themselves in honor of God, nor in any
wise by Idolatry or Superstition, abuse them with injury to his Majesty,
otherwise the lawful use of making Portraitures Ezekiel. 41. 19. Mat. 22. 20*
and of Painting is not forbidden.


M. By this that thou tellest me it may be easily gathered that it is very
perilous to set any Images or Pictures in Churches Deuteronomy. 7 5. and 27. 15. Isa.
10. 10, 11. and 30: 22. Ezekiel. 6. 4 Mar. 13. 31.
which are properly appointed for the only worshipping of God.


S. That is true, we have had already too much experience by the decay, in a
manner, of whole Religion.


M. Yet there remains a certain, as it were, addition or appendant of this
Law:


S. For (says he) I the Lord your God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of
the Fathers Exodus 20. 5. Deuteronomy. 5. 9. and 6. 15. Psalm. 78 58. Nah. 1. 2.
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.


M. To what end, or wherefore were these things spoken?


S. These serve to this end, to stablish and confirm this Law by adding, as it
were, a certain special decree, for in naming himself our Lord and our God, he
does by two Reasons, that is, in respect Deuteronomy. 10. 12. 1 Timothy 6. 15.
of his Authority and of his bountifulness urge us to obey him in all things;
and by this word Jelousie he declares Exodus 34: 14: Jos. 24. 19. Isa. 42. 8.
that he can abide no partner or equal.


M. What is the reason of this Jelousie that thou speak of?


S. A most just Reason, for since that to us which have nothing deserved, only
Psa. 44 4, 9. Isa. 48. 9. Romans 5. 8. and 11 35. 2 Timothy 2. 1. 9. Mat. 4. 10. and
22. 37. Jer. 2. 2. 2 Cor. 11. 2. Ephesians. 5. 24.
his own infinite goodness he has given himself, by most good right it is that
he will have us to be wholly altogether and entirely his own, for this is that
bond, as it were, of a holy marriage whereinto God the faithful husband, our
souls as chaste Spouses are coupled, whose chastity stands in this, to be
dedicate to God alone, and to cleave wholly to him, like as on the other side
our souls are said to be defiled with adultery, when they swerve Jer. 2. 20.
and 3. 1. etc. Ezekiel. 6. 9. and 16. 15.
from God to Idolatry or Superstition, and how much more heartily the husband
loves his wife, and the chaster he is himself, so much is he more greviously
displeased with his wife when she breaks her faith.


M. Go on.


S. Now to the intent to show more vehemently how he hates Idolatry, and with
greater fear to restrain us from offending therein, he threatens that he will
take vengeance, not only of them that Exodus 3. 7. Deuteronomy. 5. 9, 10. and 7. 9, 10.
Isa 14. 20, 21.
shall so offend, but also of their children and posterity.


M. But how does this agree with the righteousness of God, that any one should
be punished for an others offense?


S. The very state of mankind does sufficiently Psa. 1. 4 etc. Rom: 3 9 10
Ephe: 2. 3.
assoyle this question, for by nature we are all subject to damnation, in which
state if God do leave us, we have no cause to complain of him, and as toward
the godly he showed his love and mercy in defendi^g and cherishing their D^ut
4. 37. Psa: 37. 25 and 69 and 112. 2.
posterity with giving them their preservation which he owed them not; so
toward the ungodly he executes his vengance in withholding that his goodness
Isa: 14. 20. and 48. 18.
from their children, and yet in the mean time he does them no wrong, in that
he gives them not the grace which he owes Exodus: 33. 69. Rom: 9 14. and 11. 35.
them not, but as he found them, so he leaves them to their own disposition
and nature.


M. Go forward to the rest.


S. That he should not seem to enforce us only with threatening now follows
the other part, wherein God with gentle and liberal promises, entreats, and
allureth us to obey him, for he promises Gen: ^^. 17. and 26. 4. D^ut: ^ 10.
and 7, 9.
that he will show most great mercifulness both toward themselves that love him
add obey his Commandments, and also toward all their Posterity.


M. By what reason do thou think this to be righteous.


S. Some reason it is because of the godly Gen: 18. 19. Deuteronomy: 4. 9, 10. and 32.
46. Psalm: 132. 11.
education wherein godly Parents do so instruct their children that they
commonly use to succeed them as their heirs in the true fear and love of God;
also nature it self draws us to a good will toward our friends, children,
but the surest reason is, that God so promises, Deuteronomy: 32 4. Jer: 2 4 Rom: 9.
14. and 4 20. 1 Cor: 1. 9. 2 Cor. 1: 18. Ezekiel: 18. 9. 10.
which neither can swerve from righteousness, nor at any time break his promise.


M. But it appears that this is not continually certain, and ever falls so;
for sometimes godly Parents beget ungodly children, and such as go out of kind
from the Parents goodness whom God (notwithstanding this promise) has
grievously punished.


S. This indeed cannot be denied, for as God, when he will, shows himself
merciful to the children of the wicked, so is he by no such necessity bounden
to the children of the godly, but that he is at liberty to reject such of them
as he will, Exodus: 33: 19. Ios: 23. 14. Rom: 3. 3. and 9 14. 2 Pet: 3. 9.
but therein he always uses such moderation that the truth of his promise ever
remains steadfast.


M. Wherefore we speaking of revenging, he named but three or four generations
at the most, why does he here, in speaking of mercy contain a thousand?


S. To show that he is much more inclined Exodus 34. 6: Psalm. 30. 5. and 103. 8.
and 145. 8. Isa. 54. 7, 8:
to mercifulness and to liberality, then he is to severity, like as also in an
other place he professes that he is very slow to wrath, and most ready to
forgive.


M. By all this that thou have said, I see thou understandest that God made
special provision that the worshipping of him, which ought to be spiritual and
most pure should not be defiled with any gross Idolatry or Superstition.


S. Yea, he must earnestly provide for it, for he has not only plainly and
largly reckoning up all forms of Images, decreed Exodus 20. 4: Deuteronomy 4 16. and 5.
8.
it, in a manner, in the first part of his Law as a thing that principally
concerns his Majesty, but also has confirmed this law with terrible
threatenings Exodus 20. 5, 6. Levit. 26 30. Deuteronomy. 4. 26. and 5. 9. 10. and 27. 15.
Psalm. 96. 8. 7. Ezekiel. 6. 4.
to the offender, and on the other side offering most great rewards to the
observer of it; so that this Commandment either was not understood, as being
obscure, or not espied as lying hid in the multitude, or not regarded as light
or of small charge, yea that it has lain as it were neglected of all men
wholly, as if it had been no Commandment with no threatenings, no promises
adjoining unto it.


M. It is true as thou say, but now rehearse me the third Commandment.


S. Thou shall not take the Name of the Exodus 20. 7. Levit. 80. 12. Deuteronomy. 5. 12.
Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes
his Name in vain.


M. Tell me what it is to take the Name of God in vain.


S. To abuse it, either with forswearing, Levit. 19. 12. Psalm. 15. 4. 1 Timothy 1.
10. Eccle. 23. 9. Mat. 5. 33.
or with swearing rashly, unadvisedly, and without necessity, or with once
naming it without a weighty cause, for since the Majesty of Gods Name is most
Deuteronomy. 28. 58. Psalm. 8. 1. Jer. 10. 6.
holy, we ought by all means to beware, that we seem not, either to despise it
our selves, or to give others any occasion to despise it; yea, and so to see
that we may never once utter the Name of God without Psalm: 48. 9. and 13. 1.
etc.
great reverence, that it may ever appear honorable and glorious, both to our
selves and to all others; for it is not lawful once to think, much less to
speak of God Eccles. 22. 9. and 19, 33.
and his works, otherwise then to his Honor: Briefly, whosoever uses the Name
of God otherwise then for most weighty causes, and for most holy matters
abuses it.


M. What think thou then of them that blasphem God, and of Sorcerers, and
such other kind of ungodly men?


S. If they do great injury to God, to God which use his Name of a certain lewd
Ecclus. 23. 9. Matthew: 5. 34.
Custom and untemperate readiness of speech, much more do they make themselves
guilty of a most heinous and outrageous offense which abuse the Name of Deuteronomy.
18. 11. ^sa. 8. 19. and 47. 9. and 52. 5. Mal. 3 5. Acts 19. 13. Gal. 5. 20.
Exodus: 22: 11. Jos: 2 12. and 9. 15. Psalm: 15. 6. and 63. 11. 2 Cor. 11. 31.
Gal. 1. 20. Exodus 22. 11. Jos: 2 12. Gal: 1. 20.
God in bannings, in cursings enchantments, in forespeakings, or in other
manner of superstition.


M. Is there any lawful using of the Name of God in swearing?


S. Yea cettainly, when an Oath is taken for a just cause, either to affirm a
truth, specially if the Magistrate require or command it, or for any other
matter of great importance, wherein we are either to maintain unviolate the
honor of God, or preserve mutual agreement and charity among men.


M May we therefore lawfully whenever we say truth use an Oath with it?


S. Since I have already said that this is not lawful, for so the estimation
and reverence of the Name of God should be abated and should become of no price
Exodus 22. 11. Jos. 2. 2. 12. 12. (...). 1 20.
and contemned as common, but when in a weighty matter the truth should
otherwise not be believed we may lawfully confirm it with an Oath.


M. What follows next.


S. For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.


M. Since God does in other places pronounce that he will punish generally all
the breakers of his Law, why does he here particularly threaten them that abuse
Levit: 26. 14. Deuteronomy. 28. 15. etc.
his Name?


S. His meaning was to show how highly he esteems the glory of his Name, to the
end that seeing punishment ready for us, Levit: 19 12. Deuteronomy: 5. 11. Jer: 51. 56
Ezekiel: 10. 8. and 9. 14.
we should so much the more heedfully beware of prophainly abusing it


M. Do thou think it lawful to swear by the names of Saints, or by the names
of other men or creatures?


S. No, for since a lawful Oath is nothing else but the swearers religious
affirming that he calls and uses God, the Knower and Judge of all things for
witness that he swears a true Oath, and Exodus 22. 11. Heb. 6. 16.
that he calls upon, and wishes the same God to be the punisher and revenger
of his lying, and offense if he swear falsely; it were a most heinous sin to
part or communicate among other persons or creatures, this honor of Gods
Wisdom and Majesty which is his own proper and peculiar honor.


M. Now remains the fourth Commandment, Deuteronomy: 6. 13. and 10 20. Ios. 23. 7.
Isa: 65. 16. Exo: 16. 23. and 20. 8. and 31. 13.
which is the last Commandment of the first Table.


S. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabath day, six days shall thou labor and
do all that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Levit. 23. 3. Deuteronomy. 5.
12. Ezekiel. 20. 12.
Sabath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, nor
thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, thy cattle and
the stranger that is within thy gates, for in six days the Lord Cen. 2. 1, 2,
3. Heb. 43, 16.
made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
seventh day, wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.


M. What means this word Sabath?


S. Sabath by Interpretation signifies Rest that day, for that it is appointed
Exodus 16. 23. Levit. 16 31. Jer. 17. 21. Neh: 13. 19. Ezekiel 46. 3. Mar. 6. 3.
only for the worshipping of God, the godly must lay aside all wordly business,
that they may the more diligently intend to Religion and godliness.


M. Why has God set herein before us an example of himself for us to follow?


S. Because notable and noble Examples Tob. 2. 12. Joh. 13. 13, 15. 1 Cor. 4.
16. and 11. 1. Heb. 4. 3, 4, 9. 10. and 12. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 21.
do more thoroughly stir up and sharpen men's minds, for servants do willingly
follow their Master, and children their Parents, and nothing is more to be
desired of men then to frame themselves to the Example and Imitation of God.


M. Say thou then that we must every seventh day abstain from all labor?


S. This Commandment has a double consideration, for in so much as it
contains a ceremony, and requires only outward rest, it belongs
particularly to 1 Cor. 10. 1. Gal. 4. 2, 3, 4. Col. 2. 16, 17. Heb. 8. 5. and
10. 1. 2 Cor. 3. 14. Col. 2 16. Heb. 10. 1.
the Jews, and has not the force of a continuing and eternal Law, but now by
the coming of Christ, as the other shadows of Jewish Ceremonies are abrogated,
so is this Law also in this behalf abridged.


M. What then, beside the Ceremony, is there remaining whereunto we are still
perpetually bound?


S. This Law was ordained for three Mar. 1. 21. Acts 13. 14. and 15. 21. Exodus
21. 2. Deuteronomy. 5. 14. Gal. 3. 26, 28. Isa. 58. 13. Romans 13 12. Heb. 4 9, 10.
causes. First, to stablish and maintain an Ecclesiastical Discipline, and a
certain Order of the Christian Commonweal. Secondly, to provide for the state
of servants that it may be tolerable: Thirdly, to express a certain Form and
Figure of the spiritual Rest.


M. What is that Ecclesiastical Discipline that thou speak of?


S. That the people assemble together Mar. 6 4, Psalm. 95. 7. Mat. 10. 3^. Isa.
56. 7. Mar 1. 21. 13. Ephe. 3. 21. Heb. 2. 12. Psalm. 22. 23. and 35. 21. 1.
Cor. 14. 26.
to hear the Doctrine of Christ, to yield confession of their faith, to make
openly public prayers to God, to celebrate and retain the memory of good Works
and Benefits, and to use the Mysteries that he has left us.


M. Shall it be enough to have done these every seventh day?


S. These things indeed every man privately Psalm. 1. 2. and 84. 4. Ephe. 5. 20.
ought to record and think upon every day, but for our negligence and weakness
one certain special day is by Publik Order appointed for this matter.


M. Why was there in this Commanment provision made for relieving of servants.


S. It was reason that they which be under other men's power should have Deuteronomy.
3. 14. and 15. 12. 15. Jer: 34, 12.
some time to rest from labou^ for else their state should be too grievous and
too hard to bear, and surely meet it was that servants should together with us
sometime serve him who is the common Psalm: 134 1. Gal: 3. ^6. 28. Ephesians. ^ 9. Col
3. 11.
Master of them and us, yea, and Father too, since he has by Christ adopted
them to himself as well as us. It is also profitable for the Masters themselves
that servants ^^^t. 5. 14. (...).
should some time rest between their workings, that after respiting their work
a while, they may return more fresh and lusty to it again.


M. Now it remains for thee to tell of the spiritual rest.


S. That is, when resting from worldly business, and from our own Works and
Isa. 14. 16. and 51. 13.
Studies, and as it were having a certain holy Vocation, we yield our selves
wholly to Gods governance, that he may do his Works in us; and when (as the
Scripture terms it) we crucify our flesh, we Heb 4 9. Gal. 5. 24. Col. 3. 5.
bridle the froward desires and motions of our heart, restraining our own
nature that we may obey the Will of God, for so shall we most aptly reduce and
bring the Figure and Image of eternal rest to the very Thing and Truth it self.


M. May we then cast away this care on the other days?


S. No, for when we have once begun, Mat. 24. 19:
we must go forward to the end, throughout the whole race of our life, and the
number of seven, for as much as in the Gen: 2. 2, 3. Psalm: 12. 6.
Scripture it signifies Perfection, puts us in remembrance that we ought
with all our force and endeavor continually to labor and travel toward
perfection, Gen: 17. 1. Mat: 5, 48.
and yet therwithall is it showed us, that so long as we live in this world we
are far from perfection and full attaining of 1 Cor: 2. 9.
this spiritual rest, and that here is given us but a certain taste of that Rest
which we shall enjoy perfectly, fully, and most Isa: 25. 8. 1 Cor: 2 9. 2 These.
1. 7.
blessedly in the Kingdom of God.


M. Hitherto thou have well rehearsed me the Laws of the first Table, wherein
the true worshipping of God which is the fountain of all good things is briefly
comprehended: now therefore I would have thee tell me what be the Duties of our
Charity and Love toward men, which duties do spring and are drawn out of the
same fountain, and which are contained in the second Table?


S. The second Table begins thus, Exodus 20. 12. Deuteronomy. 5. 16. Mar. 25. 4.
Ephesians. 6. 2, 3.
Honor thy Father and thy Mother that thy days may be long in the land which
the Lord thy God gives thee.


M. What is meant in this place by the word Honor?


S. The honor of Parents contains love, fear, and reverence, and consists
Pro. 1. 8. Mar. 7. 10. 12. Col. 3. 20 1 Timothy 5. 4. Heb. 12 9.
as in the proper work and duty of it in obeying them, and also finding and
relieving them if ever they be in need.


M. Does the Law extend only to Parents by Nature?


S. Although the very words seem to express no more, yet we must understand
Deu^. 17. 1^. Romans 13 1. 1 Timothy 5. 1. Pro. 5. 13. Ioh. 9. 31. Levit. 10. 32.
Pro. 19. 10.
that all those to whom any Authority is given, as Magistrates, Ministers of
the Church, Schoolmasters; Finally, all they that have any Ornament, either of
reverend age, or of wit, wisdom, or learning, worship or wealthy state, or
otherwise be our Superiors, are contained under the name of Fathers, because
the Authority both of them and Fathers come out of one Fountain.


M. Out of a what Fountain?


S. The holy Decree of the Laws of God, by which they are become worshipful
Deuteronomy. 17. 10. Tit. 3 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13.
and honorable as well as natural Parents, for from thence they all, whether
they be Parents, Princes, Magistrates or other Superiors whatsoever they be,
have all their power and authority, because by these it pleased God to rule and
govern the world.


M. What is meant by this, that he calls Magistrates and other Superiors by
the name of Pa^ents?


S. To teach us, that they are given us of God, both for one and publik
benefit, and also by example of that authority Romans 13. 4. Heb. 13. 17.
which of all other is naturally least grudged at, to train and inure the mind
Pro. 3. 12. Mat. 7. 9. 1. These. 2. 11. Exodus 32, 9.
of man, which of it self is puffed with pride and loath to be under others
Commandemement, to the duty and obedience toward Magistrates; for by the name
of Parents, we are charged not only to yield to and obey Magistrates, but also
to honor and love them; and likewise on the other part, Superiors are taught
so to govern their inferiors as a just Parent uses to rule over good children.


M. What means that promise which is added to the Commandment?


S. That they shall enjoy long life, and shall long continue in sure and
steadfast possession of wealth that give just and Exodus 20. 12. Deuteronomy. 5. 16.
Ephesians. 6. 2, 3.
due honor to their Parents and Magistrates.


M. But this promise seems to belong particularly to such Jews as be kind to
their parents?


S. It is no doubt but that which is by name spoken of the Land of Canaan,
pertains Genesis 12. 7. and 13. 15. Deuteronomy. 34. 4. Gen: 1. 1. Psalm 24. 1. and 1
15. 16. Dan: 4. 22.
only to the Jews; but for as much as God is Lord of the whole world, what
place soever he gives us to dwell in, the same he promises and assures us in
this Law that we shall keep still our Possession.


M. But why does God reckon for a benefit, long continued age in such a
miserable and wicked life?


S. Because when he releiveth the miseries Psa. 18. 1, 2, 3. Jer. 14 8. Heb. 2.
15.
and calamities of them that be his, or preserves them in so many perils that
beset them round about, and calls them back from vices and sins, he shows
to them a fatherly mind and good will as to his children.


M. Does it follow on the contrary side, that God hates them whose life is
taken away quickly or before their ordinary race of years expired, or that be
distressed with miseries and adversities of this world?


S. Nothing less, but rather the dearlier that any man is beloved of God, he
Ioh. 1. 12. and 5. 17. Prove. 3* 12: Mat. 5. 10. 11.
is commonly the more burdened with adversaries, or is wont the sooner to
remove out of this life, as he were delivered, and let by God out of prison?


M. Does not this in the mean time seem to abate the truth and credit of Gods
Promise?


S. No, for when God does promise us worldly good things, he always adds
this exception, either expressly uttered or Deuteronomy. 21. 1, 2. Isa. 1. 19, 20. Jer.
12. 4, 9.
secretly employed, that is, that the same be not unprofitable or hurtful to our
souls, for it were against Order and Reason, if chief regard should not be had
of Mat. 5. 29. and 18. 8. 2 Cor. 6. 8.
the soul, that we may so either attain or lack worldly commodities as we may
with blessedness enjoy eternal life for ever.


M. What shall we then say of them that be disobedient to Parents or
Magistrates, or do misuse them yea or kill them. Exodus 21. 17. Levit. 20. 9.
Deuteronomy. 12. 18. etc. Pro. 13: 17.



S. Commonly all such do either continue a most vile and miserable life or lose
it most shamefully being taken out of it with untimely and cruel death, or
infamous execution, and not only in this life, but also in the world to come,
they shall Mat. 15. 4: Romans 1. 30. 3^. and 13: 2, ^.
for ever suffer the everlasting punishment of their ungodliness, for if we be
forbidden by the Commandment of God as here next follows to hurt any men be
they never so much estranged from us, yea, even our adversaries and deadly
enemies, much more to kill them; Levit. 19. 17. Mat. 5. 21. etc. Luk 3. 14.
surely it is easy to perceive how much we ought to forbear and beware of
doing of any injury to our Parents of whom we receive our life, inheritance,
liberty and Count^^; and since it is notable well said by the wise men in old
time, that natural dut^ may be broken with a look, and that i^ is a most
heinous wickedness once to offend his Parents with word or speech; what
punishment can be found sharp enough for him that shall offer death to his
Parent, for whom himself ought to have been content to die by the Law of God
and man, if need so required.


M. But it is much more heinous for a man to offend or kill the Parent of his
Country then his own Parent.


S. Yea surely, for if it be for every private man a heinous offense to offend
his private parents, and parricide to kill them, what shall we say of them that
have conspired and born wicked armor against the Commonweal, against their
Country, the most ancient sacred and common Mother of us all, which ought to
be dearer unto us then our selves, and for whom no honest man will stick to dye
to do it good, and against, the Prince the Father of the Country it self and
Parent of the Commonweal: yea, and to imagine the overthrow, death and
destruction of them, whom it is high treason once to forsake or shrink from: so
outragi^us ^ thing can in no wise be expressed with sit a name.


M. Now rehearse the sixth Commandment.


S. Thou shall not kill. Exodus 20. 13. Mat. 5. 21.



M. Shall we sufficiently fulfill this Law, if we keep our hands clean from
slaughter and blood?


S. God made this Law not only for Deuteronomy. 30 6. Psalm. 24. 4. Mat. 9. 4. Heb. 3.
12. Matt. 5. 21. 22, 23. Gal. 5* 20. 1 Ioh. 2. 11:
outward works, but also and chiefly for the affections of the heart for anger
and hatred, and every desire to hurt is before God adjudged manslaughter,
therefore these by his Law He forbids us.


M. Shall we then fully satisfy the Law if we hate no man?


S. God in condemning hatred, requires Mat. 5. 23. 25 24. Romans 12. 18.
love toward all men, even our enemies, yea, so far as to wish health,
safety, and all good things to them that wish us evil, and do bear us a hateful
and cruel mind, as much as in us lies to do them good.


M. What is the seventh Commandment?


S. Thou shall not commit adultery.


M. What do thou think to be contained Exodus 20* 14. Deuteronomy. 5. 18. Mat. 12. 18.
therein?


S. By this Commandment is forbidden all kind of filthy and wandering lust,
and all uncleanness that rises of such lust, as unchastness of speech, and all
wantonness of countenance and Gesture, Romans 13. 13. 1 Cor. 6. 6 9.
all outward show of unchastity whatsoever it be, and not only filthiness of
words and uncleaness of doings is forbidden by God, but also for as much as both
our bodies and souls are the Temples of 1 Cor. 3. 16. and 17. 6 and 15. 19. 2
Cor. 6. 16.
the holy Ghost, that honesty may be kept undefiled in them both, shamfastness
and chastity is commanded, that neither our bodies be defiled with uncleaness
of lust, nor our minds with unhonest thoughts or desires, but be all way
preserved chaste Ioh 13. 9: Pro. 6. 25. Mat. 5. 27. 28. Exodus 20. 15 Mat. 19.
18. 1 Cor. 6. 8, 9, 10.
and pure.


M. Go on to the rest.


S. The eight Commandment is: Thou shall not steal; By which Commandment are
comdemned, not only those thefts that are punished by men's Laws, but all frauds
and deceivings; but none does 1 These 4 6. Tit. 2. 10.
offend more hainously against this Law, then they that are wont by means of
trust to beguile them toward whom they pretend friendship, for they that break
faith, labor to overthrow the common succor of all men: we are therefore
commanded that we deceive no man, that we undermine no man, that we suffer not
our selves to be allured with vantage or gain of buying or selling to do any
wrong, that in trading of buying or selling we seek not wealth unjustly, nor
Prove. 11. 1. and 20. 10. 11.
make our profit by untrue and uneven measures and weights, nor increase our
riches with sale of slight deceitful ware.


M. Think thou that there is any thing more to be said of this Commandment?


S. Yea certainly, for not only outward thefts and frauds are forbidden, and we
are commanded to use bargaining without guile and deceits, and to do all things
else without subtle undermining, but also we are charged to be altogether so
minded, that though we be sure to escape unpunished and unespied, yet we should
our selves forbear from wrong; for that which is wrong before man to do, is
evil before God to have Will to do, therefore all councels and devices, and
Psa. 62. 10. Zach. 8. 17. Mich. 7. 12. Acts 20. 33.
specially the very desire to make our gain of others losses is forbidden by
this Law. Finally, we are by this Law commanded to endeavor all the ways we
may that every man may most speedily come to his own, and safely keep that
which he possesses.


M. What is the ninth Commandment? Exodus 20. 16. Deuteronomy. 5. 20. Mat. 19 18.



S. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.


M. What is meant in this Commandment?


S. That we break not our Oath or Exodus 23. 1. Levit. 19. 11, 12. Deuteronomy. 19. 18,
19. Mat. 19. 18. Psalm. 15. 3. Luk 3. 14.
Faith, and in this Law we are forbidden, not only open and manifest perjuries,
but also wholly all lying, slanders, backbitings, and evil speakings, whereby
our neighbor may take loss or harm, or loose his good name and estimation, for
one example contains a general Do^^rin; yea, and we ought neither our selves
at Pro. 12. 17., 18. 2 Cor. 13. 8. Ephesians. 4: 25.
any time to speak any false or untrue things, nor with our words, writing,
silence, presence, or secret assent in holding our peace, once allow the same
in other, but we ought to be lovers and followers of simple Truth, ever to rest
upon Truth, to bring forth all things diligently into the light of Truth, as
place, time, or necessity as shall require; finally, ever readily to take upon
us the defense of Truth, and by all means to maintain and uphold it.


M. For satisfying of this Law, is it not enough to bridle our Tongue and Pen?


S. By the same reason that I have before said, when He forbids evil
speaking, He therewith forbids sinister Man. 7. 1, 2. Romans 14. 3, 4. 1 Cor.
13. 5. 7.
suspicious and wrongful misdeemings; for this Lawmakers has ever chief
respect to the affection of the heart; this Law therefore forbids us to be
inclined so much as to think evil of our neighbors, much less to defame them;
yea, it Prove. 25. 17. (...). 2. 1, 2.
commands us to be of such gentle sincerity and indiffereney toward them, as
to endeavor so far as Truth may suffer, to think well of them, and to our
utmost power to preserve their estimation untouched.


M. What is the reason why the Lord in his Law, does term the corrupt
affections of the heart, by the names of the most heinous offenses, for He
comprehends wrath and hatred under the name of manslaughter, all wantonness
and unclean thoughts, under the name of Adultery, and unjust coveting under the
name of theft?


S. Least we (as the nature of man is) should wink at the ungodly affections
Romans 7. 7. 1 Cor. 10. 6.
of the heart, as things of small weight, therefore the Lord sets them out
by their true names, according as He measures them by the rule of his own
righteousness; for our Savior the best Interpreter of his Fathers meaning does
so expound the same: Who so (says He) is Mat. 5. 22. 28. and 15. 19. 1 Ioh 3.
15.
angry with his brother he is a manslayer: Who so lusts after a woman, he
has committed adultery.


M. But whereas only vices and sins are forbidden in these Commandments, why
do thou in expounding them, say that the contrary virtues are also commanded
therein; for thou say tha^ in forbidding of adultery, chastity is (...) in
forbidding manslaughter and these, most entire good will and liberality is
commanded, and so of the rest?


S. Because the same our Savior does so expound it, which sets the sum of
the Law, not in abstaining only from injury and evil doing, but in love and
Mat. 22. 39: Rom 13. 4. 8: Gal. 5. 14. Psalm: 37 27.
charity, like as the Kingly Prophet had also before taught, saying, Depart
from evil and do good.


M. Now remains the last Commandment?


S. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors Exodus 20. 17. Mich. 2. 2. Romans 7 7. 1
Cor. 10. 6.
house, thou shall not covet thy neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his
maid, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor any thing that is his.


M. Seeing that, as thou have often said already, the whole Law is spiritual, and
ordained not only to restrain outward evil doings, but also to bridle the
inward affections of the heart; What is herin commanded more that was before
omitted?


S. God has before forbidden all evil doings, and corrupt affections of the
mind; but now he requires of us a most precise pureness, that we suffer not
Isa. 1. 16. Romans 13* 14. Gal. 5. 24.
any desire be it never so light nor any thought, be it never so small in any
wise swerving from right, once to creep into our heart.


M. How then do thou say that unadvised and sudden desires, and short
thoughts that come upon the very godly are sins although they strive against
such rather then yield to them?


S. Surely it is plain, that all corrupt thoughts, although our consent be not
Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21. Psalm. 94. 15. Prove. 20. 9. Mat. 15. 18: 19.
added to them, do proceed out of corrupted Nature; and it is no doubt that
sudden desires that tempt the hearts of men, although they prevail not so
far as to win a steadfast assent of mind and allowance, are in this
Commandment condemned by God as sins, for it is meet that even our very hearts
and mind, should Isa. 1. 16. and 29 13, 15. Jer. 4. 14. Ezekiel. 18. 31. Mat. 5 8:
Psalm. 5. 4, 5. 2 Cor. 6. 14.
shine before God in their perfect pureness and cleanness, for no Innocence and
righteousness, but the most perfect can please him, whereof he has also set
before this his Law and most perfect rule.


M. Hitherto thou have shortly and plainly opened the Law of the ten
Commandments, but cannot all these things that thou have severally and
particularly declared; be in few words gathered as it were into one sum?


S. Why not, seeing that Christ our heavenly Schoolmaster has comprised the
whole pith and substance of the Law in a sum and short abridgment in this
manner saying: Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy soul, with all thy
mind, with all thy Mat. 22. 37. Mar. 12. 30.
strength, and this is the greatest Commandment in the Law, and the second is
like unto this, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, for in these two
Commandments are contained the whole Law and the Prophets.


M. What manner of love of God do thou take here to be required?


S. Such as is meet for God, that is, Deuteronomy. 10. 17. 1 Timothy 6 13: Isa. 73. 16.
Mat. 6. 8. 1 Timothy 1: 1. Deuteronomy. 10 12. Psalm, 96 7. 1 Cor. 10 31. Deuteronomy. 6 17. Romans
12. 2. Psalm. 2. 12. and 25. 1. and 31. 1. and 118. 8.
that we acknowledge Him both for our most mighty Lord, and our most loving
Father, and most merciful Savior wherefore to this love, is to be adjoined
both reverence to his Majesty, and obedience to his Will, and affiance in his
Goodnese.


M. What is meant by all the Heart, all the Soul, and all the Strength.


S. Such fervency, and such unfainedness of love, that there be no room for
any thoughts, for any desires, for any meanings or doings that disagree with
Deuteronomy. 30 6. Ios. 23. 11. Mar. 10. 37.
the love of God. Dear (as one says) are our Parents, dear are our children,
our kinsfolks, our friends, and dearer yet is our Country, but all the dear
loves of them all, entire zeal toward God, and Ioh. 14. 15. 21. 23, 24. and ^5.
10.
the most perfect love of Him, not only contains, but also much and far
surmounteth, for whom; what good man will stick to die, for every godly man
loves God not only more dearer then all his, but also more dearerly then
himself.


M. Now what say thou of the love of our neighbor?


S. Christ's Will was that there should be most straight bonds of love among his
children; and as we be by nature most 1 Cor. 13. 5. Ephesians. 5. 29. Phil. 2. 29.
inclined to the love of our selves, so can there not be devised a plainer nor
shorter, nor pithier, nor more indifferent rule of brotherly love then that
which the Lord has gathered out of our own nature, and set before us; that is,
that every man should bear to his neighbor the same good will that he bears
to himself; whereof it follows, that we should not Mat. 7. 12. and 22. 36.
Romans 13. 9, 10.
do any thing to our neighbor, nor say nor think any thing of him, which we
would not have other to do to our selves, or to say or think of our selves,
within the compass of which only Law, which is indeed as it were the Soul of
all other Laws, if we could behold, surely there were were no need of so many
bars of Laws, as men do daily devise to hold men in from doing wrong one to
another, and to maintain Civil Societies and all well nere in vain, if among
men this one Law be not regarded.


M. How far extends the name of neighbor?

The name of neighbor contains, not only those that be of our kin and
alliance, or friends, or such as be knit to us in any civil bond of love, but
also those whom we know not, yea, and our enemies. Mat. ^. 43. Ioh. 13. 34. 1
These. 4. 9.



M. Why, what have they to do with us?


S. Surely they are knit to us with the the same bond wherewith God has coupled
together all mankind, which bond his Will is to have inviolable and steadfast,
and therefore it cannot be taken away by Mat. 5. 44. 1 Ioh. 2. 9 and 3. 10. and
4. 7.
any man's frowardness, hatred, or malice; for though any man hate us, yet
notwithstanding he remains still our neighbor, and so must always be
accounted, because the same Order by which this fellowship and conjoyning among
men is knit together, ought always to remain steadfast and inviolable, and hereby
may it be easily perceived why the holy Scripture has appointed Charity or
Love to be one of the principal parts of Religion. Gal. 5. 6. 1 Ioh. 3. 23.



M. But what means that addition in the end, That herin are contained the
whole Law and the Prophets?


S. Because in very deed the sum of them all belongs thereunto, for all the
Warnings, Commands, Exhortations, Promises and Threatenings which the Law it
self, the Prophets and Apostles do every where use, are directed to nothing
else but to the end of this Law, as it were to a mark, and all things in the
holy Mat. 7. 12. Romans 13 8, 10. Gal. 4. 13. 1 Timothy 1. 5.
Scriptures are so applied to Charity, that they seem, as it were to lead us by
the hand unto it.


M. Now I wou^d have thee tell me what Law that is that thou speak off,
whether it is the same that we call the law of Nature, or some other besides
it?


S. I remember Master, that I have long ago, learned this of you, that is, tha
the Law, as the highest reason, was by God grafted in the nature of man, while
man's nature was yet sound and Genesis 1. 26, 27, 31. Ephe. 4. ^4. Col. 3. 10.
uncorrupted, being created after the Image of God, and so this Law is indeed
and is called the law of Nature; but since that nature of man became stained
with sin, although the minds of wise men have Luk 1. 79: Acts 14. 17. and 17.
27. Rom: 1. 19.
been in some sort lightened with the brightness of this natural light, yet in
the most part of men this light is so put out, that scarce any sparckles thereof
are to be seen; and in many men's minds is deeply grafted a sharp hatred of God
and men against the Ordinances of God and his Mat. 24 9, 10, 12 Ioh. 17. 14. 2 Timothy 3. 2.
Commandments written in this Law, which command most hearty love to God and
men; and hereof comes so great ungodliness toward God, and so deadly cruelty
toward men.


M. How comes it to pass that God would have these Commandments written in
Tables?


S. I will tell you, the Image of God in man is since the fall of Adam by
Original 1 Cor. 2. 14. Ephesians. 4. 17. 18.
sin, and by evil Custom so darkened, and natural Judgment so corrupted, that
man does not sufficiently understand what difference is between honest and
dishonest, right and wrong. Merciful God therefore minding to renew the same
Image in us, has by his Law written in Tables, set forth the rule of perfect
righteousness. Psalm. 19. 8. and 119. 1.
and that so lively and fully, that God requires no more of us but to follow
the same rule, for he accepts no other sacrifice but Obedience, and Hos. 6.
6. Mar. 12. 33.
therefore he hates all whatsoever it be that we admit in Religion, or in the
case of worshipping God without the warrant of his prescribed Ordinance.


M. But wherein this Law there are no Commandments set out of every man's
private Vocation, how can this be a perfect rule of life?


S. Though here be no Commandment expressly set out concerning the duties of
every man, yet for as much as the Law commands to give to every man his Exodus
20. 12, 15. and toto capite.
own, it does in a sum comprise all the parts and duties of every man
privately in his degree and trade of life, and in these Tables, the Lord has
briefly and summarily comprehended all those things which in the Scriptures are
each where most largely set out concerning the several Commandments and Duties
of every several man.


M. Seeing then the Law does show a perfect manner of worshipping God a right,
ought we not then to live wholly according to the rule thereof.


S. Yea, and so much that God promises Deuteronomy. 8. 1. and 30. 15. Mtt. 19. 17.
Ioh. 12. 50. Deuteronomy. 11. 28. and 13. 17. Romans 1. 18. and 6. 23.
life to them that live according to the rule of the Law, and on the other side
threatens death to them that break his Law, as is aforesaid; and for this
cause, in my Division I have named Obedience as one of the principal parts of
Religion.


M. Do thou then think them to be justified that do in all things obey the
Law of God?


S. Yea surely, if any were able to perform it, they should be justified by
the Law, but we are all of such weakness Genesis 6. 5. and 8 11. Prove. 20. 9. Romans
7. 14. 15. Gal. 2. 16.
that no man in all points fulfilleth his Duty. For though we put case that
there be one found that performs the Law in some point, yet he shall not
thereby be justified before God, for he pronounces them all to be accursed and
Gal. 3. 10.
abominable that do not fulfill all things that are contained in the Law.


M* D^st thou ^hen det^rmine, that no mortal man is justified before God by the
Law?


S. No man, for the Scriptures do also Job 25. 4. Romans 3. 28. and 4 15. Gal. 2
16. 21. and 3. 10.
pronounce the same.


M. Why then did God make such a L^w as requires a perfection above our
^bility.


S. In making the Law, God respected not so much what we were able to perform,
which by our own f^ult are very Romans 3: 20. Gal. 3. 8.
weak, as what was meet for his own righteousness; and for as much as none but
Psalm. 5* 4, 5 6. 2 Cor. 6. 14.
the highest righteousness could please God, it behoved that the rule of life
which he set out should be thoroughly perfect; moreover the Law requires
nothing of us, but that we are bound to perform. But since we are far from due
Job 4. 17. and 25. 14. Gal. 2. 16.
obeying the Law, men can have no sufficient or lawful excuse to defend
themselves before God, and so the Law accuses all men for guilty, yea, and
condemns them before the Judgment Seat of Romans 3. 19. and 7 8, 10. Gal 3. 10.
God, and that is the cause why Paul calls the Law the Ministry of Death and
Damnation.


M. Does then the Law set all men in this m^st remediless estate?


S. The unbelieving and the ungodly Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Rom: 3. 10.
the Law does both set and leave in such case, as I have spoken, who, as they
are not able to fulfill the least jot of the Law, so have they no affiance at
all in God through Christ: but among the godly the Law has other us^s.


M. What uses?


S. First, the Law in requiring so precise Deuteronomy: 6. 6, 7. Ios: 1. 7, 8. Psalm:
1. 2.
perfectness of life, does show to the godly as it were a Mark for them to
level at, and a Goal to run unto, that daily profiting they may with earnest
endeavor travel toward thc highest uprightness. ^his purpose and desire the
godly, by the guiding of God do conceive; but principally they take heed, so
much as they are able to do and attain to, that it may not be said that there
is any notorious fault in them. Secondly, whereas the Law requires things far
above man's Psalm. 119. 5. Rom: 7. 14. 2 Cor. 3. 5.
power, and where they find themselves too weak for so great a burden, the Law
does raise them up to crave strength at the Lords hand. Moreover, when the Law
does continually accuse them, it Deuteronomy: 27. 26. Romans 3 1^, 11. 12. 2 Cor. 3 9.
stricketh their heart with a wholesome sorrow, and drives them to the
repentance that I speak of, and to beg and obtain pardon of God through
Christ, and therwithall restrains them that they trust not to their own
innocence, nor presume to be proud in the sight of God, and is always to them as
a bridle to withhold them in the fear of God. Finally, when beholding by the
Law, as it were in a Glass, the spots and uncleanness of their Romans 3. 9. and
7. 7.
souls, they learn the^by that they are not able to attain perfect
righteousness by their works; by this means they are trained Prove. 10. 9. Romans
1. 20, 21. Gal. 2. 16.
to humility, and so the Law prepares them, and sends them to seek
righteousness in Christ.


M. Then as far as I perceive thou say that the Law is, as it were, a
certain Scboolmaster Romans 10. 4. Gal. 3. 10. etc. and 24.
to Christ, to lead us the right way to Christ by knowing our selves and by
Repentance and Faith.


S. Yea surely.


The Second PART. Of the Gospel, and Faith.
M. Since now my dear Child, thou have so much as it may be in a short
Abridgement largely answered this matter of the Law and Obedience; good Order
requires that we speak next of the Gospel, which contains the Promises of
God, and promises the mercy of God through Christ to them that have broken
Gods Law, and to the which Gospel, Faith has specially respect; for this was
the second Point in our Division, and this also the very orderly course of
those matters that we have treated of, has, as it were, brought us by the hand
unto. What is now the Sum of the Gospel and of his Faith?


S. Even the same wherein the chief Articles of the Christian Faith have been in
old time briefly knit up and contained, and which is commonly called the Creed
or Symbol of the Apostles.


M. Why is the sum of our Faith called a Symbol?


S. A Symbol by interpretation is a Badge, Mark, Watch* Word or Token, whereby
the Soldiers of one side are known from the Enemies, for which cause the short
sum of our faith, by which Christians are severally known from them that be
not Christians, is rightly called a Symbol.


M. But why is it called the Symbol of the Apostles?


S. Because it was first received from the Apostles own mouth, or most
faithfully gathered out of their Writings and allowed from the very beginning
of the Church, and so continually remained among all the godly, firm and
steadfast, and unremoveable as a sure and stayed rule of Christian faith.


M. Go to, I would have thee now rehearse to me the Symbol it self?


S. I will. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was Crucified,
Dead, and Buried, He descended into Hell, the third day He rose again from the
Dead, He ascended into Heaven, there he sits at the right hand of God the
Father Almighty,, from thence shall He come to Judge the quick and the dead, I
believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the Body, and the life
everlasting, Amen.


M. These things my child, thou have briefly, and in short sum set forth;
wherefore it is good that thou declare more plainly, and at large what thou
think of every particular; and first, into how many parts do thou divide
this whole Confession of Faith?


S. Into four principal parts; in the first, whereof is treated of God the
Father and the Creation of all things: In the second, of his Son Jesus Christ,
which part also contains the whole sum of the redemption of man: in the
third, of the Holy Ghost: in the fourth, of the Church, and of the benefits of
God toward the Church.


M. Go forward then to declare me those four parts in order, and first, in the
very beginning of the Creed; what meanest thou by this word Believe?


S. I mean thereby that I have a true and a lively faith, that is to say, a
Christian man's faith in God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that I
do by this form of confession, testify and approve the same faith.


M. Is there any faith that is not a true and lively faith?


S. There is indeed a certain general faith, as I may so call it, and there is
a Romans 1. 32. Tit: 1. 16.
dead faith.


M. Since then it is a matter of no small weight that thou comprehendest under
the name of believing, and of a Christian faith that is to say, a true and
lively faith; tell me now what faith that same is, and how it differs from
the general faith, and also from the dead faith?


S. The general faith is that which crediteth Mat: 7. 22. 1 Cor: 13 2.
the Word of God, that is, which believes all those things to be true that are
contained in the Scriptures concerning God, his Incomprehensibleness, Power,
Righteousness, Wisdom, and mercy toward the faithful and godly, and most
earnest severity toward the unbelieving and ungodly, and likewise all other
things taught in the Scriptures.


M. Does not the true faith that thou speak of, believe also the same
things.


S. Yea surely, but the true Faith goes further, as I shall show by and by;
for thus far, not only ungodly men, but Romans 1. 32. Tit. 1. 16.
also the very devils do believe, and therefore neither are they indeed
faithful, nor Ioh. 1. 12. Gal. 3. 25, 26.
so called. But the true Faith, as it nothing doubts that all things taught
in the Word of God are most certainly true, so does it also embrace the
Promises Romans 4. 16.
made concerning the mercy of God the Father, and the forgiveness of sins to
the faithful through Jesus Christ, which promises are properly called the
Gospel; Isa. 61. 2. Deuteronomy. 10. 20. Psalm. 111. 10.
which faith whosoever have, they do not only fear God as the most mighty Lord
of all, and the most righteous Judge (which we already said, that the most part
of the ungodly, and the devils themselves do) but also they love him as their
most Ja. 2. 19.
bountiful and merciful Father, whom as Deuteronomy. 10. 12. Psalm. 2, 3. Col. 2. 6.
Ephesians. 5. 1, 2, 8.
they they travel in all things to please (as becomes obedient children) with
godly endeavors and works which are called the fruits of Faith, so have they a
good and sure hope of obtaining pardon through Christ, when as men, they swerve
from his Will, for they know that Christ (whom they trust upon) appeasing the
Mat. 1. 21. Romans 3. 24. and 5. 1.
wrath of his Father, their sins shall never Ephesians. 2. 15, 16. Col. 2. 14. Heb.
10. 17. 1 Ioh. 2. 1, 2.
be imputed any more to them, then if the same had never been committed. And
though themselves have not satisfied the Law, and their duty toward God and
men, yet believe they that Christ with his most full observing of the Law 1
Cor. 1. 30. 2 Cor. 5. 18. Ephe. 1. 6, 7. Phil. 1. 9.
has abundantly satisfied God for them, and are persuaded that by this his
righteousness, and observing of the Law of God, themselves are accounted in the
number and state of the righteous, and that they are beloved of God, even as if
they themselves had fulfilled the Law. And this is the Justification which the
Romans 3. 21. Gal. 2. 16.
holy Scriptures do declare that we obtain by faith.


M. Cannot these things also be in the devils or wicked men?


S. Nothing less, for though they fear, Genesis 4. 13. Prove. 10. 24. Mat. 27 4, 5.
1 Ioh. 4. 18.
or rather with horror do dread God as most mighty and righteous, for they know
he will take vengeance of their ungodliness, yet can they neither have any
trust in his goodness and mercy toward them, nor any recourse to his Grace,
nor enter into any endeavor to obey his Will: therefore their faith, although
they doubt not of the truth of the Word of Mat. 7. 23. 1 Cor. 13. 2, 3. 13.
Tit. 1. 16.
God is called a dead faith, for that like a a dry and dead stock, it never
brings forth any fruits of godly life, that is, of love to God, and charity
toward men*


M. G^ve me then out of what thou have hitherto said, a definition of that same
lively and true Christian faith? Faith defined. Romans 8* 1, 14. 38, 39. Col. 2
2, 3. 1 These. 1. 5. H^b. 10. 22, 23. and 11. 1. Psalm: 1: 3. Mat. 13. 23. Gal: 5
6. 1 Pet. 1. 14, 15.



S. Faith is an assured knowledge of the Fatherly good will of God toward us
through Christ, and an affiance in the same goodness, as it is witnessed in the
Gospel, which faith has coupled with it an endeavor of godly li^e, that is,
to obey the Will of God the Father.


M. Thou have sufficientl^ declared what thou m^anest by the terms of Faith
and believing Now go forward and tell m^ in as ^pt words as thou can what
thou understandest by the Name of God, which follows next in the Creed?


S. I will do the best I can, good Master, as my wit and ability will serve me.
I understand that there i^ one Nature, or Gal 4. 8. 2 Pet. 1. 4. Heb. 1. 3.
Ioh: 4 24. Rom: 1. 20. and 16 26. Mat: 6 13. and 19. 26. Ioh. 1. 18. Co^: 1.
15. Psalm. 104. 31. Isa: 2 10, ^9. 1 Timothy 1. 17. and 6. 16. 1 Cor 10. 31. Psalm.
39. 7.
Substance, or Soul, or Mind, or rather divine Spirit (for divesly have wise
men, both Heathen and Christian termed God, where indeed by no words can be
properly termed) eternal without beginning and end, unmeasurable, uncorporeal,
invisible, with the eyes of men, of mast excellent Majesty, which we call God,
whom all people of the world most reverence and worship with highest honor, and
in him as in the best and greatest to settle their hope and affiance.


M S^^ing there is but one God, tell why in the Confession of the Christian
Faith thou r^herasest ^hr^e, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gh^st.


^. Those be not the names of sundry Mat. 28. 1^. 1 Ioh. 5. 7. Ioh. 10. 30.
Gal. 3. 20. Genesis 1. 1. 1 Cor. 8. 6. Joh. 1. 1. and 17. 5. Col. 1. 15 Heb. 1. 2,
3, 5. Joh. 14 26. Act. 5. 3 4. 1 Cor. 12. 4.
gods, but of three distinct persons in one Godhead; for in one substance of
God, we must consider the Father, which of himself begat the Son, the Son even
from eternity begotten of the Father, which is the eternal Wisdom of God the
Father; the Holy Ghost proceeding from them both, as the power of God spread
abroad through all things, but yet so as it also continually abides in it
self; and yet Joh. 10. 30. 1 Cor. 8. 6. Gal: 3. 20.
that God is not therefore divided; for of these three Persons none goes
before the other in time, in Greatness, nor in Dignity, but the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, three distinct persons in eternity 1 John 5. 7.
of like continuance in Power, even in Dignity equal, and in Godhead one. There
is the^fore one Eternal, Immortal, Deuteronomy: 4. 35, 39. ^^al. 89. 9, ^0. and 104
30, 31. 1 Timothy: 1. 17.
Almighty, Glorious, the Best, the Greatest, God the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, for so has the universal number of Christians, which is called the
Catholic Church taught us by the holy Scriptures, concerning God the Father,
the Son, and the holy Ghost, where otherwise the infinite depth of this mystery
is so great that it cannot with the mind be conceived, much less with words be
expressed, wherein therefore is required a simplicity of Christian Faith ready to
believe, rather then sharpness of wit to Prove. 25. 16.
search, or the office of the tongue to express so secret and hidden a Mystery.


M. Thou say true, go forward therefore, why do thou call God Father. The
first part of the Creed. God the Father. Mat. 3. 17. Ioh. 1. 14. Romans 15. 6. 2
Cor. 1. 3. and 11. 31. Genesis 1. 27. Mal. 1. 6. and 2. 10. Ioh. 3. 3. 5. 1 Pet.
1. 3, 23. 1 Ioh. 1. 12. Romans 8. 15, 17, 23. and 9. 4. Gal. 4. 5, 6. Ephe. 1. 5,
6. Tit. 3 7.



S. Beside the same principal cause which I have already rehearsed, which is,
for that he is the Natural Father of his only Son, begotten of himself from
before all beginning: there be two other causes why He is both indeed, and is
called Our Father, the one is, for that he first created us, and gave life unto
us all: the the other is of greater value, namely, for that He has heavenly
begotten us again through the Holy Ghost, and by Faith, in his true and natural
Son Jesus Christ, He has adopted us his children, and through the same Christ
has given us his Kingdom, and inheritance of everlasting life.


M. In what sense do thou give Him the name of Almighty?


S. For that as He has created the Isa. 40. 21. Mat. 5. 45. and 10. 19. Ephe.
1. 11.
world and all things, so He has the same in his Power, governs them with
his Providence, orders them after his own Will, and commands all, as it
pleases Him, soas there is nothing done but by His appointment or sufferance,
and nothing is there which He is not able to do; for I do not imagine God to
have a certain idle power which He puts not in use.


M. Do thou make ungodly men also, and wicked spirits subject to the Power of
God?


S. Why not, for else were we in most Job 1. 10. Ioh. 10. 28, 29. Acts 2. 13.
and 4. 17, 18, and 12. 11.
miserable case, for that we should never be out of fear, if they might have
any power over us without the Will of God; but God, as it were with the bridle
of His Power so restrains them that they cannot once stir but at His Beck
and Sufferance, and we for our parts are upholden with this comfort, that we
are so in the power of our Almighty Father, that not so much as an hair of ours
can perish, but by his Will that bears us good will.


M. Go forward.


S. Forasmuch as the mind of man is not able of it self to conceive the
goodness and incomprehensibleness of the most good and most great God, we add
further that he is the Creator of heaven and earth, and all things contained in
them; by which words we signify that God is, as it were in a Glass, to be
beholden, and so (far as behooves us) to be known in his Works, and in the
orderly course of the Psa. 19. 1. and 50. 7. Romans 1. 19. 20.
world for when we see that unmeasurable greatness of the world, and all the
parts thereof to be so framed, as they could not possibly in beauty be fairer,
nor for profit be better, we forth with thereby understand the infinite Power,
wisdom, and goodness of the Workman and Builder thereof, for who is so brutish
that in looking up to heaven does not perceive that there is a God; yea, for
this cause specially it seems that God has fashioned men out of the earth,
tall and upright, that they should be beholders of things above and heavenly
matters, and in beholding heaven, might conceive the knowledge of Him.


M. How do thou say that God created all things?


S. That God the most good and mighty Genesis 1. 1. Psalm. 33 6. Acts 14. 15. Joh.
1. 3. 1 Cor. 8. 6. Heb. 1. 2. Col. 1. 16.
Father, at the beginning, and of nothing, by the Power of his Word, that is of
Jesus Christ his Son, framed and made this whole visible world, and all things
whatsoever they be that are contained therein, and also the uncorporeall
spirits, whom we call Angels.


M. But do thou think it godly to affirm that God created all spirits, even
those wicked spirits whom we call Devils?


S. God did not create them such, but Gen: 1. 31. Ioh. ^. 44. Col: 1. 16. Jude
6.
they by their own evilness fell from their first Creation, without hope of
recovery and so are they become evil, not by Creation and Nature, but by
corruption of Nature.


M. Did God think it enough to have once created all things, and to cast away
all further care of things from thence forth?


S. I have already briefly touched this Point, whereas it is much more excellent
to maintain and preserve things created, then to have once created them, we
must certainly believe, that when he had so Psalm: 75. ^. and 104. 10. and 105.
25. Heb. 1. 3*
framed the world and all creatures, He from thence forth has preserved, and
yet preserves them; for all things would run to ruin and fall to nothing,
unless by his Virtue, and as it were by his Hand they were upholden; we also
assuredly Ma: 10. 29. 30.
believe that the whole order of Nature and changes of things which are falsely
reputed the alterations of Fortune Exodus: 14. 21. Psalm. 89. 10. and 147. 8, 9.
do hang all upon God, that God guides the course of the heaven, upholdeth the
earth, tempereth the seas, and rules the whole world, and that all things obey
his Divine Power, and by his Divine Power all things are governed, that He is
the Levit: ^6. ^ etc.
Author of fair weather and of temp^st, of rain and of drought, of
fruitfulness, and Psalm 144 12. and 145 16, 17. Jsa. 51. 3. Mat 5 45. Romans 14 6.
1 Cor 10. 31. Ep^^* 5 4 1 ^im. 4. 3, 4. 1 Pet. 5. 7.
of barrenness, of health and of sickness, and of all things that belong to the
sustentation and preserving of our life, and which are desired, either for
necessary use or honest pleasure: Finally, all things that Nature needs, he
has ever given and yet most largely gives abundance and plenty with most
liberal hand: to this end, verily, that we should so use them as becomes
mindful and kind children.


M. To what end do thou think that Almigh^y The final cause.
God has created all these things?


S. The world it self was created for Genesis 1. 26. 29, 30. Psalm. 8. 7. etc.
man, and all things that ar^ therein were provided for the use and profit of
men: and as God made all other things for man, so made He man himself for his
own Prove. ^6 4. J^a. 43 7. Romans 11. 36. Col. 1. 16.
Glory.


M. What have thou then to say of the first beginning and creation of man?


S. That which Moses wrote, that is, Genesis 2. 7 21, 22.
that God fashioned the first man of clay, and breathed into him soul and life;
and a^terward out of the side of man being cast in a sleep, He took out woman,
and bro^ght her into the world to join her to man for a companion of his life;
and therefore was man called Adam, because Gen 2 7. 3 19. Gen 3. 20.
he took his beginning of the earth, and woman was called Eva, because she was
ordained to be the mother of all living persons.


M. Where at this day there is to be seen in both sorts both men and women, so
great corruption, wickedness, and perverseness did God create them such at the
beginning?


S. Nothing less, for God being most Genesis 1. 31.
perfectly good can make nothing but good; God therefore at the first made man
according to his own Image and likeness. Gen 1. 26. Col. 3. 10.



M. What is that Image, according to the which thou say that man was
fashioned?


S. It it most absolute righteousness, and most perfect holiness, which most
Romans 8. 29. 1 Co^. 15 49. 2 Cor. 3 18. and 4. 4 Col 15. and 3. 10.
properly belongs to the very Nature of God which has been most evidently
showed in Christ our new Adam, and whereof, in us there now scant appear
sparckles.


M. Yea do there scant appear any?


S. Yea truly, for they do not now so shine, as at the beginning before the
fall of man, because man with darkness of sins, Romans 1. 22. 1 Cor. 1. 18, 23.
and 2. 14. and 3. 19. Epbe 4. 17.
and mists of errors, has extinguished the brightness of that Image.


M. But tell me how this came to pass?


S. I will tell you: When the Lord God had made this world, He prepared Genesis 2.
8.
a most finely trimmed Garden, and most full of delight and pleasantness, every
where abounding with all delightful things that might be wished; herein, the
Lord God, for a certain singular good will placed man, and allowed him the use
of all things, only he forbad him the Gen: 2. 17.
fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, threatening him with death if
once he tasted of it: for reason it was that man having received so many
benefits Gen: 3. 11. Psalm: 8. 4, 5, 6. etc.
should in so far obeying, show himself willingly obedient to the command of
God, and that being contented with his own estate, should not, being himself a
creature, advance himself higher against the will of his Creator.


M. What followed then?


S. The woman deceived by the devil Gen: 3. 1, 6. 7.
persuaded the man to taste the forbidden fruit, which thing made them both
forthwith subject to death, and that heavenly Image according to which he was
first created, being defaced, in place of Wisdom, Strength, Holiness, Truth,
and Righteousness, the Jewels wherewith God had adorned him, there succeeded
the most horrible plagues, blindness, weakness Act^ 14* 12, 13. and 17 22. Rom:
1. 22. and 8. 7, 8. 1 Cor. 2. 14. Ephesians. 4. 17. 18, 22.
vain lying, and unrighteousness, in which evils and miseries he also wrapped,
and overwhelmed himself, his Issue and all his Posterity.


M: May it not seem that God did too rigorously punish the eating of one Apple?


S. Let no man extenuate the most heinous offense of man as a small trespass,
Gen: 3. 8.
and weigh the deed by the Apple, and the only excess of gluttony, for he with
his wife catched and snared with the guile full allurements of Satan by
infidelity revolted Gen: 3. 4, 5.
from the truth of God to a lie: he gave credit to the false suggestions of the
Serpent, wherein he accused God of untruth, of envy, and of malicious
withdrawing of some goodness, having received so many benefits, he became most
unthankful Psalm: 8: 4. 5, 6.
toward the giver of them: he the issue of the earth, not contented that he was
made according to the Image of God with intolerable ambition and pride Genesis 3.
22.
sought to make himself equal with the Majesty of God. Finally, he withdrew
Gen: 3 11. Hos: 6. 7. Romans 5. 19.
himself from Allegiance to his Creator, yea, and malepartly shook off his
yoke: vain therefore it is to extenuate the sin of Adam.


M. But how can it seem but unrighteous, that for the Parents fault, all the
posterity should be deprived of Sovereign felicity, and burdened with extreme
evils and miseries?


S. Adam was the first Parent of mankind, therefore God endued him with those
ornaments to have them, or lose them for him and his, that is, for all
mankind, so soon as he therefore was spoiled of them, his whole nature was left
naked in p^nury, and destitute of all good things, so soon as he was defiled
with that spot of sin, out of the root or stock (...)
co^^upted, there sprung up corrupted ^^anches tha^ conveyed all their
corruption into the other twiggs springing out of them* thence it came that so
short, (...) 3 6. (...) 2. 8* (...) 3. etc. J^b 14 1 etc.
small, and uncertain race of life is limited unto us* thence came the
infirmity of our flesh, the feebleness of our bodies, the weakness and
frailness of mankind; thence came the horrible blindness of our Ro^. 1, 22. 1
^or. 3. ^8 19 Ep^ 4. 17, ^8, 19.
minds, and perverseness of our hearts; thence came crookedness and corruptness
of our affections and desires; thence came that Seed-plot, and as it were a
Romans 5 12.
sin^k of all sins, with the fruits whereof mankind is infected and tormented:
Of which evil, learned Christians that h^ve sought the proper and true name,
have called it Original sin.


M. Does mankind suffer the punishments of this sin in this life only?


S. No, but man's nature has so been corrupted and destroyed with this native
^ischief* that if the goodness and mercy of Almighty God had not, with applying
Ge^. 3. 14 ^5. (...) C^l. ^. 13.
a remedy, helped and relieved us in affliction, like as we fell in our wealth
into all calamities, and in our bodies, into all miseries, of deseases and of
death, so Genesis 3. 17, 18, 19. Mat. 8. 12. and 20, 13.
should we of necessity fall headlong into darkness and everlasting night, and
into fire unquenchable, there with all kind of punishment to be perpetually
tormented: and no marvel it is that other creatures Gen 3. 17.
also incurred that pain which man deserved, for whose use they were created,
and the whole order of Nature being troubled both in heaven and in earth, Genesis
3. 17, 18, 19*
harmful tempests, barrenness, diseases, and infinite other evils brake into the
Hos. 6. 7. 2 Cor. 11. 3.
world, into which miseries and woes, beside the said native mischief, we by
our own many and great sins are most deservedly fallen.


M. O deadly horrible plague and calam^ty by sin; but what remedy is that which
thou say that God has provided for us, wherein our forefathers, and from
thenceforth all their posterity have set and settled their hope?


S. Certainly, they were comfortably The second part of the Cre^d. God the Son.
^en. 3 14, 15,
raised to their hope of salvation, which they have conceived of Faith in Jesus
Christ, the Deliverer and Savior promised t^em of God, for that is it which
now follows next in the Creed: I believe in Jesus Christ, etc.


M. Did God give also to our first Parents by and by hope of their deliverance
by Jesus Christ?


S. Yea, For as he thrust Adam and Eve Genesis 3. 11, 12, ^3 17. 23. 24.
out of the Garden, after He had first sharply chastised them with words, so He
cursed the Serpent, and threatened him that the time should one day come, When
Gen: 3. 14.
the seed of the Woman should bruise his head.


M. What seed is that whereof God speaks?


S. That same seed is (as St Paul plainly Gal: 3. 16. 19.
teaches us) Jesus Christ the Son of God very God, and the Son of the Virgin,
very man, in whom we profess in the Second Part of the Creed, that we settle
our hope and confidence, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of
Mat. 1. 20, 21.
the nature of the holy, chaste, and undefiled Virgin Mary, and of the same
Mother he was so born, and nourished as other Infants be, saving that he was
altogether pure and free from all contagion of sin. (...) 1. 29. (...). 15, ^.



M. Did God think it sufficient once in the Old Testament to have made promise
of this (...)*


^* No, But this most joyful promise ^ ^ankind, which was first made to our
(...) Parents, the Lord God did often confirm (...). 3. ^4, 15.
to their posterity, to the end that men should have the greater expectation of
the performance of it; for after he had entered into Covenant by Circumcision
Genesis 17. 10. and 22. 18. and 26. 4. and ^8. 14.
with Abraham and his seed, He confirmed his Promise first to Abraham himself,
and then to Isaac his son, after to Jacob his sons son, and last of all with
most evident Oracles uttered by Moses and his other Deuteronomy. 20. 15. and 34. 4.
Psalm. 89. 4, 35. Isa. 53. and 54. 3. and 56. 9.
Prophets, he continued and maintained the assuredness of his Promise.


M. What mean these words, To bruise the Serpents head?


S. In the head of the Serpent his poison Psalm. 74 13, and 104. 3. Eccle. 10.
10. Amos 9. 3.
is contained, and the substance of his life and strength consists; therefore
the Serpents head signifies the whole strength, power, and kingdom, or rather
the tyranny of the devil, the old Serpent: all which Jesus Christ, that same
Mat. 1. 21. Acts 10 38: Col. 1: 13. 2 Timothy 2. 26. H^b. 2. 14, 15. 1 Ioh. 3. 6.
seed of the Woman, in whom God has performed the full sum of his Promise,
has subdued by the virtue of his death, and so in breaking the Serpents head,
he has rescued and made free from tyranny all them that trust in him; for this
is it which we profess in the Creed, that we believe in Jesus Christ the Son of
God, that is, that Jesus Christ is the Deliverer and Savior of us which were
holden bound and fast tied with impiety and wickedness, and wrapped in the
snares of eternal death, and holden thrall in foul bond age of the Serpent the
devil.


M. It seems that thou have expounded the name of Jesus with a very plain
declaration.


S. It is true, for Jesus in the Hebrew signifies none other, in Greek, So^er,
in Latin, Salvator, in English, a Savior, for they have no fitter name to
express the force and signification thereof: and by this that we have said, it
cannot now be unknown why he had this name, for He alone has delivered and
saved them that be His from eternal damnation, whereunto otherwise they were
appointed; some other indeed have taken upon them this name, because it was
thought they had saved some men's bodies, but Jesus Christ alone Mat. 1. 21.
Act. 4. 10. 12 Romans 5. 9, 10. Phil. 2. 9.
is able to save both souls and bodies of them that trust in him.


M. Who gave him this Name?


S. The Angel by the Commandment Mat. 1. 21.
of God himself; and also it was of necessity, that he should indeed answer and
perform that name that God has given him.


M. N^w tell me what means the name of Christ?


S. It is as much as to say as Anointed, Psalm. 2. 6. and 10* 5 and 9 5. Dan. 3.
24, 24. A^t 7* 37.
whereby is meant that he is the Sovereign King, Priest, and Prophet.


M. How shall that appear? Levit. 4. 3.



S. By the holy Scriptures which both do apply Anointing to these three
Offices, and does also often attribute the same Offices to Christ.


M. Was then Christ anointed with Oil, such as they used at Creation of Kings,
Priests, and Prophets in old time?


S. No, but with much more excellent Oil, namely, with the most plentiful Act
4. 27. and 10. 38. Heb. 1. 9. Ioh. 1. 14, 16.
grace of the holy Spirit wherewith he was filled, and most abundantly endued
with his divine riches, of which heavenly anointing, that outward anointing
was but ashadow.


M. Obtained He these things for himself alone, or does he also give any
commodities thereby?


S. Yea, Christ received these things of his Father, to the intent that he
should communicate the same unto us in such manner as he knew to be most meet
for every of us; for out of his fullness, as out of the Ioh. 1. 14, 16. 2 Cor.
1. 21. Col. 1. 13. 2 Timothy: 4. 8.
only holy and increasing noble Fountain, we all do draw all the heavenly good
things that we have.


M. Do thou not then say Christ's Kingdom is a worldly Kingdom?


S. No, but a spiritual and eternal Kingdom, Ioh: 18. 36. Col. 1. 13, 14. 2 Timothy: 4. 1.
that is governed and ordered by the Word and Spirit of God, which bring with
them, righteousness and life.


M. What fruit take we of this Kingdom^? Rom: 13. 12. and 16. 20. 2 Cor: 6. 7.
and 10. 4. Ephesians. 4. 8. and 6. 11.



S. It furnishes us with strength and spiritual armor to vanquish the flesh,
the world, sin and the devil, the outrageous and deadly enemies of our soul: it
gives us blessed freedom of consciences: finally, it endoweth us with heavenly
riches, and comfort and strengthens us to live godlily and holily.


M. What manner of Priest is Christ?


S. The greatest, and an everlasting Psalm. 110 4. A^b. 4. 14, 15. and 5. 6. and
7. 3. 11. 15, 26. etc. and 9. 13:
Priest, which only is able to appear before God, only able to make the
Sacrifice that God will allow and accept, and only able to appease the wrath
of God.


M. To what commodity of ours does He Ioh. 14: 27. Acts 10. 36. Ephesians. 2. 14, 16.
Col. 1. 20. 1 Timothy 2. 5. Heb. 9. 14, 15.
this?


S. For us He craveth and prays for peace, and pardon of God, for us He
appeaseth the wrath of God, and us He reconcileth to His Father; for Christ
alone is our Mediator, by whom we are made at one with God: yea, He makes us,
as Rom 8. 14, 15. and 12. 12. Gal. 4* 5. Ephe. 3. 12.
it were fellow Priests with Him in His Priesthood, giving us also an entry to
His Father that we may with assuredness come into His Presence, and be bold by
Him to offer us and all ours to God the Father in Sacrifice.


M. What manner of Prophet is Christ?


S. Whereas m^n did despise and reject Mat. 15 3. 8, 9. and 22. 34. 37: Act. 7.
51, 52. Heb. 1. 1, 2.
the Prophets the servants of Almighty God, sent before by himself to teach
mortal men his Will, and had with their own dreams and inventions darkened and
drowned his holy Word, He Himself the Son of God, the Lord of all Prophets came
down into this world, that fully declaring the Will of his Father, He might
make an end of all Prophesies and and foretellings, He therefore came His
Fathers Ambassador and Messenger to Ioh. 1. 4, 5. and 8. 26. 40. and 15. 15.
and 17. 6. etc.
men, that by his Declaration they might be brought into the right knowledge of
God, and into all truth; so in the Name of Christ are contained those Offices
which the Son of God received from his Father and fulfilled, to make us
partners with Him of all the fruit thereof.


M. It seems then, that in brief thou say thus, that the Son of God is
not only called, and is indeed Jesus Christ, that is, the Savior, King, Priest
and Prophet, but also that He is so for us, and to our benefit and salvation?


S. It is true.


M. But since this honor is given to all the Job. 1. 12, 13. and 11. 32. Romans
9. 26.
godly, to be called the children of God, how do thou call Christ the only
Son of God?


S. God is the natural Father of Christ alone, and Christ alone is naturally
the Mat: 2. 15. and 3. 17. Ioh: 1 14. 43. and 14, 10. Heb: 3. and 5. 5.
Son of God, begotten of the substance of the Father, and being of one
substance with the Father; but us God has freely through Christ made and
adopted his children, therefore we rightly acknowledge Christ the only Son of
God, since this honor is by his own and most just Romans 8. 17: Gal: 4. 5. Ephe:
1. 5. 1 Ioh. 3. 1.
right due unto him; yet the name of children by right of adoption is also
freely imparted to us through Christ.


M. Now how do thou und^rstand that He is our Lord?


S. For that the Father has given him Deu^: 10 17. Mat: 9. 6 and 10. 1. and
28. 18. Luke 1. 12. Ephe. 1. 20.
power and dominion over Men, Angels, and all things, and for that He governs
the Kingdom of God both in heaven and in earth, with his own Will and Power;
and herby are all the godly put in mind, that they are not at their own
liberty, but Deuteronomy. 10 12. 20. Mal: 1. 6.
that both their bodies and souls, and in their life and death, they are wholly
subject to the Lord, to whom they ought to be obedient and serviceable in all
things, as most faithful servants.


M. What follows next?


S. Next is declared how he took upon him man's Nature, and has performed all
things needful to our salvation.


M. Was it then necessary that the Son of God should be made man?


S. Yea, for necessary it was that in what Mat: 17. 22, 23 and 20. 18, 19. Ioh:
11. 50. Rom: 5. 15. etc. 1 Co^: 15. 21. Phil. 2. 6, 7. Heb: 2. 19. I^a: 53. 1 Timothy 2-5. Heb: 9. 15. and 12. 24.
man had offended against God, man should obey and satisfy it, which most
heavy burden none but the Man Jesus Christ was able to take up and b^ar; and
other Mediator could there not be to set men at one with God, and to make peace
between them but Jesus Christ both God and man; therefore being made man, He
did, as it were, put upon our person, that he might therein take upon him, bear,
perform, and fulfill the parts of our salvation.


M But why was He conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Mary,
rather then begotten after the usual and natural manner?


S. It behooves, that he that should and could satisfy for sins, and entirely
restore wicked and damnable persons, should not himself be defiled or blemished
with any spot or stain of sin, but be endued Io^: 1. 19. 1 Cor. 7. H^b: 4. 15.
and 9. ^4. Genesis 6 5, 6. ^sal. 14. 2, 3. and 51 5. Rom: 3. 10.
with singular and perfect uprightn^ss and innocence; therefore when the seed of
man, was wholly corrupt and defiled, it behoved that in conception of the Son
of God there should be the mavelous worshipping of the Holy Ghost whereby He
might be fashioned in the womb of Isa 7. 14. Mat. 1. 20, 23.
the most chaste and pure Virgin, and of her substance, that He should not be
defiled with the common stain and infection of mankind; Christ that pure
Lamb, Exodus 12. 5. I^h. 1 29, 36. 1 Pet. 1. 19.
was begotten by God the Father, conceived by the H. Ghost born of the V. Mary
without sin, that He might cleanse, wash, and put away our spots, who as we were
first conceived and born in sin and uncleanness, so did still from thence forth
continue in unclean life.


M. But why is there in this Christian Confession mention, made by name of the
Virgin Mary.


S. That He might be known to be that Genesis 22. 18. Isa. 11. 1. Mat. 1. 1. 1.
and 22. 4^. Romans 1. 2.
true seed of Abraham and David, of whom it was from God foretold, and
foreshewed by the Prophesies of the Prophets.


M. By this that has been said, I perceive that Jesus Christ the Son of God
did put on man's Nature for salvation of man. Now go forward, what was done
next?


S. That same most joyful and altogether heavenly Doctrine of restoring
salvation by Christ, which Doctrine is called in Greek, Evangelium, the Gospel
or Gladtidings, which in old time was disclosed by the holy Prophets the
servants of Jsa. 53. toto. and 61. 1. Jer. 33. 14. Act. 3. 22, 23. and 7. 17.
God, He himself at length, the Lord of Prophets, Jesus the Son of God, and
also of the Virgin, even the same promised seed, has most clearly taught all
men, and commanded his Apostles, whom He chose for that purpose, to teach the
same Mat. 28. 18* 19. Mar. 16. 15.
throughout the whole world.


M. Did He think it enough to hve simply and plainly taught this Doctrine in
words?


S. No, but to the end that men should with more willing minds embrace it, He
confirmed and approved the same with healing of diseases, driving away devils,
Mat. 4. 24. and 8. 2. 13. 13. 15. Mat. 9. 18. Acts 10. 38. Act 2. 22, 24. and
3. 6. and 5. 5. 12. 15. 16. 19.
and with infinite other good deeds and miracles and signs, whereof both his own
life, and the life of his Apostles most innocently and holily led, was most
plentiful.


M. But why does the Creed omit the Story of his Life, and passes straight
from his Birth to his Death?


S. Because in the Creed are rehearsed only the chief points of our Redemption,
Isa. 53. toto. Acts 13. 23. 27. etc.
and such things also properly belong to it, that they contain, as it were the
substance thereof.


M. Now tell me the order and manner of his death.


S. He was wickedly betrayed and forsaken Isa. 5. 3. Mat. 26. 14. 59. 60. 61.
and 27: 26* 28. 33. 34. etc. Mar. 15. toto, Ioh. 18. 19. toto:
of his own disciples, falsely and maliciously accused of the Jews, condemned
by Pontius Pilate the Judge, cruelly beaten with sore stripes, vilely handled
and scorned, haled up to the Cross, and fastened upon it, and tormented with
all extreme pains, He suffered shameful and most painful death.


M Is this the thank and recompense they gave Him for that heavenly Doctrine,
and for those most great and infinite benefits?


S. These things verily they did to him, for their parts cruelly, and
maliciously Mat. 20. 18. Mar. 10. 45. Ioh. 10. 11. 15. 17, 18. Romans 4. 25. Col.
1. 20. Isa. 53. toto. 2 Cor 5. 21. Gal. 1. 4. Ephe. 1. 7. Col. 2. 14.
and wickedly; but He of his own accord, and willingly suffered and performed
all these things, to the intent with his most sweet Sacrifice to appease his
Father toward mankind, and to pay, and suffer the pains due to us, and by this
mean to deliver us from the same. Neither is it unused among men, one to
promise, and to be surety, yea, some time to suffer for an other; but with
Christ as our Surety, so suffering for us, God dealt as it were with extremity
of Law; but to us whose sins, deservings, punishments and due pains he laid
upon Christ, he used singular lenity, gentleness, clemency and mercy; Christ
therefore suffered, and in suffering overcame death, the pain appointed by the
ever living God for men's offense; yea, and by his death, He overcame, subdued,
overthrew and vanquished him that had the dominion of death, that is, the
devil, from whose tyranny Act. 10. 38. Col. 1. 13. Heb. 2. 14.
and thraldom he rescued us, and set us at liberty.


M. But since we are nevertheless punished with death which daily hangs over
us, and do still suffer the penalty of our sin, what fruit receive we of this
victory?


S. Surely most large fruit, for by Christ's death it is come to pass, that to
Ioh. 11. 35, 26
the faithful, death is now not a destruction, but as it were a removing and
changing of life, and a very short and sure passage into heaven, whether we
ought to follow our Guide without fear, which as He was not destroyed by death,
so will He also not suffer us to perish; wherefore the Ioh. 11: 11. 1 Cor. 15.
18, 1 These* 4. 13, 14:
godly ought now no more to shrink or quake for fear of death, which is to them
the refuge from all the labors, care, and evils of this life, and their Leader
to heaven.


M. Comes there any other profit to us by the death of Christ?


S. In them that through faith are one Romans 6. 4. 7, 11, 12, 13. 22 and 8. 1,
2. 3. 10. 11. 13. Col. 2. 13.
body with Christ, crooked affections and corrupt desires, which we call the
lusts of the flesh, are as it were crucified with Him and dye, so as they have
no more dominion in our souls.


M. Why is the Roman Governor under whom he suffered, expressly named.


S. First, the certain expressing of the persons and times brings credit to
the matter. Secondly, the very thing it self declares that Christ took our
Nature upon Him at his due time, the very time limited and appointed by God,
that is, when the Scepter was transferred from Genesis 49 10. D^n. 9. 25.
the issue of Juda to the Roman, and to Foreign Kings that held the Kingdom
by sufferance under the Roman Empire. Moreover it had been long before
foreshewed Psalm. 2. 2.
by God, that Christ should be delivered to the Gentiles to execution, and
should suffer death by the Judges sentence.


M. Why so?


S. He being guiltless was condemned by the Judges sentence, that he might
Isa* 53. 3. 8. R^^. 5. ^, 6, ^ and ^. 1. (...). 5. 18, 21. 1 Pet. 3. 18.
before the heavenly Judgment Seat acquit and entirely restore us that were
guilty, whose cause was convicted and condemned by the Judgment of God, for if
He had been murdered by thieves, or slain with Sword by private men in an
Uproare or Sedition, such death could have had no form of satisfaction and
recompense.


M. But Pilate did bear witness of his innocence? Mat. 27. 16. 24. Mar. 15: 10.
Luk 23. 14: Ioh. 18. 38: Isa. 53 5. Joh-1. 29. 36. ^. Pet. 3. 18.



S. Pilate did well to bear such witness of himself, since he evidently knew him
innocent, for if he had been guilty, he had not been fit nor meet to bear and
pay the pains of the sins of other, and to appease God toward sinners; but the
same Pilate combred with the continual and agreeable crying of the Jews, and
wearied and overcome with their importunate Mat. 17. 22.
outcryes, did afterward according to the peoples minds and request condemn.
Innocent Christ; whereby it is plain, that He was not punished for his own
sins, Isa. 15. 5, 4. 1 Pet. 2. 24. and 4. 18.
which were none at all in him, nor suffered pains due to himself, but did
bear and pay the pains due to men's wickedness, not due to himself, which of
His own Will He took upon Him, suffering for them by His willing Death, and
with His own guiltless Blood washing away the spots of our offenses.


M. But for what cause did the people so bitterly and thoroughly hate a man of
so great and singular uprightness and innocence?


S. The Priests, Pharisees and Scribes, burning with the fire of envy, when
Mar. 17. 18. Mar, 15. 16. Ioh. 8 40 45. and 11. 47. Mat. 27. 10: Mar. 15. 11.
they could not abide the face and light of the Truth, incensed the hatred of
the unwise multitude against the Rescuer and Defendor of the Truth.


M: Since He was condemned by the Judges sentence, Why do thou say that he
dyed of His own Will?


S. If the Pharisees, Scribes, or other Jews, or they altogether had had power
of life and death upon Christ, they had Luke 11. 53. and 20. 19. Ioh. 8. 59.
and 11. 53. Mat. 26. 4.
long before hastened his death, for they often times before had conspired his
death and destruction; yea, and also where they had determined to deferr the
execution Mat. 26. 2. Mar. 14. 1.
till another time, because the Feast of Sweet Bread was now at hand, which
Feast the Jews were accustomed yearly to keep holy with most great
Religiousness and Solemnity, they could not bring their intent to pass, but
that He suffered hard before the Feast day in a day most unseasonable for them,
but appointed by God for this purpose, whereby sufficiently appears, that no
governance of these things and times was in their hand and power, but that of
His own Will, not compelled by any force, He suffered this Death for our
salvation.


S. Why did God specially appoint that day for His Death? Isa 3. 7. 12: Mat.
20. 28. 26: 53. Ioh. 10. 17. Mat. 16. 2. Luke 22. 1, 7. Mar. 14. 1. 1 Cor. 5.
7. Heb 7. 27.



S. That by the very time also it might be perceived, that Christ is that
Paschal Lamb, that is to say the true, chaste, and pure Lamb that should be
slain, and yield himself the acceptable Sacrifice to his Father for us.


M. Since He had the power to choose His own death, why would He be Crucified
rather then suffer other kind of death?


S. First, for his Fathers Will, whereunto Isa. 53. 12. Mat. 26. 39. 42.
he conformed himself, and which had been long before in old time uttered Mar.
15. 28. Luke 22. 37. Ioh. 1. 14.
and declared by God by so many Prophesies and Oracles, Signs and Tokens:
Moreover, his Will was to suffer all extremity for us, that had deserved all
extremity, for that kind of death was, of all Deuteronomy. 1. ^^. Gal. 3. 13.
other most accursed and abominable, which death yet he chose to dye for us, to
the intent to take upon himself the grievous curse, wherein our sins had Isa.
53. the whole. Psalm. 22* 6, 7. and 27. 21 26. 28. 34 38. 44. 48. Phil. 2. 7, 8.
bound us, and thereby to deliver us from the same curse, for all spiteful
handlings, all reproaches and torments for our salvation, he counted light, and
as things of naught, and so was contented to be despised as an abject, and to
be accounted the basest of all men, that he might restore us, which were
utterly undone to the hope of salvation which we had lost.


M. Have thou any more to say of the death of Christ?


S. That Christ suffered not only a Isa. 53. 6. Psalm. 22. 1. Mar. 26 38. and 27
46. Luke 22. 41.
common death in sight of men, but also was touched with the horror of eternal
death; he fought and wrestled, as it were, hand to hand with the whole army of
hell, before the Judgment Seat of God, he put himself under the heavy
Judgment and grievous severity of Gods punishment; he was driven into hard
distress; he for us suffered and went through horrible fears, and most bitt^^
griefs of mind, to satisfy Gods Judgment in all things, and appease his
wrath, for to sinners, whose person Christ did Jsa 53 4. 5. 8. 1 Pet. 3. 18.
here bear not only the sorrows and pains of present death which are due, but
also of death to come and everlasting, so when he did take upon him, and bear
both the guiltiness and just Judgment of mankind which was undone and already
condemned, he was tormented with so great Psalm. 22. 1. Mat. 27. 46.
trouble and sorrow of mind, that he cried out, My God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me?


M. Is not the Son of God hereby dishonored, and touched with some note of
desparation?


S. He suffered all these things without 1 Pet. 2. 22.
any sin, much less did any desperation possess his soul, for he never ceased
in the mean time to trust in his Father, and to have good hope of his safety;
and being Mat. 23. 36 Luke 23. 46. Heb, 5. 7.
beset round about with fear, he was never dismayed or overwhelmed with sorrow,
and wrestled with the whole power Hos. 13 14. 1 Cor. 15. 26. ^4. 55. Col 1. 13,
14. ^ Tim. 1. 10. Heb. ^. ^4, 15.
of hell, he subdued and overcame all the force that stood against him, and all
the furious and violent assaults; and all these he took upon him and utterly
destroyed them, and himself remained nevertheless most blessed, and imparted
his blessedness to us that put our trust in him, for if we Joh 8* ^4. Ephe. 2.
12. Col. 1. 13. Heb. 2. 14.
had not by this his blessed death obtained salvation and life, we had all
perished for ever in everlasting death.


M. But how could Christ being God, have so great sorrow of mind and
fearfulness?


S. This came to pass according to the Mat. 26 41. Romans 8. 3. 1 Pet. 4: 1.
state of his humane nature, his Godhead in the mean time not putting forth the
force of his power.


M. Now rehearse me briefly in a sum these most large benefits which the
faithful rereceive by the death of Christ and his most grievious pain. Heb. 7.
27. and 9. 12. and 10. 12 14.



S. Briefly with the one only Sacrifice of his death, he satisfied for our sins
before God, and appeasing the wrath of God made us at one with him, with his
Heb. 9. 14. 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
blood, as with most pure washing, he washed and cleansed away all the filth
and spots of our souls, and defacing with Psalm: 32. 1, 2. Rom: 4. 7, 8. Heb.
10. 17.
everlasting forgetfulness the memory of our sins, that they shall no more come
in the sight of God, he has cancelled, made Col: 2. 14.
void, and done away the Handwriting whereby we were bound and convicted, and
also the Decree by the sentence whereof Ioh. 3. 16. and 11. 25, 26: Rom: 1. 4*
7. 11. etc. and 8. 1, 2. 8. 10, 11. etc. Col: 2. 13.
we were condemned. All these things has he done by his death, both for the
living, and for the dead that trusted in him while they lived. Finally, by the
strength of his death he so bridleth and subdueth in them that cleave wholly
unto him by faith, the lusts which otherwise are unbridled and untamed, and so
quenches the burning heat of them, that they more easily obey and yield to the
Spirit. M. Why do thou also add that he was buried? Isa. 53. 9. Ma. 12. 40.
and 27. 39. 60. Cor 15. 4. 6.



S. His dead and spiritless body was laid in the Grave, that his death should
bc more evident, and that all men might certainly know it: For if he had by and
by revived, many would have brought his death in question, and so might it
seem, that it was likely to prove doubtful.


M. What means that which follows of his descending into Hell.


S. That as Christ in his body descended into the bowels of the earth, so in
his soul severed from the body, he descended into hell; and that therein also the
virtue and efficacy of his death so peirced through to the Pet. 3. 19: Ioh, 24.
Cor 15 55. Col. 1. 14. Heb. 2: 14. 15 Joh. 5: 25. 11. 25. 26. Romans 14. 9. Col.
1. 19. 20:
dead, and to very hell it self, that both the Souls of the unbeleiving felt
their most painful and just damnation for Infidelity, and Satan himself the
Prince of Hell felt that all the power of his tyranny and darkness was weakened,
vanquished, and fallen to ruin: on the other side, the dead, which while they
lived, believed in Christ, understood that the work of their redemption was now
finished, and understood and perceived the effect and strength thereof with
most sweet and assured comfort.


M. Now let us go forward to the rest. Mat. 28. 6. 9. Mark 16. 6. 9: Luke 24.
6, 7. 14, 15. Ioh: 20. 14. 19. 20. 26. 8. 2. 1. 4. Act. 1. 3, 4. 8. 21. 24. 32.



S. The third day after he rose again; and by the space of forty days
oftentimes showed himself alone to them that were his, and was conversant among
his Disciples, eating and drinking with them.


M. Was it not enough that by his death we obtain deliverance from sin and
pardon.


S. That was not enough if we consider Rom: 1: 2, 3.
either him or our selves. For if he had not been risen again, he could not be
thought the Son of God. Yea, and the same did Mat. 27. 40. 41. 42. Mark 15. 30.
Luke 23. 35. 37.
they that saw it when he hung on the Cross, reproach him with and object
against him. He saved others (said they) himself he cannot save. Let him now
come down from the Cross and we will believe him. But now rising from the dead
to eternity of life, he declared a greater power of his Rom, 1. 2, 3. Heb. 9.
27.
Godhead, then if in descending from the Cross he had fled from the terrors
of death. To dye certainly is common to all, and though some for a time have a
voided death intended against them, yet to loose or break the bonds of death
once suffered and by his own power to rise alive again, Romans 1. 4. and 6. 4. 9:
and 14. 9. 1 Cor: 15. 54, 55. 57. Ephesians. 1. 20. Col. 1. 17, 18. 1 John 3. 8. Heb.
2, 14:
that is the proper doing of the only Son of God Jesus Christ the Author of
life, by which, he had showed himself the Conqueror of sin and death, yea and
of the Devil himself.


M. For what other cause rose he again.


S. That the Prophesies of David and of Psalm: 16. 10. Mat: 12. 40. Act: 2. 26*
31.
other holy Prophets might be fulfilled, which told before, that neither his
body should be touched with corruption, nor his soul be left in Hell.


M. But what profit brings it unto us, that Christ rose again?


S. Manifold and diverse. For thereof comes to us Righteousness, which before
Rom: 4. 25. Rom: 6. 5, 11, 12, 13. Col: 3. 1, 2.
we lacked: thence comes unto us endeavor of innocence, which we call
newness of life, thence comes to us power, virtue, and strength to live well
and holily, thence have we hope that our Ioh: 11. 25. Rom: 8. 11. 1 Cor: 15.
21, 22, 23. Romans 8. 11. 1 Cor. 15. 20. 14. 16.
mortal bodies also shall one day be restored from death and rise whole again.
For if Christ himself had been destroyed by death he had not been our
deliverer, for what hope of safety should we have had left by him that had not
saved himself: It was therefore meet for the person which the Lord did bear,
and a necessary help for us to salvation, that Christ should first deliver
himself from death, and afterward Rom: 8. 11. 1 Cor. 15. 20. 20. 21, 22. 1
Pet. 1. 3.
he should break and pull in sunder the bands of death for us, and that so we
might set the hope of our salvation in his Resurrection, for it cannot be, that
Christ our Ephe. 1. 22. and 4. 15, 16. and 5. ^ 23. Col. 1. 18.
head rising again should suffer us the members of his body, to be consumed and
utterly destroyed by death.


M. Thou have touched my child, the principal causes of the Resurrection of
Christ, now I would hear what thou think of his ascending to Heaven.


S. He being covered with a Cloud spread about him, in sight of his Apostles
ascending into Heaven, or rather above Mar: 16. 19. Luke 4. 51. Acts 1: 9, 10.
all Heavens, where he sits on the right hand of God the Father.


M. Tell me how this is to be understood.


S. Plainly that Christ in his body ascended Ioh: 14. 19. and 16. 10. ^6. 28.
into Heaven where he had not before been in his body, for in his nature of
Godhead, which fills all things, both he ever was in heaven, and also with
the same and with his spirit, he is always present in Mat: 18. 23. and 28 20.
Earth with his Church, and shall be present till the end of the world.


M. Thou say that there is one manner of his Godhead and another of his
manhood.


S. Yea certainly, for we neither make Jsa: 7. 14. Mat: 1. 2, 23. Luke 2. 7 40.
52. Joh. 1. 3, 14. Gal. 4 4. Mark 16. 19. Luke 24. 51. Acts 1. 9, 10. and 3.
21. Ephe. 4. 10. Joh. 1. 3. and 16. 15. 1 Cor. 15. 28. Ephe. 1. 23. Cos. 1. 16,
17.
of his Godhead a body, nor of his body God, for his Manhood is a Creature, his
Godhead not created, and the holy scriptures witness that his Manhood was
taken up into heaven, but his Godhead is so every where, that it fills both
Heaven and Earth.


M. M. Do thou say that Christ is in any wise present with us in body.


S. If we may liken great things to small, Christ's body is so present to our
faith, as the Sun when we see it, is present to our eye. For no one thing
subject to our senses comes more near to the likeness of Christ than the Sun,
which though it still abide in the Heaven, and in very deed touches not the
eye, yet the body of the Sun is present to the sight, notwithstanding so great
a distance of place between: so the Ioh. 14, 19. and 16. 10. 26. Act. 7. 55:
Col: 3. 1. Heb. 4. 16. and 10. 18. and 11. 1. 3.
body of Christ, which by his ascending is taken up from us, and has left the
world and is gone to his Father, is indeed absent from our senses, yet our
faith is conversant in Heaven, and beholds that Son of righteousness, and is
verily in presence with it there present; like as our sight is present with the
body of the Sun in the Heaven, or as the Sun is present with our sight on the
Earth. Moreover as the Sun is with his light present to all things, so is Mat.
28. 20. Ephesians* 1. 23. ^ol. 1. 17. 18.
also Christ with his Godhead, Spirit, and Power present to all and fills
all.


M. Now as touching Christ, what do thou chiefly consider in his ascending
into Heaven and sitting at the right hand of his Father.


S. It was meet that Christ, which from the highest degree of honor and
dignity, had descended to the basest estate of a Servant, and to the reproach
of condemnation and shameful death, should on the other side obtain most noble
glory and excellent estate, even the same which we had before, That his Glory
and Majesty might in proportion answer to his baseness and shame. Which thing
St. Paul also Phil. 2. 8. 9. 10. Ephesians. 1. 20. 21. 22. 23. Col. 1. 18.
writing to the Philippians, most plainly teaches; he became (says he)
obedient to the death, even the death of the Cross. And therefore God made him
the head of the Church, advanced him above all Principalities, endowed him with
the dominion of Heaven and Earth to govern all things, exalted him to the
highest height, and gave him a name that is above all names, That at the name
of Jesus every knee should bow both of things in Heaven, Earth, and Hell.


M. When thou namest the right hand of God, and sitting, do thou then suppose
and imagine that God has the shape of a man.


S. No Sir, but because we speak of God among men, we do in some sort after the
manner of men, express thereby how Christ has received the Kingdom given him
of his Father: for Kings use to set Psalm: 110. 1. Mat. 20. 21: Ephesians. 1: 22: and
4: 15: 16. and 5: 23: Co^: 1. 18.
them on their right hands to whom they vouchsafe to do highest honor, and
make Lieutenants of their Dominion; therefore in these words is meant that God
the Father made Christ his Son the Head of the Church, and that by him, his
pleasure is to preserve them that be his, and to govern all things universally.


M. Well said, Now what profit take we of his ascending into heaven and sitting
on the right hand of his Father:


S. First Christ, as he had descended to the Earth, as into banishment for our
sake so when he went up into heaven, his Fathers Inheritance, he entered it in
our name, making a way and entry thither Ioh. 14 2. 2 Cor. 5. 1. Ephesians. 2. 18.
Heb. 10. 19, 20. 22. Ioh. 17. 24. Ephe. 1. 22. and 4. 15. Ioh. 16. 26. Rom: 8.
34. Heb. 7. 25. and 9. 14. 1 Ioh. 2. 1.
and opening us the gate of heaven, which was before shut against us for sin;
for since Christ our Head has carried with him our flesh into heaven, he so
mighty and loving a Head, will not leave us for ever in earth that are members
of his body. Moreover he being present in the sight of God, and commending us
unto him, and making Intercession for us, is the Patron of our cause, who being
our Advocate, our matter shall not quail.


S. But why did he not rather tarry with us here in earth?


S. When he had fully performed all things that were appointed him of his
Father, and which belonged to our salvation, Job, 14 31. and ^7. 4. and 19. 30.
he needed not to tarry any longer on earth. Yea also, all those things he does
being absent in body, which he should do if he were bodily present, he
preserves, comfort and strengthens, corrects, restrains and
chasteneth. Moreover as he promises, he sends down Ioh. 14. 16, 16. and 26.
and 16. 7. 13. Romans 5. 5. and 8. 9. 16. 1 Cor. 12. 4. etc. 2 Cor. 1. 22. Ephe.
1. 17. Romans 8. 4 etc. Col. 3. 1, 2. Ephe. 4. 22. 30.
his Holy Spirit from heaven into our hearts, as a most sure pledge of his good
Will, by which Spirit he brings us out of darkness and mist into open light;
He gives sight to the blindness of our minds, He chaseth sorrow out of our
hearts, and heals the wounds thereof, and with the divine motion of his
Spirit. He causes that looking up to heaven we raise up our minds and hearts
from the ground, from corrupt affections and earthly things upward to the place
where Christ is at the right hand of his Father, that we thinking upon, and
beholding things above and heavenly, and so raised up, and of upright mind, we
contemn these our base things, life, death, riches, poverty, and with lofty
and high courage despise all worldly things. Finally, this may be Mat. 28. 18.
Luk 1. 23. Ioh. 17. 2. Ephesians. 1. 20, 21. Phil, 2. 9, 10. etc.
the sum, that Christ sitting on the right hand of God does with his Power,
Wisdom, and Providence rule and dispose the world, move, govern, and order all
things, and so shall do till the frame of the world be dissolved.


M. Since then Christ being in his body taken up into heaven, does yet not
forsake His here in earth, they Judge very grosely that measure his presence or
absence by hi^ body only*


S. Yea truly, for things that are not bodily, cannot be subject to Sense; who
ever saw his own soul? no man, but what is more present, what nearer, what
closer joined then every man's soul to himself? spiritual things are not to be
seen but Ioh. 8. and 58. 14 21. Col. 3. 1. Ephe. 1. 17, 18.
with the eye of the Spirit. Therefore who so will see Christ in earth, let him
open his eyes, not of his body but of his soul and of Faith, and he shall see
him present whom the eye sees not:


M. But with whom does Faith acknowledge that he is pecu^iarly and most
effectually present?


S. The eyesight of Faith shall espy him present, yea, and in the midst Joh.
14. 18. 21. Mat. 18. 19, 20. and 28. 20.
whersoever two or three are gathered together in his Name it shall see him
present, with them that be his, that is, with all the true godly, even to the
end of all worlds. What said I, it shall see Christ present, yea every godly
person shall both see and feel him dwelling in himself, Ioh. 14. 23. Ephe. 3.
16. 17. Col. 3. 11. ^uke 2* 23. and 17. 20, 21. I^h. 6. 15.
even as his own soul, for he dwells and abides in that man's soul that
puts all his trust in him.


M. Have thou yet any more to say hereof?


S. Christ by ascending and sitting on the right hand of his Father has
removed, and thoroughly rooted up out of men's hearts that false opinion which
sometime his Apostles themselves had Mat. 20. 23. Luke 24. 21. Acts 1. 6.
conceived, namely that Christ should reign visibly here in earth as other
Kings of the earth and worldly Princes do; the Lord would pull their Error out
of their Ioh. 18. 36.
minds, and have us to think more highly of his Kingdom; therefore his Will
was to absent himself from our eyes and from all bodily sense, that by this
means our faith may be both stirred up and exercised Ephe: 1. 18. Col. 3. 1, 2.
to behold his Governance and Providence that is not perceived by bodily sense.


M. Is there any other why he withdrew himself from the earth into heaven?


S. Since he is Prince not of some one Land but of all Lands, of the world, yea
Mat. 28. 18. 1 Cor. 15. 24, 25. 27, 28. Romans 14. 9. Phil. 2. 9, 10. Luke 17, 21.
and of heaven also, and Lord both of quick and dead; meet it was that He
should Govern his Kingdom in order unknown to our senses, for if he should be
within reach of sight, then must he needs change place and seat and be drawn
now hither now thither, and now and then remove into sundry Countries to do his
affairs; for if in one moment of time he were ever present with all men, thcn
should he seem not to be a man but some Ghost, and not to have a very body but
Imaginative, or (as Euteche^ thought) that his body was turned into his Godhead
that it might be thought to be every where, whereof would by and by arise
infinite false opinions, all which he has driven away with carrying his body
up whole into heaven, and has delivered men's minds from most foul Errors, yet
in the mean time, though he be not seen of us, he wonderously rules and
governs Mat. 28. 18. Phil. 2. 9, 10.
the world, with most high Power and Wisdom. It is for men to govern and order
their Commonweals after a certain order of men; but for Christ that is the
Son of God, to do it after the manner of God.


M. Thou have touched certain of the chief of the infinite and unmeasurable
benefits, the fruit whereof we receive by the Death, Resurrection and Ascension
of Christ, for the whole cannot be conceived by the mind and heart of man, mueh
less in any wise expressed with words and utterance. But yet thus far I will
try thy knowledge in this matter, to have thee set me out briefly in a sum the
chief principal points whereunto all the rest are referred.


S. Then I say, that both of these, and of the other doings of Christ we take
two kinds of profit; the one, that whatsoever things He has done, He has done
them all for our benefit, even as far^ ^^ they be as much our own, so that with
steadfast and lively faith we Isa. 9. 6. 1 Cor. 15. 48, 49. Romans 6. 6, 7. etc.
and 8. 32. and 13. 14. Gal. 2. 20. and 17. Heb. 3. 14. and 10. 17.
cleave unto them, as if we our selves had done them; He was crucified, and we
also are crucified with him, and our sins punished in him: He died and was
buried, we also together with our sins are dead and buried, and that so all the
remembrance of our sins is for ever forgotten. He rose from death, and we also
are risen again with him, being so made partakers of his Resurrection and Life,
and that from thenceforth death has no more dominion over us; for in us is the
same Romans 8. 11.
Spirit which raised Christ from the dead. Finally, beside that since his
Ascension, we have most abundantly received the gifts of the holy Ghost, he
has lifted and carried Ephesians. 4. 8.
us up into heaven with him, that we might, as it were, with our Head take
possession thereof. These things indeed are not seen, but then shall they be
brought to light, when Christ which is Ioh. 8. 12. Romans 8. 23. 1 Cor. 1. 30.
Col. 1. 5. and 2. 3. and 4. 3. 11. 1. Pet. 1. 4.
the Light of the World in whom all our hope and wealth is set and settled,
shining with immortal glory, shall show himself openly unto all men.


M. What manner of profit is the other which we receive of the doings of
Christ?


S. That Christ has set himself for an Examplar for us to follow, to frame our
Ioh. 13. 15 1 Pet. 2 ^^ 1 John ^
life according thereunto, where Christ dyed for sin, and was buried, he but
once suffered death, from whence he did arise again with power and Ascended
into heaven; he now dies no more but enjoys eternal life, and reigns in
most high and everlasting glory: So if we be once dead and buried Romans 6. 2, 3.
10 Gal. 2. 19. Col. 2. 20. and 3. 1. 2 Timothy 2. 11.
to sin, how shall we hereafter live in the same? if we be risen again with
Christ, if by assured faith and steadfast hope we be conversant with him in
heaven, then ought we from henceforth to bend all our cares and thoughts upon
heavenly, divine, and eternal things, not earthly, worldly, and transitory* and
as we have Romans 8. 20. 1 Cor. 15. 47, 48, 49.
heretofore borne the Image of the earthly man, we ought from henceforth to put
on the Image of the heavenly man, quietly and patiently bearing, after his
example all sorrows and wrongs, and following and exprssing his other Divine
virtues so far as mortal men be able, and whereas Christ our Lord never
cease to do us good, continually to entreat for, and to crave his Fathers
mercy for us, to give us his holy Spirit, and wonderfully and continually to
garnish his Church with most liberal gifts, it is meet that we in like manner
with our whole endeavor Ioh. 13. 18. and 15. 12. Ephe. 5. 2. H^b. 12. 14.
should help our neighbor, and we be bound to all men in most straight bonds
of love, concord, and most near friendship so much as shall lie in us, and so
to be wholly framed after the manner of Christ Gal. 2. 20. 1 Pet. 2. 21. 1 Ioh.
2. 6.
as our only Exampler.


M. Are we not also here by put in mind of our duties toward Christ?


S. We are indeed admonished that we obey and follow the will of Christ, whose
we are wholly, and whom we profess to be our Lord; that we so again on our part
and with all our affection, love, esteem, and embrace Christ our Savior which
showed us such dear love while we are yet his enemies, as his most entire love
toward us could not possibly be increased: that we hold Christ dearer to us
then our selves, that to Christ which has so given himself wholly to us, we
again yield our Mat. 10. 19. 37. and 16. 25. Luke 9: 23, 24. and 14 26
selves wholly and all that is ours, that we esteem riches, honors, glory, our
Country, parents, children, wives, and all dear, pleasant, and delightful
things of no value in Comparison of Christ, and account light and despise all
dangers for Christ: Finally, that we loose our life and our very soul rather
then forsake Christ, and our love and duty toward him, for happy is the death
that being due to Nature, is chiefly yielded for Christ, for Christ I say,
which offered and yielded himself to willing death for us and which being Mar
8. 3^:
the Author of life both will, and is able to deliver us being dead from death,
and Mar. 8. 31:
restore us to life.


M. Go forward.


S We are furthermore taught purely and sincerely to worship Christ the Lord
now reigning in heaven not with any earthly worship, wicked traditions, Mat.
15. 5. 6. 89. Ioh, 4. 21. 22. ^^h. 4 23, 24
and cold inventions of men, but with heavenly and very Spiritual worship,
such as may best beseem both us that give it, and him that receives it, even
as he honored and honoreth his father, seeing that (...) 4. 23. 24.
all in one we give the same honor to his father. For he that honoreth Christ,
honoreth also his father, whereof he himself Joh. 5. 23.
is a most sure and substantial witness.


M. Now I would hear the tell me short^y what thou think of the last
judgment and the end of the world,


S. Christ shall come in the clouds of the Mat. 24. 29: 30. and 25. 31. 1. Cor.
15. 52. 1. These. 4: 16.
heavens with most high glory, and with most honorable and reverend Majesty,
waited on and beset with the company and multitude of holy Angels. And at the
horrible sound and dreadful blast of Trumpet, all the dead, that have lived
from the creation of the World to that day, shall rise again with their souls
and bodies whole and perfect: and shall appear before his throne to be judged,
Romans 14. 10* 12. 1. Cor: 4: 4. 5. 2. Cor, 5. 10.
every one for himself, to give account of their life, which shall be examined
by the uncorrupted and severe judge according to the truth.


M. But seeing the day of Judgment shall be in the end of the World, and death
is limited and certainly appointed for all, how do thou in the Creed say that
some shall then be quick or a live.


S. St. Paul teaches that they which 1. Cor. 15. 31. 1, These. 4. 7. 1. Cor.
15. 42. 43: 53, 54: Phil: 3: 21.
then shall remain alive, shall suddenly be changed and made new, so that the
corruption of their bodies being taken away, and mortality removed, they shall
put on immortality. And this change shall be to them instead of a death,
because the ending of corrupted nature shall be the beginning of a nature
uncorrupted.


M. Ought the godly at thinking upon this judgment be stricken and abased with
fear, and to dread it and shrink from it.


S. No: for he shall give the sentence, which was once by the judges sentence
condemned for us, to the end that we coming under the grievous judgment of God,
should not be condemned, but acquitted in judgment. He, I say, shall pronounce
Romans 8: 9. 23* 38. 39. 1: Cor. 1. 7 Phil: 3. 20. Tit. 2. 13. 2, Pet. 3. 12.
the judgment in whose faith and protection we are and which has taken upon
him the defense of our cause. Yea our conciences are cheerfully stayed with a
most singular comfort, and in the midst of the miseries and woes in this life,
do leap for joy that Christ shall one day be the Judge of the world. For upon
this hope we chiefly rest our selves that then at last we shall with
unchangable Eternity possess that same Kingdom of immortality and
everlasting life, in all parts fully and abundantly perfect, which hitherto
has been Mat. 25. 14. 1 Cor. 13. 9. 10. and* 15 42, 43. 53, 54. Mat. 2. 12.
and 22 13. and. 25. 13. 41. Heb. 10. 26. 27: Iud. 6. 7. 8.
but begun, and which was ordained and appointed for the children of God before
the foundations of the world were laid, but the ungodly, which have not feared
the justice and wrath of God, or have not trusted in his clemency and mercy by
Christ, and which have persecuted the godly by land and sea, and done them all
kinds of wrong, and slain them with all sorts of torments and most cruel
deaths, shall with satan and all the devils, be cast into the prison of hell
appointed for them, the revenger of their wickedness and offenses, and into
everlasting darkness, where being tormented with conscience of their own sin
with eternal fire, and with all and most extreme execution, they shall pay and
suffer eternal pains. for that offense which mortal men have done against the
unmeasurable and infinite Majesty of the immortal God, is worthy also of
infinite and ever during punishment.


M. To the last judgment is adjoined the end of the world, whereof I would have
thee speak yet more plainly.


S The Apostle declares that the end of Mat* 24. 29. 30. 35. 2. Pet: 3: 10.
11: etc.
the world shall be thus. The heaven shall pass away like a scrole, the
Elements with heat shall be molten, the ^arth and all things therein shall be
inflamed with fire, as if he should say, the time shall come when this world
burning with heat, all the corruption thereof (as we see in gold) tried by fire,
shall be wholly fined, and renewed to most absolute and high perfection and
shall put on a most beautiful face, which in everlasting ages of worlds shall
never be changed. For this is it that St. 2. Pet. 3. 13.
Peter says, we looked for, according to the promise of God, a new heaven and
a new earth, wherein righteousness shall inhabit. Neither is it uncredible that
as sin, so the the corruption of things and Romans 8. 19. 22. etc. 2. Pot. 3.
13.
changeableness, and other evils grown of sin, shall once at the last have an
end. And this is the sum of the second part of the Conclusion.
Christian faith. wherein is contained the whole story of our Redemption by
Jesus Christ.


M. Since then thou have now spoken of God the The third part of the Creed.
Father the Creator, and ^f ^is Son Jesus Christ the Savior* and so h^st ended
two parts of the christian faith, and confession, now I would The Holy Ghost.
Mar. 28. 19. Ioh. 14. 16 and 15: 16. and 16. 7. and 20. 22. Act. 5. 3. 4.
hear thee speak of the third part what thou beleivest of the Holy Ghost.


S. I confess that he is the third Person of the most holy Trinity, proceeding
from the Father and the Son before all beginning equal with them both, and of
the very same substance, and together with them both to be honored and called
upon.


M. Why is he called Holy?


S. Not only for his own Holiness which yet is the highest holiness but also
Romans 1. 4. and 15. 16. 2. These. 2. 13. Tit. 3. 5. 1. Pet. 1. 2.
for that by him the elect of God, and the members of Christ are made holy. For
which cause the holy Scriptures have called him the Spirit of Sanctification.


M. In what things do thou think that Sanctification consists.


S. First we are by his divine instinct Ioh. 3. 5. Tit. 3. 5.
and inspiration newly begotten, and therefore Christ said that we must be born
again of water and of the spirit; Also by his heavenly breathing on us, God the
Rom 8: 15: 16. Col 4 5. 6 ^oh 14. 17. 26, and. 16. 3. 1 Cor. 2* 10. 11. 15.
Ephesians. 1 17. Joh. 20: 22:
Father does adopt us his children, and therefore he is worthily called the
Spirit of Adoption, By his expounding, the divine mysteries are opened unto us:
By his light, the eyes of our souls are made clear to understand them. By his
judgment, sins are either pardoned or reserved; By his strength sinful flesh
is subdued and Rom: 8. 4: 5. etc. 13, 14. etc: 26. Act 2. 4. Cor. 12. 4 7: and
e.
tamed. And corrupt desires are bridled, and restrained: At his will, manifold
gifts are distributed among the godly in the manifold and diverse discommodities
molestations and miseries of this life, the Holy Ghost with his secret
consolation, and with good hope does assuage, case, and comfort the greifs and
mournings of the godly, which commonly are in this world most afflicted, and
whose sorrows do pass all humane consolation: whereof He has the true and
proper name of Paraclet or the Comforter. Finally, by his power, our Rom: 8. 11.
mortal bodies shall rise a live again, Briefly, whatsoever benefits are given
us in 1: Cor 12. 4. 7. etc.
Christ all these we understand, feel, and receive by the work of the Holy
Ghost. Not unworthily therefore we put confidence and trust in the Author of so
great gifts, and do worship, and call upon him.


M. Now remains the fourth part, of the The fourth part of the Creed, The
Church:
Holy Catholic Church, of the whieh I would hear what thou think.


S. I will bring into few words that which the holy scriptures do hereof largly
and plentifully declare. Before that the Lord God made heaven and earth he
determined to have to himself a certain most beautiful Kingdom and most holy
Commonwealth. This his Apostles that Matthew. 16 1^
wrote in Greek, called Ecclesia, by which interpreting the word, may fitly be
called a Congregation. Into this as into his own City, God did Incorporate an
infinite multitude of men, which must all Mat. 28. 19. Acts 2. 5, 9. 1 Cor. 12
13. Ephesians. 5. 23, 24.
be subject, serviceable and obedient to Christ their only King and which have
all committed themselves to his protection, and of whom he has taken upon him
to be Defender, and does continually maintain and preserve. To this
Commonwealth do all they properly belong, as Acts 14. 34, 35. Romans 2. 11. Gal.
6. 15, 16. Col. 3. 11, 12. etc.
many as truly fear, honor and call upon God, altogether applying their minds
to live holily, and godly, and which putting all there trust and hope in God, do
most assuredly look for the blessedness of eternal life. They that be
steadfast and stable, and constant in this faith, were Mat. 16. 18. Romans 8. 29,
30. Ephe. 1. 4, 5. Col: 3. 12. Tit. 1. 1. Romans 8 9. 15, 16. 2 Cor: 1. 22. and
5. 5. Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. and 5. 10.
chosen and appointed, and (as we term it) predestined to this great
felicity, before the foundations of the world were laid, whereof they have a
witness within them in their souls, the Spirit of Christ the Author, and
therewith also the most sure pledge of this confidence; by the instinct of
which Divine Spirit, I do most assuredly persuade my self that I am also by
Gods good gift through Christ freely made one of his blessed City.


M. It is sure a godly and very necessary persuasion. Now therefore give me the
definition of the Church that thou speak off.


S. I may most briefly and truly say, 1 Cor. 12. 27. Ephe. 1. 23. and 5. 23.
Col. 1. 24. 24.
that the Church is the body of Christ.


M. Yea I would have it more plainly and at large.


S. The Church is the body of the Romans 12. 5. 1 Cor. 12. 12. and 20. 26. Ephe.
3. 9. Mat: 25. 34. Ephe. 1. 4, 5. 2 These. 3. 13.
Christian Commonweal, that is, the Universal number and fellowship of the
faithful, whom God through Christ has before all beginning of time appointed
to everlasting life.


M. Why is this Point put into the Creed.


S. Because if the Church were not, both Christ had died without cause, and all
things which has been hitherto spoken off should be in vain, and come to
nothing*


M. How so?


S. Because hitherto we have spoken of the causes of salvation, and have
considered the foundations thereof, namely how God by the deservings of CHRIST
loves us, and dearly esteems us, how also by the Work of the holy Ghost we
receive this grace of God, whereunto we are restored: but of these, this is the
only effect, that there be Mat. 16. 12. Acts 20. 28. 1 Cor. 12. 1^, and 14. 12.
2 Col. 11. 28.
a Church, that is, a Company of godly, upon whom these benefits of God may be
bestowed, that there be a certain City and Commonweal, in which he ought Ephesians.
3. 10, 11. 21 5. 25. 1 Timothy 3. 15.
to lay up, and as it were to consecrate all we have, and to give our selves
wholly unto it, and for which we ought not to stick to dye.


M. Why do thou call this Church holy?


S. That by this mark it may be discerned Romans 8. 29. 1 Cor. 14. 33. Ephe.. 4,
11.
from the wicked Company of the ungodly, for all those whom God has chosen he
has restored to holiness of life and innoceny.


M. Is this holiness which thou do attribute to the Church already upright
and in all points perfect.


S. Not yet, for so long as we live a mortal life, in this world; such is the
feeblenese and frailty of mankind, we are of too weak strength wholly to shun
Romans 8. 26. 1 Cor. 13. 9. 11, 12. 1 Cor 5. 9.
all kind of vices: therefore the holiness of the Church is not yet full and
perfectly finished, but yet very well begun, but when it shall be fully joined
to Christ, from whom she has all her cleanness and pureness, then shall she be
clothed with innocence and holiness in all points full 1 Cor: 13. 10, 11. and
15 53. Ephe. 5. 26.
and perfectly finished as with a certain Snowy white and pure garment.


M. To what purpose do thou call this Church Catholic.


S. It is as much as if I called it Universal; for this Company or Ass^mbly of
the godly is not pent up in any certain Mat. 2. 19. Act. 2 5 9. and 10. 34 35.
1 Cor. 12. 13, 14.
place or time, but it contains and compriseth the universal number of the
faithful, that have lived, and shall live in all places and Ages since the
beginning of the world, that there may be one body of the Church, as there is
one Christ the only Head of the body. For whereas the Jews claimed and
challenged to themselves Mat. 8 11. Ephesians. 2. 12. 13, 14 etc. and 4. 4, 5. etc.
the Church of God as peculiar and by lenial right due to their Nation, and
said it was theirs, and held it to be only theirs; the Christian Faith
professes that a great number and infinite multitude Acts 1. 8 and 2. 5, 8, 9.
10 35. Col. 3. 11. etc. Ephe. 4 4, 5. and 5. 23.
of godly persons, gathered together out of all Countries of the world, out of
all parts, of all Nations, every where, and all Ages, of all Times, by the
strength and power of his holy Word and Voice, and by the Divine motion of his
heavenly Spirit, is by God incorporated into this Church as into his own City,
which all agreeing together in one true faith, one mind and voice, may bein
all things obedient to Christ their only King, as members to their Head. 2 Cor.
6. 13. Ephe 4 15, 16. and 5* 30. Col. 1. 18.



M. Do thou think that they do well that join to this part of the Christian
Belief, that they believe the holy Catholic Church of Rome?


S. I do not only think that they join wrong forged sense to this place, while
they will have no man to be counted in the Church of Christ, but him that
esteems for holy all the Decrees and Ordinances of the Bishop of Rome, but
also do judge that when by adding afterward the name of one Nation, they
abridge and draw in too narrow room the Universal extent of the Church which
themselves do first confess to be far and wide spread abroad every where
amongst all Lands and People, they are herein far madder then the Jews,
joining and pronouncing with one breath mere contrary sayings; but into this
madness are they driven by a blind greedinese and desire to shift and foyst in
the Bishop of Rome to be Head of the Church in earth in stead of Christ.


M. Now I would hear thee tell me why after the holy Church, thou immediately
addest that we believe The Communion of Sa^nts.


S. Because these two belong all to one thing, and are very fitly matched and
agreeing together; for this parcel does somewhat more plainly express the
conjoyning and society that is among the Members of the Church, then which
there can be no nearer; for whereas God has as well in all Coasts and Countries
as in all Times and Ages them that worship 1 Cor. 12* ^2. 13. etc. 15, 16.
Ephe. 4, 15. 16. and 5 30 Col. 1. 18. and 2. 19.
him purely and sincerely, all they though they be severed and sundered by
diverse and far distant times and places in what Nation soever, or what Land
soever they be in, are yet members most nearly conjoined and knit together of
one and the same body whereof Christ is the Head. Such is the Communion that the
g^dly have with God and among Ephe. 4 3. 4, 5, etc. 22. 26. Col. 2. 19.
themselves; for they are most nearly knit together in community of Spirit, of
Faith, of Sacraments, of Prayers, of forgiveness of Sins, of eternal felicity;
and finally of all the benefits that God gives to his Church through Christ;
yea they are so joined with most straight bonds of concord and love, they have
so all one mind, that the profit of any one, and of them all, is all one, and
to this endeavor they do bend themselves how they may with enterchange of
beneficial doings, with council and help further each other in all things, and
specially to the attaining of that blessed and eternal life. But because Matt
7. 12. and 19. 14. and 22. 39. Romans 12. 5. 1 Cor. 10. 24. and 13. 5. 2 Cor. 11.
28: Gal. 6. ^. Phil. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 2. 14, 15.
this Communion of Saints cannot be perceived by our senses, nor by any natural
kind of knowledge or force of understanding, as other communities and
fellowships of men may be, therefore it is here rightly placed among all these
things that lie in Belief.


M I like very well this brief discourse of the Church, and of the benefits of
God bestowed upon her through Christ, for the same is most plainly taught in
the holy Scriptures: But may the Church be otherwise known then by beleiving by
Faith?


S. Here in the Creed is properly entreated of the Congregation of those whom
God by his secret Election has adopted to himself through Christ, which Romans
8. 29, 30, 33. Ephesians 1. 4, 5, 11. Col. 3. 12.
Church can neither be seen with eyes, nor can continually be known by signs,
yet there is a Church of God visible, or that may be seen, the tokens or marks
whereof he does show and open unto us.


M. Then that this whole matter of the Church may be made plainer, so discribe
and point me out that same Visible Church with her Marks and Signs that it may
be descerned from other fellowship of men?


S. I will assay to do it as well as I can: The Visible Church is nothing else
but a certain multitude of men, which in what place soever they be, do profess
the doctrine of Christ pure and sincere, even the same Isa. 55. 5. Mar. 10: 14.
and 28. 19. Luke 24. 47. Romans 10 8. 9. 2 Timothy 1. 18.
which the Evangelists and Apostles have in the Everlasting Monuments of holy
Scriptures faithfully disclosed to memory, and which do truly call upon God the
Father in the name of Christ, and moreover do use his Mysteries, commonly
called Ioh. 14 13. and 15. 16. and 16. 23. Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 23.
Sacraments, with the same pureness and simplicity (as touching their
substance) which the Apostles of Christ used and have put in Writing.


M. Thou say then that the Marks of the Visible Church are the sincere
Preaching of the Gospel, that is to say, of the benefits of Christ, in vocation
and Administration of the Sacraments?


S. These are indeed the chief and the necessary marks of the Visible Church,
such as without the which it cannot be indeed nor rightly be called the Church
of Christ. But yet also in the same Church if it be well ordered, there shall
be seen to be observed a certain order and manner of Governance and such a Mat
18. 15. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 4. 21. and 10. 31. 32. and 14. 26. 40. Phil. 2. 14. 15.
1 The^. 5. 14. 22. 1 These. 3. 12, 13. Col. 2. 5. 1 Timothy 2. 8, 9. etc. and 3. 1,
2. Tit. 2. 2, 3, 4. etc. and 3. 10.
form of Ecclesiastical Discipline, that it shall not be free for any that
abides in that Flock publicly to speak or do any thing wickedly or in heinous
sort without punishment, yea and so, that in that Congregation of men, all
offenses (so far as is possible) be avoided; but this Discipline since long
time past by little and little decaying, as the manners of men be corrupt and
out of right course, specially of the rich and men of power, which will needs
have impunity and liberty to sin and to do wickedly; this grave manner of
looking to them, and of chastisement, can hardly be maintained in Churches: but
in whatsoever Assembly the Word of God, the calling upon him, and his
Sacraments are purely and sincerely retained, it is no doubt that there is also
the Church of Christ.


M. Are not then all they that be in this Visible Church of the number of the
Elect to everlasting life?


S. Many by hypocrisy and counterfeiting of godliness do join themselves to
this fellowship which are nothing less then true members of the Church. But
forasmuch as wheresoever the Word of God is sincerely taught, and his
Sacraments rightly ministered, there are ever some appointed to salvation by
Christ, Isa. 55. 11. Acts 3. 18.
we count all that whole company to be the Church of God, seeing that Christ
also promises that himself will be present with two or three that be gathered
together Matt 18. 20.
in his Name.


M. Why do thou by and by after the Church make mention also of the
Forgiveness of sins?


S. First, Because the Keys wherewith Matt. 16 19. and 18. 18. Luke 24. 47.
Ioh. 20. 23.
heaven is to be opened and shut, that is, that power of binding and loosing,
of reserving, and forgiving sins, which stands in the Ministry of the Word of
God, is by Christ given and committed to the Church, and properly belongs
unto the Church, Secondly, because no man obtains forgiveness of sins that is
not a true member of the body of Christ, that Ioh. 15 4. 6. Col. 2: 19. Matt.
24. 13.
is, such a one as does not earnestly, godly, holily, yea and continually, and
to the end embrace and maintain the common fellowship of the Church.


S. Is there then no hope of salvation out of the Church?


S Out of it can be nothing but damnation, death, and destruction; for what
hope of life can remain to the members, Ioh. 15. 4. 6. Col. 2 19* 1 Timothy 3. 15.
Romans 2: 8, 9. 1 Cor. 1. 11. and 3 3. 1 Timothy 2. 4. 6. 2 Timothy 2. 16. 23. Tit. 3.
9, 10, 11.
when they are pulled a sunder and cut off from the head and body; they
therefore that seditiously stir up Discord in the Church of God, and make
division and strife in it, and trouble it with Sects have all hope of safety by
forgiveness of sins cut off from them, till they be reconciled and returned to
agreement and favor with the Church.


M. What meanest thou by this word Forgiveness?


S. That the faithful do obtain at Gods hand discharge of their fault, and
pardon Psalm. 32 1, 2. Acts 13: 38. and 26. 18. Romans 3. 24. Ephe. 1. 7. Col. 3.
14.
of their offense: for God, for Christ's sake freely forgiveth them their sins,
and rescueth and delivers them from judgment and damnation, and from
punishments just and due for their ill doing.


M. Cannot we then with godly dutiful doings and works satisfy God, and by
our selves merit par^on of our sins.


S. There is no mercy due to our merits, but God does yield and remit to Christ
his correction and punishment that he would have done upon us; for Christ
alone, with sufferance of his pains, and with his death, wherewith he Isa. 53
4, 5. 8 12. R^m. 5 8. 10. Col. 1. 20, 21. 2 Timothy: 1. 10. Heb. 9 14, 15. Romans 3.
24. 25, 27, 28. Gal. 2. 16.
has paid and performed the penalty of our sins, has satisfied God. Therefore
by Christ alone we have access to the grace of God. We receiving this benefit
of his free liberality and goodness, have nothing at all to offer or render
again to him by way of reward or recompense.


M. Is there nothing at all to be done on our behalf, that we may obtain
forgiveness of sins?


S. Although among men the fault once granted, it is hard to obtain forgiveness
of him that ought to be the punisher of offenses, yet even they that are
strangers to our Religion, have not been ignorant, that confession is a certain
remedy to him that has done amiss. And I have already said how sinners for
obtaining pardon have need of repentance, which some like better to call
Resipiscence or Amendment, and change of mind, and the Lord Jer. 18. 8. Ezekiel.
18. 21, 30, 31. 32. and 33. 14. Mat. 4. 17. Luke 5. 32.
promises that He will pardon sinners if they repent, if they amend and turn
their hearts from their naughty lives to him.


M. How many parts be there of Repentance?


S. Two chief parts; the Mortifying of the old Man or the Flesh, and the
quickening of the new MAN or the Spirit.


M. I would have these more largely and plainly set out?


S. The mortifying of the old man, is unfeigned and sincere acknowledging and
confessing of sin, and therewith a shame Psalm. 32. 4, 5. and 51. 3, 4. Prove.
28. 13. 1 Ioh. 1. 8, 9.
and sorrow of mind, with the feeling whereof the person is sore grieved, for
that he has swerved from righteousness and not been obedient to the will of
God, for every man ought, in remembering of the sins of his life passed, wholly
to mislike himself, to be angry with himself, and Psalm 6. 6, 7. and 31. 9, 10.
and 38. 3, 4, 6. 8, 9, 10, 17, 18. and 51. 17. and 102. 4, 5. 1 Cor. 11. 31. 2
Cor. 7. 9, 10, 11.
to be a severe Judge of his his own faults, and to give sentance, and
pronounce judgment of himself, to the intent he abide not the grievous judgment
of God in his wrath. This sorrow some have called contrition, whereunto are
joined in nearness and nature, an earnest hatred of sin, and a love and desire
of righteousness lost.


M. But the conscience of heinous offenses and the force of repentance may be
so great, that the mind of man on each side compassed with fear may be
possessed with despair of salvation.


S. That is true, unless God bring comfort Genesis 4 13. Matt. 27. 3, 4. 2 Cor. 2.
7, 8. Ephc. 4. 23, 24. 1 Pet. 4. 6. Matt. 4. 17. Luke 7. 38. 47, 48, 50. and
15. 18. 21. and 24. 47: Acts 2. 37: and 3, 19. and 16. 30. 31.
to the greatness of sorrow: but to the godly there remains yet one part of
repentance, which is called renewing of the Spirit, or quickening of the new
man, that is, when faith comes and refreshes and lifts up the mind so
troubled, asswageth sorrow, and comfort the person, and does revoke and
raise up him again from desperation to hope of obtaining pardon of God through
Christ, and from the gate of death, yea from hell it self unto life. And this
is it that we profess, that we believe the forgiveness of sins.


M. Is man able in this fear and these hard distresses to deliver himself by
his own strength?


S. Nothing less, for it is only God which strengthens man despairing of his 1 Timothy* 1. 15. Matt. 12. 12. Luke 15. 22. ^ Cor. 1 3, 4. 2 These. 2. 12, 16:
own estate, raises him up in affliction, restores him in utter misery, and
by whose guiding the sinner receives this hope, mind, and will, that I speak
off.


M. Now rehearse the rest of the Creed.


S. I believe the Resurrection of the flesh, and Life everlasting. Matt. 22.
31: 32. Ioh: 11. 25. 2 Cor. 15. toto



M. Because thou have touched somewhat of this before in speaking of the last
Judgment, I will ask thee but a few questions. Wherefore, or why do we believe
these things?


S. Although we believe that the souls of men are immortal and everlasting, yet
if we should think that our bodies should by death be utterly destroyed for
ever, then must we needs be wholly discouraged, 1 Cor. 14: 14. 17, 18, 19.
for that wanting the one part of our selves, we should never entirely possess
perfect joy and immortality; we do therefore certainly believe not only that
our selves, when we depart out of this life, being delivered from the Company
of our bodies, do by and by fly up pure and whole into heaven to Christ: but
Luke 16. 22. and 23. 43: Romans 8. 11. 1 Cor. 15 42, 43, 44. 53, 54. Phil 3: 21.
1 These. 4. 13, 14, 15, 16, 171
also that our bodies shall at length be restored to a better state of life,
and joined again to their souls, and so we shall wholly be made perfectly and
fully blessed, that is to say, we dout not that both in our bodies and souls
we shall enjoy eternity, immortality and most blessed life, that shall never in
everlasting continuance Ioh. 11. 25. 1 Cor. 15. 5, 8. 1 These. 4. 13, 14, 15,
of time be changed. This hope comfort us in misery; endued with this hope,
we not only patiently suffer and bear the incommodities and cumbrances that
light upon us in this life, but also the very departure from life and the
sorrows of death; for we are thoroughly persuaded that death is not a
destruction that ends and consumes all things, but a guide for us to heaven,
that sets us in the way of a quiet, easy, blessed, and everlasting life.
And therefore 2 Cor. 5. ^, 2. Ephe. 2. 19.
gladly and cheerfully we run, yea, we fly out from the bonds of our bodies as
from a Prison, to heaven as to the common Town and City of God and men.


M. Does the beleiving of these things avail us, to any other end?


S. We are put in mind, that we cumber not, nor entangle our selves with
uncertain transitory and frail things, that we bend not our eye to earthly
glory and felicity, but inhabit this world as strangers, and ever minding our
removing Heb. 13. 13, 14 1 Pet. 2. 11.
that we long upward for heaven and heavenly things, where we shall in bliss
enjoy enternal life.


M. Since thou have before said, that the Mat. 25 34. 41 46.
wicked shall rise again in sort far differing from the godly, that is to
say, to eternal misery and everlasting death; why does the Creed make mention
only of life everlasting, and of Hell no mention at all?


S. This is the Confession of the Christian faith, which pertains to none but
to the godly, and therefore rehearses only those things that are fit for Mat.
16. 16. Luke 24. 47. Ioh. 3. 15, 16. Romans 4. 16.
to comfort, namely the most large gifts which God will give to them that be
his; and therefore here is not recited what punishments are provided for them
that be out of the Kingdom of God.


M. Now thou have declared the Creed, that is, the sum of the Christian
Faith, tell me what profit get we of this Faith?


S. Righteousness before God, by which we are made heirs of eternal life. Romans
3. 21, 22. Gal. 2. 16.



M. Does not then our own godliness, toward God, and leading of our life
honestly and holily among men, justify us before God?


S. Of this we have said somewhat already after the declaring of the Law, and
in other places, to this effect; if any man were able to live uprightly
according to the precise rule of the Law of God, Romans 10. 5. Gal 3. 12. Genesis 6.
5. and 8. 11. Romans 7. 14, 15. Gal. 2. 16. Romans 11. 6.
he should worthily be counted justified by his good works. But seeing we are
all most far from that perfection of life, yea and be so oppressed with
conscience of our sins, we must take another course, and find another way how
God may receive us into favor then by our deserving.


M. What way?


S. We must fly to the mercy of God Romans 3. 24. and 4. 4. 7. 16. Ephe. 2. 4,
5. 2 Timothy 1 9. Tit. 3. 4, 5. 1 Pet. 1. 3. and 2: 10.
whereby he freely embraces us with love and good will in Christ without any
of our deserving or respect of works, both forgiving us our sins, and so giving
us the righteousness of Christ by faith in Him, that for the same Christ's
righteousness, he so accepts us, as if it were our own: To Gods mercy
therefore through Christ we ought to impute all our justification.


M. How do we know it to be thus?


S. By the Gospel which contains the Promises of God by Christ, to the which
when we adjoyn faith, that is to Romans 4 3 5. 14. 16. 20, 24. Gal. 2. 16. 20. 3.
11. Heb. 10. 38.
say, an assured persuasion of mind and steadfast confidence of Gods good will,
such as has been set out in the whole Creed, we do, as it were, take state and
possession of this justification that I speak of.


M. Do thou not then say, that faith is the principal cause of justification,
so as by the merit of Faith we are counted righteous before God?


S. No, for that were to set Faith in the place of Christ, but the Springhead
of Ephe. 1. 4, 5, 6. etc. and 2 4, 5. Tit. 3. 4 5. 6.
this justification is the mercy of God, and is offered to us by the Gospel,
and received Mar: 1: 14, 15. Rom 4. 16. 19 20: 21, 24: Ioh. 12. Romans 3. 22. 1
Cor. 1. 30. Heb: 9. 14:
of us by faith, as with a hand.


M. Thou say then that faith is not the cause but the instrument of
just^fication, for that it embraces Christ which is our Justification coupling
us with so straight bond to him, that it makes us partakers of all his good
things.


S. Yea truly.


M. But can this Justification be severed from good works, that he that has it
can want them?


S. No, for by faith we receive Christ, such as he delivers himself unto us;
but he does not only set us at liberty from sins and death, and make us at one
with God, but also with the divine inspiration and virtue of the Holy Ghost,
Romans 8. 1. and 9. 10. 12, 13.
does regenerate and newly form us to the endeavor of innocence and holiness,
which we call newness of life.


M. Thou say then that Justice, Faith, and good Works do naturally cleave
together, Romans 6. 4. Romans 5: 1, 2. 1 Cor. 1. 2. 3 Ephe. 3. 17. 1 Pet. 1. 19.
20, 21, 22.
and therefore ought no more to he severed then Christ the Author of them in us
can be severed from himself?


S. It is true.


M: Then this Doctrine of says does not withdraw men's minds from godly works
and duties.


S. Nothing less, for good Works do stand upon faith as upon their root, so
Psalm. 1. 3. Romans 11. 16. Ephe. 3. 17. Col. 2. 6, 7. Tit. 3. 8.
far therefore is faith from withdrawing our hearts from living uprightly,
that contrariwise it does most vehemently stir us up to the endeavor of good
life; yea, and so far that he is not truly faithful that does not also to his
power, both shun vices and embrace virtues, so living Romans 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.
always as one that looks to give an account.


M. Therefore tell me plainly, how our works be acceptable to God, and what
rewards be given to them?


S. In good works two things are principally Deuteronomy. 4. 1, 2. and 12. 32. Mar. 7.
6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 17, 19. Joh. 15. 10. Rom 9 31, 32. and 14. 23. Heb. 11. 6.
required. First, that we do those works that are prescribed by the Law of God.
Secondly, that they be done with that mind and faith which God requires, for
no doings or thoughts enterprised or conceived without faith can please God.


M. Go forward.


S. It is evident therefore that all Joh. 3. 3, 4, 5, 6. Romans 9. 31, 32* Ephe.
2. 3: Pet. 1. 22, 23:
works whatsoever we do before that we be born again, and renewed by the Spirit
of God, such as may properly be called our own works, are faulty, for
whatsoever show of gayness and worthiness they represent and give to the eyes
of men, since they spring and proceed from a faulty and corrupted heart which
God chiefly considers, they cannot but be Rom 8. 5. 6, 7. 1 Cor. 1. 19, ^0
and 3 19. 2 Cor. 1. 12.
defiled and corrupted, and so grievously offend God; such works therefore as
evil fruits growing out of an evil tree, God despises and rejects from him.


M. Can we not therefore prevent God with any works or deservings, whereby we
may Mat. 7. 18, 19. and 12 33, 35.
first provoke him to l^ve us, and be good unto us?


S. Surely with none, for God loved Romans 5. 8, 10. and 11. 35.
and chose us in Christ, not only when we were his enemies, that is, sinners,
but also before the foundations of the world were laid; and this is the same
Spring head and Original of our Justification, whereof 1 Ioh. 4. 9, 10, 19.
Ephe. 1. 4.
I speak before.


M. What think thou of those work^ which we, after that we be reconciled to
Gods favor, do by the instinct of the Holy Ghost?


S. The dutiful works of godliness, Rom 12. ^. Gal. 5* 6.
which proceed of faith working by charity, are indeed acceptable to God, yet
not by their own deserving, but for that Luke 17. 10. and 18. 11, 12. 14.
he of his liberality vouchsafes them his favor, for though they be derived
from the Spirit of God, as little streams from the Springhead, yet of our
flesh, that mingleth it self with them indoing by the way they receive
corruption, as it were by infection, like a river otherwise pure and Isa. 64 6.
Romans 7. 14. 17. Gal ^. 17.
clear is troubled and mudded with mire and slime where through it runs.


M How then do thou say that they please God?


S. It is faith that procures Gods favor Romans 9. 31. 32. Gal 5 6. Heb. 11. 6.
Psalm. 130. 3. and 143 2.
to our works, while it is assured that he will not deal with us after
extremity of Law, nor call our doings to exact account, nor try them as it
were, with the Square, that is He will not in valuing and weighing them use
severity, but remitting and pardoning all their corruptness for Christ's sake
and his deservings, account them for fully perfect.


M. Then thou stand still in this, that we cannot by merit of Works obtain
to be justifi^d before God, seeing thou think that all doings of men, even
the perfectest do need pardon?


S. God himself has so decreed in his Word and his holy Spirit does teach us
Luke 18. 11. 12, 14. Romans 4. 2. Gal. 2 16. Romans 2. 20. Psalm. 143. 2. Job* 4.
18. and 15. 14, 15, 16. and 25. 4, 5, 6. Psalm: 130. 3. Isa 64. 6. 1 Cor. 4. 4.
to pray that he bring us not into Judgment, for where righteousness, such as
God the Judge shall allow ought to be thoroughly absolute, and in all parts and
points fully perfect, such as is to be directed and tried by the most precise
Rule, and as it were by the plain line of Gods Law and Judgment; and since our
works, even the best of them, for that they swarve and differ most far from
the Rule and Prescription of Gods Law and Justice are many ways to be blamed
and condemned, we can in no wise be justified before God by works.


M. Does not this Doctrine withdraw men's minds from the duties of godliness and
make them slacker and slower to good works, or at least, less cheerful and
ready to godly endeavors?


S. No, for we may not therefore say that good works are unprofitable or done
in vain and without cause, for that we obtain not Justification by them, for
they serve both to the profit of our neighbor, and to the glory of God, and
they Mat. 5 16. 1 Pet. 2. 12. Mat. 12, 33. Phil. 2. 12. 1 Pet. 1. 10.
do as by certain testimony, assure us of Gods good will toward us, and of
our love again to Godward, and of our faith, and so consequently of our
salvation, and reason it is, that we being redeemed with the blood of Christ
the Son of God, and having beside innumerable and infinite benefits of God,
should live and wholly frame our selves after the will and appointment Romans 14
7, 8. 1 Cor. 6. 20: 2 Cor. 5: 15 1 These. 5. 10. Mat. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 12.
of our Redeemer, and so show our selves mindful and thankful to the Author of
our salvation, and by our example procure and win others unto him. The man that
calls those thoughts to mind may sufficiently rejoice in his good endeavors
and works.


M. But God does allure us to good doing with certain rewards, both in this
life and in the life to come, and does Covenant with us, as it were for
certain wages.


S. That reward, as I have said, is not Mat 5. 12. and 10. 41, 42. and 25, 34,
35. Ephe. 3. ^0. 2 Timothy 1. 9.
given to works for their worthiness, and rendered to them as recompense for
deservings, but by the bountifulness of God, is freely bestowed upon us without
deserving; and Justification God does give us as a gift of his own dear love
toward us and of his liberality through Christ. When I speak of Gods gift and
Romans 3. 24. 1 Cot. 1. Romans 3. 24. and 11. 6. Gal. 5 4. 2 Timothy 1. 9. Tit. 3 4 5.
liberality, I mean it free and bountiful without any of our desert or merit;
that it be Gods mere and sincere liberality, which he applies to our
salvation only whom he loves and which trust in him, not hired or procured for
wages, as it were merchandise of his commodities and benefits used by him for
some p^ofit to himself, requiring again of us some recompense or price, which
once to think, were to abate both the liberality and Majesty of God.


M. Whereas then God does by Faith both give us Justification, and by the same
Faith allows and accepts our works; tell me, do thou think that this
faith is a quality of Nature, or the gift of God? Mar. 9. 23, 24. Joh. 9. 29 1
Pet. 20, 21. Mat 16. 7, 8, 9, 11. Luke 18 34.



S. Faith is the gift of God, and a singular and excellent gift, for both our
wits are too gross and dull to conceive and understand the Wisdom of God,
whose Romans 8. 6, 7. 1 Cor. 2. 14. Mat. 6. 30. and 8. 20. and 16. 8. and 14. 31.
Mat. 16. 17. Luke 24. 45. Col. 1. 9. 2 Timothy 2. 7.
Fountains are opened by faith, and our hearts are more apt either to
distrust, or to wrongful and corrupt trust in our selves, or other creatures,
then to the true entrust in God; but God instructing us with his Word, and
lightning our minds with his holy Spirit, makes us apt to learn those things
that otherwise would be far from entering into the dull capacity of our wits,
and sealing the Promises of salvation in our souls, he so informs us that we
are most surely persuaded of them; these things the Apostles Luke 17. 5.
understanding, do pray to the Lord to increase their faith.


The third PART. Of Prayer and Thanksgiving.
M. THou have in good time made mention of Prayer, for now thou have ended the
Declaration of the Law of God, and the Creed, that is to say, the Christian
Confession, it follows next to speak of Prayer and of Thanksgiving, which is
nearly conjoined to it; for these are in order knit and fitly hanging together
with the rest.


S. They be indeed most nea^ly joined, for they belong to the first Table of
Gods Psalm. 50. 15. 23. Acts 9. 21. Romans 10 12. and 15: 6. 2 Cor. 1. 2, 4. 2 Timothy 2 22. 1 P^t. 1. 17. The order of teaching for Prayer.
Law, and do contain the principal duties of Godliness toward God.


M. In declaring of Prayer what order shall we follow?


S. This order Master, if it so please you; First, to show who is to be prayed
unto. Secondly, with what affiance. Thirdly, with what affection o^ heart, and
Fourthly, what is to be prayed for.


M. Tell me then first who thou think is to be called upon?


S. Surely none, but God alone.


M. Why so?


S. Because our life and salvation stands Psalm. 17. 7, 8. and 26. 1. and ^8.
8 and 78 and 104. the whole.
in the hand of God alone, in whose power are all things. Since then God does
give us all that is good, and that a Christian man ought to wish and desire;
and since he alone is able in every danger to Psalm. 18. 1. etc 26, 27, 28. etc
and 91. 1, 2. etc. Psalm 50. 15. 23. and 81. 7. and 89 26, 27.
give help and succor, and to drive away all perils: it is meet that of him we
ask all things, and in all distresses flee to him alone and crave his help;
for this he himself in his Word asks and requires as the peculiar and
propper worshipping of his Majesty.


M. Shall we not then do wcll to call upon holy men that are departed out of
this life, or upon Angels.


S. No, for that were to give to them an infinitness to be every where present,
or to give them being absent an understanding of our secret meanings, that is,
as much as a certain Godhead, and there withal partly to convey to them our
confidence and trust that ought to be set Psalm. 1. 2. and 15. 1, 2. and 118. 8,
9. Psalm. 50. 15. and 89. 26, 27.
wholly in God alone, and so to slide into Idolatry. But for as much as God
calls us to himself alone, and does also with adding an Oath, Promise, that
he will both hear and he^p us; to flee to the help of other were an evident
token of distrust and infidelity. And as touching the holy men that are
departed out of this life, what manner of thing, I pray you, were this,
forsaking the living God, that hears Psalm. 102. 21, 23, 24. Psalm. 50. 15.
Ephe. 3: ^0. Mat. 11* 28. Ioh. 16. 23, 24.
our prayers, that is most mighty, most ready to help us that calls us unto
him, that in the Word of Truth promises and swears, that with his Divine
Power and Succor, he will defend us, forsaking him, I say, to fly to men
dead, deaf and weak, which neither have promised help, nor are able to
relieve us, to whom God never gave the Office to help us, to whom we are by no
Scriptures directed where upon our faith may Romans 10. 8. 14, 17.
surely rest, but are unadvisedly carried away trusting only upon the dreams,
or dotages of our own head:


M. But God to our salvation uses the service of Angels that wait upon us, and
therefore do hear us.


S. That is true. But yet it appears Psalm. 91. 11. 12. Heb 1. 14. Romans 10.
17. Romans 14. 23.
no where in the Word of God, that God would have us pray to Angels or to godly
men deceased. And since Faith rests upon the Word of God, and what is not of
Faith is sin; I said rightly that it is a sure token of infidelity to forsake
God, to whom alone the Scriptures do send us, Mat. 6. 6. 9.
and to pray to crave help of Angels, or godly men departed this life, for
calling upon whom there is not one Word in the holy Scriptures.


M. But seeing Charity never falls out of 1 Cor. 13. 8.
the hearts of the godly, even while they be in heaven they are careful for us,
and do desire our salvation.


S. That cannot be denied, yet it does not follow that we must therefore call
upon them, unless we think that we must call for the help and succor of our
friends, be they never so far from us, only because they bear us good will.


M. But we often to crave help of men that be al^ve, and with whom we are
presently conversant.


S. I grant it; for men as they have mutually need one of another help, so
has God granted them power one mutually to help an other; yea and he has
expressly commanded every man to relieve his 1 Cor. 12. 11* 21. 25. 1 Pet. 4.
10. Mat. 7. 16. 1 Cor. 10. 24. Gal. 6. 2.
neighbor with such help as he can. We do therefore call upon men as Ministers
of Gods goodness, according to the Will of God looking for help and succor of
them; but yet so, that all our trust be settled in God alone, and that we reckon
received from him as the Spring head of all liberality, whatsoever is delivered
us by the hands of men. Therefore this is well and orderly done, and no
impediment 1 Pet. 1. 10.
to the calling upon God alone, so that we confess that we do not from
elsewhere look for any good thing, nor settle our whole succor in any other.


M. Do thou then say that ^e must use Prayer and Supplication, like as all
other duties of godliness, according to the prescription of Gods Word or else
we cannot please God?


S. Yea verily, for all offense in Religion is committed by changing the order
Deuteronomy. 4. 1, 2. and 5. 32. 33.
and manner appointed by God.


M. Hitherto then thou have said that God alone is to be called upon, putting
all our trust in him, and that to him all things, as the Springhead of all good
things are to be imputed; now follows next to declare with what confidence we
wretched mortal men, that are so many ways unworthy, ought to call upon the
immortal God?


S. We are indeed every way most unworthy, but we thrust not our selves in
proudly and arrogantly, as if we were worthy, but wecome ohim in the name and
upon trust of Christ our Mediator, by Ioh. 14. 2 3: 13. 16. 23. Ephe. 2. 18. 1 Timothy 2. 5. Heb: 4. 16. and 10. 19. 20, 21.
whom the door being opened to us, though we be most silly wretches made of
clay and slime oppressed with conscience of our own sins, we shall not be
forbidden to enter, nor shall not have hard access to the Majesty of God, and
to the obtaining of his favor.


M. We need not then for access to God some man to be our mean or Interpreter,
to commend or declare ^ur suit unto him, as it were unto some wordly Prince?


S. Nothing less, unless we think that God is as men be, bound to one place,
that Psalm. 33. 14. 13. and 94. 7. 9, 10 11.
he cannot understand many things but by his servants, that he sometime
sleeps, or has not leisure to hear, for as touching our unworthiness, we
have already said that our Prayers stand in confidence not upon any thing in
us, but upon the only worthiness of Christ in whose Name Ioh. 15. 16. and 16.
23, 24, 25, 26.
we pray.


M. Do thou then think that God the Father is to be called upon in the Name,
and upon trust of Christ alone?


S. Yea truly Sir, for he alone above all Joh. 15. 9, 11: Romans 8. 17. 18, 19.
other, most singularly loves us, so far that he will do althings for our
sakes, he alone is with God his Father, at whose right hand he sits in most
high favor Ephe 5. 2. 25. Mat. 3. 17. Romans 8. 34.
that he may obtain what he will of him; he therefore alone is the Mediator of
Redemption, and also of Invocation, in whose Name alone the holy Scriptures do
expressly Ioh: 14. 13. and 16. 23. and 26.
bid us go unto God the Father, adding also Promises, that he by his
intercession will bring to pass that we shall obtain all that we pray for,
otherwise without Christ the Ear and the Heart Ioh. 15. 5. Ephe. 2. 12, 13. 1
These* 1. 2. Col. 4 2, 3. Ephe. 6. 18, 19.
of God abhors men.


M. But we do yet with mutual prayers one help another ^o long as we are in
this world.


S. That is true, but ^e do not therefore set other mediators in place of
Christ but with conjoined hearts and prayers, according to the rule of Charity
and the Word of God, we do by one Mediator 1 Timothy 1 5: Heb. 9. 15.
call upon our common father.


M. Thou say then that to appoint other Mediators to God, or Patrons for our
cause, but Christ alone, is both against the holy Scriptures, and therefore
against Faith, and also contains great injury to Christ himself:


S. Yea truly Sir.


M. Go on then.


S. The sum is this, that we must come to call upon God the Father, resting
upon affiance of the Promises made to us by Christ, and trusting upon his
intercession Romans 1. 2, 5. and 4 21, 24. 2 Cor. 1. 20. 3. 4, 5. Gal. 3. 22.
Tit. 1 2. Joh 14 15, 26. and 15. 16. 21. and 16. 23, 24, 26. Psalm. 29 1, 2.
Acts 1. 12. 16.
having all respect of our own worthiness, and framing our prayers, as it were
out of the mouth of Christ; which doing, as it is most agreeable to the truth of
the Scriptures, so it is most far from the fault of arrogance and presumption.


M. Think thou that they which so pray to God, as thou say, ought to have
a good hope to obtain what they ask?


S. The Lord himself does also command Mat. 21. 21. Mar. 11. 22, 23, 24. Joh.
16: 23. Man. 7. 10. Heb. 4 16. and 10. 22. 1 John 5 14.
us to ask with sure faith, making therewith a Promise, and adding an Oath,
that it shall be given us whatsoever we ask with Faith; and likewise his
Apostles do teach that right Prayer proceeds from Faith. Therefore we must
always lay this assured foundation of Prayer, that resting upon sure trust of
his fatherly goodness, we must determine that God will hear our Prayers and
Petitions, and that we shall obtain so far as it is expedient for us.
Therefore they that come rashly and Mat. 10. 22: and 21. 21. Ioh. 16. 24.
unconsiderately to Prayer, and such as Pray doubting, and uncertain of their
speeding, they do without fruit pour out vain and bootless words.


M. I see with what confidence thou say we must ca^l upon God. Now tell me
with what affection of heart we must come unto him.


S. Our hearts must be sore grieved Psalm. 50. 15. and 94: 7. and. 1^4. 1, 2.
and 127. Romans 18: and 8. 25. 2 Cor. 3 4, 5.
with feeling of our need and poverty, and the miseries that oppress us so far
forth that we must burn with great desire of deliverance from that grief, and
of Gods help which we pray for. Being thus disposed in heart it cannot be but
that we must attentively, and with most fervent Luke 18. 5. 7. Rom 1^. 12. Ephe
6. 18. Col. 4. 2. 1 Timothy 2. 1.
affection, with all manner of Prayers and Petitions crave that we desire.


M. I see then it is not enough to pray with tongue and voice alone.


S. To pray, not applying thereunto our mind and attentiveness without which
our prayers can never be effectual 1 Cor. 14. 14. 15.
is not only to take fruitless labor in vain. (For how shall God hear us,
when we heed not nor hear not our selves) 1 Cor. 14. 15.
and not only to pour out vain and fruitless, but also hurtful words with
offending Gods Majesty. So far off is it, that Psalm. 109. 7.
such prayers can appease the Majesty of God, that is displeased with our
offense.


M. How know we that it is thus?


S. Since God is a Spirit, and (as I may Joh. 4. 23, 24. 1 Cor. 3. 17.
so call him) a most pure mind; he both in all other things, and specially in
Prayer, whereby men, as it were talk and cummune with God, requires the soul
and mind. And he also testifies that he will be near only to them that call
upon him truly; that is, with their heart, and Psalm. 145. 18, 19.
that their prayers please him. On the other side God does worthily abhor and
detest prayers that fainedly and unadvisedly Isa. 29. 12, 13. Mat. 15. 8. and
20. 22. Jer. 48. 10.
utter with their tongue that which they conceive not with their heart and
thought, and deal more negligently with immortal God, then they are wont to do
with a mortal man. Therefore in Prayer the mind is always needful, but the
tongue is not always necessary.


M. But there is some use of the tongue in Prayer?


S. Yea verily, for meet it is that the Psalm. 35: 28. and 51. 14, 15, and 71.
21, 22, 23. Romans 14. 11. Phil. 2. 11.
tongue do also diligently and earnestly employ all her strength and ability to
set forth the honor of God, since it is above all other parts of the body
properly created by God to that use. Moreover, as from a mind earnestly bent
with study and care, sometime words break out of us ere we be aware; so
oftentimes the very sound of utterance and hearing of our own words, quickneth
and sharpneth our mind and helps away slackness wherewith the heart is
continually tempted.


M. Since it is so, What think thou of them that pray in a strange tongue,
and such as they understand not?


S. I think that they do not only loose their labor, but therewith also mock
God himself; for if loqui, to speak be wittingly to bestow each word in his
right place, they that utter words which they 1 Cor. 14. 7. 9. 11.
understand not, chatter rather then speak, so far be they from praying, for
they play the Parrats rather then men, much less Christian men. Therefore far
be it from godly men, such hypocrisy and mockery; for if St. Paul think it
absurdity 1 Cor. 14, 12.
for a man to speak to another that speech which they understand not, because
words move no man but him that has the same language, and affirms that both
he that speaks and he that hears, shall either of them be an Alien to the
other, how much greater absurdity is it, that we our selves be Aliens to our
selves, while we use that speech that we know not, and go about to utter our
meanings and prayers in that tongue wherein our selves are deaf. Wise men in
old Time thought that such men as were most fond, were most worthy to be
laughed at.


M. I see how heedfull a mind and fervent affection is required in prayer. But
tell me, do thou think thy. ferventness to be natural and by kind planted in
our hearts, or that it is a raising up of our minds by God?


S. The holy Scriptures do testify that Romans 8. 20. Ephe. 2. 18.
the Spirit of God raises up unspeakable groanings whereby our prayers are
made effectual. He therefore without doubt with his inspiration stirs up our
minds, and whetteth and helps us to pray.


M. How then? When this ferventness of mind that cannot always be present, is
slacked or wholly quenched, shall we, as it were drousie with sloth and
sleeping, idly look for the stirring and moving of the Spirit?


S. Nothing less. But rather when we be faint and slack in mind we must by
Psalm. 51. 17: Mat: 26. 40, 41.
and by crave the help of God, that he will give us cherefulness, and stir up
our hearts to Prayer; for this mind and will we conceive by the guiding of God.


M. Now remains that I hear of thee what we ought to ask of God by Prayer.
Is it lawful to ask of God whatsoever comes in our mind and mouth?


S. When men that were strangers to true godliness had such an honest opinion
of the Majesty and mind of their Gods, that they thought that they ought not
to ask of them any thing that is unjust or unhonest: God forbid, that we
Christians should ever ask any thing of God in Mat. 7. 11. Ioh. 16. 23. 24. 1
Ioh. 5. 14.
Prayer that may mislike the Mind and Will of God, for this were to do to Gods
Majesty most high injury and dishonor, so much less may a Prayer please him,
or obtain any thing of him; and since both the wits of men are too dull to
understand Mat. 20. 22. Romans 8. 26. 27.
what is expedient for them, and the desires of their hearts are so blind, and
will be, that they not only need a Guide whom they may follow, but also bridles
to restrain them, it were too great an absurdity that we should in Prayer be
carried rashly and headlong by our own affections, by a certain Rule therefore
and prescribed Form our Prayers ought wholly to be directed.


M. What Rule and Form?


S. Even the same form of Prayer verily which the heavenly Schoolmaster Mat.
6. 9. 10. Luke 11. 1, 2. etc.
appointed to his Disciples, and by them to us all, wherein he has couched in
very few Points all those things that are lawful to be asked of God, and
behoveful for us to obtain; which prayer is after the Author, and therefore
called The Lords Prayer. If therefore we will follow the heavenly Teacher, with
his Divine Voice, saying before us, truly we shall never swerve from the right
Rule of Praying.


M. Rehearse me then the LORDS Prayer.


S. When ye will pray (Says the Lord) Mat, 6. 9 etc. Luke 11* 1, 2. etc.
Say thus: Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom
come, thy Will be done in earth as it is in heaven, give us this day our daily
bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against
us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the
Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever Amen.


M. But do thou think that we are bound ever so to render these very words,
that it is not lawful in one word to vary from them?


S. It is no doubt that we may use other words in praying, so that we swerve
not from the meaning of this Prayer, for in it the Lord has set out certain
special, and principal Points to the which unless our Prayers be referred they
cannot please God; yea, let every man ask of God as the present time and his
need Psalm. 107 5. and 12. 18. etc.
shall require, and let him tarry upon which part of this Prayer he will, and
so long as he list, and dilate it into sundry sorts as he will; for there is no
impediment to the contrary, so that we pray to God with such affiance, and
affection, as I have before spoken off, and to the same meaning that is set out
in this Prayer.


M. How many parts has the Lords Prayer?


S. It contains indeed six Petitions, The Division.
but in the whole sum there are but two parts, whereof the first belongs
only to the glory of God, and contains the three former Petitions; the second
which contains the three latter Petitions belongs properly to our commodity.


M. Do thou sever and divide our profits from Gods glory, that thou make
equal Partition between them?


S. I do not sever things conjoined but for plainness of the whole declaration,
I distinguish things to be severally discerned for understanding, whereunto
each thing belongs otherwise, those things that do properly belong to the The
end of all things Gods Glory.
glory of God do also bring most great profits to us: and likewise those things
that serve our profit, are all referred to the glory of God, for this ought to
be the 1 Cor. 10. 30 31. Col. 3. 17.
end whereunto all things must be applied, this ought to be our mark, that
Gods glory be most amply enlarged; yet in the mean time I think that this
division in parts shall not be inconvenient, and is made not without reason,
but according to the property of the things themselves, because while we ask
those things that belong properly to the advancing of Gods glory, we must for
that time omit our own profits when yet in the later Petitions we may intend
our own commodities.


M. Now let us somewhat diligently examine the weight of every word, why do
thou call G^d Father?


S. There is great pith in the use of this one name Father, for it contains
two things, which we have before said to be specially necessary in praying.


M. What be those?


S. First, I speak not as to one absent or Psalm. 33. 13, 14. and 34 15. 17: and
94. 9. 10 11. and 139. 1, 2. etc.
deaf, but I call upon, and pray to God as one that is present and hears me,
being surely persuaded, that he hears me when I pray, for else in vain should
I crave his help. And this surely without all douting I cannot so affirm of
any Isa. 63. 16.
Angel or any man deceased. Secondly, we have before said, that sure trust of
obtaining is the foundation of right praying. And dear is the Name of Father,
and of Fatherly love, and most full of good hope and confidence. It was Gods
Will therefore to be called by the sweetest name in earth, by that mean
alluring Psalm. 103* 13. Luke 13. 18.
us to himself, that we should without fear come to him, taking away all fear
of his Fatherly heart and good will, for when we determine that he is R^m. 8.
15. Gal. 4. 6.
our Father then being encouraged with his Spirit, we go to him, as children
use to go to their Father. God therefore in this place likes better to be
called Father by name of dear affection and Mal. 1. 6.
love then King or Lord by terms of Dignity and Majesty, and so therewithal to
leave to us as to his children Ioh. 1. 12. Romans 8. 15 17. Gal 4. 6, 7.
a most rich Inheritance of his Fatherly Name.


M Shall we then come to God with such sure trust of obtaining as children use
to come to their Parents.


S. That far more sure and steadfast is the trust of the good Will of God then
of men, Christ the natural Mat. 11. ^7. Ioh 1 18 and 10. 13.
Son of God best acquainted with his Fathers mind, does assure us, saying, If
ye (says he) being ^vil suffer not your children to crave in vain, but Mat. 7.
11. Luke 11. 13.
grant them their requests, how much more shall your heaven F^therly, who is
self goodness and liberality be bountiful to you; but CHRIST as is aforesaid,
brings Romans 5. 1, 2. Gal. 4. 4* 5, 6. Ephe. 2. 4, 5. 1 Ioh. 2. 1.
us all this confidence, for God does not adopt, or acknowledge us to be his
children, who by nature are the children of wrath, but by Christ.


M. What else does the name of Father teach us?


S. That we come to prayer with that love, reverence, and obedience, which is
due to the heavenly Father Mal. 1. 6. Mat. 26. 39. 48.
from his children, and that we have such mind as becomes the children of God.


S. Why do thou call God our Father in common, rather then severally thine
own Father?


S. Every godly man may, I grant, Psalm. 22. 1, 2. Romans 1. 8. 1 Cor. 1. 4.
lawfully call God his own, but such ought to be the community and fellowship
of Christian men together, and such dear love and good will ought every one to
bear to all, that no one of them neglecting the rest, care for himself alone,
but have regard to the Public profit of all; and there in all this prayer
nothing is privately asked, but all the Petitions are made in the common name
of all. Moreover, when they that be of smallest wealth, and basest state do
call upon their common heavenly Father, as well Mal. 2. 10. Ioh. 8. 41. 1 Cor.
8. 6. Ephe. 4 5, 6.
as the wealthy, and such as have attained degrees of highest dignity, we are
taught not to disdain them to be our brethren that are accepted with God to
the honor of his children. On the other side the most despised, Deuteronomy. 18. 17.
Psalm. ^0 18. and 68 ^, 6. and 146. 6, 7. etc.
and they that in this world are vilest may yet in the mean time ease and
relieve themselves with this comfort, that in heaven they have all one most
mighty, and most loving Father. Furthermore, Psalm. 13. 5, 5, 7. and 25. 1, 2:
etc. and 37. 25, 26. etc. Romans 1. 18. and 2. 6, 7, 8.
we that trust in God, do rightly confess him to be our Father. For the wicked
and unbelieving, howsoever they dread Gods Power, yet can they not have trust
in his Fatherly goodness toward them.


M. Why do thou say that God is in heaven?


S. As heaven with round and endless circuit contains all things, compasses
the earth, hemmeth in the seas; neither is there any thing or place that is not
environed and enclosed with the roomthiness of heaven, and it is on every side
wide and open, and always so present to all things, that all things universally
are placed, as it were in sight thereof; so we thereby understand that God
possessing the Tower of heaven, therewith also holds the Governance Psalm 11.
4, 5. and 10. 6. and 33. 13 and 113. 4, 5, 6. and 115. 3.
of all things, is each where present, sees, hears, and rules all things.


M: Go forward.


S. God is also therefore said to be in heaven, because that same highest and
heavenly Region does most royally Psalm. 8. 3. and 19. 1.
shine, and is garnished with his Divine and excellent works. Moreover Psalm. 8.
1, 2, 3, 4. and 11. 4, 5.
by God reigning in heaven, is declared that he is in eternal and highest
felicity, while we as yet in earth expulsed from our Country like children
disherited from their fathers goods, live miserably and wretchedly in
banishment. It is as much therefore to say that God is in heaven, as if I
should Psalm. 50. 3, 4, 9. and 57. 5. 10, 11. and 68. 32, 33. and 113. 4, 5.
say, incomprehensible, most high, most mighty, most blessed, most good, most
great.


M. What profit akest thou of these things?


S. These things do pull out of our hearts base and corrupt Opinions concerning
God, and do instruct our minds to conceive a far other thinking of our heavenly
Father, then we use to Psa. 50 4. 6. and 20. 5, 6, 7. Mat. 23. 2.
have of earthly parents, to use most great reverence toward his holy Majesty,
and in worshipping manner to look up to it, and have it in admiration, and
certainly to believe that he does hearken and hear our prayers, Psalm. 20. 6.
and 10. 15, 17. and 113, 4, 5.
and desires, to put our whole trust in him, that is both Governor and Keeper
of heaven and earth, and therewith also we are by these words admonished not to
ask any thing unmeet for God; but as for speaking to our heavenly Father to
have our hearts raised from earth, high and looking upward, Col. 3. 1.
despising earthly things, thinking upon things above and heavenly, and
continually to aspire to that most blessed felicity of our Father, and to
heaven as our Inheritance by our Father. Romans 8. 17. Ephe. 1. 14, 12. Heb. 9.
15. 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4.



M. This then so happy a beginning and entry of Prayer being now opened unto
us, go to, rehearse me the first Petition.


S. First, we pray that Gods Name be hallowed.


M. What means that?


S. Nothing else, but that his Glory Psalm. 89. 5, 6. etc. Romans 11. 36. and 16.
27. 1 Cor. 10 33.
be every where magnified.


M. Why do we ask this first?


S. Because it is most meet that the children should principally desire and
wish the glory of their Father, the servants Mal. 1. 6.
of their Master, and the creatures of the Creator, to be increased.


M. Can Gods Glory be any thing increased or decreased?


S. The glory of God, for as much as it is continually most ample, cannot indeed
in it self be made either greater by increase, or lesser by decrease; for it
Psalm. 56 5. 9. 11. and 104. 31.
is not changed with any addition or diminishing as our earthly things be; but
our prayer is, that the Name of God be made renowned and known to Psalm. 96. 1.
3.
mortal men, and his praise and glory be celebrated here in earth, as it is
meet to be. And as the infinite Power, Wisdom, Righteousness and goodness of
God, and all his Divine works do truly set forth the Glory and Majesty of God,
so we wish that they may appear noble and glorious to us, that the Psalm. 113.
2, 3. etc. and 114. 1. and and 105. toto. Romans 11 36.
magnificence of the Author of them, as it is in it self most large, so it may
also in all sorts shine honorable and excellent among us, and be both privately
and publicly praised and honored.


M. Go forward.


S. Moreover we pray that the holy Isa. 52. 5, 6. Eze. 36. 20. Romans 8 24.
Name of God be not evil spoken off for our faults, and as it were dishonored
thereby, but rather that his glory be by our godliness toward God and goodness
toward men every where magnified. Finally, we wish that the names of all other
that in heaven, earth, sea, or elsewhere have attained the names Ios 14 23.
Psalm. 96 4. and 97. 7 9 and 115. 3. 4. etc. and 135. 15. Rom 1. 25. 1 Ioh. 5.
21.
and honors of gods and be worshipped in Temples in sundry Forms, and with
sundry Ceremonies, or to whom men filled with Error and false fond Opinions,
have dedicated their hearts as it were Churches; the names (I say) of all those
imagined and fained gods once utterly destroyed, and drowned, and defaced with
eternal forgetfulness; the only Divine Name and Majesty of God the heavenly
Father be great and glorious, and that all men in all Countries may acknowledge
it honorably and holily worship, and reverence it, and with pure desires and
hearts pray to it, call upon it, and crave help of it.


M. Thou have said well, I pray thee go forward.


S. Secondly, We pray that Gods Kingdom come, that is, that he suffer Mat. 4
23. and 9. 35. Mar. 1. 14. Ioh. 8. 31, 32.
not the Divine Truth of his Word, which also Christ calls the Gospel of the
Kingdom, to lie hidden in darkness, but that he daily more and more bring it
abroad, and with his succor maintain and defend it against the devises, craft
and policy of Satan, and of wicked men, and against their Mat. 13. 25. 38, 39.
and 15. 3. 3. 6. Luke 16. 8. Ioh. 3. 19, 20. Luke 10. 3. and 20. 12. etc. 17,
18. Ioh. 16. 2, 3. and 17. 14, 15.
fained treasons that labor to darken the truth, and to defame it, or spot it
with lies, and against the violence and cruelty of Tyrants, that travel by all
means to extinguish and oppress the truth, and utterly to root it up so as it
may be made manifest and well known to all men that there is nothing able to
resist the invincible strength of Gods Truth.


M. Say on more of the Kingdom of God.


S. We pray him to bring very many out of darkness into the light, instructed
with the Doctrine of his holy Mar. 1. 14, 15. Luke 4. 18, 19. Ioh. 17, 17, 19,
20, 21. 1 Pet. 2. 9. 10.
Word, and led by Truth, and that winning them to his number and holy Company,
that is to say, his Church in the which he reigns specially he will
continually govern them with his Spirit, Joh. 16. 13.
and strengthen them with his Aid, as his soldiers, always earnestly fighting
with their enemies, the bond of sin Luke 22. 31, 32 Ephe. 6. 10, 11, 17, 18. 1
Pet. 5. 8. 9. Romans 6. 11, 12. and 8 1, 5. etc. 10, 12. etc.
and the army of Satan, that having strength and stedfastness by his Divine
Power, restraining corrupt and crooked affections, subduing and taming lusts,
conquering, vanquishing, and putting to flight, and chasing away all vices,
they may increase, and enlarge the heavenly Commonweal and Kingdom. God in
the mean time Reigning and Ruling imperially in their hearts by his Spirit.


M. That we see daily done. Romans 8 9, 10, 11. 1 Ioh. 3. 24. and 4. 13. Ps 34,
15, 16. and 37. 9, 10. etc and 58. 5, 6. 9, 10.



S. These things are indeed daily done, so as we sufficiently perceive that God
has an eye both to the godly and to the wicked, and so as the Kingdom Mat.
13. 38. 41. and 22* 6, 7. 13. Luke 19. 14, 27. and 12. 45, 46. and 20. 16. Mat.
25. 41. Rom 11 20. 1 Cor. 15. 24, 25, 26* etc. 54, 55, 56, 57.
of God may seem to be fair begun in this world; yet we pray that with
continual increasing, it may grow so far, that all the reprobate that by the
motion of Satan stubbornly and obstinately resist and strive against Gods
Truth, and defiling themselves with all vices and heinous sins, refuse to
submit themselves to the Kingdom and Dominion of Almighty God, being once
subdued and destroyed, and the tyranny of Satan himself utterly rooted, out and
all the enemies slain, ^ppressed, and trodden down, so as nothing may once
breath against the beck and power of God, he alone may every where gloriously
Reign, Imperially Rule, and triumph. And as while God reigns by his Spirit in
us, men have a certain Romans 8. 9. 10, 11. 1 Ioh. 3. 24. and 4. 8. 13.
Community with God in this world; so we pray and wish that he will also by
Christ communicate with us in heaven, the joy of the most blessed Kingdom Mat.
13. 43. 1 Cor. 2. 9.
and the Glory that in everlasting Ages of worlds shall never be changed, that
we may be not only children, but also heirs of our heavenly Mat. 25. 34. Romans
8. 15* 16, 17. ^i^. 3. 7.
Father, which desire also we verily nothing mistrust, or doubt that our
heavenly Father will one day grant us to enjoy.


M. What follows next?


S. That Gods Will be done, For it is Psalm. 4. 8. Mat. 26. 30. 42. Ioh. 4. 34:
and 5. 30. and 6. 38. Ephe. 6. 1. 1 Ioh. 4. 14.
the duty of children to frame their life according to the will of their
fathers, and not contrariwise the Parents to conform themselves to the will of
their children.


M. Do thou then think that men are able to do any thing against the Will of
God?


S. Surely it is evident and plainly known among all, that many sins and foul
deeds are daily done and committed by mortal men to the grievous offending of
his Will, yet so as God cannot by any force or necessity be compelled, Psalm. 5.
4, 5. and 41. 7, 8. Psalm. 119. 104. 1^8. Psalm. 115. 3. and 135 6, 7. Romans 9. 19.
but that he can most easily bring to effect whatsoever he has purposed to do.
We do therefore pray, not only that, that may come to pass which he has
decreed, which must needs come to pass, because the Will of God does ever carry
with it a necessity of performing; but for as much as our minds burning with
lusts, are commonly carried Romans 8. 7. etc. Gal. 5 16, 17.
to desire, and to do those things that most displease God, we pray that he
would with the moving of his holy Spirit so change and fashion all the Romans 8.
2. 4 5 etc. 14, 15, 16. 1 Cor. 2. 12. and 3: 16.
wills of us all to the meaning and will of his Majesty, that we may will or
wish nothing, much less do any thing that his Divine Will misliketh, and that
Acts 11. 14. 1 Pet. 3. 17. and 5. 13.
whatsoever we perceive to be tied by his Will, we may receive and suffer it,
not only with contented, but also with gladsome hearts.


M. Whereto do thou add, That Gods Will be done, In earth as it is in
heaven?


S. Forsooth, that we be in all things serviceable and obedient to Gods
Majesty, Psalm. 91. 11. and 105. 20. 21. and 104. 4, 5. Heb. 1. 6, 7, 14.
after the example of those heavenly spirits whom we call Angels, and as in
heaven there is no rebellion, so in earth also there be none any where found
that will, or dare resist and strive against the holy Will of God. Psalm. 19. 4,
5: and 104. 20. etc. and 135. 7. and 136* 7, 8, 9.
Yea, and when we behold the Sun and Moon and other Stars which we see in the
heaven, to be carried with continual motion and perpetual stirring, and with
their beams to lighten the earth by the Will of God, we behold an example of
obedience set forth for us to follow. Moreover, whereas God Deuteronomy. 5. 32. Mat. 7.
21 and 12. 50.
has in the holy Scriptures expressly declared his Will which he has plainly 1
Cor. 3. 6. 14, Gal. 4. 24.
notified by giving them the name of his Testament or last Will, they that vary
from the meaning of the Scriptures, surely do manifestly depart from the Will
of God.


M. Now I think thou have sufficiently spoken of the first part of the Lords
Prayer, which part contains these three Points that belong only to the glory
of God. Now it is good time for us to go forward to the second part, which
properly concerns things profitable for us, and meet for our commodities.


S. The first Point, of the second Part is, Give us this day our daily bread.


M. What do thou mean by the name of daily bread?


S. Not only those things that minister Psalm. 104. 15. 27. etc. and 105. toto
and 144. 10, 11, 12. and 145. 14, 15, 16. etc.
us food and apparel, but also all other things universally that are needful
to the maintaining, and preserving of our life, and leading it in quietness
without fear.


M. Is there any thing else whereof this word Bread does admonish us?


S. That we seek not, and gather together curiously dainty things for Psalm: 18.
18. 20. 29, 30. and 106, 14. Mat. 6. 15. Luk^ 16. 19. 1 Timothy 4. 8. 9.
banqueting or precious apparel, or sumptuous household stuff for pleasure, but
that we despise delicacies, and excess, and contented with little, be satisfied
with temporal and healthful diet, and with mean and necessary apparel.


M. How do thou call Bread thin^, which thou prayest to have given thee of
God?


S. By Gods gift it becomes ours, Psalm. 115. 16. Mat. 7* 7. 8: 1 Cor. 4. 7*
when he liberally gives it to us for our daily uses, though by right it be
not due to us.


M. Is there any other cause why thou call it thy Bread?


S. By this word we are put in mind Genesis 3. 19 Ephe. 4, 28. 2 These. 3. ^. 10.
11.
that we must get our living with our labor or by lawful means, that being
therewith contented, we do never by covetousness or fraud keep any thing of
other men's.


M. Seeing God bids us get our living by our own labor, why do thou ask
Bread of him?


S. It is God alone that gives fruitfulness Psalm 24. 1 and 65 9. and 68 9. and
104. 13 and 147, 8. etc.
to the ground, that makes the land plentiful and to bear fruit abundantly,
and therefore it is certain that in vain shall we waste and spend out all the
course of our life in toil of body, and travel of mind, unless it please God
to prosper our endeavors. It is meet therefore that we daily crave in Psalm 117.
1, 2. 1 Cor. 3. 7.
prayer things necessary for our food and life at the hands of Almighty God,
which according to the Divine saying of David, as he created all things, so
Psalm. 104. and 145. 15. and 147. etc.
does also feed and preserve them, and that with thankful hearts, we receive
the same, as it were given and reached to us by God, and delivered by his own
hand into our hands.


M. Think thou that rich men also, which have slowing plenty, and store of
all things, must daily crave Bread of God?


S. In vain shall we heap together, and lay up plenty, yea such as may Psalm:
34 9. Luke 1. 53. and 18. 15. 1 Timothy 6. 17.
for many years suffice either our vain glory, or our daily expenses or
necessary use, unless God of his grace do make the use of them healthful to us
for our life; yea, in vain shall we cramm meat into our stomach, unless Gods
Power by which we are rather fedd and sustained then by nourish ments of
meats, do give both to the meat power toourish, andn to the stomach Deuteronomy. 8.
3. Psa. 78. 29. 30. Mat. 4 4.
abillity to digest it; for which cause, even after supper, we pray to have the
daily meat which we have already received, to be given us of God, that is to
say, to be made lifeful and healthful to us.


M. Why be added these two w^rds, daily, and this day.


S. To pull out of our hearts the Mat. 6. 15. 34. Luk^ 41. Phil. 10 4. 6.
stings of care for to morrow, that we be not day and night tormented with them
in vain, and that the unsatiable covetise, and as it were, raging hunger of
excessive wealth being driven from our 1 Pet 5. 7. 1 Timothy 6. 9, 10.
minds, we diligently doing of our duty, should daily crave of our most liberal
Father that which he is ready daily to give.


M. Go forward to the rest.


S. Now follows the fifth Petition, wherein we pray our Father to forgive us
our Trespasses.


M. What ^ruit get we by this forgiveness?


S. Most large fruit, for where God Psalm. 31. 1, 2. Romans 5. 8, 10. 2 Cor 5. 18.
Col. 1 20, 21.
has mercy on humble suitors, we shall be in like place, and all one favor
with him, as if we were innocent, holy, and upright in all parts of our life.


M* Is this asking of Forgiveness necessary for all men?


S. Yea, forasmuch as ^here lives no Psalm* 14. 3. and 43 2, 3. Romans 3. 10. 11:
1 Ioh. 1. 8 10. Job 8. r, 2.
mortal man, that does not often slip in doing his duty, and that does not often
and grievously offend God, yea, and as the Scripture bears witness against
us, he that offends in any one Point is holden guilty of all, and that he who
labors to purge himself of one sin to God, shall be convicted of a thousand
heinous offenses. That we may therefore obtain forgiveness of sins, ^ Cor. 5.
18. 19. 20. etc. 1 John 7. 9.
one only hope remains, one only refuge for all men, the goodness and mercy
of God through Christ* as for them 1 Ioh. 1 8.
that do not confess that they ^ave sinned, nor do crave pardon for their Luke
18. 9. etc.
faults, but with that Pharise^ do glory in their innocence and righteousness
before God, or rathe^ against God, they exclude themselves from the fellowship
of the faithful to whom this Form of Prayer is appointed for them to follow,
and from the haven and refuge of Safety, for this is it that Christ says, that
he came into this world, not to call the righteous but sinners Mat. 9, 13, Luke
1. 31, 32. and 15. 17. 1 Timothy 1. 15.
to repentance.


M. Do thou affirm that God does freely forgive our sins?


S. Yea altogether; for else it could not seem forgiveness but amends, but Rom
3 24, 25. and 11. 5, 6.
to make sufficient amends for one, yea, the very least fault, we are not by
any power of ours in any wise able; we cannot therefore with our works, as it
were, with a certain price, redeem both the offense past, and the peace of 2 Timothy 1. 9, 10. Tit. 3. 5.
God, and make recompense of like for like, but ought with all lowly prayers to
crave of God pardon both of our Psalm. 32. 9, 6. 1 Ioh. 1. 9. and 2. 1.
fault and punishment, which pardon is not possible to be obtained but only by
Christ, and most humbly beseech him to forgive us.


M. But this, and the condition which is by and by after l^mited to us seem
scant to agr^e fitly togethe^; for we pray that God so forgive us as we forgive
our debtors, or them that trespass against us.


S. Surely God does offer us forgiveness Mat. 18. 32, 23. Luke 6. 36, 37.
upon a most reasonable condition, which yet is not so to be taken, as if in
forgiving men we should so deserve pardon o^ God, that the same should be as a
certain recompense to us by God, for then should not Gods forgiveness Romans 3.
23. 25. and 11. 5, 6. Gal. 6 4.
be freely given us, neither had Christ alone, as the Scriptures teach us, but
unless others do find us ready to forgive them, and unless we in following the
mercifulness and lenity of God our Mat. 5. 7. Luke 6. 26.
Father do show our selves to be his children, he plainly warns us to look
for nothing at his hands but extreme severity of punishment, he has therefore
appointed our easiness to forgive, not as a cause to deserve pardon of God, but
to be a pledge to confirm our hearts with sure confidence of Gods mercy.


M. Is there then no place of forgiveness with God left for them that show
themselves to other not intreatable to forgive and to lay away displeasures and
such as will not be appeased?


S. No place at all which is confirmed Mat. 6. 14, 15. and 18 24 28, 29. 33, 34.
and manifest by many other places of the holy Scriptures, and namely by that
Parable in the Gospel of the Servant which owed his Lord ten thousand talents,
refused at the same time Mat. 7. 2, 3. Lukee 6 37, 38.
to forgive his fellow servant one hundred pence that he had lent him, he
notably warns us, for according to the same Rule of rigor, and the same
example shall Justice without mercy be done upon him that cannot find in his
heart to show lenity and mercy to other.


M. Think thou that Suites in Law about right and wrong are here condemned?


S. A wreckful mind, and revengeful of injuries the Word of God Rom 12. 19,
20. Heb. 10. 30.
does surely condemn. Let contenders at Law therefore look well to it, with
what mind they sue any man; but the Laws and Ordinances of common Rom, 13. 1.
4. 6. etc. Tit. 3. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13.
right, and their lawful use, that is to say, such use as is directed by the
rule of Justice and Charity, are not taken away, or condemned by the Gospel of
Christ; but in this part of the Lords Prayer, our minds are bound to follow the
Rule of Christian Lenity and Love, that we suffer not our selves to be overcome
of evil, that is to say, to be drawn so far by other men's offense, as to have
to render evil for evil, but rather that we overcome evil with good, that is,
recompense evil deeds with good deeds, and bear and keep good will toward our
foes, yea, and our cruel and deadly enemies.


M. Now go forward to the sixth Petition.


S. Therein we pray. That he lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from
evil. For as before we do ask forgiveness of sins past, so now we pray that we
sin no more; a thousand fears are Ioh. 5. 14. and 8. 11. 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22.
Mat 10. 16, ^7 etc. Ephe. 6. 12. etc.
set before us, a thousand perils threatened us, a thousand snares provided and
laid for us; and we on our part are so feeble by Nature, so unware to foresee
them, and so weak to resist them, that with most small force, and occasions, we
are shoved down, and carried headlong into deceit.


M. Go forward.


S. Since therefore we be most sharply and continually assaulted, both by Mat.
10. 16, 17. Luke 16. 8. 2 Cor. 1. 13. 15. 1 Ioh. 1. 16.
crafty and violent men, and by concupisence, and our own lust by the
intisements of the flesh, this world, and all means of corruption, but
specially by that subtle, gulleful, and old wily Serpent the Devil, which like
a ravening Genesis 3. 1. etc. 2 Cor. 11. 3. etc.
Lion seeking whom he may devour, together with infinite other 1 Pet. 5. 8.
Ephe. 6. 11, 12.
malicious spirits, a^med with a thousand other crafty means to hurt us, is
ever ready to destroy us, and thereby as our weakness is, we must needs by and
by fall down, and be utterly undone, we flee to the faithful protection of our
Almighty and most loving Father, Ioh. 16. 33. 1 Ioh. 4. 4. and 5. 4.
and pray to him in these distresses and perils not to forsake us and leave us
destitute, but so to arm us with his R^m. 16. 20. Ephe. 6. 10. ^ ^im. 4. 17,
18.
strength, that we may be able, not only to resist and fight against the lusts
of the flesh, the inticements of this world, the force and violent assault of
Satan, but also to overcome and get the ^v^r hand of them, and that therefore
^^ will withdraw our hearts from vices and offenses, that we fall not into Romans
8. 1. 4. 6. etc. 1 Pet. 4. 1. 2.
them, nor at any time fail in our duty, but may ever lie safe and without
fear in the protection and defense of our most good and also most mighty Psalm.
91. 1. etc. and 121: toto.
Father.


M. Then thou meanest by the name of tentation, the craft and violence of the
devil; the snares and deceits of this world, and the corruptions and
inticements of our flesh, by which our souls are moved to sin, and holden fast
entangled.


S. Yea Master.


M. Since then to catch and entangle men as it were in snares of temptations, is
the Acts 5. 3. 1 Cor. 7. 5.
property of Satan, why do thou pray that God lead thee not into temptation?


S. God, as He defends and preserves Luke 22. 31, 3^. 1 Cor. 15. 10. 2 Cor.
12. 9. Ephe. 10, 11. 2 Timothy 4. 17. Gal. 5. 4. 1 Pet. 5. 5. Jude 1.
them that be his, that they be not snared with the guiles of Satan, and and so
fall into vices and foul sins, so from the wicked he holds back, and
withdraws his help and succor, whereof they being destitute, binded with
lust, and running headlong, are catched in all sorts of deceitful traps, and
carried unto all kind of wickedness, and at length with custom of ill doings,
as it were gathering a thick tough skin, their hearts wax hard, and so they
becoming bond men, and yielding Isa. 6. 10. 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. Ephe. 4. 18, 19.
themselves to slavery to the Tyrant Satan, they run in ruin to their undoing
and everlasting destruction.


M. There remains yet a certain appendant of the Lords Prayer.


S. For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever Amen.


M. Why would Christ have this Conclusion added?


S. First, to make us understand that our sure confidence of obtaining all
those things that we have before prayed for, stands in his goodness and
power, and not in any deserving of Psalm. 3. 3, 8. Hos. 13 9. Ioh. 10. 28.
our own, or of others; for by these words is declared, that there is nothing
that he which rules and governs the world, in whose Dominion and Psalm 22.
27. and 24. 1, 7. etc. and 29 1, 2. etc. and 47. toto. and 95. 3. 4. and. 1 Timothy 6. 15, 16: Mat. 7. 10. and 21. 22.
Power are all things, which most nobly shining in most ample and immortal
glory, infinitely excels above all other, either cannot or will not give us
when we pray for it, so that it be asked rightly and with sure faith, that now
there be no more doubting left in our hearts, which is also declared and
confirmed by this word Amen, added to 2 Cor. 1. 20.
the end of the Prayer. Moreover for as much as God alone is able at his own
Will to give whatsoever he has appointed, Psalm. 115. 3. 1 Cor. 9. 8. Ephe. 3.
20: 1 Timothy 6. 15, 16. 2 Cor. 1 8, 9, 10. 2 Timothy 4. 17, 18. Jude 24.
it most plainly appears, that of him alone all these things both ought to be
asked, and may be obtained, and that there is no peril or evil of ours so
great, which he is not able most easily by his excceding Power, Wisdom and
Goodness to overcome, and drive from us, and also to turn it to our safety.


M. Why is there in the later end mention made of the Glory of God?


S. To teach us to conclude all our Gods Glory the end of all: 1 Cor. 10. 31.
Ephesians. 3. 20, 21. Phil. 1. 11. 1 Timothy 1. 7. Jude 25.
prayers with praises of God, for that is the end whereunto all things ought to
be referred, that issue ought always to be set before the eyes of us
Christians for all our doings and our thoughts to reach unto, that Gods honor
be most largely amplified, and gloriously set out to sight, howsoever yet among
men in whose hearts Christian Religion is not settled, there is scarce any one
found that for his enterprises attempted, and perils adventured, desires no
glory as a reward of his deeds and virtues, which yet as not Mat: 6 1, 3, 4, 5,
6. etc. G^l 5. 26. Phil: 2. 3. and 3. 19.
true and sound glory, but vain show and boasting, the Lord vehemently and
earnestly commands them that be his to eschew.


M: Then after entreating of prayer, shall we fitly, and in good time add
somewhat of the praises of God and thanksgiving?


S. Surely most fitly, for not only in Romans 1. 1. 10. 2 Cor. 1. 11. Ephe. 1.
15. Phil. 3. 4.
the last end of the Lords Prayer Glory is mentioned, but also the very first
entry of it beginning with the glory and praises of God; for when we pray that
Gods Name be hallowed, what pray we else then that of all his Works, his Glory
be established, that is, that he be judged in forgiving sinners, merciful in
punishing Psalm. 51. 1. Romans 1. 18. and 3. 3. 4. Psalm. 65. 9. etc. and 68. 5.
etc. Psalm. 19. 1, 2.
the wicked, righteous in performing his Promises, true in heaping daily
benefits upon the unworthy, most good and liberal that whatsoever of his Works
we see or understand, we be thereby stirred to advance his Glory with Praises;
so was it Gods Will to have his Glory most nearly joined with prayer to him;
for meet it is, that as when we are touched and troubled with distresses, we
flee as humble Petitioners Psalm. 34. 1, 2: and 50. 14, 15. 23. 1 These. 1. 2.
and 5. 18. 2 These. 1. 3.
to Gods help and mercy, so we unfainedly acknowledge that by him we obtain
deliverance from all evils and greefs, and that he is to us the ^nly Author of
all good things; for of whom we crave pardon, and all good things, to him when
he gives them, not in heart and speech to render thanks were surely most great
unkindness; Psalm. 92. 1. and 95. 6. and 96. and 103. toto. Psalm. 29. 1, 2. and
50. 14. 15. 23. Romans 15. 6.
we ought therefore continually with mindful heart and due honors to yield
deserving thanks to the everliving God.


M. Go forward.


S. Moreover to praise and magnify Gods Goodness, Justice, Wisdom and Power,
and to give him thanks in our own name, and in the name of all mankind, is
parcel of the worshipping of God, belonging as properly to his Majesty as
Prayer, wherewith if we do not rightly worship him, surely we shall not only to
be unworthy of his Luke 17. 17: Ioh. 5. 44. Romans 1. 21. 24. Luke 17. 17. Ioh,
5. 44. Rom: 1. 21. 24. 1 Pet. 4. 11.
so many and so great benefits as unthankful persons, but also shall be most
worthy of eternal punishments, as wicked against God.


M. Since we receive benefits of men, shall it not also be lawful to give them
thanks.


S, Whatsoever benefits men do to 1 Cor. 12. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 9. 9. 12. 1 Pet. 4.
10, 11.
us, we ought to account them received of God, because he alone indeed does
give us them by the ministry of men; for which cause also though men ought not
to be beneficial and liberal of intent to get thank, but set forth the Glory
of God, yet to give thanks to them moved by kindness, grant us any thing
beneficially Mat 5* 16. 1 Pet. 2 12. Psalm 16 3. Mat. 5 43, 46, 47. Luke 6. 32,
33, 34. Acts 24. 2, 3.
and friendly, why should it not be lawful, since both equity requires, and by
Law of natural kindness we are bound unto it, yea, and God himself by this
mean binding us unto them, wills us to acknowledge the same.


M. Do thou then allow thanks to men also?


S. Yea since, our thankfulness to men redoundeth to God himself, because from
the Springhead of his divine liberality as it were, by certain guiding of
water courses, God conveyeth his benefits to 1 Cor. 12. 6. 21. 1 Pet. 4. 10. 11.
us by the hands of men; therefore if we show not our selves thankful to men,
we shall be also unthankful to God himself; only this let us look well to, that
his full Glory return and redound Psalm. 115. 1. Mat. 5. 16. 2 Cor. 4. 15. and
9. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 1 Pet. 1: 12.
to God alone, as to the Author and Fountain of all good things.


M. Is there any Rule and prescribed Form for us certainly to follow, when we
glorify and honor God, and give him thanks?


S. Innumerable praises of God, are commonly seen to be set out in his Word,
from the Rule whereof we vary not, we shall all always have a good Pattern for
us to follow in giving to God his praise and honor, and in yielding him
thanks. Finally, in a sum, seeing that the holy Scriptures do teach, that God
is not only our Deuteronomy. 19. 17. 20. and 28. 58. Mal. 1. 6, 7. and 2. 10.
Lord, but also our Father and Savior, and we likewise are his children and
servants, it is most meet that we employ all our life to the seting out of his
Psalm. 29. 1, 2. and 34. 1, 2. and 92 1. and 103. toto. Romans 15. 6. Pro. 16. 4.
Isa. 43. 7. Romans 11. 26. Col. 3. 16.
Glory, render to him due Honor, Worship, pray to, and reverence him, and with
heart and mouth continually thank him; since we are to this end created by him
and placed in this world, that his immortal Glory should be in most great
Honor among men, and rise to most high Magnificence.


FINIS.
