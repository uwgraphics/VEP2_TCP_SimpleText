A description of a strange (and miraculous) Fish, cast upon the sands in the
meads, in the Hundred of Worwell, in the County Palatine of Chester, (or
Chesshiere. The certainty whereof is here related concerning the said most
monstrous Fish.
To the tune of Bragandary.


OF many maruels in my time
I Have heretofore,
But here is a stranger now in prime
that is lately come on shore,
Inuites my pen to specify
What some (I doubt) will think a lie.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
It is a fish, a monstrous fish,
a fish that many dreads,
But now it is as we would wish,
cast up o'th sands in the meads,
In Chesshire; and it is certain true,
Described by those who did it view.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
Full twenty one yards and one foot
this fish extends in length,
With all things correspondent to it,
for amplitude and strength:
Good people what I shall report,
Do not account it fained sport.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
It is almost five yards in height,
which is a wondrous thing,
O mark what maruels to our sight
our Potent Lord can bring.
These secrets Neptune closely keeps
Within the bosom of the deeps.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
His lower jaw-bone's five yards long,
the upper thrice so much,
Twelve yoke of oxen stout and strong,
(the weight of it is such)
Could not once stir it out o'th sands
Thus works the All-creating hands.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
Some have a project now in hand,
(which is a tedious task)
When the Sea turns, to bring to Land
the same with empty cask:
But how I cannot well conceive,
To each man's judgment that I leave.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
The lower jaw bone named of late,
had teeth in it thirty four,
Whereof some of them are in weight
two pounds, or rather more:
There were no teeth in the upper jaw,
But holes, which many people saw.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
The second part,
To the same tune.




HIs Pissle is in length four yards,
big as a man in the wast,
This monster he who well regards,
from the first unto the last,
By every part may motives find,
To wonder at this wondrous kind.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
His Cods are like two hogsheads great,
this seems past belief,
But men of credit can relate
what I describe in brief:
Then let us with charity confess
Gods works are more then man can guess.
O rare, etc.
The tongue on it is so mighty large,
I will it not express,
Lest I your credit ouer-charge,
but you may easily guess,
That since his shape so far excels,
The tongue does answer all parts else.
O rare, etc.
A man on horseback as it is tried
may stand within his mouth,
Let none that hears it this derive,
for it is confirmed for truth:
By those who dare avouch the same,
Then let the Writer bear no blame.
O rare, etc.
His nerves or sinews like Bulls pissles,
for riding rods some use:
Of Spermaceti there is some vessels:
if this be the worst news,
That of this monster we shall hear,
All will be well I do not fear.
O rare, etc.
Already sixteen tuns of Oil
is from this fish extracted,
And yet continually they boil,
no season is protracted:
It cannot be imagined how much
'Twill yield, the vastness on it is such.
O rare, etc.
When he upon the sands was cast
alive, which was awhile:
He yell'd so loud, that many (aghast)
heard him above six mile:
It Is said the Female fish likewise
Was heard to mourn with horrid cries:
O rare, etc.
The Mariners of Chester say
a Herring-hog it is named:
What ere it be, for certain they
that are for knowledge famed,
Affirm, the like in ages past
Upon our Coast was never cast.
O rare
beyond compare,
in England nere the like.
