The discon tented Lover.
To a pleasant new Court Tune.




TOul, toul, gentle bell for a soul,
killing care does control,
And my mind is sore oppressed;
But I fear I shall die.
For a glance of that eye,
Which so lately did fly,
Like a Comet from the sky,
Or like some great Deity:
But my wishes are in vain,
I shall never see it again.
When I, in the Temple did spy,
This divine purity,
On her knees to her Saint,
She seemed so divine,
All her graces did shine
Far more fairer then the shrine*
Faith I wished she had been mine,
And my heart full resign,
May powerfully prove
No Religion like love.
Fair, fair, and as chaste as the air.
Holy Nunns breath in prayer.
Was this Votresse divine:
From each eye dropped a tear.
Like the pearl'd violets were
When the Spring does appear
To usher in the year,
But I dare safely swear,
That those tears trickle down
For no sins of her own.
But now, increases my woe,
I by no means can know
Where this beauty does dwell:
All her rites being done
To her Lady and her Son,
I war left all alone,
And my Saint was from me gone,
And to Heaven she is flown,
Which makes me to say
I can scarce live a day.




NOw I, must make haste and die,
And ascend to the sky,
Where my hopes are enthroned:
You Ladies all adieu,
Be your Loves false or true,
I am going for to view
One that far excells all you,
One whom I never knew,
But must breath out my breath
For acquaintance in death.
Ring, ring, merry bells while we sing
Drinking healths to our King,
And our minds all advanced;
Let us never fear to die,
Till we drink out each eye,
Let cash and cans fly
Like hailstones from the sky,
Bacchus great Deity:
But my wishes are but in vain,
Fill the Cans round again.
When I in the Tavern did spy
Such fair boon company
On our knees drinking healths,
We look so divine.
When our noses do shine,
Well burnisht with rich wine.
Faith I wished the cup were mine:
Unto thee I resign,
And may powerfully prove
In drinking thy love.
Free, free, as the air let us be,
Esteeming no degree,
But to all breaths alike.
From one eye dropped a tear,
Lest you Maudlin apear.
And next morning do fear
To be physick'd with small Beer,
But I dare safely swear,
If a tear trickle down,
It Is for love to the Crown.
And now, increases my woe,
I by all means must know
What is due for our Sack;
But the reckoning being paid
To the Hostess or Maid,
We need not be afraid
To be scurvely betrayed
To the Constables aid:
Let us honestly pay,
Else we scarce get away.
Now must I make have and see
What will us all free
All our hands from the Bar;
You Ladies all adieu,
Be your reckoning false or true,
I am going for to view
What belongs to all you.
Though we pay more then our own,
Yet my purse will I spend,
And my life for my friend.
