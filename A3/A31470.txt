To His Noble Friend.
TO prescribe to these Verses your fair Name,
Although but one clean Sheet, it were no shame.
Till Something of more Learning I shall have,
You shall be Nameless. Yet, Religion's brave.
One Century OF SACRED DISTICKS, OR, Religion in verse.
To the READER.
IN these plain Verses I have no other ends,
But to edify my Self, and my good Friends
I. Accounts.
HOW suddenly may I be called away!
It Is good to make Accounts up every day.
II. Acceptance.
Lord! Be Thou still the same. Thou gracious art
And wilt accept a broken contrite heart.
III. Grace.
I fear not, when my Heart by God is viewed,
As by the Grace of Christ is is renewed.
IV. Persecution.
To persecute is to hurt the Innocent:
To prosecute is of the Guilty meant.
V. Gravity.
Let Grave men take so much Authority,
As to correct the faults in the company.
VI. Oaths.
Vain Swearing, if you hear; to your self look,
You be not guilty: Give it a rebuke.
VIII. Lust.
Some think they are honest, if they do not act;
Ill Thoughts and Eyes are guilty of the Fact.
VIII. Company.
Fairly depart, if there be two, or one
Quarrel-some Fellow. Better be alone.
IX. The Lie.
If it be said, you lie: you quarrel and fight:
If told, you Swear: of that you make but light.
X. Rules.
When you do think or read of some good Rule,
Bind it in Rhythm, and put thy self to School.
XI. Conspiracy.
Let Good men make a new Conspiracy,
To amend this Ages Immorality.
XII. Again.
To conspire in good Actions, is a Thing
Will please our God, and not displease our King.
XIII. The Fight.
Single men boldly are gone out, to fight
Against Sin and Satan. Let their Force unite.
XIV. Fugitives.
Little's the Hope of complete Victory,
When some of us turn to the Enemy.
XV. Subjects.
Why don't all Subjects their good King obey?
They are proud, and would be their own masters, They.
XVI. Money.
You do love Money. Yes: it is true you say.
But it is not to lay up, but give and pay.
XVII. Again.
You give too much? No: what I gave,
That in the better Sense I have.
XVIII. Repayment.
What you do borrow, take care to repay:
Not borrow ag^in, unless you keep your day.
XIX. Night.
Awaking, banish lust; and think upon
What good work on the next day must be done.
XX. Again.
Lying a Bed the Winter Nights so long,
Praise ye Gods loving kindness in a Song.
XXI. Sacred Disticks.
Among your Disticks, those are best of all,
Which contain Observations Scriptural.
XXII. Gluttons. Psalm.
What Is said of bloody men, is true, no doubt,
Of Gluttons: Half their days they live not out.
XXIII. Diet.
A Diet, simple, spare, not excessive,
Will keep thee in good health, and long alive.
XXIV. Hospitality.
I praise the good Housekeeper. God will bless
The Hospitable. Shun Inordinateness.
XXV. Abstinent.
The Abstinent will have the more to give;
With what they spare the needy they relieve.
XXVI. Parson.
Not only give them, that come to your door;
But send your Corn and Money to the poor.

The Rich have a Temptation to exceed:
In great Prosperity then take great heed.
