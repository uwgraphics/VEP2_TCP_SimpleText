FOOLS in Earnest, Or, A FAIRING for PHANATICKS
The following Lines Observe, and You
Will certainly Conclude it True,
That such as spend their Youthful time
In foolish Garb, and save no Coin,
Will when Age comes forsaken be,
And be Exposed to Misery.
To the Tune, I Will Sell my Cart and eke my Plough.
I Will Venture out upon the Stage,
Against Phanaticks of this Age,
Who Wallow in the Mire;
And are Examples unto such
Whose Poverty appears much,
Caused by Rich Attire.
How comely is it do you think,
For such as carry Coals and Drink
To imitate a Lady.
Or Milk-Maids in a Flowered Gown
Bedeckt with Lace from Foot to Crown.
And all Rich Things that may be.
Some Wear their Hoods like to Hop-sacks
And Rich Gay Clothing on their Backs,
You Would take them for Great Nobles;
But if a thorough-Search be made,
They Are poor, and scarce can follow trade
Some hardly worth two Boodles.
The Fruit that Grows on such Trees
Are usually such as these,
It still provokes some Others
In such like Garb to follow them,
Although it proves their Shame and Sin
So to Excel Grandmothers.
Young Maids get such an Itch of Pride,
They Will plead with Parents to provide
For them beyond their Calling;
Saying, Why shall not I be like to such,
I Am sure you are worth twice as much;
And thus they keep a Bawling.
That Parents cannot Rest Content,
Till they have all their Substance spent,
To Answer Childrens Craving;
By yielding thus many Consumes
Shop, Goods and Furniture for Rooms,
Proud Folks are not for sparing.
Such say, Hang Sorrow, cast off Care,
We'll spend all up, and nothing spare,
Parish is bound to find us,
When we are Old and cannot Work,
Be we under Christian or Turk,
Law will force them to Mind us.
Such is the Language of She-Huffs,
Who swagger with their Fans and Muffs,
And with their Tawdrey Laces,
If that you tell them of their Pride,
They Will you and your Council deride,
And scoff you to your Faces.
Many Parents are worthy blame,
This may be spoken to their shame,
Their Children they entice;
By the ill Example they them Give,
In their own Walks, 'cause they so live
In Pride's chargeable Vice.
Some Mystresses too blame likewise,
'Cause they their Servants do Advise
In costly Garbs to go;
By means of which they spend their Gains
And nothing save of all their Pains,
Such do their Folly show.
If out of Employ such should be,
In a short time comes Poverty,
Much like an Armed Man;
The Cause of which they stoop will not,
T'Employment mean, which might begot
Were 't not for Muff and Fan.
Young Men and Maids, when once they be
Cloth!d 'bove their Calling and Degree,
It Is hard for to abate;
In Clothing or other Expense,
But they will still be giving Offense,
By Living at high Rate.
Until at last some forced are,
By being poor and very bare,
To play the Whore or Thief;
Their Gentile Port for to maintain
And keep on in their lofty Strain,
To seem one of the Chief.
Their Naked Necks and Breasts they show
In most Places whereto they go,
They think to Merit Honor;
But when they come where they are known,
Civil Persons do them disown,
And most cry out upon Her.
If young Maids would good Husbands have,
Then Labor to go Neat and Grave,
And not in foolish Clothing;
Your Money save, and Gain a Sum,
Then you will engage good Suitors come;
If proud, you will be their Lothing.
There Is few young Men will take Girls now,
Without a Hundred Pound or two,
Especially Gentile ones;
They Will rather take a drudging Lass,
Which Milk the Cowes upon the Grass,
With Ten pounds, then proud vile Ones.
Let every One of each degree
Walk as becomes their Quality,
And not Vye with their Betters:
Nobles should go in Rich Attire,
Not such as Tumble in the Mire,
Which must for Food be Debtors!
Accept of what I have Writ in Haste,
And do not you your Substance waste
On Things that is vain and needless,
Which Renders you Ridiculous,
By Persons Grave and Serious,
And prized by none, but the Heedless.
FINIS.
