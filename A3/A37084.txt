Church in Cornhill.

The Publisher to the Reader.
Christian Reader,
NOthing from without has supported my spirit in the course of life, wherein
God has led me hitherto ( through manifold private difficulties and public
desertions,) but the usefulness thereof toward the Public. and whiles the
graciousnesse of Providence has from time to time succored me, chiefly then
when I was sinking under my ^^rdens; I have been taught from within, to look up
to God alone in well-doing, till he bring his Salvation out of Sion: for, to
propagate this Salvation of his with my poor talents, and to stir up others
to contribute ^^eir help thereunto, is the utmost aim which I have in the
Agency for Lear^ing; wherein the goodness of the Par^ament has owned me. And
althoug^ toward the business it self, nothi^^ has been further done then to
na^ me for it; ( which for the time ha^^ made my burdens somewhat heavie^ yet
because my genius does leade^ this way; and I hope still in God th^^ he will
not leave me without encouragements: therefore I am not weary in well-doing, so
long as I have opportunity. Having then, upon a motion made by some, made my
self Isntrumental to draw forth from others these following Directions,
toward the Reforming of Schools, and the Advancement of Piety and Learning
therein; I thought it expedient to acquaint thee with them, Christian Reader;
that if thou do think thy self any way concerned either in furthering the
benefits of such a way of Education toward others; or in partaki^^ thereof for
thine own, thou may bethink thy self how to do that which is fitting and
conscionable; that such an Endeavor as this may be set forward toward the
Public Good. For mine own part, I shall confess freely, that amongst all the
Objects whereunto I have dedicated my thoughts and pains (whereof the extent is
as large as every Good and Rational Work in the whole life of Christianity)
there is not any one which does lie nearer my heart then this of the Education
of Children in the way of Christianity. For, all things being rightly weighed,
we shall perceive that this Endeavor alone, or nothing, will be able to work a
Reformation in this our Age. For whiles the Magistracy and Ministry is made an
Object of violent Contradictions, and thereby almost wholly put out of frame
and made uselelesse, as to the Reforming of Vices in Church and Commonwealth;
it cannot be expected, although they be never so knowing and willing, that in
the execution of their places, they should be able to bring matters to
perfection. Therefore, to meddle directly with the multitudes of Aged people
(the Objects of their charges) who are now settled and habituated in the way of
their own choosing, and to think to draw them from it, is to attempt, without
discretion, an impossibility. For it is not possible, that the extraordinary
strains and distempers, whereinto we are fallen in these times, can be reformed
without some extraordinary ability, either of outward Authority and Power to
restrain exemplary disorderlinesse; or of inward Conviction, to lead men
captive under the yoke of Christ, which are things (...) decayed, now adays,
amongst the professions of men. Seeing then, the corruptions of those that are
of age, are too strong and sturdy to be conquered by ordinary and weak means,
and none extraordinary or strong enough, are apparent; it follows, that there
is none other way left, but to deal with the young ones, before any corrupt
habits, and perverse engagements be confirmed upon them; that they may be
trained up from their Infancy, to a course of Reformation, both of Virtue and
Learning. But because the training up of Scholars in one School or two, though
very great and most exactly Reformed, will be but an inconsiderable matter, in
respect of a whole Nation, and have no great influence upon the youth thereof,
where so many Schools remain unreformed, and propagate corruptions; therefore
the propagation of reformed Schools is mainly aimed at; and to that effect, the
training up of Reformed Schoolmasters, is one of the Chief parts of this
Design. Now to endeavor to make out this, that the readiest way to Reform
both Church and Commonwealth, is ^o reform the Schools of Education therein;
and that the way to Reform these, is to send forth Reformed Schoolmasters
amongst them, is, as I suppose, altogether superfluous: For it cannot be
thought, that any rational man should be such a stranger unto the affairs of
humane Societies, as not to see, that from the ordinary Schools, all
Magistrates, and Ministers, and Officers of State are taken throughout the
Nations of the World, to be set over others; and that the impressions both of
vice and virtue, which they have received in the Schools, are exercised, and
become effectual, for good or evil, afterward, in their places toward the
Church and Commonwealth: so that the Schools are to be looked upon* as the
Ordinary and Natural fountains of a Settlement, as of our Corruption, so of
our Reformation; if God will bless us with any. And the Schoolmaster in a
well ordered Commonwealth, is no less considerable then either the Minister
or the Magistrate; because neither the one nor the other will prosper or
subsist long without him. I shall not need to add any thing further concerning
this subject, to make thee sensible, either of the Usefulness of the
undertaking, or of the Scope of my negotiation in it.

This only I would have thee further to observe, judicious and truly
Christian Reader (for none but such can see any thing in this business) that
the Author of this new Model of schooling was entreated to put it to paper,
upon a serious motion made to him, and to some Friends of his, by others; for
the entertaining and regulating of a Christian Association, whereof all the
Members might be serviceable to each other, and to the Public: therefore he
speaks not in his own name alone concerning the Association, but in the name of
those, who were jointly called upon to give their assent thereunto, who agreed
with him in these Proposals. The Motion is not as yet come to maturitie in the
Resolution of those that first made it, and the cause is of some Conveniences
to effect it, and the fears of unsettlement, after that it shall be set upon:
and till there be a further ground laid for the prosecuting of this Design; it
is needless to give the Directory concerning the Education of Girls. In the
mean time, I have thought good to publish this, with an addition of some
directions for teaching of Logic; that such as can judge, may see that there
is an easier and readier way to attain the perfection of Virtue and Happiness,
known and practicable, then as yet has been published to the World, or put in
practice by any; and that to set these wheels agoing, nothing is wanting, but a
quiet place of abode, and some assurance of necessary Protection.

Let thy prayer go along with it, to supply these wants, if thou have any
Rational or Spiritual apprehension of the good sought thereby unto all: and
if thou can, say with the Prophet Psalm. 14. v. 7. O that the salvation of
Israel were come out of Sion! when the Lord brings back the Captivity of his
people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. To the expectation and
accomplishment of this hope and promise, I leave thee, in him who is the God of
our Salvation, and the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them
that are afar off upon the Sea, Psalm. 65. ver. 5. in whom I rest,

Thy most willing Servant, for the advancement of Piety and Learning, Samuel
Hartlib.

THE REFORMED SCHOOL.
Concerning an Association for the Education of Children.
UPON the motion which is made of entering into a Society, wherein a certain
number of Children, Boys and Girls, should be educated unto Religion, to
Moral Sciences and Virtues; we shall return this Answer.

1. That we hope never to be found unwilling to contribute that which we can,
toward the Advancement of Godliness in any Body or Society; or toward the
Reformation of Vices, which bring the judgments of God upon this Babylonian
Generation wherein we live.

2. That we conceive the ways of Christian Associations amongst those that are
of riper years; and the Rules of Christian education amongst those that are not
yet come to years of discretion, to be most conducible unto these ends:
therefore as we shall be willing to become serviceable, and concur with such
as entertai^ these thoughts; so we shall desire to see the hand of Providence
leading, and opening a door for action to us.

3. And that we may be able to discover whether yea or no, how far, what way,
and with whom this Aim should be prosecuted; we shall offer (to those that make
the Motion to us, and to all others whose inclinations may bend this way) these
following points to be taken into consideration: that if upon the Proposal
thereof, any just Engagement does follow; we may see God before us in the
prosecution of this Enterprise.

First of the Association.
1. The Association should be only of free Persons: therefore we shall not
consent to join with any (specially with women) but such as are free to dispose
of themselves this way, either by their own right, as being under no Parents
or Tutors to whom they are accountable of their actions: or by the full consent
of friends that may pretend to have some right to oversee them, and control
their proceedings.

2. Those that associat should not come together to live an easy life without
all cares; but their whole aim should be, to advance the life of Christianity
in themselves and others, with all diligence.

3. The way of (...) the Society, of staying in it, and of going out of it,
should be free: only at the coming in, and going out; the express motives
should be declared for which the Association is taken up, or left off; that all
things may be done openly and to edification, as it becomes the Children of
light.

4. The form of the Society should consist in the cohabitation of those that
are associated in one house, for the joint exercise of daily worshipping of
God, for the furthera^ce of profitable employments by mutual concurrence, for
the comfort of Table-communion, and for mutual assistance in necessary
consultations.

As concerning the place of cohabitation, it may easily be found when the
number and names are known, of those that will associat.

The daily worshipping of God should be performed in Prayers, Meditations, and
Conferences about the word of God: whereof, the exercises ought to be
regulated in Private and Public, jointly and severally, according to the
capacity and free willing inclinations of those that shall engage to entertain
the same.

(...) furtherance of profitable employments should be partly for the
improvement of Rationality, Discretion and Prudency, to manage Rightly the
affairs wherein every one by his calling is bound to do service unto others.
Partly for the improvement of handy-works and tradings proper to either sex,
which may become a relief to the poor; according to the proportion which every
one shall be willing to enlarge himself in.

For the enioyment of Table-Societie; there should be a certain rate set down
for diet and other things; and a Steward appointed who should have the care of
providing all things according to the rates appointed; who should give in his
accounts weekly and monthly of all his disbursments.

The mutual assistance to be given in necessary consultations should respect
three things: First, the matters of spiritual concernment in common; Secondly,
the matters of common outward concernment; and Thirdly, the matters of
particular concernment whether Spiritual or Bodily.

Concerning all matters of common concernment, whether spiritual or outward;
there should be of course some set times appointed, wherein, first, the
spiritual state of the Society, and then the outward affairs, should be
taken into consideration.

As for the spiritual state; matters of common edification are to be minded
therein, as the fruit of that watchfulness which Christians ought to have over
each other in the common profession of the name of Christ.

As for the outward affairs; all orders tending to regulate the same should be
settled by mutual and free consent: concerning which, this fundamental Rule is
to be observed: that, nothing is to be counted a matter of common concernment,
but that wherein every one does knowingly and judiciously profess himself to
be concerned freely and willingly.

Concerning matters of particular concernment; any time should be free for
those that stand in need of Council, to call the rest of their Associats,
either all or some, to give them assistance there (...)*

If these General Rule^ ^e first assented unto by those who are willing to
^^gage in such a way; the particulars may be afterward set down to be ratified
by common consent, concerning the exercises of daily worship, meditation and
conferences how to advance (...) Christianity in each other thereby, and
concerning the course of their daily employments in other things.

Secondly of the Education of Children.
The Girls should all be lodged in the same house with the associated women;
to be under the perpetual inspection of the Governess, by whom, their several
tasks for all the days of the week and hours of the day, should be set unto
them; and the times of taking an account of them concerning every thing,
ordered and strictly observed.

The Boys should be in a several house, or part of the house so, that they
should not be able at any time to have free communication with the Girls; but
should be always under the inspection of their Tutors who should be men
belonging to the association, for such Offices which women are not fit to be
employed in: and these Tutors and Teachers should all be under one general
Overseer, who should give them their tasks, and see the same performed
according to settled Orders.

The main scope of the whole work of Education, both in the Boys and Girls,
should be none other but this; to train them up to know God in Christ, that
they may walk worthy of him in the Gospel; and become profitable instruments
of the Commonwealth in their Generations. And in order to this, two things are
to be taught them. First, the way of Godliness, wherein every day they are ^o
be exercised, by prayers, reading of the word, Catecheticall Institutions, and
other ^xercises subordinat unto the life of Christia^ity. Secondly, the way of
Serviceableness toward the Society wherein they live, that they may be enabled
each in their sex respectively, ^o follow lawful callings for profitable uses;
and not become a burden to their generation ^y living in Idleness and
disorderlinesse, as most commonly those do which come from ^he Schools of this
age.

The Rule then according to which their ^ducation is to be Reformed
fundamentally, ^s this.

That no time of the day is to be lost without some teaching exercise; and that
nothing ^s to be taught but that which is useful in ^t self to the Society of
mankind, therein fitting them for employments approvable by the Gospel; and
which will bring them to be^ave themselves so as it becomes those who ^re
called to walk with the lamb upon mount ^ion in the presence of God, that is,
as Saints ^n his Church.

Upon this ground, all the matters of show and appearance, which please the
fancies of ^en in the world, whether they be in points ^f knowledge or
practice; (wherein all the ^ime of the youth is most commonly spent in ordinary
Schools) are to be laid aside in the course of this Education.

Therefore as to the Girls, the ordinary van^^ty and curiosity of their
dressing of hair an^ putting an of apparel; the customs and prin^ciples of
wantonness and bold behaviors which in their dancings are taught them; an^
whatsoever else does tend only to fome^t pri^ and satisfy curiosity and
imaginary delights shall be changed, by this our course of Edu^cation, into
plain, decet cleanliness and health full ways of appa^relling themselves; an^
into such exercises of their hearts, heads an^ hands, which may habituat them
through the fere of God, to become good and carefu^ houswiues, loving toward
their husbands an^ their children when God shall call them t^ be married; and
understanding in all thing belonging to the care of a Family, accordin^ to the
Characters which Solomon does give (...) a virtuous Godly woman. And such as
man be found capable of Tongues and Science^ (to perfect them in Graces and the
know^ledge of Christ for all is to be referred t^ him above the ordinary sort)
are not to b^ neglected; but assisted toward the improv^^ment of their
intellectual abilities.

As for the Boys; the same Rule is to be o^served in the way of their
Education, bo^ for Tongues, Sciences and Employments. S^ ^^at all the
preposterous Methods of teach^^g the same; by which, not only their time is
^^st, but their spirits and affections are in^red to evil customs of
Disorderliness, of ^anity, Pride and Self conceitedness, which is ^he root of
all our contentions about matters ^f Learning and Science falsely so called: and
^ll the unprofitable exercises of their mind and body in things which take them
off from ^e aim of Christianity unto the customs of ^e world shall be altered
into profitable ^mployments which may fit them to be good Commonwealths men, by
the knowledge of ^l things which are fundamental for the ^^tlement of a State
in Husbandry, in ne^^ssary Trades, in Navigation, in Civil Of^^ces for the
Administration of Justice; in ^e^ce and War; and in Oeconomicall Duties (...)
which they may be serviceable to their own ^^milies, and to their neighbors.

And if these General Grounds be assented unto by those that have a mind to
associat, ^d to help forward the Education of youth ^r a beginning of some
Real Reformation in ^r age; the particular Models both for Boys ^^d Girls
Institution, Inspection and Employ^ents may be soon added, and offered to their
^^nsideration.

THE DIRECTORY For the Particular Education of Boys.
IF we suppose that fifty or threescore Boye^ are to be educated, according to
the Princi^ples heretofore mentioned; we conceive the care which is to be taken
of them should b^ ordered after this manner.

1. Let there be one Governor over them and three Ushers under him.

2. Let these Ushers do all things by the Governors Direction, which he shall
afte^ previous Consultation with them, give: th^^ they may the better
understand their wor^^ and go about it with cheerfulness.

3. And that these may without distractio^ be able to attend their work; Let
them b^ provided with all outward things necessa^^ for lodging, food, and
raiment, without the cost or care, by the Diligence of him the shall be Steward
of the Association.

4. Let the Governor and Ushers obser^ the settled Rights and Duties of their
severa^ places, and the Determined Rules of educ^^tion toward the Children.

The Rights and Duties of the Governor, and Ushers places.
AS it is the Governors Duty to instruct and Oversee the Ushers in all ^ings
which concern the Children; so it ^all not be lawful for Ushers to alter any
^ing in the Orders which the Governor ^all settle, without his knowledge and
ap^^obation.

2. The Governor shall have power, as t, ^ovide and place, so to displace the
Usherso (...) he shall see cause: which cause, it will be fit (...) him to make
known to any of the Asso^^tion, who shall desire to be informed ^ereof.

3. The Governor shall give all his Di^^^^ctions in writing to the ushers.

4. Every Usher shall have a peculiar number (...) Scholars committed to his
inspection ^^ose lodgings shall be together, all next unto ^s Chamber, that in
the night-season as well by day, he may oversee them.

5. The Ushers shall see their peculiar Schol^^s rise and go to bed, at the
hours appoin^^: and when their Scholars are retired or ^^ne to bed; they
shall come to the Gover^^ur every evening before they go to bed ^^emselves;
that they may confer about their ^^tters together.

6. The Governor shall either by himself or some other see both the ushers and
their scholars in their several quarters at the set hours, before he goes to
bed himself: and the Steward shall see the other servants retired and all the
doors shut at the hour appointed, and shall bring such keys to the Governor
as b^ shall ordain to be brought unto him.

The Rules of Education.
The Chief Rule of the whole Work is, tha^ nothing may be made tedious and
grievous t^ the Children: but all the toilsomeness of the^ business the
Governor and Ushers are t^ take upon themselves; that by diligence an^
industry, all things may be so prepared, methodized and ordered for their
apprehension; the their work may unto them be as a delightfu^ recreation by the
variety and easiness thereon

The things to be looked unto in the care o^ their education, are 1. Their
Advanceme^ in Piety. 2. The Preservation of their Healt^ 3. The Forming of
their Manners. 4. The^ Proficiency in Learning.

Concerning their Advancement in Piety.
That they may be advanced in Piety; the shall be exercised every day, 1. in
Prayers. ^ in Reading the Scriptures. 3. in Cateche^icall conferences. 4. And
on the Lords day ^n the duties of solemn worship.

Their daily Prayers, reading of Scriptures, and conferences, shall go together
in this order.

In the evening when the time of retiring is ^ome, every Usher shall see his
Scholars in their Chamber (for if they could be all that ^elong to each Usher
made to sleep in one ^rge Chamber like a gallerye, two and two ^^ a bed; the
way of overseeing, and uniting them in their exercises would be most
commo^ious:) and when they are going to uncloth themselves, one of their number
shall be taken ^ his turn according to a List, to go before ^e rest in a short
prayer or the Usher himself all do it before they begin to put off their
^lothes; each of them kneeling at the beds-side ^here he is to sleep: and the
prayer being ^ded he whose turn it is shall read unto them ^me part of the Holy
Scriptures, while they ^cloth themselves; and pray in two or three ^ords for a
blessing upon their rest. He those turn it is to do this duty, shall sleep ^at
night with the Usher to whose care he is ^mmitted; and in the Morning shall
rise with ^m half an hour before the rest; to waken ^ fellow-Scholars (at the
hour appointed) ^ cause them rise, which whiles they are a doing, and putting
on their clothes, and combing their heads; he shall again with a previous
short ejaculation, read some part of the Scripture unto them; and with a short
prayer (every one of the rest kneeling o^ standing by the bed where he slept)
thank God for his preservation over them in the night past, and crave his
direction, blessing and protection for the day following. This is to be done
within the space of half an hour, to be measured by a Sand glass: after which
time, every one shall go abroad for the space of another half hour to stretch,
wash, and cleanse himself: till, by the ringing of a Bell* the whole family be
called together: at thi^ meeting, the Women and Girls shall be in on^ room by
themselves, and the Men an^ Boys in another, so that they shall not se^ one
another, and yet both be able to hear him, who shall be appointed to go before
them all in the family-duty. He shall be some man of the Association in his
daily or weekl^ turn, as they shall appoint it, who shall wit^ a short prayer
crave a blessing upon the^ meeting, and read a parcel of the Holy Scrip^tures,
and conclude the Reading with a sho^ prayer: all which shall not exced the
space o^ half an hour: and the next half hour fo^lowing shall be spent in
Catecheticall exerc^ses and conferences according to the ord^^ which the
Governor shall settle in that mat^er differently toward the different Ages
and ^egrees of proficiency in the younger and more ^ged Scholars. As for the
members of the As^ciation; their conferences shall not be ^inted within such a
time, but may be exten^ed at pleasure: only the way how they ought (...) be
ordered, that all may profit thereby, and ^^nfusion may be avoided; is to be
determi^ed by the Governor, with their approbation.

At Dinner and Supper-time (which shall ^ot exceed half an hour) one of the
Chil^en shall in his turn daily crave a blessing in ^^e name of all, upon their
food: and read part of the Scripture unto them while they ^e at table; and when
they have done, they all jointly sing a stave or two of a Psalm (...)
thanksgiving.

After supper, before they go to their ^hambers, they shall meet all again in
their ^^verall rooms each sex by themselves, to ^^yn in prayer, and in reading
the word, as in ^^e morning they did, for the space of half an ^^ur: and
another half hour afterward shall (...) spent in Conferences; wherein the
Children ^^ll be encouraged, and accustomed to pro^^se Questions to their
Teachers, or to one ^^other concerning matters of doubt which ^^y have been
incident unto their thoughts, ^^her from the reading of Scripture or some,
other thing observed in the daytime: which being done, they shall all retire
unto their several quarters, and prepare to go to bed.

This Course of daily exercise in Piety is to be continued without
interruption, no bod^ is to be exempted from it, but only in case o^ sickness.

On the Lords day, over and above the daily sacrifice within doors to be
observed the Children shall be brought forth unto the public meetings, to join
with the Congrega^tion of others in the worship of God; and (...) the
intervalles of times between the pub^ meetings, and the last Sermon and supp^^
time; Conferences shall be entertained wi^ them, concerning the things which
they ha^ heard.

And if those of the Association should e^tertain any Prophetical exercises
among themselves, or with others, from without; the some of the most advanced
Scholars shou^ be admitted to be present with them.

This Care of advancing Piety and keep^ the Lords day, is to be made the Chief
^f things belonging to their Education.

Concerning the Preservation of their Hea^
The next Principal Care is concerning (...) Preservation of their Health,
wherein (...) things belonging 1. to their Diet. 2. their sleep^ng. 3. to their
bodily exercises 4. and to their Cleanliness are to be rightly ordered, and
^verseen; that the Orders may be observed.

Concerning their Diet.
Their Diet shall be appointed for every ^ay of the week what it shall be, and
when it shall be given them.

Their Breakfast, at 8 of the clock in the ^orning, of Bread and Butter or some
other ^ing. they may be at it for the space of half (...) hour.

Their Dinner of good healthful plain food.

Competency is to be upon the table for ^em precisely at 12 of the Clock.

Their Supper of some food of light and ^sie digestion is to be upon the table
precisely ^ half an hour past six of the clock, and be^re seven, taken away.

Bread and beer of good quality shall not be ^fused to any that shall desire
it, in case of (...) being satisfied with the ordinary al^wance.

In case of Sickness there should be a peculiar ^om appointed for them, and
some to attend ^em, with such a Diet as shall be prescribed; ^d to entertain
them with such thoughts ^d conversation, as shall be fitting for their
^position of mind.

Concerning their Sleep and Rest.
In Winter, the Aged Scholars shall be wa^kened at five; in summer, at four of
the Clock in the Morning: the younger, in Som^mer at five; in Winter, at six in
the Morning and they shall all be in bed before, or at ni^ of the Clock at
night. The Governors, Ushe^ and Steward, if they be in health, should n^ go to
bed till Ten.

Concerning their Bodily Exercises.
They shall exercise and stir their Bodies (...) the morning-season before
dinner from (...) till 12 a clock, and before supper they she again exercise
themselves in Summer, from half an hour past five, till half an hour pa^ six,
and in winter, from five till six, and from half an hour past twelve after
dinner, t^ half an hour past one, it shall be free (...) them, to do private
businesses, in their Cha^bers or else where.

The particular ways of Exercising the Bodies shall not be left at random, but
o^dered to some advantage of the Associati^ and of their own experience in
matters eit^ of Husbandry, or Manufactures, or of ^litary Employments.

Concerning their Cleanliness.
They must be taught Cleanliness without Curiosity; and made in love with it,
as it is ^sefull for Health; in which respect the Care of (...) must be
recommended to them, and obser^ed in them.x. in their Feeding, that through
^rediness they eat or drink nothing that is ^asty. 2. in their Body, head hands
feet and ^lothing; that they keep themselves from ^ilthiness of sweat, from
vermin and other ^ncleanness. 3. in their Chamber, that they ^efile it not
with stench, or suffer it to be un^wept; but that they keep it clean and sweet
with refreshment of air.

Concerning the Forming of their Manners.
Godliness and Bodily Health are absolutely ^ecessary; the one for spiritual,
and the other for their temporal Felicity: Next unto these two, to make up
and perfect the ^tate of their Happiness; Care must be taken of their Manners.
by which word I under^tand their outward life, as well in respect of ^he Actions
which they do, as in respect of their Carriage and behavior in performing ^he
same: that those may be Just and Honest; ^his, Civil and unblameable. For, good
Manners, in this sense, are far to be preferred unto all Humane Learning of
what kind soever; because without Moral Honest^ all the perfection of Learning
is nothing els^ but an Instrument of wickedness to increas^ and aggravat the
miseries of Mankind: whera^ without Learning this alone with Bodi^^ health is a
sufficient ground to partake (...) temporal Felicity.

And because in the ordinary Schools the Care is wholly neglected and the youth
(...) left to habituat it self to its Corrupt inclina^tions, while their wits
are sharpened a^^ exercised in all the subtilties of Humane A^^^ and Sciences;
therefore Satan does fortify (...) strong holds by these within them, to ma^^
them impregnable: and their Spirits (as (...) find by doleful experience in
these times) a^ heighthned to that degree of unconscion^bleness in Deceit*
Mischief and Malice, th^^ nothing in former ^ges can be compar^^ thereunto.
which should make us so much (...) more careful to rectify this evil in o^^
Scholars, by how much it is neglected (...) others, and destructive to all.

The way then to Reform our Scholars this matter, and the Care to be taken of
the^ should have two parts. The one should rel^^ unto the Inward Principles of
Morality; (...) work the true Impressions thereof upon the ^pirits. The other
should relate unto their Out^ard behavior and carriage toward their
^eighbour, to make it decent and without ^ffence. and the first of these cannot
be ^ightly taken up without the last, because without the observation of their
unseemly ^ehaviour and offensive Carriages; a disco^erie can not be made of the
diseases of their ^ules, that the Remedies of wholesome In^tructions,
Admonitions and Corrections ^ay be applied thereunto. This then is the
Masterpiece of the whole Art of education, ^o watch over the Childrens
behavior in their actions of all sorts, so as their true in^linations may be
discovered; that the inward ^auses of their vicious disposition and di^tempers
being found out* the true and pro^er Remedies thereof may be applied unto them.
And this is to be the subject whereof ^he Governor and Ushers are to have
daily Conference every night: that upon the parti^ular discoveries of the
several inclinations ^f their Scholars by the qualities of their ^nruliness;
they may judiciously determine that to do with them, and how to proceed ^owards
them, to reform that which is amiss. ^here we conceive this study should
con^aine these endeavors.

First, to discern the proper Character of ^very Child's humor by his
behavior; to discover the predominant quality thereof, and what is good, and
what is evil in it.

Secondly, to contemplate rationally the inward disposition and frame of his
spirit; to find out the Principles, by which he is led, and from whence that
humor and behavior does arise; and the Impressions of virtu^ whereof he may
be made capable.

Thirdly, to determine the way how to de^ with him; that is, not only how to
corre^^ his outward visible misbehaviours; and (...) encourage him in that
which is good and decent: but how to make him sensible, and rationally
apprehensive of the true ground^, both of the correction, and encouragement.

Here again I conceive their study m^ run in these Channels.

First, what peculiar Restraint to lay upon them, lest they get a custom in
that whi^^ is evil.

Secondly, what Rational Maxims, an^ Rules of Morality to infuse unto them,
a^^cording to the degree of their Capacity, a^^bent of their inclination in
that which ^ good.

Thirdly, how to ingraft those Rationa^ Maxims and Rules upon the Main
Princi^ples of Godliness; that their spirits may (...) raised, and their
resolutions exalted to (...) things Morally Just and decent, not on^^ because
they are found in reason to be so, but because they who do them, are bound in
Conscience through Love and fear toward God to do all things as in his
presence, with ^elight and care to do always that which is well pleasing in
his sight. So that all Moral Actions to free them from Hypocrisy, and make
them truly virtuous; that is, without ^ll Leaven of pride and self-seeking
(which will mix themselves with spiritual actions ^lso, if care be not taken
to set our heart ^right) must be reduced unto the grounds of Christianity; and
made conformable unto ^he life of Christ; by comparing our way, and our mind in
following him, with his way and his mind in walking before us amongst ^hen
toward God. And except their educa^on by the Reformation of their Manners
fi^ally tend and result unto this; it will avail them nothing toward the
salvation of their ^^uls; it will only make less them hurtful unto the
society of mankind.

Now the particulars which are subordinat unto this Care and study are
innumerable; ^ut yet certain general Rules may be pru^entially set down,
according to which, they ^ould be limited and directed to order their
Conversation and behavior toward the ^ds aforesaid, and by which, those that
watch ^ver them should take notice of their ways and give an account thereof
unto the Governor of which Rules it will suffice at this time to give these
Heads.

First, laws are to be published amongst them concerning their very looks,
their angry words, and their hasty actions, proceeding from passion, and
tending to the breach of Christian Love; forbidding the same under the notion
that they are contrary to the life of Christ.

Secondly, Rules and Directions (leading them to the practice of Justice,
Equality, Meekness, Humility, Love and Liberality; an^ to the hatred of
Iniuriousness, Pride and Covetousness) are to be published, and hung (...) in
their Chamber and School, and made familiar and plain unto their Capacity and
Memory.

Both these sorts of laws may be gather^ out of Salomons Proverbs for the main
substance thereof, and from other Scriptures* and so be delivered as the will
of God un^ them, to oblige their Conscience thereunto.

Thirdly, the law of watchfulness (which they ought to have over themselves for
the ob^servation of these Rules) is not only to (...) taught them; but some
that are more stay^ then others, and better set, are to be man Monitors of the
rest, and besides the Monitor^ Spies are to be appointed to oversee them: an^
^n Cases of gross failing, after due admonitions, some exemplary punishments
of shame and smart may be used, that all may fear.

Fourthly, the great law of Truth and of Faithfulness (to suppress the
baseness of Lying and of Deceitfulness in words, Promises and Actions) is
above all other Rules to be prescribed and pressed upon them in their dealings
toward one another: and special care is to be had to observe the practice
thereof.

And, that the lying and deceitful spirit may be hunted out from amongst them;
a special reward is to be proposed unto every one that shall, upon due
admonition of his neighbor before witnesses, discover to the Usher any matter
of falsehood practiced by any. For, nothing does more inwardly corrupt the
spirit, then a course of falsehood; nor does any thing more deeply discover the
wickedness of the heart and want of true virtue, then this.

Fifthly, the Civilities to be used toward Strangers, to receive and
entertain them courteously; to be generously affected toward them, and the
way to maintein the Principles, and Practices of public Spiritedness without
ostentation and vainglory, should be described and taught them.

Sixthly and Lastly, the seemly way to carry their Bodies, to look upon people
stayedly and freindly in their salutation and conversation with them should be
made known unto them by Example and Rule.

Concerning all which Directions, how to propose, and apply them, toward the
corrupt dispositions of Children to rectify the same; the Ushers themselves
are to be taught their Duty, what to observe in them, and how to proceed in
dealing with them. and (...) must be the Governors great and special care to
see the Ushers well principled and practiced in this way, for, upon their
ability, faithfulness, and diligence all depends.

Concerning their Proficiencie in Learning.
The last and least part of true education is only minded in the ordinary
Schools, and that in a very superficial and preposterous way; for Children are
taught to read Authors and learn words and Sentences before they can have any
notion of the Things signified by those words and sentences, or of the Authors
strain and wit in setting them together: and they are made to learn by hear^
the General Rules, sentences, and Precep^ of Arts, before they are furnished
with any matter whereunto to apply those Rules an^ Precepts. And when they are
taught these things wherein Reason is to be employed, they are lead into a Maze
of subtle and unprofi^able Notions; whereby their minds are puffed ^p with a
windy conceit of knowledge: their ^ffections taken off from the plainness of
^sefull Truths; their natural Corrupt incli^ations to pride, vain glory, and
conten^iousnesse not reformed, but rather strength^ed in perversitie; So that
they become ^oth unwilling to seek, and incapable to ^eceive any Truth either
Divine or Humane ^n its simplicity: for their heads are filled ^ith certain
terms and empty shows of ^earning; which neither contain any sub^tance or
solidity of Matter; or give them any ^ddresse by way of Method to make use of
that which they know for the benefit of Mankind.

Now, to Rectify this cause of our Igno^ance and Disorderliness which has
taken ^ossession of all Schools and Universities, and ^ath spread it self over
all matters of Humane Learning; we shall endeavor to seek out the ^rue Method
of teaching Sciences, by the Grounds and Rules which, we hope, none, that is
Rational and free from prejudice, will Contradict.

Concerning the Grounds and Rules of teaching Sciences.
We take this to be the fundamental and undeniable Maxim of all Order to be
kept i^ teaching of Sciences, and educating of youth unto any part of Learning:
Viz. That the whole way of his Undertaking must be mad^ answerable unto the
nature of the End, an^ proportionat unto the property of the Meane^ and Parts
of Learning: and whatsoever i^ not subordinat unto that, and proportion^ unto
these, is done irrationally and unprofi^tably toward the advancement of
Lear^ning. The Grounds therefore from when^ we shall gather all our Rules to
direct us i^ the true Method of profiting, are Three; the first, concerning the
End; the scond, concer^ning the Means; the Third, concernin^ the Parts of
Learning.

Concerning the End of Learning.
The true End of all Humane Learning ^ to supply in our selves and others the
defect^ which proceed from our Ignorance of the n^^ture and use of the
Creatures, and the diso^^derliness of our natural faculties in usi^ them and
reflecting upon them.

From this Truth follow these Rules ^ Teaching.

1. That nothing is to be counted a Mat^ of true Learning amongst men, which is
n^ directly serviceable unto Mankind towar^ ^he supply of some of these
defects, which de^rive us of some part of our natural Hap^iness.

2. That if any does Teach or Learn any ^cience for any other end but this; he
does by the false end, which he proposes to him^^lf in Teaching or Learning)
pervert the Truth either of the Science, or of the Method ^ereof, or of both:
by which means, the ^emedie of our disease being spoiled; he ma^eth so far
as in him lies our sickness in^rable.

3. That none ought to be taught any ^atter of science, before he does
understand ^e true end, wherefore he is to learn it, and ^ow he ought to use
it* toward that end: for ^ he be ignorant of these two, he will not ^nly lose
his labor; but may become hurt^ll to himself and others by his knowledge. ^or
as a thorn goes up into the hand of a ^unkard; so is a parable in the mouth
of fools. ^rov. 26.9. And at the best he will be un^rviceable and
disproportionat to others in ^s walking thereby: For as the legs of the ^me are
not equal, so will a parable be in the ^outh of a fool Prove. 16.7. Now, he is
a ^ole who knows not the end and use of ^e things which he has.

4. That to marshall sciences rightly, that they ^ay be taught orderly and
profitably; The subordination of their several ends to eac^ other (as they
jointly relate unto man to sup^ply his defects) and the way of teaching the
same (as it is suitable to the Capacity of thos^ that are to be taught) must be
observed: so if these things be not observed; either the sciences will be made
useless to each other, o^ all of them, to him that is taught. For, ho^ can he,
that teaches them, benefit his Scho^lars thereby? For the Encyclopedia of
Scienc^ must answer the whe^l of humane faculty and this wheel must answer the
Circle of the Creatures whence man is to supply his d^^fects. As then in a
watch, one wheel right set, does with its teeth take hold of another and sets
that a work toward a third; and all move one by another, when they are (...)
their right places for the end for which (...) watch is made: so is it with the
Faculties (...) the humane nature, being rightly ordered (...) the ends for
which God has created the^ but, contrariwise, if the wheels be not right set,
or the watch duly wound up; it is useless ^ him that has it; and so it is with
the Facult^ of Man; if his wheels be not rightly order and wound up by the ends
of Sciences in the subordination; leading him to employ ^ same, according to
his Capacity, to make ^ of the Creatures for that whereunto (...) has made
them; he becomes not only usele^^ ^ut even a burden, and hurtful unto himself
and others by the misusing of them.

Concerning the Means of Learning.
The true Means by which all Humane ^ciences are attainable, are three, and no
^ore: The First, is Sense; the second, Tradi^on; the third, Reason.

Sense is the first, because it conveighs unto ^ur Imagination the shapes and
images of all ^ings, which memory does keep in store, that ^eason may make use
thereof. nor can any Tradition be entertained with profit, but ^at, whereof the
Imagination has received ^om Sense the original representations.

Tradition is the second, because it is no^ing else, but a Communication of
those ^bservations which others have made of the ^reatures, whereby our want of
knowledge ^ them is supplied. For we ought, To En^ire of the former Age, and be
willing to ^ake search of their Fathers; because we are ^ut of yesterday and
know nothing, and our ^yes upon Earth are a shadow. Job. 8.8, 9.

Reason is the third and last Means of ^umane Learning, because it makes use of
^ the reports of our Senses, and of other ^ens Tradition; and without these it
can ^ake no inferences to enlarge knowledge, or teach us the right use of
Creatures for necessary occasions.

From the subordination of these Means to one another, and their properties to
advance us unto Learning; we shall gather these following Rules of teaching
Arts and Sciences.

1. The Arts or Sciences which may be received by mere Sense should not be
taught any other way: for it is no wisdom to make work to our selves: Frustra
fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora.

2. Whatsoever in any Art or Science can be made obvious unto Sense, is first
to be made Use of, as a Precognition unto that which is to be delivered by way
of Traditionall o^ Rational precept.

3 As in Nature Sense is the servant of Imagination; Imagination of Memory;
Memory of Reason: so in teaching Arts and Sciences we must set these Faculties
a work in this Order toward their proper Objects in every thing, which is to
be taught: whence this will follow, that as the Faculties of Man's soul
naturally perfect each other by their mutual subordination: so the Arts which
perfect those Faculties should be gradually suggested, and the Objects
wherewith the Faculties are to be conversant according to the Rules of Art
should be offered in that Order, which is answerable to their proper ends and
uses and not otherwise: for the proportion of every thing to its own end, does
determine the order and place wherein we are to make use of it: for nothing is
truly Useful, but as it is, in its natural place.

4. As Childrens Faculties break forth in them, by degrees to be vigorous with
their years and the grouth of their Bodies; so they are to be filled with
Objects whereof they are capable, and plied with Arts: whence follows that
while Children are not capable of the Acts of Reasoning; the Method of filling
their Senses and Imaginations with outward Objects should be plied: Nor is
their Memory at this time to be charged further with any Objects then their
Imagination rightly ordered and fixed, does of it self impresse the same upon
them. Moreover hence follows, that no General Rules are to be given unto
any, concerning any thing either to be known or practiced according to the Rule
of any Art or Science; till Sense Imagination and Memory have received their
Impressions concerning that whereunto the Rule is to be applied; and so far as
those faculties are stored with matters of Observation, so far Rules may be
given to direct the mind in the use of the same and no further. Lastly hence
follows, That the Arts or Sciences which flow not immediately from particular
and sensual objects, but tend immediately to direct the universal Acts of
Reasoning, must be taught after all the rest: because their Use is to Regulat
that, which is to make Use of all the rest, viz. the Rational faculty;
therefore it is a very absurd and preposterous Course to teach Logic and
Metaphisicks before or with other Humane Sciences, which depend more upon Sense
and Imagination then Reasoning.

Concerning the Parts of Learning.
The Parts of Humane Learning wherein Children are to be exercised are first the
grounds and precepts of profitable Arts and Sciences. Secondly, the Tongues
which are most useful to enlarge the knowledge thereof.

By profitable Arts and Sciences, we mean all matters of knowledge which
direct man to the right use of all Creatures, and the ordering of his own
Faculties about them.

The Tongues which are ordinarily most useful to enlarge the knowledge of
these Arts and Sciences, are Latin and Greek; and that which in an
extraordinary way will in due time be useful heerunto, is Hebrew, and the
other Oriental Tongues which are a kin unto it.

Concerning these parts of Learning, we lay down these Maxims as grounds of
teaching the same.

1. Arts and Sciences are immediately useful by themselves to restore the
defects of our nature by the Creatures.

2. Tongues are no further finally useful then to enlarge Traditionall
Learning; and without their subordination unto Arts and Sciences, they are
worth nothing toward the advancement of our Happiness.

3. The Immediate Use of Tongues is only to Understand what others say to us,
according to their custom of speaking; and to express our mind unto them
significantly according to our custom.

From these Maxims we gather these following Rules of Teaching.

1. The teaching of Arts and Sciences ought not to be suspended upon the
teaching of unknown Tongues, but made familiar unto the childrens capacity in
their Mother Tongue first; and afterward enlarged by the Use of other Tongues.

2. The Arts and Sciences which lead us most directly unto the Use of the
creatures without any reflection upon our own Faculties are first to be taught;
because they may be taken up by the simple Acts of Sense, Imagination and
Memory, without much Reasoning.

3. The Arts and Sciences which lead us to reflect upon the use of our own
Faculties, are not to be taught, till we are fully acquainted with their proper
Objects, and the direct ^cts of the Faculties about them.

4. The knowledge of Tongues is the proper effect of Memory, and not of any
Reasoning ability, because they depend upon the Observation only of that which
is the constant custom of people; and not upon any rational inducement why
they do so. whence follows. 1. That those things which are most helpful and
subservient unto memory, are to be set a work in teaching Languages; rather
then those that employ the Judgment. 2. That the ways which fix and order the
Imagination most effectually toward the sound of the words and the thing
signified thereby, are most advantageous to this way of teaching. 3. That the
teaching of words, is no further Useful then the things signified thereby are
familiar to the Imagination, and that the teaching of Rules before the
Material sense of the words is known, or before the formal coherence of
things which their construction is to represent in a Sentence, can be
apprehended; is wholly preposterous and unprofitable to the Memory.

5. So far as children are capable of Traditionall knowledge: so far in
every degree of Science they may be taught the Tongues which serve for that
Use; but till they be fitted for the one, the other is Useless to them.

6. Whatsoever in the teaching of Tongues does not tend to make them a help
unto Traditionall knowledge, by the manifestation of Real Truths in Sciences,
is superfluous, and not to be insisted upon, especially toward Children.
whence follows that the Curious study of Criticismes, and observation of
Styles ^n Authors, and of strains of wit, which speak nothing of Reality in
Sciences, are to be left ^o such as delight in vanities more then in Truths.

From these Maxims and Rules the Ra^ionality of the ensuing Method may be made
^ut to the full, if time did permit; but we shall ^ot insist upon that now:
only we shall show that by them we are led to teach and consider ^atters of
Learning in this Order.

First, to consider the Children that are to ^e taught; Secondly, the Things
which are to ^e taught unto them; Thirdly, the Manner and way of teaching the
same.

Concerning the Children; we must reflect upon their ordinary Capacities, and
distin^uish the same into their natural degrees.

Concerning the Things which are to be ^aught; we must reflect upon a twofold
pro^ortion therein* first, we must find out that which is proportionat to the
degree of every ones Capacity. Secondly, we must order every thing which is
suitable to each Capacity, proportionally to the end for which it is to be
taught, as in its proper place it is subordinat^ unto other things, which must
follow in the Course of Education.

Concerning the way and manner of teaching and proposing the same; we must
study by the properties of Things to be taught, to find all manner of
advantages; and according to circumstances determine the way which will bring
no loss of time, nor be wearisom^ and tedious to the Children, and which will
make the matters taught most easy for the^ apprehension, and delightful to
their affections in apprehending the same. For, I suppose that this Conclusion
in this matter is a^ firm, as any Mathematical Demonstration in other
matters. viz: If all degrees of Childrens Capacities be fitted with proper
Objects, if none of the Things, which any (...) their Faculties can receive, be
left untaugh^ if no time be lost in teaching, nor any thi^ offered before it be
seasonable, if that which is taught in the first place be not disiointe^ from
that which follows after, but made (...) step thereunto.

If all matters offered, by their conjunctio^ make him that receives them a
perfect man ^eading him without distraction to his true end: and if no servile
constraint be laid upon ^he inclination of him that is taught, by forcible
means to break his Spirits: but his af^ections raised to a delightful
willingness, to ^eceive that which is offered; by allurements and generous
insinuations readily.

If (I say) all these things be observed, in ^he Course of Teaching; then
little or nothing will be wanting, which can be wished ^or toward the
advancement of learning in ^his way, or can be prosecuted by rational
^ndevours and humane Industry.

Of the Ordinary degrees of Childrens natural Capacities.
Till a Child's tongue be untyed and confirmed in some measure to speak and
imitate ^he ordinary Sounds of speech; he is to be ^ounted an infant. and this
ordinarily is not ^ll Children be four or five years old: ^et, before this
time their Senses are awake, their Imagination is not idle; and therefore ^ught
to be exercised with some Objects fit ^r the framing of their Memory toward
^ture preparatives of Learning.

From the time of Infancy, till the age of ^entie; there are three different
degrees of ^apacities, which ordinarily show themselves in three periods of
years; from four or five, till eight or nine, is the first, from eight or
nine, till thirteen or fourteen, is the second* and from thirteen or fourteen,
till ninetee^ or twenty, is the third period of Capacity.

In the first of these periods, the Capacity of Children is none other but
Sense and Imagination, with the beginnings of Memory.

In the second, it is Imagination and Me^mory with the beginnings of Reasoning,
an^ now we count him past Childhood, and becomes a youth.

In the third, he is Capable of all the Acts (...) Reasoning, and of the
Principles of Judge^ment and Prudencie; whereby he ought t^ order himself in all
things aright toward God and Man. And when a Scholar (...) brought thus far,
he is not to be under Tutors any longer: and till he be brought th^^ far, he
is not safe, without some Tutori^^ and Discipline.

Concerning the Things to be taught to each degree of Capacity.
First, while a Child is capable of nothi^^ but what he receives by Sense and
upon t^^ similitudes of sensual Objects, by Imagination; nothing is to be
offered unto his Memo^ but what can enter in, by those doors. Here t^^ he is to
be taught.

1. To speak his Mother Tongue, di^tinctly.

2. To read his Mother Tongue readily, ^telligibly, and without any affectat
Chil^ish tone, with his own natural sound of ^peech.

3. To write his own Mother Tongue le^bly; or any other Tongue what soever, ^s
to the forming of any Letters after a Copye.

4. To draw all manner of Lines and Ma^hematicall Figures with a Ruler and
com^asses; and other Lines and Figures, which ^re the Rudiments of Painting to
represent ^he lineaments and features of things.

5. To know the signification of all Numericall Figures; and to observe by the
eye, ^are and hand, the differences of Things in re^^ect of their number, their
parts, their quan^^ties, their measures, their proportions and ^isproportions,
and the like.

6. To take notice of all Things offered to ^is Senses; to know their proper
names, to ^bserve their shapes; and to make circum^antiall descriptions thereof
by word of ^outh, and painting in black and white.

7. To mind, and repeat the things which ^re to be related unto him; which
should be ^he General Heads of the History of the ^orld; whereof the ground
work should be the Historical Cathechisme of the Bibl^ and the superstructure,
a description of t^ Parts of the world; of the Things that (...) therein; and
especially of the Nations of (...) earth; and the Chiefest Revolutions a^
Changes which are befallen to his own N^^tion since the beginning thereof.

These things ought to be taught unto Ch^^^dren before they come to any of the
Ushe^ belonging to the Association; for (none un^ eight or nine) ought to be
brought unto the^ except they be sufficiently qualified before th^^ age with
these endowments: and that the things may be taught sufficiently, as a
prepa^^^tive for their future education in Sciences; peculiar School should be
appointed as a N^^^sery not far from the place of the Soc^e^^ wherein Children
of this Age should be train^^ up according to the Directions which may (...)
given to that effect: and although the Gove^^nour should not be charged with
any peculi^^ inspection over them; yet he might be oblig^ to repair thither at
certain convenient ti^^ to help with Counsel, by conferring wi^ those that
should teach them these things, a^^ to oversee their way, and direct them chie^
in point of Manners; how to prevent e^^ Habits, and the Customs of perverse
incl^^nations, which then begin to take head an^ discover themselves: and for
want of d^prevention become ordinarily a great prejudice to their Education in
after times.

Secondly, from eight or nine, till thirteen or fourteen, a Child's Imagination
and Memory is thoroughly to be cultivated and exercised; supposing then, that a
Child can speak his Mother Tongue distinctly and readily, can read and write,
and has gotten a general view of all things, and is able to name that which
is obvious to his Sense by its proper name in his Mother Tongue: yet these
impressions and shapes of Things are like a Chaos or confused mass of notions
in his head. These now in the second Period of his Education are to be Ordered,
and his Memory so exercised about them, as to prepare him to entertain the
Traditionall and Rational Learning which in the third and last period of his
education is to be delivered concerning them. Here then the Children shall be
exercised.

1. In writing fair and readily; and in drawing the pictures of Things whereof
the Impressions are to be fixed in their Memories.

2. In observing all Things Natural and Artificial extant in the world,
whereunto their Imagination shall be ledd in a certain Method; to cause them
reflect orderly upon them, and observe in them their several kinds,
coherences, differences, parts, actions* properties, uses, and references unto
Man by Trades and Manufactures.

3. In Learning all the Names of the Things themselves and of that which does
belong unto them in Latin, in Greek and in Hebrew; which Tongues they shall
withal^ Learn to Read and write; and to Interpre^ so far, as their
experience in the observation of Things does go, and no further: For so far
their Janua's in each Tongue shall go and be offered to them pari passu, with
that which they have been taught to observe in the Things themselves.

4. In the Practical Parts of the Mathematics; wherein they shall be taught
(togethe^ with their Latin, Greek, and Hebrew names.)

1. The Geographicall Descriptions of the world, and of the Kingdoms thereof in
Globes and in plain Tables.

2. The Astronomicall descriptions of the Heavens, in Models, Globes and plain
Tables.

3. The Arithmeticall Rules of Addition, Substraction, Multiplication,
Division, the Reduction of Fractions, and the Rule of Proportions called the
Golden Rule, and no further.

4. The Geometrical Doctrine of Lines, Surfaces, Bodies, and the Rules of
Measuring the same, and showing their proportions, together with the
experimental way of Measu^ing Land, and the use of the Instruments be^onging
to that part of Mathematical studies.

5. In the observation of Husbandry and Gardening; of Fishing and Fouling; and
the general Rules thereof.

6. In the Anatomy of Man's Body by a Model and Picture of all his parts, with
their names in the Learned Tongues.

7. In the Summary knowledge of the History of the four Monarchies of the
world, and of their own Nation: together with a Brief of the History of the
Church since Christ's days.

8. In the Rudiments and necessary Rules of Grammatical constructions; so
far as may enable them to interpret their Janua's whereof they shall have
Learned the Single words with the observation of the Things themselves: and
these Rules in all the three Languages are to be given, first in that wherein
they agree; and afterward in that wherein they differ: and exercised in the
reciprocal Translations of their Janua's.

Thirdly from thirteen or fourteen, till ninteen or twenty; the things which
are to be taught them, and wherein they shall be exercised, are all the Useful
Arts and Sciences, which may fit them for any employment in Church and Common
wealth. Here then all the Means of Traditionall and Rational Learning are to
be set a foot; and to this effect they shall be taught their Gramma^ Rules more
exactly and fully then formerly* and brought to read Authors in all the
Sciences whereof they have gained the foundations; with directions how to
observe the Marrow, and Method of them; and out of them to gather to themselves
an Encyclopoedia. To this effect.

1. The Latin Authors of Agriculture Cato, Varro, Columella, may be put into
their hands by parcels, to be an enlargement unto that which they have already
been taugh^ concerning Husband^y

2. The Natural History of Pliny an^ Others, by choice parcels are also to be
perused by them; and brought home to wha^ they have formerly seen; together
which the Histories of Meteors, Minerals, etc.

3. In like manner some Models and book^ of Architecture, Enginry,
Fortification, Fireworks, Weapons, Military Discipline* and Navigation are to
be looked upon.

4. The Greek Authors of Moral Philosophy, Epictetus, ^ebes, Arrianus, Plato,
Xenophon, Plutarch; and some Latin Tract^ in this kind should be read by them;
and a^ account taken of their proficiencie thereby.

5. The Doctrine of Oeconomicks, of Civil Government, and Natural Justice and
Equity in the Laws of Nations should be offered unto them; as the grounds of
that Jurisprudentia whereof the sum is to be given out of the Institutions of
Justinian and Regulae Juris.

6. The Theorie of all the Mathematics, with the full Practice of that which
was deficient in their former Institution; where the Optics with the
Instruments belonging thereunto, and the Art of Dialing is to be entertained;
and in Arithmetic the way of keeping Accounts.

7. The Principles of Natural Philosophy and the main Grounds of Medicin,
with the Instruments of Distilling and other Chimicall Operations, and the Art
of Apothecaries, are to be offered unto them partly in books, partly in the
Operations themselves by an ocular inspection thereof, and of their drugges.

8. The Art of Surgery described in books, with an ocular inspection of all
their tools, and Compositions of plasters and ointments, and the use thereof.

9. The Rules of Logic, Rhetoric and Poesy; showing them first how to
Analyze Authors, and observe their Art of Reason and Utterance to persuade: and
then how to order their own thoughts and expression, to search out Truths and
to declare the same; Historically, Philosophically, Oratorically, Poetically.

10. Directions for the study of all Humane Histories and what to observe in
them, for the attainement of Wisdom and Prudencie in the Government of a man's
own life; where with the Directions to observe the ways of others; the Rules
of Judgment, Discretion, Prudencie and Civil Conversation to order their own
ways aright toward all, are to be given unto them which is to be concluded
with a special recognition and insight into Salomons Proverbs, and
Ecclesiastes. And so they are to be sent into the world to apply themselves to
any employment, or more particular study whereunto God shall call them. For now
they will be fitted thereunto so far as Humane Industry can advance them.

Amongst all these, I have not mentioned Music* Vocal and Isntrumental, by
it self, because it is a part of the Mathematics and the Practice thereof is
to be insensibly at spare times brought in use amongst them as a part of their
Recreations. Nor have I mentioned any Hebrew books which they should read;
because their daily reading of the Scriptures should be in Greek and in Hebrew:
and their Analyticall exercises should be employed for the most part in
resolving the Rationality of the Scripture about the most Material Doctrines
of Divinity. Nor have I mentioned any particular Body of Divinity to be put
into their hands; because I speak only of the Method of Humane Learning, how it
should be delivered; and no Divinity is to be taken up from the teaching of
men: it is to be received from the Holy Scriptures alone: and the daily
Catecheticall exercises and conferences which will be appointed for these of
this third period; will sufficiently by Gods blessing enable them in all the
Truths of Divinity both Theoreticall and Practical; so that there will be no
need of any other Institution in that kind.

Thus I have done with all the Matters which are to be taught to each degree of
Capacity within the period of the years appointed for their education: now
follows the Last point of this Method; how all this is to be taught and
expedited within the time appointed with ease and delight.

Concerning the Manner and way of Teaching all these things, to Each Capacity.
In the Manner of Teaching, experience will bring the way unto perfection, if
it be prosecuted, according to the Maxims, and Rules heretofore mentioned, in
a Constan^ Course. And to be able to put the design in Practice; three main
things must be ordered: first the taskes of both the lesser and the greater
parts of the work must be determined according to times and seasons; what and
when every thing is to be done.

Secondly, the way of proposing to the Scholars that which they are to
receive, and of entertaining them to dwell upon it, till it be fixed in their
minds, must be regulated.

Thirdly, the means and instruments whereby, all taskes are to be performed on
all hands, both by those that propose, and those that receive and entertain
Learning, are to be had in a readiness and ordered for Use.

Concerning the Taskes what and when every thing is to be done.
Solomon tells us, that There is a season to every thing, and a time to every
purpose under the heaven; Eccles. c. 3. v. 1. and v. 11. and that God has made
every thing beautiful and consequently, delightful and acceptable, in its
proper time. If then we can discern this time, and determine the work to be
done in it we shall find success in it, and that with ease.

In the first Period, from five till nine; an Order of taskes must be observed
in the preparatorie School, as well as in the other following. but now we shall
not speak thereof, because we suppose that such a School cannot be had
speedily; and that we must take such Scholars at first as can be had, till
Schoolmasters be trained up who shall be able to follow the Directions which
may be given for the training up of Children in such a Nursery.

In the second Period, from eight or nine, till thirteen or fourteen, we have
five years, to bestow upon the Objects of Learning which are proper to that Age
and Capacity, whereof the Perfection is nothing else but Memory. These five
years shall be divided into three parts, whereof the first and second shall
each comprehend two years; and the third, one.

In the first part (that is in the two first years of this period) they shall
be led through all the Objects of Fancy and Memory belonging to that Period in
the Method; which shall be prescribed unto the Ushers: and to every thing which
shall be showed them by their Ushers; the Latin and Greek names shall be added
and commended unto their Remembrance. so that here, in these two first years
they shall be obliged to run over all the taskes of the whole period, to take
up the Ideas thereof, and keep them in memory with their two Learned names
only. And to that effect, in the first quarter of the first year, they shall be
diligently exercised in writing the Latin and Greek characters fair and
readily; and in copying out some Pictures, and the Figures of Models of Things.

Then in the last quarter of that year, when they are stored with almost the
half of the words of those two Tongues; the Rudiments of the Grammatical Rules
of both Tongues are to be taught them, so far as to help them, to make use of
their Janua's therein; which from that time forward they shall be made to ply
diligently, till toward the end of the sccond year; then about the last
quarter thereof, they shall be taught to write Hebrew fair and readily. and
when they have attained to some perfection heerin, the Rudiments of the Hebrew
Grammar also shall be taught them, so far as it does agree with that which
they formerly learned of the Latin and Greek Grammars.

In the second part of this period (that is in the third and fourth years
thereof) the same taskes which formerly were taken in hand and prosecuted shall
be renewed by the same Method of leading them through all the Objects belonging
to the whole period the second time, only with a twofold difference: first,
that to the Latin and Greek names of Things which were formerly taught and now
are to be repeated, the Hebrew shall be added. Secondly, that in this second
course of observa^ion they shall descend to some things more ^articularly in
every Object, then they did in ^he first course; and in a way more exact and
^istinct: whereby they shall be taught to look upon every thing so, as to take
up the notion ^hereof orderly in four things when they once ^ave gotten the
General shape thereof in their minds. The First is, to look upon the parts
^hereof, and know their distinct names in the ^earned ^ongues. The second is,
to look upon the properties of those parts and ^he form o^ frame of the whole
arising from thence. The third is, to look upon the Action or Passion or
fitness to Action or Passion which arises from that frame and properties of
the whole and parts. And the Fourth, is to look upon the usefulness which ^he
thing, with the parts, properties and ^ctions thereof, has toward man. When
^very Object formerly observed in the bulk shall be thus reviewed in these
particulars, and the chief names formerly not mentioned added thereunto; the
second course of this period will be also finished: whereof at this time, this
only is further to be added; that, at the latter and of the third year, and the
beginning of the fourth, the Grammatical precepts are ^ully to be delivered in
each Tongue in respect of their differentiall properties, which thenceforth are
to be taken notice of in the Use of their Janua's.

In the third and last part of this Perio^ (that is in the fifth year thereof)
they shall r^^peat all what in the four former years the^ have learned: but
Chiefly the Addition^^ part of Learning, which the second Cou^^ had, more then
the first; that is, their He^brew Janua; the particularities, to be^ taken
notice of, in the Observation of all Sensu^^ objects, and the Grammatical
differen^^ in the Constructions of the three Tongues.

In the third Period of Learning, from thi^^teen or fourteen, till nineteen or
twenty; (...) have six years to bestow upon the Traditionall and Rational
ways of Teaching (...) Sciences: those years also shall be divided in^^ three
courses, and to each course two year^ shall be allotted.

In the first course of this third Period, a^ the Sciences belonging thereunto
are to be de^livered Historically, which may be done thr^^ ways. First, by way
of ocular Demonstra^tion in things that can be showed unto Sen^^ in every
Science, whose subject has any thin^ of Sense in it. secondly, by way of
Schemes a^^ Pictures to represent Hieroglyphically the^ things that have no
visible shape; and fo^^mally those things which have a real shape but are not
at hand to be seen and shewe^ unto sense. And thirdly, by way of Narratives and
Relations, expounding both tha^ which is showed unto Sense, and that which is
offered unto it in Pictures and Schemes, whether Hieroglyphically or Formally.

In this Course (besides their Janua's which are to be repeated) the easiest of
the Latin and Greek Authors which handle the Sciences (whereof the Ideas have
been offered unto them) are to be read by them according to the Directions
which shall be given: and after the first year of this course (or sooner as
upon trial shall be found expedient) their speech shall be wholly Latin* and
to begin to translate some remarkable passages of Greek Authors into Latin,
and of Latin Authors into Greek; shall be one of their exercises.

In the last quarter of this course (or in the last half year as experience
shall direct) the grounds of Logic shall be taught them so far as to let
them see. 1. What the faculty of Reason is in man, and wherein it does differ
from Imagination and Memory. 2. What the Use thereof is in all Sciences. 3.
What the Acts thereof are, in making up many single thoughts into Propositions;
and of many Propositions said together to draw thence Consequences. 4. How that
these Acts are to be taken notice of, and observed in the Authors which they
have read who write of Sciences; in whom they shall be taught to Analyze some
of their Rational Propositions and consequences. Thus the first course of thi^
period shall be ended.

In the second course (that is, in the third and fourth year) of this Period,
all the Sciences belonging to the whole Period shall b^ taught Dogmatically;
that is, the Rules and Precepts thereof shall be delivered, according to that
Order wherein they are subservient unto the Necessities of Man, and branch
themselves out one upon another; the latter growing up from the Principl^s of
the former; an^ all tending to make the Creatures serviceable unto Mankind; or
to rectify his disorders within himself. In this Dogmaticall course of
Sciences, toward the latter end of the first year thereof (that is, in the
last quarter of the third year of this period of Education) the Precepts of
Logic shall be fully taught, first the Analyticall, and then the Geneticall
way of Reasoning, to find out Truths which are doubtful, and toward the
latter end or the middle of the second year thereof, the Precepts of Oratory
and Poetry shall be taught them; and they directed to observe in the Authors
which they have already perused, how those Precepts have been put in Use by
them, that they may learn to imitate their practice.

In the third course of this period, that is, in the two last years thereof;
all the Sciences belonging to the period shall be taught Practically, that is
they shall be exercised in the practice of all that which they have been
^aught, in the whole former Course of their education: and they shall be put
upon the occasions of making Use of their skill in every Science for their own
and others advantage, and the improvement of the ways of learning: and here as
their Genius shall lead them, they shall be left a little larger scope to
follow it: either in ways of Action, or of Theorie, or of Utterance: in the
first year of this course they should be exercised and put upon the practice of
all; but in the last year, according as their Faculty should be found most
eminent (with some few Directions and Manuductions to Improve it) they should
be suffered to apply it to the subject which amongst all the Sciences they
should like best to exercise themselves in. And in the latter end of this year,
that is, in the last quarter thereof, having received such Directions for the
future Government of their life as will be found necessary to order it
Judiciously and Prudently; they may be dismissed to take some Public Service
in hand; or follow some private Calling which the Commanwealth does stand in
need of.

And thus I have reckoned up the main and general Taskes, as they are to
answer the years; the subdivision thereof into months, weeks, days and hours
will not be difficult; and needs not now to be insisted upon, but must be
delineated before we set upon the work it self. We come now to speak in brief
of the way of proposing those Taskes unto the Scholars, and of their way of
entertaining their thoughts about them.

Concerning the way of proposing all the parts of Learning unto the Scholars,
and of their entertaining the same, to fix their minds thereon.
The way of proposing matters of learning is as considerable as any thing else
in the work of Institution; and next unto that is the way of entertaining that
which is proposed: the first of these is the proper work and industry, of the
Governor and Ushers; the second, of the Scholars themselves, although the
Ushers also may and ought to have some hand therein.

For the proposal of every thing, the Governor shall prepare the particular
matters of every thing which shall be taught for every hour of the day,
throughout the whole course; and deliver the same in writing Quarterly, or
Monthly (at least) beforehand unto the Ushers; that they may be in full
readiness and perfectly exercise themselves in every thing which they shall
deliver to their Scholars ^^d the Matters should be thus long predeter^ined
before hand, and given to the Ushers, ^at if upon good grounds they shall
suggest ^y thing to the Governor for an alteration ^^ that, which he shall
have prescribed; it may ^^ in time considered between them, and ordered as need
shall require, or found most ^xpedient.

The Matters to be proposed being thus ^repared, when the time comes to offer
them ^ the Scholars; the Governor shall for every ^ifferent kind of exercise
and Institution give Directions unto the Ushers, how to behave themselves
toward the Scholars, to make them affectionat toward the task which is ^o be
offered unto them, that is, attentive and ^reedy to receive it: and to make
them more ^erfect in following the Directions and Rules which in this nature
shall be given: he shall himself give them an example of the Practice ^f it
toward the children; showing them, at ^very change of exercise and different
way of Institution, how they should go about their work: he shall therefore
teach the first lesson of every kind himself in the presence of his Ushers,
that they may observe his way: and at the second lesson, when they shall
begin their work; he shall be present at it, to observe them how they
perform it, and tell them of their faults if any be committed.

Two things are fundamentally to be hee^ in the Manner of proposing every
thing: Fir^ that the Scholars before the thing be prop^^sed be made sensible
of the End, wherefore it taught them, and they ought to learn it, (...) what
the necessity, use, excellency and pe^^fection thereof is in the life of Man
etc. S^^condly, that the way of offering it unto the be the same at once to
all, by all alike percep^ble, common, plain, distinct and orderly every part.
And to these two fundamental whereof the first relates unto the Will, t^
second, unto the Understanding; a third (...) be added relating to the Memory,
which (...) that in the Method of proposing every thing this Rule be observed.

Let the General notion of every Object or the shape of the whole; be first
offered (...) the Imagination, and then the parts which a^ contained under it,
to be represented unto t^ thought by way of Division. and this being done; Let
the mind afterward be led retrograde to review the parts as they look to o^
another; and make up the whole by way (...) collection.

And at the conclusion of every lesson, ^ brief and summary Recapitulation of
tha^ which has been offered unto them is to be proposed; and the Question
should be aske^ whether any has a doubt of any thing? or ^ould have so^^^ king
repeated; or further ex^ained? that they should speak.

The way of enterteining that which shall ^e thus proposed is partly in the
Scholars by ^^emselves, partly in them together with their ^shers.

By themselves they shall entertain the things which have been taught them, by
the exerci^^s of writing, of painting, or drawing figures, ^f compendiating,
and of methodizing, as ^hey shall from time to time he directed; for ^e fixing
of their thoughts upon that which ^hey shall have received; and by the reading,
and understanding, and translating of their ^anua's, or of their Authors from
one Tongue to another, according to the way which shall be showed them.

Now, as the proposal of a lesson shall not ^st above half an hour at the
most; so the ^^ertaining of that which has been offered, ^all follow
immediately thereupon, for* the ^a^e of another half hour, so that to e^e^
lesson, a full hour, and no more shall ^e allotted; whereof the first part
shall be spent (...) receiving, the second, in entertaining the ^houghts
thereof.

The entertainment of things received together with the Ushers, shall be two
ways. ^. By showing the exercises wherewith they ^ertained their thoughts by
themselves. 2. By a constant course of Repetitions to b^ observed daily,
weekly, monthly, quarter^ and yearly; whereof particular Direction are to be
given in due time: but the gener^ Rule of proportion in all Repetitions to
(...) observed is this; that the third or fourth l^son, or period of lessons,
is always to be R^^petitorie in some degree or other; more less, as the
matter is more or less di^cult, and generally rather the third is to (...)
made Repetitorie of two, then the fourth (...) three: but experience will best
determ^ what is most expedient to be done in t^

Concerning the Means and Instruments w^ are to be had in a readiness, and
ordered for use, that these Tasks may thus be prosecuted on all hands.
THe things necessary to be made use of (...) bringing all this to pass, are
1. a co^nient House fitted with rooms, wherein (...) Scholars may be at their
exercises. 2. the sc^lasticall Furniture, and dressing of those roo^ 3. the
Books and other Implements, wh^ the Ushers and Scholars must have at ha^.

The House, where this course of educ^ should be intended, must not be within
(...) City, but should be near unto it, in a g^ air, large and spacious; and as
it were in (...) Country, with large gardens and orch^ ^ear the places of
tillage and of pasturage, that the Country may afford unto the Scho^rs the
aspect and observation of all Natu^all things, wherein they are to be taught,
and be City may afford them the sight of all ^rtificiall things; of all Trades
and Manu^ctures, wherewith they are to be made ac^uainted.

The Rooms wherein the Scholars should be (...) their exercises, should be
four: Three lesser ^nes, for each Usher and his peculiar Scholars ^ne, and one
large one; or father a Gallery which should be for common Use unto all.

The Scholasticall furniture and dressing ^f these rooms ought to be this.

The large common room ought to be fur^^shed with all manner of Mathematical,
Na^rall, Philosophical, Historical, Medicinal, ^ieroglyphicall and other
sort of pictures, ^aps, globes, instruments, models, engines, and whatsoever is
an object of sense in refe^nce to any Art or Science, these things ^e to be set
in their order, according as ^ey are subordinate unto several Sciences; ^^at
at the times appointed, the Ushers may ^ade their Scholars into it; to receive
the les^ns which they shall give them* upon the ^cular inspection of the
Things, which shall ^e showed unto them.

The lesser rooms each ought to be furnished with a high seat for the Usher;
that he m^ overlook all his Scholars, and with twen^ distinct places, so
ordered for the Schol^ to sit or stand in; that their fac^^ may ^e (...)
toward him: and each in his place may ha^ his own deck, to keep all his papers
and oth^^ things to be used in good order. In each ^ those rooms there should
be an iron forna^ or stove to keep it warm in the winter.

The Books which the Scholars shall have (...) the School shall be none but
such as th^^^ Usher shall put in their hands. In the seco^^ Period of
Institution, they shall have a ^ books but their Latin, Greek and H^^brew
Janua's, and the Bible of the Old (...) New Testament in these Tongues, and i^
their Mother Tongue. In the third Perio^ besides these books, they shall have
fr^^ time to time, such as their Usher by the G^^vernours direction shall
furnish them with and none other; nor any longer then thinks fit.

The Instruments besides pen, ink and ^^^per, shall be a pen or stick with
black lead* penknife, a pair of compasses, a ruler, s^ate; and some other
implements which f^^^ time to time shall be put in their hands, a^^ taught to
make use of according to the ^^^grees of their proficiency.

Of Teaching LOGIC.
BY Logic I understand the Art or skill, to make right use of our reasoning
Faculty. The faculty of Reason in man, is that ability, by which he can set
his thoughts in order to judge of all things, which are in his Imaginations.

As large then as the Imagination or Fancy of Man is, so large is the use of
Reason; that is to say, it does reach unto all things, that can be thought
upon, for all the thoughts of the heart of Man are contained under this notion
of Imaginations; whether they have an Idea or not expressly formed in the mind;
for some thoughts are negative to all Ideas. By an Idea I mean the shape and
representation of something which the mind does frame unto it self by the
Imaginative Faculty: for, the imaginative Faculty is like a looking-glass,
which being turned to any object whatsoever does receive the shape thereof, and
represents it to the eye of the Understanding: If then the understanding
Faculty does look upon the shapes of things, which are in the Imagination not
confusedly, but in an orderly way, to compare them and lay them together for
some purpose and aim, for which they are taken into consideration; then it is
said to proceed rationally; but if it has either no aim at all or no command
of its own thoughts or sk^^ to rule and order them to that aim, which (...)
does consider them for: then it does procee^ without Reason. Now because to
man, t^^ Faculty of Reasoning is that universal Light by which he is to guide
his ways in all particular objects as well of Meditation, as o^ Action;
therefore if this Light be darkene^^ in him, then all is nothing but darkness:
b^^ if the eye of his Reason be clear, then all i^ full of Light, which he does
undertake to Ac^ or Meditate. For this cause the Art of Reasoning as to Man, is
the chief of all other Arts and Sciences in humane things; for by i^ all other
Arts are found out; and whatsoever is amiss in them may be rectified: and
consequently to teach how to make use of that Reasoning Faculty, which we have
to some good purpose, is in all humane things, the matter of greatest
importance that can be thought: and yet such is the misery of our life, that
there is scarce any thing less minded; or when minded, less taught in a right
and profitable way. I shall not at this time intend to make this charge good
against the ordinary Teachers of Logic, who for the most part, are so far
out of the way of right Reasoning, that their very precepts are less^ ^^en
rational, and they themselves incapable (...) better Rules, till they be
wholly untaught ^^at which they have learned. But I shall (as ^^iefly as may
be, to be well understood) deli^^r my conceptions of the right way of teach^^g
young Scholars the Art of Reasoning by a ^ositive Method to direct them in it,
that in^^nd to teach others. I will suppose then, that young Scholar is brought
unto me, who is (...) puris Naturalibus (as we use to say) that (...), who is
capable of institution in this kind, (...) being no ways prepossessed with any
ha^its, which may make him unfit to receive ^he documents which are to be given
him: and as being only possessed with the com^on Notions of Natural things
which are ^he objects of humane Senses; and under^tanding no more, but the
proper sense of all ^he words of the Language, by which the Notions are
expressed in the common speech wherein he is to be taught. To such a young ^an
I first would deliver some common Pre^ognitions concerning Logic, and
afterward would exercise his Reasoning Faculty in the way of Meditation
whereof I should find him ^apable, growing upon him by degrees, till I should
make him master of the use of all his ^houghts, to all purposes, which he
should ap^ly them unto.

The Precognitions should bring him to consider himself.

1. That he has a Natural ability to think and meditate, as all other men
have.

2. That men of understanding are distinguished from fools by this, that they
ca^ make use of this Ability understandingly that is to say, that they
understand themselves what they do think and meditate, i^ what order and to
what purpose.

3. That therefore there is some way to order and direct the thoughts of the
mind: that they may not wander at random as fools thoughts use to do.

4. That this way to order and direct our thoughts, being taught and delivered
by certain Precepts is called the Art of Reasoning or Logic: and that he who
is exercised to follow the same is a Rational man or good Logician.

5. That of all other studies, this is the most worthy of a Man, most
profitable and most necessary to attain to the happiness of this life, so
far as by humane faculties it is attainable: and therefore, with most earnest
Affections and desires to be attended unto.

Having by such Preparations as these are, fitted his Understanding and raised
his Affections to docilitie and attention; I would begin to deliver unto him
some Precepts concerning the use of his first Notions, and single thoughts, to
reach him to take notice of them, what they are: not reflexively by the Term of
a second Notion (as the ordinary Logicians do, teaching their Scholars to speak
they know not what, nor to what use) but directly in the Terms of a single
Proposition, to cause him to take notice of the Subject and Praedicat thereof,
and of the conne^ion of each to other in a way Affirmative and Negative:
showing him that every word ^n our common speech, does stand for a single
^hought or Notion of the Mind, and that ^he words which we speak, should in
their order and coherence express the order and coherence of our thoughts.

Having then showed him what a single Proposition is, what parts it is made up
of; How these Parts are set together in our thoughts: what the Differences of
single Notions are; and of the ways of their set^ing together to make a
Proposition of them; and how a single Proposition does differ from ^ compound:
How a compound is made up of two, three or more single ones: and what ^he ways
of composition are, and their diffe^ences; and consequently, How many sorts ^f
Compound Propositions there are in our Notions to make up a Period of speech:
ha^ing, I say, showed him all this, not in abstra^o and Notionally, but by an
Example of very kind, and in concreto, as it were sensibly in the Period of
some discourse laid open to his thoughts, and analyzed before him; that they
may be as it were led by the hand to consider of it; then I would set him a
daily task of new Examples which he should be obliged to take into his
consideration, to Resolve Analytically by himself according to these Precepts,
which I should have given him concerning single and compound Notions and
Propositions; to the end that by thi^ exercise of his thoughts in Resolving the
ordinary Periodicall Discourses of Rational men into these Parts and Particles
of Pa^^^ whereunto they are Rationally Resoluble: he may be accustomed to
observe what use me^ make of their Notions single and compound to the extent of
one Period of their Discourses: Now whether the Notions which he i^ exercised
in be materially Rational or no; not at all material to his Instruction,
because in this first degree of Precepts, he is one^ taught to take notice of
the Difference (...) Notions, and of the frames wherein rhey a^^ set together,
in the expressions which ratio^nally men use or may be used, but wheth^^ they
be rightly used in this place, and in re^spect of such and such matter yea or
no, th^^ is not to be the object of his consideration^ this time, that is to be
taught afterward due time.

This being done I would proceed with him to the second degree of Precepts,
which should direct him to understand the use of his thoughts in matter of
Consequence, when one Proposition is drawn out of another and becomes a
conclusion arising from it. Here I would let him know what a Consequence is,
How many ways Consequences may be inferred from premises, and what the
Principles are, from which Consequences are raised, and by which they are to be
tried, and may be made Conclusions. In this part of the Doctrine as in the
former, I would show him by examples of every kind, how men of understanding
make use of their thoughts, analyzing their discourses wherein such Acts of
Reasoning are expressed, whereof he should have received Precepts; and then
according to the pattern of Meditation, which I should have given him in this
kind, I would oblige him to exercise himself by certain discourses containing
Principles and Consequences drawn from them in some Authors, which he should
be put to resolve, as to the matter of Consequentiall Inferences, and the Acts
of drawing Conclusions from Premises to observe; how these that use to
discourse rationally do order their thoughts and express the same to the
capacity of others.

Then the Scholar whom I should have taught these things, should in the third
place be directed to take notice of the Acts of Reason, which are employed
about the Apprehension of Arguments, and the relation of one thing to another
by the Notion of an Argument. Here then he should be taught what an Argument
is, How many differen^ sorts of Arguments there are in the use of Reason to be
laid hold on; what their different Relations are, and force of arguing, toward
that whereof they are conceived to be Arguments. This also should be laid open
to him by Precept and Example, and Practically in the Analysis of some
Discourse; or parcels of Discourse in an Author showed* How these that are
most rational make use of those Arguments in their Discourses* and when he
has been taught to observe these acts of Reason in an Author, he should be pu^
as at former times to analyticall Tasks to resolve the matter of some discourse
into the several Arguments which it contains, a^ they stand singly by
themselves, whereby he should be able upon examination to tell me where his
Author makes use of an Argument taken from the Cause, or from the Effect, or
from the Subject, or Adjunct, or the whole or the part, or contrary or
similitude* etc. and when he should be complete in this kind of Exercise, then
he should be brought to the fourth and last degree of Analyticall Doctrine,
which is to learn to consider the whole Body of a discourse, and to observe all
the Acts of Reason, which a man of understanding does make use of therein. Here
then he is to be taught what a Rational Discourse is, what is to be observed
in it. viz. the Subject whereof it speaks: the Scope and Purpose whereto it
speaks; the Parts whereof it is made up; their Coherence and Distinction, as
well in respect of the main Body, as of every particular member of this
Discourse, and the order of every thing contained in it, with a reference to
the matter and scope, that the whole wisdom of the Author may be discovered.
And to instruct him to observe all this in an Author I would Analyze a
Discourse to show him, How he should proceed in ordering his thoughts to
reflect upon all these things in his Author; and having both by Precept and
Example showed him what he ought to do: I would give him a task to exercise his
mind to do the like, and wherein he should fail, I would rectify him till he
should be complete in this Act, and use of his Reason also.

All this being done by these degrees of Analyticall Doctrine, and as it were
experimental manuduction of his thoughts to the Practice and use of Reason; I
would then bring him to exercise his Reason Genetically, that is by a way of
begetting an^ producing Notions within himself concerning a Subject which
should be given him to Meditate on Rationally. Here then he should be taught
what the Difference and use is of Analysis and Genesis: viz. that by the
exercise of the former we reflect upon the Acts of other men's Reasoning, and by
the exercise of the latter we stir up our own Faculty to make use of it, to
produce Acts answerable to the Rules which we have been taught. And to make him
complete in this way also, First the Precepts belonging to the way are to be
delivered, and then an Example of those Precepts is to be given, and according
to these Precepts and Example he is to be exercised, first to meditate upon a
simple thema. (as they call it) Genetically, and then upon a compound thema. By
a thema is meant a Matter of Meditation, which is either a single Notion or a
Proposition, either simple or compound: of which things it is needless now to
speak at large. The sum of all is this: that the Right use of Reason is to be
taught first in the Practice, before it be taught in the Theorie, and the
Analyticall way of Practice is to go before the Geneticall, and in this
teaching the several degrees of every Practice are to be observed, and in
every degree, whether the Precepts directing the to mind observe the Rules of
Practice, go before the Example which the Teacher is to propose; or whether
they follow the same as observations, to cause the mind reflect upon the things
to be imitated in the example, or whether some Precepts be given by way of
Praecognita before, or some by way of observation after the example; it is not
greatly material: if they never be separate, but go in their own degree of
exercise together, the one always giving light to the other, and both fitted
by the Prudencie of the Teacher to the capacity of the Scholar. And when the
use of Reason has been thus fully taught in a Practical way; then the
Scientificall and Notionall Precepts thereof are to be delivered reflexively
upon the Rules of Practice, which have been fully conceived. For the direct
knowledge must be proposed before the reflex be offered, because none can
reflect upon his way of knowing before he has attained it; therefore the way
of knowing Actually must be experimentally proposed, before the Theoreticall
way of apprehending matters be reflexively taught; which is quite opposite to
the Practice of those that teach Logic in an ordinary way: who deliver all
even to Children Reflexively and Scientifically: before they exercise them in
any point of Practice, except in that of a confused, endless, unprofitable way
of disputing about Notions which is falsely called Logic, by which means those
that should be made Scholars of Right Reason, are made habitually wranglers
about the Terms of an Art, which they never have been taught: and in stead of
making use of their Rational Faculty, to set it in a way to order their
Imaginations aright, they are only directed and exercised to subtilize their
Imaginations, and pride themselves in this mainly to have such conceptions, a^
are beyond the vulgar Capacity. As if to speak things in the air and out of
the common use were to be Rational: but of the original of these Abuses, of
the way, How men should be convicted of them and the means, How to rectify
them: and of the more special method of teaching the True Art of Reasoning in
all the degrees and Parts of the Practice and Theorie thereof; I hope I shall
at another time be able to speak more fully, when God shall give me better
leisure without distraction to elaborate such tasks as in this and other Kinds
lie upon my hand. In the mean while, take this as a taste of what may follow in
due time; both for the Illustration of this way by examples, and for the more
particular deduction of every thing belonging ^hereunto. I rest upon all
occasions of ser^ice in this or any other kind,

Your affectionate and Loving Friend and Servant in Christ JOHN DURY.

A COPY of Mr JOHN DURY'S Letter to SAMUEL HARTLIB.
Dear Friend,
I Am glad that the Directory for the Education of Children, and teaching of
Sciences is to your liking; I would be more glad if God would open it a way for
us to put in practice: and although nothing should be done therein by our
selves in these distracted times; ^et it may be a satisfaction to our minds,
that we have not been wanting ^o our generation, so far as God has ^nabled
us to trace the ways of doing ^ervice to the public; and that we ^ave not
buried our talents in the ^round, when opportunities have been offered to us to
employ them. You have told me once or twice at several oc^casions, that the
Discourses which Dr Kinner has sent you from beyon^ Seas tend wholly to the
same Sco^ which I have proposed to my self in the Directory which I have sent
you; an^ that my Conceptions are as it were (...) Abridgement of that which he
ha^^ written to you; as if I had read h^^ contrivement of matters; and take the
cream of his whole counsel. (...) is very possible that men of the sa^^
Judgment and Principles, setti^^ themselves to order one and the sam^ work,
though they never have confe^^red notions, may agree upon one a^^ the same way:
I am glad that (...) thoughts and his, though neither (...) us have had the
perusal of one an^^thers papers, or any communicatio^ with each other about
that subject, (...) so concur, as to confirm you in the way which is most
satisfactory to you^ judgment: you may say then to the ^orld; that you have
two witnesses to ^e and the same Truth, and way of Righteousness; and that Gods
Spirit, and ^ight Reason speaks the same thing in all ^en; in all the parts of
the world.

I shall be glad at a convenient time, (...) see those papers, whereof you say
I ^ave already given you the substance before I ever saw them: for I suppose
^hey will not only add to my thoughts upon that Subject; but perhaps give me
^ccasion to add something to him for ^he accomplishment of your desires, and
^he benefit of the Public, whereunto ^ou know I have dedicated my self; and
^herein by Gods grace shall persevere unto the end: I rest,

Your most affectionate and faithful Servant in Christ, JOHN DURY.

FINIS.
