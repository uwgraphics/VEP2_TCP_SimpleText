A Standard lifted up, And an Ensign held forth, to all NATIONS.
IN the name and power of the eternal God that made Heaven and Earth, and all
things therein; who is the life of all things, and the power by which they
stand in his counsel and fear. I do hereby declare my self unto the whole
world, and unto all people upon earth, that ye may all know the very certainty
of those things, which is reported abroad through many Nations, and that ye may
be informed truly concerning us, from our own mouth of many things which comes
to you by false reports and lying informations, concerning a people appeared in
these late years and raised up, going under the name of QVAKERS. Know ye
assuredly that we are of God, and are raised up by him and called by his Name,
and his dreadful presence goes before us, and his righteousness is our reward.
We are such as does fear and worship the true God that made Heaven and Earth in
the Spirit and in the truth, he has placed his Name amongst us, and made his
everlasting Covenant with us, and established it that it cannot be moved, he
has given us his Spirit and poured it upon us, and we are taught of him
according to his promise, and are established in his holy Mountain, where none
can make us afraid, for he has armed us with his power and strength to defend
us from all our enemies, that we should bear witness of his Name in all the
world, and declare unto all Nations, of his power and Dominion, of his
Salvation and Redemption, that is in Him and in his Son; of which we are made
partakers and witnesses, and by him have we received the heirship of the
everlasting inheritance, and we are of God; and he that is of God hears us,
whom the Father has chosen and redeemed out of kindreds, tongues and peoples,
to stand before the Throne of God and the Lamb, and we have sought, and do find
a City, whose builder and maker is God, and we are known to the Lord God
Almighty, and approved in his sight: Our light is the light of the Lamb, and
our government the government of Jesus, and our Law the Law of the most high,
and our way is the way of peace and truth, he that can receive it let him. This
is the Testimony which the Spirit of the everlasting Father witnesses in us,
and witnesses of us unto the whole world,

CHAP. I.
Concerning the true God, this testimony I give to all people upon earth.
THe true God he is a Spirit, and is infinite, eternal, and everlasting, the
Creator of all things, and the life and being of all things, and the power by
which all things stand, all creatures have a being in him, and by him, and
without him no creature is, or does move upon the face of the earth; this is he
whom we worship and fear, and does obey, and he brings to pass by his counsel
whatsoever he will and nothing can prevent the purpose of his mind, but his
counsel stands for ever and he is the righteous Judge of all things, and
before him must all mankind come to judgment, and the living and the dead by
him must be judged, he is a rewarder of every one according to their deeds,
whether they be good or whether they be evil: His Greatness, Power, Majesty
and Dominion is over all, and beyond all, ruling above all in the power of his
own will, and who may say what does he: his eye sees all, and his presence
fills all, and no creature can be hid from his sight; he is near at hand, and
afar off, he searches man's heart, and tries the reins, and shows unto man his
own thoughts, he justifies the righteous, and condemns the wicked, he is
light it self, and in him is no darkness at all: This is the true God whom we
worship, and this Testimony I give of him unto all people upon the face of the
whole Earth.

CHAP. II.
Concerning the Son of God, this testimony I give unto all the world.
THe Son of God, who is called Christ the Prince of peace and righteousness, he
is one with the Father in power and dominion, and was with him before the World
was, and by him the Father created all things, and without him was not any
thing made that was made, he is Heir of all things, and is the Prince of the
Kingdom of Righteousness, of Peace and Truth, and he is the word and power by
which all things does subsist, and is the Salvation of mankind, and the very
life of the word, he inherits life and immortality, and is the Redeemer,
Savior, Deliverer and Restorer of the Children of men, he is the very Wisdom
and Power of the Creator, and the Father does nothing without the Son, and by
him and through him the Father brings all things to pass, by him the Father
will judge the whole Earth, and all the Children of Adam therein; and this
Christ Jesus the Son of God, is the Life and Light of the world, and has
enlightened all mankind, every one that comes into the world is lighted by him
with the true light of life or condemnation, and what the same does, the Father
does also, and he is at his right hand exalted, and is the very express Image
of the Father, and is the Fathers gift into the world, and is given to all
mankind, that they may have life by him, and all that receives him has life
and salvation, but many receives him not, and they that receive him not
perishes, even because they do not receive him whom the Father has given into
the world, for he is the arm alone of Gods salvation, and he is the Leader of
his people.

CHAP. III.
Concerning the Spirit of God, this testimony I give unto the whole world.
THe spirit is with the Father, and with the Son, and is present every where,
and fills all places, and is for ever and ever, and tries all things, and
reveals the things of the Father and of the Son unto all that does believe
in the Son, and makes manifest, add searches into the deep things of God,
and it witnesses the salvation of the Just, and the condemnation of the
unjust, it is not absent from any place, nor contained in any one place, the
Father and the Son works all things through it, and brings all things in heaven
and earth to pass by it, and it works in the hearts of the Children of men, and
in every one it witnesses of the Father and of the Son, to the Justness,
Greatness, Righteousness, and to the power of the eternal Creator that made all
things by the Son through his eternal Spirit, which is one with the Father
and with the Son, and is the worker of their will and mind in all things, it
works in the wicked to reprove them, and to witness against them, and that
God is angry with them it shows; and it works in the Righteous, and
witnesses, the love, and mercy, and peace of the Father unto them, he that can
receive it let him, this is the testimony of the Spirit of God, and it leads
into all truth, and out of all evil, all that are guided by it, and it is
given to be the guide and rule of life to the Children of God.

CHAP. IV.
Concerning man and all mankind, this testimony I give unto all Nations and
Peoples.
MAn was created and brought forth in the Image of God, and was without sin or
evil brought forth to do the will of him that created him, and was Lord over
all creatures to use them to the glory of the Creator, and all creatures was to
serve him, but man transgresses against his Maker, and offended him, and
dishonored him, and became degenerate and grieved his Maker continually, and
was drove out from the presence of the Lord, and he is now a child of
disobedience and of wrath, and an enemy in his mind against the Lord that made
him, and he is doing and fulfilling daily the will of the Devil, and grieveth
the Spirit of God, and vexes his righteous soul, and is subject unto the curse
of woe and destruction, being ignorant of the life and power and wisdom of the
Creator, to lead him, to guide him, and to preserve him, but follows the
counsel of his own heart which is evil altogether, though he was made
upright, yet has he sought out many inventions, which are continually
abominable unto the Lord, the ground in which he stands is corrupted, and all
his fruit is unpleasant, even bitter and evil unto the Lords taste. Man is
fallen into the pit of misery and sorrow, compassed about with desolation, and
is left without a helper from himself, or from any other creature, and this in
short is the state of all mankind upon the face of the earth, who was planted a
noble Vine, wholly a right seed to bring forth good fruit unto his Maker; but
he is turned into a degenerate plant, bringing forth cursed fruits which the
Creator has not pleasure in his best works are not accepted, and his evil
deeds are condemned, because the ground in which he stands is accursed because
of disobedience.

CHAP. V.
Concerning the World in general, and the state of things as they have been,
and as now they are, this testimony I give to the whole World.
DArkness has been over the face of the earth, and thick darkness has covered
the people for many ages, the Beast has reigned upon the face of the whole
earth, and all Nations have been subject to his power and dominion, even the
Kings and Princes of the earth have given their power unto him, all the world
has wondered after him as t is written, and the whole world has worshipped the
beast and his image, he has power to kill all that would not worship him, both
small and great, rich and poor, even all has been subject to his government,
and he has had power to war against the Saints, and to make war with them,
and to overcome them, even all that would not worship him, he has had power to
kill; the Rule and Government of the Son of God has not been witnessed among
men for ages, nor the true God known, nor manifestly worshipped in spirit and
truth, but he has been as a stranger among men, and they have been ignorant of
his ways and judgments, and all people have been doing that which is right in
the sight of their own eyes and God has been forgotten days without number,
the living Fountain has been forsaken, and many broken cisterns have been
hewn out, which has not holden pure water: great evils and continual
abominations have been acted in the sight of God, and the measure of iniquity
has been fulfilling through many generations, and it is grown nigh to the
full, the Law of God has been made void, and his grace has turned into
wantonness, and all things have been out of good order: Kings, Princes,
Rulers, Governments, Laws, and Decrees have been corrupt, and not right in the
sight of the Lord, oppressions, tyranny and vainglory has abounded in the
Nations, and justice and true judgment have been neglected, and mercy and
truth have been strangers, and the world has been filled with violence, and
the whole earth stained and polluted with oppressions, unjustice, and
cruelties, and the cry of poor has not been heard, every one has sought
themselves and not the Lord, not the good one of another, the Kings and Princes
of the earth have not been perfect nor upright before the Lord, but vainglory
has abounded, and superstitions and idolatries have reigned over them, and
unrighteousness has abounded, and self-seeking, and they have risen up one
against another in quarrelling and destroying one another, and to gain one
another dominions by craft and Policy, and strong hand, and the poor has been
oppressed and trodden down, and thousands of thousands destroyed to fulfill
their wills and lusts, and the pride of their hearts, all this has been evil
in the sight of the Lord, and his soul has been weary with it, by the
destruction of his creatures, one by another, even Rulers, Teachers, and people
have all been out of the way, and subverted from that wherein God has
pleasure, and the Prince of darkness has ruled in his dominion, swaying all
under his Government, and even all things both of civil and spiritual
concernment has been ont of the counsel of the Lord. Oh what cruel injustice
and tyranny in civil Government, Oh what abominable superstitions and
idolatries has been in (supposed) Church-Governments, its a vexation to the
Spirit of the Lord to consider it, and the righteous soul has long cried out
and mourned under it, and because of this is the Lord of Heaven and Earth now
arisen to overturn, to overturn Kings and Princes, Governments and Laws, and he
will confound and break down all tyranny and oppression under which the poor
has groaned, and he will change times, and laws, and governments, there shall
be no King ruling but Jesus, nor no government of force but the government of
the Lamb, nor no law of effect but the law of God, all that which is otherwise
shall be ground to powder, the Kingdom of the most high shall rule amongst men,
and the Kingdoms of this world shall be changed, and shall become the Kingdoms
of the Lord and of his Christ, and the Lord shall be known in the earth to be
the God of truth, of righteousness; justice, and mercy, and truth shall be
exalted, and true judgment shall be set up in the Nations, and the worship in
spirit and in truth shall be established, for the Lord is gathering his
numberless number to stand before his throne without guile in their mouth, and
without fault before him.

CHAP. VI.
Concerning man's Restoration, Redemption and Salvation, what they are, and by
whom they are wrought, this testimony I give unto all people.
Man's Restoration is a repairing and giving again that which he has lost by
transgression, and Redemption is a recovering and a winning again, and setting
free from that wherein man has been held (even all the Sons of Adam) because
of disobedience, and Salvation is a saving, keeping, and preserving from sin,
and death, and disobedience, and all the ways thereof, and also a saving from
wrath and misery and condemnation, which are the effects thereof, and by the
Son of God Christ Jesus is all this wrought, manifested and witnessed, and
Restoration, Redemption and Salvation is only in Christ Jesus the second
Adam, and not in any other, and it is wrought by him and by no other, and they
are the free gift of the Father unto the sons of men, no way purchased by the
works of the creature, or desert of him, but are freely given unto the creature
through the power and wisdom of the Creator, and only by Jesus Christ the Son
of the eternal God, and by the eternal Spirit are they witnessed in all that
believe, and through the word of life are they handled, tasted, seen and felt,
near at hand in power and not in words only. Many professes them in words and
what others enjoyed of these things, but has not felt in themselves, the
working of the eternal Spirit, neither has the witness in themselves of
being restored to God again, and of being redeemed by him from under the devils
power, neither are saved by Christ from sin and transgression, and so are not,
nor cannot be saved from condemnation and wrath, for who abide in their sins
and in the state unreconciled to God, has not any part or portion in these
things which belongs to their peace, and without the knowledge of which by the
working of the eternal Spirit, all mankind is everlastingly miserable.

CHAP. VII.
Concerning true Religion, and the true worship of the true God, this testimony
I give unto the whole world.
THis is true Religion to be kept pure and clean from all evil and from all
that which would defile in the sight of the Lord, and to walk in his fear in
all things, this is Religion, to do good and to do no evil, and to speak the
truth, and to do the truth in all things, and to do unto all men as a man would
be done unto, and to love God withal the heart, and the neighbor as self; and
not to love the world, and ways, and pleasures of it, nor to use deceit in
words or actions, this is true Religion, and the true worship of God, to be led
with his Spirit in all things, and to be guided in the truth at all times on
all occasions; this is acceptable and well pleasing unto God above all words,
and outward conformity, and set times, and days, and observances; for the
worship of God is not in these things, but is without respect of days, places
or things; this Religion and worship stands in Christ Jesus the second Adam,
who has lighted every man that comes into the world, that all men through him
might believe, and by him have their consciences purely exercised toward God,
and toward man in all things whatsoever, and this is our Religion and worship
of the true God: he that can receive it, let him.

CHAP. VIII.
Concerning Justification and Sanctification, this testimony I give unto all
people.
JUstification is freely by Jesus Christ in the sight of the Father, and not by
the works of man's own righteousness, and such as are taught by Christ, and
guided by him in all the ways of truth and righteousness, are justified by
him, and none else, not in any word or work whatsoever, but in what they are
led to fulfill by him, and it is the new man that is justified and not the old,
he that is born of God, and none that are born of the flesh, such cannot please
God, neither can such be justified by him, for they are not taught of him, nor
saved, nor restored, nor redeemed, and therefore are not justified nor cleared
from condemnation in the sight of the Lord, but who lives in iniquity, and sin,
and the ways and works of the world, which are evil, by Christ Jesus are
condemned and not justified, though in words they profess him, yet of
justification by him they have no part, and sanctification is by the working of
the eternal Spirit in the heart of the creature, which purges out and takes
away all unrighteousness, and all the works and fruits of darkness: it
witnesses against, and witnesses unto Jesus, who takes away all sin, and
destroies the works of the devil, that man may be holy and pure in the sight
of his Maker; and every one that has the witness of his justification has the
operation by the eternal spirit of sanctification, and all that receives
Christ Jesus, who has lighted every man that comes into the world, receives
sanctification and justification by him, and he unto us is made so of the
Father, he that can receive it let him,

CHAP. IX.
Concerning the Kingdom of Christ, and how it is to be set up, this testimony I
give unto all the World.
THE Kingdom of God and of his Son, is not of this world, but is from above and
stands in righteousness and in truth, in mercy and in peace, in true judgment
and justice, and this dominion is from everlasting to everlasting, and it
reaches beyond all the world, and its Government is love and unity, and
everlasting peace, and is perfect liberty to the just and binds and chaineth
the unjust; in it there is no oppression but perfect freedom from all
unrighteousness, and it consists not in word, but in power, to the bringing
down of the Kingdom of the devil, and to the breaking off the bonds of all
injustice, and all ungodliness which is the Kingdom of satan, which has long
ruled in the world, that Kingdom whereof Christ is King, which stands in
righteousness, no unclean thing can have any part therein, and this we believe
it shall be set up and advanced in the earth, but not by might of man or arm of
flesh, not the multitude of an host, neither by policy, nor craft, nor by
revenge, but by the arm of the Lord alone, through the suffering and patience
of his people, and by faithful witness bearing unto Jesus Christ by doing and
by suffering, by doing his will in all things in a pure life and conversation,
and upright walking in the sight of the Lord, and by patient suffering under
the injustice and oppression of men, and of their unjust Government and Laws,
till they be overturned and confounded; and further we give testimony, that
suffering in patience under the cruelty and oppression of the devils government
and Kingdom; more reaches to overthrow them than the rising to rebel in any way
of outward offense toward them, or defense from them, and the Kingdom of Christ
is near to come, and the Kingdoms of this world shall be changed, and none
shall have any part therein but they that are redeemed out of kindreds,
tongues, and people: this we believe, he that can receive it let him.

CHAP. X.
Concerning Governors, and Governments, and Subjection to this testimony I
give to the world.
Governors, Rulers, and Magistrates we own, and do respect in the Lord; (and
yet cannot respect any man's person whatsoever) such as be a terror to all
evil in their government, and that fears God and hates covetousness, and
delights in equity, in justice, and true judgment, and gives diligent heed to
try the cause of the poor, and will judge justly without respect of men, who
justifies the good and gives praise to the well-doer, such Government and
Governors we reverence, where sin and iniquity is kept under, drunkenness,
swearing, Murder, quarrelling, and all the ways and works of the flesh are
terrified, and a welldoer praised and justified, this Government of men,
reaches to the witness of God in every man, and that answers to the justice
and righteousness of all such Governors and Government, and these witness
that they are of God, but the witness of God in every man, bears witness
against all unjust men, and Laws, and Rulers, and Governments, which
strengthens the hands of the wicked, and oppresses the just, where the
making and execution of Laws are in the power of proud men, and covetous men,
who fears not God, neither hates covetousness, neither does respect the cause
of the poor* but rules by their wills and tyranny, and not by just Laws in
righteousness; but makes unrighteous decrees to oppress the poor and
innocent, letting the wicked go free, such who upholds unrighteous worships,
and teachers by oppression, and cause the innocent to suffer, and makes them
offenders, because the exercise of a pure conscience toward God and men; such
Rulers and Government we cannot be subject to for conscience sake, but does
rather fulfill the law and will of God, though we transgress their wills and
unrighteous Laws, and yet does not rebel against them, nor seek defense from
them, but patiently suffers under them, and bears their injustice and cruelty
without seeking any revenge, but leaves vengeance to the Lord to whom it
belongs, and this is our judgment in full, the Government and Laws which we
cannot obey nor fulfill for conscience sake, we choose rather to suffer under
them for disobedience to them, than to transgress the righteous Law of God,
written in our hearts by obeying them; so that what we cannot obey for
conscience sake, for conscience sake we resist not, but suffers under that (the
punishment of it) patiently, and herein are we subject to every ordinance of
man, for conscience sake: in fulfilling of the good, the just, and righteous,
and in patience suffering under the cruelty and oppression of the unjust and
unrighteous, and this we do and teach every where, subjection to every
ordinance of man, and are not destroyers of true Government, not rebellious
against just Governors, but are exalters of true justice and judgment in the
earth.

CHAP. XI.
Concerning the true Ministry of Christ and the false Ministry, and the
difference betwixt them, this testimony I give unto all the world.
THe true Ministry is sent of God, and is the gift of the Holy Ghost, and it
stands in the power of the Spirit of God, and not in the words of man's wisdom,
of that wisdom which is from below, and it brings people to the knowledge of
God, which is life eternal, and it turns people from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan to the power of God, it is freely received of God, and
freely given forth of us, it proclaims peace on earth, unto such as are of a
broken and upright heart, and it proclaims war against all the wicked upon
earth, it is a good savor unto God in setting the way of life, and the way of
death, before all people, the Ministry of Christ is free, and cannot be bought
nor sold for money, it is without hire and gifts, and rewards from any man,
which is given freely into the world, and it ever was and is persecuted by the
generation of the unjust, and by the powers of the earth, he that comes in the
Fathers name cannot be received of the world, but the world is at enmity
against it, in this generation as ever was, it converts people unto the
knowledge of God, and many did and many does receive the knowledge of God
thereby though some thereby be hardened against God unto destruction, and the
word of the Lord, and the Ministry returns not in vain unto God, but all by it
are left without excuse, the witness of Christ in every creature being reached
to, which gives testimony to the power and to the truth of the Ministry of
Christ, but the false Ministers and Ministry are not such; for their Ministry
is received by natural learning and arts* and is not the gift of the Holy
Ghost, but stands in the wisdom of man's words, and not in the power and life of
God, it profits not the people at all, neither does any come to the knowledge
of God thereby, neither is turned from darkness to light; but Teachers and
people continues in the power of Satan, and in the unconverted estate, the
witness of God not reached to, to bring to the understanding of things which
are eternal, but people are ever learning by it, and never coming to the
knowledge of the truth; but the blind leads the blind, and like Teachers like
People, all out of the way, given to iniquity and unrighteousness, and such are
they who preaches for hire, and divines for money, and seeks for their gain
from their quarter, and through covetousness by feigned words, makes
merchandise of souls, going for gifts and rewards, and reaching for filthy
lucre, having settled places and so much a year, these are not the true
Ministers of Christ, but false Ministers of Antichrist and deceivers, and was
never sent of God, and do never bring any to the knowledge of God, and such we
bear witness against to be of the Devil, and that for many generations the
world has been deceived by them who has had the form of godliness, but not
the power, and Christ's words and the Apostles words without the life, and they
have served themselves and not the Lord Jesus, but now they are made manifest
with the true Light which approves the Ministry of God, and disapprove such
who are Ministers of Antichrist, and all that are in the light, and walks in
the light can receive this testimony which is given by the Spirit of God, to
that Ministry which is sent of him, which does fulfill his will, and against
the false Ministry which is not of God, which runs and was never sent of him.

CHAP. XII.
Concerning the Gospel of Christ, this is my testimony unto all the world.
THe Gospel is the power of God, and it is sent of him into the world to
reconcile people unto him, that have been in the enmity against him, it is
peace to the poor in spirit, and judgment to the fat, and to the high minded,
and it is to be preached to every creature (male and female) under Heaven
without respect of Peoples, Nations, or generations, it is the manifestation of
the love of God to the whole world, togather people out of all unrighteousness
into the living way of life, peace and truth, to walk with God in purity and
holiness, and to deny the world and all its ways, and works, and worships
which are evil, and by it some are brought to God, and to salvation, and life
eternal, and some through it are hardened against God, that they may be
destroyed and condemned, who are reprobates and believes not in him from whom
the Gospel comes, and it cannot be received by any other way or means, than by
the revelation of Jesus Christ in the hearts of his people, and many have the
letter which knows not the Gospel, nor has received it, and this Gospel
which is everlasting, have we received from God, and this is the sound of it
which we give in the world unto the world: fear God and give glory to him for
the hour of his judgments is come, and this is the everlasting Gospel of
salvation, he that can receive it let him,

CHAP. XIII.
Concerning the word of God, and concerning the Scriptures, this testimony I
give unto all the World.
THe word of God was in the beginning before any creatures were made, and by it
all things stand and remain unto this day, and the world endures for ever, and
by it all things in Heaven and in Earth are brought to pass which God does, and
it is from everlasting to everlasting, without beginning and without end, and
the word is powerful dividing and discerning all things, even the secret
thoughts of every man's heart, it is a two-edged sword, and as a fire, and like
a hammer to cut up, to burn, and to beat down, the word of the Lord reconciles
man again to him, and this word is in the mouth, in the heart, and the servants
of the Lord handled, tasted, saw and felt the word of life, and from it spoke
sorth the Scriptures, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost through the eternal
Spirit, and it is a declaration of the word of life, which was in the
beginning, and endures for ever, and it declares what the Saints received,
believed, and enjoyed, and none can understand it without the same Spirit that
gave it forth, and to such who have the same Spirit the Scripture is
profitable, the Word of God which was in the beginning, and which endures for
ever, is not the Scripture which was not in the beginning, neither can it
endure for ever, but the Scripture testifies of that word, and that word
witnesses to the Scripture, and they are not contrary one to the other, but
gives witness each of other, but many has the Scripture that has not the
Word, neither knows it, but they that have the Word cannot but own the
Scriptures, and this the truth as it is in Jesus testified to all the world by
us, who does deny them that hereof gives any other testimony.

CHAP. XIV.
Concerning the Devil and Damnation, this testimony I give to all people.
THere is a Devil which is out of the truth, who abode not in the truth but is
a liar from the beginning, and the Father of all evil and evil doing, and the
author of all unrighteousness, and whatsoever is contrary to God in thought
word, and action, he is the enmity against God and against all good, and by his
power subverts creatures and things to another end than wherefore they were
created, even to the dishonor of the Creator, he is the god of this world, the
Prince of darkness, and he rules King in all the children of the first Adam,
who are in evil: he was the cause of the first transgression, and is the cause
of disobedience to God to this day in all people, who are led by him, moving
all them to envy, wrath, pride, whoredom, drunkenness, theft, and murder, and
all the works of darkness, sin, and death, he is the fountain and root of all
these, and the leader and ruler in the exercise of them, and of every evil
word and work whatsoever which are contrary to God, he abode not in the truth,
and he has led all mankind out of truth into all deceit and unrighteousness,
and into every evil way, and he dwells in darkness, and inhabits in thick
darkness, and is out of the light, and is separate from the presence of God for
ever bound in chains of darkness and ignorance, and unbelief and he has power
in the earthly part of man, and a law in the members, and he possesses him that
is born of the flesh, and his covenant is with him who is not born of the seed
of God, who cannot sin, such are in covenant with God, and renewed into his
image, but such as are not, has the Devil power in to captivate and lead
their minds into vanity, and their affections and desires into all that which
is evil, by which the Spirit of God the Creator of all things is grieved and
his soul vexed, and all murder and deceitful works of the world; and all
whatsoever is contrary to God in words, thoughts, or actions, is of the Devil
that wicked one, and from him and all that follow his movings, and works
evil thereby, they serve him and obey him, he is their God and their King, and
they are his people, and his subjects, he is their Father, and they are his
children, he is their root, and they are his off-sprign, and brings forth fruit
unto him, and serves and worships him, and not the true God that made all
things, and all such must be cast into utter darkness with him, and shall have
their portion with him in the bottemlesse pit of darkness for ever and ever,
where there is no end of woe, and sorrow, and misery, for in the anger of God
there the worm dies nor, nor the fire is not quenched, and out of that there is
no redemption for the unclean; and all such who are led of him, who is out of
the truth and in evil, are judged, and condemned, and damned by him, who is
the truth, who judges righteously; and as he has not ceased to work evil,
and to draw the children of men into evil, for he continually tempts to lead
from God into rebellion against him. And they that are led by him are
destroyed, and he shall not cease to sorrow, woe, and misery for ever, as he
has not ceased to work evil, he lives and moves in the anger of God his
beginning was in it, and all his works are in it, and it shall be the reward of
him, and all that obey him in the separation from Gods everlasting presence,
for ever and ever.

CHAP. XV.
Concerning all creatures that God made, this testimony I give unto all the
World.
ALL creatures that God made in their creation and beginning was very good in
his sight that made them, and unto man that was to use them, and no creature
was evil or defiled in its creation, but mankind transgressing against his
Maker, he became evil, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, and he being
possessed with evil and corrupted, he makes all creatures evil in his
exercise of them, and he corrupts them and perverts them to another end than
wherefore they were created, and by the creatures, dishonours the Creator, who
should have honored him by them, and they are become a curse unto man and not
a blessing, though in themselves are neither cursed, nor evil, nor defiled,
but is become so unto man, because of his transgression and disobedience; for
he being in the curse and defiled, all things are so unto him, and in his
exercise of them he is wicked, abusing them upon the lust to satisfy his
devilish mind, and ruling over them in oppression and cruelty, and hard
heartedness, and not in the wisdom of God as he ought, and he subverts them out
from their pure virtue, feeding his lust in pride and voluptuousness, with that
which should keep him from hunger and nakedness, and so pleasing the lust in
all things more than satisfying pure nature, and this ought not to be, for it
is out of the covenant of God, in which all creatures was made, and in which
they stand, except the creature man, who is degenerated out of Gods covenant,
and subverts all things to his own end, and not unto the glory of God, while he
continues in that state unreconciled to God, but man being restored, and
redeemed, and renewed again into covenant with God, through the condemning of
the evil, then all creatures to him are restored, and made blessed, the curse
being removed out of his own heart, the creatures are no longer cursed to him,
but good and decent, and enjoyed, and received in the covenant of God in the
life and virtue by which they were created, and by the wisdom which they were
made, man comes to order them, and exercise himself in them, and no more are
they spent upon the lust, nor on the vain mind, nor ruled over in oppression,
but all that is condemned, and all creatures are seen to be the Lords, and the
whole earth is his and the fullness thereof, and the abuse of all creatures is
ceased, and they are enjoyed in their pure virtue to feed and to cloth the
creature, and not to be destroyed upon the lust, but for the healths-sake are
they used to the glory of the Creator, and unto the end wherefore he created
them, and are pure as they were in the beginning; and the blessing is felt
which is more than all creatures.

CHAP. XVI.
Concerning the new Covenant, and how man comes to the knowledge of God, this
testimony I give.
THe Covenant of God is unity betwixt God and man, and a binding each to other
to serve each other, the one is bound to obey, and submit, and worship; and the
other to bless, and keep, and lead, and preserve; this Covenant is established
with his own seed for ever, and there is no teacher but God, all is taught of
him, from the least to the greatest, who are in this Covenant, his just Law is
written in their heart to condemn all transgression, and his pure Spirit is put
into the inward parts, to be the rule and guide of life in all things, and none
need to say know the Lord, but all knows him in the Spirit, and worships him,
and obeys him, and follows him in spirit, and in truth, and such are come into
peace and reconciliation and God* and the Covenant with Hell and death is
broken: and in this Covenant, there is no Priest nor offering but Christ Jesus
the high Priest of God, the one offering for sin, he takes away sin and makes
intercession, and in it is no temple, but our bodies are the temple of God, and
he dwells in us, and walks in us, and there is no circumcision but the
circumcision of the heart, which is the putting away of all the uncleanness of
the flesh, nor in it there is no means of salvation* but Christ the only way
the truth and the life, and none comes to the Father but by him, he declares of
the Father and there is no light but the light of the Lamb, all that are saved
shall walk in the light of the Lamb, and there shall be no need of any other
light, no need of the light of the Sun, nor of the Moon, nor of a candle, but
the Lord is unto them an everlasting light, and God alone is their glory, and
this Covenant is for ever, and cannot alter nor change, but is sure unto the
seed of his own inheritance, but he that is born of the flesh has no part in
it, who is shut out from the knowledge of God, who is not known to the wisdom
of this World, which is foolishness with God; and the knowledge of God is
received no other way but only by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and by the
working of the Spirit of the Father in the heart, he opens the blind eye, and
unstops the deaf ear, and changes the heart, and causes it to understand, and
he removes that which has stood in the way betwixt God and the creature, which
has caused ignorance in the creature, that the Lord could not be seen nor
perceived. Christ Jesus the second Adam lights every man and all mankind that
comes into the world with the true light, but some hates the light, and they
will not come to the light, least their deeds should be reproved, and their
deeds are evil, and they are in a condemned estate, and such cannot receive
Christ nor the knowledge of God, but such who love the light with which Christ
has enlightened them, they bring all their deeds to the light, and walks in
the light, and their deeds are wrought in God never to be condemned, and such
as loves the light receives Christ and the knowledge of God, which is eternal
life, and none comes to the knowledge of God, and of Christ any other way but
through the light of Christ, and by the operation of the Spirit of God, and
evil is condemned out of the heart, and the heart is made clean by the word of
God, and the knowledge of God is received into the clean heart, and nor into
the impure, for without holiness none shall see God; nor ever come to the
knowledge of him, neither can the knowledge of God be received by the
traditions of men or any outward observance in the will of man, but only by the
teachings of the eternal Spirit, is the living God known in the creature.

CHAP. XVII.
Concerning Faith, this testimony I give unto the World.
FAith is the gift of God, and by it Christ is received and enjoyed; it is the
substance of things hoped for, and the very evidence of things not seen, gives
the creature to believe God in all what he has promised, all that which is
acted and spoken in it, is well pleasing unto God, and that which is done
without sin; it is the strength of the creature to act for God, in all things
it is that whereby the world is overcome, and all the powers of hell and death,
it is the armor against the Devil, and the defense of all the children of
God, by it they overcome all their enemies, and through it they reign over all
the world, it carries through all sufferings and tribulations with joy and
patience: Faith is an act of God in the creature, through it peace and
righteousness and the crown of life is received from God, by Faith all things
are received that are received of God by any of his children: He that has
Faith sees and feels the Lords presence at all times, and through Faith we do
and suffer gladly for the name of Christ in all things, and this is thus far
our testimony given by the Spirit of the Father, of these things of which we
have received the knowledge from God, who has given us his treasure, and we
have this treasure in earthen vessels, even the knowledge of these things
which are eternal, which is not our own, but the Lords to give forth according
to his movings, and of those rhings have we handled, tasted and felt.

CHAP. XVIII.
Concerning what works are accepted of God, and what works are not accepted
brought forth by the Creature.
WHatsoever work man is moved and led unto by the Spirit of God, and guided and
ruled in the practice of, to speak or act whatsoever by the same Spirit (which
moves and leads into all the works of righteousness, and not into any
evil) this is acceptable in the sight of the Lord, and these works are well
pleasing to him: where the Lord goes before, and is the leader in all things,
and this man and his works who is led with the Spirit of the Father is
justified and accepted of God, and not for the creatures sake, who respects not
the person of any but for his own Name sake, because they are wrought in him
through faith, and is moved unto, and guided in by his own Spirit, and they
arise from Gods righteousness revealed in the creature, and not from the
righteousness of the creature, for man being changed and replanted into the
living Vine, and the root being good, every work which springs forth from it
is good also, and accepted of God, because the root is so: But whatsoever works
are brought forth by any creature, though the same in appearance which are
accepted of God from another, yet not being moved unto, nor guided in by the
Spirit of the Father, but brought forth in the will and wisdom of the creature,
which is from below, and acted in imitation from the Saints words; these works
are not accepted and well pleasing unto God, but is offense unto him, and sin
against him, even the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto him, and
if a man come before the Lord with thousands of Rams, and ten thousand of
Rivers of Oil, and if he give the fruit of his body for the sin of the soul,
and cover the Altar with tears, and is not led with a measure of Gods Spirit,
none of all these works are accepted; nor his preaching, praying baptism, nor
breaking of bread, nor any other observances toward God whatsoever, are not
good in his sight but evil, and to be contemnted, and the root from whence
they spring; because man is in the enmity against him, and not changed out of
the old root, nor in that state is not led with the holy Spirit of the Father;
and the root being bad, the branches are evil, and none are accepted of God in
any thing which they perform toward him, but such as are in Christ Jesus, the
second Adam, and such are new creatures, so that it is not for the creatures
sake that any work is accepted of, or offense against God, but only for his
Name sake, and because of being guided, or not of being guided with the measure
of Gods pure Spirit: Therefore is man and his works good and accepted; or evil
and not regarded, but condemned of God.

CHAP. XIX.
Concerning man's state in the first Adam before conversion, and his state after
conversion, and what conversion is.
Man's state in the first Adam in transgression, is a state of perfect enmity
against God, and death reigns in every man, and he is possessed with blindness
and ignorance, and unbelief, and is wholly imperfect to receive the things of
Gods Kingdom, or to act any thing for God acceptable to him; man in that state
is wholly dead to God, and insensible of the presence, and power, and life of
his Creator, for he is drove from God, and is not led by him, he has no power
to perform any good in the sight of God, but is possessed with evil, and led
into all evil continually; he is free from righteousness, and free to all
evil, being the servant of the Devil, and subject to him, and overcome of him
every moment, and is led by him to transgress against the Lord; his heart is
unclean, and out of it proceeds continually uncleanness in all manner of
words, thoughts, and actions, which flows out of the corrupt fountain, which
grieveth and vexes the Lord and his Spirit, who is dishonored daily by man
through his abuse of Gods creatures, who is a devourer and destroyer of them,
and not a preserver as he ought to be, who abuses them upon his lust, and not
to the glory of the Lord; he loves the creature and worships the creature, and
is gone a whoring after the creatures, and has forgotten God that made him and
all things, and has lost his own dominion wherein he was set in his Creation,
and his state in his transgression is cursed of God, and without the peace of
God, it being in the enmity against him; and in all things he is wholly
unprofitable to his Maker, and only profitable to himself and to the Devil,
and this in short is the state of every man in transgression before conversion;
but his state after conversion is a state more blessed, for man is changed, and
renewed, and translated by the power of the Lord, through the working of the
eternal Spirit through conversion, his mind is changed, and his heart is
renewed, the old is done away, and a new heart is given, and all things are
become new, even every word and work, and every intent and purpose of his mind,
is converted into another end, and guided by another spirit than before his
conversion; and man is again returned to God, into the sense and feeling of his
Maker, and into covenant with him where he is blessed, and all things to him;
for the reconciliation is made with God, and the evil is judged and condemned,
and sin is taken away and blotted out, and not remembered: for man is become
servant unto God, and only serves him in all things, and not himself or any
other creature in any thing, for he has received power to become Son to God,
and has received power over the Devil and his temptations, and death is
destroyed, and the effects of it are ceased, and the sting of it is taken away,
and life and immortality is brought to light, and man is made capable to act in
all things for the glory of his Maker, and God has made Christ wisdom to him,
to rule him and guide him in all things, and righteousness to cover him, and
justification to him to clear him in his sight, and the new man is brought
forth, and the creating in Christ Jesus unto good works is known, and the
birth, which is heir of Gods Kingdom is witnessed, and unto this man is the
Lord become an everlasting light and a sure hiding place, for he is not the
servant of sin but of righteousness, nor an offense to God in any of his
works, but for his names sake is well pleased with him; he is his teacher in
all the ways of peace, he is his helmet, and his shield, and his hope of
salvation, and his shepherd to feed him and preserve him at all times; though
he may be tempted, yet he is not overcome, for God is his strength, though he
may be tried, ye the is not forsaken of the Lord; though he may be cast into
the fire it is not to consume him, for the Lord is with him; all things he
receives as from the hand of God, and all creatures he enjoyes in the Covenant
with God, and peace is in all his ways, for it is the Lord that works in him
both to will and to do of his own good pleasure; and this is the state of the
new man brought forth in conversion, which is a turning of the creature from
the power of Satan (which rules in every man before conversion, to the power of
God which is the ruler of every man that is truly converted; and this is the
truth as it is in Jesus, which I have received from God, he that can receive it
let him, and if any have an ear let him hear what the Spirit says; this
conversion of the creature is wrought by the Spirit of God through the Ministry
sent of him, and even for this cause have we received the Ministry of God,
through the holy Ghost, that we might publish these things abroad, that all
people may come to the knowledge of them, and may taste, and handle, and feel of
the same word of life in themselves, which will reveal the knowledge of these
things to them that they may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship
is with the Father and with the Son.

And now be it known to all the world, and to all people in it, that the Lord
has raised up a people and brought forth a seed, to bear witness of his Name,
and of his dominion, and power in all the earth, and of these truths with many
more, which are but one in Christ Jesus, has God given us the perfect
knowledge of, even wrought them in us, and revealed them to us by the eternal
Spirit, and as that same Spirit does, and shall move us, do we and shall we
bear witness of these truths unto all people upon earth whatsoever, both by
doctrine and conversation, holding forth the testimony unto others which we
have received of God, that Christ may be exalted, and his Kingdom set up in
the world, and in comparison of this, that we may serve God in our generation,
by bearing witness of these things, which we have heard and seen; nothing of
this world, our liberty, our life, nor any other thing whatsoever, is not dear
unto us; yea, even for this cause, that the Name of the Lord may be testified
of, do we give up our selves continually to suffer all manner of evil in words
or works; and we love not our lives unto death, that truth and righteousness
may be exalted, and this is the cause wherefore we pass through many dangers
on every hand, and are in perils often, and we are not, nor cannot be afraid
of the face of any man, even that the Lord alone may be exalted, whose Name,
and Honor, and Truth is more dear unto us than any other thing; and for it
have we forsaken all, and counted it as nothing in comparison of the knowledge
of Christ, and his truth herein declared and witnessed to the whole world to
whom it shall come, and the light of Christ in every one shall give testimony
to it unto which I do only commend my self and these truths to be witnessed.

And know ye assuredly that God, who is just and righteous in all his ways, it
is he that sets the way of life and the way of death before every man, and
he has appeared in this generation, and he has caused his voice to be heard
in the earth, and he has set the way of death and the way of life before you,
and all that perish it is through unbelief; and because they do despise the
way which God has prepared, who has prepared a way for life and salvation
unto all people, that all may come to life and salvation, and may not perish,
and he has not shut out any creature before he was brought forth into the
world, but gives to every one that comes into the world a day of visitation
and a time of repentance and returning, that healing may be received from the
Lord, who is the restorer of lost man, and there is not another; so that if man
perish, it is of himself, and not of God, who has so loved mankind, that he
has given his Son, his own wisdom and his power into the world, that all that
does receive him (Christ Jesus) may have everlasting life, and they that
receive him not, they perish because of unbelief, whereby they are hardened for
destruction, and unto such our Gospel, the Gospel of God is hid, whose eye is
blinded by the God of this world, that they cannot see the things which be
eternal, nor believe in him from whence life comes, and such are stumbling at
Christ the foundation, and therefore shall be broken, and must not inherit the
kingdom of God, and unto such, though they be wise in the kingdom of this
world, are we become fools for Christ sake, and our testimony cannot be
received by them, nor approved of them, even them that seek after a sign, and
them that seek after wisdom, to such we are not known, nor can our testimony
be acceptable to them which is not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in
the demonstration of God Spirit, and in simplicity of truth, which is of great
price with the Lord, even above knowledge and all wisdom, which is of this
world which comes to nothing, but the Lord will confound that and bring it to
nothing, for the world by its wisdom does not know God, neither can it receive
the things of God, but is foolishness in the sight of God, and the wisdom of
the world must be offended in him, and in the testimony which is given of him,
and the Princes of this world, and the wise men must stumble and fall, the
powers of the earth must be offended at him, that they may be confounded and
brought to naught, all the heathen shall rage, and the people shall imagine a
vain thing: but what of all this, the testimony of the Lord is true which he
has given us to bear of his Name, and of it we are not ashamed before the face
of the whole world, and we are armed to suffer for it, and not only to
subscribe to the truth of it with our hand, or to declare of it with our tongue
and pen, but also if we be called to it, may seal it with our blood: Wherefore
this is sent among you all, Rulers, Teachers and people in all the world; this
is sent among: you as to give you the certain knowledge of what we hold and
bear witness to, which is received of us from God, and born witness of to you
by his Spirit, even those things with many others which we have not received
from man but from God, are we purposed in the Lord to declare abroad, and he
has put it into our hearts to fulfill his will herein; for he has spoken, who
can but prophecy, and he has given the word, and many are they that publish
it in faithfulness against the kingdom of the man of sin, which has long
been exalted in the earth over the seed of God, which the Lord is now a
gathering and establishing his Covenant with, an Jerusalem that has long lain
wast, shall be made the praise of the whole earth, and the Gentiles which has
polluted her shall be cast out, and the Saints shall rejoice over all their
enemies.

And know you assuredly from us, who know the Lord, that God is doing great
things in the earth, he is begun to work and his arm shall bring it to pass,
he will overturn and overturn, till he come to reign whose right it is, who
will change times and things, even that which cannot be believed, though a man
declare it unto you, is the Lord bringing to pass; the eye shall bless that
sees it, and the heart shall praise that can understand, and behold the Lord
comes quickly, and they are blessed that waits for him, whose reward is with
him, and his glorious work is before him to be wrought by his own hand without
the help of any other; who needs not the help of man, and yet that man that
does oppose him, shall be overthrown, confounded and destroyed, And again: all
the Kings, Princes, Rulers, and People whatsoever, know ye assuredly that we
are not enemies against, but friends unto all Civil Government, and to all
just and righteous orders and decrees, and wholesome Law and Customs of any
Commonwealth, and no way are we destructive to, or destroyers of the Peace,
and welfare, and wholesome Laws (which is according to God) of any Nation
whatsoever. But are preservers of the peace of all people, and waits in
patience for the establishment of justice and true judgment, and that
righteousness may spring forth, and the Government of all Nations may be
according to the Law of God. Neither are we such who makes void the just
Government of any Nation or City; neither are we such who through evil
purposes, plotteth, or conspireth, or contriveth evil in our hearts against
any Governors or Government whatsoever; but wishes peace and truth, and the
fear of the Lord unto all men and Nations, and desires not the overthrow or
evil to any people, or their Government: but is subject to just Government
every where by obedience to it, and subject to evil Government by suffering in
patience under it; so that righteousness alone we wait to see set up through
the world, and for that cause suffers patiently under our enemies, not
seeking revenge against them, nor envying the persons of any; but pitties our
enemies, and desires their repentance rather than their destruction: Yet this
we give all to know, that the Lord will be avenged on all them who hates the
way of righteousness, and all that opposes the Lord and his way, and
despises his truth which he has revealed, they shall be confounded and broken
to pieces, and shall confess to the Lord, and his way, and his truth in the
day of their destruction.

Again, let all the earth know, that against all unrighteousness, injustice,
oppression, whoredom, murder and drunkenness, and all sin whatsoever, we do
declare and acknowledge our selves to be enemies against all sin, and they that
commit it, and we cannot hide sin and iniquity in any, but gives our testimony
against it, and against all that live in it whatsoever, without respect to men
or places, and cannot flatter any man in his transgressions, but says, that
lying, swearing, drunkenness, covetousness, injustice, dissimulation,
hypocrisy, murder, and envy, lust of the flesh, pride and wantonness, and all
the works of the flesh whatsoever, are contrary to God, and of the devil, and
they that lives in them, and brings them forth, are the servants of the devil,
and must not inherit that kingdom of God, who brings forth those works which
grieves the Spirit of God, and vexes his righteous soul, and this is that
Government only which is the Government of sin and death, which we declare our
selves enemies to, which is of the devil and not of God; and this is that
Government which we testify against, and wars against by the sword of the
Spirit of God, and by his power, and not by the carnal weapons or subtle
conspiracies, or violent insurrections; for this way, and by this means shall
not the Government of Satan be overthrown, or the kingdom of Christ ever
exalted.

Again, let all the world know, that we are not such as disanuls or makes void
the Covenant and bond of Relations, or teach any so to do, or give any example
by our practice to any subjects to be rebellious to their Governors, or
children to be disobedient to their Parents, or that servants be undutifull to
their Masters. But on the contrary, does say and affirm it, that it is the duty
of Subjects to be obedient and subject in the Lord to their Rulers and
Governors, whether Kings, Dukes or others, who have rule over them; and also
that Children should be obedient to their Parents; and Servants to be dutiful
and subject to their Masters in the Lord in all things, and that Husbands and
Wives live in all unity and peace in the Lord: Provided only, where Rulers,
Parents, or Masters, or Husbands requires of their Subjects, Children or
Servants or any other whatsoever, requiring of their relations that which is
unjust and contrary to God and his righteous law; in such a case we say, that
Subjects, Children, Servants, and all other whatsoever are free, and we say,
where man requires any thing contrary to God, and God requires another thing
contrary to man, the obedience to God is rather to be chosen, and the obedience
to all men is to be denied; and this is our judgment which is according to
truth, and is the mind of God concerning subjection and obedience, and the duty
of Relations one to another.

And lastly, know ye assuredly that we do not hold and maintain any thing by
conversation or doctrine, but the very same truth in word and practice, as all
our Forefathers did, but bears witness of the same salvation by the same
Christ as they did, and are not setters forth of strange gods, for no other God
is worshipped by us than he, which Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and all the rest
of the servants of the Lord in every generation worshipped, served and obeyed,
neither are we such as does maintain Heresy, Error, or Idolatry, or the
worship of any strange god, though hereof we are accused falsely, yet against
us cannot it be proved truly, and this we give the whole world to know, that no
other end, or purpose, or design is in our hearts, but only to fulfill the will
of God in all things as it is to us made manifest. Even this is the resolution
of our hearts, and the full purpose of our minds. to give testimony through the
world as we are moved, both by writing and declaring of these Truths which to
us is known from the Lord, that truth and righteousness may come to reign, and
this may we do as the Lord provideth way for us, nor fearing the face of any
man, nor being afraid of the threatening of high looks, and that we may finish
the testimony given us of God, our life nor any other thing is dear unto us,
and all ye people every where, for your sake is this written to come abroad
amongst you, to give you warning and true information of the work of the Lord,
and what he is about to do, that you may hear and understand, and may receive
the knowledge of those things which belong to your peace, and may be saved with
an eternal salvation, or otherwise through this are you wholly left without
excuse if you perish: And unto this was I pressed in spirit for many days,
that all the world may be satisfied, what we are, and what we hold, and what
the purpose of the Lord is; and I whom God has warned, do warn all people upon
the face of the earth, that you prepare, prepare to meet the Lord, for his
coming and his day is nigh at hand, and his judgments shall be revealed in the
Earth, and all flesh shall tremble before him, and all the inhabitants of the
world shall be confounded at his presence; The proud shall be abased, and the
poor shall be exalted; the high and lofty shall be brought down, and the meek
and upright shall be set up; Truth shall reign as King, and deceit shall
utterly be confounded; they that now suffer all manner of evil for the Name of
Jesus, shall possess everlasting freedom, and the dominion shall be in their
hands, and they that now cause the just to suffer, shall go into endless
captivity, the seed of God shall spring forth and flourish, but the seed of
evill-doers shall never be renowned: And betwixt these two seeds is an enmity
put, and they can never be reconciled, each seed has his fruit, the one is
cursed and the other is blessed, and each seed is known by its fruit, and must
receive from the Lord accordingly.

And this is the testimony of the servants of the Lord, and the witness which
they give unto all the world of those things which we have handled, tasted,
heard, seen and felt; blessed are all they thar can receive it.

We are known to God in the Spirit, and one to another in his life, and are
known in the world by the name of Quakers, cast upon us through the derision of
the heathen.

But Quaking and trembling at the World of the Lord; by the servants of the
Lord, we do own, when the power of God reaches to the witness of God in the
creature, which brings condemnation upon all high looks, and upon the lofty
nature, which causes the earthly part to tremble, we do own and many of us do
witness, the Quaking and Trembling which is by the operation of the Spirit of
God, and the several operations by the one Spirit we own: which brings down
proud flesh, whose honor God will lay in the dust, and bring it to everlasting
contempt, and when this comes to pass, quaking shall not be a strange thing,
nor the Name reproached as it is at this day by the proud spirits of men, who
knows not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his Spirit.

Moreover and besides all this, let all the world know, that our conversation,
life and practice is one and the same with what we hold forth in words, and
that we give as large a testimony of God amongst us by pure conversation as
doctrine, and does deny them who gives testimony in words only, and answers
not in their conversation, for that is hypocrisy, and our souls loath it, and
it is abomination in the fight of the Lord, where he is professed in words, and
not walked to in purity and righteousness of life, for righteousness being
brought forth in the heart, works of righteousness will spring forth in the
world, and where righteousness springs not forth in the world, and the fruits
of the knowledge of God, it shows that righteousness is not in the heart, and
that God is not known.

Also concerning our Government, it is according to Christ, whom we own to be
head amongst us, and no other head we have or do bow unto, and we are but
members of his body, joined to him through the Spirit as head over us all, and
the greatest of us is but a member of Christ, who is the head alone, and we
have not another, neither can we be subject to any other Government but his, or
to obey any Government but what is justly according to his, whose Government
must be set up in the earth, and for it we wait, and labors, and travels, and
counts nothing hard, but all things are easy to us for this prise which is
before us, even the Government of Christ to be set up, and all Governments of
men established according to it, and this is our testimony which we give forth
in words and practice, and if it be required can seal it with our blood.

And this is written for no other end, but that you may be certainly informed
what we are, and what we hold, and what the Lord has done, and what he is
about to do in all the earth, who is arisen, and has said, Ah! I will ease me
of my Adversaries.
