2 CHRONICLES. 19.6, 7. Jehosophat said to the Judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye

Printed for I. H. 1641.

The Articles of impeachment of Sir Robert Berkley Knight, one of the Justices
of the Court of the Kings Bench; by the Commons in this present Parliament
assembled, in their own name, and in the name of all the Commons of England,
in maintenance of their accusation, whereby he stands charged with high
treason, and other great misdemeanors.
INprimis, that the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices of
the said Court of Kings Bench, has traitorously, and wickedly, endeavored to
subvert the fundamental Laws, and established government of the Realm of
England; and, instead thereof, to introduce an Arbitrarie, and Tyrannical
government against Law, which he has declared by traitorous and wicked words,
opinions, judgments, practices, and actions appearing in the several Articles
ensuing.

2 Whereas by the Statute made in the five and twentieth year of the reign of
the late King Henry the eighth, prices of Victuals are appointed to be rated
in such manner, as in the said Statute is declared: But it is manifest by the
said Statute, Corn is none of the victuals thereby intended. Nevertheless
some ill-affected persons endeavoring to bring a charge upon the subjects
contrary to Law, did surmise that the prices of Corn might be rated, and set
according to the direction of that Statute, and thereupon great gain might be
raised to his Majesty, by licenses and dispensations for selling Corn at
other prices: And a command from his Majesty being procured to the Judges, and
sent to them by William Noye Esquire, his Majesty's then Attorney general; to
deliver their opinions touching the question, whether Corn was such victuals
as was intended to have the price rated within the said Statute: In answer to
which demand, the said Sir Robert Berkley then being one of his Majesty's
Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, in furtherance of the said unlawful
charge, endeavored to be imposed, as aforesaid, the 30. day of November, in the
8. year of his now Majesty's Reign, did deliver his opinion, that Corn was
such victual as was intended to have the price rated within the said Statute;
which said opinion was contrary to Law, and to the plain sense, and meaning of
the said Statute; and contrary to his own knowledge, and was given and
delivered by him, with a purpose and intention, that the said unlawful charge
might be imposed upon the Subject.

3 That an information being preferred in the Court of Star Chamber by they
said William Noy, his Majesty's then Attorney general, against John Overman,
and fifteen other Soape makers Defendants, charging them with several
pretended offenses, contrary to diverse Letters Patents and Proclamations,
touching the making and uttering Soape, and using the trade of Soape-makers,
and other offenses in the said Information mentioned, whereunto the Defendants
did plead, and demurre as to part, and answer to other part of the said
Information: And the said Plea and demurter being overruled, for that the
particulars therein insisted upon, would appear more fully after answer and
proof; therefore the Defendants were ordered to answer without prejudice, and
were to be admitted to such exceptions to the said Information, and advantages
of the matter of the Plea and demurrer upon the hearing as shall be material;
and accordingly the Defendants did put in their answers, and set forth several
Acts of Parliament, Letters Patents, Charters, Customs, and Acts of
Common Council of the City of London, and other matters materially conducing
to their defense; and in conclusion pleaded not guilty. The said Sir Robert
Berkley then being one of the Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, upon the
30. day of March, in the eighth year of his Majesty's now reign, upon an
Order of Reference to him and others by the said Court of Star Chamber, to
consider of the impertinencie of the said answers, did certify the said Court
of Star Chamber, that the whole answers, excepting the four words and ten last
lines, should be expunged, leaving thereby no more in substance of the said
answers, then the Plea of not guilty. And after upon a Reference to him and
others, by order of the said Court, of the impertinencie of the Interrogatories
and depositions of witnesses taken on the Defendants part; in the same case the
said Sir Robert Berkley, upon the second day of May, in the eighth year of his
now Majesty's reign, certified that nine and thirty of the said
Interrogatories, and the depositions upon them taken, should be suppressed,
with answers (except as aforesaid) and depositions, although the same did
contain the said Defendants most material defense. Yet were expounged and
suppressed according to the said Certificates; both which said Certificates
were contrary to Law, and Justice, and contrary to his the said Sir Robert
Berkley's own knowledge, and contrary to the said former order, whereby the
advantages were saved to the Defendants, as aforesaid: And by reason thereof,
the said John Overman, and the said other fifteen Defendants, were sentenced
in the said Court of Star Chamber, to be committed prisoners to the Fleet, and
disabled from using their trade of Soape-makers: And one of them fined in a
thousand five hundred pounds; two of them in a thousand pound a piece; four of
them in a thousand Mark a piece; the rest five hundred pounds a piece; which
fines were estreated into the Exchequer without any mitigation: And the said
Defendants according to the said sentence were imprisoned, and deprived of
their trade and livelihood, tending to the utter ruin of the said Defendants,
and to the overthrow of free trade, and contrary to the liberty of Subjects.

4 That he the said Sir Robert Berkley then being one of the Justices of the
Court of Kings Bench, and having taken an oath for the due administration of
Justice, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, to his Majesty's
liege people, on or about the last of December subscribed an opinion, in haec
verba: [I am of opinion, that as where the benefit does more particularly
redound to the good of the Ports, or Maritime parts, (as in case of Pyracie or
Depredations upon the Seas) there the charge has been, and may be lawfully
imposed upon them, according to presidents of former times; so where the good
and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole kingdom in
danger, (of which his Majesty is the only Judge) there the charge of the
defense ought to be borne by all the Realm in general: this I hold agreeable
both to Law and reason.]

5 That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices of the
Court of Kings Bench, and duly sworn as aforesaid, in February 1636.
subscribed an extrajudiciall opinion, in answer to questions in a letter from
his Majesty, in haec verba:

Charles R. When the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned,
and the whole kingdom in danger, whether may not the King, by writ under the
great Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this kingdom, at their
charge, to provide and furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual and
Munition; and for such time, as he shall think fit, for the defense and
safeguard of the kingdom, from such danger and peril; and by Law compel the
doing thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse? And whether in such case
is not the King the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when, and how the same
is to be prevented and avoided? C. R.

May it please your most excellent Majesty, We have, according to your
Majesty's command, severally every man by himself, and all of us together,
taken into serious consideration the Case and Question signed by your Majesty,
and enclosed in your Royal letter; and we are of opinion, that when the good
and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole kingdom in
danger, your Majesty may, by writ under the great Seal of England, command
all your Subjects of this your kingdom, at their charge, to provide and
furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual and Munition; and for such time
as your Majesty shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the
kingdom, from such danger and peril; And that by Law your Majesty may
compel the doing thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse: And we are
also of opinion that in such case, your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the
danger, and when, and how the same is to be prevented and avoided. John
Brampston, John Finch, Humphrey Davenport, John Denham, Richard Hutton, William
Jones, George Crook, Thomas Trevor, George Vernon, Robert Berkley, Francis
Crawley, Richard Weston.

6 That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices of the
Court of Kings Bench, and duly sworn as aforesaid, did on the (...) deliver
his opinion in the Exchequer Chamber, against John Hampden Esquire in the Case
of Ship Money, That he the said John Hampden upon the matter and substance of
the Case, was chargeable with the money then in question: A copy of which
proceeding, and judgment, the Commons of this present Parliament have
delivered to your Lordships.

7 That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Justices of the
Court of Kings Bench, and one of the Justices of Assize for the County of
York; did at the Assizes held at York in Lent, 1636. deliver in his charge to
the grand Jurie, that it was a lawful and inseparable flower of the Crown,
for the King to command not only the Maritime Counties, but also those that
were Inland, to find ships for the defense of the Kingdom. And then likewise
falsely, and maliciously affirmed, that it was not his single judgment, but
the judgment of all his brethren, witnessed by their subscriptions: And then
also said, that there was a rumor that some of his Brethren that had
subscribed, were of a contrary judgment; but it was a base and unworthy thing,
for any to give his hand contrary to his heart; and then wished for his own
part that his hand might rot from his arm, that was guilty of any such crime;
when as he knew that Mr. Justice Hutton and Mr. Justice Crook, who had
subscribed, were of a contrary opinion, and was present when they were
persuaded to subscribe; and did subscribe for conformity, only because the
major number of the Judges had subscribed. And he the said Sir Robert Berkley
then also said, that in some Cases the Judges were above an Act of Parliament;
which said false and malicious words were uttered, as aforesaid, with intent
and purpose to countenance and maintain the said unjust opinions. and to
terrify his Majesty's Subjects that should refuse to pay Ship Money, or seek
any remedy by Law against the said unjust and illegal taxation.

8 That whereas Richard Chambers Merchant having commenced a suit for trespass
and false imprisonment against Sir Edward Bromfield Knight, for imprisoning him
the said Chambers for refusing to pay Ship Money, in the time that the said Sir
Edward Bromfield was Lord Mayor of the City of London, in which suit the said
Sir Edward Bromfield did make a special justification: The said Sir Robert
Berkley then being one of the Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, in Trinity
Term last, then sitting on the Bench in the said Court, upon debate of the
said Case, between the said Chambers and Sir Edward Bromfield, said openly in
the said Court, that there was a rule of Law, and a rule of government: And
that many things which might not be done by the rule of Law, might be done by
the rule of government; and would not suffer the point of legality of
Ship Money to be argued by the said Chambers his Council; all which opinions,
declarations, words and speeches, contained in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth Articles, are destructive to the fundamental Laws of this
Realm, the Subjects right of property, and contrary to former resolutions in
Parliament, and to the petition of right: which resolutions in Parliament and
petition of right were well known to him, and resolved, and enacted, when he
was the Kings Sergeant at law, and attendant in the Lords house of Parliament.

9 That he the said Sir Robert Berkley, then being one of the Judges of the
Court of Kings Bench, and being in commission of the Peace, and duly sworn to
execute the office of a Justice of Peace in the County of Hertford, on or about
the seventh of January, 1638. at which time the general Sessions of the Peace
for the said County were there holden: The said Sir Robert Berkley, then and
there sitting on the Bench, did revile and threaten the grand Jurie returned to
serve at the said Sessions, for presenting the removal of the Communion Table
in All Saints Church in Hertford aforesaid out of the place where it anciently
and usually stood, and setting it Altar-wayes, against the Laws of this
Realm, in that Case made and provided, as an innovation in matters concerning
the Church; the said grand Jurie having delivered to them in charge at the said
Sessions, by Master Sergeant Atkins a Justice of Peace of the said County of
Hertford, that by the oath they had taken, they were bound to present all
innovations concerning Church matters. And he the said Sir Robert Berkley
compelled the foreman of the Jurie, to tell him who gave him any such
information, and thereby knowing it to be one Henry Brown, one of the said
grand Jurie, he asked the said Brown how he durst meddle with Church matters;
who affirming that in the said charge from Master Sergeant Atkins, the said
Jurie were charged so to do; he the said Sir Robert Berkley told the said
Brown, he should therefore find (...) for the good behavior: and that he
the said Sir Robert Berkley would set a great fine on his head, to make him an
example to others; and thereupon the said Brown offered sufficient bail: but
he the said Sir Robert Berkley, being incensed against him, refused the said
bail, and committed the said Brown to prison, where he lay in Irons till the
next morning, and used to the said Brown and the rest of the Jurors, many
other reviling and terrifying speeches; and said, he knew no Law for the said
presentment, and told the said Brown that he had sinned in the said
presentment: And he compelled the said grand Jurors to say, they were sorry
for what they had done in that presentment; and did bid them to trample the
said presentment under their feet, and caused Brown to tear the said
presentment in his sight. And he the said Sir Robert Berkley, when as John
Houland, and Ralph Pemberton late Mayor of St. Albans, came to desire his
opinion on several Indictments against John Brown Parson of Saint Albans, and
Anthony Smith Vicar of St. Peter's in Saint Albans, at the quarter Sessions
held for the said town of St. Albans on the four and twentieth of June, 1639.
for the removal of the Communion Table out of the usual place, and not
administering the Sacrament according to the Law in that Case provided, He the
said Sir Robert Barkley then told them that such an Indictment was before him
at Hertford, and that he quashed the same, and imprisoned the Promoters; by
which threatening and reviling speeches, unjust actions and declarations he so
terrified the Jurors in those parts, that they durst not present any
Innovations in Church matters, to their great grief and trouble of their
consciences.

And whereas several indictments were preferred against John Brook Parson of
Yarmouth by John Ingrane and John Carter, for refusing several times to
administer the Sacrament of the Lords supper to them without any lawful cause,
at the Assizes held at Norwich in (...) 1633. he the said Sir Robert Berkley
then being one of the Judges of the Assize* proceeded then to the trial on the
said Indictments; where the matter in issue being, that the said Brook refused
to administer the said Sacrament, because the said Ingram and Carter would not
receive tickets with their Sir-names before their Christen-names, which was a
course never used amongst them but; by the said Brook; He the said Sir Robert
Berkley did then much discourage the said Ingrams Council, and overruled the
cause for matter of Law, so as the Jurie never went from the Bar but there
found for the said Brook. And the said Sir Robert Berkley bound the said
Ingram to the good behavior for prosecuting the said Indictments; and ordered
him to pay costs to the said Brook for wrongfully inditing him. And whereas
the said Carter, not expecting the trial at the same Assizes, he preferred his
Indictment, was then absent, whereupon the said Sir Robert Berkley did cause to
be entered on the said Indictment, a vacat quia non sufficiens in lege, and
ordered an attachment against the said Carter, which said proceedings against
the said Ingram and Carter, by the said Sir Robert Berkley, were contrary to
Law and Justice, and to his own knowledge.

10. That the said Sir Rob. Berkley, being one of the Justices of the Court of
Kings Bench, and duly sworn as aforesaid, in Trinity Term, an. 1637.
deferred to discharge or bail Alexander Jennings prisoner in the Fleet,
brought by Habeas Corpus to the Bar of the said Court, the return of his
Commitment being, that he was committed by two several warrants from the Lords
of the Council, dated the fifth of November 1636. the first being only read in
Court expressing no cause, the other for not paying Messengers fees; and until
he should bring a certificate that he had paid his Assessement for Ship Money
in the County of Bucks, but remitted him: And in Michaelmas Term after, the
said Jennings being brought by another Habeas Corpus before him, as aforesaid,
and the same returned; yet he the said Sir Robert Berkley, refused to discharge
or bail him, but remitted him. And, in Easter Term, after several rules were
given for his Majesty's Council to show cause why the said Jenings should not
be bailed, a fourth rule was made for the said Jenings, to let his Majesty's
Attorney General have notice thereof, and notice was given accordingly; and
the said Jenings by another Habeas Corpus, brought to the Bar in Trinity
Term after, and the same return with this addition of a new Commitment of the
fourth of May, suggesting he the said Jenings had used diverse scandalous words
in derogation and disparagement of his Majesty's government: He the said
Jenings after several rules in the end of the said Trinity Term, was again
remitted to prison. And he the said Sir Robert Berkley, did on the fifth of
June last, defer to grant his Majesty's Writ of Habeas Corpus, for William
Pargiter and Samuel Danvers Esquires, prisoners in the Gate House, and in the
Fleet: And afterward having granted the said Writ of Habeas Corpus, the said
Pargiter and Danvers were on the eighth of June last, brought to the Bar of
the said Court, where the returns of their Commitments were several warrants
from the Lords of the Council, not expressing any cause; yet he the said Sir
Robert Berkley, then sitting in the said Court, deferred to bail the said
Pargiter and Danvers, and the eighteenth of June last, made a rule for a new
return to be received, which were returned the five and twentieth of June
last, in haec verba:

Whereas his Majesty finding that his subjects of Scotland, have in rebellious
and hostile manner assembled themselves together, and intend not only to shake
off their obedience unto his Majesty, but also as enemies to invade and infest
this his Kingdom of England, to the danger of his Royal Person, etc.

For prevention whereof, his Majesty has by the advice of his Councell-board,
given special commandment to all the Lord Lievtenants of all the Counties of
this Realm, appointed for their Randenvouz, in their several and respective
Counties, there to be conducted and drawn together into a body for this
service. And whereas his Majesty, according to the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm, and the constant custom of his Predecessors, Kings and Queens of
this Realm, has power for the defense of this kingdom, and resisting the
force of the Enemies thereof, to grant forth Commissions under his great Seal
to such fit persons as he shall make choice of, to array and arm the Subjects
of this kingdom, and to compel those who are of able body, and of able
estates, to arm themselves; and such as should not be able of bodies, but of
ability in estate, to assesse them according to their estates, to contribute
toward the charge of arraying and arming others, being able of body, and not
able in estate, to arm themselves. And such persons as should be contrariant
to commit to prison, there to remain until the King should take further order
therein.

And whereas the Earl of Exeter, by virtue of his Majesty's Commission to him
directed, for the arraying and arming of a certain number of persons in the
County of Northampton, has assest William Pargiter, being a man unfit of body
for that service, but being of estate and ability fit to contribute amongst
others, to pay the sum of five shillings toward the arraying and arming of
others of able bodies, and wanting ability to array and arm themselves.

And whereas we have received information from the said Earl, that the said
William Pargiter has not only in a wilful and disobedient manner refused to
pay the said money assessed upon him toward so important a service, to the
disturbance and hinderance of the necessary defense of this kingdom; but also
by his ill example has misled many others, and, as we have just cause to
believe, has practiced to seduce others from that ready obedience which they
owe, and would otherwise have yielded to his Majesty's just command, for the
public defense of his person and kingdom; which we purpose with all convenient
speed to enquire further of and examine.

These are therefore to will and require you, to take into your custody the
persons of the said William Pargiter, and Samuel Danvers; and them safely to
keep prisoners till further order from this Board, or until by due course of
Law they shall be delivered: Yet he the said Sir Robert Berkley, being desired
to bail the said Pargiter and Danvers, remitted them, where they remained
prisoners till the ninth of November last, or thereabouts, although the said
Jennings, Pargiter, and Danvers, on all and every the said returns, were
clearly baileable by Law; and the Council of the said Jennings, Pargiter, and
Danvers* offered in Court very sufficient bail. And he the said Sir Robert
Berkley, being one of the Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, denied to grant
his Majesty's Writs of Habeas Corpus to very many others his Majesty's
subjects; and when he had granted the said Writs of Habeas Corpus to very many
others his Majesty's subjects, and on the return no cause appeared, or such
only as was clearly baileable by Law; yet he remanded them, where they
remained prisoners very long; which said deferring to grant the said Writs of
Habeas Corpus, and refusals, and delays to discharge prisoners, or suffer them
to be bailed, contained in this Article, are destructive to the fundamental
Laws of this Realm, and contrary to former resolutions in Parliament, and to
the petition of Right; which said resolutions and petition of Right were well
known to him the said Sir Robert Berkley, and were resolved on and enacted,
when he was the Kings Sergeant at Law, and Attendant in the Lords House in
Parliament.

11 That whereas there was a cause depending in the Court Christian at Norwich,
between Samuel Booty Clerk, and (...) Collard for 2.s. in the l. for tithes,
for rents, and houses in Norwich, and the said Collard moved by his Council in
the Court of Kings Bench for a prohibition to stay proceedings in the Court
Christian at Norwich, and delivered into the said Court of Kings Bench his
suggestions, that the said cause in the said Court Christian was only for
tithes for rents of houses in Norwich, which was determinable by the Common Law
only: yet he the said Sir Robert Berkley, being one of the Justices of the
said Court of Kings Bench, and sitting in the said Court, deferred to grant a
Prohibition to the said Court Christian in the said cause, although the
Council did move in the said Court many several times, and several terms
for a Prohibition: And he the said Sir Bobert Berkley deferred to grant his
Majesty's writ of Prohibition to several other Courts on the motions of diverse
others of his Majesty's subjects, where the same by the Laws of this Realm
ought to have been granted, contrary to the Laws of this Realm, and his own
knowledge.

All which words, opinions, and actions, were so spoken and done by him the
said Sir Robert Berkley traitorously and wickedly to alienate the hearts of his
Majesty's liege people from his Majesty, and to set a division betwixt them,
and to subvert the fundamental Laws and established government of his
Majesty's Realm of England: For which they do impeach him the said Sir Robert
Berkley one of the Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, of high treason
against our Sovereign Lord the King his Crown and Dignity, and of the
misdemeanors abovementioned.

And the said Commons by protestation, saving to themselves only the liberties
of exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other accusation or impeachment
against the said Sir Robert Berkley, and also of replying to the answer, that
he the said Sir Robert Berkley shall make to the said Articles, or any of them,
or of offering proof of the premises, or any other impeachments or
accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case shall according to the
course of Parliaments require, Do pray that the said Sir Robert Berkley, one
of the Justices of the Court of Kings Bench, may be put to answer to all and
every the premises; and that such poceedings, examinations, trialls,
judgments and executions, may be upon every of them had and used, as is
agreeable to Law and Justice.

Articles of the House of Commons, in the name of themselves, and all the
Commons of England, against Sir John Brampston Knight, Lord chief Justice of
the Court of Kings Bench, impeaching him as follows.
1. THat the said Sir John Brampston, then being Lord Chief Justice of the
Court of Kings Bench, and having taken an oath for the due administration of
justice to his Majesty's liege people, according to the Laws and Statutes of
this Realm, did on or about the last of November 1635. subscribe his name to
an opinion, in haec verba: [I am of opinion, that as where the benefit does
more peculiarly redound to the good of the Ports, or Maritime ports, (as in
case of Pyracie or Depredations upon the Seas) there the charge has been, and
may be lawfully imposed upon them, according to presidents of former times; so
where the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the
whole kingdom in danger, (of which his Majesty is the only Judge) there the
charge of the defense ought to be borne by all the realm in general: this I
hold agreeable both to Law and reason.]

2 That he the said Sir John Brampston, then being Lord chief Justice of the
Court of Kings Bench, about the Month of February, 1635. did subscribe an
extrajudiciall opinion in answer to questions in a letter from his Majesty,
which letter, questions and answer follow, in haec verba;

Charles R. When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned,
and the whole kingdom in danger, whether may not the King, by writ under the
great Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this kingdom, at their
charge, to provide and furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual and
Munition; and for such time, as he shall think fit, for the defense and
safeguard of the kingdom, from such danger and peril; and by Law compel the
doing thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse? And whether in such case
is not the King the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when, and how the same
is to be prevented and avoided? C. R.

May it please your most excellent Majesty, We have, according to your
Majesty's command, severally every man by himself, and all of us together,
taken into serious consideration the Case and Question signed by your Majesty,
and enclosed in your Royal letter; and we are of opinion, that when the good
and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole kingdom in
danger, your Majesty may, by writ under the great Seal of England, command
all the Subjects of this your kingdom, at their charge, to provide and furnish
such number of Ships with Men, Victual and Munition; and for such time as your
Majesty shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the kingdom, from
such danger and peril; and that by Law your Majesty may compel the doing
thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse: And we are also of opinion
that in such case your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger, and when,
and how the same is to be prevented and avoided. John Brampston, John Finch,
Humphrey Davenport, John Denham, Richard Hutton, William Jones, George Crook,
Thomus Trevor, George Vernon, Robert Berkley, Francis Crawley, Richard Weston.

Which said opinions contained in the first and second Articles, are
destructive to the fundamental Laws of this Realm, the subjects right of
property, and contrary to former resolutions in Parliament, and to the petition
of right.

3 That he the said Sir John Brampston, then Lord chief Justice of the Court of
Kings Bench, about Trinity Term, 1637. refused to bail or discharge Alexander
Jennings prisoner in the Fleet, brought by Habeas Corpus to the bar before
him, the return of this Commitment being two several warrants from the Lords
of the Council, dated the fifth of November 1635. the first expressing no
cause, the other for not paying messengers fees, and until he should bring
certificate that he had paid his Assessement for ship money, in the County of
Bucks: And the said Sir John Brampston, the first warrant being only read,
then said, The cause of this Commitment did not appear; and it was not fit for
every Jailer to be made acquainted by the Lords of the Council why they
committed, and therefore remitted him; and in Michaelmas Term after, the said
Jennings being brought by another Habeas Corpus, as aforesaid, and the same
returned, yet he the said Sir John Brampston, refused to discharge or bail
him, but remitted him. And in Easter Term next, after several rules for his
Majesty's Council to show cause why he the said Jennings should not be bailed,
a fourth rule was made for the said Jennings, to let his Majesty's Attorney
have notice, which notice was given accordingly, yet he remitted him. And the
said Jennings by another Habeas Corpus brought to the Bar, as aforesaid, in
Trinity Term after, and the same return with the addition of a new Commitment
of the fourth of May, 1638. suggested, that he the said Jennings had used
diverse scandalous words in derogation and disparagement of his Majesty's
government; after several rules, in the end of the said Trinity Term, he
again remitted him to prison. And he the said Sir John Brampston, about the
ninth of July after, at his chamber in Sergeants Inn, being desired by Master
Meautis, one of the Clerks of the Councell-board, to discharge the said
Jennings, for that he the said Jennings had entered into a Bond of 1000. pounds,
to appear before the Lords of the Council the next Michelmas Term after, and
to attend de die in diem; yet he the said Sir John Brampston refused to
discharge the said Jennings until he entered into Recognizance to appear the
next Term, and in the mean time to be of his good behavior. And the said
Jennings was continued on his said Recognizance till Easter Term after. And
the said Sir John Brampston, did on the 5. of June, 1640. defer to grant his
Majesty's writ of habeas Corpus for Samuel Danvers, and William Pargiter
Esquires, prisoners in the Gate House, and in the Fleet; and when he had
granted the said writ, the said eighth of June after the return, being the
order of the Council Table, not expressing any cause, he the said Sir John
Brampston deferred to bail the said Pargiter. And the eighteenth of June after
made a rule for a new return to be received, which was returned the five and
twentieth of the said June, in haec verba:

Whereas his Majesty finding that his Subjects of Scotland, have in rebellious
and hostile manner assembled themselves together, and intend not only to shake
off their obedience unto his Majesty, but also as enemies to invade and infest
this his Kingdom of England, to the danger of his royal person, etc.

For prevention whereof his Majesty has, by the advice of his Councell-board,
given special commandment to all the Lord Lievtenants of all the Counties of
his Realm. with expedition, to array and arm a certain number of able men in
each County, to be prepared, and ready to be conducted to such place as should
be appointed for their Randezvouz, in their several and respective Counties,
there to be conducted and drawn together into a body for this service.

And whereas his Majesty, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm,
and the constant custom of his Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm
has power, for the defense of this Kingdom, and resisting the force of the
enemies thereof, to grant forth Commissions under his great Seal to such fit
persons as he shall make choice of, to array and arm the subjects of this
Kingdom, and to compel those who are of able bodies, and of able estates, to
arm themselves; and such as should not be of able bodies, but of ability in
estate, to assesse them according to their estates, to contribute toward the
charge of arraying and arming others being able of body, and not able in estate
to arm themselves: And such persons as should be contrariant to commit to
prison, there to remain until the King should take further order therein.

And whereas the Earl of Exeter, by virtue of his Majesty's Commission to him
directed, for the arraying and arming of a certain number of persons in the
County of Northampton, has assest William Pargiter being a man unfit of body
for that service, but being of estate and ability fit to contribute, amongst
others, to pay the sum of five shillings toward the arraying and arming of
others of able bodies, and wanting ability to arm and array themselves.

And whereas we have received information from the said Earl, that the said
William Pargiter has not only in a wilful and disobedient manner refused to
pay the said money assessed upon him toward so important a service, to the
disturbance and hinderance of the necessary defense of this Kingdom; but also
by his ill example has misled many others, and, as we have just cause to
believe, has practiced to (...) others from that ready obedience which they
owe, and would otherwise have yielded to his Majesty's just command, for the
public defense of his person and Kingdom; which we purpose with all
convenient speed to enquire further of and examine.

These are therefore to will and require you to take into your custody the
person of the said William Pargiter, and him also safely to keep prisoner till
further order from this Board, or until by due course of Law he shall be
delivered (And the like return was then made in all things, mutatis mutandis,
concerning the said Danvers for not paying a sum of money assessed upon him:)
yet he the said Sir John Brampston defered to bail the said Danvers and
Pargiter, but remitted the said Danvers to the Fleet, where he remained till
the twefth of July, 1640. and the said Pargiter to the pison of the Gate House,
where he remained till the ninth of November last, although the said Jennings,
Danvers and Pargiter, upon all and every the said returns, ought to have been
discharged or bailed by Law; and the Council of the said Jennings, Danvers and
Pargiter offered in Court very sufficient bail. And he the said Sir John
Brampston being chief Justice of the Court of Kings Bench, denied to grant his
Majesty's writ of habeas Corpus to very many others his Majesty's subjects: and
when he had granted the said writs of habeas Corpus to very many others his
Majesty's subjects, and on the return no cause appeared, or such cause only
as was clearly baileable by Law, yet he remanded them, where they remained
prisoners very long; which said deferring to grant the said writs of habeas
Corpus, and refusal, and delays to discharge prisoners, or suffer them to be
bailed, contained in this Article, are destructive to the fundamental Laws of
this Realm, and contrary to former resolutions in Parliament, and to the
petition of Right; which said resolutions and petition of Right were well
known to him the said Sir John Brampston.

4 That whereas there was a cause depending in the Court Christian at Norwich,
between Samuel Booty Clerk, and (...) Collard for two shillings in the pound
for tithes for rents of houses in Norwich, and the said Collard moved by his
Council in the Court of Kings Bench for a prohibition to stay proceedings in
the Court Christian at Norwich, and delivered into the said Court of Kings
Bench his suggestions, that the said cause in the said Court Christian was for
tithes for rents of houses in Norwich, which was determinable by the Common Law
only; yet he the said Sir John Brampston, being chief Justice of the said
Court of Kings bench, and sitting in the said court, deferred to grant a
prohibition to the said Court christian in the said cause, although the
Council did move in the said court several times and several Terms for a
prohibition: And he the said Sir John Bramston deferred to grant his
Majesty's Writ of prohibition to several other Courts on the motions of diverse
others his Majesty's subjects, where the same by the laws of this Realm ought
to have been granted, contrary to the laws of this Realm and his own
knowledge.

And the said Commons by Protestation saving to themselves only the liberties
of exhibiting at anytime hereafter, any other accusation or impeachment, etc.
ut supra, in the former charge.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and of all the
Commons of England, against Sir Francis Crawley Knight, one of the Justices of
his Majesty's Court of Common Pleas, impeaching him as follows.
1. THat he about the Month of November Anno Dom. 1635. then being one of the
Justices of the Court of Common Pleas, and having taken an oath for the due
administration of Justice to his Majesty's liege people, according to the Laws
and Statutes of this Realm, subscribed an opinion in haec verba: [I am of
opinion, that as where the benefit does more peculiarly redound to the good of
the Ports, or Maritime parts, (as in case of Pyracie or Depredations upon the
Seas) there the charge has been, and may be lawfully imposed upon them,
according to presidents of former times; so where the good and safety of the
Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole kingdom in danger, (of which
his Majesty is the only Judge) there the charge of the defense ought to be
borne by all the Realm in general: this I hold agreeable both to Law and
reason.]

2. That he, in or about the month of February, An. Dom. 1636. then being one
of the Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas, subscribed an extrajudiciall
opinion, in answer to questions in a letter from his Majesty, in haec verba:

Charles R. When the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned,
and the whole kingdom in danger, Whether may not the King, by writ under the
great Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this kingdom, at their
charge, to provide and furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual and
Munition; and for such time as he shall think fit for the defense and
safeguard of the Kingdom from such danger and peril, and by Law compel the
doing thereof, in case of refusal, or refractorinesse: And whether in such
case is not the King the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when, and how the
same is to be prevented and avoided, C.R.

May it please your most excellent Majesty, we have, according to your
Majesty's command, severally every man by himself, and all of us together,
taken into serious consideration the Case and Question signed by your Majesty,
and enclosed in your Royal letter; and we are of opinion, that when the good
and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole kingdom in
danger, your Majesty may, by Writ under the great Seal of England, command
all the Subjects of this your Kingdom, at their charge, to provide and furnish
such number of Ships, with Men, Victual and Munition, and for such time as
your Majesty shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the Kingdom,
from such danger and peril; and that by Law your Majesty may compel the
doing thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse: And we are also of
opinion that in such case your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger,
and when, and how the same is to be prevented and avoided. John Brampston,
John Finch, Humphrey Davenport, John Denham, Richard Hutton, William Jones,
George Crook, Thomas Trevor, George Vernon, Robert Berkley, Francis Crawley,
Richard Weston.

3 That he then being one of the Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas,
delivered an opinion in the Exchequer Chamber against John Hampden Esquire, in
case of Ship Money; that he the said John Hampden upon the matter and
substance of the case, was chargeable with the money then in question, (a Copy
of which proceedings and judgment, the Commons of this present Parliament have
already delivered to your Lordships.)

4 That he then being one of the Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas,
declared and published in the Exchequer Chamber, and Westminster Circuits,
where he went Judge, That the Kings Right to Ship Money was so inherent a Right
in the Crown, as an Act of Parliament could not take it away. And with diverse
malicious speeches enveighed against, threatened and discountenanced such as
refused to pay Ship Money. All which opinions and judgments contained in the
first, second, and third Articles, are destructive to the fundamental Laws of
this Realm, the Subjects right of property, and contrary to former
resolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right, which said resolutions
and Petition of Right were well known to him.

And the said Commons by protestation, saving to themselves only the Liberties
of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other accusation or impeachment against
the said Sir Francis Crawley, and also of replying to the answer that he the
said Sir Francis Crawley shall make unto the said Articles, or any of them, or
of offering proof of the premises, or of any of their impeachments, or
accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case shall according to the
course of Parliaments require, Do pray that the said Sir Francis Crawley, one
of the Justices of the said Court of Common Pleas, may be put to answer to all
and every the premises; and that such proceedings, examinations, trialls, and
judgments may be upon every of them had and used, as is agreeable to Law and
Justice.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and of all the
Commons of England, against Sir Humphrey Davenport Knight, Lord chief Baron of
his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, impeaching him as follows.
THat whereas in the month of October, in the fourth year of his Majesty's
Reign, the Farmours and Officers of the Custom House, having seized great
quantities of Currants, being the goods of Samuel Vassal Merchant, and having
conveyed them into certain Storehouses at the Custom House and detained
them, because the said Samuel Vassal refused to pay an imposition of five
shillings six pence upon every hundred weight of the said Currants, pretended
to be due, and demanded by the said Farmours and Officers on his Majesty's
behalf for the said Currants, whereas no such imposition was due or payable
for the same; but the said imposition was and is against the Laws of this
Realm. And whereas also in Michaelmas Term, in the said fourth year of his
Majesty's Reign, his Majesty's then Attorney general exhibited an information
by English Bill in the Exchequer, against the said Samuel Vassal, setting
forth that King James by his Letters Patents dated tertio Novem. in the second
year of his Reign, did command the said imposition of 5. s. 6. d. upon every
hundred weight of Currants should be demanded and received: And that his
Majesty that now is, by his Letters Patents dated the six and twentieth day of
July, in the second year of his Reign, did, by advise of his Privy Council,
declare his will and pleasure be, that Subsidies, Customs and Impost should be
levied in such manner as they were in the time of King James; and the same, and
the Farms thereof to continue until it might receive a settling by Parliament,
and commanded the levying and receiving the same accordingly; and that the said
Samuel Vassal before the said first day of October then last before the said
Information exhibited, did bring into the port of London in ships four
thousand six hundred thirty eight hundred weight of Currants; and that Richard
Carmarthen Surveyour in the said port of London, the said first day of October
demanded of the said Samuel Vassal the said Imposition of five shillings six
pence for every hundred weight of the said Currants; and that the said Samuel
Vassal refused to pay the said imposition, and unjustly detained it from the
King: To which Information the said Samuel Vassal appeared, and pleaded the
Statute of Magna Charta, and the Statute of De Tallagio non concedendo, and
that he was a Subject borne under the Kings Allegiance, and a Merchant of
London using that trade, and that the said sum of five shillings six pence
upon every hundred weight of Currants, was and is malum taluetum, and not
antiqua, seu recta consuetudo, and that it was imposed without assent of
Parliament: to which Plea the said Attorney General demurred in Law, and the
said Samuel Vassal joined in demurer with him; and when the said cause came to
be argued, viz. in Trinity Term, in the sixth year of his Majesty's Reign,
the said Sir Humphrey Davenport being then Lord chief Baron of his Majesty's
said Court of Exchequer, did contrary to his oath, and contrary to the Laws of
this Realm, and to the great impoverishment of the said Samuel Vassal,
publicly deny to hear the Counsel of the said Samuel Vassal to argue for
him, and said, that the Case of the said Samuel Vassal would fall under the
same rule with the case of one Bates, and therefore was already judged: and
when the Council of the said Samuel Vassal answering that they had nothing to
do with Bates his Case, but desired to argue for M. Vassal, the said Sir
Humphrey Davenport replied, that they knew the opinion of the Court, and should
be heard no further; and said, that the King was in possession, and that they
(meaning the said Court of Exchequer) would keep him in possession: And the
said Sir Humphrey Davenport shortly after did (together with the rest of the
then Barons of the said Court of Exchequer) imprison the said Samuel Vassal
for not paying such sums of money, as were pretended by the said Officers of
the Custom House, to be due to his Majesty, and did delay the said Samuel
Vassal from time to time, from having restitution of his said goods, being
often in Court moved thereto, with intention to force the said Samuel Vassal
to pay the said unlawful imposition, and did also give his opinion and
judgment upon the said Information for the King, and against the said Samuel
Vassal; and by several orders for that purpose made, did continue the
possession of the said goods in the King, and the said Samuel Vassal could
never obtain any restitution at all of his said goods: whereas it was
commanded to the Sheriff of the County of York, by Writ under the Seal of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, dated the sixteenth day of May in the seventh
year of his Majesty's Reign that now is, That he should distraine James
Maleverer Esquire, to appear before the Barons of his Majesty's said Court of
Exchequer, in the Octaves of the holy Trinity then next following, to make fine
to the King for his trespass and contempt in not coming to the presence of
the King before the 31. day of January in the first year of his said Majesty's
Reign, to take upon him the order of Knighthood, according to the form of a
Proclamation in that behalf formerly made: At which day of the said Octaves of
the holy Trinity, the said J. Maleverer did appear, and pleaded to the said
Writs, that although his said Majesty, the said 31. day of January, and for
three years next before, the said 31. day of January was resident and
remaining at his Palace at White Hall in the County of Middlesex, and that the
said James Maleverer the said one and thirtieth day of January, and three days
next before the said one and thirtieth day of January, was resident and
remaining at Ancliffe in the said County of York, which is distant from the
said Palace of White Hall, the space of one hundred and fourscore miles; and
that the said James Maleverer the said one and thirtieth day of January
aforesaid, or at any time before, had no lands or rents in his own hands, or in
the hands of Peoffees, to his use, out of the said County of York, and that
that part of the said County of York which is nearest to the said Palace of
White Hall, is distant from the said Palace of White Hall the space of one
hundred and thirty miles; and that no Proclamation by virtue of any Writ of
Proclamation, for the appearance of any persons whatsoever, to take the said
Order of Knighthood, was made in any part of the said County of York before the
thirtieth day of January in the said first year of his Majesty's Reign, by
reason whereof the said James Maleverer could not personally come to the
presence of his said Majesty to take the said Order of Knighthood before the
said one and thirtieth day of January in the said first year of his Majesty's
said Reign, yet the said James Maleverer for his fine in the premises did
humbly submit himself to the said Court, and demanded to be discharged of the
said issues returned and imposed upon him by reason of the premises; yet
notwithstanding the said Plea and submission of the said James Maleverer, and
after the same was made as aforesaid, and entered upon Record in his Majesty's
said Court of Exchequer, and the said Court moved for stay of the Process, and
discharge of the issues, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport being then Lord chief
Baron of the said Court of Exchequer, contrary to his oath, and contrary to the
Laws of this Realm, and to the great impoverishing of the said James
Maleverer, did (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court)
refuse to impose any Fine whatsoever upon the said James Maleverer, and told
him that the said Court had no power to Fine him, and that he must compound
with certain Commissioners for that purpose appointed. And did farther, order
and direct several other Writs of Distringas, to issue forth of his Majesty's
said Court of Exchequer, under the Seal of the said Court, directed to the
several high Sheriffs of the said County of York; whereby the said Sheriffs
were commanded further to distraine the said James Maleverer to appear, as
aforesaid: upon which said Writs of Distringas, several great and excessive
issues were returned upon the Lands of the said James Maleverer, amounting to
the sum of two thousand pounds or there abouts; a great part whereof, the
said James Maleverer was enforced to pay; and in like manner the said Sir
Humphrey Davenport (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court
of Exchequer) did order and direct such and the like unjust and undue
proceedings; and the said proceedings were had and made accordingly against
Thomas Moyser Esquire, and against several other persons his Majesty's
Subjects in several parts of this Realm, to the utter undoing of many of them.

2 That a sentence of Degradation, being given by the high Commissioners of the
Province of York, against Peter Smart, Clerk, one of the Prebends of the Church
of Durham, for a Sermon by him formerly preached against some Innovations in
the Church of Durham, a trial was afterward had, viz. in August in the
seventh year of his said Majesty's Reign, before the said Sir Humphrey
Davenport Knight, then one of the Judges of Assizes and Nisi prius for the
County Palatine of Durham, concerning the Corpse of the Prebend of the said M.
Smart, which was then pretended to be void by the said sentence of Degradation;
the said Sir Humphrey Davenport contrary to his oath, and contrary to the Laws
of this Realm, and to the destruction of the said Master Smart, upon reading
the Writ de haeretico comburendo, did publicly on the Bench, in the presence
of diverse his Majesty's Subjects then attending, declare his opinion to be,
that the said Prebends place was void, and gave direction to the Jury then at
Bar to find accordingly: and being then informed that although the said
Master Smart had been dead or deprived, yet the profits of his Prebend had been
due to his Executors till the Michaelmas following; the said Sir Humphrey
Davenport then answered, though the said Master Smart was not dead, yet if he
had had his desert, he had been dead long ago, for he deserved to have been
hanged for the said Sermon, and that he was as wicked a man as any lived in the
world: call him no more Master Smart, but plain Smart. And when the said Jurie
had found against the said Master Smart, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport, in
scandal of his Majesty's Government and Justice, and of the proceedings of his
Majesty's Judges, did publicly as aforesaid speak words to this effect; That
the said Jury had well done, and that the said Smart had do remedy save by
appeal to the King; and there he should find but cold comfort; for the King
would not go against his own Prerogative, upon which the Judges and high
Commissioners did depend, and therefore would not contradict one another Acts.

That the said Sir Humphrey Davenport about the Month of November, Anno Dom.
1635. then being Lord chief Barron of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, and
having taken an oath for the due administration of justice to his Majesty's
Liege people, according to the Laws and Statures of this Realm, subscribed his
name to an opinion, in haec verba: [I am of opinion, that as where the benefit
does more particulary redound to the good of the Ports, or Maritime parts, (as
in Case of Pyracie or Depredations upon the Seas) there the charge has been,
and may be lawfully imposed upon them, according to presidents of former times;
so where the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the
whole kingdom in danger, (of which his Majesty is the only Judge) there the
charge of the defense ought to be borne by all the Realm in general: this I
hold agreeable both to Law and reason]

That in or about the month of February Anno Dom. 1636. the said Sir Humphrey
Davenport, then being Lord chief Baron of the said Court of Exchequer,
subscribed an extrajudiciall opinion in answer to questions in a letter from
his Majesty, in haec verba:

Charles R. When the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned,
and the whole kingdom in danger, whether may not the King, by writ under the
great Seal of England, command all the Subjects of this kingdom, at their
charge, to provide and furnish such number of Ships with Men, Victual and
Munition; and for such time, as he shall think fit, for the defense and
safeguard of the kingdom, from such danger and peril; and by Law compel the
doing thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse? And whether in such case
is not the King the sole Judge, both of the danger, and when, and how the same
is to be prevented and avoided? C. R.

May it please your most excellent Majesty, We have, according to your
Majesty's command, severally every man by himself, and all of us together,
taken into serious consideration the Case and Question signed by your Majesty,
and enclosed in your Royal letter; and we are of opinion, that when the good
and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole kingdom in
danger, your Majesty may by writ under the great Seal of England, command all
the Subjects of this your kingdom, at their charge, to provide and furnish
such number of Ships with Men, Victual and Munition; and for such time as your
Majesty shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the kingdom, from
such danger and peril; and that by Law your Majesty may compel the doing
thereof in case of refusal, or refractorinesse: And we are also of opinion
that in such case your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger, and when,
and how the same is to be prevented and avoided. John Brampston, John Finch,
Humphrey Davenport, John Denham, Richard Hutton, William Jones, George Crook,
Thomas Trevor, George Vernon, Robert Berkley, Francis Crawley, Richard Weston.

That whereas an Action of Battery was brought by one Richard Leg, against
Robert Hoblins, to which the said Hoblins pleaded a Justification de son
assault demesne, and the said cause came to trial at the Assizes held for the
County of Gloucester in Summer, 1636. before the said Sir Humphrey Davenport
then one of the Justices of Assize and Nisi prius for that County: At the said
trial the said Robert Hoblins did begin to make proof of his said
justification, and produced one Robert Tilly a witness in the cause, who
proved upon oath that the said Richard Leg did make the first assault upon
the said Robert Hoblins and that the occasion thereof was, that the said
Richard Leg and others came upon the lands then in possession of the said
Hoblins, and did take and drive away eighteen Cowes of the said Hoblins,
pretending they had a warrant from the Sheriff to distrein the same for forty
shillings assessed upon the said Hoblins for Ship Money; and when the said
Hoblins (being present) endeavored to hinder the said Leg and others from
taking away his said Cattle, the said Leg stroke the said Hoblins with a
staff, who afterward defended himself. That upon the opening of the matter
the said Sir Humphrey Davenport would not suffer the said Hoblins to produce
any more witnesses on his behalf, (though the said Hoblins desired that other
of his said witnesses then present, and sworn might be heard) nor his Council
to speak for him, but being informed that the said Hoblins (when Ship Money
was demanded of him) answered, that he would not pay the same, because it was
not granted by Parliament, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport did then (openly in
the hearing of a great number of his Majesty's liege people* then assembled and
attending the said Court) in great passion reprove the said Hoblins, and told
him that the King was not to call a Parliament to give him satisfaction; and
did then and there also falsely and of purpose, to prevent his Majesty's loving
Subjects from the due and ordinary course of Law, and contrary to his oath and
the Laws of this Realm, publish, declare and affirm, that it was adjudged by
all the Judges of England, that Ship Money, was due to the King, and directed
the Jury sworn in that cause to find a Verdict for the said Richard Leg;
and the said Jury did accordingly, and gave him twenty pound damages. And the
said Humphrey Davenport did then also without any cause imprison the said
Robert Hoblins, and bound him to the good behavior. That whereas in the month
of April, Decimo sexto Caroli, the officers of the Custom House, having
seized a Ship of one Samuel Warner's, laden with Tobacco, being the goods of
the said Warner's, the Bulk of the said ship not being broken, and no
information exhibited for the King according to the course of the Exchequer,
for any duty, the Barons were moved, that the said ship might be restored to
the Proprietors, giving security to pay such duties as did belong to the King;
But upon the Allegation of the Kings Attorney, that there needed no information
because there was no penalty, the said Sir Humphrey Davenport, being then Lord
chief Baron of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, together with the rest of the
then Barons of the said Court, did (contrary to his oath, and contrary to the
Laws of this Realm,) deny the restitution of the said ship, unless all the
duties demanded by the Farmours of the Custom House were first paid. Hereupon
the said Warner brought an action of Trover in the office of Pleas in the
Exchequer against the said Officers that seized his ship and goods; whereupon
the Kings Attorney general exhibited an information by English Bill in the
Exchequer chamber against the said Warner; setting forth, that Customs and
Subsidies upon Merchandise were a great part of the Kings revennue, and payable
to him, and that the said Ship was seized for non-payment of the aforesaid
duties, notwithstanding the said Warner then Proprietor, prosecuted the
officers upon a suit at Law, and prays that he may answer the said
Information before any further proceedings be had at Law: Thereupon the said
Sir Humphrey Davenport, together with the rest of the then Barons of the said
Court of Exchequer, ordered, that the Proprietor moving for the delivery of the
said goods, should first answer to the information; after which the said Warner
demurred to the said Information, in regard no title for any certain duty was
set forth by the Information, which demurrer yet remains not overruled; but
the said Sir Humphrey Davenport, with the said other Barons, without
overruling the demurrer, ordered, because Warner had put in a demurrer and not
answered to the said Information, that he should not proceed upon the action
of Trover. The Proprietor being thus prevented of his remedy by Action at Law,
sued forth a Replevin, and upon pretense of viewing the said goods, caused them
to be brought forth of a Cellar, hired by a deputy to the Farmours to that
use; and being brought forth, they were taken by the Sheriffs of London, by
virtue of the said Replevin; and upon oath made of the manner of the taking, as
aforesaid, before the Barons, and upon view of the President, inrolls his case;
the said Sir Humphrey Davenport, with the said other Barons, adjudged, that the
said goods were not Replevisable, and granted an Injunction to maintain
possession of them as they were before. And the said house of Commons by
protestations, saving to themselves only the liberties of exhibiting at any
time hereafter, any other accusation or impeachment against the said Sir
Humphrey Davenport, and also of replying to the answer that he the said Sir
Humphrey Davenport shall make unto the said Articles, or any of them, or of
offering proof of the premises, or any of their impeachments or accusations
that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case shall (according to the course of
Parliaments) require, do pray that the said Sir Humphrey Davenport, Lord
chief Baron of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, may be put to answer to all
and every the premises; and that such proceedings, examinations, trials, and
judgments may be upon every of them had and used, as is agreeable to Law and
Justice.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and all the
Commons of England, against Sir Richard Weston Knight, one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, impeaching him as follows.
1 THat the said Sir Richard Weston about the month of November, Anno Domini
1635. then being one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, and
having taken an oath for the due Administration of Justice to his Majesty's
liege people, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, subscribed
his name to an opinion in haec verba: I am of opinion, etc. ut supra in Sir
Robert Berkley's Charge, page 4.

2 That in or about the month of February, Anno Domini 1636. the said Sir
Richard Weston (being then one of the Barons of the said Court of Exchequer)
subscribed an extrajudiciall opinion in answer to questions in a Letter from
his Majesty, in haec verba:

Charles R. When the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned,
etc. ut supra, page 4.

3 That the said Sir Richard Weston (being then one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer) did deliver his opinion and judgment in the
Exchequer Chamber against John Hampden Esquire in the Case of Ship Money, That
he, the said John Hampden, etc. as in Judge Crawley's Charge, page 23.

4 That whereas in the month of April 16. Caroli, the Officers of the
Custom House having seized a ship of one Samuel Warner's, laden with Tobacco,
being the goods of the said Warner, the bulk of the said ship not being
broken, and no information exhibited for the King, according to the course the
Exchequer, for any duty, the Barons were moved, that the said ship might be
restored to the proprietors, giving security to pay such duties as did belong
to the King. But, upon the allegation of the Kings Attorney, that there needed
no information, because there was no penalty, the said Sir Richard Weston
(being then one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, together
with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court) did (contrary to his oath,
and contrary to the Laws of this Realm) deny the restitution of the said
ship, unless all the duties demanded by the Farmours of the Custom House were
first paid. Hereupon the said Warner brought an action of Trover upon the case
in the Office of Pleas in the Exchequer against the said Officers that seized
his ship and goods: Whereupon the Kings Attorney General exhibited an
information by English Bill in the Exchequer Chamber against the said Warner,
setting forth, that Customs and Subsidies upon Merchandise were a great part
of the Kings revennue, and payable to him, and that the said ship was seized
for non-payment of the aforesaid duties; notwithstanding the said Warner, the
proprietor prosecuted the Officers upon a Suit at Law, and prays that he may
answer the said Information before any further proceedings be had at Law.
Thereupon the said Sir Richard Weston, together with the rest of the then
Barons of the said Court of Exchequer, ordered that the proprietor moving for
delivery of his said goods, should first answer to the Information, after which
the said Warner demurred to the said Information: in regard no title for any
certain duty was set forth by the Information: Which demurrer yet remains not
overruled, but the said Sir Richard Weston (with the said other Barons)
without overruling the demurrer, ordered (because Warner had put in a
demurrer, and not answered to the said Information) that he should not proceed
upon the action of Trover: The proprietor being thus prevented of his remedy by
Action at Law, sued forth a Replevin, and (upon pretense of viewing the said
goods) caused them to be brought forth of a cellar, hired by a Deputy to the
Farmers to that use, and being brought forth, they were taken by the Sheriffs
of London, by virtue of the said Replevin; and upon oath made of the manner of
the taking, as aforesaid, before the Barons, and upon view of the president,
inrolls his case; the said Sir Richard Weston, with the said other Barons,
adjudged that the said goods were not replevisable, and granted an Injunction
to maintain the possession of them, as they were before.

And the said house of Commons by Protestation, saving to themselves only the
liberties of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other accusation or
impeachment against the said Sir Richard Weston, and also of replying to the
answer that he, the said Sir Richard Weston shall make unto the said Articles,
or any of them, or of offering proof of the premises, or any of their
impeachments or accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the case shall
(according to the course of Parliaments) require, do pray, that the said Sir
Richard Weston, one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, may be
put to answer, etc.

Articles of the House of Commons in the name of themselves, and of all the
Commons of England, against Sir Thomas Trevor Knight, one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, impeaching him as follows.
1. THat in or about November, 4. Car. diverse goods and merchandises (whereof
John Rolls, George Moore, and other Merchants of London were Proprietors) being
seized and conveyed into certain Storehouses at the Custom House, by Sir
John Worstenham, Abraham Dawes, and others the Farmours and Officers of the
Customs, and by them there detained, because the said Proprietors refused to
pay the Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, pretended to be due, and demanded by
the said Farmours and Officers on his Majesty's behalf for the said
Merchandises, whereas no such Subsidy or duty of Tonnage or Poundage was due
or payable for the same, no Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage having been
granted by Parliament to his Majesty. The said John Rolls, and other the
Proprietors of the said goods, having by reason of such unlawful seizure and
detainer, as aforesaid, fued forth one or more writ or writs of Replevin,
directed to the Sheriffs of London (being the proper remedy provided by the
Law to regaine the possession of goods taken and withheld from the owners
contrary to Law) the said Sir Thomas Trevor Knight then and yet one of the
Barons of his Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, together with the rest of the
then Barons of the said Court, upon information to them given, that the said
Proprietors, or some of them, had sued forth and did prosecute such writ, or
writs of Replevin for deliverie of the said goods, did order an Injunction
under Seal of the said Court to issue forth, directed to the Sheriffs of
London, commanding them thereby not to execute the said writ or writs of
Replevin, or any like writ thereafter to be sued forth by any person or persons
for the delivery of any goods in the like nature detained: And did declare and
order publicly in the said Court of Exchequer, that the said goods by Law were
not Replevisable, alleging for cause that the said goods were in the Kings
own possession, whereas the same did not judicially appear to them, and they
did well know that the said goods were at that time in the possession of the
Farmours and Lessees of the said Customs, and no lawful cause to them
appearing or suggested of the taking and detaining of the said goods: which
Injunction and declaration so granted and made, were and are against the Laws
of the Realm, and in subversion of the common right, and remedy of the Subject
for regaining the possession of his goods being taken and withheld from him
without lawful cause.

That the Sheriffs of London for that time being served with the said
Injunction, did forbear to execute the said writ or writs of Replevin: By
means whereof the said goods continued so detained as aforesaid, contrary to
Law, from the said month of November until the month of June next following.

That the said Sir Thomas Trevor and other the Barons aforesaid, knowing the
said goods to be unlawfully seized and detained for the pretended duties and
Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, whereas no such were payable by Law, did from
time to time delay the respective Proprietors from having restitution of their
said goods, being often in Court moved therein, with intention thereby to force
the said Proprietors (by wanting their goods and the use thereof) to pay all
such sums as the said Officers of the Customs pretended to be due to his
Majesty.

That to the end aforesaid the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and the said other
Barons refused to accept of any security to be given by the said Proprietors,
upon restitution had of their goods, for payment of all such duties as should
be made appear to be payable to his Majesty in such manner as the said
Barons should direct. That the said Sir Thomas Trevor and other the Barons
aforesaid, knowing that the said sums demanded on his Majesty's behalf by
the said Officers of the Customs not to be due by Law, did refuse to order
restitution of any part of those goods, (so detained as aforesaid) to the
Proprietors thereof, unless the said Proprietors would deposite all such
sums of money as the said Officers respectively demanded of them for
pretended duties to his Majesty; and the said Proprietors refusing to deposite
the said sums demanded, the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and other the Barons
aforesaid, did order the said Officers to detain double the value of the
sums by them demanded for pretended duties to his Majesty, and to restore
the residue: The said Sir Thomas Trevor, and other the said Barons then knowing
that the pretended sums demanded by the said Officers, were not by Law due or
payable to his Majesty.

2 That in or about January 4. Car. the said Officers having seized several
Merchandise of the goods of Richard Chambers Merchant, upon the pretenses
aforesaid, did detain the same; and the said Chambers prosecuting by plaint to
have his said goods replevied, the said Sir Thomas Trevor, together with the
said other Barons, did in like manner in the said Court of Exchequer, declare
the said Chambers goods not to be Replevisable, and enjoined the Sheriffs of
London to proceed no further therein, no cause to them appearing of such
seizure or detainer. And the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and other the Barons of
the said Court, refused to order the delivery of the said Chamber's goods, upon
good security offered by him to pay all such sums as should be made appear
to be due, and for which the said goods were pretended to be detained and the
said Barons being often moved in Court; therein, did refuse to order
restitution of any part of the said Chambers goods, until the three and
twentieth of November, 5. Caroli, and then ordered that the said Officers
should detain in their hands double the value of the sums by them demanded,
and restitution of the residue to be made to the said Chambers, no cause of
detaining any part of the said goods to them in any wise appearing.

3 That whereas in the month of October, in the fourth year of his said
Majesty's reign, the Farmers and Officers of the Custom House having seized
great quantities of Currants, being the goods of Samuel Vassal Merchant, and
having conveyed them into certain Storehouses at the Custom house and
detained them, because the said Samuel Vassal refused to pay an imposition of
five shillings six pence upon every hundred weight of the said Currants,
pretended to be due, and demanded by the said Farmours and Officers on his
Majesty's behalf for the said Currants, whereas no such imposition was due or
paiable for the same, but the said imposition was and is against the Laws of
this Realm. And whereas also in Michaelmas Term, in the said fourth year of
his Majesty's Reign, his Majesty's then Attorney general exhibited an
information by English Bill in the Exchequer Chamber against the said Samuel
Vassal, setting forth that K. James, by his Letters Patents dated 3. Novem. in
the second year of his Reign, did command that the said imposition of 5. s.
6. d. upon every hundred weight of Currants should be demanded and received:
And that his Majesty that now is, by his Letters Patents dated the six and
twentieth day of July, in the second year of his Reign, did, by advise of his
Privy Council, declare his will and pleasure to be, that Subsidies, Customs
and Imposts should be levied in such manner as they were levied in the time of
King James; and the same, and the Farmers thereof to continue until it might
receive a settling by Parliament and commanded the levying and receiving the
same accordingly; and that the said Samuel Vassal before the first day of
October then last past before the said Information exhibited, did bring into
the port of London in ships four thousand six hundred thirty eight hundred
weight of Currants, and that Richard Carmarthon Surveyour in the said port of
London, the said first day of October demanded of the said Samuel Vassal the
said imposition of five shillings six pence for every hundred weight of the
said Currants, and that the said Samuel Vassal refused to pay the said
imposition, and unjustly detained it from the King: To which Information the
said Samuel Vassal appeared, and pleaded the Statute of Magna Charta; and the
Statute of De Tallagio non concedendo, and that he was a Subject borne under
the Kings Allegiance, and a Merchant of London using that trade, and that the
said sum of five shillings six pence upon every hundred weight of Currants,
was and is malum talnetum, and not antiqua seu recta consuetudo, and that it
was imposed without assent of Parliament: to which Plea the said Attorney
General demurred in Law, and the said Samuel Vassal joined in demurrer with
him.

That the said Sir Thomas Trevor, being then and yet one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer, together with the rest of the then Barons of the
said Court, knowing the said Currants to be unlawfully seized and detained for
the pretended duty of five shillings six pence imposition upon every hundred
weight of the said Currants (whereas no such imposition was paiable by Law) did
from time to time delay the said Samuel Vassal from having restitution of his
said goods, being often in Court moved therein, with intention thereby to force
the said Samuel Vassal (by wanting the said goods, and the use thereof) to pay
all such sums as the said Officers of the Customs pretended to be due to his
Majesty, and imprisoned the said Samuel Vassal, because he refused to pay
such sums of money as were demanded of him for the said unlawful imposition,
and that in Trinity Term in the sixth year of his Majesty's reign, the said
case coming to be argued in open Court upon the demurrer, the said Sir Thomas
Trevor, contrary to his oath, and contrary to the Laws of this Realm, and to
the great impoverishment of the said Samuel Vassal, did (together with the
rest of the then Barons of the said Court of Exchequer) give his opinion and
judgment upon the said Information for the King, and against the said Samuel
Vassal, and by several Orders for that purpose, did continue the possession
of the said goods in the King, and the said Samuel Vassal could never obtain
any restitution at all of the said Currants.

4 Whereas it was commanded to the Sheriff of the County of York, by Writ
under the Seal of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, dated the sixteenth day of
May in the seventh year of his Majesty's Reign that now is, That he should
distraine James Maleverer Esquire, to appear before the Barons of his
Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, in the Octaves of the holy Trinity then next
following, to make fine to the King for his trespass and contempt in not
coming to the presence of the King before the 31. day of January in the first
year of his said Majesty's Reign, to take upon him the order of Knighthood,
according to the form of a Proclamation in that behalf formerly made; at
which day of the said Octaves of the holy Trinity the said J. Maleverer did
appear, and pleaded to the said Writ, that although his said Majesty, the said
31. day of January, and for three days next before, the said 31. day of January
was resident and remaining at his Palace at White Hall in the County of
Middlesex, and that the said James Maleverer the said one and thirtieth day of
January, and three days next before the said one and thirtieth day of January,
was resident and remaining at Ancliffe in the said County of York, which is
distant from the said Palace of White Hall the space of one hundred and
fourscore miles; and that the said James Maleverer the said one and thirtieth
day of January aforesaid, or at any time before, had no lands or rents in his
own hands, or in the hands of Feoffees to his uses, out of the said County of
York, and that that part of the said County of York which is nearest to the
said Palace of White Hall, the space of one hundred and thirty miles, and that
no Proclamation by virtue of any Writ of Proclamation, for the appearance of
any persons whatsoever, to take the said order of Knighthood, was made in any
part of the said County of York before the thirtieth day of January in the
said first year of his Majesty's reign, by reason whereof the said James
Maleverer could not personally come to the presence of his said Majesty, to
take the said order of Knighthood, before the said one and thirtieth day of
January in the said first year of his said Majesty's reign, yet the said
James Maleverer for his fine in the premises, did humbly submit himself to
the said Court, and demanded to be discharged of the said issues, returned and
imposed upon him by reason of the premises; yet notwithstanding the said Plea
and submission of the said James Maleverer, and after the same was made as
aforesaid, and entered upon Record in his Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, the
said Sir Thomas Trevor (being then one of the Barons of his Majesty's said
Court of Exchequer) contrary to his oath, and contrary to the Laws of this
Realm, and to the great impoverishing of the said James Maleverer, did
(together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court) refuse to impose
any fine whatsoever upon the said James Maleverer, and told him that the said
Court had no power to fine him; but that he might compound with certain
Commissioners for that purpose appointed. And did farther order and direct
several other writs of Distringas, to issue forth of his Majesty's said Court
of Exchequer, under the Seal of the said Court, directed to the several high
Sheriffs of the said County of York, whereby the said Sheriffs were
commanded further to distraine the said James Maleverer to appear, as
aforesaid: upon which said writs of Distringas, several great and excessive
issues were returned upon the lands of the said James Maleverer, amounting to
the sum of two thousand pounds or there abouts, a great part whereof, the
said James Maleverer was enforced to pay; and in like manner the said Sir
Thomas Trevor (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said Court of
Exchequer) did order and direct such and the like proceedings, and the said
proceedings were had and made accordingly against Thomas Moyser Esquire, and
against several other persons his Majesty's subjects in several parts of this
Kingdom, to the utter undoing of many of them.

5 That he the said Sir Thomas Trevor, about the month of November, Anno
Domini 1635. then being one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer,
and having taken an oath for the due administration of Justice to his Majesty's
liege people, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, subscribed
his name to an opinion, in haec verba: [I am of opinion, etc. ut supra in Baron
Davenports Charge, page 30.

6 That in or about the month of February Anno Dom. 1636. (then being one of
the Barons of the said Court of Exchequer) he subscribed an extrajudicial
opinion in answer to questions in a letter from his Majesty, in haec verba:

Charles R. When the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned,
etc. ut supra, loco citato, and subscribed ut prius.

7 That the said Sir Thomas Trevor (being then one of the Barons of his
Majesty's Court of Exchequer) did deliver his opinion, and judgment in the
Exchequer chamber, against John Hampden Esquire, in the Case of Ship Money;
That he the said John Hampden upon the matter and substance of the Case, was
chargeable with the money then in question: a copy of which proceedings and
judgment the Commons in this present Parliament have already delivered to your
Lordships.

8 That whereas in the month of April 16. Car. the Officers of the
Custom House having seized a Ship of one Samuel Warner's laden with Tobacco,
being the goods of the said Warner, the Bulk of the said Ship not being
broken, and no information exhibited for the King, according to the course of
the Exchequer, for any duty, the Barons were moved that the said Ship might be
restored to the Proprietor, giving security to pay such duties as did belong to
the King; But upon the allegation of the Kings Attorney that there needed no
information, because there was no penalty, the said Sir Thomas Trevor, (being
then one of the Barons of his Majesty's said Court of Exchequer, together with
the rest of the then Barons of the said Court,) did (contrary to his oath, and
contrary to the Laws of this Realm,) deny the restitution of the said Ship,
unless all the duties demanded by the Farmours of the Custom House were first
paid. Hereupon the said Warner brought an action of Trover in the office of
Pleas in the Exchequer against the said Officers that seized his Ship and
goods: whereupon the Kings Attorney general exhibited an information by
English Bill in the Exchequer chamber against the said Warner; setting forth,
that Customs and Subsidies upon Merchandise were a great part of the Kings
revennue, and payable to him; and that the said Ship was seized for non-payment
of the aforesaid duties, notwithstanding the said Warner then Proprietor,
prosecuted the Officers upon a suit at Law, and prays that he may answer the
said Information before any further proceedings be had at Law: Thereupon the
said Sir Thomas Trevor, (together with the rest of the then Barons of the said
Court of Exchequer,) ordered, that the Proprietor moving for delivery of the
said goods, should first answer to the said Information; after which the said
Warner demurred to the said Information in regard no title for any certain
duty was set forth by the Information, which demurrer yet remains not
overruled; but the said Sir Thomas Trevor, with the said other Barons,
(without overruling the demurrer) ordered, (because Warner had put in a
demurrer and not answered to the said Information, that he should not proceed
upon the action of Trover. The Proprietor being thus prevented of his remedy
by action at Law, sued forth a Replevin, and (upon pretense of viewing the said
goods,) caused them to be brought forth of a Cellar, hired by a deputy of the
Farmours to that use; and being brought forth, they were taken by the Sheriff
of London, by virtue of the said Replevin; and upon oath made of the manner of
the taking, as aforesaid, before the Barons, and upon view of the President,
inrolls his case; the said Sir Thomas Trevor, with the said other Barons,
adjudged, that the said goods were not Replevisable, and granted an Injunction
to maintain the possession of them as they were before.

And the said house of Commons by protestation* saving to themselves only the
liberties of exhibiting at any time hereafter any other accusation or
impeachment against the said Sir Thomas Trevor, and also of replying to the
answer that he the said Sir Thomas Trevor shall make unto the said Articles, or
any of them, or of offering proof of the premises, or any of their
impeachments or accusations that shall be exhibited by them, as the Case shall
(according to the course of Parliaments) require, do pray that the said Sir
Thomas Trevor, one of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, may be
put to answer to all and every the premises; and that such proceedings,
examinations, trialls, and judgments may be upon every of them had and used,
as is agreeable to Law and Justice.

FINIS.
