THE CHARACTER OF A Coffee-House, WITH THE SYMPTOMS OF A TOWN-WIT.

LONDON, Printed for Jonathan Edwin, at the three Roses in Lud-Gate-Street,
1673.

THE CHARACTER OF A Coffee-House, etc.
A Coffee-House is a Lay-Conventicle, Good-fellowship turned Puritan,
Ill-husbandry in Masquerade, whither people come, after Toping all day, to
purchase, at the expense of their last penny, the repute of sober Companions; a
Rota-Room that (like Noah's Ark) receives Animals of every sort, from the
precise diminutive Band, to the Hectoring Cravat and Cuffs in Folio; a Nursery
for training up the smaller Fry of Virtuosi in confident Tattling, or a Cabal
of Kittling Critics that have only learned to Spit and Mew; a Mint of
Intelligence, that to make each man his peny-worth, draws out into petty
parcels, what the Merchant receives in Builion: He that comes often saves two
pence a week in Gazets, and has his News and his Coffee for the same charge, as
at a three penny Ordinary they give in Broth to your Chop of Mutton; it is an
Exchange where Haberdashers of Political small wares meet, and mutually abuse
each other, and the Public, with bottomless stories, and headless notions;
the Rendezvous of idle Pamphlets, and persons more idly imployd to read them; a
High Court of Justice, where every little Fellow in a Chamlet-Cloak takes upon
him to transpose Affairs both in Church and State, to show reasons against Acts
of Parliament, and condemn the Decrees of General Councels; It Is impossible to
describe it better than the most ingenious of the Latin Poets has done it to
our hand, and that so excellently, we cannot but transcribe it: "Unde quod est
usquam quamvis Regionibus absit
"Inspicitur, penetratque cavas vox omius ad Aures
"Nocte Dieque patet, Tota est ex AEresonanti
"Tota Fremit, Vocesque refert, Iteratque quod Audit,
"Nulla Quies intus, nullaque silentia part
"Nec tamen est Clamor, sed parvae Murmura Vocis
"Qualia de Pelagi (si quis procul audiat) unda
"Esse solent, qualemve sonum cum Jupiter atras
"Increpuit nubes, Extrema Tonitrua reddunt;
"Atria Turba tenet, veniunt Leve vulgus, Eun^que
"Mistaque cum veris passim Commenta vagantur,
"Millia Rumorum, confusaque verba volutant;
"Equibus Hii vacuas Implent sermonibus Aures
"Hi narrata feruntalio, Mensuraque ficti
"Crescit, and Auditis aliquid novus Adjicit Author
"Illic Credulitas, Illic temerarius Error
"Varaque Letitia est, Consternatique Timores
"Seditioque recens, dubioque Authore Susurri
"Ipsa quid in Caelo Rerum, Pelagoque geratur
"Et Tellure videt, Totumque Inquirit in Orbem.


Thus strictly English't. Here all that is d^ne, though far remote, appears,
And in close whispers penetrates our ears;
As built of Brass, the House throughout resounds,
Reports things hea^d, and every word rebounds.
No rest within, nor sil^^c^, yet the noise
Not loud, but like a hallow murmuring voice;
Such as from far by Rolling Waves is sent,
Or like Joves fainting Thunder almost spent:
Hither the idle vulgar come and go,
Carrying a thousand Rumors to and fro;
With stale reports some listening ears do fill,
Some coin fresh tales, in words that vary still;
Lies mixed with Truth, all in the telling grows,
And each Relator adds to what he knows:
Here dwells rash error, light credulity,
Sad panick fears, joys built on vanity;
New raised sedition, secret whisperings,
Of unknown Authors, and of doubtful things:
All Acts of Heaven and Earth it boldly views,
And through the spacious World enquires for News.


The Room stinks of Tobacco worse than Hell of Brimstone, and is as full of
smoke ^s their Heads that frequent it, whose humors are as various as those of
Bedlam, and their discourse ost-times as Heathenish and dull as their Liquor;
that Liquor, which by its looks and taste, you may reasonably guess to be
Pluto's Diet-drink; that Witches tipple out of dead men's Skulls, when they
ratify to Beelzebub their Sacramental Vows.

This St^gian-Puddle-seller, was formerly notorious for his ill-favored Cap,
that Ap'd a Turbant, and in Conjunction with his Antichristian face, made him
appear perfect Turk: But of late his Wife being grown acquainted with Callants,
and the provocative virtue of Chocolet, he finds a Broad-brim'd Hat more
necessary: When he comes to fill you a Dish, you may take him for Guy Faux with
a dark Lanthorn in's hand, for no sooner can you taste it, but it scalds your
throat, as if you had swallowed the Gunpowder-Treason: though he seem never so
demure, you cannot properly call him Pharisee, for he never washes either out
or inside of his pots or dishes, till they be as black as an Usurers
Conscience; and then only scraping off the contracted Soot, makes use of it, in
the way of his Trade, instead of Coffee-powder; their taste and virtue being so
near of Kin, he dares defy the veriest Coffee-Critick to distinguish them:
Though he be no great Traveller, yet he is in continual motion, but it is only
from the fire side to the Table, and his tongue goes infinitely faster than his
feet, his grand study being readily to echo an answer to that thredbare
question, What News have you Master? Then with a grave whisper (yet such as all
the Room may hear it) he discovers some mysterious Intrigue of State told him
last night by one that is Barber to the Tailor of a mighty great Courtiers man,
relating this with no less formality than a young Preacher delivers his first
Sermon, a sudden Hickup surprises him, and he is forced twenty times to break
the thread of his Tale with such necessary Parenthesis's, Wife, sweep up those
loose Corns of Tobacco, and see the Liquor boil not over: He holds it as part
of his Creed, that the Great Turk is a very good Christian, and of the Reformed
Church, because he drinks Coffee, and swears that Pointings for celebrating its
virtues in doggerel deserves to be Poet Laureat: yet is it not only this hot
Hell-broth that he sells, for never was Mountebank surnisht with more variety
of poisonous drugs, then he of liquors, Tea and Aromatique for the sweettooth'd
Gentleman, Betony and Rosade for the addle-headed Customer, Back recruiting
Chocolet for the Consumptive Gallant, Herefordshire Redstreak made of rotten
apples at the three Cranes, true Brunswick-Mum brewed at S. Katherines, and Ale
in penny Mugs, not so big as a Tailors Thimble.

As you have a hodge-podge of Drinks, such too is your Company, for each man
seems a Leveller, and ranks and files himself as he lists, without regard to
degrees or order; so that often you may see a silly Fop, and a worshipful
Justice, a griping Rock, and a grave Citizen, a worthy Lawyer, and an errant
Pickpocket, a Reverend Nonconsormist, and a Canting Mountebank; all blended
together, to compose an Oglio of Impertinence.

If any Pragmatick, to show himself witty or eloquent, begin to talk high,
presently the further Tables are abandoned, and all the rest flock round (like
smaller birds to admire the gravity of Madge-Howlet) They listen to him a while
with their mouths, and let their Pipes go out, and Coffee grow cold, for pure
zeal of attention, but of the sudden fall all a yelping at once with more noise,
but not half so much harmony as a Pack of Beagles on the full Cry, to still
this bawling, Upstarts

Captain All-man-sir, the man of mouth, with a face as blustering as that of
Eolus and his four Sons in Painting, and a voice louder than the speaking
Trumpet, he begins you the story of a Sea Fight; and though he never were
further by water than the Bear-garden, or Cuckolds-Haven, yet having pyrated
the names of Ships and Captains, he persuades you himself was present, and
performed Miracles; that he waded Knee-deep in blood on the upper Deck, and
never thought serenade to his Mistress, so pleasant as the Bullets whistling;
how he stopped a Vice Admiral of the Enemies under full sail, till she was
boarded, with his single arm instead of Grapling Irons, Vide Justin. ^. 2. de
Cynagiro.
and puffed out with his breath a Fire-ship that fell foul on them. All this he
relates sitting in a Cloud of Smoke, and belching so many common Oaths to vouch
it, you can scarce guess whether the real Engagement, or his Romancing account
of it, be the more dreadful: However, he concludes with railing at the Conduct
of some Eminent Officers, (that perhaps he never saw) and protests, had they
taken his advice at the Council of War, not a Sail had escaped us.

He is no sooner out of breath, but another begins a Lecture on the Gazet,
where finding several Prizes taken, he gravely observes, if this Trade hold, we
shall quickly rout the Dutch Horse and Foot by Sea: He nicknames the Polish
Gentlemen where ever he meets them, and enquires, whether Gayland and
Taffaletta be Lutherans or Calvinists: Stilo Novo he interprets a vast new
Style or Turn-pike erected by his Electoral Highness on the borders of
Westphalia to keep Mounsieur Turenes Cavalray from falling on his retreating
Troops; He takes words by the sound without examining their sense: Morea he
believes to be the Country of the Moors, and Hungary a place where famine
always keeps her Court, nor is there any thing more certain, than that he made
a whole Roomful of Fops, as wise as himself, spend above two hours in searching
the Map for Aristocracy and Democracy, not doubting but to have found them
there, as well as Dalmatia and Croatia.

Next Seigniour Poll takes up the Cudgels, that speaks nothing but Designs,
Projects, Intrigues, and Experiments, One of those in the old Comedian,
Plautus, Sciunt id quod in Aurem Rex Reginae dixerit, Quod Juno confabulata est
cum Jove, Sciunt quae neque futura neque facta sunt, tamen illi sciunt, etc.
All the Councels of the German Diet, the Romish Conclave, and Turkish Divan,
are as well known to him as his Landresses Smock. He kens all the Cabals of the
Court to a hairs breadth, and (more then an hundred of us do,) which Lady is
not painted; you would take his mouth for a Limbeck, it distills his words so
niggardly, as if he was loath to enrich you with lies, of which he has yet more
plenty than Fox, Stowe, and Hollingshead bound up together; He tells you of a
Plot to let the Lions loose in the Tower, and then blow it up with
white-powder; of five hundred and fifty Jesuits all mounted on Dromedaries seen
by Moonshine on Hampsteadheath, and a terrible design hatched by the College
of Doway, to drain the narrow Seas and bring Popery over dry shod; besides he
has a thousand inventions dancing in his brain-pain; an Advice-boat on the
Stocks, that shall go to the East Indies, and come back again in a Fortnight, a
trick to march underwater, and bore holes through the Dutch-ships Keele with
Augurs, and sincke them, as they ride at Anhor, and a most excellent pursuit to
catch Sunbeams, for making the Ladies new fashioned Towrs, that Poets may no
more be damned for telling lies about their Curls and Tresses.

But these are puny Pugs, the Arch-Devil, wherewith this Smoke-hole is haunted,
is the Town-wit, one that plays Rex where ever he comes, and makes as much
hurry as Robin Goodfellow of old amongst our Granams Milk-bouls; He is a kind
of a Squib on a Rope; a meteor composed of Self-conceit and noise, that by
blazeing and crackling engages the wonder of the ignorant, till on a sudden he
vanishes and leaves a stench, if not infection behind him; he is too often the
stain of a good Family, and by his debaucht life blots the noble Coat of his
Ancestors, A wild unback'd Colt, whose brains are not half codled, indebted
for his clothes to his Tailor, and for his wit (such as it is) to his Company:
The School had no sooner 'dued him with a few superficial besprinklings, but
his Mothers indulgence posted him to Town for Genteeler breeding, where three
or four wild Companions, half a dozen bottles of Burgundy, two leaves of
Leviathan, a brisk encounter with his Landlords Glasswindowes, the charms of a
little Miss, and the sight of a new Play dubbed him at once both a Wit and a
Hero, ever since he values himself mainly for understanding the Town, and
indeed knows most things in it, that are not worth knowing: The two Poles
whereon all his discourses turn are Atheism and Bawdry; Bar him from being
profane or obscene, and you cramp his Ingenuity, which forthwith Flags and
becomes useless, as a meet Common Lawyer when he has crossed the Channel.

He is so refractory to Divinity that Morality it self cannot hold him, he
affirms humane Nature knows no such things as principles of Good and evil, and
will swear all women are whores, though his Mother and Sister both stand by:
Whatever is sacred or serious he seeks to render Ridiculous, and thinks
Government and Religion fit objects for his idle and fantastic Buffoonry, his
humor is proud and assuming, as if he would palliate his ignorance by Scoffing
at what he understands not, and therefore with a pert and pragmatique scorn
depreciates all things of nobler moment, but most passionately affects pretty a
lamode words, And is as covetous of a New Song or Air, as an Antiquary of
Cato's Statue with never an arm, and but half a nose, These keep him always
imployd, and fill up the Grotesco's of his conversation, whilst with a stately
Gallantry once in every half hour he Combs out his Wig, Carreens his breeches,
and new marshalls his Garniture, to the Tune of Methinks the poor Town has been
troubled too long.

His mind used to whistle up and down in the levities of Fancy, and effeminated
by the childish Toyings of a rampant imagination finds it self indispoled for
all solid employment, especially the serious exercises of Piety and Virtue,
which begets an aversion to those Lovely Beauties, and that prompts him on all
occasions to expose them as ridiculous and vain: Hence by degrees he comes to
abuse Sacred Scripture, makes a mock of eternal Flames, Joque on the venerable
Mysteries of Religion, and in fine, scoff at that All Glorious and Tremendous
Mayesty before whom his brother Wits below tremble; It Is true he will not
confess himself Atheist, yet in his heart the Fool has said it, and boasts
aloud that he holds his G^spel from the Apostle of Malmsbury, though it is more
than probable he never read, at least understood ten leaves of that unlucky
Author; Talk of Witches and you Tickle him, speak of Spirits and he tells you he
knows none better than those of Wine, name but Immaterial Essence, and he
shall flout at you as a dull Fop incapable of sense, and unfit for
Conversation; Nor is he ever better pleased than when he can here hedge in some
young raw Divine to Bulbait with scurrility and all kind of profanchess.

By means of some small scraps of learning matched with a far greater stock of
Confidence, a voluble Tongue, and bold delivery, he has the ill-luck to be
celebrated by the vulgar; for a man of Parts, which opinion gains credit to his
Insolences, and sets him on further extravigances to maintain his Title of a
Wit by continuing his practice of Fooling, whereas all his mighty parts are
sum'd up in this Inventory. Imprimis, A pedling way of Fancy, a Lucky hit at
Quibbling, now and then an odd metaphor, a conceited Irony, a ridiculous
Simile, a wild fetch, an unexpected Inference, a Minick Gesture, a pleasing
knack in humouring a Tale, and lastly an irresistible Resolution to speak last,
and never be dashed out of Countenance:

By these Arts dexterously managed he engrosses a vaste Repute, The grave
Citizen calls him shrewd man, and notable He adpiece, The Ladies (we mean the
things so called of his acquaintance) vote him a most accomplished Gentleman,
and the Blades swear he is a Walking Comedy, the only Merry Andrew of the Age,
that scatters Wit wherever he comes, as Beggars do Lice, or Muskcats perfumes,
and that nothing in Nature and all that can compare with him.

You would think he had got the Lullian Art, for he speaks Extempore on all
subjects, and ventures his words without, the Relief of Sense to second them,
his thoughts start from his imagination, and he never troubles himself to
Examine their decency, or solidity by Judgment. To discourse him seriously is
to read the Ethics to a Monkey, or make an Oration to Cal^gula's Horse, whence
you can only expect a weehee or Jadish spurn; after the most convi^cing
Arguments, if he can but muster up one plausible ^^que you are routed, For he
that understood not your L^gick, apprehends his dro^^, and though Syllogysmes
may be answered, yet Jests and loud laughter can never be confuted, but have
more sway to degrade things with the ^^thi^ki^g crou^, than demonstrations;
There being a Root of envy in too many Men, that invites them to applaud that
which Exposes and villifies what they cannot comprehend; He pretends great
skill in curing the Tetters and Ring-worms of State, but blows in the sores
till they Rankle with his poisonous breath, he shoots libels with his forked
tongue at his Superiors and abusest his dearest Friends, choosing to forfeit his
neck to the Gibbet, or his shoulders to the Batoon rather than lose the driest
of his idle Quibbles; In brief he is the Jack-pudding of Society, a fleering
Buffoon, a better kind of Ape in the judgment of all Wisemen, but an
incomparable Wit in his own.

Thus have we led you from Board to Board, like the fellow in the Tower, to
show you st^ange Beasts wherewith this place is sometimes frequented. To take
now a farewell view of the House will be difficult, since it is always shifting
Scenes and like O Brazile (the Enchanted Island) seldom appears twice in a
posture; The wax c^^dles burning, and low devout whispers sometimes strike a
kind of Religious Awe, whilst the modish Gallant swears so often by Jesus, an
Ignorant Catholic would take it for a Chapel, and think he were saying our
Ladies Psalter; In some places the Organs speak it a Music Room, at others a
pair of Tables and draught b^ard, a small gaming house; on a sudden it turns
Exchange, or a Warehouse for all sorts of Commodities, where fools are drawn in
by inch of Candle, as we betray and carch Larks with a Glass; The Bully- Rock
makes it his Bubbling pond, where he angles for Fops, singles out his man,
insinuates an acquaintaince, offers the wine, and at next Tavern sets upon him
with, high Fullums, and plucks him: The Ingeniosi use it for an after
Rehearsal, where they bring Plays to Repetition, sift each Scene examine every
uncorrected Line, and damn beyond the fury of the Rota, whilst the incognito
Poet out of an overweening affection to his Infant Wit, steals in muffled up in
his Cloak, and sliely Evesdrops like a mendicant Mother to praise the
Prettyness of the Babe she has newly pawm'd on the Parish.

But it is time to be gone, who knows what Magic may be a working, For, behold!
the Coffee-Powder settles at the bottom of our dish in form of a most terrible
Saracens Head. For a parting blow then give us leave to unbend a little, and
say,

A Coffee-House is a Phanatique Theater, a Hot-House to flux in for a clapped
understanding, a Sympathetical Cure for the Gonorrhea of the Tongue, or a
refined Baudy-H^use, where Illegitimate Reports are got in close Adultery
between Lying lips and Itching Ears.
