The Character Of an Old English Protestant; Formerly Called A PURITAN, NOW A
NONCONFORMIST.
THe Old English Protestant was such an one, that honored God Mat. 22.37, 38,
39. 1 Pet. 2.17.
above all, and under God gave Romans 13.7.
every one his due. His Mat. 6.33.
first care was to serve God, and therein he did not what was good in his Deuteronomy.

highly esteemed Col. 2.5.
order in the House of God; but would not under color of that, submit to
superstitious rites, which are superfluous, and Verse. 21, 22.
perish in their use. He reverenced Romans 13.1.
Authority, keeping within its sphere; but durst not under pretense of
subjection to the higher powers Mat. 15.9. Col. 2.8.
, worship God after the traditions of men. He made conscience of Acts 2.42.
all Gods Ordinances, though 1 Cor. 1.17.
some he esteemed of more consequence. He was much in Col. 4.2.
prayer; with it he Psalm. 92.2.
began, and closed the day. In it he was exercised in his Psalm. 55.17. Mat. 6.

and public Assembly. He esteemed that manner of prayer best, where by the 1 Samuel 1.15. Romans 8.26.
gift of God, expressions were varied according to present wants and occasions;
yet did he not account Number. 10.35, 36.
set forms unlawful. Therefore in that circumstance of the Church he did not
wholly 1 Cor. 9.20, 21, 22, 23.
reject the Liturgy, but the corruption of it. He esteemed Acts 13.15. Psalm.
1.2.
reading of the Word an Ordinance of God both in private and public; but did
not account reading to be preaching. The Word 2. Tim. 3.15.
read he esteemed of more authority, but the 1 Cor. 1.21. Romans 1.16.
word preached of more efficacy. Mat. 28.20.
He accounted preaching as necessary now as in the Primitive Church: Gods 1
Cor. 1.21.
pleasure being still by the foolishness of Preaching to save those that
believe. He esteemed that Preaching best 1 Cor. 14.24.23. 1 Cor. 2. 1, 3, 4, 5.
2 Cor. 4. 5.
wherein was most of God, least of man, when vain flourishes of wit and words
w(...)e declined, and the demonstration of Gods Spirit and Power studied: yet
could be distinguish between 2 Cor. 2.17. 1 Timothy 4. 13. 2 Timothy 2. 15. Eccl. 12.
9, 10.
studied plainness, and negligent rudeness. He accounted 1 Cor. 14.1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7.
perspicuity the best grace of a Preacher; And that 1 Cor. 14.25.
method best, which was most helpful to understanding, affection, and memory.
To which ordinarily he esteemed none so conducible, as that by Doctrine, Reason
and Use. He esteemed those 1 Timothy 5.1.
Sermons best that came closet to the Conscience; yet would he have men's
Consciences awakened, not their persons disgraced. He was a man of good
spiritual 1 Pet. 2.2.
appetite, and could not be contented with James 1.19.2 Tim. 4.1, 2.
one meal a day. An Afternoon-Sermon did relish as well to him as one in the
morning. He was not satisfied with Prove. 28.9.
Prayers without Preaching: which if it were wanting at Amos 8.11, 12. Mat. 3.5.
home, he would seek abroad; yet would he not by 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. 1 Cor. 4.6.
absence discourage his Minister, if faithful, though another might have
quicker gifts. A 2 Timothy 4.1, 2.
Lecture he esteemed, though not necessary, yet a blessing, and would redeem

rest on it necessary so far as it conduced to holiness. He was Exodus 20.8.
very conscientious in observing of that day as the Mart day of the Soul. He
was very careful to 2 Chronicles. 22.20. Psalm 91.
remember it, to get house and heart in order for it: and when it came, he was
studious to improve it. He Ifa. 58.13, 14.
redeemed the morning from superfluous sleep, Exodus 20.8. Acts 20.7.
and watched the whole day over his thoughts and words, not only to restrain
them from wickedness, but worldliness. Deuteronomy. 6.7.
All parts of the day were alike holy to him, and his care was continued in it
in variety of holy duties: what he heard in public, he repeated in private, to
Ifa. 58.13, 14.
whet it upon himself and family. Lawful Exodus 2.6. Mar. 12.17.11.12, 13.
recreations he thought this day unseasonable, and Cor. 17.14.
unlawful ones much more abominable: yet he knew Acts 16.15.
the liberty God gave him for needful refreshing, which he did neither refuse
nor abuse. The Sacrament of 1 Cor. 10.6.
Baptism he received in infancy, which he looked back to in age to answer his
engagements, and claim his privileges; The Lords John 7.37. and 6.48.
Supper he accounted part of his Souls food: to which he labored to keep an
appetite. 1 Cor. 10.16
He esteemed it an Ordinance of nearest Communion with Christ, and so requiring
most 1 Cor. 11.28.
exact preparation. His first care was in the 1 Cor. 5.2, 13.
examination of himself: yet as an act of Rev. 2.2.
office or charity, he had an eye on others.

He endeavored to have the scandalous Rev. 2.25.
cast out of Communion: but he Mat. 16.6.
cast not out himself, because the scandalous were suffered by the negligence
of others. He condemned Acts 13.12. 1 Cor. 7.5.
that superstition and vanity of Popish mock-fasts, yet neglected not one
occasion to humble his soul by right fasting: Mat. 15.8.
He abhorred the Popish Doctrine of opus oper atum, in the notion. And in
practice rested in John 4.23, 24.
no performance; but what was done in spirit and truth. He thought God had left
a Rule in his Word for Heb. 3.2, 5, 6.
Discipline, which he judged pertaining not to the being, but well-being of a
Church. He esteemed those Churches most pure, where the Government is by
Elders, yet unchurched not those where it was otherways. Perfection 1 Cor.
11.17, 18, 19. Rev. 2.14, 20.
in Churches he thought a thing rather to be desired than obtained. And so he
expected not a Church state without all defects. The 1 Cor. 5.2. Rev. 2.5.
Ezekiel. 5.4.
corruptions that were in Churohes he thought his duty to bewail, with
endeavors of amendment: yet would he not Heb. 10.25. John 4.11.

put not 1 Timothy 2.8.

His chiefest music was James 5.13.
singing of Psalms: wherein though he neglected not the melody of the voice,
yet he chiefly looked after that of the Col. 3.16.
heart. He disliked such 1 Cor. 14.26
Churchmusick as moved sensual delight, and was an hindrance to spiritual
inlargements. He accounted Romans 13.1. James 1.27.
subjection to the higher Powers to be part of pure Religion, as well as to
visit the fatherless and widows: yet did he distinguish between authority and
lusts of Magistrates; to that he submitted, 1 Cor. 7.23.
but in these he durst not be a servant of men, being bought with a price. Romans
13.5.
Just Laws and Commands he willingly obeyed, not only for fear, but for
Conscience also; but such as were unjust he refused to observe, choosing Acts

rather to obey God than man: yet his refusal was Jer. 26.14, 15.

Religion an engagement to duty, that the best Christians should be best
husband, best wives, best parents, best children, best masters, best servants,
best Magistrates, best Subjects, that the 1 Timothy 6.1. Titus 2.9, 10. 1 Pet.

laboring that those that were born in it, might be born again to God. He 1

but restraining vileness in his. Tit. 2.21, 12.
He was conscientious Prove. 11.1.
of equity as well as piety: knowing that 2 Cor. 1.17.
unrighteousness is abomination as well as ungodliness. He was cautelous in
promising, Psalm 15. 4.

He was a man of a tender heart, not only in regard of his Ezekiel. 36.26.

He was (...) immovable in all times, so that they who in the midst of many
opinions have lost the view of true Religion, may return to him, and there find
it.
