1643 a Solemn LEAGVE AND COVENANT, for Reformation, and defense of Religion,
the Honor and happiness of the king, and the Peace and safety of the three
kingdoms of ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND.
(...) 50.5. Come let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant
that shall not be forgotten.



We Noblemen, Barons knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses, Ministers of the
Gospel, and Commons of all sorts in the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and
Ireland, by the Providence of God living under one king, and being of one
reformed Religion, having before our eyes the Glory of God, and the advancement
of the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Honor and happiness
of the kings Majesty and his posterity, and the true public Liberty, Safety,
and Peace of the kingdoms, wherein every ones private Condition is included,
and calling to mind the treacherous and bloody Plots, Conspiracies, Attempts,
and Practices of the Enemies of God, against the true Religion, and professors
the roof in all places, especially in these three kingdoms ever since the
Reformation of Religion, and how much their rage, power and presumption, are of
late, and at this time increased and exercised, whereof the deplorable state of
the Church and kingdom of Ireland, the distressed estate of the Church and
kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the Church and kingdom of
Scotland, are present and public Testimonies; We have now at last, (after
other means of Supplication, Remonstrance, Protestations, and Sufferings) for
the preservation of our selves and our Religion, from utter Ruin and
Destruction; according to the commendable practice of those Kingdoms in former
times, and the Example of Gods people in other Nations; After mature
deliberation, resolved and determined to enter into a mutual and solemn. Legue
and Covenant; Wherein we all subscribe, and each one of us for himself, with
our hands lifted up to the most high God, do swear;

I: That we shall sincerely, really and constantly, through the Grace of God,
endeavor in our several places and callings, the preservation of the Reformed
Religion in the Church of Scotland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, against our common Enemies, the reformation of Religion in the
kingdoms of England and Ireland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, according to the Word of God, and the Example of the best Reformed
Churches, And shall endeavor to bring the Churches of God in the three
kingdoms, to the nearest conjunction and Uniformity in Religion, Confession of
Faith, Form of Church-gouernment, Directory for Worship and Catechizing; That
we and our posterity after us, may as Brethren, live in Faith and Love, and the
Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us.

Thou have avouched ye Lord this day to be thy God and to walk in his ways,
and to keep his Statutes and his Commandments, and his Judgments and to
hearken to his woyce, And the Lord has avouched thee this day, to be his
peculiar people and to make thee high above all nations, in praise in name and
in honor, Deutero: 26: 17: 18:

II. That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons, endeavor the
extirpation of Popery, Prelacie, (that is Church Government by Archbishops,
Bishops, their Chancellors and Comissaries, Deans, Deans and Chapters,
Archdeacons, and all other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on that
Hierarchy) Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, and whatsoever shall
be found to be contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power of Godliness; lest we
partake in other men's sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their
plagues, and that the Lord may be one, and his Name in the three kingdoms.

Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted out,
Math. 13

III. We shall with the same sincerity, reallity and constancy, in our several
Vocations, endeavor with our estates and lives, mutually to preserve the
Rights and Privileges of the Parliaments; and the Liberties of the kingdoms,
and to preserve and defend the kings Majesty's person and authority, in the
preservation and defense of the true Religion, and Liberties of the kingdoms,
that the World may bear witness with our consciences of our Loyalty, and
that we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish his Maiesti.es just power
and greatness.

The Lord will Create upon every dwelling place of Mount Sion, and upon her
Assemblies, a Cloud and smoke by day, and a shining of a flaming Fire by night,
for upon all the glory shall be a defens. Isaiah 4: 5: Are to be sold by Thomas
Penner at ye Royal Exhange.



IV: We shall also with all faithfulness endeavor the discovery of all such
as have been, or shall be Ince^diaries, Malignants, or evil Instruments, by
hindering the Reformation of Religion, dividing the king from his people, or
one of the kingdoms from another, or making any Faction or parties amongst the
people, contrary to this league and Covenant, that they may be brought to
public trial, and receive condign pumishme^t, as the degree of their
offenses shall require or deserve, or the suprea^ Iudicatories of both kingdoms
respectively, or others having power from them for that effect, shall judge
co^venient.

I will purge out from among you the Rebels, and them that transgress against
me. I will bring them forth out of the Country where they soiourne, Ezekiel.
20: 37. and 38

V And whereas the happiness of a blessed Peace between these kingdoms, denied
in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good Providence of God granted
unto us, and has been lately concluded and selled by both Parliaments, we
shall each one of us, according to our place and interest, endeavor that they
may remain conjoined in a firm Peace an Union to all posterity; And that
Justice may be done upon the wilful Opposers thereof, in manner expressed in
the precedent Article.

VI. We shall also according to our places and callings in this common cause of
Religion, Liberty, and Peace of the kingdoms, assist and defend all those that
enter in to this League and Covenant, in the maintaini^g and pursuing thereof,
and shall not suffer our selves directly or indirectly by whatsoever
combination, persuasion or terror, to be dewided and withdrawn from this
blessed Unio^ and coniungtion whether to make defection to the contrary part,
or to give our selves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this cause
which so much concerns the glory of God, the good of the kingdoms, and honor
of the king; but shall all the days of our lives, zealously and constantly
continue therein, against all opposition, and promote the same according to our
power, against all Lets and impediments whatsoever; an what we are not able
ourselves to suppress or overcome, we shall reveal and make known, that if
may be timely prevented or removed: All which we shall do as in the sight of
God.

And his heart shall be against the holy Covenant. Dan: 11 28 (...) ye Covenant

And because these kingdoms are guilty of many sins and provocations against
God, and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present distresses and
dangers, the fruits thereof; We profess and declare before God and the world,
our unfayned desire to be humbled for our, and for the sins of these kingdoms,
especially, that we have not as we ought, valued the inestimable benefit of the
Gospel, that we have not labored for the purity and power thereof, and that we
have not endeavored to receive Christ in our hearts, not to walk worthy of him
in our lives, which are the causes of other sins and transgressions, so much
abounding amongst us; And our true and unfayned purpose, desire, and endeavor
for our selves, and all others under our power and charge, both in public and
in private, in all duties we owe to God and man; to amend our lives, and each
one to go before another in the Example of a real Reformation, that the Lord
may turn away his wrath, and heavy indignation, and establish these Churches
and kingdoms in truth and peace, And this Covenant we make in the presence of
almighty God, the Searcher of all hearts, with a true intention to perform the
same, as we shall answer at that great day when the secrets of all hearts shall
be disclosed. Most humbly beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his Holy
Spirit for this end, and to bless our desires and procedings with such
success, as may be deliverance and safety to his people, and encouradgement to
other Christian Churches groaning under, or in danger of the yoke of
Antichristian Tyranny, to yoyne in the same, or like Associatio^ and Covenant
to the glory of God, the enlargement of the kingdom: of Jesus Christ, and the
peace and tranquillity of Christian kingdoms and Com^onwealths.

mountain of the Lord, in the house of the God of Jacob, he will teach us of
his ways, (...) will walk in his paths, Micah: 4: 2:
