HIS MAJESTY'S LETTER FOR The Speaker of the Lords protempore, to be
Communicated unto the Lords and Commons in the Parliament of ENGLAND at
Westminster, and the Commissioners of the Parliament of Scotland, and to all my
other Subjects, of what Degree, Condition, or calling whatsoever.
Hampton Court 11 November 1647.
LIberty being that which in all times has been, but especially now is the
Condition, the aim, and desire of all men, condition, reason shows that Kings
less then any should endure Captivity, yet I call God to witness with what
patience J have endured a tedious restraint, which so long as J had any hopes
that this sort of my suffering might conduce to the peace of my Kingdoms, or
the hindering of more effusion of blood I did willingly undergo; But now finding
by two certain proofs, that this my continued patience would not only turn
to my personal Ruin, but likewise be of much more prejudice, then furtherance
to the public good, I thought I was bound as well by natural as polliticall
Obligations, to seek my safety by retyring my self for some time from the
public view, both of my friends and enemies. And I appeal to all indifferent
men, to judge if I have not just cause to free my self from the hands of those
who change their principles with their condition, and who are not a shamed
openly to intend the destruction of the Nobility, by taking away their negative
voice, and with whom the Levelers Doctrine, is rather countenanced then
punished, and as for their intentions to my Person, their changing and putting
more strict Guards upon me, with the discharging most of all those servants of
mine, who formerly they willingly admitted to wait upon me, do sufficiently
declare. Nor would I have this my retirement mis-interpreted for, I shall
earnestly and uncessantly endeavor the settling of a safe and well-grounded
peace wherever I am, or shall be, and that (as much as may be) without the
effusion of more Christian Blood, for which how many tims have I Desired,
press't to the Head, and yet no Ear given to me: and can any reasonable man
think that (according to the ordinary course of affairs there can be a Settled
Peace without it, or that God will bless those, who refuse to hear their own
King, surely no, Nay J must further add that (besides what concerns my self)
unless all other cheise interests have not only a hearing but likewise just
satisfaction given unto them, (to wit the PRESBITERIANS, INDEPENDANTS, ARMY,
those who have adheared to me, and even the SCOTS) I say there cannot (I
speak not of miracles, it being in my opinion a sinful presumption in such
cases to expect or trust to them) be a safe and lasting peace: Now as J cannot
deny but that my personal security is the urgent cause of this my retirement.
So J take God to witness that the publik peace is no less before my Eyes, and J
can find no better way to express this my profession (J know not what a wiser
man may do) then by desiring and urging that all chief Jnterests may be
heard, to the end each may have just satisfaction, as for example, the army
(for the rest though necessary yet J suppose are not difficult to consent)
ought (in my Judgment) to enjoy the liberty of their consciences, and have an
act of Oblivion, or Indemnity (which should extend to the rest of all my
Subjects) and that all their arreares should be speedily and duly paid which J
will undertake to do so J may be heard, and tha^ J be not hindered from using
such lawful and honest means as J shall choose, to conclude let me be heard
with Freedom, Honor and safety, and J shall instantly break through this
Cloud of retirement, and show my self ready to be pater patre:
