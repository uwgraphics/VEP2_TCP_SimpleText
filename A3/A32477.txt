A PROCLAMATION For Proroguing the Parliament until the Nineteenth day of
October next.
CHARLES R.

WHereas the Two Houses of Parliament have by Our direction Adjourned
themselves until the First day of March next, We for many weighty Reasons have
thought fit and resolved to make a Prorogation of the Parliament until the
Nineteenth day of October next. And therefore do by this Our Royal Proclamation
publish, notify, and declare, That We do intend that the Parliament shall be
Prorogued upon and from the said First day of March, until the said Nineteenth
day of October next: Whereof the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Knights,
Citizens and Burgesses, and all others whom it may concern, may hereby take
notice, and order their affairs accordingly; We letting them know, That We will
not at the said First day of March, expect the attendance of any, but only
such as being in or about the Cities of London or Westminster, may attend the
making of the said Prorogation, as heretofore has in like cases been
accustomed.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Eighteenth day of December, in the
Twentieth year of Our Reign. 1668.
Printed by the Assigns of John Bill and Christopher Barker, Printers to the
Kings most Excellent Majesty. 1668.
