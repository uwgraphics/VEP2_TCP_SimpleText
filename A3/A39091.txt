AN ELEGY ON THE Death of that Learned and Famous PHYSICIAN Dr. RICHARD LOWER.
Unhappy Age! That must at last resign
A Soul so great, and so Adorned as thine:
Adorned with all that former Times could show;
All that the Ancients taught, or Moderns knew.
When the learned WILLIS died, he did impart
His utmost Skill to thy capacious Heart.
Full well he knew, there was no other Shrine
So fit to keep his Treasure in, as thine.
So the Old Seer did to his Son dispense,
A double Portion of Prophetic Sense,
When in his fiery Chair he mounted hence.
WILLIS Expiring, joy'd in Thee, to find
He Would such a Legacy for Human kind.
A Legacy more valuable far,
Than both the Indies and their Riches are.
They cannot to our Days one Minute give;
But Thousands by thy powerful Art still live.
And live thou will in them, till Time shall be
Quite swallowed up in vast Eternity.
How many Millions did thy Art restore?
Just to the Rich, and Tender to the Poor:
In Consults serious, in Debating sound;
Free in Advice, in Judgment most profound.
Thy Friendship Courted equal with thy Art,
Unenvied Greatness, and diffusive Heart;
None ever did with more Success embrace
The Peoples Wishes, and the Prince's Grace.
Oh had kind Heaven, ever thou from hence were hurled,
Been pleased to lend Thee longer to the World?
What lasting Monuments had thou designed,
Both to relieve and to support Mankind,
When our wise King thy Worth and Parts had tried,
And found Thee fit for Armies to provide?
Then gave Thee leave his Bounties to dispense,
Best for thy Countries Honor, and thy Prince.
And Reader, now would thou his Equal know,
Go follow him, for there is none left below;
Go, follow to that Blessed Place Above,
Where all your Admiration will be LOVE.
