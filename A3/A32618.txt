A PROCLAMATION Prohibiting the keeping of the Fair of Wanting or Wantage, in
the County of Berks.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, out of His Princely and Christian care of
His loving Subjects, that no good means of Providence may be neglected to stay
the further spreading of the great Infection of the Plague, Does find it
necessary to prevent all occasions of public concourse of His people for the
present, till it shall please Almighty God of His goodness to cease the
violence of the Contagion, which is very far dispersed into many parts of this
Kingdom already: And therefore remembering that there is at hand a Fair of note,
unto which there is usually extraordinary resort out of several parts of the
Kingdom, kept at Wanting or Wantage, in the County of Berks; The holding
whereof at the usual time, would (in all likelihood) be the occasion of further
danger and Infection to other parts of the Land, which yet by Gods mercy stand
clear and free: Has (with the Advice of His Privy Council) thought good by
this open Declaration of His Pleasure and necessary Commandment, not only to
admonish and require all His loving Subjects to forbear to resort (for this
time) to the said Fair kept at Wanting or Wantage aforesaid, or to any other
Fair or Fairs in the said County of Berks, but also to enjoin the Lord or Lords
of the said Fair, or others Interested therein, that they all forbear to hold
the said Fair, or any thing appertaining thereunto, at the time accustomed, or
at any other time, till by Gods goodness and mercy the Infection of the Plague
shall cease, or be so much diminished, that His Majesty shall give order for
holding them; upon pain of such punishment, as for a Contempt so much
concerning the general safety of His people, they shall be adjudged to deserve;
which they must expect to be inflicted with all severity. And to that purpose
does hereby further Charge and Enjoin (under the like penalty) all Citizens and
Inhabitants of the Cities of London and Westminster, That none of them shall
repair unto any Fairs held within any part of this Kingdom, until it shall
please God to cease the Infection now reigning amongst them: His Majesty's
intention being, and so hereby Declaring Himself, That no Lord of any Fair, or
others Interested in the Profits thereof, shall by this necessary and temporary
Restraint, receive any prejudice in the right of his or their Fairs, or
Liberties thereunto belonging; Any thing before mentioned notwithstanding.

Given at Our Court at Salisbury this One and twentieth day of September, 1665.
in the Seventeenth year of Our Reign.
