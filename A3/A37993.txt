Chappelry, since the first day of March, in the year of our Lord God 1641. for
or toward the repair of any church or chapel respectively, or doing of any
thing appointed by this Ordinance to be done, if they shall now be confirmed by
the two next Justices of the Peace, they shall stand and be as good and
effectual in the Law, to all intents and purposes, as if the same were to be
made or done by and according to this Ordinance: And that it shall and may be
lawful, as well for the present as subsequent Churchwardens or Collectors, or
any of them, their Rates being first confirmed by the two next Justices of the
Peace, by Warrant under the hands and seals of two such Justices of the Peace
within such County or Towns corporate, to leavy as well all and every the said

shillings for and toward the charge and expense in leavying of the same,
rendering to the party or parties the overplus; and in default of such
Distress, it shall be lawful for any two such Justices of the Peace, to
commit him or her, or them so refusing, or neglecting as aforesaid, to the
common Goal of the County, City, or Town corporate respectively, where such
Justices of the Peace are, and such offenses shall be committed, there to
remain without Bail or Mainprize, until payment of the said several sums
and Arrearages; and to commit to the said Prison every one of the said
Churchwardens which shall refuse to account, there to remain without Bail or
Mainprize, until he has made a true Account, and satisfied and paid so much
as upon the said Account shall be remaining in his hands. Provided always,
that if any person or persons shall find him, or her, or themselves agrieved
with any Assessment, or Tax, or other act done by the said Churchwarden or
Churchwardens, or by the said Justices of the peace, or any of them, that then
it shall and may be lawful for the party grieved to complain thereof at the
next general Quarter Sessions of the Peace, where the Justices of the Peace,
or the greater number of them shall make such order therein, as to them shall
be thought convenient, and the same to conclude and bind all the said parties.

And be it further Ordained, That the Mayors, Bailiffs, or other head Officers
of every City, Town, or Place corporate within this Realm, or the Dominion of
Wales, being Justice, or Justices of the Peace, shall have the same Authority
by virtue of this Ordinance within the several limits and precincts of their
jurisdictions, as well out of Sessions as at their Sessions, if they shall hold
any* as is before limited, prescribed, and appointed to Justices of the Peace
of the Country, or any two or more of them, or to the Justices of the Peace in
their Quarter Sessions, to do and execute for all the uses and purposes in
this present Ordinance prescribed, and no other Justice, or Justices of the
Peace to intermeddle there; and that every Alderman of the City of London
within his Ward, shall and may do and execute in every respect so much as is
appointed and allowed in this Ordinance to be done, and executed by one or two
Justices of the Peace of any County within this Realm. And be it also ordained,
That if it shall happen that any Parish do extend it self into more Countries
then one, or part thereof do lie within the Liberties of any City, Town, or
Place corporate, and part without, that then the Justices of the peace of every
County, as also the head Officer, or Officers, or Justices of the Peace of such
City, Town, or Place corporate, shall deal and intermeddle only in so much of
the said Parish as lies within their Liberties, and not any further; and every
of them respectively within their several Limits, Wards, and Jurisdictions, to
execute the Ordinance aforementioned concerning the confirming of Rates, the
giving of Warrant for the leavying of Taxes unpayd, the committing to prison
such as refuse or neglect to pay their rateable part of the said Assessments
having no sufficient Distress, the taking Accounts of Churchwardens, and the
committing to prison such as refuse to account, or deny to pay Arrearages due
upon their Accounts; and yet nevertheless Churchwardens, or the greatest
number of them of the said Parishes extending into such several Limits and
Jurisdictions, shall without dividing themselves duly execute their Office in
all places within their said Parish in all things to them belonging; and shall
duly exhibit and make one account before the head Officer, or Officers, or
Justices of the peace of such Town, or place corporate, and one other before
the Justices of the said County, or any such two of them as is aforesaid.

And be it further Ordained, that if any action of trespass, or other suit
shall happen to be attempted, or brought against any person, or persons, for
taking any distress, or making any sale, or any other thing doing by the
authority of this present Ordinance, the defendant or defendants in any such
action or suit, and all others which in their aid and assistance, or by their
commands shall do any act or thing touching or concerning the premises, or any
of them, or his or their Officer, or Officers, it shall and may be lawful for
them, and every of them to plead the general issue, that he or they are not
guilty, and to give such special matter in evidence to the Jury which shall
try the same; which special matter being pleaded, had been a good and
sufficient matter in Law to have discharged the said Defendant or Defendants of
the Trespass or other matter laid to his charge; and that if upon the trial
of any such Action or Suit, the plantiff or plantiffs shall not prove to the
Jury which shall try the same, that the fact or cause of his or their Action or
Suit, was, or were had, made committed, or done, within the County wherein such
Action or Suit shall be laid, That then in every such case the Jury which shall
try ^he same shall find the Defendant or Defendants ^n every such Action or
Suit not guilty, without having any respect or regard to any evidence given by
the Plantiffe or Plantiffes therein, touching the Trespass, Fact, or cause,
for which the same Action or Suit is or shall be brought; and that if the
Verdict shall pass with the said Defendant or Defendants in such Action, or
the Plantiffe or Plantiffes therein become nonsuit, or suffer any
discontinuance thereof, that in every such case the Justice or Justices, or
such other Judge, or Court before whom the said matter shall be tried or
depending, shall by force and virtue of this Ordinance allow unto the Defendant
or Defendants his or their double costs which he or they shall have sustained
by reason of his or their wrongful vexation in defense of the said Suit or
Action, for which the said defendant or defendants shall have like remedy, as in
other cases where costs by Law of this Realm are given to the Defendants: and
for as much as the Churchwardens or Collectors aforesaid may peradventure be
careless or negligent in performing their duty; it is further Ordered and
Ordained, that upon complaint made to the two next Justices, or one of them, or
other information had thereof, the aforesaid Justices, or one of them, shall or
may in their own persons view the said Churches or Chapels, or appoint the
Minister, and some other of the Parishioners to certify unto them, or one of
them, what reparations are or shall be needful, and thereupon they or one of
them shall by a Warrant under their hand and seals to the Churchwardens order
and direct what reparations shall be done within the said Churches or Chap^els,
and limit and appoint the time for the doing of ^he same: and if the order
aforesaid be not performed, they shall bind over the said Churchwardens or
Collectors, or any of them, for their negligence therein, to the next Sessions
of the Peace, where, if the court shall allow of the order, the Offender or
Offenders upon due proof of his or their negligence or offense herein shall be
severely fined, so as the fine exceed not forty shillings upon any one of them,
and the offender is to be committed until the fine be paid, which is to be
disposed of to the use of the poor of the said Parish or Chappelry. Provided
always, and it is the intent and meaning of the said Ordinance, that the
Parishioners, and the Churchwardens or any Parish or Chappelry shall not be
charged with, or liable unto the repairing any Chancell, or Chancels, or of any
particular Isle in Churches or Chapels, which have formerly by prescription,
or custom been used to be repaired by the Parsons or Vicars, Impropriators, or
others, but that the said Parsons, Vicars, Impropriators, and all other persons
whatsoever, both politic and corporate, their heirs and successors, which
have formerly been liable to the Reparations of all or any part of any Church,
Chapel, Chancel, Isle, or other place belonging to the same by any custom
whatsoever, shall still be liable to the same to all intents and purposes; and
for their negligence herein shall and may be Ordered by the two next Justices,
or shall or may be presented, or indicted by the Churchwardens or any others,
at the next Sessions of the Peace, where the offender for his offense herein
shall be fined and proceeded against in such manner as the Churchwarden for
his negligence is to be proceeded against ^y virtue of this Ordinance. Provided
also, where any Parish or Chappelry has any Lands or Tenements or yearly
Rents, or Annuities formerly given to the repairing of their Churches or
Chapels, and for Church-duties, the Churchwardens, or Collectors aforesaid
shall be from henceforth Receivers of the said Rents and profits, and shall
have power by Warrant from the Justices, to cause the parties who ought to pay
the same to be bound over to the next Sessions, where they shall be, upon due
proof and hearing the said Parties, ordered to pay the said Rents and forfeits
to the Churchwardens and Collectors aforesaid, who shall dispose of the same
according as it ought to be disposed of, and thereby ease the Parish of so much
of the charge, and shall yearly account for the same in their accounts as
Churchwardens. Provided that this Ordinance, as to the repairing of Churches
shall not extend to Parishes or Chappelries where the Churches or Chapels are
totally subverted or ruined by these unhappy Wars, extremity of age, or other
casualties, nor to any Cathedrals or Collegiate Churches, which are only to be
repaired as formerly they have been used and accustomed. And lastly, it is
Ordained, That all offenses against this Ordinance shall and may be enquired
of, heard, and determined before his Majesty's Justices of Assize, of Oyer and
Terminer, or Gaol delivery, or before the Justices of the Peace of any County,
City, or Town corporate, where any such offenses shall be committed by proof of
witnesses upon Oath, which the Justices aforesaid shall hereby have power to
administer, and at their general Sessions of the Peace by Indictment,
Information, or otherwise, as the case shall require, wherein no wage^ of Law,
Essoyn, Protection, or Injunction shall be admitted or allowed. And it is
further Ordered by the Lords and Commons aforesaid, That all and every Sextin,
or Parish-clerk within the Parishes aforesaid, shall have their due Fees from
the several Parishes, to be ordered and recovered by Warrant from the Justices
in such manner as the Rates made for Churchwardens are ordered to be leavied
by this Ordinance; and that they be elected and chosen in such manner as
formerly in every Parish has been accustomed.
