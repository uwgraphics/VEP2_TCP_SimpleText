Certain necessary RESOLUTIONS OF The most considerable Scruples now
possessing the minds of the major part of this Kingdom, now obstructing the
intended obedience which ought to be rendered to whatever Supreme Authority Is
instantly or shall futurely be ordained over us.

Wherein is likewise manifested and maintained the necessity of our submission
thereunto, as to the Ordinance of God, against all the Sophistical
Reservations and alterations of the Devil, or humane policy.

Directed to the due consideration of all who have (or may have) any affection
to the tranquillity hoped for in our languishing KINGDOM.

By an earnest endeavourer for Peace and Truth.

Certain necessary Resolutions of the most considerable Scruples now
possessing the minds of the Major part of this Kingdom.
Dear Countrymen:
I Conceive that all of you, who are worthily entitled Christians, do sadly
sympathize in the Anxious calamities that our Nation has so long groaned
under; but the agravation of our miseries continue springing from a corrupt
Fountain of depraved zeal, contrary to and ignorant of the manifold workings
of God, instant and past providence in an evident, yet miraculous manner, over
us, and amongst us* it being impossible that even the calmest tempers can avoid
distraction in times of unwonted mutation (though from evil to good) where
judgments are wretchedly prejudiced, even against the most manifest
demonstration of the Mighties working powerfully for us.

The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and proves oftentimes
desperately wicked, even in those determinations where consci^nce unseriously
examined, seems to render them good and holy* to a remiss understanding; We
are new in times of trial, and if the Almighty weigh our fore-esteemed Gold in
the Balance of his sacred justice, proving it altogether lighter then vanity
shall man repine to have his dross (though even forcibly refined in the
Furnace of his afflictions? it may well be conceived (and justly the Peoples
eruptine discontents daily confirming it) that most of us had rather return to
the flesh pots and onions of Egypt, into stupid captivity; then magnanimously
attempt our promised and apparent deliverance through the difficult Wilderness
of opposition: But we may justly fear that thus tempting God by our
pusillanimity, when he so visibly appears before us, may justly provoke him to
bury us in the sands of our confusion before we attain the promised estate of
sanctified tranquillity.

No reasonable man is ignorant how difficult it is to unprinciple even the most
evil resolutions of self interressers; yet when the Mighty by Catagoricall
argument, writ even in Characters of Judgment, leadg^able to the whole Nation,
does convince them of depravation and folly; it were worse then madness for
any to resist, even where sense declares, they kick against the pricks: Commune
with your own hearts therefore more seriously, and ponder all the sayings of
Gods providence, delivered in so many direful judgments against the enemies
of, and extraordinary mercies to the fellow Laborers for our quietness; and
if this sacred Volume will not afford you precedent for, and exhortation to the
embracing of those things that really belong to your peace, when maturely and
conscientiously applied; yet you may happily live to see with your eyes what
hereafter, as now, God will justly blind you who not understand and partake of
in your affections, viz: even the prosperous condition of this now disturbed
Nation, wrested forth of so much bitterness and violent oyposition, as it is
inthralled under at this day.

But in respect so many consciences pretend themselves to be yet unresolved (or
rather irreasonable) some being wretchedly, some obstinately ignorant; and
frequently pretend scruples, concerning the possible lawfulness of becoming
obedient to and affectionately for the intended future Government, in regard
that most by their Oath of Allegiance, many others by the bonds of their
Covenant, stand engaged, to their thinking, with their lives and fortunes to
abet and maintain Monarchy, and utterly and forcibly to exclude, reject, and
extirpate all other Methods for common safety or Government, although they
truly appear, even in some of their own understandings, both laudable,
lawful, and most advantageous for any other Commonwealth, (so slily does the
Devil suggest that for Divinity, which will prove very Machiavilianisme in
fitting those scruples for firebrands of future dissension) It will therefore
be most requisite to consider, wherein chiefly we have just cause of scruple in
case of such urgent necessity where God so powerfully effects his own will,
and then to examine whether resistance in the same case, be not absolutely
against the Ordinance of God, which will inevitably render damnation to the
opposers in the event.

And herein I would not be mistaken for partial, or private in affection to
this course of Gods working in and upon our Nation; for I ingeniously confess,
I have ever held Monarchy to be the most absolute consistent with, and best
form of Government for any People to whom God seals not his remarkable
evidences of unwillingnesse for it; but when a People (as we have done) shall
turn such an excellent grace of God into wantonness, when our slavish
insinuating flattery shall cry non vox hominum sonat, to the destructive
dictates of a Prince, forced by our wretched acclamations to overswell with
ambition above the bounds of paternall duty to his People, well may that King
be took away in Gods displeasure from a People, that dishonor the giver in
Idolizing so rich a gift.

But to the purpose, and in pursuance of the first consideration, viz. wherein
we have just cause of scruple, (in respect of Oath or Covenant made or taken)
in case of such urgent necessity, where God so powerfully demonstrateth and
effects his own Will in change of our Government?

In relation whereunto, this Quaere will requisitely be resolved, Whether
Kings, as being Gods anointed, have not a perpetual privilege by their
original institution, to stand as the only allowed Vicegerents, and (under
God) Supreme of their People?

To which we grant, That Moses was instituted and appointed King in Jesurum,
Saul and David over Israel; but if we inquire whether Gods respect, chiefly to
his People, or of these particular Kings were intended by their Ordination, the
story of Isreal's afflictions in Egypt cleeres it, that properly for their good
of general deliverance, and not for benefit of fingular Majesty or Supremacy
to Moses, was he called of God to that great work; from whence we may plainy
argue, that the good of a People is in supreme esteem with God, and not the
Majestike advancement of Princes over them; and doubtless, (for the holy
Spirit in the whole course of that and the like Storie^ e^plaines it) God more
clearly showed supreme respect to the Peoples public deliverance, then to
M^se^ his Calling, in regard he was but to serve God and his People in the
mighty work; Now were there such an irresistible force in the Supreme
Privilege of this primary institution, that it were not lawful for God
(proceeding from this Ordinance) by man, or man from God, to alter the manner
of a Peoples Government, seeing all Governors are (...) to the People how comes
it that this Royal Ordinance was so speedily changed in the time of the same
Peoples Government by Judges: None dares affirm without blasphemy but that
their Government by Judges was approved and confirmed by the same God that
before gave them a King. And if so, how inconsistent with the good of any
Nation will it prove, to urge for that as Supreme, which God has and will put
under their feet: Saul and David were after this elected Kings, (at the Peoples
importunity for that Government) by God himself, but how displeasing the
manner of their desires were the Story evidences. And you may read how short a
succession of total Government in Israel was assigned both to Saul and David's
Posterity; might not Israel in their revolt from Reboboam have scruplized as
much to have discerted him, and change (though not their Government) their
Governors; but we find the Spirit records it to have been the will of God,
which if Reboboam had resisted, even himself had perished. Nor from hence it
cannot be supposed that Israel in their act of Revolt proved opposers of, but
operating Instruments for the then effecting of the revealed will of God,
whether to judgment upon themselves for former transgressions or not, is not
here necessarily disputable; but most certainly, God intended, and did thus
mightily manifest his own liberty to alter the Government of his people, even
by subordinate instruments, which evidence both himself and Israel disobliged
from an irrevocable continuance of that original institution of David's House
to be Kings over all Israel; And if so, questionless a people so experienced
in Gods powerful workings for a change over and amongst us, as we are, and
wherein his will by his works (and our continued offenses appear so manifestly
for it,) need not (when we are thus forcibly by the power of God in man,
dis-ingaged of all bonds to what is of present existence) though formerly
according to his will, startle to become obedient even with all willingness of
mind to that present or future Government which doubtless will be
established; and according to his will, as we hope in mercy, although we have
just cause of doubt in regard of our transgressions.

Nor will this case of conscience prove so rigidly resolvable with you whose
luke-warmnesse or fearfulness has from the beginning of our troubles
detained you in Neutrality; for it is far easier for him who has nor made it a
sin to his own conscience in conceiving it so) to have had either hand or
heart in degrading that Authority which you conceive unquestionably good, (but
has not dared to contend for) to resolve obedience to, and embrace that good
which is tender^d you without sweating for or against, than for any other whose
depraved judgments have desperately hurried them through an boast of sound
reasons to strike at the very head of such an establishment, and whose violent
motions still speak their implacable hatred to it.

But you will say, all this proves not the necessity of a present alteration
amongst us or the lawfulness of it by any power which you conceive
subordinate, in regard the Apostle so expressly charge obedience upon every
soul unto the higher powers which both by Oath of Allegiance and Covenant you
have inclusively sworn to remain properly in the King.

For solution of which (in relation only to those who have not engaged in
contest for any alteration, the rest being supposed satisfied in their own
minds already) we mnst consider that such Oaths oblige subjection no further
then to extant your Authority; And although conscience, from the tenure of such
Oaths, may justly urge obedience to be given to an essential remaining power;
yet they bind not any to obey what really is not, nor to resist what
inevitably must be; and as the power that is extinct was ordained of God, so
that power that will be confirmed by him, upon safe and in certain powers,
will prove it self to be immediately by the same will from the same God,
whether in mercy or judgment toward us, the event according to our faith or
diffidence in him will evidence.

Now wherein any further scruple concerning present or future conformity
remains, I am ignorant and the rather confident that there is justly none, in
respect that it is manifest that God in diverse ages, and to diverse Nations,
has granted other forms of Government besides Monarchy, even with
^pprobation, the certainty whereof remains upon Record, both divine and
humane, (as is well known to all that have been any thing studious in either)
and if divine providence sign a remarkable change amongst us, with his
approbation of it by so many wonderful works, both of his mercy for, and
judgment against the proceedings of the present Authority, that as none under
it must necessarily lead us to examine whether resistance mental or active in
this case will not prove it self to be against the Ordinance of God.

St. Paul tells us indefinitely, That the Powers that are are ordained of God;
then if an overweening affection to the past power (though admitted it self to
be principally the best) shall not only hinder our conformity to a present
Ordinance of God, but move us to resolve upon mental reservations for
resistance thereof, it being so clearly evidenced that is is the will of God
so to constitute such a power as we are in all likelihood to fall under,
without doubt such opposition will be verily and immediately against the
Ordinance of God, which must needs precipitate the resisters into that
consequent gulphe of condemnation mentioned in the same Text.

But Countrymen, I hope better things of you all, let not self interests
therefore or obstinacies decei^e the expectations of the peacefully minded
amongst us, for your Christian correspondence and conjunction with them in
unanimous obedience; our innumerable divisions already raging amongst us, are
more then enough to provoke the God of peace, even yet for a long season to
suspend us that heavenly blessing* and it may be justly feared, that our
refusal of it upon terms so apparently consonant with his immediate will,
will provoke him even utterly to expose us to a general destruction.

We are not unmindfull that the Silver Smithes of Ephesus may urgently and
politiquely argue for the worship of Diana, even against the Apostles of Christ
in a tumultuous manner, the almost publicly private interests of many
thousand families in respect of subsistence and livelihood, being properly and
solely supported by a Regal Government, may plead much for it. But
notwithstanding, although these may more justly call for confideration of
provision for, then the case of the Ephesians (no one interest amongst them in
it self absolutely depending upon suppression of the Gospel) yet the public
peace of a Nation instantly and futurely to be established, cannot reasonably
or religiously be held obstructable because many continuing disaffected to it,
may happily perish by it; yet doubtless God will in his good providence by his
Instruments in present Authority over us, so provide for those whose obstinacy
toward, and diffidence in them, are not the just occasions of their punishment
by want and beggary) that even the extremest downcast amongst us by that
means may at least have abundance in content.

If we would reflect upon our Saviors example (who was obedient even to an
usurper, and yet knew himself to be the absolute King of Judi successively
legitimate according to the flesh) We could not but condemn that zeal for
extreme preposterous, which animates any private man upon any specious
pretenses whatsoever to resist, or not became obedient unto that present
Authority we live under. Doubtless had it been of Divine allowance, that way
to have disturbed the present peace our Savior was not so stupedly bent to let
Caesar remain impunable for his usurpation, but his exemplary subjection,
(though the King clearly intimates how precious a Kingdoms concord ought to
be much more unto us; which who endeavors to disturb, upon any pretense; will
find it culpable in the highest nature, and justly meriting condign
punishment; a sad example whereof we are shortly to have delivered us in the
eminentest of Instruments,

But you will say, a man may be actually quiet, and outwardly subject to the
present Government, and yet in conscience reserve internal obedience, even for
his memory to, and hopes of regal Government to be restored.

But I conceive such half obedience can never prove an acceptable sacrifice,
gither to God or thy Countries peace, for the stench of reserved sedition for
every provocation thereunto, will render it abominable both to God and thy
Country.

If halting between two opinions would bring a man to heaven, who would not
prize hypocrisy as a Jewel! or if temporizing would render (...) honest upon
all trials, what need were there of (...) of integrity? he that is not with our
Savior it against him; if therefore any man resolve upon nonconformity yet as
the least his condemnation will be the less that seems no friend to what he
really abhors: Therefore if any such be, it will best became them (though
passively) to possess their souls in patience, knowing that all clandestine
endeavors of humane policy, however flourished over with sophistry, cannot
alter the imutable decree of the Almighty in any thing, much less in a matter
of so ponderous (...), as the Government of a Nation; the event of the highest
humane attempt in this nature, having ever amongst all Nations rendered them
rashly evil and manifestly both fruitless, and severely punishable, our own
sad and decre bought experience in the whole progress of our late miserably
protracted War, sufficiently of it self instanting it to every ingenious
capacity.

But in respect conscience seems with so many to be engaged to endeavor by
forcible means to establish truth amonst our people according to their own
method (Religion having been ever made a deal for all insurrections) I
earnestly desire to be resolved how it is possible for any people to profess
and endeavor for a form of godliness, and not deny the power of it in
disturbing public peace to establish it, since the fruits of the spirit are
defined to be, love peace, gentleness, etc. subjection to every Ordinance of
man for the Lords sake (either actively or passively with patience and long
suffering) being an absolute necessary concomitant.
