By the King.
A PROCLAMATION, For the better Collecting and Answering His Majesty's Revenue
arising by Fire-hearths and Stoves.
CHARLES R.

WHereas His Majesty has received frequent Complaints from His Commissioners
and Farmers of the Duty arising by Fire-hearths and Stoves, That not only
diverse of His Majesty's Subjects do refuse to pay the said Duty in such cases
wherein by the Laws in that behalf made, the same ought to be paid, and wherein
ever since the making of the said Laws, till of late, without Contradiction it
has been paid, but also that the Officers appointed to Collect the said Duty,
have been Affronted and Molested, as well by Violence offered to their persons,
as by vexatious Arrests and Imprisonments: His Majesty therefore for the better
preservation of so considerable a Branch of His Revenue, and for the
Encouragement and Protection of the said Commissioners, Farmers, and their
Officers, in the due Execution of their several Places, is pleased by this His
Royal Proclamation (with the Advice of His Privy Council) to Declare, That as
he expects the said Farmers and Commissioners, and their Officers, should
according to their Oaths faithfully Collect the said Duty, and not suffer the
same to be lessened by forbearing to Levy the same in any case where by Law the
same ought to be paid so He does hereby strictly enjoin and require all His
Subjects whatsoever, to observe and be obedient to the Laws made for the
Establishing and Collecting the said Duty, and duly to pay the same Duty in
all cases where by the said Laws the same ought to be paid: And that they
forbear to affront or molest the said Officers by any violent or unlawful ways
or means, upon pain of being punished according to the utmost seventy of Law
and Justice. And all Magistrates and Officers whatsoever in any wise concerned,
are hereby also strictly enjoined to be aiding, favoring and assisting to the
said Farmers and Commissioners, their Agents and Officers, in all things
touching the Levying and Collecting of the said Revenue, and punishing of
Offenders, as by Law they are required.

Given at Our Court at Hampton Court, the Twenty eighth day of July, 1675, In
the Seven and twentieth Year of Our Reign.
GOD SAVE THE KING.
