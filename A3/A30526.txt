Good Counsel and Advice, REJECTED; By Disobedient men.

And the days of OLIVER CROMWELLS Visitation passed over; AND ALSO OF RICHARD
CROMWELL his Son, late Protectors of these Nations.

And the many precious Warnings neglected by them, and set at naught, which
from time to time the Servants of the Lord gave unto them, as declared in these
following Letters; Whereby all may see the kindness of the Lord toward them,
by his faithful Invitations to them, and their own Apostasy and carelessness,
who rejected Warning (...) the time and day of their visitation is shut up with
the vale of darkness and reproach, which lies over them, and their precious day
of love is spent, and cannot be re-called.

(...) to (...) view, by one that wished well to them in their day, and is a
Friend unto all that love Righteousness, and hates Oppression.

TO THE READER.
FRiend, out of the same love from whence these were written, do I put them to
public view, and it was not without much doubtings and questioning in my own
spirit, but at last having found perfect freedom and strength from the Lord,
knowing that I am clear and free altogether of other ends, saving then for the
honor of the truth, and that all may see that the downfalls of these men were
not before sufficient warnings, which makes the Lord free, and his servants
free from what is come to pass upon them, and even their fall lies upon their
own heads that despised the Lords warnings, and would none of his Counsel, but
suffered the innocent to be oppressed under their power, and relieved not the
heritage of the Lord from her cruel enemies, though they had power to do it,
but sought their own glory, and how to be established in greatness in the
earth, till that the Lord has cast them out, and made them as a reproach. And
these things that have come to pass upon them, may be as warnings to all other
Rulers that does succeed them, and they may know that the Lord is Just and his
Judgments Righteous, and whosoever shall follow their steps, and be Oppressors
of the Lords heritage, as they were, the Lord shall extend his Judgments unto
them also, and their destruction shall come, even like as upon these before
them; Therefore let all the earth be warned.

I am a lover of SION.
For the hands of the Protector.
FRIEND,
MAny warnings have thou had from the mouth of the Lord, his love has been
toward thee, and the glorious day of his visitation has shined over thy head,
wherein he has called unto thee to hear and obey his voice, and would have
instructed thee in the way that thou should walk, that thy Soul might live
for ever in Peace and Rest, when this world is passed away; and that in this
present world he might have made thee a blessing to thy self and posterity and
people, and a praise in thy Dominions, and unto ages after thee, if thou had
hearkened and obeyed his voice, and chosen his way and Counsel, and not thine
own; and then would he have made thine enemies to have bowed under thee, and
the force of their policy and arm should never have prevailed against thee, and
thou shall be delivered from the will of all that hate thee, if thou yet will
hearken unto him, and receive his instruction, and set thy heart to seek his
honor more then thine own, and will let his Counsel be thy guide and ruler,
and not vain man, which must be brought to naught; even now, before the day of
thy visitation bespent, never more to be recalled, and the time come when God
will cease to strive with thee, and will not call unto thee, but will leave
thee to thy own hearts false judgment, and the counsels of treacherous men; And
Friend I as one that has obtained mercy from the Lord, unto whom his Word is
committed, being moved of him, do hereby in his presence yet once more warn
thee, that thou fear before him, and diligently hearken to him, and seek him
with all thy heart, that thou may know his Will and Counsel concerning thee,
and may do it, and find favor in his sight, and live; and now is the day that
his hand is stretched forth unto thee, to make thee a blessing, or to leave
thee a curse for ever; and the days of thy visitation is near an end, when God
will no more call unto thee, nor hear thee, when in the day of thy trouble thou
calls to him, neither will answer thee by vision nor dream, nor Prophet, but
will leave thee to the counsels of treacherous men, who will seek after thy
life, and wait for thy overthrow, and watch for evil against thee, that they
may glory in thy desolation; and such there is, of whom thou have need to
beware; and if thou reject the Counsel of the Lord, and follow the desires of
thine own heart, and the wills of men, and will not have the light of the
world, Christ Jesus only, to rule thee and to teach thee, which condemns all
evil, then shall evil surely fall upon thee, if thou love not the light in
thee, which condemns it, and the Judgments of God, nor the day of his last
visitation with vengeance, thou may not escape; Therefore consider, and mark
my words, and let this Counsel be acceptable unto thee, that thy days may be
many, and blessed upon earth; And first consider, and let it move upon thee to
meekness, to humbleness and to fear before the Lord, assuredly knowing, that it
is he that changes times and things, and that brings down and sets up
whomsoever he will; and how that thou was raised from a low estate, and set
over all, thine enemies, and thy horn was exalted above them all and he gave
thee the necks of Princes to tread upon, and more honorable; and their
Dominions to inherit, and thou was set a Ruler in much Dominion, and had favor
in his sight, and in the sight of many People who wished well unto thee for a
blessing; many victories honorable and remarkable was given unto thee, over
them who had exalted themselves against God; and ruled in tyranny over his
people; whom the Lord pitied, and thou an instrument in his hand, was ordained
by him, to lead forth a people, whom he blessed with thee, against a cruel
People, and generation of oppressors, who exercised tyranny over the Lords
heritage, till they were taken away and cast out, and is a reproach unto the
Lord and his People unto this day; and even so shall all be that follows their
example and are oppressors and tyrants over the seed of God; as they were; and
this thou know, that not by might, nor multitude, but by the arm of the
Lord, were they subdued and made a prey unto thee, and their treasures a spoil
unto thy hands; and so it was, that thou might have glorified him for ever;
and exalted him in the great Congregation, and gone on in faithfulness to the
end, and in that day when thou was raised up, when the fear of the Lord was
before thy face, and thy heart was toward him; and thou was but little in
thine own eyes, then was it well with thee, and the Lord blessed thee, and made
thee honorable, and his people had love toward thee, and desires for thee,
that thou might have been as a helper to the poor and a father to the faithful,
and a preserver of the upright from unreasonable men, and an easer of the
oppressed, and a taker away of every oppressive bond; and it was not once
thought concerning thee, that the hands of the ungodly would have been
strengthened against the righteous under thee; or that such grievous and cruel
burdens and oppressions would ever have been laid upon the Just, and acted
against them, in thy name, and under thy Dominion, as unrighteously have come
to pass in these three years, as a large testimony might be given; and this
thy suffering of such things is thy transgression, and thou have not requited
the Lord well for his goodness unto thee; nor fulfilled his will in suffering
that to be done under thee, and in thy name, which the Lord raised thee against
to break down, had thou been faithful to the end. Again consider and let it
move on thy heart not to exalt thy self, nor to be high minded, but to fear
continally, knowing that thou stand not by thy self but by another, and that
he is able to abase thee, and give thee into the will of thy enemies; when
soever he will, and how the Lord has preserved thee sometimes wonderfully, and
does unto this day, from the murderous plots and crafty policy of evil men,
who seeks thy evil, and would rejoice in thy fall, and in the desolation of thy
family and countries; how have they and do they lay snares for thy feet, that
thou may be cut off from amongst men, and die unhappily, and be accounted a
curse; and yet to this day he has preserved thee and been near thee to keep
thee, though thou have hardly known it; and the Lords end is love to thee in
all these things, and yet a little longer to try thee, and that thou might give
him the glory; O that thy heart were opened to see his hand, that thou may
live unto him, and die in him in peace; and beware least hardness of heart
possess thee; if thou slight his love, and so be shut up in darkness, and
given to the desires of thine enemies, and left to the counsels of treacherous
men, who may seek to exalt thee by flattery that they might the better cast
thee down, and destroy thee, and blot out thy name in reproach, and make thy
posterity a People miserable; but now O consider and let it enter into thy
heart, for thou have not answered the Lord, but been wanting to him for all
this; and have chosen thy own way and glory rather then his, and not fulfilled
his counsel in raising thee, for the bonds of cruelty are not loosed by thee,
and the oppressed is not altogether set free, neither is oppression taken off
from the back of the poor, nor the Laws regulated, nor liberty of pure
conscience altogether allowed; but these Dominions are filled with cruel
oppressors, and the poor groans every where under their heavy hand of
injustice, the needy are trodden down under foot, and the oppressed cries for
deliverance, and are ready to faint for true Justice, and Judgment; the proud
exalts himself against the poor, and the high minded and Rebellious contemns
the meek of the earth; the horn of the ungodly is exalted over the Lords
heritage, and they that are departed from iniquity are become a prey to
oppressors, and the cruel hearted deals cruelly with the innocent in these
Nations; and such whom the Lord has freed in their consciences from false
worships and Teachers, and from the ways of sin and death, are made slaves,
and greedily preyed upon by unjust men, through casting into prisons, and
dungeons, and unjust fines, and Illegal proceedings, and beatings and abusings,
and woundings and bruisings, hard to be expressed and large to be declared;
even the hands of many of the people over whom thou art set to rule, are full
of blood, merciless and cruel; and neither fears God, nor are subject to the
just rule and Government of men; and the mouth of many of thy subservant Rulers
and Governors that have their power from thee are as the teeth of young Lions,
and the upright and harmless, are devoured and made a spoil by them, through
policy and oppression, both in their persons and estates; if I perish I must
speak the truth; my life is not dear to me for the truth sake; many who should
have judged in true Justice and righteousness the cause of the poor, have been
as briars and thorns to ensnare and pierce the just man; and have perverted
Judgment, and turned it backward, and equity have hardly had place to enter;
most of the prisons this day in all thy Juridictions have and does testify the
unjust judgment, and the great oppressions and cruelties of some in Authority
who have used, or rather abused thy name, and made it a cloak for their
hard-heartedness; O my heart is troubled, and my bowels pained at the
remembrance of this; how does the poor cry under the heavy hand of oppession,
and the needy lament for want of true Judgment, and the oppressed groan for
want of deliverance? and these things are thought upon by the Lord, though not
considered by thee as they ought to be; and because of this will he arise to
plead the cause of the innocent against him that is too strong for him; and
will dash to pieces his enemies, and break the jaws of the devourers, and the
righteous shall not always be a prey to the teeth of the ungodly. O Friend
when will thou consider the oppression of the poor, and hearken to the cry of
the oppressed within thee, and without thee, when shall it enter into thy
heart, this cause of the unjust sufferings of the Lords people, from which thou
can not altogether be excused? for it is acted in thy name, though not by
thee. O let thy ear be opened unto the cries of the oppressed in the prisons;
and let the cause of the innocent come before thee, and let thy heart be
pierced at the consideration of these things which are come to pass in thy
days, contrary to the expectation of many, and see if it be, not contrary to
thy own promises sometimes vowed by thee; let the light of Christ in thy own
conscience answer, and some of the multitude of the grievous oppressions of
which the Land is full, has been laid at thy door and brought unto thee, but
scarcely found an entrance upon thee; and this aggravates the crime of thy
transgression, in that thou know of these things; and wonderful is it to
consider, that even thou with whom the power of the Lord has sometimes been,
should now suffer that people with whom the power of the Lord is to be
persecuted, and thy name to be a cloak for it; how many in all parts of this
Nation have been and are at this day grievous sufferers under cruel bondage
concerning tithes, that great abomination and idol, and cause of heavy
groanings? the bodies of many just men violently surprised, and cast into Goals
and prisons unjustly, and some illegally; their cruelly suffering the loss of
their liberties and the enjoyments of their families, and honest Assemblies;
and others have their goods spoiled and made havoc upon, almost to the ruin
of families by unreasonable men, through unjust Judgment and cruel dealings of
some in Authority for so much unjustly, challenged by the Priest or
impropriator, it may be; they distress five times so much, to the great shame
of the government of a Christian Nation; as may appear in a Book called the cry
of the oppressed; and how many are ready even to faint under the hard
oppression of maintaining hireling Teachers, and idol Temples; many for that
cause also being unjust sufferers in bodies and estates, by cruel imprisonment
and spoiling of goods; the very cry of this oppression reaches unto heaven
against thee, who suffers it, and against the idol shepherds who are the ground
of it, who makes a prey upon Gods heritage; and the Lord God will be avenged
upon them, and they and their staff shall utterly perish; woe unto them, and to
the idol worships of which the Land is full, which they uphold, which causes
the hearts of the righteous to mourn, because of the seed of God which is in
captivity under them; again many are unjust and woeful sufferers because they
cannot swear on this or that occasion, though in all causes they speak the
truth, and do obey Christ's commands, even such are trodden upon by unjust fines
charged upon them, and imposed oppressions; the example of which never went
before; many parts of this Land is witness of this; and this is by the
corruptness of some that bear rule under thee, who rules not for God as they
ought, but turns the sword of justice, and does unjustly thereby, and grieves
the Lord, and dishonours thee; Again some suffer long and tedious
imprisonments, and others cruel stripes and abuses, and danger of life many
times from wicked men, for reproving sin and crying against the abomination of
the times, which the Scriptures also testify against, in streets or Temples,
or other places; some having been sent to prison, taken on the high way, and no
evil charged against them, and others committed, being taken out of peaceable
meetings, and whipped and sent to prison without transgression of any Law, just
or unjust, wholly through the rage and envy of the Devil, and such who have
perverted Judgment and Justice, and some in prisons have suffered
superaboundantly from the hands of the cruel Gaolers, and their servants, by
beatings and threatenings, and putting irons on them, and not suffering any of
their friends to visit them with necessaries; and some have died in the
prisons, whose lives was not dear to them, whose blood will be reckoned on
account against thee, one day; and many more other ways have suffered grievous
things, as banishments out of Towns, and whipping and stocking, and grievous
unjust abuses, and none of these for evil doing, but for good; even because
they cannot bow to the Devil, but are redeemed out of the world and therefore
the world hates them, and some have suffered hard cruelties because they could
not respect persons and bow with Hat, or knee; and from these cruelties can
thou not altogether be excused in the sight of God; being brought forth in thy
name and under thy power; consider friend, and be awakened to true Judgment,
let the Lord search thy heart, and lay these things to mind, that thou may be
an instrument to remove every burden, and may at last fulfill the will of God,
are they nothing to thee; that such things should be brought forth under thee?
O, be awakened, be awakened, and now seek the Lords glory and not thine own,
least thou perish before the Lord and men; nay if men would give thee This was
meant that he should deny to be made King that was in agitation when this
letter was written.
honor and high Titles and princely thrones take it not, for that which would
exalt and honor thee in the world, would betray thee to the world and cast
thee down in the sight of the world, and this is Gods word to thee; what? shall
the whole Nation be perjured men, and thou the cause of it? and will thou
transgress by building again that which thou have destroyed? then shall the
Lord and his light in every conscience bear witness against thee, let it not
be, but deny thy self and thou will find the Lord honoring thee, give heed
unto my words and understand my speech, be not exalted by man least man betray
thee; the Lord give thee an understanding in this and guide thee in his
Council, and the rather above all things, let thy heart be stirred up in thee
for the Lord, for now is he setting up the dominion of his Son, which never
shall have an end, and thy Dominion must bow under it, and all the Dominions of
the earth, or else be confounded and broken to pieces, the glory of the Lord is
revealing, and thine shall be veiled before it, and the glory of all flesh
shall fall; therefore strive not openly nor secretly against his way, for it
shall prosper, there is no enchantment against us nor any formed weapon that
can prosper; know thou not that the King of Righteousness might command
thousands of his Saints to avenge him of his adversaries, and to plead his
cause against the rebellious? all power is in his hand, yea and the authority
and dominion shall be in the hands of his Saints, and every one that exalts
himself against them shall be brought down, not by an outward sword or might of
man, but by his outstretched arm, and all crowns that are mortal shall be
trodden down, by him whose crown is immortal and never fades away; therefore be
wise and learned, this is thy day, as thou dealest or suffer to be done with
the Lords people, so to thee it shall be done in that day, when their
Government shall outreach thine and be set a top of it, as thou hopes for mercy
from the Lord, when his Kingdom conquers thee and thine; Now deal favorably
and relieve the oppressed; boast not thy self though the Lord has used thee in
his hand, but know that when he will he can cast thee, a rod, out of his hand
into the fire; for in his hand thou art, if thou honor him he will honor
thee, otherwise he can, yea, and will confound thee and break thee, and make
thee weak as water before him; his love, through my heart, breaths unto thee;
he would thy happiness if thou wilfully contemn it not, by exalting thy self
and seeking thine own glory, and hardening thy heart against the cry of the
poor; and this I was moved in the bowels of pity to lay before thee, who am
thy friend, not in flattery, but in an upright heart, who wishes well unto
thee in the Lord.

A Friend to the Kingdom of Christ and not of this world, but an heir of
Immortality with the Son of God, called

The Original of this was given to the hands of Oliver Cromwell then Protector,
in the third month of the Year, 1657.



For the hands of Oliver Cromwell called Protector.
FRIEND,
I am moved to write to thee, from the occasion of being with thee yesterday,
and I take liberty from the true love and pity stired up in my heart toward
thee, who am thy friend and wishes well unto thee in the Lord, even that
salvation thou may receive, and that thy way may be blessed upon earth, and
the fruits of the knowledge of God might more abound in thee, and the fruits of
ignorance less, which does appear, which I wish might be cut off before they
wholly over-grow thee, and remove the blessing far from thee in this life and
in the life to come, and bring upon thee destruction; for the fruits of all
unrighteousness, brings death, sorrow, and misery, and the light of Christ in
thee shall answer in all things to the justness of the judgments of the Lord.
Thou say in effect, that thou would not, or thou desire not our
persecution, or that we should be persecuted by cruelty or unjust imprisonment;
now consider what the cause is, that what thou desire not to be done, yet is
done, thou having power in thy hand only to prevent what thou would not
have done, is it not thine own unfaithfulness to the principle of God in thee,
which bears witness against the persecution of the innocent? or is it that
thou may please men and therefore rather suffers wickedness to abound, and
injustice and oppression to be acted against the poor, (making it appear thou
art willing to do the false teachers of this Nation and wicked men a pleasure)
then to own the people of God in relieving them, and easing their cruel
burdens and oppressions laid upon them by unjust men, for a word of thy mouth,
or the show of thy countenance in dislike of these many cruel and unjust
persecutions, would bind the hands of many blood-thirsty men, and stop the
mouths of many devourers; and therefore because of thine own unfaithfulness
does that come to pass which thou desire not? and so I must needs say this
appears to be evil in thee, to say in effect thou approvest not, or thou
desire not our persecution, and yet it is done, when the power is in thy hand
to remove it, and this in much love and great pains, I declare unto thee in the
fear and Council of God.

Further thou say, thou art not guilty of these persecutions acted unjustly
upon us.

Again consider, I say thou can not be cleared in the sight of the Lord God
from them, being acted under thee, and in thy name, in the day of the Lord the
light of Christ in thee shall answer this; for there seems to be rather a
favoring of them in thee, and by forbearance of the actors of cruelty, by
which their hands are strengthened, then any dislike showed by thee in bearing
thy witness as thou ought to do against them; for thou know of some in
this City and elsewhere, whom we know to be just men, who suffers imprisonment
and the loss of their liberties, because for conscience sake they cannot,
swear, and many others in this Nation furthering cruel things upon the like or
same ground, even for well doing, and not for evil, which oppression might be
removed, and their unjust sufferings taken off by thee, by a word from thy
mouth or pen, and this makes it to appear that thou can not be clear in the
sight of God in these things, because not helped by thee who has the power to
help it, and this is true love; I give thee to understand in the day of
recompense shall thou know the Lord will not clear thee, except thou repent and
ease the oppressed; other things thou speak about the light of Christ, which
lighteneth every man that comes into the World with the light of life, or with
the light of condemnation, and about the Ministry of this Nation, with some
other things which I had a desire to have answered if time had been seasonable,
and thou willing to have heard, but thou should not have appeared in such
lightness, especially when speaking of the things of God which did grieve the
spirit of the Lord, and vex the righteous soul, which behavior with some words
which thou utteredst with the Light of Christ, is to be condemned, and which I
do judge with the life of God, and yet does tender and preserve the measure of
justness and honesty which is in thee, but thou art high above the principle
of God, and cannot receive the teachings of the Father into that mind which is
Light and unstable, for the Council of God is manifest to the meek and to the
lowly, but there is much in thee to be judged when thou come to the witness
of God in thee; and as concerning the light of Christ at which thou stumblest,
by which every man that comes into the World is enlightened; in short this I
say, the Light to thee is given of God, and it must thou own to be thy only
teacher, to receive by it from the Father, and to be guided by it in all things
if ever thou inherit Gods Kingdom of righteousness and peace, and this is the
word of the Lord to thee; and as concerning the Ministry of England for which
in part thou seems to plead, thus I say in plainness, generally it is not of
God but of Antichrist, and the Lord is against it, for it is the ground of the
greatest oppression of the poor in its maintenance, as any one particular
abomination which this day is in the Nation, and this is the truth from the
Lord, and if thou set thy self to uphold them by any law made, or to make
against such whom God has raised to bear witness against them their ways and
idolatries, thou shall fall with them into perdition, and be overthrown amongst
them in the just and righteous judgments, and this is the word of the Lord to
thee; for God is risen of a truth to make war against the beast which long has
reigned, and against the false prophets which has long deceived the World, and
I warn thee with hold thy hand from helping them, if thou mean to be preserved
or blessed in thy person, in thy family and in thy Armies; for as I said to
thee, the Kingdom of Christ is setting up by his own power, and all must bow
and become subject thereunto, he needs none of thy policy, nor the strength of
thy arm to advance him, yet would he have thee nor to prove thy self an open
enemy thereof, by doing or suffering to be done cruelty and injustice against
them whom the Lord is redeeming out of this World into subjection unto that
Kingdom, least thou be such a one as will not enter thy self nor suffer others
to enter, and and so destruction come upon thee; wherefore arise as out of sleep
and slumber not in this worlds glory and honor, come away and appear for the
Lord rather then against him, be not overcome by the pleasures of this World,
nor the flattering titles of men, wink not at the cruelty and oppression acted
by some who shelters under thee, and makes thy name a cloak for mischief
against the upright, but let the Testimony of God in thee answer for his
people; this Law is not just by which many suffers because they cannot swear,
and because they cannot cease to declare against sin and iniquity, let that of
God in thee bear witness, and thou and thy name being chief in the execution
of this Law, what will thy account be to the Lord in his day? Consider I say
consider, and be thou changed in thy mind and heart, least thou having
forgotten God and his many deliverances, be shut up and numbered for
destruction, and I say and desire the Lord give thee a more perfect
understanding of his ways and judgments, and that the Crown Immortal thou
may strive for, by meekness and righteousness through relieving the
oppressed, and showing mercy to the poor, and removing every burden which lies
upon the innocent, and this is the desire of him who is thy friend and would
not have thee crowned with dishonor, through suffering the people of God to be
oppressed in thy name, which will be thy overthrow absolutely if thou remove it
not by returning and easing the oppressed.

EDWARD BOROUGH.
This was delivered to his hands about the beginning of the 4th. month, 1657.



For the hands of the Protector.
FRIEND,
THou ought to stand in the Coucel of God in all things, and not to follow
the Council of thy own heart, nor to act things in thine own will, neither
should thou suffer others to act under thee, and in thy name that which is
unjust, and unrighteous; much unrighteousness, and great oppression is acted
in thy name, by which the good name (Protector) is abused and subverted, and
instead of protection by it, great unjustice is acted under it and covered with
it; and this one thing I am moved to lay before thee, which has been acted by
thee or under thee, not without thy knowledge, in which thou have done evil in
the sight of the Lord, and one day thou will know it; several in these Nations
Justices of the peace and other Officers who have been in trust under thee,
when they have owned the people of God in scorn called Quakers, have been cast
out of their places though they have not denied to serve thee and the
Commonwealth, neither has unfaithfulness to their trust been proved against
them, and also several Soldiers now of late in Scotland and elsewhere, have
been turned out of their places because of the same thing, ( viz.) for owning
the people of God, and these things are not right in the sight of the Lord,
that such who have been for many years faithful in the service and in their
trust, and hazzarded life and liberty for conscience sake, to enjoy liberty of
conscience, which they cannot now possess because of thee, but are cast out for
the exercise of their pure conscience, this thing the Lord is grieved with, and
with thee because of it, for thou did not obtain this victory of peace and
freedom by thy own sword, then why should it be thus improved to thy own ends?
Consider of it, for this makes the Nations more unhappie and less blessed,
when such who delight in true justice and judgment are cast out of their
places, and so deprived of giving their judgment among men, and absolutely
this will make thy army less prosperous and more unblessed, when such who
fears the Lord, and against whom thou cannot justly charge evil, are cast out
and despised, and this in time thou may see to thy sorrow, and as thy friend
I lay this before thee, and do in plainnes tell thee, if thou thus utterly deny
the people of God in the day of thy prosperity, and thus wholly cast them out of
thy service, they cannot stand by thee nor own thee in the day of thy trouble,
and such as thou cleavest unto may be a broken staff in thy time of need; Ah
friend, these things do show that thy heart is not right in the sight of the
Lord, and that justice and true judgment, righteousness and truth is even
despised in this Land, and not encerely owned by thee, when as such who fears
the Lord, are thus cast out of Judicatories in thy Government, and out of
defense in thy armies; what, is this the end of that long travel in wars, and
of so many fair promises of liberty of conscience, that just men should thus be
dealt withal, the Heathen Kingdoms may mock at this, that while some have
pretended liberty of conscience, are become persecutors of such whose
consciences are justly exercised, and as I have some time said to thee, much
injustice and great oppressions and cruel persecutions continues daily to be
acted in thy name, which is numbered up against thee upon account, because of
hiding thy face from the cry of the poor, as one without bowels of compassion
unto such who have truly served with thee in a faithful service for the
Commonwealth, who many of them now are grievious sufferers under thee.

Consider of these things, and search what will be the end of them, the Lord
open thy understanding, that more of the wisdom of God may guide thee, and
less of the Policy and wisdom of man, which will betray thee of Gods Kingdom,
and may in the end cast thee down in this World also

FRIEND,
IT is upon me, and also I am pressed in spirit thereunto, to give unto thee,
even unto thee Oliver Protector, the perfect measure of thy dominions, and how
they stand in relation to thee as concerning the affections of the people
toward thee, whereby thou may understand thy own condition, and the state
of thy Government as I have viewed it in true judgment, and marked it upon
serious consideration, and what I writ is in perfect love unto thee, how ever
thou may judge of it, and of these things it will be well for thee to
consider, now while it is time ere it be too late.

Many Enemies thou have which watches over thee for evil and not for good, who
would rejoice in thy overthrow; and first there is a people scattered through
all these Nations who is full of wrath and ravening envy toward thee, even of
those known by the name of malignants party, in whose hearts to this day there
is continual hatred, and evil surmising lodges against thee and all thy
offspring; and I believe (without any further knowledge) that daily advantage
they seek against thee, by subtle conspiracies and secret plottings, of
maliciousness in their evil hearts, seeking by all means if it be possible how
to be avenged, and not sliping any advantage how to revenge themselves, and the
cause of their King, and of these scattered under thy Government is not a few
but rather the greater number, who thus stands in affections to thee, with no
better purpose of good toward thee, then to destroy thee by any men's if it
were in their power, and to take away thy Name in reproach, such is the cruelty
and desperateness of some of them, their own lives are not dear unto them, to
take away thine; I have felt the strength of their rage against thee, which
carries them above sense, or fear to forego any danger that they might see
their desired end of thee; their malice toward thee is so seated in their
wrathful hearts, that it cannot easily be quenched, I know the Lord has cursed
them and their endeavors to this day, and thou have had dominion and power
given thee of God to bruise them, and to break them to pieces; and what thou
have done unto their King should not be reckoned against thee by the Lord, if
now thou were faithful to what he requires of thee; for because of the
wickedness of that generation which was grown to the full, did the Lord raise
thee up as a plague upon them, because of their unrighteousness, oppression
and tyranny, and they were made as slaves and bondmen under thy power, and
without the Lord can they not at any time do any thing against thee, but what
and if for thy wickedness in the sight of God, he should make them instruments
in his hand to accomplish his wrath upon thee, even like as he made thee once
his instrument to overthrow them, and such has been the Lords doings, even to
overthrow his enemies one by the other, and to use the wicked as a rod in his
hand, to break them one against another like potsherds; and by that which comes
to pass in these Nations, thou seems no less then to tread in their steps,
and in a measure already goes on in their way in oppressing (through Tyranny,
or suffering it) the people of God whose cause the Lord will assuredly plead
against thee one day, who now suffers under thee in patience, and who can tell
the purpose of the Lord, or what he may bring to pass concerning this thing,
in raising up the wicked to be a plague to wickedness, and in suffering the
oppressors to overthrow oppressions? this is by me in love to thee in sencerity
declared, and by thee with soberness and in the fear of God it is to be
considered.

Again there is another people scattered through all these Dominions, who is
not thy friends nor wishers well unto thee or thy Government, who secretly
murmures against thee, and envies thee, and even seeks God against thee and
thy Government, which they judge to be not according to God, and bows not to
it in love; though they are forced to submit for a time, hoping continually if
not hatching other ways of Rule and Government to the overthrow of thee and
thine; and these are more honest, and upright, and just in the sight of the
Lord then the former; and indeed they are not nor their purposes accursed of
the Lord, for many of them have been sufferers, and faithfully served their
Nation with perfect purpose of freedom to the Lords People, and they have at
this day perfect zeal for God and for his ways, though not altogether
according to knowledge, yet some of them are not far from the Kingdom of God;
though they seek it not wholly in the right way, nor looks only with a single
eye; yet does not the Lord hate them altogether because of their integrity
toward him and zeal for him; who some of them have suffered imprisonment for
truth and righousness sake, as they have wholly thought; and their suffering
has not been altogether slighted by the Lord; and these are they known by name
of the fifth Monarchy, of whom there is more then a few, with them that wishes
well unto them, who will rise up for them rather then for thee, many of whom
propounds well in their minds, though they have not power to effect it, because
their intent is not altogether according to the Lord, yet are many of them free
from that whereof thy self is guilty, and some of them are cast out and wholly
rejected without any just cause, as they suppose, and these things have grieved
their spirits, and not only kindled their rage and envy, but moved their
sincerity and honesty against thee; wherefore they are not thy friends but
rather thy enemies; and would not stand by thee or with thee in thy need, but
rather I suppose would arm themselves against thee and thy power, who highly
charges thee (as they suppose justly too) with unfaithfulness and such like,
for they see that is not accomplished which has been promised by thee, but the
contrary, even one finger is become as heavy as was once the loins; and their
spirits are grieved against thee for such causes, and who knows but that the
Lord may take the occasion to try thee and prove thee by them, for their
hearts are high against thee and thy Government, and that upon good ground, as
they sincerely think.

Again, there is through thy Dominions a People gathered and gathering daily by
multitudes, who are called and chosen of him and faithful to him, who has
owned him above all things, and whom he has owned and will own in the sight of
the whole world, and will increase them to a numberless number, according to
his promise; and even those the Lord is making many who are redeeming out of
the world, into the Government and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and these thou
know are great and grievous sufferers; by many hard and cruel oppressions,
from those who are in authority in thy Government, even unjust imprisonment and
fines and burdensome taxations, in many things hard to be expressed; and they
undergo grievous persecutions under thy Government, and wholly unjustly in the
sight of God, and also are cast out of all power and place in it, and almost
out of all subjects privilege too; many of them being counted as vile amongst
men, though they are not so in the sight of the Lord, Justice, and
righteousness and true Judgment they cannot have in all these Nations, not
from thy self nor subservant Judges, of whom hardly can their cause be heard:
but are deprived of their proper right, and of subjects freedom in
Judicatories, and exposed to all wrong that may be by unjust men through unjust
Judgment, and these things are not unknown to thee, and therefore art thou
inexcusable in the sight of the Lord, and guilty of their sufferings in his
presence, who has power to prevent it but does it not, and these thus
suffering in thy Government and under it, how can they stand for thee and thy
Government, or out of pure love be subject thereunto, though be it known to
thee that we (the People of God) does not envy thy person or Government in the
least, neither has purpose of seeking advantage against thee, or it to hurt or
betray you by secret plotting or turbulent arising, as others may, yet friend
the want of our prayers to God for thee, is worse to thee then the secret
plotting of all wicked men.

And how can we mention thee in our prayers to God except it be to be delivered
from thee, who are daily cruel and unjust sufferers by thee or because of thee,
as I have said, or how can we be friends to that Government, or subject to obey
that power under which we daily suffer such hard and cruel things, as the loss
of our liberty and estates, and danger of life also? let that light in thy own
conscience Judge, though for all these things, we do rather pity thee, and
desires thy repentance, then conspires against thee, or wishes thy
destruction, yet ought thou to consider of these things with a humble heart,
and what a condition thou art in, who is hated of the wicked with deadly
hatred, and not loved of the Saints because thou love not the Lord; also it
might make thy heart to tremble to consider how that thy Dominions are thus
divided, and the affections of the people thus dis-united, and few of them thy
real friends, some having real offense given by thee; wherefore they are forced
to loath that Government which is unjust; and others verily supposing of great
wrong sustained from thee, wherefore they are turned against thee.

Moreover and besides all this, greatly it may be suspected that even they in
whom thou do repose confidence, who seems to cleave unto thee, may not be
altogether true unto thee, though in appearance subject, yet may have secret
hypocrisy and hatching of evil in their minds, if it were possible, to uncover
thy nakedness, and some others also there may be, who may make use of places
under thee, which may have no more affection to thee nor service for thee, then
while their own ends of great advantage are served under thee, by their
subjection to thy Government; and now friend, these things being justly
considered and viewed by thee in righteousness, how is thy Dominions as a
broken vessel, that cannot easily be bound up, and as a bruised reed not to be
confided in by thee? and these several sorts of people being subtracted out of
the whole, how few is it that thou will find that are thy real and faithful
friends, who may stand by thee in a needful time; some out of envy cannot be
subject to thee, and others for the fear of the Lords sake cannot own thee in
such a Government, whereby the just suffers, even all men are ready to stand
afar off from thee, and because thou have denied the people of God, therefore
cannot he be thy trust; and verily thy state and the state of thy Dominions are
truly to be lamented, thou have so much sought thy self, that thou have lost
almost all people and their affections, every one judging themselves to be the
greatest sufferers under thee; Ah consider, for thou art but the head of a
disjoynted body, which may not easily be bound up to thee; and thou art lost
for lack of true knowledge, for the Lord has done many things for thee though
thou have not known it altogether, and much less then know thou of those
things which are eternal, which belongs to thy peace, it shows thou ownes not
the Lord who cannot own his people, but rather counts them thy enemies and
suffers all evil to be inflicted upon them; and this is the greatest of thy
misery, in that the Lord has been so good unto thee, and thy promises so large
toward him for the freedom of his people, and yet all forgot and the Lords
goodness not answered, and his people made as slaves and bondmen under thee,
suffering the loss of liberty, and even their birthright privilege in many
parts of these Nations; wherefore be awakened O man, and sleep not totally in
carelessness, but remember thy self, either to perform the good, or at least to
escape the evil which may suddenly come upon thee.

And this I have written to thee out of perfect love in the fear of God,
without the fear of any man, or without any secret or open envying of thee,
could thou but own the Lord, he would be thy strength to forgive all thy
iniquities and blot out thy sin, and to defend thee from all thy enemies; and
above all things love Judgment, mercy and truth, and fear before the Lord, and
let not his people be thy bondslaves, who is more dear unto the Lord then all
earthly glory is unto thee, and if thou could own them, they would own thee
in the face of all thine enemies, many times have thou been warned, and that
from the Lord, and thou shall confess it, when the Lords hand is upon thee and
thou delivered into the will of thy enemies, remember that I have told thee
what the Lord has showed me, happy art thou if thou can receive it, that
peace may be unto thee and not war, salvation and not condemnation, renown and
not dishonor, which waits for thee, except thou turn to the Lord.

To the Protector and Counsel.
A Servant of the Lord, and to you a friend wishes Grace and Wisdom, the
spirit of sound Judgment, and the knowledge of God unto you, that in all
things true Justice and righteous Judgment may be brought forth, and abound
unto all people, that you may be more honorable, and may be made a blessing to
your selves and this Nation, and to generations after you; but alas my friends,
how long shall Justice and true Judgment be neglected, and the innocent deeply
groan for want thereof? how long shall it be ere the distressed cry of the
unjustly afflicted enter into your hearts, I say when shall your ear be bowed
down to hearken to, and consider of the guiltless cause of many of the faithful
subjects, who lies deeply afflicted through this Nation, some under one cruel
bond of oppression and some under another, being most unjustly and wickedly
imposed upon them by cruel men, who perverts Justice and turns true Judgment
backwards, and neither fears God nor regards men, but contrary to Justice and
the good Laws of this Land, as men without reason and natural affections to
mankind, does act most illegally, to the grievous oppression of many approved
and faithful subjects, and the true knowledge and consideration hereof is
enough to pierce the hardest heart, and to vex the most patient mind, and
undoubtedly the fierce anger of the Lord is greatly kindled because of these
things, and even against your forbearance, who seems to take little notice of
such cruelties and in justice when they are laid before you; for you do not
relieve the oppressed, neither does remove oppressors as you ought to do, and
as the Lord requires of you; what, has the abundance of this worlds glory and
its treasure quite overcome and stolen away your hearts wholly from all sense
and feeling of the unjust sufferings of your brethren, who have in times past
as faithfully as your selves served their Nation with their lives and estates,
to the purchasing of this peace and freedom out of the hands of tyrants, and
such may now justly claim the benefit of this peace and freedom, and to have a
part with you therein, even by birthright, and by purchase, and also by
promise from some of your selves? but alas, while they have waited for it and
thought peaceably to enjoy the same under you, are many of them entrapped into
as great bondage as ever, if not more woeful and unjust, and they are unjustly
imprisoned and unreasonably fined, and every way oppressively dealt withal,
and are even spoiled in their persons and estates, and their lives often in
danger, being through great injustice become a prey to their very enemies, who
now takes occasion to revenge their former cause because of their faithfulness
for the Commonwealth against them, and all this is done while you look on, and
no way showing your dislike to these things, which strengthens greatly the
hands of evil doers, to add to the bonds of the afflicted, yet are you without
excuse, for you are not wholly ignorant of these things, for the knowledge of
them has often been laid at your doors, yea and the very cry of these
oppressions and cruelties reaches through the whole Land, to the wounding
deeply of all people that fears God, to know so great injustice and oppression
brought forth upon the innocent and faithful people, by some so far entrusted
as having the Law committed to them; which they pervert and turns Judgment
backwards, and the greater is the wound because you who have power to stop and
prevent these things, should no more regard to set at liberty the unjust
sufferers, and to render Judgment upon those as thus perverts true Justice, by
whom the Land is filled with violence, whereby the name of the Lord is greatly
dishonored, and the Government greatly reproached in many parts of the world,
why, because the faithful subjects cannot enjoy their birthright privilege,
as they ought, according to the Law of God and man; for their equals, yea their
inferiors have exalted themselves above and are become oppressors of the free
born people, and diverse ways does these heinous oppressions and cruelties
abound upon the innocent, and not for evil doing but for the exercise of their
pure consciences toward God; for many has been taken traveling on the high
way, and some out of peaceable meetings, and some out of their Innes and
friends houses, and by some wicked men in authority, without showing just cause
therefore, have just innocent men been whipped, or stocked, or imprisoned, or
other cruelties done unto them, and yet the transgression of no just Law truly
charged against them, neither have been convicted of any evil doing, but they
have suffered wholly innocently, only through the malice and will and pleasure
of their enemies, who have taken occasion without any just offense at all to
stock and whip and imprison many of the true and faithful subjects, and this
has not been done in secret but openly in many parts of this Nation, and you
have had information of these things, that you should have been awakened to
true Justice and Judgment, and this the Lord requires of you, though the
guiltless sufferers have born all these things without complaining, yet ought
you to have Judged justly, according to their deeds, such as caused such
cruelty and unjust sufferings, that for time to come the like might not have
been brought forth, but the free subjects might live in Peace, and rejoice
under the Government, and all perverters of Judgment and Justice might stand in
awe and be afraid, so should you be a praise to ages after you, and likewise
many who are at this present remaining in prisons in diverse parts of this land,
some upon one false accusation and evil surmizing, and some upon another, for a
good conscience sake; the cause of whom has often bin laid before you, which
seemed for the present to have some entrance upon you, yet little is brought
forth by you as ought to be in that cause, for though none of any such does
complain unto you, who have and does unjustly suffer, yet the Lord does require
you to set the oppressed and falsely imprisoned at liberty, and to bring true
Judgment forth upon their persecutors; also there is another suffering great
and grievous growing upon many, if it be not prevented, many faithful and
approved men are dispossessed of their freedom, which truly belongs to them
by the law of God and man in diverse Cities and corporations, because for
conscience sake they cannot swear, by kissing the book and laying the hand upon
it, according to the vain tradition in such causes formerly used; though to
deal justly toward God and man in their craft and science they are bound by
the Law of God, yet because they will not swear, and so break Christ's Commands,
are they threatened, and their windows shut up, and dis-priviledged of their
trading, whereby they should maintain themselves and families in the Creation;
and this one thing tends to the destruction of many, as in this world, and no
little hurt will thereby grow to the whole Nation in a generation of time, and
it is required of you by the Lord to prevent these sufferings, though many can
forgo their own freedom in this world, and their lives also, rather then break
the least Command of Christ, and thus are many faithful people made a very prey
to their enemies, and in diverse manners it is brought forth upon them; for many
also suffers deeply in the house of correction, for reproving sin, and others
are grievously spoiled in their estates, because for conscience sake they
cannot pay to maintain a professed Minister, or uphold a Steeple-house, for it
is a common thing for a Priest to take (or have it done) four or five times so
much by distress as any way he can prove a pretended due; and many other
sufferings there are, which are only for conscience sake, as because some
cannot put off a hat to a Magistrate, or the like; which gives an ill savor to
the Government in which they are acted without reproof. Ah my Friends! be
awakened to Justice and true Judgment, to relieve such unjust sufferers, and to
throw down all such heinous oppressions and oppressors, that the Lord may yet
make you and your Government blessed, after his long suffering to you which
has been great; for Justice and true Judgment in a Government is the
happiness thereof, and the foundation for a long continuance; and on the
contrary, cruelty, and injustice, and oppression being brought forth, the more
is the Government unhappy and accursed, and the sooner will the Lord overthrow
it, and bring it to a desolate end; and therefore my Friends, let this great
enemy to your persons, government and whole Nation, to wit, persecution for
conscience sake, be speedily removed, least the anger of the Lord break forth
against you, and repentance be too late, for this know, in all ages the Lord
stretched forth his hand, and in his time he quickly avenged himself for his
peoples sake, after their innocent sufferings born by them for a season, and he
is the same and changes not, and the same will he bring to pass; therefore I
say again, be awakned, and let that deadly enemy be removed out of the land, as
you tender your own safety and honor, and the glory of the Name of the Lord,
and his peoples peace, even this very enemy, to wit, persecution for conscience
sake, for it does and will obstruct all your good purposes at home and abroad;
It eats away the affections of all good people from you, and it eats out your
strength and valor, and it consumes the weakness of all your enemies; verily,
it is an enemy that will work your destruction speedily, both in this world and
in the world to come, that of God in ye all shall witness me in the day of the
Lord; I am your Friend, and these things do I write as a Friend unto you, as to
warn you of that secret enemy, so much reigning and rebelling in this Nation,
which indeed may work a greater destruction upon you then any foreign invader,
and this in time you may witness to your grief and sorrow, if something by you
be not done to suppress it; all health and peace I wish unto you in the Lord,
and thus far am I clear from the blood of you and all men, come life or death.

Oh! OLIVER,
Had thou been faithful, and thundered down the deceit, the Hollander had
been thy subject, and tributers; and Germany had given up to have done thy
will; and the Spaniard had quivered like a dry leaf, wanting the virtue of God;
the King of France should have bowed under thee his neck; the Pope should have
withered as in winter; the Turk in all his fatness should have smoaked; thou
should not a stood trifling about small things, but minded the work of the
Lord, as he began with thee at first; sober men and true hearts took part with
thee. Oh! take heed, and do not slight such, least thou weaken thy self, and
not disown such as the Lord has owned, thy dread is not yet all gone, nor thy
amazement; arise and come out, for had thou been faithful, thou should have
crumbled Nations to dust, for that had been thy place; now is thy day of trial,
take heed of joining hands with the wicked against the innocent, but hear the
voice of God, and that will keep thee from hardness of heart, and mind the Law
of God, with which thou may answer that of God in every one, and his fear and
his dread to be in thy family, and that thou may come to break the jaws of
the wicked, that rends the innocent; and that thou may be eyes to the blind,
and legs to the lame, and an help to them that cannot help themselves; and take
heed that any of thy servants that be under thy dominion of quenching the
Spirit, or limiting the Holy one, but wait for the Wisdom of God, that with it
thou may order all to Gods glory, and all his creatures, by which Wisdom they
were created and made, and that thou may find the blessing of the Lord God
with thee; and take heed of flatterers, and take heed of wild light spirits,
that will speak thee fair, but mind sober men, for there is mischief in many
minds; but if thou be kept in the power of God, and live in it, thou will live
over all, and stop and cross and tread under the intents of wicked men; and
take heed in any thing they be not thy executioners, for now thou have time,
prize it.

Righteousness amongst the people. G. FOX.

Dear Friend,
BE still, and in the Counsel of God stand, and that will give thee wisdom,
that thou may frustrate men's end, and calm men's spirits, and crumbel men
under, and arise and stand up in the power of the Lord God, the Lambs
authority, and fear not the face of man, but fear and dread the Lord God, then
his presence and wisdom and counsel thou shall have to throw down the rubbish,
and quell all the bad spirits under thy dominion, and fear them about thee;
live in the Lords power and life, then to thee he will give wisdom, and the
pure feeling thou will come into, whereby thy Soul will be refreshed, and it
will be thy delight to do the Will of God, and thy meat and drink, as thou in
the pure Eternal Power, Counsel, Will and Wisdom of God dwells, things all will
be made plain before thee, and to thee from the Lord God, in what thou do
for the Lord God thou shall have peace and the blessing, and in that so doing,
all the sober true hearted people will be one with thee in travels, sorrows and
pains, and then in that a blessing from the Lord will come upon thee, will
abound to thee and cover thee, as thou lives and art kept in the power and
dread of the Lord God of Heaven and earth, where Wisdom is not wanting, nor
peace lacking, but peace enjoyed, and counsel and instruction from the Lord God
given, and the helping arm and hand that stretches over all the Nations in the
world, thou will feel it, and with that thou will come to break down all men's
ends that they have to themselves, and the worships that men invent, and images
they have set up, for the arm of the Lord helps the righteous, by his hand he
carries the Lambs, which arm is turned against the wicked stretched over them,
and the hand of the Lord is against them that do evil, in which hand the Soul
is, and brings it into peace; therefore live in the power of the Lord God, and
feel his hand that is stretched out over the Nations, for a mighty work has
the Lord to do in other Nations, and their quakings and shakings is but
entering. So this is the Word of the Lord God to thee, and a charge to thee
from the Lord God, in the presence of the Lord God, live in the power of the
Lord God of Heaven and earth, that will make all Nations to tremble and quake,
for those be Gods enemies that be out of his power and counsel, and be thou
faithful to God singlely, without respecting any man's person, but respect the
Lord and his work, and be obedient to his will singlely, without any end to thy
self, living in the pure wisdom, counsel and instruction from God, then will thou see Gods enemies that live out of Gods wisdom, power and counsel, fall in
their pits, snare themselves, fear where there is no fear, slaying themselves
with their envy, and the power of the Lord will clear all the wicked off of
thee, as thou lives in it, and art kept in it, and this is the Word of the Lord
God to thee, and live in the wisdom and life of God, that with it thou may be
ordered to his glory, and order his creatures to his glory, and be still and
silent from thy own wisdom, wit, craft, subtilty or policy that would arise in
thee, but stand single to the Lord, without any end to thy self, then God will
bless thee, and prosper thee in his ways, thou will feel his blessing in thy
generation, and thy mind stayed upon the Lord, thou will be kept in perfect
peace, without any intent to thy self, to the glory of the Lord God, and there
will thou feel no want, nor a failing nor forsaking, but the presence of the
Lord God of life with thee; for now the state of this present age is, the Lord
is a bringing his people into the life which the Scriptures were given forth
from, in which his people shall come to have unity with God, with the
Scriptures, and one with another, for their establishing is in righteousness,
truth and peace, in which is the Kindom of God.

From a lover of thy Soul, and Eternal Good. G. F.

For the Protector.
FRIEND,
THE Salutation of my life wishes well unto thee in the Lord, and most
especially that thy precious Soul may be reedeemed out of death to God, and
live, that thou may have a rest and habitation in him, when this world is no
more.

Now whereas it is a general outcry among the Teachers and people of this
Nation, and also is doubted and has been sometime objected by thy self, that
the people called Quakers are deluded and deceived, and in error, and such
like; and now if it be possible that thy self and and others may be resolved
concerning us; put therefore all thy objections and doubtings into plain
positions, or let the wisest of thy Teachers do it for thee, and whatsoever thy
self or any for thee can object against us, or what thou doubtest of, or
stumblest at, either in respect of our doctrines or practice, let the matter be
stated in plain words, in positions or queries, and if God permit, a sufficient
answer thou may receive, to remove all conscienceous scruples, and to
confound all subtle alleadgments and evasions, whereby hereafter for ever thou
may be altogether inexcusable of all doubting or speaking against us, or
suffering evil to be done or spoken against us upon that account; and this am I
moved to give forth and send to thee, that thou may be satisfied, and all
things tried and made manifest in the sight of all men, and that all rash
Judgment and false supposition, which lodges in the hearts of many, may be
confounded and brought to naught, and let it be left off, to cry out deceivers
and heresy, etc. and causing any to suffer upon suspicion thereupon, but bring
all things to light and true Judgment, that what is proved to be the truth may
be owned, and not persecuted any more, for we are willing to be made manifest
to all men, and if any thing be objected against us, which may not be
sufficiently answered and resolved to sober men, then our enemies are more
free, and has whereof to glory in against us; but and if all occasions of
stumbling be removed by answers according to the Scriptures, and our
principles, practices and doctrines thereby vindicated, then let all the
Teachers and all our adversaries shut their mouths from biting at us, and
railing against us, and accusing of us to thee, and let thy ear be shut from
believing lies against the innocent, and let none suffer in thy Dominion under
the cruelty of men upon such a ground; and hereof I should be glad to receive
an answer, and to join issue in this cause, and in the mean time always am a
lover of thy Soul, but a witness against all oppression;

E. BOROUGH.
This was delivered to his hands at Hampton Court, in the 4th month 1658.



For the Protector.
FRIEND, Know that there is a God that does whatsoever he will, all power is in
his hand, and he brings to pass the Counsel of his own heart, and he rules in
the kingdoms of men, and brings down and sets up, he kills and makes
alive, and he changes times and seasons and Governments, and brings to
naught the counsels of men, for all power in earth and in heaven is in him; and
all his doings are right, and his ways are equal; and thou and all mankind are
as clay in the hand of the potter, he can honor and exalt as he pleases, and
he can mar and break to pieces and dishonor whenever he will, wherefore be
humble and low in heart before him, for he is the highest power that subdueth
all things under his feet; if he wound who can heal? and if he kill there is
none can make alive; and know thou it is the Lord God Almighty that does this;
in whose hands are the Issues of life and death, and he it is who can break
thee down and build thee up, who can wound thee and restore thee, and bring
thee to destruction, and say unto thee return, and to know him that does this,
belongs to thy eternal peace.

Wherefore hearken thou to the word of the Lord, that thy soul may come out of
death and live; and fear the Lord God, before whom thy heart is naked and bare;
who can mould thee and change thee, and fulfill his pleasure upon thee, even
according to his own will, and who shall say what does he? and now come to
consideration, and let thy heart be more upright before him, and choose his way
and counsel, that he may bless thee, and seek his face to behold his
countenance, that thy soul may be satisfied by his word, and the milk of the
word may nourish thee unto life immortal, and mind his pure presence which is
life, even God with thee; Christ the Immanuel to dwell with and walk in thee;
which is the promise of the Father; and first come to the principle of God, and
feel the word of God in thy heart, that will beat down the nature into which
temptations enters, and the word will bring thee to War against and to overcome
all thy enemies, which would defile thee or betray thee; and it will bring thee
to know a birth immortal born in thee, and a Crown immortal received from God
that dies not nor fades not away, and then he that Rules over heaven and earth
will be thy shepherd to feed thee, and thy Teacher to guide thee, and thy
Counselor to direct thee in all things; and thy immortal soul will be
satisfied with the bread that comes down from heaven which the Father gives,
and the Covenant of God and the mercies of David that are sure will be
revealed, and his promise fulfilled in thee; and life and immortality brought
to light through the Gospel which is the power of God, which destroys and puts
off, and confounds the first man and his knowledge; and wisdom, and his sin and
righteousness, all which is in transgression against the life of God, and the
Gospel the power of God being received, it will raise up the seed of God in
thee, and bring thee to know the second Adam, the image of the Father which the
Devil has nothing in, but he overcomes the Devil who has been the Lamb slain
by transgression, since the foundation of the world; and he it is that comes
out of death that must take away thy sin and destroy it, and cover thy
nakedness, and create thee a new, and give thee acceptance in the Father
whereby thy soul in him may be refreshed, and a habitation in him thou may
have when this world is no more, and for this thou ought to wait above all
things.

And friend, thou have need of the Wisdom of God, which is from heaven to guide
thee in all thy affairs, that by it thou may be preserved from the will of
thine enemies, and from all that hate thee, that their eye may be blinded that
watch for evil, and their wisdom and policy confounded and brought to naught
that hatches mischief against thee; so feel a measure of the Wisdom of God in
thee to guide thee in dread and Authority, and thy enemies will be afraid; for
to walk in the fear of the Lord and in his Wisdom and Authority, in Justice,
truth and righteousness, that will make thee a greater terror unto thy enemies
then all worldly policy and craft; the Nations will over reach thee, if thy
strength be there, and if Judgment, Justice and Righteousness be neglected by
thee, how should the Lord honor thee and defend thee; nay he will bring
dishonor, and give thee into the will of thy enemies; for want of truth and
just Judgment causes a Land to mourn, and her People to sit as a widow
comfortless, wherefore love Judgment, truth and righteousness, and walk
therein, and thou will leave a praise behind thee and a witness to other Ages
that thou have served the Lord in thy generation, and then thy memorial shall
never die, nor thy name come into reproach among the heathen; wherefore let all
oppression be removed, and let the just go free, and let Judgment and
righteousness run down, and be thou a praise and a blessing to all that do
well, and a rerrour and a dread to all the contrary; arise and stand up for the
Lord, and he will give thee strength and victory, and will make thy horn as
Iron and thy hoof as brass to push down down and tread under the high places of
Idolatry, in all the Apostatized Churches both Papists and others out of the
life of the Apostles, and as thou comes into the life the Apostles were in,
then thou will see and fathom over all this Profession of Christ, and all
these Churches that are without the life of Christ which is come up in the
Apostasy, and as the life of God arises in thee thou will see who the false
Prophets are and deceivers which Christ prophesied of should come, and John saw
were come in his days, which has overspread the Nations, and these are they
which has the sheeps clothing upon them; but inwardly they are ravening
Wolves, and such are they that will flatter thee for great Benefits and places,
and large maintenance, they have Christ's words and the Apostles words, the
sheeps clothing, but they that put not into their mouths they will prepare
War against them, and raven upon them, cast their bodies into prison or spoil
their goods; and will thou bring thy name into dishonor to all the Saints upon
earth, by defending of these in their evil ways, thou ought not to do it,
nor to suffer the innocent to be trodden down and destroyed for denying such,
and witnessing against them that are out of the life of Christ, and a great
overthrow will the Lord make among those Teachers, and such a Ministry that
need to be defended by carnal weapons, and by stocks and prisons; for such
Teachers and Ministry is not of Christ, as is manifest; and as People have been
scattered after them for ages, so they shall again be gathered from them by the
spirit, to follow the Lamb whethersoever he goes.

And take heed these Teachers come not too near thee, neither put confidence in
them, for their hearts are not right before the Lord; and they will flatter
thee while they hatch evil against thee, but stand over them in the Dominion of
God; and if they sow spiritual things, let them reap carnal by a free gift, and
if they have flocks let them eat of the milk freely given them, and if they
have planted any thing let them eat the fruit, as it comes freely, and be not
thou combered about maintaining Ministers, but free thy self of that burden,
neither suffer innocent men to be trodden down and destroyed in their persons
and estates about the maintaining of such Teachers, which is become the
grievousest oppression in the Nation.

And as concerning thy family, thou have need of Gods wisdom to guide thee,
that thou may Rule in Gods Authority over all light, loose, proud, wanton,
ungodly, and deceitful persons; take heed of such spirits, for they will be a
temptation to thee to draw thee into evil, and into the world out from God, let
no such be thy companions, nor remain in thy house, lest they betray thee with
flatteries and honor which perishes, and such profess much love and great
duty in words, yet they being out of the fear of the Lord, cannot be blessed
unto thee in their service; wherefore love such men and let them be thy
companions that fear the Lord; and that are solid and sober and upright, such
as may be good examples before thee, which will quench evil and not increase it
in thee; and though such appear not in flatteries toward thee nor with a
double mind, yet they will be faithful to thee, and such will the Lord bless
unto thee; and let no drunkards nor covetous, evil minded persons that seeks
themselves and not the Lord have place with thee, for they will be a dishonor
to thee, and bring the curse into thy family: and love such as makes conscience
of their words and ways, and be not an oppressor of the tender conscience of
any, but let the Lord be Ruler there both in thy self and in all thy family;
and be of a pitiful, tender mind and spirit toward strangers and all people;
and be kind and long suffering toward all, yet let Justice reach to all
transgressors, and be an example to all in Authority under thee; and let not
evil and cruel hearted men bear any place, for such renders thee and thy
Government dishonorable, and by such the Land is filled with violence, and the
just mourns, whereby the blessing is kept far away, and the curse near, ready
to devour: Now friend, if thou come to be guided by the spirit, and with the
wisdom of the Father, then thou will bring the Nations into good order, whereby
the inhabitants may live in peace and perfect freedom from all oppressions and
vexations that now is a bondage upon the just and upright, for there is great
corruption entered into all places, and sorts of men, and when the Lord
touches thy heart and makes thee rightly sencible of all things as now they
stand, then thou will see the Ministry as now it stands to be quite degenerated
from what the Ministry of Christ was in the days of the Apostles, before the
Apostacy; and as it now stands there is much of it which is to be thrown down
to the ground, and crushed to pieces; for its corrupted altogether, even in the
way of its setting up and of its Call; and in the way of its maintenance and
practice, in all these things it is corrupted and degenerated from what the
Ministry of Christ was before the Apostasy; And this may be proved by the
Scriptures, and so it is not to be upholden by thee, but to be corrected and
thrown down the rather.

And likewise in Magistracy, thou will see great corruption entered, and
abundance to be purged out, for it is much degenerated from the state as it was
ordained of God, and in the Laws there is much to regulate and correct, when
thou comes to the principle of God in thee; if ever that arise in thee, it will
bring thee to thresh down and trample down all unjust men that handles the Law,
and all such that Judge for gifts and rewards; and all such Lawyers that
devours the innocent for gifts, that will not plead the cause of the poor
without great Fees; and all the Priests that Preach for hire, and the Teachers
that teach for filthy lucere and to get gain, all such men will be counted as
briars and thorns by thee, to be plucked up by the roots, and to be cut up as
evil trees which cumbers the ground, for such does corrupt the Land and cumbers
it; and if ever the Lord does arise in thee he will reward them by thee
according to their ways, whose ways are corrupt before the Lord.

And as concerning thy War and Armies abroad in Spain, something there is in it
known to the Lord, seek not thy own honor in it, but be faithful, and leave
the issue of all things to the Lord; make no Covenant with Idolators, but tread
down their idol gods that they have set up, and hew down their mountains in
which their confidence stands, and plow up their ground that the seed may be
sown after thee: its honor enough to be the Lords plowman, be thou faithful
in what the Lord calls thee to, and thou shall have thy reward, and seek his
honor and he will honor thee; and let thy mind be to the Lord in all things,
and feel his word and power and presence in thee, to quench all that which is
contrary, and then thou will be blessed in this life and in the life to come;
but if thou continue in thy oppression, the Lord will suddenly smite thee.

For Oliver Cromwell.
FRIEND,
THe Lord has visited thy house, because thou have suffered thy servants, to
smite the Servants of the Lord, and Lambs of Christ, and prisoned his Lambs,
and Sons, and Daughters, some until death; Therefore thy sons, and daughters,
and servants will I take away with death, and visit thee and and thy house with
sickness says the Lord, and thou shall know that I am the Lord who reigns;
therefore spare my Sons and Daughters, that I may spare thee and thy house, and
that thou may know that I am the Lord; Oh! how art thou fallen under men?
and thy house will suffer as long as my Sons and Daughters and Servants suffers
by thee and thy servants, and die in prison, and you not visiting them, nor
suffer their own friends to visit them; therefore take heed least thou become
as weak as water.

And Friend, thou should have invited all the Christians upon earth in all
Nations that are against popery to thee, to come in and join with thee against
popery, for thou have had authority, stand to it, loose it not, nor abuse it,
nor let any other take thy Crown, and do not stand cumbering thy self about
dirty Priests that flatter thee for means, for thou have had fair warnings, and
thou have had power over Nations, for Nations begins to be upon heaps, and
Nations and tongues, and multitudes are waters, and the beast has power over
them who has long reigned, and they begin to swell, and the whore sits upon
them; nevertheless, do not thou heed nor fear them, nor be of a doubtful mind,
neither fear their amazements, but let thy heart be single to God, and wait,
that the seed of God in thee may come until the top stone be laid, and invite
all them that profess against the Pope in all Nations to join with thee
against him, and do not loose thy Dominion nor authority, nor the wisdom of
God, but with that thou may order all, that will keep thee single in heart and
mind to the Lord, and let thy soldiers go forth with a free willing heart,
that thou may rock Nations as a cradle, and keep thou in the fear of the Lord,
and all thy soldiers, and them that be under thee, this is a charge to thee in
the presence of the Lord God, that thou nor them may lose the dread of the
Lord, for that is it that strikes terror in the hearts of all people, and set
all the prison doors open for them to come forth that are imprisoned for
Churches and Ministers maintenance, and worship, and learn the patience, for
the Lords work is begun already in other Nations, and the patient spirit
remains in the Lords work, for that is it that tries, stands and abides, which
gets the victory, and obtains the Crown; if any hurt come to thee, it will be
through thy disobedience to the Lord.

I am a lover of thy soul and Eternal good, an establisher of righteousness.
G. FOX.

This is for the Protectors Kindred, his Wife and Children, to be read soberly
by them in the fear of God.
FRIENDS,
REmember, that by the Lord you were raised from a low state, and when he will,
he can abase you and bring you down, he gave you the Palace of Princes, and
threw out the high and mighty before you, because of their wickedness, which
was great in the sight of the Lord.

Oh, remember this every one of you, and come to the witness of God in you,
and be humble, and meek, and lowly, and let the Lords fear be in your hearts,
and be of a tender spirit, having your minds exercised in purity, in
holiness, and in righteousness, and exalt not your selves, nor be lifted up
in your hearts in the pride and vain glories and honors of this World, least
the Lord cast you down, and make your name and posterity a reproach, as he has
done many before you, even for that cause was the generations of the Stewarts
cast out, and if you walk in the same steps, and do the same things, and become
guilty of the same abominations, and suffer the Children and Servants of the
Lord to be persecuted (as many are at this day, some until death) shall the
Lord spare you? nay, he will cause you to feel his hand of judgment, and bring
you down with sorrow, and he will vex you in his wrath, and smite you with his
rod more and more, till you learn his fear, and depart from all your
iniquities, and the Lord will deface your glory, and pull down your crown, and
he will make you know that he is the Lord that does whatsoever he will;
Wherefore humble your selves under the hand of God, and search your own hearts,
and cast out the abominations that vexes the spirit of the Lord, and suffer
not the people of the Lords precious flock to be devoured, and made a prey to
the wicked, for because of this, the rod of affliction comes upon you, and may
suddenly break you to pieces; but mind the seed of God in you, which is
oppressed, and wait to know the power of the Lord which will redeem you out of
sin and death, and reconcile you to God, and bring you into fellowship with
himself, to enjoy peace and rest for your souls, that you may be made heirs
of the inheritance of an endless life, and this would make you truly
honorable, and will be more satisfaction to you, and joy and content, and true
rejoicing, then all worldly crowns and worldly glories, which will waste and
consume away, and leave you miserable; and remember that you are now warned
from the Lord God, by whom I am moved to write this unto you in dear and tender
love to you all, and one day you shall witness it: And as concerning the
Quakers (so called) who are accounted as vile in the sight of men, and are cast
out of all power and place in the Nation, being despised of all, and also are
reproached, persecuted, and imprisoned, and all manner of evil and injustice
unrighteously done and spoken against them (by wicked and corrupt men in
authority) yet are they the Children and Servants of the living God, and
greatly beloved of him, and are as dear to him as the apple of his eye, and his
power and presence is with them, and the time is at hand that the Lord will
make their persecutors fall, and their enemies bow and tremble, though now they
suffer unjustly, and are trodden down, as not deserving a place on the earth,
yet it is for righteousness sake, and because they show forth the image of the
Father, and not for evil doing; and will not their sufferings lie upon you? for
many hundred have suffered cruel and great things, and some the loss of life,
though not by, (yet in the name of the Protector) and about a hundred at this
present day lies in holes and dungeons, and prisons up and down the Nation, and
some at this time are sick nigh unto death, whose sufferings cries for
vengeance, and the Lord hears the cry; wherefore save your selves, and let
the innocent be delivered, and the cruel bonds of oppression broken, and the
exercise of a pure conscience go free without persecution, and then the Lord
will turn away his anger, and cease to smite you with his rod which has been
upon you, and he will give you peace, and make you blessed if you come to be
lead by his spirit into all truth* and though these innocent Lambs of Christ
suffer thus under this present power, yet are they not enemies to you, but are
friends to your persons and families, and pitties you, and loves you, and
desires well for you in the Lord, that you may repent and be healed, and even
that your hearts may be opened, to receive refreshments to your souls, and that
you may be established in righteousness and truth over all your enemies, and
may not be confounded, nor your posterity brought into reproach, which is
hastening upon you, and though our love be disputed and we accounted hateful in
your sight; and looked upon with derision; yet we bare all things in patience,
truly desiring your returning and repentance, and not your destruction, but if
these doleful sufferings of the Lords poor Lambs be continued by this present
power, it will destroy you and undo you, and break you, and confound you; and
the Lord will not cease to smite you with his rod of sharp rebukes, and he will
make you know his Peoples cause shall not be unpunished, Oh did you but know
how hundreds have and do suffer, how the bodies of some have been tortured by
stocks and cruel whippings, and how some lies sick in stinking holes and
dungeons on the ground, or a little straw at best; ten or often more in a
prison together; and sometimes their own friends not suffered to come to visit
them with necessaries; Oh did but your eyes behold, or your hearts perceive the
greatness of the cruelty which some of the Lords dear servants and your
faithful friends undergo, it would make your hearts ache, and your spirits to
tremble, and all this is done in the name and under the Authorty of (
Protector) therefore how should the Lord but lay it to your charge and afflict
him and his family; he will make you know there is a God, that can do
whatsoever he will, and that life and death are in his hand, and all creatures
are as clay in the hand of a potter, and he rules in the Kingdoms of men, and
pulls down one, and sets up another according to his pleasure, but if the
love of God be withheld from you, it is because of disobedience to him, and
your transgression; Wherefore be obedient to him, and love his ways and
judgments, that he may make you more happy, with a Crown Immortal that never
fades away; and remember once more the Lord has warned you, by a Friend unto
you in the Lord,

Written the 1. day of the 7. month, called Sept. 1658. Copies of this were

To thee, Richard Cromwell (called) Protector of these Nations, is this moved of
the Lord God of heaven and earth, to be written for thy Instruction from him.
THere is a great and mighty and Innumerable people come and coming up out of
Aegypts Land, traveling toward the Land of rest, promised of the Lord to
them, to be obtained and enjoyed by them, and they do and have sojourned
strangers in these Nations (over whom thou art called to Rule, and appointed
chief Governor) this 7 years, and greatly are and have they been afflicted and
oppressed, and even trodden down through unjust Judgment and unrighteous
dealing, by the Rulers and Inhabitants of the Land; and all the days of thy
Father the late Protector, they were held in great captivity and bondage, and
unrighteous men made them a prey, and laid heavy yoaks of cruel sufferings
upon them, and daily increased their task; and something thy Father did for
them in their journey of great distress, yet but a little of what the Lord
required of him, and what the Lord looked for that he might have done, for
power was in his hands given him of the Lord, but he was not fully obedient;
and therefore was the Lords hand stretched out somewhat against him and his
Family, and he was smitten of the Lord, and suddenly taken away in Judgment,
for he hearkened not to the Counsel of the Lord concerning that people, neither
did fully relieve them from oppression, but slighted many warnings from the
Lord, and the day of his visitation passed over, and death took him away in
disobedience, while this people were yet under great oppressions, for he left
above a hundred of them in prisons, unjustly suffering for ^^righteousness
sake, and not for evil-doing; and in this he fulfilled not the Will of God, but
left his name and glory somewhat stained, because of these things; and though
the Lord chose him, and showed love unto him, and gave him power over his
enemies, and made him an Instrument in his hand to break down great
oppressions, yet he was not obedient to the end, to do my will says the Lord,
but left something undone which he was truly called unto. Now this innumerable
people that is come and coming up, as aforesaid, are them called Quakers, and
this Aegypts Land, is that great darkness, ignorance, and wickedness, and false
ways and worships in the Apostasy, and fleshly bondage to sin and death, which
all the world, and kindreds, and multitudes that are unconverted to God lives
and walks in; and that Land of rest promised, to which they travel, is, the
peaceable and quiet dwelling with the Lord, free from the heavy oppression of
sin and iniquity and cruelties of men, and free in the exercise of their pure
Consciences by the Spirit of the Lord, as it shall move and lead them into all
truth; and their sojourning as strangers, is, their denying and despising the
world, and all its glories, and walking in the daily Cross of Christ, whereby
they are crucified to the love, and respect, and renown and honors of the
world, and are come out of kindreds, tongues and people, counting the reproach
for Christ great riches, not respecting men, but the Lord altogether in all
things, and also their suffering unrighteusly, false imprisonment, and spoiling
of their goods for righteousness sake, this is their sojourning as strangers;
And that something, that thy Father did for them, is, he released many of them
dives times out of prisons, where they were unjustly cast, and he signified
sometimes his displeasure against them that made them suffer, and showed love
to them in hearing their innocent cause, with some respect thereunto; and that
which he did not, which he might have done, is, he took not away Tithes, that
cause of great oppression to many, nor the unrighteous laws wholly as he ought
to have done, and as the Lord required of him:

And know thou from the Lord, that this same people are the people of the Lord,
and beloved of him, and as dear to him, as the apple of his eye, and his
presence is with them, and he leads them as a flock by his Spirit into all
truth, and who shall bless them shall be blessed, but he that acts against them
shall not prosper, but be smitten of the Lord, for their cause will the Lord
plead in his Judgments, and avenge them of their enemies, and the dread of the
Lord God shall fall heavy upon the heads of their persecutors, and though they
are hated of all men, and are under great afflictions, yet are they a Just
people, and innocent, seeking the good of all men, and are peaceable toward
all, and receiving all manner of wrongs and evil, and speakings against them by
ungodly men; but they render to no man evil for evil, but bless them that
curse, and do good to their enemies, and bears all things from all men in long
suffering and patience for they are learned in the practices (of doing and
suffering) of the holy Apostles and Prophets, and are of the seed of Abraham,
who was the friend of God, and they were thy fathers friends, and are not
enemies to thee, nor to righteous Government, but wishes well unto thee in the
Lord, and that thou may not be destroyed in wickedness, but be established in
righteousness and peace in thy Government, to rule in Gods authority over all
wicked men that may seek thy hurt; and we desire for thee, that the Lord may
give thee wisdom and a perfect understanding, and the Spirit of just and sound
Judgment, to Judge righteously in all things, and to settle the Government in
true Judgment, that the principle of God in every man may answer to it, in
defending and preserving and protecting all that walk in truth and
righteousness, and being a terror to all evildoers; for, for that end is rule
and government ordained of God amongst men, to be a praise to all that do well,
and a terror to all that do evil; and now the Lord having suffered it to be
brought to pass, that thou art set up in thy fathers stead to be chief Ruler
amongst men, this the Lord God Almighty requires of thee, as thou hopes to
prosper and be blessed in this life, and to enjoy life Eternal when this world
is passed away; and this is the Word of the Lord God unto thee, be humble, meek
and lowly in heart, and exalt not thy own horn, nor seek not this worlds
honor, but seek the Lord with thy whole heart, and let Justice and true
Judgment and righteous Government (which is according to the Law of God) be set
up and exalted in the Nations, and come to know in thy self the Dominion and
Authority of the Lord God over sin and transgression, and to keep down and
condemn all that which is contrary to God in thy own heart, and that will make
thee a dread and a terror to men and Nations, and then the Lord will be thy
Crown, and his people will rejoice in thee, and lift up their hearts to God for
thee; if thou throw down and abolish all unrighteous laws and decrees, which
have been set up in the days of ignorance, and yet stands, wherereby the Lords
dear Children are afflicted and oppressed at this day, and establish such a
Government which is justly according to God, in which righteousness and truth,
Justice and true Judgment may run down, and all the contrary may be stopped
and chained, and limited and confounded; and then that which thy father left
undone, the Lord will fulfill through thee, and doing these things, the Lord
would make thee truly honorable and happy, and blessed in this life and in the
life to come; but in doing the contrary, the Lord will make thee a curse, and
take thee away in his Judgments, and thy name shall be left a reproach to ages
for ever; and if thou do rule in oppression and cruelty, and suffer the
innocent to be destroyed for want of true Judgment; then shall thy days be
fewer then thy fathers; if thou be disobedient to him, the Lord shall cut thee
off, and thy memorial shall rot; and this is the Word of the Lord God to thee.

And as for this afflicted and sojourning people, they desire nothing to thee
but truth and peace and righteousness, and no more of thee but Justice, Justice
and true Judgment, and that they and their little ones, which to them are
brought forth, may sojourn in peace, and quietly pass through the Nations, till
they come up to the Land of Promise, and they may not carry away of the glory,
nor riches of this world with them, nor seek great places of honor from thee,
nor be hurtful to thee, nor the people, nor to mankind in their sojourning,
only what the Lord Commands them, that they must do, and what he forbids, that
they must not do, for they have chosen the Lord to be their Leader, and to give
him their obedience in all things, and thy Government so far as it is according
to God, they will not destroy nor rebel against, but are true friends
thereunto, and subject in all things; and if thou walk with the Lord, and choose
him for thy Counselor, and abase thy self, and altogether exalt him, and
preserve his people that fear him, then shall thou prosper, and thy name shall
be greater then was thy fathers and the numberless number of this (now)
distressed people will be unto thee a strength, and stand by thee in thy day of
trouble, and defend thee and thy just Government, and their hearts shall cleave
to thee, and thou shall prosper for their sakes, and none of thy enemies shall
shall have power over thee to destroy thee, though many may seek for thy life;
Wherefore my friend awake, awake, and now consider the day of thy visitation is
present, and thy fathers is past, and now thou have a time to gain unto thy
self everlasting honor and renown, or otherwise to leave thy name a curse and
a reproach for evermore; do thou hearken to the voice of the Lord, and fear his
dreadful Name, and bow before our God that made Heaven and earth, who rules in
the kingdoms of men, and pulls down one, and sets up another at his
pleasure, and as he will, and he will make thee know that he lives and reigns
over all, and does whatsoever he will, and if he smite thee, none shall heal
thee, and if he wound thee, none shall comfort thee; Therefore take him for thy
Counselor, and beware of the wicked counsels of men, for thou have many
enemies, and they would rejoice to see thy fall, and if the lord be not on thy
side, thou cannot long stand, but if thou be obedient to him, and preserve his
people, and break down all oppression, then thy enemies shall fall, and thy
foot shall tread them down, and the terror of the Lord shall be upon all that
hate thee; but thus shall it be done unto thee, if thou be disobedient to him,
and reject his Counsel by his servant.

I am thy Friend, and a lover of thy Soul, and seeks thy happiness in this
world, and in the world to come, known to many by of the name of EDWARD
BOROUGH.
The Original of this was delivered to him, a few days after he was proclaimed
Protector.



To Richard Cromwell, Protector (so called.)
FRIEND,
THou being chief Magistrate of these Nations, and Dominions belonging
thereunto, Carry thy self wisely in the fear of God, and take heed of being
lifted up, but be low, and grave and temperate, then thou will foresee dangers
that would happen to thee, and come upon thee, and not a plot or act against
thee, but wisdom foresees; live in that; mind the humility of Moses, the
meekness of Moses, and the humility that Solomon the King speaks of, who says,
That before honor was the humility, Prove. 15. And keep on thy own legs, in
the power and strength of the Lord, waiting for his wisdom from above, by which
all things were made and created, with which wisdom thou may be ordered to
Gods glory, and all thou have under thy hand to his glory, that with it thou
may feel the blessing of the Lord God of glory and life with thee, whereby
thou may come to see the Law of God, and counsel and wisdom and strength from
him, and understanding and knowledge, that with the Law of God received of him,
thou may come to answer the principle of God in every man, which Law of God,
the higher Power, goes over all transgressors, and with that order the
Creation, which will let thee see as it did Moses that meek man, before any
transgression was, the first transgression upon the earth; this Law the higher
power to which the Soul must be subject, the which is a terror to the
evildoers, a praise to them that do well, is higher then all the transgressors
and evildoers upon the earth, and a terror to them that do evil, which Law
and higher Power answers the Principle of God in every one that do evil, which
goes from that of God in them. Now this is for the praise of them that do well,
for them that do well are led by the Spirit of God, and such lives in the
power, and this Law was not made for the righteous, but for sinners and
transgressors; now there is no sinner nor transgressor upon the earth, but
first goes from the principle of God in his own particular, then he goes out of
the fear of God, and loses his Wisdom and Counsel, and such will turn the sword
backward against the righteous, which the Law was not made for, and by such
has all the righteous upon earth suffered, and such has been all the
persecutors upon the earth from the foundation of the world, that is first gone
from the principle of God in their own selves, and have been in authority, they
have persecuted the just, and turned it against the just, and made a prey of
such as reproves in the gate; yea, they that departs from sin and evil, comes
to be their scorn, and these were they that made men offenders for a word, and
compelled others to do such things which they could not, but sin against their
own Consciences, and against the Lord, and such the Lord soon cut down, and cut
off, and swept away; and often when things are young, they are tender, but when
they grow up into prosperity, they grow wanton, and forget the Lord; therefore
friend, live in Gods Wisdom, if thou will reign in his power and strength, then
none shall touch thee, and all them that fear God, will be on thy side, and
take thy part, and be one with thee in all thy sufferings, yea, till death.

And friend, let no wild raw flatterers that will be lifted up by gifts,
rewards or high places bear any Offices, for such to thee will be a burden at
last, and will clog thee, and flatter thee for their own ends; shake off such
spirits from thee, and let no Judges or Justices or Priest be authorized that
will persecute men for Religion, for such are not in the mind of Christ not the
Apostles, for they wrestled not with flesh and blood, nor watered with it, but
with the principalities and powers and rulers of darkness, and spiritual
wickedness in high places, Ephesians. 6. 2. that they struck down, which caused the
enmity amongst people, and they did not strike at the Creatures, nor wrestle
with them with flesh and blood, with such they did not war withal concerning
Religion; and Christ, when they would have had fire come down from Heaven to
consume them that opposed him and them, Christ rebuked them, and told them,
they knew not what Spirit they were of, and he said, he did not come to destroy
men's lives, but to save them; so all Judges and Justices and Priests, that will
have men's lives destroyed, and war with flesh and blood, and wrestle with that
about Religion, they are not of the mind of Christ and his Apostles the true
Ministers, for abundance of prisonment to death and bloodshed has been in
these Nations, by the blind zeal of Magistrates, Judges, Justices and Priests;
therefore that's the cause the Lord has turned them upside down, that they
stand not long, because they fight against the righteous and the just, and
wrestle with creatures, and flesh and blood, such are not worthy to have the
names of Magistrates nor Teachers, as thou may read. And friend, take heed of
letting any Jailer bear Office that's a drunkard, profane swearers, as many of
them is, or letting people lie long in goales, twenty or thirty together, for
such they learn badness together one of another, and Goalers be bad examples to
them, that they are worse when they come out, then when they went in.

And friend, take heed of letting any Judges exact upon the people in the poor
Countries where they come, and their Courts by tricks, but keep them all to so
saying and so doing, not saying one thing and doing another, for they have made
many people come up to them 200 miles, and when they have come, they have said,
they do not mean as they speak, and this be their tricks, as by their writs
they must appear personally, and then when they come, they must appear by
Attorneys or Counselors, when the poor man knows his cause well enough himself.

And friend, take heed of holding up the Priests, and them called Ministers,
and giving them means and maintenance, for which they do not work, least in thy
name they sue the people, and cast in prison till the death, and so make thy
name to become a cloak for their persecution; for who sets them on work let
them pay them their wages, and whom they work for, let them give them their
meat, and that will be like the Ministers of the Gospel; and now thou being
free of these things, keep thy self so.

And friend, here is a great talk of Religion and Ministry, and Profession and
Christianity, but if thou did but feel that which we feel and see, it would
grieve thy heart, so much pride and haughtiness, and loftiness amongst people,
and hard heartedness, that there is so many beggars, cripples, blind, lame men
and women and children on their knees, women lying with children in their lapps
up and down every corner, in the streets and high ways and Steeple, house
doors, throughout this great rich City, that never knew want, and do not know
many of them what to eat and drink and put on; now if these things enter into
thy ears, and tenderness strike thee, and thou consider, thou will feel it.

Now there has been a cry of the Jews hard-heartedness, that turned against
Christ; now friend consider, the Jews that took Tithes had a Storehouse to
put it in, and the Tenths were enough for to relieve the strangers, fatherless
and widows, that there need not be a beggar amongst them; Now I say, the
Tithes of this Nation would give strangers, fatherless and widows and Priests
enough both, if they had Storehouses to put it in, that there need not be a
beggar amongst them, as there was not amongst the Jews, but then you must own
Christ is not come in the flesh; for these Tithes were set up since the days
of the Apostles, for they preached them not up, but down, as Heb. 7. but they
have been preached up since the Apostasy, when all the want has been, and
before the Apostasy among the true Christians* there was no want among them,
every one had for his necessity; now look amongst all the Magistrates and
Ministry hear, and see how things are out of order, though there should be
never such true Laws given forth, yet putting them into such corrupt
Magistrates hands; they will never act them, but wrest them and pervert them
and turn them against the righteous, and by that the just suffers.

And friend, let none bear the office of Judge, Sheriff, Justice or Minister,
that's headdy, perverse and peevish, for such often slay themselves by their
envy, and it eats out the good in them, and they will be a burden to thee and
a grief both, thou living in the Power and Wisdom of God, the simplicity in
thee will be burdened as it is in us, and thou dealing in truth, it will stand
by thee, and answer the Principle of God in every man; for such causes many
poor men to go away with sorrow and grief.

And let no man bear office, whatsoever his office may be, that would have
honor before he have humility, for such will more mind honors below, earthly,
and favors of men, then Justice, and are out of Solomon's steps, who said,
before honor is humility.

And friend, take heed of giving Titles to men, nor do not learn to do it, but
mind Elihu that young man's counsel that spoke to Job that great rich man the
Judge, who said, if I give Titles to man, which he had not learned to give
Titles to men, his maker would soon take him away, as thou may est read Job 3d.
and the last.

And friend, it is a just thing for thee to make all those Ministers that have
cast into prison abundance of the servants of the Lord God, because they could
not put into their mouths that for which they did not work for, nor never
hired, and yet like ravenous Wolves cast them into prison, for bidding them
repent and fear God, and lay away their pride and their rings points, and
superfluities, and tell them of their costly apparel, wearing gold rings and
costly apparel, as said the Apostle, it was not the wearing of gold or costly
apparel, and such it may be for speaking to them have been cast into prison,
and for telling them they be out of the Doctrine of Christ; now to make all
these put them out of Prison again and all those Justices likewise as have cast
friends in prison for biding People fear God; it may be moved of God to cry
repentance through a Town, or reprove sin in the gate, they cast them into
prison as sturdy beggars, though men or women of sufficient estates; now this
gives an evil savor, now to make them put them out again, that will be for the
convincing of People, and be a sweet savor, and the bringing and showing the
wisdom of the Lord God to thee.

And friend, take heed of having any to compel another to maintain his meeting
house, or his Clark to say Amen, but that every one maintain his own meeting
house, and if he will have a Clark to say Amen, let him pay him his wages, and
every one if he will have a Minister, to maintain his Minister, for there is many
thousands in the Nations that they need not to say unto them know the Lord,
that has the Law of the Lord written in their hearts, and put in their minds,
and are come under his Government, and knows Christ to be their Teacher, and
hears him, as God said, This is my beloved Son hear ye him, and the Apostle
said to the Hebrews, God spoke to our Fathers by the Prophets and visions, but
now in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he has made heir
of all things, and upholdeth all things by the word of his power.

And friend, let no drunkard nor swearer or profane man keep Innes, Taverns or
Alehouses; but such as fears God, whose houses are wholesome to lodge travelers,
that no young nor old People may be nursed up in such idle places to act
wickedness, and to keep Games and sports, and things to play in their houses on
purpose for people to spend and pass away their time in vanity, now this is an
ill savor to a Christian life, and which is common in the Nations.

And friend, let none that is called a Minister that comes and creepes under
thee for maintenance, Tithes, and augmentations, let him first go plant, and
plough, and thresh, and get a flock, and then let him reap and eat, for that is
the Apostles counsel, take it to thy side; and then thou will not be cumbered
with Ministers, then thou will come to know the public service that belongs to
thy place, which is to do Justice.

And friend, let no officer whatsoever that is covetous after gifts or sums of
money, rewards or Bribes, let no man that is such bear office; for the gifts,
rewards and Bribes blindes his eye, and make him he cannot do Justice, for
because of such the helpless is not helped, and the jaws of the wicked is not
broken, and for that cause the Lord brings Judgment upon a Land; and men are
blinded with earthly honors, gifts, rewards and high places, and puffed up
with honors, and do not see it how the Lord brings Judgment upon them and
overturns them with his hand, and yet they take not notice who are crying
peace, peace, but sudden destruction comes upon them; so thy time is now,
consider as thou stands in the Wisdom of God, and lives in his fear, counsel
and dread, and feels his hand and arm, and stands in his Wisdom and power, thou will prosper and reign, but if any earthly honor blind thee, the Lord will
come upon thee when thou do not see it, and turn thee into the earth, which
the earthly honor comes to, and where God lays it down in the dust; but whose
honor is from him that's from above, and has his Wisdom and Power by which he
made all the creatures, they shall reign with the Lord God in his Power,
strength and arm.

And friend, take heed how thou let any perverse, peevish, cross, malicious
Justice or Magistrate whatsoever bear any office, that will not do Justice
except they have earthly honor, but are in strife and peevish against them
that cannot give it them, such Magistrates have left the Counsel of Solomon;
but its honor for men to do justice, and it will be an honor for thee to do
Justice, and see that Justice be done, and the greatest comfort in the world to
thee, in that thou will have peace with God everlastingly, and happiness for
ever, and his blessing, and know a world that has no end; so the Lord God
Almighty preserve thee in his Wisdom, Counsel and strength over the heads of
his enemies in thy self, and in the world both, that thou may come to live in
that which comprehends the world, which was before the world was made, in that,
and with that thou may come to order the creatures, by which Wisdom of God
they was made and created to his glory; And friend take heed of putting of
honest, godly men out of the Army, or putting them out of place, being
Justices, and such as fears God, in so doing thou will blame thy self, and
weaken thy Authority, and remove thy self out of the hearts of them that fears
God.

From a lover of thy soul and thy eternal good and establishing of
righteousness. G. F.
From the Church of Christ and Elect Assembly, called of the Lord and gathered
by his spirit, and redeemed by his Power from amongst men, and out of all the
many false Sects upon earth into fellowship with the Father, and with the Son,
to follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes, and we are named in scorn, and known
in the Nations by the name of Quakers.



To thee Richard Cromwell chosen to be Protector, and chief Magistrate Governor
of these Nations of England Scotland, and Ireland, a faithful presentation and
salutation by a servant of the Church.
WE are rightly and truly sencible in all things of the mighty hand of the Lord
God who brings all things to pass by his own Power, and according to his will,
and in heaven and earth, and over the Kingdoms of men he rules and Reigns,
he builds and breaks down, and planteth and plucketh up, and he pulls
down one and sets up another, and who may say what do thou? or why do
thou it? for he is a great God and a mighty, and his Majesty is terrible, and
all things in heaven and earth, and all the sons of men, are at his disposure,
whose dominion is from everlasting to everlasting, and he may be feared and had
in reverence by all creatures that has life and breath.

And in particular we are sencible of his great and mighty Power, who has of
late years in these Nations once and again overturned and overthrowed and
changed at his pleasure, times, and powers and Authorities, and Dominions, and
he has brought down the mighty from their seats, and stained the Crowns and
glories of the honorable, and broken the stout-hearted, and the oppressors and
their Governments, as potsheards one against another, and made the highest of
men of no respect before him; for he has pulled down and set up whom he would
according to his will, and in all these things has his hand been, the very
doer and accomplisher thereof, that he might be known and feared amongst all
People through the whole earth, who is the dread and terror of men and Nations.

And as for thy Father the late Protector, great things and honorable did the
Lord do for him, in raising him up and casting out his enemies before him; and
giving him victory and power and renown through Nations; and we know the Lord
showed favor to him, and gave him strength, wisdom, and valor, and a right
spirit; and he was called of God into that great work, to subdue the grievous
tyranies once ruling over tender consciences, and to break down the great
oppressions which for ages had caused the just to groan, and the Lord was with
him in victory and went before him, and was his defense and preserved him from
great dangers, and from the wills of all his enemies, and made him prosperous
against them all; but yet we know (to say no more of him) he did not wholly
fulfill the will of the Lord, nor* the work which he begun, but became
disobedient, and abused his great deliverances and Authority, and did not set
free the oppressed altogether, but left mountains of oppressions, and grievous
yokes of bondage unbroken down, and unsubdued; and the Lord smote him and took
him away in judgment because thereof.

And as for thee, who art now set up in his stead, we certainly believe that
the hand of the Lord is in this matter, if but to try thee, and it is he that
has brought it to pass, not expected by any, nor much sought after by thy
self; but its come to pass, a thing out of and contrary to the thoughts and
expectations of the whole Nations art thou attained to this place of
Government; and therefore we must acknowledge something of the great hand of
God in it, being come to pass as out of due season, yet may the Lord make it
seasonable, and we patiently wait to receive what the Lord brings to pass
thereby, knowing that thou art in the hand of the Lord to do whatsoever he will
with thee and concerning thee; and if thou fear him and walk with him, and
choose him for thy Counselor, and be obedient to him, and seek his glory
alone, and not thy own honor and greatness, then the Lord will do great things
for thee, and by thee, and accomplish his own work through thee, which fell in
thy Father hand, and thou will be blessed and renowned and honored for ever,
and thy name shall be had in respect in generations to come, and hereby the
present thoughts of many shall be confounded; but if thou do harden thy heart
against God, and live carelessly, and neglect his cause, and despise his Name
and honor, and seek thy own renown, and oppress the just in thee, and without
thee, and suffer the poor to groan under the cruelty and burden of oppressing
men and Laws in thy Government, without relief from thee, and go on in usurped
Authority, as some evil men before thee, then shall thou not prosper, but the
Lord shall bring thee down, and lay his hand of judgment upon thee, and thy
name shall be a reproach to the Saints for ever, and the heavy hand of
vengeance shall be upon thee, and pursue thee more then any before thee, and
the Lord will deliver his People by another way; and this is not in flattery
and fainedness to thee, but as the Lord lives, our God shall bring it to pass
in his day, and thou shall be the witness.

Wherefore O man, seek the face of the Lord, and inquire diligently of him, and
hear his word that thy soul may live, and feel a measure of his spirit in thee
to lead thee into all truth, and set his presence before thy eye always to
direct thy steps, that he may bless thee with Power, Wisdom, Authority and
Dominion, to perform the duty of thy place faithfully toward the Lord and all
men, as he requires of thee; and if thou first seek the Kingdom of God and its
righteousness, and the reconciliation between the Lord and thee, and come to
feel the Elect seed of God raised up over all the contrary in thee, and
transgression, and thy own will and affections, and that which is of the flesh
in thee judged and condemned by the word in the heart, which makes the immortal
soul to live and be refreshed in God, and the heir of the promise of God born
in thee, and hereby shall thou have an assurance and hope of life Eternal, to
rest in perfect peace with God, when this world is no more, but passed away
with thee, and also in this present time, wisdom and valor, and true Nobility
shall be added to thee, and the spirit of Power and Dominion to make men and
Nations be afraid and fear, and all evil men, and such as seeks the hurt of
thee and thy Government, shall be blasted and confounded, and all good men be
encouraged and made strong, and the whole Nations kept in peace and unity, and
the truth and peace of God shall hereby flourish amongst us, to the honor of
the eternal God, and to thy renown, if thou Rule and Govern for him, and by his
Spirit and Authority.

And we are truly sensible of the great charge of this place, and also of the
multitude of perplexities and dangers to thy self occurring and happening
thereby, dangers from open enemies by their malice and cruel plots, and dangers
from thy pretended friends, and they of thy own house by secret surmisings,
dangers in Martial and Civil affairs in this Nation and abroad, so that we
certainly, believe nothing save only the Wisdom of God and his Power can
preserve thee and carry thee to go through, and faithfully fulfill so great a
place, and to discharge it truly in the sight of God and just men, neither
may thou be defended and preserved by any other means, from the wills and
plots and envy of evil men, who may watch for evil against thee, to destroy
thee and blot out thy name, and thy fathers posterity out of the Land;
Wherefore take heed to thy self, and fear God, that he may bless thee, for this
is a subtle and crafty generation, and the Nations are politic, and the
Inhabitants thereof wise and deceitful over whom thou art set, and with whom
thou have to deal; Therefore beware of men, for many may seek after thy hurt,
and some may flatter thee, and show seeming great respect unto thee, and
profess great service of love to thee in the Nations and in thy Family for a
season, till their own ends of advantage be accomplished, and may in the very
time hatch evil against thee, and secretly invent to uncover thy nakedness and
betray thee, for many men are treacherous; but thou receiving a measure of the
Wisdom of God, it will guide thee over all such, and thou will see into the
hearts and spirits of men, and to discern between love unfeigned, which will
seek thy good and not self, and that love which is fained, which will flatter
thee and blind thy Judgment, and lead thee into snares, and such as will the
least flatter thee, will be the most true to thee; so beware, and let not vain
flatterers, and proud ambitious and ungodly, selfseeking men, nor drunkards,
nor covetous, nor politic and deceitful men and spirits have any place in thy
heart, nor in thy house, nor in places of authority and trust in thy
Government, for such men will be a snare unto thee, and a dishonor to thee,
and the cause of Gods wrath and curse against thy person, family and whole
Nations, for such men God will not bless, nor thee nor the Government for their
sakes, and this thou will find true one day; therefore choose unto thee such men
as fears God, who are just and humble, and uprighthearted, who are sincere and
faithful to the Lord, who has the Wisdom of God, and true nobility of spirit,
in righteousness and simplicity, free from the prophanness of this evil world,
let such be thy companions to wait upon thy person, and to Govern and Rule in
thy Family and Nations, and let such be put in trust, who will not be
treacherous, for such are blessed, and will be a blessing to thee and the whole
Government, and we know that the Lord gives respect and regard to the upright
that fears his Name, and such he will accomplish his work by, to thy renown,
and the peace and happiness of the Nations, more then to craft and policy, and
the wisdom and subtilty of this world, for thereby the Lord will never fulfill
his work, nor prosper a Ruler nor his people; and if thy strength and defense
be there, and not in the Lord and his pure Wisdom only, thou can not prosper,
but the Nations and men will overreach thee, and beguile thee, and thou cannot
be happy, nor thy Government be kept in peace, but a little measure of the fear
and power and wisdom of the Lord God from heaven in thy heart, and amongst such
as are thy Counselors, to guide you and Govern you, will be of more value and
worth unto thee in thy place and condition, then all worldly policy and wisdom
and craft, which with God is not regarded, nor of him ever blessed; and if thou
deny the Lord and righteous men, and choose thy own way and this worlds wisdom
that's from below, then thy trust and strength shall pierce thee and make thee
feeble, and of all others thy state will be the most miserable, if thou be
given into the policy and deceipts of treacherous men; so be wise and seek the
Lord, that he may be thy trust, and put not confidence in vain man, whose heart
is deceitful, and desperately wicked.

And as concerning the condition of these Nations, they are in a broken state,
much divided and diverse in Judgments, and far out of good order, for there is
much corruption and abuse in all orders and places of men, and much to be
purged out and Judged, both in Magistracy and Ministry, before righteousness,
peace and truth, union, joy and faithfulness, can embrace one another amongst
the Inhabitants of the Nations, for both are in a diversion and degeneration
from what they were at the first ordained of God, and this I could clearly
manifest unto thee, for the Nations are but newly come out of Popery, having
put off but part of the dress of that polluted Whore, and the garments of
professions in Religion, yet smell thereof, as not being thoroughly purged from
her abominable Idolatries and superstitions, as thou may see when the Lord
opens thy eye, to view the present state of all things.

As for Magistracy, it was ordained of God to be a dread and terror, and limit
to all evildoers, and to be a defense and praise to all that do well, to
condemn the guilty, and to justify the guiltless; but the exercise thereof at
this day inthese Nations is degenerated, and some that are in authority are
greatly corrupted, and regards not the Just and pure Law of God to Judge only
thereby, but oppresses the poor by injustice, and subverts the good Laws of
God and men to a wrong end and use, abusing Authority, and turning the sword
against the Just, whereby true Judgment is turned backward, and the innocent
made unjustly to suffer for righteousness sake, through the corruption of men
in Authority, and did thou but know what we know in this particular, it would
pierce thy heart; Why? It is frequent amongst some of the Judges and
Magistrates to commit a just man to prison, and impose some great fine up on
him, and to cast him into a dungeon or hole among thieves and murderers for a
long season, for no other offense or breach of any Law, but because he cannot
put off his hat to them, and respect their persons by bowing the hat or knee;
and many others that fears God, and for Conscience sake cannot swear upon a
book by kissing it and laying hand upon it, because Christ says, swear not at
all, though they deny not to do and speak the truth in all things, as in the
presence of God and all men; and many others, that because they are moved to
cry against sin, and declare against the iniquities of the times in Teachers,
Rulers and People, that highly abounds, perhaps in a Market, or Steeple-house,
or Highway, or other place, as they are moved of God; and many others because
for conscience sake they cannot pay Tithes nor give money and wages to a
maintain a Priest, or false Teacher that they receive no profit by, or to
maintain a steeplehouse, where the world worships in vain traditions, and not
in the spirit and power of God; and many have been taken out of peaceable
meetings where they were waiting upon the Lord, and some out of their Innes,
and friends houses, and many have been taken on the way, traveling about their
lawful occasions, and some from their callings, and labors, and for these
causes, through the envy of wicked men, and without any just conviction of the
breach of any Law, or any lawful trial, or examination, have hundreds of just
men being wholly innocent, been sent to prison and laid many Months, and some
for years, or whipped, and put in the stocks, and grievously abused by cruel
executioners of wicked men's envy and injustice, and upon such grounds only,
and for such causes mentioned, and without the transgression of any just Law
have and do at this day many hundreds of faithful subjects suffer hard and
cruel things, long and sore imprisonment, and cruel and sharp whipping, and
stocking, and unjust banishment out of Towns and Cities, yea, Friends its hard
to be expressed and large to be declared how many of the Lords servants, do and
have suffered great injustice in these Nations, through the abuse of good
Government, and degeneration of Magistracy from its perfect state and place
whereunto it was ordained of God in the beginning; and moreover, great have
been the abuses, by stricking, and beating and halling, and kickings, and
revilings, and reproaching, whereby many have suffered unrighteously, and not
relieved nor defended by such in Authority as ought to have done it, neither
the evil doers at all corrected and punished as ought to have been, though
known to men in power, and thus it is happened to us in our age, well doers are
punished as transgressors, and evil doers go free, and thus its manifest,
Magistracy and Government, Rulers and Laws are greatly degenerated and
subverted from what they ought to be according as the Lord ordained them; for
all this may be proved particularly, so that the Nations are out of good order,
and the State of Government and Rule degenerated, and men in Authority and
places of trust corrupted, not being in their own hearts ruled by the spirit of
the Lord, and therefore they cannot rule for him among men, justly, and
righteously, as the Lord requires; and also so great has been the degeneration
in Government in these Nations of late years, that many faithful and just men
that have been in great places of trust, both in Martial and civil affairs,
through the envy, and evil surmising of others, have been turned out of all
place and Power, and not suffered to give their judgment amongst men, but been
cast off as unprofitable, though no evil could be charged against them, whereby
the Lord has been offended; but all things and places of men must be new
molded and corrected, and purged, and regenerated, that true judgment may
flourish, and righteousness and truth prosper, as in the beginning, and this
will the Lord suddenly bring to pass by his own Power; and if thou oppose it,
thou shall not prosper, but be cut off, and taken out of the way; For the
spirit of the Lord has been provoked to wrath because of these things, and his
anger is kindled against the Nations, and he has overthrown and will once more
overthrow till he come whose right it is to Rule, whose shall be the Government
and Kingdoms, and all his enemies shall be slain.

And as for the public Ministry as now it is in its present Estate, we
certainly know and testify from the Lord unto thee, and to the whole Nations,
that it is not the same Ministry of Christ which the Apostles had, nor by the
same power and spirit, but is wholly degenerated, in Call, in practice, and in
maintenance, and in all things from what the Ministry of Christ was in the
days of the true Churches, before the Apostasy; and it is as now it stands in
degeneration, not of God, nor in the power and spirit of Christ Jesus, nor has
it the same end and effects as the Ministry of Christ once had, but its tasted,
and tainted with the spirit of Antichrist, which long has ruled in the world,
and its become a grievous oppression in the Nations, and people are not
converted nor turned to God from their evil ways, but remains unprofited; and
to say no more of it, though much I might say, what I affirm of it I may prove
by the Scriptures against the wisest of them before thee if thou please, viz.
That as now the Ministry stands, it is not perfectly the same Ministry the
Apostles had, but is degenerated from what the Ministry of Christ was in the
days of the Apostles, and true Churches, before the Apostasy, and if ever God
touch thy heart thou will see it so, when the Spirit of Christ is chief Judge
in thee, thou will witness this to be true; and then may not thy power uphold
any thing which is contrary to God, when Government is purged and made pure
from all its present degeneration.

Again, there are many and diverse sorts of Sects, and gatherings of People, and
Professions in Religion of several contrary Judgments and opinions, and
worships in these Nations, and these People over whom thou art set to Rule are
diverse, and divided in their ways and minds, and Professions of Religion, some
looking for, and seeking after Christ, in such a manner, and others after
another manner, all crying lo here is Christ, and thus he will come, and lo
he is there, and so will he appear, and some are inventing, and supposing such
a Government the best, and others contrary to that, and many are (as)
distracted in their thoughts, not knowing what to seek, or what to look after;
some are for such a Government, and Religion, and others for another, and
peradventure each one of all these may seek to thee for protection against such
as opposes them, commending and justifying their own way, and Sect, and Form,
and Religion, against all others, and craving Laws to maintain themselves, and
their Sect, and to stop and limit all other ways as Heresy, because differing
from them, and they will each of them turn and wrest the Scriptures, from the
mind of the spirit that gave them forth, to prove their own opinions and
Professions to be right against all others, but now thou may know that the
Scriptures were given forth by the one Spirit of God, and is the testimony of
one truth, of one favor, of one true worship, and one only true Religion, and
not many, and diverse ways, and them that are of diverse judgments and
worships, and Religions, and yet all pleads proof from the Scriptures for what
they Profess and practice; all such perverts the Scriptures, and wrests them,
who are thus divided and unsettled in Religion, and they show that none of them
has the spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, which spirit leads into all
truth, and in it is the true worship of God, and the true Profession and
practice of true Religion, and that spirit only understands its own words in
Scripture, but all these diverse Sects and heaps of People that are divided in
worship, and about Religion, has not the Spirit of God that gave forth
Scriptures to lead them into all truth* and guide them in the perfect way and
pure Religion which the Apostles and Churches of Christ were in in their days;
but all these many Sects that are thus divided are risen up since the days of
the Apostles, and are of another spirit, and of a false Religion; and as for
such called Ministers, they will be hurrying about thee, and flattering thee
with fair and crafty words, and smooth Petitions, and requests for protection
and establishment from thee, and for large maintenance, and stipends and
Tithes; And possibly they may complain to thee against such as cannot give them
hire, and Tithes, but may reprove their evil and covetousness, and wickedness,
Begging for Laws against such, and crying out against Error and Herefie,
because some may be moved to cry against their deceits and oppressions, and for
the like causes they will run about thee, and seck their own advantage, and
this we know their nature and spirit is such; and has been for many ages.

But now friend, do thou stand in Gods Authority, out of, and over all such
Teachers and Sects, and come not under any of them that have the form of
godliness but want the Power, who are in the Apostasy, from the life and pure
Religion that the Apostles were in, nor believe them not that shall say, lo
Christ is here, or lo he is there; or who shall Ascend to fetch him from
without, or when shall he come from far to save his People? go not thou after
any of all these, but hearken to the word of God in thy heart, and know that
Christ is within thee, else thou art reprobate, neither do thou take in hand to
exalt any one of these Sects, or some of them above others, neither defend and
maintain any of them against others of them, nor tolerate not one of them
above another, for if thou do, it will betray thee and the Nations Peace, and
set all spirits on fire about thee, and while one is pleased and may pray for
thee, others will be vexed against thee and curse thee; wherefore be not
troubled about these things, nor cumber not thy self about Religion how to
establish it for it is in Gods hand only to establish his worship and
Religion, it belongs to him, as he will, and not as man by his policy and
wisdom; but stand free from them all, and neither establish any, nor persecute
any Sect whatsoever, but let them all have their course and season, they will
fall and perish of themselves, and the good old way, and truth, and the pure
Religion only will remain, and let them cry one against another,; and rebuke
one another, and meddle not thou with that, but only let thy Laws and
Authority preserve men's persons and estates, from the wrong one of another,
that all men may live peaceably under thee, and no man wrong his neighbors
person or estate; and that's only thy place to rule in outward affairs, but not
to rule over any man's conscience, to compel him to such a worship, or to limit
from such a worship in Religion, that belongs not to thee, but to the Lord, who
alone will be the Ruler and guide and exerciser of his peoples consciences, and
if thou do meddle therein, thou shall not prosper, nor be blessed in thy deed;
so leave the establishing of Religion to the Lord, and let all these Sects
manifest if any of them have the spirit and Power of God in them, and with
them, and let them show their weapons of the spirit, for only such as has the
power and Spirit of God in them will overcome, and such will be increased and
grow, and thou nor none can hinder, and such that wants the Power and Spirit of
God, in and with them, may flourish in their form for a while, but they will be
blasted and wither, and it is vain for thee or any to uphold such, or endeavor
to establish them, but if thou meddle on these accounts, it will undo thee, and
confound thee; therefore be wise, and know what the Lord requires of thee
perfectly, for if thou leave that undone which God requires, then shall thou be
condemned, and if thou do that which he requires not, then shall thou not be
free; and this is written in love to thee, to inform thy mind, how to walk
toward the Lord, and the people over whom he has set thee; and as for the
maintaining of Ministers, let that aloue also, and be not troubled about it,
for it was ever the false prophets and deceivers that preached for hire, and
went after gifts and rewards, and sought money and gifts of people, and they
that do the same now were never sent of God, nor are they such as shall convert
people to God; for who are true Ministers of Christ, will not seek to thee nor
to men for wages, and Tithes, and money, but live of the Gospel, and not compel
great sums of money from people to maintain them in their families in pride, in
fullness and idleness, such things are great oppressions in this Nation, and a
horrible filthy thing in the sight of God, and because thereof will the Lords
Judgments come upon the land; if thou were but rightly sensible what casting
into Goals, and what suing at Law of poor people, and what spoiling peoples
goods by destraint, and all for and about Tithes and Priests wages, it would
make thee admire the wickedness of that generation; but do thou let them alone,
for they do shame themselves, and undo themselves, and loose the hearts of all
good people by their own doings, and stand over them all in Gods Authority, and
know a measure of the Spirit of God in thy own heart, and thereby thou will
discern and try and judge of the spirits of all men, and their religion, and
the Spirit will lead thee in the pure Religion, to worship God in Spirit and in
truth, so let not thy mind be cumbered at all about establishing Religion, nor
about maintaining the Ministers, but be faithful to what the Lord requires of
thee, and learn his will, and do it, and then thou will be blessed and honored
in this world, and in the world to come.

And friend, know thou that the Lord is doing of a great work in these Nations,
he is raising up a seed to serve him and to worship him aright, and the God of
heaven is setting up a Kingdom over the kingdoms of the world, and he has a
controversy with all sorts of people, in as much as corruption and degeneration
is entered amongst all, and all must be purged of all orders of men, and the
evil cast out, the work of the Lord is great and mighty, and he requires no
help from thee, nor any man whatsoever, for his own arm will bring it to pass,
yet he would not have thee to gainsay his work, and strive against it, and
seek to quench what the Lord is bringing forth, if thou do it, then shall thou
be condemned, and the Lord will speedily execute his Judgments, and remove
thee, and overthrow thy power and authority into destruction; wherefore be
passive in this matter, and look thou at the Lord, and protect and desend men's
persons and estates from wrong, but meddle not with their opinions and
professions in Religions, to exalt any of them, nor yet to persecute them; And
as concerning the Armies abroad, let faithful and just men that will not seek
themselves be put in trust, for the Army is of great concernment to thee, to
stand or fall through them as to man's account, and the war against Spain be
faithful to God in it, and let trusty men have authority, the Lord may
accomplish something by it to his honor and to thine, if thou be meek and
humble, and walk with the Lord; and to say no more about it, there is something
in it known to the Lord, and he may bring it to pass in his season.

And thus Friend, according as it lay upon me from the Lord, I have written
this unto thee in dear and pure love, God is witness, and I have cleared my
conscience to thee thus far, and if thou fall by thy own transgression, it will
lie upon thy self, I have warned thee, and I am clear; and if thy fall comes,
remember thou wast advised.

Who am a lover of Justice and true Judgment, and a Friend of this
Commonwealth, and to thee wishes well in the Lord, EDW. BOROUGH.
