CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, for prevention of ill consequences which may
ensue by the frequent resort and abode of Disbanded Officers and Soldiers of
the late Army in and about the Cities of London and Westminster, the Suburbs

Privy Council) to renew and continue His former Proclamations in this behalf:
And does by this His Royal Proclamation Publish and Declare, and also straightly
Charge and Command, That all and every person and persons having been
heretofore an Officer Soldier serving in any the Armies of the late Usurped
Powers, and have been Disbanded, Cashiered or turned out of the same, who are
not under Imprisonment, or other legal Restraint, or have not their constant
Habitations and Families within the Cities of London and Westminster, or the
Suburbs thereof, or who cannot procure or obtain a License from His Majesty,
the Lord General, or One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, or
any Three or more of His Privy Council in that behalf, do on or before the
Twentieth day of this instant November, depart out of the said Cities of London
and Westminster, and the Liberties and Suburbs, and not return again, or come
within Twenty miles of the same Cities of London and Westminster, or either of
them, until after the Twentieth of May next ensuing: And that they or any of
them do not, nor shall not in the mean time wear, use, carry, or ride with any
Sword, Pistol, or other Arms or Weapons; And herein His Majesty does expect
from all persons concerned, a due and punctual submission and conformity, at
their perils, upon pain of His high displeasure. Willing and hereby commanding
the Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of the Peace, Constables, and
other Officers and Ministers of and in the several Counties, Cities, and places
of this Kingdom, and Dominion of Wales, to apprehend and seize the persons, and
take away the Arms and Weapons of all such as shall be found faulty, or
offenders in, or contrary to the purport, true intent and meaning of this His
Majesty's Royal Proclamation, and them to send to the Goal of the City or
County where they are apprehended, sending the Lords of His Majesty's Privy
Council a Note of their Names, and of their particular Offenses, that so they
may be proceeded against for their contempts, according to Justice.
