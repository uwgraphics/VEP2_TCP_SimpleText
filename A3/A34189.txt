LONDON, Printed and Sold by J. Moxon at the Atlas in Warwick Lane, 1697.

TO THE Royal Society.
Gentlemen,
I Have made a trial how some few thoughts, relating to the common concerns of
the World, would look in a Geometrical Dress, and take the boldness to present
them to your Honorable Society. I know your readiness to Encourage all
endeavors after useful Knowledge, and therefore presume you will show some
little favor to this attempt of mine, it may be, so far as to recommend it as
a hint to others of a more happy Genius, to prosecute this Argument, or also a
nobler Subject upon such sort of Principles as these, I have no excuse to make
for the meanness of my performance, but that I know not that this was ever
aimed at by any Man till now, by

Your most Humble Servant.

DEFINITIONS.
1 Def. BY time or the Age of a Man, I desire may be understood all that part
of a Man's Life, which he can employ as he himself judges convenient, and
therefore, after he is come to the use of Reason.

2 Def. By a Man's Estate, I understand all the Wealth and Riches, which in the
time of his Reason he is Master of, and has at his own disposal; whether it be
by the kindness of his Relations, or the Fruits of his own Industry.

3 Def. By Happiness, I understand all the Ease, and Satisfaction, and
Pleasures which a Man can procure by his Estate, and which do not come upon him
without his own choice and forecast.

4 Def. By Wisdom, I understand a Sk^^ and Resolution to procure all the
Happines^ which is procurable by such a Man.

5 Def. By a Fool, I understand one wh^ either does not know how, or does not
resolve to procure all the Happiness which i^ procurable by him.

6 Def. By Pleasures, I mean all sorts of innocent Diversions, Conversation,
Balls, Plays, Drinking, Gaming, Hunting, Hawking, and the like; according to
Men's different Fancies and Inclinations.

POSTULATA.
1 Post. THat in order to the making a better Comparison between things, it may
be allowed us to fix upon some determinate number of Years, and to call that
the apparent Age or Time of a Man.

2 Post. That upon the same Account, it may be allowed us to fix upon a
determinate sum of Money, and to call that, the apparent Estate of a Man.

3 Post. That it may be allowed us to subduct from the apparent Time, and from
the apparent Estate of a Man, all those parts of his Age and Wealth which are
not at his own disposal.

4 Post. That the value of time may be expressed by a proportionable value in
Money.

5 Post. That it may be allowed us to assign different pleasures and
satisfactions to the different Stages and Periods of a Man's life, and till a
truer and more particular and exact one be offered, to make use of this
following Scheme.

All School-learning, Grammar, Arithmetic, Writing, etc. 1 Part from 9 to 16
All sorts of Academical Learning, Travels, and Pleasures, and Exercises
suitable to that period. 2 P. from 16 to 25 Recreations, Courtships and
Pleasures suitable. 3 P. from 25 to 36 Honors, Preferments and Pleasures
suitable. 4 P. from 36 to 49 Increasing of Riches, Power and Interest, and
pleasures suitable. 5 P. from 49 to 64

AXIOMS.
1 Ax. Time is as necessary to enjoy Happiness in, as an Estate is necessary to
procure it.

2 Ax. The same proportion that the whole Happiness of a Man's Life bears to
his whole Time and Estate, the same proportion do the distinct parts of his
Happiness bear to proportionable parts of his Time and Estate.

3 Ax. Happiness is worth as much Time, and as much Money, as are absolutely
necessary to procure and to enjoy it.

Proposition 1. If a Man do live from his Birth to the end of 64 Years, that
is, has 64 apparent years, his real time or true age is but 32 years.

Demonstration. Such a Man's time (by the 1st Definition) is only that part of
his Life which he can employ as he himself judges most convenient after he is
come to the use of Reason, and therefore (by the 3d Postulat.) I make these
following subductions.

Y. M. D. H. He is to live. 64 00 00 00 Subducted out of it, viz. 1 For
Childhood, before he begins to use his Reason to any purpose. 64 00 00 00 2.
For Sleep, at the rate of 8 hours in 24, because he cannot employ it at he
pleases in the purchase and enjoyments of satisfaction. 09 00 00 00 3. For
Devotion, reckoning that as God's time. 18 04 00 00 4. For Sickness, such as
disables him from taking satisfaction in the things of the World at least. 03
06 00 00 The whole sum of the Deductions. 01 02 00 00 The Remainder therefore
which is the Man's time, is 32 00 0 0 Which was to be Demonstrated. 32 00 0 0

Pro. 2. If such a Man has an Estate of Inheritance of 120 l. per Ann. his
whole real Estate is 4940 l. Sterling.

Demonstra. By the 2d Definition, his true Estate is only so much of his
Wealth, as in the time of his reason he has at his own disposal, and therefore
(by the 3d Postulat.) I make the following subductions.

The whole sum arising from 120 l. per Ann. during the 64 years, without
interest or any other improvements amounts to. l. s. d. Subducted out of it,
viz. 7680 00 00 1. For the 9 years of Childhood. 1080 00 00 2. For Charity
being God's and the poors Money, and public Taxes being the Magistrates and
his Countries Money 1/100 660 00 00 3. For unavoidable expenses in Sickness.
0100 00 00 4. For Food and Lodging just necessary. 0480 00 00 5. For Clothes.
0420 00 00 The whole sum of the Deductions ^740 00 00 Taken out of ^680 00 00
The Remainder is. 4940 00 00 Which is his real Estate Which was to be
Demonstrated.

Prop. 3. The whole Happiness of such a Man's Life is worth 32 Years and 4940 l.

Demonstra. By the 3d Definition, the whole Happiness of Man's Life is all the
Ease, and Pleasure, and Satisfactions which he can procure by his Estate,
during the whole time of his life. But by the 1st Proposi. the time of such a
Man's life is 32 Years, and by the 2d Prop. his Estate is 4940 l. and by the 3d
Axiom, Happiness is worth as much time, and as much Money as are absolutely
necessary to procure and to enjoin it; therefore the whole Happiness of such a
Man's Life is worth 32 Years and 4940 l.

Which was to be Demonstrated.

Prop. 4. Such a Man is wise if he does know how, and resolves to procure as
much happiness as is worth 32 Years and 4940 l.

Demonstra. By the 4th Definition, Wisdom is a Skill and Resolution to procure
all the Happiness which a Man can procure. But by the 3d Prop. all the
Happiness of such a Man's life is worth 32 Years and 4940 l. therefore such a
Man is wise if he knows how and resolves to procure as much Happiness as is
worth 32 Years and 4940 l.

Which was to be Demonstrated.

Prop. 5. Such a Man is a Fool, if he does not know and resolve to procure as
much Happiness as is worth 32 Years and 4940 l.

Demonstra. By the 5th Definition, that Man is a Fool who does not know and
resolve to procure all the Happiness which is procurable by him; but by the 3d
Prop. all the Happiness procurable by such a Man is worth 32 Years and 4940 l.
therefore such a Man is a Fool, if he does not know and resolve to procure as
much Happiness as is worth 32 Years and 4940 l.

Which was to be Demonstrated.

Corollary. Hence it follows that such a Man is a Fool, if he lays out upon any
particular and determinate part of the Happiness of his whole life, more of his
32 Years and 4940, than that part of his Happiness has proportion to his whole
Happiness; for, by the 2d Axiom, the same proportion that the whole Happiness
of Man's life does bear to his whole Time and Estate, the same proportion do
the distinct parts of his Happiness bear to proportionable parts of his Time
and Estate. Since therefore he is a Fool if he does not know and resolve to
procure as much Happiness as is worth 32 Years and 4940 l. he must be a Fool if
he gives more of his 32 Years and 4940 l. for any part of Happiness, than that
proportion which that part of Happiness bears to the Happiness of his whole
life; Ergo, he is a Fool that lives fast. (Quod saepious probatum est) which
two faults we usually term, living fast, and Prodigality.

Prop. 6. Such a Man is more wise as he comes nearer the procuring as much
Happiness as is worth 32 Years and 4940 l. and the more a Fool as he comes
shorter of procuring of it.

Demonstra. This follows clearly from the 4th and 5th Propositions.

Problem. 1. How to express the value of such a Man's time in Money.

By the 4th Postulation, The value of Time may be expressed by a proportionable
value in Money; therefore since by the 1st Prop. the whole time of such a Man
is 32 Years, and by the 2d Prop. his whole Estate is 4940 l. it will follow
that.

l. s. d. q. 1. One of his Years is worth Sterling. 154 07 06 00 2. One Month. 12
17 03 01 3. One Day. 00 08 05 01 4. One Hour about. 00 00 04 0 5. One Minute.

The Table is made according to this Proportion.

As the whole time between the beginning of the 2d Period, and the end of his
Life, viz. 55 Years is to his Time, viz. 32 Years; so is one Year to 212 days
of his real time, and the value 89 l. 16 s. etc.

Lemma.

That in the following Propositions, allowances must be made for the different
Inclinations and fancies of Men and expectations in the World. But what is laid
down determinately, may now pass for a good general mean.

Prop. 7. Such a Man is a Fool, if he lay out upon what Happiness may be
included within the first period above 4 years and 26 days 13 hours of his
time, and 628 l. 16 s. 6 d. of his Money.

Demonstra. By the Coral. from the 5th Prop. such a Man is a fool if he lays
out upon any particular and determinate part of the Happiness of his whole
life, more of his 32 years and 4940 l. than that part of his Happiness has
proportion to his whole Happiness. But by the Scheme in the 5th Postula. it
appears, that the Happiness of the first period is answerable to 7 common
years, and this amounts to 4 years and 26 days 13 hours of his time, and 628 l.
16 s. 6 d. of his Money; there fore such a Man is a fool if he lay out upon the
1st period, above 4 years and 26 days and 12 hours of his time, and above 628
l. 17 s. 6 s. of his Money. Which was to be Demonst.

Prop. 8. Such a Man is a fool if he lays out upon the Happiness of the 2d
period above 5 years and 86 days 7 hours of his time, and 808 l. 09 s. 9 d. of
his Money.

The Demonstration is the same as of the 7th Prop.

Prop. 9. Or if he lays out upon the Happiness of the 3d period, above 6 Years
and 146 days 8 hours of his time, and above 988 l. 03 s. 01 d. of his Money.

The Demonstration is the same as that of the 7th Prop.

Prop. 10. Or if he lays our upon Honors, Preferments and Pleasures, suitable
to the 4th period above 7 years and 206 days 2 hours of his time, and above
1167 l. 16 s. 4 d. of his Money. The same way Demonstrated.

Prop. 11. Or if upon the Happiness of the 5th and last period above 8 years
and 265 days 21 hours of his time, and above 1347 l. 09 s. 8 d. of his Money.
The same Demonstration

Problem 2. How to express the real value of an acquired Estate.

If such a Man by that time he is 30 years of Age, having discharged all former
Debts and Encumbrances, has by his labor acquired just 120 l. per Ann. and is
to live to 64, his Estate is 2245 l. 08 s. 0 d.

For 120 l. per Ann. the other 34 Years amounts to. l. s. d. Out of which (as
Prop. 2.) must be subducted. 4080 00 00 1. For Charity. 408 00 00 2. For
Sickness about. 172 00 00 3. Food and Lodging. 292 00 00 4. For Clothes. 252 00
00 5. For the value of his time between the 9th and 30th Year of his Age,
supposing that by the labor, to acquire that Estate 6 Hours every day came to
be not at his own disposal, by the 1st Problem about. 810 12 00 The sum of
which Deduction. 1834 12 00 Taken out of. 4080 00 00 The Remainder. 2245 08 00
Hence appears the true difference between an acquired Estate, and an Estate of
Inheritance, the time spent in acquiring it, being converted into Money, in the
above case being. 810 12 00

Problem 3. To apply the foregoing Propositions to particular uses, and for
instance, by this method to find out the real value of an Horse.

We proceed by these Degrees.

1. We set down the Man's Age who is to buy it, suppose 33.

2. The Period which it falls in here it is the 3d.

3. The remainder of the Money which the Man has to spend in the remainder of
the period, which is thus found.

By the 5th Postulation, the common years of the 3d Period are 11, and by the
9th Prop. the Money to be spent in those 11 Years is 988; therefore since 8
years of the 11 are now supposed to be past, valued at 718 l. 6/11 not
troubling our selves with the Fractions; we subduuct the Money already spent,
viz. the 718 l. out of 988 l. the whole, and the remainder will be 270 l. which
is the sum that is at his disposal in those 3 years.

4. Suppose an indifferent Horse, and the Market Rate to be 10 l.

5. Suppose him (bating Accidents) to be serviceable 10 Years.

6. Suppose the yearly charge of keeping him to be at least 5 l. and so the
Money to be laid out upon him will be 60.

7. That the Pleasure, Profit, or Service which that Horse must do such a Man,
that he may be no loser by him, must be worth of such a Man's Money 60 l. in 10
years, (that is 6 l. per Ann.) and so for the 3 years of the period which the
Man is then in, he must be worth 18 l. of his Money (for 10 y. 60 l. 3 y. 18
l.) and in the period he must be worth 42 l. being the remainder, and therefore.

8. The Man must consider what occasion he has for 270 l. in those 3 years, and
whether he can wisely allow 18 l. being 1/15 of the value of the Happiness of
the 3 years for it; and whether he may allow it or no, he may find by the
Corollary of the 5th Proposition.

If he finds that he must not allow so much, then by making subductions for
what remains to be subducted, after taking out 14/15 from 270 l. the remainder
will be the exact sum which he may afford for the Horse, and that will be to
him the real value of it.

That is to say, If he finds, for instance, that besides 252 l. which is 14/15
of 270 l. he shall have occasion to lay out 10 l. upon other things; let him
subduct the 262 l. from 270 l. and the remainder being 8 l. will be the real
value of the Horse, after the same manner the value of a Servant, Book,
Garment, Watch, etc. may be found out.

Est aliquid prodire tenus.

Note, That Errata's in the Calculation, may be easily mended by the Reader in
observing the inferences of the Reasonings.
