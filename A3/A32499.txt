BY THE KING.
A Proclamation of His Majesty's Grace, Favor, and Pardon to the Inhabitants
of His County of Hertford.
WHEREAS We have taken notice, that by the Malice, Industry, and Importunity of
several ill-affected and seditious Persons in Our County of Hertford, very
many of Our weak and seduced Subjects in that Our County have not only been
drawn to exercise the Militia, under color of a pretended Ordinance, without
and against Our Consent, (a Crime of a very high nature, if We would strictly
enquire thereinto) but have made Contributions of Plate, Money, and Horses,
toward the Maintenance of the Army now in Rebellion against Us; We do hereby
publish and declare, That We are graciously pleased to attribute the Crimes and
Offenses of Our said Subjects of that County, to the Power and Faction of their
Seducers; Who, We believe, by Threats, Menaces, and false Informations
compelled and led them into these Actions of undutifullnesse and disloyalty
toward Us; And We do therefore hereby offer Our free and gracious Pardon to
all the Inhabitants of Our said County of Hertford, for all offenses concerning
the Premises committed against Us, before the publishing of this Our
Proclamation, except such persons only as are already in prison for any of
those offenses. Provided, that this Our Grace shall not extend to any Person,
who after the publishing this Our Proclamation shall presume by Loan or
Contribution, to assist the said Army of Rebels, to assemble and muster
themselves in Arms without Authority derived from Us under Our Hand, to enter
into any Oath of Association for opposing Us and Our Army, or to succor, or
entertain any of the Persons excepted in Our Declaration of the 12th of
August. But We must and do declare, That whosoever shall henceforward be
guilty of the Premises, or of either of them, shall be esteemed by Us as an
Enemy to the public Peace, a Person disaffected to Us, and to the Religion and
Laws of the Kingdom, and shall accordingly receive condign punishment, of
which We give them timely notice, that they may proceed accordingly at their
perils. And We do hereby will and require Our high Sheriff, Commissioners
of Array, Justices of the Peace, and all other Our Officers, and loving
Subjects to resist, oppose, and apprehend all such Persons as shall presume to
make any Leavies in that Our County, under what pretense soever, without
Authority derived from Us under Our Hand. And We likewise will and require
them, and every of them to be assistant to all such as shall either Command the
Traine-Bands of that Our County, or make any Leavies in the same by virtue of
Commission under Our Great Seal, or Sign Manual.

Given at Our Court at Oxford, the seventh day of January, in the Eighteenth
year of Our Reign.
