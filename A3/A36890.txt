A Few Words of Truth FROM THE Spirit of Truth To all who are Convinced of the
Truth, and stand in Opposition to the Cross. By one who remained in that Estate
above Seven years, before he was brought to the True Obedience of Truth: and
was whipped to it by the Merciful Rod of the Lord; for no less could do it.
Also a few words to all the Litteral Professors, who can Own the Ministration
of Christ Without them, but Deny him Within them. And to those that have their
Dependence upon the Teachings of Men, in Opposition to the Ministration of the
Spirit Within. Together with a short Discovery of the Presbyterian Government;
and some Reasons of Dissenting from it.

A Few Words of Truth FROM THE Spirit of Truth To all who are Convinced of the
Truth, and stand in Opposition to the Cross.
FRIENDS,
IT is from a deep Sense of a clear and through Exerience that I am moved to
lay before you, having fresh in my Thoughts your Conditions; for upon that
Ground did I set up my Tent for many years, and was most unwilling to remove
it, till the Lord by Fire and Sword did pursue me, and did turuble me out of
all my False Rests; and whilst I was settling upon my Lees, he poured me from
Vessel to Vessel, where I never had a settled Peace nor Comfort, till the Lord
settled the Ark of my Soul upon the Mountains of Ararat; then I did see all the
World (I mean those of that spirit) lying as so many Dead Corpse, swimming upon
the Waters; and then my Soul was refreshed with the Sense of God's Love, who
had pulled me like a Brand out of the Fire, who was walking from Hill to
Mountain, and running after the Lo here, and Lo there, and seeking the Living
amongst the Dead, and the Pearl abroad, that was lying hid within my own
Breast; I was feeding upon Husks, and the Inventions of Man, seeking the Law
from his Mouth, and treading upon the Light which was within, which shined in
Darkness, but Darkness could no comprehend it; and thus did I live in the Night
of Darkness: but that it was a Day of Love that the Lord visited me from on
high, when I was wallowing in my Blood, with my Navil-string uncut, nor salted;
and notwithstanding the setting of my Feet in Opposition to the Light, after so
many years Conviction, and that I had gone near to sin out my Day, and that
before the Candle of the Lord was put out in my spirit, he did of Mercy shine
upon me; and though late I coming to the Vineyard to work, he gave me the Wages
of those that came first. O the Unexpressible Love of a Merciful, Loving,
Tender and Long-Suffering God; which did not cut the Thread of my Life betwixt
the Conviction and being brought to the Obedience of the Truth; it was only the
Free Love and Mercy of the Lord that preserved me, and the more that I ponder
it the deeper sense I have of it, even to the bowing of me down, so that I had
no Peace till that I should make my Condition known to those who are where I
was; and that I may be set up as a Beac^n to those who are traveling
Sion-ward, lest that they split upon the same Rocks, Shelves and Sands, from
which the Lord has very narrowly delivered and brought me into the s^fe
Harbor, where my Anchor is cast, within the Vail; and now being come to my
Rest, it is the more with me to show to others the Pilgrimage of my Warfare,
which is thus.

It was the Lord's Free Grace
That brought me to this Port;
For elsewhere I found no Place
My Soul for to Support.
Whilst I was in my young and tender years, I was brought up in a Family, and
Families, where the Lord was Worshipped according to the Worship of that Nation
of Scotland; but as I grew more in years the Lord was pleased to give me more
and more the Light of his Presence, and did offer me more plenty of his Grace
then I was willing to receive; and if I had gone any further then the Form of
the National Church (so called) did allow, I was counted a Sectary, and so
disowned; and my looking one Step further then their public Faith did allow
should become a Brand of Schism and Heresy, notwithstanding as to their Law I
was as strict a Pharisee as many of my Equals, and brought up at the Feet of
Gamaliel: For, since I entered into the Covenant with that People, I came to
see a little clearer, and that the Covenant did tie so my Conscience to their
Form of Presbytery, my spirit did begin to fail me in the thing; and when there
was an Order from the General Assembly, For all the Nation to take the Covenant
the second time, in that Interim the Lord had cleared the Fogs and Mists,
partly by opening the Eyes of my Understanding, so that I Refused to take the
Covenant the second time upon the Day appointed for that End, which was to be
done upon a First Day, called Sunday. A dear Friend of mine (whose Name I will
omit, because now removed by Death; one whom I believe laid down the Body
Convinced of the Truth; for a little before his Death he said to an eminent
Friend of Truth at his own House, when some were slighting the Quakers, he
said, That he wished all the Nation were Quakers) This Friend, I say, and I went
from the place where we were expected to take the Covenant that day, to hear a
Countryman preach by Orders publicly at the Town of Linlithg^w, one who was
never at Schools nor Colleges, nor knew no Language^ but his Mother Tongue;
and as himself said to me, he was brought up a Herdsman, with keeping of Sheep
at home, which was a rare thing in the Nation of Scotland in these times; and
they were come one step nearer to the Quakers Principles, especially having
discharged the wearing of Ribbands: and if they had continued Faithful to the
Measure they had received then, and not run retrograde, they had not so much
stood in opposition to them now: But as I have said, We going to eschew the
Covenant-taking, to hear the Preacher, who was called from his Sheep-keeping to
Preach, we escaped the taking of the Covenant the second time.

This was like the Covenant of old,
That could not all perform;
So neither could we live as we would
In Things that are enorm.
Yet not so, but that I was taken notice of; and when I came to receive the
Sacrament (so called) at the preparation, the day before it, in the Queen's
Ferry, the Minister (so called) of that Town, told me, That I must not come to
morrow to their Sacrament, except that I would take the Covenant; which I
refused to do, nor never did after the first time: And that same Person with
several others of that Denomination, seeing me to look further then their
public Faith did allow me, did labor to keep me still under Bondage to their
Ecclesiastical Law, seeing me not matter much the hearing of them; for I having
in measure entered the Promised Land, their Manna became loathsome to me; and
they Expostulated so with me, Why I did not frequent their Assemblies so much
as formerly? I told them, That there was a Thing beyond that, which I looked
for: To which they replied, That I must take heed to that, for that was a
Sectarian and Dangerous Principle: And I told them plainly, That I was not to
receive the Law from the Mouth of Man: Then the said (called) Minister said,
That I Tempted God: And when I told him, That God could not be Tempted (that
is, to Evil) his Anger was raised against me, so that he left any more meddling
with me in Matters of Religion.

But that which first began to nausuate me, and make me to loathe that sort of
Government was, to see the Domineering Pride of the Priests of that Nation,
that they could force some that were not one with them in their Principles, to
come and take with them their Sacraments, as that of Bread and Wine, and
sprinkling of their Children, whereof neither Precept nor President can be
produced from holy Scripture; and if the Parents will not bring their Children
to them to be Sprinkled, they will do it in their Absence without, their
Consent. How inconsistent this is with the Rule of the Gospel, and the
Scriptures of Truth, I leave it to all that have the right Eye open to judge of
it: For they say. That the Children are saved by the Faith of their Parents,
and yet the Parents have not that Liberty to use their own Freedom in that
thing: And the prophanest Wretch that lives shall not be refused that
Privilege of Sprinkling, but rather proceeded against by their Law, if they
embrace it not, and by what sort of Members these Laws are constituted, I shall
instance one Particular, and then ye may judge ( exu^ que leonem) the Lion by
his Paw.

The General Assembly consists of some out of every Presbytery, and according
as that Prebytery is affected with the Love of a Religion these Commissioners
are chosen: and what a mingle mangle mungrel Galimasray of Omnigatherums is in
that Assembly, I leave the discerning and juditious Eye to consider, what may
be the Product of such a Compesition, composed of so many spotted Individuals
and party-colored Simples. I might produce several Instances, which might
enervate the same Procedure of such hodge podge Acts, but that I am not willing
to burden the Reader's Patience with such unpleasant Entertainment: Do men
gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles? And what other Miscarriages of
that Government did alienate my Spirit from it, as the Pride of the Covetous
Clergy, and their going from one Benefice to another, as they call it, Majus
bonum Ecclesiae; but I say, Ventri; that is, not for the more Good of the
Church, but for the Fatter Benefice of the Belly: and this is evidenced, that
seldom any of them go from a bigger to a less Stipend or Sallary, but to a
bigger, and so to sell them that they have Covenanted with for the bigger
Sallary; and some I have seen that would not come till they had their Bargain
made, for so much a Year, as one would buy a Horse in a Market; and if he be
not paid, he will not preach; and then when he is settled Parish Priest, he is
ordinarily Commander in chief, and all his Parishioners must stoop to him; and
if they pay not duly what they Covenanted for, he will by process of the Law,
pursue them, and strain their Goods.

Farewell ye Watchmen of the Night;
Who love in Darkness for to dwell;
And hates the shining of the Light:
Which is the Path to the Dark Cell.
There was another Practice of that National Church of Scotland, which did
estrange my Affection from them, their sticking so close to their Rigidity of
Persecution, so that if Christ himself should appear in the Flesh to them out
of their own Form, they would have refused him; and if Truth, not clothed in
their Garb, did speak among them, it was presently put to Silence. I shall
instance only one particular of one called Wood, who had some Charge in the
Custom-house of Leith, who for the Maintaining of the Truth (was cited, I do
not well remember whether it was before the Commission of the General Assembly,
or before the Synodical Assembly of Lothian, but one of them it was) he, the
said Wood was cited before them, because he said, That Christ was the Word, and
that the Letter was not the Word; and all the Arguments that they could produce
could not convince the Man (for I was Witness to it) for still he stood upon
these words, That the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, so that they
could not resist the power of his Assertion, nor deny the Scriptures, they did
fall a Threatening him with their Thunderbolt of their Excommunication, so that
he could not get so much time as to consider upon it, and to give in his Answer
for his Defense so much as till the next Assembly: and about two or three
Monehs after that, I meeting him in the Street of Edinbrough pid ask him,
Whether or no be had come to a clearer Resolution of the Word? But he not
knowing me, did become a little shie of me, till that I told him my Name (for I
was known to him by that, I being in process of Excommunication) then he told
me, That he had gotten no Satisfaction, and that he was forced to how to the
Assembly against his Light: For if he had been Excommunicated he had lost his
Livelihood, so that within a year or two he dyed; and I am sure that they were
not clear of his Blood.

All these that do the Truth deny
Of the Word made Flesh indeed,
They are of Antichrist his fry,
And on the Husks of Truth do feed.
By this time the Priests were become so Jealous of me, that they said, I would
Infect the whole Nation: They watched at the Post House for my Letters, to know
with whom I corresponded in England, where they found several Letters of mine,
when they opened them (whether it was by Order of the Committee of Estates I
know not) and if they did find any thing they could wrest to their turn, they
did keep my Letters; and if they found nothing that, could touch me, they
caused to seal up my Letters again, and to be delivered to me; I knowing
nothing what they had done, till some of themselves confessed it to me: In the
mean time my Correspondent Gawen Lawry Merchant of London, according to Orders,
sent me a Box with about Three Pound Sterling worth of Books, and to give me
notice of it to call for them in a Ship of the Preston Pannes, for the which
End he writ me a Letter by the Post, which they getting in their hands, I never
knowing any thing of it, till I going to visit my Cousin Preston Grange; his
Wife told me, That their Priest (called a Minister) one John Oswald, had taken
a Fox full of Books from a Ship of that Town of Preston Panne^, which was
directed for me; which did a little surprise me, I never hearing of it; yet it
behoved me to content my self, knowing. That what once comes into their Hands
(which is called the Kirk) is not easily recovered: So that I sent for the same
Books again, which were also seized upon by one Boswell, a Earmer of the Excise
Office, whereof I hearing, did make Application to him; and I being a Stranger
to him, and he not knowing the Difference that was betwixt the Priests and me,
nor what Acts had been emitted against those which they called Sectary Books I
did so capitulate for them, that I had them again: but in the process of time
the Lord ordered it so, that when the English came into Scotland, I did demand
my Books from the said Oswald the Priest, which did not a little sc^re him; and
he, to save his own Head, told me, That Warriston had them by Order of the
Comm^ssion of the General Assembly; from whom I desired one of his Friends to
require them; to whom he replied, That they were in his Closet, and he durst
not deliver them me without an Order; yet if I would send some Soldiers for
them, they might have them; which I did: But when I had the Box, I found many
of them wanting, and knew not whom to challenge, they passing through so many
corrupted Channels; but as they began with s^btil and undermining Falsehood, so
they ended with Theft; though it is like that these Bab^^onish Merchants by
trading with them Books, were helped to spin out their Hourglass upon my
Charges, though they were well paid otherwise. All this did so vex the Serpent,
that he knew not how to be avenged of me, but by thrusting forth his Venomous
Sting of Excommunication against me, though it was but like a Dog, that shows
his Teeth when he cannot bite but only bark; and this vexed them the more,
seeing m^ so to slight it, and tread upon it, by my Letter to the Commission of
the General Assembly; and seeing none to regard their Sentence, by keeping a
Distance from me, made their Act the more Contemptible, so as they were willing
to heal up the Wourd again, as they said to my dear Friend John Swinton, whom
they entreated, That he would desire the Sentence of Excommunication to be
taken off again: To whom he replied, That as he was passive in laying of it on,
he should be so in bearing of it: To whom they replied, If ^e will not be
active in seeking it, we wi^ be active in doing it. And so I standing in this
Case, they did only with me, as their Forefathers the Priests did to the Blind
Man, who, though naturally Blind, yet spiritually he had more Sight then
themselves. So I being cast out by them, Christ did hold me up; and they remain
in their Blind Condition to this day, in their Egyptian-State, where I leave
them groping after their dark Principles and blind Imaginations of their
Persecuting spirit; and I to remain in the Land of Goshen, enjoying Christ, the
Light and Life of man, who enlightens every man that comes into the World: for
they have Eyes, and see not; for the Light shines in Darkness, and they
comprehend it not: Ears they have, but hear not; but to the sweet Enchantings
of the Serpent do they hearken and bow, who creeping upon his Belly, feeding
upon the Dust of the Earth; though I do not include all under this predicament
and category, for I have more Charity to some of them.

Yet though in all this time I had a further Sight of the light then
themselves, yet there was a Gulf botwixt the Elest Children of the Lord called
Quakers, and me; for I saw further then I was willing to embrace; for there was
such a high Principle of the world in me, that the noble Principle of Light and
Life was looked over by me; yea, I lived in my own will, wit and wisdom, which
was accursed; Preferring that wisdom before that wisdom of God, which would
have made me a Child, and a Fool to the World, thinking that I might gain two
Kingdoms at once, to keep the Possession of the Earth, and the Kingdom of
Heaven also: and I being out of the pure Will, and out of the Cross to my own
Wisdom, I was judged by the eternal Spirit of Truth, and stood as condemned out
of the Life, because I being out of the Obedience; and insomuchas I could not
lose my Life, I did choose Death; for man's Life in this World is in Visibles,
unwilling to be separated from the World's Fashions, and Customs, and vain
Religions, Honor and Profit, and all things which I stood upon was a false
corrupt Ground, whilst I thus stood in the Alienation. Upon the Consideration
of all this, the Lord was pleased to dart in upon my prodigal spirit, to call
me home from the Husks that I was feeding upon, to my Father's House; and
whilst the Door of Mercy was open, he put a stop to the unlimitted Pleasures of
the Flesh; and then I came to hear the calm and still Voice of the Spirit, that
was stirring in that contemned people called Quakers; and the first stirring in
me of that Nature, which I did eminently take notice of, was, As I was riding
from Edinbrough in a Winter Evening to my own House, I did hear a Noise of some
men, as it were Fighting, so that I bid my Man ride up in haste to see what it
was, which my Man doing, he called to me, and said, That there was two Men on
Horseback beating of another Man going on Foot; so that I ridingup to them, I
did see them beatiug him, and he still keeping them off, saying, What did I say
to you, but bid you FEAR GOD? so that presently I did perceive, that it was a
Quaker, reproving sin in the other two; so I asking his Name, which he telling
me, I knew the man by Name, though not by Sight; and I was so offended with the
other two, that I fell to beat them with my Rod, and ordered those that were
with me to carry them to the next Prison; but he, the said Quaker did entreat
me to let them go, which (after taking notice of their Names and Places of
Abode) I did let them go. And a Week after the said Quaker was telling a
Relation of mine what a Curtisie I had done to him in a manner to save him; yet
said he, I found that same spirit in him that was in the other two men who beat
me; and my Relation telling* me simply the word; as he spoke them, the words
did so reach me, that I meeting the said Quaker again, I did desire him, That
as he passed that way he would make my House his Lodging-place;

The Light in Darkness it did shine,
Though I did not it comprehend,
Till that God did my Heart incline
His Word made Flesh for to attend.
Which he seeing the Witness in me reached, he was the more free to do; yet
though the Witness was so far reached in me, that I could discern spirits, as
betwixt the spirit of Meekness and Rashness, yet there was still that Mind
unbrought down, that stood in my way to hinder my Obedience, so that the Lord
was pleased to stick closer to me with his Rod; for first, He stripped me naked
by removing of my Children, which was by Piecemeal, to fit me to yoke my self
under the Cross, and then by separating me and my Wife for several years, so
that I was wholly turned out of my Estate also, as to this day I am to live in
a Wilderness Condition, so that I was forced to leave my native Country, and go
to France; where then the Lord began to work upon my spirit, to bring me the
nearer to himself; for when all Visibles failed me, and those to whom my Wife
and I most trusted did become my subtilest Enemies; yet the Lord did so
Commiserate my Condition, that in the Bowels of Mercy he made me to take up the
Cross to my own will, and to resign my self fully over to him, seeing all
Visibles failed me; and he used that way of Mercy to bring me nearer to him,
which nothing else could; and thus closing with the Visitation of the Lord, I
found more sweetness and contentment then ever I had in my fullest delight and
Pleasure of the World, and thus I do witness, and the Lord is my Witness, that
I never came to my Rest till then; and I would have done any thing never so
hard and unpleasing to the Flesh, to bear a Testimony to the Truth that the
Lord had revealed in me; and shortly there was an Opportunity cast into my hands
to try me, and that was this, There came a Woman Friend out of England to the
Town of Diep, (where I was then) together with a Maid, to bear a Testimony to
the Truth against the Protestants of that Nation, and brought with them several
Books of Friends translated into French, and distributed in the Town, and gave
me also to distribute, which were writ by George Fox and William Dewsbury, and
several others, and some Papers they gave forth themselves, which I translated
into French, they not knowing the Language; but in all this they never did
manifest to me their Intentions; for it is like that in that frame of spirit
that I then was in, and foreseeing the Danger, and not so fully come to the
Obedience of Truth, as I thought I was before the Trial came; yet so it was,
that they went the next First Day (called Sunday) to the Meeting House of the
Protestants, where there were many Thousands of People, and there did place
themselves in the most Conspicuous Place of the Meeting, just over against the
then called Minister, the said Friend having clothed her self in Sackcloth,
and her Hair hanging down sprinkled with Ashes, was covered with her Mantle and
Hood, and when the said called Minister was in the highest of his Devotion, she
did stand up, with the other Maid, who did take from the said Woman her M^ntle
and Hood, she appearing all in her Sackcloth and Ashes, her Hair hanging down,
and turning her self round several times, that all the People might see her,
did strike such a Consternation both upon the ca^ed Minister, and the People,
that they were all at a stand; the said Minister's Wife having confessed to a
Friend since, that her spirit was so affected with that Sight, that she said,
This is of a deeper Reach then I can comprehend; for the Witness in some was so
reached at that time: and a little while after they both did fall down upon
their Knees, and Prayed, and then went out of the Meeting, where a great many
following of them, to whom they distributed of their Books, and spoke in the
Marketplace, and then came to their Lodging, which was in a Scotch-man's
House, who kept a Victualling-House, but no Entry there was for them, and they
being destitute came to my Lodging, I knowing nothing of this all this time, I
not going to that Meeting, and when they came to me they did show to me, That
their Work was d^ne that they came for to that Nation, and now wanted Lodging
till they went away: and I asked them, What they had done? and they told me: so
I went to some other Victualling-Houses to get them Lodging, which was promised
for them, so as I kept them at my Lodging till Bedtime; and then I went with
them to that place as was promised me, and when we came Entry was refused there
also, so that at that time of Night Lodging could not be had for them, the
Protestants had so stopped their Entry and where; so that I took them back to
my Lodging again, and offered them my Bed, and would shift for my self, I being
better acquainted in the Town, but they refused to put me out of my Chamber;
then I dealt with my Landlady of the House, to let them stay in any of her
Rooms for that Night to sit up in, but she refused it, saying; She durst not,
for fear of giving Offense to others; all that I could prevail with her at that
time of the Night, was to let them have an Out-house to stay in for that Night,
which was an Hen-House, so that I gave one of them my Nightgown, and to the
other my Furred-Coat, to save them from the Cold that Night, and the next day I
brought them to my Chamber again; and after that we had broken fast, I went to
the Key to look for a Passage-Boat to carry them to England again, and in my
returning back I saw so many people of all sorts standing about my Lodging,
that I did pass by it, but immediately one came running to me, saying, That the
King's Advocate was at my Chamber, waiting for me; and when I came in he told
me, That I had Transgressed the Laws of the Nation, by receiving Persons of
another Religion to my Lodging; for the King tolerated only two Religions,
viz. the Papists and the Protestants: Then I told him, That I had not
Transgressed the Law of Hospitality, and I was forced to it, so as I could not
let them lie in the Street, where they were in Danger of their Lives by the
rude Multitude: So they took them away with Sergeants to the Judicatory, where,
after they had judged them, they sent them to Prison, and they not knowing the
Language, they wanted Food, and other Outward Necessaries, none looking after
them; so that I went to the Judge Criminal, and sought leave to provide for
them, which I did, by bringing to them both Bread and Drink, Fireing, and all
other Necessaries so long as they were there: And the said Judge sent for me,
and whilst I was with him to be Examined, he sent to my Chamber to search what
of theirs they could find with me; so that they found some Books, and the
Sackcloth, and some Ashes, which they sent to the Parliament of Roan, from
whom they had received an Order to read a Paper to them, That they should be
transported forthwith back to England with the first Passage-Boat (and all
their Papers and Books to be burnt at the Market Cr^ss) and themselves, if they
or any of that Religion should come to that Nation again: And so a Passage Boat
being made ready, they were put into it, in the Night time, but would not
suffer me to go along with them to it, yet did I provide such things as were
necessary for their Voyage; and I told them, That they were not to pay any
thing for their Passage; but the Judge told them, That they were to pay for
their Passage; to whom I replied, That if I had the Liberty to choose a
Passage-Boat, and time allowed me, I would pay for their Passage, otherwise let
the same Boat bring them back again. So they were forced to pay their Passage.
After they were gone, they intended to pursue me, as one of their Judgment; but
I (willing to eschew the Cross) told them. That I was there before they came to
France, and they could prove nothing against me, only the Protestants had
informed them, that I did not come to their Meeting, yet this they could not
make a Crime; as also, I told them, If they persecuted me, I being a Merchant,
and trafficking there, they might expect the like to be done to their Merchants
in England: Then the Judge sent to the Custom-House, to see if my Name was in
their Custom-Books, which they finding, did go no further against me. Yet for
all this I was not so sensible of the Hollowness of my Heart, as afterward I
was; for when the Judge affirmed, That I was of their Judgment; I told him,
That I loved them, but they were better then I, but that their Way was too
strait for me to walk in.

There were two things Remarkable that fell out within the year upon these
Inhospital Refusers of lodging to these two Friends of Truth. The one was, That
the said Scottish-man, who shut them out, Dyed within the Twelve Months. And
the Woman, my Landlady, that refused them a Chamber to fit in, that same time
Twelve Months her House was Burnt, and never yet known whence the Fire came*
and though it was in the middle of the Town, yet there was none Burnt besides,
but it alone.

But afterward I having sent for several Hundreds of the said Friends Books,
and did distribute them to the Country and City, so many of them, so that they
intended to search after me just as I was upon my leaving of that Town: having
done my Service there, did return to Roan; whereupon one Night that I could get
no Rest, and was somewhat indisposed in my Body, so that it did arise in the
Night time in my Heart, To get up, and send some of these said Books by Post,
as some to the Judge Criminal of Diep, and some of them to the Jesuits College
there, and some of them to the Jesuits College and the Scottish College at
Paris, directing them after the French style, otherwise they could not have
been received at the Post House; and then I had much Rest in my spirit, and my
Body returned to a Right Temper.

And after that I had sojourned a while at Roan, I found that there was some
Service for the Truth by me to be done at Caen, because it was a Town where
most Protestants were, and there I did distribute so many of Friends Books
there, and the Protestants there retaining so much of the Presbyterian
Principles (as most part of the Protestants of France do) having a greater
Inclination to persecute those who differ from them, then to suffer for
Religion; for they were the greatest Enemies I had (right Presbyterians) and
they fearing that my Books might bring them to suffer, because they spoke
against the Papists: and I not coming to their Meeting, did complain of me to
the Lieutenant General of that Town, so that they forced me to leave that place.

All you that are of Cain's Race,
Are thirsty after Blood.
But those that stand in Abel's place
Do follow after what is Good.
And after my Service done there, I went to Alencon, where many Protestants
live, where I stayed all that Winter; and when I was in my Service, the Judge*
Criminal sent for me, and after a long Discourse he and I agreed so well
together, that he invited me to come and see him oftener, and we should not
speak in Matters of Religion, and if I would that he should send for some of
the Jesuits, and they and I might have free Inter-communing together: To whom I
replied, That I being a Stranger I was not willing to dispute with any, it not
being permitted to a Stranger; yet I would not be afraid to maintain my
Principles against all the Jesuits of the Nation: Which words did so exasperate
(it seems) them against me, that it did raise a new Persecution against me,
which did fall out, that when my Wife and I was walking in the Fields, at my
returning it was told me, That there was some searching at my Lodging, and had
broken up my Chamber Door, so that I sent my Wife Home, and I did go strait to
the Judge Criminal, to know what the Searching meaned; but he told me, He knew
nothing of it; and if there was anything, it did proceed from the Jesuits
because of my Confidence against them: and some probability I had of the thing,
for I found my Letters broken up at the Post House several times; and when I
challenged the Postmaster, he said, That they came to him so. So the time
drawing near to go from that place, and that I had done my Service in Alencon,
I told the Judge Criminal, That I was to go to the great Fair of Caen within
Fourteen days; then the said Judge said, That he would protect me so long: And
so at the time appointed I went to Caen, where I was not long but my
Correspondent at Alencon did write me word, That the day after I came from it,
the Governor of the Town had been at my Lodging, to seek for me, but I was
gone: And so after that all my Service was done that I had then in France, and
that War was declared betwixt England and France in the year 1666. I returned
to Diep in order to my return to England, and so I staid there for Passage,
which I could not get in the Time of War, till the (so called) Lord Holli^,
Ambassador from England, was returning for England, of whom I desired Passage
in his Company, which he freely granted me, and so came to England with his
Convoy.

But I have omitted all this time to show you, that the High Places as yet were
unbroken down in me, but that some Groves were as yet left standing,
notwithstanding all the Wonderful Mercies the Lord had bestowed upon me, in
carrying me and my Wife upon the Wings of his Providence in our Wilderness
Condition, which would spend more time to relate then some (it may be) would
bestow upon the reading of it; yea, and I dare say, that none could well
understand nor believe, but those who have trod in the same Paths as we did:
But I being so long in Egypt, and I so habituated and leavened to their
Fashions and Customs, I was like Joseph, that could Swear by the Life of
Pharaoh, and had not come to that Plainness of Language which God does require,
but could Complement with their Fashions and Words: And I had Thoughts that all
was well with me, till I came to a Trial in England again, so that the Face of
Friends did strike a Dread and Terror in my Heart, when I thought that all was
well, till the Spirit of the Lord running through others of his Vessels did
awaken me; for I was Upright in my own Judgment; but the Lord searched me: For
I could come with Confidence to Meetings, and frequent the Assemblies of the
Lord, yet I durst not own the Name of Quaker, I not being Faithful to the
Measure which I had received; for now it was become so far high for me, as
before my Obedience I had esteemed it low; and after that, I would willingly by
Wisdom have made void the Obedience into such things as Matters of
Indifferency, and accounted them but Circumstantials, and Foolish to put any
Weight upon the doing or not doing, it became so burdensome to me, that I
could have undergone the greatest Strait Imaginable rather then omitted it; and
as I became Obedient, there I felt Strength and Power, and a more real Content
did spring up in me; and in this Light and Power of the Spirit, that has
visited me, did I feel Strength to wait and know further his Will and Mind; for
in the height of this Exercise I found my self overcome; and my self not my
own, but the Lord's, to do with me what he pleased to require of me, what
Service he would, I should be willing to obey in his Strength; and if the Lord
never show me any more, I feel Contentment in his Will, earnestly desiring,
that I may never stop the course of his Spirit; for I find, that there is
nothing can, nor is able to satisfy my thirsty Soul short or beneath the Lord
of Life.

In the Fire, as Gold, tried I was,
Till Consumed was the Tin and Dross;
And then I knew what was come to pass,
That I did not suffer any Loss.
Postscript.
FRIENDS,
THere are a few Words, which I have to add to you; The Litteral Professors,
who can own the Ministration of Christ without you, but deny him within; and
who raise up Jealousies and Prejudices against us, as if we denied the
Scriptures and Ordinances of God, and Christ that dyed at Jerusalem; professing
him in Words, but denying him in Reallity and Substance; and you to be the only
Owners of Christ, and yet ye forget your own Principles, who have been all your
time praying for the Spirit of the Lord, and now when he comes to you in his
Spirit, ye will not only be shie, and scare off him, but ye will persecute all
that will not own him after your Form, though we really in our hearts own that
Christ in the Flesh, which in the Fullness of Time did offer up that Body
prepared to do the Will of the Father, according as it is expressed in the
Scriptures of Truth: Neither do we hold any thing for Christ, but him who
appeared, and was made manifest in the Flesh. I cannot believe that Doctrine of
you the Litteral Professors, who recede from your own Principles of the Literal
Profession of the Letter, which says, Is not Christ within you, except you be
Reprobates? and Christ in you the Hope of Glory. I know that some of you will
say, That it is the Virtues and Graces of Christ: But I would willingly know of
you, How Christ's Virtues and Graces are separated from himself? This seems a
setting up of your own Conceivings, or an Image in your Mind, of the Mind of
the Spirit, and miss the Thing it self, which alone is known by the Spirit: For
we find experimentally a clear Distinction betwixt the searching out by the
Reasonings of the carnal Mind, and Scriptures opened by the Spirit, and felt in
the Life. Therefore it were better for you, to examine really your Knowledge of
Christ, your Faith and Knowledge of the Scriptures, and your Prayers also, lest
ye miss of the Substance, and meet with a Shadow, which is only able to please
the Natural Part, but justifies not the Soul, I desire that you let not this
my Christian-Expostulation with you displease you, but rather set you home, to
sink down to that which is only able to make you clearly discern, whether you
or we are the Truest Owners of Christ, seeing ye cannot make it appear by
Scripture, which ye say is your Rule to walk by, that the Outward Application
of Christ brings Salvation, without the Inward Manifestation of the Spirit.

O! Blessed be the Day forever,
That it pleased the Lord to come,
Me from the World to sever,
Unto the State of some,
Who have past through the Seas
Unto the High and Glorious State
Of all that have the Spirit of these,
That pass by Tophet's Gate
Unto the Port of Heaven,
Where all the Saints have Rest,
Which the only Lord has given
To the Seed that he has Blessed.
For when I was in Egypt's Land,
Wanting Straw, I did make Brick;
And ready at the Command
Of the (so called) Kirk,
To Work all the length of the Day,
Without the Sense or Sight
Of (which I ever should Obey)
The Shining of the LIGHT,
That would have taught me the Way
From Dead Formal Duties, that is without,
Unto the LIGHT Within, I say,
Who lives in LIFE, and has no doubt
The Promise to Obtain,
Which none at all can have
In the State that I have been,
And would not TRUTH receive.
Oh! that all those as do this read,
Would come and feel the same,
That they may know, with all the Seed,
The true Abode of the I AM;
Who is the only Great JEHOVAH,
And Rules in the Hearts of Men;
Praises, Honor and HALELUJAH
To him be sung of all the Seed, AMEN.
Given forth the 10th of the 3d Month, by a Lover of the Souls of all men, but
especially to the Faithful of the Infallible and Only Everlasting Truth,
William Dundas.

THE END.
