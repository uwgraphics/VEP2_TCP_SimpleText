AN IMPARTIAL SURVEY AND COMPARISON OF THE Protestant Religion, As by Law
Established; With the main Doctrines of Popery: Wherein is shown, That Popery
is contrary to Scripture, Primitive Fathers and Councils; and that proved from
Holy Writ, the Writings of the Ancient Fathers for several Hundred Years, and
the Confession of the most Learned Papists themselves. Whereby the Papists vain
pretense to Antiquity, and their reproaching the Protestant Doctrines with
Novelty, is wholly overthrown. By a True Son of the Protestant Church of
England, as established by Law.

THE PREFACE TO THE Protestant Reader.
AS we have immortal Souls of infinite more value than all transient glories
and sublunary advantages; so ought we both in obedience to the tender and
compassionate advice of our Blessed Redeemer (who purchased them with his own
dear Blood,) and out of a true concern for our Eternal Welfare, to live such
lives here as we may be happy hereafter. Pursuant to this excellent design, We
ought carefully attend to that Holy Religion we have so long professed, which
teaches no Doctrines that are not agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, and to the
practice of the best and purest Ages of Christianity. A Religion, which neither
robs God of his Honor, nor the King of his due; a Religion, whose venerable
Rites keep a just medium betwixt vain Popish Pomp, and Fanatical Indecency; a
Religion that not only teaches us how to be good, but obliges us so to be, that
is, a Religion truly Christian, and a Copy of that perfect Original which our
Lord and Savior has left us for our direction. And therefore as nothing ought
to be dearer to us; so we cannot be sufficiently thankful to his Sacred Majesty
(whom God preserve) for the Gracious assurance he has given, that he will
support it, and defend us in the profession of it. A King whose Royal
Progenitors of Immortal Memory for above 100 years, have not only been the
Ornaments but the supports too of the Protestant Religion; His famed
Grandfather King James Learnedly defending it by his Pen, and thereby justly
meriting the glorious Title of its Defender; His Excellent For so does Mons.
Militere. in his Epistle to His late Majesty, confess.
Father dying a Glorious Martyr, and his late dearly beloved Brother being a
long time Exile for our Reformed Religion. Let us then strive to show that we
are not unworthy of so Illustrious and Valiant a Protector, by our Loyalty to
him; not unworthy of such a Religion by our conformity to its Principles, in
Holiness, Sobriety and Charity, and a steadfast adherence to it, in opposition
to any other that will destroy that which our Church has built upon so sure a
foundation. And that we may rightly understand what this Religion is, and the
difference betwixt that which is established in our Church, and what is owned
in the Church of Rome, I have made the following Collection; wherein is
demonstrated how contrary the Popish Religion is to our Church, and how
inconsistent with Scripture, the practice of the Primitive and best Ages of
Christianity, and that proved, not only from the Writings of the Apostles, and
choice Records of Antiquity, but even granted to be so by the most Vives de
Instrumentis probab.
learned and no less impartial Papists themselves; which as it is the testimony
of one Friend against another, is looked upon as an undeniable Evidence.

Before I conclude, I must admonish the Reader, that I have not rendered the
Authors at large, but so quoted them, that the Learned may examine them; nor
have I drawn Arguments (as usually) from them, because that would have made
this Book (designed for a Pocket-companion) to have swelled into a great
Volume; yet to make requital for that just omission, I have, at the conclusion
of each Section, directed the Reader to other Writers of our Religion, which
treat of that particular Controversy at large.

May then the All-wise God, by whose Divine permission thus much has been
performed, so bless this poor labor of his unworthy Servant, that it may be
instrumental to the good of his Church, and the confirming of all our weak
Brethren in our most Holy Faith; which was the principal design of its
publication.

THE INTRODUCTION.
THE Church of Rome, though she talk aloud of the Antiquity of, and an
universal consent in her Doctrines, is so far from either, That therein she
will be tied to no Rule, nor observe any Law, as if she would verify that
Remarque of Crantzius Metropol. 7.45.
Crantzius upon her in another Case, Nunc ad se omnium Ecclesiarum jura traxit
Romana Ecclesia, That she has engrossed to her self all the privileges or
rights of other Churches. Her greatest Bellarmin de verbo dei l. 4. c. 4. --
Pighius Eccles. Hierarch. l. 3. c. 3. Pool de primatu Romanae Ecclesiae fol. 92.
defendants reject the Scripture, though given forth by 2 Timothy 3.16.
Divine Inspiration, and do say it is no more to be believed, in saying it is
from God, than Mahomet 's Alcaron, etc. And good reason why, Council. de
stabilienda Romans sede p. 6.
because her Doctrines are repugnant to the Holy Scriptures. What then will she
trust to? Tradition: that she equals with Council. Trident. Sess. 4. decret. 1.
the Scriptures themselves. And yet her great Annalist, Cardinal Baronius, who
was once, as it were, a living Library, while he kept the Vatican Dr. James his
Corruption of the Fathers, Part 4. p. 26.
Anno 44. Sect. 42.
confesses, That he despaired to find out the truth even in those matters
which true Writers have recorded: because there was nothing which remained
sincere and incorrupted. This blow given by so skillful an Artist, dashes all
the Characters wherein the defense of Oral Tradition should be legible. And, if
Tradition in true Writers be so difficult to preserve, how can it be expected
to be safe from spurious ones, or without any Writers at all?

However, though the Papists do not grant, that this ruins their Tradition, I
am sure, it cuts off that definition of it, by Bellar. de (...). cap. 9.
Cardinal Bellarmin, who affirms, that to be a true Tradition which all former
Doctors (mind that! for then will the Fathers come in for a share) have
successively in their Ages acknowledged to come from the Apostles, and by their
Doctrine or Practices have approved, and which the Universal Church owns as
such.

Moreover Bellarmin 's Definition of Tradition gives us this encouragement and
liberty to try Antiquity by Fathers, Councils and Papal Decrees.

For the Fathers, I hope, the Romanists, who boast so much of their being on
their party, will not refuse to be tried by them, when Coster Enchirid.
Controvers. cap. 2. Constat manifest, etc. Campian rat. 3 Seculis omnino
quindecim, etc. and rat. 10. Testes res omnes.
Coster and others make such a fine flourish in their pretensions to Antiquity.
No, the Fathers shall not be Judges of the Papists: the Romanists will not be
controlled by the Fathers. For Cardinal Baronius ad annum 34.
Baronius says, The Catholic Church (and this they would have you to believe,
is their own Church; but against all Reason and Sense) does not in all things
follow the interpretation of the Fathers. This is a fair but modest Confession.
But Cardinal Bellarmin de Council. autorit. l. 2. c. 12. Sect. Respondeo.
Bellarmin goes further, The Writings of the Fathers (says he) are not rules
to us, nor have the Authority to bind us. This is an How the Papists contemn
and condemn the Fathers, See Dr. James's Corruption of the Fathers, Part 4
home thrust: and yet Salmeron in Ep. ad Romans cap. 5. disp. 51. p. 468.
Salmeron is more incivil with those Ancient Doctors, when he says, That the
latter Doctors are sharper sighted than they, and therefore pronounces of many
of them at once, That we must not follow a multitude to deviate from the Truth.
I am afraid he gave his own Church a rude blow there; for we may turn that
Argument of his against the Church of Rome, which ever and anon is pleading her
great number of Professors. To which let us add, what another Romanist says in
this point. And Corn. Muss. Episc. Bitont in Romans 14. p. 468.
he tells you, That he believes the Pope in matters of Faith, before a thousand
Augustines, Jeromes, or Gregory's.

This indeed is plain dealing, and no mincing of the matter! But then again it
is wholly opposite to their vain Pleas for Antiquity, and wholly different from
the modest procedure of Apolog. adv. Rufin l. 2. p. 219. tom. 2.
S. Jerome, who thinks it great rashness and irreverence, presently to charge
the Ancients with heresy for a few obnoxious terms; since, when they erred,
they erred perhaps with a simple and honest mind, or wrote things in another
sense than they were (afterward) taken. But, if this be all the esteem the
Papists have for the Ancient Doctors, then adieu to the Authority of the
Fathers in the Church of Rome.

Moreover, even the Councils fare no better in the Papists hands: For it is
usual in their Editions of the Councils, to have some Printed with this Title,
Reprobatum (or disallowed) others Ex part Approbatum, Vid. Bin. not. ad 2.
Council. Constant. tom. 1. part 1. p. 541. Item not. ad Council. Chalced. tom. 2.
par. 1. p 410.
accordingly as they agree or disagree with their Opinions and Interest at
Rome. Which verifies that Lud. Vives in Aug. de civit. Dei, l. 20. c. 36.
smart Censure of Ludovicus Vives, That those are accounted Decrees and
Councils, which make for their purpose, and all others are no more valued by
them than the meetings of some tatling Women in a Weaving Shop, or at the Baths.

But although they reject both Fathers and Councils, (when they are pressed by
the Protestants with their Authorities) yet, to take away all testimonies of
the Fathers from us, the politic Council of Trent set up their Indices
Expurgatorii, which they referred to Pope Pius 4. whose Bull for that end bore
date March 24. 1564. See Dr. James's Corruption of the Scriptures, Fathers and
Councils, Printed 1611. Part 4.
And in these Tables they set down, what Books were by them forbidden, and in
which to be purged, and what places ought to be left out. Thus designed they,
that both Fathers and Councils should lisp their Language.

But, though it be contrary to that Rule, by which Joh. 5.31.
Christ himself was willing to be tried, If I bear witness of my self, my
witness is not true and contrary to all equity and the old Capitul. Carol. Mag.
c. 88.
Laws, viz. That they which are brought out of our own House, ought not to be
witnesses for us; yet, since they have disowned (when pressed with strength of
Reason, and oppressed with Truth) the Scriptures, the Fathers and Councils, We
will pursue them to their last fort; to wit, to the Decrees of their Popes,
which they so much adore. If they gainsay these, then Conclamatum est, their
Case is desperate.

Well, then it must be so; for they have rejected the Traditions of old Popes
for those of new ones: One would have thought, that old Friends and old Divines
had been the surest and foundest; but it is not so at Rome.

For they have slighted and contradicted that Decree of Anaclet. Epist. ap.
Bin. Tom. 1. Part 1. p. 43.
Anacletus: That all, who are present at Mass, shall communicate; That of
Gelas. decr. de Consec. did. 2. cap. 12.
Pope Gelasius of not taking the Bread alone, which (honest-man) he called
Sacrilege; and Binius in notis Tom. 1. part 1. p. 64.
That of Alexander 11. of celebrating but one Mass in one day. Which abominable
practice of the Roman Church make good that saying of their own Pope P. Gelas.
Ep. 4.
Gelasius, Quaero ab his judicium quod pretendunt ubinam possint agitari, an
apud ipsos, ut iidem sint inimici, testes and Judices? Which signifies in
short, that they would be both Enemies, Witnesses and Judges in their own
Cause; as being Conscious to themselves of such Errors as will not bear the
test, nor can be defended without such foul play. Who then can safely trust the
conduct of his Salvation to that Church, (of Rome) which refuses to be tried
by the Word of God, by the Ancient Fathers, by General Councils, and even by
the Decrees of her (pretended) Spiritual Heads?

But because in the following Book I have produced the Testimonies of the
Fathers voting against Popish Doctrines, it will not (I judge) be unnecessary
to subjoin, That, although we highly esteem and respect the Fathers, and
especially those of the first Three hundred years after Christ, and make use of
their Writings, as explaining the sense of the Scriptures, and handling to us
the Opinions of the Ages they lived in; yet we never receive any of them with
the same respect and esteem that we do the Word of God: And that with good
reason: For though they were learned and pious men; yet they were but men, and
consequently were liable to error as well as other men.

And herein the Advice of S. Austin is to be followed, to wit, to follow
Neminem velim sic amplecti mea omnia, ut me sequatur, nisi in eis, quibus me
non errare perspexerit: August. de persever. Sanct. cap. 21. tom. 27.
him (and such as himself) no further than they follow Truth and Holy
Scripture, Solis eis Scripturarum libris qui jam Canonici appellantur didici
hunc timorem honoremque deserre, ut nullum eorum autorem Scribendo aliquid
errasse firmissime credam, August. 1 Epist. 19.
which ought still to be preferred before them: And yet S. Augustine was neither
the worst nor the meanest of those Christian Hero's. Thus do we reverence but
do not idolize them, and only prefer the Scriptures before them; whereas the
Papists value their late Papal Decrees before the Primitive Doctors.

These things being premised, I shall renew that fivefold Challenge about the
Popes Supremacy, formerly propounded by a Reverend and Learned Bishop of our
Church; which the Papists ought first to answer, before they can justly obtain
what they in vain pretend to as Consequences of that Supremacy. For, they
failing to prove this, (which, I think, they will never be able to do) their
Attempts in the points depending thereon must needs be fruitless and
ineffectual.

The Challenge is this:
1. Whether our Savior before his Ascension did constitute S. Peter his Vicar,
and gave him a monarchical Supremacy over the Apostles and the whole Church? 2.
Whether the Papists can prove, that St. Peter, while he lived, exercised such
Power and Supreme Jurisdiction, even over the Apostles? In such Cases as these,
Idem est non esse and non apparere. 3. Whether, if St. Peter exercised any such
Authority, it was not temporary, and ceased with his Person, as the Apostleship
did? 4. Whether (if all these were true, as they are wholly the contrary) they
can make it appear, That the Bishop of Rome was the Successor of St. Peter,
and not the Bishop of Antioch? and whether ever he was at Rome or no? 5.
Whether they can make it appear, That our Blessed Savior, when on Earth,
exercised such a temporal Monarchy as the Pope now challenges?
Confessions of the Popish Doctors in this Case.
To the first and second Queries it is Confessed by Cusan. de Council. Cath. 2.3.
Cardinal Cusanus, That St. Peter received no more Authority (and then he could
not exercise any Authority over his Fellows) than the rest of the Apostles.

To the 3d and 4th Queries it is Confessed by Aen. Sylvius de gestis Council.
Basil.
Aeneas Sylvius (afterward Pope, by the name of Pius 2.) That the Pope's
Succession is not revealed in Scripture; and then it cannot be proved jure
divino positivo.

And by Bellarmin, De Romans Pont l. 4. c. 4.


That neither Scripture nor Tradition (habet) allows (then farewell Papal
Supremacy) That the Apostolic Seat (or Chair) was so fixed at Rome, (which I
really believe as well as he) that it could not be taken from thence. And then
why might it not be at Antioch or Jerusalem as well as Rome?

Confessed by him Idem. de Pontif. l. 2. c. 29.
further,

That as long as the Emperors were Heathen, the Pope was subject to them in all
Civil Causes,

And

That for above One thousand years, his Id. de Romans Pont. l. 4. c. 2. Sect.
Secunda Opinio.
Judgment was not esteemed Infallible, nor Idem de Council. l. 2. cap. 13.
his Authority above that of a General Council.

Where was then the exercise or acknowledgment of this Supremacy and
Infallibility of the Popes? Was all the world a-sleep, or ignorant so long of
this Power which they now challenge to themselves Jure Divino? No, but the Pope
(I warrant you) had not yet the opportunity to usurp and challenge it, as he
has done since.

To four of these, you see, they have plainly yielded: and the last, they can
never make good, either from Scripture or Ecclesiastical History. Add to these
the Confession of that Learned Papist, Barns's Catholico-Romanus Pacificus MS.
Sect. 31.
Father Barns, That allowing the Bishop of Rome to have Supremacy elsewhere;
yet the Pope has no Supremacy in Britain. Insula autem Britanniae gavisaest
olim privilegio Cyprio, ut nullius Patriarchae Legibus subderetur. And
afterward, Videtur pacis ergo retineri debere sine dispendio Catholicismi and
absque Schismatis ullius nota. What can the Papists say to this so plain an
acknowledgment? But not designing to treat at large upon the Pope's Supremacy,
I have not (as in the following Subjects) produced the Testimonies of Fathers
and Councils against this Doctrine of Rome, but shall advise the Reader to
consult herein Bishop Jewel against Harding, Article 4. Archbishop Bramhal 's
Schism Guarded against Will. Sergeant. Dr. Barrow of the Pope's Supremacy, and
the Bishop of Lincoln 's Brutum Fulmen, who will give him full satisfaction in
that point.

SECTION I.
THE Protestant Church of England, our Holy Mother, admits of no other Rule for
Faith and practice than the Articles of the Church of England published Ann.
Dom. 1562, for the avoiding of diversities of opinions, and for the
establishing of consent touching true Religion, Article 6, and 20. 2d Book of
Homilies, Hom. 2.
Holy Scriptures, which according to 2 Timothy 3.15.
the Apostles are able to make us wise unto Salvation.

The Church of Rome does equal unwritten Council. Trident. Sess. 4. Decret. 1.
Traditions with the Holy Scriptures: whom Pighius Eccles. Hierarch. L. 3. C. 3.
some of that Church do call a nose of Wax: Bellarmine di verbo Dei, l. 4. c. 4.
Another, and that no less man than a Cardinal, affirms, That the Scripture is
no more to be believed in saying that it comes from God than Mahomet's Alcoran,
because that says so too. Another Pool de Primatu Romanae Ecclesiae, fol. 92.
Cardinal says, That the Scriptures have no authority but for the Decree of
the Church; (they mean the Roman Church) by whom it Caranza Controvers. 1. And
no marvel, when another affirms that the Scripture has no more authority
than Aesop's Fables: V. Bailly Tract. 1.9.17.
ought to be regulated, and not the Church be regulated by it: and the reason
is, because (as it is Peter Suitor Translat. Bibl. c. 22.
confessed) that the people would easily be drawn away from observing the
Church's (i.e. Romish) Institutions Consil. de Stabilienda Romans sede p. 6. And
though the Papists do cashier the public use of the Holy Scriptures, and fly
to (as they pretend) an Infallible Judge; yet are they not agreed among
themselves, who that should be. These Learned Romanists following contend, that
the privilege of Infallibility belongs only to the whole Church militant, and
neither to the Pope, nor General Council, nor to the Body of the Clergy: Occam
Dial. p. 1. l. 5. c. 25, 29, 3.
, when they should perceive, That they are not contained in the Law of Christ,
and that their ( i.e. Popish) Doctrines are not only different from, but
repugnant to the Holy Scriptures.

the Popish Laity, but even the Priests themselves are very ignorant in the Holy
Scriptures, so that once a Schoolman in the last Age, being to preach at Paris,

refuses to be tried by the Test of God's Word, but is diametrically opposite
to the practice of the Primitive Christians, as appears in the following

The Church of Rome does make the Books commonly called Apocrypha of equal
authority with those of the Old and New Testament; which neither the Witness

Invocation of Saints or Angels is
Contrary to Scripture,

them fast bound to his Service by the testimonies and declarations of his
goodness, says Peter Chrysol. Sermon. 147.

Other Papists say, That there is neither precept nor example for it in
Scripture: and they give reasons for it; for the Old Testament, because the
Fathers were not yet admitted to the beatifical Vision; and for the
New Testament, because that the Apostles were men of such piety and humility,
that they would not admit of it themselves, and therefore mentioned it not in
their Writings; and withal, because in the beginning of Christianity there
would have been a suspicion, that they had only changed the names of the
Heathen Deities, and retained the same kind of Worship, Eckius in Enchirid. c.

it ascribes God's Honor and Attributes to his Creatures, and derogates from

Reason and Argument than these Papists have done?

dele-Solus Deus adorandus.
That God alone is to be worshipped. I suppose, they mean, he must have sharers

it is Blasphemy.

Image Worship
is Contrary to Scripture,

Exodus 20, 4, 5. Hence do the Papists often leave the Second Commandment out of
their Catechisms, as in Vaux's Catechism, Ledesma's Catechism, and Officium B.
Mariae, Pii. 5. Pont. juffu editum Antwerp. A. D. 1590.

That

the Second Commandment was meant of, and designed against Images and Idols,

Though this practice is so far from being Ancient, That elevation of the Host,

have been approved by the Universal Church, by the Decrees of the first General

of it which is called the Court of Rome, obtrudes and imposes new Articles of
Faith, making Bellar de Eccles. l. 3.

That Communion in both kinds had been instituted by our Blessed Savior

had the confidence to alter it!

They certainly had confidence enough, but neither too much Reason nor too much
Religion, who durst disannull what our Blessed Savior had enjoined, and what
carried his seal to that very day. Where was then that reverence to Antiquity,
which their Followers to this day so much pretend to?

SECT. VI.
We do not believe that the Elements of Bread and Wine Article 28, and 29.
after Consecration become the very Body and Blood of Christ, though the worthy
Receiver partakes of both in a spiritual manner by faith; because we herein
have all the testimony we are capable of; viz. that of our Reasons and of our
Senses, to believe, That there is not a real Transubstantiation or a change of
the Elements of Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of our Savior: which is
an absurd tenet, and has occasioned many Superstitions.

The Church of Rome holds, that there Council. Trident. Sess. 13. c. 4.
is a conversion of the whole substance of Bread and Wine into the substance of
Christ's Body and Blood by Consecration.

Eucharist. Which place when Cheyney, a Protestant in Q. Mary's days, insisted
upon against the Papists, and demanded what it was that was burned? one
answered, That it was either the Body of Christ, or the substance of Bread put
there by miracle; at which he smiled, and said, a Reply was needless: and I
think so too.

Heb. 10.10.
by our Blessed Savior; and that upon the condition of Faith and Repentance.
We Article 22.
disown all Pardons and Indulgences as grounded upon no warranty of Scripture,
but rather repugnant to the Word of God; since we are told that we have nothing
1 Cor. 4.7.
but what we have received. We own that good works Article 12.
are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, but that they cannot
put away sins, and endure the severity of Gods Judgment, much less for the sins
of others: nor can Article 14.
we perform works over and above God's Commands, called by the Papists works of
Supererogation: to say which, is the highest arrogance. For when we have done
all we are commanded, Christ enjoins us to say, We are unprofitable Servants.
And we look upon our selves as righteous before God for the merit of our
Blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ by faith, Article 11, and 13.
and not for our own works and deserts.

The Romish Church owns a Purgatory Council. Trident. Sess. ult. Hence does
Bellarmine threaten us, saying, that whosoever believes not Purgatory, shall be
tormented in Hell, de Purgat. l. 1. c. ult. And yet this same Cardinal
(forgetting what he had before affirmed (for herein he does not only contradict
himself but all Popish pretensions for Purgatory, when he) grants that Souls in
Purgatory do not merit. In Purgatorio animae nec mereri nec peccare possint,
Bellarm. de Purgatorio, l. 2. c. 2. To what end then are they sent to Purgatory?
for sins pardoned, so that there still remains a guilt of temporal punishment
to be paid, either in this life or hereafter in Purgatory. Which upstart
Doctrine of Purgatory (for we shall anon show it to be so) has proved the
Mother of Indulgences and Pardons, and thereby has mightily enriched

60000 Marks besides all other payments to the Sea of Rome were yearly carried
out of this Kingdom by the Italians, being a greater revenue than our King then
had; as appears by a fruitless complaint in a Letter from the whole Nation to
the Council of Lions, Anno Dom. 1245. A round sum it was in those days before
the Indian Gold was discovered, and yet that was spent in maintaining the lust
and ambition of the Popish Clergy.

The Rise of Indulgences.
At first the Indulgences (that were) were but relaxations or releasements of
Canonical satisfaction, i. e. of the Discipline or correction of the Church. In
this sense are to be understood the first Council of Nice, c. 11. of Arles, c.
10. and of Ancyra, c. 2. But their new and chief foundation was laid by
Vnigenitus, de paenitentiis and remissionibus.
Pope Clement the sixth in his The Doctrine of Indulgences was opposed by two
famous Papists not long before the Extravagant of Pope Clement, by Franciscus
de Mayronis in 4. l. sen. did. 19. Q. 2. and by Durandus in 4. l. sen. d. 20.

punishments, or holding them as profitable for the dead,

the Sacrifice of the Mass offered (as they pretend) by the Priest is a

constant succession, cannot justly challenge: and that both from its five
vacancies, making up almost Nine years, when Rome had no Bishop at all, and the
many Schisms, by some Chronologers reckoned up to be Twenty nine (a fair number
indeed!) by Onuphrius to be Thirty, and by Bellarmin himself to be Twenty six:
Whereof the Twentieth Schism lasted Twenty years, and the 21st. lasted 36
years; during which time the Church of Rome had two Popes, which excommunicated
each other; the 26th continued, says Genebrard (Chron. l. 4.) An. Dom. 1378.

years. Baronius (ad Annum 1044. Sect. 5. Tom. 11.) calls the three Popes who
then contended for the Papal Chair, a Beast with Three heads ascending out of
the bottomless Pit. Add to these the 70 years stay of the Popes at Avignion,
which quite joints their boasted Succession. For during these times where was
the true Successor of St. Peter? Or was the Church (in their sense) so long

Marriage is honorable in all, and not forbid, but permitted, and, in Cases so
requiring, enjoined by God's Law, and practiced as well as taught by persons of

The forbidding of Marriage is
Contrary to Scripture,

That the Apostles were Married, except St. John, is Confessed by these Fathers,

Orient. p. 149.

This Heretical Doctrine of forced Celibate in Ecclesiastics, was first
established at Rome by Pope Gregory the 7th. alias Hildebrand, termed
Antichrist by Aventinus Anual Boiorum, l. 5. who tells us. That Hildebrand
confessed, when he was dying, that it was by the instigation of the Devil that
he made so great a disturbance in the Christian World. A fit Man then was he
(whom the Papists still cry up so much) to introduce unchaste Celibate, and
banish Holy Matrimony! See also Cardinal Benno (who knew him) in vita and gesta
Hildebrandi. Matthew. Westmonast. An. Dom. 1074. who says, That Hildebrand
expelled Married Priests (Mark what follows) contra Sanctorum Patrum
sententias, against the opinions of the Holy Fathers. See also Sigebert ad
Annum 1074. and Matthew. Paris ad Annum 1074.
Ancient Historians about A. D. 1074. and was first put in practice to purpose
by Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury Henry Huntington p. 378. and by Joranal

Antiq. Britan. Ed. 2. p. 118, 119.
here in England, about A. D. 1105. Dr. Burnet's Abridgement of the History of
the Reformation l. 8. p. 70, etc.
though some will have his Predecessor Lanfranc to have imposed it upon the
Prebendaries and Clergy that lived in Towns, but not without great reluctance.
For what complaints, what Tragedies, what lascivious pranks this Devilish
Doctrine occasioned, the Historians declare at large; particularly that Comical
Story of the Italian Cardinal John de Crema, Recorded by Ancient Roger Hovedon,
Henry Huntington.
Popish Historians, who, after he had entertained the English Clergy with a
fine Discourse against Marriage, was the same night caught in Bed with a Harlot
in London; as if he would only commend Virginity to others and practice the
contrary himself.

That the Reader may know, what an Age this was, wherein the Celibate of the
Clergy was established, let him hear Cardinal Bellarmin describing and
characterizing it in his Chronology. In these times (says he) wherein the
Roman Bishops did degenerate from the Piety of the Ancients (mark that!) the
secular Princes flourished in Holiness. You therefore see, that Priests
Marriage was forbidden by impious Popes.

And about the beginning of this contention, ( viz. about An. Dom. 860) the
Pope got a round check from Vdalricus or Vlric. Vdalricus (mentioned by Aeneas
Sylvius de moribus Germaniae) de Caelibatu Clerici. Nunquid enim merito communi
omnium sapientum judicio haec est violentia, etc.
a Bishop of that time, who told him, That in the judgment of all wise men, it
was to be accounted violence, when any man against Evangelical Institution
(mind that!) and the charge of the Holy Ghost, is constrained to the execution
of private Decrees. The Lord in the old Law appointed Marriage to his Priest,
which he is never read afterward to have forbidden.

But not to insist upon this clear testimomony for the Doctrine and Practice of
our Church, nor to mention the many other ill consequences of a Celibate in the
Clergy (which occasion in other Countries, where Popish Religion is publicly
professed, that Satirical Proverb to be Fills de prestre) by some of the most
eminent men in the Roman Church, and those too of a late date, it is

Confessed,

That Priesthood does not dissolve Marriage; so Cardinal Cajetan, Tom. 1.
Tract. 27.

Nor

That it is of the essence (or being) of a Priest to keep single; so Dominicus
Soto l. 7. de Jure Qu. 4.

Moreover that upstart practice in the Roman Church of Auricular Confession,
wherein Council. Trident. Sess. 14. de poenitentia.
every Christian is bound under pain of Damnation, to confess to a Priest all
his mortal Sins, which after a diligent examination he can possibly remember;
yea, even his most secret sins, his very thoughts, yea, and all the
circumstances of them which are of any moment, is a slavery as great as
groundless. Then not to mention its ill aspect upon Government, as being made
an engine of state, and a Picklock of the Cabinets of Princes, sealing up all
things from the notice of the Magistrate, but in requital of that, making a
liberal discovery of what is against him to others. A pregnant instance of
which horrid consequence was that damnable Treason designed by Gunpowder
against the Person of King James the First (of blessed Memory) and the two
Houses of Parliament, to which the Pope himself, as we Delrio disq. Magic. l.
6. c. 1.
are credibly informed, was not only privy, but its director too. Pursuant
thereof, that Pope ( Clement VIII.) a little before that time gave order, That
no Priest should discover any thing that came to his Knowledge in Confession, to
the benefit of the Secular Government.

I think there needs no better evidence of the Pope's good intentions toward
the Secular Government, nor what ill effects the practice of this sort of
Confession can and may produce than this. And, that it still may be used as an
Instrument in procuring the ruin of Princes, and subversion of Kingdoms, Let
us hear their ( i. e. the Popish) Doctors opinion of its virtue and use.

One of them (then) tells us, That the Seal of Auricular Confession (which they
hold to be of Divine Institution) is so Sacred, that it may not be broken open
to save Tolet. Instruct. Sacerd. l. 3. c. 16.
the Lives of Princes, or of the whole Commonwealth. Another Henriquez. de
poenit. l. 2. c. 19. n. 5.
goes further, and says, That the Seal of Confession is not to be broken; no,
not to save all the World.

Here the Reader may see, (for this is not only the opinion of one or two
private men, but runs with the stream of their See Eudemon Joannes in his
Apology for Garnet, Binet, Suarez, etc.
Writers) what may be expected from the Charity of their Popish Priests; what
an unlucky tool Auricular Confession is in And yet they can say, that it is of
Divine Right, See Biel l. 4. did. 17. Q. 1. and Scotus ibid. and Bonaventure
ibid n. 72. which if it had been, the Fathers would never have writ against it,
nor would it have been disanhull'd: For private Confession of crimes was a
rogated a out An. Dom. 396. upon the discovery of a Whoredom committed betwixt
a Deacon and a Noble Woman, Histor. Tripartit. l. 9. c. 35. And, though it was
practiced several years before, yet was it not enjoined as a necessary Act of
Salvation before the Council of Lateran, An. Dom. 1215. under Pope Innocent
III, and therefore far from true Antiquity!
their hands. Besides, to how great an awe of, and respect for their Confessor;
(to whom they are bound, as I have already said, to discover all their Sins
under pain of Eternal Damnation) To what Pride and Insolence, to what Lust and
Revenge, to what Avarice and Rapine are not only the meanest Men, but even
Persons that make the greatest figure, exposed unto, by Auricular Confession in
Popish Churches! It is a slavery so great and intolerable, that the
Israelitish Tasks in Egypt were a pleasure, or (at least) a divertisement in
comparison of it.

Auricular Confession to a Priest under point of Salvation and Damnation, and
that people cannot be saved without it, is
Contrary to Scripture,

Isai. 55.7. Acts 2.38, and c. 3.19. and c. 16.30, 31. Romans 10.3.

Contrary to the Fathers,

Confession before God only, or a public acknowledgment of some public crimes
incurring the censure of Excommunication, and that in an Ecclesiastical
Assembly)

confess.) And our Lord does show, that a Sinner is not cleansed by the Judgment
of the Priest; but by the Bounty of Divine Grace.

What clashing and enterfering is here? Is this the pretended solid Union of
the Popish Church in matters of Salvation, and which she enjoins under pain of
Damnation? Have they no better Grounds for their Articles of Faith than these?
Can Auricular Confession be of Divine Institution, and yet neither be
Instituted by our Blessed Savior, nor mentioned by the Fathers as a Divine
Precept, nor imposed by an Universal Tradition of the Church? And lastly, can
it be necessary to Salvation, and yet we can obtain pardon of Sins without the
use of it? Let any Papist reconcile me these, and erit mihi magnus Apollo.

SECT. X.
As I have all along showed the vast difference in Doctrines betwixt the
Protestant Church of England and the Church of Rome: so will I put a Period to
this Discourse, after I have done the like in that of Obedience: Which I shall
not (as I have hitherto) argue from the Articles and Homilies of our Church,
the Decrees of their Church, the Writings of the Fathers, and from Ancient
Councils, because that has been sufficiently canvassed of late years; but only
subjoyn the undeniable Testimonies of King James I. and King Charles the
Martyr, of ever-blessed Memories (and the Royal Grandfather and Father of our
present Gracious Sovereign) to determine the Case of

Protestants Loyalty and Popish Rebellion. King Charles I. in his Excellent
Book, entitled Eikon asilike, chap. 27. to our Late Gracious King (and then
Prince of Wales) says, King James I. in His Works, p. 504. says, The best
Profession of Religion, I have ever esteemed that of the Church of England in
which you have been educated. Yea it was but two days before his death, that he
told the Princess Elizabeth, That she should dye for maintaining the true
Protestant Religion.
In this I charge you to persevere, as coming nearest to God's Word for
Doctrine, and to the Primitive Example for Government. I tell you, I have tried
it, and after much search, and many disputes, have concluded it to be the best
in the World: keeping the middleway between the As on one part, many honest
men, seduced with some Errors of Popery, may yet remain good and faithful
Subjects; so on the other part, none of those that truly know and believe the
whole grounds and School-conclusions of their Doctrines, can ever either prove
good Christians or good Subjects. pomp of Superstitious Tyranny, and the
meanness of Fantastic Anarchy. Ibid. Scarce any one who has been a beginner or
prosecutor of this late War against the Church, the Laws and Me, was, or is a
true Lover, Embracer or Practiser of the Protestant Religion established in
England. King Charles 1st. in his Solemn Declaration, October 23. 1642. says,
That there was a greater number of Papists in the Rebels Army than in His. To
which I add (Solatii ergo) that excellent Expression in His Majesty's first and
most Gracious Speech to His Privy Council: I know the Principles of the Church
of England are for Monarchy, and the Members of it have showed themselves good
and To which may be added, That then they are guilty of this mortal Sin of
Obedience to a Protestant Prince, when they are not strong enough to manage a
Rebellion, Watson's Quodlibets, p. 255. faithful Subjects, therefore shall I
always take care to defend and support it.

These words deserve to be written in Letters of Gold; however they are written
in large Characters in good Protestants Hearts.

Now, Jude 24, 25.
Unto Him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless
before the presence of His Glory with exceeding Joy, To the only Wise God our
Savior, be Glory and Majesty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever, Amen.
