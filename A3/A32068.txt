BY THE KING.
A Proclamation of His Majesty's Grace, Favor, and Pardon to the Inhabitants
of His County of Lincoln, and of His City of Lincoln, and County of the same
City.
WHEREAS We have taken notice, that by the Malice, Industry, and Importunity of
several ill-affected and seditious Persons in Our County of Lincoln, and
City of Lincoln, and County of the same, very many of Our weak and seduced
Subjects of those Our Counties and City, have not only been drawn to
exercise the Militia. under color of pretended Ordinance, without and against
Our Consent, (a Crime of a very high nature, if We would strictly enquire
thereinto) but have made Contributions of Plate Money, and Horses, toward the
Maintenance of the Army now in Rebellion against Us; And also have raised and
gathered together armed Men in those our Counties and City, and do Muster and
Train them without Warrant or authority from Us. We do hereby publish and
declare, That We are graciously pleased to attribute the said Crimes and
Offenses of Our said Subjects of those places, to the Power and Faction of
their Seducers; Who, We believe, by Threats, Menaces, and false Informations
compelled and led them into these Actions of undutifullnesse and disloyalty
toward Us; And therefore We do hereby offer Our Free and gracious Pardon to
all the Inhabitants of our said County of Lincoln, and City of Lincoln, and
County of the same, for all offenses concerning the Premises committed against
Us, before the publishing of this Our Proclamation, except Sir Edward Ascough,
Sir Christopher Wray, Sir Anthony Irby, Knights, Thomas Hatcher, and Thomas
Grantham, Esquires, against all which We shall proceed according to the Rules
of Law, as against Traitors and stirrers of sedition against Us, and whom we
do hereby require all Our Officers and Ministers of Justice, and all Our
loving Subjects to apprehend and keep, or cause to be kept in safe custody till
Our pleasure be farther known. Provided, that this Our Grace shall not extend to
any Person who after the publishing of this Our Proclamation shall presume by
Loan, or Contribution, to assist the said Army of Rebels, to assemble and
muster themselves in Arms without Authority derived from Us under Our Hand, to
enter into any Oath of Association for opposing Us and Our Army or to succor,
or entertain any of the Persons excepted in this Our Proclamation, or in Our
Declaration of the 12th of August last. But We do declare, That whosoever shall
henceforth be guilty of the Premises, or of either of them, or shall give
obedience to any warrants concerning any Musters, Levies, or Contributions for
Levies whatsoever, under any pretense of authority whatsoever, either from the
said Sir Edward Ascough, Sir Christopher Wray, Sir Anthony Irby, Thomas
Hatcher, Thomas Grantham, or from any other Person or Persons whatsoever,
without Our express consent declared under Our great Seal or Sign Manual,
shall be esteemed by Us as an Enemy to the public Peace, a Person disaffected
to Us, and to the Religion and Laws of the Kingdom, and shall accordingly
receive condign punishment, of which We give them timely notice, that they may
proceed accordingly at their perils. And We do hereby will and require Our
high Sheriff of Our said County of Lincoln, the Sheriffs of Our said City,
all Justices of the Peace, and all other our Officers, and loving Subjects to
resist, oppose, and apprehend all such Persons as shall presume to make any
Leavies in that Our County of Lincoln, City of Lincoln, or County of the
same under what pretense soever, without Authority derived from Us under Our
Hand. And We likewise will and require them, and every of them to be assistant
to all such as shall either Command the Traine-Bands of that Our County of
Lincoln, City of Lincoln, or County of the same City, or make any Levies in
the same by virtue of Commission under Our Great Seal or Sign Manual. And
lastly our express pleasure and Command is, That this Our Proclamation be
published and Read in all the Churches and Chappells within Our said County of
