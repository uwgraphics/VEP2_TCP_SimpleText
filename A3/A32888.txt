A Christian Belief, concerning BISHOPS.
I Acts 8. 13.
Believe, 1 Timothy 3. 1.
that the Office of a Bishop is a worthy Office, and warrantable by the Word of
God, Phil. 1. 1.
approved of by the Apostles, Acts 20. 28.
and instituted of God himself: Revel. 2. 1.
having the Charge of one particular Church, Psalm. 68. 26.
or Congregation, under each of them, 2 Cor. 4. 5.
which they are Acts 20. 28.
set over, Romans 1. 15.
to feed; 2 Timothy 4. 1.
that is, to preach the Gospel to them: 1 Cor. 2. 16.
Instructing and Math. 15. 3.
Teaching them, not by the Traditions of the Fathers, 2 Timothy 3. 15.
but by the holy Scriptures, 1 Timothy 3. 2.
and showing them good Examples, by leading 2 Cor. 8. 11.
unreproovable lives, and Eze. 44. 13.
performing such offices of the Romans ^^ 7.
Ministerial Function, as becomes Isay 51. 18.
such faithful Guides; having regard to their Acts 1. 20.
Bishopric, (which is the 2 Timothy 4. 1.
great Charge of their Ephesians. 4. 11.
Pastoral Office) Hosea 7. 12.
over which they are set. And I Acts 27. 25.
believe, that our 2 Timothy 4. 10.
Praelaticall Bishops, 1 Timothy 3. 6.
who are lifted up to a Hosea 4. 18.
Ruling Power, and a 1 Peter 5. 3.
Lording Hierarchy, are 1 Thessalonians. 5. 24.
not called of God, nor of 1 Pet. 39.
Divine Institution, but 2 Thessalonians. 2. 3.
AntiChristian, Mark. 10. 42.
Ethnicall, and 2 Timothy 3. 10.
Diabolical; and 1 Timothy 4. 10.
suffered to be Acts 19. 29.
in the Church, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 4.
by the good will and pleasure of Almighty God, as a Amos 8. 11.
punishment for our sins, and a token of Gods displeasure: And therefore John
17. 9.
the people of God ought to pray, 1 Cor. 15. 24.
that they may be cast out of the Church, and only 2 Cor. 4. 5.
Preaching Presbyters may remain, to 1 Cor. 3. 14.
divide the Word of God, and open and 1 Cor. 14. 5.
interpret it to the people. And I John 2. 22.
believe, that the Romans 13. 2.
Temporal Magistrates are appointed of God, to punish sin Romans 13. 1.
upon all evil doers, whether Clergy, or Laytie; and the Government of the
Church does pertain to the 1 Timothy 5. 16.
Church, or Psalm. 58. 1.
Congregation, with the 1 Timothy 5. 19.
Laytie, and their Acts 20. 17.
assistance, and not to the sole 1 Pet. 5. 3.
Prelates.

The Church has four Offices.
First, To keep the Canonical Scriptures. Secondly, To publish the same.
Thirdly, To keep it clear from the counterfeit Apocrypha, and all ^ounterfeit
and corrupt Books. Fourthly, To make it the Rule of their Actions.
The Churches Authority does consist ^hiefely in four things.
First, To choose and ordain Ministers, according to the order of the
Apostles. Secondly, To teach by lawful Ministers, so made. Thirdly, To
minister the Sacrament by those Ministers, using su^^, time as shall be thought
most expedient for the some. Fourthly, To examine the Doctrines, whether they
be of God, or not; and that must be done by the Scriptures.

Cyprianus ad Cornaelium, Liber primus. Sacerdos Dei Evangelium tenens, and
Christa Praecepta custodiens, occidi potest, non pot^st vinci. The faithful
Believer, that will imitate Chirist the High Priest, in holding the Gospel, and
keeping the Commandments, may well be killed, but conquered he cannot be.
