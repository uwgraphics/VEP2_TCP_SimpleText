TO YOU THAT ARE CALLED ANABAPTISTS IN THE NATION OF IRELAND Teachers and
People, who profess your selves to be the Church of Christ; This is the word of
the Lord God unto You.
YOu are gathered and not in the Spirit of Jesus, nor in the Light of Christ,
nor in the power of God; you are separated but not in the truth, nor in the
ground, for the defiled and uncircumcised nature of the world stands alive in
you, and you are in the uncrucified estate, in the dominion of death, and under
the power of sin: pride, covetousness, hypocrisy, vainglory, and the works of
the flesh abound among you; to the Light in you which Christ has lightened you
with all, I do speak, which shall bear witness for me herein; and against
you in the day of the Lord which suddenly comes upon you and all the world, who
are not in the Light and power of God: you are bowing down to the Jmage in the
fained hippocrisie, of what the Saints Enjoyed and witnessed in the life and
power of God: you never came truly through the ministration of Moses which
reveals wrath upon the uncircumcised, nor you never came to the ministration
of John, who is a burning Light and brings down the mountains, and prepares
the way of the Lord before his face, but you are in your taken out observances
from the Letter, as the Jews were, but gainsayes and opposes the life of God as
they did, and in that nature you stand which put Christ to death, who does not
own the Light whereby he lights every man that comes into the world, though
him and his words and Ordinances you profess, and performs your own
Immitations, in your fleshly wills, and not the worship of God in the Spirit,
and in the truth, for the truth you are strangers too: which the devil nor the
wicked abides not in, and are alienated in your minds from the way and
council of the living God, and has but the name that you live; and are dead
in trespasses and in sins, and the Jmage of God does not live in you, and you
have but the form of godliness in your sensual understandings, in that
wisdom which is divelish; and your dead minds are exercised in the form
without the power, in vain shows in set days and in set observances,
glorying in the flesh, seeking and receiving praise of men, and is but as the
Jew, outward whose house of worship and sacrifice is left desolate and you know
not the pure moveings and leadings of the pure spirit of the Lord God to rule
you, and to teach you in the way of peace, because you do not believe in the
Light which Christ Jesus has lightened you and every man in the world withal,
but does gainsay it, and strive against it, in your high thoughts, and
Imaginations to your own condemnation in the sight of God: who are wise in your
own conceits, and Righteous in your own Eye, and measures your selves and not
with the rule of Judgment. But this is the condemnation of you, and all the
world that light is come and has shined in your dark hearts, but darkness and
the works thereof is loved rather then the light, you say you are not of the
world; but what do you differ from it, in Doctrine, or in Worship, or in
Conversation: does not pride and vanity, and self seeking, rule in many of
you? yea, to your shame might I mention the abominations which I have seen
among you; who often beheld your devotions, to the unknown God, and was an Eye
witness of your Idolitries, and even while you professed to be gathered out of
the world, you are wallowing in its filthiness, and drinking deeply of its
polutions, in envy, in wrath, and in bitterness, and in all eivill, not like
members of the body of Christ; but may justly be Judged many of you to be the
Sinagogues of Satan; who say you are members of Christ and are not, for you are
tried and are found wanting before the Lord, and your Pastors and Teachers,
they go before you and are examples in Iniquity, unto you, and are guilty of
your transgression, and you of theirs, for you hold them up, and loves to have
these things so; and they through lies, and lightness causes you to err.

And so the blind leads the blind till you both fall into the ditch of
perdition: and they may be ashamed, of you who are in ignorance, and blindness
of heart, w^o have not learned the way of truth and righteousness, nor come to
the knowledge of God; nor denied your selves and sins, and you may be ashamed
of them, who are as they that feed themselves with the fat, and not the flock,
and that through Covetousness by fained words, makes merchandise of Souls: and
goes for gifts, and rewards, as Balaam, and while they Condemn others for
hirelings, are manyfold guilty themselves therein, and to be Condemned and
Judged, with the Light of Christ Jesus; witness some of your chiefest Pastors
and Teachers, at Dublin, at Limbricke, and at Cork, and at many places else
where in Ireland; some having a hundred pounds a year, and others more or
less, to their shame let this be told, and to their Condemnation in the Light
of God, and all that know him who are hippocritticall in crieing against others
for that whereof themselves are guilty, and are an ill savor and a reproach to
some of their own Brethren; and a shame to Religion and to all that profess
faith in the Gospel of Christ; and are out of the example, of all the
Appostles and Ministers of Christ: who freely recived and freely gave, and did
not seek and receive maintenance from the powers of the Earth, but Preached
the Gospel, and lived of the Gospel, and eat of the fruit of the vinyard
which they had planted. But your Pastors are in the example of the false
Brethren, who taught for filthy Lucar and with feigned words beguiled the
simple, and while you have been zealous to pull drown the Episcopal Priests;
you have exalted your selves in their Seats, some of you in the same Temples;
with Large aditions (by oppressions) to their maintenances, and has the wages
of unrighteousness as Balaam, and goes for gifts and rewards; and is not this a
shame to you to be laid to your charge, appearing more vile in deep
hippocrisie then your predecessors, in public profaneness; to the Light in
your Consciences I speak, which shall witness this to be true in the presence
of God, who Condemns al your works and worships in that nature acted: who
worships in your Carnal minds, in the Idols temples, some of you as the
Priests of the world do, upholding the worship of the beast, under another
name, and you are as bitter and envious, in blind zeal as the profane world:
against any that differs from you in Judgment, or that comes among you to
declare the word of the Lord; witness at Dublin, Kilkenny, Cork, and else
where, where the Servants of the Lord were halled out of your Assemblies and
evil entreated, with mockings and cruel words, to your shame for ever may
this be rehearsed: who while you profess a separation from the world, are one
with it in wickedness, as in lieing, slandering, false accusing, reproaching
and promise breaking, witness at Waterford and else where; whose lies and
eivill speeches, might evidently be declared, to your shame, and of those with
many other of your Abominations, which I have seen in you, I am a witness
against, and your Iniquities are not found upon secret search only: but openly
in all those things, and hereby in the presents of the liveing God I do warn
you, of the righteous Judgments of the Just God, who has seen and taken
notice of your hippocrisie and naughtyness, and desemulation with God and Men,
and that uprightness which once was in you, have you betrayed for self ends
and earthly intrests, and have set up your selves in places of honor, and are
not in the light nor life of God, but enemies to the light of Jesus Christ;
where with he lights every man that comes into the world; and you are out of
Church order, in the confusion of your own hearts, in diverse oppinions, and not
of one heart and mind, but stumbles at the light; and rejects the foundation,
and has hearts and cannot understand: your understandings being shut up from
the knowledge of the truth, gainsaying the Council of the Lord in your
sensual wisdom, and opposing the way of truth to your own confounding,
witness at Waterford, Cork, and other places, where some of you were taken in
your own craftiness, to your shame, when you set your selves against the Lord,
and Joined your selves with the wicked, and be came one with the Priests, in
opposing the life and power of truth, as Herod and Pilot, became friends in the
persecuting of Jesus; where you uttered forth much blindness, and parverted the
Scriptures to your own Confoundings, as many can witness, now these things I
write, not altogether to shame you, but rather to reprove them in you; that you
may read and Consider, and repent and may turn from your dead Idol worship,
and hippocritticall Teachers and false ways, to serve and worship the Living
God in the newness of the spirit, and in the power of truth in it self, and
noe more may seek the Kingdom of God in observances, for it comes not with
outward observances says Christ: but the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, to
be revealed in the light and truth in all that believe in the light of the
world.

Therefore be cause you are gathered to gether, and not by the spirit of the
Lord, nor in the Light, you shall be broken and your Alters of Immittations,
and vain Traditions, shall be thrown down and you into Confusion shall be
turned, for you have the Saints words, and practices, but the life you are
without; and the spirit that gave forth the Scriptures you have not received,
with which the Scripture is only understood: but you take on things in your own
wills, and performs a sacrifice which is not regarded of the Lord.

How proud are some of you, and how vain glorious, and how covetous and self
seeking, of the glory of this world, giving and seeking honor of men, not like
members of Christ's body, but of an harlot; not like them that take up the daily
Cross of Christ, or that deny the world: but as them that seek after it; and
lays up Treasure in it, who seeks the praises of men, as much as the praise
of God; And gives and receives honor one of another; as the Gentiles, and
seeks not the honor that comes from God only; and so are out of the Covenant
of Life, and out of the bond of Peace, in strife and contention, and false
oppinions, and Judgments, and out of the power of God in the Form and
Likeness of things without Life, professing the Scriptures in the spirit of
Error, and your Ministry be gets into the form and not into the power of
Righteousness, and differs not from the ministry of the world in the ground,
but is death and reapes not the Life, to bring any unto God.

Woe unto you hippocrits, the mighty day of the Lord, is coming upon you, and
your desolation comes as an armed man, the witness of God in your Consciences
is mine, and to it I speak, it bears my voice and shall answer for me, and
against you, in the day of recompense, therefore to the light of Christ Jesus,
which he has given you, turn in your minds, your works of darkness it will
reprove and make manifest, and be not stout hearted neither count your selves
unworthy of eternal life: come down and sit in the dust, and cease from your
Idols, and from your imitations, and lay down your Crowns at the feet of
Jesus; who is the Light of the world, and lights every man that comes into
the World; if you love it* you will bring your deeds to it; it will let you see
your own Conditions, into which you are fallen from the Life of God, through
disobedience and are in the transgression and not reconciled to God; for that
enmity stands in you against him, above the seed of God, and the daily Cross
you do despise, and are in your plasures and vanities, and knows not the
Covenant of peace and rest, where the Saints dwell; wherefore bow down your
uncircumsised ear, to the Light* and let the Lord God search your hearts with
his Light, and it will discover to you the way in which you ought to walk; and
that which you ought to deny: And this Light is your way to Christ and to the
Baptism of Christ, where the clean water is received, which washes a way
Sin, and the bread of Life is received which nurisheth up unto God, and unto
eternal Life; and in the Light you will receive the true satisfaction to your
Souls, and of the Lord you will receive teaching, in the spirit from him; who
is that Minister of the Covenant of Life, and here is your way out of the
world; and into the pure separation from its ways, and works, and nature,
into the fellowship of Christ Jesus: and one with another which is in the
Light, and in the truth, which noe unclean thing has any part in; But the
Liars, and the Proud, and the Covetous, and the vain glorious, shall have
their portion in the Lake, that burns in the Indignation of God*

Wherefore, awake awake, ye that sleep in the dark night of Ignorance; Hear
ye deaf, and Look ye blind, the day of the Lord comes upon you, and the
Precious from the Vile will he separate; by his everlasting word of Judgment,
and in Love to all your Souls; This is a warning from the Lord and is the word
of the Lord God unto you, whether you will hear or forebeare, and with the
Light in all your Consciences, this shall be witnessed when your Judgment is
read, and remember you are warned in your life time.

By a friend and Lover of all your Souls, but a witness against all your
deceits. E: BVRROVGH.
