(...) Or, the Medical Expositer, in an Alphabetical Order; with a Division of
Man's Body into its several Parts, with their various Names, and the Diseases
they are subject to: in Latin, Greek and English, for the Benefit of all
Physicians, Chyrurgeons, Apothecaries. By J Case, M. D.

TO THE INGENIOUS Mr. Thomas Tryon.
SIR,
THERE were two things that influenced me in this Dedication: the first, that
this little Treatise might have the Honor of venturing abroad into the World,
under the Protection of some Guardian Name: the other, that I my self might
have an Opportunity of gaining Acquaintance with a Person, whom I have long
since Admired and Respected.

The many Useful and Learned Books, you have generously blessed the World with,
have established to you a just and everlasting Reputation: especially that
excellent Treatise, called, The Way to Long Life, Health and Happiness, which I
confess, at the very first Reading, obtained a double Victory; at once subdued
my Reason, and engaged my Affections.

Upon this account, SIR, it is, that I have assumed the Confidence of placing
you at the Front of the ensuing Discourses, not to Entitle you to the Patronage
of my Defects and Imperfections; but to Defend and Secure what shall appear
Rational, Useful and Honest, against the petulant Assaults of those who are
least able to Judge: Under the Shield of your Countenance and Approbation, I
contemn and despise the Snarling, Impotent Censures of Ignorant and Invidious
Critics.

The Subject Matter of these Essays, cannot be strange to You: the whole Stream
and Course of your Writings, affording evident and undeniable Instances of a
true Philosophical Genius, and of no ordinary Proficiency in Mathematical and
Astrological Speculations.

If there be any thing advanced in this Attempt, trespassing upon the Humor of
established Rules and received Maxims, it is to be considered, that all my
Notions are purely Hypothetical, not asserting any thing Positively and
Magisterially, but only offering my honest Endeavors, toward the Improvement
or Illustration of an useful and necessary Science. And I faithfully promise,
to renounce every Part of it, that shall be convicted, to entrench upon the
Privilege of good Manners and Christianity.

SIR, I shall not further interrupt you in your more Weighty Concerns, but
humbly beg leave to submit the Whole to your Perusal, and better Judgment.

SIR, I am Your most Obedient, and most Obliged Servant, John Case.

TO THE Candid and Unprejudiced READER.
Generous Reader,
I Shall have no occasion to Apologize beforehand, either for the height of
the Subject, or the manner of handling this Work; when the Argument of every
Part, can speak for the one, and a direct Proceeding in the Course proposed,
for the other.

Who Builds in the Way, where all pass by,
Shall make his House too low, or high.
I have exposed my self a Subject to many Censures, and entreat the Reader not
to undertake me with any sinister Prejudice; for my hope is, if he should
faithfully trace me in that modest and careful Course, which I have exposed to
your view, you may say in the Conclusion, Facilior currentibus quam reptantibus
lapsus; for, I profess my self to be so free from all Arrogance and
O^^entation, that, Ut caveam timendo, tu^a pertimesco. My Juvenilia, I must
confess) are suitable to my weak Understanding or Youthful Thoughts, in these
three great undertakings, viz. concerning God, and the Creation, with the Egg
of Generation: if you find it does not agree with your Philosophical Notions,
refer it to my Instability, and that I may grow older, and I hope wiser. Pray
remember that wise Sentence of Sophocles, Si Juvenis luxuriat, peccat; si
Senex, insanit: not forgetting that of Seneca, the wise Philosopher, Ante
senectutem cavendum been vivere; in senectute been mori.

Concerning the Creation of the World.
Upon due and serious Contemplation of the Creation, I have proposed to you a
new Method thereof, and have ventured to Rencounter the first Chapter of
Genesis; because my Sentiments and Thoughts tell me, that he that created all
things, did it in a moment, and not in 6 days, as Moses tells you; for many
substantial and grounded Arguments, which may not be proper for me to
demonstrate here in my Epistle, only one thing which is to come, (according to
the Scripture,) That the World shall have a an end in a moment, and in the
twinkling of an eye; so sudden should be our Change, from the sleep of Death to
Immortality.

There is the same likelihood, and the same probability, that it was created in
a moment; for El^him was, is, and will be for ever the same.

Now witty Reader, I have not tied you up to my Belief, but have led you
through a wide Field of the Mosaic^l Philosophy, because you shall see the
clash^g of the Scriptures in, as the Waves of the Sea; and the Opinion of
Authors, like the four Winds, which blow where they list.

But methinks, I hear a Voice asking me, What reason is it, that so many
contrary Opinions concerning Philosophy, should rise in this World? or how the
multitude of Dictates that the Microcosm has, should have a true Apprehension
of the Macrocosm?

Reader, I must do as Men before me have done, i. e. to return you a
Parabolical Answer, by way of Supposition. Suppose that a Man of a wonderful
Wisdom and Understanding, had for a considerable time enjoyed a glorious
polished Globe, all full of Life, called, Nosce te ipsum, comprehending the
whole Man, both outward and inward, being the little World, and consequently
the great World also; having them thus both together, and represented in one
and the same Subject, which he having offered to Men for their Instruction in
Wisdom: then he upon their neglect and contempt of it, broke it into many
Pieces, which a Woman out of pity, received into her Lap; for as much as she
knew, that there was yet Life in them, and that by being united, they would
come to Life again, as before: whereupon she searched throughout the World for
such Wise Men, who by a due joining of the said Parts, were able to restore its
whole former Life; in which Search, she indeed met with many curious Wits and
serious Persons. But yet as to the main Business, she came about, could return
her nothing but bare and empty words, (they never having opportunely tried or
experienced, how to perform the same,) and thereupon fell into a necessity of
convention and confusion about Words, or contend^ about the Matter among
themselves; from Whence they fought stoutly with their Pens and To^s against
one another; notwithstanding that all of them owned the same common Name of
Philosophers; and the desire of this seeking Woman was not satisfied.

The like I may say, if I take a piece of Lignum Vitae, and cut out of it
thousands of Chips, and summ^n all the Mercurialists of the World to unite the
scat^red Chips into their solid Body again; you would judge it (as
beforementioned) a laboring with their Tongues and Pens, and none be able to
pick out the right Method.

Kind Reader, although I have presented a New Speculum Mundi, never published to
the World before, which are my Sentiments and Thoughts; neither can I find,
that Moses ever had the knowledge of the Creation of the World.

I have now delineated to your Eyes, the first Form thereof, how every thing
sprung out of the Abyss, when the Word was given; how Light and Darkness were
separated into Forms, by the great Spygarick Powers, ascended out the Spiritual
Powers of the Abyss, and formed the Canopy of the Heavens; and from the innate
Heats within, sprung forth the glorious Lights, viz. Sun, Moon and Stars.

I question not, but that I may have many croaking Frogs of Egypt, lifting up
their Tongues and Pens against me, or this my Opinion; though indeed, it may be
endless, and senseless too. Not that I would go about to deny, but that some
fault may be found, and properly to be attributed to my self, for want of Skill
and Capacity, in reference to this Subject.

And without doubt, Reader, you may be desirous to be directed in the true way,
to find out the Mystery of the Creation. But in fine, I have another way of
directing you to the true Method, viz. to seek to him who is called Theos, for
your Knowledge and Understanding; for by him all things were made.

Concerning the Human Eggs of Generation.
There are many Authors have spoken something of the Eggs of Women, as is too
copious here for me to nominate; giving you as it were, a hint or a glance of
this great Work of Generation, but have hitherto left you in Darkness, and have
not given you the plain Demonstration thereof: But here, I have produced to
your view, the whole Work in a large Figure, insomuch that it will make it
very easy to your Understanding, or to Reason it self.

The whole Work being laid down so plain; first, you may see the Rude, or
Oviary Lump, having many small things, like the Spawn of a Hering, which are
called Eggs; the Seed or Sperm of Man being cast on them, breaks them, or we
may say, separates one from the other, and falls into a Cavea, that Nature has
provided, as this Instrument of mine directs you; wherein may be seen the
Growth or Increase thereof, every three VVeeks, or Month; first, in the Form of
Benes, before Flesh is; then in the second Figure, you will see an Increase of
Flesh, and how it comes to Perfection. The Birth of Man is also wonderful to be
considered; for first, he was in his Mothers Womb before he was this Embryo,
or Poelus; whether three Bubbles, or some rude and indigested Lumps, or a
Conception, according to some Writers.

As for Example, a Man was first a Boy, because from a Boy he grew up to be a
Man; before he was a Boy, he was in Infant, and before an Infant, an Embryo.

The same way by which we gain an Art, by the very same we (...) any kind of
Science or Knowledge whatsoever: for as Art is a Habit, whose Object is
something to be done; so Science is a Habit, whose Object is something to be
known: and as the former proceeds from the imitation of Examples, so this
latter from the Knowledge of things Natural.

By the Words of Aristotle, it evidently appears, by what Order the Knowledge
of any Art or Science is a tained; namely, by sense there remains an Impression
of the thing perceived; by that Impression is made a remembrance of it, and
from multiplied Memory, proceeds Experience.

These then may satisfy, that by Diligence and Industry, a Man may arrive to a
considerable pitch of Knowledge of the Human Eggs of Generation, or the Birth
of Mankind.

Give me leave therefore, to whisper this to thee, (friendly Reader,) that thou
be sure to weigh all that I have delivered in this Exhortation, touching the
Generation of Living Creatures, in the steady Scale of Experience, and give no
longer credit to it, than thou perceivest it to be securely bottomed on the
faithful Testimony of thy own Eyes: this very thing did Aristotle advise us to;
for so far only is Reason to be relied upon, as those things which are
demonstrated, agree with those things which are perceived by Sense.

Now to remove all prejudice that may accrue to me, Reader, I have not called
this the absolute Invention of my own, because I had some footsteps toward it
by former Authors, as Hieronymus, Fabrioius ab Aquapendente, etc. and also many
late Authors have hinted, or proposed such things, as Women having Eggs, but
was never yet so plainly demonstrated to the meanest Capacity, as this my
Instrument will explain it at large.

Concerning the Lot of Man, in his Elementary Life.
To you that are wise and discreet, few words may suffice; for such a one
judges not at the first, nor reproves by hearsay, but patiently hears, and
thereby increases in Understanding; which Patience brings forth Experience,
whereby true Judgment is directed.

I shall not need therefore, to make any further suit to you, but entreat you
to read the Third and Fourth Part of my Book, without prejudice; and having
obtained this at your hands, I submit my self unto your Censure; hoping that
you will consider the Method of the whole Book, viz. 1. Of God, and the
Creation. 2. Of Man's Creation; and then after Man is come into the World,
it is natural to all, to be inquisitive about future Events, or their Lotts or
Chances in this Elementary Life, whether they are born for Great, Mean, an
Small Fortune.

I have presented to thee, pure and undesiled Rules, far beyond the Rules of
Astrology in many things, and far easier and pleasanter to your Understanding,
formerly lying a long time in Darkness, and under a scandalous Name or Title,
called Geomancy and Magic, etc. by the common and vulgar People, who take the
sense of the Words a wrong way. So do many condemn the things, that they do
not understand.

But because of the stupidity of most of this present Age, I will unfold to you
this dreadful Word. Observe, Magic it self, which the Ancients did so
divinely contemplate, is scandalized, with hearing the Noise of all Diabolical
Sorceries; which Art (says Mirandula,) Pauci Intelligunt, multi Reprehendunt;
and sicut Canes, ignotos semper allatrant. Few understand, many reprehend; and
as Dogs, bark at those they know not.

Many there are that abhor the very Name and Word Magus, or Simon Magus, who
being indede not Magus, but Gos, viz. familiar with evil Spirits, usurped that
Title. But Magic and Witchcraft are far different Sciences: where Pliny being
ignorantly scoffed thereat; for Nero (says Pliny, lib. 30. Not. Hist.) who had
the most excellent Magicians of the East, sent him by Tiridates King of
Armenia, who held that Kingdom by him, found out the Art, after a long Study
and Labor, which I now call Lotts.

Now Witchcraft and Sorcery, are quite contrary, being the Works of the Devil.

But Magus is expressed, such a one as is conversant in the Service of God, his
Ordinances, etc. as Plato affirms, that the Art of Magic is the Art of
Worshipping God, as when the Wise Men came to Worship Christ; and this is the
first Kind, which is called Divine Magic.

Secondly, The Latins did entitle them Sapientes, or Wise Men. Thirdly, The
Greeks call them Philosophers. Fourthly, The Egyptians were termed Priests.
Fifthly, The Hebrews termed them Cabalists, Prophets, Scribes and Pharisees.
Sixthly, The Babylonians, they were called by the Name of Caldeans. Seventhly,
By the Persians, Magicians.

So the Word Magus, of it self, imports a Contemplation of Divine and Heavenly
Sciences. But under this Name, are all unlawful Arts comprehended, as
Negromancy and Witchcraft; and all for want of its true Name or Title, viz.
Malefici or Venefici, Sorcery, or Poysoners. These are the true Names of
Witchcraft or Sorcery.

Seeing it is so, that Magic is a Divine Science, pray Reader, let me go under
the same Denomination; for the second Kind of Magic is Astrology, or these my
Lotts, being nothing but Signs and Planets, and no Conjuration in it, according
to the vulgar Saying, but a pure undefiled Science, which judges of the Events
of things to come, Natural and Human, by the Motions and Influences of the
Stars, upon these lower Elements, by them observed and understood.

Philo Judaeus affirms, that by this Part of Magic, or Astrology, together
with the Motions of the Stars, and other Heavenly Bodies, Abraham found out the
Knowledge of the true God, while he lived in Chaldea: qui contemplatione
creaturarum, cognovit Creatorem, (says Damascen,) who knew the Creator by the
Contemplation of the Creature. Josephus reported of Abraham, that he instructed
the Egyptians in Arithmetic and Astrology, who before Abraham came to them,
understood none of these Sciences.

Abraham sanctitate and sapientia omnium praestantissimus primum Caldaeos,
deinde Phoenices, demum Aegyptios Sacerdotes, Astrologia and Divina docuerit.
Abraham the wisest and holiest of Men, did first teach the Caldeans; then the
Phenicians; and lastly, the Egyptian Priests, Astrology and Divine Knowledge.

Without doubt, Hermes Trismegistus, that Divine Magician, who (as some say,)
lived long before Noah attained to much Divine Knowledge of the Creator, through
the Study of Magic and Astrology, as his Writings testify to this day.

The third Kind of Magic contains the whole Philosophy of Nature, which brings
to light the inmost Virtues, and extracts them out out of the hidden Bosom of
Nature, to human use; according to the Chemical Method of these sorts in Old
Time, was, Albertus Arnoldus de Villa Nova, Raymond, Bacon, and others.

I must expect some Calumnies and Obtrectations against this way of Writing,
from the malicious prejudiced Man, and the lazy Affecters of Ignorance, with
which this Age swarms; but I incite the Reader to a charitable Opinion thereof,
with a Christian Protestation of an innocent Purpose therein; for the thing it
self is harmless, as a Lot or Lotts. You read of in the Scripture, the Lot
fell on Jonah, and they cast Lotts for the Garment of our Savior Christ, etc.

So I do entreat the Reader to follow the advice of Fabius, Qui litigant, sint
ambo in conspectu tuo nocens and reus; if there be any Scandal in this Work of
mine, it is taken, and not given: And this comfort I have, in that Axiom of
Trismegistus, Qui pius est, sum Philosophatur. Therefore I present it without
Disgust, to all of candor and indifferency.

There are four sorts of Readers. First observe, Spunges, which attract all,
without distinction or distinguishing; Hour-glasses, which receive, and pour
out as fast; secondly, Baggs, which retain only the (...)

DULL is the Muse, when Men are forced to Climb,
And Scale Parnassus to compel a Rhyme,
To Cloth and Countenance the generous Love,

These Two excel the Best that they can do.

A ready Path to Fame, and leave them far behind.

THE ELEMENTARY Life of Man.
CHAP. I.
The Divine Attributes, consisting of Eternal Nature.

BEfore we speak of the Center, or the Circle of the Life of Man, we must
consider the Matrix, which is the Center and Essence of all Essences; all
things are generated out of the Center, and out of that which is Generated, all
things are Created which are in being. The ground how the Eternal Word was in
the Beginning, and the Word is Gods, and the Eternal Will is that Word: for the
Eternal God has that Will in himself, and in that recomprehended Will is the
Eternal Father of all things, the Eternal Deity has its name God, for God and
the Will has no Maker; for he made himself from Eternity to Eternity.

Ex ipso, per ipsum, and in ipso sunt omnia: Of him, by him, and in him are all
things.

Before we dive into the Bottomless Abyss of the Essential Philosophy, we must
consider, that God is the true Wisdom and Foundation thereof. Sapientiam
possidet^ Deus in principium viaram suarum, antequam quicquam faceret a
principio; ab Aeterno ordinata est; concepta erat cum nondum erant Abyssi; did
possess Wisdom in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing; from
Eternity was she ordained; she was conceived where there was no Abyss.

Sapientia a Deo profecta est, and prior omnium: Created Wisdom comes from God,
and was the first that Created all things.

I do imagine, and my mind gives me, that although I be never so curious in my
Endeavoring or Labor in this matter of my Expression, yet will my best
Endeavors appear faulty in the curious Eyesight of some Men, though perchance
acceptable enough to others.

1. In the Beginning the Word of the Eternal Spirit created the Heavens and the
Earth. 2. And the Earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the
face of the deep, and the Eternal Spirit moved upon the face of the Waters. 3.
The Word said, Let there be Light, and there was Light. 4. The Word saw, that
the Light was good; and the Word separated the Light from the Darkness. 5. The
Word called the Light Day, and the Darkness he called Night. 6. And the Word
said, Let there be a Firmament in the midst of the Waters, -- and divide the
Waters from the Waters: And the Firmament was called Heaven. And the Word
said, Let the Waters under the Heaven be gathered together, and let the dry
Land appear.

Seeing this Great Work of the Creation is not a matter of Faith, I leave the
literal Sense of the Book of Genesis, and give you liberty to conjecture of
mine of the Creation, or the great Spagyrick Work.

In Contemplating on the first of Genesis, and then from the Words of God
himself, I have a strong fancy, that God made that wonderful Fabric, viz. the
Whole Universe, by a powerful Command or Word, in a moment of time, and not as
Moses says, in six days: mind Job 38. v. 4. Ubinam eras quum fundarem Terram?
indica, si novisti Intelligentiam.

Quum canerent simul Stellae Matutinae, and cum vociferati sunt omnes filii
Dei, ver. 7.



For, what may we hence conjecture, but that the Angels, Coche Boker, Stars of
the Morning, and Beni Elohim, the Sons of God, beholding so great a Miraculous
Wonder, together with their own as wonderful, formerly commanded at such an
instant into a glorious Being, gave Shouts of Praise, and Acclamations of Joy,
in Admiration of the great Creator's Omniporency: And we find the Voice of God
descending, or delivering the Story of his incomprehensible Wonders with such a
lofty Brevity, that we may well believe, he performed those Wonders with the
same swiftness that he spoke them.

Reason I.
It is an absurdity to say, That God created the World with distance of Time;
first, for then the Act it self could not be properly said creare, but facere,
to make. If we do but consider, that Creation is not only to raise a thing out
of nothing, but to make it also without time, which is an infinite Omnipotency
only to be attributed to God, who acts al^ things in a Moment, and cannot be
bound to Time.

Reason II.
It is an absurdity to assert, that Time should be before Time it self; for
Time is the Measure of Motion begun, but with the Motion of the Sun, Moon and
Stars.

Now, according to the litteral sense in Genesis the Firmament which God called
Heaven, was created the second Day, but the Sun, Moon and Stars, were not
created till the fourth Day.

Now then, could there be Days and Nights which are nothing but Time, before
Time it self?

Observation I.
Philo Judeus upon this Point, says, It Is a simplicity too gross and rustic to
believe, that the World was created in six Days, or in a certain time; and,
what think you of the two places in Genesis? First, it is said, In the
Beginning, God created Heaven and the Earth. Then in the second place, it is
said, That the Heavens were not created till the second Day, and the Earth till
the third Day.

Observation II.
It Is strange incoherence in the two verses, concerning the Creation of Light;
there seem to have been two Days spent, which is an Indecorum to imagine, that
after the Word it self had commanded, Let there be Light; do you not believe,
That that Word or Command, had not been sufficient to create Light, etc.

Reason III.
Seeing that Faith does not bind us to believe otherwise, it is the most
rational Conjecture, that by the first Light, was meant the Light of the Sun,
Moon and Stars, etc.

Reason IV.
Observe the Text it self, which says, In the beginning of the Work, God
created the Heavens and the Earth, that is to say, in giving Form to the dark
Abyss or Lump, and created the Light; and in verse 3. it tells us, That the
Light was created before either.

Reason V.
Which is from the contrariety of the litteral Description, which allows four
Days for the Creation of the Light, the Heavens, the Earth, and Luminaries. And
in the next Chapter, we have these words: These are the Generations of the
Heavens and the Earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God
made the Heavens and the Earth. Now you see, it is but one Day, and before, it is
said to be four days.

Reason VI.
It Is said, That the World shall have an end in a moment, and in the twinkling
of an Eye. So sudden should be our Changes from the sleep of Death to
Immortality: there is the same likelihood and the same probability, that it was
created in a moment. Since it is created, and its End depends both upon the
same Cause, which is God, who still acts without circumstance or distinction of
Time.

Observation VII.
Man was created in a moment with the rest, etc. but on the contrary by the
Prophet Ezekiel, speaking to the King of Tyrus; Thou have been in Eden (says
he) in the Garden of God. And now observe speedily after, The Workmanship of
thy Drums and thy Flutes, was prepared in thee in the day that thou was
created. This may give you a strong belief, that Man, and the Creatures which
were made for his sake, were all created the same Day: Then much more in
compliance with our Belief, than with the litteral Description of the first
Chapter of Genesis.

Now I have a Question to answer, and that is, What is the meaning or reason,
that the first Chapter of Genesis is so expressed?

I shall in this point give you the opinion of Procopius; he says, That Author
might accomodate himself to the feebleness and rudeness of humane
Understanding, which is so incapable of the Mystery of Generation, being so
high and difficult, that the Hebrews anti^ntly would not permit it to be read,
but by aged Persons, or such as were of a good Understanding; and this same
premeditated compliance of the Writer, with means of human Capacity, etc. So we
may conclude, That the whole was no more than a conjectural Moral, compiled by
Moses or the Lawgiver, the more deeper to fix in the mind of his People, a
Veneration of his intended Sabbath: so Divinity necessitated for a separate Day
of Holy Worship, and so particularly necessary for the reparation of human
Nature, spent with continual Toil and Labor. It Is not to be thought on, that
he which made the whole Universe by a Word, could want rest from his Labor.
St. Jerome and Masius were the greatest Interpreters of the Bible; and 'twas
never found in the Pentateuch of the Bible, that God did ever dictate to Moses
the Creation of the World, but the Ten Commandments. God created Man in his own
Image, Male and Female: At that time Eve was not made, nor no News of her till
the next Chapter; and she must have the Command of not eating the forbidden
Fruit, before she had a Being, or not at all.

Now we have given you, as it were, the Speculum of the whole Work, I will give
you a glance of the whole Universe.

In the first place, lift up your Eyes, and behold the Glory at the upper part
of the Figure, where you may see the Hebrew Letters, which is in our English
Letters Jehovah; which is, that Word or Spirit which made all things, and spoke
the Word, and it was finished: He rules all, and is above all, and gave himself
a Name, and revealed himself to us, and said, I am the Lord thy God, etc. else
we should never have known what Name or Title to have given him.

Duw, in Welsh or British. Godd, in Old English and Scotch. Dodd, in Saxon and

And in another place God said, I am what I am.

So much concerning God, or the Word, or him that made all things out of the
Abyss; and as for any further Demonstration or Knowledge, I must leave it till
longer time, or until I can understand or am informed, how long the Chaos or
Abyss, was before the Great Spagyrick Powers made so great a Fabric as the
Heavens and the Earth.

The next thing to Admiration, is the dark Lump unshaped, which is called the
Chaos or Abyss, from whence all proceeded.

By way of Resemblance, behold how the Sun, Moon and Stars leap out with their
Streams from the deformed Lump; when the Word was given, it made a Separation
in distinct Natures, just as the Chemist does separate the spirital part from
the Caput Mortuam.

Now you must know, that the 7 Planets are the 7 Rulers of the World, by their
different Natures, and are God's Instruments, as you shall be informed in
another place.

Now out of those 7, God has chosen one of them to put his Tabernacle in, that
is the Sun.

Behold one Wonder more, viz. The Lines or Streams which are drawn, or come
from the Abyss or Chaos to the 7 Properties of Nature. You will find two Ranks
of Stars getting out of the Streams, except and, and they but one, which
signifies and tells you, That they are the Stars or Houses (as the Astrologers
call them) wherein the Planets delight, being made or generated out of the same
Metal or Foeces, etc.

Example. Behold the Line of, you will see one Ra k of Stars in one side of the
Stream, and so on the other side, which may be called and, the Houses of, and
so of the rest, the and but one House, etc.

The Blewness, or that we call Sky, was condensed with Fumes or Spiritual Parts
of the Abyss, and kept up by the 4 Winds, as will appear by Reason in another
place.

The last Wonder is, The World finely adorned and beautified, and also Adam in
Paradise; all made and created by one Word or Command of God: and here the
Philosopher calls Man the Little World, and the other the Great World, viz.
Microcosmus and Macrocosmus: and also they say, That the World has three
Divisions, viz. Sublunary, Celestial and super-Celestial.

Now to define unto you what the World is called, viz. Mundus, or the World in
the Hebrew Tongue, Holam, which implies thus much:

Quoniam per aliquot secula subsistat, in quo rerum ^rtus and interitus sit.



Which is to subsist and continue for certain Ages, in which shall be the Death
and Destruction of all things. The Greek calls it Cosmos, which imports
Ornament; which the Latin for perfect and absolute Elegancy call Mundus,
because there is nothing mere neatly polished and beautified with all
Creatures. So says Plin. Possidonius in Metr. That Mundus, or the World, which
consists of Heaven, Earth, Celestial and Terrestrial Natures, or of Gods and
Men, and those Things which were created to their use: some call the World
Munaus, quasi Ornatus Mulieris, A Woman's Ornament. But in short, the World is a
fine thing.

CHAP. II.
The Beginning in general; how they were produced and extracted out of Nothing,
according to the Mosaical Philosophy, and what is meant by the word Nothing;
then the first Principle, which is the dark Abyss or Chaos, without Form.

1. OBserve the Words of the most Excellent (...) (...) (...) (...) paration of
the Divine Spirit, Elohim was effected in the 6 days work of the Creation; it is
expressed there, That Darkness was upon the face of the Abyss.

2. And that Terra erat inanis and vacuum, the Earth was without shape and
form; a plain demonstration, that the Heavens and the Earth were not as yet
made, or in no Form; were one deformed Lump, or rude and indigested Mass; and
all comprehended in one dark Abyss.

3. St. Augustine compares this Nothing unto a Speech; for while it is in the
mind of the Speaker, it is nothing to him that is spoken to, before it is spoken.
Plato compares it to a Dream, when a Man awakes, it is nothing but Imagination.
But consider well, there are none, unless on Presumption or Ignorance, will be
of the opinion, that in those words, God made all things of nothing, ex Nihilo,
of nothing; it ought not to be interpreted Nothing.

4. For the first Essence and Matter of all Things was from all Eternity in
God, and with God, one and the same thing; and this we prove by ^^^ipture; says
Moses, In principio creavit Deus Coelum and Terram.

5. Principium is not to be taken as a negative Nothing: for in plain Terms,
that ex ipso, and per ipsum, and in ipso sunt omnia; Of him, by him, and in
him, are all things proceeding from the Creator.

6. Hermes has it, Infinita in Abysso, Aqua insuper and Sp^ritus tenuis
intellectualis per Divinam potentiam in Chaos inerant: There was (says he) an
infinite Shadow upon the Abyss, also Water and a thin intellectual Spirit: we
are in the Chaos by the Divine Puissance. Now that there was a contained Water
and airy Spirit complicitly, where in the dark Chaos or Abyss, it appeared by
the Revolution of the Waters, upon the which Elohim the Eternal Spirit was
created.

By this you may discern, what the Substances of Beginnings of Things was,
namely, the dark Abyss.

7. Observe now, that this generated Matter was Water, which the Presence of
the all-informing Spirit of the Lord did vigorate and enact in a Generality,
and termed them by the name Shamaim, and that the Waters were the first Matter
and Principle of which the World was made; no otherwise than out of a rude Mass
or Lump, a great Palace is fashioned or framed. This Moses confirms, first,
for that it does mention the Water from which the Spirit of God was created,
after he had nominated the confused Chaos under the Title of the dark Abyss;
and Terra inanis and vacua, or the void and deformed Earth, and that before the
first days Separation; whereby it is plainly argued, that Water was the material
Principle, created or inacted by Elohim Ruache; for as much as they were
nominated before the first days work.

8. That it was the Eternal Wisdom or Spirit Elohim, who acted as it were the
part of a Midwife, did deliver and bring forth this Birth, and gave it Act and
Form; as Moses says, That the Waters were the subject of that Separation, and
was effected by the Spagyrick or Fiery Virtue of the Word, or Elohim.

9. The Heavens above were made of the purest Brights, and most worthiest
Waters, and the Elementary World beneath, of the grossest dark fort of Water;
and that there was a middle kind of them, which participating of both extremes,
was termed the Firmament, whose main Office was, to divide and separate the
Water from the Waters.

10. Then out of the lower Waters, by the same Word or Spirit, three several
Regions, namely, the Air, the Seas, and the dry Land; so the World, and every
Member thereof, was out of this humid Spirit or aquatick Nature, which is
visible by this Text; Coeli (says he) erant prius and Terra, de Aqua and per
Aquam existentes, verbo Dei.

11. The Heavens was Fire, and the Earth Water; and by Water existing in, and
by the Word, the World is composed only of Heaven and Earth: and therefore it
follows, that the whole World is made, and existeth of the Water, and by the
Water. So it is evidently proved, that the Original Maker of all things was
Water.

12. The next thing I show you, how all things were fashioned, formed and
reduced into a specific Act, and essential Being.

It first distinguished, and separated the Darkness from the Light, and obscure
and gross Water from the subtle or pure, and then it disposes the Heavens into
Spheres.

13. It divides the gro^^est Waters into sublu^ary Elements: but observe in
these Lines the great Work: -- Mundum ex materia infor^i creavit: Revelat
fundamenta, and abscondita, ^ovit in tenebris constituta, and Lux est cum co;
^evelavit fundamenta e tenebris, and educit in lu^em ^mbram lethalem; Aquilon^m
extendit su^er inane, and vacuum, and suspendit Terram su^er nihilum: nam
sapientia ab ore ejus prodeunte, ^otundit at em Coelorum circumveniente sola,
and in ^rofundo abyssi ambulante, omnia fecit Deus. Ad^rat ipsa quando
prepar^avit Coelum, quando certa ^ege and gyro velavit abyssos; quando Aethera
fir^abat sursum, erat ipsa cum eo cuncta componens: ^psa fundavit Terram,
stabilivit Coelos, erupit a^yssos, ^^bes rore concrescere facit; aptat pondus
^Aeri, appendit Aquos in mensura, dedit pluviae sta^uta, and viam fulgetro
tonitruum: Coelos crea^at, and extendebat eos, firmabat T^rram, and quae
^erminant ex ea; Sapientia creavit Deus terram, and stabilivit Coelos
prudentia; facit ut oriatur lu^en in Coelis indeficienter; and sicut nebula
tegit om^em Terram: facit anni cursus, and constituit dis^ositus Stellarum.
Facit Arcturum and Orionem: ^onvertit in mane tenebras, diem in noctem mutat;
^acat aquas maris, and effundit eos super faciem ^errae: preparavit terram in
aeterno tempore, and ^eplevit eam bipedibus and quadrupedibus: ipsam ^ffudit
Dens super omnia opera ejus, and super omnem ^rnem secundum datum; ipsa denique
operatur ^nia, and Deus per ipsam operatur omnia in om^ibus, and ipse vivificat
and animat omnia, ut Apo^olus: Quare Propheta recte, in sapientia omnia ^isti,
repleta est terra possessione tua, etc.

Wisdom created the World of Matter, without Form; she revealed the Foundations
of t^ deeoest, and discovers the things that were h^ in Darkness, and Light
is with her: she make^ the Foundations appear out of Darkness, an converteth
the deadly Shadow into Light: s^ spreads forth the North upon the void (...)
empty Face of the Abyss, and hangs the Eart^ on nothing: for God made all
things by h^ Wisdom, which came out of his Mouth; at compassed about the
Circuit of the Heavens, a^ walked in the profoundness of the Abyss: s^ was
present when he prepared the Heavens, a^ he covered by a certain Law or
Compass, the Abyss, when he established the Heavens (...) Ether, all the
Regions above; then was S(...) with him, as the Composer of all those things
she laid the Foundations of the Earth, and fa^ ned the Heavens, and broke up
the Abyss, a^ made the Clouds together in a Dew: she ga^ Weight to the Air: she
hanged or ballan^ the Water or Clouds by measure: she gave (...) to the Rain
its Law, and ordered the way to (...) Lightning or Thunder: she created the
Heavens, and spread them abroad: she fastened (...) Earth, and made things to
grow on it, and es^ blished the Heavens by his Providence: (...) causes an
indeficient Light to rise and app^ in the Heavens, and she covered it as it
were with a Cloud, the whole Earth: she makes (...) Causes of the Year, and
institutes the Disposition or Nature of the Stars: she made the Pole Star and
Orion, and turned Darkness into t^ Morning, and changed the Day into Night: she
calls the Waters of the Sea, and pours them upon the Face of the Earth: she
had prepared the Earth for Eternity, and filled it with twofooted and
four-footed Creatures; God poured her forth upon all Flesh in a divine Measure:
to conclude, she operateth and gives all things, as Solomon says.

We should speak something of the two main Principles, viz. Heat and Cold: All
Heat whatsoever does attract and draw unto it, the Vapors and Humidity of the
Earth and Water, etc. We find the contrary by a Weather-Glass; for in only
laying the warm Hand upon the Glass, the Air dilates its self immediately, and
is so far from being attracted by the Heat, that contrariwise it flies away
from the Hand. These two Principles will lead me into a larger Field, than I
shall be able to go through in this small Tract; therefore I shall forbear.

14. But to speak something of the Universal Mystery of Rarifaction and
Condensation; for it is proved, that by them the whole World was made, the
Heavens fashioned in due order, and the Universal Elements altered, and changed
after a Quadruple manner and condition.

15. The divine Philosopher Hermes says, Men's ab essentia Dei nequaquam
divisa, sed ille potius eo modo connexa quo Solis corpori Lumen: The mental
Beam is not at all divided from the Essences of God, but rather joined and knit
unto him, after the same manner that the Light is continued unto the Sun;
whereupon it is evident, that the virtue of Heat is essential unto Light, as the
act of Motion is never absent from emanating Brightness.

16. We may conclude then, that the Rarifaction is nothing else but the
dilating of Water by Heat, which was first contracted by Cold; and Condensation
on the other-side, is a contraction, or sucking and drawing of those watery
Parts, which were dilated or separated by Heat; so that the subject of both of
those Actions is Water, and the Foundation as well of the privative as positive
Agent: the Nolunty or Volunty, that is to say, the Negative or the Affirmative
Will of that one Eternal Unity, who is that allinforming and operating Spirit,
which act his Pleasure in all and over all, by his divine Organ, as well
Angelical as Celestial and Elementary; which according to their diversity in
disposition, are moved by this internal Act, to operate in this World the Will
of the Creator.

17. How this Ruach Elohim being put once in Essences, works by his Angels in
this sublunary World, after four ways, viz. By his Angelical Organs, of a
contrary Fortitude in the Universal Element of the lower Water, both the
effects of Condensation and that of Rarifaction; and to verify it by those
Words, That this one Spirit is the Arch-Lord and Primate of the four Winds;
else the Command of God would not have said, Come ye Spirits from the four
Winds, and make those dead Carcasses to live again. Now this one Spirit works
in and by Spiritual and Angelical Organs, in the execution which is effected by
the four Winds.

Observe, I saw four Angels stand on the four Corners of the Earth, holding the
four Winds of the Earth, that they should not blow, neither on the Earth nor
Sea, etc. By which it is evident, that those Angelical Presidents over the four
Winds, were the Organs by and in the which the Spirits of the Winds were
emitted or retained, according to the Will of that Eternal Spirit which guided
them, and where he lists; so the said hot Winds do undo by Rarifaction, all
that which the cold Northern Winds did effect by Congelation.

18. After what manner this Spirit Ruach Elohim did frame out the Heavens, and
shaped or made the Stars thereof, by his act of Condensation and Rarifaction.
The Heavens and the Earth were of Water and by the Water; so we see that the
Word is the Agent, in the Condensation of the invisible Waters into a visible
Earth.

19. Thus was the World in general, distinguished into thick and thin Regions
by the divine Spirit, which was created on the Water. So says Hermes in these
Words, Distinctis libratisque rebus, quae igneo Spiritu vehebantur, emicuit
Coelum, septem in Circulos. -- Things being distinguished and balanced, which
were sustained by a fiery Spirit, the Heavens did shine forth in seven Circles.
It signifies, that it was a fiery Spirit; and a little before, he called it,
Splendorem Sanctum, the Holy Splendour, which sustain and bear up every Circle
or Sphere of the Heavens in its due place: And the Wise Man says, Omnia Mensura
Numeroque, and pondere, disposuis^ seu tempera^sti; Thou have disposed all
things i^ Measure, Number and Weight, namely, into seven distinct Spheres, and
an infinity of condensed Bodies.

20. I may say, that as the Substance of the Heavens is invisible by reason of
its rarity, i^ like manner are the Stars visible by reason o^ their density;
for it was Condensation that caused Visibility and Rarifaction, which is the
occasion of Invisibility: But Aristotle is of the opinion, That the Stars are
the denser Parts o^ their Orbs, but rather a Light which was included in the
Spirit of the dark Shadow of the Abyss; which Spirit, in separating Light from
Darkness, soared upwards by virtue of the included Light, and so according to
the proportion of that eternal formal Fire, which is ^tained unto this day.

21. How the lower Water or material sub^nary Element was distinguished and
heaped i^ to sundry distinct Spheres, which are particular Elements.

The Universal Substance of the World, was made only out of one thing, of a
Matter that was produced out of the dark Chaos or Abyss, b^ the Spagyrick
Virtue of the great World; t^ which Matter, Moses calls Water, and Her^ the
Humid Nature; it must follow, that out (...) this Catholic Mass of Water, the
Univers^ Sublunary Element was derived, which is called by the Name of Air. Now
this gener^ Element is by the Breath of the divine Spirit^ Ruach Elohim,
altered and changed from one Shape to another; for that which is made the
visible Waters, was made first of Air, which is an invisible Water: in this,
observe the Words of St. Paul, Per fidem agnovimus, quod semper ita actum sit
cum Mundo per Verbum, ut ex iis quae videri non poterant, fiunt ea quae possunt
videri: We know by Faith, that has been ever acted with the World, by the Word,
that those things which can be seen, were effected and made of those things
which could not be seen.

22. We are taught by Chemical Experience, That Earth is nothing else but
coagulated Water, not visible Water; nothing else but invisible Air reduced by
condensation to a visibility; nor Fire, any thing else, but rarefied Air: And
in conclusion, all the sublunary Waters were in the Beginning but an invisible
humid, or a watery Spirit or Air, and consequently the main sublunary Elements
were in Original nothing but one Air, because that Heaven was made before the
Sea or Earth, as Moses tells us.

27. To conclude, I will demonstrate the Mystery of the Worlds Creation, by way
of an Ar^^hmetical Progression, after this manner:

Here we have the Progression in the Worlds Creation; where 1 is, it signifies
the Unity which was before all things: which, while it was in it self, and did
not shine forth, contained its inacted property within its potential Nolunty or
Darkness; and therefore it was esteemed as nothing, in regard of Man's weak
Capacity, although in its self, it is all in all. Then the Rank 2, shows the
actual emanation of the increased Light, out of the potential Unity; at the
presence whereof, the humid Nature did appear out of the dark Abyss, 10. in the
shape of Waters; so that the Light and Waters as active and passive, are ranked
next after Unities.

Unity, thus, Light Water 2.
Then, by the Fiery Spirit of Eternal Love and Unity, those two opposite Natures
are joined together into the nature of Heaven by a spiritual Union or
Composition; which is termed by the Platonicks, the Soul of the World, which
the Philosopher calls by the name of Quinta Essentia, the Quintessence: so also
are the Heavens said to animate the Elements, no otherwise than the Soul does
the Body; so that this degree of Progression in the Creation, stands

Thus Light The last of the Worlds Creation is this, Fire, Air Air, Water
Water, 3 Earth.

Which imports the fourfold alteration of the Catholic Element, by the four
Winds, which was and is effected by the Word, the third day of the Creation;
and this was nothing else but the general sublunary or lower Waters.

This therefore was the State of the Worlds Creation, and in this very State
(say many,) will continue, till it be Resined by the Firey Trial. This the wise
Hermes according to Moses, described unto us thus:

Erat umbra infinita in Abysso; Aqua insuper and Spiritus tenuis Intellectualis
per divinam potentiam in Chaos inerant; storuit autem Splendour Sanctus, qui sub
arena and humida natura Elementa deducit: cumque indistincta fuissent, levia
post Mundum in excelsam regionem provolarunt; gravia sub arena humida
residerunt: distinctis libratisque rebus quae Igneo Spiritus vehebantur,
emicuit Coelum, septem in Circulos, etc. An infinite Shadow of Darkness was in
the Abyss; moreover, Water, and a subtle intellectual Spirit was by the divine
Puissance in the Chaos, and a holy Brightness or Splendour, did flourish, which
did reduce the Elements under the Heaven and humid Nature, and, as they were
undistinguished; and afterward that Portion which was Light, did fly up into
the highest Region. The weightier part did reside, and take its place under the
Heaven. These things being thus distinguished and balanced, were sustained by
(...) fiery Spirit, the Heavens did shine forth in Seve^ Circles, as in the
Table or Speculum on the other side.

In the first place, Behold the Circles and the Motions of the seven Properties
of Nature.

You have seen already the Figure of the da^ Abyss or Chaos, how by the Word
all thing sprung sorth from that Center of Eternity; no^ this signifies to you,
the proper place or Circle of the seven Properties of Nature, viz.,,,,, and
the, in their motion (...) working Posture. Cast your Eyes in the Hea^ or
Center, and you will see A o, which is (...) and (...). The great Spagyrick of
the Mi^ cosmus tells us, I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and Ending; Oculus
Dei, the Eter^^ Eye of God, or Center of Eternity. This Figure comprehends
whatsoever God and Eternity, the Eternal Birth of the Divine Essence, a^ all
Eternal Mysteries are, both within Nature a^^ without; and in its self (in the
Eye) begets Majesty, which is the Heart and Power of the Eye.

But as for the Angelical Circle, and the work and nature of Angels, the
Throne, and the Heavens of Glory, which you see in the highest Circles, I shall
pass by, and hasten on to my intended Business.

CHAP. III.
The Center and Circle of the Elementary Life of Man; showing, what Power the
Elements have over our Bodies.

BUT by the way, it may not be amiss to consider, what our Forefathers did call
this Canopy or Heavens, which has so neatly composed round us, and left us as
it were, in a Box.

Coelum potius Coelum, and Coelorum suprema Mundi pars: a Gr. (...), a
concavitate; the Heavens, Firmament or Sky.

Now we will endeavor to prove out of Scripture, and leave Philosophy, that
the ignorant may be satisfied in my intended Matter, viz. Predictions.

The Heavens have been called by the Holy Ghost, a Book; then doubtless we may
conclude, that there are in this Book Letters or Characters which may be
understood by some or other, t^ read them. Now that it is called a Book,
appears out of Isaiah, who speaks of the last Day wherein all things shall
cease; he says, Compli^cabuntur, sicut Coeli; where the (...) Caph, in Hebrew,
which the Latins translate si^ut, signifies in the Original, quia: so that the
Heaven^ shall be rolled together; and He at the same time gives the reason of
it also, because they are a^ Book: As for a more larger Definition of the Word,
I leave it to the Divines, etc.

They may say, as a Book: To this it may be answered, That it does elsewhere
fully decide this Controversy. Seeing that we speak of the Heavens, it makes
mention of Lines and Letters, which are Words that are most properly and
essentially spoken of a Book, and make no use of the word sicut: which is an
infallible Argument, that those words in the Passages before cited,
Complicabuntur sicut Liber Coeli, are not Expressions of Similitude. Now that
the Scripture, speaking of the Heavens, names expressly the word LETTER, will
appear out of the First of Genesis; there the Hebrew Text runs thus: (...)
Bereshith bara El^^im and Haschamaim: that is to say, In the Beginning, God
created the Letters or Characters of the Heavens: for this is the meaning of
the Hebrew word, (...) and (...), Aat, which is a Letter: and as for the word
Line, we find in Psalm. 19. v. 4. In omnem terram exivit, (...), K^vam, Linea
little; understanding it is spoken of the Stars which are ranked in the Heavens,
after the manner of Letters in a Book, or upon a Sheet of Parchment: for God is
said in the Holy Scriptures, to have str^tch^d out the Heavens as a Skin,
calling this extension (...), Rachia; from whence the Greek might take the word
(...), which signifies a Skin or Hid^; a Skin to be extended or stretched
forth. God disposed and rankt the Stars in the manner of Characters, whereby,
as a Book. Observe, and read them; Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei: The Prophets of
old, called the Heavens a Sacred Book; as among the Jews, R S^meon Ben Jar^hay
in the Zohar, on the Section Tem^ti.

Exodus, C^fr. 305. where he sp^s very ^earnedly of this Celestial Writing,
though very ^bscurely. R. Abraham also, in his Jetsira, a Book of the Creation;
and many more Authors may be named to this purpose: But this may ^atisfy the
Reader, that the Heavens are Books, wherein all things are Registered of those
under ^he Elements, either their good or ill Actions.

Now in this particular, we will endeavor to give you some account of the
Primum Mobile, ^r the moving Circles of the Elements, which is ^y intended
Business or material Subject; how ^ur Bodies are captivated by the Elements;
and ^ave the Ang^ Circle, and the Glory of the ^ost High, to the Divines, and
follow the lower ^egions. You see the Primum Mobile, a round ^ircle, with 12
Characters, called 12 Signs, ^ow in our days; and by those Signs thus
uncharacterized, divides the Heavens in 12 parts, as every Sign into 30 dgrees;
also you see the 7 Planets in their Circles in another place: You shall have a
full demonstration by an Instrument: But I am willing to inform you, that in
the beginning, those Signs and Planets were put in form of Letters by the
Hebrews; and by the Jews, and others, in the form of Living Creatures: And then
the Caldeans and others, brought them into these Forms, as in these latter
times,,,,,,,,,,,,:,,,,,,. Now it may please my Reader to take a view of Ancient
Times, as in the following Chapter.

CHAP. IV.
The Instrument of the Hebrews, whereby to know Events to come.

THE Ancients had of these Instruments, and made use of them in their
Practices, as may be made appear out of the Historians; some of which have made
mention of the Caldeans Astrology, as namely Q. Curtius, who gave a^ account of
all those that went forth out of Babylon, for to receive Alexander the Great;
he says, Magnum deinde suo more Carmen canentes; post Chaldaei Babyloniorum
non Vates modo, se* etiam Artifices: Where, by the word Artifices, he means
those Astrologers who made their Practice those Arts; and this is the gloss of
Heurnius, Ii Astrologi, qui Astrorum Cursus observabant, vera Instrumenta in
eum usum fabricantes. Here we may discover what the Ground was, of that Fable
of Atlas, King of the Mauritanians or Phoenicians, who fled before the Army of
Joshua: for the Heavens, which the Greeks (whom we may truly say, have been the
corrupters of all Antiquity) say, that this Man who was both King and
Astrologer, bare up with his Shoulders, was only a Globe or Sphere, not much
unlike ours in late time, which he made use of for the Motions of the Heavens.
The first Piece of that Instrument, was the Base or Foot of it, which was made
of a thin Plate of Copper, and hollowed in the manner of a Basin; the three
small Pillars lifted up from the Superficies, whereon was written these three
words, (...), Din, Schalom, Emet, viz. Judgment, Peace, Truth; These Pillars
bare up two great Semicircles, which made up a Triangle, with such artifice,
that it was nevertheless in the Superficies. Within you have a great perfect
Circle, and within it two others, and all the same Metal with the Base; the
first, which was the greatest of these Circles, had these words upon it, (...),
Schemai, Haschamaim, the Heaven or Heavens; the second had only upon it, (...),
Shamaim, the Heaven; the third had only one Word, (...), Raquiagh, which
signifies Expansum. The last and the first are nothing so much admirable as the
middlemost, which was beset round with very many little Circles, which were all
movable; among which there were seven which appeared more eminent^ ^^an the
rest, because they were placed by the Center of the Instrument; all these
little Circles had small Stars on them: and those which were upon the seven
Circles, were marked each of them with one of those Letters, (...), which
signifies the Planets in order, first: near these Letters was seen these
following words in Hebrew, -- Jom, Rischon, Schni, Schelicsi, Revighi,
Chamischi, Chicsi, Scevighi, viz. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 days; every one of the Circles
of the Planets, had upon them the number of Years they finished their Courses
in, and that of the, had Engraven on it these 12 Characters, viz.

^ ^



These are the Names of the 12 Signs of the Months: And now I Will also give them
at large in Hebrew, viz.

1 Nisan, 2 Atiri, 3 Stuan, 4 Tamuz, 5 Ab, 6 Aelot, 7 Tisri, 8 Tisuan, 9
Ristien, 10 Tebet, 11 Sch^bec, 12 and last, is Adar. And thus we reckon our
Months, as March, April, etc.

Now these Circles were ordered so exactly, as that one might perfectly discern
the degrees and distances there set down: in the middle of all, and in the very
Center, there was placed a little Blue Ball which was a little hollowed,
supposed to be the Earth. Here you see, that Astrology is no new thing, and the
heavenly Spheres in a perpetual motion.

I should not have here made this Observation, but only that I might be the
better able hereafter, to make known the Virtue of the Ancients Astrology, with
that of the Egyptians, and the more Learned among the Arabians.

CHAP. V.
The Names and Nature of the Seven Rulers of the World, which are the chief
Force and Power under the Elements.

THe Seven Properties of Nature have their Names in several Languages, first,
from the Hebrew; and also every Angel or Planet has its lay to Rule in, as we
observe to this day.

(...), Chauai, Saturn, Saturday. (...), Tsedek, Jupiter, Thursday. (...),
Maactim, Mars, Tuesday. (...), Chamah, Sol, Sunday. (...), Nogah, Venus,
Friday. (...), Cocab, Mercury, Wednesdaey. (...), Levanah, Luna, Monday.
A Planet, (...) Saturnus, (...) Jupiter (...) (...) Mars, (...) Sol, (...) V^
(...) Mercurius, (...) Luna, (...).

In Latin, Planet a a Planet, Saturnus, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, M^ curious,
Luna.

In Arabic, Zazel, Hismal, Bar^ bcl, Sorath, Kedemel, Taphtharthar^ Hasmodiai.

The reason why they are called by the Names, as,,,,,, and.

a Saturo, to fill, or abundance; as our hot Authors says, that is wonderful,
in Plenty Misery. a Juvando; quasi, est Juvans, from helpi^ or liberal to
Mankind. Mars, quasi Mavors, magna vertens; t^ning great Things, and acting
high Exploits Sol, quasi Solus lucens, as only Shini^ or the Eye of the World,
or Candle. Venus, a Veneror, viz. Honor, and gi^ due Reverence, and to
Beautify, etc. Mercurius, quasi Merces, a merendo; sig^fying Wages and
Mercature, being the Ca^ and Author thereof. Luna, quia aliena Luce lucet, viz.
shi^ with a borrowed Light.
This may serve to convince those Unbelie^ to this our Work, seeing our Authors
have ta^ observation, and called the Seven Properties or Rulers of the World,
after their nature and working, by Reason and Experience, and finding that God
has placed them in a working and natural Posture: which you shall see at
large, when the Bosom of Nature is opened.

CHAP. VI.
The Bosom of Nature opened, and explained; giving a Description of the Nature
and Qualities of the Dark and Light Parts of the World.

THE Explanation of this Philosophical Figure of the 7 Properties or Qualities
of Nature, which are called 7 Spirits or Forms, and are vulgarly called 7
Planets, viz. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and last,.

You must observe, that the Sun is placed in the midst of them all, and from
him proceeds both Light and Darkness, as shall be demonstrated: for the is
the Center and Heart of the six Planets, and also the only Center of the whole
Earth, that is, the Light of this World.

For a further enlightening of your Understanding, consider the Qualities of
those aforementioned 7 Spirits: First of, with his harsh, strong, and
attractive Coldness, which shuts up the Abyss, and make Darkness in the Deep,
and attracteth the substantiality of the outward Power of this Quality; and the
Center winds about like a Wheel, and that which is opposite to the Wheel is the
Moon: as you may plainly see Saturn highest, and the Moon lowest; so the first
Quality, is the desire, which make Harshness, Sharpness, Cold, and Substances;
and in the beginning of this World, Salt, Scones and Bones; so all this was
produced out of this Sharpness. I find, Saturnine Men have great Bones.

Jupiter, which arises from the first, and is the drawing Motion in the
Hardness or Sharpness; makes hard, and softens it again, or breaks it; and
there is a continual striving in its self, and it cuts asunder the attractive
quality and desire of, and brings it into multiplicity and variety; it is a
ground of the bitter Pain, and also the true Root of Life, and the Strike of
Fire.

But there is a great Understanding in the Power; yet the Power cannot of his
own might, awaken the Understanding.

But desires a Freedom or Life in the Power, and that is, about the Wheel of,
thus; and is a stirring, and making a noise and sounding, and yet has not Life;
for that consists in Fire. This we may take into consideration, That the
Desire is the ground of something, so that something may come out of nothing;
and this Desire has been, and was the beginning of the World; by which, God by
his Power, has brought all things to a Subsistence and Being, for the Desire,
by which he said, Let there be, etc. and the Desire has made something where
nothing was, but only a Spirit or the Word, which is God; and he has made a
spiritual and visibile Substantiality: We may see by the Elements, Stars, and
other Creatures, the first Substantiality was the Heavens, etc.

Mars is the third Quality; seeing it is so, that and excels in the Fire,
therefore it denotes the first Moving, which strikes up the Fire, which is,
etc. which is a Stirrer, and a Cinder of the Fire, viz. a feelingness of the
breaking off the harsh Hardness, and the ground of Anguish, viz. a Flash or
Lightning, wherein the Power, Colors and Virtues, do appear in these three
first Qualities or Properties, and in it consists the Ground of Anger, Hell
and Darkness.

But now observe, that this Quality of Heat and Fire it self, cannot consist;
for Fire desires Substantiality; and Fire has no Substantiality; for Fire its
self subsisteth not without Fuel to work upon; which Substantiality desires
Meekness, which is Venus, and is Light or Love, that are about the Wheel.

For it is the Meekness of the outward Nature, and it is that which the other
before desire, and that is Water, etc. So Venus has, and is the Fire of Love,
and the World of Power and Light, wherein Darkness dwells in its self, and the
Darkness comprehends it not.

These 6 Properties are together, viz.,,. So these Six are united into three
substantial Qualities.

The, which is in the midst of the 6 Qualities, is the Heart and Center of them
all, and is the spiritual Fire, wherein the Will of God, or Unity is made. You
read in the Scripture, that God placed his Tabernacle in the Sun: all comes
from this Unity, which has incorporated and united its self with the natural
Desire: for the burning Properties of Heat, proceed from the sharp
Devouringness of the first Qualities, as follows: The Unity or Freedom, is the
soft and still Tranquillity, being amiable, and as a soft comfort, easy; and it
cannot be expressed, how soft a Tranquillity there is without Nature, in the
Unity and Freedom of God. But the* Qualities, in order to Nature, are sharp,
painful, and terrible, etc. and all is produced by the Power and Word of God.

CHAP. VII.
A Platform of the Heavens, Elements and Earth; with a Demonstrati^ of the 12
Signs.

THE 12 Stars, are the 12 Signs in number^ Those the Woman in the Revelatis^
(which the Dragon would have devoured) wo^ upon her Head, being 12 Stars, for
one number: She received 6 from the Spirit of the^ World, and the other 6 she
had from the Elementary Center, which the Word, or the Eternal Center, God
created, etc. Two Numbers are come into one; for God became Man, and brought
two numbers into one: she wore the Angelical Zodiac, and also the Human; and so
the Image in the Revelations, had 12 Stars on her Grown; the Images represent
God, and its the Similitude of God, in which he revealed himself: so those 12
Signs, or 12 Stars, are 12 Signs of the Zodiac, so called:



A Figura Animalium quae in eo imaginantur* vel quod vitam and calorem
Animalibus dare creditur.

But of these in another place.

From these Signs, and the 7 Properties of Nature, proceed four Elements; which
are nothing else but only from the Arches of the inward Center, viz. from the 4
Properties of Eternal Nature, and breathed out from the inward Center, and
formed into a working Substance.

Now observe the Sympathy of the 7 Properties, and the 12 Signs; they have
Habitations or Places wherein they delight, which are called Houses, as in this
Figure.



These 7 Properties of Nature, have their Delights, viz.,,,,, in two Houses,
one for the Day, and the other for Night, marked with D for Day, and N for
Night, as you see in the Table; but the only one, viz. the Sign, and the only;
and their Workings and Operations are wonderful, and past ^inding out; in
Ruling three Kingdoms, viz. Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals.

CHAP. VIII.
Power of the Seven Properties and ^lements of Nature; proving, that ^ose
Planets and Angels rule gra^ally and in order, over the Minds and Bodies of
Mankind.

^is manifest, that all inferior things are sub^t to superior Bodies; after a
manner (as ^roclus) they are one in the other, viz. infe^r superior, and
superior or inferior; so in ^eavens are things Terrestrial, but as in ^auses,
and in a Celestial manner: And ^ Earth are things Celestial, but after a
^strial manner, as in effect: so here are ^n things which are Solary, and
certain ^s Lunary; the and make a strong ^ssion of their Virtues; whence it is,
that ^ kind of things receive more Operations ^operties, than those of the
Stars and before spoken of.

^t,. Here are many things under the ^ of Saturn and his Angel; among Ele^, are
Earth, and also Water: amongst Hu^s, black Choler, and that is moist, as well
^las adventitious, adust Choser excepted, ^gst Tastes, sour, tart, and dead;
amongst Metals, Lead, by reason of its Weight and Cold; amongst Stones, the
Onyx, the Ziaza, the Camomus, the Saphir, the proud Jasper; and several Plants
and Trees, which are endless to name here.

Secondly, and his Angel; over Elements, the Air; over Tumors, Blood, and the
Spirit of Life; things which respect Increase and Nourishment; amongst Tastes,
such as are sweet and pleasant; amongst Metals, Tin, Silver and Gold, by reason
of their Temperateness; amongst Stones, the Hyacinth, Beril, Sapphire, the
Emerald, the green Jasper, and Airy Colors; and Power over many Herbs, etc.
Corn, Barley or Wheat, etc.

Thirdly, Under the Power of, and his Angel; of Elements, Fire and sharp acid
things; amongst Humors, Choler, bitter Taste, tart and burning, and causing
Tears; amongst Metals, Iron and red Brass, and all ^iery, red, and sulphurous
things; Stones, the Diamond, Loadstone, the Boodstone; amongst Plants,
Hellebor, Garlic, and many more.

Fourthly, Those things under the Power of and her Angel, are called Venereal:
first, of the Elements, Air and Water; amongst Humors, Phlegm, with Blood,
Spirit and Seed; of Taste, those which are sweet, unctious and delectable; of
Metals, Silver and yellow Brass; of Stones, the Beryl, Chrysolite, Emerald,
Sapphire, the Cornelia, the Stone Aetites, the La^^ll, Coral, and all of a
various white, fair, and green Color; of Plants and Trees, the Vervain, Violet
and Marygold, etc.

Fifthly, and his Angel; first, Elements, Waters, although it moves all things
indistinctly; as for Humors; those which are mixed with the Animal Spirits; as
for Tastes, those that are various and strange, and mixed; as for Metals,
Quicksilver; and, as for Stones, the Emerald and Achates, red Marble, Topaze,
and those which are of diverse Colors; as for Plants and Trees, the Hazel; and
five leav'd-Grass, the Herb Mercury, and many others.

Sixthly, and his Angel, over Elements, the lucid Flame; in Humors, the pure
Blood and Spirit of Life; as for Tastes, that which is quick, and sweetens;
over Metals, Gold, by reason of its Splendour; amongst those which resemble the
Rise of Sol, by their golden Sparkles; as does the glittering Stone Aetites,
and the Stone called the Eye of the S^ so in Figure, from the middle thereof,
shines forth a Rise and Governor over many Vegetables.

Seventhly, and her Angel; Elements, Earth and Water, of the Sea and Rivers,
and all moist things, in the midst of Trees and Animals; and they which are
white; as Whites of Eggs, sweet Phlegm; Metals, Silver; as for Stones, those
that are white and green; as also Pearl, she has power over many Vegetables.

Here you have but a glance of the Power of those Properties of Nature over the
three Kingdoms; and as for the full Scope and Power at large, it would make a
large Volume: for my intended Business, is to show you, what Power those 7
Properties and Elements have over the Bodies and Minds of Mankind. I shall only
i^ form you, that those Planets and Angels R^ gradually and in order, and take
their turns every one has a particular Day, and also certain Hours, as shall
be shown in another place.

CHAP. IX.
The Situation of the Heavens and Earth, at the Creation of the Sun, Moon and
Stars.

THE Sun, Moon and Stars, were created on Wednesday, April 22, 18. h. p. m.
about 4002 Years before Christ; this I understand by the ^ews, and many
Authors, of this matter; (...) some difference is amongst them: but be^ ^ere
are some Philosophers in these our d^l v^^ture to give the World this Form.

(...) ^n that the Equinoctial is not perma^ fixe^ to one day, but oftentimes
va^ for certain, the Sun did enter the Ver^ ^ommonly called Aries, in the
Mornin^ ^nesday, April 22, being on the t^ ^ir Creation. Thus, as the Night ^
day, so was the Moon before the Sun Moon: and: stars Created: ^ednesday April
22th years Before Christ 4002.

^n, as is seen in the Figure: this was the Opi^^on of Dr. Butler.

This we may perceive, that the Body of the ^ was created in its Sphere, yet it
could not ^ave Light till the Sun arose, and was created ^ith, or the
South-Node, as it was rising out ^f an Eternal Eclipse; out of which the
Sun^^^e awakened her.

By this Form or Out-Birth, you may perceive ^^e whole Creation; and that the
Earth or World which is the black Circle in the Figure, ^epresents the Earth in
which we live; so we ^ay plainly see and understand, that the whole World is
composed round with the Starry Heaven and Elements: the use of which is, the
Sun ^o give Light by Day, and the Moon by Night. So the Earth is as a round
Ball or Apple, hanging (...) the midst of a Glass, in the Form of a Globe.

Then observe how the two Points are opposite to one another, viz. the Head of
the Dragon, and Tail; in the Ascendant, and in the Seventh.

Now the Learned Astrologers tell us, that the Heavens or Starry Firmament is
divided into 360 Degrees, as you may see in the Circle, as shall be
demonstrated to you at large, when we come to that Art called Astrology.

Now we have demonstrated to you the Out-Birth, viz. the Forms of the Heavens
and Earth, I shall proceed in order to the fifth Work, or Day of Creation; for
we could not properly call Time Night or Day, before the Sun and Moon was
created; so on the fourth day, by the Pow^ of the Word, the great Sol of the
World open it self in the Essence, viz. the Life of the (...) and watery,
wherein God created all B^ Fish, Fowls and Worms, every one accordi^ to its
Species and Forms; viz. from its pe^ liar Qualites of the Divine Mercury: Thus
(...) Eternal Qualities have moved themselves, a^cording to Evil and Good, as
you may perce^ by the foregoing Instrument, or Bosom of Nature, where you may
see the 7 Qualities, wi^ their Essences and Mixture; for there are (...) and
good Creatures created, every thing a^cording to the Scripture Original in
(...) light of Nature; from which it is, that all Cre^tures in their Kind or
Quality, do love one a^ther. Thus we may see, how the Creatures a^ in the
Center, before they are in themselv^ and that he knows, wills, foreseeth, and
for ordains all things, and every thing together once.

Now we are come to the last Creature, whi^ is Man, the little World, and a
wonderful Pi^ of Wisdom, Master and Ruler over all t^ Works of the Creatures,
or Creation.

Therefore I have given you, as it were, Demonstration of the great World, or
Ma^cosm, and I shall speak of Microcosmos; as y^ shall find in the following
Book.

THE Center and Creation OF MAN; Astrologically, Theologically,
Philosophically, and Astronomically handled. BOOK II.
CHAP. I.
The true Knowledge of Man, consisting of External and Internal Nature, in the
Elementary World.

POstea dixit, faciamus Hominem ad imaginem nostram, secundum similitudinem
nostram: qui dominentur in Pisces maris, and in Volucreis Coeli, and in
Pecudes, and in universam Terram; que in omnia reptilia reptantia super Terr^
Itaque creavit Deus Hominem, ad imaginem quam Dei creavit eum: marem and
foeminam (...) vit eos.

God said, Let us make Man according t^ Image; and God created Man according to
his Image: And Moses says, That God made (...) with Clay, meaning, with the
Composition the Elementary Powers: for though Adam was (...) first Man, yet we
read, that he had his Fall t^ he had his longing and eager Desires after m^
Fancies, which brought himself to a great M^ demeanor: But of this Man Adam,
I Will say (...) more, and let the first Species alone.

We read in Genesis, that God on the fifth d^ created all living Creatures, at
one Revoluti^ of the Earth: so likewise you may observe^ one Revolution more,
Adam was made.

Now we will present you with the Opinion of Learned Philosopher, with the
Paradisial ^ound and Turning of the Heavens from its ^st Primum Mobile, viz.
two days after the ^d were created.

adam in paradise.



Thus Adam was created in that pleasant place ^radise, about the year before
Christ 4. 002. ^z. on April 24. at 12 a Clock, or Midnight. ^ow this place
Paradise is in Mesopotamia, where ^e Pole is elevated 34 degrees. 30 min. and the
^eth 4 Hours sooner, than under the elevation the Pole of London: Now our
curious Rea^r may be inquisitive concerning this matter. If you will not credit
these Reasons laid d^ pray read Josephus; there you will see some^ of this
matter, viz. of the first Primum M^ or moving Posture of the World, and plac^
Paradise, and Elevation of its Pole. Many ^troversies have been about the Time
and Se^ of the Year, therefore I shall not trouble Reader any further with
them. Let the S^pture be our Guide in this Matter; Let the^ (says the Word)
and there was: and also (...) fifth days Work of the Creation, when the G^
hoppers were, and the Trees sprang out; this (...) give us to understand, that
the Time of Creation must have its beginning in the Spri^

Now for the place or Center of the Ea^ from whence we may observe the Poles,
as a^mentioned in Mesopotamia, where God pl^ Adam: So the Spring is two months
soo^ there than here with us, under the Elevatio^ the Pole at London.

But for the Ages of the World, many h^ endeavored to satisfy; Dr. Butler for
one.

CHAP. II.
The Egg of Generation; or, (...) Center of Man.

IN the last Chapter, you have an accou^ the first Man Adam, of his wonderful
C^tion and Situation, who was in himself, Male and Female. But he who made all
things by his Word and Power, said, it was not convenient for him to live
alone; so there was a Division, a Woman, called Eve, who is the Matrix of the
Genetrix, and thus it stands in the Eternal Will; and this is the Center of
Nature under the Elements, Man, Microcosmos, or that little World, as the
Compendium of the whole Creation, partake of both these Kinds, consisting of
Soul and Body, formed of the Elements; Moses tells us, of the Dust of the
Ground; also he partakes of an immediate Creation, with the corruptible
Creatures, incontroulable in his Soul, breathed of God: therefore, in his Body
he is by Nature corruptible, and his Soul immortal.

Now we will proceed on the Words before, the Female taken out of the Male,
which is for Procreation, Convocation, and Multiplication; observe the Words of
Moses:

Dixerat autem Jehova Deus, non est bonum esse hominem solum: faciam ei
Auxilium commodum ipsi.

These Words implie a Unity and Familiarity of Adam with his Female Creature;
and this to Posterity. The Philosophers in these our days, are at a stand for
the Reason of that Love arising between Male and Female, telling us, it is only
a strong Sympathy in Nature. But of this enough. And seeing that the first Man
is the first Woman, it may be convenient to demonstrate to you something of the
Egg of Multiplication.

But pray give me leave, before I run on wi^ these Demonstrations of the Human
Egg of Generation, to give you a Demonstration touchi^ this Matter in Latin,
from the wise Philosoph^ of Old, that the Reader may not want a suffciency to
whet his Understanding on.

(...). De Generandi, aut Spermatica Facultate,
GEnerandi quoque vis, partis est ejus quae ^tioni non obtemperat: nam sine
volunt^ nostra in somniis Semen emittimus, and cupidit^ Conjunctionis naturalis
est; inviti enim ad eam ^rimur: quanquam actio sine controversia in n^ sita
est, and ab anima pendet. Etenim Instrument^ quae appetitioni naturali serviunt
conficitur, and ab^tinere ab appetitione eamque comprimere, in n^ est positum.
Instrumenta autem seminandi facultate praeditae Venae sunt, and Arteriae; in
his eni^per conversionem sanguinis primum humidum, qu^ad seminis nature a
vergit, ut in Mammis Lac, pr^creatur. Horum enim vasorum alimentum hi^ humor
est, propterea quod a principio e semine precreata sint. Excoquunt igitur
Arteriae and Ve^ Sanguinem in humidum, quod ad naturam Semi^ accedit, ut
alatur: atque quod ex earum alimenu^relinquitur, Semen fit. Fertur enim primu^

arterias delabitur.

Q^are si quis excidat venas, quae sunt circa aures, and parotides, Animal
sterile reddit, and ineptum ad generandum; hae aut em venae and arteriae
evadunt illud tort uosum, and quod instar varicum est, involuerum, quod est ad
Scrotum, ubi humidum illud quod ad semen accedit labitur in utrumque Testem.
Una est arteria, unaque vena plena seminis, in quibus perfect semen
perficitur, and per tortuosum prrastatem, qui secundus testis est, cum flatu
depellitur; quoniam and arteria est quae mittit: ferri autem etiam a vena,
libidinosa petulantia ostendit. Cum enim diu concubuerint, and id, in quo
seminis vis inest and Genitalem humorem, consumpserint, tum etiam per violentam
contentionem parum sanguinis emittit. Mulieres quoque omnes easdem, quas viri
vere parts habent, sed intus, non extra. Aristoteles quidem, and Democritus,
nihil volunt confer Semen Mulieres ad procreationem Liberorum; quod enim
mittitur a Mulieribus, sudorem potius Membri, quam semen esse volunt. Galenus
vero damnat Aristotelem, ait Semen emittere Mulieres, and mixtionem utriusque
Seminis Foetum efficere; quare etiam concubitum mixtionem dici: non tamen
perfectum Semen, ut viri, sed adhuc crudum, and humidius. Cum autem tale sit
mulieris Semen, alimentum sit utilis, and ex eo pars quaedam coriisive
membranae Foetum ambientis, qui ad cornua concrescit, and quod a farciminis
forma, (...), nominatur; quod reliquiarum cibi Foetus dum in uteri est
receptaculum sit: in unoquoque autem genere animalis, tum faemina marem
admittit, cum potest concipere. Quae ergo semper possunt concipere, semper
conjunctionem admittunt, ut Gailinae, and Columbae, and Homo; sed caetera
du^gravida sunt, fugiunt conjunctionem, Mulier sempe^admittit. Nam Gallinae

Mulieres autem ut in caeteris rebus, voluntate su^ libera; ita etiam in
concubitu post conceptionen Nam bestiae non a seipsis, sed a natura diriguntu^
and modus eis tempusque definitum, Naturae leg^ statutum est.

Notwithstanding their high Learning, they are in the Dark, as the Quaker
says; but An^stotle in some of his Works, owns, that Women have Eggs. No more
of this, but I shall proceed in my former Method.

If the method be observed in the knowledge of Generation, we may be confident
we have arrived at the Principles themselves; and then will appear out of what
first Matter, by wh^ Efficient, and what Possession the Plastic Pow^ has its
Original; and then also, what progres^ Nature makes in this Work: for both the
fir^ and remote Matter appear the clearer (being stripped naked as it were) by
Negation; an^ whatsoever is first made in Generation, that as it were the
material Cause of that which succeeds; as for Example, a Man was first Boy
(because from a Boy he grew up to a Man before he was a Boy, he was an Infant;
and before an Infant, he was an Embryo.

Now we must search further, what he was (...) his Mothers Womb, before he was
an Embryo^ Foetus; whether their Bubbles, or some rude and indigested Lump, or
a Conception, or Coagulation of mixed Seed, or whether any thing else?
According to the Opinion of Writers, an Egg or Eggs is the first Center or
Production under the Elements, of the Beginning of Man: so we come all from
Eggs, etc. a Description of which, I will demonstrate at large in the following
Chapter.

CHAP. II.
A Description of the Human Egg; or, the Matrix of the Center of Generation.

SEeing the Figures of Human Eggs are exemplificated to your View, we will in
this Chapter speak something in particular concerning the Body of Man, of his
Formation, and some of his Parts.

It Is well known, that the Soul's Bodily Union, and Conception in the Soul, is
performed, or comes to pass after this manner: beneath in the Matrix, the Woman
has no Seed; but each side of her Womb has many little Eggs, every one of
which hangs by a small Filament: and these are born with her, and are found in
all Female Creatures.

Figure I.
Look upon the Figure, and behold the Matria of Conception, or Storehouse of
Multiplication; those Eggs appear as they at the Tread of a Cock in the Hens
Egg, or as the Spawn of a Fish, in little rude Lumps or Spots.

In the Cohabitation of Man and Wife together, after the spiritual Seed being
united, or implanted in the Egg, and it has received them; the said Egg does,
through its Ductus or Pipe, slip down, or off, from the said Lump of Eggs, into a
certain Cavity, as Nature has provided, in order to its being further
accomplished there; as you may see by the Figures following.

Fig. II.
Represents two human Eggs of a differe^^ bigness, being separated from the
Egg, Lump, or Center of Generation: two Eggs represent Twins; but one Egg, one
Child.

Fig. III.
Represents an Embryo of 6 Days after Conception.

A represents to the Eye, the inward part of the Membranes, Chorion and Amnion,
being imperfectly formed, and in which there is as yet no appearance of the
Hepar Uterinum.

B represents an Embryo, in which may be seen the distinction of the Head from
the Body, but no delineation of any other Parts.



Fig. IV.
Represents an Embryo of 18 Days after Conception.

A, the Hepar Uterinum, with the Veins and Arteries, which are dispersed through
the Substance of the Membrane.

BBBB, the Membrane Chorion, dissected.

CCCC, the Membrane Amnion, dissected in like manner.

D, the Navel-String.

E, an Embryo, of 15 or 16 Days, in which the Face begins to appear more
distinctly, and the rest of the Members are somewhat formed and distinguished.

Fig. V.
Represents to the Eye, a grisly Skeleton of an Embryo, of three Weeks and
three Days.

Fig. VI.
Represents an Embryo of one month four days.

A, the whole grisly Bulk of the Head, showing the grisly Points of both the
upper and nether Jaw Bone.

BB, the Clavicula, now all Bone.

CC, the Point of the Ossification of the Shoulder Blades.

DD, the wite Strokes defiguring the Ossisication of the Shoulders.

EE, the white Strokes, showing the Ossisication of the Arm-Bone.

FF, these white Points in all the Reds, except the first and last, do denote
the Ossification already begun in them.

GG, the Thigh-bones, representing what is Bone in them.

HH, the greater and lesser Bone of the Leg clearly represented, and already of
the Boney-Substance.

Fig. VII.
Shows an Embryo of two Months, which differs not from that of three months and
10 days, but only in bigness; and the lesser Bones, as was before hinted, are
to be seen here; which in the other, did not as yet appear.

A does exhibit the inferior Jaw Bone, distinguished into 6 little Bones.

Thus far we have shown you the beginning of Generation, from the Ovum, or Egg,
how the Growth and Perfection moves along by degrees; as you may see in the
Figure of Human Eggs. And seeing it is not my business here to discourse through
the whole Body of Anatomy, therefore (kind Reader) I refer thee to an useful
Compendium of Anatomy of mine in Latin, which will give you a full satisfaction
of all at large, and in particular of the Eggs in Women, entitled, Compendium
Anatomicum, nova Methodo institutum; which may be had of most Book sellers in
London.

But because here is not yet a full demonstration of the Features in the Womb,
I will present to your View, from the Beginning of the Skeleton or Boney Parts,
a Figure of the Infant in the Womb come to Perfection, out of my foresaid Book;
and also its coming into the World, with its Afterbirth, etc.

Thus I have given you by Figures, the whole Generation, both Bone and Flesh,
and something of Desection of the Infant.

But I must turn back a little again, to the Boney-Part, because I just now
call to mind the Sayings of some Philosophers, touching this same Subject
concerning Bones, derived from Scripture, That Eve was made out of a Bone or
Rib; because the Central Spirit has its residence in the Bones, they being the
first Product or Out-Birth of the said Spirits.

The Query is, Whether it will not follow from hence, That the Bones are the
first material Being, which we may call Semen; from which the Flesh, as from a
Spring or Fountain, does continually proceed, and to which it must by
Revolution, return again, in order to Perfection?

It is further Queried, what the Word (...), Tzela, does properly signify; of
which it is said, Genesis 2. That the Woman was made. Seeing that it has several
Significations, viz. a Bone, Prop or Support; a Rib, a Side, a Foundation, a
Building, etc. If you think that it was a Rib-Bone, we would willingly know
which it was, and on which Side the Rib was taken, because the Ribs are fastened
to the sides of the Vertebrae of the Backbone, and most of them are joined
together by Cartilages, to the Sternum or Brest-bone; or, forasmuch as the Word
also signifies a Beam, or any thing that is a Supporter or Prop; where if we
take it in this sense, it can signify nothing but the whole Backbone of a Man,
which bears up the whole Body in like manner, as Beams support a Building:
moreover, whether, for to reconcile all these several Meanings together, we
ought not to enquire, Whether the mid Part or Point, and the very Center of the
whole Backbone and the Ribs, which are united to it; forasmuch as this Center
is that out of which Eve was made, etc. For we may easily know, that all the
rest of the Bones in Man, proceed from this Center, the Backbone; because it
is ridiculous to think, that an Embryo in the Mothers Womb, does first begin to
have Arms and Legs in 16 days after Conception: whether I may not say, after a
d^ weighing of all this, we may conclude, that Eve was made out of the very
Center of the whole Body of Man.

Now many may say, Is the Egg of a Woman in the Form of a Hens Egg? We say, No;
but a Resemblance. But the main Reason here, that I present you with an Egg in
the Form of a Hens Egg, is, because of that famous Author Fabricius, who says,
That the Contemplation of the Forming of the Foetus out of Eggs, is the largest
of all; which appears in this, That the greatest part of Animals are gotten of
Eggs.

It Is a plain case therefore, that all Animals whatsoever, even Vipers also,
nay, Man himself, are made of an Egg: and that the first Conception of all
living Creatures which bring forth Young, are certain Eggs; just as the first
Conception of all Plants, are certain Seeds: but what is common, is not
admired. Observe, put the smallest Seed in its own Matrix, or Mother-Earth, and
it springs up, and brings forth its own kind.

But O Man! thy place of Conception or Increase, is on thy Lump of Female Eggs.
Cast thy Eye on the Figure of the Egg, and thou will see in the middle, a
parcel of rude Lumps or Spots, as it were in the form of the Female Row of a
Herring, which is the true resemblance of the Lump of Eggs in Women.

The true method of Conception, is thus: That when the Seed of Man is spilt on
this rude Lump, or Eggs in Women, it washes off, or moves those little Eggs,
one from the other: and as Nature has provided, it falls into a small Cavity,
or place by it self; the place being open when the Egg falls off, but when it is
in, it closes up again. Thus Nature has its Effects; and in this place, the
Foetus grows to perfection, and it is composed round with a Covering, like the
Shell of a Hens Egg; the Midwife commonly calls it the Afterbirth, when it
comes into the World.

Further, look again on the Figure of the Egg, and you will see the Elements
round it, viz. the 7 Properties of Nature, with the four Triple States, viz.
Fire, Air, Earth, Water; also you have Signs wherein the seven Planets or
Properties of Nature delight in: then you have a description of the Nature of
them. As for Example F, which signifies that Venus is a Female; and then
concerning, has the Letter M, which tells you that is Masculine; and so of the
rest.

So the Matrix, or the Ovary Lump and the and the Seed of Man, are all
Elements, and under the Power of the 7 Properties.

Be wise, O Reader! and learn the Nature of the Heavenly Bodies, and thou shall
do Wonders, without Conjuration. If thou want an Heir or Man-Child to
inherit thy Land, observe a time when the Masculine Planets and Signs Ascend,
and in full Power and Force, then take thy Female, and cast in thy Seed, and
thou shall have a Man-Child.

Observe the same method with the Female Signs and Planets, for a Daughter, and
so on.

It Is not my business here to meddle or speak of the Nourishment of the Foetus
in the Womb, or the Birth, because my Task is Elementary.

But if you please to read my Compendium Anatomicum, you will have a brief
Account of the Oval Nourishment, and Birth of a Child, from the Conception to
the Birth; Fabricius concerning his Oviary or Hens Eggs, Dr. Gibson concerning
Eggs of Rabbets, Dr. Willis concerning Brutes or Animals.

An Egg is the common Original of all Animals. Aristotle himself calls the very
same things Worms in one place, and Eggs in another.

But it is needless to make use of his Reasons in this place, to prove it;
seeing we are already convinced, that all Animals have their Original from
these Eggs; and by the Experiments of our later Authors in this Particular,
it is plain, that Man (though chief) was engendered in, or by them.

Observe the same by Dr. Harvey, Dr. Gibson, etc. they give us an Example of
the Eggs of Women by the Rabbets, by dissecting them before Conception, and at
Conception; and so by degrees, to perfection. But my main business is, to show
how the Foetus is governed in the Womb, by the Elementary Power: I will give
you the Opinion of Henricus Lindhout, Bruxellensi Medicinae Doctore; ac
Philosophorum.

CHAP. III.
How the Foetus in the Womb is governed, according to the Elementary Power of
the Seven Properties of Nature, and every one in Order; as first,. etc.

ITaque supremus omnium Planetarum, primo Conceptum dirigit per primum mensem
ab hora Conceptionis, materiam coagulat, constringit and exsiccat; sicut enim
ipsa altior est caeteris Planetis, and prior, ita ejus Regimen primo Creaturam
humanam ambit and gubernat. Si itaque ipse tum been dispositus fuerit; erit
Conceptio been disposita and statuta, praesertim parts sive Foetus Elementa
Saturno subjecta.

Disponit Conceptum in utero secundo mense; qui movet ventus coagulationis; and
dispondit matetiam, ut fiat mollis; dirigitque ventus ejus colorem naturalem
and commiscetur cum tali vento materia, eritque quasi Dormiens, qui semper
monitur ad vigiliam, nec cessabit moveri donec forma totius accedat and in hunc
Mundum Generetur.

Mars, disponit Conceptum tertio mense, qui materiam illam ad sui naturam and
colorem mutat, in formam sanguinis deducendo, virtusque Jovis tunc latitat and
quiescit; hinc fit, quod utero gerens tunc habeat propter ventus Jovis moventin
Matricem cum materia in ea; sed in utero terus fere mense semper cessat nausea
propter Martem, qui tertium ipsum mensem dirigit: si it aque tunc been
fortunatur, eratque sanguis nati purus, and vix ac rarissime super abundans
nisi forte propter vitam inordinatam. Si vero male ipse disponitur, contrarium
accidit.

Oculus Mundi quartum mensem sibi vendicat, qui benigno and salutari suo calore
humiditate superfluas siccatis Membra Principalia conformat calore qua
rarificat: illo etenim mense largitur omnium formarum fortitudinem, in
Conceptum dando animam rationalem. Si igitur in quarto mense Sol ascendit ad
augem, fueritque in dignitatibus suis fortis, significat perfectionem and
formosiatem vultus, quoniam tunc etiam natus erat magne potentiae eorum quae
jam est adeptus.

Disponit quinto mense, illo enim mense apparet forma Membrorum and figuratur
sexus, eriguntur que capilli, and excrescunt crines; Si ipsa tunc fuerit been
disposita, fortis, in dignitate sui, erit natus formosus, amicabilis, and
plenus dulcedine, completus in facie and Membris; Si vero fuerit descendens,
vel in domicilio Saturni, Natus erit deformis and turpis.

Sextum Mensem disponit; sed quia ipse e^ Planeta loquentiae and sapientiae,
Doctrinae, sensus, ac nutritionis facit discretionem, ut Foetus se nutriat, and
extendit Membrum Linguae, and vocalem Arteriam ea ratione; Foetus eo mense
validius incipit percutere manibus pedibusque in Matrice, and motus ejus
fortificatur, appetitque exire de tenebris; sed nondum est tempus. Si ipse
fuerit ascendens in Circulo suo, fortis, and been dispofit us, variis exornatur
donis, secundum varias irradiationes bonorum Planetarum, sin vero, contra
contraria accident.

Luna mense septimo; tunc Foetus formam completum adipiscitur in utero materno,
habebit tunc fiduciam vitae and gubernationis; si isto mense nascatur puer,
erit bona spes de vita nati, propter complementum significationum Planetarum.

Now to begin again; first to Saturn, then Jupiter.

Saturnus secundario Foetum mense octavo dirigit; cujus virtute ipse
infrigidatur in Matrice vis seminum, ita quod vix in ea apparent motus; and si
puer eo mense exibit, eo quod siccus and congelatus quasi est, sepissime
moritur.

Jupiter sequitur, dirigitque Foetus nono in mense; qui facit ventum and motum,
and tunc exit puer de tenebris and angustia ventris in hunc Mundum, erigitque
tum Oculos ad lumen Solis, si est de die; vel ad lumen Candelae, si fuerit de
nocte; miraturque de non visis, and propter loci angustiam per quem exit:
quoniam constringitur and coarctatur. Incipit flere, percipiens miseriam hujus
Terrestris Seculi, in quo hic filius universi sit, omiumque miseriarum
subictum; ut Xenocrates in libro de morte, Axiocho recte dixerat. -- Quid autem
de illo (inquit) tibi videtur qui Nascentem jubet miseriam sua vitae lugere?

Atque haec de Mundi Principiis, and Creatione, deque hominis principiis, and
vertutibus siderum, actionibusque, in ejus procreatione; long aliter quam a
Paracelso, aut ejusdem farinae Philosophis tradita sunt, persecuti sumus; in
hac itaque via persistentes, ad veriora progrediendum est.

So much for the Creation of the great, and and little Worlds.

But to go gradually along as I have begun, I ought to speak something of the
Nature of Man, De Natura Hominis; but I find it is a large Field, insomuch that
I shall forbear, and make it a Subject of it self, which will be ready for the
Press very speedily.

Seeing Man by Nature is prone to Ambition, and of a lofty Mind, and apt to
dive into Knowledge and secret Mysteries; it might be very proper in this
place, to give you a word or two, as an Introduction toward my present Task in
Hand, viz. We have observed in this our Elementary Life, many certain and true
Rules, by which we have foretold Events to come, etc. by the Canopy of Heaven
and Stars, according to their Situation.

Now finding many Fools and Self-willed People, that will not believe what is
true or ^ational, or what has been experienced from the beginning of the World.

So I am not willing here to trouble my self about any Vindication of this
great Work, but direct you to that famous Sir Christopher Heydon's Vindication
of Astrology, which may be to your con^ent.

But for your further satisfaction, I have in the following Chapter, begun from
the beginning, by the first Man Adam, down to this Day, very short and brief;
showing you, first, that Adam was the first Man that took notice of the
Elements, Power and Signification of the Seven Properties of Nature.

You may see in the next Chapter, how they of Old did observe the Seven
Properties of Nature, in observing the ill Nature of Saturn, and the good
Nature of Jupiter, because he was Author of Goodness; the old Hebrews called
some of their Children by that Name Jupiter; Jacob's Wife called her Son Gad,
which is Jupiter, because he is to give a good brisk share of Body, and a good
Principle; this was observed in old time, proved by Scripture.

In the third place, we have taken notice of Eleven Particulars, where we find
by general Observations, the Changes and Turnings in this Box of Elements, of
Preservation and Destruction, etc.

Then fourthly, We prove to you, that the Starry Heavens are Books, and they
are to be rolled together, in which you may read your future Hope and Fortune
in the World; thereby showing you also, that the Hebrews and others, read the
Heavens in their own Language, making up their Letters by the motion of the
Stars.

So the main reason, why I thus trouble my self about the Hebrews, and Old
Matters, is only to convince the Ignorant what the Truth is.

Many there be that will not believe, that they are under the Power of the
Canopies of Heaven.

Alas! our Savior Christ himself, was (as Man) under the Jurisdiction of the
Elements: so your Bodies must be under subjection of those Powers.

But if you desire to know how to be above the Elements in your Mind, Will, and
Understanding, strive to be as Saul when he sought his Fathers Asses, Sam. 10.
6. And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shall Prophecy
with them, and shall be turned into another Man, viz. above the Elements.

Irruetque super te, ut prophets cum eis, and muterberis in virum alium.

CHAP. IV.
Adam's Knowledge of the Stars, proved by Seth, and so carried down to the Time
of Josephus.

ADam being the first Man, knew well that he was placed under the Elements, and
he observed their Powers also.

This is proved by Josephus, that Adam and Seth were the first that practiced
this Science, or Power of the Elements; and that Abraham, when he fled into
Egypt, taught it the Egyptians: this Truth has so much the more force in it,
in that it proceeds from a Man whose Authority is unquestionable; so that we
may perceive, that Pliny was much mistaken, when he affirmed, that none but
Atlas was the Author of it: Besides, we are very certain, that Astrology was in
use long before Atlas. Some say, that B^lus was the first that invented
Astrology, and some assure us, the Phaenicians were the Men. But suppose it be
so as others will have it, the Assyrians were the Inventers of it; yet still
will it be true, that the Patriarchs were the Men, forasmuch as Abraham was an
Assyrian, and his Predecessors were Phaenicians, a Colony of Assyrians having
gone into Phoenicia. But if you will believe the Report of the two Pillars,
which were erected before the Flood, upon one of which, all the Rules of
Astrology was Engraven by Seth, and was preserved down to the very time that
Josephus lived in, who assirms himself to be an Eyewitness of it: and by this
we may see, that the first Man had understanding in the Motions of the Heavens.
In my foregoing Chapters, I have described to you, what Instruments the ancient
Hebrews figured out their Astrology by, and the Table of Atlas discovered.

CHAP. V.
The Astrology of the Ancients, proved out of the Holy Scripture.

FOR consirmation then of what we have here proposed, we read in Genesis, that
Leah, Jacob's Wife called one of her Sons by the name of the Planet, which is
called Gad; under which no doubt, he was born: Et peperit Zilpah, says the
Latin, following the Original, ancilla Leah ipsi Jacob filium, and ait Leah,
(...), Bagad, and vocavit nomen ejus Gad; the vulgar Translaslation and St.
Hierome, instead of Bagad translate Faeliciter, which is the same with, cum
bona Fortuna: as it is proved by St. Augustine, who reprehendeth those that
collected from the Text, that the Ancients worshipped Fortune; Unde videtur
(says he) non been intelligentibus dari tanquam illi homines Fortunam,
coluerint, etc. And that it may clearly and evidently appear, that the vulgar
Translation understands by (...), Gad, fortuna bona, which is given to the
Planet Jupiter; turn to Isaiah 65. 11. Thus you may observe, that in old time
the nature of the Planets was much observed.

Now if it be demanded, why do we not then any where else, meet with the like
Example? Jacob Ben Samuel answered, That this was observed chiefly, by reason
of the Jealousy that was between the two Sisters Leah and Rachel, Jacob's
Wives; for Leah seeing that her Sister had two Children already, which made her
so proud, that she began to boast, Comparavit me Deus cum sorore mea: fearing,
lest that after she should have given over Childbearing, her Sister would have
the upper-hand of her, and that she should be no longer beloved of her Husband;
she gave her Maid unto him, and caused him to go in unto her; and as soon as
she perceived her to be with Child, she observed so well the time of her
falling in Travel; and seeing her bring forth a Man-Child, and that under the
Planet too, as she had learned from her Husband to speak, she counted her self
to be more happy than her Sister, and would have him to be called by that name,
Fortuna.

These are the Astrological Observations of these Patriarchs, and which were
Holy and Religious, in that they wrought in these good Men a continual
Admiration of the Works of God.

But those that came after them, mixed Superstition with this Astrology of
their Forefathers; it came in a short time to be corrupted, and to lose its
first Purity.

You see in the very Beginning, that there was Enquiry after Fortune and Riches.

CHAP. VI.
An Enquiry what our Forefathers did, to search out Secrets and Wisdom in this
Elementary Life, and to know Events to come.

First, KNowledge proceeds from Him who first created all things, who appeared
in a Bush of Fire, and told us what he was, viz. I am your God, etc.

Secondly, He sends his Angels and bright Spirits, to tell us of things to come
in this our Elementary Life.

Thirdly, We are come now to take notice of the Canopy of Heaven, and the
Elements, for our Observation, or Knowledge of Things to come. Here is a
question; Whether it is possible to read any things in the Clouds, and in other
Meteors? Answ. Many ways; first, Reading may be understood by Visible Signs,
whether it be in Letters, Characters, Marks, Ciphers, Staves, Torches, Darts,
Javelins, Knots, Streaks, Colors, Holes, Points, living Creatures, or any
other sensible thing. Now all those Figures or Signs may be represented in the
Clouds three manner of ways; first, By Letters, or known Characters; secondly,
By Hieroglyphics; and lastly, By Signs and Marks.

Fourthly, The most intelligible Signs, Marks, or Characters, that are Figured
in the Clouds, are Armed Men, Battles, etc. which appear in order for many Days
together, and do give notice to Man of some sensible Event to come, and that to
the great astonishment of all those Men that would reduce all things to the
Principles of Philosophy. Twenty-four Years before the Birth of our Savior
Christ, there were two Armies seen to encounter each the other in the Air,
miraculous to be seen: the running of their Horses, the voice of Men, and the
clashing of their Armor. Soon after was this Vision made known to the World:
for Marius and Sylla, by their Factions, making as it were a Shambles of the
Field, were the cause of so much Bloodshed (Joseph. de Bell. Jud. l. 7. c. 12.)
The Romans never received a greater Blow.

Many such Instances we may speak of ne^ home, but I am afraid my Book will
swell too big

The Philosopher gives us these Verses to the same effect:

Qui else se forment, en cet diverse portraicts don't,
Les ventes, les transforment
En Centaurs, Serpens, Hommes, oyse aux poissons,
Et d'une form, en autre errent en cent Fasons.
Englished thus:

How into several Forms themselves they throw,
Which Winds change into Shapes of things below;
Birds, Fishes, Serpents, Centaures, Men, and thus
Shift, in a round of Figures various.
Fifthly, Observation of Knowledge is from the Air, the Clouds being a
Representation of things here below, and consequently purely natural, and are
formed by the Providence of God. Of this latter Kind, are those spoken of by
the Author of the History of the Maeccabees, where Judas fighting in Heavens
Quarrel, had an Apparition sent him, of five Horsemen appearing in the Air,
which pursued his Enemies strongly, that above 20000 fell on the place;
besides, this Prodigy happened also in a clear day, when the Air was not
darkened with Clouds. So, I may be of the opinion with Cardan and Pomponatus;
that oftentimes, we may see in the Air or Cloud, as in a Looking-glass.

Sixthly, Now we come to that of Rain, wherein we can make no other use of
Reading, but by Hieroglyphics; and of this kind is the Raining of Blood, or
Water of the Color of Blood, such as fell in Switzerland, Anno 1534. which
fell upon Peoples Clothes in the form of Crosses.

Picus Mirandula has given a large Copy of Verses; among which, you have the
Story of a wonderful Deliverance, as follows:

Permixtamque crucem rubo spectavimus olim,
Nec morum discrimen erat, sacer atque prophanus,
Jam conspecta sibi gestabant mystica; Patres
Conscripti and pueri, conscriptus sexus utraque,
Et Templae, and Vestes, a summa Caesaris aula,
Ad tenues vicos, ad dura mapalia ruris,
Cernere erit liquido deductum ex Aethere signum.
The same kind of Rain figured like Crosses, which happened in the time of Julian
the Apostate; it signified, the Sufferings of the Church, and the Ignominy of
the Cross, as you may see in the Chronicle for several Years, as 747, 783, 959,
1503, 1507. you shall find, the like has been the Forerunner of such Truths. It
has been observed in Germany, that an intolerable Dearth happened, to
despair; they were suddenly comforted by a Shower of Wheat, which was (...) to
fall from the Clouds, signifying a great plenty of Corn.

Seventhly, Also Meteors, though they are naturally produced, do yet sometimes
serve for Sig^ which God makes use of when he intends t^ communicate unto us
some Secrets. As for the Wonders of the Israelites, they were in Hebre^ Letters
or Characters; (...), Vau, very perfectly expressed: and this was the reason,
(say they) that the Israelites wondering at this Character (...) Vau, saying
one to another, (...), Manh^n, viz. What means this (...), Vau? and so on to
a thousand Mysteries, and raising strange kinds of Significations, Exodus 6.
When they saw this Letter, which is numb. 6, signifying, that six days of the
Week, they were to gather their Manna.

This (...) Vau signifies, the Misery and Sorrow wherewith God threatened them
for Murmuring; they say, it is the Hieroglyphick of Labor and Servitude,
appears out of Levit. 25. Exodus 21. and signifies Labor; they were to work six
days.

The Meteors or Signs in the Heavens, have produced great things in these our
Days; but being frequent, I shall not mention them. But the Observation of the
Jews is something pretty.

Eighthly, Snow, Hail and Fro^t, do sometimes bear strange Characters, the
Reading whereof we will not neglect: There have been often seen, strange
Figures, which have born a Cross, a Buckler, a Heart, or a Death's Head. It Is
not many years since those Hieroglyphical Figures were seen in Provence; and
soon after a destruction of Beasts: and a little while after that, this
miserable Country had their Fields covered with Soldiers, and all their strong
Places Besieged and Assaulted, with so much Bloodshed, that the very Memory of
it will be always grievous unto them. The Story of these Figures confirms that
which Cornelius Gemma has obobserved, in these words, Inventa est saepius
Grando cui futurarum rerum manifest e ut more Clypei, aut Pugnae, aut Crucis
insculpta imagines spectarentur. Kepler has observed, that the Snow is not
without its Wonders: but no more of this.

Ninthly, The Rainbow, one of the most Noble Meteors that is formed in the
Clouds, namely, that the Figure of it (as R. Capel says) represents the Letter
(...) Caph, which the Jews writes in this manner (...), which might be the
reason why God placed it in the Heavens, to be a sorrowful Memorial of the
Deluge; for this Letter stands for 20, which is the number of Sorrow. Jacob
served in Laban's House 20 Years; Joseph was sold for 20 Pieces of Silver; the
flying Roll, wherein was written the Sins of all Men, and was 20 Cubits long;
and at 20 years of Age the Israelites began to serve in the Wars.

Helena in Homer, complained of her own Misfortune, takes notice of this number
20. Quatuor hic jam lustra moror, quo tempore nunquam
Iratus misera mihi verba indigna dedisti.


Also the Poets, when they expressed any thing of Sorrow, in this Number 20.
Thus Ulysses is reported, to have undergone 20 years Misfortune.

Quosque tuli, post tot Terrae Pelagique labores,
In patriam veni, jam nunc labentibus annis Vicenis.
Many more of the like nature are produced by Bungus.

Tenthly, Comets are the chiefest, which are in use in the Discovery of such
Secrets, which is usually the Death of Princes. Julius Caesar died shortly
after the appearance of a Comet; this is no News: But we may take an Example of
this present Time, where effects of a Comet is fresh in mind; I saw my self,
with many others, a strange Comet but two days before the Duke of Monmouth was
taken in the West, and a Blazing Star over all Europe, before the Death of K.
Charles II. These are the true Signs, which God is pleased to foretell of great
Troubles to come.

I will give you the words of Virgil. -- Non alias Coelo toties cecidere sereno
Fulgura, nec diri toties arsere Cometae.


They do not only respect Death of Kings and Princes, but also of great and
mortal Diseases, Drought, and Barrenness of Fruit, a strange Heat in the Air.

Eleventhly, Here is another sort of Reading, which might be performed in the
Air; first, it may be taken from the flying of Cranes; of which St. Jerome
says, Grues viam sequuntur ^^dine literato; flying in order, and keeping their
Ranks: at an instant that the Wind turns, by this means they defend themselves
from Assaults; for on which side the Eagle comes, he encounters with nothing
but Bills; just as a Body of Horse setting upon a Body of Foot, meets with
nothing but Points and Pricks.

Now the Letters and Forms, shows us only the diversity of the Winds, or else
their manner of ordering themselves in Battle; the History of Birds and Fowls
of the Air, is wonderful in knowledge and Apprehension, too large for ^is Place.

But meeting with a Verse of Ovid, touching this matter, I must go on further.
Many call Ovid a Heathen; if so, he was a witty one.

Os Homini sublime dedit, Coelumque videre
Jussit, and erectos ad sidera tollere Vultus.
God with a lofty Look did Man endue,
Commanding him the Heavens and Stars to view.
Observation has been taken, from the meeting together of the two Superior
Properties of Nature, viz. and, in matters of the Church, Laws and Governments,
which may well be the Alteration of Kings, Princes (...) Governments, etc.
being Seven in number.

The first meeting of and from the beginning of Times, was in 600 years of the
world, viz. 3200 before Christ. The second was in the year of the World 1600.
The third did fall out 2400, which was 1600 years before Christ. The fourth, in
the year 3200 of the World. The fifth, the coming of Christ 4000 years of the
World. The sixth falls out in 800 years after Christ which was 4800 years of
the World. And the seventh was 1600 years after Christ.
Now the Effects or Wonders of them, are, (...) First, Under Enoch; his name
signifies (Catechized) as, Genesis 14. 14. (Chanikan,) Catechized or Trained up in
Religion as well as Warfare^ he was taught of God to walk with God; he ^ved 360
years before his Translation, after good pleasing Life; he was as the Patriar^
were, viz. as a chief Bishop in his time; and (...) his Labors the Church was
preserved in (...) Age.

The second Meeting of and.
This fell in the time of Noah, 1600 years of the World; in which Century the
Universe Deluge destroyed the wicked World, whi^ then was drowned in
Wickedness; before it was drowned in Water. Noah was in his Ark a who^e year,
with all his Provisions, from November to November again.

The third Meeting of and, in.
Falls in the year of the World 2400, under Moses, when the Church had again
another Sabbath of Rest, from her long and grievous Slavery in the Brick
Bondage of Egypt. Read the Scripture of the place, and you will find, that they
were to make Brick without Straw.

The fourth Meeting of and,
Falls in the 3200 years of the World; this Meeting came under Solomon and the
King of Israel; according to the famous Tycho Brahe, the Church had a resting
time from Trouble, etc. the Scripture tells you so.

The fifth Meeting of and.
Under this, came our Savior Christ, who is greater than great Solomon, Mat.
12. 42. He is the Prince of Peace: This was a little more than 4000 years of
the World.

The sixth Meeting of and,
Falls in the year of the World 4800, that brought in Charles the Great; under
whom was the Roman Empire, in the time of Leo III. being Pope, who prostituted
his Keys to the Emperor's Feet: for which the Popish People pulled out his
Eyes, and cut off his Tongue. Read the History, Prideaux's Introduct. p. 96.

The seventh Meeting of and.
There are a parcel of irrational Animals, which speak very scandalously
against Predictions; they say, That we can speak nothing true of things to
come, unless told of it before, or when they are past.

Now let the World judge, and speak as they find; in the Year 1682, I then
published a Book, Entitled, Speculum Mundi, in which are now to be seen, the
very Actions of these great Revolutions. It being then my chief intention, to
discover to the World, those great things Providence was probably likely to
bring to pass, from the Influences of the Meeting of the two great and
superior Beings, the two Rulers of the World, viz. and, and likewise from the
great Eclipses of the, in Anno 1684, such an Eclipse has not been these
hundred Years, and at that present time so many Planets in the House of
Religion. Then in page 2, you will find, I cried out with Admiration and
Astonishment, with the words of Dionysius Areopagita, who seeing the strange
Eclipses of the and, at the very hour of our Savior's Passion, saying,

Aut Deus Naturae patitur, aut Mundi machina dissolvitur!

Which is, either the God of Nature suffers, or the Frame of this World is
dissolved.

So in page 4. I delivered my Judgment, that here would be great Alterations in
most parts of Europe, of Laws, Customs, Constitutions of People in Matters of
Religion, and Changing of Kings and Kingly Government.

And is not this all true! Were not the Popish Principles the root or cause of
these Mutations and Changes? And did not a Prince come from Holland with a
handful of Men comparatively, to that brave Army of K. James's? And when this
handful of Men came toward them, they all fled as the Chaff before the Wind;
and to Admiration, K. James himself fled to France, when none persuaded him
from his three Kingdoms; and then (soon after) the Prince of Orange was Crowned
King of England.

O that such things should be done without a drop of Bloodshed! Surely Reader,
this is from the Powers above; and the Powers above gave us a foresight of it
by the Rulers and.

This has been so admirable, that our Athenians have taken notice of in their
Book, in asking a Question, Whether a small irrational Creature as a Spider,
had not a Heart? Because, when Death or Oppression comes, it struggles, and
makes a bustle to save its self; intimating, that K. James neither strove nor
struggled, to save his three Kingdoms or Credit. This was a Comical Joke on the
poor Abdicated K. James.

Observe the following things; After the Death of K. Charles, the Popish Party
began to Rule, and quickly after suppressed, and cut off the Head of the Duke
of Monmouth: then the Prince and Princess of Orange was Crowned King and Queen
of England; and not long after Queen Mary dyed, with a long and tedious War of
nine Years standing: so this Revolution is a wonder to human Reason; the
Circumstances whereof would fill a large Volume.

As for the small Conjunctions, I leave to the Astrologers, which happen once
in 20 Years.

CHAP. VII.
The Stars are reckoned a Form of Letters, according to the Opinion of the
Hebrews, and that it is possible to read there whatsoever is to happen
throughout the whole Universe.

REader, did you never take notice of the Celestial Writing, seeing that the
Scripture so plainly speaks of it?

Pray take notice of this curious piece of Antiquity: Seeing that the Heavens
are Books, and at the last day, they are to be rolled together, as a Book or
Rolls; therefore they must have Letters. And I am willing to give you the
method of the ways of the Old Hebrews, who searched after the Heavenly Writing
for News.

And for confirmation of this, observe a Book, Entitled, Narratio Joseph, in
his time highly in esteem amongst all Men; wherein the Patriarch Jacob gave his
Blessing to all his Children, telling them, That he had read in the Tables of
the Heavens, all that ever was to befall them and their Posterity. Legi (says
he) in Tabulis Coeli quaecunque contingent vobis, and filiis vestris. Where the
same Original concludes as well in this Tract, as in this Question, Utrum
Stellae aliquid Agant? as in his Book, De Facto, chap. 6. That the greatest
Mysteries may assuredly be read in the Heavens, by reason that the Stars are
disposed and ordered there, in the Form of Characters. Nay, John Damascene
says, That they are CLEAR MIRROURS; intimating, that we may see distinctly see
there, even as far as to the most secret motions of our Souls, which was the
Saying of St. Augustine.

For my part, I shall not question the Truth of it, but proceed to the
Practical Part, as the Hebrews did in their Hebrew Characters: This Holy
Language being the first in the World, and sometimes there are New Stars, which
take their Method thus:

As for Example, in this Word ACHE, if one add an L, it will be no longer ACHE
but LAKE, or if in the middle of a Word, or this Word; as thus an R, it will
alter the Word, and make it ARC; so that we see one Letter, as an L or an R,
absolutely change the whole sense; in the same manner is it with the Stars,
where the New Stars are added, varieth both in the Writing and Sense.

CHAP. VIII.
The Celestial Writing of the Ancients, and how those Hebrew Characters may be
understood, and what they portend.

TO perfectly understand this Celestial Writing, we must observe the Vertical
Stars; for, those which are over a Kingdom (says Abindan) do show whatever is
like to befall it, and as the Astrologers observe in this our time.

Now says the Author of this Celestial Writing, We know that these Mutations
shall happen on the Earth, because we see they are written in the Heavens: And
this is the reason, that R. Chomer affirms, that the aforesaid Medusa's Head,
or the Stars that compose it, did foretell the lamentable Desolation of Greece;
because, that five of the principal Stars did for a good while together, make
up this Word:



Which is in the Conjugation Charab Second, signifying, to be Desolate;
understanding particularly this of Greece, over which these Stars did shine;
because that the number of its Letters, which are Jod, Vau, Nun, and which
being put together, make up (...) Javan, that is to say, Greece does yield the
same number that Charab does; as you may behold in the following Example.

2 2 8

^^^

Charab.

Destroyed, Desolate.

Sum -- 12

5 6 1

^^^

Javan.

Greece.

Sum -- 12



According to these Principles, any Man might foresee by the putting the Stars
together of the same Constellation, the destruction that Italy was threatened
with.

One Junctin, and Italian Priest, who was a great Astrologer, has these words:

Illud vero (says he, speaking of this Medusa's Head,) nunc Apuliae and
Neapolitanorum Regno est verticale, moxque Italiam invadet; quibus suam quoque
cladem allaturum esse, maximopere est verendum.

Now how long beforehand, these Celestial Letters do fore-shew the Changes
that are to happen, you are to take notice of the Hebrew Letters
beforementioned.

In the next place, the method how to be able to understand this Celestial
Writing; we must learn to know the true Stars, as Oriental, Occidental,
Meridional, and Septentrional; the Quarters of the Heavens are very essential
in this way of Reading: For if we desire to know the good Fortune and
Prosperity of a Kingdom, or any other Affair, we must read those Letters which
are vertical to it, or which want not much of being so, from the West toward
the East; and if you would be informed of the ill Fortune, look out, and read
from the North toward the West.

This is the way of the Hebrews. Now concerning the Rules laid down; some
certain Secrets of this Celestial Writing, which are spoken of by R. Rapol,
Chomer and Abindan, which are the Three which have most written on this
Subject. I have before shown you, how the Stars of the Constellation, called
Caput Algol, being vertical to Greece, did foreshew the Destruction of it. The
like is to be observed in the rest of the Stars, when they are vertical to any
other Kingdom; though they are ordered, and are to be understood otherwise.

Some time before the Temple of Jerusalem was burnt and consumed by
Nabuzaradan, it was observed, that Eleven of the Stars that were the most
vertical to it, composed for a considerable time together, these five Letters:
and being joined together, makes up this word, (reading it from the North to
the West) Hickschich, which signifies to reject and forsake, without any Mercy,
and the number of Three of them added together, comes to 423, which is the
space of time that this stately piece of Building had stood.

Also, before the Jews saw their Scepter cast down to the ground, and their
Liberty carried Captive unto Babylon, five Stars were for a long time together,
observed to compose these three Mystical Letters: a word, which signifies to
break, cast down, and to drive out; and the number of the Letters, which is
505, was the number of years that the Jewish Kingdoms had stood, from Saul to
King Zedechias.

Thus the Persians or Assyrians, who were the ruin of the Monarchy of the
Jews, saw the Period of their own Empire; after that, four of the Vertical
Stars had composed these 3 Letters, which makes up the Number 208, which was
the time of the Duration of this Monarchy, which was founded by Cyrus. At the
end of which, the Grecian Empire was likewise fore-shewn by four Stars, which
made up the Verb Parad, which signifies to divide; and that in this wonderful
manner, as that the very same Letters did produce the number of years that the
Monarchy lasted, and took his beginning at that time that Alexander the Great
subdued the last Durius: R. Chomer says, that this Celestial Writing, has
pointed out the declining of two great Empires of the East, one is that of the
Turk, which was observed seven Vertical Stars, which being read from the West
to the East, makes up this Word: which signifies to be Battered, Feeble,
Languishing, and drawing to an End.

Many more suchlike Examples we may present the Reader with, concerning this
Celestial Writing, but this may give an insight of the method and way of
reading the Will of God in that Heavenly Book, which is said to be at the last
Day rolled together as a Roll of Parchment.

But if these few Examples are not sufficient for your Understanding, pray read
my Authors, Ropol, Chomer and Abindan; there you will find it expressed, that
it is not every one that can read these Hebrew Letters, or Celestial Writing,
but whom God is pleased to give that Gift of Reading; as, none but Daniel, who
was a just Man, none but he could interpret those Visions.

Remember still, that the Elementary Life of Man is very Changeable and
Transitory; it is natural for all Men to be inquisitive after future Changes and
Alterations during their Lives, seeing it is as a Bubble, or as a Snip tossing
up and down by the Waves of the Sea.

The End of the Second Book.
THE Angelical Guide. BOOK III.
CHAP. I.
The Lot of Man; showing his Chance or Fortune in this present World.

(...), DIVINATIO, signifies no more but Elementary and Earthly things; the
searching after which, concerns the Transactions of our Lives here below, by
the Power of the superior Bodies of the Four Elements and Seven Properties of
Nature, which we have formerly spoken of, and also the Twelve Signs () of the
Heavens, which sympathize with our Bodies and Actions at home, and produce good
or ill Fortune.

To be more plain, we may call it by this name, Sortitor, Consortitor: Take
your Lot, or cast your Lot.

Let us speak a Word or two of Providence.

Quid sit Providentia?

Verum esse Providentiam, cum per haec apertum est, tam per ea quae dicentur,
deinceps elucescet: dicamus igitur quid sit Providentia. Providentia est rerum
procuratio, a Deo suscepta. Definunt eandem sic; Providentia est Dei voluntas,
per quam omnia quae sunt, apt gubernantur: quod si Dei volunt as est
providentia, necesse est recta ratione, and optime, and divinissime, and qua
sola ratione recte se habeant fieri quae sunt, neque melioris ordinis esse
capacia. Necesse est autem eundem esse qui res efficiat, and effectis
provideat. Neque enim rectum est, nec decet, alium efficere, alium ea quae
effecta sint procurare; nam hoc quidem certe imbecillitatis est: multa sunt
etiam in Animalibus simulachra, and imagines eorum quae diximus: Quidquid enim
genuit, cibum quoque foetui procurat; and Homo etiam de caeteris omnibus quae
ad vitam degendam spectant, quoad ejus fieri potest prospicit: Quae vero non
provident, ob imbecillitatem non provident. Quare ostensum est, Deum esse qui
provideat, and Providentiam esse ejusdem.

Thy Lot and thy Providencs are in general, all things that thou can enjoy
in this Elementary Life; and God is the Fountain and Free-giver, and gives thee
Rules and Understanding to know them.

This is inter nos, amongst us, or our selves; to know whether the Lot will be
good or ill, is my present Task in this Chapter: but before we go on, a word or
two concerning the word LOT; it has two significations, it is first counted a
square Thing, as a Dye, or other thing cast into a Pitcher or Pot, thence to be
drawn out again, to end Strife or Difference.

This is not our meaning: But to take our Lot from him who made all things,
Acts 1. 26. not that the Event of a Lot comes from Stars, Fortune Tellers,
Devils or Saints, but from God only, whose privilege is, to order the
Succession of them. This we own as a Truth; but we are not unsensible, but that
God has laid open his Heavenly Book before our Eyes, and given ^s Knowledge,
from the Heavenly Motions and Influences of the glorious Light of his Will and
Intentions toward mortal Men. Though we find good Fortune proceeding from the
Beams of, or ill from, we are to look to God, from whence it comes, and on or
as Messengers from him: To cast Lotts upon a People, to challenge Lordships and
Power over a People, to dispose of them at their pleasure, as Men account that
which is their own, which by casting a Lot, falls to be their Portion, Joel 3.
3. Many places in Scripture may be to our purpose; but the may satisfy us, as
to divide a thing by Lot.

We all have a desire by Nature, to know what may be had by Lot.

On my Vesture did they cast Lotts.

The whole Verse runs thus:

Et quum crucifixissent eum, dispertiverunt (...) stimenta ejus Sort.

Here are near Two hundred Questions naturally desired in this Elementary Life,
to know where, when, and how, these things may fall on you by LOT, which you
may understand in this following Chapter.

CHAP. III.
The Method of Effecting these Angelical LOTTS.

THese Questions or Desires, are divided into 12 Parts; so also are the Heavens
divided into Numb. 12. being twelve Divisions, answering in particular these
twelve Questions.

These are the Deys which you may cast your Lotts withal, and the same which
the Indians, Caldeans and Hebrews, made use of, as their good Angels, in
directing their Hands to know Good or Ill in this Life: And it lies in Darkness
to this Day, by reason it is in Hebrew or in strange Characters, which are
unknown to us; and by that reason, many are afraid of this Art, because of the
Word Geomancy or Conjuration.

Now in plain English, it is no more than the 12 Signs of the Zodiac, and the 7
Properties of Nature, or Rulers of the World, which we have formerly spoken
of, viz., composed and joined together, according to Strength, Weakness, or
Meanness.

Take the Example by this Table.

This Table being so plain, it needs no further Explanation: therefore we will
proceed to show you, how to project a Figure, wherein you may understand your
Lot.

First consider, before thou Raisest these 16 Lotts, that it is a Divine Work;
for it is the Divine Power above, or thy good Angel which guides thy Hand:
Therefore be thou prudent (...) all this Matter, free thy self from Passion and
Malice: Let not thy Head or Fancy be captivated with strong Wine: for if thou
art vain and childish in this Work, thou will bring thy self to Disgrace; for
in it lies a great Mystery, in Raising those Figures by an Angelick Hand.

I shall say no more; but pray mind the Groundwork, and consider from whom thy
Lot comes; it is from him which is the Maker of all things, which gives thee
thy Lot, and casts thy Dey for thee.

CHAP. IV.
How to Project a Figure, wherein you may understand your Lot; it being the
Divine Power above, or thy good Angel which Guides thy Hand.

HEre you shall have an Example, in order that you may make Strokes, Stars,
Circles, Pricks; as thus:



When thou go about these, look on the four Fingers; for you are to prick
four lines, o^^ longer than the other, as your Fingers are which serves for the
first Element, and four line^ more for the second Element, and four mo^^ for
the third, and so for the fourth, etc. a^ at every end of the Lines, leave Two,
or One But number them not when you prick the^ down, but follow this Example:

Remains (...)

Now I would know what would Remain? take my Pen and bring two and two
together, (...) you may observe in the uppermost Line.

And as this, Remains (...)

So this in Pricks.

Remains 1.

So couple them together, and you will (...) what will remain.

Now we will Frame the four Elements, or four Figures, as follows.



Behold the first four Lines; the odd makes (...) the first Figure, and the
other 3, 4 lines, make (...) in all 1, 2, 3, 4 Figures, which are set in or^^r
in the following Page.



These four are called the Increase or Man from whence all the other Figures
are Pr^ced; the first is attributed to the Fire, the (...) con^ to the Air, the
third to the Water, and (...) fourth to the Earth. From these four, co^ four
more, in taking of the first four Heads (...) Stars for the first Figure, the
second Stars for (...) second Figure, the third Rank of Stars for (...) third
Figure, and the lower Rank for the (...) Figure; which makes Eight Figures.



Now from these 8 Figures, you are to mak^ four more.

Observe, you must take the first Stars (...) the first, and two Figures just
under them: i^ the Stars be even, so place them: and if they be uneven, as one:
so the two Figures: and so of the third and fourth: you must do as mu^ ^o make
the ninth Figure, as you did the first and second, and also the tenth, eleventh
and twelfth; (...) here by Example.



Now we will show you, how to frame the Witness and the Judge, out of the
foregoing Fi^re: The Witness called Right, is taken from ^m the ninth and tenth
Figure, the Left is from (...) eleventh and twelfth; and from the two Witnesses
we form the Judges; and if those are ^od Figures, the Demand will be good; if
ill, (...) will come to a bad End.

Here is the whole Figure in the old Fashion.





This is the Way and Method of Raising your Lotts, which are 16 in all, and
cannot be more, and by those well understood, you may see how Transitory your
Elementary Life is: But to be more plain, we will make use of these Lotts in
the manner and form as the Astrologer does, viz. in 12 Divisions of the Heavens
or Earth, which you please to call it, and the two Witnesses and Judges in the
Model. Behold the Figure on the other side.

Thus, after you have raised your Lotts of Figures, you may easily transform
them in this manner as you see, viz. into Signs and Planets united, as you have
in the foregoing Tables, or as in this Figure, where you have the true Method
and Form of all your Lotts in English Names; for we have cast off all the
strange and hard Characters and Names of the Arabians, Hebrews, Greeks and
Latins, because you should not be frightened thereby, or of the Word Geomancy or
Conjuration, etc.

CHAP. V.
The Power and Strength of these Lotts, and how the Divine Spirits are infused
and incorporated into them, by the Influences of the Seven Properties of Nature.

IN this Chapter, you will be shown the great Strength, Ability, Force and
Power of those 16 Lotts, and how the Divine Spirits are infused into the 16
Figures, by the Seven Properties of Nature, by the Power of him which made the
World, and how the Planets and Spirits are incorporated into the Figures.

All inferior Bodies are exemplified by the superior Powers or Spirits, which
are above our Bodies, Minds or Souls.

They place themselves very intelligibly in the Soul of the World, differing
the one from the other by absolute Forms; so that all Power in God, is but one
Form; but in the Soul of the World, they are many: they are placed in the midst
of all things; whether they be joined to the Body, or separated from the Body;
by a certain Participation they are placed in Nature, as certain small Seeds of
Forms, are infused by the Power above.

They are placed also in those 16 Figures; whereon the Shapes and Properties of
Virtues of inferior Species, as also their Properties do depend; so that every
distinct Lot or Figure, has its Power that is suitable to its Form: which
also proves a wonderful Power, according to the Disposition of things, good or
ill; for all these Influences, these Figures may be received, and may also be
hindered by the indisposition of the Matter, or according to the Person, or his
Quality: such is the signification of the Lotts, which receive Virtue and Power
from above: Thus the Seven Properties and their Powers are incorporated into
these 16 Lotts, and are the cause of the Virtue of the Figures, of their
Signification, of their Product, and all things past, present, and to come.

In the next place, those that intend to understand the Lotts aright, must know
their Elements. By which, you may see from whence all things come, whence
Mankind and Beasts; whence Fire, Rain, Snow and Earthquakes are; the great
Sea-beats over her Banks, and then again returns; whence the Power and Strength
of Herbs, Courage and Rage of Brutes, all kind of Stones, and all sorts of
Worms, etc.

First, The Element of Fire is the Principle of all the other; for it is the
reception of all Celestial Rays and Influences; in it are contained Seminal
Virtues of all things.

Secondly, The Element of Water is wonderful, and to be admired; for there is
so great a necessity of Water, that there is no living Creature can live
without it; the moistnings of Water can bring forth in it the Seminary Virtues
of all Vegetables, etc.

Thirdly, The Element of Air, is a Vital Spirit passing through all things, and
gives Life to all Living or Breathing whatever, and unites its self into all
mixed Bodies.

Fourthly and Lastly, These four Elements are the ground of all compounded
things, viz. Fire, Air, Water and Earth; of which all Elementary inferior
Bodies are comprehended, not by way of heaping up together, but by
Transmutation and Motion; and when they are destroyed, they are dissolved into
Elements again: for there is none of the sensitive Elements that are pure, but
they are more or less mixed, and apt to be changed one into the other.

CHAP. VI.
The various Significations, Names and Qualities, of the Sixteen Lotts, or
Figures, as they relate to the four Quarters of the Year.

First, THE Spring Quarter has these four Lotts in order, four in every
Quarter, as follows:

these in Latin; Albus, Fortuna Major, Puella, Acquisitio, Tristitia, Populus,
Caput Draconis.

The Female, are Amissio, Via, Conjunctio, Ru^, Carcer, Laetitia, Fortuna
Minor, and Cauda Draconis.

The English Names are as follows:

1. Wh^^e, 2. Great Fortune. 3. Girl. 4. Obeying. 5. Sa^^ness. 6. People. 7.
Height. 8. Lost. 9 Way. 10 Together. 11. Red. 12. Prison. 13. ^^y. 14. Little
Fortune. 15. Below. 16. Youth, (...) Beardless Boy.

Example: If you find a Masculine Lot in a Masculine House, governed by a
Masculine Planet, it shows the Person to be manly; if Female, more womanly, etc.

These Lotts are Quadrupeian; viz. Youth, Joy, great Fortune, Obeying, Prison,
all four-footed Creatures.

Fruitful People, Red, Low, Joy, Way.

Barren, White, Great Fortune, Together, Sad.

Courteous, are, White, Together, Sad, Girl,

Slow-voic'd People, Way, Red, Low, Joy.

The use by way of Example: Suppose you have those Figures and Planets
incorporated into the Ascendant, as Puer, Amissio, Fortuna Major, Fortuna
Minor, Acquisitio, Caput Draconis, Carcer, Cauda Draconis: The condition of the
Party is something of the nature of the Creature which the Planets, Figures or
Lotts, signify. If the Lot be Puer, the Man or Person is rash and hasty, etc.
if Amissio, steadfast and resolved, his Countenance or Complexion swarthy, and
so on; for the Signs and Planets signify any thing that may be proposed.
Consider always, the Strength and Weakness, good or ill by Nature: If we find
when a Question is asked, That Albus, Conjunctio, Puella, or Tristitia, is in
the Ascendant, then we may expect the Party to be of civil Carriage, very easy
to be Pleased, and of a good Understanding.

This Table differs but little from that of Astrology, only for your
satisfaction, to see how the Lotts or Figures are united in Nature with the
Signs and Planets.

First, Planets. Secondly, Figures. Thirdly, Houses. Fourthly, Exaltation.
Fifthy, Triplicity. Sixthly, Detriment, Loss and Fall.

First, You have that Figure or Lot called Puer; it tells you, that he is of
the nature of the Sign, and his Planet, and of his House. Secondly, You have
the Planets House by Day and Night; if you find it so in a Question, it is as a
Man in his own Castle, strong and powerful. Thirdly, If in his Exaltation, as a
Man proud, and without fear or care. Fourthly, In Triplicity, as a Man in
Business or Trading. Fifthly, If in his Detriment, as a Man going the way of
Ruin. Sixthly, If in his Fall, as a Man ruined, or in Prison.
CHAP. VII.
The Signification of the Words, Direction and Retrogradation; with the
distinction of the Houses, which are Good, and which Bad.

NOw Direction and Retrogradation are two. First, Dir. signifies, a Man to go
swift in ^is Business or Trade; then Retr. signifies, one to decay, or to
consume his Money.

This following Table of Lotts, gives you to understand, what Figure or Lot is
Direct, and which Retrograde, and signified by three Letters; as I have shown
in my first Demonstration of the Figures, or Lotts.

A Table of Direction and Retrogradation in LOTTS.


We have already told you, that this Work is divided in 12 parts or Houses: Now
observe, some are good, and some again are ill.

First, Good, 1, 10, 11, -- Houses. Secondly, Mean, 2, 3, 4, and 9, -- Houses.
Thirdly, The Evil, 6, 7, 8, and 12, -- Houses.
Observe these Rules, and you will have Knowledge.

The Houses, wherein the Lotts or Figures are Good, or Bad.
Acquisitio, Good Fortune, Profit; and in all other things, it is good in the
12th and 3d Houses. Puella, Good in all Demands, wonderful for Women; very good
in the 9th and 5th Houses. Laetitia, Good Fortune, Joy, present or to come;
it is found good in all the Houses, but wonderful in the 5th House, and
indifferent in the other. Caput Draconis, is good with good, and ill with ill,
good in the 2d and 7th Houses, and bespeaks a good Issue, when there is hopes
of Gain. Amissio, good Fortune, loss of Substance; good in the 8th House, and
very ill in the 2d House. Fortuna Major, good Fortune for Gain, for things
where Prisons or Distractions are good in the 1st, 9th and 11th Houses.
Tristitia, is very ill in all the Houses, except in the 8th and 12th Houses;
there good. Albus, Good Fortune, Money, or Entertainment in some certain place;
therefore good in the first and 4th Houses. Puer, very ill in all Questions and
Demands, except in the 2d and 6th House, where he is mean. Carcer, ill in the
6th 8th, 7th and 12th Houses; signifies always, to be stayed, kept, (...)
hindered. Cauda Draconis, is very good with ill, and very ill with good; shows
well for lost things, and passing out of trouble; good in the 4th, 6th, 9th,
and 12th Houses. Populus, is good with good, and ill with ill good in the 10th,
and ill in the 8th House. Fortuna Minor, good in any Business, or swift
Matters; very good in the 2d, and very ill in the 8th House. Conjanction, good
with good, and ill with ill; signifies, restoring of lost Things, and much
Gain. Rubeus, very ill in all good things, and in all ill things; if in the
first House, signifies Death, or some Plague. Via, Spoiling of all other good
things, except in Questions of Journies, coming out of Prisons, or moving; good
in the 3d, 5th, and 11th Houses, and brings good News.

The Aspects of the Houses, and the Figures, you may see by the Table on the
other side.

The Use of this Figure, is of great consequence; the outwardmost, are 12 Lotts
or Figures; the second, is their Nature, as to Masculine and Feminine; the
third, is the 12 Signs of the Zodiac, with their Elements, being united with
the 12 Houses, etc.

Then lastly, in the middle, you have the Lines and Aspects from one House to
another, both dexter and sinister; the first House begins with the Sign, and so
in order; which will give you a clear light of the usefulness of your Lotts,
either for good or ill: A Figure in the first House, beholds another in the
eleventh House with a Sextile dexter Aspect, and so of the rest.

The Houses are fixed, movable, and common.

First, Fixed, 2, 5, 8 and 11 -- Houses. Secondly, Common, 3, 6, 9 and 12 --
Houses. Thirdly, Moveable, 1, 4, 7 and 10 -- Houses.
Albus and Laetitia, are double-Bodied.



Observe, what by a Figure or Lot is here meant.

Acquisitio is raised by Pricks, as,

And taken for the Nature, Virtue and Power of dir. in, which makes a complete
Figure, as dir., joined and united together, as one Body, and so of the rest;
Planets are joined to the Figures, some Retrograde some Direct, which differs
much from the Rules of Astrology: for they place in, and in, etc. but ours are
select Bodies.

On the other side, I will give you a Table of the Hours of the Lotts, and the
Planets.

The Use of the Hours of the Lotts.
When you raise a Figure of Lotts, observe what Day and Hour it is.

Example. In the Table of Hours, you will find the seven Days and Nights: so if
you find the Lot in the Ascendant Lord or Lady of the Hour, so much the
stronger.

Suppose I Raise a Figure of Lotts on a Monday, the first Hour in the Forenoon,
I find Via, decr. in. I look at the top of the Table, and find Fig. 1. I guide
my Eye down to Monday, and find Via; so he is Lord of my Ascendant and Hour; so
observe in all the rest, etc.

Now in erecting your Lotts, in the main there are but 12 Figures, though 15
makes up a Figure; for Three are taken from them, viz. two Witnesses and one
Judge.

The signification of the two Witnesses are thus:

The Witness placed at the right hand, is put for the Querent, and rules all
the right side, as, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10; it gives you light what the Question is,
before propouided.

The left Witness, contains all what the Figures signifies in that side, as 5,
6, 7, 8, 11 and 12.

The right Witness tells you of Joy, Pleasure and Happiness, of him that asks
the Question of things past.

The left Witness tells you of ill luck to come, or things enquired after, if
ill Figures; if good judge otherwise; right for the Querent, and left for the
things desired, and belongs to no House; only taken from others, to give a
judgment on things demanded.

The Judge is the 15th Figure produced from the two Witnesses, to judge of the
end of things demanded, and to know, if it is good or bad. Some say, that the
Judge ought to be even; if not, give not judgment on it.

If the Judge be good, the Question will come to a good end; if ill, the
contrary. If the Judge agrees with the right hand Figures, good to the Querent,
and things demanded; if it is the same with those of the left hand, it signifies
ill to the Querent of the matter desired.

Thus far we have shown you the Method of the 16 Figures, whereby you may know
and find the Power and Strength, Weakness and Feebleness of your Enemies, by
this Divine Way of Working.

CHAP. VIII.
The Elementary Powers above, ruling over Elementary Bodies here below: wherein
is discovered the Significacation of the Sixteen Figures in the Twelve Houses;
also the Shape and Proportion of Human Bodies, represented by those Sixteen
Figures or Lotts.

IN my former Chapter, I have demonstrated to you, near Two hundred Questions
to be Answered, naturally desired in this Elementary Life, and easily to be
answered by these Lotts: As you may see, the Questions are divided in 12 Parts,
or Houses; therefore, when you have a Question to be resolved, turn your Eyes
to the foresaid Chapter, and you will find what House it belongs to.

As for Example; If for your self, the first House or Ascendant; if for Money
or Goods, the second; if concerning Brothers or Sisters, the third; if the
Father, the fourth; if Pleasure and Children, the fifth; and so of the rest.
Mind still, that the Ascendant is for him that asks the Question, and the other
Houses are to answer the Question: and according to the Nature, Power and
Strength of your Lot or Figure, judge of the Matter or Thing enquired after,
either good, or ill Success, etc. Here follow certain Tables, which are the
Foundation of the whole Work.

The Shape of the Body of Man, by the Sixteen Figures.

Woman in like manner. Middle stature, (...) face, little head, ta^ncy, high
colored, a little down-look'd proud, a vagabond, given to all kind of
wickedness, as whoreing, robbing and stealing; and so the Woman.

Note, That you are to vary your Judgment according to the Houses, Aspects and
Company, both for stature of Body, and Nature: or if a good Figure be in a good
House, it augments the goodness; but if an ill Figure be in an ill House, it
multiplies the evil; which makes a cursed Person for all ill: If you find a
good Figure in a bad House, you may suppose, it will be good for the present,
and will last but a small time; and so judge according to Reason.

The good Houses, 1, 5, 10, 11. The mean, 2, 3, 4, 9. The ill, 6, 7, 8 and 12.
Also consider the Strength and Weakness of the 16 Lotts, by the foresaid Rules,
and the Table of Hours; for in it, there is the Power and Strength of the
Figures.

A Signification of the Sixteen Lotts, moving from the first House to the other
Eleven.
Acquisitio in the First, and goes into the Second; gains Money and new
Clothes. In the Fifth, Joy of Children, and good ones; and a pleasant Life. In
the Third House, Honor, Joy and Profit by Relations. In the Sixth, Gain by
good Servants, and also by small Cattle. In the Fourth, good b^ ^ a good end of
^ Acti* In the Seventh, a good end with thy Enemies; a good Wife, and good in
all Demands. In the Eighth, Dearth for the thing demanded, and great Profit in
Succession. In the Fourth, Differences between the Father and Children, loss of
Inheritance. In the Ninth, good in Sea Voyages, and in all Church-concerns. In
the Fifth, Merriments, dangerous and ill with Big-belly'd Women. In the Tenth,
Love and Respect from Kings and Princes, and Profit from the Mother. In the
Sixth, Differences with Servants, and loss of small Cattle. In the Eleventh,
Good Friends, and a good End of the Demand. In the Seventh, not good to Marry,
loss of thy Mistress. In the Twelfth, Imprisonment, and a great many Enemies.
In the Eighth, loss of Goods, of thy Wife, and Enemies. Amissio in the first,
and found in the second; loss of Money and Goods. In the Ninth, robbed by the
way, ill for Church Matters. In the third House, Controversies with Kindred,
and ill in Journies. In the Tenth. Anger wi^ Kings, Lordds and Princes. In the
Eleventh, thy Friends are false, and envious to thee. In the Twelfth, nothing
but Imprisonment, and loss of Cattle, and disturbed with Enemies.

These two Lotts, Acquisitio and Amissio, may serve you as an Example for all
the rest, if you observe their Natures; one is good, and the other bad; as you
see Acquisitio, is throughout all the Houses, good in all things, according to
the nature of the House, or Matters they signify: so likewise Amissio, is ill
in all things or demands, which may be drawn from the 12 Houses, as you have
been formerly taught; and also, what Lotts are good or ill, and the good and
ill Houses. So vary your Judgment accordingly.

Again, If the second House or Lot, go into the third, thy Brethren will rule
over thy Goods; the fourth, thy Father; fifth, thy Children, or the Alehouse;
and so of the rest, according to the Rules of all the other.

If the Question be, Shall I see or speak with my Brother? If thy Lot is found
in the third House, it is a true testimony that thou shall speak with thy
Brother; and so on.

Concerning good Company.
Good Company is to be much desired, and ill Company is to be abhorred; it is
good Company that brings many to Happiness, and ill, which brings many to the
Gallows.

Now we have a method in these our Lotts, to know our Company, or our
Associates and Companions. Observe this Rule; the Ascendant and the second
House, are Companions; and so observe in order, the second and third House, the
third and fourth House, the fourth and fifth, the fifth and sixth, the sixth
and seventh, the seventh and eighth, the eighth and ninth, the ninth and tenth,
the tenth and eleventh; and lastly, the eleventh and twelfth Houses. Thus they
are united together in Company.

You are now to consider the Natures and Qualities of those Lotts by the
foresaid Tables; and if you find a Lot in the second House of an ill
principle, you may be then fearful of being drawn away, or trapan'd, and
persuaded to an ill thing: if the Lotts are both good, fear not, for good may
be thy Fortune. Then again, if thou find'st a watery Lot in the first House, a
fiery Lot in the second House, then you may say, the Company is not good; and
by this Method, you may judge right of your Society in general: so, if they are
of one Nature, and of one Triplicity, you may believe, you are upon a sure
ground, etc.

CHAP. X.
A Table of the Significations, Power and Strength of the Sixteen Figures in
the Twelve Houses.

First House.
A Signification of the Sixteen Lotts, moving from the first House to the other
Eleven.
Acquisitio. Am^ssio. This Figure signifies Goodness and Prosperity in Life,
and an Accomplishment of the Person's desire; also, good success in Voyages,
and whatsoever one takes in hand. If this Question be made for Love, and in way
of Marriage, it is good; and for any thing a Lover demands in that behalf. This
has in signification, when you find it in the first House, of loss of
Inheritances and Estates; an evil Life, a bad Beginning, and ill End of any
thing undertaken, ill for Sickness, Voyages; and is evil in all Demands, except
for Prisoners, in which it signifies Deliverance. Fortuna Major. Laetitia. When
this Figure does represent, it signifies Good Will, Loyalty, Prosperity in
every thing, Joy, and much Riches in relation to Women; it signifies Joy,
Friendship among Kings and Princes; this is indeed good in all things, except
to keep a thing secret, in which it betokens small Security. The signification
of this Figure, is Peace and Quiet of Life, a true concordance and friendly
Meeting of Persons, honest, and of a good conversation; in case of Love, it
sometimes denotes Dissimulation, the person promising more than he will
perform. Fortuna Minor. Tristitia. In obtaining this Figure, it denotes Anger,
Hastiness, and Expedition in all things, and is good for the Affairs of War;
and signifies Courage and Boldness of Spirit, and Victory over Enemies; good in
Voyages, but in other things not so good. When in the first House, it has in
signification, an ill beginning of any Enterprise; this Figure indeed, is in
all things ill, except it be in searching of Treasure in the Earth; and is also
good in Matters relating to Building. Puella. Rubeus. This signifies, Joy,
Mirth, Dancing, curiously and nearly Clothed; as also, of an Amorous
Disposition, Young, and a Lover of Gardens: this is good in cases of love, and
in every thing else, but in Matters relating to War. This Figure amongst the
Ancients, signifies Crafts, Frauds, Subtilties, Treason, War, Debate,
Differences, Bat^el, Shedding of Blood; and in short, it has the signification
of all manner of Wickedness in the World. Puer. Albus. This also betokens Joy,
making of Feasts and Banquets with Ladies: it also signifies, Thefts,
Robbe^^es, Deceit and Gain in Play, swiftness in Voyages, and in Marriages it
is good enough; yet it signifies Deceits and Frauds: indifferent in all things,
but better in War, than in any thing else. This signifies Profit by Journies,
and the person is pleasant, cheerful and happy in all things: if the Demand be
a Suit of Law, that the Man shall win: if for a Message, he shall have good
News: and in Mercurial Cases, it is very good. Conjunctio. Cauda Draconis. When
this Figure is placed in this House, it is very good in all kind of Mercurial
Things: it is also good in every other thing, so that it be accompanied with
good Figures; and ill, if found with ill Figures: it always signifies Concord
and Alliance. This in the fir^ House, is in its nature like to the Fig. Rub^
spoken of before; nevertheless, this has a^ evil signification, betokening
Loss and Damage for all things that may be asked after, and good in nothing but
Ruin and Destruct on of Countries. Caput Draconis. Carcer. This signifies
Goodness in all things, except for War, signifying Battle; but for Peace, it is
perfectly good: also good for Marriage, and in Matters of Gain: in short, it is
good for all things you can demand, signifies Health of Body, Mirth, and the
love of Kings, etc. and Prosperity, obtaining what can be desired. This Figure
has the signification of ill Opinions and Melancholy Thoughts, Sorrow, Anger,

CHAP. XI.
Brief Description of the Twelve Houses; answering all Doubts and Questions,
which may be naturally desired in this our Elementary Life.

The First House.
THE Querent is, First, He or She, that pro^ pounds the Question.

The Quesited are, He or She, or Things Enqui^ after.

2dly, The Figure is Radical, when the Que^ comes to thee with true Affection
and In^on.

3dly, The Figure is verified also by certain ^s, Marks, or ^rs, about the
Querent or ^sited.

Example. If the Lotts which rule the Hour, (...) any of the four Angles, there
are Moles, ^ding to the Figure or Lotts: then consider (...) Lot in the
Ascendant; there you shall find ^es.

1. Puer, in the first House; a Scar in the Head or Face, or Burnt, or dark
Mole. 2. Conjunctio, there they are on the Belly. 3. Puella, then on the
Backbone. 4. Rubeus, on the Arms. 5. Carcer, on the Feet. 6. Via, on the Breast
or Stomach. 7. Albus, the Belly. 8. Fortuna Major, the Legs. 9. Populus, the
Knees. 10. Cauda Draconis, the Thighs. 11. Caput Draconis, the Belly. 12.
Acquisitio, the Head; Scars or Moles. 13. Laetitia, the Throat. 14. Amissio, by
the Navel. 15. Tristitia, the Secrets. 16. Fortuna Minor, a Spot on the Face.
If the Significator of the Moles be in their 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 Houses,
they are visible to the Eye: if in the other Houses, not to be se^

If the first Lot goes into other Houses, there is a Mole.

Now of the Time when things come to pa^ it is taken from three Parts, viz.
Fixed, Common, and Moveable: if the Lotts are moveable the first signifies
Weeks; if common, a Month if fixed, a Year and two Months.

Things are hindered commonly, or frustrat^ by ill Aspects, as, or ill Lotts, or
bad Company, as you have been formerly taught.

Things are finished, or brought to pass by go^ Aspects, as, or, good Company,
a^ good Lotts, etc.

In Page 125. you have a Table, of great use: showing the Names of the Lotts or
Figures, and how they are Raised, in Power or Weakness.

The Points of the Compass demonstrated, according to the Lotts, by the Twelve
Houses.


These Rules will direct you, when you have a desire to know, what Part of the
World it is best to live in; First, Look for, or good Lotts, and observe what
part of the Earth: the Compass will guide you in your Journey, and lead you to
the place of Gain.

Now we will proceed on to the 12 Houses in short, and leave out the two
Witnesses and the Judge, and draw our Judgment from the 12 Points, then raise
your Lotts, as in the beginning; you may (if you please) transform them into
Planets and Signs, etc. As Fortuna Major, dir.. and Fortuna Minor, retr., as
you are taught in the Table before mentioned.

A German Gentleman desired me to Raise this following Figure for him, who was
very desirous on several occasions, hearing of this Angelical Enquiry.

In this manner, first I raised the Lotts, and turned them into Signs and
Planets, etc.



Judgment from the first House.

The first House signifies, the Life, Temperature and Corporature, retr. in, or
Amis^ is in the Ascendent, represents this Querent wonderful, according to
former Rules, viz. a tall Man. Turn to the place of Description of the Body.

De Vita qualitate, and quantitate.

Quest. 1. Concerning Life, and length of Days.

Answer this Question; consider first, if thy Lot on the Ascendant be fixed,
movable, or common.

Secondly, Consider if thy Ascendant is free from ill Company or Aspects: if
fixed Lotts, and good Aspects, long Life; if common, a middle Age; if movable,
a short Life; if not helped with good Aspects, behold from 4, 6, 8 or 12
Houses, long Life: but if the first goes into the 6th, 8th or 12th, with ill
Company, a short Life, and the same if the first is beheld from ill Houses or
Places: I judge that our Querent may live to a good middle Age, because the
four Angles are possessed with indifferent good Lotts. His Opposite is Puella,
the 10th; it looks on the Ascendant with a, and so does the 4th; but yet we
have no need to fear a Stroke to Destruction: neither do we find, that Amissio
goes out into any other House of ill.

De Nati Accidentibus.

Quest. 2. Of the good or ill Accidents, attending Life.

It may be expected from good or ill Lotts or Figures, which possess the first
of the Principal Places of the Figure: if good, it signifies good in the whole
Life; but if it be otherwise, his days will be full of Trouble.

If Career or Tristitia is in the Ascendent, much Melancholy and Calamities may
be expected; they are two Lotts ruled by.

If Puer or Rubeus be there, generally mad, choleric, hasty sort of Persons,
because rules those two Lotts, and oftentimes meets with Thieves.

If Drag. Tail in the first, never without Scandal and Disgrace; and such sorts
of Accidents will be. And thus we must consider the good and bad.

Observe also, when the first Lot moves into an ill or good House, the
Accidents of Man may be traced, and so on.

Ill Company, and Aspects from ill Places, hinders the excess of good; so on
the contrary, the good prevents the mortal stroke of evil.

Now if you desire to know the Time of the good or ill, consider if thy Lotts
in the principal Places, be Fixed, Mean, or Common, as the former Rules direct;
so according to the good or evil Lotts, you may expect good or ill. Consider in
what part of the Figure your Lotts are; so you may easily know what is coming,
good or ill; if in the 10th House, good Lotts, Honor and Credit; if the Lot
is ill, expect the contrary. In like manner consider the rest of the Houses,
for your Knowledge.

The Chaldeans, and the old Philosophers, have given us other Rules to know the
time of Accidents, and to know the Names of Persons, which are as follows.

The First Rule*
A ret. 25 11 B Tristit. 30 58 C Caput 3 11 D^ Albus. 5 E F. Min. 1 41 F F.
Maj. 66. 56 264. G Rubeus. 19 9 H Puella. 82 6 I Acquisit. 79 13 K Caud. 2 8 L
M Puer. 120 79 N O Amissio. 6 P Q Via. 2 5 R S Carcer. 30. 154. 43 T U Populus.
5 7 X Y Conjunct. 10

The Second Rule.
Annos dat Maj. 58 Med. 44 Min. 30 47 40 12 47 40 15 82 45 19 82 45 18 80 49 20
107 39 15

The first Table shows you the Name of any Person, the Thief that has stolen,
or the name of a Town or Castle, or any strong Place, etc.

Note, The Lot on the first House, takes the first Syllable; likewise that of
the 10th, the second and third Syllable, of the Letters of the Light, which you
find in the 4th House; and so you have your desire.

Or thus: Take the Letters of the 1st and 7th House; as often as you take the
said Letters, so often move your Figures; if you find it not, take the Letters
of the 10th.

The first Figure has the first Letter of the Name; the 7th and 10th, the
Middle; the 4th and 5th, the End of the Name.

First, The Figures under the Lotts of the first, is the number of Years,
Months or Days of your Accidents. In this, consider your former Rules.

The Second Table is from the Seven Properties of Nature, which have power to
rule over the Lot or Lotts.

Example. is Governor over Carcer and Tristitia; so observe the rest in order,
etc.

Consider three several Ways, viz. Strong, Mean, or Weak.

Years 58 -- 44 -- 30

If you desire to know what part of ones Life may be best. Answer, If you find
good Lotts in the 1st, 12th, and 11th, the Querent will be happy in his
Minority; if in the 10th, 9th and 8th, in his 20th Year; if in 7, 6 or 5th, in
his middle Age; if in 4, 3 or 2d, his later, or old Age. Some say, that every
House gives 12 Years.

As for what part of the World, your Compass will guide you, where or good
Lotts are; and as to East, West, North or South, for bear those places; ill
Lotts are often there.

If thou intendest to visit a Dealer or Friend, and think, or intendest to
find him at home.

Observe these Rules; have an eye to the 7th House, because it is of Dealing,
Acquaintance; otherwise the 11th House; if Puella be in the 7th, and go into
the 10th, or in the 1st or 4th House, he is at home.

If any Lot in the 7th moves, and move into a Succedent, he is not at home,
but at his Neighbor's: if in Cadent, far off.

If thou visitest a Brother, have an eye on the 3d. house, if a Father the 4th,
if thy Master, the 10th House.

In the last place, if thou desire to know the state and condition of a
Person absent; if it be no Relation, take the 7th House, and behold what Lot
there is, and if you find him moved into the 6, 8, 4 or 12th Houses, you may
well say, he is dead: or if Via or Populus be there, it is the same.

If at any time, you find the Lot of the first; 7th, or 3d, or where ever your
Concerns are, if you find him to be moved, or go into ill Houses, as the 8th,
6th, 12th or 4th, it is in danger of Sickness, if not Death; but if it go into
good Company or Houses, you may say the Party is in good Health.

The Second House.
De Nati Substantia and Divitiis.

Quest. 1. Of the Querent's Substance and Riches.

AS for Riches, if there are in the Second House good Lotts or Figures, and
free from ill Company or Aspects, the Native will have Riches; and judge
according to Strength.

And, and Acquisitio in the First House, and also good Figures in the Second
House, viz. good Company, the Querent will be very Rich.

But, if you find good Lotts in the first, and ill Lo^^s or Company in the
Second House, it tells you, that Riches will be got, but spent extravagantly
again.

If Fortuna Major and Acquisitio in the first h. and Populus in the second h.
great Riches by Industry.

But if the 2d. Figure goes in the 11th House, of Friends, Riches will tumble
in on him.

But if he go into bad Houses, judge contrary.

Mind in what House they pass into, and judge from whence Riches or Poverty
comes.

If 3d. House, from Brethren. If 4th. from Fathers, or Old People. If 5th. from
Children. If 6th. from Servants, or Cattle. If 7th. from Wives, Dealers, or
Thieves. If 8th. from Death of Acquaintance. If 9th. from the Church, or
Strangers. If 10th. from the Master, or Person of Quality. If 11th. from many
Friends. If 12th. from a Horse, or Cow, or Prison.
Consider this well; for the Native may lose, as well as gain; if you intend to
know, consider the Houses and Lotts.

And Friends, Fnemies, Friends, Enemies, Friends, Enemies; also good and ill
Aspects.

This may satisfy the curious Reader, if I persuade no further; if Matters are
considered between Party and Party, viz. the Ascendant for the Querent, and one
of the other House, for the Question.

So this Rule may serve, to know if Money lent, when to receive it; Wages due,
if recoverable.

The Third House.
Uter ex Fratribus aut Consanguineis, prior morietur?

This place tells you of Brothers, Sisters, Neighbors, Relations, etc.

1. IF you have a desire to know the state and condition of them, familiarity
or love: consider the Lotts and Planets, of their Nature, Aspects and Company,
and their going into good Houses, and you may expect very sweetnatur'd Brethren
and Neighbors; but if thou find Rubeus, or Ca^da Dra^onis, thou may
expect a damned Pack of them, to eat thee out of house and home, and beat thee
soundly; if Populus is there, they will be about thy Ears, as a Swarm of Bees.

2. If thou art willing to know the State of an absent Brother, etc. consider
the foresaid Rules.

3. As for thy Inland Journies, follow the same Rules.

4. Try, and search, (if thou mistrust) whether Noise, or Reports are true.

5. Or, if it be good to take their Counsel.

6. As for the number of Brethren, look in the (...) House, and see how many
Aspects or Planets; there are so many Brethren. If Female Lotts (...) Planets,
you may say Sisters; if Male, Bro^ers.

Consider your Rules well, and turn to your ^rmer Tables for your Direction, to
distinguish Good from Evil.

The Fourth House.
De Fine cujuslibet Quaestionis.

THIS House is called the North-Angle of the Earth; and it is the Judgment of
many, that it signifies the Manner and Method of all things propounded by a
Question.

Note, The Quality of the Lotts of the 4th. House; if thou art willing to Buy
Land or Houses, the first is the Buyer, 7th the Seller, and the 10th h. the
Price; the 4th signifies the thing to be bought; if good Lotts in the 4th. the
thing is a good thing, House or Land, etc.

If the first Lot goes into the 4th, the Buyer will have his desire, and the
sooner, if Populus or Via be in the 4th House.

2. Will the House or Land be prosperous? if Companied well, and beheld by good
Aspects; if Carcer in the 4th House, it is good plain ground; if you find in the
4th, Puer, Fortuna Major, or Acquisitio, it is hilly and mountanous.

If Amissio, Conjunctio or Carcer, very good if Populus, Via and Rubeus, watery;
if Albus Puella,, and Tristitia, very rugged.

3. Is it good to move to another House? If thou find good Lotts in the 1st
and 4th House move not; and if the 7th House is free from il^ Company or Lotts,
it is a sign that the Place will be prosperous, where thou intendest to go;
(...) those places are ill, the contrary.

4. If Treasure is hid: See if the first Lot and 4th are good, and the first
moves into the 4th; then assure your self there is Treasure; if ill Lotts and
Company, no good.

5. If thou art willing to know, if ever to Enjoy thy Father's Estate. Consider
the former Rules; and for further light in this, if the 1st or 2d Lot goes
into the 4th House, it is a certain Testimony to enjoy the Father's Estate;
another Testimony is, if one Planet has power over the 1st and 4th House, the
same.

Now the last Question is, to let you know, how to find a thing when it is
mislaid: If the 2d Lot is in an Angle; the things are with the Querent, or
where he uses to go, or be; if the 2d go into the 11th House, then in the Hall,
Parlor, or chief Room; if the 2d go into the 10th, the place where the
Querent's Wife or Maidservant uses; if the 2d go into the 6th House, where
Servants frequent, etc. Consider the nature of the Lotts.

The Place where the Things missing are laid, according to the Points of the
Compass.
Puer, East. Fort. Maj. and Min. East by N. Acquisitio, East by S. Populus and
Via, North. Rubeus, North by W. Puella and West. Tristitia, West by N. Carcer,
South. Amissio, South by E. Canjunctio, South by W.

Turn to page 213. and you will see the Compass at large.

The Fifth House.
De Foecunditate alicujus, aut Sterilitate.

THis House gives you to understand of Fruitfulness or Barrenness in Women, or
Men; to know where the Fault lies.

In this case, you are to consider the First House, the 7th, 5th and 1^th House.

Consider your former Rules; If you find fruitful and good Lotts there, then no
fear of Children, and Pleasure enough; but if you find Barren and ill Lotts in
those Houses, you may expect the contrary; and if you find the or Tristitia, in
the 5th, or beholding the 5th, no Issue. And you may tell the Querent, that he
has but little Pleasure, and is heavy-hearted, and melancholy: judge according
to the nature of the Lotts, more or less.

It Is a certain Truth for Children, if the first go into the 5th, or the 7th
into the 11th h.

If you find Watery Lotts in the 5th house, there is generally Miscarriage.

If Female Lotts in the 5th House, a Girl.

If Masculine Lotts in the 5th h. a Boy.

If Double-bodied Lotts, Twins.

There are many which expect News, Letters, or Messengers.

The first House and Lot, to him that sent the Messenger; the 7th, and his
Lot, is him to whom the Letter is sent; the 5th, the Messenger, and his
Decision.

If the 5th House is beheld by good Lotts or Aspects, the Messenger does his
Business with Credit.

If the 5th Lot go into the 2d, the Quesited brings Money with him; if the
Lotts are ill, then it may bespeak the Letter-Carrier to be Drunk by the way,
or some ill.

In the last place, if you intend to go to Play at any Game, see if the Lot of
the 1st. House goes into the 5th, or the 7th moves into the 2d.

Again, If you find, or in the 5th h. hope well; if thou find to the contrary,
keep thy Credit, and thy Money too.

The Sixth House.
An in Morbum incursurus sit aliquis eo Anno?

THis Sixth House gives an account of Sickness. In this Concern, cast your Eyes
on the 6th or 8th Houses, and first see how they are afflicted, or if good or
ill Lotts.

And as for the Parts of the Body afflicted, they are observed from the Lotts
or Houses forementioned; as Acquisitio the Head, and so on.

If the first is found in the 6th, 8th or 4th Houses; if ill Lotts, Death is
approaching; if good, the contrary.

Consider the nature of the Signs of the said places, of Fire, Air, Earth or
Water; so judge of the Disease and Cause.

If Fiery Lotts, Fevers, or such like.

If Watery, Phlegm, and cold Humors.

If Earthy Lotts, the Rheumatism, Gout, etc.

If Earthy, then Melancholy, especially if they are the Lotts which rules, as
and, called Carcer and Tristitia, etc.

If you would know, if the Disease is Acute or Chronical; if thou find Fixed
Lotts in the 6th House, the Disease or Distemper is of long standing; if thou
find them moveable, the Disease is of a short standing.

If ill Lotts are in the 6th, 4th or 8th House, it is so much the worse; if
good, the Sick will recover speedily; but if a good Lot is in an ill House,
his Good is something lessened; likewise, an ill Lot in a good House, he is
something hindered of his Evil.

De Medico, and Medicina.
An Medicus Aegrum sit juvaturus?

PRima datur Aegro aut Quaerenti, sexta Morbo, septima Medico, decima
Medicamento: bonae existentes figurae, bonum indicant effectum, and (...)
contrario: In decimo testes and judices, multum valent, proinde considerandi:
Septima datur Medico; si igitur prima, sexta, septima sint bonae and fortunatae
and concordes, sanatum iri Aegrum a Medico sperabis, and e contra.

Quod si prima, sexta, and undecima sint bonae and fortunatae, proximam
sanitatem judicabis, and convalescentiam; quam undecima indicat.

To know if the Sick will Live or Die.

Consider, if the Lot of the First House goes from good Company to ill, the
Party will be weaker every day: and if beheld from the 4th or 8th House by ill
Aspects, the Party certainly dies. But when your Figure is ill, and moves into
good Places and Company, you may say, the Party will live, if the 6th h. does
not afflict the same; if the Lot in the 8th h. moves into an Angle, and
afflicted, Death.

If a Figure in the first goes into the 8th house, it shows Death to the Sick:
If the 8th go into the 10th house, the Party dies.

If thou intend'st to have good and honest Servants, or gain by small Cattle,
see that the 6th house is not afflicted, nor ill Company, but good good Lotts,
and thou may venture: but if not so, thou will find, that thy Servants and
small Cattle will be a plague to thee.

The Seventh House.
De Amore.
LOve is the chiefest thing which is to be enquired after in these Days, and to
know if it be durable.

Amoris firmae fixaeque, (...) Figura fixum indicant, mobiles mobilem,
bicorporeae, mediocrem. Idem indicat, si fixae Figurae sint in Angulis, aut
mobiles in Cadentibus, etc.

Quest. 1. Shall the Querent Marry?

Answ. Sure enough, if you find the first Lot and 7th Lot in good Aspects,
as, and good Company, etc. but if you find ill Lotts in the first and 7th,
beheld by a or, little hopes of Marriage.

Quest. 2. If you desire to know if thy Wife or Sweetheart is chaste, or has
another Friend: Consider well on the 7 Properties of Nature, as I have brought
the Lotts into Signs and Planets, as you see:

If in the 7th, and, and not in their own Houses, then she loves another.

If be there, she loves another, but Melancholy keeps her Chaste.

If be there, she gives stroke for stroke.

If be there, very seldom Chaste, for her fresh Blood will fly.

If be there, a Gamesom Lady, given to youthful Sports, and talks Bawdy; but
chaste, when many think her to be a Gamesom Whore.

If in the 7th House, her Fancy flies as many ways as the Wind blows, and many
pretty Sparks have left her.

If there, Chaste, but said to be a Whore.

If be in the 7th, very Chaste.

Quest. 3. If you desire to know which shall die first: Consider the first and
7th House; see which Lotts are strongest, or which weakest: the strongest live
longest, if they are free from ill Eyes of the Lotts of the 4th, 8th and 6th
Houses.

Quest. 4. An Mulier autem sit aliquem in Maritum obtentura? Videat 7 and 8, si
enim 7 cum 8 jungatur, obtinebit.

An Conjunx aut Amasia Casta sit?

Si in septima si sit, in dir. in retr. in dir. in


Castam, in retr. in retr. in full in


Corruptionem ejus, Filiorumque ab ipsa producendorum Luxuriam, retr. in retr.
in


Vide 1, 7, 12 and 8, in quibus si sit, retr. in retr. in


Aut hae Figurae seipsas invicem producant; aut saltem una ex retr. in full in


his ex aliis nascatur, impudicam significant: si sit, castam indicant. dir. in
dir. in dir. in dir. in


Si dir. in, nascatur in 9 aut 7, and sit in prima aut nona, diligit ipsa
Juvenem imberbem.

Si retr. in, aut retr. in, non possunt judicare Amasii qualitatem.

Si plen., ab illis malis Figuris in his Domibus producatur, meretricem
publicam.

Si retr. in, sit in 12, and conformetur cum 7 aut 8, ipsam amore servi consumi
significat and indicat.

If you desire the time of Marriage: if first and 7th, apply by, speedily; if
the Lotts are in the South Parts of the Figure, in a short time; if going
Occidental Septentrional, a long time before Married. If moveable Lotts in
first and 7th, then things will be brought about with great haste: And look
back to the Table which direct you to Years, Months and Days.

Quest. 4. Shall the Querent Marry more than once? See if you find
double-bodied Lotts in the place of Marriages, and also in or, the Querent may
expect to change a Dead one for a Living, many times in his Life: if otherwise,
judge the contrary.

Quest. 5. Will they agree after Marriage? If there follows ill Company, or or,
then say, they will agree like Devils, etc. But if there be good Company, and,
they will be like two Pigeons. As for the Shape or Form of the Persons, turn to
the Table of Shapes.

Quest. 6. Concerning Law and Controversies, who may have the best? This
Question is of great moment, and much in use. Consider well the first House and
the 7th, for the best and strongest Lot carries the day: therefore you that
propound the Question, if you find or good Figures in the Ascendant, you may
rejoice, for you shall pinch the heels of your Enemies.

If you consider the former Rules, viz. good or ill Lotts, good or ill Company,
the moving of the Lotts out of one House into another, the ill Aspects and the
good, you may easily Answer all things belonging to the 7th House:

As, Shall I have many Enemies?

Will there be War, or Peace?

Will the Town or Castle be taken?

Will my Dealings be with Knaves, or Fools?

Shall I lose my Dealing, Trade or Money? with other Questions by the foresaid
Rules.

Quest. 7. De Furto. Now things lost, or stolen, or mislaid, we always observe
from the 4 Angles, the 7th House, and the second House; but if a Horse, or
Great Cattle, our Rules are from the 12th h. if small Cattle, as Sheep, Hogs,
or Dogs, from the 6th House. Observe, the Lot that is projected, or the 7th
House, is the Theft: And if you find the 7th Lot and the first in company, the
things will soon be returned to the Owner, chiefly when good Aspects.

But if the contrary, beheld by or, or go into the place not beholden, the
Thief has no desire to return back the Goods.

If the 7th Lot go into the 3d or 9th House, the Fugitive is gone a Journey,
or tells you, it is one that lives a great distance from the Querent.

If the 7th Lot falls into the 12th, the Theft is a Prisoner, or under
confinement for his Roguery; if or there, the same.

If the second Lot be found in another House, the things stolen are sold, or
converted into Money.

If the 6th or 12th moves into the 9th or 10th House, the Beast lost or strayed
is in the Pound.

If the 7th, 6th or 12th House have good Lotts, and or there; and also in the
second House, if be well fortified; great hopes of Recovery of the Goods stolen
or strayed.

If you desire to know what way they are gone, mind your Compass, and say, if
the Significator of the Theft is in the 10th, South; 7th, West; in the 4th,
North; in the First, East. If in Watery, North, in some moisty place; if in
Airy, West, in some Mountain; if in Earthy, South, in Deserts or Woods; if in
Fiery, East, in open places where Plowing is.

Recovery, if these places, as 7th, 6th, 12th Houses have good Lotts, and
beholden by or.

No hopes, if the contrary, as ill Lotts, and beholden by.

If you would know the Thief, and of what Age and Sex. We do always mark well
the Lot in the 7th House; if we find or Female Lotts, it is a Womankind; if
the contrary, Mankind. If the Lotts are governed by, Old; by, Young; by, very
Young; by and, middle Aged.

More Thieves than one; if the Second House is afflicted with many Lotts, many
Thieves; if the 7th House is be held by, from double-bodied Lotts, signifies
many Thieves. If the 7th go to the 8th, and first and 2d does not agree, and
or, and not beholden by good Aspects, no hopes, but loss.

If you are willing to know, if it be one of the house, or a Stranger, that
stole thy Goods: Consider, if the Significator of the Thief be moved into the
third House, it is a Brother or Relation; or if the 4th House, some of the
Household; but in a general way, a Traveller or Stranger; if in the 5th, thy
Children; in the 6th, a Servant: and so of the rest in order.

Of the time of Recovery. Go to the Table, and that will show you, if it be
Years, Months or Days.

The place where the things stolen are hid; it is taken from the Nature of the
Lot of it 4th House.

Eighth House.
De Morte. The House of Death, or the House of Substance of thy Wife.
CVm de Morte, ejusque genere quaeritur; detur prima Quaerenti, ejusquae vitae;
octava mor^^, ejusque generi; bona enim ibi Figura, bonam and laudabilem; mala,
malam indicat mortem, consentientibus tamen Angulis, Testibus and Judice.
Examina proinde exact naturam Figurarum essentialem, etc.

Quae supra.

Concerning Death: We are to be diligent searchers into the first and 8th
House; if we find these two Points to be free from, or ill Company, and to be
accommodated with, and good Figures or Lotts, then the Querent may live a
considerable time; but if you find it to the contrary, you may say, the
Querent's Life is short.

If you desire to know the time of Death, observe, if you find ill Lotts in the
first and 8th, beheld by ill Aspects to one another; then you are to see, if
those Lotts be Fixed, Common, or Moveable, then judge according to the former
Rules.

The manner and nature of Death, is taken from the Nature of the Lot raised in
the 8th House, and also Planets beholding it; if Fiery, Airy, Watery, or Earthy
Lotts in the first or 8th House, judge according to the four Elements as
aforementioned.

or gives a gentle, moderate and mild Death to the Querent.

by Drowning, Agues, Dropsies, or cold Distempers, etc.

by the Sword or Murdering, Fevers, Choler, etc.

by some Obstructions of the inward Parts, as the Heart, etc. by Faintness and
Feebleness.

by Frenzy, Madness, Giddiness, Lethargies, etc.

by Drowning, danger of cold Humors, or by much Travel, decay of the inward
Parts.

Mind always, that the 7 Properties are Rulers over particular Lotts, as your
Table directs you.

When you Marry a Wife, or a Husband, it is good to know, if the Fortune or
Portion is to be recovered, or if great or small: Look on the 7th House for thy
Wife or Husband, and the 8th House, for the Substance or Money; and if you find
good Lotts or Planets there, and, good Aspects and Company, hope well; if to
the contrary, ill., trouble, if not loss.

The Ninth House.
De Itineribus; an Iter sit faciendum?
THis Point of the Compass, gives you to understand, of your moving, going, or
long Journies by Sea and Land; Sciences, Arts, or Churchmen.

If one shall have his Desire; behold the 9th h. and if you find an ill Lot
there, of the nature of, or, or, or their Lotts, the Querent must have a great
care of Voyages or long Journies, for he will meet with Mischief by the way;
the same, if.

But if you find the 9th House free, and a good Lot, with good Company, and
Aspected with good Planets, tell the Querent, that he will have pure Success
and Gain, be they Journies, or Sea-Voyages. If the first goes into the 10th,
and being sent to the 9th, the Querent may hope well, for he will meet with
Riches by the way.

But if you find the first Lot move, or go into an ill place, or in a place
which is in or to the 9th House, you may tell the Querent, that he will be in
an ill posture before he goes home.

Will the Voyages be long or short? If thou find Lotts in the 9th House
fixed, say, a long time before return; if common Lotts, a middle time; if
movable Lotts, soon return.

Good for Voyages and Speed, Acquisitio. Caput Draconis. Fortuna Major. Fortuna
Minor. Laetitia.


Good by Land, Laetitia. Albus. Conjunctio. Via.


Good by Water, Populus. Puella. Laetitia. Albus. Acquisitio.


Ill for the Way, Carcer. Tristitia. Populus. Cauda Dracouis.


Robbed by the Way, Cauda Draconis. Rubeus. Amissio.


Quest. Shall the Querent be enriched by his Science or Art which he loves?

Answ. The first House is for the Querent, and the 9th House for the thing
enquired for: Learn your Rules well and perfectly, and you will find, that this
Querent may be answered with ease^ the first and 9th is well fortified with
good Lotts, and beheld by good Aspects, and free from the malice of,, and
Dragons Tail, you may well judge, that the Party will obtain in his Art or
Science, with perfect Gain and Honor: But if thou find to the contrary, let
thy Opinion be changed, and judge according to the Power of the Lotts, more or
less, etc.

Reader, behold one Example: The Figure in the first House. A High German came
to me, desiring me to project a Figure of Lotts, to know if he should obtain
his Desire: Now pray consider, that retr. in in the Ascendant, called Amissio,
and in English, it is Loss, a bad ^ott: You may well think, that his Fancy
rored, on strange Whimsles, mighty desirous to search for the Devil, and have
familiarity with Spirits; but upon some Persuasions, he was soon weary of that
Resolution; and the sooner, because in his 9th House, is a good Lot, called
fortuna Major, Great Fortune. I shall say no more of this Matter or Figure, but
leave it to your View.

Quest. Shall the Person, or Minister obtain the Benefice desired?

Answ. Now you must know, that Parsons are as subject to the Impression of the
Elements, as we are, and Sinners too, though they keep it private under the
String of their Black Coat: The judgment of this Question, is from the first
and 9th; and if you find, Rubeus or Carcer in the 9th House, the Querent is not
fit for a Teacher, nor Parish-Clerk neither; for they trouble Religion no more,
than my Lord Mayor's great Horse.

If the 9th House is free from evil, the person may have a Bishopric, or the
Place desired: but if,,, ill Lotts and Aspects, judge the contrary.

De Somnio, an verum aut falsum sit?

Detur prima Somnianti, nona Somnio; tertia, sexta, undecima, quindecima rei
petitae: Figur^ Masculin^ veritatem, Foemininae falsitatem indicant.

De Beneficio.

Si Prima and Nona sint fortunatae, bonam indicant fortunam in Ecolesiasticis;
eoque magis, s^ Prima transeat in Decimamquintam, sitque fortunata Sexta, and e
contra.

To many Persons, Dreams are of great Truth and Consequence, and generally
true, when you find a Fixed Lot in the 9th h. The Scripture speaks largely of
Dreams; Joseph was a Dreamer.

A Dream is wonderful, if you consider we^ my great Figure, which contains 24
Houses, be* ing my Angelical Figure, wherein I foretol^ the Event of things to
come, as you may rea^ at large.

If you will interpret Dreams, consider the nature of the Lotts, and the 7
Properties of Nature; the Lotts of and cause desperate, dreadful and melancholy
Dreams: and, pleasant and delightful;, Gold;, Water;, Flying, etc.

The Tenth House.
By this Tenth House, you may inform your selves, when the Times will Change.

De Temporis varia Mutatione.
ELementum magis abundans in Quaestione, in prima maxim and decima Domo,
Temporis qualitatem designabit. Ignis enim Serenitatem; Aer ventum and
serenitatem; Aqua Aeris corruptionem and Bestiarum; Terra frigiditatem and
siccitatem-Vide si in prima, decima, and undecima sint Figurae Aqueae; ips^
enim Pluvias, and Terrae sicci^^tem presagiunt, etc.

retr. vel Tristitia, tamen naturaliter Pluviam prognosticat; Unae protemporis
progno^icatione and mutatione considerantur prima and ^uarta, quindecima and
quartadecima; quae si sunt aqueae, aut magna saltem ex part, pluvias in^icant.

Mediocres pluvias, indicant Aeris ariditatem ^neae, terreae srigidam
siccitatem: Si inter filias, sint igneae; and inter neptes, aqueae;
decimaquinta consentiente, siccitate initio humiditate exceptam, and e contra,
significat. Si ibi sint Aqueae, Decimquinta consentiente, pluviosum Annum.
Aeriae, ex quibus plen. in, Via, Populus nascatur, Diluvia and Inundationes.

But in short, you must in this Concern, know the nature of these Lotts; for
watery Lotts give Pluvia, or Rain; Fiery Lotts give Heat and Dryness; Airy,
Ventus, or Wind; and so of the rest in order: But the main point, is to
consider the Time and Occasion of the Year. But my Reader cares not for those
Matters, but altogether for to know of Himself, whether he shall live
Honorably, or have Society with King's and Princes, or whether he shall come
to be a Housekeeper or a Master, or what thing to take in hand, to get most
Money: These are the things desired in this Elementary Life.

Now I tell thee, that the 10th House, or the Lot in it, is the Significator
of those things viz. Honor and Dignity; if the first Figure or Lot be joined
to the 10th, viz. Company, or by or Aspect, the Querent will assuredly step up
to the Seat of Honor; if the first moves into the 10th h. and not afflicted,
the same; if you find good Figures in the 10th h. hope well, for thy Office or
Place desired.

But if ill Lotts in the 10th h. and ill Company^ and or, very small hopes for
thee to kis^ the King's Hand, or reap any Benefit from him or from those above
thy Quality.

Now if you are willing to know, what Trade or Profession to take in hand; you
must consider well the Rulers of thy Lotts on the 10th h. of what Triplicity
they are, whether Fire, Air, Earth or Water; if Fire, a Trade of a hot nature;
if Water, thou shall gain by the Sea or Water, or by Wine, Ale or Beer, etc.

But a word or two in general: The Lot Tristitia and Carcer are the Lotts of,
as the former Table directs.

If Ruler of the 10th h. and if thy Birth sprung from a low Descent, give thy
mind to Dig in the Ground for Money, Husbandry or Gardning, or Tillage of the
Earth, etc. But if thou descend from high Birth, thou may be a Judge, and
gain Money by sleeping or waking, and come to a degree of great Power.

signifies dealing in Cloth; and pulling off the Wool of Sheeps back by night,
if is ill or retrograde; otherwise, a good Shopkeeper, and will come be a
Churchwarden of a Troop of Horse.

Ruler of the 10th h. and retrograde, a Baker will be thy best Trade; but if is
strong and powerful, take thy Sword by thy side, and strive to be a Captain.

, Some hot Trade, as a Goldsmith, or the like.

Be sure to employ thy self about Women's Concerns; but for Whoring (...) give
you no Directions.

Often turns himself, in Money, Shapes and many Minds; but whatever Planets he
is joined to, it gives a strong inclination to Arts and Sciences, to the Law,
Divines, Physicians, Clerks, Money-Scriveners; all those things, if well
Dignified: but if ill, then idle, prating, lying Knaves, and lives by Stealing,
Lying and Dissembling.

, The Moon Lady of the 10th h. you may expect Honor by Women; and by Travel
from Foreign Parts, great Gain by Sea; or any Trade that requires moving to
place, and from place.

Also signifies Silver, etc.

These Rules in a general way, are very true.

If you are willing to consider your selves, about Kings, Princes, or
Noblemen, behold the 10th h. if the Lotts therein be good, and also the Lot
in the Ascendant, and in good Aspects and Company, you may well say, that the
King and his Subjects will agree like Lambs; the People will rejoice under
their Government. And as for plenty of Money, behold the 2d and 11th house; if
well Dignified, Trading and Money will be plenty.

But for your further Knowledge concerning Peace or War, behold what Lotts are
in the 7th house, and behold the 10th Lot by a or 8; say then, it will be in
those Countries, Cities or Towns which those Lotts govern: So, if you find the
Lot that belongs to France, in a or 8, say then, there will be Discoveries
between our King and the French; if Holland or Spain, according to your Lotts;
if good Aspects, Peace; if ill, War.

The Eleventh House.
An Servi and Amici sint Fideles?
THis Point of the Heavens, shows you, what Friends you have; your way now is,
to look on the first and 11th House, and see how they agree together, in Love,
Peace and Unity, viz. in good Company, Aspects, and good Lotts.

This is sufficient enough for the Querent to be satisfied, that he may have
the things hoped for, and to rely on them as faithful Friends in time of need;
if you want an Examination, turn your Eyes to the Figure erected by the
Angelical Hand; for the Gentleman is prosecuted by his Servant: There you will
find by the 11th House, he had good Friends to stand by him in time of Trouble,
etc. But to the contrary, if thou find the first and 11th House to disagree,
and different of nature, and in ill Company and Aspects, then thy Friends may
be thy Foes; for now in our Days, it is a Question very frequent; Will my
pretended Friends be faithful? These Rules or Lotts of mine will soon make
distinction; if you find the Lotts of or in this House, or, then trust not thy
Friends, for they will bring thee to a Snare, and Ill Will will be the end.

If thou find thy Lot in a medium, trust not thy Friends too far; if thou
find, in this House, thy Friends are very faithful, and whatever thou say
or do, is as safe as in thy own Breast.

The 11th House tells thee of the Substance of thy King.

The Twelfth House.
De Carcere; and an aliquis incarcerabitur.
THis 12th House is relating to Compters and Imprisonment; and in this we have
generally an Eye to the first House: If we find a good Lot, and free from Evil
there, then we may say, the Querent is strong and powerful, and soon out of
Prison; but if weak and ill, the contrary: if it goes into the third House or
9th, he will be soon released.

If the Lot of the first House, moves or go into the 4th, 8th or 12th Houses,
there is but little hopes of Delivery out of Prison, or from Confinement; and
the longer confined, if there is a or 8 between the first and 12th; if your
Lotts are fixed in the first House, a long Imprisonment; if common, a medium;
if moveable, soon delivered out of Prison If in a Cadent House, long Afflicted;
mind the Hour the Prisoner was confined; if the Lot was ill, that rules the
hour, a long Captivity; and is plagued with the Presence of or, or their
Aspects, cold Walls still.

Now for thy Delivery: Observe, if you find good Lotts or their Rulers, with
Part of Fortune, and good Aspects of and, then there is great hopes of
Recovery, or Delivery from confinement of a Prison.

I have given you an Example of this in my Angelical Figure; Via in the 12th h.
a speedy Delivery.

Quest. Has the Querent any present Enemies?

Answ. Still mind, if you find the 12th House with ill Lotts, and or 8, and the
worse, if if from ill Houses: And I have before shown, that Moderation or
Mollification is to be understood by the good Company of, to cool the violent
Spirits. As for an Example; if or are in ill or Cadent Houses, their luster of
Glory will not shine so bright, as in good Houses; so likewise the malice, or
ill Beams of, are something eclipsed, being placed in a good House: so be not
rash in your Judgment, but be ruled by Reason.

We have found by many Trials, that if be in the 11th House, which is that
which we call Company, let thy Friends pretend to never so much Honesty, they
will be false to thee.

If the Querent comes to thee about a Horse, or great Cattle; take the same
Rules by this 12th House, as you are taught by the 6th House.

If the Querent desires to know the Shape of Body, and Disposition of his
Enemies or Friends, (it is all one,) turn to my Table of Shapes of Body, and you
will have your desire, with a little varying your Judgment, according to Reason.

If the Querent desires to know, the very exact time of coming to his Friends,
or meeting with his Enemies, search (for your Direction) into the Numbers which
your Lot gives you, in this Book.

The End of the Third Book.
Experimental Knowledge, OF THE Life of Man; Governed by the Heavens Above, in
all Actions and Transactions. BOOK IV.
CHAP. I.
The First Experiment; interpreting of Somnium, or a Dream, for a certain
Person of great Note and Reputation.

I Told this Gentleman exactly what would befall him in a Months time, or
thereabouts.

This Gentleman came to me in a distracted Condition, saying, Tuli multa mala
in Vita mea* I have had (says he) much Trouble, and have suffered much Wrong in
my lifetime, and am fearful of much more to come: for a considerable time
together, I have dreamed wonderfully of Distraction and Consuming. But the last
night I had a terrible Dream indeed, of such a Bloody Nature, that I am besides
my self, or quite distracted, in consideration of what may become of me: my
Spirits are cast down, and overwhelmed with Grief.

I looked sharply on him, perceiving him to be disturbed in his Spirits, and
thinking some ill had happened to him; and to abate something of his Fury, I said
thus, Homo natus Muliere brevis est aetatis; satur commotione: ut Flos egressus
est, and succiditur; and fugit velut umbra; neque consistit.

This Gentleman replied, I know that a Man born of a Woman, is full of Misery,
and his time short, etc. I have much Dissatisfaction within my self, by reason
of a terrible Vision in my Sleep, or a Dream, (which you please,) insomuch that
it puts me a thinking, what may happen to me; for this Vision appearing so
dreadful before my Eyes, makes me fear, is a token of some Judgment which the
great (...) awakens me withal; to consider my latter End, or some great Work to
pass through.

Further, says the Querent, or the Gentleman, I am now come to you, hearing of
your Angelical Art by way of Lotts, or Angelical Enquiry, to make a Discovery,
or to give me a little insight of the meaning of this dreadful Vision: pray
give me the best of your Opinion.

Resp. I believe that this Vision or frightful ^ream of yours, is a sign of
some great Alterati^^ in matters of your Body or Estate. Dreams ^e of great
consequence; for our Savior Christ ^as carried into Egypt, by reason of a
Dream. ^^seph by a Dream, told his Brethren, That they should Worship, and fall
down, and give Obe^^ience to him. I shall not in this place trouble by Reader
with the Scripture, but follow my ^resent Task.

SIR, I will do to the uttermost for you in ^his my Angelical Enquiry, which
are the Rules that I have followed these many Years, and find ^^em true in most
things. So that I will not ^sk you, kind Sir, what the Vision was, or the
Nature thereof, for I will endeavor to find it ^ut my self, and give you an
Answer two days ^^ence. Kind Reader, this is of great moment, and worth
Observation, and will open to you ^he Secrets of Nature, or hidden Mysteries.

In the first place, I entered into my Close^, de^ring the Powers of Heaven and
good Angels* ^^^ide my Hand, putting all things else out of my ^ind, and Raised
my Lotts, as you may see in ^^g. 115. cap. 4. where you are plainly (...) (...)
^he manner and ways of making the 16 Lott^.

Now follows the whole Work in this Form.



Now for your further understanding, I will place it in an Astrological Form,
as I have shown you in the Table, page 110. in Signs and Planets that those of
a slender Apprehension may know that this Work is not Conjuration: but the
Lotts, Planets and Signs, are united into one Body.

As for Example, Acquisitio is in the First ^ouse turned into dir. in, as you
may see (...) this Figure following.



Because we will be very curious in this great Work of Enquiry, after the State
and Condition ^f Man's Elementary Life, and to satisfy the Curiosity of the
Reader, we will place before your ^yes a Figure of this Angelical Work; and
also ^he Astrological Work together, or in one Figure, containing 24 Parts.

Behold the Figure of this Angeli call Work.
Sortitium in singulis.
In this Form you have 24 Houses, so called; in 12 of the outwardmost are
placed the 1^ Angelical Lotts, with the nature of them, represented by the
Astrological Signs and Planet The two Witnesses are of our Angelical Work and
also the Judge: the Houses of the 12 Lott^ are marked out by common Figures, as
1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, to 12.

The next 12 Houses are of Astrology, which I erected at this Querent's coming
to me with that horrible Noise, being willing to try both ways. The time of
this Astrological Figure was Jan. 30. 1696/7. at 10 of the Clock in the
Morning: And for distinction sake, I have pointed the Astrological Figures, as
the Lotts by 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on to 12, as you may see at the top of the
Houses; but they of the Lotts are at the bottom. The inner Circle tells you
that every House is divided into 30 degrees, and by the Round under the Black
Line, is represented to your View, the Globe of the World.

Now Christian Reader, this is the Method o^ Rule from whence I draw all my
Judgment and have now here demonstrated it to you i^ very plain English,
because it has been in Darkness a long time; for I believe the Reader here^ A
Philosophical Figure. deduced by an Angelical Hand Astrologically
was never acquainted with Rosie-Crucians; they ^re a People which have
delivered many Arts ^d Liberal Sciences to the World. These Men ^ay be compared
to the Wise Men of the East, (...) their beholding the Stars, they found out
^here our Savior lay, etc. And it may be you ^ver knew the Hebrews, Chaldeans,
Indians; ^eir Writings and Language is different from ^rs.

CHAP. II.
The Misery threatening this our Querent; or, the Vision or Evil to come,
unfolded.

IN the first place, the main Point is to be drawn from the 9th House; but,
because it is of a ^rge Consequence, and the Querent's desire is (...) know in
full; therefore, First, I will enquire that this Gentleman is, from the first
House. Secondly, The 7th House for his open Enemies. Thirdly, The 12th House
for his private and se^ret Enemies. Fourthly, To the 9th House, to ^fold the
Vision: And Fifthly and Lastly, To ^d out what Company this Querent keeps.

Now of these five Particulars in order. The first House signifies the
Querent's Shape of Bo^y, and of his Will and Humor, as you may see in page
138, to 145; but to save you the labor (...) turning back to that place, I
will here repea^ them over again.

I find in the First or Ascendant, the Lot called Acquisitio, which is a good
Lot, and represents one of a middle Stature, fair and full Faced Meanly
Sanguine Complexion, full Eyed; a comely Person, of a good Behavior, something
Shame faced or Blushing, of a good and plausible Behavior.

And this is all very true, for I have been very familiar with him; and he is
also a Man of good Esteem in the World, in matter of Reputation.

Secondly, We will now search in the 7th House; there we find that Lot called
Populu^ or the in her Full in Capricorn, which is a Lot^ of a strange nature,
as you may in page 130^ which gives you a full Relation of it, viz. it be
speaks this Querent to have many Enemies, o^ a multitude of People gathered
together, or (...) pack of knavish Contrivers.

So I rest my self satisfied, that this Queren^ of ours has some treacherous
Persons designing ill against him.

But now we are to come to consider, how o^ by what means? or by whom?

I have already given you a Table of the Aspect^ and Unity of the Lotts, in the
following page. But now in this place, I will present you with a new one, very
easy to be comprehended; whereby to understand, from whence Affliction comes
whether it comes from Brothers, Sisters, Relations or Strangers; as is
generally taken from (...) 7th, 12 or 9th Houses, being Travelers; or from the
5th House, from some drinking, idle Person; or the 6th House, from some
Servant, or Person of low Degree.

The First House afflicted, generally the Persons themselves create Trouble to
themselves: from the Third House, Brethren; the Fourth, from the Father, or Old
People; the 10th, from the Mother, or Persons of Honor; if from the 11th
House, your former Friends, or your familiar Acquaintance.

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

Now if you are desirous to know the Unity and Place of the Lotts, by way of
Aspects or Situation, behold the Table: is the Example, throughout the 12 Signs
or Lotts.

See, or the Lot Acquisitio; he beholds the third House by a Aspect, a to the
Fourth House, a to the 5th, and a to the 7th (...) his to the 9th h. his to the
10th h. and his to the 11th h. So you have both Dexter and Sinister; and you
have the Second, 6th, 8th and 12th Houses, that behold not one the other.

We may very well discern by this, what Evil is pointed out against this
Querent of ours.

Observe the Lot that is in the 4th House, which is of an ill nature, casting
his ill Beams to the Ascendant; the Lot is called Carcer, in English, a
Prison, or a dismal Place; which is no way agreeing with the Lot in the
Ascendant: therefore I conclude, that this Gentleman and Old People cannot
agree; and besides that, there will be an Old Man which lies still in the
Grass, like a Snake, to do him a private Mischief; and the more certain,
because the 7th House is possessed with an ill Lot, as also the Lot in the
12th h. His secret Enemies, and his open Enemies, notorious by nature; we may
well conjecture, that there is a notorious Plot contriving against this Man,
arising from Enmity and Malice; and that he will be brought before Judges or
Justices of the Peace, or such sort of Persons.

If you do observe the Aspect from Carcer, the 10th h. from the 7th. h. in
taking Counsel from a sort of petty Fellows, having something to do under the
King. So here is good Reason for this Querent to fear, lest Treason b^
maliciously sworn against him.

Then again, another Inquiry may be made, viz. To know what Company this our
Querent had, or did keep; because it is a common Saying, and I believe it is
true, Bad or ill Company brings many to the Gallows: And in page 150. you have
the Rules, to know good or ill Company.

Now note, that the second h. is Company for the first.

As for Example, we have in the Ascendant, the Lot Acquisitio, a very good
Lot; and in the second h. his Company was Tristitia, viz. retr. in, signifies
a cursed Pack, not fit for the Society of Christians.

I conclude then, this was or would be, the Foundation and Ground of this Man's
Trouble; then finding this, I could not be quiet, before I had spoke with him,
to know the truth of the Matter: And then he told me plainly, That he had
formerly lodged in his House, PORNE, and Homo scelestus, about three years
past, and that he put them out of his House by violence.

Now it plainly appears, if you consider my former Rules, and also this my
present Judgment, that those are the Ground from whence springs this Wickedness
against this our Querent; for behold, is Lord over the Lot in his second h.
which is his bad Company, thinking to gain Money, because of the second h.
Behold again, is Lord or Ruler over the Lot of the 4th h. too; they would
willingly handle some of our Querent's unmovable Goods And more than all this,
observe, is also Rul^r over the 5th h. (...) our Querent; they do not produce
the Ma^i^e from his turning out of out of Doors, but pretend to have a spleen
against him, by reason of his similiarity with a Feminine Creature of their
Acquaintance; and this is very true.

But if you would know the bodily Shape, State and Condi^ion of these
Caballers, turn back to page 138. and you may be satisfied at large.

Then here is another thing to be observed, When, or at what time will this Ill
happen to this our Querent, seeing it is so, that it will be?

Why truly, the Caldeans, Egyptians and Rosie-Gru^ians, and others, has
encouraged me in this Work, finding them true, to number out Times and Seasons;
and they have given us those Lotts, in poiuting out some for Years, some for
Months, some for Days, and some for Hours, viz. the fixed for Years, the common
for Months, and moveable for Days and Hours, as is already shown you.

Now some observe for Weeks, the Lot Cauda Draconis; for Days, the Lot
Conjunct^o; and for Hours, the Lot Amissio.

So I considered my Rules, and found, that this Trouble would fall on this Man
in about a Months time; and so it was, a Month and three Days after the Vision
or Dream; and at that time the two forementioned Persons went to a Justice of
the Peace, and swore this* Q^erent of ours had robbed Money, and that he kept
company with Clippers and Coiners: so his House was searched, and they found
nothing; but he was apprehended, and carried before such Persons as
beforementioned, and was there Examined: And as for his Freedom or
Deliverance, you shall have it at large in the next Chapter.

But Reader, this is no new thing now in our Days; for it is very frequent, that
such Persons of a double dye in Knavery, for a revenge to gratify their own
Will, to make nothing to ^wear Treason against a Man, fallly and maliciously.

But in this particular, I will open to you the Way and Method, to know the
Nature of a Dream or Vision, or the word Somnium; it is no more, but an
Observation drawn from the 9th h. which is the House of our Querent's Spiritual
Guide, which did reveal to him this Trouble, Shame and Disgrace, a Month before
it came.

Now we will take a view of our great Work, and we may find, that on the 9th
House, is that Lot called Rubeus; which is of a bloody, and harsh nature,
insomuch that our former Philosophers said, If that Figure Rubeus arises in
your Figure, let it be (say they) depopulated, or destroyed. Now I am of the
contrary opinion; for as long as we live under the Elements, we must expect
ill, as well as good.

The Astrologers do not destroy their Figures, when they find the in the
Ascendant, or elsewhere; for they observe some Knavery forth coming thereby, to
themselves, or to the Q^nt.

Neither do I advise you, when you find the Lot Rubeus, or ill Lotts, to cast
it aside; but observe the Nature and Qualities thereof.

As for Example, Rubeus is in the 9th; turn back to the main Rule, viz. to the
Lotts in the 9th h. and you will find what that Lot Rubeus is; what it
signifies in the 12th House: in every House, he differs something. But in the
main, it is a Lot of a destructive Nature, and of a Watery Triplicity; but many
Writers compare it to both Fire and Water, upon extremes, having no mercy.

And very like unto this Nature, was the Vision of our Querent, viz. Burning
and Consuming by Fire or Water, or both, in a most frightful and terrible
manner.

And this is my Opinion and Judgment, on the Vision of this Gentleman.

Now I went to him, and laid down this my Judgment concerning the Vision; and
he told me, it was very true: for Fire and Water, with Destruction, was the
groundwork of his frightful Dream.

Then I desired this our Querent, to reveal to me the whole Matter.

The VISION opened.
Nuperrime factum est, cum quidam Homo alterum velut ab utero materno nudum
humi procumbentem supino more vidisset, cujus venture magno vulnere consossus
est; and qui alta voce cum advocavit ut ei istud vulnus sanaret; Somniator
noster, se prompte effecisse arbitrabatur, cum sauciatus iste sese in faciem ex
improviso convertens, vulnus a tergo long horribiliorem in lucem protulit;
quod carnem ejus usque adeo torsit, ut brevi in cinerem redigi, nec non in
viscera ejus descendere videbatur: quo aspectu, ad tempus obmut uit: Animum
autem tandem revocans, interrogavit eum, number adhuc inter vivos esset? and cum
pro responso habuit, se it a isse; subito inclamavit, ut aquam ei adferent, ad
inflamatum ejus corpus extinguendum; quocum statim expergefecit.

God often does by Dreams, to us declare
Strange Accidents, before they do appear:
By a Dream, showed Joseph what should fall
To him, his Parents, and his Brethren all:
By Dreams likewise, did Pharaoh understand,
There would be seven years Famine in the Land;
His Butlers Dream showed, Pharaoh would restore
Him to his Place, that he had lost before.
The Baker's Dream also did signify,
That in three days he should be Hanged high.
The Soldiers to Gideon, did foreshow,
That he the Midianites should overthrow.
More may be said of Dreams and their Events,
And how they show our Good, or Discontents;
But this, I hope, at present may suffice,
Since a Word may be enough, to the Wise.
CHAP. III.
A Brief Account of the Delivery, Friendship, and Support of this Querent,
under so great a Scandal and Disgrace; drawn from this Angelical Work of Ours.

1. IN the first place, observe, that we have here two Witnesses and one Judge;
and first, we will speak of the two Witnesses: the Right Witness is called
Laetitia, a Lot, in English, signifying Joy and Gladness. Now this Right
Witness is always taken for the Querent, and signifies his Concern, either good
or ill; and to be more larger, it has also an inspection into all the Houses,
on that side; that is to say, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10; it discovers what the Motion of
the Querent is, before propounded. And this I must tell you, is a good
Testimony of the Gentleman's Integrity and Honesty.

And in this I am more plain, because I would instruct young Students.

Secondly, As for the Left Witness, it bears Testimony, of the Mind and
Intention of your Enemies, and as a Landscape of the other Heuses in that side,
etc.

The Lot, which is the Left Witness, is called Rubeus, a Lot of a desperate
bloody-minde^ Nature, which very patly represents the horrid Treason sworn by
PORNE, and Homo scelestus, and with the Lot Populus in the 7th House; these
together, give you a plain Discovery of the forementioned Knavery, as if you
had it printed before your Eyes.

Thirdly, Another Testimony of our Querent's speedy Delivery, is, by that Lot
which we call the Judge, viz. retr. in. Observe here, Rules of truth, taken
from the Caldeans and the Rosie-Crucian-men; When the Judge moves himself into
the ^oth h. of the Quer^nt, it is an absolute Testimony, that the Judge of the
Law will do Justice. This happens to our Querent; if you look back to our great
Work, you will plainly see it: and the Judge freed this our Prisoner, and the
Clerks also of the Law, cried out shame on this PORNE, and Homo scelestus; and
said, they ought to be hanged.

Fourthly, It Is a strong Argument of Recovery, from the Lot in the Ascendant,
which is called, dir. in; you have its Description at large, in page 151.
signifying a Man of Power, and one that lives in Pomp and Credit in the World;
and such a one generally crusheth the Power and Malice of poor inconsiderable
Earthworms, that show their Teeth, and are not able to bite: so you have often
heard, that Populus signifies many Enemies. It Is a common Saying, that when a
Man lives well, and gets Money, he is generally hated by some, because they
think he lives above them.

Fifthly, Now the reason of Redemption, is, because, if you mind the great
Work, you will find, the Lot in the Ascendant moves it self into the third
House; a true token or testimony, of this Querent to have many true and
faithful Friends, or Neighbors we may call them: and as now I say, so it was;
for he had many of the best of the Parish in which he lived; the Churchwarden
for one, to be Surety or Security for him, on occasion.

Then behold the Table of Aspects, and you will find an Aspect of Love, between
the Lot in the Ascendant, and the third house, which strengthens the foresaid
Arguments.

Then again, Sixthly, you will find Friends, from the 11th house; First,
Because the Lot there is dir. in, a pure good Lot, of Truth and Stability;
and this is the more verified, because there are Aspects of Love between the
Lot of the Ascendant and the 11th house, the house of Friendship: and this
Gentleman informed me, that he had, at that time of Trouble, two Eminent
Doctors of Physic came willingly and freely, proffering their Service to him;
they were both of great Eminence and Renown: their Description of Body and
Disposition, is exactly represented, according to our former Rules.

Seventhly, If you desire to know, if the Querent was long in Custody, or in
Prison, look into the 12th h. the house of Imprisonment, and you will find,
that the Lot called Via, signifies the Way, and is a sure Testimony; pray turn
back to Via in the 12th house: it positively says, a speedy delivery out of
Prison; and so it was to admiration, (says the Querent) considering the nature
of the thing.

Reader, the truth of this our Angelical Method, or by way of Lotts, ought to
be much esteemed by the Lovers of Art; for my Experiments in this, have been
very large.

Eighthly, and Lastly, The death of our Querent's secret Enemies, Homo
scelestus died in the Bosom of PORNE, our Enemy: and no wonder, if you
consider, that the 8th h. of the Querent, the Counsel or Company to the
Querent's Enemies, is moved into the 12th h. of secret Enemies, and is called
Via, and is in to his 8th, a terrible Lot, viz. retr. in, called Tristitia;
and this in one Month from the Vision: and PORNE submitted her self to the
mercy of the Querent.

CHAP. IV.
The several Ways, that God gives us Rules, to foresee our Elementary Life:
with an Account of this Our Querent's Friends.

NOW behold the great Work, and you will find, the Figure of Astrology is
placed in the inner 12 Houses, which was Erected at the very instant of this
our Querent's first apprehending, being Jan. 30. at 10 in the Forenoon; at that
time, this Gentleman was seized on by a parcel of Egyptian Caterpillars; but
considering what they were, they were, indifferent civil.

It Is a common Rule for the Astrologers, to behold the Ascendant first; and if
you do, you will find there the Tail of the Dragon, which bespeaks such a
parcel of Fellows, etc. Now ascends the Horoscope, and the was in to to Venus,
ad, and, and, etc.

Then Secondly, We are to consider the 7th House; and there we find the Sign,
which very well resembles the Lot Populus, as I have before spoken of: for the
7th house is our Querent's open Enemies, and the 12th h. is his private ones:
So we may plainly see, that the Planet is Lord of the 7th. h. posited in the
12th house; a plain Testimony, that our Querent has malicious and bitter
enemies to deal with; and the more, because is in the 12th House also, which
signifies a malicious, lying, prating Tongue; for naturally signifies Liars,
Dissemblers, and forsworn, perjured Persons, in the Sign, because he is in to
his own House: the Querent has good reason to fear envious Fools, forsworn
Persons, thinking to get Money.

Thirdly, We must now begin to take notice of the of, Lady of the Ascendant to
the, lays down the same reason as the Lotts did; the main Instrument was
Porne, and in the 4th h. some old Knaves of the Acquaintance of the Querent's
spur her on in the Wickedness; and the more, if you take notice of her 11th h.
being the House of Advice; and not only so, but retr. in the 6th h. The
Description of this PORNE, is one of an indifferent high and long Neck, a
cloudy Complexion, a dark Hair, something Melancholy, Pensive, apt to Cry or
Weep, and much given to Drowsiness, Heavy-headedness, yet something covetous,
or saving of Money, performing no good Action.

Fourthly, We plainly see the Death and Destruction of our Querent's secret
Enemies, if we observe the Rulers of Nature, viz. to take notice of the 12th
House. Now we find in the 12th h. or Lord of the 12th, of the Enemies, in his
Ascendant; and not only so, but retr. in, and the too; a positive Sign of the
destruction of Homo scelestus; and indeed, he died in the Bosom of PORNE: And
according to the best Information I had, he was destroyed by the Disease caused
by the Planet. The time of the Death of Homo scelestus, was about five Weeks
after our Querent's Vision.

Fifthly, A word or two concerning our Querent's Friends, who would have
Assisted him. They are exactly represented by, and the, in the 11th House,
which bespeak Men of a middle Stature, full and plump; and so they were, and
Persons of good Quality and Reputation.

Sixthly, Another Observation we have taken for his Delivery, is the to a Trine
of, and and to a. Now to demonstrate this to you, observe thus, that is Lord of
our Querent's 10th House, in to, Lady of the Ascendant; a pure Truth: the Judge
was his Friend, and many more; perceiving it was a piece of Villainy, to get
Money. And lastly, you may perceive by the Rules of Astrology, that PORNE
submitted to the mercy of the Querent.

The Rules of Astrology might have been more enlarged here in this Concern, but
I will leave it to the Wise.

CHAP. V.
Another Example of Treachery and Villainy; with many more Experiences on
several Occasions: drawn from this Angelical Work of Ours.

I Shall not trouble my self here, to give you the whole Figure of the Lotts;
but tell you, that Via was raised in the Ascendant, and that bloody Lot Rubeus
was raised in the 7th House; a Lot which I have often told you, causes many
Enemies, of very ill Life and Conversation, unsettled in their Wills and Minds.

The Story runs thus: The Querent having ^oney due to him a considerable time,
and no ^opes of it without trouble, he Sued him in the Court of Conscience, and
got his Money.

Now mark what follows: This Debtor of the Querent's had a Wife, and a Daughter
about the age of 30, or upwards; so for Revenge, these two consulted together
to swear, that this ^an that prosecuted her Husband, stole a partel of Silk
from a certain Merchant; insomuch ^ut this Querent was taken up, and carried
before the Lord Mayor of London: and upon Examination, the Mother and Daughter
(in not having a good Memory, as Liars ought to have) betrayed themselves in
telling their Stories, and were punished, according to their Deserts.

The Gentleman proved himself to live in one place as a Shopkeeper for 15
years, and many friends to testify of his Truth and Fidelity.

Now this Querent came to me with a very heavy Heart, fearing his utter Ruin:
but I bade him not fear, for it would come to nothing. I being something
intimate with him, he told me, he was for some time in Oxford; and I found him
to be ingenious in many things: He knew something of Astrology, and said, that
he had the in his Ascendant; which many may believe, or think, that he was a
Man of a tardy Conversation; but he was not, for I made enquiry; so I told him:
and it is my Opinion, that though a Man may have the Dragons Tail in his
Ascendant, it does not infuse Knavery into the Native, but stores up many
false, base and treacherous Enemies, against his Body and Purse.

Secondly, A certain Gentleman came to me, desiring me to Raise his Lotts for
him, to know if he should speak with his Common Dealer, (if he went to his
House, being seven Miles;) he was willing to be certain before he went.

I followed my Method of my Angelical Work, and Acquisitio was raised in the
Ascendant, and moves it self into the 7th House, which is the House of
Dealing. I bade him go speedily, and he should see him, and speak with him; and
so he did.

Thirdly, A certain Woman came to me, desiring me to tell her where her Horse
was, for she could not find him: I raised my Lotts, and found the Lot of the
12th House, which signified the Horse; and finding this same Lot moved himself
into the 4th House of the Querent, I bade the Woman go home, for the Horse was
in her own Ground, in some Corner, or watery Ditch; for the Lot was of the
watery Triplicity. And accordingly the Woman went home, and found her Horse, as
I told her.

Fourthly, A Man of my Acquaintance, gave his Wife leave to go to Greenwich,
some distance from London; expecting her home at night, but she did not come;
insomuch that the Man cani^ to me the next day, desiring me to tell him wh^ was
become of his Wife; he was fearful le^ some ill had happened to him.

I examined her Lot, viz. in the 7th House and found it to be Amiss^^, and
moved it self to a of the 11th House, which is the 5th from the 7th. I told the
Man, that his Wife was making him a Cuckold, and that all that Night she lay
with a tall, black Man. The Man seemed to be angry with me; but in four days
time, he was well satisfied in the Matter, for his Wife gave him a damned
swinging Clap. In page 181. you will find, that Amissio in the 7th House
signifies a Whore; and being in to her 5th, you may well judge what she was
about, etc.

Fifthly, A certain Man came to me, very mournfully; for he had given his Wife
some sharp Words, upon which she went away from him, he knew not where.

I raised his Lotts, and guided my Eyes to the 7th House, and finding that Lot
was moved into the 9th House, viz. the third from the 7th. I desired this Man
to go to his Wives Sister, and there he should find his Wife: and he found it
very true.

Sixthly, A certain Woman came to me, telling me, that she had lost or missed
her Husband for two days; desiring me to tell her what was become of him.

I found that Via, the Lot in the Ascendant, was moved into the 12th House: I
said to the Woman, thy Husband is in Prison, but will soon be freed, and set at
liberty. She went speedily from me, to the Marshalsea in Southpark, and met her
Husband at the Prison Gate, coming out, being just released.

Seventhly, A Gentlewoman came to me, with a dreadful noise, to know if her
Husband would die, for he lay very ill. Women generally make a noise in such a
case, whether they love their Husbands or no. But in short, I Raised her Lotts,
and found a good Lot in the Ascendant, viz. Albus, and moved it it self into
the 10th h. I bade the Gentlewoman be contented; for in six hours, or in a
small time, her Husband will certainly Recover. And true it was; for this Rule
I have often Examined, and sound it never fail.

Eighthly, If the Question be to know, If the Sick Person shall Recover?

I go on in this manner: First, I find a good Lot in the Ascendant, as Albus;
I say, the Patient shall Recover: in the 2d. h. is Carcer, no good Habit of
Body; in the Third h. is Acquisitio, signifies a good Issue; the Fourth h. is
Populus, a long Sickness; the Fifth h. is Rubeus, tells you, that all things
the Patient takes, is obnoxious to the inward Parts; the Sixth h. is Albus,
shows the Disease it self, to be of Melancholy, and Oppression of the Heart;
the Seventh h. is Laetitia, and his Company is Cauda Draconis, the Elements of
Air and Fire, telling you the Party is dangerously ill, and signifies Death,
because of the 7th and 8th h. the Ninth house is Amissio, and is a plain
demonstration, that the Person, or Minister of the Parish, will have no Gain;
the 10th is Acquisitio, which gives hope of Life and Recovery, the 11th is
Conjunctio, and signifies, that his Friends believe his Disease is mortal, and
are out of hopes; and i^ Conjunctio be also in the 12th, it tells you plainly,
that his Enemies are in great hopes of his Death.

Ninthly, This is a true way of judging, if you observe the Lotts and their
Natures, and consider their Differences of Elements. And while it is fresh in
mind, I will give you a true Method of Judging the,,, and Aspects.

Now for a further Demonstration of the Aspects, worth your Observation.

An Example of the Aspect of Opposition, viz. the first beholds the 7th, which
is an ill Aspect, as well for the distance of the Place, as for the
contrariety; because the first is Oriental, and the seventh Occidental.

And the like is from the 4th to the 10th, not only by place, but the 4th h. is
Darkness, and the 10th h. is Light. Now here lies the Mystery: If you find a
good Lot in the first, and so in the 7th, and of one Nature, Planet, and
Element, the things demanded, will come to a good end; and the Place of is only
to signify, that Matters of Things between them, are strange, and
unacquainted: but Friendship will soon come, if you find Fortuna Major in the
first h. and in the 7th too, you may well conclude of Unity, Peace and
Tranquillity: but if contrary to the aforementioned, judge otherwise.

And in like manner, consider the Aspect, and also the and; altlio' those are
counted good in Astrology, yet in those Lotts we must consider the Nature,
Quality and Elements; and if we find a good and bad, by a Aspect, we may
conclude, that their Friendship appears outwardly by a flattering Tongue, but
Enmity lies at the Heart.

CHAP. VI.
Rules to know, what any Person comes to thee for, before he declares his
Business.

THis is of great moment, if you understand it aright, viz. to understand the
Minds of People.

The first Rule, how to know the Intent; is to see when the first House or Lot
goes into any of the other, and judge according to the Signification of the
Houses wherein he or she goes: if the Second h. Money, third h. Brethren, etc.

The second Rule, is to take all the uneven Points of all the 12 Lotts, and
give one to the first, and another to the second, and third; and so
consequently to the other, until that all the Points are bestowed; then if the
Points remain on the first h. it signifies thereby, that the Person has a
desire to know something of the Questions belonging to the first house: if it
rests on the second h. Money, or Moveable Goods, as you have been formerly
shown. So you may judge of all the other Houses, where the Points or Pricks
stay.

Not long since, I had a certain Midwife came to me; she asked me, What she was
come to me for? I desired her to sit down a while, and I should tell her. I
Raised my Lotts, and found, that Rubeus was in the Ascendant, and moved it self
into the seventh h. I presently told her, she was come to me about a wicked
Husband, having to do with more Women than he ought; and I considered the
Nature of the Lot Rubeus, and concluded within my self, that the Midwife was
as right as her Husband. But in short, she told me, that I hit right on the
matter; for her Husband was a very wicked Man, (said she) for he keeps Whores;
and I hear, he is Married again, says she; but I am quit of him, and have not
lived with him a long time; and I am Married again, and he is at Sea, but no
body knows it. I spoke a pertinent Word, and said, I had the knowledge of that
before.

Now her Question was to know of me, When her first Husband would die, and the
second come home from Sea.

Kind Reader, I will show you one Example more, as a new Method in Raising
these Our Angelical Lotts, and so shall conclude: For I protest to you, That I
have found more Truth in this Angelical Art, than in Astrology; and then again,
it is a Method far more easy, and pleasanter than Astrolygy.

Another Way of Raising these Angelical Lotts, Much on the Astrological Method.
THIS Method indeed, I have not followed, because I have found so much Truth in
the forementioned. But to satisfy the Curiosity of the Reader, I will lay down
the Rules.

Observe therefore, to make four unequal Lines, as is taught in my former
Lotts, by the Points casually set down; and to join together these Points: And
out of these Points which are not joined together, and which do remain in the
Head of the Lines, extract one Figure; and the Sign of the Zodiac that
answers to that Figure, put for the Ascendant.

An Example may be proper; if Acquisitio arise from the Head of those four
LInes, let be placed in the Ascendant: but if Laetitia, or the Lesser Fortune,
put in the Ascendant: if Puer, or Rubous, place: if Albus,: if Via,: if
Conjunctio, or the Drag. Head,: if Puella,: if Amissio or Tristitia,: if Drag
Tail,: if Populus,: if Fortuna Major, if Carcer, then put for the Ascendant. So
place them in order in their Houses, as in the first, in the second, in the
second h. as you see in the Figure following, not regarding the Witness or
Judge.

The same Method, if another Lot is Raised; put it in the Ascendant, and the
rest in order.



So, out of 16 Figures, you make use but of 12, which answers to the 12 Signs
of the Zodiac; and this may serve for your purpose.

And as for placing into those 12 Signs, the Seven Properties of Nature,
observe to make four Lines by course, for every Planet by Points, casually
pricking, or pricked down; and likewise for the Drag. Head, as you have done
for the Ascendant, and divide those Points by 12, and that which remains
above 12, or the 12 it self, if a greater number does not remain, retain; and
the Planet for which the Projection was made, place in that House of which the
superabounding number shall be; that is, if there remains 12, let the Planets
be placed in the 12th house; if ten, in the 10th; if one, in the first h. if
two, in the second h. and so of the rest: And you ought always to begin from
the, and afterward from the, then from and, and from, and.

But it is the advice of our Forefathers, not to make a Question in Rain,
Clouds, or a very Windy Season, or when thou art Angry; not but that you may
take your time for the same purpose again, as you have heard in my former Rules.

And as for this Method of Raising your Lotts, you may, according to this Rule,
place your Planets, (as you see in the Figure;) and that may serve for your
Example.

Then for your Judgment, turn to page 151, to 210. which tells you of all the
Power and Strength of all the Houses: As for Example, if your Question be of
the 7th house, see what Lot there is; if for a Brother, consider the Lot on
the third house; and so of the rest, and you will find an Answer to your desire.

Then observe how pure and easy it is, to that which we call Astrology, is so
transcendent and subtle an Art in it self, that therein a Man ought to have a
respect to many things, before he can obtain a true Judgment, because the Eye
of our Understanding will not pierce into the half thereof; and many there be
that pretend to it, and know nothing thereof, because their Understanding is
weak: for he that made all things, gives not to all Men alike.

Again, kind Reader, notwithstanding I have roved through the two great Bodies,
of that we call in Philosophy, Macrocosmus and Microcosmus, you shall find me
distinct from all you, that pin your selves upon Points of Religion; for it is
base, and an absurd thing, that those who are so seemingly united together,
should so barbarously exclaim one against the other, not minding the Scripture;
when he that created you all, has not given you Gifts alike; some for
Teachers, and others for Evangelists.

I have not, in all my Works, exclaimed against weak Judgments, nor extolled
the Wise; but I retain it in my Breast, and keep it to my self, considering,
that Man is the little World; and every Man acts within himself, and delivers
his Sentiments, as his Spirit gives him leave. But of this no more; only I must
tell you my Opinion, that this Angelical Art is pure and undefiled: if you are
willing to enquire, come without Fraud or Deceit, and you may have your Desire
answered by the Powers above; if you are afflicted, come in a right Method: for
it is the Powers above that guides thy Hand, and gives thee thy A B C, etc.

It was Abraham that found out the only true God, by his wonderful Works, viz.
in observing the Motions of the whole Creation. You that are counted Atheists
or Heathens, may be brought to true Faith, and the sooner, if you observe the
wonderful Works of God: then you will lay aside caviling about silly Words, or
Things of no value, between you, that are so near united together; and the Will
of God may be found out by the Wise and Prudent, and by his Rules, given to us
in the beginning of the World.

Observe the Faithful of Old, how they admired the great Works of Providence,
and Worshipped God by the Power of his Works. Adam being the first Man, Ergo,
most lawful; and those that are Unbelievers, God threatens, Lev. 26. 29. A
dependence of the Earth from the Heavens, Hos. 2. 21, 22. And by his Works, God
is to be seen, Deuteronomy. 33. 14. God expresses himself by his Works, 2 Kings 17.
16. The Element (...) ought to look into, Deuteronomy. 4. 19. The necessity of our
^ing into the Elements, Mat. 17. 14.

These, with many more places of Scripture, show plainly to Human Nature, That
God is to be known by his Works.

I will make a Final End of my Work, in these following Words.

DOmine, Domine Deus noster; quam admirabilis est Nomen t^um in universa terra!
quoniam elevata est Magnificentia tua supra Coelos: ex ore infantium and
lactantium perfecisti laudem, propter inimicos tuos; ut destruas inimicum and
ultorem: Quum videbo C^s, ope^^ digitorum tuorum, Lunam and Stellas quas ^u
fuadasti; quid est Homo, quod memor es ejus, aut filius Hominis, quoniam visit
as eum? Minuisti eum paulo minus ab Angelis, Gloria and honor coronasti eum,
and constituisti eum supra opera manuum tuorum; omnia subjecisti sub pedibus
ejus; oves and boves universas; volueres coeli and pisces maris, qui
perambulant semitas maris.

Domine Deus noster, quam admirabilis est Nomen tuum in Universa Terra!
