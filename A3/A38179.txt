Suburbs and liberties thereof; and throughout ye whole Kingdom.
Die Sabbathy 17. Iunij 1643.
I.A.B. in humility and reverence of ye Divine majesty, declare my hearty
sorrow for my own sins, and ye sins of this Nation, which have deserved ye
Calamities and Iudgmts yt now by upon it, And my true intention is, by God's
grace, to endeavor ye amendmt of my own ways; And yt I do abhor and detest ye
said wicked and treacherous Design lately discovered; and yt I never gave, nor
will give my assent to ye Execution thereof, but will, according to my power
and vocation, oppose and resist ye same, and all other of ye like nature: And
in case any other like Design shall hereaftr come to my knowledge, I will make
such timely discovery as I shall conceive may best conduce to ye preventing
thereof, And whereas I do in my Conscience believe, yt ye Forces raised by ye
two Houses of Parliamt are raised and continued for their just defense, and for
ye defense of ye true Protestant Religion, and Liberties of ye Subject, against
ye forces raised by ye King: I do, here in ye presence of Almighty God,
declare, vow, and Covenant, yt I will, according to my power and vocation,
assist ye Forces raised and continued by both Houses of Parliamt, against ye
Forces raised by the King without their Consent; And will likewise assist all
other persons yt shall take this Oath, in with they shall do in Pursuance
thereof, And will not directly or indirectly adhere unto, nor shall willingly
assist ye Forces raised by ye king without ye consent of hoth Houses of
Parliamt. And this vow and covenant I make in ye presence of Almighty God, ye
Searchr of all hearts, with a true intention to perform ye same, as I shall
answer at ye great day, when ye Secrets of all Hearts shall be disclosed.

This House does declare, yt all those that shall not take this Vow, and
Covenant, shall forth with be Disarmed, And no Soldiers entertayn'd, shall
receive pay until they have taken it.
