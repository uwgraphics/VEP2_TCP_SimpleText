RETURN FROM THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND, To the Commissioners of the General
Assembly of the Church of SCOTLAND.



EDINBURGH, Printed by EVAN TYLER, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1642.

Return from the Parliament of ENGLAND, To the Commissioners of the General
Assembly of the Church of SCOTLAND.
We the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, having with much
contentment perused the Brotherly and Christian Answer which the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland have made unto the Declaration formerly sent
unto them from us, and finding therein great expressions of love to this Church
and Kingdom, and of prudence and faithfulness in propounding those things
which may conduce to a more close and firm Union of the two Churches and
Nations of England and Scotland, in preserving and maintaining the Truth and
Purity of the Reformed Religion, not only against Popery, but against all
other superstitious Sects and Innovations whatsoever, Have thereupon resumed
into our considerations and care, the matters concerning the Reformation of
Church Government and Discipline, which we have often had in consultation and
debate, since the beginning of this Parliament, and ever made it our chiefest
aim, though we have been frequently interrupted, and powerfully opposed in
the prosequution and accomplishment of it.

And however we continue still in the storm and conflict, finding small
abatement of difficulty, and much increase of malignitie and perverseness, in
the opposition wherewith this great and necessary Work of Reformation is
encountered; yet we heartily thank God, and rejoice with our Brethren of
Scotland, for the Peace, Liberty, and Preservation which God has affoorded
them, taking it as a Pledge and Earnest of the like mercy intended to us, in
his good time; and hoping that he will not only free us from the most grievous
and d^structive miseries and calamities of a Civil War, but graciously
perfect our desires and endeavors of a full Reformation in all matters
appertaining to Religion: Which, as it is the greatest honor and service which
God receives from his People; so we acknowledge, with our Brethren, that it is
the surest Foundation of Glory, Strength, and Happiness, which he bestows
upon any Nation.

The manifold obstructions and impediments which we have met with in seeking
this great Blessing, do give to us and all Gods People, great cause of grief,
and works in us an earnest longing for the removal of them. Yet knowing that
all the wonderful works of God in this kind, have been brought to perfection
through many oppositions, and seeming impossibilities, that so the Conclusion
might be more glorious to his Divine Majesty, and comfortable to his Children,
we cannot but in humility and submission expect the like issue of our
wrestling and striving with that fierce and peremptory opposition which has
been framed and acted against us by the most subtle and busy Engines of
Satan, the most pestilent Incendiaries among us, the Jesuits from abroad, a
virulent and discontented party at home, consisting of the Prelaticall
Clergy, Atheistical Projectors against Religion, profane and sensual
self-lovers, heightened and inflamed against us with a spirit of malignitie,
beyond the example of former times, wherein we have had manifold occasions to
discern both our own weakness and imperfections, and the divine mercy and
goodness, and to hope that God having upheld us so long beyond our own
strength and merit, will bring us through at last, to the full accomplishment
of his own praise, and of the joy of this and other Churches.

We acknowledge it an Act of Love to us, and of wisdom for the good of both
Churches, for which we are thankful both to God and them, That our Brethren
of Scotland have bestowed their serious thoughts and earnest desires for Unity
of Religion, that in all His Majesty's Dominions there might be one Confession
of Faith, one Directorie of Worship, one public Catechism, and one form of
Church Government. And although it will hardly be obtained punctually and
exactly, unless some way might be found of a mutual Communication and
Conjunction of Council, and debate in framing that one form; yet both
intending the same end, proceeding by the same Rule of Gods Word, and guided by
the same Spirit, we hope by Gods Assistance to be so directed, that we may cast
out whatsoever is offensive to God, or justly displeasing to any neighboring
Church, and so far agree with our Brethren of Scotland, and other reformed
Churches in all substantial parts of Doctrine, Worship, and Discipline, that
both we and they may enjoy those Advantages and Conveniences which are
mentioned by them in this their Answer, in the more strict. Union of both
Kingdoms, more safe, easy, and comfortable Government of His Majesty, and
both to Himself and people a more free Communion in all holy Exercises and
Duties of Worship, more constant security of Religion, against the bloody
practices of Papists and deceitful Errors of other Sectaries, and more
profitable use of the Ministry: For the compassing and attaining whereof we
intend to use the labor and advice of an Assembly of godly and learned
Divines; for the conveening of whom, a Bill has already past both Houses,
which had taken effect long since, if we could have obtained His Majesty's
Royal Assent thereto. All which considered, we acknowledge the faithful and
affectionate expressions of our Brethren in wishing and desiring this great
Advantage for us, do fully deserve those thanks which we have formerly
expressed, and no whit stand in need of that Apology which they are pleased to
make.

The maine cause which hitherto has deprived us of these and other great
Advantages, which we might have by a more close Union, with the Church of
Scotland, and other reformed Churches, is the Government by Bishops, which to
strengthen it self, has produced many other differences in Discipline and
Ceremonies betwixt them and us, and is apt to work in the Minds of those who
are the Approvers and Defenders of it, such a dis-esteeme of, and opposition to
those Churches, as makes us desperate of that most beneficial and desirable
conjunction with them, until this great impediment be removed: Whereupon we
have entered into a serious consideration what good we have received from
Government by Bishops, which may countervaile such a loss and inconvenience;
and we are so far from apprehending any satisfaction herein, that we plainly
perceive it a cause of many other Calamities, Dangers, and intolerable
Burdens, being a dishonor to God by arrogating to themselves a Preheminencie
and Power which he has not given; by profaning the purity of his Ordinances
with the mixture of their own injunctions; by withstanding the frequent and
powerful preaching of the Gospel, that so their usurped Authority might
receive more easy admittance into the ignorant and mis-guided Consciences of
men; by corrupting the Ministry with Pride, Ambition, Coveteousnesse,
Idleness, and Luxury; by suppressing the spiritual power and efficacy of
Religion, and turning it into Formality and Pomp; by inclining to Popery, the
principles thereof being suitable to this Government, and contrary to those
principles which were the first Grounds of Reformation. We likewise find it
most pernicious to the Civil State and Commonwealth, In that the Bishops have
ever been forward to infuse into our Kings such Tenants and Positions as are
contrary to the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and to introduce Tyranny
and an Arbitrary Power over the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of the
Subject, and that they have been forward to incite the King against His People,
and by force of Arms to constrain them to submit to such an Arbitrary
Government, and by unlawful contribution of Money to assist His Majesty in
making War upon His Subjects: whereof there are many Evidences both in those
preparations, which not long since were made to invade Scotland, And in the
War now raised against the Parliament and Kingdom of England: And yet they
have showed themselves so ambitious of Sovereignty, that they forbear not to
maintain in Sermons and printed Books, that the Kings Scepter ought to submit
to Aarons Rod, and the Mitre to be above the Sword, which argues in them an
Antichristian Spirit, to exalt themselves above all that is called God: And a
design (when they have brought the Kingdom to be disposed at his pleasure) to
subject His Majesty to their own Arbitrary censures, that so themselves may
triumph in the bondage and slavery both of King and people.

Upon all which and many other Reasons we do declare, that this Government by
Archbishops, Bishops, their Chancellors, and Commissaries, Deanes, Deanes and
Chapters, Archdeacons and other Ecclesiastical Officers, depending upon the
Hierarchy, is evil, and justly offensive and burdensome to the Kingdom; a
great impediment to the Reformation and growth of Religion; very prejudicial
to the Civil State and Government of this Kingdom; And that we are resolved
that the same shall be taken away. And according to our former Declaration of
the seventh of February, Our purpose is to consult with godly and learned
Divines, that so we may not only remove this, but likewise settle such a
Government as may be most agreeable to Gods holy Word, most apt to procure and
conserve the Peace of the Church at home, and a happy Union with the Church of
Scotland, and other reformed Churches abroad, and to establish the same by a
Law which we intend to frame for that purpose, to be presented to His Majesty
for His Royal Assent: And in the mean time humbly to beseech His Majesty,
that a Bill for the Assembly may be passed in time convenient for the fifth of
November next, the miserable estate of the Church and Kingdom not being able
to endure any longer delay.

This being the resolution of both Houses of Parliament, we do desire our
Brethren of Scotland to concur with us in petitioning His Majesty that His
Royal Authority may be applied to the better Conservation of a firm Unity
between the two Kingdoms. And that they likewise will think good to send to
the same Assembly some godly and learned Divines of that Church, whereby an
Uniformity in form of Church Government may be obtained, And thereby a more
easy passage made to the settling of one Confession of Faith, one Lyturgie, or
Directory of Public Worship, and one Catechism in all the three Kingdoms;
which we hope through Gods blessing will have such an effect in all His
Majesty's Dominions, as will much advance the Honor and Service of God,
enlarge the Greatness, Power and Glory of the King, confirm the peace,
security and prosperity of all his good Subjects, make way to the relief and
deliverance of the poor afflicted Churches abroad, and to the total
abolishing of the Usurpation and Tyranny of Rome, being the prime Cause and
Fountain of all the Miseries and Calamities, the bloody Massacres, out-ragious
Cruelties, and bitter Persecutions of Gods People in all the Christian World
for many Ages.

RETURN FROM THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND, To the Lords of Privy Council of the
Kingdom of SCOTLAND.



EDINBURGH, Printed by EVAN TYLER, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty. Anne Dom. 1642.

Return from the Parliament of ENGLAND, To the Lords of Privy Council of the
Kingdom of SCOTLAND.
THe Lords and Commons in Parliament, have with approbation and thanks received
from the Commissioners of the Kingdom of Scotland, a clear manifestation of
the respect which the Lords of His Majesty's Secret Council for that Realm,
do bear to the Welfare and Peace of this Kingdom, in the expression of their
Affections, wherewith they were pleased to second the desires of the General
Assembly of that Church, for Unity in Religion, and Uniformitie in
Church Government in His Majesty's three Kingdoms. And having often had that
matter in debate, and our most serious consideration, the Christian Advice of
that reverend Assembly, and the grave Counsel of that Honorable Table,
concurring with our own Judgment, and Experience of the manifold mischiefs
and distractions, which the Government of the Prelacie of this Kingdom has in
all Times and Ages produced in this Church and State, Have moved us to bring
our Resolution to a more speedy maturity and conclusion: wherein, as we have
satisfied our own Reason, so we hope we shall satisfy the loving and
Christian desires of our Brethren of Scotland, Although we know, that hereby
we shall exceedingly irritate that opposite and malignant Party, who will bend
all their Invention and Force to interrupt this Work, and to ruin and destroy
us in the under-taking of it. And we desire their Lordships to consider, That
the Party which has now incensed and armed His Majesty against us, and his
other faithful Subjects in this Kingdom, is the same, which not long since
upon the very same design of rooting out the Reformed Religion, did endeavor
to begin that Tragedy in Scotland: which, whenever it shall be perfected in
either Nation, will easily be accomplished in the other; Religion being the
Band and Foundation of the Safety and Happiness of both.

And as we resolve according to the National Covenant betwixt the two
Kingdoms, to be careful of the Peace of Scotland, as of our own; So we
doubt not but their Lordships, and the Nation of Scotland will be careful to
express their brotherly kindness to us, and prudent care of themselves, by
restraining the evil affected amongst them, that they may not foment our
Troubles; and by all other ways, according to the Articles ratified in the
Parliaments of both Kingdoms, to maintain the Peace and Amity betwixt the two
Nations, and to restrain the mischievous Attempts and Practices of those who
are Enemies to both. That so through Gods blessing we may mutually rejoice in
one another Happiness, and yield His Majesty such a faithful subjection, as
may be honorable to Himself, comfortable to His People, advantageous to the
Professors of the Reformed Religion in other parts beyond the Seas.

John Brown Cler. Parliament.
