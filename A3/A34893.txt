The Crafty maids Approbation.
Wherein she shows either black or brown
It Is money makes them strait go down,
When pretty girls that gold has none
Their Fortunes still to lie alone.
To the Tune of, A Fig for France.


D^^w near to me young girls so ^ine
(...) means and Portions like to mine*
If you will but hear what I have penned
I will make you smile before I end:
I once had a sweetheart fair and young
Tho now from me he is fled and gone;
But I Will ^ell you a very good reason why
'Twas money did part my Love and I.
When first to me a wooing he came
He did ^^^re to know my name,
I told ^^n my means was small
He said he valued none at all:
So that my ^^ invour he could win
He valued nothing else a pin,
But now he is gone and I know why
'Twas money etc.
Yet for three years his love stood fe^
And he vowed for ever it should last
But when my frinds spoke of the (...)
Then he was for another dame:
Except so much money they would give
No wife for him I must not be:
His words he clearly did deny
So money did part, etc.
Thus maids may see so may I too
It is for money that young men (...)
Tho great store of love they do prete^^
Yet mark what falls out in the end*
When they find your Portions small
Like to a snake from you they will cra^
And to another straight they will hey
So money did part, etc.


Yet had I a head like a horse
Or a body as thick as a Mil-po^^
So but bags came tumbling i^,
Then my favor every fooll w^'^ win:
Or was I long-snouted like a Sow
Or else crookt backed like our fine Cow
^ave at her then these boys would cry
She Is money enough, and what care I.
Young men don't blush you know it is true
For let her name be Mary or Sue,
The she was blabber-lipt also blear-eyd
Yet money all those faults will hide
Nay were she the nast ^est dingest slut
That a man ^urst not after her crak a Nut
Had she but money house or land
I Am sure she would not stick long a hand
Yet we whose Portions are but small
Let us not be dismayed at all
Neither let us greive, lament no: swound
For beauties worth a thousand pound:
Hangt though my first true love be gone
I Have the same face for another man.
And I Will prove honest till I dye
Tho money, etc.
If two young men talk of a wench
As they do sit of an Ale-bench
She Is a good huswife the one replies
But has she money the other tryes:
If she has none she is not for me
Give me the Cash hang huswifrey
I love to finger that for why
It Was money did part my Love and I.
By this young girls may plainly see
By this young girls may plainly (...)
How deceitful these young men be
They Will search a maid from top to toe
Till all her secrets they do know:
Then if her means don't please his mind
He quickly can turn like the wind
I must have a wife with more he will e^^
So money, etc.
Such affection did that young (...)
That often called (...) his Dear
Such vows and (...) made it is known
But now he does (...) quit^ (...):
But since he is gone (...)
I Will slight him more than he (...)
I Will never lament nor (...) nor (...)
Tho money, etc.
I am full glad we parted in truth
For since I hear he is a crose-grain'd youth;
But had he proved true though never so ^^re
In wealth or woe ^'de bear a share
But now i am free i will let that ^lide
And never think more to be a ^ri^e
There Is nothing like to liberty.
Since money, etc.
Vhus have I told young maidens all
How the weakest must go to the wall
But she that is full and her purse well strung
She shall have sweet-hearts come ^ing done
Its no matter for breeding nor sense
So she has but, Cash he will have the wenth
Black nor brown he looks not o'th ^ye
'Twas money did part my Love and I.
