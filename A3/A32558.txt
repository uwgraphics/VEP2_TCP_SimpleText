A PROCLAMATION For the free Exportation of Woollen Manufactures of this
Kingdom, from the Twentieth day of May, until the Five and twentieth day of
December next.
CHARLES R.

WHereas His most Excellent Majesty is informed of much decay in the Trade of
Cloth, and other Woollen Manufactures of this Kingdom, and that great
quantities of Woollen Clothes do at present lie dead on the hands of many poor
Clothiers: His Majesty therefore out of His Princely clemency, and tender
compassion to the Necessities of His poor Subjects, does by the Advice of His
Privy Council, and with the free Consent of the Company of Merchant Adventurers
of England, hereby give free Liberty and License to all His loving Subjects,
from the Twentieth day of May instant, until the Five and twentieth day of
December next, to transport and carry out of this Kingdom, all Woollen
Manufactures whatsoever, to any Port or place beyond the Seas, lying within the
Limits and Bounds of the said Merchant Adventurers Patent, except the Mart
Towns of Dort and Hamburgh. Yet His Majesty would not hereby be thought to have
a light esteem of the services of that Company to Himself, and the Crown in
former times; nor of their usefulness toward the advance and increase of the
Trade of this Kingdom; nor does His Majesty by this temporary dispensation,
intend to lessen the Authority of their Charter, as to the Government of that
Society, either at home or abroad. And His Majesty does hereby require and
command, That during the time of this License and Dispensation, due Payment be
made of all Duties for Licensing the Exportation of white Clothes to the said
Company, being Lessees to His Majesty's Farmers thereof.

Given at Our Court at Whitehal, the Fourteenth day of May, 1662. In the
Fourteenth year of Our Reign.
