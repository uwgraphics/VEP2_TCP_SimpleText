His Majesty's Speech at Leicester, to the Gentlemen, Freeholders, and
Inhabitants of that County. July 20.
GENTLEMEN,
SInce I have found my presence so very acceptable amongst my good Subjects in
these Northern parts, and that the Errors and Mistakes amongst them, have
wholly proceeded from misinformation, and are removed with more satisfaction,
and ease to them then they were received; I hold it a piece of my duty, to take
the utmost pains I can, fully to inform and undeceive my People; and rather to
prevent Crimes, then to punish them: In this Errand I am come to you, amongst
whom there has not been the least misunderstanding, to show you, That I do
not suspect any malice in the Place, or in the People, though persons of as ill
dispositions have been busy in it, and amongst you, as in any County in
England, and such who have taken as great pains to do mischief, and to bring
Confusion as good men should for peace and happiness: Though it is as true, that
very many worthier persons amongst you have appeared of contrary affections,
which I shall always acknowledge: I am come to you in a time too, when nothing
could invite me to such a Journey, but my Affection to, and good esteem of
you; having sent such Propositions for Peace and Accommodation to my two Houses
of Parliament, that I hope to have no other use of your affections, but in your
Prayers; being sure they will submit to them with allacrity, if the unexcusable
Enemies to the Peace of the Kingdom be not strong enough to prevail: And then
you will find your selves so much concerned (for I have required nothing that
with more Justice can be denied me (if it be duly weighed) then my Crown, or
my Life may be taken from me) that I shall not need to ask your assistance: I
know you will bring Horse, Men, Money, and Hearts worthy such a Cause. Your
Religion, your Liberties, your Laws (which I will defend with my life, I mean
the good known Laws of the Land, not Ordinances without my consent, which
till within these twelve Months was never heard of from the Foundation of this
Kingdom) will be the Quarrel: And in such a Cause the taking away my Towns,
Ships, Arms, and Money from me, shall not dishearten me: The Concurrence and
Affection of my People with Gods blessing will supply and recover all.
