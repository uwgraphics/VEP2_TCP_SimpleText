A LETTER to the Lord General Monck In answer to his Excellencies LETTER unto
the Gentry of Devon; which also relates to the secluded Members, grievances of
the Citizens of London, Sir George Booth, and Nations in General.
May it please your Excellency,
HAving perused yours of the 21. of January from Leycester, unto the Gentry of
Devon, I find an expostulation or reasoning of the case in reference to our
present distractions, and extreme grievances of the people, then and every
where remonstrated unto you, Therefore, my Lord, since you have wisdom to
discover the several interests which you then mention to be interwoven both in
Church, State, etc. It will also be as considerable to consider that those
persons are but few in respect to the whole, and they are only those who now
obstruct our peace, and cause the Nations thus to complain; So that to make
any conclusion with your Excellency, that those are rational or satisfactory
grounds (under favor) cannot be admitted since it opposes the peoples freedom,
their ancient Rights, and that which is of more concernment, even the
Scriptures which (without yea and nay) are the revealed will of God, for that
the Government apparently declares it self to be built upon, or by the blood
and ruins (not to name all our consciences tells us) of our brethren,
Contrymen and friends, and is upheld by persons whose interests at this day
in temporals denies them any thoughts of Christ and his Laws, which is
restitution and severe repentance, and who certainly, although for a few days
of momentary joy they are seemingly by successeful errors allowed of, cannot
long deface this State, and once glorious Church of God, by which further I
must tell your Lordship, and all must confess, that those foundations thus
built upon are altogether sandy and fallacious, and all those who seek and
endeavor to be Builders in that Babel by the fierceness of the wrath of God
shall be destroyed even in the imaginations of their own hearts. And now, my
Lord, I am come to that particular where the people and the secluded Members,
as I humbly conceive, are denied a right upon a supposition of necessity, and
as to that the answer is easily reduced to this, who or what brought us or them
to this necessity, was it not former crimes? if so then, My Lord, all
necessities are lawful if not so, and that they dread not punishments or loss
of worldly interests for some deviations and crying sins, why do they not
acquiesse in this, that the power is in the people, as they for their own ends
sometimes did declare (those Members being twice the major part, and thrown out
by Cromwell and his adherents, these men then countenancing and contriving the
same which your Lordship knows has abundantly returned upon them to the great
destruction and hazard of these Nations, Therefore my Lord, I would to God I
might be the Prophet to forewarn you of the violence and oppression which is in
their hands, that you might be kept from so sinful compliances, for to defend a
few discontents in self interest only is obstinancy almost beyond parallel:
And therefore, my Lord, since Noble actions do always attend a generous mind.
It is my greatest hopes, and not only mine, but the expections and longings
for of these Nations (since the prise is put into your hands,) That you should
now be the happy instrument of their Redemption, by such conditions as may
secure all persons so concerned, or else what means all those Addresses made
unto your self from the City of London, tumults and importunate desires for a
Free Parliament of the Nations in General, whose burdens are unsufferable to
uphold the envious ambition of some few, and cannot but be grievous as
clamourous in your ears.

But, My Lord, there are yet some considerable Observations and remembrances to
be laid before you; was it not their sin in that place of Naboths Vineyard
that killed? and was it not the aggravation that they also took possession? Is
not rebellion as the sin of witchcraft? is it not our Saviors express
command, give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's? and is not this the Royal Law?
do as you would that others should do unto you; innumerable are the Texts, and
readings in History that might be here inserted, which doubtless, My Lord, you
will recollect to your eternal honor, and the everlasting peace and settlement
of these afflicted Nations, whose perjuries in breaking Allegiances, Vows and
Covenants, both with God and man, and lead thereunto by their various
Governors, even as if we had been in trouble until we were double damned in
sinning, and causing others to finne is matter of amazement. In a word, to
conclude your Excellencies trouble, be pleased to let this Maxim remain with
you, That Government which once becomes a byword to the people is not durable,
this is so, we have tried all forms and models, and this is yet the judgment
upon us, that we strive against his providence, and will not be healed: How
many who had commands almost equal with yours, have outlived the days they
might have been renowned, who by countenancing factions and crying sins
afterward fell into tribulation and great scorn, being tormented by their own
confederates: And this, my Lord, is the portion and fate of all such who put
their trust in man, taking indirect means to attain glorious ends, as they
pretended, and this perpetuates our thraldom and miseries, My Lord, It is
therefore my hearts desire, that you may employ the talent God has now put
into your hands to these purposes, which will for ever make you famous and
precious in the sight of God and Good men; and sure I am, it will abundantly
illustrate that joy which you may gain in that immortality and glorious life
to come, in the intrim you cannot but find the secret overflowings in your own
breast, the streams of which the people pray may never be diverted by
thousands per annum; and this, my Lord, with the present condition of that
noble Gentleman, Sir George Booth and others, who are now under great
sufferings for asserting their Countries Right, and freedom of Parliaments,
which is the sense and perfect desires of these Nations, is humbly offered unto
you as becomes your Excellencies

Most humble and faithful servant, C. E.
