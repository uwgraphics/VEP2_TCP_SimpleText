A Proclamation before the Lord STEWARD.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty does straightly charge and command all manner
of persons chosen for the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, to attend in this
present Parliament, that they, nor any of them do presume to sit, or take their
places in the House of Parliament, until they and every of them, have first
taken the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, in the usual manner and place; nor
until the Sheriff shall make return of his Writ, according to the Statute, unto
the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, and his or their names be there entered in
such manner as has heretofore been accustomed, upon pain of the peril that
shall fall thereon.

God save the King.

Parliament, make your appearance, and answer to your Names as you shall be
called.
