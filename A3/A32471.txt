in the Night time to assist such as are left on Board the Ships, in the
Imbezlement of the Goods, Stores, or Tackling Entrusted to their Charges: His
Majesty therefore, by Advice of His Privy Council, has thought fit to Publish
this His Royal Proclamation, And does hereby straightly Charge and Command all
and every person and persons whom it does or may concern, That they presume not
henceforth to use any such Dirt-Boats, or Bum-Boats upon any pretense or
occasion whatsoever, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost Perils.
And if any such Boats shall hereafter be found upon the River of Thames
contrary to the Tenor of this His Majesty's Proclamation, His Majesty does
hereby straightly Charge and Command the Master, Wardens, Assistants, and
Brethren of the Trinity House, the Officers of His Majesty's Pards, and the
Masters and Rulers of the Company of Watermen for the time being, and others
whom it may concern. That they cause such Dirt-Boats and Bum-Boats to be
Seized, and the persons so using the same, to be Arrested and brought before
His Majesty and His Privy Council; And that they do from time to time take
strict care that this His Majesty's Proclamation may be duly put in Execution.

Given at the Court at Whitehall, the Sixth day of April, In the Twenty third
year of His Majesty's Reign.
