TO THE Most Honored ANDREW TREVIL, Esquire.
SIR,
OF all the Attributes are owned by the Deity, This whereon I have engaged my
Pen, is the most remarkable and Glorious. Which I undertook the rather, and
with the more assurance, because I knew that if I did come short in my
Discourses on it (as who ever enterpriz'd it must) I had my consolation in my
Subject.

It is Divine Goodness to accept of what a Person has, and not of what he has
not. I know that God is great, as well as good, that he is in Heaven, and we on
Earth; and that therefore as in our addresses to him, so in our Discourses of
him, our words should be few. But I also know, what Cicero observed before me,
that he is Opt. Max. that he is first Good, and then Great, and that he glories
in his Goodness, as his greatest Excellency, [His making of his Sun to rise on
the Evil, and on the Good, and his sending Rain on the Just, and on the unjust,
is called his Perfection, and indeed is so, it is, be you perfect, as your
Heavenly Father is perfect.

Once, it is the Interest and Cause of God I plead in this Essay, and so much,
that all Religion is concerned in it. For it is an apprehension of the
Goodness, and Bounty, and Beneficence of God, that established in Men's hearts
does powerfully tie them to Adore, Obey, and Serve him. There is Mercy (says
the Royal Psalmist) with thee, that thou may be feared. It was for this
Reason that he prefaced the Law he gave the Jews, with a Repitition of the
benefits, which had accrued to them by him, I am the Lord thy God, which have
brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage, Thou shall,
etc. Namely to imprint upon them a due sense of all his Obligations and
Engagements, that having first possessed them of a rational and well
established Love, he might afterward the better influence them by it, to a due
respect to all his commands. ['Tis, if you love me keep my commands.] And the
Holy Evangel, wherein Almighty God is admirably represented as most infinitely
Loving, Gracious, and Benign, what other end, intention or design has it, but
by so ample proof and Declaration of the Divine Love to prevail with man for
his, that believing he may love, and loving he may serve and obey? This is the
Evangellical Obedience; that of Faith, which works by Love.

Thus our Love to God it is the life of all our Devotion and Obedience to him,
and his Benignity and kindness unto us, it is the ground of all our love. And
Satan knows it well enough, and therefore he is so industrious (for we are not
ignorant of his devices) to instill into the minds of men, hard and frightful
apprehensions of the great God; as that he rules by will; that he has no
consideration in the world of his Creatures comfort, but only of his own
Glory, that he made the greatest part of Men to damn them, and triumphs in
their Ruin; and that he cruelly exacts impossibilities, and obliges Men to
come, when yet he knows they cannot. And that Evil One is intimate enough with
all our minds, to know that if he can but once persuade them, that the Master,
whom we are to serve is most Tyrannical and hard, and that he reapeth, where
he has not sown, and gathers, where he has not strewed; no question, but we
will away, and dig and hide our Lords money, as that unfaithful servant did.

So much it is the interest of God and True Religion, that Divine Benignity be
vindicated; a work as necessary now as ever, when Lucretius is as much
consulted as Moses, and when there are almost as many, who blasphemously
dispute Divine Goodness, as there are that seriously believe it. And it is
with those I principally deal.

In doing which I have endeavored to acquit my self, not only Philosophically
by alleging Reasons which Philosophy, Common sense, and the Natures of the
things I treat of, do suggest to me, but also as a Christian, by blending with
those other, such considerations also as the sacred Oracles (whereon I most
rely) do prompt me with; not insisting on the former, (which yet too many do)
but as they have the countenance and favor of the latter.

This, Sir, is what I offer you. Be pleased to accept an Essay [but a Part of
that whole you have a Title to] which with those designs, and this Furniture
(such as it is) does lay it self before you, at your seet? It Is its Ambition,
to have a Person for its Parton, whom its Subject has for its Admirer. And it
cannot easily despair of being owned by you, and so of being made another
Instance of your great Goodness, of which its Author is already One, seeing to
be so, it is enough to need it.

And, Sir, with this high Encouragement it is, that I presume to own my self in
these circumstances, in that capacity you long ago vouchsafed me the honor to
be, even that of

SIR, Your most humble Servant, and Son Richard Burthogge.
Bowden near Totnes, Oct. 9. 1671.
AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.
THE Method I have taken in the following Discourse, is to second the
evincements, which I urge from common Reason, or Nature, with the suffrage of
the sacred Oracles. Which that the Reader may not mis-interpret, and accuse of
want of judgment, seeing my pretenses are against the Atheist, who believes
not Scripture; he is to know, that there are Reasons for the Atheist, which
though to make them more perspicuous, and convincing, I have backed with the
verdicts of the gravest Philosophers, and to show them to be also Scriptural, I
have confirmed from the Scriptures; yet I insist not on them with the Atheist,
as they are Scriptural, but as they are Reasons, Scriptural Reasons. He may
understand me, that I Insist not with him on the Authority, but on the Reason
of Scripture.

And yet truly taking on me to assert the Christian Religion, and such
Apprehensions of the Great God, as that obliges us to have, I thought it point
of Duty, not only to produce Reasons, and Notions, that might satisfy, but
also to evince them Scriptural; for as much as otherwise, though they might be
Philosophical, and carry in them something of conviction, yet not being
Scriptural, they could not possibly be Christian, and so answer my Ends.

In Fine, to be ingenuous with him, I was willing to annex the Testimonies of
the Scriptures, and of Philosophers together, to all or most of those
considerations I insisted on from Nature, or Reason, that I might insinuate
into the Atheist a good belief of Scriptures; as, that there is some conformity
in them with Nature, that they are replenish't with recondite wisdom; and that
that Religion comprehended in them is a piece of high Reason, and Philosophy.
And he cannot but believe all this, when he shall see before his eyes, so good
a correspondency and understanding between them.

As for the Philosophers, I have quoted them at large, and in their own Terms,
that I might not be suspected to abuse them, or my Reader; but yet have so
conveniently disposed the Texts, that those, who list not to attend to them, as
perhaps a many will not, that yet may have a mind to read the Rest, they may
skip and pass them over, without any great trouble or interruption.

Only one thing must be noted, that in some of these Citations I have made of
the Philosophers, it is the Medium, the Reason only, which I urge them for;
the Application being mine perhaps and not theirs; which yet I cannot
reasonably be arraigned for, seeing it is certain, that the Reason may be one
and the same, when yet the matters wherein it is to hold are innumerous. And
though I have Supposed a God to be, and all things in the world to be made by
Him, it is no more than what my Subject justifies; and yet by way of Obviation
to the Atheists Cavils, I have occasionally proved it, toward the end of this
Discourse; and therefore, if in Reading any part of it, a such exception do
arise, I must oblige the Reader to suspend his thoughts a little, till it be
removed.

I intended not to give my Reader any further trouble here, but on second
thoughts, I crave his pardon if I do, because it looks to some, as if there
were an irrepairable defect in the following Discourse in one Point, in as much
as I have quoted no Philosophers about it (and it is believed I cannot;) not
having given any intimations of the knowledge of a Savior [the greatest
instance of Divine Benignity] and of the method of salvation by him, among the
Gentiles. And indeed I purposely declined the doing that, because it is a point
that will oblige me to a large Discourse another where; but yet for present
satisfaction, if I should say there were among the Heathen, some darker
intimations of that great Truth, for which we Christians are beholden to the
Evangel, though I might be judged very Paradoxical therein, yet I conceive, I
should affirm nothing, but what I had authority enough to verify.

It cannot be denied, but that the Ancient Heathens understood that God was
unattoneable, but by humane blood; the Canaanites did offer up their Children
unto MOLOCH [ Deuteronomy. 18. 10.] and conformably the Carthaginians, Plat. in
Politic.
who were a Colony of Canaanites, did yearly offer some of theirs to Saturn.
Among the Lacedaemonians, Vid. and Stuckium de sacr. and sacrif.
the Altar of Diana Orthia was besprinkled once a year, with humane blood; two
Persons being Annually elected by the Lot for Sacrifice. Which usage, Bodin de
Rep. lib. 1. c. 5. Number. 34. 35.
as it was highly barbarous and cruel, is affirmed to be changed by the great
Lycurgus for a milder; he ordaining, that the persons on whom the Lot did fall,
Pausan. in Lacon.
instead of being killed, should be whipped, till the blood did flow. And with
that, they did besprinkle the Altar.

This is much, but there is more. For some of them did understand, (if yet they
understood what their Performances employed) not only that the great God was
not to be propitiated and attoned but by humane blood; but also, that that
blood must be the blood of One that was to take upon him (as it were) the
Persons and the guilt of all, or of an One that by his sufferings was to purge
and cleanse the rest that offered him.

And this is evident, Nic. Leonic. Thom. de varia hist. liq. 3. cap. 33.
in that the old Athenians every year in (their) Thargelion, did sacrifice a
Man and a Woman, for the Men and Women of their City, to Expiate and Lustrate
them; and those whom they did sacrifice, they called So the Author, but better
Pharmaca.
Pharmaci, as who would say, that those were persons, who, by being sacrificed
and offered up unto the Gods, were proper Medicines to purge and cleanse those
others (from their sins) that offered them.

And it will be yet more manifest, De var. hist lib. 3. c. 106.
if we consider what Leonicus Thomaeus further tells us out of Lycophron, that
in the most ancient times, if on any City there fell a Judgment of Famine, or
Plague, or Sword, or other great Calamity, they were wont to take the vilest,
and most vicious person in it, whom they called a Or rather Catharma and
Pha^macon.
Catharmus, or a Pharmacus, and him they carried to the place of sacrifice; and
having there performed several Ceremonies, at last they burned him, and threw
his ashes into the Sea, and so appeased the Gods. It is not to be doubted, but
that something Figurative and Mystical did lie in this; for otherwise they
knew, what by the Light of Nature is remarkable to All, that to the Best, the
Best was to be offered: And indeed the usage seems but a Depravation of the
Grand Tradition of the Seed of the Woman, and of that Propitiation and
Atonement to be made to God for Sin by the offering up the Man Christ which
was the ground of all Propitiatory Sacrifices

It Is not improbable, but Caiaphas, of whom the Holy Ghos^ does witness, that
he prophesied* and wist it not, that is, that he spoke righter than he was
aware of* alluded hereunto, in saying it wa^ necessary one should die for the
People, he meaning (it is likely) that it was very fit, that one [intending
Jesus Christ] should be made a kind of Pharmacus or Catharmus, and so be
offered as a Victim for the People, to settle its Tranquillity and Peace.

And indeed Jesus Christ he is the true Pharmacum and Catharma for the whole
World; it is he that taking on him the iniquities of us all, did make his Soul
an offering for Sin, by whose Stripes we are healed. and of him it is that our
Apostle says (and perhaps alluding to the Grecian Lustrations, as well as to
the Jewish Purgations) That he did -- -- (...)that he did by himself purge our
Sins; or which is aequivalent, that in his own person, he was our true Catharma.

I might also argue their imperfect knowledge of a Savior from the many
Appellations which I find among them of their Jupiter, as Jupiter Melichius,
Jupiter Eleutherius, Jupiter Servator, etc. And also take a hint to show from
whence they had it, namely from the Old and First Believers, from whom they
took this usage to denominate their Jupiter, as these were wont to do their El,
or Jehovah, from occasional occurrents, as El Roi, Jehovah=Nissi, etc. I say,
they seem to have received these intimations of the true Religion, not so much
from the Jews, whom generally all the Gentiles hated; of whom they make but
little mention in their Writings, and with whom they did not care to converse,
as by the Catholic Tradition of the world, from the First and most Ancient
Ages, and Patriarchs. So Plato who is express. -- (...) (...) --. Platon.
Politic.
Again. -- (...) -- Id. in Philebo.
Again. -- (...) -- Ibid.


But to return, there is one Authority more that I shall urge, and that is
Plato's, who seems to have pointed his Disciples to our Savior, for who else
can he be thought to mean, when he tells them they should adhere unto his
Dogmata, but till another Person, a Divine One came, who would instruct them in
the Truths themselves, and him they were obliged to hear.

I confess, I never met with this passage in the works of Plato my self (and
yet he seems in his Politics to hint something of an (...) a fit Messenger,
one that should reveal things) but in an Author, who it is to be presumed, had
it in the Schools of Plato, in him I have; and that is AEneas Gazaeus, who
introduces Theophrastus (one of the Persons in a Dialogue, which he intitles
so) assenting to Axitheus, the other, in these terms. -- Agnosco quod dicis
optime: Nam and Platoni ipsi placuit, ut suis decretis eatenus staretur, dum
aliquis divinior homo in terris appareret, qui veritatem ipsam aperiat, cui
conveniens sit omnes assentiri, atque obtemperare.

There is one thing more I must entreat the Reader not to be offended with, and
that is, that I here annex some farther Testimonies of Philosophers, which
might indeed have more conveniently been added in their proper places, in the
Body of the Discourse it felf: but that the Copy being out of my hands, I was
not capable of doing that: and yet I was unwilling to omit them, they seeming
unto me so full of evidence and clearness, and so apt to bring a great addition
of light, to what I have already offered from others.

I have said in my Discourse, that God is therefore Liberal, Bountiful, and
Beneficent, because he is most Perfect, and is the Best Being, and I am here to
say, it is no more than what is intimated to us by Maximus Tyrius. -- (...)
Max. Tyr. Dissert. 2^.


Again, for as much as I have said that the Heathen understood somewhat of the
State of Happiness, wherein Divine Bounty did at first establish man, it is no
other than what Plato means, Plato in Politic.
when in his Politics he treats of the Golden Revolution under Saturn. For
he declares that to be a time, when God did rule, when Men were naked, and
when the Earth afforded all things unto Men without labor; that in it Men had
a vast and comprehensive knowledge of the nature of things, that they did
confer, and talk with the Beasts, and that these were tame and friendly unto
one another, and that all were subject to man. Who sees not in this Tradition
how agreeable it is unto that of Moses.

But Hierocles, (besides what I have cited out of him, about the State of
Pre-existence, which I have evinced to be this of Innocence) does in his
Definition of Philosophy, egregiously insinuate, that Man in former time, was
in another Condition, infinitely more Agreeable and Happy than his present, and
that then He was in Gods Image. For the Definition that he gives us of
Philosophy, is to this purpose, that it is a Restitution of a man unto his
proper state of Happiness, that of which he was possesled heretofore, and
withal a re-conforming of him to the image of God. You shall have his own
terms, (...). Hierocl. in Carm. Pythag. p. in princip.


As for the Impotency of the Humane Will, and the cause thereof, that Notion of
it I have offered in the Treatise, is the very same with what Max. Tyrius does
allege as his. -- (...) -- Max Tyr. dissert. 22.


And what I said of Grace, or of Divine Assistance, how absolutely necessary
it is, that we may do good, is but what the Author last mentioned, does also
say. -- (...) --

I had almost forgotten one passage in Plato, about a Future Judgment, which
added unto that of Plutarch, I have cited in the following Treatise, will
render the belief of that Article most Rational. And it is so full and clear a
testimony of it, and so particular, that that account thereof in Matthew, has
not, in respect of its distinctness so great advantage of it, as in respect of
its authority it has. For my part I am astonished at it: It Is in his Discourse
De Rep.

Therein, he introduces ERUS, the Pamphilian, Son of one Arnienius; a Person
slain in Battle, and fabled to have risen again, the twelfth day after, as they
were laying him upon the (Funeral) Pile. Him he introduces reporting to the
Inhabitants of the present World, the Observations he had made in the other;
which he was commanded to recount, at his return to this, and he brings him in
speaking thus. (...) --

In fine the Method I have taken in evincing the Benignity of God, from the
instances thereof, that are in things, is the very same that Socrates, Plato,
Cicero, Plat. de legib. lib. 10. Id in Epinom.
(Authors worthy to be read in all Languages) and others of the Ancients used
to establish Providence. Xenoph. de fact and dict. Socrat. lib. 1.
Galen's laudatory Hymn in honor of the Great Creator, is admirable, Cicer de
not. Deor. lib. 2.
and verily the ablest Christians that have gone the same way as Lactantius did
of old, and as Lessius, Morney, and some others do of late, have not got a foot
beyond them. It was therefore I but hinted things on that head, because I would
oblige my Reader to consult with these.

I had many other things to add, but I fear, I have already surfeited the
Reader, And I know it is not fit the Gates should be too wide; only I will
tell him, I have offered more Reasons, why the Great God defers the punishment
of the wicked, and bears with them so long, because my subject did not fairly
lead me to it; I considering that Patience, Long-suffering, and forbearance of
Almighty God, as a great example and instance of his Goodness, and no objection
against it. And so did the Apostle, who puts them together. Or despisest thou
the riches of his Goodness, and Forbearance, and Long suffering, not knowing
that the Goodness of God leads thee to Repentance.

But those who will not be content with this account thereof, may be pleased to
converse a while with Plutarch, who having undertaken in a Treatise made on
purpose, to solve this common appearance, has quit himself as excellently in
it, as he does in all things else he undertakes. He shows it is, that God might
be an Example of the Goodness he would have us imitate; that the wicked might
have time to repent; that though he does defer their punishment, he does not
pardon 'm? It Is that the Wicked may be instruments to punish others, and for
many other Reasons, which he mentions there.

And now I Will cast my self upon the Readers ingenuity and candor, when I have
once confessed freely to him, that I have nothing else to offer in excuse for
this unusual trespass on his patience, but that of Apuleius. Apul Florid. lib.
-- Nec quidquam omnium est quod possit in primordio sui perfici: sed in
omnibus ferme ante est spei rudimentum quam rei experimentum.

DIVINE GOODNESS Explicated and Asserted.
CHAP. I.
Goodness an Essential Notion of God. The Definition of it. Divine Perfection
or Allsufficiency what. That it is the fundamental Reason of Divine Goodness.
An impression of it on the Creature. Divine Goodness demonstrated out of
Metaphysics, and out of Nature, by Instances and Harmony.

SECT. 1.
THE Goodness of the great God, or rather his Optimity, and (...), is so
illustrious and acknowcedg'd an Attribute of his, that the very Heathen knew
him, and adored him by it: Their Jupiter was Optimus as well as Maximus. And it
is a Notion so inherent unto that of God, and so inseparable from it, that you
destroy the Godhead, if you but abstract Goodness; not to make him Good, is to
make him no God. It is the Devil is the evil one; God is the Good. [ He is
Good, and does Good.

This Optimity or transcendent Goodness of the great God, is nothing but that
insinite Perfection, whereby he eminently in himself involveth all Good, and
consequently, whereby (seeing all de^siable, amiable, excellent, and lovely
things are centred, and comprehended in him,) he is most lovely, all lovely,
and all desirable. He is the universal Good, in whom the universal love, and
universal desire, the desires of all things, and the loves of all, do all
concentrate. And (says Aristotle) what all does desire, is simply good; so
none is good but God. He is universally, others but particularly good. This is
Aristotle's (...) -- (...). Arist. de ^o ib. l. 1. c. 1,
-- (...). ^d l. 5.


Now it is the infinite Perfection or Alsufficiency of God, in respect of which
the celebrated Aristotle calls him (...), and which is signified in the Holy
Scriptures by the name El Shaddai, a name by which he is remarkable, not only
to the Jews, but also to the Greeks and Latins, for as much as (...) (from
which his Title Shaddai probably deriveth) does seem to be the Origin of the
Genitive (...), of the Dative (...), and of the Accusative (...), from the
Nominative (...), and not unlikely the Latin Deus and the phrase sub Dio (as a
learned Critic wittily conjectures) comes from it. I say this absolute
Perfection [or infinite concurrency of all things excellent, and Good, and
lovely in God, whereby he being absolutely perfect and accomplished in all
kinds, as standing on the Top of all, does defect and want in nothing, which
is good in any;] It is the ground of his Optimity, or Universal Convenience,
and Desireableness. For he therefore is most agreeable and good to all, and
consequently most Desirable, because he is All; he is the (...), that
Universal, First, Original, and Fountain-Fulness, that replenisheth the whole
Creation, which without him would be all but empty Cask, and mere vacuity. All
the Creatures, their Springs are in God, they are but Cisterns with him, and
without him, empty Caskes. God is (...), the the Plenitude of all things, and
it is his Plenitude that botomneth his Goodness. So Aristotle, -- (...). Again;
-- (...), etc.

And, God, he has enough for himself, and all things else, My Grace is
sufficient for thee.

There is an evident impression on the world, of this Alsufficiency and (...)
of God; the World is an Universe, there are in it all imaginable Sorts of Being
and all imaginable Furniture, Provisions, and Accomodations for them; Porus
marries Penia; there are Remedies for all Distempers; agreeable supplies for
all Occasions and Necessitie^; there is nothing wanting, no more than is
Redundant in Nature. Vide Plutar de Placit. Philosoph. l 1. c. 5.
The Earth is the Lords, and the fullness [the fulness] thereof. Philo^ophers
call the world (...), Universum.

SECT. 2.
Now, having showed what Optimity, or Transcendent goodness is, wherein it
formally consists, as well as what Foundation, and what ground it has; it now
remains, that I do evince it competent to God* which I shall Essay to do,
(but very briefly) both from the Metaphysics, and from Nature it self.

And there are many Topics in the Metaphysics, which do evidently argue and
evince him so Good; I shall insist on one, That as there is a first Being, so
there is a first Good; there is a First in every Kind, a First in genere
bonorum, as there is in genere entium; for as much as every thing is either
First, or from it. And if there he a Primitive and First Good, which all
inferior ones derive from, and do participate (as, if there be a First, they
must) It is the First Being, and consequently it is God, which is it. Good and
Being are convertible; and therefore the First Being is the First Good. God is
the First Being. All Second Beings are derived from the First Being: All Second
and inferior Good participates the First Good.

And for Physics. The Divine Optimity or Transcendent Goodness is so remarkably
impressed on the whole Universe, that Moses that excellent Origenist,
introducing God reveiwing it in its Creation, does also introduce him thus
commending it; God saw every thing that he had made, and behold [behold] it was
very good, it was good, very good, (...); and God saw it. It was very good in
Gods eye, and therefore may be well so in Man's; and very Good it is,

For there is Nothing in the whole world, but is good for something, if it be
not so for one thing, it is so for another; and is either Good to profit, or to
please; a Verity so great, that in the Metaphysics Bonity and Entity are made
convertible; [that cannot be at all, that is not good.] Only, all inferior is
Dispersed good, and Limited; so that what is eminently good in one kind, is
very rarely so in another; that is seldom most useful, and of most advantage
for either Medicine or Meat, which is most embellisht and adorned. The creeping
Worms, many of them, are more curiously set off, and clad more richly, than the
noblest Animals. Solomon in all his Glory, was not half as brave, and as
magnificent, as a Tulip; and yet a Tulip, that is the most beautiful and the
most fair, it is the least useful, and least medicinal of Flowers. What is most
gaudy, is not most great, God has tempered the body together, giving more
abundant honor to that which lacked it. The Goodness shining in the world, is
a Wise one, a well ordered Goodness.

But to return, it were endless to expatiate all the world over, and to
instance in the Excellencies scattered in it, there is an admirable Majesty in
Man, and in the Heavens a magnificence and grandeur, which surprizeth all that
view them. How infinitely pleasant is the Spring! and in it, how gaudy is the
Earth! and in how delicate pentadoes is it clothed! All the Seasons have their
proper goodness; the world cannot subsist without them. There are in them, and
as in them, in all things else, so infinite, and so agreeable Varieties, such
Miracles of Beauty, Order, and Proportion to entertain and feast the Atheist,
that they cannot but convince him, if he once attend, that seeing there is so
much excellency and goodness in the things made, there must needs be infinitely
more, in him that made them.

SECT. 3.
Moreover, it is as easy to demonstrate from the world, and from all
Appearances therein, as it is to undertake it, that all inferior is
participated good; that seeing all participation is of some Superior, there is
not any Good below, but what is from One above, and does descend; and that the
great God, the Highest Being, is of necessity the Best.

For there are in the world many Classes, Ranks, and Orders of Beings, and very
comely disposition of them, Secundum sub and supra, of one above another, but
of all in such Relation, that those Perfections, which are scattered in the
inferior, are collected and amassed ^n the Superior; and what are col^ected
and amassed in the Superior, are dispersed and scattered in the inferior. So
that, as the lower any Being is, it, having the fewer perfections, is the less
perfect and good; so the higher any is, it having more perfections, is the
better, and consequently the Highest Being is the best. God is the Father of
Lights from whom every good and perfect gift descends. All ascent upon the
scale of Being, is by Addition; all descent, is by Substraction, and
Participation. There is participated intelligence in Man; participated Reason
in Beasts; participated Sense in Vegetables; participated Life in Naturals.
Nature is in Vegetables, with vegetative Life; Nature and vegetative Life, with
Sense in Sensitives; Nature, vegetative Life, and Sense, with Reason in
Rationals; and no higher can we go upon the scale, in the visible world. So
well contrived and Harmonical the world is. Witness Cicero. -- Est enim
admirabilis quaedam continuatio, seriesque rerum, ut alia ex alia nexa, and
omnes inter se aptae, colligataeque videantur. De' Not Deor. lib. 1.


CHAP. II.
Sect. 1.
Two consequent Notions from that of God's Goodness, Beneficence, and Finality.
Divine Beneficence defined, and demonstrated from Divine Bonity, and Supremacy,
and in Providence. Testimonies of Providence from Pythagoras, Socrates,
Aristotle, Cicero, etc. What Epicurus and Lucretius thought of it.

SO much for Divine Goodness or Optimity, considered absolutely in it self; but
for its Offspring; there are other Attibutes resulting from it, two of which I
shall consider, viz. The Infinite Beneficence or Benignity of God, and then his
absolute Finality; that he is good to all, as well as in himself, and is the
End of all.

Divine Beneficence, (wherein I comprehend the Love, and Kindness, the Mercy,
Grace, Benignity, and Bounty of God) is that infinite Diffusiveness of Nature,
whereby he is most ready to Communicate, and to impart the Good is in him. A
perfection so Essential to him, that he could not be a God, because not Good,
without it; it being this communicativeness, this propensity of Nature to
impart, that in the common Sense and Language of the whole World, does
eminently entitle and denominate one so. For He in common Language is
denominated a Good, who is a Liberal, a Loving, a Kind, a Merciful, an
Appeasable, and Bountiful Man; as also in the sacred Scriptures, For a good Man
one will even dare to die; and for a Good, is for a Bountiful, Benign,
Merciful, Ingageing Man: One that has obliged him by courtefies, and is his
Benefactor, for such an one another may dare it.

And such an One is God; his Name Vide Arist. ubi supra.
of Alsufficiency implies it, for El Shaddai, or his Name of Alsufficiency is
composed of (...) which signifies Sufficience, and of the relative (...), as
who would say, Divine Sufficiency is Relative: the (...) of God is (...); and
it is imported in that ravishing expression, My Grace is sufficient for thee.
For were not this employed in it, that what sufficiency soever is in God, is in
him for the Creature, to assist and help it, what consolation could it
minister? or what encouragement? It Is only relative Sufficiency that is a
consolation or encouragement, an absolute one is none. For God to say he has
enough, but not to give it, were to tantalize. But God's Sufficiency is
relative, he is very liberal, and open handed, and he cannot possibly be
otherwise, because he is so good.

For all Good, it is communicative and Diffusive, and by how much more good a
Being is (if that inelegance be tolerable) by so much more Diffusive (as
Philosophers assure us) and more communicative it is: so that God in being most
good (...), the absolutely best, is also most Diffusive and Beneficent. It is a
Scriptural connection, that God is good and does good; that is, He is in
proportion as propense to be communicative, and imparting as he is good; he is
good and does good, (...). As is the Man so is his strength, God is abundant in
goodness. He is the Original, Fountain, and First Good; and so has all Good
for others, as well as in himself.

And the world shows it, for as on Porphyrie's Tree the higher grades are the
commoner, and more extensive too they be, and the highest are the most so; so
on the scale of Being, the lower and inferior, which are more immersed in
matter, are the more determined and contracted, but the higher and Superior,
which are more immersed and spiritual, are more diffusive and free. All
Confinement is from Earth and Matter, but it is form and Spirit, that is the
Root of all enlargement and freeness. Minerals are absolutely determined;
Vegetables, less; Animals, spontaneous; Rationals arbitrary. Thus also in
Mechanic Spirits, the subtiler they are, the more spreading. And Light of all
Corporeal Beings, the most refined and pure, is also most imparting and
diffusive.

Now God, He is an absolute pure and spiritual Act, inhabiting in Light as
inaccessable as glorious, and therefore, seeing he Presideth on the Top of all
Being, he cannot but be infinitely Free, and so much more, more imparting and
communicative than is any other, as he is purer and more high than it. For
says our Savior, If ye then being Evil, know how to give good gifts to your
Children, how much more shall your Father which is in Heaven, give good things
to them which ask him. Evil is opposed to Heavenly, if ye being Evil. etc. How
much more shall your Father, which is in Heaven, etc. To be earthly is to be
evil, narrow, and illiberal. But what is pure Heavenly and High, is free and
noble. God is the most High, and therefore most communicative.

But to give the Atheist Instances, as well as other Proofs and Demonstrations
of Divine Beneficence. It is Illustriously exemplified in his Providence; which
is so visible in all the world, that it is acknowledged by all Philosophers
(not to mention Poets, Orpheus, etc.) and particularly,

In sum by all others, who acknowledged a Divinity (but in a very different

[Of whom Vellius in Cicero. -- Quod si ita est, vere exposita illa sententia

SECT. 2.
Providence described, and specified. (1.) It Is General, Particular, Special,
most Special. The great evincement of it, that all things are ordered for the
best (1.) In the Natural World! This showed by many Instances in Nature.

Now Providence it self, whereof the Stoics were so great Assertors, Cicer. de
not. deor. lib. 1.
that it is called by Velleius. Stoicorum (...), Apul. de dogm. Platon ubi
susupra. Plutarch. de Fato.
is Nothing but the Fatherly and prudent care of God, in ordering of the
Universe. To comprehend which, whoever has a Family of his own, or knows what
it is to have one, and what to Govern it, he need but to consider that the
World is God's. The World is a great House, and God is Master in it. Plutarch.
Symposiac. lib. 8. quaest. 1.
He is that great Father, of whom all the Family in Heaven and Earth is named;
and his Providence, is but his ordering and disposing, his Looking (as we call
it) to his Family, and his caring and providing for it. Providence is (...).

And this his Providence, Senec. de Provid. c. 1.
as it is general and comprehensive, extending over all the kinds so it also is
particular, and reaches every individual and numerical thing in every kind;
for, as he preserves Man and Beast in general, Chrysip in Plutarch. Apul de
mundo. Senec. not. quae st. vid. omnes ubi supra.
so a Sparow in particular, falls not without our heavenly Father. And indeed
it is no more beneath the divine Majesty, to provide and care for all, than it
was to form all, and make them. Cicero is plain it is so in Men.

-- Quae si singula vos forte non movent, universa certe inter se connexa,
atque conjuncta movere debebunt. Nec vero universo generi hominum solum, sed
etiam singulis a diis immortalibus consuli, and provideri solet Cicer. de not
deor. lib. ^.
But it is more distinguishing and sp^cial over Mankind, than over others, and
so eminently so, that in comparison thereof, whatever providence he has for
other Species. (that are lower) is esteemed none. Does God take care for Oxen?
yes, but not comparatively; God eminently cares for men. Hear Cicero,

-- Nam cum ceteras animantes abjecisset ad pastum, solum hominem erexit, ad
coelique quasi cognationis domiciliique pristini conspectum excitavit: etc.
Cic. de legib. lib 1.
But it is most distinguishing and special over pious and religious Men, or
those that fear him, He is the Savior of all Men, but especially, of those
that believe; and there is Reason for it. For Pious and Religious, are Divine
Men; they are the very Habitations, Houses, and Temples of the great God, and
so it is (...) special interest to look to these. The Hairs of their Head are
numbered. So the Apostle, -- Ye are the Temples of the Holy Ghost. -- Partakers
of the Divine Nature.

And so Cicero, -- Quod autem ex hominum genere consecratos, sicut Herculem,
and ceteros, coli lex jubet, indicat omnium quidem animos immortatales esse:
sed fortium bonorumque divinos. Been vero, quod Men's, Pietas, Virtus, Fides,
consecratur manu: quarum omnium Romae dedicata public templa sunt, ut illa qui
habeant (habent autem omnes boni) deos ipsos in animis suis collocatos putent.
etc, Cic. de legib lib 2.
-- NEMO igitur vir magnus sine aliquo afflatu divino unquam fuit, etc. Cic. de
not deor. lib. 2.


I intend not to expatiate now on this subject, but only to illustrate in it,
the Goodness, and Beneficence of God: which, I suppose, I shall have done
effectually, when I have proved, that all things in the world, are contrived
and ordered for the best; and all administrations in it so conducted. All is
for the best, both in the Natural and Moral World.

And verily, it were as easy to evince at large (if I had leisure) that all
things in the Natural World are ordered and contrived for the best, Ki^cher.
Magnet. l. 1 par. 2.

the obliquity of the Zodiac, and the motions of the Sun and Moon respectively
therein. The Alternations of the Seasons, of Day and Night, of Summer and
Winter. The happy coaptation of the Sea and Land into one Globe and Center. The
Saltness of the Sea; its perpetual Aestuation, Flux and Reflux. The Elevation
and Depression of the Earth in Hills and Valleys. The Irrigation of it with
Rivers. Rain from Heaven. The freshness of the Rain, as well as of Rivers. The
Elasticity of the Air, or its springiness: its ventilation by Winds; the
purgation of it by Storms, Lightnings, and Thunders. The commodities of
Navigation. The admirable circumstance of Providence, to render a Torrid Zone
(beyond the Apprehension of the old Philosophers, and School men) habitable.
The Breezes and Monsoons. The Distribution of the Gifts of Nature, some to one
Country, some to another, but of all to none.

And it where infinite to instance in the particulars (whereon some able
persons have very learnedly discoursed) of the Fabric and Anatomy of Plants
and Animals; the Beauty of the former; the Instincts of the latter; the
Propagation of the kinds in both; the Subordination and Usefulness of all; and
in the plentiful Provision which is made for all; wherein the Order of the
House is admirable.

There is an infinite increase of little Fishes, Herberts travels, lib. 1.
L'Blancs travels, par. 3. c. Sandys travels, l. 2. etc.
on which the greater were to prey; and in the Island of Fierro, a Tree is ever
dropping, which supplies the whole with water. There are extraordinary dews in
Egypt, where is no Rain; and in Peru, where also is none, a Wind that fans and
moistens. The watring of Egypt with the Nile, is miraculous. The flying Fishes
persecuted in the sea by the Dolphins, Boneta's, Albicores, and Sharkes, and so
compelled to use their finny wings, and take the Air to avoid them, afford a
meal to hungerbitten Birds, that look for them. And which is admirable and
surprising, the young Ravens, when abandoned and relinquisht by their Old ones
cry, and crying gape, and gaping receive the flies that skiffing up and down
the Air, (as if impuls'd to do so) direct their course into their mouths; and
so they are fed. Thus the Royal Psalmist, He gives to the Beasts their food,
and to the young Ravens which cry, [which cry] the Ravens cry, and then, and
thus he hears them. Dissection proves it true; their Ventricles are full of
Flies: the Ravens cry, and God hears, we must always ask, and sometimes cry,
if we will have.

SECT. 3.
2. In the Moral World, proved in the Law and Order of the House. An Objection
about the existence of Evil anticipated, Paenal and Afflictive Evils for man's
Good. How things are best for the Beasts. Evils as Entities, necessary for the
plenitude of the World; as Afflictive for Gods Glory; and as Paenal for Man's
good. Things ought to be as they are. An Objection from the Apparent ill
administration of things [Good to the Evil, Evil to the Good] proposed,

But in his Administration of the Government of the Moral World, (for so I call
that of Mankind, in distinction to the Natural,) his Providence and Goodness,
are as visible as great; in that all things in it are designed for the best,
and ultimately issue in it: Her rules in his House, in all things, as a wise
and prudent Master, by assigning to his Children and his Servants, their
respective duties (in it) which are for the Good of all in general, and each of
them in particular, as well as for his own Glory; and by obliging them unto
them with Rewards, and Punishments. Thus he Disciplines and Governes them.
Government is for the Good of Man, and all Government is from God. He holds the
reins of all himself, and he prescribes the Rules and Laws of it.

I ask the Atheist, if it would not be a Golden and most happy Age, wherein all
men loved others as entirely and sincerly as they do themselves: wherein
together with their own concernments, and interests all equally reminded those
of others; wherein they universally abstaining from all injustice and wrong,
each assisted other to the utmost; and wherein they lived and conversed each
with other devoid of Envy, Malice, Covetousness, Pride, Contention, etc. And if
he answer me it would; I tell him this is the Order of the House, that Law of
Nature, ( which is nothing else, but what the Practical and common Reason of
man does dictate to be done) that God has sanction'd in the world, to which he
has obliged all his Servants to conform; thus he will have them do, and thus
be; and that they may, he has adapted means (the best imaginable) to engage
and move them to it: He disciplines and acts them with Rewards and Punishments:
He promises them Good, if they obey, and threatens them with Evil, if they do
not. So the Apostle,

-- Do by Nature the things contained in the Law. -- Having not the Law, are a
Law unto themselves. -- Work of the Law written in their hearts, etc. -- Their
thoughts accusing, or excusing one another. And so Cicero. -- Nec, si regnante
Tarquinio nulla erat Romae scripta Lex de stupris, iccirco non contra illam
legem sempiternam Sex. Tarquinius vim Lucretiae Tricipitini filiae attulit.
Erat enim ratio profecta a rerum natura, and ad recte faciendum impellens, and
a delicto avocans: quae non tum denique incipit lex esse, cum scripta est, sed
tum cum orta est, orta autem simulest cum mente divina, quam ob rem lex vera
atque princeps, apta ad jubendum, and ad vetandum, ratio est recta summi Jovis,
etc. Cic. de leg. lib. 2.
-- Ergo est lex justorum, injustorumque distinctio, ad illam antiquissimam,
and rerum omnium principem expressa naturam, ad quam leges hominum diriguntur,
quae supplicio improbos afficiunt, and defendunt, and tuentur bonos, etc. Ibid.
-- Sit igitur hoc jam a principio persuasum civibus, dominos esse omnium rerum
ac moderatores does, eaque quae gerantur, eorum geri judicio, ac numine,
eosdemque optime de genere hominum merert, and quali^ quisque sit, quid agat,
quid in s^ admittat, qua mente, qua pietat^ religiones colat, intueri,
piorumque and impiorum habere rationem: hi^ enim rebus imbutae mentes, haud
sane abhorrebunt ab utili, and a vera sententia: etc. Ibid.


There must be Paenal and Afflictive Evils that there may be Punishments, as
well as there are Goods: agreeable obliging things for Compensations and
Rewards; it being very often very good for the Child, though he think not so,
that his Father take the Rod in hand; Crosses, Losses, Pains, and sinister
incounters are but Rods in God's. Now the means are good if the end be so.
Finis dat mediis amabilitatem, bonit atem etc. It is good for Man, there are
afflictive, paenal Evils: His Vices are Distempers, and these are Medicines to
cure them, and Wars themselves, are Punishments to Nations, as Diseases are to
single persons. No Government without Rewards and Punishments, no Rewards and
Punishments without Good and Evil.

And if it be best for Man it is so for the Beasts, and other Animals, and
other inferior Beings; Man is the End and Lord of these, and therefore [these
not having any interest of their own distinct, from his, because they are but
his, and not their own] That is best for them, which is so for him. The
Accessory follows the Principal. Now Man, he has an interest in these and so
is punishable in them; and is afflictable by these, and so is punishable by
them. Wherefore, the Good and Evil, that is in them, the poison and malignity
in Minerals and Plants; the venom, enmity, and violence, the fury and rapacity
in many Animals, as well as the commodity and usefulness of others; Tempests in
the Air; Convulsions in the Earth; the Fiery Eruptions of Aetna and Vesuvius,
and other such enormous, and irregular emotions of the Elements, as well as
regular and orderly, are not in them for themselves, but all for Man, Man is
their end, as God is Man's. Let not the Atheist complain. God is very Good and
Liberal to Man, who has so bountifully given all (these) things to him. Yea,
and he is good to the Beasts also, in that he has oblidged man to be so to
them.

But to be more distinct. If we reflect on all the things, are called Evils,
and consider them as things, and absolutely in themselves, so they have a good
of Entity or Being, and are necessary to the Universe, that it may be Uniform
full, and perfect. In the day of Prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
adversity consider: God also has set the one over against the other, to the
end, that Man should find nothing after him. (...) The Septuagint (...) The
Latin Interpreter, Et quidem istud congruum huic. Sym. (...). God has set
good over against Evil, and Evil over against Good, so to answer one another,
that Man coming after him, in review and observation of his works might not
find any thing wanting, or to be added. All is full and uniform and answering.
So Seneca,

-- Semper esse felicem, and sine morsu animi velle transire vitam, ignorare
est rerum naturae alteram paitem, etc. Senec. de Provid. cap. 4.
So Apuleius. -- Gramaticorum arts vide quaeso quam ex diversis collectae sint
literis, ex quibus aliae sunt insonae, semisonantes aliae, pars sonantes, hae
tamen mutuis se auxiliis adjuvantes syllabas pariunt, and de syllabis voces.
Hoc Her aclitus, etc.

So Porphyrie. -- (...), etc. Porphyr de antro Nym.


And if we consider them as dolorous and afflictive, so also they are necessary
in respect of God, that he may have a rise of showing his Beneficence and
Goodness, in its full extent: For, if there were no evils in the world, no
infelicities, necessities, nor miseries, there could be no compassions, nor no
evincements of his Tendernesses and Mercies in relieving, or removing them. He
could not show his readiness to Help, if there were no need of help; and
therefore he has sometimes hid himself behind the Curtain, even from his
dearest Children, that on his return on their cries, they may be more affected
with his kindness, and become more sensible of it, else there had been no
crying to God, nor help from him, nor thanks for it: See the 107 Psalm. For
where there are no Evils, it might be said of God, as is said of a virtuous
Man, by Seneca,

-- Magnus es vir, sed unde scio, si tibi fortuna non dat facultatem exhibendae
virtutis? etc. (...).
But, if we consider them as paenal Evils, so they have a mediate goodness, and
an usefulness for Man, that much obliges him, for so (as we have said) they are
as many Means to discipline and govern him; who, if he were not as he is, and
were not governed and Disciplined as he is, but had been fixed by an Act of
Power, without them, half the Show had then been lost. So much of the Divine
wisdom and goodness as is, visible in this conduct (which is very much) had
then been never shown, and so God had been deprived of a good part of his
Glory. His is (...), a manifold wisdom, and manifold Goodness. And manifold
wisdom must be shown in many ways, and not be limited to one.

Well ( says the Atheist) this is indeed a pretty color, but it is no more,
for the Government, if any, is not administered as you assert it; the Good and
Evil in the world, are not for the ends you mention, to discipline and order
it; these are too promiscuously dispensed, and too blindly, to be so for Ends;
it is rather to the contrary; the Good (if any difference) are most unhappy and
unfortunate, and the wicked, most successeful and prosperous. A Phenomenon, so
Plain and obvious that not only Telamon in Cicero,

Nam si current, been bonis sit, male malis: quod nune abest. Cic. de not.
Deor. lib. 3.
But also Solomon himself has noted it; no man ( says he) knows, either
love or hatred by all that is before him, all things come alike to all, there
is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked, etc. So undistinguishing and
common are the external accidents. And it is strange, if there be indeed a
Providence, that the Godly only should have the Promise of the present life,
but no more the performance of it, than the Wicked.

SECT. 4.
The Objection removed. (1.) By denying its Ground: for all is Good to the
Good, and Evil to the Evil. (2.) By settling this Rule. That Providence is not
to be understood but in the End. This illustrated by several Resemblances, and
by an Instance. The promiscuousness of Providence in events explained. External
things indifferent in their own Nature, and nor Good nor Evil. Seemingly
promiscuous Providence further vindicated, by several considerations. The false
measure of Good and Evil detected. A right one settled.

This Appearance, I acknowledge, has offended very many, and till he went into
the Sanctuary, and there observed the End, it scandalized David: But Seneca
has fully solved it, and so has Plutarch also, and Arrian's Epictetus, a
Triumvirate of worthy Authors, and let the Atheist read them. He is mistaken,
there is nothing Good in this Life to the Evil, and to the good and virtuous
nothing is amiss and bad. Trahit quisque in suum colorem. To the Pure all
things are Pure, The famous, but, etc. Story of the Angel, and unbelieving
Hermit (that which Bradwardine relates, if yet it be a History) abundantly
illustrates it. All things work together, in the End, for Good to one, and all
for Evil to the other. You must take a Providence entire and altogether, and
not in pieces and abroad, to make a Judgment on it. All is as the End is. That
is well, which ends well, and that is otherwise, which ends so. You must stay
the End to judge it; [the End of the Providence, and the End of the Man] Now
mark the Perfect man, and be hold the Upright, for the End of that Man is
peace, but the Transgressors shall be destroyed together, the End of the Wicked
shall be cut off. Two sorts of Men, and answerably two Ends; Heaven and Hell.

So Porphyrie out of Plato. -- (...).And again. -- (...)

The Providence of God is what Augustus thought it, (...). Suet^n in vit.
Octav. Aug^st.
a well composed Drama; wherein a man is so surpised and intricated with
Variety, that all along he cannot once imagine its design, until he come to the
End of it; and then he sees it clearly, how every Passage and adventure in the
whole most excellently contribute to it, and most orderly. And surely, he that
believes (and Religion obliges men to be believers) makes no haste; One must
await the End, to see the whole laid open. It is the excellency of a Work, to
have its main design so skilfully concealed, as to suspend Spectators, and to
lead them all about in a maze, until it all be finished. The Atheist looks but
to a part, when he should stay to see the whole; at least the whole piece. He
sees but the wrong side of the Arras, the thrums and ends of the threads, when
it is rolled up; the Beauty is in the right side, and he must stay the opening
to see it. It Is unreasonable to complain of that in Providence, which he calls
an Ornament, and which does make his greatest pleasure and delight in Plays
and Romances, viz. The interruption of the Story, and that suspense which is in
it. We must stay the end of all to see the Harmony of all, and the last day
will declare it; and we must stay the end of every piece of Providence, to make
a judgment on that.

But, to give a Scriptural instance in the History of Joseph (not to mention
that of Job or David,) what a mavelous surprise is in it! Take every passage
of it solely by it self, and separate it from the rest, and how hard a one it
is; all is then against him: To be hated by his brethren, that is bad; to be
sold by them for a Slave to the Ishmaelites, and by these to Potiphar is worse;
to be injuriously accused of his Mistress, and so condemned to perpetual
Prisonment, worst of all. All these are hard, and separately all against him;
but in concatenation and together, as one disposes and prepares for another,
so they all cooperate in the End to his preferment, and are all for him.

For it was by the Buttler whose Dream he had interpreted, that such a mention
was made in favor of him unto Pharaoh, as occasioned his Preferment. It was in
Prison he became acquainted with the Buttler, and interpreted his Dream; it was
his Mistress's Accusation, which composed his Mittimus, and hurried him to
Prison; it was the avarice and griping of the Ishmaelites, that brought him to
his Mistress; and it was the Malice and Envy of his Brethren, that brought him
to the Ishmaelites; and thus he comes to Preferment, and who would have thought
it thus? All work together, and in the End for Good. Such an Ordering and
overruling hand has God in all the evil actions of Men; when Joseph's Brethren
sell him into Egypt: God is said to send him. Humane Malice and Divine
Providence, may be together in the same act; wherein Men have an evil hand, God
has a good one; who brings Light out of Darkness, and turns Evil in the End to
Good. This for Particular Providence.

Hear Seneca. Senec. cur. (...)


-- Difficillimum ex omnilus quae proposui, videtur quod primum dixi: pro ipsis
esse quibus eveniunt, ista quae horremus, ac treminius. Pro ipsis est, inquis,
in exilium projici, in egestatem deduci, liberos, conjugem efferre, ignominia
affici, debilitari? Si miraris, hoc pro aliquo esse, miraberis quosdam ferro
and igne curari nec minus fame ae siti, Sed si cogitaveris tecum, remedii
causa, quibusdam and radi ossa and legi, and extrahi venas, and quaedam
amputari membra, quae sine totius pernicie corporis haerere non poterant: hoc
quoque patieris probari tibi, quaedam incommoda pro his esse, quibus accidunt:
tam me hercules, quam quaedam quae laudantur atque appetuntur, contra eos esse,
quos delect a verunt, simillim a cruditatibus, ebrietatibusque and caeteris
quae necant per voluptatem, etc. Once, it is the End of all (as we have
evidenced) that must open and unlock the Cabala, and Mystery of things at full;
and if it be, then certainly, in being so precipitate and hasty, as not to stay
it, to make a settled and established judgment, we as well betray an
exraordinary Ignorance, and Folly, as a like Temerity and Rashness. For though
there be a visible and apparent correspondency in some administrations, [Good
in the End of them to the Good, as to Job, to Joseph, to David; and Evil at the
furthest, in the End of them to the Evil, as in Adonibezek, Pherecydes Syrus,
Attila, etc.] That we may acknowledge the righteousness and justice, which does
rule the world; yet it is obscure and hid in many others, that we may also know
there is another day to come, that must more fully declare it. Some Men's sins
go before to judgment, and others follow after. So Job 21. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 30. ( the wicked) spend their Days in wealth, and in a moment go down
to the Grave. (But) He is reserved to the day of Destruction, they shall be
brought forth to the Day of wrath.

It was this consideration satisfied many thinking and inquisitive
Philosophers, about the seeming inaequality of things, who had otherwise been
foundred on the same Rock with Diagoras Melius, [One of them, that made at
first a great Profession of Religion and Piety, but did afterward abandon and
forsake it, utterly denying the Being, and Existance of God, because he saw not
speedy vengeance executed by him, on his perjured Friend, with whom he had
deposited his money, and who forswore it.] But those being thoroughly persuaded
of a Future day of judgment, and that there was a Minos, or a Radamanthos, or
an Aeacus, a righteous and severe Judge, who would accurately scan there in the
Lives and Actions of all men, and then accordingly retribute to them, as he
found upon research; They acquiesced in that, and so should we. For when things
are tried, the Heavens shall record that Righteousness of God. Hear the Grave
Plutarch.

-- (...) Plutarch de consolat. ad Apoll
SECT. 5.
Again, though all things for the Matter come alike to all, and so there is but
one event both to the Righteous and the Wicked, yet formally, and in respect of
Good and Evil, so they do not; the same event is sanctified to the one, which
is not to the other; so that to the one it is Good, and to the other Evil:
Fortune (as they call it) as well Adverse as Prosperous, it makes a Good man
better, and so is good to him; but a Bad man worse, and so to him it is Evil.

So Epictetus. -- (...) Epict in Enchirid. cap. 24.


Arrianus. -- (...) Arrian. Epict. lib. c. 6.


Seneca. -- Nihil accidere bono viro mali potest. Non miscentur contraria --

So Socrates. -- Nec enim cuiquam bono mali quidquam evenire potest, nec vivo,
nec mortuo: nec unquam ejus res a diis immortalibus negligentur. Nec mihi ipsi
hoc accidit fortuito, nec vere iis, a quibus accusatus sum, aut a quibus
condemnatus habeo quod succenseam, nisi quod mihi nocere se crediderunt. Orat.
ad Iudic. in Cicer. Tusc. Qu^st l.1.


Now Events Materially accepted, and as in themselves, so they are not marks
to judge by, either of the Love or Hatred, which Almighty God has for us, but
only Formally, as Good and Evil, as sanctified and unsanctisied; that is,
either as they are blessed to be Instruments or means of virtue, or else are
cursed, and so are Rises and occasions of vice; or else of greater temporal
Evils. Thus Solomon is understood. All come alike Materially, but not Formally.
And there is the wisdom, that when the Events are the same, the Good and Evil
are not. And thus it is.

For none of those external things the Atheist calls Goods or Evils, are in
themselves intrinsecally so, but being in themselves indifferent, are only
relatively Good or Evil; so as they are either used or abused by those that
have them; and as they prove in the end. Men's Tables may become snares, and out
of the Eater meat may come, and it is to show this, that God promiscuously
bestows them. So Seneca. -- Hoc est propositum Deo, quod sapienti viro,
ostendere haec quae vulgus appetit, quae reformidat, nec bona esse, nec mala.
Apparebunt autem bona esse, si illa non nisi bonis viris tribuerit, etc. Senec.

Again. -- Divitias nego bonum esse: nam si essent, bonos facerent. Senec de
vit. beat. cap. 24. Vide Arrian. in Epict. suo. lib. 4. cap. 6. per totum.


All Goodness, it consists in relation and convenience; things are only
good, so far as suitable and proper, (and) those are Evil which are otherwise:
what is one Man's meat, it is another poison; and what is good in one
circumstance is not always so, but it is often very evil in another; and what
seems temporally Good, as also Evil, for the present, may in the End prove
contrary; and often does; we daily see it. Quod videtur non est.

Wherefore, if God denies his Children or Servants what the Atheist thinks
good for them, (because it seems so) or else inflicteth on them what the
Atheist apprehends Evil; he does the former because he sees, and he sees
furthest and clearest, that indeed it is not good; and so he does the latter,
either to procure them greater Good, or for preventing greater Evil. Arrianus
saw this. -- (...) Arrian. Epict. lib 4. cap. 7.
and this consideration justifies God.

For as a Father who corrects his child, but to mend him, or who refuses to him
a knife, wherewith he sees he will cut his Fingers; or who abstructs a
marriage that seems advantageous to his Son, which (he foresees) in the End
will prove his Ruin; He loses not the Reputation of a Good or Kind Father, but
acquireth to it that of wise; so also it is with God, God is a Good Father, and
if he afflict, it is (if need be) but to embetter and improve his Children; or
if he refuse them what they apprehend to be obliging, and Good, it is because
indeed it is not so; it would be ruinous (if he should grant it) or detrimental
at the least, to their eternal, or else their temporal State. They would lose
in Goods of the mind, and in their Spiritual Comforts, what they gain in these
of the body, or the like.

Nor has he absolutely promised Health, or Riches, or Honor, or any one
External thing, but all as far as they conferr (to us) [ no Good thing will he
withhold;] and it is Good he has not absolutely promised any: seeing as the case
may be, they all may turn to hurt. There is a sore Evil which I have seen under
the Sun, Senec. de Pro. id. c. 3.
namely Riches kept for the Owners thereof to their hurt. And there is a time
wherein one man rules over another to his own hurt.



So Seneca.

-- Mala pro bonis petenti periculosum est assequi. Senec. de vit. beat. cap.

SECT. 6.
And here it ought to be remarked, that a great occasion of mistake in this
matter, is the impertinent judgment, which is made of Good and Evil by Sense;
to reform which, we must consider that Sense is not the sole and proper Measure
of them; there is indeed a Sensitive, but this is but an Animal, an inferior
Good or Evil; there is a Higher, a more exalted and Superior, which is the
Rational and Humane. It is the Rational Appetite, and not the Sensitive, that
is the Measure of Good and Evil among men, that will not sink themselves to the
Beasts. To man there are better Goods than the Sensitive, and worse Evils.
These of Reason, are as much Superior unto them of Sense, as men themselves to
Beasts. Wherefore, he is no gainer, that gets but sensitive Good, by the loss
of Rational. So Seneca. -- Altum quiddam est Virtus, ex celsum, regale,
invictum, infatigabile: voluptas humile, servile, imbecillum, caducum, cujus
statio ac domicilium fornices and propinae sunt. Sen. de vit. beat. cap. 7.
-- Quid mihi voluptatem nominas? Hominis bonum quaero, non ventris, qui
pecudibus ac beluis laxior est. cap. 9.


And if a Father try his Son, or exercise his virtue: and refuse to gratify
him in a small and petty Boon, but to see how he will take it; resolving if he
take it well, to recompense him with a greater, what injury is done the Child?
or what unkindness can the Atheist find in the Father? And this is the Case.
For no Believer is a loser by his Crosses, seeing if he bear them well, his
light afflictions, which are but for a moment, work out for him a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of Glory. Now a Poet brings not his Hero to his
utmost Felicity, but in the conclusion, after he has made him give a thousand
proofs of his virtue, and has made him pass a thousand difficulties. We must
be at pains for heaven; many shall seek, and shall not enter; we must strive if
we will enter. Heaven is taken by violence. Remember the Olympic Exercises. The
Apostle alludes to them; So run, as you may obtain. Strive lawfully, etc.

SECT. 7.
The Genesis of Man and Things, the best Apology for Providence, against the
cavils of the Atheist; and a great instance of Divine Benignity. The Atheists
(1.) Objection, That God did not fix and settle Adam in it, fully answered and
exposed as irrational. (2.) Objection, The Iniquity of God and Providence in
concluding all men under misery, for the Sin of One: This removed and the
righteousness of God asserted and vindicated.

But what does most illustriously set off the Goodness and Benignity of God
beyond exception, is this consideration, that Man was in his first Condition,
made both Innocent and Happy; placed by Divine Bounty in a Garden most
delicious, and as free from all trouble, as he was from sin; he had as many
Servitours obsequious to his will, while he was so to God's, as there were
Creatures; nor had he any Cross Incounters or Displeasures then. And if he have
occasion to complain now of any alteration made in it, (as it cannot be denied,
but indeed he has) it must be of himself, who if he be no longer Happy, it is
because he is no longer Innocent, but having first revolted from his Maker, all
the Creatures now revolt from him. The very ground is Cursed, and he is made to
see his Folly and his Sin together, in the Punishment of it. But, from the
beginning it was not so. Death and Curse came in by Sin. Cursed is the Ground
for thy sake, in sorrow shall thou eat, etc. Many Heathens saw this, That of
Homer is Pertinent. (...).

Ac praeter fatum cumulant sibi cord dolores.

And Hesiod in his (...), describing the Golden Age, does evidently represent
the State of Man in Paradise. (...).
(...)
(...).


Wherein also the famous Ovid admirably imitates him; and what other is his
Story of Pandora, than an Allusion to the Fall of Man, which was occasioned by
a Woman.

It may be Plato and Timaeus had regard to Genesis, when they asserted nothing
mortal was immediately created; for nothing was at first made so; unless you
will be subtle, and distinguish accurately, by affirming that the things
created, were at first Mortalia, though they were not Moritura; and be it so,
yet Death came in by Sin, and so, it could not be before it; which is as much
as (probably) they meant, or we would have them to.

But if they meant it not in that, it is as evident as Light it self, they did
in Pr^-existence; [a Theory obtaining over all the World] This being nothing
but a Depravation of the History of Adams Fall and his Exilement on it out of
Paradise. This is Plato his descent of Souls. Which whosoever shall peruse
Hierocles his account thereof, a person that could well give it, must needs as
soon acknowledge, as he shall consider. And in regard it is important to
demonstrate this Truth, as well against a knot of Learned men, that understand
it in the Letter, as for the present purpose, I shall here allege Hierocles in
his own terms, and at large, Hierocl. in carm. Py. thag.
-- (...) (...) -- (...).

A Pregnant Testimony. Here Is a Fall, and of Man, and for Sin. Ate is from
(...) Peccare. God made Man Upright, but he found out many inventions. This is
Plato's Descent of Souls.

But if God be infinitely Good and Pure, and Righteous, (replies the Atheist)
how is it, that he did not settle Adam in his Innocence and Happiness? What
salvo has he for his own Righteousness, who so unmercifully suffered man to
slide from His? Is he not an Accessory to the Crime, who (when he could
prevent) permits it? He that does not hinder Murder, or other wickedness, when
it is in his Power so to do, is to be interpreted in all reason, to will it. God
could have hindered Adam's. What say you therefore since he did not? How can
you call him good and charitable, that would not prevent such misery? and how
Righteous and Holy, that did permit such sin?

But seeing nothing gives but what it has it self, must not he be Holy, Pure,
and Righteous, that Formed man so? and he Good, that so abundantly accommodated
man, and freely furnished him with all conveniences and Comforts? Now God not
only most Benignly created Man in Innocence and Happiness, but obligingly
conferred also to Establish him and fix him in it. He ordained him a Tree of
Life [and Adam might have eaten of it, if he would himself, as well as of the
other of knowledge.] Nor was it proper that he should do more toward it. It was
not congruous and fit, he should determine arbitrary and spontaneous Agents,
(and let the Atheist Judge) as he had done the Natural: nor agreeable that Man,
an Agent ad utrum-libet, one that could deliberate and act on choice, that
could freely and electively incline to both extremes, should be determined, as
a Stone to one of them. It was fit elective Creatures should be left to their
choice; and so was Man. A Tree of Life, and a Tree of knowledge [Life and
Death] were both before him, and he might take his choice. Verily, God is
irrationally charged (and let Arrianus in his Epictetus judge) (...)
for not designing a perpetual happiness unto a Rational and knowing Creature,
in a way that was not agreeable to Reason, as sure he must, if he had settled
and established a willing, a free, an arbitrary, and elective Creature, in a
State against his will, or without it. Nothing wanted but man's will, to make
his happiness eternal. The Tree of Life was before him, and he might have
eaten, and so have lived for ever, if he would, the very Angels themselves in
Heaven were left to their choice; and reason good says Hierocles. -- (...) --
Hierocl. in Carm. Pythag.


For if the great God should have restrained Adam phisically and forcibly, and
not morally only (as he did) and by a Law, from eating of the one Tree, or
else should violently have compelled him (as now the Atheist does require) to
pluck and eat of the other; as he had not congruously treated Adam, in the
Notion of a Free and Arbitrary Agent, so neither had he tried what he would do
of himself. Besides, there had not then been any need of Law, for as much as it
had been impertinent, to interdict eating to one, that could not possibly eat;
and then if no Law, there had been no obedience neither, and consequently no
Reward nor Punishment; and if no Law, no Obedience, no Reward nor Punishment,
then no Government neither, and then in vain had Adam, in the very constitution
of his Nature, been a governable Creature, seeing (if this had been) he were
never to be actually governed. Natural Agents are not (properly) governed, but
Moral Ones, and Moral Agents must be governed Morally. Hear Arrianus. -- (...)
(...) Arrian. Epict. lib. 1 c. 6.


Nor is God obliged in the Notion of Good or Righteous Governor, violently to
restrain the Governed from all unrighteousness, or to promote their weal and
Good violently; that is not for a Governor (as such) to do; and therefore that
God did not, is not in derogation of his Purity or Goodness. A Governor
restrains Evil, and advances Good, not by tying men's hands, but by enacting
good Laws; by enforcing them with Menaces and Threats, and with Rewards and
Compensations; by executing penalties on those that break them, and by
renumerating those that do not. And though a Subject be an Accessory to the
Crime, and Evil which he does not hinder, if he can, and be interpreted to will
it, if he do not do his natural utmost to prevent it, because he is obliged by
a Law to do so; yet the Governor that makes Law, [he being under none, but
that of Equity and Fitness, which is to rule by Law, and as a Governour] is not
accusable of Crimes, which he forbids and Punishes. He is a good Governor,
that makes good Laws, and rules by them, and not by force.

But grant it ( says the Atheist) that it was Divine Bounty to create Adam in a
state of Happiness, and no omission, not to establish him, and fix him in it;
but what equality in this, not to say what injury, that when but One was in
the Sin and guilt, he yet concludes all men in the Punishment; as if, because
the Parents eat the sour grapes, the Childrens teeth must be on edge. Euripides
complaint is just here -- (...) Plutarch. de iis qui car^a Number. corrip


I answer, There is no iniquity at all, in imputing unto all the sin of One,
when you consider that that One was All; and those All are One. Adam was the
whole kind; and All descendants from him, are but One Adam. Many members make
but One whole. Mankind is a Tree, whose Root is Adam, all whose Children are
but Branches, which deriving from him, and proceeding out of him, were at first
in him, and so they all were; and when he sinned, not one of them but was; All
were yet unborn, which must be minded.

And what makes this consideration of the greater moment, is another, that Eve
herself came out of Adam; so that Adam was entirely All; All are come from Adam
and Eve, and Eve herself from Adam. Had there been Non Adamites, or Non entire
Descendants from Adam, such as Jesus Christ, who was begotten of the Holy
Spirit, it had not seemed reasonable, that the Sin of Adam, should be imputed
to them. But seeing Mankind is an Extended Adam, and as it were, but one
suppositum; and Actions are of supposites; though it were but He, the Root that
sinned (actually) the Guilt is yet imputed to the Branches, which were in him;
it not being thought unreasonable, that he which steals, or else Assassinates
but with his hand, should yet be hanged for it by the Neck. All are concluded
with him, being All included in him. And therefore Adams fall, is called the
Fall of Man.

This is a Scriptural ground (...) and so agreeable to Reason that the Light of
Nature shows it; for (beside the use of Men, wherein the whole blood is looked
on as tainted, if but the Father be a Traitor, and wherein nothing is more
common, than for Parents to covenant for Children, etc.) Plutarch speaks
home. -- (...)

Again, if Adam had not lapsed, then all Descendants from him had been
possessed of the Happiness which be enjoyed

, and so had stood with him, and the Atheist holds not that unreasonable; and
if it be not so, that he should stand, it cannot be so, he should fall for his
Children; since it is but reason, that, if Children may be benefited and
advantaged by their Parents, they may be also disadvantag'd and disserv'd in
them. Qui sentit commodum, sentiet incommodum. Plutarch thought so. (...).

Finally though all have Sinned in Adam, and so have Misery and Punishment
entailed upon them, yet that misery and Punishment is not so great, but that
there is a greater mixture of Clemency and Mercy in it; the Life is left them
with entailment of calamity upon it, is yet such as they are loath to part
with; and they are favored in it, with opportunities of making their condition
better than at first it was, by playing an after Game, Thus the Fall is made to
be good for them, since they have a rise to get by it: and hear Plutarch. --
(...)

SECT. 8.
Divine Benignity and Goodness illustrated in his relieving Acts of Grace. Man
gets by the Fall. Why his First State, though Good, was not best.

Well then God is Good; yes so infinitely Good and Bountiful, that, though man
had miserably bankrupt, and fooled all he had away; yet has he of his own alone
immense Goodness and Charity, so stupendiously repaired him again, with such a
new Stock in Jesus Christ, that if he be not infinitely wanting to himself, as
well as to his Master, he may be made for ever by his breaking. God so [so]
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believed in
him should not perish, but have everlasting life, Everlasting Life.

Thus, Humane condition, it is capable of being bettered by the Fall, it being
in the kind of Man by Grace, as it is in other kinds by Nature, he rises by his
Fall; the Corn is not quickened nor multiplied, except it die; Man was not to
be quickened by the Lord from Heaven, nor advanced from a natural into a better
State of Spiritual, and Immortal Life, but after he was Spiritually dead. You
who were dead in trespasses and sins, has he quickened.

The Natural condition of the Man was Good in Paradise, and as good as that
could be, but his Spiritual is better, and it was agreeable unto the Law and
Method of Nature, that what was good should precede, and what was better follow
after; it being Nature's order, to proceed from things less Perfect, unto
things more so. For in the Genesis of things (if you consult it) it was first
Evening, then Morning; first Darkness, then Light; first the Naturals were
made, then the Vegetables; first the Animals, then the Rationals; and it is to
this that our Apostle alludes; The first man Adam was made a living Soul, the
last Adam was made a quickening Spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is
Spiritual: but that which is natural, and afterward that which is Spiritual.
The first man is of the earth Earthy. The second Man is the Lord from Heaven.
Thus is Man's Condition bettered, in that now, Divine Grace is brought by Jesus
Christ.

SECT. 9.
The Atheists Objection of impossible conditions, and of Reprobation destroyed,
Gods Universal love evinced, Election, and Reprobation explained. Reprobation
in a comparative sense vindicated. The Terms of Grace, Practicable. Humane
Impotency Moral, not Physical.

Yes ( says the Atheist) so it looks; for if he do extend his Grace (as he is
said) to men, it is on Terms, so insupportable and hard, that they cannot
possibly perform them; as if impossible conditions did not nullify his grants,
and make his Promises Denials; but that it were in his Law, as Lawers tells us
it is in ours, wherein a Promise on Impossible Conditions, does immediately
invest in Right. What Grace is this to look for tales of Bricks, without
affording Straw? He bids us come inded (but when be knows we cannot) and then
he tells us, we shall have. And is not this a great Evincement of Benignity, and
love to Mankind, is it not? that he has made the greatest part thereof to
damn it? what means Reprobation else?

A most malicious imputation this! For as Plutarch. -- (...) Plutarch. in
Platonic. Question.


God has not made a man to damn him; he has an universal (though not an equal
Love) for all the Kind: and has given ample demonstrations of it in his Son:
who assumed not the Person, but the Nature; He so loved the world, that he gave
his only begotten Son, etc. God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the
world, but that the world through him might be saved.

What Evidences are there of his Pleasure ( let me see but one of it) that the
wicked die? when there are so many of his will (that) he should return from his
wicked ways, and live! Does he not invite all? Does he not beseech, and call
all? [ Ho every one that thirsts, etc.] Does he not afford sufficient means,
and send his Ministers and Word to All? Is there not an universal Act of
Amnesty, without a Man excepted, so he will come in? yes verily the Apostles
were obliged to go to all the world, and preach the Gospel to every Creature.

And that very Reprobation, which is so great a scandal and offense unto the
Atheist, only because he has no right understanding and resentment of it, what
is it but a lesser love? It may not be interpreted in a positive and simple
sense, but only in a comparative, as not impor^ing a simple Aversation or
Hatred, but a less intense love. So that as they are called Chosen or Elect,
whom he especially favors, so these are Reprobate or hated, whom he does only
generally love, but does not specially favor. It was thus he Reprobated Esau,
or hated him before his doing Good or Evil, not in a positive and simple, but
in a comparative sense; he loved him not in that degree he loved Jacob, with
that especial and distinguishing love. And so comparatively he is said to hate
him; just as Jesus Christ affirms them to hate Father and Mother. who love
them eminently less then him, So Scriptural a Notion this is of Hatred.

Now to apply it; What if God, who has a general and common love to all (which
he has evinced in a thousand ways, by his creating, his conserving, his
providing for them in the present life, and by capacitating of them for a
better end) have yet so special and distinguishing an one for others, that in
respect thereof the former is as none? Is he the less Good, or less Benign,
because he is so much so? or must it be interpreted a want of Goodness or
Benignity to some, because he is abundant in it to others? as if it were not
Righteous for the Great God to have his Favorites, when yet it is allowed and
approved in men to have them. God does but generally love some, to show his
Power; and he specially does favor others, to show his Rich Grace. Had he
loved all a like, it would not look of Grace to any. Grace is Favor, and
Favor is particular, and distinguishing. Nor had he shown his power, if he
had not passed some by, when he obliged others with Favors.

So infinitely Good is God; that the veryest Reprobate in all the world, has no
occasion of a just complant against him; He is as good as Sovereign, and to
manifest himself so, he has in all Transactions so admirably tempered Love and
Power, that if he is Soveraignly Gracious in some of them, He is in others as
Benignly Sovereign: though he Favors some and not others, and that because he
will, yet he has an universal love and general kindness for them all. Those
that are not Favorites are yet considered as his Subjects, he wills their
Repentance, and as a Governor endeavors it; for though he use his Power and
Dominion, that he might show his indignation against Sin, as well as his
aversion, yet it only is on such he has first endured with much long
suffering, who by aggravated guilt, have merited destruction, and so have
fitted and prepared themselves for it, and now, is God Evil or Unrighteous? if
you state it thus; and so Scripture states it, keep to these Terms, and
Reprobation is defensible.

Nor is God a hard Master; he requires not impossibilities, or Tales of Brick
without Straw; for, though he might consider man in great Justice, not as he
has made himself, but as he was made at first, and so agreably expect from him
according to the Stock, which then was given him; yet He has condescended to
compound, and by an Act of Grace, as infinite as is himself, has offered
bankrupt Adam New Terms, and such as are agreeable unto him now in this
Condition, and feasible. I say now, for otherwise indeed Impossible Conditions
(as Logicians tell us) were refusals; or if, as many say, the Terms offered
unto Man, were bottomed on Aestimates that are not, and on consideration of a
Stock at first given, but which is no longer, they were not gracious and
relieving, and consequently could not be intended to oblige Man anew, since his
contracted inability; but to upbraid him and reproach him with it.)

No, God requires nothing of a Man [not in the Covenant of Grace] but what
substantially is natural; and let the Athiest or any other otherwise persuaded,
instance but in one required Act to the contrary; to believe, to repent, to
love, etc. Are Acts substantially within the compass of the Humane Nature, and
which one exercises every day; He believes some reports, and he Repents some
Follies, he loves his Friend, etc. and God obliges him but to Believe and
Credit him, to repent of Follies practiced against him, and to affect and love
him, as his Friend and Benefactor, the Acts substantially are the same, though
the determinations of the Acts are not, their Moral Principles and Objects
differ.

And, that Inability, or Impotency of humane will, which occasions so great a
noise and murmur, is not to be understood as if there were not in it Natural
Liberty; the Will of Man Essentially is free, and Lady of her own actions, and
its adaequate and proper object, Good; It is not Natural but Moral impotence,
an inability in the Will of willing Spiritual Good, through a prepossession of
it, with such resistent Habits, with Love of the World, and with Lust, as being
enmity to God, and all Divine Good, do so powerfully chain her unto one
extreme, that she is not capable as long as she is under them, of inclining to
the other. An irregenerate and unconverted man, he has the Faculty of willing,
though not the exercise. [ Voluntatem habet, non velle.] As one may have the
Visive Power in the dark, though he cannot see, but in the Light. Potentiam
habet, sed non Posse, and the Faculty of willing, Man has, because he has the
Faculty of Nilling. [ and Ejus est velle cujus est nolle.] Boethius proves it.
Animadverto inquit, idque uti tu dicis it a esse consentio. Sed in hac
haerentium sibi serie causarum, estne ulla nostri arbitrii libertas, an ipsos
quoque humanorum motus animorum fatalis catena constringit. Phi. est inquit,
neque enim fuerit ulla rationalis natura quin eidem libertas adsit arbitrii,
etc. Boet. lib. 1 Pros. ^.


So that its impotency is but vicious and habitual, such an One as in Truants,
that say they cannot learn, or in Prejudiced Persons, that say they cannot
love, and indeed but very hardly can, as long as they are so; both which
experience in themselves, something rising and reluctant at the thoughts of
Love and Learning; and so do wicked Men, who all are Truants and Prejudiced
with the Love of the World, and of Lust, they have Reluctancies arising in
them, at the thoughts of God, and of all true Goodness. Intus exhistens
prohibet alienum. You must cure their prejudices to convert them.

SECT. 10.
The Atheists Reply of Terms still impossible, though but morally so, removed.
Man's Power, but by Gods Grace, explicated, asserted. The cures of the withered
Arm, and of the Impotent man at Bethesda, Emblematical. Their Application.

Well, But call it Moral or Habitual impotency ( says the Atheist) and render
it as culpable and faulty as you can, yet, seeing it is such as Grace did find
him in, it reflects as ill on that, if it be invincible and obstinate, as if it
were a Physical and Simple one, what Grace is in the Terms, which neither do
consider, nor relieve necessities; which oblige a man to things impossible unto
him; and which exact a Victory and Conquest over prejudices that are
inveterate, and Reigning, and that it is known, a man himself can never
overcome, or vanquish? We are asserted dead in Trespasses and Sins; that we can
do nothing of our selves: the natural Man discerns not the things of God;
neither indeed can he, etc.

Then hear again, O Atheist, and admire, and never open more against Divine
Goodness, which is much above the contradiction of the Wicked, as the Heavens
themselves above the Earth; and herein see it, that in the Covenant of Grace,
the Great God requires nothing of a Man, but what he offers him his Help for,
[in me is thy Help] which he conferreth on him in the way of Duty and
Dependence. So that nothing is exacted as a Term, but what a man is able and
sufficient to perform, not from any Power in himself, but by the help of God,
who, by way of caution, (for the greater security of it) now keeps the whole
Stock, entirely and solely in his own hand, seeing Man has bankrupt once
already with it, when it was in his, and it is his Goodness to keep it for us.
Now every Man can do with God's help, what every Saint does do; Nothing without
it, All with it. Not that we are sufficient of our selves to do any thing, as
of our selves. A Sufficiency there is, but not of our selves; our Sufficiency
is of God, it is not in him that wills, that he wills; nor in him that
runs, that he runs; but in God that shows mercy, who gives both to
will and to do of his own good pleasure. Man can do nothing of himself, that no
Flesh might glory; but with God's Help, he can do every thing, that he that
glories, might Glory in the Lord. And men may have God's help, if they will;
it is but ask, and have. But God must help, and therefore says Pythagoras. --
(...) -- Hierocl. in Carm. Pythag.


And Hierocles on him. (...)

And Plutarch. -- (...) Plutarch. C. Marc. Coriolanus.
and God will help if Men will try. So Aeschylus. -- (...)

This Concernment and Transaction of Almighty God with men is admirably
represented in the Method of Jesus Christ used when he cured the Impotent and
Lame; For Instance, when he cured the withered hand; which he did, by bidding
him that had it, stretch it out: and so that other impotent and maimed man, at
Bethesda, who could hardly stir his hand or foot; by bidding him take up his
bed and walk.

One would have thought he had but mocked, to bid the withered arm be extended,
or the Impotent to take his bed and walk; to bid them go that had no legs; but
they believed him to be serious, and that he was able to enable them, and
therefore tried and in trying found ability come in. And so it is with us, we
are unable in our selves for all the duties he obliges to, we are bid to
stretch our withered arms out, to believe, to love, to obey him spiritually,
and (as it were) to take up our beds and walk, when we are impotent and lame;
but yet on such a trying he enables us; virtue comes in with our obedience, if
we believe. It is not means but Gods blessing. And your Endeavors are to be in
Gods name, and not in your own. Many have endeavored in their own strength,
and fallen short; you must try in Gods, and so you can do every thing. You say
you cannot come, when God obliges you; but pray try. Cannot you pray, cannot you
hear (the Word) cannot you read? etc. Try in Gods Name. Do what you can. If men
will not try, when God says he will help; it is of perverseness, and not of
impotence, that they do not come. Love offers help to all, but Grace gives help
to some. All may have it if they will, but some shall will to have it. If any
be lost it is of their own Wills, but if any be saved, it is long of God's. God
is willing indeed (as General Rector) (that all should be saved, but he does
not will, or decree (as a special Father) that all shall be saved.

SECT. 11.
A foolish Objection from the immaturity, and imperfection of the Divine Life
here proposed, and the Vanity of it detected.

But may the Atheist say, what need so much ado then, for man to pray, and
hear, and read, and meditate, and try, if God do all? And why is the Life of
God in men so long imperfect, when if he were good, he would, and, if he would,
he could at once immediately accomplish it? why does he let them creep, whom he
could make to fly, and so defer that utmost happiness and perfection, which he
is said to ordain them to, when, if he would, he might as soon possess them of
it, as design it.

I answer, There are means as well as ends, and wisdom lies in suting them;
the Atheist might as well require, that every thing in Nature should
immediately, without an orderly progression and advancemen, arrive unto
perfection, that there should immediately be Trees, without seeds* and growing,
and those immediately should bear fruit, without blossoming before; as what he
does. For, as it is in other kinds, so it is in Mankind, both as to his
Naturals and Morals, he must orderly advance, and grow in use of means, from an
imperfect, immature, unripe estate unto a perfect, and mature. The Newman has
Ages, as the Natural. God is uniform in his works: Grace has its orderly
advancements and Progressions, as well as Nature. We must Grow in Grace, toward
the measure of the Stature, as we do in Nature. We are born Infants and not Men.

SECT. 12.
A brief transition toward, a Conclusion on this Head. The excellency of Divine
Goodness; it makes God most lovely, and is the Ground of all Devotion.

Thus (as I was capable) I have explained and asserted the Divine Bonity, and
also the Bounty, and Beneficence of God, which is, his most (1.) illustrious
Attribute, and that which makes him most Dear, most amiable, and most
desirable to men, and which is the (2.) ligament and Bond of all Devotion to
him. For so Cicero. -- (1.) Ipse Jupiter, id est juvans pater, quem conversis
casibus appellamus a juvando Jovem, a poetis pater divumque hominumque dicitur,
a majoribus autem nostris, optimus maximus, and quidem ante optimus id est,
beneficentissimus, quam maximus: quia majus est, certeque gratius prodesse
omnibus, quam opes magnas habere, etc. Cicer de not deor. lib. 2.
-- Quid est melius, aut quid praestantius bonitate and beneficentia? qua cum
carere deum vultis, neminem deo, nec deum, nec hominem carum, neminem ab eo
amari, neminem diligi vultis. Cic. de not Deor. lib. 1
-- (2.) Quae porro pietas ei debetur, a quo nihil acceperis? aut quid omnino,
cujus nullum meritum sit, ei deberi potest? Est enim pietas, justitia adversum
deos: cum quibus quid potest nobis esse juris, cum homini nulla cum deo sit
communitas? sanctitas autem est scientia colendorum deorum: qui quamobrem
colendi sint, non intelligo, nullo nec accepto ab iis, nec sperato bono. Ibid.


And there is nothing can administer to Men, in all their fluctuations and
perplexities, a greater Consolation, than this consideration, that the World
has a Governor, and him a good one; Apul. de Mundo.
that the Ship is not without a Pilot, nor nor the House without a Master; but
that every thing is ordered as well by infinite, and careful, and supreme
Goodness, as by most excellent wisdom. So Arrianus. -- (...) Arrian. Epict.
lib. 1. cap. 7.

SECT. 13.
First Corollarary. Nothing so indecent, and unbecoming for men, nor so
dishonorable to God, as superstitious Fears and Scruples. Several
considerations to evince it.

And being so. (1.) There is nothing more undecent and unbecoming for men, nor
more dishonorable, as well as more ungrateful to Divine Goodness, than
superstitious Scruples, Fars, Distrusts, and Apprehensions of God; as if he
were a Mean and Low Being, whom insignificant and little things could either
irritate or please: as if he did not know, or not consider, that we are but
flesh; but that he weighed us in a Balance, as by grains and scruples; or that
he were inexorable, hard, and rigid. In a word, as if He were not an infinitely
excellent perfect Being; [the Best] but had a Composition in his Temper, of
somewhat Little, Small, Evil, and Weak. No, God looks to the Heart, and so
thou be sincere, it is enough. [But don't mistake Sincerity.] He accepts not
according to what a Man has not, but according to what he has. Mind the great
Duties, and Perfections of the Humane Life, and of the Divine; and know
assuredly, that God will wink at unavoidable infirmities, in thy discharging of
them. Take heed of Diffidence, and Slavish Fears; and know it more obliging to
the Great God to Love him cordially, than to Fear him servilely, for it is
Love, and not Fear, that has the honor to fulfill the whole Law; and let the
Scrupulous consider it.

Once, a Melancholy, Scrupulous, Unchearful, and Fearful, it is a Miserable
and Forlorn Life.

.

So Plutarch. -- (...) (...) Plutarch. de superstit.
and, it also is a thing that makes a Christian as utterly unlike to Jesus
Christ, as any thing can be; He, came eating and drinking, in a complacent and
cheerful fashion, and not as John the Baptist, with a hair Coat and Leathern
Girdle. And it is utterly improper to the Gospel State, in which he is, He is
not under the Law, but under Grace: Jesus Christ is come on purpose, to bring
Life, and Immortality to Light; to let him understand the infinite, and
inexpressible Good will of God the Father; and to acquaint him with those
eternal motions in the Heart of God in his Favor, that God is willing to adopt
him. And this good News should make him to rejoice. A little should not cloud
his joys. The Apostle bids us rejoice, and again rejoice, that we may perform
Duties cheerfully. God loves a cherful Giver.

So Porphyrie. -- (...) Porphyr de Abstinent. lib. 2.


Believe it all our Melancholy, Fear, and Apprehension, saving only so much
of it, as is constitutional, proceeds from our ignorance of God, and of the
Gospel liberty we are redeemed into, that we don't consider (and perhaps
distemper will not let us) that we have not now received the Spirit of Bondage
[that Spirit of the Law] again to Fear, but the Spirit of adoption, [that
Evangelical and Gospel Spirit] by which we invocate one God as our Father. For
we are not come unto the Mount that might be touched, and that burned with
Fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest. And the sound of a
Trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice they that heard, entreated, that
the Word should not be spoken to them any more. (For they could not endure that
which was commanded: and if so much as a Beast touch the Mountain, it shall be
stoned, or thrust through with a dart. And so terrible was the sight, that
Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake.) But we are come to Mount Sion, and
unto the City of the Living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
company of Angels. To the General Assembly and Church of the First born, which
are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Just
men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the
blood of Sprinckling, that speaks better things than that of Abel.

But this is not said to encourage any in their insolent Affronts, or
Provocations of God. Shall Sin abound because Grace has abounded? God forbid.
The Goodness, Patience, Long-suffering, and Forbearance of Almighty God, where
there is any Ingenuity, to take a right Impression, and Resentment of it,
Leads to Repentance. Such as take encouragement (for none is given them) to
do evil, because they know that God is good, have reason to consider, that
there is Mercy with him, but not that he may be presumed on, but Feared. That
he is Maximus as well as Optimus; That he is Judge of all the Earth, and will
as surely right himself as others; that he wants not Ability, if once he have
the will to A^enge. And finally that Despised Bonity and Patience, will at last
convert to Fury.

SECT. 14.
Second Corolary. Nothing so Decent and becoming for Men, nor so obliging to
God, as Confidence in him, as adoring and glorifying of him. To glorify God
what. (...) in Psalm 150. What it imports.

Wherefore (2.) It is most Decent and becoming for Men, who are obliged of God,
and know him to be God, to acknowledge it in Prayer to him, in dependence on
him, in confidence in him, and in Praises of him. For to Believe, Pray, and
Trust, it is the Work of Earth; and to Admire, Adore, and Praise, it is the
work of Heaven, but to be begun on Earth; It Is all the Retribution that
Almighty God requires, that he be blessed for his blessings, which he then is,
when we return with his blessings, and really (as well as verbally) acknowledge
them unto him, that they are effects of his alone Bounty, that all derive from
him, Pausan. in Arcad.
and that he is the Origin and source of all. Bonus Deus had a Temple among the
Megalopolitans. We must Pray, and Praise.

Praise is comely.

So Porphyrie. (...) Porphyr. de Abstinent. l. 2. Sect. 24.


So Pythagoras in Iamblicus. -- (...) Iamblic. in vit. Pythag.


For this shall every one, that is Godly Pray.

So also Pythagoras in Iamblicus. -- (...) Ibid.


But it ought to be remembered, that he that Praises, glorifieth God, more than
he that Prays, for as much as he that prays, but hops that he will be
Good, but he that praises does acknowledge (that) He is so; and therefore, we
ought not to be more in application and address to God, by way of Supplication
and Petition, than of Acknowledgement and Praise; which yet, as gross a Piece
of Inequality as it is, we all are subject to* who are very often infinitely
more concerned, and zealous in our Prayers, than in our giving of thanks. It is
because, our Prayers are for our selves, but giving thanks is to God.

We have the Psalmist for a great. Example of our Duty; how many Psalms has he
composed all of Praise? the 145. 146. 147. 148. 149. and in fine, 150. are all
Laudatory. Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his Sanctuary, Praise him in the
Firmament of his Power. Praise him for his mighty Acts: Praise him according to
his Excellent Greatness. Praise him with the sound of the Trumpet, etc. And let
every thing that has breath, praise the Lord. Every thing that has (...) is a
word affirmed of the Rabbines, and some others out of them, to be only used for
the understanding, and superior part of Man, and so to be distinguished from
(...), that also signifies the sensitive and lower. But it is a Groundless
apprehension, and the present text evinces it so. For as (...) otherwhere is
put for Wind, so is (...), here, let every thing that has (...) is as much as
every thing, that has wind, Every windy and Pneumatical instrument; for it
were Instruments he had invoked; the Trumpet, the Psaltery, the Harp, the
Timbrel, the Stringed Instruments and Organs; and let every windy and
Pneumatical instrument, [perhaps every Musical, whether Pneumatic or Pulsatic]
let it praise the Lord; and praise ye the Lord. An Apostrophe to the Church, q.
d. O Saints praise ye the Lord.

And to what I would oblige others, that I desire my self; namely, to admire
and adore the Providence and Bounty of the Great God, and withal implore his
Favor, Assistance, and Protection: Which I shall, in Terms which Boethius
prompts me with. O qui perpetua mundum ratione gubernas,
Terrarum Coelique sator, qui tempus ab aevo
Ire jubes, stabilisque manens, das cuncta moveri
Quem non externae pepulerunt fingere causae

CHAP. III.
SECT. 1.
Divine Finality what. Acknowledged by Orpheus, all the Ancients, and Boethius.
Evinced from Divine bounty, and universal Efficiency. How all things are for
God. His Glory internal and external. How God is glorified.

ANd so much for Divine Benignity, that glorious Attribute of God; the first
Result of his Transcendent Goodness. There is another, that obliges us a little
to consider it, and that is his Finality, that, whereby he is Omega, or the
ultimate and furthest end of all things; so as that they are ultimately for
him, as he is for himself. He is the last, for whom are all; and so himself is
for no other; for if he were, he were not last.

Thus Orpheus, or if as Aristotle tells us, there was never such a Poet; let it
be as those Disciples of Pythagoras affirm, one Cercops (...) Apul. de Mundo
and all the Ancients. -- (...) Plutarch. advers. Cototen.


So Boethius also. -- Sed dic mihi, meministine quis sit rerum finis, quove
totius natura tendat intentio. Boet. Audieram inquam, sed memoriam maeror
hebetavit. Phi: At qui scis unde cunct a processerunt. Boeti. Novi inquam
Deumque esse Mundi. Phi. Et qui fieri potest ut Principio cognito, quis sit
rerum Finis ignores. Boet. lib. 1. Pros. 6.


For if he be the best Being, as has already been evinced, it evidently
follows, that be is the last End, in as much as Good and End, for all their
formal Notions and Idea's be distinct, are yet convertible with one another.
The Chiefest Good is All-sufficient, and of an universal comprehension, and
capacity, containing in it all Good; and he must needs be the End of all, that
contains in himself the Good of all.

It might be also argued, and perhaps with greater evidence and perspicuity, as
Boethius, and the Scriptures do, from his first and universal Agency; for he
that is the First efficient, must needs be the last End; Being is a Circle,
wherein it is impossible, but that the Alpha is Omega, and that the Point
beginning All, is the End of it. The Lord has made all things for himself.

And, if he be the End of all things, seeing that an End is that, for which a
thing is, and so the End of all, is that for which all others are; it follows,
that they all are for God [so our Apostle, to him are all things] or, as the
Holy Scriptures also happily express it (they all) are for the Glory of God.

But to prevent misapprehensions, it ought to be considered, that Divine Glory
is either internal or external Glory. His Internal, it is his Essential Glory,
that in respect of which the Great Apostle calls him the Glory, and Peter the
excellent Glory; and is as inseparably inherent to him, as is that which does
compose the Sun, to it. To which it is in this resembled, that it is as
inaccessable and dazzling to the mind, as this, to the Eye; and utterly
incapable of all Addition, as well as all Diminution. This is the Finis cui.

But this is not the End of acquisition, or as the Metaphysics style it, the
Finis cujus; it is not this, but his external Glory, that all things else are
lastly for. And his external Glory (as it were the shining of the Sun (is
nothing but the Manifestation of Divine Perfections and Attributes (which as
Aristotle De (...) lib. 1. c. 12.
intimates are all Glories) in his Operations and Effects, in respect of which,
when they are seen, admired, acknowledged, and ascribed to Him; He is affirmed
to be Glorified, or to have Glory given him: and this properly. For so Cicero.
-- Est enim Gloria solida quaedam res and expressa, non adumbrata, etc. Cicer.
Tusc. Quaest. l. 3.


Indeed God is said to be Glorified, or to have Glory given him, either
Passively and Objectively, or else Actively and Formally. The Heavens above,
the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and also the Earth below, the Minerals and
Plants, and mere Animals, things that comprehend not the Divine Perfections,
but as objects only represent and show them, do by interpretation give him
Glory or Glorify him in the first sense; but Man himself, in taking Rise from
these to do so, does perform it in the second. But properly, God is Glorious in
the former; but Glorified, by the latter. The Invisible things of God, are
clearly seen in the things that are made, etc. There Is the One. How Excellent
is thy Name in all the Earth, there is the other. Other Beings are designed to
Exhibit and Express Divine Glory, but Man is made to view it, and acknowledge
it. All thy Works praise thee, but, thy Saints bless thee.

So Arrianus. -- (...).

So Seneca. -- Nisi ad haec admitterer, non fuerat operae praetium nasci.
Senec. not. Quaest l. 1. praefat.


SECT. 2.
A Capitulation of the things to be discoursed. (1.) Man not an ultimate End,
evinced. 1. From his dependency in Being, and 2. From his Faculties. That he is
a mediate End conceded, and argued from the authority of the Stoics, of
Aristotle, and of Cicero, and by Reason, from the Essential Notion of the
world, and the Doctrine of Signatures,

But to be more particular, (as this Subject of Divine Finality, which is of
great importance, and concernment, does engage us) I shall endeavor to evince
distinctly. (1.) That Man is not his own End. (2.) That another, One above in
Heaven, and the Origin and Source of all, is it. And then (3.) That the
infinite Transceudency of God, or his highest Exaltation, and Supremacy, is the
ground of his Finality; which effected, I shall shut up this Discourse in two
or three Corollaries.

And first, That Man is not his own End, is evident; For as much as He is from
another: The Son is from the Father, and he from his, and so along unto the
first, who being of the same kind, is as dependent as the second; so first, and
second, and every one, is from another, and he is for another, and not himself,
that is dependent; and is not from himself, but from another.

But if this first evincement, seem too Metaphysical and Delicate, there is a
second, from the Humane Faculties and Powers, which is more Harmonious, and
convincing. It is that Man himself is constituted for address to Good without
him, that he is a willing and affective Creature; that is, that he has Will
and Affections, which inclining him to Things without, transport him. Now it
cannot be imagined, that he should be his own End, who is connaturally carried
out to Good beyond himself; it being utterly impossible, that that should be a
Terminative, Central Being, which has Pondus in it, and does gravitate and
weigh. That is off the Center which inclines and gravitates. Now the Will is
Pondus animae, and Love is Exstatical. Man is not his own end, because he is
not his own Good. He is an Appetent, and inclining Being; and therefore his
Good is all without him, because his Love, and his Desire export him.

I confess indeed He is the visible End of all inferior Beings. For though I
know Velleius, [He in Cicero] Carneades, and many others, do smartly argue on
the contrary; yet I also know, he is acknowledged so by Aristotle, by most
other great Philosophers, and generally, all the Stoics, as we are told by
Cicero -- Sunt autem alii Philosophi, and hi qu^idem magni atque nobiles, qui
deorum mente, atque ratione omnem mundum administrari and regi censeant: neque
vero id solum, sed etiam ab iisdem vitae hominum consuli, and provideri. Nam
and fruges and reliqua, quae terra pariat, and tempestates, ac temporum
varietates, coelique mutationes, quibus omnia quae terra gignat, maturata
pubescant a diis immortalibus tribui generi humano putant: multaque quae
dicentur in his libris, colligunt quae talia sunt, ut ea ipsa dii immortales ad
usum hominum fabricati paene videantur. Contra quos Carneades, etc. Cicer de
not. deor. lib. 1.
And -- An haec, ut fere dicitis, hominum causa, a deo constituta sunt? etc.
Ibid.


And, beside the first of Genesis wherein we have the Charter of Dominion; and
the second, wherein Adam in sign of his Propriety, and Right over them,
imposes Names and Titles on the Creatures; there are two Considerations, which
abundantly confirm it.

First, The World, it is called (...), for the Beauty, Order, Relations, and
Proportions in it, but for which it were a Chaos, a Tohu B^hu, not a World; and
these in being Adaequate and proper Objects of the Rational and Humane Nature,
do evidently show, that it was made for this. It is the Order, Relations, and
Proportions in the World, that makes it; and these are only for the
understanding, which alone discernes them; as Colors are for the sight, and
Sounds are for the hearing, and Odours are for the smelling, etc. There is
nothing in the World, but there is a Faculty in Man to reach it; and Objects
are for Faculties. And there are Entertainments in every Being in the World,
which are not so to any other but Man; and therefore, were not made for any
other, but for him. Every thing has its Beauty, its Order, and its Relation to
others, which only Man discerns. And Cicero noted it. -- Nec vero illa parva
vis naturae est, rationisque quod unum hoc animal sentit quid sit Ordo, quid
deceat, in factis dictisque quis sit modus. Itaque eorum ipsorum, quae aspectu
sentiuntur, nullum aliud animal pulchritudinem, venustatem, convenientiam
partium sentit. Cicer. de Offic. lib. 1.


And secondly, The Theory of Signatures, which are but so many Hieroglyphics,
or sacred Characters, and Notes on things, to intimate their Natures, and Uses,
is another proof of it. For seeing there are such impressions made on things by
Nature, whereof he cannot doubt, that has attentively considered her, and that
they are intelligible unto Man, and unto none beside, it cannot be, but that
they were intended and alone intended for him. How eminent a Signature is on
the Lujula, or Woodsorrel? it exactly represents the Heart, and is Cardiacal,
or proper for it. The Perforations of Hypericon, import its uses. And not to

SECT. 3.
One above, who is demonstrated the Maker of Man, and other things, is also
evinced his End. (1.) From Congruity. (2.) The limitation of inferiors in
their services of Man, and (3.) from the Harmony of the World.

But Man though he be the visible and immediate End of all things in the World,
yet, not being the Author or Original of any in it, He is obliged to asend to
One above himself, Who having made those other things, and also so designed
them for Man, as that he cannot but confess he could not do it for himself, is
to be acknowledged as much Superior and above him in Efficiency and Power, as
in Beneficence and Bounty. And this is the second thing I promised to evince.

For those other things are evidently, for the use and ends of Man, they are so
apt and fit to them; and consequently being for an End, it cannot be, but they
must have an Efficient. [Whatsoever is for somewhat, also is from somewhat] and
it cannot be from Man (that) they should be, who is so indigent to live upon
them; it being unimaginable, how a thing should be from him, who cannot be
himself without it. Now Man subsists on the Elements, and on Elementary
concretes.

It remains then, there is another Being they are from, which is infinitely
much above the Humane; of which it is as well the Origin and Source, as of
those other. For seeing it is utterly impossible, that Man himself should be
unmade, who cannot possibly subsist, or be without the things made: It Is most
agreeable that he should have the making of him, who has the making of the
things on which he lives. I say, it is most rational, that he should make Man,
if he be made (as he is proved to be) who, by providing for him, conserves him.
Thus other things and Man himself, lead us up to one above Man.

Now, admitting that Man has such an Author of his Being, as is infinitely
much above him, (for he made him) and has bountifully made all others, to
accommodate and serve him; how can it be imagined, but that he is for this? For
it is not to be thought, that God, who had so great considerations for another,
should incuriously neglect himself, but that rather, seeing he has made so
many things for Man's Ends, he made Man, and all things else for his own, and
in constituting Man a kind of God to them, Iamblic. in Protrept.
and so capacitating of him to receive Duties, did but agreably instruct him in
those other, which he is to pay. For what he looks for, from those beneath
him, why should he refuse to one so much above him, who made him for himself.

And that he has done so, the Humane Faculties do further show, For as much as
Man has both a mind and Understanding capable of apprehending God, and of
conversing with him, and a will also as capable of weighing and inclining to
him; and what other demonstration can a Man expect in Nature, of his being
formed to maintain an intercourse with God, to glorify him in the World, and
to recognize him as the first Efficient, and the last End, as Allmighty, and
All-Good, and by doing it to be conformed to him, but that he is enabled and
proportioned by him to do so? What Evidence we have to convince us, that the
Eye was made to see colors, that very same we have to prove that our
understandings and Wills were ordained to converse with God: for we can
Apprehend him, Love him, Desire him, and Delight in him, and therefore were
ordained to do so. Porphyrie is full, this is that Man's End. -- (...) Porphyr.
de Abstinent. l. 1. Sect. 29


But Iamblicus is fuller. -- (...) Iamblic. Protrept. cap. 3.


This is abundantly confirmed, in that Inferior Beings are so confined and
qualified in their services to Man, that they do him none, but in Dependence on
a Superior. For instance, the Soil it self, for all the pains and industry the
Husband man is at in cultivating and manuring it, will afford him nothing
without the Rain from Heaven, which makes the fruitful Seasons. And who holds
the Key of Rain but God? Pausan. in Attic.
The Athenians acknowledged it; they owned a Jupiter Pluvius. Pausan. in
Corinthiac.
[So Pausanias tells us] and also the Arcadians, who saught it of him, Idem in
Arcad.
when they needed it. In a word all Greece acknowledged it, when destitute of
rain, they sent to Delphos. The same Pausanias reports the whole passage. --
Cum diuturna siccitate Graecia labor aret ac non minus reliqua, quae extra
Isthmum est, Graecia quamtota Peleponnesus caelestium aquarum penuria affecta
esset, missi Delphos sunt, qui ex oraculo calamitatis causam ac remedium
cognoscerent, etc. Id. in Corinthiac. Romul. Amasaeo. Interpret.


This is the very Argument by which the great Apostle does establish the belief
of both the Divine Being and Beneficence among the Lystrians, when (as the Text
implies) by way of obviation to the Doctrines of the Zabi, and others, who
ascribed them unto their vanities and Idols, he asserteth Rain from Heaven and
fruitful Seasons made by it, to proceed from God alone, who is the Living and
Almighty. For, says he, they Witness for Almighty God [ He left not himself
without Witness] That he is above, that he is gracious and benign, and that by
reserving in his own power, things so absolutely necessary both for humane
subsistence, and for that of all things living, he does at once remind us of
the indissolvable and strict dependence, which we all have on him, and also of
the Deference and Duty we owe him. If God give gifts, we owe acknowledgements;
Rain and fruitful Seasons come down, and therefore Man must look up. The year
makes the increase; but God makes the year. This the Gentiles acknowledged.
Jupiter Pluvius had an Altar.

So Pausanias. Est item ara ibidem alia, ad quam Jovi, quem modo Pluvium, modo
Innoxium appellant, rem divinam faciunt. In Attic.


And the Ancients paid their first Fruits.

So Porphyrie. -- Sect. 27. (...) Porphyr. de Abstinent. Sect. 27.
and he thought it reasonable, -- (...) Ibid. Sect. 24.


And in fine the Harmony of things evinces it; there is a visible subordination
in the world, of the lower to the higher Region: This Earth depends on Heaven;
the motions of Celestial Bodies, inspire and continue those of the Earthly, the
Sun by its access unto us, and its removal from us, makes the Seasons;
Particular causes, those are here below, but all the universal are above, as
who would say, the cause of all is there.

SECT. 4.
The Supremacy of God the Ground of his Finality, evinced to be so Harmonically.

And it is most apparent from what I have already argued, that it is the
infinite Transcendency, Supremacy, Superlative Eminency of Almighty God (which
I promised to demonstrate in the third place) that is the Ground of his
Finality: That therefore he alone is the Ultimate and furthest end of all
things, because he is most Eminent and High, and One above them all.

To confirm this, I shall but offer one consideration (more then what I have
already) That there is a visible Subordination and Design in things; that the
Earth is for the Grass, the Grass is for the Beasts, the Beasts, and Grass, and
Earth, are for Man; one thing for another but all in such Relation, that what
is Higher and Superior, is the End of what is Lower and Inferior; The Earth
is for the Vegetables, the Vegetables for the Sensibles, the Sensibles are for
the Rationals, the Lower for the Higher; and therefore the Rational and all for
the Highest. All for God, and Hosea's climax

intimates it.

SECT. 5.
Three Corollaries deduced (1,) Man ought to be at God's dispose. Hard
Apprehensions of God anticipated. Epictetus urged. (2.) All ought ultimately to
be referred to to God's Glory, and how that is done. God to be enjoyed, not
used. Wherein Blessedness consists.

And first it Evidently follows, that if Almighty God be Man's End, he ought
to be his Measure: and that it is infinitely more agreeable that man should
absolutely be at Gods dispose and beck, than that the Beasts should be at
Man's; he being infinitely more inferior unto God, than the meanest Creatures
are to him. And what if God had loved Esau less than Jacob, and make his power
known in some, etc.

What? are Inferior Animals so much at Man's will, as that they live and die
at his dispose and pleasure, and shall Man himself repine to be at Gods?
bethink thy self a little, O thou Man that murmurest, is not he thy Maker? Thou
art not thy Beasts, which yet thou travellest, labourest, slaughterest, and
fattest but for slaughter. Does not he support thee in thy Being, which he
first gave thee? Have thou any thing that is not his? Who then art thou, O Man,
that durst dispute? Has not the Potter power over the clay? Shall not that be
reason for God, which is for thee? to do with his own, as he lists? The Beasts
are made for thee; but thou thy self for God.

Remember Epictetus. (...) (...) (...) Epict in Enchirid. cap. 77, 78, 79.


And Secondly, If God be our ultimate and furthest End, it will become us to
refer in all things to him, whether we cat or drink, or what ever we do; let
all be done to the glory of God; which as we then perform Actually, when in
doing any thing we actually do mind it, so we also then implicitly and
virtually at least do so, when we perform all as he will have us according to
the Gospel Rule; for example, when we eat and drink moderately, temperately,
justly, and as the Gospel does oblige us with due acknowledgement and giving of
thanks.

Hear Arrianus. (...) Arrian. Epict lib. 1. ^ap. 15.


Finally if God be our ultimate and last End, we are not to imagine we may use
him as an instrument and means to rise by, as those who make Religion, but a
point of interest, a Tool of State, or else a Stale to other Matters; he is an
End and not a Means. But, we must consider him, as the only Maker of our utmost
Happiness, and as that central, infinite, and comprehensive Good, who being
infinitely blessed in conversing with himself, and in enjoying of his own
Fullness, does render others so by their enjoyments of him, and converses with
him. Blessedness is nothing but a State of aggregation of all Good, and he is
in it, that has a full enjoyment and fruition of God. God is all Good. He is
self happy; Happy Essendo, We are happy in him, by Union and conjunction to
him, happy Fruendo.

He that is joined unto the Lord is one Spirit.
