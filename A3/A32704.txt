TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THOMAS, VICOUNT FAUCONBERGE.
MY LORD,
IT was the saying of a learned, wise, and great Man, of our Nation, that Books
of Use ought to have no Patron, but Truth and Reason; And whether or no I have
observed this Rule, in devoting this Book to your Lordship's Patronage, will
not be much disputed by Any, who have the Happiness and Honor to Know you
well. For, whoever understands your general insight into all Kinds of Learning,
your exact Judgment in distinguishing Truths from Falsehoods, however subtily
concealed and plausibly delivered, and your strict Reasonings in all Arguments
offered to your Consideration, does need no other proofs to convince him, that,
if You are not Truth and Reason it self Animated, yet (at least) you have them
in you, in so eminent a degree, that it can be no Flattery to say, You are
therein a Grand Exemplar to Others: nor will the most Scrupulous refuse to
embrace, as Authentic and Current, whatever Position has once received the
stamp of your Assent and Approbation. So singular a Felicity it is, to render
Nobility more illustrious with Learning; to have long cultivated a fertile Mind,
with select Precepts, and useful Observation of Men and Manners; and always
to make mature Deliberation the Harbinger to Belief, as well as to Action.

Besides, the Argument of this Discourse, which now humbly seeks your Lps.
Countenance, is much more proper and fit for Your Cognizance, than vulgar Eyes
perhaps may judge, when they first glance upon the Title of it. For (to omit,
that it leads to the most excellent of all Human Knowledges; the Knowledge of
Ones self, which is the groundwork of Civil Prudence) it explaineth the most
probable Economy of Nature in perfect Animals; and especially the most perfect
and noble of them, Man: A piece of Science, certainly, so far from being
Unnecessary to a Statesman, that I dare affirm, None can ever attain to any
competent proficiency in the Mysteries of State-principles, or the Art of
Governing Men, who is not in some measure conversant in the Mysteries of Human
Nature, as well those which concern the Constitution and Fabrique of the Body,
as those which belong to the Inclinations and Passions of the Mind. And, the
Reason hereof is obvious and plain; since the Maxims of sound Policy ought to
be derived from the Laws of Nature, at least by way of Analogy and Imitation:
and the best way to understand, how to preserve Men in Societies, is to
observe, How Nature at first produces, and afterward conserveth them in their
single Persons, or individual Beings. Certainly, My Lord, the highest pitch, to
which Human Wisdom can aspire, is, to imitate the works of God in his
Creatures: and the most perfect Model or Form of Government, is that, which
comes nearest to the Idea of the Divine Constitutions, either in the larger
Volume of the Universe, or in the exact Abridgment of it, the Body of Man. This
made Pythagoras call Man, the Measure of all things. This makes the greatest
Politicians so frequently consult the oraculous Aphorisms of our perpetual
Dictator, Hippocrates; and transfer His Rules of curing Diseases of the Body,
to the composing Disorders, and rectifying Distempers in the State. This
Menenius Agrippa found a happy truth; when He, in a moment, appeased the
seditious and mutinous Commons of Rome, only by a speech, wherein He compared
the several Members requisite in a well-ordered Commonweath, to those in the
Body of Man; and showed the Offices of Those, to be as necessary as the
Functions of These. And, this that incomparable Sophy, the Lord St. Alban,
seems to have reflected upon, when He said, It was without president, that any
Government had been disastrous in the hands of Learned Governors; and doubted
not to call those, Empirique Statesmen, who are ignorant in Natural
Philosophy. I could, My Lord, expatiate in this noble and ample Theme, and
permit my Pen to run into a Parallel betwixt the several Parts in a Body
Politic, and those in the Body Natural; and demonstrate the near Affinity and
Correspondence of them, in their respective Uses, Actions, and ways of
subministring to the Health and Conservation of the whole: but that I here
speak to a Person, to whom such speculations are so familiar, that I should
derogate from the Vastness of his Parts, to imagine it needful for me only
to put Him in Mind of them, or (indeed) of any thing else suitable to that
place of Eminency, and Condition of Dignity, to which his Virtues have advanced
Him.

Now, My Lord, these my Exercitatitions being thus, in a Twofold Respect,
capable of your Lordships Favor; their Ambition in seeking to acquire to
themselves more of Value and esteem, from the Knowing and Ingenious part of
Mankind in our English World, by carrying your illustrious Name in their Front;
is not only Excusable, but also Commendable, as being grounded on the Law of
Decency, which forbad them to address to any other Sanctuary; and which
evinceth, that this their applying themselves to your Lordship, was upon due
Regard, not upon Facility.

And, for my Own part; that I have taken this way of Testifying the
extraordinary Respect and Honor I bare to your Person and Virtues: this is to
be imputed, partly to the Humility of my Condition; which permits me not to be
so happy, as to have any better Means, or Opportunity of expressing my
Devotion; and partly to my Gratitude, for the many singular Favors Your
Generosity long since conferred upon me, which always urges me, in the best
manner I am able, to acknowledge my self,

My most Honored Lord, Your Lordships Most humble, and most entirely devoted
Servant, Walt. Charleton.

The Stationer to the Reader.
THat you might be acquainted with the Occasion of the Author' s writing this
discourse, his Design therein, and the Motives that induced Him to consent to
the Publication of it; I have obtained leave of him, to Print also this
following Epistle of his to that Excellent Person, Dr. Ent, to whose peircing
and impartial judgment, he thought fit to submit his own, as well concerning
the Veri^y and weight of what his Papers contained, as concerning the fitness
of their Constitution to endure the public air. And this Favor I was the
more importunate (...) him for; both because it might evidence his Modesty, in
distrusting his own Exactness: and because it might appear, it was not only
his Inclination, that brought this Book into my hands, and so into yours.
Besides, I was not so improvident of my own Advantage, as not to understand,
how much of Reputation the Book has acquired to it self, by passing the
Examination of a Man, whose Universal Learning, and admirable Perspicacity in
things of Nature, have conspired to render him as competent a judge of such
Treatises, as the World affords. This I say, not to assure you, that Dr. Ent
found nothing in these Papers, from which He thought fit not to dissent;
because, the subjects of Philosophers speculations and Enquiries, being usually
very obscure in themselves, it is no rarity to meet with Diversity of Opinions
among Them, as well as among the Vulgar: but, thus much I dare avouch, that He
dissented but in very few points, and those only concerning such difficulties,
that are not yet clearly determined by Anatomical Observations; and that
nevertheless, He pronounced the whole work to have been undertaken upon mature
Consideration, and done with singular Care, Industry, and Circumspection. And I
doubt not but you also will be of the same Opinion, when you have attentively
read the book; in which confidence I commend it into your hands, being not a
littla glad of so good an opportunity to manifest my devoir toward the advance
of Knowledge, and service of the Public.

OF NVTRITION. Exercitation the First.
Of Nutrition.
THe Platonist, Article
though He holds the Nutrition and Generation, one and the same Act of the soul
or Formative virtue.
does yet allow the World to have been created by God: and to solve the seeming
contradiction, says, that Priority was not [(...)] in respect of time, but
[(...)] in respect of Nature; as the Sun and light are coaevous, though the one
be the Cause, the other the Effect. This, certainly, might be more justly said
of the Generative and Nutritive Faculties (if at least, they be not one and the
same); by one of which an Animal is produced, and by the other conserved. For,
though the Formative Virtue may seem to precede in its operation; yet are the
Stamina, or rudiments of the Embryo scarce delineated, or adumbrated, when the
Nutritive begins to augment and perfect them: So as that it may rather be said
to go hand in hand with the Plastick's faculty, than to follow after it; and
what priority there seems to be in their operations, is rather in respect of
Nature, than of time. To form, and nourish, are not only acts of one and the
same soul; but so alike, that it is no easy matter to distinguish betwixt
them. For, Generation and Accretion are not performed without Nutrition; nor
Nutrition, or Augmentation, without Generation. To nourish, is to substitute
such and so much of matter, as was decayed in the parts, namely flesh, nerves,
veins, arteries, etc. And what is that in reality, but to generate flesh,
nerves, veins, arteries, etc? In like manner, Accretion is not effected without
Generation; for all natural bodies, upon the accession of new parts are
augmented, and those new parts are such of which these bodies were first
composed: and this is done, according to all the dimensions; so that, to speak
properly, the parts of an Animal are increased, distinguished, and organized
all at once. Farther, this is necessary both in respect of the Efficient cause,
and of the Matter. The Former, because idem esse principium efficiens, As well
in respect of the Matter, as of the Efficient.
nutriens, and conservans in singulis animalibus, necesse est; nisi aliam
formam in puero, aliam in adolescente, et in seen aliam constituamus. The
Latter, because all Animals (such as are produced per Epigenesin, of which is
our discourse; not of such Insects, as are produced per Metamorphosin) are
corporated of one part of the matter prepared by the Formative Spirit, and
nourished and augmented by the rest. For, Nature does nourish and amplify all
parts of an Animal with the same matter, or humor (not with a diverse) out of
which she constituted or framed them at the first. Because, whatsoever is
superadded to the parts, during their growth, ought to be of the same
substance, with what was prae existent, and so must consist ex congenere
materia: their Renovation as well as first Corporation being effected by
Epigenesis, Aggeneration, or superstruction. So that we may well conclude, that
Nutrition is nothing else but continual Generation: and as necessary to the
Conservation of every individual nature, as Generation it self is to the
conservation of the Universe.

To make this Necessity the more evident, The necessity of Nutrition, twofold,
viz. Augmentation and Conservation.
(1) That forasmuch as an Animal cannot perform all the functions, of which
its nature is capable, whilst it remains in the minute parts, and rude
beginnings, in which it is first formed; therefore, there must succeed a
Nutrition, that may dilate and amplify those slender stamina, by interweaving
and assimilating so many other congenerous parts, as serve to advance and
augment the Animal to a convenient magnitude: (2) That since the chief
principle of life in every Animal, is a certain indigenary Heat (analogous to
pure flame, such as the most rectified Spirit of Wine yields, upon accension)
which by continual motion and activity agitating the minute and exsoluble
particles of the body, does dissolve, and consume, or disperse them; of
necessity, the whole Fabric would soon be destroyed, unless there were a
continual renovation or reparation of those decays, by a substitution and
assimilation of equivalent particles, in the room of those dispersed and
absumed. So that, we see, the Necessity of Nutrition is Twofold; one in
respect of Augmentation, the other in respect of Conservation.

As to the continual Decay, or Depredation of the substance of our bodies,
wherein the latter necessity of Nutrition does consist; that we may the better
understand the manner how it is effected, we are to enquire into the Causes
thereof, viz. the Agent or Depredator, and the Matter or substance depredated.

Agent or Efficient Cause, with all Philosophers, The Efficient cause of the
consumption of the parts, is the Vital Flame
we hold to be the Natural Heat, or Vital Flame, at first kindled, by the
vegetative soul, or Plastic spirit, in the blood, constantly burning in the
Heart, as in its fountain, or primary Focus, and thence by diffusion of it
self through the arteries, warming, cherishing, and enlivening all parts of
the body. This Lar familiaris is called (...), ingenitus ignis, by Hippocrates;
(...), Accensio animae in cord, the Kindling of the soul in the heart, by
Aristotle; and generally known by the name of Calidum innatum, the innate Heat.
The principle of life, therefore, being a certain Fire, certain it is that the
same cannot subsist or endure one moment of time, unless it be perpetually
maintained or fed with some convenient (...), succendiculum, or Fuel; which
is thereby indesinently consumed: for, all Fire whatever (that Elementary Fire,
which the Aristotelians conceive to be so pure, as to need no pabulum or
aliment, being a mere Chimera) does conserve it self only by the destruction
of the matter, in which it is generated. So that, indeed, we have one and the
same Cause both of our Life, and of our Death; or (to speak more properly) our
Life is nothing but a continual Death, and we live because we dye. For, so
long we live, as this Vestall-Fire is kept glowing and shining in the sacrary
of our heart: and when the same is put out, either by suffocation, or want of
sustenance, life is instantly extinguished. And perhaps, it was to this
Euripides alluded, when he said; Quis novit autem, an vivere hoc sit emori:
An emori, hoc sit quod vocamus ^ivere?


The Matter or substance consumed, we conceive Fluid parts of the body, The
Matter thereby consumed, not the substance of the solid parts, but the Fluid,
and chiefly the Blood and Spirits.
especially the Blood and spirits, which having in them something of the nature
of oil or sulphur, are the principal succendiculum, or Fuel of the vital
Flame: and not the substance of the solid parts, at least not in that large
quantity vulgarly supposed. For, experience teaches, that sundry Animals, as
Bears, Dormice, Swallows, etc. do sleep all the winter long, without receiving
any supply of aliment: and yet have all their solid parts of their bodies, as
large and firm, when they awake again in the spring, as when they first betook
themselves to their dens or dormitories; nay, if we may credit Natural
Historians, they grow fat in this time of their long abstinence. Which
doubtless is to be ascribed to this, that the flame in their heart, all that
time, being but gently moved, and burning quietly, does consume very little of
their spirits and blood. In like manner, we have examples of Leucophlegmatique
virgins, who upon a decay of Appetite, have ^ndured long abstinence from all
sorts of aliment: and yet have not been emaciated in any proportion to their so
diuturn fasting. So that it is more than probable, that there is not so rapid
and profuse an exhaustion of the substance of the solid parts, by the activity
of the vital Heat, as Physicians have vulgarly imagined. In many diseases, we
confess, the habit of the body is much extenuated; but that is only a
subsidence or flac^idity of the Musculous flesh, caused by the defect of
spirits and blood, by which the same was formerly distended and plumpt up; not
by any deperdition of the substance of the solid parts.

Manner how the blood and spirits (and, The Manner how they are consumed, is by
continual Dispersion.
if you please to have it so, also the less fixed and more easily exsoluble
particles of the solid parts) are absumed by the vital Heat; it may be
familiarly explicated by the example of the oil consumed by the flame of a
Lamp. Flame (as reason defines it) is a substance luminous and heating,
consisting in a perpetual Fieri, i. e, an indesinent accension of the
particles of its pabulum, or combustible matter, and perishing as fast as it is
generated: so that fire is made fire, and again cease to be fire, in every,
the shortest moment of time; and when there remain no more particles in the
(...) matter, wherein i^ may generate it se^fe anew, it instantly perishes.
Continual Disp^rsion, therefore, being the proper effect of Fire; the matter
or sewell, whereon it subsisteth, cannot but be in perpetual flux or decay. In
like manner (that we may accommodate this to our present purpose) the Lamp of
life consisting in a continual accension of vital spirits in the blood, as
that passes through the heart; those vital spirits, transmitted by the
arteries to the habit of the body, no sooner arrive there, but as they warm
and vivifie the parts, so do they immediately fly away, and are dispersed into
the air, carrying with them many aqueous parts, and (perhaps) some sulphurous
exhalations. Moreover, there being in all parts of the body certain sweet and
balsamicall, or conserving spirits, as it were affixed unto and concorporated
with them; the vital spirits meeting with and acting upon them, do by little
and little render them volatile, and at length wholly disperse them: whereupon
the minute particles, in which they did reside, become mortified, and, as
excrements of the body, are ejected together with the exhalations of the blood.
And this is (as we conceive) the reason and manner of the depredation made upon
the parts, by the vital heat.

If your Curiosity extend yet further, and Quantity of Aliment daily devoured
by this Biolychnium, And in what Quality.
or Lamp of life; the acute Sanctorius will tell you, that, according to his
statique observations, men commonly avoid as much by insensible perspiration,
in one day, as by stool, in fifteen. But so great is the variety among men, in
respect of temperament, diet, age, exercise, the season of the year, and other
circumstances; as that no definite compute can be made of this dispense. And
yet we may be certain, that the proportion of blood and spirits daily exhausted
by the flame burning within us, is very great: and that the most part of the
matter of occult transpirations, is the vital spirits, which are continually
generated, and continually dispersed.

From the consideration of the Causes and Reason of the Deperdition of
substance in Animals, we may opportunely progress to an enquiry into the
Causes and Manner of the Renovation, or Restoration of it, by Nutrition.

Efficient principle (or (...), as Aristotle calls it) certainly, The Efficient
Principle of the Renovation of the parts, what.
is the very same with the Generant, or Formative; because, as we said before,
Generation cannot be without Augmentation, and Augmentation is Nutrition. Not
that we are of their judgment, who hold that Life and Nutrition are different,
not in re, but only in ratione; for, the Embryo is nourished, before the
Empsychosts: but that we conceive, that Life does consist in a continual
accension of vital spirits out of the blood, which is the pabulum of the Lamp
of life; and that Nutrition does consist in the restoration of what is
consumed, by an Apposition and Assimilation of consimilar or congenerous matter.

The Material, or Constitutive principle, we And what the Material.
mild and balfamical Liquor, analogous to the white of an egg, out of which
the chicken is formed. For since all Animals are nourished with the same, out
of which they were at first fabricated, according to that common Axiom, iisdem
nutrimur, ex quibus constamus; and that of Aristotle, eadem materia est, ex qua
augetur animal, and ex qua constituitur primum; and since they have their
origin ex Colliquamento: we may well conclude, that the Succus Nutritious is in
all qualities respondent to the Colliquamentum of the white of an Egg. Nor are
they in the right, who think, that the parts of the body being diverse, those
of the Aliment ought also to be equally diverse. As if Nutrition were nothing
else but a selection and attraction of fit aliment; and that there were not
required in every part a concoction, assimilation, apposition, and
transmutation. For, the Aliment of all parts is common, and similary, such as
the white of an egg; not heterogeneous and composed of diverse parts: and it
is the work of the Vegetative soul, as to form all parts out of one and the
same homogeneous matter at first, so afterward to augment and repair them out
of the like, by transforming that into the substance of each part, which is
potentially all parts, and actually none. As from the same rain all sorts of
plants receive their increment; because the water, which was potentially life
to them all, is now made actually life to each, being transmuted into the
substance of each. Whereunto the Philosopher had respect, when, opposing the
opinion of Anaxagoras,

Principium rerum qui dixit Homaeomesiam, He says; De genesis Animal. l. 2. c. 4.
Distinctio partiam non, ut quidam opinantur, propterea fit, quia simile suapte
natura ad simile fertur: nam praeter alias multas, quas ratio ista habet
difficultates, accidet, ut quaevis pars similaris se^rsim creetur Verbi gratia,
^ssa per se, and nervi, and carnes; si quis eam causum approbet, etc.

Manner how the parts are refected, And the Manner how they are renorated.
or instaurated; it is most probable the same is effected by apposition,
agglu^ination, and assimilation or transmutation; all which must in order
succeed each other, before the act of Nutrition can be complete. For, the
succus nutritious, being first prepared in the stomach and other organs
thereunto inservient, must be brought and apposed to all the parts, that are to
be nourished; then from contiguity by apposition it must be advanced to
continuity, by agglutination; and lastly made of the same substance with them,
by assimilation or transmutation, which is the perfection or ultimate term of
Nutrition.

Cons^ctary, of the twofold Expense of the Chyle.
one part thereof, being converted into the succus nutritious, for the
instauration of parts: the other being converted into Blood, both for the fuel
of the vital flame, and for the confection of Spirits. That we may, therefore,
the better understand the process of Nature in both these Operations; it is
fit, we enquire into the method of Chylification first, and afterward into that
of Sanguisication: that we may comprehend the whole history of Nutrition from
the beginning to the end.

may not ascend to the brain, and that the concoction may be the more perfect;
the lovver, lest any of the meat should descend into the guts, before it be
converted into perfect chyle. Yet the lovver seems not so strongly contracted,
as the upper; because it has been observed, that upon even a gentle
compression of the body of the stomach, it easily yields to the pressure of the
yet half-concocted meat, and permits it to pass into the guts. And sometimes
the stomach is so weakened, by surfeits and frequent distension, as that
neither of its orifices is drawn together so closely, as it ought to be; and
in such case the Concoction is alvvayes imperfect.

The Dissolution of the Meat, by an Acid humor found in ^he stomach.
is by and by moystned and diluted, partly by the drink, partly by a certain
Acid humor contained in the stomach. Which being endovved with an incisive,
penetrating, and dissolving faculty, does as it were cut, and dissolve the
solid meat into very small pieces, and (like an excellent menstruum) extract
all the laudable and alimentary parts of it, ad modum Tincturae. But whether
this Acid juice be ingenite in the stomach it self, or sent thither either
from the Spleen (as has been vulgarly believed) or from the caeliacal arteries
(as is most probable) we shall hereafter professedly enquire. In the mean
while, certain it is, that this Acid liquor (or spirit, as some have named it)
is so necessary to the stomuch, as that it cannot happily perform its Office
of Chylification without it. For (to omit how much the same conduces to
excitement of Appetite) when it is vvanting, the concoction is rendered so
imperfect, as that the meat is avoided whole, as it was svvallovved down;
which Hippocrates seems to intimate, in the 1 Aphor. 3. sect. where he says,
In longis intestinorum laevitatibus, si tactus acidus fiat, qui prius non erat,
signum bonum est. Certain it is also, that this Acidity, as it is not excited
but by a moderate heat, so it is discussed and destroyed by an excessive. Which
is the reason, why the appetite is vveak and languid in phlegmatique
constitutions, and cold distempers of the stomach; and in Fevers, and hot
distempers, wholy taken away. Like as bread is very hardly leavened, in a
cold place, and in an Oven not at all. But, we return from our digression.

The mixture of the solid and liquid parts of the aliment, being by this time
advanced usque ad minima, Which causes a certain Fermentation of the Chyle
therein.
so as the whole appears to be, one and the same fluid substance; in the next
place succeeds a Fermentation, not unlike the motion arising in wine, while
it defaecates it self. Which Fermentation we understand to be a certain Heat
and agitation of all parts of the liquor, arising from a contest or strife
betwixt the Spirits and crasser parts, while the Spirits endeavor to expand
themselves, and fly away, and the gross parts oppose and hinder that their
endeavor. Now this is that motion, which being equivalent to long Elixation,
does so fully impraegnate the potulent part of the Aliment, with the spirits
and virtues of the solid, as that it puts on the form of a whitish juice, in
color and consistence not much unlike the Cream of barley, generally called the
Chyle, as the function or action of the stomach, by which it is so confected,
is called Chylification.

All parts of the Aliment, not Chilified at once, but successively: and the
first Chylified, first discharged into the Guts.
that all the meat does not receive this commutation equally soon; it having
been observed in dissections, that some parts have been perfectly converted
into chyle, and that chyle detruded into the intestines and milky-veins; while
the rest have remained wholly crude. Nor is it reasonable, that the whole mass
of Chyle should be detained in the stomach; or that what is already concocted,
should there stay and expect the perfection of what is not concocted: but that
as fast as the chyle is made, so fast should it be discharged out of the
stomach.

Time wherein the work of Chylification is wholly confummated, The Time
required to perfect Chylification, various, according to diverse respects.
there is no small variety; as well in respect of men's individual
temperaments, as of quantity and quality of meats they eat, and also of the
time of their meals, with other circumstances. For, in some men the digestion
is completed in 3, 4. or 5. hours space; while in others it extends to 8. 10.
nay 13. which certainly is to be ascribed chiefly to the abundance of heat and
Acidity in the stomachs of Those, and to the decay of them in These. Again, by
how much the greater quantity of meat is devoured, by so much the slower is it
digested. The same likewise may be said of the quality thereof; because the
gro^^er, tougher and harder the aliment is, by so much the more difficulty is
it comminished, cut, dissolved, and fermented; and consequently the longer
before it be concocted. Moreover, concoction is performed in the day much
sooner, than in the night; notwithstanding the vulgar opinion, of the recession
of the natural heat toward the stomach, in sleep, for the promotion of
Chylification: because in the day, by reason of motion and exercise, the
Circulation is more free and swift, and so the distribution of the Chyle more
expedite. Lastly, Mastication of the meat in the month is so necessarily
praecedaneous to concoction; as that by how much the smaller the morsels are,
and the better chewed, by so much the sooner are they digested. Nay, among the
parts of the same meat, there is no lesse-variety; so that some parts of bread
and flesh commonly remain unaltered, a good while after others more tender and
exsoluble are transformed into perfect chyle, and protruded into the gutts. So
that no certain time can be assigned to Concoction in all men. But Nature it
self has given us a sign, by which every single person may know, when this
chylification is finished in his stomach; and that is a sense of emptiness,
and appetite to a supply or recruit of Aliment.

THE IOVRNEY OF THE CHYLE Exercitation the Third. Article

THe Chyle, being, The traduction of the Chyle, from the stomach and
intestines, into the common Receptacle, through the venae Lacteae.
according to the manner Venae Lacteae, or milky veins. Which opening
themselves by small orifices or inletts, in infinite number, into the coats of
the intestines; and running in continued channells from thence into the
Mesentery: carry the Chyle into a certain common Receptacle or Gulf (called
Receptaculum Pecqueti, from the inventor) consisting of a membranous substance,
situate at the root of the mesentery, upon the vertebrae lumborum, and filling
the space betwixt the Muscles Psoae. From this common Receptacle there are
drived other ductus chyliferi, which running upwards, near the spine of the
back, through the Thorax, and propagated quite home to the subclavian branches
of the vena Cava, near the external jugular veins, exonerate themselves into
them; so as the Chyle being there commixed with the blood, is by the ascendent
trunk of the vena Cava, soon imported, together with its new associate, the
blood, into the right ventricle of the heart. And this, according to the late
invention of Perquet, and anatomical experiments of the most accurate
Dissectors since, is the true Traduction of the Chyle from the ventricle to the
heart: at least of so much of it, as is to be converted into blood, for the
fuel of the vital Flame, and confection of vital spirits.

That we may, with the more exactness and Of which there are two kinds, one
arising from the Intestines; the other from the Glandules, in the Abdomen, into
which the former sort exonerate themselves.
trace the footsteps of the Chyle in all its progress through these various and
obscure Meanders; we are to observe, from Anatomicall Demonstrations, two
things concerning the Chyliferous Conduits. First, that there are (besides the
Common Receptacle, and channells from thence ascending to the chest and
subclavian veins) two kinds or sorts of the venae Lacteae; one arising in
slender capillary roots from the Intestines themselves, and thence delated
through the Mesentery to some glandule or other, situate either in the
Mesentery it self, or not far from it in some other part of the Abdomen, and
there disseminated into capillary surcles: the other taking its origin out of
that very Glandule, into which the former sort exonerate themselves. Secondly,
that the Glandules in the Abdomen are not seated in the same places in all men;
but are variously posited, here in some there in others, according as Nature
(sometimes affecting variety in the same species, where convenience admits
thereof) pleases to fix them; and this without incommodity to the body: and
that from the incertainty of the position of these Glandules, the Distribution
of the venae Lacteae comes to be also various and uncertain. For, Anatomy
sensibly attesteth, that all the small surcles of the venae Lacteae of the
former sort (arising from the intestines) do constantly tend to some one
Glandule in the lower belly; and are distributed into the same, before they
arrive at the Common Receptacle, or disembogue themselves into any vein; yea
(as was newly said) that they produce another race of Capillary branches in the
Glandules, in which themselves were terminated; and that many of those small
rivulets concurring and uniting, make one greater channel, before they lose
themselves either in the Common ocean, or any branch of the vena Cava. Now,
from the foresaid various position of the Glandules, it comes to pass, that the
Distribution of the venae Lacteae into their substance, and their new
propagation out of them again, are so uncertain, as that it has given occasion
to some Anatomists to suspect, that the venae Lacteae are disseminated into
very many parts of the body; when, indeed, they only come near those parts, and
then pass by them, without effusing any part of the Chyle into them.

Now, from these observations, But none of either kind tend to the Liver.
it is very venae Lacteae (before the Chyle loses its milky color) do
exonerate themselves either into the vena Cava, or some branches of it. And as
for the Lacteae Thoracicae, our sense demonstrates, that they empty themselves
into the subclavian or Axillary veins (branches of the Vena Cava); so that none
disgorgeing their fraught or chyle into any branch of the vena Portae; it is
most manifest, that no part of the Chyle is imported into the Liver (as was
long believed and taught), there to be converted into blood; and consequently
that the office of the Liver is not Sanguification.

Whether any of the venae Lacteae are distributed Paps, and womb; That the Milk
in the Papps is not made of Blood, but of mere Chyle brought thither by some
peculiar vessels: because
in women; though highly probable, is yet in dispute: no Anatomist having
hitherto been so happy in his searches, as to discover by what secret ways or
passages they tend to either. We say, highly probable; for, according to that
judicious saying of Hippocrates, Licetvisum oculorum effugiant, ea tamen mentis
acie comprehendantur; though they have thus long concealed themselves from the
eye of the body, yet are they obvious to the eye of the Mind: and the acuteness
of our Reason may herein supply the dullness of our sense. Now, to evince the
probability of this Opinion, let us consider the sundry and weighty Arguments,
that seem to assure, that the Milk in the paps is not made of blood; but mere
Chyle brought into them by some peculiar vessels. Which though a seeming
Parergy, is yet fully pertinent in this place.

no convenient ways or conduits, There are no convenient conduits, by which
Blood can be brought into the paps, in sufficient quantity.
by which Blood may be, in a due quantity, imported into the Paps, there to be
whitened into Milk. For (1) the Arteriae Thoracicae can adferre but a small
tribute of blood into the treasury of the Paps; and what they bring in, is soon
exhausted and carried off again by the veins; according to the apodictical
doctrine of the Circulation of the blood. But, did the blood remain in them;
yet would it hold no reasonable proportion to the large quantity of milk
usually effused in a day (which in healthy Nurses commonly amounts to two
pints). Because the Arteries disseminated into the Paps, are exceeding small,
as our eyes witness, and Vesalius, Examine observat. Fallop. page 89.
long since well observed, where He says, Exiguae out fere nullae arteriae
adeunt mammas, quod in mammarum cancro affectarum ablatione constat, ubi paucae
aut fere nullae arteriae sanguinem fundunt, cum tamen venarum magna copia sit.
(2) The Arteriae Hypogastricae cannot be thought to convey blood into the Paps;
because they are terminated in a part far distant from their confines, and
empty themselves where their streams are soon swallowed up and returned into
the vena Cava by the Hypogastrick veins. (3) The same may be said of the
Epigastrick arteries and veins. So that in respect of ways importing blood
into the Paps, it appears altogether unlikely, that that should be the matter
of Milk.

Secondly, Blood is not a fit, Blood is nor a fit, nor possible Matter, for the
generation of Milk.
nay not a possible For (1) if blood should be imported into the paps, in
sufficient quantity, and there extravasated; certainly it would be converted
rather into pus, than into milk, as is frequently observed in Inflammations and
Apostems of the Paps. (2) To what end should nature convert blood into milk,
when that milk is to be soon converted again into blood, in the infant sucking
it? (3) How is it possible, that the Chyle, which loses its whiteness and
other qualities, when it is transformed into blood; should resume them again,
as soon as it becomes milk; a privatione ad habitum, is repugnant to Nature?
(4) Meat and drink cannot be suddenly changed into blood, and that blood
changed into milk; but experience teaches, that the paps of nurses are filled
soon after their repasts, and many women feel their milk flow swiftly into
their breasts, almost as soon as they have drunk. (5) Women that are somewhat
fat, have greater plenty of milk, than such as are lean: but, if blood were the
matter of milk, the lean would afford more milk, than the fat; because the lean
have larger arteries and veins, and so more store of blood. (6) If blood were
the matter of milk, then would the bodies of Nurses fall into dangerous
sicknesses, from excess of blood, soon after they cease to give suck; because
being long accustomed to the generation of so profuse a quantity of blood, for
the supply of their milk; and that daily evacuation thereof ceasing, the whole
body must needs be oppressed with that redundancy: but, they seldom complain
of any Plethora; therefore etc. (7) If blood, not chyle, were the matter of
milk, then were it impossible the milk should retain the odor and qualities of
the meats eaten; since no manifest quality of the meat can be deprehended in
the blood, much less in what is generated of blood, as being one remove further
from it: but the Milk does frequently retain the odor and other qualities of
the meat and drink; Ergo. This is attested by the experience of Physicians, who
give purging medicaments to Nurses, Comment in lib. Hippocr. de not. pueri.
when there is cause to purge their children. Prosper Martianus, the best
Commentator upon Hippocrates, has an observation of a woman, who having taken
a purge, soon after gave her child suck, and thereby endangered the child's
life, a superpurgation ensuing in the child, while herself felt no effect of
the medicament at all. No obscure argument, that the Milk deriveth its
purgative faculty from the Chyle, not from the blood; for it were to be carried
so long a journey, as through the heart and arteries, and therein undergo so
many and great changes: doubtless the virtue of the medicine would be much
weakened and dulled; nor could it be derived into the paps* so soon after it was
first received into the stomach. Here may we seasonably recite that saying of
Aristotle, 7. De hist. Animal. cap. 11.
Si lactans pilum cum cibo aut potu angerat, ad memmas pervenit, and in earum
papillis consistens, morbum inducit, qui (...) nominatur: and that rare
observation also cited by Martianm, Loco eitat.
of a piece of a root of Cichory eaten in sallade by a nurse at night, and
taken out at one of her nipples the next morning. But, above all, this
Experiment is most convincing. Let a nurse drink a good draught of milk tincted
with Saffron; and within an hour or two after express the milk out of either of
her paps, into a glass or other small vessel: and that milk shall have the
odor, sapour, yea and the very color also of Saffron. (8) Nor is the Milk
made of the Menstruous blood, as some Philosophers have dreamed; because many
bruit Animals have milk, that never suffer the monthly flux; because most
newborn infants have some milk in their paps, De genesis anim. exercit. 55.
as Dr. Harvey has well remarked; and because even Men themselves have been
found with good plenty of milk in theirs also. Schenchius affirms, that he knew
one Laurentius Wolfius, who from his youth to the 50 year of his age, had
abundance of milk flowing out of his duggs every day. The like is asserted of
a certain Flemming, by Wallaeus; and of diverse others by Cardan, by Benedictus,
by Aquapendens and other credible Authors. Nay, Historians report, that in
America there are whole nations, among whom the men generally abound with milk,
and suckle their children.

To which we may add, that many nurses have their Terms, while they give
suck, and yet find no diminution of their milk, at those times, more than at
others. So that we see, how unreasonable it is to conceive, that blood is the
matter of Milk.

Milk and Chyle agree in all their manifest Qualities; and are reciprocally
convetible.
as may appear both by their mutual agreement in all their qualities, and by
their easy reciprocal convertibility. As for their resemblance in manifest
qualities; (1) They both have a fatty substance: otherwise neither could be fit
either to sustain the Lamp of lise, or to instaurate the parts; nor can the
blood contain any such fatty substance in it, but what is derived from the
Chyle. (2) As Milk does consist of two parts, the serum and crassamentum; so
likewise does Chyle, whose serum is dreyned away by the kidneys, and crassament
by the guts. (3) As Milk, if kept overlong, especially in a warm place, or
corrupted by any Acid juice, does turn sour; so also does the Chyle, and in the
stomach of Calves is found a certain sour serum, which houswives use for the
coagulation of their Milk; in like manner the same is frequently generated in
the stomachs of men, which being ejected by vomitting, sets the teeth on edge;
having acquired that sowrnesse either by corruption from excessive heat, or* by
the admistion of a melancholy juice. (4) They are equally sweet in taste; which
is the reason, why many brute Animals lick up the milky liquor flowing from the
secundines, when they bring forth their young, which is indeed the nutriment of
their young, while remaining in the womb. (5) They resemble each other in
color, being both white; as the sense testifies. (6) They both contain
certain small Fibers, that seem to be educed from the more viscous and
glutinous parts of the aliment. And these, doubtless, are those Fibers, which
sensibly uniting themselves in the superfice of blood let forth into a cold
vessel, appear in form of a whitish film, or thin skin; long mistaken by
Physicians for cold, viscid and phlegmatique matter commixt with the blood: and
if the red parts of the blood be gently washed away from them, they become
distinctly visible. And as for their reciprocal Convertibility; that is clearly
proved by this, that Chyle is easily converted into milk, in the Nurse; and
that milk again converted into Chyle in the stomach of the Infant that sucks
it. Now these many resemblances considered, we may safely conclude, that they
have much more of reason on their side, who conceive Milk to be nothing but
mere Chyle brought from the stomach to the Paps, by peculiar passages; and
therein promoted to somewhat more of perfection: than they, who think it to be
made of blood whitened in the glandules of the paps.

Having, with so great verisimilitude, That Chyle is imported also into the
womb, in pregnant women.
brought Chyle from the stomach to the Paps, for the sustenance of the infant,
after he is born; it remains now that we see, whether any portion thereof be
deduced also to the womb, for his nourishment before he is born. First,
therefore, let us seriously consider, what light has From the Authority of
Hippocrates, and
Hippocrates; who has sundry pregnant Texts to this purpose.

Uterum foetu grandiorem (says He) comprimere mulieris ventrem, lib. de Nature.
pueri.
and quod in cibo potuque est pinguissimum and candidum, magisque uteri calore
dulcoratum, in mammas tendere, and in uteros quoque exiguam portionem per
easdem venas deferri. In which words the reverend Author touches upon two
things very considerable and pertinent. (1) That the fat, white, and sweet
Chyle is carried up to the paps, by compression of the Venae Lacteae, and the
common Receptacle of the Chyle; the swollen womb being incumbent upon them, and
pressing the Chyle upwards. For, that Compression cannot be understood of the
veins and arteries in the lower belly, as if they were thereby urged to
disgorge their blood into the paps, for the generation of milk; because, a
compression of those veins and arteries, that are near the Vertebrae Lumborum,
would necessarily hinder the course and recourse of the blood, requisite to the
work supposed. But, as Perquet will have the weight of the Liver, moved up and
down in respiration, to conduce to the compression of the stomach, venae
lacteae, and receptacle, from the upper part of the abdomen: So will
Hippocrates have it, that, from the lower part, the compression of the woman's
belly by the greatness and weight of the child, does cause the Chylo to alter
its course (his words, in another place, being, lib. de Mulier.
convertitur ad maemm^s, quod est dulcissimum ex humido) and flow upward to the
paps. Thus the Scythians, as Herodotus reports, had a trick to blow up the
wombs of their Mares, by certain sufflatoria o^sea, like pipes, to the end that
their bellies being compressed by the swelling of their wombs, the greater
abundance of Chyle might be protruded into their udders, and so their milk
increased. (2) Since by reason of the same Compression, the passage of the
Milk, by vessels tending from the paps to the womb, is not so open and free, as
while the burden of the womb was less; thence it comes, that so small a
quantity of the Chyle is imported into the womb, as will not suffice to the
nourishment of the Foetus. Much Chyle, therefore, flowing to the paps from the
Venae Lacteae, and the Common Receptacle; and some milk also reflowing from the
womb to them, by reason of this Compression mentioned: it is no wonder, if the
paps at that time swel above measure;

A second memorable place of Hippocrates, libr. citat.
to this purpose, is that; Ad mammas enim and uterum ejusmodi venulae, and
consimiles, feruntur. Cumque ad uterum pervenerit, lactis formam habet, ^oque
exiguo puer fruitur: mammae vero, ubi lac exceperint, attolluntur and implentur.

A third, to the same effect, is this; Foetus quod in sanguine dulcissimum est,
ad se trahit, simulque aliquantula lactis portione fruitur. Where He hinteth
the true cause, why it is unwholesome and dangerous for Infants to suck women
with child, viz. because the best of the milk is attracted by the Foetus, in
the womb, and the worst is carried to the paps. Which He more expressly declares
in these words, Dum mammae exsuguntur, venae quae ad eas tendunt ampliores
redduntur, and ampliores effectae quod pingue est e ventre a^trahunt, and in
mammas transmittunt: giving the reason, why the fat and richer parts of the
milk do not ascend to the paps, till after the birth of the child, who by
frequent sucking does dilate and amplify the vessels (formerly too small)
through which the milk is to pass from the womb to the paps, and so make them
more capable of the thicker liquor; and hence, doubtless is it, that the milk
in women's breasts is always much thinner and wheyish, while they are with
child, than after their delivery.

From Hippocrates the First, let us go to Hippocrates the Second, Of Dr. Harvey.
the immortal Dr. Harvey; who, by frequent dissections of praegnant and
suckling Animals, discovered that there is Chyle or milk imported into the
womb. For, describing the Cotyledones or Acetabula of the womb, Exercit. de
Vteri membranis and humoribus.
He says; Cavitates istae spongiae majoris loculamenta magnitudine non
excedunt; inque singulas earum. totidem vasorum umbilicalium ramuli tenuissimi
profunde penetrant: quippe in iisdem alimentum foetui reconditur; non quidem
sanguineum, sed mucosum, ovique albumen crassius plane referens. Unde etiam
manifestum est, bisulcorum Animalium Foetus (ut and alios omnes) sanguine
materno non ali. And, in the subsequent paragraph, He adds, coarctatis hisce
acetabulis, non sanguis, sed albugineus liquor emanat; eodemque expresso, illa
statim contracta, albidiora, and flaccida conspiciuntur; ac demum mammarum
papillas, aut verrucas pensiles majores referunt: And a little after, Opinor,
carunculas omnes (uberum modo) non sanguinem, sed succum albumini similem
concoquere, eundemque foetui subministrare. Again, in another place, tracing
the way of this milky juice more accurately, He says; ab utero per cotyledones
pertingit ad carunculas placentae; quas quidem si digitis compresseris, ex
earum una aliqua (tanquam ex papilla) succi istius alibilis facile cochlearis
mensura emulgetur: idque nullo apparente sanguine, quem attractu etiam valido,
numquam elicueris; quinetiam caruncula sic emulcta atque inanita,
compressaespongiae instar contrahitur and flaccescit; plurimisque foraminibus
pertusa cernitur. Adeo ut omnibus indiciis pateat, carunculas istas esse ubera
uterina, sive albuminis nutritii conceptacula. And a little after, He expressly
affirms, succumillum in Gravidis ante partum, in acetabulis conservari; post
partum vero, ad mammas deferri. Than which nothing can be more plain, more
positive.

To the Authorities of these great men, let Sympathy or consent betwixt the
womb and paps, And from the sympathy betwixt the womb and the paps.
so frequently observed in women. Which Consent cannot be caused by nerves, nor
by veins, nor by arteries, nor by similitude of substance, nor by contiguity of
situation; and therefore most probably, by mediation of these presupposed
Chyliferous vessels tending from the paps to the womb. (1) Not by Nerves;
because the paps derive their nerves from the fourth intercostall pair, or the
fifth pair of the thorax: and the womb is supplied with sense from the nerves
of the o^sacrum, and also from the sixth conjugation of the brain. (2) Not by
veins or arteries; because they are, both, destitute of sense, as Galen himself
affirms. (3) Not by Similitude of substance; because the paps consist mostly of
Glandules, and the body of the womb is membranous. (4) Not by Contiguous
situation; because the paps and womb are far distant each from the other. It
being, therefore, most certain, that all sympathy betwixt parts of the body,
does arise either ex Vasorum Communione, or ex operis societate, or both; and
that betwixt the paps and womb there is no communion of vessels, unless it be
of some chyliferous vessels derived from those to this; and that there is a
society of office betwixt the paps and womb, both containing the Aliment of the
child: it is highly consentaneous to truth that there are such vessels (though
yet undiscovered) by which the Chyle is carried from the paps to the womb,
while the infant remains therein, and back again from the womb to the paps,
after he is born. This being granted, we may clearly understand the ways and
manner of the ascent of the milk from the womb to the paps; and the reflux of
it from the paps to the womb, so frequently mentioned by Hippocrates. We may
understand also, how the good or evil affections of the womb are communicated
to the paps; and how it comes, that a Cancer cured in the paps, does revive and
grow again in the womb, and vice versa. And thus may we understand those
Aphorisms of Hippocrates; Si gravidae mammae graciles fiunt, repent illa
abortit; si gravidae lac multum e mammis efflu^t, foetum imbec^llum significat;
si solidae mammae, foetum saniorem. In respect of these vessels, are we
moreover to interpret that Rectitude of consent betwixt the papps and womb,
intimated in that Aphor. Gravida gemellos gerens, si dextera mamma fiat
gracilis, marem; si vero sinistra foeminam abortit: foetus enim mares in
dextris, foeminae in sinistris magis.

Chyliferous vessels tendin from the paps, to the womb.
ductus, by which the paps and womb have a reciprocal commerce; it is not
improbable, they are derived from the extremities of the Chyliferous veins of
the thorax, where those enter into the subclavian veins, or the branches of the
vena cava; being disseminated on each side one, to each pap^; whereunto so soon
as they have insinuated themselves, and dispersed several small surcles, to
lead a long the chyle to the nipples, they may be conceived to emit others
branches downward along the abdomen, that insert themselves into the womb, on
each side one; and perchance some one also into the bladder, it having been
observed, that Chyle has been avoided by urine. But, what need we thus
anticipate, by conjecture, when we daily expect the discovery of the ways
through which they pass, by Anatomists, who now a days exercise themselves in
strict enquiry after them?

OF SANGVIFICATION. Exercitation the Fourth.
Of Sanguification.
FRom the smaller and less conspicuous Rivulets Article
we now come to survey the grand and plainly visible Current thereof; The most
part of the Chyle is converted into blood.
which being imported (as we formerly declared) into the subclavian veins, from
them into the vena cava, and thence immediately disembogued into the right
ventricle of the heart, is therein converted into a liquor of a different
color and nature, viz. Blood, for the fuel of the vital Lamp, and the
continual refection of spirits vital. And here we are (for method's sake) in
order to consider (1) The Mutation which the Chyle ariving at the heart, does
therein suffer, or the Action its self, called Sanguification; (2) The Agent,
or principal Efficient of that Mutation; (3) The Manner how it is effected; (4)
The Uses of the Blood, after it is made; (5) The Motion of the same, in order
to those uses.

Concerning the FIRST, viz. the Action of Not by an Organicall, but a Similary
Action.
we advertise, that it is not an Organical action, or such as depends upon the
peculiar constitution, or fabrique of any Organical part of the body; but
merely a Similary one. For, since the blood, when made, is a similar body; and
the Chyle of which it is made, is likewise a similar body; and that the Chyle
does not become blood, by separation of any one or more parts of it, from any
other (as the Urine and Bile are made) but only by a kind of Exaltation of it
nature, or an advance of those Natural spirits it contains, into vital or
more sublimed and active ones, while the vital spirits, praeexistent in the
Ventricles of the heart, do enkindle the same hea^, and cause the same
diffusive or expansive motion in the Natural, which themselves have formerly
acquired: we say, considering these things, it is manifest, that the work is
done by simple Assimilation; and consequently that Sanguification is an Action
similar, not Organical, as has been long erroneously affirmed.

Concerning the SECOND, viz. the Efficient, let us first examine what that
cannot be; and so we shall the more easily and certainly find what it must be.
The prime Agent, or Author of the work of Sanguification, is not either the
Liver, as Galen and his Sectators conceived and taught; or the veins, as some
Anatomists have dreamed; or the substance of the Heart, as Aristotle and his
Disciples have asserted; or any other organ of the body.

Liver not to be the Agent in the work of Sanguification; Whose Primary
Efficient, is not the Liver;
and that for sundry reasons. (1) No part of the Chyle is brought to the Liver,
by any one or more of the Venae Lacteae: they in the lower belly generally
exonerating themselves into the Common Receptacle; and those in the Thorax
being terminated in the subclavian veins: and therefore it is impossible the
Liver should transform chyle into blood, when no chyle can arrive thereat. (2)
There is blood to be seen in an Embryo, before even the very ^udiments of the
Liver are delineated; and what has being before, cannot be the effect of what
has no being till afterward. That the blood has priority of existence, is
manifest from the observations of Dr. Harvey, de genesis Animal. exercit. 18.
who expressly affirms, Sanguinem dari, antequam quicquam corporis reliqui
existat; esseque eum, prae coeteris omnibus foetus par^ibus, primogenitum; and
ab ipso, tum materiam, ex qua corporatur foetus, tum nutrimentum, quo augetur,
procedere; esse denique (si modo ulla fuerit) primam particulam genitalem. (3)
After the Chick is perfectly formed in the egg, and has its veins and arteries
replenished with blood; yet does the Liver still remain pale and whitish, not
without some small tincture of yellow, which observation does of it self alone
demonstratively depose the Liver from the office of Sanguification, and
confer that dignity upon some other Agent. For, how can the Liver, supposing
the Chyle were brought to it, give a deep redness thereunto, while it self yet
continues white? Can any thing give that to another, which it self has not?
This also is certified by the experience of Dr. Harvey, who thereupon firmly
concludes; jecur and calorem, exercit. de gen Animal. 51 sub finem.
and colorem suum a sanguine mutuatur; non autem sanguis a jecore. From hence
it may be observed, that the native color of the Liver is not red, but pale,
with a faint mixture of yellow; and that, what redness it does afterward
acquire, is communicated to it from the blood continually percolated through
the parenchyma of it. Both which may more plainly appear by this, that in a
Chick not yet excluded from the shell, that yellow paleness of the Liver is
visible, even the very last day of the Hens incubation; though at that time the
same begins to incline toward some degree of redness, which is more and more
augmented every day after the chick is hatched. Again, if you fill a bladder
with warm water, and through a slender pipe inject the same, by the trunck
either of the vena Cava, or vena Portae, into the Liver; and so rinse out the
blood remaining in the vessels and substance thereof; you shall sensibly
perceive the redness of the Liver to vanish away, and a certain duskish or
sooty yellowness succeed in the room. Which obscure yellowness, doubtless,
has its original merely from the tincture of Choler. However, most certain it
is, that the Liver has natively no redness at all; and what it afterward
contracteth, is adventitious, and from the blood. To this purpose is that easy
experiment of Dr. Harvey; (...) jam citato.
imo vero jecur, lien, renes, pulmo, and cor ipsum (si sanguinem inde omnem
expresseris, cujus praecipue gratia viscera dicuntur) expall scunt illico, and
partibus frigidis accensenda sunt. So that we may with good warrant conclude,
that the office of Sanguification was, by the Galenists, assigned to the Liver,
rather upon inconsiderate partiality, than any right at all.

(2) Of the veins also the same may be said. Nor the veins.
if that rule of Galen holds true (as certainly it does); Quod mutatur, in ejus
speciem, a quo mutatur, facessit; the veins can never be thought fit, to
transform the Chyle into blood. For, their Color is white and somewhat
translucid; their substance viscid, membranous, and bloodless; they have no
parenchyma, and very little either of heat or spirits of their own: whereas, on
the contrary, the Blood is of a deep red, not translucid, of a substance fluid
and interminate, and abounds with heat and spirits. And, therefore, it were
vain to expect an Assimilation, where the supposed Agent and Patient are of
natures in all things so incompatible, so contrary. We deny not, that the veins
in some respect conduce to the Conservation of the blood; but how? Only as they
are Organs, inservient to the defense of it from external injuries, and the
reduction of it from the parts upon which it was newly affused out of the
arteries. And as for any similar Action of the veins upon the blood; they have
none at all: yea, their office of Conserving it does consist chiefly in their
inactivity, i.e. in this, that they are not apt to alter or deprave it; as
Glass-vessells are the best to conserve liquors in, because they neither
communicate any ill qualities of their own, nor permit the like to be
communicated from others to them. But, that which does principally conserve the
blood in the purity of its nature, is the very same thing that makes it from
the beginning, viz. the vital Heat and Spirits derived from the Heart, which by
their enlivening warmth, and continual motion, do not only vindicate the blood
from corruption, but also all the solid parts of the body, and so even the
veins themselves also, as long as the Lamp of life continues burning. And that
being once extinguished; how soon, alas! do all parts of the body yield to the
quick tyranny of corruption?

(3) Nor has the Heart more right to this noble office of Sanguification. For,
Nor the Heart: but the vital spirit, residing in the blood.
that borrowes far is it from exalting the Chyle into so noble a Nectar, as the
blood is, by any similar action of its own. To assure this, please you, take
out the yet-panting Heart of any the strongest and soundest Animal, and having
with warm water rinsed all the blood out of the ventricles, fill them again
with warm Chyle or Milk; and see whether it will be able to convert the same
into blood. Certainly, you shall find none the least change to be wrought upon
the liquor infused. Yet the Heart is a solid and strong part; and one would
scarce think it probable, that that action, which it is supposed to perform,
by reason of its solid substance, should be intercepted in so short a space of
time. Forasmuch, therefore, as the Heart does, in a moments time, surcease its
activity, and desist from the work of changing Chyle into blood, as soon as the
vital blood is effused out of its ventricles; it is as manifest, as certain,
that the virtue Generative of blood, is not radicated in the solid substance of
the Heart, primarily, but in something else, viz. in that very thing, upon whose
absence immediately that virtue is destroyed, which is the vital Blood. Again,
the dissection of Living Animals teaches us, that the vital Heat is much
greater in the ventricles, than in the substance of the Heart: and Reason
bids us thence to infer, that the same Heat is originally in the
ventricles, and but at second hand, or by way of communication, in the
parenchyma. Now, if the Activity of even the Heart it self, be derived
originally from the vital Blood; and that the vital Blood be more powerful
than the Heart: we can hardly deny the same to be the Primary Cause, or Agent
of Sanguification; unless (at least) it shall appear, that the vital blood is
less apt for such a work, than the Heart. But, comparing the agreeableness of
the Heart to such an office, with that of the vital Blood to the same; we shall
quickly perceive which of the two has the greater. For, the vital Blood is of
the same species with the thing to be made or produced; but the substance of
the Heart is far different from it. It being, therefore, canonical, that all
Natural Agents endeavor, according to their energy, to assimilate to their
own nature the thing, upon which they act: it seems of equal certainty, that
the activity of the vital Blood, is most properly consigned to the work of
Sanguification. A further evidence of this, may be drawn from hence, that the
Chyle and Blood are most intimately mixed together in the ventricles of the
Heart; while the Chyle does only superficially and in transitu touch the side
of them. To which may be added, that the Chyle makes but a very short stay in
the Heart: but remains constantly commixed with the Blood, until it be thereto
perfectly assimilated. Lastly, the blood flowing in the heart, arteries, and
veins, does exceed the Chyle of one meal, in quantity at least ten times, and
in strength or activity, an hundred; (for, what is more potent, then that
spirit, which enliveneth the whole body; what softer, gentler, and more easily
superable, than Chyle?) and therefore, no doubt but the Blood does easily
obtain the victory over the Chyle, and overrun it with his own nature.

Dr. HARVEY (the true Oedipus in all abstrusities of this kind) of the progress
of Nature in the generation of the parts of an Animal successively one after
another; which alone forms the blood in a chicken, out of the Colliqua mentum.
and we shall soon be satisfied, that the First Blood is made by the vital
spirit. That great man attesteth, that the white of the Egg does for some
days after the Hen has sat a-brood upon it, retain its native whiteness, and
that out of the Colliquament, or White, made more thin and fluid, the Chick is
generated, without the addition of any other matter. The Question then is only
this, How that white color in the Colliquamentum, or so much of it as the
Plastique faculty converts into blood; comes to be changed into red?

Certain it is, this cannot be effected by any thing that was red before;
because there is no part of the Egg of, or inclining to, that color; and the
yelk remains entire a good while after there is blood to be seen in the punctum
saliens. Nor is it the Fleshy parts, that communicate this vermillion tincture
to the blood, because they remain white after the blood is made out of the
Colliquamentum: and it is much more reasonable, that the fleshy parts derive
their redness wholly from the blood, perpetually irrigating and washing them
in its Circulation. For, their redness grows upon them by degrees, and that
sooner or later, according to the degrees of Heat impressed upon the Egg by
the Hen, and according to the greater or less quantity of blood arriving at
them. Some parts, which are but lightly touched by the blood, never become red;
in which account are the coats of the Eyes, the Ligaments, Tendons, Membranes,
Bones, etc. Others obtain a certain palenesse dashed with a sparing mixture of
red; as the Glandules which as they are furnished with greater or smaller
arteries (respective to their magnitude) so are they tinged with more or less
of redness. The Musculous flesh is more deeply died with scarlet, than the
Glandules; as being irrigated with greater streams of blood. The Kidneys,
Liver, Spleen, Lungs, and Heart, are all washed with full streams of blood; and
therefore have a deeper dye of redness, than any other parts: and yet are much
less red, than the blood it self. Now it is more reasonable to conceive, that
the Greater should communicate its virtue to the Lesser, than on the contrary,
the Lesser to the Greater. For, how can any Natural Agent operate beyond the
sphere of its activity, i.e. the measure of its power? or communicate that to
another, which it self wants? Again, nothing can have an activity, before it
has a being* and consequently the solid parts cannot give a redness to the
blood, because they are not in being, till after the blood. Nothing,
therefore, remains to be the Efficient of the Blood, but the Vital Spirit,
kindled originally in the purest part of the seminal matter, or Colliquamentum
which we may well denominate the Vital Liquor.

THIRD considerable, viz. the Manner of this grand operation of the Vital
Spirit; The Manner how blood is first generated in an Embryo, by that Vital
Spirit.
though it be very obscure, yet do we not think it altogether inexplicable, if
we deduce the blood from its first Origin, the newly mentioned Vital Liquor.
This Vital Liquor, before it assumes the color and form of Blood, does begin
to separate it self from the other parts of the Egg (to which it is at first
promiscuously admixed) and to run its self out into certain slender
rivulets, or branchings, which afterward become Veins. These rivolets
concurring in a point, meet altogether at the center of the Colliquamentum;
which center being the principal seat of the Plastique spirit, and acquiring a
certain mication, or pulsation, is then called Punctum Saliens? And all this is
done, before there is any the least appearance of blood in the Egg. So soon,
therefore, as these Rivulets are conjoined, the Flux of the Vital Liquor is,
for some time, so hindered by, and repressed in them, as that being inde^inently
agitated by the Spirit of Life, it aestuateth, and endeavors to expand it self
and enlarge its bounds: and seeing that it cannot flow back again toward the
circumference, by the same passages, which brought it toward the center, by
reason of fresh supplies of Vital Liquor pressing it forward continually in the
course begun; it is compelled to force it self again into the seminal matter,
from whence at first it began its motion, through other slender conduits newly
for that purpose formed, and then it begins to flow in a round. For, this
appears to be the true reason of the Circumgyration of the Vital Liquor, from
the very beginning. Soon after this, the Rivulets or pipes first made, and
leading from the circumference to the Center, become Veins; and the others made
in the second place, and leading from the center to the cicumference, become
Arteries: which yet others disallow, in respect of the fabric of the valves)
and then in the point of their concourse or confluence, the Heart is framed.
Through which Heart, and the conduits annexed or (rather) continued unto it,
the one sort tending toward, the other from ward the center; the Vital Liquor
does (while life lasts) perpetuate its motion: and at the same time irrigate
and vivifie all parts of the matter, which it continually washes in that its
circular course. Now this Circula^ion is begun, for some time before the Vital
Liquor is excocted into blood; as may be conceived from hence, that when the
motion of the Punctum Saliens is plainly visible, there is no blood, but only a
clear, transparent liquor, or (as the Learned Harvey call's it) the
Colliquamentum: and also from hence, that while the Seminal Matter is yet thin
and fluid, the Vital Liquor can easily disperse its channels through the same;
there being then no impediment to that its expansive motion, and operation:
but, if it should defer its dispersion and making of rivulets, til after the
solid parts were made; it is hard to conceive, how it could be able to shoot it
self forth into branches, and make its way through them.

Dance of Life being thus begun, and in what part of the Conception it is first
generated, viz in the Ch^rion.
though no Blood yet appears, yet soon after it does appear; the Vital Liquor,
while continually (though slowly) circulated, by little and little assuming the
form of Blood. And the place in which the blood first shows it self, is the
Chorion; not the Heart. For, seeing that the Chorion ought to be made solid and
firm, before any other of the parts of the Conception, insomuch as it serves
as well for the safeguard, as nourishment of all the other parts; and that to
this end, there is no moisture coming from without, that might hinder its
being made solid; and that the Chorion, as involving the whole conception, is
the first part that receives the warmth of the Hen, during her incubation: we
say, from hence it comes, that the vital Liquor does first of all obtain the
form of Blood in the Chorion. And this is effected the sooner, because the
vital Liquor does more easily emit its exhalations, in that place, as being in
the circumference, than in any other more remote from it: and unless those
exhalations were freely emitted, the Spirits of the Vital Liquor would
inevitably be soon extinguished. It is moreover probable, that at this time,
the Vital Heat is more potent and active in the exterior parts of the
Conception, than in the Center; and so, that the First Blood is made in the
Chorion, where it first discovers it self to the sight of the inspector. Hence
also we may observe, that because there is no blood to be discerned in the
Punctum Saliens, for many hours together after blood is discernable in the
Chorion: therefore, must the Circulation of the blood be exceeding slow in the
beginning; for, as soon as the blood, that is in the Chorion, performing its
circular motion, arriveth at the Heart, it cannot but be discerned in the
Punctum Saliens.

Now, In the generation of Blood, what are the Concurrent Extrinsecal Causes:
and what the Accessory Organical.
these observations being undeniable, Vital Spirit in the Seminal matter, being
excited and assisted by the external heat of the Hen sitting upon the Egg; and
by degrees becoming active, and infusing heat into the vital Liquor, wherein it
does reside: does thereupon, in process of time, induce the color of blood;
and that only by means of its vital Heat and Motion; and that no other part is
to be reputed for Principal Agent, in the work of Sanguification.
Nevertheless, we do not hereby exclude Concurrent extrinsecal Agents, or
Causes: but into that account readily admit the Hen, whose warmth at first both
excited and assisted the Vital Spirit in the work of Sanguification; and the
substance of the Heart it self, which afterward conduces in some sort to the
same. Nor do we repudiate Accessory Organical Causes; as the Fabric of the
Heart, the Arteries and Veins, all which are inservient to the continual motion
of the blood. Only we affirm, that the Vital spirit, by reason of its Heat and
Motion, has a just right to the dignity of Principal Agent, in making of Blood.

The Conversion of the Colliquamen^um into Blood, by the heat and motion of the
Vital Spirit; illustrated by sundry analogous Experiments, and Observations.
By reason of its Heat and motion. For, that Colors frequently are advanced
from a white, or pale, to several kinds of Red, merely by Heat and Motion; is
demonstrable by sundry easy and familiar Experiments. Our Confectioners well
know, that long boiling of Quinces and other Fruits does give them a ruddy
color. So likewise Fruits baked in an oven, are more inclined to redness, than
while they were raw. The same is true also even of Flesh, and Bread, which by
baking or rosting, acquire redness in their superficial parts: and some
Chemists affirm, that a Tincture of Bread will assume a certain degree of
redness, after long digestion. This is not, we acknowledge, common to all
Liquors, especially simple ones; for simple waters, and such as are destilled,
suffer little or no change of color, upon decoction, though long. But
generally all Compound Liquors, especially if they contain any Nutritive juice,
in competent quantity, and have besides any touch of salt, or Acid spirits in
them: are observed to acquire a sanguine tincture, by decoction. Upon which
fertile hint, as we conjecture, that highly Learned, Industrious, in Apolog.
pro circulatione sanguinis, advers. Parisan. p. 119.
and Acute Person, Dr. ENT, seems to have grounded that ingenious opinion of
his; that the Redness of the Blood arises ex Aciditate spiritus vitalis
salinei, from the Acidity of the vital spirits, having their original from a
certain seminal salt. However, we have good reason to persuade our selves, that
all vital Liquors, i.e, such wherein the vital spirits of Animals do reside,
are apt to acquire more or less of redness; provided they obtain sufficient
Heat, and agitation or strife in their motions. This is evident in all
Sanguineous Animals, in which the Chyle is first white, and after changes into
blood. And as for Exsanguious Animals, they also give some testimony of this
truth; as may be instanced in Oysters, in which blood is frequently found (and
yet without a prodigy) in summ^r time, by reason their vital Heat seems then to
be augmented: and in winter, when their Heat is again lessened, below what is
requisite to induce redness, their vital juice is always whitish. To return to
sanguineous Animals; as they are generally hotter of constitution, than
Exsanguious; so are their Sanguine parts always hotter, than their pale and
white parts. In like manner, in cold diseases, as the Green sickness, Cachexy,
Dropsy, and in all Phlegmatique constitutions, the blood is paler, than in hot
diseases and constitutions. Again, the venal blood, as it loses the heat,
which it had acquired in passing through the heart and arteries; so does it
proportionately by little and little lose that florid and deep scarlet dye,
that it had in the heart and arteries. For, blood let forth of a vein, appears
bluish, and comes short of that lively fresh scarlet, that is observed in
blood effluxed from an Artery. All which clearly show, by whose efficiency it
is, that the vital juice (in Sanguineous Animals) is excocted into Blood; and
what conserves the same in its primitive purity and luster: viz. the vital
spirit continually renewed in, and enlivening the blood; for, that being once
extinguished, how soon does the blood degenerate into Cruor, and lose its fresh
scarlet tincture?

That the same Agent, which makes the first blood in an Embryo, does make it
ever after in an Animal, d^ring life.
which makes the First Blood in an Embryo, by converting the vital Liquor, from
a white, into a purple Nectar: we cannot be long in exploring what that is,
which in Animals makes blood all the life after, by converting the Chyle
likewise, from a white into a red liquor. It is an infallible rule, you know,
that the identity of Effects depends upon the identity of Causes; because an
effect is not supposed to be, until it has obtained existence from its proper
causes: and at the same time the causes give that existence, they cannot but
give also the identity belonging to it. All which is imported in that common
Axiom, Idem, qua idem, semper facit idem. For, though Free and Arbitrary
Causes may act at liberty, and, by varying the manner of their operating, vary
also their effects: yet Natural ones are bound up to a determinate mode of
energie, and must, as long as they continue the same, act after one and the
same way, and so produce invariably the same effects. Forasmuch, therefore, as
the Efficient of the First Blood, is an Agent Natural, and not Arbitrary; if it
continue the same in an Animal, while the Animal lives, it must of necessity
continue the same operation. That it does continue the very same, during life,
is most certain; because it is the Principle of life, nor can life subsist for
so much as one moment without it. Nor does this Efficient of Blood only persist
the same in the body, that it was at the first conception; but grows every day
more vigorous, potent and fit for the work, until the Animal has attained to
the flower of his age: and to imagine that an Agent Natural (such as the Vital
Spirit) should at any time become idle, intermit its operation, and not
exercise all its forces; is grossly absurd. Conclude we therefore, that the
Vital Spirit, as it is the Efficient Cause of Sanguification, in the Embryo
from the first Conception; so is it constantly Author of the same work, until
the Animal dies.

OF THE USES OF THE BLOOD. Exercitation the Fifth.
IT follows now, Art^cle. 1.
that we enquire, To what End Nature has consigned so continual a province,
That the Blood is not the General Nourishment of the body. Because
as this of Sanguification, to that subtle Agent, the Vital Spirit; or, more
plainly, of what Use the Blood is, in Sanguineous Animals. Concerning this,
there are (for ought we know) but Two opinions extant; the One, that the Blood
is the general Nutriment of the body, or Matter by which the substance of the
parts is daily instaurated; the Other, that it serves both for the maintenance
of the vital Flame, which cannot subsist without a perpetual supply of
convenient fuel; and for the refection of vital spirits. The Former, though
very ancient, and generally embraced; yet (in our judgment) deserves to give
place to the Latter: because though the Latter be new, and as it were of but
yesterdayes standing, yet it has much more of probability, as may be evinced
by these ensuing Arguments.

The contrary opinion is subject to sundry both inexplicable difficulties, and
irreconcilable incongruities.
that Aristotle, in many places of his works, has earnestly contended,
Sanguinem esse ultimum totius corporis alimentum, that the blood is the
ultimate, or most perfect Aliment of the whole body: and that the whole School
of Physicians has given its suffrage to verify that his Tenent. And yet many
things, not easy to be explicated, and less easy to be reconciled one to
another, may be observed to attend thereupon. For, Physicians, when, in their
Physiological discourses, they treat of the nature of the Blood and endeavor
to make good, that it serves to no other use, but only to afford Nutriment to
the body; they suppose it to be a substance, not simple and homogeneous, but
mixed and compounded of Four several juices, promiscuously flowing together in
the same streams: deducing their principal argument hereof, from the
Combinations of the Four First Elementary Qualities (as they call them) and
accordingly teaching, that the ingredients of blood are the two sorts of Bile,
or Choler (viz. the yellow, and the blackish) Phlegm, and Blood properly so
called. Further, of each of these different humors, They make some Nutritive
(as assuming the whole body to be made up of them) others Excrementitious: and
then They decree, that the blood does consist of those diverse Nutritious
humors, as of Heterogeneous parts. After, though they allow the Phlegm to be
the colder and cruder part, and so capable of conversion into good and laudable
blood, by more intense heat, and longer concoction; and likewise allow the
Choler to be convertible into Melancholy, by adustion; and blood to be
convertible into both choler and melancholy, by the same means: yet will they
by no means admit of a regression of either Choler or Melancholy into blood.
Now, if these things be true (as may well be doubted) and that there is no
possible regresse of Melancholy into Choler, nor of Choler into laudable Blood:
then will it inevitably follow, that all the other three juices are but only in
Order to Melancholy: and that Melancholy is the principal and most perfectly
concocted Aliment. Nay more, They must grant two sorts of Blood; the one, the
whole mass of blood contained in the veins, and composed of those four
humors: The other, the more pure, more florid, and more spiritual part
thereof, which in a stricter sense they call blood, and which some will have to
be contained only in the heart and arteries, apart from the venous blood, as
deputed to peculiar and more noble Uses. Now, according to this distinction, it
is manifest, that not the pure arteriall blood is the nourishment of the body,
but the baser, composed of diverse juices, or rather chiefly the Melancholy; to
which as to their ultimate term* or perfection the three others tend. And how
incongruous it is, to conceive, that the body is nourished, either with impure
juices, or with Melancholy a cold dry and earthly humor as they define it: is
obvious to men of even the shallowest understandings.

There are sundry parts, into who^e substance the blood is not admitted.
then certainly no part could be nourished, at which the blood does not arrive:
but we see that many parts are nourished, as the Brain, Bones, Nerves,
Ligaments, Testicles, etc. to which notwithstanding the blood is not so
brought, as to be admitted into their substance: and therefore the blood is not
the Universal Nourishment. We ^ay, so as to be admitted into their very
substance; for though blood be found in those parts, yet does it not penetrate
deeply into them, as the Nutritive juice ought to do: lib. de Alimento.
alimenti enim vis (says Hippocrates) ad ossa usque pervenit, and ossium
parts. The blood does, indeed, touch upon those parts, in its running round
the body; and but only touch them; and for this reason, that all the parts may
be cherished and enlivened by the Vital Spirits, which it carries along with
it. Thus, in the Brain, veins are no where found, but disseminated upon the
Membranes, that are their support; the Plexus Choroides and some other few
places excepted. Which perhaps is the reason, 1 Hist. an. c. 16.
why Aristotle denied any blood to be contained in the brain; because it is not
effused into the substance thereof, as it is into the fleshy or musculous parts.

(3) Men that are fat and plump, Fat men generally have the least blood, and
Lean the most.
have but fleshy and musculous parts, as being firm and solid, drink up the
least quantity of blood in their pores, and so there remains the more for the
fuel of the Vital Lamp. Whereas, on the contrary, gross and fat persons,
suffer great damage by large effusion of blood; because the habit of their
bodies being despoyled of Spirits and hotter blood, is filled with serous
humors, and so easily degenerateth into a Cachexy. In like manner, in a gross
body, where are more parts to be nourished, there ought to be the more blood to
nourish them: but gross men, for the most part, eat much less, than lean;
because they have less veins, and being inclined to sedentary and unactive
lives, they consume but few Spirits. For it is but a small portion of the
Chyle, that is, converted into the Succus Nutritious (the dissipation of the
substance of the parts, being neither so sudden, nor great, as has been
vulgarly conceived, as we formerly explicated) and the rest, after its
unprofitable parts are separated, being brought to the heart, is mostly
consumed in Spirits. Such things, therefore, as relieve the Spirits, suddenly
satisfy our hunger; as good wine. 2 Sect. Aph. 36.
Whence that Aphorism of Hippocrates; Famem, vini potio solvit: because wine
revives the Spirits.

Men perishing by famine, have their arteries and veins full of blood.
good store of blood has been found in the veins and arteries. Which were
impossible if blood were the nourishment of the body: for, then no Animal could
perish by famine, while it had any blood in its vessels: nor could the body be
so emaciated, in consumptions, while the veins contain so plentiful a source
for the resarcition of the parts. Which reason, among others, induced Dr.
Harvey, de gener. Animal exercit. 52.
to conclude; etsi sanguis sit pars corporis, non tamen huic nutriendo solum
destinatur* Enimvero, si huic duntaxat usui inserviret, nemo fame periret,
quamdiu sanguinis quicquam in venis reliquum habetur: quemadmodum and lucernae
flammula non extinguitur, quamdiu inflammabilis olei in ea vel minimum suppetit.

(5) If the blood were changed into Ros and Cambium, as they call them; The
blood continues red and florid, in the habit of the body.
then, certainly,

(6) Hippocrates has a singular observation, libr. 5. Epid^m. ^. 25.
of a certain man, a patient of his, who being much emaciated, and every day
more and Hippocrates cured a man of extreme Leanness, only by profuse
Phlebotomy.
notwithstanding the most restorative aliment he could take; was at length
cured, only by a very profuse eduction of blood out of the veins of each arm,
after all other means had been in vain attempted. Which would not have happened,
if the blood were the nutriment of the parts. The reason of this admirable cure
seems to be this. There is (as we have more than once declared) a twofold
expense of the Chyle: one part goes to the instauration of the parts, as being,
or constituting the Succus Nutritious; the other supplies the Vital Spirits,
under the form of blood. Now when one of these exceeds, the other languishes;
and the too plentiful exhaustion of the Chyle, upon the blood being the cause
of this man's Leanness, his recovery succeeded upon a turning of the stream of
the Chyle upon the parts for their sufficient Nutritive juice.

The blood is observed to be less unctuous and glutinous, in the Arteries, that
carry it to the parts; than in the veins, that return it from them.
unctuous, and glutinous blood be most accommodate to that use: for, the serum
hinders the apposition of the blood, and therefore Ichorous and weeping Ulcers
are seldom consolidated. Now, the blood is observed to be more unctuous and
glutinous in the veins, than in the arteries, in which it is commonly more
diluted, and full of serum: but the blood is carried to the habit of the body
by the arteries, and from thence brought back again by the veins. Which,
certainly, is a very weighty argument, against the Blood's being the
nourishment.

There is a manifest Dissimilitude betwixt the blood, and sundry parts of the
body.
there ought to be a certain Analogy, or similitude; according to that old
saying, Parts quaslibet alimento ipsis maxim consimili enutriri: but betwixt
the blood and several parts of the body, instead of this requisite resemblance
or affinity of qualities, there is in many things a perfect Dissimilitude or
disparity. For, if we compare the blood, with the brain, the Horny coat, or
Humors of the Eyes, the Bones, tendons, and other the like parts, we shall find
little or no proportion, or resemblance betwixt them. In an Appolexy, where the
brain is overflowed with blood effused into the substance of it, all the ideas
or marks of things formerly known, are quite obliterated, nor does any
perception of them remain. Likewise when the eye is bloud-shodden, the
perspicuity of the coats of the eye is changed into opacity, and the
transmission of the visible species through them hindered. The bones also are
so many ways discrepant from the blood, that it seems impossible they should
be constituted thereof. And of the tendons, Nervs, membranes, etc. the same may
be said.

(9) The Manner of Nutrition, is a certain The prog^ess of Nutrition, is from
crudity, to fusion and volatility; not retrograde from volatility to fixation:
and so the Aliment ought to be more crude, or fixed, than the parts to be
nourished.
to the state of concoction, or an Exaltation of its Spirits to a further
degree of activity. And therefore, the aliment must of necessity be more crude,
than the part therewith nourished. For, that promotion is not by any
degradation, or Fixation of the Spirits of the aliment; but by an Exaltation or
reduction of them nearer to volatility. Forasmuch therefore, as the Spirits
already in the blood, are approached or advanced nearer to the state of
volatility, than those contained in the parts above mentioned: certainly, the
blood cannot be thought a convenient nourishment for them. The redintegration
of those parts ought to be expected from such nutriment, as is more fixed than
themselves are: Otherwise how could it suffice to the solidation or firmation
of them* But, the blood is of a more rough and grating nature, and its spirits
more advanced toward volatility, than those residing in the solid parts: and in
that respect is wholly unfit to nourish them. Moreover, it is necessary, the
Nutritive juice should be sequestered from the blood, before it can be
opportunely brought and apponed to the parts: if so, to what end was it admixt
to the blood at all? shall we believe, that Nature (rather than seem idle) does
make any thing, only that she may unmake it again afterward?

The blood is it self nourished, and does consume the substance of the solid
parts: and so cannot be their nourishment.
nor can that which is the cause of the exhaustion of the solid parts, be the
matter of their redintegration. That the blood is it self nourished, is
manifest from the large access of Chyle to it, after every meal: and that it is
the cause of the exhaustion of the solid parts, is also manifest from hence,
that the Vital Heat, whose subjectum inhaesionis is the blood, is the only
consumer or depredator of the solid substance of the body. For, whatever be the
effects of the Vital Heat, residing in the blood, as its proper and original
subject; the very same may be justly imputed also to the Blood itself. For,
albeit we sometimes ascribe the actions of things to their Qualities, or
Faculties; thereby indicating the Formal Reason, or Manner; by which the
substance operateth: yet we cannot deny, but it is the very substance it self,
to which those Qualities are inherent, that really performs the action. It is
the blood it self, therefore, which by reason of its inherent Heat, does
uncessantly prey upon the substance of the solid parts, and causes them to
make provision for their reparation, even after they have attained to their
perfect magnitude. Nor does it only so, but it moreover, in case of famine,
converts the solid substance of the parts into its own, supplying its defects
out of their decays. This is manifest, in long abstinence from meat, when
though the habit of the body be extenuated, yet (provided the person take
water, or some other thin liquor, that may be a vehicle of the Humors) do the
arteries and veins continue full of blood. Thus also in Fevers, though the
stomach be so weak, as to abhor all things but small beer, or cooling Juleps;
yet does the blood all that while repair it self, by colliquating the substance
of the solid parts, and converting it into its own. For, how otherwise could
the streams of blood be daily replenished? And, that they are replenished, is
evident from hence, that though the quantity of blood be diminished
(proportionately to the strength of the patient) by Phlebotomy, in the
beginning of the Fever: yet will it be again, in a day or two after, so
increased, as to require a second, and perhaps a third diminution; and that,
notwithstanding the sick person has received little or no no^rishment all that
while. An undeniable argument, that the blood, in that defect of supplies from
the Chyle, does repair it self out of the spoils of the solid parts. Now, since
the blood does exhaust and depredate the solid parts; how can it consist with
reason, that it should be their nourishment?

The First Matter, of which the parts are made, is not Blood; but a certain
liquid juice, very like the white of an Egg.
For, what is superadded to the parts, as they are augmented, is of similar
substance with that, which was praeexistent in them, and so of necessity must
be constituted ex congenere ma^eria. Now, the Materia prima of all the parts,
is not blood, but a certain liquid juice, perfectly resembling the White of an
Egg, of which the Chicken is formed; only with this difference, that in
viviparous Animals that Liquor is more thin, and like the Colliquamentum in
Eggs, after the Hen has fitten upon them some days. For even Viviparous
Animals conceive a kind of Egg in their wombs, which is involved in a thin
membrane, and contains a certain viscid humor, very like the White of Eggs,
attenuated and melted by the warmth of the Hens incubation. And this Liquor is
the very matter of which the Embryo is first formed: but very unlike the blood,
in substance, color, and all other qualities. As therefore the parts are not
made up of blood, at first; so are they not augmented or nourished by it
afterward.

We said, That the blood is not the General Nutriment Nevertheless the blood
may be the Nourishment of such parts, whose substance is mostly sanguineous:
and what those are.
thereby admitting, that it may be the Particular nutriment of some parts. For,
as to the Parenchymata Sanguinea, the parts whose substance is chiefly
Sanguineous; forasmuch as they seem to consist mostly of the thicker parts of
blood coagulated in them, and affixt to their vessels and fibers; and that they
have no Nervs derived unto them, through which the Succus Nutritious might be
imported into them: we conceive, that the decay of their sanguineous particles,
is daily repaired by the fresh opposition and affixation of the like particles
of the blood. And in this account, we reckon the Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, Heart,
Lungs, and red parts of the Muscles. Yet in all these, whatsoever of Fibers,
Membranes, or Vessels, is found commixt with their Parenchyma or Sanguineous
substance; all that is to be excluded from the capacity of being nourished by
the blood. But, as for all the Fibrous, Membranous, and Nervous parts of the
body, and all the Parenchymata Sanguinea, as the Brain, Spinal Marrow, the
Humors of the Eyes, Teeth, Bones, and Glandules; it is most probable (from the
reasons alleged) that they are nourished, not by the blood, but by some
sweeter, softer, and milder liquor, congenerous to the spermatick matter, or
Colliquamentum, of which they are originally constituted; which is daily
brought and effused or instilled into their substance, out of the Nervs
inserted into them. But of this distribution of the Succus Nutritious, by the
Nervs, we shall have opportunity to discourse more particularly hereafter.

The manner, how the Vital Heat is conserved; and the Vital Spirits continually
recruited, ex sanguine.
Why truly (according to the latter opinion recited) we conceive it to serve
both as the Pabulum, or Fuel of the Vital Flame, and as the Matter of which
the Spirits Vital are confected. Concerning the manner, how Flame is maintained
by its Fuel; we have already plainly, though succinctly, discoursed. And, as
for the Manner how the Vital Spirits are continually recruited, ex Sanguine;
we may understand it to be thus. The Spirits, contained in our solid aliment,
being at their first admission into the stomach, crude or in the state of
Fixation; are soon after, partly by admistion of Liquids, and partly by
Fermentation, promoted, from the state of Fixation, to that of Fusion. In this
state, the richer or more nutritive parts of the solid aliment, being, by way
of Liquation, thoroughly commixed with the drink; there resulteth a certain
milky juice, called the Chyle; which is a Liquor abounding with sweet, mild and
delicate Spirits. Now these Spirits, so soon as they are brought to the Heart,
and there commixt with the Vital blood; are by little and little exalted to a
third state, viz. that of Volatility; and so become fit subjects to entertain
the Vital Heat, and want only another recourse to the heart, to be therein, as
it were by accension, advanced to the height and dignity of perfect vital
Spirits. For, the Vital Spirits^ differ from the Spirits contained in our
aliment, no otherwise than in the gradual preparations and exaltations now
mentioned. We are to advertise moreover, that the Heart, in its Systole, is not
contracted so closely or straightly, as to expel all the blood contained in
its Ventricles, at once: but leaves a good part thereof remaining in them,
after the contraction is ended. And that this remaining blood does heat and
kindle the portion of blood next effused out of the veins into those
ventricles; and by that means exalt it to the condition of Vital blood. We
further observe, that in the Spirits of the blood, there are sundry degrees of
volatility; so that some attain to the highest degree of volatility much
sooner, than others; and none, until they have undergone several
Circulations, and as many fresh Accensions in the Heart. For, in every
Circulation they grow more and more subtle and agile; and so must at length be
brought to the requisite height of volatility. To which having once attained,
in the very next Circulation (though they are restrained and kept in, by the
sides of the heart, and coats of the arteries, while they remain therein) being
diffused upon the outward parts of the body, as they warm and vivify those
parts, so do they soon fly away, and disperse themselves into air. And while
these thus fly away, other Spirits less volatile are, by the colder
temperament of the parts, by which they pass, somewhat repressed: so that the
force of their expansive motion is much abated, the Mication or panting of the
blood interrupted, and the blood wherein they are, of Arterial, or vital blood,
is made venouse or Natural; and such it continues, until the next circulation
bring it again to the heart, there to be kindled afresh, and exalted to the due
heat of vitality. Which once acquired, it recovers its intermitted motion of
Mication, or rising and falling alternately, and yields a fresh supply of
spirits vital; which being transmitted to the habit of the body, are soon
dispersed, like the former.

The Reason of the Mication, or panting motion of the Blood, in the arteries.
than a continual dissipation of the most votatile spirits of the blood. For,
that vital Heat arises from within, and the most subtle spirits are the first
Movers to the excitement thereof: the motion by which they do it, being their
endeavor to expand themselves, and to dilate their bounds, while the other
grosser elements, or ingredients of the blood, oppose them therein. And this
strife, or Counter-activity of the spirits, on one part, and of the grosser
ingredients of the blood, on the other, does exhibit the general Essence of
Heat. To which may be added this short observation, that in this Contention,
one while the spirits prevailing, do lift up, or swell the mass of blood;
another while the grosser elements (the contraction of the Heart and arteries
assisting them) prevailing, countermand and interrupt that expansive motion:
and that by this alternate conquest of these Antagonists, is made the Mication
or Rising and Falling of the blood, the one in the Dilatation, the other in the
Contraction of the Heart and arteries. Forasmuch, therefore, as the vital Heat
does consist in the rarefactive motion of the spirits, and the renitence of the
grosser parts of the blood; and that the spirits, for the most part, at least
alternately, obtain the victory and dominion over their opponents: it seems
most consentaneous to truth, that this vital Heat cannot be preserved, without
a perpetual expense of the most pure, i.e. the most volatile spirits of the
blood; and consequently necessary, that during life, fresh spirits must be
perpetually minted out of the blood, to defray that vast and continual expense.
And this we conceive to be the true progress of Nature, from the first
reception of the spirits contained in the Aliment, to their education into the
Chyle, their sublimation in the heart, their gradual exaltation to the highest
degree of volatility, and lastly their dissipation through the skin into aer:
upon which depends the Conservation of the vital Heat, and the continual
Generation of the vital Spirits.

OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD; ITS CONDITIONS AND CAUSES. Exercitation the Sixth.
Of the Motion of the Blood, its Conditions and Causes.
The Method of the Chapter.
and Means conducing to that End, always closely connected in one idea) having
ordained the perpetual generation of this vital Nectar, the Blood, in Animals,
for the Uses, in the precedent Chapter recited: that she might not be deficient
in the means requisite to fulfill those Uses, has also ordained, that the
blood should be carried from the Fountain to all the parts, in living streams,
by a certain admirable Motion, necessary to its distribution through the whole
body. Now, that we may fully understand the nature of this Motion, we are to
consider (1) the Manner; (2) the Conditions; (3) the Causes of it.

That the Motion of the blood is Circular;
that the blood is continually carried, or rather driven from its fountain, the
Heart, in the center of the body, by the Arteries, to the circumference; and
back again from the circumference, to the center, by the veins, irrigating,
cherishing, and vivifying all the parts, as it passes along: and that
therefore, this Motion was, by the glorious Inventer of it, Dr. Harvey, called
the Circulation of the blood; quod, Ejus enim semper redeat labor actus in
orbem.

For, in the first place, From the Vena Cava, into the right Ventricle of the
heart.
the blood is effused

From the right ventricle of the heart, it is From the right Ventricle, by the
Vena arteriosa, into the Lungs:
and so into the Lungs; but not through the septum transversum, or middle
partition of the heart, as some have imagined, conceiving the same to have some
certain obscure passages from the right into the left ventricle; only because
they could, without much violence, thrust a style, or probe through it: when,
indeed, those passages are not made by Nature, but by the point of the probe;
the flesh of the heart being so tender, as that it is easily penetrated, by any
hard and pointed instrument though but gently intruded.

Passing through the vena arteriosa into the very substance of the Lungs; the
blood is immediately From the Lungs, through the Arteria Venosa, into the left
Ventricle:
and through that into the Left ventricle of the Heart. This is demonstrable
thus, Having made a ligature upon the great branch of the Arteria venosa; near
the pericardium, in the lungs of an Animal yet living; you may observe that
branch to be soon filled and much distended with blood, in that part, which is
toward the lungs, and that emptied and flaccid, that is next the heart: and
upon remove of the ligature, the blood will flow amain from the lungs to the
left ventricle. Now, there being no other way, by which this blood can flow to
the left ventricle, but from the lungs: it must of necessity descend thence, by
the Arteria venosa.

From the left ventricle, into the great Artery, and thence into the smaller
Arteries.
the heart instantly contracting it self, expels the same (at least, good
part thereof) into the Great Artery (arising from the left ventricle) thence
into the lesser arteries, and so into the substance of the flesh; from whence
the blood is intruded into the capillary veins, by them into the greater veins,
from them into the vena Cava, and at length into the right ventricle of the
heart, there to begin the same circular progress again.

the substance of the Flesh. From the smallest Arteries, through the substance
of the flesh, into the smallest veins.
For, as to those, who will have the blood to pass out of the small arteries,
into the small veins, per Anastomoses, by certain inosculations, or open
passages from those into these: we challenge them to demonstrate to the sense,
any such way of intercourse or communication betwixt arteries and veins, in the
whole habit of the body; and Dr. Harvey did the same before us, when He said,
De Anastomosi venarum and arteriarum, de mot. cord. and sang. cap. 9.
ubi sit, and quomodo sit, and qua de caussa, neminem hactenus recte quicquam
dixisse, suspicari licet. And why may not the blood be as well conceived, to
permeate through the pores of the flesh, as water through the pores of the
earth, the sweat through the skin, the serum through the parenchyma of the
Kidneys, or as the same blood through the thick substance of the Liver.

Nor is only that blood brought back to the heart, by the vena Cava, How the
New-made blood is circ^^lated with (...) old.
which passed through

Again, the Heart seems to immit more blood That more blood passes through the
heart, in an hour, than can be supplied from the chyle, in several days.
in the space of one hour, than the proportion of Chyle can amount to, in
several days. For, in most men, the Heart makes more than 3000. pulses, in an
hour; and at every systole it expells some blood out of its left ventricle into
the Aorta; as may be sensibly demonstrated by this, that upon a ligation of the
Aorta, near the heart, and an incision made betwixt the ligature and the heart,
you may observe some quantity of blood (more or less) to be squirted forth by
the incision, at every systole, unless the heart be grown weak and languid;
and yet even in that case, some quantity of blood will issue forth at the hole,
once in 3 or 4 pulses. Nay, when the cone or point of the heart is cut off, and
the heart held upright; though the ventricles be not then full, yet will some
blood be squeezed out of them, every time the heart contracts it self, 2 cap.
de. mat. cord. and sanguin.
and that to the distance of 3 or 4 feet, as Dr. Harvey observes.

Quantity of blood admitted into the ventricles of the heart, when it is
dilated, The Necessity of the Circulation inferred from three considerations,
viz.
and expelled into the Great Artery, when it is again contracted; it cannot be
precisely determined. For, if in the same individual person, the motion of the
heart, being sometimes more strong and swift, and sometimes more weak and slow,
does make the Circulation of the blood more swift, or more slow
proportionately: certainly in the species, it must be impossible to
commensurate the quantity of blood passing through the heart, at every pulse;
since there is great variety among men, in respect of their different
temperaments, ages, sexes, diet, exercises, passions; and the like, all which
vary the pulse, and consequently the motion of the blood. However, that some
satisfaction may be given to enquirers herein, we are to consider Three things,
viz. (1) How much blood may be contained in the heart of a Man, in its
Diastole; (2) How much may be expelled out of it, in its Systole; (3) and How
many Pulses, or Diastole's and Systoles, the heart does commonly, in healthy
and temperate men, make in an hour.

Concerning the First; the quantity of blood contained in the heart, in its
Diastole;
there are different observations. Harvey says, that in a man's heart dilated,
he found more than two ounces of blood. Plempius affirms, that he found almost
two ounces. Riolan will allow scarce half an ounce, in the left ventricle; but
somewhat more in the right. And Hogeland comes much lower, admitting only one
dragme. But, all men generally grant, that the whole mass of blood contained
in the body, does seldom exceed 24 pounds, or pints, and as seldom come short
of 15.

Concerning, the quantity expelled out of it, in its Systole.
the Second; we say, that in every systole is expelled either the fourth or
fifth or sixth, or at least the eighth part of the blood received into the
heart, at the precedent Diastole. Harvey supposes at least one dragme, and
proves that his supposition from the sudden effusion of all the mass of blood,
if but the least artery be cut: and because all the blood may be transmitted
through the heart, in the space of half an hour, He thereupon concludes for
certain, that much blood is expelled into the great Artery, at every systole.
Conringius also makes the same compute. Walaeus and Sleyelius admit half an
ounce: but compute only from one scruple. Hogeland acquiesceth in one dragme.
And Thom. Bartholinus brings it down to only half a scruple. But they all
agree, that in the contraction of the heart, the sides of the ventricles are
not drawn so close together, as to expel all the blood contained in them.

Concerning the Third, The Number of Pulses, in the space of an hour.
we remember, that Primrose reckons 700. pulses in an hour; Riolan 2000; Waleus
and Regius 3000. Cardan 4000; Plempius 4450; Sleyelius 4876; Bartholinus 4400,
or thereabouts; and Harvey about 2000; each one numbering the pulses in his own
wrist.

Now, from these three things premised we may collect how much blood may be
expelled out of the left ventricle of the heart, into the Aorta, in the space
of one hour, according to the several numerations of pulses viz. From j 3000
times repeated there arise lb 10 5 Of blood passing thorough the heart into the
arteries, in one hour. j 4000 lb 13 10 5 j j 4450 lb 15 3 j ss 4400 lb 7 7 5 j
j 2000 lb 20 10 ij 2000 lb 41 8 ss 2000 lb 83 4 j 2000 lb 166 8

Again, setting it down for a ground, that the quantity of blood contained in
the whole body, does amount only to lb 15. (for that is according to the most
modest account) and allowing some part thereof to be consumed by the Lamp of
life, and as much to be supplied out of the Chyle: we may infer these 4
necessary Conclusions. (1) That more blood is transmitted through the heart,
once in every hour, than can be supplied out of the Chyle, in many hours. (2)
That all the blood in the body is transmitted through the heart, once in a
quarter, or half, or a whole hour, or in two hours at most. (3) That so much is
not required to the conservation of the vital Flame, and the confection of
vital spirits. (4) That, since the vessels are not broken, that the blood
cannot return back out of the heart, nor be any ways dissipated: it is
absolutely necessary, that the blood must return to the heart again by the
veins, or be Circulated perpetually, as the immortal Dr. Harvey has
demonstrated.


Nor is this Circulation of the blood only Particular to some Arteries and
Veins (as some have inconsiderately imagined) but Universal, That the
Circulation is Universal, in all the Arteries and veins of the whole body.
throughout the whole body. For though it be, indeed, more demonstrable to the
sense in the Limbs, where the vessels being ample and conspicuous, admit of
ligatures more conveniently, than those in the Inwards: yet does observation
teach us, that the motion of the blood is the very same in the very Entralls
also. In particular (that we may deduce it through the most conspicuous
Arteries and veins of other interior parts, beside those already mentioned) the
blood is carried, in the Abdomen, to the Testicles, by the spermatick Arteries:
from them, by the spermatick veins, into the left Emulgent and vena Cava.
Intestines, by the Mesenterick Arteries: from them, by the Mesenterick veins,
into the Ramus Mesentericus, and thence into the vena Portae. Spleen, by the
left Celiacal Artery: from it, by the Ramus splenicus, into the vena Portae,
and thence directly into the Liver. Stomach and Omentum, by other branches of
the Celiacal Artery: from them, by the Gastrick and Epiploical veins, into the
Ramus splenicus; thence into the vena Portae, and so to the Liver. Kidneys, by
the Emulgent Arteries: from them, by the Emulgent veins, into the vena cava.
Outside of the Heart, by the Coronary Artery: back again, by the Coronary vein,
into the vena Cava.
Thorax, to the Pleura, by the Intercostal Arteries: from it, by the veins
thereof, into the vena Azygos, and thence into the vena Cava. Head to the
Membranes of the Brain, by the Carotides and Neck-Arteries (which tend to the
four Cells of the brain, but are not therein terminated, as some Anatomists
have thought:) from them, by the jugular veins, into the ascendent trunck of
the VENA CAVA.



All which is discoverable to the sense, by binding those vessels, in Animals
cut up alive. For, the swelling, caused in either vein or Artery, by the flux
of blood there arrested, will always appear on that side the ligature, from
whence the blood flows.

Here we are to advertise, that in the Foetus, or Infant-unborn, the manner of
the Circulation But, after a peculiar manner in an Infant unborn.
through the vessels of the Heart, is different from that we have described.
For the blood is not carried from the Mothers womb, into the Umbilical
Arteries; but from the Placenta Uterina (in which those Arteries are
terminated) into the Umbilical vein: which conducteth it along to the Liver of
the Foetus, from whence it is transmitted by the Vena Cava into the right
Ventricle of the heart. Being brought thither, it is transferred into the Vena
Arteriosa: but, because the Lungs are not yet moved, as after the birth, in
respiration; and so their vessels are not dilated and contracted alternately,
and consequently they can neither receive the blood out of the Vena Arteriosa,
not impell it into the Arteria Venosa: therefore has the providence of Nature
contrived and framed Two peculiar passages, the one a conduit or pipe,
conveying the blood from the Vena Arteriosa, into the Great Artery; the other
certain foramen, hole, or inlett, by which the blood passes from the Vena Cava
into the Arteria Venosa, thence into the left Ear of the heart, and so down
into the left Ventricle. From thence (as well as that from the Vena Arteriosa)
it is infused into the Great Artery. So that in an unborn Infant, Nature uses
the two Ventricles of the heart, as if they were but one: and this, lest the
infant should have his Blood too hot and adust, while he wants the ventilation
of the air, and expulsion of fuliginous exhalations, through the Lungs. From
the Great Artery, the blood is sent into the Umbilical Arteries, which return
it to the Placenta Uterina; where permeating the substance thereof, it is again
infused into the small branches or (rather) roots of the Umbilical vein, by
them into the trunk, and at length into the Liver, Vena Cava, and Heart, as
before.

This Motion of the blood, is
it follows, that we consider the CONDITIONS of that its motion. Concerning
which, we observe that the Circulation of the blood is,

(1) Continual. Continual;
For, since the Heart is continually in motion, and takes in blood, in its
Diastole, and discharges the same again, in its Systole, never intermitting
that its proper action, but in great swooning fits, or in the very article of
death: it is necessary, that the motion of the blood be likewise continual.

(2) Vehement; as may be inferred from the vehement;
or vein bound with a ligature. For, nothing can be distended to great
hardness, by a thin and liquid matter, especially upward, unless that matter be
with vehemence impelled into, and retained in it. But, this vehemence of the
motion is greatest near the heart, and is afterward diminished by degrees,
according to the several degrees of distance from the heart; so that the
extreme arteries have but little pulse, unless it happens, that the impellent
force of the heart be increased, as in Fevers, Inflammations, Violent exercise,
some passions, etc. Which is also the reason, why the veins have no pulse, the
impulse of the blood being less in them, than in the smallest arteries.

(3) Swift. swift;
For, an artery or vein being compressed number of Pulses, and the quantity of
blood expelled out of the left ventricle of the heart, in every systole, That
the whole mass of blood does pass through the heart once in an hour or two, at
most. Yet is not the current of blood near so swift in its channels, while they
are whole, as when one of them (vein or artery) is cut: because in that case,
the blood streams forth into the free and easily-yielding aer, without any
resistance; but being confined in its vessels, it is forced to distend them,
and drive-on the foregoing current.

As swift in the Veins, as in the Arteries. For, Of equal velocity in the
Arteries and veins.
though the impulse be more vehement in the atteries, as being continued to the
heart, than in the veins; and therefore it might seem reasonable, at first
consideration, that the motion should be proportionately more swift in the
arteries: yet, considering, that the Arteries are still smaller and smaller
toward their extremities, and that the flux of the blood must needs be more and
more retarded, as it approaches those extremities; and on the contrary, that
the veins grow wider and wider, from their extremities, to the center of the
body, and so the blood has still larger and larger spaces to run through, in
its return to the heart; we may safely conclude (conjecturally) that the
velocity of the motion is as great in the veins, as in the arteries. This is
also confirmed by sense; for, the Vena Cava, in all that tract from the Liver,
to the subclavian division, may be observed to beat, as often as the Great
Artery; and so must import blood into the right Ventricle, as fast as the Aorta
does export it from the left. Which doubtless is the reason, why the Vena Cava
has fleshy Fibers upon it, when it approaches the heart. Nevertheless, we
conceive the motion to be swifter in the Arteries, when the heart contracting
it self, does impell the blood into and through them; than when, dilating it
self again, it does intermit that its impulse. Which is true likewise of the
blood in the veins, as may be sometimes observed in Phlebotomy, when the
ligature is not so straight, as to cause much distension of the vein, in which
the incision is made: for, in that case, the blood will flow forth more swiftly,
every time the heart is contracted. And these are the Conditions of this
admirable motion of the blood.

Lastly, concerning the CAUSE of this motion; it is necessary that the blood be
moved either by it self, or by some other principle: and if it be the Author of
its own motion, then that must be in respect of either an inherent
motive-Faculty, or of its Ebullition, or of its Rarefaction, or of its
Quantity, whereby the Ventricles of the heart are distended, and so irritated
as to discharge the same, by contracting themselves. If the motion be derived
from an External principle; then it must be referred either to Attraction, or
to Vection, or to Pulsion. Let us, therefore, see which of all these may be the
most likely cause of the Motion of the blood.

First, That the blood is not the cause of its own Motion, The blood, not the
cause of its own motion, in respect of any motive Faculty, inherent in it.
ratione insitae sibi Facultatis, by reason of any inherent Faculty; may be
inferred from hence, that in blood effused out of its vessels into the body, or
any other receiver, no motion at all can be observed: and it is hard to
conceive, that it should be so corrupted in a moment, as wholly to lose a
faculty essential to it. Dr. Harvey, we confess, affirms, that he observed a
certain obscure motion of the blood, in the right ear of the Heart (where He
supposes the motion of the Heart first to begin, and last to end) after the
Ear had ceased to move; but we refer that to the Mication of the blood from the
Vital Spirits not yet wholly extinguished.

Secondly, That it is not the Author of its own motion, Nor, in respect of its
Ebullition.
ratione Ebullitionis (which Arist. calls (...)) is manifest from these
subsequent reasons. (1) No Ebullition can be constantly equal, or of the same
tenor: but the Pulse of the heart, and so the motion of the blood, is, in
temperate and healthy men, for the most part equal. (2) As the Ebullition is
greater, so would the pulse; but in burning Fevers, the Ebullition is extreme
great, by reason of the great intension of the heat; and yet the pulse is
frequently small, and weak; as also in the beginning of putrid Fevers, as Galen
long since remarked. (3) The blood suffers no ebullition, as it passes through
the heart. For, if in the dissection of a living Animal, you make an incision
either into the left Ventricle of the heart, or into the Great Artery near it;
you shall perceive the blood flowing out at the hole, to be pure and such as
before it came into the heart, not frothy, boiling, or rarefied; and to
continue such as at its first efflux: yea, more, if you receive the blood
issuing from an incision of the Vena Cava, in one sawcer, and that issuing from
the left Ventricle, in another; you shall not be able to discern any difference
betwixt the one and the other, either soon, or a good while after. An
invincible argument against the Ebullition of the blood, first imagined by
Aristotle, and since defended by many great men, his sectators. (4) The
plunging an arm or leg into cold water, would suppress the Ebullition, and
consequently the motion of the blood. For, if you apply a close ligature to a
man's arm, and then immerge the same into cold water, or Snow; upon solution of
the ligature, he shall find the blood returning to his heart, with so great a
sense of cold, as very much to offend him. Which cold arising to the blood,
from its being long detained in the extremities of the arm bound; Dr. Harvey
will have to be the cause of swooning immediately after blood-letting, in many
men; the heart receiving injury from that acquired cold.

Thirdly, Not ratione Rarefactionis; because Nor of its Rarefaction.
where the heart yet continues its motion, no man ever has, or can observe
any such thing as rarefied blood to flow from either the left ventricle, or the
Great Artery, if cut; but pure and such as is from the Ears let down into the
ventrices. (2) The Heart it self, when cut in pieces, or wounded, may be
observed to beat; yet not from any rarefaction of the blood, for then it has
no blood in either of its Ventricles, or Ears. (3) It has been observed in
Dogs, that after the point of the heart has been cut off, and the remainder
turned upside down, though the ventricles could not be half full, the blood
has yet been squirted forth at the top, even to the distance of three or four
feet; which were impossible, in case the rarefaction of the blood were the
cause of its motion. (4) The musculous flesh of the heart, is more firm and
strong, than to be subject to inflation and detumescence, merely from the
rarefaction of the blood. It must be a more forceible Agent, that moves that
great and weighty machine of the heart. (5) If the blood were so much rarefied
in the Ventricles, then certainly ought the orifices of the Vena Arteriosa, and
Aorta, to have been much larger, because the blood would have required more
room for its egress, than for its ingress. (6) The motion of the heart, and of
its valves would be confused; for the Diastole of this, and opening of them,
would happen at the same time, and consequently the valves would become
useless; both which are repugnant to experience. Besides, the opening and
shutting of the valves would be co-incident with the Systole of the Great
Artery. (7) That the blood should be rarefied in the heart, and in a moment
again refrigerated in the arteries; is contrary both to sense and reason: and
if the rarefaction should so soon cease; why is it at all?

It remains, therefore, that if the blood be the efficient of its own motion,
it must be so ratione Quantitatis, But of its Quantity distending the
Ventricles of the heart.
by reason of its quantity filling and distending the Ventricles of the heart,
and irritating them to discharge it, by contracting or shurting themselves.
For, the heart being as it were burdened with the blood distending its
cavities, does contract its Fibers and so its Ventricles, to vindicate it self
from that oppression; no otherwise than the stomach, guts, bladder, womb, etc.
which being extended by meat, chyle, wind, urine, and the infant, drive
themselves together, by the help of their Fibers, and so exclude that was
burdensome to them. And thus is it probable, that the Heart is continually
moved by the blood, like a Mill perpetually agitated by a stream of water;
which stream being cut off, the motion instantly cease. This may be credited
upon the force of this one experiment; if the Vena Cava be intercepted by a
ligature, so soon as the heart has disburdened it self of what blood it has
received from thence, it instantly remitteth its motion; and upon letting in
the stream again, by removing the ligature, it as suddenly recovers it. Than
which there cannot be a more convincing argument, that the quantity of the
blood flowing into the ventricles, is a cause of the motion of the heart, and
so of its own motion.

A Cause; not the only cause: for we shall soon find another efficient as
necessary and immediate, The blood not moved by Attraction;
to the motion, as the blood in the respect mentioned.

That nothing does Attract the blood either to or from the heart, is evident
from hence; that in Nature there is no such thing, as the motion of a body by
attraction; as has been by solid and irrefutable arguments proved by that
heroical wit, Apolog pro circulat sang. advers. Parisan. ^pag. 27. ad 49.
and most, accomplished Scholar, Dr. Ent; and also by our selves, in the
beginning of our discourse of Occult Qualities, whither (for expedition sake)
we referr the unsatisfied.

per modum Vectionis, by way of Carriage, Nor by Vection;
For, nothing can be imagined to carry along the blood in its course, but the
spirits; and those would, in respect of their Levity, carry it only upward: but
we see that the blood is moved also downward, and ad latera.

But by Impulsion of the heart, endowed with a Pulsifick Faculty.
per modum Pulsionis, by impulsion, or protrusion: and the Impellent can be no
other, but the Heart contracting it self, and so expelling the blood contained
in its ventricles into the Great Artery, from whence it is urged, or pressed
forwards into the smaller arteries, by the succeeding current. We conceive,
therefore, that the Heart is endowed with a certain Motive-virtue inhaerent and
essential, called the Pulsifick Faculty, which is conjoined, as a concomitant
cause, with the blood it self, in giving it a due motion: whether it be, that
this Faculty does regulate the influx and efflux of the blood, which would
otherwise be irregular; or that of it self it produces the motion, which
cannot be afterward continued, in case the flux of the blood be once
interrupted. That this Faculty is necessary, may be inferred from these Reasons.

(1) As the Pulse, so the influx of the blood would be always unequal, unless
it were regulated by a Faculty. (2) When the blood is moved vehemently in
Fevers, by the intense heat agitating and urging it; and in men at the point of
death, propter extremos naturae conatus, by reason of Natures agony and last
efforts: yet is the pulse more weak and low, than at other times, because the
Pulsifick Faculty is either much oppressed, or much weakened. On the other side,
though the Faculty continue strong, yet is the influx of the blood much
diminished, after large haemorrhages, or upon great obstructions of the
capillary arteries and veins, in the habit of the body. Which consideration
seems to us sufficient to import the necessity of conjoyning a Pulsifick
Faculty, with the quantity of the blood distending and so molesting the Heart,
as a double proxime cause of the bloods motion.

(3) Though the heart be cut in pieces, yet will each piece have a kind of weak
pulsation, as long as it continues warm; which in all probability is to be
ascribed to the Faculty implanted in all its Fibers, and not yet utterly
destroyed.

(4) It would be derogatory to the majesty of that Prince of all the parts, the
Heart, to be moved by the violent impulse of an external principle, and it self
conduce nothing thereunto.

Notwithstanding these reasons alleged, we dare not set up our rest in this
doctrine of the Ancients, concerning a Pulsifick Faculty implanted in the
heart: only we have recited it, as the most probable Conjecture of all others,
touching this abstruse Argument, the proxime Cause of the Motion of the blood.
Nor shall we adhere to it longer, than until we shall be so happy as to meet
with a more satisfactory solution of that admirable Phenomenon. In the mean
time, Modesty commands us to declare, that we find this Knot to be too hard and
intricate for the teeth of our weak understanding. And well may we make this
acknowledgment, when the subtle Frucastorius, after a long scrutiny into the
same subject, was at length forced to desist, with Motum cordis soli Deo
cognitum esse opinor; and that even Harvey himself professes, that He found it
rem arduam and difficultatibus plenam. We remember the modest sayings of two
great Men, upon the like difficulties; the one of Galen, Quo pacto haec fiaut,
si scrutaberis; lib. 15. de usu part. cap. 1. exercit. 307. number. 29.
convineeris te non intelligere neque tuam imbecissitatem, neque Opificis tui
potentiam: the other of Scaliger, Quandam humanae sapientiae partem esse,
quaedam aequo animo nescire velle; and veram sapientiam, nolle nimium sapere.
And we think, we need say no more, in excuse of this our professed ignorance.

Besides this Twofold Proxime Cause, there Remote one, The Fabrique of the
heart, a remote cause of the motion of the blood.
viz. the Peculiar Conformation, or Fabrique, of the Heart and its vessels.
And among all the parts in this curiously framed Machine of the heart, those
which are most official or instrumental to the motion, are the Fibers and
fleshy columns; which serve not so much to the strength of the heart, as to
the motion of it. For, in the Systole, all the Fibers, both small and great, as
well those in the inside of the ventricles, as those in the Septum, or
partition wall betwixt them (like an artificial network made in the form of a
purse) being contracted, or drawn together; the blood contained in the
ventricles, must necessarily be expelled or pressed out of them.

The Motion of the heart, which is called Pulse, The Motion of the Heart
described; as consisting of two^ contrary motions, and a Respite betwixt them.
as being continual, and made partly by the influx of the blood, partly by the
Pulsifick Faculty residing in the heart it self; does consist of 3 things, the
Systole, the Diastole, and the Perisystole: all which are to be explained by
their proper Causes, according as ocular Inspection, and Reason does dictate
them to the understanding.

(1) The Systole, being the proper and natural motion of the heart, is the
Contraction or drawing together of the heart to a narrower compass, that so the
blood contained in the right ventricle may be expelled through the vena
arteriosa into the Lungs; and that contained in the left, may be expelled into
the Great Artery, and so into all parts of the body.

(2) The Diastole, being a motion only Accidentary to the heart, is a
Dilatation, or opening of the heart, that the blood may flow into the right
ventricle, out of the vena Cava; and into the left, out of the Arteria Venosa.

(3) The Perisystole, is a certain quiet or short respite betwixt the
Contraction and Dilatation of the heart, during the small time, that the blood
is entering into, or issuing out of the ventricles. In healthy men, this pause
is so short, as not to be distinguished from either of the two contrary
motions: but sufficiently manifest in men at the point of death. It is also
double, there being one respite betwixt the Systole and Diastole; and another
betwixt the Diastole and Systole. And this is the natural state of the Heart.

Figure, or Form of the heart in those contrary motions; And the Figure of it
in each.
from the dissection of Animals alive, from the commodity of its motion and
quiet, and from the position of its Fibers and other parts, we have learned it
to be thus.

In the Systole, it may be observed that (1) the point of the heart is drawn
upward toward the Basis of it, in order to the expulsion of the blood; the
length of it being diminished, and breadth proportionately increased: because
the basis is immovable, in respect of the cone, which is fastened neither to,
nor by any vessels. (2) The inner walls, or sides toward the ribbs, are
brought nearer each to other; because they are constringed and made narrower,
as may be perceived by putting a finger into either of the ventricles, at the
time of their contraction: but the outward, becoming tumid, seem to be enlarged
in latitude, from the contraction of all parts inflated in the tension or
stretching. (3) The fore part of the heart is lifted up toward the sternum,
and chiefly near the base; for, where the pulse is felt, there does the heart
strike the breast with its base, that part being lifted up, and brought near to
the sternon: and at the same time (not in the Diastole) is the heart vigorated,
and the arteries dilated and filled; and the pulses are felt both in the breast
and wrist, the Diastole of the Arteries being coincident with the Systole of
the heart. But the Pulse is more plainly felt in the left side, because there
is the origin and orifice of the Aorta. (4) The whole heart becomes tense and
hard, and contracted to a smaller bulk; as is manifest both to the sight, and
to the touch. (5) The heart appears white, especially in imperfect Animals,
such as Serpents, Frogs, Eeles, etc. by reason of the expulsion of the blood in
the Systole.

In the Perisystole, when the heart is soft, lux, and in its proper state, (1)
the cone recedeth from the base; and in some Animals, the base also recedeth
from the cone: (2) The lateral parts, both the interior and exterior, are
tended toward the ribbs: (3) The anterior face of the heart sinks down, and the
posterior is depressed, especially near the orifice of the great Artery.

In the Diastole, which beginns in the middle of the Dilatation, and ends in
the middle of the Contraction. (1) the upper side is lifted up and distended by
the blood falling into the ventricles out of the Vena cava, and Arteria venosa;
the swelling sensibly beginning at the base, and progressing to the cone. But
the base does not them strike the breast, because the Arteries at that instant
are contracted, and the heart cease from expulsion of the blood. (2) The
heart is flaccid and soft, because it is then only passive, in receiving the
blood. (3) The sides become extense, and the cavities enlarged, and therefore
if you put your finger into the heart, during the Diastole, you shall perceive
no constriction, as in the Systole. (4) The heart appears red, because of the
tenuity of its walls, and their repletion with blood. (5) The Cone receding
from the base, makes the heart longer, that it may be more capable of blood.
And thus does the heart vary its Figure, in each of these three positions.

OF THE DEPURATION OF THE BLOOD. Exercitation the Seventh.
Of the Depuration of the BLOOD.
FRom the Circulation of the blood, we (as Nature) advance to the DEPURATION or
Defecation of it, from its unprofitable or excrementitious parts. And here we
are to consider (1) the Generation, (2) The several sorts of Excrements
generated in and to be separated from the blood, (3) The parts in which, and
(4) The Manner how they are separated.

Concerning the FIRST, we observe, that The Genealogy of the Excrements.
consisting of various Elements or material principles (as the Element of which
it is generate) and so not capable to be wholly changed into either the fuel
of the Vital Heat; or Vital Spirits: when those parts of it, which had their
Spirits less closely and firmly united to their grosser Elements, or (which is
the same thing) which were most prone to volatility; are consumed and
dispersed; it cannot be, but that the remains or relics thereof must
thenceforth become not only useless, but also incommodious to Nature, and
therefore as soon as may be, to be rejected. For the sweet and inflammable
Spirits of the blood being exhausted; to what use can the remaining mass serve?
It can be no longer the subject or residence of the Vital Heat, for the
conservation whereof the blood is principally made: nay, if retained in the
body, it would rather damnifie and destroy the same noble principle, the Vital
Heat. For, the Sulphur contained in the blood, does by reason of the continual
mication and endeavor of the Spirits to fly away and disperse themselves, and
of the decocting activity of the Vital Heat exercised upon it, become adust,
and contract a manifest bitterness and acrimony; and the Caput mortuum, or
Terrene and grosser part, conjoined with the Fixative Salt, is apt to coagulate
and to be p^trified; and the Phlegma, or insipid and viscid part is apt to
obstruct the capillary arteries and veins, and so impede the Circulation; and
lastly, the Aqueous part, or potulent matter, as being apt to render the blood
too dilute and serous, is wholly unprofitable. These parts, therefore, being no
longer useful ingredients of the blood, degenerate into Excrements; and ought
to be sequestered from it.

This Generation of the Excrements of the blood, may be appositely adumbrated
by the Example of Wine distilled. For, Exemplified in the destillation of wine.
as Wine is ex Elementis primiceriis, of Various choice ingredients, or
dissimilar parts: so is the blood. As the Spirits or more fugitive parts of
Wine, are easily separable from the more fixed, viz. the Phlegm, Tartar, crass
Sulphur, etc. by heat: so are the Spirits of the blood easily separated from
the more fixed parts of it, viz. the Phlegm, Salt Tartar, crass Sulphur adust,
the Aqueous or potulent matter, by the activity of the Vital Heat. As the
Spirits of Wine are, by repeated destillations, advanced to that height of
Volatility or subtility, as that some of them fly away and are dispersed into
air, in every rectification: so likewise are the Spirits of the blood, by
repeated Circulations through the heart, brought to that degree of subtility
and volatility as that they cannot be longer contained or imprisoned in the
body of an Animal, but penetrating through the pores, are exhaled by way of dry
sweat, or insensible transpiration. And as the residue of the Wine, after the
Spirits are gone, remains a dead mass, or vappa, consisting only of a Phlegm,
Tartar, and crass Sulphur (which by long heat acquireth a bitterness and
acrimony:) so does the residue of the blood, after its Spirits are exhausted
and dispersed. For, (as we said before) the caseous and grumous parts of the
blood, being brought to the state of Fusion, by the Vital Heat, make that
excrement called the Phlegma: the Saline and earthly parts consociated, make
the Tartar, which being dissolved and kept fluid by the potulent matter (to
which it is easily mixed) make the Urine: and the crass sulphur, torrified by
the Vital heat, and inseparably floating in the serum, makes the Bile, or
Choleric excrement. And this Diversity of parts in the blood is evident even
to the sense, in blood let forth of either vein or artery into a vessel. For,
there the caseous or grumous parts (which being most elaborate, and brought to
a certain degree of Fusion, have thereby acquired a viscidity) swim on the top,
in the form of a whitish filme or membrane; while other parts of the same
kind, having not attained to the like degree of Fusion and viscidity, sinck to
the bottom; and the serous or watery (impregnated with the Salt, and somewhat
of the crass Sulphur adust) flow round about the rest.

viz. the various sorts, The Various sorts of those Excrements: and their
Definitions.
or Kinds of Excrements to be separated from the blood, in order to its
purification; though what we have now said, concerning their Original, may seem
to intimate their several Families and specifical Differences: yet will it not
be superfluous to observe further, that all of them, being Liquid, fall under
two General Kinds. The First comprehends the More Thin Excrements, which are
(1) the Urine, impregnated with the Tartar, (2) the Sweat, (3) the Tears, and
(4) the thin liquor contained in the Lympheducts: The Other includes the Less
Thin, which are 1) the Phlegm or ptuituituous Mucus: whether it be Acid, such
as is found in the stomach and guts; or Insipid, such as the Rheum distilling
from the brain by the palate and nose, the spittle, and salivous moisture
excerned from the Glan^ulae sublinguales; (2) the Bile, both that which is
collected in the bladder of the Gall, and that deposed in the cavities of the
Ears, called the Ear-wax; for these two seem to be cousin germans, and
differing only in consistence.

The Urine, is a serous excrement, impregnated with Tartar, and tincted with a
small portion of the Bile; brought by the Emulgent arteries, into the Kidneys,
together with the blood; there separated from the blood, by a kind of
percolation, thence distilling by the Ureters into the bladder, and at length
avoided by the urinary passage.

The Sweat, is likewise a serious excrement, impregnated with a small quantity
of Salt, expulsed out of the capillary arteries into the habit of the body, and
thence excerned through the insensible pores of the skin.

Tears also are a serous and brackish excrement, imported by the arteries into
the Carunculae Lachrymales; or small Glandules, placed in the interior corners
of the Eyes; there separated, by a kind of percolation, from the blood; and
thence expressed, for the most part voluntarily, in grief, and sometimes in
sudden and profuse joy; and sometimes involuntarily, in pain, fevers, etc.

The limpid Liquor found in the Lympheducts (at least a good part thereof) is a
mild and insipid exhalation of the blood in the arteries, sweating through the
coats of the smaller arteries, collected by degrees in the Lympheducts, and by
them again infused into the blood, as well to prevent the coagulation, as to
promote the mication thereof; and after various Circulations, avoided by
evaporation through the skin.

Among the Less Thin Excrements,

The Phlegmatic mucus found in the stomach, is a thick viscid excrementitious
juice, endowed with some Acidity, brought into the coats of the stomach, by
those branches of the Celiacal artery, which are therein terminated there
secerned from the blood, and by transudation immitted into the cavity of the
stomach; to the end, that it may serve to excite the Appetite, and in place of
a Ferment, promote the dissolution and concoction of the meat.

The Pituitous Mucus found in the Guts, is an insipid excrement spewed out of
the Mesenterick arteries, into the substance of the guts, transmitted by
insensible passages into the hollow of them; serving to defend them from the
injuries of the Chyle and excrements of the belly passing through them, and at
length to be excluded together with those excrements, by stool.

That distilling from the Brain, is a pituitous excrement, severed from the
blood brought thither by the Arteries, and excerned either by the Palate, or
nostrills. Such also are the sputum, which falls down from the pituitary
Glandules situate about the basis of the brain: and the saliva, which is
generated of humors imported into the Almonds of the Ears, the Glandulae
sublinguales, and other spongy parts in the jaws and mouth, and therein
separated; for the moystning of the mouth, and softning of the solid meat, in
mastication.

The Bile, or yellow Choler found in the bladder of the Gall, is a bitter
excrement, generated in the blood, of the crass sulphur thereof (dissolved by
the serum) made adust by the vital heat; separated in the Liver, and thence
conveyed by convenient vessels (which we shall particularly mention anon) into
the Intestines, to be excluded with the excrements of the belly.

Lastly, the Ear-wax is a bilious excrement, thick, yellow, and bitter, in
small quantity effused out of the capillary arteries near the Ears, and
collected in the meatus auditorius.

The Material principles, Generation, Differences, The Reason, why each
particular Excrement is determinately imported into the part particularly
comparated for its separation; is
being thus explained; it follows that we now discuss the Manner of their
separation from the blood, in the parts specified, framed by Nature to that
end. Which that we may do with the more satisfaction and perspicuity; it is
requisite, that we premise some short disquisition, as well concerning the
Reason, why such or such Excrements (all being promiscuously blended together,
or flowing confusedly together in the arteries with the blood) are yet carried
into such or such parts, rather than into any others: as concerning the various
ways Nature has contrived, for the separation of Humors each from other, in
the body. For, these Generals being explicated, anticipate the remove of many
of those difficulties and obscurities, that we shall encounter in our scrutiny
into Particulars.

Concerning the Former, therefore, we advertise; that the Reason, why the Acid
Phlegm contained in the blood, is imported rather into the Stomach, than into
the guts; the Insipid Phlegm rather into the Guts, than into the stomach; the
serum into the Kidneys, rather then into the Liver; and the Bile into the
Liver, rather than into either the Stomach, Guts, or Kidneys: we say, the
reason of this, is not that each particular Excrement is so directed, by any
Intelligent Faculty, whose office is to distinguish not only the
excrementitious parts of the blood from the benign and profitable, but also
the excrementitious one from another, and to dispense each to the part ordained
for its separation: nor that each excrement is attracted by and to its like, as
if the Phlegm preexistent in the stomach and guts did, by reason of similitude
of substance, draw to it self those Phlegmatique particles of the blood, that
hold the nearest analogy to its own nature; and so of the serum in the Kidneys,
the Bile in the Liver, Porus bilarius, and bladder of the Gall, etc.

Not by any Intelligence, Not, that it is so directed by any Intelligence, or
distinguishing faculty.
or distinguishing Faculty; because the soul, or Mind (whose Function is only
to rationate, or think) is conscious to her self of all her actions; but no
man's soul is conscious of any such act, as the distinction of Excrements: And
to assign a distinct Faculty to every distinct operation in the body, is (as
that wonder for Wit and Learning, Dr. Ent, acutely said) Deos advocare in
theatrum, ut solvant nodum fabulae.

A course fr^quently taken, and eagerly pursued by many Philosophers even of
the highest form; but, in truth, so manifestly erroneous, as to refute it
self. For, those fruitful imaginations, that first hatched and introduced the
Faculties Attractive, Retentive, Concoctive, and Expulsive; might, if they
pleased, have invented and added as many more to preside over each particular
humor and Excrement in the body, and multiplied them even to infinity: the
difference of those Actions (and indeed of all others done in Animals) arising
really from the different constitutions and structures of the organs, wherein
they are performed.

Nor by Spontaneous Coition, or A^traction Similary; Nor that it is Attracted
by the like Excrement contained in that part:
Simile non potest agere in simile, qua simile; non magis certe, quam in
seipsum. To which we may add, that though many great men have labored much to
assert this opinion of Attraction propte^ (...) by reason of similitude or
familiarity of substance: yet could none of them make it so much as
intelligible; and therefore Regius did well to say, Excrementorum attractio and
spontanea coitio, sunt rejiciendae, quia non sunt manifestae vel
intelligibiles, nec probatae.

To what, then, shall we ascribe this so admirable effect? But, that there is a
certain peculiar Conformity of magnitude and figure, betwixt the minute
particles of this or that Excrement, and the pores of this or that part
constituted for the reception of it.
Why truly, according to the most of probability, to nothing else, but the
Correspondence of Magnitude and Figure betwixt the minute particles of this or
that peculiar excrementitious humor to be separated from the blood, on one
side; and the small passages leading into, and insensible pores in this or that
part, peculiarly constituted for the separation thereof, on the other: together
with the help of that particular Fermentation, which each humor does suffer
either near unto; or in the place of its separation; to Nature nothing being
more frequent, than to make use of a certain Fermentation, greater or lesser,
where she intends a separation of various humors one from another.

For, since each particular Ex^rement does consist of particles of a
determinate Magnitude, and determinate Figure; and that each separatory organ
in the body has likewise not only a distinct manner of Conformation of its
conspicuous vessels, parenchyma, and other sensible parts; but also its
insensible particles, passages, and pores, of a particular magnitude and
figure, different from those of all other organs, and accommodated only to that
Action or Office, for which the same was made: it is highly reasonable to
conceive, by way of inference, that the blood being diffused through the
arteries, by the impulse of the heart, indiscriminately and equally to all
parts of the body; yet each part does admit and receive only those parts of the
blood, which in respect of the magnitude and figure of their minute particles,
are most correspondent or agreeable to the magnitude and figure of its slender
passages and pores; and exclude the others, wherein is no such analogy or
suitableness. And hence, doubtless, is it, that the serous part of the blood is
determinately imported into the Kidneys; the Phlegmatique into the stomach, and
guts; the Bilious into the Liver, etc. rather than into any other parts: the
capillary branches of the arteries, and the insensible pores of the substance
of each of those parts, being in magnitude, figure and situation respectively
accommodated or adapted to the receiving and imbibing of the humor brought to
it.

And for the Separation of each of these Humors Which is also the Cause of the
Separation of particulas^ Excrements, in particular parts.
we conceive it likewise to belong to the very same Cause, as their Reception
or Admission does; viz, to the determinate magnitude and figure of the
insensible passages and pores in the Parenchyma of this or that part. Because
the separation of each Excrement is effected by a kind of Cribration, or
Percolation; and in all percolations, the particles of the matter transmitted,
ought both in magnitude and figure, to hold an analogy with the pores of the
body, through which they are transmitted. Now, that the Parenchymata of the
separatory organs named, are endowed with various secret passages and pores of
different magnitudes and figures; is manifest from hence, that their component
particles are variously contexed, (in one more loosely, rarely and thinly, in
another more closely, densly and thickly) and the vessels and Fibers running
through them as variously formed, in magnitude, longitude, position, number
etc. and where such variety is, it does necessitate an equal diversity of
pores, which are nothing else but the void spaces betwixt the solid particles.
And, that these Excrements may be (to omit, that they are) easily transmitted
through such narrow and slender passages and pores; however inconspicuous and
undiscernable by the sense; cannot appear difficult, or incredible to any man,
who shall but observe, how blood will issue forth of the skin, if it be pricked
with the point of even the smallest needle. And thus much of the Former part of
this previous Disquisition.

Other; though the Colatures, which Nature has instituted, The Differences of
Colatures, used by Nature in the separation of Humors in the body.
for the separation of Humors in the body, be manifold and various: yet may
they all be commodiously reduced to Two Kinds, all being in order either to
Nutrition, or to Excretion.

Of the First Kind, we have an example in the Nutrition of the Fibers and
Membranous parts of the body. For, it is most probable, that those parts (if
not all the rest) are nourished by the Succus Nutritious, brought to them
through the Nervs; and that Aliment, being somewhat glutinous, like the white
of an Egg, cannot easily penetrate into their substance, without the help of a
certain thin and watery vehicle; which having once done that office of
introducing the succus nutritious into these parts, becomes thenceforth
unprofitable to them, and so is presently discharged by the Lympheducts into
more ample spaces.

Of the Other Kind, there are Three distinct sorts. Whereof the First is, when
the thicker humor is retained, and the thinner rejected: of which we have an
example in the Kidneys, where the serum is transmitted into the Ureters and
bladder, while the pure blood is retained, to be returned into the vena Cava,
by the Emulgent veins. The same is also effected in the separation of Sweat,
Tears, and spittle.

The Second (contrary to the first) is, when the thinner humor is retained, and
the thicker rejected; as in the coats of the stomach and guts, where the Mucous
Excrement or Phlegm is transmitted into their cavities, and the blood retained
to be sent by the veins into the vena portae: and in the brain, in which the
like Mucus is separated from the blood, and deduced into the palate and
nostrills.

The Third, when two humors of equal consistence or thickness are separated
one from the other, this being retained, and that rejected. And this Colature
is performed in the parenchyma of the Liver, For, the Fellous humor, and the
blood, while warm, are very ^eer of equal thickness: and yet has nature found
out a certain way of percolation, which easily distinguishes and separateth
them each from other A thing far transcending the industry of man, who can make
no Artificial Colature, by which two Liquors of equal con^istence may be
separated one from another.

These Considerations premised in the General, we now at length come to
explicate the Particular Manner, how each Excrement is separated, in its
peculiar place.

The Reason and Manner of the separation of the serum from the blood, in the
Kidneys.
impelled into the Emulgent Arteries, flows along into the several branches,
or ramifications of them, and at length into the smaller succses, or capillary
arteries, which running out into smaller and smaller threads, till they become
inconspicuous, lose themselves in various parts of the substance of the
Kidneys, infusing the blood yet commixt with the serum, into the same. This
Parenchyma or substance of the Kidneys, consisting of various parts diversely
contexed and conformed, and having Pores of different magnitudes and figures
and positions running through it, whereof some pores are more accommodate in
magnitude and figure, to the minute particles of the blood, and others more
correspondent to those of the Serum: the blood takes its way through one sort
of pores, into the capillary branches of the Emulgent veins, that lie open and
ready to receive it in all parts of the parenchyma, and thence to lead it along
into the Vena Cava; and the Serum takes its course through the other sort of
pores, into the Papillary Caruncles, which being pervious into the branches of
the Ureters (in like manner variously dispersed up and down, so as to receive
it from the Car^ncles) convey the same into the truncks of the Ureters
themselves, from whence it spontaneously destilleth into the Bladder, which by
contracting of its self expels it in Urine. And this we conceive, to be the
true manner of the Percolation of the Serum, made in the substance of the
Kidneys.

When the Celiacal and Mesenterick Arteries Of the Phlegmatic Excrement, in
the stomach and guts.
that tend to those parts, brought the blood not yet purified from the
Phlegmatique Excrement, both Acid and Insipid, into the capillary arteries
disseminated upon the coats of the Stomach and Intestines: in which there is a
diversity of Pores or insensible passages, some direct, some oblique, in a
word, some, in respect of their magnitude, figure and position, peculiarly
accommodated to the admission of blood; some to the admission of Acid Phlegm;
and others to the admission of Insipid: it comes to pass, that by reason of
this Diversity of secret passages, the blood is impelled into the pores most
analogous to its minute particles and through them into the capillary veins
respondent to the capillary arteries, and thence into the larger veins, which
soon discharge it into the Vena portae; while the Acid Phlegm is protruded
forward into those pores, that are most conformable to its minute particles,
and through them at length into the cavity of the stomach; and the Insipid
likewise is transmitted through those pores, that are most Sy^^bolical to the
magnitude and figure of its minute particles, into the cavity of the Guts,
there to defend them a while from the injuries of the Chyle and Excrements, and
upon the accession of a new supply of the like insipid Phlegm, to be excluded
together with those excrements, as we said before. And this we conceive to be
the way of percolation Nature uses, for the separation of the Phlegm from the
blood, in the stomach and intestines.

Bilious Excrement inseparately accompany the Phlegmatique, flowing along
together with it through the branches of the Celiacal and Mesenterick arteries,
That the Bilious Excrement does accompany the Phlegmatique, to the stomach and
guts; and why.
into the coats of the stomach and guts; but, when it once comes there, it
leaves its associate, the Phlegm, to be, after the manner expressed,
transmitted into their cavities, and being thoroughly commixt with the blood, is
propelled into the extremities of the capillary veins, answering to the
extremities of the capillary arteries, that brought it thither; and from thence
is carried along into Vena portae, and at length into the substance of the
Liver, therein to be segregated from the blood. Nor, indeed, ought this Bilious
Excrement to be sooner dissociated from the Phlegmatique; or conveyed by any
nearer way, or shorter cut, in direct vessels tending from the descendent trunk
of the great artery, to the trunk of the vena portae; and that for Three
important Reasons.

First, it seems necessary that the Bilious humor should accompany the Phlegm,
until it has brought the same into the substance of the stomach and guts;
because the Phlegm, being a mucous and visoid humor, would be apt to obstruct
the capillary vessels, and insensible pores of those parts, unless it were made
more dilute and penetrative, by the admixture of the Bile, an humor penetrative
and detergent, and so fit to prevent obstructions. This reason may receive
verification from hence, that Men of a hot and choleric constitution, and such
in whom this Bilious Excrement does abound more than in others, are seldom or
never troubled with obstructions of the stomach and guts, by gross and viscid
humors: whereas, on the contrary, those of colder complexions (especially
Virgins Leuco-Phlegmatique and afflicted with the Green Sickness) in whom less
of choler is generated, are commonly oppressed with oppilations of those parts,
from abundance of tough and tenacious phlegm.

Secondly, the Bilious humor it self seems to require some certain degree of
preparation, conductive to its future separation, before it can be commodiously
imported into the Liver. For, should it be conveyed into the Liver, directly
out of the descendent trunk of the great artery; it could not be avoided, but
some part of the Phlegm would also be carried along with it: because those
humors, while they remain in the arteries, are never actually separa^ed; and
when they are, their separation is made, by the recess or going off of the
Phlegm into the stomach and guts. And if any part of the Phlegm should
accompany the blood into the Liver; the Liver would always be inevitably
obnoxious to great obstructions, such as would soon render it unfit for the
office, by Nature assigned unto it.

Thirdly, the Bile certainly is more firmly united to the blood, than the
Phlegm; as being essentially radicated in the serous part thereof, so that
without some further preparation, it cannot be easily severed from it. And
therefore it was requisite, that the Bile should be carried about by those
ambages of the stomach and gutts, that by passing through those intricate
meanders, it might acquire some disposition preparatory to its succeeding
separation. Now, that which gives it this previous disposition, is a peculiar
Fermentation, which it undergoes in the vessels leading it along into the
trunck of the Vena portae: it being most undeniable, that the speediest means
in Nature, for the separation of impure humors from pure, is by Fermentation,
as may be sensibly exemplified in Wine and Beer, which are soon defecated by
the help of Fermentation, but never without it. These Reasons, therefore, make
it evident, that Nature was guilty of no oversight or rashness, when she
ordained, that the Bilious Humor should be thus carried about through such
indirect and long ways, before it arrive at the Liver; seeing that circulation
does make its separation afterward both the more safe, and more easy.

Nor did Nature play the wanton, or supererogate, Why the Blood is not carried
immediately out of the trunck of the vena portae, into that of the vena cava;
but through the various meanders in the Liver.
that the blood should be carried along through all those intricate labyrinths
in the Liver; forasmuch as if the blood were to be infused into the trunck of
the vena cava, by some vessel immediately and directly tending from the trunck
of the vena portae, the Bilious humor, being not yet separated from it, would
necessarily pollute and corrupt the whole mass of blood. To avoid that
inconvenience, therefore, was it requisite, that the blood should be first
diverted into the Liver, and therein defecated from its remaining impurities,
before it be permitted to enter the vena cava.

When it is brought into the Liver, it does And why it is transmitted through
the Parenchyma of the Liver.
into the extremities of the capillary branches of the Vena cava, immediately
or per Anastomoses, as was long believed and taught by Anatomists; because we
have the testimony of our eyes, that there are no such Anastomoses, or mutual
Inosculations betwixt the extremities of those vessels: but, it is first
percolated through the Parenchyma or very substance of the Liver. Now, to what
end is it so percolated? That percolation must certainly be in order either to
some Alteration, or to some Separation. It cannot be in order to any
Alteration, because no such thing can be imagined to be effected in the Liver,
since the Liquor passing through the Liver, as it came-in blood, so does it go
out blood. It must, therefore, conduce to the separation of something from the
blood. And that something can be nothing but the Bilious Excrement; because all
other Excrements are separated, before the blood arrive at the confines of the
Liver: and because no other Excrement can be found therein. Which consideration
is alone sufficient to evince, that the Office of the whole Liver, is to
receive the blood out of the vena portae, to purge it from the Bilious
Excrement, and to discharge it so purified into the vena cava, thence to be
conveyed into the Heart.

As for the Manner how this excellent work of Purification is performed in the
Liver; for the better understanding the same, we are to observe.

Parenchyma is the Principal part among all those many, that make up that ample
and curiously contrived organ of the Liver. That the Parenchyma is the
Principal part of all the Liver.
In particular, the Ligaments of the Liver serve only to establish, or hold it
firm in its natural position; the Coat investeth it; the vena Portae brings
the blood into it; the Capsula Communis is inservient to the distribution of
the same blood, through the branches of the vena Portae; the Hepatick Artery
and Nerve serve partly to the better promotion of the blood into all parts of
the parenchyma, and partly to the more quick and easy influx of the Bilis into
the Porus Bilarius; the branches of the Vena Cava export the blood, after its
purification; and those of the Porus Bilarius export the Bile, after its
separation: so that it is manifest, that all these several parts are in some
sort or other, mechanically inservient to the Parenchyma; and that the
Parenchyma is the sole part, wherein the separation of the Bile from the blood
is made by an admirable artifice of percolation.

(2) That this Parenchyma is a kind of Streiner, And a kind of Streiner;
for that separation, which can be no otherwise effected, but by Percolation.
For, whenever a mixed Liquor is brought into a part, and in passing through
that part severed into two distinct kinds, and so by distinct ways effused out
of it again; we may be certain, that those Liquors were severed each from other
by percolation made in that part; and as certain that that part is a
Percolatory Instrument. And since the very same is effected in the Parenchyma
of the Liver, while the Bile is severed from the blood; we may well conclude,
that that separation is made by percolation, and that the Parenchyma is a kind
of Streiner.

(3) That this Parenchyma being a lax and Whose particles are contexed after a
peculiar manner, and pores of diverse sorts: in respect whereof, the Bile is
therein separated from the blood, mechanically.
and having various sorts of pores, whereof some are in magnitude, figure and
situation, particularly comparated for the reception of the impure blood,
effused out of the extremities of the capillary branches of the vena portae;
and others in like manner particularly comparated for the reception of the
minute particles of the Bilious Excrement, and the transmission of them into
the extremities of the capillary branches of the Porus Bilarius; and others
again particularly comparated for the reception of the minute particles of the
pure blood, and the transmission of them into the extremities of the capillary
branches of the vena cava: we say, these things being so, it is reasonable to
conceive, that after the impure blood is brought into the pores of the First
sort, the particles of the Bile are impelled into those of the Second, and
through them into the extremities of the capillary branches of the Porus
Bilarius; and the particles of the pure blood into those of the Third, and
through them into the extremities of the capillary branches of the vena Cava;
so as the separation The same inferred from 4 considerables: viz.
only by reason of this diversity of its pores.

To increase the verisimilitude of this Opinion, there occur 4. things not
unworthy a serious remark, in this place; viz.

(1) That the Capillary branches of each sort of the vessels mentioned, The
equal distribution of the capillary branches of all the vessels in the Liver.
are distributed equally into all parts of the Parenchyma; so that the
Port-vein does dispense the blood equally into all parts thereof; and the
capillary branches of the Porus Bilarius, being likewise disseminated through
all parts of the same, lie ready to admit the Bilious^humor, as fast as it is
separated from the blood; and the capillary branches of the vena cava, being
also dispersed into all parts of the same, are ready to receive the pure blood,
as fast as it is defecated from the Bile. Which is some document, that this
whole work of purifying the blood from the Bilious humor, is performed in the
Liver, only Mechanically, and that with the greatest facility imaginable: nor
is it possible for the greatest wit of man, to imagine any fabrique more
commodious for the effecting thereof, than this of the Liver is.

(2) That the Vena portae, The Pulsation of the Vena Portae within the Liver.
being entered into the body of the Liver, does acquire a certain Pulsation
(though weak and less perfect than that of an Artery) by the benefit partly of
the Capsula communis, that includes it, and partly of the Arteria Hepatica,
that accompanies it. For, being included in the same common case with the
Arteria Hepatica, it must necessarily be compressed, in some measure, by the
systole thereof; and again be relaxed, in the diastole: and by that means
suffer a certain Dilatation and Compression alternately. And being so
compressed, it must impell the blood into the parenchyma; and that blood must
be driven on by the next succeeding blood: so as that the motion and
distribution thereof is necessarily continued by that impulse, without the
necessity of any either Similary Attraction, or Distinguishing Faculty.

(3) That the Hepatick Nerve may be conceived also to conduce somewhat to that
Pulsation of the Vena Portae. The assistance of that Pulsation, by the Hepatick
Nerve.
For, that Nerve also is included in the Capsella Communis, and no less
distributed upon the same, than upon the branches of the Porus Bilarius. And,
therefore, when the Arteria Hepatica is dilated, this Nerve, as being
contiguous to it, must be somewhat compressed; and so irritated to make some
small Contraction of it self: which being impossible to be effected, without a
proportionate constriction of the Capsula Communis; it comes to pass, that the
Vena Portae included in the same Capsula, suffers a constriction, at the same
time.

(4) It is probable, that this Pulsatile motion of the Vena Portae within the
Liver, The Resuscitation of Vitality in the blood, in the branches of the Vena
Porlae, within the Liver; and a new Fermentation thereof, praevious to the
separation of the Bile.
does cause some new Fermentation of the blood, and redintegrate the decayed
Vitality thereof, in such a proportion, as may be sufficient to vivify the
Parenchyma of the Liver, and conduce to the more easy and speedy separation of
the Bilious impurities therein: especially considering that the Spirits of the
blood brought in, are hindered from flying away (as they usually do through the
thinner coats of the veins) by the thickness of the Capsula Communis, and so
kept together to resuscitate the Mication and renew the Vitality thereof. That
this is so, may be in part inferred from hence, that the Vital Spirits can be
no otherwise communicated to this Parenchyma; the Arteria Hepatica being wholly
distributed upon the Capsula Communis, and the branches of the Porus Bilarius,
but never touching the Parenchyma with so much as one small surcle. Now there
being no vessel that brings blood into the Parenchyma, but only the Vena
Portae; that Parenchyma must of necessity be deprived of all Vitality, unless
we allow the blood, brought by the Porta, to recover its vital disposition, by
the means of the Pulsation caused in the Porta, and the excitement of a new
Fermentation from the restraint of the Spirits. For, without the influx of
vital blood, no part can be vivified: and certain it is, the Parenchyma does
receive no blood, but only from the Vena Portae. This Resuscitation of the
Vital Spirits in the blood, brought into the Liver, may be adumbrated by the
example of the heart of a Viper, or other Animal of like vivacity. For, the
Heart being cut out of the Viper yet alive, and placed upon a table, does a
good while retain its pulsation; and as that motion begins to decay, by reason
of the consumption of the Vital Heat, if you but drop some warm liquor upon
the then languishing heart, it will instantly revive, and beat again, until it
grows cold. And such doubtless is this small spark of life reenkindled in the
blood contained in the Vena Portae, within the Liver: which though but small,
may yet be sufficient both to enliven the Parenchyma, and to excite some gentle
Fermentation in the blood, conducible to its purification in that place.

Now, to bring all this into a narrower circle; if we reflect upon the Equal
Dissemination of all the foresaid vessels through all parts of the Parenchyma;
upon the Pulsation of the Vena Portae, within the limits of the Liver, whereby
the motion of the blood is made more strong and quick; upon the promotion of
that pulsation, by the Hepatick Nerv spontaneously contracting it self, after
every diastole of the Hepatick Artery; and lastly upon the resuscitation of
Vitality in the blood, and its renewed Fermentation (which always precedeth the
separation of any humor from the blood): we say, reflecting upon these things,
we may plainly understand, with how little of difficulty the blood is impelled
into all parts of the Parenchyma, and therein separated from the Bilious
impurities, only by reason of the Diversity of Pores in the same Parenchyma,
according to a MECHANICAL way or method. Which was the difficulty that required
to be removed.

The various Manners of the Excretion of Excrements, after they are separated
and collected.
and therefore, having investigated the manner of their separation from the
blood, it is requisite that we say somewhat of the Manner of their Excretion.
For albeit there be no Excretion, but what is effected immediately by Pulsion;
yet does that Pulsion arise from various causes. In particular, One sort of
Excretion is made by simple Propulsion; as that of the Serum through the
substance of the Kidneys, that of the Bile into the bladder of Gall, and into
the Porus Bilarius, and of the Phlegma into the Guts. Another is, from the
Rarefaction of the Excrements themselves; as when the Serum, flowing together
with the blood in the arteries, is rarefied by heat, and breaks forth into the
habit of the body, whence at length it is excluded in sweat through the pores
of the skin; and when the watery part of the blood is by way of Exhalation
transmitted through the coats of the smaller arteries, and collected in the
Lympheducts. And a third sort of Excretion is made, merely by the Spontaneous
Contraction of the Parts Expelling; such is that of the Bile out of the bladder
of Gall, into the ductus communis; of vicious humors out of the stomach, by
vomiting; and of the Urine out of the bladder, etc. So that we see, there is as
little need of any Attraction, toward the Excretion of Excrements, as there was
toward their separation from the blood.

To Explicate the Manner of the Excretion of Bile somewhat more particularly;
The particular Manner of the Excretion of the Bile.
we note, that the Porus Bilarius is filled with that humor, by its capillary
branches disseminated into the greatest part of the Parenchyma of the Liver:
and the Vesicula Fellis, by its Fibrous roots, that are likewise disseminated
into the rest of the parenchyma. And when these two Receptacles are thus filled
with this humor, even to distention; then, being irritated or molested by that
burden, they contract themselves, and so squeez out so much thereof, as
exceeded their natural capacity: the Vesicula Fellis exonerating it self by the
Meatus Cysticus, and the Bilarius Porus by the Ductus communis, out of which
the excrement is convaid, by the oblique insertion, into the Guts. Which
Irritation and contraction of these Receptacles, is the cause, why the Bile
does not continually and by drops destill out of the Ductus communis into the
Guts, as the serum does into the Ureters: but is as it were ^ructated by
intervalls, and in good quantity at a time; those concave and membranous parts
never contracting themselves, but only when they are above measure distended by
a redundancy of the humor contained in them; and the efflux of the humor
depending wholly upon that their Contraction.

Contract themselves, is inferrible from hence, And the Cause thereof,
that all sensitive parts (among which the vesicula Fellis may be accounted, in
respect it enjoys a small Nerve derived from the sixth conjugation) are
capable of Irritation: and therefore, whenever they are distended beyond their
natural rate, or otherwise molested; they begin instantly to make some
resistance, and reduce themselves to their due laxity, by ex-pressing what was
offensive to them; and if the parts thus irritated, be concave, membranous, and
fibrous, it is necessary, that their resistance be made by a Contraction of all
their Fibers, whereby their cavity is lessened, and some part at least of the
humor distending them, is expelled. The Receptacles of the Bile, therefore,
being such parts; they must have such a motion of self-Restitution, upon the
like occasion.

Digression.
Here (methinks) I perceive my Reader to PARADOX. That we have a certain
Natural Feeling wholly distinct from the Animal, and independent upon the Brain.
and to arrest me with this curious scruple, saying; Does not this Irritation
and spontaneous Contraction of Membranous and Nervous parts, when they are
molested, imply a certain sense in them, distinct from the sense of Feeling or
Touching, and independent upon the Common sense, or Brain? For, whatever is any
ways moved by it self, in avoydance or resistance of what is offensive to it;
must be endowed with a sense, whereby to discern that offensiveness: according
to that rule, Quic quid contra irritamenta and molestias, motibus suis diversis
nititur; id sensu praeditum sit, necesse est. But we are not conscious to
ourselves of any such sense within us (as we are of all our Animal senses)
whereby those parts are made sensible of their irritations; and therefore it
seems, you have imagined one sense more than Nature has made.

For the solution of this Difficulty, therefore, we Answer; that those Motions
and Actions, which Physicians call Natural (because they are not instituted by
the Will; but done even against it, and cannot be moderated, accelerated,
retarded, or suppressed, ex Arbitrio nostro, at our pleasure: and so have no
dependence upon the Brain, that is the Common instrument of all the senses)
these motions and actions, we say, are not yet made without some sense,
naturally inhaerent in the parts moved. For instance; we are certain, that in
palpitations, tremblings, syncopes, swooning fits, and other Cardiacal symptoms
or affections, the Heart does variously move, and agitate it self; as being
offended with something preternatural and noxious to it, and irritated to
resist and repel the same: and this in respect only of some sense or feeling,
by which it discerns what is incommodious and harmfull. The stomach and Guts,
in like manner, being oppressed and provoked by vicious humors, instantly rise
in arms, and raise impetuous vomitings, nauseousness, convulsions, fluxes of
the belly, and the like motions, for the expulsion of their enemies: and as we
have it not in our power, to excite or suppress those commotions; so have we no
particular cognizance of any such sense, which should extimulate those parts to
begin and continue them. Truly, we cannot but wonder, as often as we observe the
effects of Antimony infused in wine, and taken into the stomach. It is not our
Taste, that does distinguish the tincture of the Antimony, from the wine; nor
are we sensible of any disagreeableness therein to our nature, while we are
swallowing it down: and yet in the stomach there is a certain sense, that
discerns the offensivenesse of that draught, and quickly engages the stomach
to raise and contract it self, and to eject it again by vomiting; nor will it
ever cease, till it be wholly discharged. Consider, how even the Flesh it self
does presently distinguish a poisonous puncture, from a simple one; and how
soon it contracteth, condenseth and fortifieth it self, to expel the venom,
whereupon ensue swelling, inflammation, and great pain in the part pricked, as
is observed in the stinging of Bees, and Hornets, and Scorpions, and the biting
of Spiders, Vipers, and other venenate Animals; and all this merely from some
sense, which teaches the flesh that difference, and excites it to make
resistance. Consider further, how the Contorsion, Falling down, Ascent,
suffocation and other violent Agitations of the Womb in women; proceed not from
the brain, or Common sense, but from a Natural sense inhaerent in that part,
without which it could not be provoked to those impetuous strivings and
motions. For, whatever is wholly destitute of fense, is wholly incapable also
of being irritated to perform any action or motion, in order to its safety.
Nor can we, indeed, otherwise discern what is Animate and sentient, from what
is Inanimate and void of sense; but only by some Motion excited in it, by
something molesting and irritating it: which Motion does continually both
follow and argue sense.

To evince this Natural sense yet further, we shall thus reason. We find in our
selves, that we have Five External Senses, by which we perceive objects without
us; but, because we do not perceive our perception, by the same sense, by which
we perceive objects (for, we see with our eyes, but do not by them perceive
that we see; but by the mediation of another internal sense, or sensitive
organ, the Brain, by which we judge of all objects offered to the External
senses): therefore is it manifest, that the common sensory is the Brain, which
together with all its Nerves, and external organs annexed to those nerves,
ought to be held the adequate Instrument of sensation. And we may fitly
resemble it to a sensitive Root, which shoots forth many Fibers or strings,
whereof one does see, another hear, a third taste, a fourth smell and the fifth
feel.

Nevertheless, As Experience assures us, that there are some Motions and
Actions in us, whose regiment or moderation is no ways dependent upon the
Brain; and therefore, by contradistinction to voluntary or Animal motions and
actions, they are named Natural: So also does Reason teach us, that we have a
certain sense of Feeling, which is not referrible to the Common sense, nor
communicated to the Brain, and of which we take no cognizance, but by the
various effects and commotions that it causes in our bodies. For, in this
Sense, we do not perceive that we feel; but as it fares with men distracted, or
otherwise agitated with any violent passion of the Mind, who neither feel pain,
nor take notice of objects offered to their senses: so is it with us in this
Sense, which operating without our knowledge, is therefore to be distinguished
from the Animal sense, and may be properly enough called a Sensation without
Sense. And certainly such as this, is that sense observed in Zoophy^es or
Plant-Animals; as the sensitive Plant, the Boramets or Vegetable Lamb of
Tartary, Sponges, etc.

We know, there are many Animals, that have both sense and motion; and yet have
no brain, or Common^sense, as Earthworms, Caterpillars, Silkworms, etc: and
that there are some Natural Actions in us, which are performed without the
influence or help of the brain. As Physicians, therefore, teach us to
distinguish such actions Natural, from actions Animal: why may not we, with
equal reason, distinguish the Feeling Natural, from the Feeling Animal; so as
to refer one to the brain the other not.

We know moreover, that it is one thing for a Muscle to be moved or contracted
Spontaneously (as in Convulsion); and another, for it to be moved Voluntarily,
or with various regulated contractions and relaxations, in order to the
performance of some action intended, as Progression, or Apprehension. The
Muscles, certainly, or Motory-Organs, are, in cramps and convulsions, moved
spontaneously, upon their irritation by some acrimonious vapors, or other
injurious cause; no otherwise than the body of a Fowl is moved, after the head
is cut off. For as the body is tumbled up and down, and agitated by various
convulsive motions of the feet and wings, yet such as are wholly confused and
irregular, and of no effect either to progression or to apprehension, because
the power and influence of the brain is extinguished; by the government and
moderation whereof, those motions were formerly regulated either to
progression, or flying: so in Convulsions, our Muscles are contracted, and our
members variously agitated with irregular and ineffectuall motions; because
those motions depend upon a natural sense only, without the regulating
influence of the Brain, which takes no cognizance of the injuries done to the
Muscles, nor of the sense which irritateth them.

These things duly considered, Reason advises us, henceforth to lay aside that
opinion of Des Carts, and his disciple, Regius, (both great Philosophers, and
in many other things worthy to be followed) that the influx of Animal spirits
by the nerves, is necessary to the performance of all Natural Motions and
actions done in the body: and to take up this more probable one of Dr. Harvey,
that each Natural action is effected by the part doing it, merely in respect of
a certain sense, whereby it feels what is troublesome and injurious to it
self, and so is irritated to excite such motions of it self, as may conduce to
its vindication; and this, without any influx or regiment of the Brain, or
Common sense, at all.

We might have added further, out of the same Dr. HARVET that all Motions in
the body, are derivative from the Vital Influence of the Heart, and wholly
dependent thereupon; because, no part is longer capable of this Natural sense,
than while it is irradiated and enlivened by the Vital Spirits or blood
flowing from the heart; for no part once mortified, i.e. no longer participant
of the Vital influence, can have any sense, or be irritated to motion.
Besides, it is not unreasonable to conceive, that the strength or Tone of each
part does mostly consist in its enjoying a due proportion of Vitality: and if
that Tone or firmeness be vitiated or diminished (as soon it must, if deprived
of that requisite influx), that part becomes languid, dull, and hardly capable
of irritation But this noble speculation requires to be handled with more
exactness, than the narrow limits of a short Digression will admit of: and we
have already said more than enough to assert, that all parts of the body have a
certain Natural sense of Feeling, distinct from the Animal, and wholly
independent upon the Brain; which was the Problem proposed..

Of Respiration.

betwixt which and the Pulsation is a manifest affinity. For, these two Actions
or Motions, as they are inservient to the conservation of the Lamp of Life, and
the Generation of Vital Spirits; so do they both consist of a Dilatation and
Contraction; the one of a Diastole and Systole of the Heart and Arteries, the
other of a Diastole and Systole of the Breast and Lungs.

Now this Affinity, has given occasion to many Physicians to conceive the
Diastole and Systole of the Lungs, to be Synchronical or coincident with the
Diastole and Systole of the Heart; and to refer both their motions to the same
cause and Original. But, They have grossly erred, in confounding things so
manifestly different. For

have Hearts, The Disparity betwixt Respiration, and Pulsation; both as to
their Times or periods, and as to their Uses.
but no Lungs. (2) The Dilatations and Contractions of the Heart, are clearly
distinct from those of the Breast and Lungs; as is evident from hence, that
they are not synchronical, i. e. made and terminated in the same periods and
times; one complete Respiration taking up more time, then 4 or 5 Pulses: and
this in all Animals that have both Heart and Lungs.

(3) The Motion of the Heart and Arteries is much different from that of the
Lungs, as to their Uses.

For, First, if the Pulse and Respiration have one and the same Final cause,
and that (as these men have assumed) the Arteries take in the ambient aer
through the skin, at every Diastole; and exclude it again the same way,
together with the Fuliginous Exhalations of the blood, in every systole; and
that in the space of time intermediate betwixt each Diastole and Systole, they
contain both the inspired aer, and exhalations: then must we renounce both the
doctrine of our Master Galen, that in the arteries nothing is contained, but
the blood; and our own experience, that confirms it.

Secondly, if the Arteries were (as the Lungs are) filled with aer drawn in by
their extremities, and that the quantity of aer attracted, were proportionate
to the magnitude of each pulse, or to the greater or lesser dilatation of the
arteries: then, if, while the pulse is great, the whole body were immerged into
a bath of water or oil, it would necessarily follow, that the Pulse would
become much smaller, or much slower; because it is highly difficult, if not
wholly impossible, that the ambient aer should pass through the bath, into the
pores of the skin, and so into the arteries.

Thirdly, since all the Arteries, as well those that lie deep in the body, as
those terminated in the skin, are moved with equal velocity, and at the same
time; it is not possible, the ambient aer should as freely and swiftly pass
through the habit of the body, into the profoundest arteries, as into those
contiguous to the skin.

Fourthly, it is not credible, that Whales, Dolphins, and other Cetaceous
Animals, that have Respiration, can draw aer into their arteries, at every
diastole, through so vasta mass of waters, as is from the bottom to the top of
the sea.

Fifthly, if in their systole, the Arteries expel the fuliginous exhalations
of the blood, through the pores of the skin; why should they not expel also
the vital spirits, that are far more subtle and fugitive, than those supposed
Exhalations can be? Nature certainly has made no such Colatory, as should
retain the thinner spirits, and let the grosser fumes pass through. Nor is it
yet sufficiently proved, that there are any such Fuliginous Exhalations
generated in the heart and arteries, and afterward excluded partly by the
Lungs, partly by the Arteries, in their Contractions; as are vulgarly believed.
For, the blood suffers only a simple agitation, or conquassation in the
ventricles of the heart, and a propulsion in the arteries: and that it can
produce such an abundance of sooty fumes from the blood, as Physicians have
talked of; is not easy to conceive. Truth is, the blood, by reason of its heat
and swift motion, does emit some Halitus, or vapors (which streaming through
the coats of the smaller arteries, are received and condensed into a thin
limpid liquor by the Lympheducts) but is it therefore necessary, that it should
emit Fuliginous exhalations? We confess also, that there is a certain thin
Excrement of the blood and humors, which passes through the habit of the body;
but, that it should be discharged in thick clouds of exhalations, in every
systole of the arteries, this is plainly impossible: because at that time the
coats of the arteries are constringed and compressed, and there might be an
easier egress for them, in the Diastoles, when the cavities of the arteries are
dilated. So that among these many Arguments, there is not one, but does clearly
detect, and thoroughly refute the Error of those Men, who have confounded the
Uses of the Arteries, and Lungs, of Pulsation and Respiration.

This capital Error eschewed, we may the more safely progress to explicate the
nature of Respiration, as a thing in sundry particulars distinct from
Pulsation, though perchance instituted by Nature, as in some sort subservient
to the vital Faculty. And, that we may proceed methodically, it is requisite we
consider (1) the Manner of Respiration; (2) the Efficient Cause; and (3) the
Final Cause, or Use of it.

Concerning the First.
Respiration [(...)] is an Action of the Breast and Lungs consisting of two
contrary motions alternately successive, or of two parts, Respiration described.
viz. (1) Inspiration [(...)] in which the ambient aer is impelled into the
Lungs and chest, at that time dilated: (2) Exspiration [(...)] wherein the same
aer is again expelled out of the Lungs and Chest, those parts spontaneously
contracting or compressing themselves.

Concerning the Inspiration, the grand Question is, Whether the Breast and
Lungs are dilated, because they are filled and distended with the aer; as a
bladder is distended by aer blown into it: or, Whether they receive in the aer,
because they are dilated; as a pair of Bellows is filled with aer, only
because it is dilated or opened by external force?

The Efficient Cause of Inspiration, is the Dilatation of the Breast, impellin^
the ambient (...) into the Lungs.
before it can be filled with aer, and that Dilatation or heaving up of the
breast is the cause of the airs rushing in at the mouth and nostrills, down the
Aspera Arteria, or windpipe, into the Lungs. For, since there is no vacuity
(at least no Coacervate one) in the world, no body can be moved out of its
place, but the next body must give way, and the next to that likewise give
back, till such a part of space as is adequate to the dimensions of the body
first moved, be made to receive it, and the space which it abandoned, be again
fully possessed by another body succeeding into it: we say, since this is
necessary, it is manifest, that the aer next incumbent on, or contiguous unto,
the Breast and Abdomen being urged and impelled by the breast, while that is
dilated or expanded, is forced to give back, and press the aer next to it,
which likewise drives back the next aer, until at length the compressed aer
wanting room to retreat into, and endeavoring to avoid further compression,
(its own Elater engaging it thereto) rusheth into the breast and there
possesses that room or part of space, which was left by the breast, when it
began its motion. So that so much aer is impelled into the breast, as is driven
out of its place by the superfice or outside of the breast, during its
expansion or dilatation.

As for the Attraction of Aer into the Lungs, ad fugam vacui; it is a mere
dream; as well because all motion is by Impulsion, as because Nature does not
abhor vacuity primario or ex se, In Physiolog-Epiarro-Gassendo-Charltoniae,
l^b. 1. cap. 5 page 40.
but only ex Accidente, or in respect of the confluxibility of the insensible
particles of Fluid bodies, as we have elsewhere amply demonstrated.

And if there were any Cause to be found, that might blow the aer into the
breast, as it is blown into a bladder, so as to distend it; or at least, if the
aer could be conceived to enter into the breast spontaneously, or of its own
accord, without impulsion, so as to force, or heave up the same: then indeed,
would the Comparison betwixt the dilatation of the breast, and that of a
Bladder, by wind blown violently into it, hold good, and we should not need to
seek further. But, there being no such insufflating cause assignable; and it
being ridiculous to imagine the aer should spontaneously move it self, so as to
flow uncompelled into the cavity of the Chest (as is manifest not only in dead
men, into whose breasts, though their mouths and nostrils are wide open, the
aer does not crowd it self: but also in living men, when they at their pleasure
keep their breasts compressed, or hold their breath, as the vulgar phrase is),
it seems much more reasonable to explain the reason of Inspiration, by that
other similitude of the flux of aer into a pair of Bellows; there being no
other difference betwixt the repletion of the Chest, and the repletion of a
pair of Bellows, with aer, but only this; that the Bellows are opened by an
external force, and the Chest is dilated by an internal.

Exspiration, that is evidently from the compression of the breast and Lungs,
And the cause of Expiration, is only the spontan^ous contraction of the Breast.
which is the natural motion of Restitution For, the Dilatation being an
action, whereby the parts of the Chest are distended into a position more
large, than is natural to them; the Contraction seems to be nothing else, but
a certain falling down or relaxation of the parts distended, whereby they
spontaneously return to their natural position, and such as they hold in a dead
body; and this not only in the Lungs, but also in the Diaphragme, which in
dead bodies is not extended downward to the stomach and guts (as in
inspiration) but rises upward toward the Lungs and Heart. But if it be here
demanded, whether Inspiration, or Exspiration be first; we answer that it is
necessary that the aer should be first inspired, before it can be exspired; and
every ANIMAL dies Exspirando, in Exspiration.

Concerning the Second.
The Enquiry is, By what cause the breast and The Dilatation of the Breast and
Lungs, not from any Motive Faculty conge^iall to the Lungs.
as we have asserted? And this, indeed, is a Difficulty not so soon resolved,
as proposed; for, besides the obscurity of the thing it self, we find our
selves benighted with the various opinions of Authors. Some will have, that the
Lungs are endowed with a certain Faculty of Dil^ting themselves, and so
elevating the whole breast: as the Heart has a pulsifick faculty, by whose
virtue the ventricles contract themselves in each Systole. And, hereupon was
it, that Aristotle (the Author of this opinion) does compare the Lungs to a
pair of Bellows, as if they did of themselves first attract the aer, and then
emit it again. But, though it be true, that the Lungs are filled with aer, and
emptied again, or elevated and depressed alternately, as Bellows are; yet is
it doubtful, whether (as the hand which moves the bellows, by opening and
shutting them, is the cause both of the influx and efflux of the aer in them)
there be not some other part of the Chest, besides the Lungs, which being first
dilated and contracted, is the cause, why the Lungs are opened and shut? or
more plainly, whether the ^xpansion of the Lungs be from an ingenite Faculty?
And, that the Lungs have no such Ingenite Motive-Faculty, is sufficiently
manifest even from hence, that their motion is always conform to that of the
Diaphragme, and from hence, that we can suppress, accelerate, or retard our
respiration, as we please.

Others derive the motion of the Lungs from the Heart, Nor from the impulse of
the blood out of the heart into the Lungs.
or rather the blood expelled out of the right ventricle of the heart, through
the Vena arteriosa into the Lungs, and so lifting them up. But this is
erroneous, because (1) the efflux of the blood out of the right ventricle is
caused by an ordinary motion purely natural to the heart; whereas (as we said
even now) Respiration is sometimes arbitrary: (2) the cause of pulsation and
Respiration would then be not only one and the same, but those motions also
would agree in their times and periods; whereas scarce four, nay six, pulses
are equal in time to one single Respiration: (3) the blood does not stay long
enough in the vessels of the Lungs* to keep them elevated all that while they
are distended; but is in continual motion, and in a moment circulated by the
Arteria venosa, into the left ventricle of the Heart: and where it is retarded
in its course, by any misaffection either in the capillary vessels, or in the
substance of the Lungs (as it many times happens, in the disease vulgarly
called, the Rising of the Lights) it causes extreme difficulty of breathing:
(4) in great Apoplexies, while the pulse continues good and regular, the
Respiration many times cease.

Others will have it, that the Lungs borrow Thorax, or Nor from the motion of
the Muscles of the Thorax.
Chest containing them; but the reason which detain us from assenting thereto,
is, that after the chest is cut quite open, the Lungs continue their motion for
a good while, and strongly: which were impossible, if they derived their motion
from the chest.

Now it being evinced, that the Lungs are But from the Diaphragme moved by a
congenite Faculty.
or by the Heart, or by the Thorax* it remains, that they must be moved by some
other part in the Breast, in which as in the first original, the motion of
Inspiraiton does begin: and this part seems to be no other, but the Diaphragme;
and that for these reasons. (1) In wounds, or perforations of the breast, the
Lungs instantly falling together, as it were close themselves (for some short
space) while the Diaphragme is still elevated and depressed alternately,
contracting and again relaxing the ends of the spuricus ribbs, and cartilages
to which it is annexed: whence it comes, that the aer rusheth violently into
the cavity of the chest, and upon the elevation of the Diaphragme, is driven
out again, through the wounds with impetuosity sufficient to blow out a candle.
(2) Every man, in Inspiration, feels the Thorax to be dilated, and the whole
Abdomen lifted up, and the ends of the lower ribs to be drawn inward: the
Diaphragme being extended downward, with its middle part crowding down the
stomach, liver and guts, and with its circumference or extreme parts
contracting the ribs.

(3) Allowing the Diaphragme to be the primum Movens, among all parts
inservient to inspiration, we may easily understand, why the Respiration
becomes more frequent and remiss, when the stomach is full, and when the Aer is
made more dense, than ordinary, by fogs and thick exhalations. For, in the
former case, the Diaphragme has not room enough to expand it self downward, as
it ought, and so is compelled to compensate the smallness of its motion, by the
frequency of it; and in the latter, the Lungs are so prepossessed with gross
vapors; as that they cannot admit much aer at a time; and therefore the
Diaphragme is necessitated to repeat its motions so much the oftener. (4) In
Apoplexies (unless they be fatal) though the Respiration be almost insensible,
yet the motion of the Diaphragme is continued; as may be peroeived by the
gentle motion of the Chest. (5) Respiration is more perturbed and vitiated, by
diseases of the Diaphragme, than by those of any other part of the breast: and
it has been observed by Veslingius that a steatoma grown upon even the
carneous part of it, caused extreme difficulty of breathing. Now, these are the
Reasons that have induced us to believe, that the Motion of Respiration begins
in the Diaphragme; which being a kind of Muscle of a peculiar figure; Syntagm.
An^tom. p. ii^.
substance, position, and action, may as well be conceived to be extended by
virtue of a certain peculiar and ingenite Faculty, as the Heart is by a
Pulsifick Faculty: so that we may conclude the same to be the prime and
principal instrument of Respiration Natural or Gentle.

We say Natural or Gentle, by contradistinction Violent, Yet as well the
Intercost all, as Pectoral Muscl^^ are allowed to consp^re with the Diaphragme,

or Arbitrary. For, allowing of Galen's triple difference of Respiration, viz.
Free and Gentle, violent, and more violent or sublime: we conceive the First to
depend upon the Diaphragme alone; the Second, to require a concurrence of the
Intercostal Muscles, of which the interior serve to contract, and the Exterior
to dilate the Chest; and the last to be effected by the Diaphragme,
Intercostal, and Pectoral Muscles, all being set a work, and combining together
to the motion. And, as for Respiration voluntary, such as we can at pleasure
suppress, accelerate, or retard; that is manifestly by the help of the
Intercostal Muscles, there being no other instruments of Motion voluntary, but
the Muscles; and no other Muscles immediately conducing to the contraction and
dilatation of the breast, ex arbitrio nostro, but the Intercostal.

Concerning the Third, viz.
The Final Cause, or Use of Respiration.
The Final Cause of Respiration, not the Refrigeration of the Heart, or Vital
Flame: but the subtiliation of the blood, which by the admistion of Aer, is
made the more convenient Fuel for the Lamp of life, and matter of the Vital
Spirits.
that the principal use of Respiration, is for the Refrigeration of the Heart.
Which though very ancient and plausible, is rather merely Conjectural, than
Areopagitical or demonstrative. For (1) AS aer over-hot is injurious to the
heart, so is aer over-cold: and as aer moderately cold is beneficial to the
heart, when it is excessively heated; so is aer moderately hot, beneficial,
when the heart is too much cooled. But, while the heart is in good temper, then
the aer most agreeable to it, is neither hot, nor cold, but temperate. (2) It
is inconsistent with the prudence of Nature, to make the natural heat of the
heart so intense and excessive, as to require perpetual ventilation with cold
aer: when it had been much easier for Her, to have kindled a more gentle fire
there in at first, than to bring cold aer to the hearth with so much ado, to
keep it in moderation ever after. And, in case that-Fire should chance, at any
time, to grow less, or languish (as it often does, in extreme cold aer, many
men being frozen to death in Green-land, Russia, and other Northern Countries)
what provision has Nature made for the reaccension or instauration of it? (3)
If it be only the Cold of the aer, that is beneficial to the heart; then,
certainly, the Water, (which is much colder than the aer) would more
conveniently satisfy that necessity in Fishes, which yet cannot live without
aer. (4) In persons of cold and Leuco-phlegmatique constitutions, there would
be no need at all of Respiration; especially in frosty weather, when the heart
has as much want of warmth, as of cold, and more too. We confess, indeed, that
at such times, our Respiration is more slow and rare, and in the heat of
Summer, more quick and frequent; as it is also in Fevers: but the reason hereof
is, that in Summer, the blood being made hotter, is sooner subtiliated into
spirits, and those spirits faster consumed and dissipated; and so requires more
aer to promote the subtiliation and inflammability of its spiritual parts. So
that it should seem, the Aer is required rather as an Excitement, than as an
hindrance to the vital Flame. We say, for the Excitation, or Accension of the
Flame of life, by subtiliating the blood, and making the inflammable parts
thereof more convenient Fuel for the same vital Flame, and for the matter of
the spirits, which being diffused through the whole body, serve to conserve and
vivifie all the parts; no otherwise than Bellows conduce to the accension of
flame in wood.

For, as the Aer blown out of a Bellows, The same exemplified by the accension
of flame in wood, by aer blown out of Bellows.
in wood, or other combustible matter; not by reason of any Cold (for
Contraries never generate each other) but by the subtility of its particles,
and the vehemence of its motion, in respect whereof it both dissipates the
ashes, that hinder the ingress of the fire, and impells the particles of the
fire into the pores of the wood; so as that they penetrating more deeply into
the substance thereof, invade and kindle all the inflammable particles therein
contained: so does the Aer brought into the Lungs, and commixing it self with
the blood circulating through them, insinuate it self, by the Arteria Venosa,
into the left ventricle of the heart; and there partly by its subtility, partly
by its expansive motion, so conspire with the pulse of the heart, as to conduce
to the rarefaction and subtiliation of the more thin and inflammable parts of
the blood, that so they may be made both commodious fuel for the Fire burning
in the heart, and also fit matter of the vital spirits. All the difference is,
there are no Ashes made in the heart, the Flame thereof being more pure, than
focal-fire, and subsisting in a matter as fine and subtle, as spirits of wine.
Nor are there any sooty exhalations; such as arise from oil burned in a Lamp:
but such a Flame is perpetually revived out of the blood in the heart, as is
made by the purest spirits of wine set on fire.

And inferred from the structure of the Lungs.
For, to what purpose does both the Vena arteriosa, and Arteria Venosa divide
and disperse into so many branches and surcles, throughout the lobes of the
Lungs; unless it be to convey the aer brought into them (out of the Bronchia,
or pipes derived from the Aspera arteria) together with the blood, into the
left ventricle of the heart, there to excite the vital flame? For, certain it
is, from the structure of these vessels, that the Aer does not arrive at and
enter the heart, pure and sincere (as it ought to do, in case it were to
refrigerate the heart) but mixed with the blood returning out of the Lungs:
which is the reason, why in the dissections of living creatures, no aer is to
be found in the Arteria venosa, being, before it comes thither, thoroughly
commixed or confused with the blood. Nor can we force aer into the heart,
through the Lungs of a dead body; because the motion of the blood is then
ceased. And this we conceive to be the Principal End, or Use of Inspiration.

As for that of Exspiration, it seems to be no The Use of Exspiration.
together with the Halitus, or vapors of the blood, that steam from it, while
it is circulating through the Lungs. For, as to that Antique opinion, of the
discharging of Fullginous Exhalations issuing from the heart; to the reasons by
us formerly alleged to discredit the Generation of them, we shall subjoyn two
or three convincing ones, to disprove their Exclusion through the Lungs. (1)
The motion of the blood out of the Lungs, by the Arteria Venosa, into the left
ventricle of the Heart, being continual and strong; does manifestly forbid any
thing to come from the Heart, into the Lungs that way: and (2) the situation of
the Valves in the same Arteria Venosa, does as much. (3) That the Aer passing
to the Heart, and the (supposed) Fuliginous exhalations issuing from the Heart,
should be carried through one and the same vessel, by contrary motions; is
insolent to Nature, and incompetent to the economy of the body.

Problem. Certain it is, A Problem, of the Respiration of the Foetus, in the
Mother's womb.
that the Foetus, while in the Mother's womb, does receive nourishment (not by
the Umbilical Vessels, for in them nothing is contained, but Blood, which is
not the Aliment of the parts; and the Umbilical Vein serves only to the
Circulation of the blood, by bringing back to the heart, what the two Umbilical
Arteries carried from it into the Placenta Uterina: but) by the Mouth, sucking
in that milky liquor, wherein he swimmes: which Hippocrates long since, and Dr.
Harvey of late, have undeniably proved. Now, this being so, does it not seem
necessary, that the Foetus should also have the use of Respiration? For, since
all Suction is by Impul^ion (as we have elsewhere at large demonstrated) being
caused only by the pressure of the thing sucked, by the Aer impelled in round
(as we lately expressed, in the cause of the influx of the aer into the Lungs,
in Inspiration) certainly, without the help of aer, the Foetus cannot possibly
suck in his nourishment. To this Reason (and we think it a weighty one) may be
added, (1) the Authority of the Divine old Man, lib de Nature. pueri.
who in most express terms says, (...) [viz. Foetibus] (...), Puer ab ^lto
respirat, and ore and naribus. (2) that Chickens breathe in their shells
(through which the aer has a more difficult passage, than through the
secundines) and Fishes in the water. And as the Chicken pipes within the shell
not yet broken; so has it been observed and recorded by sundry learned and
authentical Writers, that Infants have been heard to cry in their Mothers
wombs: which were impossible, unless they enjoyed the benefit of Respiration.

(3) The posture of the Child in the womb seems to assert the same. For, as
there is an ample space betwixt the coats of the Secundines, and the Child, to
the end that a sufficient magazine of milk for his sustenance, might be stored
up, and conserved therein; so is not that whole space filled up with that
Liquor, but in the upper part there remains so much space unpossessed by any
thing but Aer, as is sufficient for so gentle a Respiration, as the Infant has
need of: just as in the blunter end of an Egg, we perceive a certain empty
space after the Hen has sat upon it. And lest the Chorion should at any time
be corrugated or shrieveled up together, and so streighten or compresse either
the Liquor, or the Infant; Nature has affixed the same to the Placentae
Uterina, to the end, that adhering to the bottom or upper part of the womb, it
might hang fast, as an Apple hangs by its stem, or as our Globes of Glass are
hung up by strings to the Seeling of a room. So that the Chorion thus adhaering
to the Placenta Vterina, which is fastened to the bottom of the womb, and the
Amnios in like manner adhering to the Ch^rion, in the same upper part; and the
lower part of each membrane being depressed by the weight of the Infant, and of
the Humors contained in them: it thence comes to pass, that this Natural
Machine both of the Child, and Membranes (though at first it were perfectly
round, as the yolk of an Egg) is afterward made of an oval figure. For, though
the Foetus, sitting incurved or bowed forward, as much as possible does keep
himself in a round figure, because of taking up the less room (for he sits
with his legs crossed, his heels drawn up to his buttocks, his elbowes resting
on his knees, one hand held up close to his ear, the other to his cheek, for
the more firm and easy sustentation of his head) yet, in that situation he
has need of a Mansion of an Oval Figure, that swimming in liquor, he might
keep his head above water, and at his pleasure take in his nourishment by his
mouth, and also inspire the temperate aer surrounding his head, in the void
space of the Secundines; according to the opinion of Hippocrates newly recited.
(4) Nor is the ingress of Aer into the womb impossible. For, albeit the mouth
of the womb, in pregnant women, be shut up, so as to exclude ones finger, or
(as others will have it) a small probe: yet is it not so sealed or luted up, as
to exclude the Aer; as may be inferred from hence, that many Femals have
superfoe^ations, and more women (especially in this our moist Island) are
troubled with the Fluor albus, all the time of their Gravidation; neither of
which could be, unless the Cervix Uteri were pervious: For, if there may be an
ingress for the seed of the male after a former Conception; and as free an
egress for the matter of the Fluor albus, all the time of the gestation of the
Foetus* then, doubtless, Hac etiam penetret per cuncta meabilis Aer. These
Reasons duly perpended, though it seems a Paradox, yet is it no light and vain
Conjecture, that the Foetus does respire in the womb, at least gently and
placidly, and in proportion to the pulsation of his heart; which being calmly
and softly moved (as are the hearts of Dormice and other Animals, that sleep
all the winter) has but a small necessity of Aer. However, reflecting upon the
singular fabrique of the vessels in the heart of an Infant unborn, which all
Anatomists conceive made by the providence of Nature, only in defect of
Respiration; as we proposed it a Problem, so we leave

Here also we may opportunely touch upon the Motion of the Brain, The Motion of
the Brain dependent, not upon Respiration but upon the Pulsation of the
Artsries.
which consisting (as that of the Lungs) of a Diastole and Systole, many have
referred to the Inspiration and Exspiration of Aer; as if the Brain were
dilated for the admission of Aer, and contracted again for the exclusion of it.
Whereas, indeed, this Motion does not belong (1) to the substance of the Brain;
for, that being very soft, tender, and delicate, seems incapable of any such
dilatation and compression. Nor (2) to the Membranes investing the brain;
because, as Riolan observed in the head of a Sheep, the diastole and systole of
the brain has been continued long, after part of the skull and Membrans also
were cut off. But only to the Arteries, (1) because the Motion of the brain is
exactly coincident and concordant with that of the Arteries, as may be
discerned by the touch, in the heads of Infants new born, and in large wounds
of the skull. (2) Because the chief Pulsation is in the upper part of the Dura
Matter, which is conspersed with store of Arteries ascending from the Plexus
Arteriosus Mirabilis, and disseminating themselves upon it. (3) Because Waleus
observed, that in some persons, who fell into extrem agonies, and swooning
fits, upon great fractures of the skull, the motion of the brain ceased, and
was begun again, as their Pulses recovered. (4) Of what Use should the inspired
Aer be to the Brain? For Refrigeration, It cannot be; the temper of the brain
being such, as seems to require rather Ca^efaction. And, as for the Generation
of Animal spirits; Dr. Harvey has upon good reasons made it doubtful, whether
there be any such or not: and if there be, certainly they consist only of the
purest and most subtle parts of the blood, and not of Aer, by the admistion of
which they must needs become more crass and unfit for those noble uses,
Encheirid. Anatom. lib. 4. c. 2.
to which they are consigned. And, therefore, Riolan said well; Nec spiritibus
permiscetur Aer in Cerebro, quia debent esse subtilissim^; alioquin permixtione
aeris cr^ssiores evaderent, nec tam celeriter in universum eorpus excurrerent
per nervos.

Nor must we here omit to touch upon the Secundary Uses of Respiration, The

which are Manifold. For, it serves (1) to the creation of the Voice (whether
Articulate, as in Man; or Inarticulate, as in Bruits) the Lungs exploding the
inspired aer, through the Aspera Arteria, with such impetuosity and swiftness,
as that its frequent and strong Elisions in the head of the Larynx, the throat
and other parts of the mouth, cause it to yield a found. (2) to the
Distribution of the Chyle both out of the stomach and guts, through the venae
Lacteae, into the grand Receptacle, and out of that Receptacle into the ductus
Chyliferi: the middle part of the Diaphragme, in Inspiration, depressing the
stomach and guts; and its two long carneous productions lying so immediately
under the Receptacle, as that they cannot be distended, but they must at the
same time also distend it, and so express the Chyle out of it. (3) to the
Exclusion of the Excrements both of the Guts and Bladder; the depression of the
Diaphragme together with the compression of the Abdomen, streightning and
urging those parts. (4) to Smelling; the odours being brought into the
Nostrills together with the inspired Aer. (5) to Coughing, Sternutation,
Exscreation, and Emunction of the Nose; while the breath is driven forth with
violence and suddenly. And (6) to assist the whole body in any strong and
vehement motion; while, either the Inspiration being made gentle and small, and
the breath kept in, the Muscles of the Abdomen and other parts are consequently
stretched; and so we are the better enabled to lift up things of great weight,
or to repel things making resistance by force of impulsion or otherwise: or,
after a great inspiration, a vehement and sudden ex^piration succeeds, and
then the Muscles are extended together with the like force, so as the Arms and
Legs are strengthened either in giving a blow, or leaping, or other the like
efforts, to which main force is required. And thus much of Respiration.

with the knowledge of sundry Secrets, which she wholly concealed from our
Predecessors) These vessels are not the least: nor can you have a complete
History of the Economy of Nature in an Animal, without assuming both them, and
the Liquor they contain, into particular consideration.

To whom the Honor of their Invention To whom the honor of their Discovery is
to be ascribed.
is yet in dispute. For, though that most diligent and perspicacious Anatomist,
Thom: Bartholinus, be the man, who first wrote of them; and He challenges the
glory of their discovery wholly to Himself: yet is it well known, that our
Country man, Dr. Iolive (a person of singular dexterity, and admirable
felicity, in dissection of all sorts of Animals, as well living, as dead) had
discovered and mentioned them to many Physicians of best note, and among the
rest particularly to that eminent Master in Anatomy, Dr. Glisson (who makes
grateful acknowledgment thereof, in his most elaborate and judicious Book, de
Anatom. Hepatis) more than a whole year, before Bartholine wrote his Treatise
particularly concerning them. So that it being improbable Dr. Iolive should
borrow the notice of these Water-vessels from Bartholine; and as improbable, on
the otherside, that Bartholine should receive the first Hint of them from Dr.
Iolive: it seems equitable the Honor of this invention should be divided
betwixt Them, as Men, whom good Fortune, conspiring with their industry, might
happily bring to the investigation of the same thing, near about the same time;
notwithstanding they were divided by so large a distance, as is betwixt England
and Denmark, and held no commerce each with other by Letters, or otherwise.
But whoever was the Inventor, certain it is the Invention it self is of
admirable advantage to the Republique of Physic: and therefore, we shall
briefly recite the sum of what has been written concerning their
Description, their Origination, their Insertion, and their Uses.

Lympheducts are certain Whitish Vessels, Their Description.
in many places of the body running along close upon the veins, and sometimes
embracing them in various circles, as the surcles of the Vine tvvine about the
branches of an Elm, consisting of a very thin and transparent membranous
substance, not much unlike a spiders web; in Figure for the most part
roundish; in magnitude seldom exceeding a Ravens quill^; furnished with
sundry tender valves* and containing a Liquor thin, insipid, and for the most
part vvhitish, but sometimes tinged either with blood, or with a yellovvish
color.

Of these are two sorts; Differences.
some accompanying Vena Fortae, the Iliacal veins, those diffeminated upon the
Testicles in both sexes, and upon the bottom of the womb in Females.

Accordingly, Origination.
their Origin is tvvofold; for Capsula communis: and those in the Limbs, have
their original from those parts; but, whether from the capillary veins, or
from the capillary Arteries, or from the extremities of the Nerves, is not yet
determined. Only we have the late observations of Olaus Ra^beak (Physician to
Queen Christina of Sueden) to attest, that they arise almost from all parts; he
having found them also in the Lungs, Mediastinum, Heart, suspensory ligament of
the Liver, stomach, spleen, loins and sundry other parts.

Their Insertion likewise is tvvofold. Insertion.
For, the grand Receptacle of the Chyle, into which as into a cistern, they
infuse that thin liquor, which they carry in their pipes; that so the same
being there commixed with the Chyle, may be conveyed along with it, through the
Lacteae Thoracicae, into the subclavian vein. And those above the Diaphragme,
or such as arise from the Limbs, are inserted into the External jugular Veins,
into which they disembogue their several rivulets. Wherefore they have no
common Trunck, but (like several Springs of water) rising up here and there
from diverse parts, they all tend into two large channels, viz. the Receptacle
of the Chyle, and the Vena Axillaris, that their streams may all meet in the
common Ocean of the Heart.

Situation and Progress, it is thus. In the Arms, Situation and Progress.
they creep up by the side of the Vena Brachialis, to which they are firmly
connected, and so ascend together with it to the Vena Axillaris, into which
they open themselves with a small inlet, or Orifice, that is guarded with a
valve, set there by Nature, to prevent the reflux of the liquor out of the
Axillary vein. And, from the Thighs, many in like manner climb up in the
company of the Crural and Iliacal veins, which they encircle in some places
more closely, in others more laxely; and in this manner they mount up to the
Mesentery, where together with the small branches of the Vena Portae, they are
terminated. Again, those issuing from the Liver, or Bladder of the Gall, do
also descend in company of the Vena Portae, to the middle Glandule of the
Mesentery, and are therein terminated. But, if with a more curious eye you
trace these proceeding from the Liver, up to their very original; you may
perceive them to enter the Capsula Communis, of the Vena Portae; and therein so
to lose themselves, as that you cannot discern their progress from thence: yet
it is probable, that being included in the same Capsula Communis, they follow
the distribution of the same, and never stray from it into the Parenchyma of
the Liver; because, if they did, how comes it, that they are no where to be
found in the parenchyma, no not in that part of it, where the Capsula Communis
is?

Concerning the Liquor they contain, there are two Difficulties, viz. (1)
Whence they receive it? (2) Why they return it into the Receptacle of the
Chyle, and into the Heart?

The Former is solved, by saying, that the liquor Liquor deduced partly from
the Arteries, and
partly from the Nerves. That the Arteries have some share in bringing that
mild and thin Liquor into the Lympheducts, may be argued thus. The blood, being
by the Vital Heat and Motion, agitated in the Arteries, does necessarily
diffuse abundance of Vapors into those parts, into which it is immitted; and
this so much the more, because those vapors are repressed and kept in, by the
thickness of the coats of the greater Arteries, until they are driven into
the smaller arteries, through whose thinner coats they more easily transpire.
And these vapors thus dispersed, ^re for the most part retained and
re-collected by the Fibrous and Membranous parts, and by that means condensed
into a Liquor, which makes one part of that Humor which the Lympheducts carry
away. For, we are not to conceive, that that Liquor was preexistent in the
Arteries, under the same form it afterward obtains in the Lympheducts; and that
being protruded together with the blood out of the Arteries into the substance
of the parts, it is in those parts separated from the blood, by any kind of
Percolation, as the Urine is in the Kidneys: because there are in all parts
Veins answering to the Arteries, and those ample enough to export whatever
liquor is by them imported: nor can any reason be given, why that watery humor
should be at all separated from the blood; seeing it is no Excrement of the
blood, though it may be accounted an Excrement of the parts, from which
immediately it is immitted into the Lympheducts. No Excrement of the blood,
because it is again brought into the blood; and Nature uses not to lose her
labor, or to separate things each from other, on purpose to mix them again
afterward.

Secondly, that the Nerves also contribute some part of this Liquor to the
Lympheducts, Partly from the Nerves.
may be inferred from hence; (1) that whatsoever Liquor arises from vapors
condensed, is perfectly pure, thin, and transparent: but this liquor is not so,
and therefore it is necessary some other Humor should be admixt to it, which
gives it a greater thickness, than a simple dist^lled water usually has. For,
this whole liquor is more dense, and less diaphanous, and sometimes white like
milk, sometimes tincted with yellow, and sometimes with blood, like water
wherein raw Flesh has been washed. (2) It is an opinion highly agreeable with
Reason, that the thicker part of the Liquor found in these Water-conduits, is
the Vehicle of the Succus Nutritious, which being dispensed from the brain and
spinal Marrow, to all parts for their nourishment, by the Nerves, is
assimilated into their substance, leaving its thinner part (which before
served to promote and facilitate its distribution through the slender passages
of the Nerves) to be infused into the Lympheducts, which return it into the
blood, for a double use, viz.

First, to prevent the Coagulation of the blood, Uses of that Liquor.
Secondly, to promote the Mication of the blood; for this thin liquor, being
formerly advanced to the state of Volatility, or exhalation: it easily united
to the Vital blood, and does as easily advance the mication of it.

But, what we here say, of the derivation of one part of this Liquor from the
Nerves, will be more illustrated by what follows, concerning the
dispensation of the nourishment by the Nerves.

OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NOURISHMENT THROUGH THE NERVES. Exercitation the
Tenth.
Of the Distribution of the Nourishment through the Nervs.
Article
Fibrous, That the Nervs are the vessels carrying the Nutritive juice to the
parts; argued
and Membranous parts of the body; and transferred that noble office upon a
certain milder and sweeter juice, congenerous to that spermatical Matter, of
which those parts are first made up: Lest therefore, we should defraud your
curiosity of such further satisfaction, as this new and paradoxicall (yet most
reasonable) opinion requires; we must no longer omit to explain (at least
according to what light the excellent Dr. Glisson has given, in so obscure an
Argument) From whence, and by what vessels, the Nutritive juice is distributed
to all parts of the body.

The Thesis is, that the proper and adequate Nutriment of the Parts, is derived
to them from the Brain and Spinal Marrow, by the Nervs: and the Reasons
asserting it, are these.

(1) In the Palsy, it is observed, from the Atrophy, or decay of nutrition in
parts affected with the Palsy, and whose Nervs have been wounded.
that the

This may be confirmed by an observation of our own. A certain woman having a
Nerv pricked by an unskilful Surgeon, as he was letting her blood in the
right arm, was at first surprised with Convulsions of that Arm; and those
ceasing, there ensued so great an Atrophy of that member, as nothing now (for
the woman is yet living) remains of it but skin and bones: which extreme
extenuation, doubtless, is to be referred to the want of passage for the Succus
Nutritious, through the principal from the beneficial use of Cephalique
Emplastres in Consumptions from ulcerated Lungs.
no such accident (but an Aneurisme) usually following upon the incision of an
Artery.

(2) In a Phthisis, or Consumption from ulcerated Lungs, Cephalique Emplastres
(though composed of hearing and drying ingredients, and in that respect seeming
very incompetent for such a Disease) are found by experience to be very
beneficial to the sick; and that, not only because they stop the defluxion of
humors from the head upon the Lungs: but also (and chiefly) because they warm
and corroborate the Brain and Nervs, and so promote the Nutrition of the Parts.
Which effect cannot be expected from their Heat and Dryness, but from some
comfortable influence transmitted to the Nervs, by which they are strengthened
and made fit for the performance of their office, viz. the conveying the
nourishment from the brain to the parts.

From the Fatness of men endowed with large, open, spongy and moist nerves
so are those inclined to grow Fat, who have large, moist, open, and spongy
Nervs; for, such Nervs afford much Aliment, and distribute it easily.

From the roscid humor exstilling from wounds of the joints and sinews.
there distills a certain roscid Humor, not much unlike the white of an Egg;
which being not likely to come from either the Arteries or veins, in respect
they carry nothing but blood; why may we not believe it to drop out of the
Nervs? Also in such wounds, in issues, in hollow Teeth, etc. there grow up
frequently certain fleshy Excrescences, or Proud Flesh; which being exceeding
sensible, and subject to acute pain upon the least touch, cannot but have a
very near relation to the Nervs: and blood certainly is very unapt to produce
such Excrescences, to the Generation of which some matter analogous to the
sperme is necessarily required.

(5) The same may be said also of Wens From the Material Principle of Wens and
Scrophulous Tumors.
and not from any humor effused out of the Arteries or veins; blood being a
liquor partaking of too much Asperity and Acrimony, to be the material
Principle of such Tumors: besides, we have the testimony of our sense, that the
rudiments of such Tumors, are like Eggs included in a membranous filme, which
contains a humor resembling the white of an Egg, but nothing like blood.
Moreover, these Tumors frequently tend to some kind of Formation, though but an
imperfect one; producing sometimes a mass or lump of Flesh, sometimes a Worm,
or other (such Monster; which is a strong Argument, that their primitive Matter
is not blood, but a certain juice much milder and sweeter, and brought to the
parts in which they are generated, by the Nervs.

(6) This Opinion is further confirmed by From the Matter of the seed* and the
Manner of its praeparation in the Testicles.
For, the Seed seems to be generated, not of the blood (as has been vulgarly
believed) but of a matter much sweeter and more generous, brought into the
Seminary vessels, from the brain, by the Nervs: forasmuch as the Nervs are
both more copiously and more deeply disseminated into the parenchyma of the
Testicles, than either the Arteries, or the veins; which is the reason, why
their inward substance is white, not red. Again, their proper Coat appears to
be nothing else, but a certain expansion of the Nervs inserted into them; from
which Coat many small Nervs are on all parts derived to the middle of the
Testicles, where meeting together, they make the long Nervous vessel, that
manifestly exonerateth it self into the Chanel of the Epididymis, as may be
plainly seen in the stones of a Horse, Bull, Boar, or other large Animal. As
for the veins of the Testicles, they serve only to export the blood imported by
the Arteries: and the Arteries themselves, though they variously diffuse
themselves round about the Testicles; and accompanying the Nervs, tend in
diverse places from the inward coat, to the Ductus Seminalis (situate in the
very middle of the Testicle) and are connected thereunto; yet they rarely
disperse any branches, until, reflecting from that chanel, they have begun
their progress back again toward the Circumference of the Testicle. But, there
they send out some surcles to the outside of the Testicle; to the end that,
those capillary veins, opening themselves into the substance of the Testicle,
may the more easily receive the blood effused out of the Arteries, and so carry
it off again. Because, that blood, if left there, would soon obstruct the
parenchyma of the Testicles, and disturb the praeparation of the seed. Yet
these Arteries no where insinuate themselves into the Nervous, or Seminal
Chanel, or infuse the least drop of blood into them: So that it is more then
probable; they serve rather for the vivification of the Testicles, by bringing
the vital blood and spirits into them, than for the importation of the Seminal
Matter. Now, the Nervs implanted in the Testicles, cannot be in order to their
Motion, because they have none that is voluntary; nor is there any need of
them, as to sensation: and therefore it is more credible, that their Use is
only to bring in some certain Liquor, for the making of seed. Furthermore, the
Testicles are furnished with many Lympheducts, which could be of little Use
unto them, unless there were some other vessels present also, by which that
generous Liquor is brought in, whose thinner and superfluous part those
Lympheducts are framed to export. Add to this, that the seed is a liquor much
more noble and Ambrosiack; than the blood; as is evident even from hence, that
a small expense of seed does more exhaust the spirits, than the loss of twenty
times so much blood. Which doubtless, is the reason, why Heaviness and
dejection of spirit, do always ensue after the delights of Venus; and it has
been observed, that in men excessively addicted to women, the Brain it self is
not only much debilitated, but made also lax, thin, and watery. The
Gout-likewise is generally an Attendant of immoderate venery; because the
joints and nervous parts being much debilitated, and the roscid and Unctuous
Liquor of the Nervs, deprived of its milder and sweeter part, the Succus
Nutritious becomes too thin and sharp, and so is more expeditely discharged upon
the joints.

from the Glutinous ma^ter issuing from the ends of broken bones, and cementing
them together again.
there sweats forth a certain Glutinous substance, very beneficial toward the
uniting and cementing them together again: which liquor cannot proceed from the
Arteries, whose office is only to convey the blood (a liquor vastly different
from this Glue): and since besides them, and the Nervs, there is no vessel yet
found out, that carries any humor from the Center to the circumference of the
body; it is very reasonable to conceive, that this Glue is derived from the
Nervs.

(8) The White of Eggs is brought into the womb of the Hen, by the Nervs. For,
it has no resemblance at all to blood; nor can it be generated of blood,
unless by way of separation, but there can be no separation made in that part,
in respect it is wholly destitute of any Parenchyma, which is absolutely
necessary to the separation of any two Humors one from the other. Whereas the
secretion of the Succus Nutritious brought by the Nervs, seems to want no
parenchyma, and may be effected in parts the most bloodless. And that such a
Secretion of the Succus Nutritious is made in the womb, is manifest from the
great number of Lympheducts returning from thence, which Nature had nener
ordained in that place, unless it were to export the thinner and superfluous
part of the Succus Nutritious brought to the womb by the Nerves. So that the
very Lympheducts seem to teach us, that the Succus Nutritious is derived into
the womb by the Nerves; and that the watery part thereof being protruded into
the Lympheducts, the more unctuous and profitable is transmitted into the
cavity of the womb, there to make the White of the Egg.

(1) In the Rickets there is generally observed Inequality of Nutrition, From
the Unequal nourishment of some part, in that Rickets.
which (according to the most of probability) proceeds from the less aptitude
of some Nerves, to carry the nourishment, than of others. For, that Disease
seems to be seated originally and principally in the Spinal Marrow without the
skull, and in the Nerves thence propagated: and therefore those Nerves must be
more weak, languid, and unfit to transmit the Succus Nutritious, than such as
arise from the Brain, or Marrow within the skull. And hence is it, doubtless,
that the Head, Face, and Viscera of the Abdomen (all which derive their Nerves
from the Marrow within the skull) grow excessively great: while the Arms and
Legs become lean, flaccid, and enervate, as being supplied with nourishment by
Nerves, issuing from the Spinal Marrow without the skull. Moreover, because it
sometimes happens, that some one particular branch of this or that Nerve, is
more debilitated, than the rest; thence it comes, that one part of a Limb is
better supplied with nourishment, than the other; and so, by that unequal
Nutrition of its parts, the whole member grows crooked. And these are (among
many others) the chief Arguments, that have persuaded us, that the Nourishment
of the parts is brought to them by the Nerves.

Difficulties encumbering this opinion, Three grand Difficulties, troubling
this opinion.
there are 3 that especially deserve consideration, viz.

(1) That in the Nerves no passages or cavities can be discerned, through which
the Succus Nutritious may be conveyed.

(2) That in the dissection of Animals alive, and the application of a ligature
to any Nerve, no swelling can be observed to arise on either side the Ligature:
and upon cutting off a Nerve, very little or none at all of this supposed
Liquor can be discerned to distill from either end; contrary to what happens
in the binding and cutting off any other vessel.

(3) No such Liquor has yet been found in the Nerves of bodies dissected.

And yet these Difficulties are not weighty enough to counterbalance the Reason
formerly alleged; forasmuch as they may be easily solved, by Answering to the

First; Solution of the First, asserting the possibility of the flux of the
Nutritive juice, through the Nervs, notwithstanding no manifest Hollowness can
be discerned in them.
that though no manifest hollowness be discernable in the Nerves (such as is in
Arteries and Veins) yet is it not impossible, but the supposed Succus Nutritious
may distill gently through them. For, it is well known by the experiment of
lowing the Spinal Marrow, or any Nerve in water; that the Nerves are made up of
many small Fibrous, Filaments, or threads coh^ering together, with a soft
medullary substance betwixt them: much like the Indian Canes, which, though in
the cortex so hard and compact, as to yield fire upon percussion with a
Tobacco-pipe, and as solid within as many sorts of wood; being yet composed of
many small and long Filaments, with small perforations betwixt them, are
pervious from one end to the other, so as a man may without much difficulty
blow his spittle quite through them. Likewise, in the leaves of plants, there
shoots up a certain small Nervous rib, arising from the Foot-stalke, by which
they are fastened to the branch; and without which nothing of nourishment can be
brought to them. This little rib running up in the middle, sends forth various
lesser surcles or threads equally to all parts of the leaf, so as the whole is
thereby equally nourished. And yet, if you cut off this rib, or any one branch
of it, you shall discover none the smallest cavity or hollowness therein, nor
any drop of juice issuing out of it, unless in the Sowthistle, Esula,
Celendine, and some few other plants, which emit either a milky, or a yellowish
juice, which certainly is their nourishment. And though other plants yield not,
upon cutting of their leaves, the like juice; yet most certain it is, they are
nourished with some kind of juice or other, derived to them by their
Footstalk: So that we can perceive no such absolute necessity of any manifest
cavity in their small ribbs, for the dispensation of their nourishing juice, as
this Objection seems to import; especially when we consider, that the Motion of
the Succus Nutritious in those slender Filaments or threads, is very gentle,
slow, and insensible; not rapid, or Violent, as the motion of the blood in the
Arteries and Veins of Animals. Now, since our sense is witness, that liquor
may be transmitted through a Fire-cane though sufficiently solid and compact;
and our Reason assures, that the Nutritive juice of Plants is distributed to
all parts of the leaves, through the Foot-stalk, and little Rib running up in
the middle of each leaf, though we can discern no manifest passages, or
channels, through which it flows: Why may not the nourishment of Animals be,
in like manner, dispensed to the parts, through the Nerves, notwithstanding
they appear destitute of any conspicuous hollowness? But yet some Nerves there
are not so impervious, but they admit a small style or probe into them; in
which number are the Optique and Odoratory Nerves: and though the rest have not
the like visible hollowness, yet reflecting upon this, that all the Nerves are
framed for the performance of some one Common Office, it is not unreasonable to
conceive, that all of them are perforated more or less, so as to be capable of
conveying the Succus Nutritious. This may be in good part inferred even from
hence, that the Apoplexy often ends in a Palsy; in which case all Physicians
grant, that the Humor oppressing and obstructing the Brain, is discharged
thence upon the Spinal Marrow, and Nerves affected; which could not be, unless
the Nerves were capable of being obstructed by the Humor protruded or impelled
into them.

You will reply, perhaps; that they are capable, indeed, of the influx of
Animal Spirits, unless their originals chance to be obstructed, as in the case
of the Palsy: but, as for any Liquor, or Humor (of far less subtility, than
those Spirits) it is impossible they should admit it into them. And we may
return, that the supposed Animal Spirits (nor, intruth, the Vital ones) are any
where to be found in the whole body, pure or sincere, and without mixture; and
therefore, if the Nerves were framed for the reception of any matter pure and
distinct from all others, certainly that matter must be of a grosser substance,
than simple and abstracted Spirits.

Furthermore, that there are small Channels in the Nerves, may be perceived by
their Compression in our limbs, as when we have long fate upon a hard seat, or
otherwise straightened our sinews; for, in that case, we feel a certain stupor,
or Numbness (the vulgar say, their limbs are asleep) in that part, to which the
compressed Nerves are prolonged: a certain document, that the free passage of
some matter through them, is at that time intercepted; and the compression
being removed, there instantly ensues a kind or troublesome Tingling or
Pricking, as if the part were pierced with needls; and this only because what
was arrested and intercepted there, begins again its former liberty of motion.
These things duly weighed, we may lawfully conclude* that it is not
sufficiently (...), that the Nerves are impenetrable by the Succus Nutritious,
only because they have no manifest cavity.

Second; that in the dissection of an Animal alive, Solution of the Second,
yielding the reason, why no swelling a^iseth in a Nerv, when bound with a
Ligature, in a living Animal.
it generally happens that by reason of the extreme striving and agony of the
poor tortured Creature, before the dissector can come, either to apply a
ligature unto, or to cut a Nerve; all the Liquor contained therein is squeezed
forth into the part, wherein the Nerve is terminated; so that no wonder, if
there appears neither swelling on either side of the ligature, nor any
exstillation of liquor from the ends of the Nerve cut off. And this Violent
streyning of the Nerves in dying Animals, and the squeezing of the Liquor
contained in them, into the parts to which they are inserted; seems to be the
Cause, why that Lympheduct, which corresponds to the Nerve bound or cut, is
found more full and distended, than ordinary, as has been of late frequently
observed. And yet we have been assured by judicious and credible persons, that
they have seen no small quantity of the Nutritive juice exstilling out of the
Nervous Chord of the Thigh in a man; and pres^ed some of it out of the Axillary
Chord, in Dogs.

Third, as to the Second; adding withal, that Solution of the Third, showing
the reason, why the Succus Nutritious is not found in the nerves of dead bodies
dissected.
of the cutting of the Nervous Fibers in diverse plants, without effusion of the
least drop of their Alimentary juice) the Motion of the Succus Nutritious
through the Nervs, is neither Continual, nor impetuous, but by intervalls, and
gentle, so as not to be perceived: and that all of it being forced into the
parts, by reason of the strong Contention or streyning of the Nervs, in the
very agony of death; and all impulsion of humors in the body, ceasing after
death; it cannot seem strange, that none of the Succus Nutritious can be found
in the Nervs of bodies dissected after death.

These Grand Objections thus solved, it remains that we enquire; (1) What is
the Principium Elaboratioms of the Succus Nutritious, or where it is praepared:
(2) What is the Principium Dispensationis of it, or whence it is immediately
infused into the Nervs, which convey it to the parts: (3) By what vessels it
is imported into that principium Dispensationis: (4) What kind of Motion it
has in the distributing Nervs: and (5) What is the Cause of that Motion.

Concerning the First, What is the Principium Elaborationis of the Nutritive
juice; viz. the Glandules of the Mesentery, of the Loins, and the Thymus.
viz. the Parts wherein Succus Nutritious is prepared, immediately before it is
imbibed by the Nervs; there is good reason for us to believe, that this work is
effected in the Glandules of the M^sentery, in the Three Glandules of the
Loins, and in the Thymus, or Glandule in the Thorax. Which opinion that we may
the better explain, it is requisite we make a short Digression concerning the
Differences and Uses of the Glandules, according to the observations, and
consequent Conjectures of Dr. Glisson, and Dr. Wharton.

Of the Glandules in the body, there seem to be 3 sorts (respectively to the
Nervs) whereof some are inservient to Excretion, some to Reduction, and some to
Nutrition. For, though it be most true, that the Common office of all the
Glandules, is Secernere, to make some separation; yet is it no less true, that
that separation is various, as tending to Excretion in some, in others to
Reduction, and in others to Nutrition; and the Matter it self, which is
separated by those diverse ways of Secretion, being likewise various, the first
sort being a mere Excrement; the Second, an Excrement only in relation to some
parts, but profitable in relation to others, and therefore not to be excluded,
but retained; and the last, the true Succus Nutritious.

Under the First Classis of those Glandules, are comprehended the Testicles,
the Prostates, the Vesiculae Seminales, the Paps in women, and the Glandulae
Maxillares, or spitting Glandules under the Tongue: all which are furnished
with a peculiar Excretory vessel, by which they discharge and avoid some
superfluous matter brought into them by the Nervs.

To the Second (inservient to the secretion of a humor, and the reduction of it
into the veins afterward) belong the Glandulae Renales, or Deputy Kidneys, the
Glandules near the Fund^ment, those adjacent to the Oesophagus, the Parotides,
Axillary, Inguinal, etc. Glandules. All which receive from the Nervs, a certain
humor more rough and acrimonious (and approaching to the nature of the blood)
than is agreeable with the Succus Nutritious; and therefore the Nervs, by the
help of these Glandules discharge themselves of it, and retain only the more
sweet, mild and profitable juice. But, because the Humor, thus rejected by the
Nervs, has some affinity to the blood, and in respect of its thinness is
commodious for the more easy transportation of the blood, through the narrow
meanders of the veins: therefore is it not excluded out of the body, as an
absolute Excrement, but imbibed by the Glandules adjacent to the veins, and by
them imported into the veins. Which seems to be the most satisfactory reason,
that has hitherto been given, why such Glandules are placed, for the most
part, near to the greater Divisions of the Nervs and veins; viz. that they may
the more conveniently receive the humor effused out of the Nervs, and deliver
it again into the veins.

And to the Last (inservient to the Praeparation of the true Succus Nutritious)
belong the Glandules of the Mesentery, the 3 Glandules of the (...) and the
Thymus, or single Glandule in the Chest, near the Ductus Lactcus Thoracicus,
and in Brutes called the Sweetbread. For, (1) as to the Glandules of the
Mesentery; Anatome assures us, that a great multitude of the Venae Lacteae
tend unto them, and are in them distributed into surcles extremely small; and
that other small branches (or rather roots of milky veins take their beginning
in the same Glandules, and progressing from thence, make a second sort or race
of venae lacteae, as we have more particularly declared before, in the 2d Art.
of the 3d Exercit. Now, to what end has Nature made these two kinds of Venae
Lacteae, one sort to import the Chyle into these Glands, and the other to
export it? unless it be, that the Chyle should either suffer some Alteration,
or be separated from some Humor, in these Glandules? Alteration it suffers
none; because it is carried off again in the same form, as it was brought in.
And, therefore, it remains probable, that it is brought into the Glandules,
only that it might be separated from some parts less agreeable with the nature
of pure nourishment. Now, what should the Humor be, that is thus to be
separated? An absolute Excrement it cannot be, because these Glandules have no
peculiar Excretory vessels, as all parts inservient to any Excretion have. Nor
is it like that matter, which is reduced into the veins, by the Reductory
Glandules: for, if it were such, it would need no such separation at all, the
rest of the Chyle soon after flowing into the subclavian vein, and it being
easy for Nature to have contrived, that the chyle brought into these
Glandules, might have accompanied the rest in that journey, without any
intermediate Secretion. This considered, it is reasonable to conceive, that the
Liquor separated from the Chyle, in these Glandules, does not belong either to
the First, or Second sort of Matter ( viz. the absolute Excrement, and the
Excrement Relative) formerly mentioned; but is the true Succus Nutritious. Which
being granted, it is not difficult to explore, by what vessels this Succus
Nutritious is from thence carried away. For, since it cannot be thence exported
by any peculiar vessels, nor by veins; it must be by the Nervs. (2) As for the
Three Glandulae Lumbares; it is probable, They also are official to the Nervs,
in the same way; and that for two important Reasons. First, because they are
furnished with Venae Lacteae of both sorts, some tending to them, and others
propagated from them, and exonerating themselves into the Common Receptacle: in
all points like the Glandules of the Mesentery. Secondly, because in such
Animals, as have the Glandules of the Mesentery very large, these Glandulae
Lumbares are either very small, or wholly deficient; and in men, in whom the
Glandules of the Mesentery are but small, the Lumbares are great: an undeniable
argument, that the same office is common to both sorts, and that the exility of
those is supplied by the amplitude of these. And (3) the Thymus also seems to
be a Nutritious Glandule. For, in Infants, and other Animals new born (at which
time, they grow much, and so require the more abundant nourishment) the
magnitude of this Glandule does exceed that of any other in the whole body:
but, in old men (who daily go down the hill of life, and so have less need of
nourishment in such abundance) it dwindle's away to a smallness many times
scarce discernable. Again, this Glandule has no Excretory vessel, nor (like
other greater Reducing Glandules) any hollowness within; and therefore, we may
well list it in the number of Nutritious Glandules. Add also, that it is white,
soft, and very sweet, and in substance resembling the Glandules of the Paps: so
that in probability, as the paps serve to prepare nourishment for the infant,
ab extra; the Thymus supplieth him with nourishment, ab intra; receiving the
same, perhaps our of the Ductus Lacteus in the Thorax, which in its approach to
the Thymus, is usually divided into two streams or rivulets. And these are the
reasons, upon which we conclude, that the Nerves take in some of the Succus
Nutritious, out of each of these Glandules mentioned, whose use seems to be, to
separate the same from the less Alimentary parts of the Chyle.

Second thing enquired, What is the Principium Dispensationis of the same; viz.
the Brain and Spinal Morrow.
viz. what is the Prineipium Dispensationis, whence the Succus Nutritious is
immediately immitted into the Nervs, which convey it to the parts requiring
nourishment? We say, that the Brain and Spinal Marrow seem to have the best
title to that office, of all other parts, in respect that all the Nervs
desuming their original from, and having their extremities or roots immediately
fastened unto either the Brain, or Spinal Marrow, the Nutritive juice may
commodiously and easily from thence dissill down upon all parts of the body;
according to their particular conditions and necessities.

Concerning the Third; What are the Vessels importing the Nutritive juice into
the Brain and Spinal Marrow; viz. the Nerves, and particularly those of the
sixth Conjugation of the brain.
viz. By what vessels We say, By the Nerves, and particularly those of the
sixth Conjugation: For, this pair of Nerves, though they appear less than all
others, at their first rising from the Brain; do yet hold a commerce with all
other nerves of the whole body, and are immediately derived to more parts, than
any other pair or Conjugation, which is the reason why Anatomists called them,
the Wandering or Dispersed pair. And the Commerce they maintain with so vast a
multitude of other nerves, is founded on a threefold relation or intercourse,
viz. Complication, Consociation, and Inoculation: all which are largely
described by Fallopius, and after him by our excellent Dr. Glisson. in
observat. Anatomic. de Anatom. Hepatis. p. 436.
Now, if we seriously consider the scope or design of Nature, in all those
laborious and curious Connexions of Nerves, we shall find none, wherein our
reason may with so much satisfaction acquiesce as in this, that they conduce to
the commodious reception of the Nutritive juice and transportation of it to the
principle of its Dispensation. For it seems, the Nutritive juice is first
imbibed by the small branches of the Nerves of the sixth Conjugation; and
those, though very many, being yet too few for the transportation of so large a
quantity of that rich Nectar, as is required to the nourishment of the whole
body, Nature has conjoined with them a vast number of other Nerves, as
Auxiliaries in that great work. So that it is not dissentaneous to reason, to
conceive, that by these Nerves and their Coadjutors, the Succus Nutritious is
carried to the brain and Spinal Marrow, thence to be afterward derived to all
parts for their sustenance.

Fourth, What is the Motion of the same in the Nervs; viz. not continual, nor
vehement: but by intervalls, and slow and gentle; to the brain, in sleep, and
from it to the members, after sleep.
viz. the Motion of the Succus Nutritious in the Nerves; though it be a problem
of great obscurity, yet does the light, let in at the postern gate of
Conjecture discover thus much, that it is not continual (as that of the blood
in the Arteries and veins) but by intervals; nor violent, but slow and gentle;
as the defect of any swelling on either side of a Nerve bound about, in a
living creature, does sufficiently manifest. Nor is it unreasonable to
conceive, that in a short time after each meal, immediately upon the
distribution of the Chyle through the Venae Lacteae, the Succus Nutritious is
imbibed by the Nerves of the sixth Conjugation, and by them carried to the
brain and Spinal Marrow. Which perhaps, is the reason, why always, within an
hour or two after meat, we perceive a certain dullness in our heads, together
with an indisposition to motion, and a propensity to sleep, according to that
proverb, When the belly is full, the bones would be at rest: and soon after,
all those vanish again, and we perceive our selves more light, strong, and
active than before our refection; because then the nourishment begins to be
diffused from the principle of Dispensation, of outward into the limbs and
other parts of the body. And with this opinion agrees that observation of
Bartholinus that the Lympheducts are more plainly discernable about five or six
hours after meat, than at other times; as being at that time more filled with
the superfluities of the Succus Nutritious. Nor is it improbable, that the Brain
and Spinal Marrow are chiefly nourished in sleep, and that then the Nutritive
Liquor is usually carried to them, relaxing them with its sweet and mild
vapors, and so both inducing and prolonging sleep. From whence perhaps it
comes, that after long sleeps, we perceive our brains to be oppressed and
beclouded with vapors, our senses dull, and the motive-faculty enervated.
Besides, in sleep all motions of humors flowing to the patts by the Nerves,
seem to be suspended; and yet the Circulation of the blood is certainly at that
time more free and quick, than while we wake: So that It cannot be thought the
cause of that cessation, but the Nerves only, which intermit their office of
distributing the Succus Nutritious, during sleep. And all this will appear more
reasonable, if we reflect upon the flux of humors in the Nerves immediately
after sleep. For, then the Brain and Spinal Marrow re-contract themselves, and
become more tense; so that the Nutritive liquor is from thence transmitted,
partly to the members to be nourished, and partly to the Glandules; as well
such as serve for the excretion of its absolute Excrement, as those that serve
for the reduction of its relative, viz. its acrimonious parts, that are
returned into the blood, for the reason formerly mentioned.

Last, And what the Causes of that Motion, viz. the motions of the Diaphragme,
of the Brain, and of the Nerves themselves.
viz. the Causes of this Motion of the Succus Nutritious; we may be allowed to
conceive (at least, until Time shall have dispelled that Obscurity, which yet
surrounds this abstruse Theoreme, and the industry of some more dextrous
Anatomist pierced deeper into the mystery of the Nerves; a subject not much
less inscrutable, than the Nature of the Soul it self, which uses them as her
principal instruments: we hope, we may have the liberty to conceive) that the
Succus Nutritious is not imported to the brain and Spinal Marrow, nor exported
from thence to the members, by any Attraction similary or Elective, against
which we have formerly alleged convincing arguments, unnecessary to be here
repeated: but, as the blood, and indeed all other humors of the body are moved,
by mere Impulsion, or Protrusion, the immediate Cause of all motions in Nature.
And the Agents, in this case impelling, we conceive to be the motions of the
Diaphragme, of the Brain, and of the Nerves themselves.

For since the Depression of the Diaphragme, is generally admitted to conduce
to the distribution of the Chyle out of the stomach, guts, Venae Lacteae,
common Receptacle, and Ductus Chyliferi, successively into the subclavian Vein:
by alternately compressing all those parts, and so compelling the Liquor
contained in them, to flow upward; and indeed to all other Natural motions; why
may not the same be thought sufficient also to the Expulsion of the Nutritive
juice, both out of the Praeparing Glandules, into the Nerves of the Sixth
conjugation and their Auxiliaries, and out of them into the brain and Spinal
Marrow; their position being such, as renders them no less subject to
compression, by the descending Diaphragme, than the Venae Lacteae, common
Receptacle, and other Chyliferous parts are?

If this seem difficult, we may have recourse to the reason of the ascension of
a liquor from the bottom through all parts of a sponge, cloth, or other
filamentous substance (as is experimented in the percolation of Aqua Calcis,
made by a long piece of woollen cloth, whose one end is dipped in the water, and
the other hung over the brim of the vessel containing it) which we have
professedly explained in the 356 page of our Physiology; and seems to be the
same with the reason of the ascension of the nutritive juice of all plants from
the roots to the top of the branches.

And as for the Motion of the Brain; though it may seem to be no other, but
what is impressed upon the brain, by the Pulsation of the Arteries (ascending
from the Plexus Arteriosus mirabilis chiefly to the Dura Matter, and copiously
disseminating themselves upon it); yet, since it is credible, that the
Pulsation of the arteries does promote the flux of the liquor in the Nerves, in
other parts, especially such, where Nerves are either contiguous, or near
enough to Arteries, to participate of their impulse: why may not the motion of
the Brain also, to which the Nerves are continued, serve to ex-press the liquor
out of them, toward the parts wherein they are terminated? Besides, it is most
certain that immediately after sleep, the whole Brain, together with the
conjoined network of its Nerves, becomes more tense and firm, than in sleep,
which seems to render it moist and lax: and since that Tension cannot but in a
manner ex-press, or squeez forth, the liquor contained in the original of the
Nerves, it is reasonable to conceive, that the motion of the Succus Nutritious
from the brain to the parts, is to be imputed thereunto; especially it being by
us observed, that the diffusion of the nourishment is chiefly soon after we
awake and rise from sleep.

And lastly, as for the Motion of the Nerves themselves; nothing is more
manifest, than that, while the Nerves and Muscles are distended in Voluntary
motion, the juice contained in the Nerves must be impelled or ex-pressed to the
parts, into which they are inserted; the extension of any nervous body,
necessitating the flux of any liquor contained betwixt its filaments, from one
extreme to the other.

But, this we deliver, not as doctrine, but mere Conjecture. Nor should we have
adventured to deliver it, but that we hope, that as the singular obscurity of
the Argument may incite some other more able brain to labor in the same
scrutiny; so it may excuse us, if we have not been so happy, as to light upon
the knowledge of the true Causes, we sought after; there being among Candid
Spirits, not only pardon, but even commendation, due to ingenious Errors;
especially in things of Difficulty, and where the discovery of Truth is to be
hoped rather from Time and multiplied Observations, than from the single
felicity of Wit.

OF VOLUNTARY MOTION, Exercitation the Eleventh.
Of Voluntary Motion, or the Use of the Muscles.
one Use of the Nerves, Article
viz. the conveying of the nourishment to all parts requiring it; The
Inference, and Method of this discourse.
we now transfer our contemplation to the other, viz. the transmission of the
Animal Spirits from the Brain the principal throne of the Soul, where she
judges of the good or evil of objects; and from whence she dispenses her
commands) to the Muscles, the immediate and proper instruments of Motion
Voluntary: and here, for the more perspicuity, we shall take the liberty of
permitting our Curiosity to exspatiate it self a while in that delightful and
ample field, the admirable Art of Nature shown in the Structure of those
organs, in their Variety, and in the Reason of their Motions.

Requisites to Voluntary motion.
are (1) the object communicated by the sense to the judicatory Faculty, or
Soul; (2) the Soul perceiving that object, judging it to be good or evil, and
accordingly pursuing, or avoiding it; (3) the Instrumentum Mediatum, by which
the Soul impresseth a motive-Faculty upon the Muscles, and immediately acts,
toward the attainment of her end; and (4) the Instrumentum Immediatum, by which
immediately the motion intended is executed or effected.

Concerning the Exciting Cause, That the Animal Spirits are the Mediate
Instruments, by which the Soul moves the Muscles; argued from
or object; Instrumentum Mediatum, or that by which the Soul does cause the
Muscles to move either the whole body, or some member of it, in order to her
embracing, or avoiding the object; many, especially of late years, have seemed
very much to doubt. To satisfy them, therefore, in this particular; we (with
all the Ancients) conceive, that the Animal Spirits sent from the brain, by the
Nerves, into the Muscles, are the Immediate instrument of the Soul, whereby she
does impress an actual motion upon the Muscles: and to evince the probability
of this opinion, we offer these few, yet (in our judgment) weighty Reasons.

(1) Voluntary Motion being nothing, the Mutation of Figure both in the Muscle
and Member moved:
but it is necessary, the member moved should measure the determinate space
betwixt the Terminus a quo, and the terminus ad quem; and consequently, that
the proportion of the member moved, be answerable to the proportion of that
intermediate space: now from that necessary proportion, there arises a change
of Figure, as well in the member moved, as in the Muscle moving (as we shall
ere long demonstrate by Principles Mathematical, in explanation and
confirmation of the doctrine of our Master Galen, in 1. de motu Musculor. cap.
8.) but that Mutation of Figure in the external instrument, cannot arise
immediately from the Soul it self: which being Immaterial, can of her self
produce no such effect: and therefore it must arise from something more
proportionate to the immediate energy of the Soul, than either the grossness of
the member, or muscles ordained to move it, will admit them to be; which
Something can be no other, than the Animal Spirits, whose subtility makes them
to approach nearer to the nature of the Soul, and whose sudden influx through
the Nerves, into the body of the Muscle, causes a swelling or distention, and
so a contraction thereof, and consequently a change of Figure in the member.

the Quickness of voluntary motion.
as well to the nature of the Agent which is to use it, as to the effect to be
produced by the use of it; and that Voluntary Motion is performed as it were in
an instant and by a most swift and speedy Impulse from the soul; it follows,
that betwixt the incorporeal Agent, the soul, and those corporeal instruments,
the Muscles, there must be some Intermediate instrument, such as is capable of
being so transmitted from the Brain, into the Muscles, with the greatest
velocity imaginable, and of setting them instantly a-work, according to the
determination and direction of the soul. Now, no part of an Animal can be
thought capable of such easy and expedite Mobility, but the spirits, which
flow through the body in less than the twinkling of an eye: and therefore, we
conclude, that They are the Immediate instrument of the soul, in voluntary
motion; according to the assertion of Galen (in 4. de locis affect cap. 6.) in
these words; Est in cerebri ventriculis Spiritus, Animae primum instrumentum,
quo and sensum and motum per universas corporis parts Anima transmittit, etc.

(3) As the Power or Faculty of Seeing does the conquest of the acting Muscle,
over its Antagonist.
nor that of Hearing, in the Ear, etc; but is imparted to the organs of sight,
and hearing, from the soul, by the mediation of Nervs and Spirits: so likewise
is not the Virtue Motive inhaerent in the Muscles, but communicated to them
upon occasion, from the same soul, and seems to consist wholly in the quick
afflux of spirits, as that by which alone they are moved. Which Galen also does
not obscurely intimate (in 1. de mot. Musculor. cap. 8.) where he says,
Aequipollens musculorum motus fit, quando neuter tonum Animalem habet
auxiliarm; non aequipollens vero, cum alter solus dominatur: quare necessum
est, ut vincat contractio istius musculi, qui ab Animali Facultare adjuvatur.
For, what can be understood by this Tonus Animalis, or Facultas Animalis,
unless it be the distention of the conquering muscle by Animal spirits, sent
from the brain, at the pleasure of the Soul?

the swelling of each Muscle, when it moves.
that a muscle is never moved, but it becomes more hard and swelling in the
middle, than before (as is most evident in both the Masseter and Temporal
Muscles, when we chew our meat) unless because it is then filled and distended
with a greater gale of spirits, issued out of the storehouse of the Brain?
For, it seems more reasonable, that this swelling in the body of the Muscle is
the Cause of its Contraction; than, on the contrary, that the Contraction
should be the cause of the Swelling, as those contend who would have the motion
to be performed without the afflux of spirits.

the privation of motion in a Muscle, whose Nerve is cut off.
does for ever become incapable of motion; and this, certainly, for no other
reason, but because the intercourse of the spirits betwixt the brain and that
particular Muscle is wholly destroyed. So that we may well conclude, that the
Soul cannot cause voluntary motion, but by the distribution of Animal spirits,
through the Nervs, into the Muscles.

The necessity of Animal spirits, as the Immediate Instrument of the soul, thus
appearing; we are next to speculate the Conditions requisite in the Immediate
Instrument of the Motion it self: that so we may come to a clear understanding
both of the structure and diversity of the Muscles, and at length of the reason
of their moving the members, the thing at which our Scrutiny is chiefly
levelled.

As for the requisite Conditions, therefore, of this last Instrument, we
observe,

(1) That in an organ of voluntary Motion why a Muscle is composed for the
most part of Flesh.
as may render it fit to receive the Animal spirits, at the pleasure and
command of the soul. Which makes it manifest, that a hard, inflexible, and bony
substance is most incompetent to an instrument of motion; for which reason,
perhaps, Galen adventured to affirm, that any part made hard and stiff by a
thick Cicatrice, becomes unfit for motion: and that it must be such a part, as
being soft, rare, spongy, and flexible, and distinguished with multitudes of
Fibers, may most easily and readily admit the Gale of spirits flowing into its
substance, and be by them filled or distended. Which is the reason, why the
substance of the Muscles is for the most part Fleshy; than which no part, is
more soft, rare, flexible, and distendible: as Galen has observed (in 1. de
usu part. cap. 13.)

(2) Lest the spirits might flow into this of a Nerve.
indeterminately or at random and scatteringly: there ought to be such
peculiar vessels or Conduits, which being continued from the brain or spinal
marrow, quite home to the Flesh, into which they are inserted, may both carry
the spirits thither, and preserve them from straying or dispersing by the way;
and by which the Soul, or Regulating Faculty, principally residing in the
brain, the original of the Nervs, may rule the members, as a Coachman rules his
horses by the rains of his bridles; that we may use the same comparison with
Galen, (1. de mot. musculor. cap. 1.). Now, the Nervs being the only parts of
the whole body thus qualified, Nature most wisely inserted one, or more of
them, into each Muscle. So that from this constitution of the Nervs, it
appears, that they make the second Essential part of a Muscle. Nay, according
to strict truth, we may adventure to say, that the Flesh and Nerve are the
principal ingredients required to complete the essence of a Muscle: because
there are some Muscles (viz. those of the Temples, of the Forehead, of the
Eyes, of the Bladder, of the Fundament, etc.) in whose bodies are neither
Tendons, nor Ligaments to be found, but only Nervs, and Flesh distinguished
with various Fibers.

Of a Ligament.
by reason of their Gravity, there is a greater resistance to motion, than the
Musculous Flesh (in respect of its softness and tenderness) is able to
overcome; therefore ought there to be an addition of some stronger and tougher
substance, which being connected or united to the Flesh of the Muscle, may both
corroborate the same, and firmly conjoyn it to the bones, so as to enable it to
move the ponderous member, to whose bones it is fastened. Now, this Nature
foresaw, when she furnished some Muscles with Ligaments, especially such as
were ordained to bear great stress, in moving the greater and more weighty
members. Which Galen most elegantly expresses thus; Ut enim ossa, quae
dearticulantur, exact simul ligarentur ac continerentur, ne facile in motibus
vehementioribus a sese abrumperentur; Ligamentum, quoad maxim potuit, durum,
atque ab injuriis remotissimum efficere oportuit: ut autem ossibus a Musculis
tractis prompte obsequeretur, molle rursus esse oportuit, atque ob id ipsum
imbecillum. Atqui, forte quidem imbecillo, ac durum molli est contrarium.
Quaenam igitur fuerit in his Naturae solertia, quae corpus invenit, quod
commoditatem utramque haberet, idemque ab injuriis tutum esset; ex ipsad
Anatome discas, licet, etc. 12. de usu part. cap. 2.

(4) Besides the connection of the Musculous Of a Tendon:
by the mediation of a Ligament, there must be also something to render it
prompt, easy and agile in its motion, so as to answer the celerity of the
influx of the Spirits, and to fulfill the command of the Soul, as it were in an
instant. Which Nature reflecting upon, superadded also a Tendon, or Chord,
which in respect both of its subtility, and of its tough and strong Contexture,
or substance, and also of its connection to the joint, does make the motion more
facile and quick, than otherwise it could possibly be; as appears in the
Muscles of the Hands and Feet, etc.

(5) That these parts named, viz. the of a Membrane investing it:
Nerve, Ligament and Tendon, might no be endangered by lying uncovered or
confused; therefore has Nature clothed the whole Muscle with a proper
Membrane or Coat: which has these two further Uses, that it causes the
Muscles that are contiguous, to slip up and down easily and without
enterfearing each other, and preserves the spirits immitted into the body of
the muscle moved, from passing quite through, or dispersing themselves, which
they are apt to do, both in respect of their subtility, and of the force of
their impulse.

and of Arteries and veins.
since this organ of voluntary Motion is to be continually supplied with life,
as being pars corporis vivens; therefore is it provided of Arteries and veins:
those to bring in the vital blood, by whose irradiation all parts of the muscle
are made participant of life; and these, to return the blood to the Heart,
therein to receive a new impression of life.

That a Muscle is the Immediate Organ of Motion Voluntary.
seeing that in the whole body of an Animal, there is no other part that has
any the least title to this Description; it is undeniable, that a Muscle is the
adaequate or proper and immediate instrument of Motion voluntary: and may
conveniently be defined to be, A part of an Animal, endowed with life, composed
of a Nerve and Flesh, and frequently also of a Ligament and Tendon convered
with a membrane, and so framed to be the proxime organ of voluntary Motion. And
thus much of the Structure of the Muscles.

As for the next Considerable, the Differences of the Muscles; they are many,
as being desumed from their substance, quantity, figure, situation, original,
insertion, Fibers, parts, Use and Action.

In respect of their Substance, some Muscles Flesh, Differences of Muscles, in
respect of their substance.
as the Sphincters, and the Muscles of the Tongue: others are mostly Nervous
and Membranous, as the Fascia la^a abducing the leg, etc.

In respect of Quantity, Quantity;
which comprehends the 3 dimensions of Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity.
Some are Long, as the Musculus rectus of the Abdomen, the Thylers Muscle in the
thigh: and others short, as the Musculi Pyramidales in the bottom of the
Abdomen. Some are Broad, as the Oblique and Transverse Muscles of the Abdomen,
the Latissimus dorsi, brachium deprimens, etc: others Narrow, as the Muscles of
the Fingers and Toes, etc. Some Thick, as the two Vasti, or Huge Muscles in the
thigh: others Thin and slender, as the Musculus Gracilis bending the leg, etc.

In respect of Figure, Figure;
some are Triangular, some Square, some Pentagonal, some Pyramidal, some Round,
some Oblong, and others of other shapes; as the Muscles Deltoides, Rhomboides,
Scalenus, Trapezius, etc.

In relation to their Situation, Situation;
some are Right, some Oblique, some Transverse (understand it in respect of
their Fibers) some Above, some Below, some on the right side, some on the left,
some before, and some behind. Where we may note in the general, that oblique
muscles serve to oblique motions, Right to exact Flexion, or Extension; and
such as are seated within, conduce to Flexion; and such as are posited without,
to Extention.

In respect of their Original; Origination;
some arise from Bones, and that either from the Heads of them; as most of the
greater Muscles; or a little below, or from the Glene, some sinus or small
hollowness in the bone: some only from one single bone, some from two or three:
some from Cartilages or Gristles, as the Muscles proper to the Larynx: some
from the Membrane enshrouding the Tendons, as the Musculi vermiculares: and
others from other parts, as the Sphincters of the Bladder, and Fundament.

Their Insertion considered; Insertion;
some are inserted into Bones, some into Cartilages, as the Muscles of the
Eyelids, and of the Larynx; others into a Membrane, as the Muscles moving the
Eyes; others into the skin, as those of the Lips: some arising from diverse
parts, are inserted only into one; and on the contrary, some arising only from
one part, are terminated in many.

In respect of their Parts Parts;
(by which we must now understand not only such, whereunto as chief ones every
Muscle is divided, but those also upon which it is seated); there are various
differences. The parts into which each Muscle is commonly divided, are the
Head, or Beginning; the Belly, or Middle; and the Tail, or Tendon. Most Muscles
have but one Head; yet some have two, others three: whence they are called
Bicipites, and Tricipites. Most have but one Belly, yet some are
double-bellied, as the Muscle shutting the lower jaw, of the Bone Hyois, whence
they are named Digastrici. The Tendons of some are broad and membranous; of
others, round; of others, short; of others, long; of some, perforated; of
others, entire; of some, single; of others, multiplied. Sometimes you shall
find many Muscles ending in one and the same Tendon; as, in the Leg, the
Gemelli or Twin-Muscles, and the Solaris, are united into one Chord. Lastly,
from the parts upon which they are seated, they sometimes borrow their names;
as the Crotaphitae, or Temple-Muscles; the Rachitae, or Spinati of the back;
the Iliaci, etc.

According to the variety of their particular Actions, and Actions.
the Muscles admit of a triple Difference. Whereof the First is, that some are
Congeneres, or Confederates, which both conspire to one and the same motion; as
when two are Flexors, two Extensors; one possessing the right, the other the
left side of the member: and others Antagonists, which have motions contrary to
those of others; there being scarce any one Muscle, which has not its
Contrary, or Opponent; as to every Flexor is opposed a Tensor; to every
Elevator, a Depressor; to every Adductor, an Abductor; excepting only the two
Sphincters, and the Cremasters. The Confederates are generally equal in
magnitude, number, and strength: the Antagonists not, but different, according
to the weight of the part to be moved, and the vehemence of the motion. Thus,
the Muscles bowing the Head, are only Two; while there are Twelve to lift it
up; and those that shut the lower jaw bone with the upper, are many, but those
that open it, are only two; for the weight of heavy bodies does facilitate
their falling down. The Second is, that some Muscles move only Themselves, as
the two Sphincters: others somewhat else besides themselves. And the Last
respects the peculiar motions of particular Muscles; whence some are called
Benders, some Extensors; some Elevators, others D^pressors; some Adductors,
others Abductors; some Rotators, some Circumactors, some Masseters or Eaters,
some Cremasters or Hangers, some Sphincters or Constrictors, etc. And thus much
concerning the several Differences of the Muscles.

Reason and Manner of their Motion (an Argument, as singularly delightful,
That the Reason of the motion of the Muscles, cannot be explained, without
having recourse to Mathematical principles.
so singularly difficult) forasmuch as the Locomotion of the whole body, or any
one member of it, being considered per se, merely as Motion, without reflecting
upon the end of it, seems to be an effect purely Mathematical, as well because
it is a Commensuration of the length of the space betwixt the Terminus a quo,
and ad quem, as because it is a resistance and overpowering of Gravity:
therefore shall we lay down some few Mathematical principles, of plain
concernment in the explication of it, such as without which our disquisition
into the nature of Voluntary Motion would be obscure and unsatisfactory.

Fundaments Geometrical. Principles Geometrical, of necessary importance toward
the understanding thereof.

Proposition, 1.
What are equal to the same, are equal also among themselves: and e contra.

Proposition, 2.
All right lines drawn from the Center to the Circumference, are equal.

Proposition, 3.
Two right lines whatsoever, mutually cutting each other, make, at the vertex,
Angles equal among themselves.

Proposition, 4.
The squares of equal lines, are equal.

Proposition. 5.
A right line, falling upon two right lines aequidistant, or parallels, makes
equal Angles.

Proposition, 6.
In Triangles, where the Angles are equal, the sides also are equal and

proposition, 7.
In a Triangle, where any one Angle is greater; there the side subtending that
Angle, is also greater.

proposition, 8.
In every Parallelogram, the Complements of those Parallelograms, that are
about the Diameter, are equal among themselves.

Demonstration.


Suppose A B C D the Parallelogram; A D, the Diameter or Dimetient; and the
supplements H B, and H C. We say, the supplement H B. is equal to the
Supplement H C. because the Parallelogram has for its Diameter A D: and
therefore the Triangle A B D. is equal to the Triangle A. C D. Again, because
AEGH. has its diameter A H. therefore the Triangle A G H. is equal to the
Triangle A E H. By the same it is demonstrated, that the Triangle H F D. is
equal to the Triangle H I D. Now, since the Triangle A G H. is equal to I D;
and E H G. equal to F D I: it follows, that the supplement H B. is equal to H
C. Which was to be demonstrated.

proposition, 9.
If a straight Line be divided into parts equal and unequal; the Parallelogram,
that is contained in the unequal segments of the whole Line given, together
with the square of that which is between the segments, will be equal to the
square described by the half Line.



Demonstration.


Let the right line be A B, divided into equal parts, at the point C; and into
unequal, at the point E. Let from the point A, to the proportion of the equal
segment, be made a square A C G H; and from the point E, on the unequal
segment, be drawn a parallel line E F; and from the point A, the Diameter or
Dimetient A H; and a parallelogram E F B D. We say, the Parallelogram E D. with
the square F H. is equal to the square A H: which is proved from the
Antecedents.

proposition, 10.
To make a Square equal to a Parallelogram given.

Let the Parallelogram be A B C D. To which to find a square equal, draw a line
from C to E, to the proportion of G D; and divide A E into equal parts into the
point F. from whence make a circle A G E; and continue the line C D to the
point H. We say, the Line C H. is the root of the square I K C H. which is in
equal proportion to the Parallelogram A B C D.

Demonstration.


Because the Line AE is divided into equal parts at the point F. and into
unequal parts, at the point C; and the Parallelogram contained in the unequal
segments, together with the square FC, is equal to the square FH. or FE. the
equal segment, according to the ninth proposition precedent: it follows, that
the Parallelogram ABCD. is equal to the square IKHC. according to the 47.
proposition. 1. lib. of Euclid. Which was intended.

Fundaments Architectonical, out of Vitruvius, Principles Architectonical, of
the same Concernment.
lib. 10. cap. 8.

Proposition.
1. In the Center all Gravity cease; so that therein nothing is either Heavy
or Light.

2. The power of all Motion is varied, according to the ration of the Center to
the Circumference.

3. By how much the more remote or elonged from the Center, any thing is; by so
much the swifter is it moved.

4. By how much greater the Circumference of the Circle, so much greater the
Diameter, and so much swifter the Motion.

Demonstration.


Let the Center be E. from which under the Diameter E F. let the weight be
placed at F. We say, this weight at F. does not rest there, but moves to its
Center, toward C. Again, if the same weight be elonged, or removed to A; then
by reason of its greater distance from E, and of the greater Circle; it will be
moved toward its Center C, with the greater velocity accordingly.

5. Bodies equal, and under the same Diameter* equally distant from the Center;
do cut a perpendicular Line at right Angles.

Demonstration.
In the former Scheme, let one body be at B, and another at A. upon the
Diameter of the Circle, whose Center is E. and neither of them shall move,
because their Gravity is equal, in that proportion of the Diameter, and so
hasten to the Center C. with equal swiftness; but, because they make equal
Angles with the perpendicular DE.

6. If to one of two equal bodies, placed under the same Diameter, and equally
distant from the Center, any weight be superadded; that, whose weight is
increased, shall move more strongly, and make an acute Angle with the
perpendicular, or wholly obtain the place of the Center: as in the last Scheme,
the weight A is increased to the magnitude G; and therefore it must move the
more strongly; as is evidently concluded.

And let these suffice for the Fundamentals.

To come to their Concernment in the Motion of the Muscles, we observe, that
every Muscle has a twofold Motion, viz. one Natural, wherein the Fibers of the
muscle spontaneously recontract themselves, after they have been extended, or
restore themselves to their native That every Muscle has a Twofold
Contraction, viz. Natural and Animal.
by Philosopher named, the motion of Restitution, common to all Tensile bodies:
and this is always from the end, toward the beginning of the Muscle,
according to the position of its Fibers: another, Animal; wherein the same
Fibers are further Contracted, by the forcible and copious influx of Animal
spirits, at the command of the soul, in order to the performance of some action
intended.

That the Natural Contraction of a Muscle, That the Natural Contraction is not
the cause of Voluntary Motion; but only the Animal.
though we allow every muscle to be made upon the stretch, i.e. in an extended
position, is manifest from hence, that betwixt each Muscle and its Antagonist,
there is an equal power of naturally-moving themselves toward their originals;
so that betwixt two Contrary forces, the one drawing one way, the other the
clean contrary, the member must be held immovable; as appears in the 5th.
proposit. Architectonical. Necessary it is, therefore, to voluntary Motion,
that one Muscle overpower the other, not by reason of its spontaneous or
Natural Contraction, but of its impressed or Animal; which depends upon the
supply of spirits transmitted from the brain, by the Nerves into the Fibers of
the acting muscle, and so-distending. them, as to cause the whole Muscle to
shorten or contract it self. And, that the power of Antagonists is, as we
affirm, naturally equal; may be concluded from hence, that if one Muscle be
cut off, its Antagonist instantly draws the member to its side, which before
was held in the middle, and as it were aequilibrated betwixt them.

Secondly, we observe; that in all Motion there are two Terms to be
acknowledged, That in Motion, are Two Terms, one Fixed, the other Moveable; the
last of which is sometimes more, sometimes less remote from the former,
according to greater or less resistance of Gravity in the member to be moved,
and vehemence of the Motion.
the one is the point of Rest, or the Fundament, in which the muscle is firmed
or fastened, because all motion is super aliquo Quiescente: the other is in
part Mobili, or insertion of the muscle, from whence the Muscle, by
contraction, draws the member toward it self; and this is sometimes less,
sometimes more remote from the Center, or point of rest, according to the less
or greater resistance of Gravity in the member to be moved, and according to
the less or greater vehemence required to the motion. Which Nature (whose Art
is not more admirable in any thing, than in her proportioning the length of the
insertion of each muscle, from the Hypomochlion or point of Rest, to the
Gravity of the member to be moved) respecting; most ingeniously contrived a way
to compensate the slender strength of diverse muscles, by inserting them at
great distance from the Center of their motion, or that point, about which the
member is to be moved. For, since (according to the 1. proposit.
Architectonical) there is no motion in the Center; we may easily understand,
why in many muscles, ordained for strong motions, the Terminus stabilis, or
original, is more remote from the Terminus Mobilis, or insertion, than in
others framed for motions less strong; viz. that by even a small force, the
muscle (which, considered in its proper bulk, or in any other position, would
be insufficient to the effect designed) might elevate a great weight, as we see
in the muscles of the Hand, Arm, Thighs, and other parts. For this reason also
is it, that in some bones we have certain prominences, or Buttings forth in the
end, called Epiphyses, and Apophyses, to which the muscles are fastened. The
truth of all which is evinced by the 2d and 3d proposit. Architectonical.

These things being thus firmly established, No Motion without change of Figure.
that no motion can be made, without changing the Figure of the muscle. For,
since equal Angles subtend equal sides, by the 6th Geometrical Proposition: it
follows necessarily, that in all motion, the Figure of the member moved, is
changed.

And, because the change of Figure does depend Which is Threefold, ^espective
to the difference of Angles.
therefore must we admit a threefold Figure, as there are three sorts of
Angles, viz. (1) a right, in which neither of the two opposite muscles acts;
(2) an obtuse, which being greater than a right, is consequently subtended by a
greater side; and (3) an acute, which being less* requires a less subtending
line.

Now, forasmuch as in the Middle Figure, All motion is made in one of the Two
Extreme Figures; and how, demonstrated.
because then both the opposing Muscles are equally extended: we are to
demonstrate, how it is effected in both the Extremes. And this, certainly, is
done, when one of the acting Muscles is filled or distended by the Animal
influx, more than its Antagonist, whereupon the Figure of the Conquering muscle
is changed; and the Angle of Articulation is made more Acute, or less, by that
Contraction; and that segment, detracted from the line, is in proportion to the
space comprehended. For Example.

Demonstration.


Imagine the Brachium, or upper half of the Arm, from the shoulder to the
elbow, to be G A; and the Cubit, or lower half from the elbow to the hand, to
be A B: the Muscle bending the Arm, to be C F: and its Antagonist extending
it, to be C G: and the object to be apprehended by the hand, D. Now, we say,
while those two opposite Muscles G F. and C G. are equally contracted, the
Appetite must fail of being satisfied, i.e. the hand cannot be brought to lay
hold on the object desired; because the Figure or Angle of Articulation remains
invariable. But, that the hand may be raised to the object, it is necessary,
that Angle should be made more Acute, by contraction of the Muscle C F. in
proportion to the motion of the line B D: and because that Angle is less,
therefore is the line subtending it also less, or shorter; according to the 5th
and 6th proposit. Geometrical. And, since the Line E F. is in proportion to the
Line D B: it follows that so much is to be detracted from the length of the
Muscle: yet, we are not to suppose, that this detracted portion of the Muscle
is to be wholly cast away; in regard, then it would be incapable of the like or
any other motion ever after: but, that being plumpt up or filled with a gust of
spirits, it is incurvated, or made Unequal by that distension; and that line,
which before was straight, is now changed into an Arch, and consequently made
shorter.

Moreover, since there are 3 Dimensions, That a Muscle, in contraction, is
increased in Latitude and Profundity, proportionately to its diminution in
Longitude; demonstrated.
Latitude, and Profundity; and that it is not any one, but all of these, that
determine the Figure of a Muscle: it follows, that all Muscles, while they are
contracted, are as much increased in Thickness and Latitude, as they are
diminished in Longitude. Which may be naturally inferred from the importance of
the 5. 7. 8. 9. and 10. propositious Geometrical; where a square is found
equalto a Parallelogram.

Demonstration.


Let the Parallelogram be A B C D. representing the Muscle Biceps, of the Arm,
as it is extended; and a Square equal thereunto, B E G F, representing the
same Muscle, as it is contracted. We say, that the Muscle, in its second
Figure, or Contraction, has lost nothing of its bulk, that it had in the first
Figure, or Extension: but, because the Square of the muscle, B E G F. is equal
to the Parallelogramme, A B C D; therefore it follows, that the superfice of
the muscle is the same, and that the part G D. changed in its Latitude, is in
proportion to the Line A D. which determin's the Local motion.

The Necessity of Antagonist-Muscles.
why each Muscle generally has its Antagonist; there being contrary motions to
be performed successively by every member, and it being impossible, one and the
same Instrument should suffice to both. Now of these Antagonists one does bend
the member, by Contracting it self; and the other by its contraction does
extend it: and both extend each other successively: that which is contracted,
does always act, and that which is extended, does not act, but suffer, and is
transferred with the part moved.

But here we are to except some Muscles, How Circular Muscles are Contracted.
as to have no need of Antagonists; as all Circular muscles, whose motion is
easily understood from the mathematical principles premised. For, since a
Circular muscle has circular Fibers, and that all contraction is made secundum
continuitatem lineae; it follows, that such muscles shut the part to which
they are affixed, by contracting themselves toward their Center; as may be
observed in the Sphincters of the Bladder and Fundament, and in the Round
muscle of the Eyelids.

Only it may be enquired, Why those Sphincters have no Antagonists, Why the
Sphincters have no Antagonists.
as the Clausor Palpebrarum seems to have, the Elevator opening the eyelids,
as the Clausor shuts them? Whereof the Reason certainly is this, that both the
Bladder and Fundament are not opened by muscles, but by the quantity of
Excrements contained in them, which being pressed or detruded downward by the
Diaphragme and muscles of the Abdomen, force open the Sphincters, by extending
their Fibers from the Center to the Circumference; so that to speak strictly,
the excretion of the Urine, and of the Excrements of the belly, are not actions
immediately voluntary, as the opening of the Eyelids is.

Conclusion.
in general, and concerning the admirable Geometry observed by Nature in the
Fabrique of them.

Should we extend our discourse, to the accommodation of the Figure and motion
of each particular muscle in the whole body, to the Geometrical, and
Architectonical principles premised: as we should abuse your Patience, so
should we disparage your Capacity of making use of the same Clue for your
guidance through the whole Labyrinth of Voluntary Motion, that we have put into
your hands for your more easily entering into it. We shall conclude, therefore,
with this due acknowledgment; that the Omniscient Creator has made all things,
as in the Greater World, so also in the Lesser, Man, in Number, Weight, and
Measure.

irreconcilable incongruities: ibid. 3. There are sundry parts, into whose
substance blood is not adm^tted. 52 4. Fat men generally have the least blood,
and lean the most. 53 5. Men perishing by Famine, have their arteries and veins
full of blood. 54 6. The blood continues red and florid, in the habit of the

conspire with the Diaphragme, in respiration, violent and arbitrary. 137 11.
The Final Cause of Respiration, not the Refrigeration of the Heart, or Vital
Flame; but, the subtiliation of the blood, which by the admistion of Aer, is
made the more convenient fuel of the vital Lamp, and matter of the spirits.
138 12. The same exemplified in the accension of flame in wood, by Aer blown
out of Bellows: and 139 13. inferred from the structure of the Lungs. 140 14.
The Use of Expiration. 141 15. A Problem, of the respiration of the Foetus in
the mother's womb. 142 16. The motion of the Brain, not dependent upon
Respiration, but upon the Pulsarion of the Arteries. 145 17. The Secondary Uses
of Respiration. 147
Exercitation the Ninth. Of the Lympheducts.
Art. 1. The Lympheducts a new and excellent invention. 149 2. To whom the
honor of their discovery is to be ascribed. ibid. 3. Their Description. 150 4.
Differences. 151 5. Origination. ibid. 6. Insertion. ibid. 7. Situation and
Progress. 152 8. Liquor, deduced partly from the Arteries, and 153 9. pa^tly
f^^m the Nerves. 154 10. The Uses of that Liquor. 155
Exercitation the Tenth. Of the Distribution of the Nourishment through the
Nerves.
Art. 1. That the Nerves are vessels carrying the Nutritive juice to the
parts; argued 156 2. From the Atrophy or decay of Nutrition in parts affected
with the Palsy, and whose Nerves have been wounded. 157 3. From the beneficial
use of Cephalique Emplastres, in Consumptions from ^lcerated Lungs. ibid. 4.
From the Fatness of men endowed with large, open, and spongy Nerves. 158 5.
From the roscid Humor exstilling from wounds of the joy^ts and sinews. ibid.
6. From the Material principle of wenns and Scrophulous Tumors. 159 7. From the
Matter of the seed, and the manner of its p^eparation in the Testicles. ibid.
8. From the Glutinous matter issuing from broken Bones, and cementing them
together again. 162 9. From the Unequal Nutrition of some parts in the Rickets.
163 10. Three grand Difficulties troubling this opinion. 164 11. Solution of
the First, asserting the possibility of the flux of the Nutritive juice,
through the Nerves, notwithstanding no manifest Hollowness be discernable in
them. ibid. 12. Solution of the Second, yielding the Reason, why no swelling
arises in a Nerve, when bound with a ligature, in a living Animal. 168 13.
Solution of the Third, showing the Reason why the Nutritive juice is not found
in the Nerves of dead bodies dissected. 169 14. What is the Principium
Elaborationis of the Nutritive juice; viz. the Glandules of the Mesentery, of
the Loins, and the Thymus. ibid. 15. What the Principium Dispensationis; viz.
the Brain, and Spinal Marrow. 174 16. What the Vessels importing the same into
the Brain and spinal Marrow; viz. the Nerves, and particularly those of the
Sixth Conjugation of the Brain. 175 17. What the Motion of the same in the
Nerves; viz. not continual, nor vehement: but by intervalls, slow and gentle;
to the Brain, in sleep, and from it to the members, after sleep. 176 18. What
the Causes of that Motion, viz. the motions of the Diaphragme, of the Brain,
and of the Nerves themselves. 178
Exercitation the Eleventh. Of Voluntary Motion.
Art. 1. The Inference and Method of this Discourse. 182 2. Requisite to
Voluntary Motion: ibid. 3. That the Animal spirits are the Immediate
instruments, by which the soul moves the Muscles, argued from. 183 4. the
Mutation of Figure both in the Muscle and Member moved: ibid. 5. the Quickness
of voluntary Motion: 184 6. the Conquest of the acting Muscle, over its
Antagonist: 187 7. the swelling of each Muscle, when it moves: 188 8. and the
privation of motion in a Muscle, whose Nerve is cut off. ibid. 9. Why a Muscle
is composed for the most part of Flesh; 189 10. Of a Nerve; ibid. 11. Of a
Ligament; 190 12. Of a Tendon; 191 13. Of a Membrane investing it; 192 14. And
of Arteries and veins. ibid. 15. That a Muscle is the Immediate Instrument of
voluntary Motion. ibid. 16. Differences of Muscles in respect of their (1)
Substance, (2) Quantity, (3) Figure, (4) Situation, (5) Origination, (6)
Insertion, (7) Parts, and (8) Actions. 193 17. That the Reason of the Motion of
the Muscles, cannot be explained, without having recourse to Mathematical
Principles. 196 18. Principles Geometrical, of necessary importance to the
understanding thereof. 197 19. Principles Architectonical, of the same
Concernment. 201 20. That every Muscle has a twofold Contraction, viz. Natural
and Animal. 203 21. That the Natural Contraction is not the Cause of voluntary
Motion; but the Animal. ibid. 22. That in Motion are two Terms, the one Fixed,
the other Moveable, the last of which is more or less, removed from the Former,
according to the greater or less resistance of Gravity in the member to be
moved, and the vehemence of the Motion. 204 23. No Motion without Change of
Figure. 205 24. which is Threefold, respective to the difference of Angles.
ibid. 25. All Motion is made in one of the two Extreme Figures: and how,
demonstrated. ibid. 26. That a Muscle, in Contraction, is increased in Latitude
and Profundity, in proportion to its diminution in Longitude; demonstrated. 207
27. The Necessity of Antagonists Muscles. 208 28. How Circular Muscles are
Contracted. 209 29. Why the Sphincters have no Antagonists, ibid. 30.
