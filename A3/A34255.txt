A CONFESSION OF FAITH. Put forth by the ELDERS and BRETHREN Of many
CONGREGATIONS OF Christians (baptized upon Profession of their Faith) in London
and the Country.

With the Heart man believes unto Righteousness, and with the Mouth Confession
is made unto Salvation, Romans 10. 10. Search the Scriptures, John 5. 39. Printed
in the Year, 1677.

TO THE Judicious and Impartial READER
Courteous Reader,

IT is now many years since diverse of us (with other sober Christians then
living and walking in the way of the Lord that we profess) did conceive our
selves to be under a necessity of Publishing a Confession of our Faith, for the
information, and satisfaction of those, that did not thoroughly understand what
our principles were, or had entertained prejudices against our Profession, by
reason of the strange representation of them, by some men of note, who had
taken very wrong measures, and accordingly led others into misapprehensions, of
us, and them: and this was first put forth about the year, 1643. in the name of
seven Congregations then gathered in London; since which time, diverse
impressions thereof have been dispersed abroad, and our end proposed, in good
measure answered, inasmuch as many (and some of those men eminent, both for
piety and learning) were thereby satisfied, that we were no way guilty of those
Heterodoxies and fundamental errors, which had too frequently been charged upon
us without ground, or occasion given on our part. And forasmuch, as that
Confession is not now commonly to be had; and also that many others have since
embraced the same truth which is owned therein; it was judged necessary by us
to join together in giving a testimony to the world; of our firm adhering to
those wholesome Principles, by the publication of this which is now in your
hand.

And forasmuch as our method, and manner of expressing our sentiments, in this,
does vary from the former (although the substance of the matter is the same) we
shall freely impart to you the reason and occasion thereof. One thing that
greatly prevailed with us to undertake this work, was (not only to give a full
account of our selves, to those Christians that differ from us about the
subject of Baptism, but also) the profit that might from thence arise, unto
those that have any account of our labors, in their instruction, and
establishment in the great truths of the Gospel; in the clear understanding,
and steady belief of which, our comfortable walking with God, and fruitfulness
before him, in all our ways, is most nearly concerned; and therefore we did
conclude it necessary to express our selves the more fully, and distinctly;
and also to fix on such a method as might be most comprehensive of those things
which we designed to explain our sense, and belief of; and finding no defect,
in this regard, in that fixed on by the assembly, and after them by those of
the Congregational way, we did readily conclude it best to retain the same
order in our present confession: and also, when we observed that those last
mentioned, did in their confession (for reasons which seemed of weight both to
themselves and others) choose not only to express their mind in words
concurrent with the former in sense, concerning all those articles wherein they
were agreed, but also for the most part without any variation of the terms we
did in like manner conclude it best to follow their example in making use of
the very same words with them both, in these articles (which are very many)
wherein our faith and doctrine is the same with theirs, and this we did, the
more abundantly, to manifest our consent with both, in all the fundamental
articles of the Christian Religion; as also with many others, whose orthodox
confessions have been published to the world; on the behalf of the Protestants
in diverse Nations and Cities: and also to convince all, that we have no itch to
clogge Religion with new words, but do readily acquiesce in that form of sound
words, which has been, in consent with the holy Scriptures, used by others
before us; hereby declaring before God, Angels, and Men, our hearty agreement
with them, in that wholesome Protestant Doctrine, which with so clear evidence
of Scriptures they have asserted: some things indeed, are in some places added,
some terms omitted, and some few changed, but these alterations are of that
nature, as that we need not doubt, any charge or suspicion of unsoundness in
the faith, from any of our brethren upon the account of them.

In those things wherein we differ from others, we have expressed our selves with
all candor and plainness that none might entertain jealousy of ought secretly
lodged in our breasts, that we would not the world should be acquainted with;
yet we hope we have also observed those rules of modesty, and humility, as will
render our freedom in this respect inoffensive, even to those whose sentiments
are different from ours.

We have also taken care to affix texts of Scripture, in the margin for the
confirmation of each article in our confession, in which work we have
studiously endeavored to select such as are most clear and pertinent, for the
proof of what is asserted by us: and our earnest desire is, that all into whose
hands this may come, would follow that (never enough commended) example of the
noble Bereans, who searched the Scriptures daily, that they might find out
whether the things preached to them were so or not.

There is one thing more which we sincerely profess, and earnestly desire
credence in, viz. That contention is most remote from our design in all that we
have done in this matter: and we hope the liberty of an ingenuous unfolding our
principles, and opening our hearts unto our Brethren, with the Scripture
grounds on which our faith and practice leanes, will by none of them be either
denied to us, or taken ill from us. Our whole design is accomplished, if we may
obtain that Justice, as to be measured in our principles, and practice, and the
judgment of both by others, according to what we have now published; which the
Lord (whose eyes are as a flame of fire) knows to be the doctrine, which with
our hearts we must firmly believe, and sincerely endeavor to conform our lives
to. And oh that other contentions being laid asleep, the only care and
contention of all upon whom the name of our blessed Redeemer is called, might
for the future be, to walk humbly with their God, and in the exercise of all
Love and Meekness toward each other, to perfect holiness in the fear of the
Lord, each one endeavoring to have his conversation such as becomes the
Gospel; and also suitable to his place and capacity vigorously to promote in
others the practice of true Religion and undefiled in the sight of God and our
Father. And that in this backsliding day, we might not spend our breath in
fruitless complaints of the evils of others; but may every one begin at home,
to reform in the first place our own hearts, and ways; and then to quicken all
that we may have influence upon, to the same work; that if the will of God were
so, none might deceive themselves, by resting in, and trusting to, a form of
Godliness, without the power of it, and inward experience of the efficacy of
those truths that are professed by them.

And verily there is one spring and cause of the decay of Religion in our day,
which we cannot but touch upon, and earnestly urge a redress of; and that is
the neglect of the worship of God in Families, by those to whom the charge and
conduct of them is committed. May not the gross ignorance, and instability of
many; with the profaneness of others, be justly charged upon their Parents and
Masters, who have not trained them up in the way wherein they ought to walk
when they were young? but have neglected those frequent and solemn commands
which the Lord has laid upon them so to catechize, and instruct them, that
their tender years might be seasoned with the knowledge of the truth of God as
revealed in the Scriptures; and also by their own omission of Prayer, and other
duties of Religion in their families, together with the ill example of their
loose conversation, have inured them first to a neglect, and then contempt of
all Piety and Religion? we know this will not excuse the blindness, or
wickedness of any; but certainly it will fall heavy upon those that have thus
been the occasion thereof; they indeed dye in their sins; but will not their
blood be required of those under whose care they were, who yet permitted them
to go on without warning, yea led them into the paths of destruction? and will
not the diligence of Christians with respect to the discharge of these duties,
in ages past, rise up in judgment against, and condemn many of those who would
be esteemed such now?

We shall conclude with our earnest prayer, that the God of all grace, will
pour out those measures of his holy Spirit upon us, that the profession of
truth may be accompanied with the sound belief, and diligent practice of it by
us; that his name may in all things be glorified, through Jesus Christ our
Lord, Amen.

CHAP. I. Of the Holy Scriptures.
1. THe Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible 2 Timothy 3
15, 16, 17. Isa. 8. 20. Luke 16. 29, 31. Ephesians. 2. 20
rule of all saving Knowledge, Faith and Obedience; Although the Romans 1. 19,
20, 21. etc. chapter 2. 14, 15. Psalm. 19. 1, 2, 3.
light of Nature, and the works of Creation and Providence do so far manifest
the goodness, wisdom and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are
they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will, which is
necessary unto Salvation. Heb. 1. 1.
Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in diverse manners, to
reveal himself, and to declare that His will unto his Church; and afterward for
the better preserving, and propagating of the Truth, and for the more sure
Establishment, and Comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh,
and the malice of Satan, and of the World, to commit the same wholly unto Pro.
22. 19, 20, 21. Romans 15. 4. 2 Pet. 1. 19, 20.
writing; which makes the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former
ways of Gods revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.

2. Under the Name of Holy Scripture or the Word of God written; are now
contained all the Books of the Old and New Testament which are these,

Of the Old Testament.
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1
Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah,
Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Songs, Isaiah,
Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah,
Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi.

Of the new Testament.
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, The Acts of the Apostles, Paul's Epistle to the
Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Phillippians,
Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, to Titus,
to Philemon, the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epistle of James, The first and
second Epistles of Peter, The first, second and third Epistles of John, the
Epistle of Jude, the Revelation. All which are given by the 2 Timothy 3. 16.
inspiration of God, to be the rule of Faith and Life.

3. The Books commonly called Apocrypha not being of Luke 24. 27. 44. Romans 3. 2.
Divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon (or rule) of the Scripture, and
therefore are of no authority to the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise
approved or made use of, then other humane writings.

4. The Authority of the Holy Scripture for which it ought to be believed
depends not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon 2 Pet.
1. 19, 20, 21. 2 Timothy 3. 16. 2 These. 2. 13. 1 John 5. 9.
God (who is truth it self) the Author thereof; therefore it is to be received,
because it is the Word of God.

5. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church of God, to an
high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the
matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, and the Majesty of the style, the consent
of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God)
the full discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, and many other
incomparable Excellencies, and entire perfections thereof, are arguments
whereby it does abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; yet
notwithstanding; our Joh. 16. 13, 14. 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11, 12. 1 John 2. 2. 20. 27.
full persuasion, and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority
thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and
with the Word in our Hearts.

6. The whole Council of God concerning all things 2 Timothy 3. 15, 16, 17. Gal.
1. 8, 9.
necessary for his own Glory, Man's Salvation, Faith and Life, is either
expressly set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture; unto which
nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelation of the Spirit, or
traditions of men.

Nevertheless we acknowledge the John 6. 45. 1 Cor. 2. 9, 10, 11, 12.
inward illumination of the Spirit of God, to be necessary for the saving
understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word, and that there are
some circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the Church
common to humane actions and societies; which are to be 1 Cor. 11, 13, 14. and
chapter 14. 26. and 40.
ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence according to the
general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.

7. All things in Scripture are not alike 2 Pet. 3. 16.
plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all; yet those things which are
necessary to be known, believed, and observed for Salvation, are so Ps. 19. 7.
and 119. 130.
clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not
only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain
to a sufficient understanding of them.

8. The Old Testament in Romans 3. 2.
Hebrew, (which was the Native language of the people of God of old) and the
New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most
generally known to the Nations being immediately inspired by God, and by his
singular care and Providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore Isa. 8. 20
authentical; so as in all controversies of Religion the Church is finally to
appeal unto them Act. 15. 15.
But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who
have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the
fear of God to read John 5. 39.
and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language
of every Nation, unto which they 1 Cor. 14, 6, 9. 11, 12. 24 28.
come, that the Word of God dwelling Col. 3. 16
plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.

9. The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21.
Act. 15. 15, 16.
Scripture it self: And therefore when there is a question about the true and
full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold but one) it must be searched
by other places that speak more clearly.

10. The supreme judge by which all controversies of Religion are to be
determined, and all Decrees of Councels, opinions of ancient Writers, Doctrines
of men, and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are
to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into
which Mat. 22. 29. 31. Ephesians. 2. 20 Acts 28. 23.
Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved.

CHAP. II. Of God and of the Holy Trinity.
1. THE Lord our God is but 1 Cor. 8. 4 6. Deuteronomy. 6. 4.
one only living, and true God; whose Jer 10. 10. Isaiah 48. 12.
subsistence is in and of himself, Exodus 3. 14.
infinite in being, and perfection, whose Essence cannot be comprehended by any
but himself; Joh. 4. 24.
a most pure spirit, 1 Timothy 1. 17. Deuteronomy. 4. 15, 16.
invisible, without body, parts, or passions, who only has immortality,
dwelling in the light, which no man can approach unto, who is Mal. 3. 6.
immutable, 1 King. 8. 27. Jer. 23. 23.
immense, Ps. 90. 2.
eternal, incomprehensible, Genesis 17.
Almighty, every way infinite, Isa. 6. 3.
most holy, most wise, most free, most absolute, Ps. 115. 3. Isa. 45. 10.
working all things according to the council of his own immutable, and most
righteous will, Pro. 16. 4. Romans 11 36.
for his own glory, most loving, gracious, merciful, long suffering, abundant
in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, Exodus 34. 6,
7. Hebr. 11. 6.
the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and withal most just, Neh. 9.
32, 33.
and terrible in his judgments, Ps. 5. 5, 6.
hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the Exodus 34. 7. Nahum. 1, 2, 3.
guilty.

2. God having all Joh. 5. 26.
life, Ps. 148. 13.
glory, Ps. 119. 68.
goodness, blessedness, in and of himself: is alone in, and unto himself
all-sufficient, not Job, 22. 2, 3.
standing in need of any Creature which he has made, nor deriving any glory
from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them, he
is the alone fountain of all Being, Romans 11. 34. 35, 36.
of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he has most sovereign
Dan. 4. 25. and v. 34, 35.
dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever
himself pleases; in his sight Heb. 4. 13.
all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is Ezekiel. 11. 5 Act. 15. 18.
infinite, infallible, and independent upon the Creature, so as nothing is to
him contingent, or uncertain; he is most holy in all his Councels, in Ps. 145.
17.
all his Works, and in all his Commands; to him is due Rev. 5. 12, 13, 14.
from Angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience as Creatures
they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of
them.

3. In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, 1 John 5 7.
Mat. 28. 19. 2 Cor. 13. 14:
the Father the Word (or Son) and Holy Spirit, of one substance, power, and
Eternity, each having the whole Divine Essence, Exodus 3. 14. Joh. 14. 11. 1
Cor. 8. 6
yet the Essence undivided, the Father is of none neither begotten nor
proceeding, the Son is Joh. 1. 14. 18.
Eternally begotten of the Father, the holy Spirit Joh. 15. 26. Gal. 4. 6.
proceeding from the Father and the Son, all infinite, without beginning,
therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature and Being; but
distinguished by several peculiar, relative properties, and personal relations;
which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our Communion with God,
and comfortable dependence on him.

CHAP. III. Of Gods Decree.
1. GOD has Is. 46. 10. Ephesians. 1. 11. Heb. 6. 17. Romans 9. 15, 18.
Decreed in himself from all Eternity, by the most wise and holy Council of his
own will, freely and unchangeably, all things whatsoever comes to pass; yet so
as thereby is God neither the author of sin, Jam. 1. 15, 17. 1 John 1. 5.
nor has fellowship with any therein, nor is violence offered to the will of
the Creature, nor yet is the liberty, or contingency of second causes taken
away, but rather Act 4. 27, 28. Joh. 19. 11.
established, in which appears his wisdom in disposing all things, and power,
and faithfulness Numb. 23. 19. Ephesians. 1. 3, 4, 5.
in accomplishing his Decree.

2. Although God knows whatsoever may, or can come to pass upon all Act. 15.
18.
supposed conditions; yet has he not Decreed any thing, Romans 9. 11. 13. 16. 18.
because he foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such
conditions.

3. By the decree of God for the manifestation of his glory 1 Timothy 5. 21. Mat.
25. 41.
some men and Angels, are predestined, or foreordained to Eternal Life,
through Jesus Christ to the Ephesians. 1. 5, 6.
praise of his glorious grace; others being left to act in their sin to their
Romans 9. 22, 23. Jud. 4.
just condemnation, to the praise of his glorious justice.

4. These Angels and Men thus predestined, and foreordained, are
particularly, and unchangeably designed; and their 2 Timothy 2. 19. Joh. 13. 18.
number so certain, and definite, that it cannot be either increased, or
diminished.

5. Those of mankind Ephesians. 1. 4. 9. 11. Romans 8. 30. 2 Timothy 1. 9. 1 These. 5. 9.
that are predestined to life, God before the foundation of the world was
laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret Council
and good pleasure of his will, has chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory,
out of his mere free grace and love; Romans 9. 13. 16. Ephesians. 1. 6. 12.
without any other thing in the creature as a condition or cause moving him
thereunto.

6. As God has appointed the Elect unto glory, so he has by the eternal and
most free purpose of his will, foreordained 1 Pet. 1. 2. 2 These. 2. 13.
all the means thereunto, wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, 1
These. 5. 9, 10.
are redeemed by Christ, are effectually Romans 8. 30. 2 These. 2. 13.
called unto faith in Christ, by his spirit working in due season, are
justified, adopted, sanctified, and kept by his power through faith 1 Pet. 1. 5.
unto salvation; neither are any other redeemed by Christ, or effectually
called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the Elect Joh. 10. 26.
Joh. 17. 9. Joh. 6. 64.
only.

7. The Doctrine of this high mystery of predestination, is to be handled with
special prudence, and care; that men attending the will of God revealed in his
word, and yiedling obedience thereunto, may from the certainty of their
effectual vocation, be assured of their 1 These. 1. 4, 5. 2 Pet. 1. 10.
eternal election; so shall this doctrine afford matter Ephesians. 1. 6. Romans 11. 33.
of praise, reverence, and admiration of God, and Romans 11. 5, 6.
of humility, diligence, and abundant Luke 10. 20.
consolation, to all that sincerely obey the Gospel.

CHAP. IV. Of Creation.
1. IN the beginning it pleased God the Father, John 1. 2, 3. Heb. 1. 2. Job
26. 13
Son, and Holy Spirit, for the manifestation of the glory of Romans 1. 20.
his eternal power, wisdom, and goodness, to Create or make the world, and all
things therein, Col. 1. 16. Gen 2. 1, 2.
whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days, and all very good.

2. After God had made all other Creatures, he Created Genesis 1. 27.
man, male and female, with Genesis 2. 7.
reasonable and immortal souls, rendering them sit unto that life to God, for
which they were Created; being Eccles. 7. 29. Genesis 1. 26
made after the image of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness;
having the Law of God Romans 2. 14, 15.
written in their hearts, and power to fulfill it; and yet under a possibility
of transgressing, being left to the liberty of their own will, which was Genesis
3. 6.
subject to change.

3. Besides the Law written in their hearts, they received Genesis 6. 17. and chapter
3. 8, 9, 10.
a command not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; which whilst
they kept, they were happy in their Communion with God, and had dominion Genesis
1. 26, 28.
over the Creatures.

CHAP. V. Of Divine Providence.
1. GOD the good Creator of all things, in his infinite power, and wisdom, does
Heb. 1. 3. Job 38. 11. Isa. 46 10, 11. Ps. 135. 6.
uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all Creatures, and things, from the
greatest even to the Mat. 10. 29, 30, 31.
least, by his most wife and holy providence, to the end for the which they
were Created; according unto his infallible foreknowledge, and the free and
immutable Council of his Ephesians. 1. 11.
own will; to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power, justice, infinite
goodness and mercy.

2. Although in relation to the foreknowledge and Decree of God, the first
cause, all things come to pass Act. 2. 23.
immutably and infallibly; so that there is not any thing, befalls any Pro. 16.
33.
by chance, or without his Providence; yet by the same Providence he orders
them to fall out, according to the nature of second causes, either Genesis 8. 22.
necessarily, freely, or contingently.

3. God in his ordinary Providence Act. 27. 31. 44. Isa. 55. 10 11.
makes use of means; yet is free Hos. 1. 7
to work, without, Romans 4. 19, 20, 21.
above, and Dan. 3. 27.
against them at his pleasure.

4. The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God, so
far manifest themselves in his Providence, that his determinate Council Romans 11
32, 33. 34. 2 Samuel 24 1. 1 Chro. 21. 1.
extends it self even to the first fall, and all other sinful actions both of
Angels, and Men; (and that not by a bare permission) which also he most wisely
and powerfully 2 Kings 19. 28. Ps. 76. 10.
boundeth, and otherwise orders, and governs, in a manifold dispensation to
his most holy Genesis 50 20. Isa. 10 6, 7. 12.
ends: yet so, as the sinfulness of their acts proceeds only from the
Creatures, and not from God; who being most holy and righteous, neither is nor
can be, the author or Ps. 50. 21 1 John 2. 16.
approver of sin.

5. The most wise, righteous, and gracious God, does oftentimes, leave for a
season his own children to manifold temptations, and the corruptions of their
own heart, to chastise them for their former sins, or to discover unto them the
hidden strength of corruption, and deceitsulness of their hearts, 2 Chro. 32.
25, 26. 31. 2 Samuel 24 1. 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9.
that they may be humbled; and to raise them to a more close, and constant
dependence for their support, upon himself; and to make them more watchful
against all future occasions of sin, and for other just and holy ends.

So that whatsoever befalls any of his elect is by his appointment, for his
glory, Romans 8. 28.
and their good.

6. As for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God as a righteous judge, for
former sin does Romans 1. 24. 26. 28. chapter 11. 7, 8.
blind and harden; from them he not only withholdeth his Deuteronomy. 29. 4.
Grace, whereby they might have been enlightened in their understanding, and
wrought upon in their hearts: But sometimes also withdraws Mat. 13. 12.
the gifts which they had, and exposes them to such Deuteronomy. 2. 30.
objects as their corruptions makes occasion of sin; and withal Psalm. 81. 11,
12. 2 These. 2. 10, 11, 12.
gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the
power of Satan, whereby it comes to pass, that they Exodus 8. 15. 32. Is. 6. 9,
10. 1 Pet. 2. 7, 8.
harden themselves, even under those means which God uses for the softning of
others.

7. As the Providence of God does in general reach to all Creatures, so after a
most special manner it takes care of his 1 Timothy 4. 10. Amos 9. 8, 9. Isa. 43.
3, 4, 5.
Church, and disposes of all things to the good thereof.

CHAP. VI. Of the fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment thereof.
1. ALthough God created Man upright, and perfect, and gave him a righteous
law, which had been unto life had he kept it, Genesis 2. 16, 17,
and threatened death upon the breach thereof; yet he did not long abide in this
honor; Genesis 3. 12, 13. 2 Cor. 11 3.
Satan using the subtilty of the serpent to seduce Eve, then by her seducing
Adam, who without any compulsion, did wilfully transgress the Law of their
Creation, and the command given unto them, in eating the forbidden fruit; which
God was pleased according to his wise and holy Council to permit, having
purposed to order it, to his own glory.

2. Our first Parents by this Sin, fell from their Romans 3. 23.
original righteousness and communion with God, and we in them, whereby death
came upon all; Rom 5. 12. etc.
all becoming dead in Sin, and wholly defiled, Tit. 1. 15 Genesis 6. 5. Jer. 17 9.
Romans 3. 10-19.
in all the faculties, and parts, of soul, and body.

3. They being the Romans 5. 12-19. 1 Cor. 15 21, 22 45. 49.
root, and by Gods appointment, standing in the room, and stead of all mankind;
the guilt of the Sin was imputed, and corrupted nature conveyed, to all their
posterity descending from them by ordinary generation, being now Ps. 51. 5. Job
14. 4.
conceived in Sin, and by nature children Ephesians. 2. 3.
of wrath, the servants of Sin, the subjects Romans 6. 20. and chapter 5. 12.
of death and all other miseries, spiritual, temporal and eternal, unless the
Lord Jesus Heb. 2. 14. 1 These. 1. 10.
set them free.

4. From this original corruption, whereby we are Romans 8. 7. Col. 1. 21.
utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and wholly
inclined to all evil, do Jam. 1 14, 15. Mat. 15. 19.
proceed all actual transgressions.

5. This corruption of nature, during this Life, does Romans 7. 18. 23. Eccles.
7. 20. 1 John 1. 8.
remain in those that are regenerated: and although it be through Christ
pardoned, and mortified, yet both it self, and the first motions thereof, are
truly and properly Romans 7. 24. 25. Gal. 5. 17
Sin.

CHAP. VII. Of Gods Covenant.
1. THE distance between God and the Creature is so great, that although
reasonable Creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could
never have attained the reward of Life, but by some Luke 17. 10. Job 35. 7. 8.
voluntary condescension on Gods part, which he has been pleased to express,
by way of Covenant.

2. Moreover Man having brought himself Genesis 2. 17. Gal. 3. 10. Romans 3. 20, 21.
under the curse of the Law by his fall, it pleased the Lord to make a Covenant
of Grace wherein he freely offers unto Sinners, Romans 8. 3. Mark 16. 15. 16.
Joh. 3. 16.
Life and Salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them Faith in him, that they
may be saved; and Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27. Joh. 6. 44 45. Ps. 110. 3.
promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto eternal Life, his holy
Spirit, to make them willing, and able to believe.

3. This Covenant is revealed in the Gospel; first of all to Adam in the
promise of Salvation by the Genesis 3. 15.
seed of the woman, and afterward by farther steps, until the full Heb. 1. 1.
discovery thereof was completed in the new Testament; and it is founded in
that 2 Timothy 1. 9. Tit. 1. 2.
Eternal Covenant transaction, that was between the Father and the Son, about
the Redemption of the Elect; and it is alone by the Grace of this Covenant,
that all of the posterity of fallen Adam, that ever were Heb, 11. 6. 13. Romans
4. 1, 2, etc. Act. 4. 12. Joh. 8. 56.
saved, did obtain life and a blessed immortality; Man being now utterly
incapable of acceptance with God upon those terms, on which Adam stood in his
state of innocence.

CHAP. VIII. Of Christ the Mediator.
1. IT pleased God in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus
his only begotten Son, according to the Covenant made between them both, Is.
42. 1. 1. Pet. 1. 19, 20.
to be the Mediator between God and Man; the Act. 3. 22.
Prophet, Heb. 5. 5, 6.
Priest and Ps. 2. 6, Luke 1. 33 Ephesians. 1. 23 Heb. 1. 2. Act. 17. 31
King; Head and Savior of his Church, the heir of all things, and judge of the
world: Unto whom he did from all Eternity Is. 53. 10. Joh. 17. 6. Romans 8. 30.
give a people to be his seed, and to be by him in time redeemed, called,
justified, sanctified, and glorified.

2. The Son of God, the second Person in the Holy Trinity, being very and
eternal God, the brightness of the Fathers glory, of one substance and equal
with him: who made the World, who upholdeth and governs all things he has
made: did when the fullness of time was come take unto him Joh. 1. 1. 14. Gal.
4. 4.
man's nature, with all the Essential properties, and com. mon infirmities
thereof, Romans 8. 3. Heb. 2. 14. 16, 17. chapter 4. 15.
yet withou sin: being conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin
Mary, the Holy Spirit coming down upon her, and the power of the most High
overshadowing her, Luke 1. 27, 31. 35.
and so was made of a Woman, of the Tribe of Judah, of the Seed of Abraham, and
David according to the Scriptures: So that two whole, perfect, and distinct
natures, were inseparably joined together in one Person: without conversion,
composition, or confusion: which Person is very God, and very Man; yet one Romans
9. 5. 1 Timothy 2. 5.
Christ, the only Mediator between God and Man.

3. The Lord Jesus in his humane nature thus united to the divine, in the
Person of the Son, was sanctified, and anointed Ps. 45. 7. Act. 10. 38 Joh. 3.
34.
with the Holy Spirit, above measure; having in him Col. 2. 3.
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; in whom it pleased the Father that
Col. 1. 19,
all fullness should dwell: To the end that being Heb. 7. 26.
holy, harmless, undefiled, and full Joh 1. 14.
of Grace, and Truth, he might be thoroughly furnished to execute the office of
a Mediator, and Heb. 7. 22.
Surety; which office he took not upon himself, but was thereunto Heb. 5. 5.
called by his Father; who also put Joh. 5. 22. 27. Mat. 28. 18. Act. 2. 36.
all power and judgment in his hand, and gave him Commandment to execute the
same.

4. This office the Lord Jesus did most Ps. 40. 7, 8. Heb. 10. 5-11. Joh. 10.
18.
willingly undertake, which that he might discharge he was made under the Law,
Gal. 4. 4. Mat. 3. 15.
and did perfectly fulfill it, and underwent the Gal. 3. 13. Isa. 53. 6. 1 Pet.
3. 18.
punishment due to us, which we should have born and suffered, being made 2
Cor. 5 21.
Sin and a Curse for us: enduring most grievous sorrows Mat. 26. 37, 38. Luke
22. 44. Mat. 27. 46.
in his Soul; and most painful sufferings in his body; was crucified, and died,
and remained in the state of the dead; yet saw no Act. 13. 37.
corruption: on the 1 Cor. 15. 3, 4.
third day he arose from the dead, with the same Joh. 20. 25. 27.
body in which he suffered; with which he also Mark 16 19. Act. 1. 9, 10, 11.
ascended into heaven: and there sits at the right hand of his Father, Romans
8. 34. Heb. 9. 24
making intercession; and shall Act. 10. 42. Romans 14. 9, 10. Act. 1. 10,
return to judge Men and Angels, at the end of the World.

5. The Lord Jesus by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, which he
through the Eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, Heb. 9. 14. chapter 10. 14.
Romans 3. 25, 26.
has fully satisfied the Justice of God, procured reconciliation, and
purchased an Everlasting inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven, Joh. 17. 2. Heb.
9. 15.
for all those whom the Father has given unto him.

6. Although the price of Redemption was not actually paid by Christ, till
after his Incarnation, 1 Cor. 4. 10. Heb. 4. 2.
yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefit thereof were communicated to the 1 Pet.
1. 10, 11.
Elect in all ages successively, from the beginning of the World, in and by
those Promises, Types, and Sacrifices, wherein he was revealed, and signified
to be the Seed of the Woman, which should bruise the Serpents head; Rev. 13. 8.
and the Lamb slain from the foundation of the World: Heb. 13. 8.
Being the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

7. Christ in the work of Mediation acts according to both natures, by each
nature doing that which is proper to it self; yet by reason of the Unity of the
Person, that which is proper to one nature, is sometimes in Scripture
attributed to the Person Joh. 3. 13. Act. 20. 28.
denominated by the other nature.

8. To all those for whom Christ has obtained eternal redemption, he does
certainly; and effectually Joh. 6. 37. chapter 10. 15. 16. and chapter 17. 9. Romans 5.
10.
apply, and communicate the same; making intercession for them, uniting them to
himself by his spirit, Joh. 17 6. Ephesians. 1. 9. 1 John 5. 20.
revealing unto them, in and by the word, the mystery of salvation; persuading
them to believe, and obey; Romans 8. 9. 14.
governing their hearts by his word and spirit, and Ps. 110. 1. 1 Cor. 15. 25,
26.
overcoming all their enemies by his Almighty power, and wisdom; in such
manner, and ways as are most consonant to his wonderful, and Joh. 3. 8 Ephesians. 1.
8.
unsearchable dispensation; and all of free, and absolute Grace, without any
condition foreseen in them, to procure it.

9. This office of Mediator between God and Man, is proper 1 Timothy 2. 5.
only to Christ, who is the Prophet, Priest, and King of the Church of God;
and may not be either in whole, or any part thereof transferred from him to any
other.

10. This number and order of Offices is necessary; for in respect of our Joh.
1. 18.
ignorance, we stand in need of his prophetical Office; and in respect of our
alienation from God, Col. 1. 21. Gal. 5. 17.
and imperfection of the best of our services, we need his Priestly office, to
reconcile us, and present us acceptable unto God: and in respect of our
averseness, and utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue, and
security from our spiritual adversaries, we need his Kingly office, Joh. 16. 8.
Ps. 110. 3 Luke 1. 74. 75.
to convince, subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to his Heavenly
Kingdom.

CHAP. IX. Of Free Will.
1. GOD has endued the Will of Man, with that natural liberty, and power of
acting upon choice; that it is Mat. 17. 12. Jam. 1 14. Deuteronomy. 30. 19.
neither forced, nor by any necessity of nature determined to do good or evil.

2. Man in his state of innocence, had freedom, and power, to will, and to do
that Eccl. 7. 29.
which was good, and well-pleasing to God; but yet Genesis 3. 6
was mutable, so that he might fall from it.

3. Man by his fall into a state of sin has wholly lost Romans 5. 6. chapter 8. 7.
all ability of Will, to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a
natural man, being altogether averse from that good, Ephesians. 2. 1. 5.
and dead in Sin, is not able, by his own strength, to Tit. 3 3, 4, 5. Joh. 6.
44.
convert himself; or to prepare himself thereunto.

4. When God converts a sinner, and translates him into the state of Grace Col.
1. 13. Joh. 8. 36.
he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin, and by his grace alone,
enables him Phil. 2. 13.
freely to will, and to do that which is spiritually good; yet so as that by
reason of his Romans 7. 15. 18, 19 21. 23.
remaining corruptions he does not perfectly nor only will that which is good;
but does also will that which is evil.

5. The Will of Man is made Ephesians. 4. 13.
perfectly, and immutably free to good alone, in the state of Glory only.

CHAP. X. Of Effectual Calling.
1. THose whom God has predestined unto Life, he is pleased in his
appointed, and accepted time, Romans 8. 30. Romans 11. 7. Ephesians. 1. 10, 11. 2 These.
3. 13, 14.
effectually to call by his word, and Spirit, out of that state of sin, and
death, in which they are by nature, to grace and Salvation Ephesians. 2. 1-6.
by Jesus Christ; inlightning their minds, spiritually, and savingly to Act.
26. 18. Ephesians. 1. 17. 18.
understand the things of God; taking away their Ezk. 36: 26.
heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh; renewing their wills,
and by his Almighty power determining them Deuteronomy. 30 6. Ezekiel. 36. 27. Ephesians. 1. 19.
to that which is good, and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ; yet so as
they come Ps. 110. Cant. 1. 4.
most freely, being made willing by his Grace.

2. This Effectual Call is of God's free, and special grace alone, 2 Timothy 1. 9.
Ephesians. 2. 8.
not from any thing at all foreseen in man, nor from any power, or agency in
the Creature, coworking with his special Grace, 1 Cor. 2. 14. Ephesians. 2. 5. Joh.
5. 25.
the Creature being wholly passive therein, being dead in sins and trespasses,
until being quickened and renewed by the holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to
answer this call, and to embrace the Grace offered and conveyed in it; and that
by no less Ephesians. 1. 19, 20.
power, then that which raised up Christ from the dead.

3. Elect Infants dying in infancy, are Joh. 3. 3 5, 6.
regenerated and saved by Christ through the Spirit; who works when, and
where, and Joh. 3. 8.
how he pleases: so also are all other elect persons, who are incapable of
being outwardly called by the Ministry of the Word.

4. Others not elected, although they may be called by the Ministry of the
word, Mat. 22 14. chapter 13. 20, 21. Heb. 6. 4, 5.
and may have some common operations of the Spirit, yet not being effectually
drawn by the Father, they neither will, nor can truly John 6. 44, 45. 65. 1 John 2. 24, 25.
come to Christ; and therefore cannot be saved: much less can men that receive
not the Christian Religion Act. 4. 12. Joh. 4. 22. chapter 17. 3.
be saved; be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the
light of nature, and the Law of that Religion they do profess.

CHAP. XI. Of Justification.
1. THose whom God Effectually calls, he also freely Romans 3. 24. chapter 8. 30.
justifies, not by infusing Righteousness into them, but by Romans 4. 5, 6, 7,
8. Ephesians. 1. 7.
pardoning their sins, and by accounting, and accepting their Persons as 1 Cor.
1. 30, 31. Romans 5. 17 18, 19.
Righteous; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for
Christ's sake alone, not by imputing faith it self, the act of beleiving, or
any other Phil. 3. 8, 9. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9, 10.
evangelical obedience to them, as their Righteousness; but by imputing Christ's
active obedience unto the whole Law, and passive obedience in his death, for
their whole and sole Righteousnnss, they Joh. 1. 12. Romans 5. 17.
receiving, and resting on him, and his Righteousness, by Faith; which faith
they have not of themselves, it is the gift of God.

2. Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ, and his Righteousness, is the
Romans 3. 28.
alone instrument of Justification: yet it is not alone in the person
justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving Graces, and is no dead
faith, Gal. 5. 6 Jam. 2. 17 22. 26.
but works by love.

3. Christ by his obedience, and death, did fully discharge the debt of all
those that are justified; and did by the sacrifice of himself, in the blood of
his cross, undergoing in their stead, the penalty due unto them: make a proper,
real and full satisfaction Heb. 10. 14. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. Isa. 53. 5, 6.
to Gods justice in their behalf: yet in as much as he was given by the Father
for them, and his Obedience and Satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both
Romans 8. 32. 2 Cor. 5. 21.
freely, not for any thing in them; their Justification is only of Free Grace,
that both the exact justice and rich Grace of God, might be Romans 3. 26. Ephesians. 1
6, 7. chapter 2. 7.
glorified in the Justification of sinners.

4. God did from all eternity decreeto Gal. 3. 8. 1 Pet. 1. 2 1 Timothy 2. 6.
justify all the Elect, and Christ did in the fullness of time die for their
sins, and rise Romans 4. 25.
again for their Justification; Nevertheless they are not justified personally,
until the Holy Spirit, does in due time Col. 1. 21; 22. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7.
actually apply Christ unto them.

5. God does continue to Mat. 6. 12. 1 John 1. 7. 9.
Forgive the sins of those that are justified, and although they can never fall
from the state of Joh. 10 28.
justification; yet they may by their sins fall under Gods Ps. 89. 31, 32, 33.
Fatherly displeasure; and in that condition, they have not usually the light
of his Countenance restored unto them, until they Psalm. 32: 5. and 51. Mat.
26. 75.
humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith, and
repentance.

6. The Justification of Believers under the Old Testament was in all these
respects, Gal. 3. 9. Romans 4. 22, 23, 24.
one and the same with the justification of Believers under the New Tement.

CHAP. XII. Of Adoption.
ALL those that are justified, God vouchsafed, in, and for the sake of his only
Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the Grace Ephesians. 1. 5. Gal. 4. 4, 5.
of Adoption; by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the Liberties,
and Joh. 1. 12 Romans 8. 17
Priveledges of Children of God; have his 2 Cor. 6. 18. Rev. 3. 12.
name put upon them, Romans 8. 15.
receive the Spirit of Adoption, Gal. 4. 6. Ephesians. 2. 18
have access to the throne of Grace with boldness, are enabled to cry Abba
Father, are Ps. 103. 13.
pitied, Prove. 14 26.
protected, 1 Pet. 5. 7.
provided for, and Heb. 12. 6.
chastned by him, as by a Father; yet never Is. 54. 8, 9. Lam. 3. 31.
cast off; but sealed Ephesians. 4. 30.
to the day of Redemption, and inherit the promises, Heb. 1. 14. chapter 6. 12.
as heirs, of everlasting Salvation.

CHAP. XIII. Of Sanctification.
1. THey who are united to Christ, Effectually called, and regenerated, having
a new heart, and a new Spirit created in them, through the virtue of Christ's
death, and Resurrection; are also Act. 20. 32. Romans 6. 5, 6.
farther sanctified, really, and personally, through the same virtue, Joh. 17.
17. Ephesians. 3. 16, 17, 18, 19. 1 These. 5. 21, 22, 23.
by his word and Spirit dwelling in them; Romans 6. 14.
the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed, Gal. 5. 24.
and the several lusts thereof, are more and more weakened, and mortified; and
they more and more quickened, and Col. 1. 11
strengthened in all saving graces, to the 2 Cor. 7. 1. Heb. 12. 14.
practice of all true holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.

2. This Sanctification is 1 These. 5. 23.
throughout, in the whole man, yet imperfect Romans 7. 18, 23.
in this life; there abides still some remnants of corruption in every part,
whence arises a Gal. 5. 17. 1 Pet. 2. 11.
continual, and irreconcilable war; the Flesh lusting against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the Flesh.

3. In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may much Romans 7.
23,
prevail; yet through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying
Spirit of Christ the Romans 6. 14.
regenerate part does overcome; and so the Saints grow in Grace, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God; Ephesians. 4. 15. 16. 2 Cor. 3. 18. chapter 7. 1
pressing after an heavenly life, in Evangelical Obedience to all the commands
which Christ as Head and King, in his Word has prescribed to them.

CHAP. XIV. Of Saving Faith.
1. THE Grace of Faith, whereby the Elect are enabled to believe to the saving
of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ 2 Cor. 4. 13. Ephesians. 2. 8.
in their hearts; and is ordinarily wrought by the Ministry of the Romans 10 14.
17.
Word; by which also, and by the administration of Baptism, and the Lords
Supper, Prayer and other Means appointed of God, it is increased, Luke 17. 5. 1
Pet. 2. 2. Act. 20. 32.
and strengthened.

2. By this Faith, a Christian believes to be true, Act. 24. 14.
whatsoever is revealed in the Word, for the Authority of God himself; and also
apprehends an excellency therein, Ps. 19. 7, 8, 9, 10. Ps. 119. 72
above all other Writings; and all things in the world: as it bears forth the
Glory of God in his Attributes, the excellency of Christ in his Nature and
Offices; and the Power and Fullness of the Holy Spirit in his Workings, and
Operations; and so is enabled to 2 Timothy 1. 12.
cast his Soul upon the truth thus believed; and also acts differently, upon
that which each particular, passage thereof contains; yiedling obedience to
the Joh. 15. 14.
commands, trembling at the Is. 66. 2.
threatenings, and embracing the Heb. 11. 13.
promises of God, for this life, and that which is to come: But the principal
acts of Saving Faith, have immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving,
and resting upon Joh. 1. 12. Act. 16 31. Gal. 2. 20. Act. 15. 11.
him alone, for Justification, Sanctification, and Eternal Life, by virtue of
the Covenant of Grace.

3. This Faith although it be different in degrees, and may be weak, Heb. 5.
13. 14. Mat. 6. 30 Romans 4. 19 20.
or strong; yet it is in the least degree of it, different in the kind, or
nature of it (as is all other saving Grace) from the Faith, 2 Pet. 1. 1.
and common grace of temporary beleivers; and therefore though it may be many
times assailed, and weakened; yet it gets Ephesians. 6. 16. 1 John 5. 4, 5.
the victory; growing up in many, to the attainment of a full Heb. 6. 11, 12.
Col. 2. 2.
assurance through Christ, who is both the Author Heb. 12. 2.
and finisher of our Faith.

CHAP. XV. Of Repentance unto Life and Salvation.
1. SUch of the Elect as are converted at riper years, having Tit. 3. 2, 3, 4,
5.
sometimes lived in the state of nature, and therein served diverse lusts and
pleasures, God in their Effectual Calling gives them Repentance unto Life.

2. Whereas there is none that does good, and sins Eccl. 7. 20.
not; and the best of men may through the power, and deceitfulness of their
corruption dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great
sins, and provocations; God has in the Covenant of Grace, mercifully provided
that Beleivers so sinning, and falling, Luke 22. 31, 32.
be renewed through Repentance unto Salvation.

3. This saving Repentance is an Zech. 12. 10. Act. 11. 18.
evangelical Grace, whereby a person being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of
the manifold evils of his fin, does, by Faith in Christ, humble himself for it,
with godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self abhorrency; Ezekiel. 36. 31. 2 Cor.
7. 11.
praying for pardon, and strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavor by
supplies of the Spirit, to Ps. 119 6. Ps. 119. 128.
walk before God unto all well pleasing in all things.

4. As Repentance is to be continued through the whole course of our lives,
upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof; so it is every
man's duty, to repent of his Luke 19. 8. 1 Timothy 1. 13. 15.
particular known sins, particularly.

5. Such is the provision which God has made through Christ in the Covenant of
Grace, for the preservation of Believers unto Salvation, that although there is
no sin so small, but it deserves Romans 6. 23.
damnation; yet there is no sin so great, that it shall bring damnation on them
that Is. 1. 16. 18. Is. 55. 7.
repent; which makes the constant preaching of Repentance necessary.

CHAP. XVI. Of Good Works.
1. GOod Works are only such as God has Mic. 6. 8. Heb. 13 21.
commanded in his Holy word; and not such as without the warrant thereof, are
devised by men, out of blind zeal, Mat. 15. 9. Isa. 29. 13.
or upon any pretense of good intentions.

2. These good works, done in obedience to Gods commandments, are the fruits,
and evidences Jam. 2. 18. 22.
of a true, and lively faith; and by them Believers manifest their Ps. 116. 12,
13.
thankfullness, strengthen their 1 John 2 3. 5. 2 Pet. 1. 5-11.
assurance, edify their Mat. 5. 16.
brethren, adorn the profession of the Gospel, stop the mouths of the
adversaries and glorify 1 Timothy 6. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 15. Phil. 1. 11
God whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus Ephesians. 2. 10.
thereunto, that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end Romans
6. 22.
eternal life.

3. Their ability to do good works, is not at all of themselves; but wholly
from the Spirit Joh. 15. 4. 6.
of Christ; and that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they
have already received, there is necessary an 2 Cor. 3. 5. Phil. 2. 13.
actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in them to will, and to do,
of his good pleasure; yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they
were not bound to perform any duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit;
but they ought to be diligent in Phil. 2. 12. Heb. 6. 11 12. Isa. 64. 7.
stirring up the Grace of God that is in them.

4. They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which is possible
in this life, are so far from being able to superrogate, and to do more then
God requires, as that Job 9. 2 3. Gal. 5. 17. Luke 17. 10.
they fall short of much which in duty they are bound to do.

5. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of Sin or Eternal Life at the hand
of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the glory
to come; and the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom by them we
can neither profit, nor satisfy for the debt of our Romans 3. 20. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.
Romans 4. 6.
former sins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and
are unprofitable servants; and because as they are good they proceed from his
Gal. 5. 22, 23.
Spirit, and as they are wrought by us they are defiled Isa. 64. 6. Ps. 143 2.
and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection that they cannot endure the
severity of Gods judgment.

6. Yet notwithstanding the persons of Believers being accepted through Christ
their good works also are accepted in Ephesians. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 5.
him; not as though they were in this life wholly unblameable and unreprovable
in Gods sight; but that he looking upon them in his Son is pleased to accept
and reward that which is Mat. 25. 21. 23. Heb. 6. 10
sincere although accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections.

7. Works done by unregenerate men although for the matter of them they may be
things which God commands, and of good use, both to themselves and 2 King. 10.
30. 1 King. 21. 27, 29
others; yet because they proceed not from a heart purified by Genesis 4. 5. Heb.
11 4. 6.
faith, nor are done in a right manner according to the 1 Cor. 13. 1.
word, nor to a right end the Mat. 6. 2. 5.
glory of God; they are therefore sinful and cannot please God; nor make a man
meet to receive grace from Amos 5 21, 22. Romans 9. 16 Tit. 3. 5.
God; and yet their neglect of them is more sinful and Job 21. 14, 15. Mat. 25.
41, 42, 43
displeasing to God.

CHAP. XVII. Of Perseverance of the Saints.
1. THose whom God has accepted in the beloved, effectually called and
Sanctified by his Spirit, and given the precious faith of his Elect unto, can
neither totally nor finally fall from the state of grace; Joh. 10. 28. 29. Phi.
1. 6. 2 Timothy 2. 19. 1 John 2. 19.
but shall certainly persevere therein to the end and be eternally saved,
seeing the gifts and callings of God are without Repentance, (whence he still
begets and nourishes in them Faith, Repentance, Love, Joy, Hope, and all the
graces of the Spirit unto immortality) and though many storms and floods arise
and beat against them, yet they shall never be able to take them off that
foundation and rock which by faith they are fastened upon: notwithstanding
through unbelief and the temptations of Satan the sensible sight of the light
and love of God, may for a time be clouded, and obscured from Psalm. 89. 31, 32.
1 Cor. 11. 32.
them, yet he is still the same Mal. 3. 6
and they shall be sure to be kept by the power of God unto Salvation, where
they shall enjoy their purchased possession, they being engraven upon the palm
of his hands, and their names having been written in the book of life from all
Eternity.

2. This perseverance of the Saints depends not upon their own free will; but
upon the immutability of the decree of Romans 8. 30. chapter 9. 11. 16.
Election flowing from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father; upon
the efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ Romans 5. 9, 10. John
14. 19.
and Union with him, the Heb. 6. 17, 18.
oath of God, the abiding of his Spirit and the 1 John 3. 9.
seed of God within them, and the nature of the Jer. 32. 40.
Covenant of Grace from all which arises also the certainty and infallibility
thereof.

3. And though they may through the temptation of Satan and of the world, the
prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of means of their
preservation fall into grievous Mat. 26. 70, 72. 74.
sins, and for a time continue therein; whereby they incur Is. 64. 5. 9. Ephesians.
4. 30
Gods displeasure, and grieve his holy Spirit, come to have their graces and
Psalm. 51. 10. 12.
comforts impaired have their hearts hardened, and their Consciences wounded,
Psa. 32. 3, 4.
hurt, and scandalize others, and bring temporal judgments 2 Samuel 12 14.
upon themselves: yet they shall renew their Luke 22. 32. and v. 61 62.
repentance and be preserved through faith in Christ Jesus to the end.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation.
1. ALthough temporary Believers, and other unregenerate men, may vainly
deceive themselves with false hopes, and carnal presumptions, of being in the
favor of God, and state of salvation, Job 8. 13. 14. Mat. 7. 22 23.
which hope of theirs shall perish; yet such as truly believe in the Lord
Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good Conscience
before him, may in this life be certainly assured 1 John 2. 3. chapter 3. 14 18,
19. 21. 24. chapter 5. 13.
that they are in the state of Grace; and may rejoice in the hope of the glory
of God which hope shall never make them Romans 5. 2. 5.
ashamed.

2. This certainty is not abare conjectural, and probable persuasion, grounded
upon Heb. 6. 11. 19.
a fallible hope; but an infallible assurance of faith founded on the Blood and
Righteousness of Christ Heb. 6. 17, 18.
revealed in the Gospel; and also upon the inward 2 Pet. 1. 4, 5, 10. 11.
evidence of those graces of the Spirit unto which promises are made, and on
the testimony of the Romans 8. 15, 16.
Spirit of adoption, witnessing with our Spirits that we are the children of
God; and as a fruit thereof keeping the heart both 1 John 3 1, 2, 3.
humble and holy.

3. This infallible assurance does not so belong to the essence of faith, but
that a true Believer, may wait long and conflict with many difficulties before
he be Isa. 50. 10. Ps. 88. and Psa. 77. 1-12.
partaker of it; yet being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are
freely given him of God, he may without extraordinary revelation in the right
use of means 1 John 4 13. Heb. 6. 11 12.
attain thereunto: and therefore it is the duty of every one, to give all
diligence to make their Calling and Election sure, that thereby his heart may
be enlarged in peace and joy in the holy Spirit, in love and thankfulness to
God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience, the proper
Romans 5. 1, 2. 5. chapter 14, 17. Ps. 119. 32.
fruits of this Assurance; so far is it Romans 6. 1, 2. Tit. 2. 11, 12. 14.
from inclining men to looseness.

4. True Believers may have the assurance of their Salvation diverse ways
shaken, diminished, and intermitted; as Cant. 5. 2, 3. 6.
by negligence in preserving of it, by Ps. 51. 8. 12. 14.
falling into some special Sin, which wounds the Conscience, and grieveth the
Spirit, by some sudden or Psa. 116. 11. Ps. 77. 7, 8. Ps. 31 22.
vehement temptation, by Gods withdrawing the Ps. 30. 7
light of his countenance and suffering even such as fear him to walk in
darkness and to have no light; yet are they never destitute of the 1 John 3. 9.
seed of God, and Life Luke 22. 32.
of Faith, that Love of Christ, and the brethren, that sincerity of Heart, and
Conscience of duty, out of which by the operation of the Spirit, this Assurance
may in due time be Ps. 42. 5. 11.
revived: and by the which in the mean time they are Lam. 3. 26. 27-31.
preserved from utter despair.

CHAP. XIX. Of the Law of God.
1. GOd gave to Adam a Law of universal obedience, Genesis 1. 27. Eccl. 7. 29.
written in his Heart, and a particular precept of not eating the Fruit of the
tree of knowledge of good and evil; by which he bound him, and all his
posterity to personal entire exact and perpetual Romans 10 5.
obedience; promised life upon the fulfilling, and Gal. 3. 10. 12,
threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability
to keep it.

2. The same Law that was first written in the heart of man, Romans 2. 14, 15.
continued to be a perfect rule of Righteousness after the fall; and was
delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in Deuteronomy. 10. 4.
Ten Commandments and written in two Tables; the four first containing our duty
toward God, and the other six our duty to man.

3. Besides this Law commonly called moral, God was pleased to give to the
people of Israel Ceremonial Laws, containing several typical ordinances, partly
of worship, Heb. 10. 1. Col. 2. 17.
prefiguring Christ, his graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits; and partly
holding forth diverse instructions 1 Cor. 5 7.
of moral duties, all which Ceremonial Laws being appointed only to the time of
reformation, are by Jesus Christ the true Messiah and only Lawgiver who was
furnished with power from the Father, for that end, Col. 2. 14, 16, 17 Ephesians. 2.
14. 16.
abrogated and taken away.

4. To them also he gave sundry judicial Laws, which expired together with the
state of that people, not obliging any now by virtue of that institution; their
general 1 Cor. 9. 8, 9, 10.
equity only, being of moral use.

5. The moral Law does for eever bind all, Romans 13 8, 9, 10. Jam. 2. 8. 10, 11,
12
as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof, and that not
only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the Jam. 2
10, 11.
authority of God the Creator, who gave it: Neither does Christ in the Gospel
any way dissolve, Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19. Romans 3. 31.
but much strengthen this obligation.

6. Although true Believers be not under the Law, as a Covenant of Works, Romans
6. 14. Gal. 2. 16. Romans 8. 1. cha. 10. 4.
to be thereby Justified or condemned; yet it is of great use to them as well
as to others: in that, as a Rule of Life, informing them of the Will of God,
and their Duty, it directs and binds them, to walk accordingly; Romans 3. 20.
chap. 7. 7. etc.
discovering also the sinful pollutions of their Natures, Hearts and Lives; so
as Examining themselves thereby, they may come to further Conviction of,
Humiliation for, and Hatred against Sin; together with a clearer sight of the
need they have of Christ and the perfection of his Obedience: It is likewise of
use to the Regenerate to restrain their Corruptions, in that it forbids Sin;
and the Threatenings of it serve to show what even their Sins deserve; and what
afflictions in this Life they may expect for them, although freed from the
Curse and unallayed Rigor thereof. The Promises of it likewise show them Gods
approbation of Obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the
performance thereof, though not as due to them by the Law as a Covenant of
Works; so as man's doing Good and refraining from Evil, because the Law
incourageth to the one and deterreth from the other, is no Evidence of his
being Romans 6. 12, 13, 14. 1 Pet. 3. 8.-13.
under the Law and not under Grace.

7. Neither are the forementioned uses of the Law Gal. 3. 21.
contrary to the Grace of the Gospel; but do sweetly comply with it; the Spirit
of Christ subduing Eze. 36. 27.
and inabling the Will of man, to do that freely and cheerfully, which the will
of God revealed in the Law, requires to be done.

CHAP. 20. Of the Gospel, and of the extent of the Grace thereof.
1. THE Covenant of Works being broken by Sin, and made unprofitable unto Life;
God was pleased to give forth the promise of Christ, Genesis 3. 15.
the Seed of the Woman, as the means of calling the Elect, and begetting in
them Faith and Repentance; in this Promise, the Rev. 13. 8.
Gospel, as to the substance of it, was revealed, and therein Effectual, for
the Conversion and Salvation of Sinners.

2. This Promise of Christ, and Salvation by him, is revealed only by Romans 1.
17.
the Word of God; neither do the Works of Creation, or Providence, with the
light of Nature, To. 10. 14, 15, 17.
make discovery of Christ, or of Grace by him; so much as in a general, or
obscure way; much less that men destitute of the Revelation of him by the
Promise, or Gospel.; Pro. 29. 18. Isa. 25. 7. with chapter 60. 2, 3.
should be enabled thereby, to attain saving Faith, or Repentance.

3. The Revelation of the Gospel unto Sinners, made in diverse times, and by
sundry parts; with the addition of Promises, and Precepts for the Obedience
required therein, as to the Nations, and Persons, to whom it is granted, is
merely of the Ps. 147, 20. Act. 16. 7.
Sovereign Will and good Pleasure of God; not being annexed by virtue of any
Promise, to the due improvement of men's natural abilities, by virtue of Common
light received, without it; which none ever did Romans 1. 18, etc.
make, or can so do: And therefore in all Ages the preaching of the Gospel has
been granted unto persons and Nations, as to the extent, or streightning of it,
in great variety, according to the Council of the Will of God.

4. Although the Gospel be the only outward means, of revealing Christ, and
saving Grace; and is, as such, abundantly sufficient thereunto; yet that men
who are dead in Trespasses, may be born again, Quickened or Regenerated; there
is moreover necessary, an effectual, insuperable Ps. 110. 3. 1 Cor. 2. 14. Ephesians.
1. 19 20.
work of the Holy Spirit, upon the whole Soul, for the producing in them a new
spiritual Life; without which no other means will effect Joh. 6. 44. 2 Cor. 4.
4: 6.
their Conversion unto God.

CHAP. XXI. Of Christian Liberty and Liberty of Conscience.
1. THE Liberty which Christ has purchased for Believers under the Gospel,
consists in their freedom from the guilt of Sin, the condemning wrath of God,
the Rigor and Gal. 3. 13.
Curse of the Law; and in their being delivered from this present evil Gal. 1.
4.
World, Bondage to Act. 26. 18.
Satan, and Dominion Romans 8. 3.
of Sin; from the Romans 8. 28.
Evil of Afflictions; the Fear, and Sting 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55, 56, 57.
of Death, the Victory of the Grave, and 2 These. 1. 10.
Everlasting Damnation; as also in their Romans 8. 15.
free access to God; and their yielding Obedience unto him not out of a slavish
fear, Luke ^. 74
but a Child-like love, and willing mind.

All which were common also to Believers under the Law Gal. 3, 9: 14.
for the substance of them; but under the new Testament, the Liberty of
Christians is further enlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the Ceremonial
Law, to which the Jewish Church was subjected; and in greater boldness of
access to the Throne of Grace; and in fuller Communications of the Joh. 7. 38,
39. Heb. 10, 19, 20, 21.
Free Spirit of God, then Believers under the Law did ordinarily partake of.

2. God alone is Jam. 4. 12, Romans 14. 4.
Lord of the Conscience, and has left it free from the Doctrines and
Commandments of men, Act. 4. 19 and 5. 29. 1 Cor. 7. 23. Mat. 15. 9:
which are in any thing contrary to his Word, or not contained in it. So that
to Believe such Doctrines, or obey such Commands out of Conscience, Col: 2. 20
22, 23:
is to betray true liberty of Conscience; and the requiring of an 1 Cor. 3. 5.
2 Cor. 1. 24.
implicit Faith, and absolute and blind Obedience, is to destroy Liberty of
Conscience, and Reason also.

3. They who upon pretense of Christian Liberty do practice any sin, or cherish
any sinful lust; as they do thereby pervert the main design of the Grace of
the Gospel, Romans 6. 1, 2.
to their own Destruction; so they wholly destroy Gal. 5. 13. 2 Pet. 2. 18.-21.
the end of Christian Liberty, which is, that being delivered out of the hands
of all our Enemies we might serve the Lord without fear in Holiness, and
Righteousness before him, all the days of our Life.

CHAP. XXII. Of Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day.
1. THE light of Nature shows that there is a God, who has Lordship, and
Soveraigntye over all; is just, good, and does good unto all; and is therefore
to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and served, with all the
Heart, and all the Soul, Jer. 10. 7. Mar. 12. 33.
and with all the Might. But the acceptable way of Worshipping the true God, is
Deuteronomy. 12 32.
instituted by himself; and so limited by his own revealed will, that he may
not be Worshipped according to the imaginations, and devices of Men, or the
suggestions of Satan, under any visible representations, or Exo 20. 4, 5, 6.
any other way, not prescribed in the Holy Scriptures.

2. Religious Worship is to be given to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
and to him Mat. 4. 9, 10. Joh 6. 23. Mat. 28. 19.
alone; not to Angels, Saints, or any other Romans 1. 25. Col. 2. 18. Revel. 19.
10.
Creatures; and since the fall, not wihtout a Joh. 14. 6.
Mediator, nor in the Mediation of any other but 1 Timothy 2. 5.
Christ alone.

3. Prayer with thanksgiving, being one special par of natural worship, is by
God required of Psalm. 95. 1-7. Psalm. 65. 2.
all men. But that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the Joh. 14. 13, 14.
Name of the Son, by the help Romans 8. 26.
of the Spirit, according to 1 John 5. 14.
his Will; with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and
perseverance; and when with others, in a 1 Cor. 14. 16, 17.
known tongue.

4. Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all sorts of men living, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. 2 Samuel 7. 29.
or that shall live hereafter; but not 2 Samuel 12. 21, 22. 23.
for the dead, nor for those of whom it may be known that they have sinned 1 John 5. 16.
the sin unto death.

5. The 1 Timothy 4. 13.
reading of the Scriptures, Preaching, and 2 Timothy 4. 2. Luke 8. 18.
hearing the word of God, teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms, Hymns
and Spiritual songs, singing with grace in our Hearts to Col. 3. 16. Ephesians. 5. 19
the Lord; as also the Administration Mat. 28, 19, 20.
of Baptism, and 1 Cor. 11 26.
the Lords Supper are all parts of Religious worship of God, to be performed in
obedience to him, with understanding, faith, reverence, and godly fear;
moreover solemn humiliation Esth. 4. 16. Joel. 2. 12
with fastings; and thanksgiving upon Exo. 15. 1. etc. Ps. 107.
special occasions, ought to be used in an holy and religious manner.

6. Neither Prayer, nor any other part of Religious worship, is now under the
Gospel tied unto, or made more acceptable by, any place in which it is Joh. 4.
21. Mal. 1. 11. 1 Timothy 2. 8.
performed, or toward which it is directed; but God is to be worshipped every
where in Spirit, and in truth; as in Act. 10. 2.
private families Mat. 6. 11. Ps. 55. 17.
daily, and Mat. 6. 6
in secret each one by himself, so more solemnly in the public Assemblies,
which are not carelessely, nor wilfully, to be Heb. 10. 25. Act. 2. 42.
neglected, or forsaken, when God by his word, or providence calls thereunto.

7. As it is of the Law of nature, that in general a proportion of time by Gods
appointment, be set a part for the Worship of God; so by his Word in a
positive-moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all men, in all Ages, he
has particularly appointed one day in seven for a Exo. 20. 8.
Sabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the World to the
Resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and from the resurrection
of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2. Act. 20.
7. Rev. 1. 10.
which is called the Lords day; and is to be continued to the end of the World,
as the Christian Sabbath; the observation of the last day of the week being
abolished.

8. The Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men after a due preparing
of their hearts, and ordering their common affairs aforehand, do not only
observe an holy Isa. 58. 13. Neh 13. 15-23.
rest all the day, from their own works, words, and thoughts, about their
wordly employment, and recreations, but also are taken up the whole time in the
public and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties Mat. 12. 1-13.
of necessity and mercy.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Lawful Oaths and Vows.
1. A lawful Oath is a part of religious worship, Exo. 20 7. Deuteronomy. 10 20. Jer.
4. 2.
wherein the person swearing in Truth, Righteousness, and Judgment, solemnly
calls God to witness what he swears; 2 Cro. 6 22, 23.
and to judge him according to the Truth or falseness thereof.

2. The Name of God only is that by which men ought to swear; and therein it is
to be used, with all Holy Fear and reverence, therefore to swear vainly or
rashly by that glorious, and dreadful name; or to swear at all by any other
thing, is sinful and to be Mat. 5. 34. 37. Jam. 5. 12
abhorred; yet as in matter of weight and moment for confirmation of truth,
Heb. 6. 16. 2 Cor. 1. 23.
and ending all strife, an Oath is warranted by the word of God; so a lawful
Oath being imposed, Neh. 13. 25.
by lawful Authority, in such matters, ought to be taken.

3. Whosoever takes an Oath warranted by the word of God, ought duly to
consider the weightiness of so solemn an act; and therein to avouch nothing,
but what he knows to be the truth; for that by rash, false, and vain Oaths
the Levit. 19. 12. Jer. 23. 10
Lord is provoked, and for them this Land mournes.

4. An Oath is to be taken in the plain, and Ps. 24. 4.
common sense of the words; without equivocation, or mental reservation.

5. A Vow which is not to be made to any Creature, but to God alone, Psalm. 76.
11. Genesis 28. 20, 21 22.
is to be made and performed with all Religious care, and faithfulness: But
Popish Monastical Vows, 1 Cor. 7. 2. 9.
of perpetual single life, professed Ephesians. 4. 28.
poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher
perfection, that they are superstitious, Mat. 19. 11.
and sinful snares, in which no Christian may entangle himself.

CHAP. XXIV. Of the Civil Magistrate.
1. GOd the supreme Lord, and King of all the World, has ordained Civil Romans
13 1, 2, 3, 4.
Magistrates to be under him, over the people for his own glory, and the
public good; and to this end has armed them with the power of the Sword, for
defense and encouragement of them that do good, and for the punishment of evil
doers.

2. It is lawful for Christians to Accept, and Execute the Office of a
Magistrate, when called thereunto; in the management whereof, as they ought
especially to maintain 2 Samuel 23. 3. Ps. 82. 3, 4.
Justice, and Peace, according to the wholesome Laws of each Kingdom, and
Commonwealth: so for that end they may lawfully now under the New Testament
Luke 3. 14.
wage war upon just and necessary occasions.

3. Civil Magistrates being set up by God, for the ends aforesaid; subjection
in all lawful things commanded by them, ought to be yielded by us, in the Lord;
not only for wrath Romans 13. 5, 6, 7. 1 Pet. 2. 17.
but for Conscience sake; and we ought to make supplications and prayers for
Kings, and all that are in Authority, 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2
that under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and
honesty.

CHAP. XXV. Of Marriage.
1. MArriage is to be between one Man and one Woman; Genesis 2. 24. Mal. 2 15.
Mat. 19. 5, 6.
neither is it lawful for any man to have more then one Wife, nor for any Woman
to have more then one Husband at the same time.

2. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help Genesis 2. 18.
of Husband and Wife, Gen 1. 28.
for the increase of Mankind, with a legitimate issue, and for 1 Cor. 7 2, 9.
preventing of uncleanness.

3. It is lawful for Heb. 13, 4. 1 Timothy 4, 3.
all sorts of people to Marry, who are able with judgment to give their
consent; yet it is the duty of Christians 1 Cor. 7. 39.
to marry in the Lord, and therefore such as profess the true Religion, should
not Marry with Infidels, Neh. 13 25, 26, 27.
or Idolaters; neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked, by marrying
with such as are wicked, in their life, or maintain damnable Heresy.

4. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity, Levit. 18.
or Affinity forbidden in the word; nor can such incestuous Marriage ever be
made lawful, by any law of Man or consent of parties, Mat. 6. 18. 1 Cor. 5. 1.
so as those persons may live together as Man and Wife.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Church.
1. THe Catholic or universal Church, which (with respect to the internal work
of the Spirit, and truth of grace) may be called invisible, consists of the
whole Heb. 12. 23. Col. 1. 18. Ephesians. 1. 10, 22. 23. and chapter 5. 23, 27, 32.
number of the Elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under
Christ the head thereof; and is the spouse, the body, the fullness of him that
fills all in all.

2. All persons throughout the world, professing the faith of the Gospel, and
obedience unto God by Christ, according unto it; not destroying their own
profession by any Errors everting the foundation, or unholyness of
conversation, 1 Cor. 1 2. Act. 11. 26.
are and may be called visible Saints; Romans 1. 7. Ephesians. 1. 20, 21, 22.
and of such ought all particular Congregations to be constituted.

3. The purest Churches under heaven are subject 1 Cor. 15. Rev. 2. and chapter 3.
to mixture, and error; and some have so degenerated as to become Rev. 18. 2. 2
These. 2. 11, 12.
no Churches of Christ, but Synagogues of Satan; nevertheless Christ always
has had, and ever shall have a Mat. 16. 18. Ps. 72. 17. and Ps. 102. 28. Rev.
12. 17.
Kingdom in this world, to the end thereof, of such as believe in him, and
make profession of his Name.

4. The Lord Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, in whom by the appointment
of the Father, Col. 1. 18. Mat. 28. 18, 19. 20. Ephesians. 4. 11, 12.
all power for the calling, institution, order, or Government of the Church, is
invested in a supreme and sovereign manner, neither can the Pope of Rome in
any sense be head thereof, but is 2 These. 2. 3-9.
that Antichrist, that Man of sin, and Son of perdition, that exalts himself
in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God; whom the Lord shall
destroy with the brightness of his coming.

5. In the execution of this power wherewith he is so entrusted, the Lord Jesus
calls out of the World unto himself, through the Ministry of his word, by his
Spirit, Joh 10. 16. chap. 12, 32.
those that are given unto him by his Father; that they may walk before him in
all the Mat. 28. 20.
ways of obedience, which he prescribes to them in his Word. Those thus called
he commands to walk together in particular societies, or Mat. 18. 15-20.
Churches, for their mutual edification; and the due performance of that
public worship, which he requires of them in the World.

6. The Members of these Churches are Romans 1. 7. 1 Cor. 1. 2.
Saints by calling, visibly manifesting and evidencing (in and by their
profession and walking) their obedience unto that call of Christ; and do
willingly consent to walk together according to the appointment of Christ,
giving up themselves, to the Lord and one to another by the will of God, Act.
2. 41, 42. chapter 5. 13. 14. 2 Cor. 9. 13.
in professed subjection to the Ordinances of the Gospel.

7. To each of these Churches thus gathered, according to his mind, declared in
his word, he has given all that Mat. 18. 17, 18. 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. with v. 13. 2
Cor. 2. 6, 7, 8.
power and authority, which is any way needful, for their carrying on that
order in worship, and discipline, which he has instituted for them to observe;
with commands, and rules, for the due and right exerting, and executing of that
power.

8. A particular Church gathered, and completely Organized, according to the
mind of Christ, consists of Officers, and Members; And the Officers appointed
by Christ to be chosen and set apart by the Church (so called and gathered) for
the peculiar Administration of Ordinances, and Execution of Power, or Duty,
which he intrusts them with, or calls them to, to be continued to the end of
the World are ( p) Bishops or Elders r Act. 20: 17, with v. 28. Phil. 1. 1.
and Deacons.

9. The way appointed by Christ for the Calling of any person, fitted, and
gifted by the Holy Spirit, unto the Office of Bishop, or Elder, in a Church,
is, that he be chosen thereunto by the common Act. 14: 23. See the original.
suffrage of the Church it self; and Solemnly set apart by Fasting and Prayer,
with imposition of hands of the 1 Timothy 4. 14.
Eldership of the Church, if there be any before Constituted therein; And of a
Deacon Act. 6. 3. 5. 6.
that he be chosen by the like suffrage, and set apart by Prayer, and the like
Imposition of hands.

10. The work of Pastors being constantly to attend the Service of Christ, in
his Churches, in the Ministry of the Word, and Prayer, Act. 6. 4. Heb. 13. 17.
with watching for their Souls, as they that must give an account to him; it is
incumbent on the Churches to whom they Minister, not only to give them all due
respect, 1 Timothy 5. 17, 18. Gal. 6. 6, 7.
but also to communicate to them of all their good things according to their
ability, so as they may have a comfortable supply, without being themselves 2 Timothy 2. 4.
entangled in Secular Affairs; and may also be capable of exercising 1 Timothy 3.
2.
Hospitality toward others; and this is required by the 1 Cor. 9. 6.-14.
Law of Nature, and by the Express order of our Lord Jesus, who has ordained
that they that preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.

11. Although it be incumbent on the Bishops or Pastors of the Churches to be
instant in Preaching the Word, by way of Office; yet the work of Preaching the
Word, is not so peculiarly confined to them; but that others also Act. 11. 19,
20, 21. 1 Pet. 4. 10. 11.
gifted, and fitted by the Holy Spirit for it, and approved, and called by the
Church, may and ought to perform it.

12. As all Believers are bound to join themselves to particular Churches, when
and where they have opportunity so to do; So all that are admitted unto the
privileges of a Church, are also 1 These. 5. 14. 2 These 3. 6. 14, 15.
under the Censures and Government thereof, according to the Rule of Christ.

13. No Church Members upon any offense taken by them, having performed their
Duty required of them toward the person they are offended at, ought to disturb
any Church order, or absent themselves from the Assemblies of the Church, or
Administration of any Ordinances, upon the account of such offense at any of
their fellowmembers; but to wait upon Christ, Mat. 18. 15. 16, 17. Ephesians. 4. 2, 3.
in the further proceeding of the Church.

14. As each Church, and all the Members of it are bound to Ephesians. 6. 18. Ps.
122. 6.
pray continually, for the good and prosperity of all the Churches of Christ,
in all places; and upon all occasions to further it (every one within the
bounds of their places, and callings, in the Exercise of their Gifts and
Graces) so the Churches (when planted by the providence of God so as they may
enjoy opportunity and advantage for it) ought to hold Romans 16. 1, 2. 3 John 8,
9, 10.
communion amongst themselves for their peace, increase of love, and mutual
edification.

15. In cases of difficulties or differences, either in point of Doctrine, or
Administration; wherein either the Churches in general are concerned, or any
one Church in their peace, union, and edification; or any member, or members,
of any Church are injured, in or by any proceedings in censures not agreeable
to truth, and order: it is according to the mind of Christ, that many Churches
holding communion together, do by their messengers meet to consider, Act. 15.
2, 4, 6. and 22, 23. 25.
and give their advice, in or about that matter in difference, to be reported
to all the Churches concerned; howbeit these messengers assembled are not
entrusted with any Church Power properly so called; or with any jurisdiction
over the Churches themselves, to exercise any censures either over any
Churches, or Persons: or 2 Cor. 1. 24. 1 John 4. 1
to impose their determination on the Churches, or Officers.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the Communion of Saints.
1. ALL Saints that are united to Jesus Christ their Head, by his Spirit, and
Faith; although they are not made thereby one person with him, have 1 John 1.
3. Joh. 1. 16. Phil. 3 10 Kom. 6. 5 6.
fellowship in his Graces, sufferings, death, resurrection, and glory; and
being united to one another in love, they Ephesians. 4. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 12. 7. 1 Cor.
3 21, 22, 23.
have communion in each others gifts, and graces; and are obliged to the
performance of such duties, public and private, in an orderly way, 1 These. 5.
11. 14. Romans 1. 12. 1 John 3. 17. 18. Gal 6. 10.
as do conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward man.

2. Saints by profession are bound to maintain an holy fellowship and communion
in the worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services, Heb. 10
24, 25. with chapter 3. 12, 13.
as tend to their mutual edification; as also in relieving each other in Act.
12. 29. 30.
outward things according to their several abilities, and necessities; which
communion according to the rule of the Gospel, though especially to be
exercised by them, in the relations wherein they stand, whether in Ephesians. 6. 4.
families, or 1 Cor. 12. 14. -27.
Churches; yet as God offers opportunity is to be extended to all the
household of faith, even all those who in every place call upon the names of the
Lord Jesus; nevertheless their communion one with another as Saints, does not
take away or Act. 5. 4 Ephesians. 4. 28
infringe, the title or propriety, which each man has in his goods and
possessions.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Baptism and the Lords Supper.
1. BAptism and the Lords Supper are ordinances of positive, and sovereign
institution; appointed by the Lord Jesus the only Lawgiver, to be continued in
his Church Mat. 28 19, 20. 1 Cor. 11. 26.
to the end of the world.

2, These holy appointments are to be administed by those only, who are
qualified and thereunto called according Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 4. 1.
to the commission of Christ.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Baptism.
1. BAptism is an Ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, to
be unto the party Baptized, a sign of his fellowship with him, in his death,
Romans 6. 3. 4, 5. Col. 2. 12. Gal. 3. 27.
and resurrection; of his being engrafted into him; of Mar. 1. 4. Act. 26. 16.
remission of sins; and of his Rom, 6. 2, 4.
giving up unto God through Jesus Christ to live and walk in newness of Life.

2. Those who do actually profess Mar. 16. 16. Act. 8. 36, 37
repentance toward God, faith in, and obedience, to our Lord Jesus, are the
only proper subjects of this ordinance.

3. The outward element to be used in this ordinance Mat 28. 19, 20. with Act.
8. 38.
is water, wherein the party is to be baptized, in the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

4. Immersion, or dipping of the person Mat. 3. 16. Joh. 3 23.
in water, is necessary to the due administration of this ordinance.

CHAP. XXX. Of the Lords Supper.
1. THE Supper of the Lord Jesus, was instituted by him, the same night wherein
he was betrayed, to be observed in his Churches unto the end of the world, for
the perpetual remembrance, and showing forth the sacrifice of himself in his
death 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24. 25, 26.
confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their
spiritual nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to,
all duties which they owe unto him; 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17. 21.
and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.

2. In this ordinance Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real
sacrifice made at all, for remission of sin of the quick or dead; but only a
memorial of that Heb. 9. 25, 26. 28.
one offering up of himself, by himself, upon the cross, once for all; and a
spiritual oblation of all 1 Cor. 11. 24. Mat. 26. 26, 27.
possible praise unto God for the same; so that the Popish sacrifice of the
Mass (as they call it) is most abominable, injurious to Christ's own only
sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of the Elect.

3. The Lord Jesus has in this Ordinance, appointed his Ministers to Pray, and
bless the Elements of Bread and Wine, and thereby to set them apart from a
common to an holy use, and to take and break the Bread; to take the Cup, 1 Cor.
11. 23, 24, 25, 26, etc
and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the Communicants.

4. The denial of the Cup to the people, worshipping the Elements, the lifting
them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and reserving them for any
pretended religious use, Mat 26. 26, 27, 28. Mat. 15. 9. Exodus 20. 4, 5.
are all contrary to the nature of this Ordinance, and to the institution of
Christ.

5. The outward Elements in this Ordinance, duly set apart to the uses
ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly,
although in terms used figuratively, they are sometimes called by the name of
the things they represent, to wit the 1 Cor. 11. 27.
body and Blood of Christ; albeit in substance, and nature, they still remain
truly, and only 1 Cor. 11. 26. and v. 28.
Bread, and Wine, as they were before.

6. That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of Bread and Wine,
into the substance of Christ's body and blood (commonly called
Transubstantiation) by consecration of a Priest, or by any other way, is
repugnant not to Scripture Act. 3. 21. Luke 24. 6. and v. 39.
alone, but even to common sense and reason; overthrows the 1 Cor. 11. 24, 25.
nature of the ordinance, and has been and is the cause of manifold
superstitions, yea, of gross Idolatries.

7. Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible Elements in this
Ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally,
and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified 1 Cor.
10. 16. chapter 11. 23- 26.
and all the benefits of his death: the Body and Blood of Christ, being then
not corporally, or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of Believers,
in that Ordinance, as the Elements themselves are to their outward senses.

8. All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion 2
Cor: 6, 14, 15.
with Christ; so are they unworthy of the Lords Table; and cannot without great
sin against him, while they remain such, partake of these holy mysteries, 1
Cor. 11. 29. Mat. 7. 6.
or be admitted thereunto: yea whosoever shall receive unworthily are guilty of
the Body and Blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to themselves.

CHAP. XXXI. Of the State of Man after Death and of the Resurrection of the
Dead.
1. THE Bodies of Men after Death return to dust, Genesis 3. 19. Act. 13. 36.
and see corruption; but their Souls (which neither die nor sleep) having an
immortal subsistence, immediately Eccles. 12. 7.
return to God who gave them: the Souls of the Righteous being then made
perfect in holiness, are received into paradise where they are with Christ, and
behold the face of God, in light Luke 23. 43. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 6, 8. Phil. 1. 23
Heb. 12. 23.
and glory; waiting for the full Redemption of their Bodies; and the souls of
the wicked, are cast into hell; where they remain in torment and utter
darkness, reserved to Jud. 6 7. 1 Pet. 3. 19. Luke 16. 23, 24.
the judgment of the great day; besides these two places for Souls separated
from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledges none.

2. At the last day such of the Saints as are found alive shall not sleep but
be 1 Cor. 15. 51, 52. 1 These. 4. 17.
changed; and all the dead shall be raised up with the self same bodies, and
Job 19. 26, 27.
none other; although with different 1 Cor. 15. 42, 43.
qualities, which shall be united again to their Souls for ever.

3. The bodies of the unjust shall by the power of Christ, be raised to
dishonor; the bodies of the just by his spirit unto honor, Act. 24. 15. Joh.
5. 28, 29. Phil. 3. 21
and be made conformable to his own glorious Body.

CHAP. XXXII. Of the Last Judgment.
1. GOD has appointed a Day wherein he will judge the world in Righteousness,
by Act. 17. 31. Joh. 5. 22. 27.
Jesus Christ; to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father; in which
Day not only the 1 Cor. 6 3. Jud. 6.
Apostate Angels shall be judged; but likewise all persons that have lived upon
the Earth, shall appear before the Tribunal of Christ; 2 Cor. 5. 10. Eccles. 12
14. Mat. 12. 36. Romans 14. 10. 12. Mat. 25. 32. etc.
to give an account of their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds, and to receive
according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.

2. The end of Gods appointing this Day, is for the manifestation of the glory
of his Mercy, in the Eternal Salvation of the Elect; Rom, 9. 22, 23.
and of his Justice in the Eternal damnation of the Reprobate, who are wicked
and disobedient; for then shall the Righteous go into Everlasting Life, and
receive that fullness of Joy, and Glory with everlasting reward, in the presence
Mat. 25. 21. 34. 2 Timothy 4. 8.
of the Lord: but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus
Christ, shall be cast into Eternal torments, and Mat. 25. 46. Mar. 9. 48. 2
These. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.
punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from
the glory of his power.

3. As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a Day
of judgment, both 2 Cor. 5. 10, 11.
to deter all men from sin, and for the greater 2 These. 1. 5, 6, 7.
consolation of the godly, in their adversity; so will he have that day unknown
to Men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful,
because they know not at what hour, the Mar. 13. 35, 36, 37 Luke 13. 35, 36.
Lord will come; and may ever be prepared to say, Rev. 22 20.
Come Lord Jesus, Come quickly, Amen.

AN APPENDIX.
WHosoever reads, and impartially considers what we have in our forgoing
confession declared, may readily perceive, That we do not only concenter with
all other true Christians on the Word of God (revealed in the Scriptures of
truth) as the foundation and rule of our faith and worship. But that we have
also industriously endeavored to manifest, That in the fundamental Articles of
Christianity we mind the same things, and have therefore expressed our belief
in the same words, that have on the like occasion been spoken by other
societies of Christians before us.

This we have done, That those who are desirous to know the principles of
Religion which we hold and practice, may take an estimate from our selves (who
jointly concur in this work) and may not be misguided, either by undue reports;
or by the ignorance or errors of particular persons, who going under the same
name with our selves, may give an occasion of scandalizing the truth we profess.

And although we do differ from our brethren who are Paedobaptists; in the
subject and administration of Baptism, and such other circumstances as have a
necessary dependence on our observance of that Ordinance, and do frequent our
own assemblies for our mutual edification, and discharge of those duties, and
services which we owe unto God, and in his fear to each other: yet we would not
be from hence misconstrued, as if the discharge of our own consciences herein,
did any ways disoblige or alienate our affections, or conversation from any
others that fear the Lord; but that we may and do as we have opportunity
participate of the labors of those, whom God has endued with abilities above
our selves, and qualified, and called to the Ministry of the Word, earnestly
desiring to approve our selves to be such, as follow after peace with holiness,
and therefore we always keep that blessed Irenicum, or healing Word of the
Apostle before our eyes; if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall
reveal even this unto you; nevertheless whereto we have already attained; let
us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing, Phil. 3. v. 15, 16.

Let it not therefore be judged of us (because much has been written on this
subject, and yet we continue this our practice different from others) that it
is out of obstinacy, but rather as the truth is, that we do herein according to
the best of our understandings worship God, out of a pure mind yielding
obedience to his precept, in that method which we take to be most agreeable to
the Scriptures of truth, and primitive practice.

It would not become us to give any such intimation, as should carry a
semblance that what we do in the service of God is with a doubting conscience,
or with any such temper of mind that we do thus for the present, with a
reservation that we will do otherwise hereafter upon more mature deliberation;
nor have we any cause so to do, being fully persuaded, that what we do is
agreeable to the will of God. Yet we do heartily propose this, that if any of
the Servants of our Lord Jesus shall, in the Spirit of meekness, attempt to
convince us of any mistake either in judgment or practice, we shall diligently
ponder his arguments; and account him our chiefest friend that shall be an
instrument to convert us from any error that is in our ways, for we cannot
wittingly do any thing against the truth, but all things for the truth.

And therefore we have endeavored seriously to consider, what has been
already offered for our satisfaction in this point; and are loath to say any
more lest we should be esteemed desirous of renewed contests thereabout: yet
forasmuch as it may justly be expected that we show some reason, why we cannot
acquiesce in what has been urged against us; we shall with as much brevity as
may consist with plainness, endeavor to satisfy the expectation of those that
shall peruse what we now publish in this matter also.

1. As to those Christians who consent with us, That Repentance from dead
works, and Faith toward God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, is required in persons
to be Baptized; and do therefore supply the defect of the (infant being
incapable of making confession of either) by others who do undertake these
things for it. Although we do find by Church history that this has been a very
ancient practice; Romans 14. 4. 10. 12. 23.
yet considering, that the same Scripture which does caution us against
censuring our brother, with whom we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
Christ, does also instruct us, That every one of us shall give an account of
himself to God, and whatsoever is not of Faith is sin. Therefore we cannot for
our own parts be persuaded in our own minds, to build such a practice as this,
upon an unwritten tradition: But do rather choose in all points of Faith and
Worship, to have recourse to the holy Scriptures, for the information of our
judgment, and regulation of our practice; being well assured that a
conscientious attending thereto, is the best way to prevent, and rectify our
defects and errors. 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17. And if any such case happen to be debated
between Christians, which is not plainly determinable by the Scriptures, we
think it safest to leave such things undecided until the second coming of our
Lord Jesus; as they did in the Church of old, until there should arise a Priest
with Vrim and Thummim, that might certainly inform them of the mind of God
thereabout, Ezra 2. 62, 63.

2. As for those our Christian brethren who do ground their arguments for
Infants baptism, upon a presumed foederal Holiness, or Church Membership, we
conceive they are deficient in this, that albeit this Covenant-Holiness and
Membership should be as is supposed, in reference unto the Infants of
Believers; yet no command for Infant baptism does immediately and directly
result from such a quality, or relation.

All instituted Worship receives its sanction from the precept, and is to be
thereby governed in all the necessary circumstances thereof.

So it was in the Covenant that God made with Abraham and his Seed. The sign
whereof was appropriated only to the Male, notwithstanding that the female seed
as well as the Male were comprehended in the Covenant and part of the Church of
God; neither was this sign to be affixed to any Male Infant till he was eight
days old, albeit he was within the Covenant from the first moment of his life;
nor could the danger of death, or any other supposed necessity, warrant the
circumcising of him before the set time, nor was there any cause for it; the
commination of being cut off from his people, being only upon the neglect, or
contempt of the precept.

Righteous Lot was nearly related to Aqraham in the flesh, and contemporary
with him, when this Covenant was made; yet inasmuch as he did not descend from
his loins, nor was of his household family (although he was of the same
household of faith with Abraham) yet neither Lot himself nor any of his
posterity (because of their descent from him) were signed with the signature of
this Covenant that was made with Abraham and his seed.

This may suffice to show, that where there was both an express Covenant, and
a sign thereof (such a Covenant as did separate the persons with whom it was
made, and all their offspring from all the rest of the world, as a people holy
unto the Lord, and did constitute them the visible Church of God, (though not
comprehensive of all the faithful in the world) yet the sign of this Covenant
was not affixed to all the persons that were within this Covenant, nor to any
of them till the prefixed season; nor to other faithful servants of God, that
were not of descent from Abraham. And consequently that it depends purely upon
the will of the Lawgiver, to determine what shall be the sign of his Covenant,
unto whom, at what season, and upon what terms, it shall be affixed.

If our brethren do suppose baptism to be the seal of the Covenant which God
makes with every beleiver (of which the Scriptures are altogether silent) it is
not our concern to contend with them herein; yet we conceive the seal of that
Covenant is the indwelling of the Spirit of Christ in the particular and
individual persons in whom he resides, and nothing else, neither do they or we
suppose that baptism is in any such manner substituted in the place of
circumcision, as to have the same (and no other) latitude, extent, or terms,
then circumcision had; for that was suited only for the Male children, baptism
is an ordinance suited for every beleiver, whether male, or femal. That
extended to all the maies that were born in Abraham's house, or bought with his
money, equally with the males that proceeded from his own loins; but baptism
is not so far extended in any true Christian Church that we know of, as to be
administered to all the poor infidel servants, that the members thereof purchase
for their service, and introduce into their families; nor to the children born
of them in their house.

But we conceive the same parity of reasoning may hold for the ordinance of
baptism as for that of circumcision; Exodus 12. 49. viz. one law for the
stranger, as for the home born: If any desire to be admitted to all the
ordinances, and privileges of Gods house, the door is open; upon the same
terms that any one person was ever admitted to all, or any of those
privileges, that belong to the Christian Church; may all persons of right
challenge the like admission.

As for that text of Scripture, Romans 4. 11. He received circumcision a seal of
the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised; we
conceive if the Apostles scope in that place be duly attended to, it will
appear that no argument can be taken from thence to enforce Infant baptism; and
forasmuch as we find a full and fair account of those words given by the
learned Dr. Lightfoot (a man not to be suspected of partiality in this
controversy) in his Hor. Hebrai, on the 1 Cor. 7. 19. p. 42, 43. we shall
transcribe his words at large, without any comment of our own upon them.

Circumcisio nihil est ratione habit a temporis, jam enim evanuerat, adimpleto
praecipue ejus fine ob quem fuer at instituta; Istum finem exhibet Apostolus in
verbis istis Romans 4. 11. (...). At vereor ne a plerisque versionibus non satis
aptentur ad finem circumcisionis, and scopum Apostoli, dum ab iis interseritur
aliquid de suo.

Circumcision is nothing, if we respect the time, for now it was without use,
that end of it being especially fulfilled; for which it had been instituted:
this end the Apostle declares in these words, Romans 4. 11. (...), etc. But I
fear that by most translations they are not sufficiently suited to the end of
circumcision and the scope of the Apostle whilst something of their own is by
them inserted.

And after the Doctor has represented diverse versions of the words agreeing
for the most part in sense with that which we have in our Bibles he thus
proceeds. Aliae in eundem sensum, ac si circumcisio daretur Abrahamo in
sigillum justitiae istius, quam ille habuit, dum adhuc foret praeputiatus; quod
non negabimus aliqualiter verum esse, at credimus circumcisionem long alio
praecipue respexisse.

Other versions are to the same purpose; as if circumcision was given to
Abraham for a Seal of that Righteousness which he had being yet uncircumcised,
which we will not deny to be in some sense true, but we believe that
circumcision had chiefly a far different respect.

Liceat mihi verba sic reddere. Et signum accepit circumcisionis, sigillum
justitiae fidei, quae futura in praeputio; quae futura dico, non quae fuerat.
Non quae fuerat Abrahamo adhuc praeputiato, sed quae futura semini ejus
praeputiato, id est, gentilibus, fidem olim Abrahami imitaturis.

Give me leave thus to render the words; And he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the Righteousness of Faith, which was to be in the
uncircumcision, Which was to be (I say) not which had been, not that which
Abraham had whilst he was yet uncircumcised; but that which his uncircumcised
seed should have, that is the Gentiles, who in time to come should imitate the
faith of Abraham.

Nunc adverte been qua occasion instituta Abrahamo circumcisio, ponens tibi
ante oculos historiam ejus, Genesis 17.

Now consider well on what occasion circumcision was instituted unto Abraham,
setting before thine eyes the history thereof, Genesis 17. Fit primo ei haec
promissio, Multarum Gentium eris tu pater ( quonam sensu explicat Apostolus,
isto capite) and subinde subjungitur duplex sigillum rei corroborandae;
immutatioscilicet nominis Abrami in Abrahamum; and institutio circumcisionis:
v. 4. Ecce mihi tecum est foedus, eris tu pater multarum gentium. Quare vocatum
est nomen ejus Abrahamus? In sigillationem hujus promissionis. Tu Pater eris
multarum gentium. Et quare instituta ei circumcisio? In sigillationem ejusdem
promissionis. Tu Pater eris multarum Gentium. It a ut hic sit sensus Apostoli,
institutioni circumcisionis congruentissimus; accepit signum circumcisionis,
sigillum justitiae fidei, quam olim erat incircumcisio (vel Gentiles) habitura
and adeptura.

This promise is first made unto him, Thou shall be the Father of many Nations
(in what sense the Apostle explaineth in that chapter) and then there is
subjoined a double seal for the confirmation of the thing, to wit, the change
of the name Abram into Abraham, and the institution of circumcision. v. 4.
Behold as for me, my Covenant is withthee, and thou shall be the Father of many
Nations. Wherefore was his name called Abraham? for the sealing of this
promise: Thou shall be the Father of many Nations And wherefore was
circumcision instituted to him? For the sealing of the same promise. Thou shall
be the Father of many Nations. So that this is the sense of the Apostle, most
agreeable to the institution of circumcision; he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the Righteousness of Faith which in time to come the
uncircumcision (or the Gentiles) should have and obtain.

Duplex semen er at Abrahamo; natural, Judaeorum; and fidele gentilium
credentium: signatur natural signo circumcisionis, primo quidem in sui
distinctionem, ab omnibus aliis gentibus, dum eae non adhuc forent semen
Abrahami; at praecipue in memoriam justificationis gentium per fidem, cum
tandem forent ejus semen. Cessatura ergo merito erat circumcisio, cum
introducerentur Gentiles ad fidem, quippe quod tunc finem suum ultimum ac
praecipuum obtinuer at, et perinde (...).

Abraham had a twofold seed, natural, of the Jews; and faithful, of the
believing Gentiles: his natural seed was signed with the sign of circumcision,
first indeed for the distinguishing of them from all other Nations whilst they
as yet were not the seed of Abraham, but especially for the memorial of the
justification of the Gentiles by faith, when at length they should become his
seed. Therefore circumcision was of right to cease, when the Gentiles were
brought in to the faith, forasmuch as then it had obtained its last and chief
end, and thenceforth circumcision is nothing.



Thus far he, which we earnestly desire may be seriously weighed, for we plead
not his authority, but the evidence of truth in his words.

3. Of whatsoever nature the holiness of the children mentioned, 1 Cor. 7. 12.
be, yet they who do conclude that all such children (whether Infants or of
riper years) have from hence an immediate right to baptism, do as we conceive
put more into the conclusion, then will be found in the premises.

For although we do not determine positively concerning the Apostles scope in
the holiness here mentioned, so as to say it is this, or that, and no other
thing; Yet it is evident that the Apostle does by it determine not only the
lawfulness but the expedience also of a beleivers cohabitation with an
unbeliever, in the state of marriage.

And we do think that although the Apostles asserting of the unbelieving
yokefellow to be sanctified by the believer, should carry in it somewhat more
then is in the bare marriage of two infidels, because although the marriage
covenant have a divine sanction so as to make the wedlock of two unbelievers a
lawful action, and their conjunction and cohabitation in that respect
undefiled, yet there might be no ground to suppose from thence, that both or
either of their persons are thereby sanctified; and the Apostle urges the
cohabitation of a believer with an infidel in the state of wedlock from this
ground that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife;
nevertheless here you have the influence of a believers faith ascending from an
inferior to a superior relation; from the wife to the husband who is her head,
before it can descend to their offspring. And therefore we say, whatever be
the nature or extent of the holiness here intended, we conceive it cannot
convey to the children an immediate right to baptism; because it would then be
of another nature, and of a larger extent, then the root, and original from
whence it is derived; for it is clear by the Apostles argument that holiness
cannot be derived to the child from the sanctity of one parent only, if either
father or mother be (in the sense intended by the Apostle) unholy or unclean,
so will the child be also, therefore for the production of an holy seed it is
necessary that both the Parents be sanctified; and this the Apostle positively
asserts in the first place to be done by the beleiving parent, although the
other be an unbeliever; and then consequentially from thence argues, the
holiness of their children. Hence it follows, that as the children have no
other holiness then what they derive from both their Parents; so neither can
they have any right by this holiness to any spiritual privilege but such as
both their Parents did also partake of: and therefore if the unbelieving Parent
(though sanctified by the believing Parent) have not thereby a a right to
baptism, neither can we concieve, that there is any such privilege, derived to
the children by their birth-holiness.

Besides if it had been the usual practice in the Apostles days for the father
or mother that did believe, to bring all their children with them to be
baptized; then the holiness of the beleiving Corinthians children, would not at
all have been in question when this Epistle was written; but might have been
argued from their passing under that ordinance, which represented their new
birth, although they had derived no holiness from their Parents, by their first
birth; and would have layen as an exception against the Apostles inference,
else were your Children unclean, etc. But of the sanctification of all the
children of every beleiver by this ordinance, or any other way, then what is
beforementioned, the Scripture is altogether silent.

This may be also added; that if this birth holiness do qualify all the
children of every believer, for the ordinance of baptism; why not for all other
ordinances? for the Lords Supper as was practiced for a long time together? for
if recourse be had to what the Scriptures speak generally of this subject; it
will be found, that the same qualities which do entitle any person to baptism,
do so also for the participation of all the Ordinances, and privileges of the
house of God, that are common to all believers.

Whosoever can and does interrogate his good Conscience toward God when he is
baptized (as every one must do that makes it to himself a sign of Salvation) is
capable of doing the same thing, in every other act of worship that he performs.

4. The arguments and inferences that are usually brought for, or against
Infant baptism from those few instances which the Scriptures afford us of whole
families being baptized; are only conjectural; and therefore cannot of
themselves, be conclusive on either hand: yet in regard most that treat on this
subject for Infant baptism, do (as they conceive) improve these instances to
the advantage of their argument: we think it meet (in like manner as in the
cases before mentioned so in this) to show the invalidity of such inferences.

Cornelius worshipped God with all his house, the Jailer, and Crispus the chief
ruler of the Synagogue, believed God with each of their houses. The household of
Stephanus addicted themselves to the Ministry of the Saints: so that thus far
Worshipping, and Believing runs parallel with Baptism. And if Lydia, had been a
married person, when she believed, it is probable her husband would also have
been named by the Apostle, as in like cases, inasmuch as he would have been not
only a part, but the head of that baptized household.

Who can assign any probable reason, why the Apostle should make mention of
four or five households being baptized and no more? or why he does so often vary
in the method of his salutations, Romans 1. 6. sometimes mentioning only
particular persons of great note, other times such, and the Church in their
house? the Saints that were with them; and them belonging to Narcissus, who
were in the Lord; thus saluting either whole families, or part of families, or
only particular persons in families, considered as they were in the Lord, for
if it had been an usual practice to baptize all children, with their parents;
there were then many thousands of the Jews which believed, and a great number
of the Gentiles, in most of the principal Cities in the World, and among so
many thousands, it is more then probable there would have been some thousands
of households baptized; why then should the Apostle in this respect signalize
one family of the Jews and three or four of the Gentiles, as particular
instances in a case that was common? whoever supposes that we do wilfully
debar our children, from the benefit of any promise, or privilege, that of
right belongs to the children of believing parents; they do entertain over
severe thoughts of us: to be without natural affections is one of the
characters of the worst of persons, in the worst of times. We do freely
confess our selves guilty before the Lord, in that we have not with more
circumspection and diligence trained up those that relate to us in the fear of
the Lord; and do humbly and earnestly pray, that our omissions herein may be
remitted, and that they may not redound to the prejudice of our selves, or any
of ours: but with respect to that duty that is incumbent on us, we acknowledge
our selves obliged by the precepts of God, to bring up our children in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord, to teach them his fear, both by instruction
and example; and should we set light by this precept, it would demonstrate that
we are more vile then the unnatural Heathen, that like not to retain God in
their knowledge, our baptism might then be justly accounted, as no baptism to
us.

There are many special promises that do encourage us as well as precepts, that
do oblige us to the close pursuit of our duty herein: that God whom we serve,
being jealous of his Worship, threatens the visiting of the Fathers
transgression upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that
hate him: yet does more abundantly extend his mercy, even to thousands
(respecting the offspring and succeding generations) of them that love him, and
keep his commands.

When our Lord rebuked his disciples for prohibiting the access of little
children that were brought to him, that he might pray over them, lay his hands
upon them, and bless them, does declare, that of such is the Kingdom of God.
And the Apostle Peter in answer to their enquiry, that desired to know what
they must do to be saved, does not only instruct them in the necessary duty of
repentance and baptism; but does also thereto encourage them, by that promise
which had reference both to them, and their children; if our Lord Jesus in the
forementioned place, do not respect the qualities of children (as elsewhere) as
to their meekness, humility, and sincerity, and the like; but intend also that
those very persons and such like, appertain to the Kingdom of God, and if the
Apostle Peter in mentioning the aforesaid promise, do respect not only the
present and succeeding generations of those Jews, that heard him, (in which
sense the same phrase does occur in Scripture) but also the immediate
offspring of his auditors; whether the promise relate to the gift of the Holy
Spirit, or of eternal life, or any grace, or privilege tending to the
obtaining thereof; it is neither our concern nor our interest to confine the
mercies, and promises of God, to a more narrow, or less compass then he is
pleased graciously to offer and intend them; nor to have a light esteem of
them; but are obliged in duty to God, and affection to our children; to plead
earnestly with God and use our utmost endeavors that both our selves, and our
offspring may be partakers of his Mercies and gracious Promises: yet we cannot
from either of these texts collect a sufficient warrant for us to baptize our
children before they are instructed in the principles of the Christian Religion.

For as to the instance in little children, it seems by the disciples
forbidding them, that they were brought upon some other account, not so
frequent as Baptism must be supposed to have been, if from the beginning
believers children had been admitted thereto: and no account is given whether
their parents were baptized believers or not; and as to the instance of the
Apostle; if the following words and practice, may be taken as an interpretation
of the scope of that promise we cannot conceive it does refer to infant
baptism, because the text does presently subjoyn; Then they that gladly
received the word were baptized.

That there were some believing children of believing parents in the Apostles
days is evident from the Scriptures, even such as were then in there fathers
family, and under their parents tuition, and education; to whom the Apostle in
several of his Epistles to the Churches, gives commands to obey their parents
in the Lord; and does allure their tender years to hearken to this precept, by
reminding them that it is the first command with promise.

And it is recorded by him for the praise of Timothy, and encouragement of
parents betimes to instaruct, and children early to attend to godly
instruction, that (...) from a child, he had known the holy Scriptures.

The Apostle John rejoiced greatly when he found of the children of the Elect
Lady walking in the truth; and the children of her Elect Sister join with the
Apostle in his salutation.

But that this was not generally so, that all the children of believers were
accounted for believers (as they would have been if they had been all baptized)
may be collected from the character which the Apostle gives of persons fit to
be chosen to Eldership in the Church which was not common to all believers;
among others this is expressly one, viz. If there be any having believing, or
faithful children, not accused of Riot or unruly; and we may from the Apostles
writings on the same subject collect the reason of this qualification, viz.
That in case the person designed for this office to teach and rule in the house
of God, had children capable of it; there might be first a proof of his
ability, industry, and success in this work in his own family; and private
capacity, before he was ordained to the exercise of this authority in the
Church, in a public capacity, as a Bishop in the house of God.

These things we have mentioned as having a direct reference unto the
controversy between our brethren and us; other things that are more abstruse
and prolix, which are frequently introduced into this controversy, but do not
necessarily concern it, we have purposely avoided; that the distance between us
and our brethren may not be by us made more wide; for it is our duty, and
concern so far as is possible for us (retaining a good conscience toward God)
to seek a more entire agreement and reconciliation with them.

We are not insensible that as to the order of Gods house, and entire communion
therein there are some things wherein we (as well as others) are not at a full
accord among our selves, as for instance; the known principle, and state of the
consciences of diverse of us, that have agreed in this Confession is such; that
we cannot hold Church Communion, with any other then Baptized-believers, and
Churches constituted of such; yet some others of us have a greater liberty and
freedom in our spirits that way; and therefore we have purposely omitted the
mention of things of that nature, that we might concur, in giving this
evidence of our agreement, both among our selves, and with other good
Christians, in those important articles of the Christian Religion, mainly
insisted on by us: and this notwithstanding we all esteem it our chief concern,
both among our selves, and all others that in every place call upon the name of
the Lord Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours, and love him in
sincerity, to endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace;
and in order thereunto, to exercise all lowliness and meekness, with
long-suffering, forbearing one another in love.

And we are persuaded if the same method were introduced into frequent practice
between us and our Christian friends who agree with us in all the fundamental
articles of the Christian faith (though they do not so in the subject and
administration of baptism) it would soon beget a better understanding, and
brotherly affection between us.

In the beginning of the Christian Church, when the doctrine of the baptism of
Christ was not universally understood, yet those that knew only the baptism of
John, were the Disciples of the Lord Jesus; and Apollos an eminent Minister of
the Gospel of Jesus.

In the beginning of the reformation of the Christian Church, and recovery from
that Egyptian darkness wherein our forefathers for many generations were held
in bondage; upon recourse had to the Scriptures of truth, different
apprehensions were conceived, which are to this time continued, concerning the
practice of this Ordinance.

Let not our zeal herein be misinterpreted: that God whom we serve is jealous
of his worship. By his gracious providence the Law thereof, is continued
amongst us; and we are forewarned by what happened in the Church of the Jews,
that it is necessary for every generation, and that frequently in every
generation to consult the divine oracle, compare our worship with the rule, and
take heed to what doctrines we receive and practice.

If the ten commands exhibited in the popish Idolatrous service books had been
received as the entire law of God, because they agree in number with his ten
commands, and also in the substance of nine of them; the second Commandment
forbidding Idolatry had been utterly lost.

If Ezra and Nehemiah had not made a diligent search into the particular parts
of Gods law, and his worship; the Feast of Tabernacles (which for many
centuries of years, had not been duly observed, according to the institution,
though it was retained in the general notion) would not have been kept in due
order.

So may it be now as to many things relating to the service of God, which do
retain the names proper to them in their first institution, but yet through
inadvertency (where there is no sinister design) may vary in their
circumstances, from their first institution. And if by means of any ancient
defection, or of that general corruption of the service of God, and
interruption of his true worship, and persecution of his servants by the
Antichristian Bishop of Rome, for many generations; those who do consult the
Word of God, cannot yet arrive at a full and mutual satisfaction among
themselves, what was the practice of the primitive Christian Church, in some
points relating to the Worship of God: yet inasmuch as these things are not of
the essence of Christianity, but that we agree in the fundamental doctrines
thereof, we do apprehend, there is sufficient ground to lay aside all
bitterness and prejudice, and in the spirit of love and meekness to embrace and
own each other therein; leaving each other at liberty to perform such other
services, (wherein we cannot concur) apart unto God, according to the best of
our understanding.

FINIS.
