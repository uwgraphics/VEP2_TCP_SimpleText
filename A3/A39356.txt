A LETTER TO The AUTHOR of a BOOK ENTITLED, Considerations on the Explications
of the Doctrine of the TRINITY.
SIR,
I HAVE a long time Desired to have some Conference with You, or any other of
the Writing Disputants of your Persuasion, but I could never yet obtain that
Satisfaction. I shall here Reflect upon Two Passages in the Letter Annexed to
your Con^^rations, etc. The Author of The Snare Broken (which Published) is a
Person, who for his Learning, and Virtue serves the high Esteem, and Love of
All Men. That ^^pression of His, which your Friend has thought fit to ^lect, as
that which deserves his Public Reprehension, ^^th clearly represent the deep
Judgment, together ^ith the Christian Candor, and Modesty of the Author. (...)
does indeed (not as your Friend says, In Vain, but (...) very Good Purpose)
Persuade Men To lay aside their Philosophy, and wholly to betake themselves to
a Scriptural Consideration of the (...), by which says your Frie^^ (with what
Ingenuity let the World Judge) I understa^^ they must Take the Words of
Scripture without und^^standing them, or reconciling them to other Scripture or
even the current of Scripture, or common Reason Do they think that Scripture is
to be interpreted co^^trary to it self? Or that Divine Wisdom has made (...)
Belief of Contradictions necessary to Salvation. Ans^^ It Is manifest that by
Philosophy my Friend understand an Artificial Way of Thinking, and Discoursing,
that h^^ no Dependence upon the Holy Scriptures. But I sha^^ take the Boldness
to say that few, or none in this Ag^ who undertake to Interpret the Scriptures,
Argue mo^^ Rationally about the Sense of them than he does. I Cha^lenge You to
show wherein He has Interpreted Scripture contrary to it self; or given any Man
cause to question whether He think that Divine Wisdom has made the Belief of
Contradictions necessary to Salvation. (...) the same Letter are these very
Scoptical words, The^ can love the Father with all their Hearts, and Strengths
and Two Persons distinct from Him with the same All they can give all to one,
and all to another, and all to third, and never question the Possibility of it:
as (...) there were a Trinity in Unity in every Man, that (...) own Heart were
Three Hearts to be bestowed all, a^ entirely upon each of Three Objects, and
yet be but o^ Heart still. Answ. We assert that The Father, T^^ Son, and The
Holy Ghost are not Three Objects, b^ One Object of Our LOVE, or WORSHIP, T^^
Worship which the Almighty, the Fountain of All Goo^ness, The ONE BEING
ABSOLUTELY INFINITE, Requires of Us, is nothing else (as to t^^ Internal Act)
but Love Absolute or Vltimate, such Lo^ as Excludes All other Affections, but
what may be Ex^^^is'd in Subordination, and Subserviency to It: So that all ^e
Loves, or other Affections in our Hearts, which are Consistent with the True
Love of GOD, Proceed from (...), and Tend to the Continual Increase, and
Improvement of it, and are indeed Resolved into it, and become ^s it were a
Part of it. For this is the Love of God that we ^eep his Commandments, 1 John
5. 3. To Love our Neigh^our according to the Will of GOD, is indeed to Love
GOD. I Beseech Our Almighty and Most Merciful FATHER in the Name of the Blessed
JESUS to shed abroad His Love in your Heart by the HOLY GHOST, and shall ever
remain
