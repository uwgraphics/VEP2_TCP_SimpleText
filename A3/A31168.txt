THE PRODIGALS PILGRIMAGE.

A Poem.

Wherein is contained all the Remarkable Passages occurring from his Birth to
his Return.

Omnis semper Philosophia damnavit
Mixtas Paenitentiae voluptates.
Sen. LONDON, Printed for J. Nutt near Stationers' Hall, Anno Dom. School.

To the much Honored JOHN TRY, Esquire
SIR,
THe Prodigal, upon his Return, with great Reason pays his Respects to You, who
was Privy to his Departure, (if probably this seem Aenigmatical to the Reader,
I ask his Pardon, it is enough your self takes my Meaning.) This Person, were be
not hugely sensible of your kind Complacency, would still appear as true a
Prodigal as ever. In the agitation of Spirit, and search of thought, among many
motives for this his Revisitation, he could not determine on a more powerful
and prevailing inducement, than the shelter he hopes to find under your Roof,
from the storms and injuries of Critical Fortune. You, whose worthy Temper,
Ingenuity, and good Humor, (not to open into the Field of your excelling
Justice, Integrity, and other numerous Virtues,) delights not in Satirical
Reflections, or ill-natured Cavils; but whose Mind is constantly exercised in
amicable Offices, in friendly offers, and as friendly acceptations of
well-meant applications to you of any sort; not unlike the great Augustus
Caesar, who never dismissed any person Discontented or Disobliged.

Your innate Charity to all in general, and more especially to this relenting
Penitent, he assures himself, is so tender of his welfare, that you will
Indulge him, if it be but for fear he should grow desperate, and Relapse, and
so his last Aberrations, and State, should prove far worse than the first.

He believes he need say no more on his own behalf, presuming on your mighty
Goodness; only this he begs leave to super-add, -- That in the declension of
his late Meridian Splendour, he, having met with a Person that was immersed in
much the same Ill-circumstances with his unfortunate Self, takes the confidence
to bring him with him upon the same account of Respect and Homage; well-hoping
your inexhausted Generosity, will not refuse to extend your Smiles to him
likewise: he goes by the Name of Penseroso.

The Prodigal has not kept so much Company to be ignorant of, or defective in
good Manners; nor has lost his Breeding, together with his Fortunes; but still
retains a fit proportion. In Civility therefore to this Friend, a Stranger, he
puts him in before him, thus to kiss your hands;

(and so dos, with all due regard, your most faithful humble Servant, R. C.)

II Penseroso.
TELL me not Youth and Health can give
This our deceiving Life Content,
Who-e're we are resolved to Live,
Their sickly Pleasures all are spent:
And all the while they burn so bright,
Only give Lust and Error light.
II.
Tell me not there are Charms in Faces,
A Lip, an Eye, a Blush, an Air;
With all the other simp'ring Graces
Which the Enchanted World calls Fair:
Whilst I must either burn, or slake
My Flames in some polluted Lake.
III.
Tell me not there are Learned Parts,
The Mind's Indowments to be had;
And all the other Bedlam Arts
With which Grammari'ans can run mad;
Which bought with loss of Health and Rest,
Make us wise Gypsies at the best.
IV.
Tell me not Virtue's Worth can fill
The Soul's wide Center, since we know
No Difference between Good and Ill,
But as Opinion calls 'em so:
Since Honesty from Earth is fled,
And to be Good, is to be Dead.
V.
Tell me not there are Mines, in which
Painful and toiling Industry
May hope with delving to grow Rich,
Whilst I, condemned by Destiny,
With killing Envy do behold,
And worship Mules that carry Gold.
VI.
Tell me not Power and Government
Within their bright Sphere do contain
All that can sweeten and content
Our wretched Life: The greatest Pain
Of all my Torment is, to see
That Beasts must rule and trample me.
VII.
Tell me not any thing is Good,
Just, Fair, or Lovely; if there be
Something by others understood,
It Is so to them, and not to me,
Who, to an indifferent Fortune cursed,
Envy alike the best and worst.
The AUTHOR to the Beaus of this Age.
IN these few Lines, you Beaus, you may behold
The PRODIGAL, his Actions manifold;
His Lofty Pride, and then his Low Estate,
And by his Life may learn to guide your Fate.
And if you chance the self-same Course to run,
I wish you would look home, as he has done,
And have a serious Eye unto the End,
It Is better late, than never, to amend.
Long vadit, qui nunquam redit.
THE Prodigals Pilgrimage.
WHen the full Period of my Time was come,
That Nature called me from my Mothers Womb
To visit this Mad World, and placed me here
Within the compass of this Hemisphere,
To Act my part upon this Earthly Stage
Amongst the Children of this sinful Age;
She took me by the Hand, and gave me straight
Up to my Nurse, commanding her to wait,
And carefully to lay me on her Lap,
Feed me with wholesome Milk, and needful Pap;
To Swaddle me in Clouts, to keep me warm
From Cold, from Hunger, or what else might harm
My tender Limbs, and she her self would be
Still near at hand to Aid and Comfort me;
For I, she said, in time must undertake
A Journey, and a Pilgrimage must make
Through this wide Desert, this vast Wilderness,
Where I should meet with many a sad Distress;
Where I should marry strange Encounters find,
And violent Assaults to lift my Mind
Off from its proper Hinges, and to throw
Into a Gulf of everlasting Woe
Me and my utmost hopes, that I should stand
Even as a Mark set up for Fortune's hand
To shoot her Arrows at; that I should be
Environed round with that Triplicity
Of Mortal Enemies, that would be sure
To seek my Ruin, and my Wrack procure,
The World, the Flesh, and Lucifer's damned hate,
Who prosecutes Man's good and hopeful State
With Malice and Despite in every place,
Would cross my passage in this dangerous Race,
And seek to win me by their cunning Art,
To Consecrate the best of all my Heart
To their Devotion, and to draw me in
To be a Slave, or Servant sold to Sin.
And therefore it was requisite that I
Should have a careful Nurse, that might supply,
And make me able to adventure through
This uncouth Wilderness, where every Bough,
In this my restless Pilgrimage would stay
My wearied Steps, and intercept my Way.
All this my Nurse and Nature did consider,
And both combined, as I conceive, together
In Cherishing me up: For I e're long
Forsook my Nurse's Lap, I grew so strong,
And stood alone, and walked without a Stay,
Or any Hand to guide me in the Way.
Then, like a cap'ring Frog, I skipp'd about
In every Corner of the House throughout,
And was as nimble as a Mouse that spied
A Cat prepared to leap upon her Hyde.
Then would I to my Mother's Breasts resort,
Offering to Suck them in a wanton Sport;
And back again returned unto my Play;
And as an Ape with every gayish Toy
Is soon surpised; so did I take Delight
To please my wanton Childish Appetite
With whatso'er the Object did instill
Into my Fancy, were it Good or Ill.
Here Nature gave me leave a while to stay,
And sport my self, then on I took my Way;
For now she had infused to every Vein
Hot, Youthful Blood, and filled my wandering Brain
With such a strong imaginary Stream
Of fond Delights, as I began to dream
That all this Universe was but a Stage
Of glittering Pomp, and glorious Equipage,
Which should for ever last, as if the Wheel
Of Fortune had been fixed, and could not reel.
She also had imparted to my Mind
Some little Understanding, how to find
Content in what I did: Thus did she ring
A Larum to my Senses, gave each Limb
A quick Agility, to every Part
An active Vigor, and she crowned my Heart
With Joy and Gladness, so that I conceived
Nothing but Mirth had been to me bequeathed.
She brought me from the House, into the Fields,
And look what Pleasure or Content that yields,
I Reaped at full, I Skipp'd from Place to Place
Like a young wanton Kid, pursued my Chase
From Hill to Dale, I ran through Thick and Thin,
No Limits could contain nor bound me in.
I Sung, I Danced, I gathered fragrant Flowers,
Such as fair Virgins beautify their Bowers,
And deck their Bridal Chambers with, the Rose
Which in the Spring does first of all disclose.
The Honey-Suckle, and sweet Eglantine,
Love and Hearts-Ease, but good and wholesome Time
I utterly neglected, and for Rue,
Or Herbs of Grace, I ever did eschew.
These healthful Herbs seemed bitter to my Taste,
Harsh and unsavory, I therefore cast
On them a careless Look, and with an Eye
Full of Disdain and Scorn, I passed them by;
I washed my Body in the Silver stream,
Rubbed off the Dust and Sweat, then wiped it clean;
Then did I many Frisks and Capers make
Upon the flow'ring Grass, and often shake
My dewy Locks, so tumbling up and down,
Laughed out my Days, never dreaming of a Frown.
I thousand other Recreations took:
Sometimes I cast my Angle in the Brook,
And with some Artificial Fly or Gnat
Deceived those silly Fish that Bit thereat:
Then would I set some Spring, or cunning Gin,
To catch those pretty Birds that peeped therein:
And sometimes hunt the Fox, or fearful Hare,
Or use some Art to take them in my Snare;
And with my nimble and strong scented Hound
Pursue the Buck, or pull the Stag to ground;
And from their Misery and hard Distress
I did receive a kind of Happiness.
And thus, as in Elysium Fields, my days
I seemed to spend, never dreaming of those ways,
Those Rugged, Rough, and dangerous passages,
Those Brakes, those Briers, and that Wilderness
I was to Wander through, nor of those Foes
That lie in wait where e're poor Mortal goes,
To strip him of his Richest Ornaments,
His Faith, his Grace, his spotless Innocence;
And in their stead, his wretched Soul invest
With loathsome Rags, which God does much detest.
I hitherto was Blind; I could not See,
Nor understand the Fatal Destiny,
Which, like the Sword of Damocles, hung down
Just perpendicular upon my Crown;
And in the midst of all my Pomp and Cheer,
Fore-shew'd my Fall and Ruin to be near;
My Feet were Fettered yet, and could not Run
The Race which they most gladly would have done;
My Hands were also Pinyon'd, and my Mind
Within it is Orb and Circle was confined;
For with a careful Look, and awful Eye,
My Parents Marked me when I stepped awry,
And often brought me to the Fold again,
When I was lost and straggling in the Plain;
I had besides a Tutor, to Survey
My wandering Steps, and keep me at a Bay;
At home, and eke abroad, I had a Guide
To Prop me up, when I began to Slide.
But when the Rod was Burnt, and winged Time
Compelled these careful Guardians to Resign,
And leave me to my Self, as being now
A Knotty Piece, more apt to Break than Bow;
When Nature had performed her Work in me,
And raised me from a Shrub unto a Tree:
When she had furnished me in every point,
Made strong each Sinew, knit each slender Joint,
And with soft Down had so enriched my Chin,
As new Spring Leaves adorn the Trees in Spring:
Then did I hoise up Sails, and from the Shore,
Into the swelling Ocean with my Oar,
I forthwith sought to Lanch, both Wind and Tide,
And all black threatening Gusts, I did deride.
I cast the servile Yoke from off my Neck,
A Frown seemed harsh to me, much more a Check;
And from my former Sports I scorned to think
That e're my lofty Spirit could stoop to Drink
At such a pudled Stream: The Court alone
Presented to my thoughts a glittering Throne,
Enriched with all Delights; and therefore now
The Portion which my Birthright did allow
I labored to obtain; nor could the kind
And fair persuasions of my Parents bind
My refractory Will, but every thought,
Like an Enchanted Spell, within me wrought,
'Till, like a Pilgrim, laboring in a straight,
I found the Error of my vain Conceit.
When I had filled my Bags, and crammed my Purse,
I bad adieu, fall better, or fall worse;
So mounting up upon a stately Steed,
I cried, St. George and Fortune be my speed;
And as I passed along, where e're I came,
My large Expenses Echoed out my Name;
At last I touched, and Landed at that Shore,
Where, Tagus like, the Sand with Golden Ore
Did seem to be Enriched, this place I spied
Like Ilium in the height of all her Pride.
For at my first Arrival there I found
Mirth at its height, and Pleasure to abound;
The Air with Acclamations loud did Ring,
The People Danced and Sung, as in the Spring;
The Winged Choiristers did stretch their Throats,
To Carrol out a Thousand several Notes;
The Bells did Ring, the Bonefires up did fly,
And every House was filled with Melody;
The very Echo seemed to Rejoice,
And to this Music tuned her curtailed Voice:
I saw at every great and spacious Gate
Wine dol'd about to People as they sat;
I saw at every mean and common door
Beer freely given, both to Rich and Poor;
I saw a Troop of Coaches in the Street
Lined with Brisk Beaus, and the proud Horses Feet
Struck on the Pavement with so loud a din,
As if it had a rattling Thunder bin;
I heard the Cannons from the Tower to roar,
As if the whole Foundation would have tore:
Of all the Stately Buildings, much I mused
To see these Sights, and hear this Noise confused;
And presently conceived this was the Cell
Where all the Gods and Goddesses did dwell;
Or that it was the Theater where they
Descended to behold poor Mortals Play;
For I had of their Banqueting and Sports
Read in the Histories, and strange Reports
Of Ancient Poets, then into an Inn
I set my Horse, and called the Chamberlain;
I asked of him from what Triumphant Cause
Arose that Joy, that Mirth, and great Applause;
He told me 'twas a Customary thing
In that great City for the Bells to Ring,
For Bonefires to be made, nay, many a time
The very Conduits were to run with Wine;
And how I daily in that place might see
Of Sports and Pleasures great Variety.
I then dismissed him, and began to think
This was the very Spring where I might Drink
And swallow in Delight; I felt a Fire
Surprise my Blood, and with a hot desire
Inflame my Heart, to put in Practice strait
Pride, Gluttony, and Lust, that tempting Bait.
Then did my Flesh suggest unto my Mind,
That hitherto I had not been so kind
To Her as She deserved; I had not Fed,
Nor Richly Clothed Her as She merited;
And that I should do well now to begin
To Pamper Her, who had so loving been;
She bid me cast my wandering Eyes about,
And look what Beaut'ous Prize I could find out:
She charged me with a brisk Result, to make
A bold Assault, for Gold and Greatness shake
The strongest Fortress, and will pierce the Heart
Which seemed Steeled against Cupid's Dart,
And She would not be wanting to fulfill
My hot desires, and Execute my Will.
The World did also to mine Eyes present
Such glittering Splendour, and so Orient,
That I stood much Amazed, and looked thereon
Like one surpised with Admiration.
She bad me not to Wonder, nor to think
Her Power and Greatness in a small Precinct
Was Bounded in, but that her Empire run
As far as e're the Golden tressed Sun
Did stretch his glorious Beams, and I should be
As Brave as any Object I did see:
In following Her, not mighty Caesar's state,
Nor Craesus Riches, should outshine my Fate.
With these two Witches came the Devil in,
And when they ended, then did He begin;
He showed me in a Vision at one time
The Situation of this Earthly Clime;
And brought unto my Sight such Beauties rare,
As Rosamond might not with them compare;
And did present to my Enchanted Eyes
Such heaps of Gold, and precious Rareties,
As bright Apollo on his Burning Car
Appeared to them but like a twinkling Star;
And told me, what he showed me in a Glass
In should Enjoy, and really Possess,
If I would be his Servant, and obey
What he Commanded both to do and say.
When they had cunningly my Senses Charmed
With these illusive Spells, they soon disarmed
My Soul of all her Heavenly Furniture,
Which should have been her Guard against their power,
And I struck Hands with them, a Contract made,
Protesting to observe what e're they said,
And wheresoever I came, no place nor time
Should make me their three Friendships to resign.
When Juno, Pallas, and Loves Beauteous Queen
To Paris in the Vale of I Would were seen,
And there, as three Corrivals for the Prize
Of Beauty's favor, and commanding Eyes,
Stood in Contention, and had made a Vow
To stand to what his Censure did allow:
The first proposed a Kingdom and a Crown
For his Reward, might She be first set down:
The second told him that He should excel
All Men in Wisdom, might she bear the Bell:
The third indeed, who bore the Prize away,
Told him She had a Spouse as fair as day
To be his Partner in the Bed of Pleasure,
Whose Beauty was esteemed so Rich a Treasure,
That many Kings and Princes for her sake
Should enter into Arms, and undertake
A Mortal War; Millions of Souls should spend
Their Lives for Her, and for no other end.
Paris was not so much surpised with Wonder
And Joy, when he began to think and ponder
Of what these Goddesses to him had said,
And promised too, as I was well apaid
Of these Bewitching Sirens, whose false Lies
Infected me with Thousand Vanities.
Then did I set a Flourish on my Back,
Called for my Tailor, told him I would lack
Nothing which now the Fashion did require;
Thus Pride did first my Senses set on fire.
Then did I flaunt it in the open Street,
And justled those whom I did chance to meet;
My Body clothed in Silk, my Head implum'd
With flaunting Feathers, and my Hair perfumed;
And quickly was I known, for still I wore
A Lure about me, which would make Men sore,
And stoop to me as fast, as when we see
A well Manned Faulcon from a lofty Tree
Descend with speed to seize upon his Prey,
Being sharp and hungry, kept for Sport that day.
Then to the Ordinary I did frequent,
Where every one my Bounty did resent,
And soon my Friendship was indear'd to those,
Who love to be acquainted with good Clothes;
With Conge and with Cringe, with Duck and Dive
I was Saluted; every Man did strive
To be Enrolled amongst those Friends, whom I
Selected as my choicest Company.
Thus Flattery, with his Enchanting Song,
and Incantation, wrought on me so strong,
And did so pow'rfully my Mind incense
With an absurd Belief and Confidence,
As every Man, in my conceit, did seem
To hold my Person in a high Esteem:
For still my Purse was open, and out my Crowns
Flew like the flakes of Snow upon the Downs.
Then from the City to the Court I went,
To feel the temper of that Element:
Then I observed with what a stately Train
Some Lords passed by, when other Lords were fain
To stand a loof, and hardly to appear,
Unless they were unto these Great Ones dear.
I also then observed the fond and vain
Conceited Antic of a Courtly strain;
One Leaped, and Skipt, and Sung, and played the Fool,
As if he had been in a Dancing-School:
A second kissed his Hand, and scraped a Leg
To every one, upon whose lofty Head
A Feather did but Wag: A third did look
As big as great Alcides, when he shook
A Lion by the Beard; all which did seem
To me no better than a sportful Scene,
Strange and ridiculous, yet I did fall
In Imitation to exceed them all;
For there a while I made my Residence,
Ruffling in Silk and Gold, my large expense
Had blown my Fame and Credit long before,
I soon got Entrance at the Presence Door;
Here one great Lord did take me by the Hand,
Another called me Cosen, bid command
His Love and Service, and Inferiors strove
To gain my Friendship with obsequious Love.
Thus did I seem to be indear'd to all,
Embraced and courted far beyond my call;
And whilst my Head above the Stream did Swim
I found enough to hold me by the Chin.
Then to the City I returned again,
Where I resolved my Self to entertain
With all the Pleasures that I could devise.
And first, I taught my amorous looking Eyes
To Court the choicest Beauties, and Inroll
Their Wanton glances in my lustful Soul;
And with their piercing Sight to search and try,
And pick the very Lock of Chastity;
Whom with large Promises, and ample Gifts,
I quickly Won; Lust has a thousand Shifts.
Then with the rarest Harmony I fed
My curious Ears, and on a costly Bed
I laid my Corpse, and served my Amorous touch
Till I was Cloyed, and thought I had too much;
And with the richest Aromatic Fume
I sent the Incense of a sweet Perfume
Up to my Brain, and did revive my Sense
Of Smelling, with an infinite Expense:
I also did supply my Liquorish taste
With so profuse and Prodigal a wast,
That in one Night two thousand Crowns did fly,
To please my wanton Sensuality:
I gave my Mistress Rings and Jewels store,
And at my Cost and Charge her Body wore
Silks of the Richest Die, Silver and Gold,
Or whatsoever the Mercers Shop did hold:
Upon her Alablaster Skin was drawn
The finest Holland, and the purest Lawn,
And whatsoever for Money could be bought,
Or Rich, or Rare, I to my Mistress brought.
And when her Fancy drew her out to Range,
To view the Golden Cheap, or glittering Change;
Or in the Fields to suck the wholesome Air,
To make her Fairer seem, that seemed most Fair;
A Rich Caroch, drawn with six Prancers, still
Stood in a readiness to serve her Will:
And thus in Wanton Riot and Excess
I spent my Time, never dreaming of Distress;
And though my Crowns did shrink, and much abate,
Yet could not Reason stir me, nor awake
My Understanding, until all was gone,
And no Friend left me to rely upon;
For being cloyed with what I did and saw
In this great Town, then did my Fancy draw
My wandering Thoughts to visit Foreign Parts,
Fashions and Courts of other Potentates.
To Gravesend then I went, and there I found
A Vessel under Sail, and ready Bound,
Which landed me upon the Coast of France,
Where to the Court I did my self advance;
Then with the Monsieurs I did flaunt it out,
Pranc d on my Foot-cloth Paris round about,
And with the greatest Lords, and mighty Dukes,
I did consort in rich and costly Suits;
There I saluted the Parisian Dames,
And Courted Ladies of the greatest Names,
And was accounted a brave Cavalier
Of high Esteem, and to their Persons dear.
But when my Crowns were spent, and that fair crew
Of Angels, which so thick about me flew,
And raised my Person to that high Esteem,
Had took their flight, and could no more be seen;
Then did my Reputation quickly crack,
My Purse grew Sick, the Clothes upon my Back
Grew Poor, and Threedbare too, my Credit failed,
I had so far beyond my Compass Sailed;
And they with whom I had great Empire born
Looked on me then but with Contempt and Scorn;
And every one did note my Poverty,
A Lackey scarce would keep me Company:
Then was I driven to a narrow strait,
Where I Commanded I was glad to Wait,
And where I had my Foot the foremost set
I shrunk, like dainty Lawn in Water wet;
And when my Money was all spent and gone,
As Marygolds at Setting of the Sun
Shrink in their Heads, so did I hide my Face,
When that bright Sun was Set that did me Grace:
Then I resolved to change that luckless Air,
And once more to my Native Soil repair,
To visit England's Court, where I in store
Had many Friends that would not see me Poor.
So on I came, as fast as well I could,
Trudging on Foot, for now my Horse was Sold;
And wandering like a Pilgrim all alone,
With many a deep fetched Sigh and heavy Groan,
At last I came unto a Forest side,
And in I entered without help or guide;
Where having passed some Miles, I saw in view
A Troop of Forest Beasts, a Savage Crew;
Whereat being much Amazed, and sore Aghast,
I took a Tree, and Marked them as they past.
I saw a Lion march before the rest
With stately Motion, as became him best;
And after him a spotted Leopard
Came stalking like some proud ambitious Lord:
I saw th'untamed Panther then to come,
And after him a Unicorn to run:
I saw a Boar assault another Beast,
And with his furious Tusks did gore his Breast:
I saw a cruel Woolf surprise a Deer,
And pluck him down, and out his Bowels tear:
I saw a Fox pursue a gentle Lamb,
That Bleating stood, and cried unto his Dam:
I saw a Tiger his fierce Visage hide
So cunningly, as none his falsehood spied,
And only showed his smooth and dainty Skin,
Which smelt so Sweet, that many Beasts came in
To Wonder at him, till at last he got
His Prey within his reach; then out he shot
His dreadful Looks, and with a nimble speed,
As swift as Air, pursued a gallant Steed.
Lord! how this Spectacle did damp my Mind,
To see these Beasts so Cruel to their Kind,
Never Dreaming the like Cruelty did rest
In Manly Shapes, and in a Humane Breast.
These being past, I did descend again,
And forwards took my Journey to the Main,
Where being Mounted on Proud Neptune's Back,
I found he Roared, and made the Vessel Crack,
As if he had been Angry at the ill
I had committed: but we Sailed on still,
And at the last came to the wished for Shore,
Where, when I Landed, I had paid my Score;
My Purse was quite Exhaust, and by the way
I for my Succor was compelled to Pray;
At last my tired Legs my Body brought
Unto that Harbor which my wishes sought,
And where I hoped a present Cure to find,
To ease my sad and discontented Mind;
And therefore with a Resolute intent,
To see a dear and special Friend I went:
A special Friend, said I? a special Foe:
For when I had recounted all my Woe;
When I had told him all my Care and Grief,
He seemed to give me Scorn, and not Relief;
When I had opened and unlocked my Heart,
Showed him how Fortune had discharged her Dart,
And shot me through and through, had plucked me bare,
And left me not a Feather for my share;
And that I had no Penny to redeem
My Body from the Rancor of her Spleen;
He (like a River, whose fair Stream grows dry
In heat of Summer, when necessity
Requires Water most) answered again,
His Purse was weak to bear up his own Train,
Much less could prop up the declining state
Of other Men. Then did I see my Fate
By my Acquaintance; others then I tried,
But all I found Infected with like Pride,
With like Ingratitude; there was not one
Whose Heart was not Transformed into a Stone.
Then was I driven, by the hand of Fate
And hard Necessity, an Alms to take
Of those, whose Fortunes I had known but Poor,
And Begged my Bread even at a Beggar's Door;
And in the Fields I was compelled to stand,
And ask a Penny at a Stranger's hand.
Where I had many a Hungry Belly fed,
Had many Clothed, had many Visited,
And with my Bounty raised their Spirits up,
Whom Fortune forced to drink her Bitter Cup;
Where I had Money in abundance Spent,
Where I had Moneys given, had Moneys lent,
I hardly got so much as would suffice
One Hungry Meal. Then did my Stomach rise,
And from the deep Abyss, my enraged heart
Called up Revenge to Act her Tragic part:
I did implore the Powers of Heaven to Crown
Their heads with Shame, and Rain such Vengeance down,
That every Minute might as tedious be
To them, as they seemed tedious to me:
I did invoke the' Infernal Hags of Hell,
To sad Despair their Wretched Lives to sell:
I courted Atropos, at my request,
To draw her Fatal Sisters to detest
Their hateful Lives, and to combine in one
To cut their Thread of Life which they had Spun:
I charged each Planet, I adjur'd each Star
To threaten and denounce Intestine War:
I Prayed and Su'd to every Element,
To be Prodig'ious and Malevolent:
I Wooed the Earth to swallow them Alive,
I Wooed the Air their Mischiefs to contrive;
I Wooed the Waters, with a Raging Flood
To overwhelm and Bury them in Mud:
I Wooed the Fire to descend in Flames,
And utterly Consume their Rotting Names:
I Wooed the Thunderbolts to strike them Dead,
And throw the Sulfurous Lightning on their Head:
I Wooed the Moon, her Silver Lamp to shrowed
Within the Bosom of a gloomy Cloud:
I Wooed the Sun to hide his glori'ous Rays,
I Wooed the silent Night, I wooed the Days,
To yield them no Relief, but let them run
From place to place, like Men with Furies stung:
Thus in a Frantic, Mad, and Bedlam rage,
The Powers of Heaven and Earth I did engage
My Quarrel to Revenge, to shoot their Darts
In my Defense, and Wound their Treacherous Hearts:
I kick't the Earth, I tore my careless Hair,
And in a Melancholy sad Despair
I drew my Sword, his wretched Life to end,
That had nor Penny left, nor yet a Friend.
But by the Mercy of the Power Divine
My furious Hand was staid, and I resigned
My Heart to Patience, and began to call
To strict Account my Life and Actions all;
I did consider my Offense was great,
And oftentimes I did the same repeat:
I did consider that I had done ill,
And oftentimes that Thought my hopes did kill:
And yet I thought there could be no Offense
So great, but that a Father might dispense:
I thought what ill soever could be done,
A Father might forgive a Pen'itent Son:
I will Resolve, I will, quoth I, go home,
Pour out my Plaints to him, to him make Moan;
I Will Beg, Entreat, and Supplication make,
And ask forgiveness for my Sav'iour's sake.
So homeward to my Fathers House I went,
And e're I came a Messenger I sent;
I sent him word a Prodigal was come,
A Prodigal that once was called his Son;
But now that Interest I did forgo,
For why? my Sins deserved it should be so;
I should be happy if I might retain
A Hireling's Room, and in his House remain;
To be admitted to a Servants place,
I hold exceeding Love, exceeding Grace.
When of my Coming he did understand,
My Father ran to me, and shook my Hand,
Fell on my Neck, and kissed me, brought me home,
Stripped off those Rags which were so loathsome grown,
And Clothed me well, my hungry Belly filled,
Even with the Fatling that for me was killed:
Upon my Finger put a Ring of Gold,
And gave me Blessings great and manifold,
And told me he would all forget, forgive,
And that I should with him for ever live.
Then fell I prostrate on my bended Knee
Before the high Eternal Deity,
Presenting at his Altar, as a true
Idea of a Soul refined New,
My Penitent Tears, which in abundance I
Shed for my Time consumed in Vanity;
I did Abjure, Renounce, and cast off clear
Those Vanities which I had held so Dear;
In Contemplation I resolved to spend
The Remnant of my Days, until my End;
So in a private, solitary Cell,
I, with Old Timon, bad the World farewell.
FINIS.
