The Gowlin: Or, A Pleasant Fancy for the Spring.
Being a brisk Encounter betwixt a Scotch Leard, and a buxome Begger-wen^^
He captivated was at the first sight,
Not with her gay attire, but beauty bright:
He wooed and won her for to serve his will,
Yet he is a Leard, and she a beggar still.
To a New Playhouse Tune: Or, See the Gowlin my Jo, etc.
With Allowance.


A Broad as I was walking,
upon a Summers day,
There I met a Beggar wench
clothed all in gray:
Her clothes they were so torn,
you might a seen her skin,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the Gowlin my Jo,
to see the Gowlin;
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin.
You Gallants of delight
pray take it not in scorn,
She came of Adams seed,
though she was basely born;
And though her clothes were ragged
she had a Milk white skin,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the, etc.
She had a pretty little foot,
and a moist hand;
For which she might compare
with any Lady in the Land:
Ruby Lips, Cherry Cheeks,
and a dimpled Chin;
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin
Ah! To see the, etc.:
Her features did so tempt me,
I could not be at rest;
But I must fall aboard on her,
although she was undrest:
I bid her take it quietly
and not make any din,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the Gowlin my Jo,
to see the Gowlin;
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin.
The Second Part, to the same Tune.
At first she seemed Squemish,
and blushed to see me smile;
But I began to sweeten her,
and pause a little while:
At length I told her plainly
'twas but a venial sin,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the Gowlin my Jo,
to see the Gowlin;
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin.
hen that I had wooed her,
and wed her to my will;
I could not then devise a way
to keep the Baby still:
She bid me be at quiet,
she valued not a pin,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the, etc.
I found her free and frolic,
and ready for to sport;
My arms I then did handle,
with speed to storm the Fort:
Quo I my blithe and bonny Lass,
it is time for to begin,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the Gowlin my Jo, etc.
Then she took her Bern up
and wrapped it weel in clothes,
And then she took a Gowlin
and stuck between her Toes;
And ever as the Lurden cried,
and made any din,
She shook her Foot, and sung to it,
see the Gowlin:
Ah! see the Gowlin my Jo, etc.
hen as we came to the embrace,
I made not many brags;
But with all the skill I had,
I folded up her Rags:
And then no matter what I did,
Or what she did again,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the Gowlin my Jo, etc.
When I had satisfied my sense,
by doing of the feat,
She motions made to me again,
my Lesson to repeat:
But I began to have enough
of play, at In, and In,
She was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see, etc.
I bid her to be silent,
and gave her a Gold Ring,
Becase she was a bonny Lass,
and fit to do the thing;
And so I left the Beggar wench,
that had so white a skin,
Who was the first that taught me
to see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see, etc.
The Gowlin is a yellow Flower
that grows upon the plains,
Which often times is gathered
by nimphs, and shepherd swains;
When youngsters walk upon the down
they think it a fine thing,
To give their Sweet-hearts a green gown
and see the Gowlin:
Ah! To see the Gowlin my Jo,
to see the Gowlin;
To give their Sweet-hearts a green gown,
and see the Gowlin.
