A COPY OF THE TEST Which is to be taken by all such Persons as shall be
employed in any public Place of TRUST in SCOTLAND.
I A.B.C. Affirm and Testify and declare by this my Solemn Oath, that I own
and sincerely profess the true Protestant Religion, as its founded in the Word
of God, and at present is Established and Professed in this Kingdom, and that
I disown and renounce all such Principles, Doctrines, and Practices whatsoever,
Popish or Phanatical, which are contrary to, and inconsistent with our
Religion, as its Established by Law and Doctrine, Worship and Government; and
for the Testification of my obedience to my most Gracious Sovereign Charles the
Second, I do Affirm and declare this Solemn Oath, that the Kings Majesty is the
only Supreme Governor of this Realm, and of all other His Majesty's Dominions
and Countries, as well in Ecclesiastical Causes as Civil, and that no foreign
Power, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate have or ought to have any
Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Preheminency or Authority Ecclesiastical of
Civil within this Realm, and therefore I do utterly Renounce all Foreign
Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority, and Authority, and do promise that from
henceforth, I shall bear faithful and true Allegiance to His Majesty, His
Heirs, and Lawful Successors, and to my utmost-power shall assist and defend
all Rights, Jurisdictions, Prerogatives, and Privileges, Preheminences and
Authorities, belonging to His Majesty's own and Lawful Successors.

And I further Affirm and declare by this my Solemn Oath, that I Judge it
unlawful for Subjects upon any pretense whatsoever to enter into Covernant, or
Levy, or to Assemble themselves together without the Kings Express Warrant,
Consent, and Authority to take up Arms against the King or those Commissionated
by him; And that the National Convenant as it was sworn and explained in the
year (1638) And the Solemn League and Covenant were and are in themselves
unlawful Oaths, and were taken by, and imposed upon the Subjects of this
Kingdom against the fundamental Laws and Liberties of the same; And that there
lies no Obligation on me from the said Oaths, or either of them, to Endeavor,
Alter or Change the Government, either of Church or State, as its now
Established by the Laws of this Kingdom.

And I do promise and Swear, that I shall with my utmost power assist, defend,
and maintain His Majesty's Jurisdictions aforesaid, against all Opposers
whatsoever, and shall never declaim His Majesty's power, as I shall answer to
God.

And finally, I Affirm and declare, that this my Solemn Oath and Declaration,
is given in the plain genuine Sense of the words, without any Equivocation,
mental Reservation, or any manner of Evasion whatsoever, So help me God.
