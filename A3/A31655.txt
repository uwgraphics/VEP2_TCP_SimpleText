The Chancellor turned TARPAULIN, Or Iefferies Case.
TO be a Prisoner, hated, loathed, and scorned,
With unlamented Plagues, thy Fall unmourn'd,
Under approaching Torments keenest Dread,
And 'midst a shouting Crowd unpitied led
To meet a shameful Death, would seem to atone
All horrid Villainies except thy own:
But they so numerous, great and loud appear,
They dull Repentance, as they heighten Fear.
Curs't by your King, your Country, and, it seems,
You're Curs't too by your own Prophetic Dreams:
Curs't in your Novice Years and Indigence,
When Railing was your Law and Eloquence.
And Curs't e're since for Fraud and Bribery,
Lying, Partiality, and Perjury:
Curs't by all People prosperous and forlorn,
And will be Curs't by Thousands yet unborn.
Curs't by the Just and Virtuous, and what is worse,
You have your Fathers and your Childrens Curse.
Legions of Ghosts you have murdered will appear,
And whisper on the Gallows in your Ear,
Your byas't Judgments given aganst the Good,
That you might reek in Money and in Blood.
The Tyrant when Perillus brought his Bull,
Made the Inventor prove the first sad Howl.
Your Whipping so (tho late) should well be tried
(Which you found out) upon your bleeding Hide.
And thus Condemned you will be rewarded well,
With Pill'ry, Carts Tail, Gibbets, Flames and Hell.
And with your Quarters hurled into your Grave,
Let this be wrote, I was both Fool and Knave,
To Law and Drink a Scandal and a Slave.
FINIS.
