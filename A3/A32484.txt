A PROCLAMATION For putting off the Fair to be held the Thirteenth of October
next ensuing, in the Fields and Grounds near Gravesend.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty out of his Princely and Christian care of His
Loving Subjects, that no good means of Providence may be neglected to stay the
further spreading of the great Infection of the Plague, does find it necessary
to prevent all occassions of public concourse of His People for the present,
till it shall please Almighty God of his goodness to cease the violence of the
Contagion, which is very far dispersed into many Parts of this Kingdom
already; And therefore remembering that there is at hand a Fair in the Fields
and Grounds near Gravesend in the County of Kent, upon the Thirteenth Day of
October next ensuing, unto which there is usually great resort from the
adjacent places which are at the present Infected, the holding whereof would in
all likelihood be the occasion of further danger and Infection to other parts
of the Land which by Gods merry stand clear and free, Has with the Advice of
his Privy Council thought good by this open Declaration of His Pleasure and
necessary Commandment, not only to Admonish and Require all His Loving
Subjects to forbear to resort, for this time, to the said Fair kept in the
Fields and Grounds near Gravesend in the said County of Kent upon the
Thirteenth Day of October next ensuing, but also to Enjoyne the Lord of the
said Fair and all others interested therein, or any of them, that they all
forbear to hold the said Fair, or anything thereto appertaining at the
accustomed or at any other time, till by Gods goodness and merry the Infection
of the Plague shall cease, or be so much diminished that His Majesty shall give
Order for holding the same, upon pain of such Punishment, as for a Contempt so
much concerning the Universal safety of His People, they shall be adjudged to
deserve, which they must expect to be inflicted with all severity: And to that
purpose does hereby further Charge and Enjoyne under like Penalty all Persons
whatsoever, that they forbear to repair to the said Fair, until it shall
please God to cease the Infection now remaining amongst Us, His Majesty's
intention being and so hereby declaring Himself that no Lord of any Faires, or
others interested in the profits thereof, shall by this necessary and temporary
Restraint receive any prejudice in the right of his or their Faires or
Liberties thereunto belonging; Any thing before mentioned notwithstanding.

Given at our Court at Whitehall the 26th Day of September in the Eighteenth
Year of our Reign.
