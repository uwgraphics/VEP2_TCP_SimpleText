THE REPLY OF W. C.

A Full and Clear REPLY To a Paper ENTITLED, REASONS For a Limited EXPORTATION
OF WOOL.
BEfore I come directly to reply to the said Answer, I shall premise a few
things; First, though my Antagonist finds his Design Opposed by several
Discourses under the Name of W. C. (and chiefly by one called Englands
Interest) yet he has done me the Honor to Front his Discourse course with
diverse Propositions, allowed even by himself;

I shall therefore answerably endeavor to treat the said Author with all that
Civility, that is necessary in this Case, granting to him what is true,
rectifying what I conceive to be mistaken; and answering such objections, as
are material.

I must needs say, that I had no thoughts of appearing in Public any more, and
could not easily have been moved thereunto, had not my Zeal to the Commerce of
the Nation (which is at present solely maintained by the Woollen Manufacture of
it) Raised my fears so far as to believe a great Prejudice is coming upon Us,
and so far as to doubt also that we may be hastening of it, by those very means
we would endeavor to prevent it.

And therefore I cannot but like the dumb Child speak, when he saw a Knife at
his Fathers Throat, I mean, when I consider the extremity we are like to be in
from the French Kings Vigilance, and the great Endeavors that he has of late
used to acquire the making of the Woollen Manufacture in his own Kingdom, and
what Artifice and vast Expense he does use to effect his said design, both in
France, and by his Agents here in England, even at this very day,
notwithstanding his Mind is and cannot but be so much engaged in the present
Wars: And if he does this in the very midst of his distractions, what will he
not do, or what may we not expect hereafter from him when he shall be at Peace
with all his Neighbors, especially having already gotten such Quantities of
our Wool, as he has.

And to encourage the Manufacture thereof in his own Kingdom, he has even very
lately issued forth his Edict, for the erecting Hospitals in many Towns in
France, both for the setting all sorts of Persons at work (that are able) in
the Woollen Manufacture, and for the Maintenance of all Indigent Persons, and
not to suffer a Beggar there.

And if the French King, how fair soever he pretends a Friendship to us, be
Designing by all ways and means, to Undermine our Commerce, and by it to
prejudice us in our Trade and Strength by Sea, I may I hope be pardoned, if I
am more than indifferently concerned, or more than ordinarily warm, to think
that we our selves should endeavor to perfect His Design by delivering up our
Wool, the. Foundation of so Rich a Manufacture, into His hands; for that which
is moved, is moved principally (if not solely) for the French Kings advantage,
and that which is desired (if granted) tends to our own Inevitable ruin.

Nor can we hereafter think of so Vain and Idle a Vhing, as to recover our
Woollen Manufacture once lost, or to preserve the Kings Customs, or the
Strength and Shipping of this Great Kingdom without it.

Upon all which considerations, I cannot but humbly entreat the Nobility and
Gentry, (and more especially such as have the Honor to serve their Country, in
Parliament) seriously to reflect upon the wisdom of that Great Prince, King
Edward the 3d. and upon the Method which he in his Reign used, now so long
since to gain the Woollen Manufacture out of Flanders into this Country, and
withal Impartially compare that with the present Practice of the French King
before mentioned.

And then to Consider whether, we have not Reason to do the utmost we may to
Prevent his Design, or whether we have Reason to do all that we can (nay more
than he himself does ask or expect from us) by a Law to promote and Encourage
his Design.

We must be very short-sighted, if we understand not that after he has
supplied his own Country, he will not only endeavor, but will soon be able, to
supply Flanders, Portugal, Spain, and the Streights, to gain an Advantage to
his own Subjects; for if he may break the Laws of Commerce, and lay what
Impositions he pleases upon our Cloth, and all other our Native Commodities,
even while we are at Peace with him, why may he not also lay an Imposition upon
all our ships that pass the Streights, or that shall dare to Trade or bring the
same Commodities that he does in any Port of Italy, or Turkey, where the
Subjects of his Greatness comes? And when our Commerce is lost and our
Manufacture gone, and our Ships imposed upon that shall pass the Seas, what
shall be left to defend our selves in case we will not also receive his Codex,
or whatsoever he shall (for the greatness of his name) think fit to require of
us.

All which things, whether they be convenient not only to be wished but to be
Contributed to by a Law, I humbly leave to my Opponents themselves to judge.
For when the Trade that not only brings such a Revenue to his Majesty, but is
the Riches and Strength of this Kingdom shall be lost, as is now attempted,
what Way or Means may we as Rational Persons, think (on) to prevent any of
those Mischiefs before mentioned.

This General being premised, I shall now enter upon the Discourse it self: the
main Aim or Scope of my Antagonist divides it Self into two Parts, the one to
prove that there ought to be a Limited Transportation of Wool; the other that
by a Limited Exportation of Wool the Price of it may be Raised: and by the
Raising of this, the Rents of Lands, may and will be increased, and his
Majesty's Customs greatly Advanced; and if these things were Really
Practicable, I should not only be so Just to my Self, and to my Opponents, but
so just to the Nation, as not to put Pen to Paper to trouble my Reader, and
much less to expose my self to a Stage of Contention, as I am now like to do;
but for as much as the quite contrary will (if I mistake not) appear, I shall
therefore Examine and Weigh those Reasons and Grounds which my Oppnent has
brought for those Assertions.

Whereas my Opponent does endeavor to Alarm the Nation, that for want of the
vending our superfluous Wool abroad, that the Farmer and the Landlord are so
much damnified, that the one cannot pay his Rent, nor the other sustain his
Taxes, and that this is the chiefest, if not the sole Reason of sinking our
Rents, and throwing up Farms, and the Misery of the whole Country.

This Consiquence is not allowed, that being assigned for a General Cause,
which is but one amongst many, and that a very small one; the true Cause of the
abateing the Price of Land, and lessening the Rents, shall be given in the
Answer to the next pretense in this Head; (Viz.) That it is much more the
Concern of the Nation to preserve the Nobility, Gentry, and those that the Land
of this Country belongs unto; rather than regard a few Artifficers, who are
employed in the working up of the Wool of this Nation, or to regard the
Merchant, who gains by the Exportation of our Manufacture.

I Humbly crave leave to say, that the said Argument does wholly depend upon a
Supposition, which is no way fit to be Granted, ( Viz.) as if the Interests of
the Merchant, Mariner, and Artificer, were not only Opposite to, but wholly
Inconsistent with the Interest of the Nobility, Gentry, and Farmers, whereas
there is nothing more evident than the contrary; so that the whole Argument it
Self falls for want of a Foundation. For the clearing of which let us consider,
that in as much as it is Imposible, that we should defend our selves, as an
Island, otherwise than by the strength of our Shipping, and seeing this is much
less posible to be done now, at such a Juncture of Time when our nearest
Neighbors do (partly out of Fear, and partly out of Emulation) multiply
Shipping upon us, and use all endeavors that are possible to gain the Dominion
of the Sea from us, it is hence clear, that we must either say, that the
Intrest of the Nobility, Gentry, and Farmer, is not the same with the Interest
of the Nation, or if it be the same with the Interest of the Nation, it must be
their Interest then, to uphold the Trade and Shipping of this Country, and
Consequently to uphold the Merchants.

But for as much as all that understand Trade, do well know that all the
Commerce of this Nation, does for the value and bulk of it, Entirely depend
upon the Woollen-Manufacture, Consequently it must be the Interest of the
Nobility, Gentry, and Farmer, to uphold the Woollen-Manufacture, as much as
it is to uphold Trade, or to uphold the Strength of our Shipping by Sea: For
what will the Lands of the Nobility and Gentry proffit them? or what will
become of the Privilidges and Rights of English Men, if through the Loss of our
Wollen-Manufacture, we Loose our Trade, and by the Loss of this, we want
Shipping to Defend our Selves?

To this Argument let us also add, that if there be no opposition between the
Interest of the Nobility and Gentry, and the Interest of the Farmer, (as no Man
does pretend there is) than there can be no Opposition between the Interest of
the Nobility and Gentry, and the Interest of the Artifficer, who Works up the
Wool of all he Country.

For besides the Proffit that does arise to the Nobility and Gentry, by the
Houses which are taken, and by the Lands that are Rented by the Clothiers, and
by the Workmen under them, it is well known, that the said Clothiers, and
Workmen are Serviseable to the Farmer, not only for the buying up of his Wool,
but for the buying up all manner of Victuals also; by the which not only one,
but all the parts of the Farmers Rents come to be discharged, one Clothier
Employing not only one or two Hundred Persons, but sometimes one or two
Thousand; and Consequently, if we shall admit that there are in England not
above five Thousand Clothiers, and that each of these (one with anothet) do
maintain but two Hundred and Fifty Workmen, the whole will amount to upward of
one Million; wherefore if we allow for each of these People, but four pound
Per. An. one with another; the whole will amount to between four and five
Millions of Pounds Sterling Per. An. which Yearly Sum the Farmer does
Immediately receive, and Consequently the Nobility and Gentry, from the Poor
and Contemptible Artificer, over and above what is further Contributed by them
to the Shoomakers, Tailors, and other Trades, that could not live and be
Maintained without them, nor the Farmer himself, if all these Trades should
Fail.

And this leads us also, to take notice of another mistake in my Opponent, and
such as is no small one, which is, that in as much as it is Matter of Fact, and
such as may be clearly demonstrated; that there is at least if not much more
than a Milion of Persons, employed in the Clothing-Trade, and has their
dependence wholly upon the said Manufacture: It Is hence evident, how much my
Opponent has mistaken himself in supposing, that though our Clothing-Trade
should be lost, yet all the Persons that are now employed in it, might find
work from the Farmers, foreseeing it is Matter of Fact, that the Farmer is able
to supply himself with as many Laborers, and more than he has occasion for,
without somnch as meddling with that of the Clothing-Trade: It must unavoydably
follow; that if our Manufacture should be totally lost, as there will be above
a Million of People; that must either Starve, or Beg, or be put to the Charge
of several Parishes, ot be forced to Steal or Rob, or leave the Kingdom; so
it is as evident, that the Farmer after all this, will not only be less able to
employ Laborers, than he was before, but less able to pay his Landlord, by
Four or Five Millons every Year.

And when such an Abatement as this shall be made of the Farmers Income: I
shall leaveit then to any wise Man to Consider what will become of the Price of
Lands, or Value of Rents, and how much this will advantage the Grower or
Breeder of Wool? and to make good this Computation, and free it from all
Suspision of Slightness, we shall further offer to Consideration, that
whatsoever is the true Vallue of all the Woollen-Manufacture of England, the
Nobility, Genrty, and Commonalty do receive among them, near, if not more than
Nine Parts of Ten. For inasmuch as all who are well acquainted with the
Clothing-Trade, do know that it is not a Tenth Part of the Proffit, nor
sometimes the Twentieth that is gained by the Clothier, or first Employer, who
frequently loses of the very Interest of his Money; consequently it must of
necessity follow, that Nine of the Ten Parts, if not Nine-teen of Twenty Parts
of the whole Value of the said Manufacture must be distributed to the Nation;
so that admitting the whole Wollen-Manufacture of this Nation, comprehending
Cloth, Stuffs, Bays, Stokings, and all other of the said Manufacture, do
amount to Four Millions of Pounds Sterling Per. An. (more or less) there will
not come of that Great Sum to the Clothier, or first Employer, much above Two
Hundred Thousand Pounds (if so much;) so that Three Millions and Eight Hundred
Thousand Pounds Per. An. must of necessity be distributed to the Nation by
Virtue, of the said Clothing-Trade; whereof we cannot but suppose the Farmers,
and therefore the Noblity and Gentry must receive the greater Part.

It is well known also, that it is solely by our Trade, that not only this
Great City of London it Self, but several other Large Cities of this Nation do
wholly Depend; and which if our Trade were removed, they would soon be deserted
by their respective Inhabitants.

And then we cannot but offer to Consideration, where the Nobility, Gentry, or
Farmers, would find a Market for their Commodities, or find a Price answerable
to them.

All which Particulars I have been the larger in, to remove that Mistake, which
is almost as Distructive to the Nation, as the Pestilence it Self; which is
that mentioned by my Opponent (Viz.) that the Interest of the Merchant, or the
Interest of the Cloathier and Artifficer is not Consistent with the Interest of
the Nobility and Gentry; the contrary being made sufficiently to appear.

My Opponents Third Argument is, that Wool was at twelve pound Per Pack in the
Year 1647, when Wool was Prohibited, and that in the following Year, it was
sold for sixteen pound Per Pack, but that Wool ever since by reason of the
said Prohibition, (as is pretended) is fallen of its price, and is now not
worth above four or five pound Per Pack.

In which Argument, there seems to be a Failure in two Respects, one, as if the
Wool of the Nation has never bore any Price since the time of the
Prohibition, whereas it may be made appear, that after the Year 1650, Wool
bore a very considerable Price, from ten pound Per Pack to twenty four Pound
Per Pack, according to the goodness of the said Wool, and continued so for
some time, which shows us another mistake in his Arguments, as if the fall of
the price of Wool were wholly to be ascribed to the Prohibition of it, whereas
indeed there are two other causes that are very evident.

First. From the discouragment that has been put upon the Clothier, and upon
the Vent of our Woollen-Manufacture, by the French Kings Arbitrary Impositions
upon it, to the almost utter Prohibition of it; whereby now there cannot be so
much wrought of it as formerly, which had otherwise certainly been, and then no
such occasion or pretense as this would have been taken to complain of
Superfluous Wool, and therefore as this cannot be denied to be a true cause
why more of our Wool comes to be unwrought than formerly, so it is clear that
those very Men that are now pleaded for by my Opponent, (I mean the Stealers
and Transporters of Wool about Canterbury, and the places adjacent, not for
necessity, but for filthy greediness of Gain and Lucre) have highly contributed
to it, notwithstanding the Laws of the Nation against it, and notwithstanding
the Ruin of the Nation that is Daily Jeoperdied by it, in which respect I
cannot but Confess, that Rumney-Marsh has indeed Created an Interest by it
self, but it is such an Interest, which neither is, nor has been Consistent
with the Interest of the Nation, nor with the Interest of the Nobility and
Gentry in General, so that the said Stealers or Transporters of Wool, have
been the main and principal Cause of both these Inconveniences, ( viz) both of
the Loss of our Manufacture, and the Loering the Price of our Wool.

The other Cause of the Fall of the Price of Wool, especially of late Years,
has been the Necessitating of Ireland to stock their Pasture Ground with
Sheep, instead of great Cattle, and those of the best-Breed of England, by
which means, as Wool has of late Years been more increased, then ever at any
time before within his Majesty's Dominions, so the Consequence of this
Extraordinary Increase (and not any Fault in the Clothier or Manufacturer) is
that which has not only brought down the Price, but has occasioned so great a
quantity to be sent Abroad into Foreign Parts, as it bears now almost as small
a Price beyond Sea as Here; and therefore in this Argument, my Opponent has
Assigned that for a Cause; which is no Cause at all, may clearly Appear,
because it is matter of Fact, that Wool bore as good a Price, if not a better
(after the said Prohibition as it did before) for many Years, till that breach
of Commerce which was put upon us by the French King; which we before
mentioned, and until that Unfortunate Act (for so I must Humbly crave leave to
call it) was made against the Importing the Irish Cattle, upon supposition that
it would Raise the Price of Land here in England, whereas the quite contrary
Effect has been too much Experienced ( viz) that it has Laid such a
Foundation for the Impoverishing England, as will not quickly (I fear) be
Recovered.

The next thing Alleged by my Oppoent, is, that a Limited Exportation of Wool,
will be more for the Advantage of our Woollen Trade, and less for that beyond
the Sea, than the hindering of it has been.

Which Ascertion, if my Opponent had Really, Sufficiently, and Effectually made
good, he might justly have Merited the Name, for being the greatest Master of
Reason in England.

And indeed seeing a Paradox more strange, and more hard to be Conceived, could
not easily be stated, I could not but expect, that some Arguments more
Remarkable than ordinary, would Immediately have followed it, but finding
(contrary to my Expectations) nothing beyond a bare Affermation, that if
Strangers had a Liberty to Buy what Wool soever they please, they would Pay
Dearer for it, then now they do, and that our Clothiers would therefore have it
the Cheaper, and by this Advantage would be able to under-sel the Strangers in
their Manufacture: I say finding little or nothing more, to be brought, either
by way of Reason, or of Argument, to maintain this Parradox, I was soon
convinced that it remained as incapable to be proved as it was before, and a
little to evidence the Improbability of the said Consequence, we shall here
offer some few Reasons to the Contrary.

And First I crave leave to say, that it is no way likely that the Grower in any
part of England, should not be willing to get the utmost Price for his Wool
that he can, and therefore not likely that any Grower whatsoever, will sell his
Wool to the Natives of this Country, for a less Price than he presumes he may
have of Strangers: And therefore not at all likely, that our own Manufacturers
should Buy it Cheaper than others.

Secondly. Admiting that it should be made Unlawful, for any Stranger to Buy up
Wool, till such a time or season of the Year, to the end that our Clothiers
might first Provide themselves of what they need, yet it would no way follow,
but Strangers may have their Agents and Factors here, that may Purchase it at
the same ease, with the same convenience, and at the same Rates that our
Clothiers are like to do, nor can I perceive any thing propounded by my
Opponent, that would be able in the least, either to Prevent it, or Obviate it.

Thirdly. And this great Omition in my Opponent, I could not but take the more
notice of, because if no Expedient can be found out by him (which I doubt there
will not) to prevent Strangers, from giving what Commssions they please, to Buy
up what Quantities of Wool soever they shall think fit, here in this Country;
as I see not how, or by what means, the Exportation of our Wool, should be
any way possible to be Limmited, so neither do I see how the Clothier here,
should be sufficiently; and certainly Furnished, or how the Manufacture it self
should be Capable of being any way preserved, and if these Mischiefs, and
Inconveniences cannot but follow, and cannot but be a Necessary Consequences
of such a Law, as is propounded by my Opponent; and that nothing to Obviate or
prevent these Inconveniences, has been either Regarded, or so much as
attempted by him: I cannot but take it to be a very great Blot to his Judgment,
barely and boldly to Offer at such a thing, which is attended with so much
Hazard.

Fourthly. Because my Opponent seems to to put his chiefest Stress in this,
(Viz.) that a large Custom may be put upon all Wool that is Exported by
Strangers, and that at least by this means, they may come to Pay double the
Price of what our Clothiers do, and not only so, but by this means also, his
Majesty may receive an Advantage by the Custom, that is Imposed upon it.

To try the weight or strength of this Expedient, or rather to show the Vanity
of it. Let us suppose that 3d. or 4d. Per Pound, should by a Law, be Imposed
upon all Wool, that shall be Shipped out by Strangers; or others, as it will not
follow, that the said Custom should be Paid to his Majesty, for one half of
the Wool, that shall be so Shipped out: Seeing under the Color of one Hundred
Packs, many Hundred may be Exported. So this will much the less follow, from
the very Observation; which my Opponent himself has made, of the nature, of
the Stealers or Transporters of Wool; for if as he Confesses they will be
contended with 12d. a day profit so they may play the Merchants; and if they
are content to run the hazard of their Necks, and to be tried as Fellons, for
so small a matter as this a mounts to, which cannot be above 8, or 10s. upon a
pack, how much more then, will they be encouraged to steal the Custom of it
when their excuse shall be fairer, and their advantage much greater, and the
hazard less a hundred times then now it is? but in the fifth and last place,
let us admit for Arguments sake, that if 4l. was imposed upon every Pack of
Wool that was Transported, and let us admit, that all this Custom was duly
Paid, yet I see not the least Ground for my Opponents Confidence, that we shall
for this Cause be able to undersell the French, in the VVoollen-Manufacture.

For beside that the Nature of their Manufacture being but slight; and such as
takes up much less Wool then ours does, and a great part of their warps, being
made of their finespun Linen and their own course Wool: I say besides this,
the Impositions that have been of late, Arbitralily put upon all our
VVoollen-Manufacture in France; and considering also there is no Custom at all
put upon Wool there, when Imported, both these will utterly prevent, our
Selling the said Manufacture there, Cheaper than the French can make it, though
they shall not only give double, but treble the Price, that we our Selves do
give for Wool.

The next thing Alleged by my Opponent is, that our Forefathers did never
Prohibit the Transportation of Wool, unless upon some great Occasion, and for
a certain Season, till of late Years, for making good of which, a Summary of
several Statutes, are brought from the Time of Edward the 3d. downwards to our
Times.

For answer to all which Statute, I shall make use of no other Argument, than
what my Opponent himself has put into my Mouth, which is; that Wool was for
many Ages, by the Wisdom of the Government, at least very often Prohibited; and
that whenever the Govenment it self saw, there was a greater Occasion than
ordinary for it, they did always Prohibit it; and Consequently, if the
Interest of the Nation at present be such, and the circumstances relating to
our Neighbors about us, be not only so great, but so Instant and Importune,
that these two considered, there will be much more Reason, and much more
Necessity, for the Prohibiting of it now, than formerly.

Then all that my Opponent labors at, in producing Instances of other Kinds,
and where the Circumstances are not the same, falls wholly to the Ground; for
the clearing of which, let us consider, that the Circumstances peculiar to this
present Time are, that we have not only been Possessed for many Ages, of the
Manufacturing of our Wool, but have of late so Improved our Trade and Commerce
by it, that we have Exported it by Shipping of our own, not only into France,
Portugal and Spain, but into Italy, Turkey, and to the remotests Parts of the
World.

By which means, as our Wealth came greatly to Increase, so we our selves
became more Powerful in Shipping than ever, which greatness of our Trade and
the Strength of our Shipping being not only Observed, but forthwith Emulated by
some of our Neighbors, and seeing it was likewise clearly discerned, that the
chiefest means for the Maintenance of it proceeded from our
Woollen-Manufacture, as the Hollander therefore first, so the French since,
have by many undue Laws and Pressures upon us, contrary to the ancient
Treaties of Peace and Commerce, endeavored to Rob the said Manufacture from us.

Nor is the state of the Contest now at present between us only, who shall have
the Trade, but who is fittest to have the Strength and Dominion of the Sea.

Wherefore if my Opponent be not only an Islander, but so much an Englishman,
and be so true a Subject to the Interest of his Majesty, which I doubt not but
he is, as to think there is none so fit as his Majesty to Command the Sea,
then my Opponent must of necessity grant, that nothing ought at this time to be
done by us, that may hazard the greatness of our Trade and Commerce, and
Consequently, that nothing ought to be suffered by us, (so far as we are able
in any wise to prevent it) that may either lessen or endanger our
Woollen-Manufacture, and Consequently, if nothing can so much hazard it, and
hazard the very loss of our Trade, and of the Dominion of the Sea it self
through it, as the countenancing and contributing to the Woollen-Manufacture
now set up in France, then this is not to be done by us, but is rather, if we
will pursue the Interest of the Nation, by all means to be prevented by us.

And Consequently till my Opponent shall be able to make it appear, that the
Dominion of the Sea, if lost, will be no great harm to us, or till he make it
appear, that we are able to keep the Dominion of the Sea; even, notwithstanding
our Trade and Commerce should be utterly lost, and notwithstanding our
Woollen-Manufacture, should be wholly carried away by our Neighbors.

Or till he make it appear by other Arguments than hitherto he has done, that
the French though they increase their Woollen-Manufacture, will neither be able
to Under-sell us abroad, nor be able to prevent our Clothes and Stuffs from
going into France, as formerly.

I say till my Opponent shall be able to make good all these things, I must
crave leave to differ from him wholly, and plainly to affirm on the contrary.

1. That the Transportation of Wool, if allowed by a Law, can no way be
Limited. Because if the Transportation of Wool shall be allowed by a Law, no
means, (speaking rationally) is able to prevent the Hollanders, Flandrians,
and French, to give each of them such Commissions as they please, to Buy up
here what quantity of Wool soever, they shall think fit.

2. In regard that this can no way be prevented, and that my Opponent himself
offers not the least grain of an Expedient toward it: I therefore farther
affirm, that it cannot appear that our Clothiers or Manufacturers here, shall
have the least Privilege above the Stranger; either in point of Provision, or
point of Price.

3. That our Clothier, or Manufacturer here, must of necessity have a far
greater disadvantage, with reference to the furnishng himself, than the
Stranger abroad, in regard it cannot be thought, he shall be able to raise any
such stock of Money as the Stranger can, to prevent the Strangers Forstaling of
him; and Consequently (if it be Lawful to talk Reason) there can be no ground
to Imagine, that our Manufacture shall not in short time be utterly lost, and
this being lost, as our Trade and strength at Sea must be Inevitably lost with
it, so not only the Honor, Wealth and Rents, but the very Privileges,
Liberty, and Property of the Nation, must be hazarded to such Strangers as
shall carry away the Trade and strength from us.

As to the next Allegation, made by my Opponent, (Viz.) that the Transportation
of Wool, will better his Majesty's: Customs I see but little in it that may
require my Answer to it, inasmuch, as I have spoken already to this, under the
Fourth head: Nevertheless I must crave leave to say, that my Opponent here also
goes upon an extraordinary Mistake, it being not at all in dispute between us,
whether his Majesty's Customs would be bettered if a Subsidy were paid only
for that Wool that is now Exported, instead of having it all stolen: But the
dispute between us strictly is, what his Majesty's Customs will hereafter
amount to, Comparatively to what they at present now are, in case there should
be a Law for the free and Unlimited Exportation of Wool, and that by reason of
this Law, and the Consequences that must follow from it, our
Woollen-Manufacture shall come to be wholly and entirely lost: For it becomes
not a wise Man (and such I must in Civility Judge my Opponent to be) in making
such Proposals as tend to the altering of Laws, to look at the present only,
but to look more principally at the time to come.

And therefore it is not in this case at all, to be considered what the
advantage will be, that may come to his Majesty's Customs for a few months,
or a single Year, but it is to be considered, what the advantage or
disadvantage will be to his Majesty's Customs for the time to come; admitting
these Inconveniences, which I have before mentioned to be unavoydable, from
the Law which is Propounded by my Opponent.

Besides my Opponent cannot doubtless be so Ignorant, as not to have
Considered, that the greatness of his Majesty's Customs (which is at this Day
greater than ever) is not at all Raised Comparatively from the Export but from
the Import, which is 10. if not 20. times greater than the Export, the Vallue
of all which Import must proportionally fall, as the quantity of our
Manufactury shall fail to be carried out, and as our raw and unwrought Wool
alone shall instead of it be Exported, and Consequently to pretend that by such
a Law as is desired, his Majesty's Customs would be advanced, is either
greatly to betray Ignorance, or greatly to betray the Revenues of the Customs
it self.

The next thing alleged by my Opponent is, that the cause of the decay of our
Clothing does not lie in the Exportation of our Wool, but on the contrary,
(Viz.) because our Wool is no more freely Exported than it is, and that we may
be sure not to mistake his Sense, herein he further adds, that inasmuch as the
decay and fall of our Manufacture, comes properly from the Prohibition of our
Wool, the stopping or hindering of it is but the applying to our Disease a
wrong Remedy.

Which Argument, had it been brought by a Stranger, we should immediately have
turned it into Merriment, as supposing that he thought us such Children, that
any thing would easily Deceive us? but being brought by a Gentleman, and an
Englishman, I confess I could not possibly think what might be the meaning of
it, unless it were, that my Opponent was resolved to cross the Proverb for a
while, and by a piece of Wit to make it appear, that it is not always True,
that Interest cannot Lie; for that nothing can be more contrary to Truth, than
what is here alleged, ot more against the Interest of the Nation, and of an
Englishman than what is here Asserted, (if that be the very Interest of my
Opponent) is most Clear.

For if it be True which my Opponent says, that the decay of our
Clothing-Trade, is not from our Exportation of Wool, but rather the Contrary,
because no more of our Wool is not Carried out Raw and Un-Manufactured, it
must follow then, by how much the more our Wool is thus Exported, by so much
the more our Manufacture will not only be Preserved, but Encouraged, and the
Reason for this must needs be, that if we are once rid of our Wool, and have
got a good Price for it, we need not trouble our heads so far as to Imagine,
that they who Buy it will do any thing with it, but only will lay it up to look
upon it: For if we shall Seriously Believe that they will have so much Wit as
to make Use of it, and to make Use of it as becomes Rational Persons, in order
to the Increase of their own Clothing by it, we cannot be so sottish as to
think, that they do intend after this to Buy our Manufacture any more, but do
on the contrary design to prevent, and shut out the Importation of it, as a
thing not Expedient for them.

And if this and no other be really the intent of Buying up of our Wool by our
Neighbors, then must it not necessarily follow, that by how much the more
Wool they have, by so much the more Manufacture they will make for the
Furnishing themselves, and Furnishing their Neighbors, and then by so much the
less Place, or Possibility, there will be that we should be able to Furnish
them, and then also by so much the greater stop must of necessity be put to the
Vending of our Cloths: And is it not plain that by how much the less we Vend of
our Manufacture, by reason of the Increase of it abroad in other Places, by so
much the more our Manufacture must decay: Not only in point of Price, but in
point of its Necessity and Use?

And is it not then as manifest, that by how much our Manufacture Decays, our
Trade must Decay, and our Wealth must Decay, and the Strength of our Shipping
must Decay, and we our selves must be the more made a Scorn, a Prey, and a
Laughing Stock by it to our Neighbors: And if all this be not for the Interest
of the Nation, but the contrary wholly, is it not plain that my Opponent,
seeing he is an Englishman, and seeing it is for the Interest of the Nation
that he Writes, does cross the Proverb, and give us a Demonstration by his thus
Arguing, that Interest may now and then Lie, though not always?

But in the next place, to try whether my Opponent be in earnest, or not, let
me humbly Beg of him, to tell me truly, why those naughty Men that Usurped the
Government in the Year 1647. did upon such Penalties strictly Prohibit the
Exportation of our Woolls; if he says, it was because they were not only
Rebels, but Men of no Reason, and Understood not the Interest of the Nation:
Will he not by this brand many of the Parliament also that now sits? who though
they did not Confirm the Rebels Law, did think fit at least to make a new Law
to the same purpose, even soon after his Majesty's most happy Restoration.

Granting then that the Laws now in force of the 12 and 14 of his Majesty's
Reign, were not made by other, than by the Wisest and most Loyal Persons of
this Nation, the said Persons must consequently have some grounds or other for
making of the said Laws, and if we may guess at their grounds by their own
words in the preambles of the said Laws, they appear mainly to be these three
following, ( Viz.)

1. For the setting on Work the Inhabitants of these Realm. 2. For the
Improving the native Commodities of this Country, to its best, fullest, and
utmost Use. 3. And that the advantage accruing hereby might Redound to the
Subjects of this Kingdom, and not to the Subjects of foreign Realms, as
hitherto, and as it would, and must otherwise do.
WHerefore, either these three grounds, when the said Laws were made, were
either good and sufficient Motives for the Prohibiting our Wool, and for the
laying so great a Penalty upon such as should Export it, or they were not: If
my Opponent shall say, they were not good and sufficient Grounds, then he must
say that the Wisdom of these Honorable and Loyal Persons, who at that time
served in Parliament, were indeed not much better than that of the Usurpers of
the Government in the Year 1647. But if the said grounds were Good, Valid, and
Sufficient, and such as did both Regard and Comprehend the True and Sincere
Interest of the Nation; then my Opponent must confess, that the said Laws ought
to Stand, or he must show wherein the Case is altered now, from what it was
then, with reference to the said Motives or Grounds, that the said Parliament
then went upon, in making the said Laws. For,

1. If my Opponent can make it appear by letters that he has lately received,
that the Hollanders have laid down their Woollen-Manufacture, and that they in
France are altogether grown Sick and Weary of it, and that the French King
has wholly forbidden it, and has released all the Impositions that he has of
late Years put upon it, then I must needs confess the Case is altered, and that
the sd. Laws ought Justly to be Repealed; or, 2. If my Opponent has received
Information from sure and good Hands, that the Hollanders make use of no other
Wool than that of their own Growth, though they breed few or no Sheep; and
that he has also received Information from good and sure Hands, that the
French make use only of their own Wool in all their Manufacture; or, 3. If my
Opponent can make it appear, that the setting on Work the Inhabitants of this
Realm, is not now a thing so convenient or fit, as it was when the said Acts
were made; or, 4. If the Improving the Native Commodities of this Country to
its best and utmost Use, be found by Experience to be no good Policy, but to
bring many Inconveniences with it; or, 5. If it be much more advisable that
Forreiners should go away with the Gain of our Manufacture, and with the sweet
of our Trade, rather than that his Majesty's Subjects should have it, in all
these Cases I must confess, it must Inevitably be for the Interest of the
Nation to Repeal the said Acts, and lay them aside.
But on the other hand, if none of all these Five Cases can possibly be put,
and that those very Reasons and Grounds do still remain, and are the same now,
which they were when the said Acts were made.

Then my Opponent's motion to Repeal the said Laws, must be against the
Interest of the Nation, or Interest does not always speak True; which was the
Paradox intended to be Argued by my Opponent.

As it is clear then, that by both these Arguments, my Opponent has wholely
mistaken himself in the Cause of our Manufactures decay, to evidence yet
farther the manifestness, and palpableness of this mistake, we affirm that it
is Matter of Fact, that our Woollen Manufacture did greatly increase after the
sd. Prohibition of Wool; and not only increased, but bore a good Price, and
that I may not be found like some others, who regard not the Credit of what
they affirm (and particularly, like him who has contracted the Arguments of my
Opponent, and has published them together in one Sheet of Paper) I shall to
justify what I say, appeal for the Truth of it, not only to the Custom House
Books, and to the quantity of the Woollen-Manufacture there entered; but to the
Gentry themselves: And to the Price that the Land bore (and Victuals) for many
Years together after the sd. Prohibition.

Yea, as our Manufacture did increase for many years together, after the sd.
Prohibition of the Exportation of Wool, so it had to this day still increased,
had not those accidents happened, that laid so effectual a Foundation for the
ruin of it, as it was neither in the Power of the Clothier, nor in the Power
of the Grower to prevent: I mean those new and immoderate Taxes, which were
laid upon our Manufacture by the French King, on purpose to encourage his own
workmen to gain the sd. Manufacture from us; and on purpose to prevent our
Cloths and Stuffs from being brought into his Country, (the Fruits of
Exportation of Wool) although we yearly take of his Commodities, to the value
of above a Million of Pounds Sterling, and I mean in the second place, the
making of that unfortunate Act against the Importation of Irish Cattle, which
has not only tended to the ruin of the Grower, but to the ruin of the
Clothier, and to ruin of the very Trade of England it self; and which if it
should continue to stand un-repealed, must necessarily, and inevitably ruin
more and more: Both the Gentry, Merchant, and Clothier every day.

And therefore as a further Proof of what I say I shall give one instance
instead of many, and leave the Truth of it to be strictly examined, and judged
accordingly; which is, that since the said accidents have befallen us (I mean
of the French Kings Arbitrary Impossitions upon us, and that Act against the
Importation of Irish Cattle) Exeter alone, has lost of what it did formerly
Vend, near, if not above three Hundred Thousand Pound Sterling every Year: And
if we shall reckon Proportionably for all other Countries and Cities, we shall
then easily see there is a Just Ground for the Decay of our
Woollen-Manufacture, and for the fall of the Price of our Wool by it, and for
the fall and ruin of our Rents, not as my Opponent Allegeath by reason of the
Prohibition of of Transporting our Wool, but truly and really by reason of the
Multiplication and Increase of our Wool, to that degree, that the Exportation
of it has almost been Necessary.

The serious consideration of which true and real cause of the decay of our
Manufacture, I shall humbly leave to the Wisdom of the Parliament. And shall
likewise leave it to their Wisdom to be considered, whether in this Conjucture
of Affairs, and according to the Circumstances which now attend Us, while our
Neighbors do not only Emulate us, but are become actual Rivals with us, not
only for our Clothing, but for our Trade it self; and for our Strength and
Dominion at Sea, we shall, or ought so far to contribute toward the Design,
and toward the Certainty and Effectualness of our own Ruin, as either to
Repeal our Acts that Prohibit the Exportation of our Wool, or to let that
Unfortunate Act stand, which makes the Transporting absolutely necessary,
whether we will or no, and by this means make our Neighbors scorn the Commerce
and Trade they formrely had with us, and thanked us for it.

And whereas my Opponent does lay a great stress upon the false making of our
Manufacture, as one cause of the decay of it, I cannot but confess there has
been to much and to great cause for that Complaint, we ought therefore to
consider the maine reason thereof, ( Viz.) that as the said Manufacture for a
great part is under no manner of Regulation, yea not so much as it may not be
restrained to an Apprentiship, by which means, persons Unskilful, and Unable
also in point of Estate, undertaks it, having got some credit, and when they
have got a considerable Estate of other persons into their hands, in a little
time Breaks, not only to the great loss of their Creditors, but to the
dishonor of our Woollen-Manufacture, and the Nation it felf; Instances to many
may be given, (the like may be said of Merchandice when Irregular,) but though
this Abuse has not been Redressed, notwithstanding which, the generallity of
the most Substantial Clothiers, though not tied to it by any Law, has for
their own Repute and Advantage, made such an alteration in the making our said
Manufacture, that neither Dutch, nor French, (whose Fancies we are apt to
follow) do come near us, either for the Accuratness and Goodness of our
Workmanship, or for the Honesty and Integrity, that is used in making both of
Cloth, Stuffs and Bays.

And that I may here Vindicate the Credit of what I Say, and that it may be
Clear, I Speak nothing but Truth, I shall Appeal to the most considerable
Dealers in all London either as Merchants, Drapers or Mercers, whether there be
not many Clothiers, many Stuff and Bay-Makers, who tho they be under no Check
at all at present; do nevertheless so Value their Name, their Word and their
Repute, that they dare Adventure all the Commodity they make, to be Forfeited,
if it do not prove as Long as Broad, and as truly Made and as well Quallified,
yet there are many both Drapers, Mercers, and Merchants, who will trust to the
private Mark of diverse Clothiers, with less Scruple then they will trust to the
stamp of some sorts of Coin.

Yea I should much wrong many of the Clothiers of England, if I should not upon
this occasion professedly declare, (and whoever denies it, will greatly Injure
them) that such is the sense which they themselves have had for diverse Years,
how much it is for their Interest, and for the Name and Honor of the English
Nation it self, to keep up an exact goodness in all the Woollen-Manufacture of
this Kingdom, that they have for many Years, not only Solicited the Parliament,
that they might be Incorporated in each County, and that none might be admited
to take upon them the making of Cloth, and other Woollen-Manufactures, but such
only as have served a due number of Years, to learn the profession of it, might
be sufficiently Versed and Skilled in it; but they have for many Years desired
also, that all and every the sorts of the Woollen-Manufacture, might be brought
to such a certainty of Regulation for the Length and Breadth of each
Manufacture, and for the true Making of it, that it may not be in the Power of
any Unskilful or Deceitful Person to Falsify it, but that by marks of their
own, as is used in Colchester Bays, all manner of Cheats and Defects should be
openly signified; than which I humbly conceive there is scarce any thing can be
instanced that might, or would tend more to the general good and advantage of
this Nation, and to the promoting and recovering of our Manufacture again, and
Consequently for the Consumption and Advancing the Price of our Wool, which is
the thing mainly my Opponent seems to drive at, and in thatwe shall agree.

But here my Opponent may parhaps say, that after all I cannot deny, but there
is a surplus of Wool which cannot be wrought up by the Clothiers, and that I
offered not one word, how it should for the future be disposed of: (to which I
answer)

1. That it appears not by any thing which mp Opponent has hitherto said, at
least not by any thing that he has hitherto proved, that the Clothier either
cannot or does not work up the Wool of the proper growth of England to the
full of it, but if a far greater quantity of Wool be brought into England from
Ireland then ever until of late Years, as the Clothier cannot be Responsible
for his not Buying up all the Wool which is sent into England so neither can
he or ought he to be Responsible for the Glut proceeding from the Importation
of it, or for the cheapness of the said Wool, by reason of the said Glut.
Notwithstanding which Glut I may presume to say, (or at least to suppose) that
if an account was taken both in Ireland and England before the time of
shearing, there will not be found one quarters Gronth, or at the most 6 Months
Vn-manufactured, in the greatest Year of plenty of Wool and dullness of Trade;
which duly confidered, does require more care for a stock beforehand in
England, and not to suffer it to Engrossed and Stored up in France and Holland
as now it is: And for ought I know would there be a Peace concluded abroad,
that our Trade was Revived, and our Clothiers were Encouraged, we might find a
want of Wool before the next shearing; notwithstanding our great complaint of
a Surplus of Wool, as it has frequently accurd in Corn very lately, and more
formerly as in St. Walter Rawly's Remains.

2. If the proper and only way for removing all evil effects, be to remove
their respective causes, and that this is and must be acknowledgec by all
rational Persons, then considering what we have said before, and not only said
but proved and made it appear, ( Viz.) that the cause of the said Surplus of
Wool (with the Cheapness of it at present) among us, is partly from the Irish
Act that Prohibiteth the bringing in of live Cattle, and puts the Kingdom upon
the Breeding of Wool whether they will or no, and partly by the Decay of our,
Manufacture, through the supply that we our selves do make to our Neighbors of
our own Wool, fur the Promoting of their Manufacture, to the Ruin of our
Selves.

The proper Remedy then, for the removeing the Cheapness of our Wool on the
one hand, and Employing our Poor, and Recovering of our Trade on the other
hand, must necessarily be the Stoping the Excesive Grouth of it in Ireland, and
as Strictly Stopping, and Restreining the Export of it from Ireland, and from
hence.

And here Imust take the Boldness to say again, what I have in part said
already in my second Argument, ( Viz.) that where a Nation is not Rich in Mines
of Gold and Silver, it is not capable of being Enriched any other way, than by
its Manufacture.

And consequently if it be from our Manufactures alone, that the Riches of this
Nation comes, and if it be from our Manufacture chiefly that our Shipping is
Employed, and our Mariners bred, if it be from our Trading alone, and from the
Riches which our Trading brings in, that his Majesty's Customs are Raised, and
that our Fleet have been hitherto Built and Maintained, and the Dominion of the
Seas has been Preserved, than it is and must be from our Manufacture only that
our Bullion has been brought in, and that the Rents of our Nobility and Gentry
does Depend and are Sustained.

And therefore it must be granted me, that there is no higher Interest in the
Nation, than that which preserves his Majesty's Customs, and that which
Sustains the Nobility and Gentrys Rents, and that which Supports our Navy and
Shipping.

Then in regard our Manufacture alone does by all this, our Manufacture alone
and the Encouragement of it must necessarily be the greater Interest of the
Nation it self: And I must crave leave to say that whoever places it in any
thing elce (as the circumstances of this Nation stands at present) must either
mistake the Interest of this Nation, or can be no Friend to England.

Wherefore if it be granted by the Wisest of Layers, that a Mischief is better
than an Inconvenience, some private Men ought to suffer rather than the whole
Nation: Which I humbly conceive is a sollid and sufficient answer to my
Opponent, as to this part of his Objection.

Supposing also that our Manufacture and the Encourageing of it, is the main
and chief, if not the sole and only Interest of the Nation, then as no Interest
besides can, or ought in reason to stand in Competition with it, so much less
the Irish Act, without the Repealing of which; Nevertheless it is simply
Impossible, that either our Manufacture, or that the Trade, or Navigation of
the Kingdom should be preserved: For if there be no reason to make a Law that
they must Starve in Ireland, there can be no reason to forbid their breeding of
Sheep, if we will not let them employ their Lands in the breeding of Cattle.

Admitting also that the pasture Lands of Ireland are proportionable to the
bigness of that Kingdom, far larger than the pasture Lands of England, as they
are and must necessarily be, partly through the smalness of their Tillage,
(their Corn being not capable to be Exported) and partly through the thinness
of their Inhabitants, and it must necessarily follow, that these being
converted mostly to the feeding of Sheep, must breed a vast quantity of Wool,
and such as must equal, if not Exceed the quantity bred in England, by our
selves.

Wherefore it must needs be plain to every person, that not only the breeding
of Wool, but the disposing of it, andt he disposing of it to most Advantage,
is now become the Interest of the Nobility, Gentry, Yeomandry, and of all
others whatsoever that have a concern in Ireland, which if it were possible to
prevent, it ought to be allowed to none besides our Selves, whose whole proper
and entire Interest it is, to be Sole Manufacturers, or Workers of it.

The Breeding, Growing, Disposing and Improving of Wool, being now by our
Selves, made the entire Interest of Ireland, who desired it not of us, and
would have been very well Content without it, if we cannot desire their
Nobility, or Gentry, to burn their Wool, we cannot then deny them, to take all
such Lawful and Just Courses, whereby they may Improve their Wool.

Wherefore seeing these Courses can be but two ways, either to send it where
it is most wanted, and where it will yield the best Price, which is to our
Neighbors, to Improve and Increase their Manufacture, or else to keep it
themselves, and Manfacture it up in that Country.

And seeing one of these Courses are wholly Inevitable, and that both one and
the other do not only tend, but must and will certainly, and effectually bring
an utter destruction to the Trade, Commerce, Strength, Shipping and Navigation
of this Kingdom, we have small reason to expect our Neighbors the Dutch, or
our Neighbors the French should help us, or pity us, when we do wilfully
contribute to the Ruin of our Selves, and may (if we will) either prevent it,
or easily remedy it.

And indeed if our All be at stake, by reason of the continuance of that
Unfortunate Act; and if this All, I mean the very Interest of the Nation it
self, will not move us to alter it, I think it would be very Impertinent, to
insist upon lesser Arguments.

And therefore, though it would be for the Interest of the Nation greatly, to
arrest this occation, I mean the cheapness of Wool, to beat out our
Neighbors, in the Foreign Trade of our Manufactures, and by Under-selling
them at least Abroad.

And though this might now more easily be done then ever, seeing our
Mauufacture is Improved of late Years in the Goodness of it, and might soon as
we said before, be brought to an Absolute Perfection.

And though it be but Equal and Just, to Forbid the Commodities of those
Countries that are near us, who refuse to deal with us for our Commodities, or
by Exorbitant and Arbitrary Impositions laid upon them, do in efect Prohibit
them; and though the doing of this, is but agreeable to the rules of Justice,
and to the Law of Nations, and Law of Commerce.

Though also it cannot be denied, that it must be greatly consistant with the
public good of the Nation, to make sumptuary Laws, and to restrain the excess
that is at present among Us; yet I must humbly crave leave to say, that this is
but like the taking much pains, to stop the leaks of a Barrel, and let the
Liquor run out at the Bung; for these are all petty things to the main Concern
of the Nation which must be Ruined, and Ruined, as I humbly Conceive
Irrecoverably, if the Irish Act does stand.

FINIS.
