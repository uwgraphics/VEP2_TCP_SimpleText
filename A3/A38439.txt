ENGLANDS Tears and Lamentation For her lost Friend PEACE, AND Her comfort for
the continuance of TRVTH:

OR Truth and Peace justly pleaded for, and truly Petitioned for, by him that
is neither Factious nor self-affected; but only desires the prosperity of his
Country, and that Peace and the Gospel may be joined together, without which we
shall never expect to live in Unity.

London, Printed for William Ley. 1642.

A Moderate Plea for Truth and Peace, or Truth and Peace reconciled.
WEre I indewed with the demure and seraphicall patience of Solomon, or
enriched with the glistering Rethorique of Aristotle, then might I hope to
persuade this depraved dissipated age, to lay aside there study of parties to
part all, and sweetly insinuate persuasive reasons, that might win the spirits
of this irrational rage, seriously to lay their hands on their hearts, before
the days come wherein we may all say we have no pleasure in them, and weigh in
deepest Judgment the direful judgments that begin to pain and pinch us all,
and look upon them not only as the fruits of pernicious counsel and
Counselors, but the black web of all our weavings, the sad presages of
Jerusalems, Germanies, Irelands line drawing over England, let every one mend
one, each party quarrel with their own persons, and every man look into his
own bosom, and he shall there see and read the tokens of an angry God: England
has abused the height of sweetest and dearest mercies, and in stead of being
alured and won to serve that God who has been the Donor, Jesuram has waxed
fat and kicked, and in the middst of our mercies we have forgotten the God of
our mercies, and therefore (as Chrysostom sadly and seriously) it is just with
God, that we that would not remember our God nor our selves, should be plagued
in forgetting both, and now Ephram is against Manasses and both against Judah,
and most against God, O how happy should I think my self if I might write a
word in due season, and all wou^d look on it as apples of gold in pictures of
silver, that while some are earnest Proctors for a pernicious peace without
Christian terms, in a word most neglect truth under pretended zeal for peace,
and many are posessed with zeal without discretion, and the general seek
neither with christian moderation, Oh times! Oh manners! what strange times are
we falen into, that none or few are found really to be fillii veritatis and
alum in pacis, lovers of truth and peace: it is a Paradox in our age to love
both, dreadful must be our condition and bitterness in the end, if there be
found never a Moses that has a fire of holy zeal, to rebuke and correct the
people for Idolatry, and a meek mind to pray and seek their peace. Is not every
man that i^ worthy the name of a Christian resolved into grief, to see the
winters distemper of our age, which is such, that the love of many if not most
is grown cold to truth and peace, truth much obscured, depraved, blemished,
prejudiced, undermined, discountenanced, surprised: peace very crazie and sadly
shaken, not only with rumors of wars and preparation for war, study of sides
and parties to pierce us all, not only great division of thoughts, pertinacy in
opinions breeding disaffections, and now disaffections dreadfully flaming into
open contentions and hostilities, so far as from the strife of pens and
tongues, writing and disputing, we are come to the terror of war, each party
contending who shall obtain that -- woeful self destroying, which without God
work wonders, will make none but death Victor I say, but let these taste but a
little of the miseries of war, they would know it is there, as Socrates said it
was in marriage, applying the similitude of the fishes, they that are without
the net would fain be in, but they that are within would more fain be out, they
that finding some discontent in peace called for war to ease them, would do as
the old man did in the fable, who being heavy laden, threw his burden down and
called for death to take him out of the world, but when death appeared ready to
satisfy his desire, to put it off, desired him to help him up with his burden,
as though he had called him for nothing else.

Oh blessed peace thou crownest thy year with thy goodness, and thy paths
drop fatness, and blessed have thou bin o England, and our eyes might have
been blessed in beholding thee in the triumphs of peace, where we have seen
plenty triumphing over famine in the country, riches triumphing over poverty in
the City, learning triumphing over ignorance in the University, Justice almost
triumphing over vice in the Kingdon, and the King triumphing over danger in the
loyalty of his Subjects: these are the triumphs of peace; and the God of peace
restore and continue this peace, that the fury of war may never turn this
Paradise into a Wilderness, nor make England which has been a Map of Majesty
to other Nations, a Map of confusion, and let us say, beati pacifici, after our
Savior, blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the Children of
God, and let the blessing of our heavenly father crown His Majesty's Royal
head with gray hairs; the silver crown of age, let God create the fruits of the
lips peace, let that precious ointment which was richly shed upon the head of
our high Priest Christ Jesus, descend to the skirts of his clothing, with an
influence of like virtue, that as our Savior healed the woman's issue of blood,
so he may stanch the bleeding wounds of Church and state, that has put it self
under his protection, and that his sacred Majesty may speedily decline all
pernicious counsels, and deliver into the hands of justice, all crafty
Achitophells, that Prince and people may shout for joy, in seeing the nuptial
day of peace and truth, which has as great a share in both as the former truth
being the foundation, peace the lovely structure and building, the same Christ
that said blessed are the peacemakers, with the same blessed mouth said
blessed are the pure in heart, which cannot be enjoyed without truth; though it
be granted, which is as much as can be granted, that peace is the felicity of
the Saints of heaven, the glory of the blessed Angels, the desire of nations,
the royalty of God himself, yet let wise men consider, that without truth,
these heights and the highest with reverence be it spoken, were but as sounding
brass and a tinckling Symboll; if peace be the felicity of the Saints, if
truth were not in it would not it is beauty wither? it is silver become dross,
and it is gold tin? say it be the glory of Angels, were that glory worth the
having, if this ingredient were not in it: and let the height of honor be set
as a crown of incomparable gold, and precious stones on its head, and let men
men believe it is the royalty of God himself, yet without this let us cover our
faces in speaking being we are not: Truth is the most transcendent glory of the
devine Majesty, if we may say God is capable of degrees, all the glorious
attributes of God receive there being from this, which if I speak as it is, is
no less then God himself in his height of blessedness, this truth is the
increated light of the Intelectuall world, shining from God to Angels and men,
and let men's hearts harp on this, that peace is the desire of nations, what is
peace without Truth? not peace but the shadow of peace enjoyed without truth
loved, is to use Solomon's; phrase like a jewel of pearl in in a swines snoat,
and let me speak and all England hear, had truth blessed truths fundamentalls
at least bin holily and thankfully received, peace had never departed, had
truth been better welcome and more desieed by all, peace had never taken it is
leave so suddenly and sadly, and the only way to have peace restored in purity
and perfection, is to purge our hearts, and then seek Gods peace, and if none
this blood not of nation but of our nation purge us; then blessed shall we be
that are in such a case, ye happy that have the Lord fully and reconciledly for
our God, and then the other I say of truth and peace as the author of both in
another case, those whom God has joined together let no man dare to put
asunder, as men naturally incline to follow that Petition with ardency, Lord
send peace in our days, so let them with as much fervency and sincerity,
contend for that of David's, that righteousness and peace may kiss each other,
and let that heart, tongue and hand, sinck, perish, and wither, that will not
say Amen.

Truth and peace like a loving couple, they seek the preservation of each
others estate, and like Hypocrates twins they laugh together, and are like
affected: survey their sweet congruity, and you will say as a lovely couple, it
were sin and pity to part them, truth and peace being bona publica and
universalia, Docte^ Gauden in his seasonable Sermon n before the truly Honorable
Huose of Commons.
truth for the soul, peace for the body and state, every one has a share and
interest in the^, Prince, Peers, and people: Behold with judicious eyes, and
weigh with judgment the vanity, folly, misery, impossibility of real
injoyning one without the other, ponder, and ponder wisely, meekly, moderately,
ruminate with serious and saddest thoughts on this, all ye that neglect the
fair opportunities of peace, and look upon it with a foolish disdain like a coy
dame on a loving suitor, whom after she has slighted and neglected, would upon
second thoughts gladly embrace with dearest affections when too late, but other
guests will soon be invited, nay come ryding on the wings of the wind; and
peace will dwell within our walls and plenteousnesse in our palaces, therefore
let not any sons of Belial blow any longer the fire of contention, and in
seeking their own ends, endeavor to end all. Let not the Prince wage war
rashly, but remember the advice given to Augustus, to repeat all the letters of
his Alphabet when he was angry before he do any thing, and our dread Sovereign
should do well to try all his let^e^s, all his learning, all his skill first,
all his Counsel, before he engage his Royal Person, loving and loyal
Subjects, in an unnatural war; and let him not proceed to war implacably;
Hercules club they say was made of Olive, an emblem of peace, and peace must
there be desired where war cannot be warranted, Oh that God would persuade his
Royal heart not to go to war, but as An dronicus proceeded to the execution of
justice with the saying of St. Paul, in his mouth and heart, non quod volo
bonum facio, etc. the good I would I do not, and the evil I would not that do
I, and resolve with our Savior, if my right eye offend me and my people, I
will pluck it out, and if my right hand offend justly, I will cut it off,
better one or few I account dear should perish then the whole body be
inevitably lost, and let our right Honorable Parliament say as they have often,
so God may be glorified, the King truly honored, Haman hanged, the people
blessed in the enjoyment of truth and peace, let our honor lie in the dust,
our estates wast, our pleasures and profits be known no more.

And let all men pray for King and Parliament, and that those that God has
joined together, those may be accursed that ere part asunder, and let none
sinfully prefer an unwarrantable unjust peace, before a just war, least the
just God teach them better divinity by the rod of severity; all know God
justified Isreal's war, with his Brother Benjamine, and commanded war with
Amalech; War in it self is an appeal to heaven by a sword, when other ways
of Justice upon earth, either by witness, oaths, or Leagues are made void,
and invallid; and Religion is a greater happiness then peace, Religion is just
so much the best of blessings as God is the best of beings, a p;entifull table
to feed the body without profitable discourse to feed the mind, is little
better then a manger, Israel had 3. crowns as Talmud observes, of the King, of
the Priest, of the Law, but the crown of the Law was the chief of the three;
in a word let peace and truth be in all men's lives and loves, truth as the
roots, peace as the fruits, and;et a;; desire nothing more then that the son
of GOD may reign, and that with and under the son of GOD the King may
command, and we as good subjects to the Christ and the King, may obey, so
prays he that loves truth and peace.

FINIS.
