An Excellent New Song On the late Victories over the TURKS.
To a very Pleasant New Tune. ^
(1)
HArk! the thundering Canons roar,
ecchoing from the German shore,
And the joyful News comes over,
The Turks are all confounded;
Lorrain comes, they run, they run;
Charge your horse through the grand half moon
We Will quarter give to none,
Since Staremberg is wounded.

Close your Ranks, and each brave Soul
Take a lusty flowng Bowl,
A grand Carouse to the Royal Pole,
The Empires brave Defender;
No man leave his Post by stealth,
Plunder the Grand Visiers Wealth,
But drink a Helmet full to the Health
Of the Second ALEXANDER.

Had he but allowed the VINE,
Given'em leave to carouze in Wine
The Turk had safely past the Rhine,
And conquered all before him.

Christians thus with Conquests Crowned
Conquest with the Glass goes round
Weak Coffee cannot keep its ground
Against the force of Glaret:
Whilst we give them thus the Foyl,
And the Pagan Troops Recoyl,
The Valiant Poles divide the Spoil
And in brisk Nectar share it.
