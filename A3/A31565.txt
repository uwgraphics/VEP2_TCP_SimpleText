To the Right Honorable Thomas Lord Needham, Viscount of Kilmurray.
My LORD,
I Having been most abundantly obliged to that Honorable, and most worthy Lady
whose Offspring your LORDSHIP is, I was the more induced to attempt the
boldness of this my humble Dedication of this small Treatise of Arithmetic to
your LORDSHIP, beseeching you to permit it Shelter under the safe Covert of
your Protection, at its first entrance upon the Stage of the censuring World:
which if your LORDSHIP shall please to vouchsafe to this small Endeavor of
mine, I shall ever remain

Your Lordships Devoted Servant Robert Chamberlain.

To his most Honored and much Esteemed Friend John Shaw, Esquire;
Most Worthy Sir,
KNowing how great a Lover and Admirer you both are and have been of Learning
and Arts, from your Minority, and in how great a measure you have tasted of
those Springs of Learning, from one of the most famous Fountains of Education
in this Land, did induce and embolden me to present you with a small Product of
some studious hours, which I have at vacant times employed in the Art or rather
Science of ARITHMETIC, it being Customary to make an Offering of the
First Fruits to the best of Friends. So an humble Acknowledgment of those many
Favors and Obligations I have received from you and your respected Family, I
here prostrate these my First Fruits at your Feet, hoping you will find them
both pleasant and easy of Digestion, beseeching your favorable and kind
Acceptance, and to vouchsafe it your Protection at its launching forth into the
wide Sea of this World, from the Blasts of Ignorance or Envy, and as in Duty I
stand obliged to pray for the eternal Happiness of you and yours, I rest

Your Faithful Servant Robert Chamberlain.

TO THE READER.
Arithmetic being so useful and necessary a Science, that without some
knowledge there of men could not negotiate their worldly Affairs in their
several Vocations and Callings, because in our several Negotiations we do
oftentimes make use of Money, Weight and Measure, which cannot be learned
without the Art of Arithmetic.

Having gained a competent measure of knowledge in this Art, by my studious
Inclinations for many years that way, at the earnest desire and request of some
Friends, I have published this small Treatise of Arithmetic, for the good and
benefit of such as desire to attain the knowledge thereof, although their
Capacities are so mean that they are totally ignorant of any Knowledge therein.

And for the Benefit of such Capacities, it has been my chief Endeavor to
explain and demonstrate the several Rules and Branches of Arithmetic in a
plain and easy Method, each Rule and Branch illustrated with variety of
Examples. Also a new and more easy way of dividing downward, without
cancelling of Figures, being a more pleasant way to the Learner. Also new
Tables for Gauging of Ale or Wine Cask, with plain and easy Demonstrations
thereof. Also plain and easy Rules showing how to extract the Square and Cube
Roots. And as I have endeavored to make plain and easy demonstrations, so I
have likewise endeavored to be brief as I could, because I would not have my
Treatise burdensome to the Readers memory, hoping the gentle and courteous
Reader may find it worth his Perusal and Acceptance, both to his Pleasure and
Profit, which if he do, I have obtained the end of my Labor and Desire, and
remain for thy further Instruction at pleasure,

Your Loving Friend, Robert Chamberlain.
From my House in Northumberland-Ally in Fen-Church-Street near Aldgate.

Chamberlain's Arithmetic:
CHAP. I.
The Definition of Arithmetic.
Arithmetic is the Art of Numbers which teaches to put the true value upon
any figure or figures, and does consist of these following Parts, which are as
Branches.

1 Numeration. 2 Addition. 3 Subtraction. 4 Multiplication. 5 Division.
These are the chief general Parts of ^rithmetick, and Number is a company ^f
Figures which are composed of many Units, as two is composed of two Units,
Three is composed of three Units, Four, of four Units, etc.

Therefore one unite is no number, but the beginning of number, for one does
neither multiply nor divide, for if you multiply or divide an unite by it self,
it admits of neither increase nor decrease, but number admits of both,
Increase by Addition or Multiplication, and Decrease by Subtraction or
Division, as 6 is a number composed of six units, and admits of Increase
first by Addition, as 1 unit and 6 make 7, secondly by Multiplication, as 3
times 6 make 18, and 6 admits likewise of Decrease, first by Subtraction,
as, take 1 from 6 and there remains 5: secondly by Division, as how many 2 can
I have in 6, the answer is 3 times.

Numeration.
NUmeration is that part of Arithmetic, by which is taught rightly and justly
to value, declare and write any Number or Sum propounded. All Numbers and Sums
are expressed by these following Characters or Figures, which are in number
ten, whose value if you conceive each figure to be or stand by it self, you may
take notice of by their several Subscriptions.

1 one, 2 two, 3 three, 4 four, 5 five, 6 six, 7 seven, 8 eight, 9 nine, 0
cipher.
Nine of these figures, viz. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, are significant
figures, signifying each figure so many Unites, but the Cipher is of no value
nor signification, as as it stands alone, but being joined with other figures
it increases the value of those figures which stand to the left hand of him.

Now these nine significant figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, have a double
Value, whereof the one is certain, according to its own signification as
before. But the other value is uncertain, it being according to the place that
the said Figure does stand in and possess.

A Place is a seat or room that a figure stands in, and how many figures there
are in any sum, so many places of value does the said sum contain, and that is
the first place of any Sum, which is next the right hand, every place being ten
times the value of the next right hand place.

Numeration Table.
C. Millions X. Millions Millions C. Thousands X. Thousands Thousands Hundreds
Tens Units How each Number is to be read. 1 One 1 2 Twelve 1 2 3 1 hundred
twenty three 1 2 3 4 1 thousand 234 1 2 3 4 5 12 thousand 345 1 2 3 4 5 6 123
thous. 456 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 Million 234567 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 Mill. 345678 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 123 Mil. 456789

This Table needs but little explana^ion, for thereby you may discern the
first place next the right hand to be the place of Units; the second, the place
of Tens; the ^hird, the place of Hundreds; the fourth, Thousands, etc. So admit
the sum 6873 were given you to number, consisting of four places, because in it
are contained four figures, which you must thus number, six thousand eight
hundred seventy three. And in like manner for 784395, which you must thus
number, seven hundred eighty four thousand three hundred ninety five.

CHAP. II.
Addition.
ADdition teaches of several Sums to make one which shall contain as much as
all those several Sums, as suppose, A owes unto --

B 328 Pounds. C 147 D 485 Total Sum 960

Set the several Sums as you see one under the other. Having drawn a Line,
begin at the lower end of that row next your right hand; saying, 5 and 7 is 12,
and 8 is 20, setting under that first row 0, and carry 2 for so many tens to
the next row; saying, 2 as I carried and 8 is 10, and 4 is 14, and 2 is 16,
setting down 6 under that row, and carry 1 for the 10 to the next row; saying,
1 as I carried and 4 makes 5, and 1 is 6 and 3 is 9, setting down 9 under that
row; so you have under the Line these figures 960, which is the total Sum of
those three. So that A owes in all to B, C, and D, 960 Pounds.

When you have any Sum to set down which you are to add up, you must be sure to
set down the several sums so orderly one under the other as the units may stand
under themselves, tens under themselves, hundreds under themselves, and
thousands under themselves, etc. According to these following Examples.

3842 l. 863219 428 76824 97 4386 9 327 24 6

Addition of Money.
If you have any Sums which are composed of several Denominations, as Pounds,
Shillings, Pence and Farthings, or any other kind; you must first consider how
many of the lesser make one of the next Denomination; as, in Sterling Money

4 Farthings is 1 Penny 12 Pence is 1 Shilling 20 Shilling is 1 Pound Sterling.


And so carry the Pence from the Farthings to the Pence, the Shillings from the
Pence to the Shillings, and the Pounds from the Shillings to the Pounds; as you
may plainly see in the working of this following Example.

l. s. d. Received of A 384 16 11 B 197 14 08 C 79 12 03 D 9 13 10 671 17 10

Suppose I had received money of four several persons, viz. of A 384 l. 16 s. 11
d., of B 197 l. 14 s. 08 d., of C. 79 l. 12 s. 03 d., and of D I have received
9 l. 13 s. 10 d.; and I desire to know how much the four Sums make altogether.
Set down the said Sums in such order one under the other, as the farthings may
stand under themselves, the pence under themselves, the shillings under
themselves, and the pounds under themselves; and in such manner as Units, Tens
and Hundreds may stand under one another, according as you see them here set
down; then draw a line, and begin at the bottom of the least Denomination;
saying, and is four farthings, and is seven farthings, and is nine farthings,
or two pence farthing, setting down under the farthings, and carrying 2 to the
pence; saying, 2 as I carried and 10 is 12, and 3 is 15, and 8 is 23, and 11 is
34 pence, which is 2 s. 10 d. therefore set down 10 under the pence, and carry
2 to the shillings; saying, 2 as I carried and 3 makes 5, and 2 is 7, and 4 is
11, and 6 is 17; setting down 7 under the first row of shillings, and
carcarrying 1 to the next row of shillings; saying, 1 as I carried and 1 is 2,
and 1 is 3 and 1 is 4, and 1 makes 5; which being odd, I set 1 after the 7, but
under the last row of shillings: now the half of 5 being 2, I carry 2 unto the
pounds; saying, 2 as I carried and 9 is 11, and 9 is 20, and 7 is 27, and 4 is
31, set down 1 under that row and carry three to the next row; saying, 3 as I
carried and 7 is ^0, and 9 is 19, and 8 is 27: setting 7 under this row, and
carry 2 to the next; saying, 2 as I carried and 1 is 3, and 3 is 6; setting
down 6 under the last row, so I find I have received in all of A, B, C, and D
671 l. 17 s. 10 d..

l. s. d. 384 16 11 197 14 08 79 12 03 9 13 10 Total 671 17 10 Proof 287 00 10
671 17 10

For the Proof of this Sum, whether it be cast up right or not, the common way
is to draw a line under the first sum, and then sum up again, only leaving out
the uppermost row, which sum being added to the uppermost row or line, then if
the sum be the same as before, the work is right cast up. But it is as easy or
better to cast up the whole sum again, and if you think by doing so, you may
commit the same error again, or fall into the same mistake as before, you may
cast it up the contrary way, viz. begin at top and go downwards, for the
Account will amount to one and the same sum, if it be right done.

But Tradesmen and Merchants being most concerned herein, have another help,
which is in writing out Bills by their Books, if they find the sums in both
Accounts do not agree, they conclude there must be a mistake in one or the
other, which they find out by casting the Accounts over again.

In casting up long Bills, where many shillings, are in the pence, it is a good
plain way to make a prick or some small mark at every shilling, and so setting
down the odd pen^e at last, counting over how many pricks you have made, and
carry so many Shillings to the place of Shillings.

But such as are ready and expert, count how many Pence are in the whole
Column, then by getting without Book such a Table as here follows, can
readily tell how many Shillings and odd Pence are in any Number of Pence.

Addition of Flemish Money.
Flemish Money is reckoned by Pounds, Shillings and Pence, as we do our
Sterling. But frequently they do reckon by Stivers and Guilders, or Stivers and
Ducatoons. 20 Stivers being 1 Guilder, and 63 Stivers is 1 Ducatoon.

I suppose I have explained this part of Arithmetic, that any capacity may
easily understand how to make use of the said Rule, either in Addition of Money,
Weight, or any sort of Measure, wet or dry, etc.
CHAP. III.
Subtraction.
SVbtraction teaches how to take a less Number out of a greater, and likewise
does show what remains of the greater Number when the lesser Number is taken
out.

There be three Numbers in Subtraction to be observed. First, the Number from
whence the Subtraction is to be made; secondly, the Number that is to be
subtracted; thirdly, the number that remains after the Subtraction is made.
As if I would subtract 24 from 36, 36 is the Number out of which the
Subtraction is made, 24 is the Number to be subtracted, and 12 is the Number
that remains after you have ended your Subtraction.

When you are to subtract, you must first set down the greater Number, or
Number from whence the Subtraction is to be made, and under that set down the
lesser Number, or Number to be subtracted, in such manner, as one Denomination
may stand under another, as Farthings under Farthings, Pence under Pence,
Shillings under Shillings, and Pounds under Pounds; Units under Units, Tens
under Tens, and Hundreds under Hundreds, according to their places, and then
draw a right Line under those two Numbers.

Subtraction of one Denomination.
Having placed your Numbers one under the other as was directed, you must begin
as* the right hand, and subtract the first Figure of the undermost Number from
the first Figure of the uppermost Number over (...) that which remains set
underneath the Line, right under the Figure you have subtracted, then take the
second Figure of your undermost Number, and take it from the second Figure of
your uppermost Number, the third from the third, and so forth until you come to
the end, putting always (...) of every Figure under the ^ine in i^s due order
and place.

Example.
l. Owing unto B C 2784 Paid unto B C 1552 Rest due 1232

According to the former Instructions, I do begin at the right hand; saying, 2
from 4 and there remains 2, which I set down under the Line, and right under
the first Figure subtracted; then I go to the next Figure, saying, 5 from 8 and
there remains 3, which I set under the 5, being the second Figure subtracted;
then I go to the next Figure, and say, 5 from 7 and there does remain 2, which
2 I set down under the third Figure subtracted; then I go to the next and say,
1 from 2 and there does remain 1, which I set under the last Figure subtracted.
So there stands under the Line this Number 1232 l. which does remain due unto B
C.

But sometimes it does fall out to have 2 Figures of one Quantity and Likeness
to be subtracted one from another. As, 5 and 5; then I say, 5 from 5 and there
does remain 0. And when you have a Cipher to be subtracted from any Figure. As
0 and 7; then you must say, 0 from 7 and there remains 7, and so for any Figure.

It will be requisite to give you one Example more in sums of one Denomination,
wherein the Figures of the lesser Number or Number to be subtracted, are some
of them greater than the Figures of the greater Number, or Number from whence
you must subtract; In such case you must borrow 10, and add to the uppermost
Figure, and then subtract your Figure to be subtracted from that Sum, and set
down your remainer; always remembering when you borrow 10 to add 1 to the next
Figure to be subtracted for payment, as in this following Example.

Example.
l. Due from A B 42317 Received 32140 Remains due 10177

Here is due from A B 42317 Pound, and there is received 32140 Pound, I desire
to know what is due from the said A B. Having set the two Sums down according
to the former Instructions; saying, 0 from 7 and there remains 7, 4 from 1 I
cannot, but 4 from 11 and there remains 7; 1 as I borrowed and 1 is 2, 2 from 3
and there remains 1; 2 from 2 and there remains 0, and 3 from 4 and there
remains 1. So there does remain due from A B 10177 Pound. And in like manner
for any other Sum, wherein you have one or more Figures of the lower Number
greater than the Figures under which they do stand to be subtracted.

Subtraction of Money.
In Sums composed of several Denominations, you must begin to subtract at the
least Denomination next your right hand, and subtract each Denomination from
his same, and set down the remainer of each Denomination under his own proper
Denomination; but if in the Denomination of Farthings, your lower Number be
greater than your upper, you must borrow 1 Penny which is 4 Farthings, to add to
the uppermost, and when you subtract the Pence, then add 1 Penny to the lower
Number of Pence for payment of the Penny or 4 Farthings you borrowed. Likewise
if in the Denomination of Pence the lower Number be greater than the upper,
borrow 1 Shilling or 12 Pence to add to the uppermost, remembering to add 1
Shilling to the lower Number of Shillings for payment of 12 pence you borrowed.
And in like manner, if the lower Number of Shillings exceed the upper, as you
may easily discern by the following Example of Pounds, Shillings, Pence and
Farthings.

Example.
l. s. d. Received 7836 14 7 Paid 4524 17 9 Remains 3311 16 9 Proof 7836 14 7
1/4

Here is received 7836 l. 14 s. 7 d., and out of it is paid 4524 l. 17 s. 9 d.;
it is required what is left of the said Sum. I set the two Sums down as you see
according to the former directions, and begin at the least Denomination which
is Farthings, saying, from I cannot, but 1 Penny as I borrowed which is 4
Farthings and 1 Farthing is 5 Farthings, 3 Farthings from 5 Farthings and there
remains 2 Farthings, which is, which I set under the Line, and right under the
Denomination of Farthings; then I go to the next Denomination, which is Pence,
and because I borrowed one Penny in the Farthings, I now pay it again, saying,
1 Penny as I borrowed and 9 Pence is 10 Pence, from 7 Pence I cannot, but 1
shilling which is 12 Pence, and 7 Pence is 19 Pence, and 10 Pence from 19 Pence
and there remains 9 Pence, setting 9 under the Line and under the Denomination
of Pence; then I proceed to the Shillings, and because I borrowed one Shilling
in the Pence, I pay it again; saying, 1 Shilling as I borrowed and 17 Shillings
is 18 Shillings, from 14 Shillings I cannot, but 1 Pound as I borrowed which is
20 Shillings and 14 Shillings is 34 Shillings, 18 Shillings from 34 Shillings
and there remains 16 Shillings, so I set down 16 under the Denomination of
Shillings; then I go to the Pounds, and by reason I borrowed 1 Pound in the
Shillings, I pay it, saying, 1 as I borrowed and 4 is 5, 5 from 6 and there
remains 1; setting 1 under the first Figure of the Denomination of Pounds; so
proceeding I say, 2 from 3 and there remains 1, 5 from 8 and there remains 3,
and 4 from 7 and there does remain 3, setting down each remainer under his
respective Figure as you see. So there does remain 3311 l. 16 s. 9 d.. And in
like manner for any other Sum of the same Denomination.

Subtraction of Haverdupoize Weight.
The several Denominations of Haverdupoize Weight, you may acquaint your self
with by the Table of Haverdupoize in the second Chapter.

Suppose I have bought 45 C. 3 quarters, 16 l. of Sugar, and I have sold 28 C.
1 quarter, 24 l. of the same Sugar; it is required what is left of this parcel.
I set down the Numbers according to the foregoing Directions, finding therein
three Denominations, viz. Hundreds, Quarters, Pounds; therefore I begin saying,
C. qr. l. Bought 45 3 16 Sold 28 1 24 Remains 17 1 20
twenty four from sixteen I cannot, but one quarter as I borrowed which is 28
Pound and 16 is 44, 24 from 44 and there remains 20. Then one as I borrowed and
1 is 2, from 3 and there remains 1. Then I come to the Hundreds; saying, 8 from
5 I cannot, but 8 from 15 and there does remain 7, 1 as I borrowed and 2 makes
3, from 4 and there remains 1. So I find there does remain unsold 17 C. 1
quarter, 20 l.

Sometimes it happens that there are many Sums or Numbers to be subtracted
from one Sum or Number, as suppose I have bought a Butt of Currants weighing 18
C. 1 quarter, 21 l. and at several times I have sold several parcels; as, 4 C.
3 qu. 17 l. at one time; 3 C. 3 quarters, 20 l. at another; and 2 C. 1 quarter,
16 l. at another time; 1 C. 2 quarters, 0 l. at another time; and 1 C 3 qu. 24
l. at another time; and 3 qu. 12 l. at another time. The question is what is
remaining unsold in the Butt of Currants?

Example.
C. qu. l. Butt of Currants contains 18 1 21 Sold out of it at several times 4
3 17 3 3 20 2 1 16 1 2 00 1 3 24 3 12 25 2 25 2 2 24

In order to answer this question, I first set down the neat weight of the But
of Currants, viz. 18 C. 1 qu. 21 l. drawing a Line underneath. I set down under
that Line the several parcels sold out of this Butt of Currants, one under the
other, and bring all these parcels under the Line into one Sum by Addition, as
you see in the Example, which Sum amounts unto 15 C. 2 quarters, 25 l. which I
subtract from the weight of the Butt of Currants first set down by the foregoing
Instructions of this Chapter for Subtraction of Averdupoize weight.

Subtraction of Troy Weight.
Example.
l. oz. p. w^. gr. Bought 20 08 16 21 Sold 12 10 14 22 Remains 7 10 01 23

Here I begin to subtract; saying, 22 from 21 I cannot, but 1 as I borrowed
from the Penny weights which is 24 Grains and 21 Grains is 45 Grains, and 22
from 45 and there remains 23 then 1 Penny weight as I borrowed and 14 Penny
weights is 15, from 6 and there remains 1; then 10 from 8 I cannot, but 1 Pound
as I borrowed which is 12 ounces, and 8 is 20, and 10 from 20 and there
remains 10; then 1 Pound as I borrowed and 2 is 3 Pounds, 3 from 0 I cannot,
but borrow 1 and say, 3 from 10 and there remains 7; 1 as I borrowed and 1 is
2 from 2 and there remains 0. So there remains in all 7 Pound, 10 Ounces, 1
Penny weight, 23 Grains.

Subtraction of Apothecaries Weights.
Example.
lb.... gr. Bought 12 9 5 1 12 Sold 7 6 7 2 15 Remains 5 2 5 1 17

Here in this Example you say, 15 from 12 I cannot, but 1 as I borrowed from
the next Denomination being Scruples containing 20 Grains, and 12 Grains is 32
Grains, then 15 from 32 and there remains 17; then proceed and say, one Scruple
as I borrowed and 2 makes 3 from one Scruple I cannot, but 1 as I borrowed from
the Drachms containing 3 Scruples and one is 4, three from 4 and there remains
1. Then I proceed to the next Denomination; saying, 1 as I borrowed and 7 is 8
from 5 I cannot, but one as I borrowed from the Ounces containing 8 Drachms and
5 is 13, 8 from 13 and there remains 5. Then proceeding to the next
Denomination; saying, 1 as I borrowed and 6 is 7 from 9 and there remains 2.
Then proceeding to the last Denomination; I say, 7 from 12 and there remains 5.
So there will remain 5 lb. 2. 5. 1. 17 gr. which does remain unsold of that
parcel.

Subtraction of Cloth Measure.
Here it will be convenient to let you know as by the said Table, in the second
Chapter of Addition; you may discern, that in Cloth Measure there be three
sorts of Measures. As, Broad Cloth is measured by Yards, Quarters and Nails;
Linen Cloth in England, by Else, Quarters and Nails; and Linen Cloth in
Holland, by Flemish Else, Quarters and Nails. In each of which it will be
convenient to give an Example; and to note that whereas by the Table of Cloth
measure in Addition you find 4 Quarters is 1 Yard, 5 Quarters 1 English Ell,
and 3 Quarters 1 Flemish Ell, it is to be 5 such Quarters as one Yard does
contain, viz. 1 Quarter more makes an Ell English, and 3 Quarters of our
English Yard makes 1 Ell Flemish.

Example 1. Example 2. Yard. qrs. na. Else. qr. n. Bought in England 215 3 1

Subtraction of Time.
You will find by the Table of Time that 60 Minutes make an Hour, 24 Hours one
Natural Day, 365 Days one Years; by the following Example of Subtraction you
more plainly understand how to work all such like Examples.

Example.
Years. days. hours. min. 348 340 16 45 179 285 12 25 169 55 04 20

Proof of Subtraction.
When your Subtraction is ended, if you desire to prove your work, whether you
have done right or wrong; add the Remainer to the Number that was to be
subtracted, and if the sum of those two Numbers be equal to the greater Number,
or numbers from whence the Subtraction was to be made, then your Subtraction
was true, otherwise false. Thus let us prove the second Example of this
Chapter, where after Subtraction is ended, the Numbers stand as you see, the
Remainder or difference being 3311 l. 16 s. 09 d., now to prove the work I add
this remainer 3311: 16: l. s. d. f. 7836 14 7 1 4524 17 9 3 3311 16 9 2 7836 14
7 1
9: 2, to the number that was to be subtracted which is 4524: 17: 9: 3: and the
Sum of these two Numbers is 7836 l. 14 s. 7 d., being equal to the Number from
whence the Subtraction was to be made. Therefore I do conclude the subtraction
is true.

CHAP. IV.
Multiplication.
MVltiplication is a Rule which teaches by two Numbers given to produce a
third Number, which shall contain one of the given Numbers so often as there be
Units in the other; and it serves instead of many Additions, being a Compound
of many equal numbers into one Sum, by multiplying one Sum into another. For it
increases one Number so often as there are Units in the other.

2. Multiplication does consist of three parts or numbers. That is to say, the
Multiplicand, the Multiplicator, and the ^
Product.

The Multiplicand is the Number to be multiplied. The Multiplicator is the
Number given by which the Multiplicand is to be multiplied. And the Product is
the Number which comes of the Multiplication; as you see in the Margent: 384
is the Multiplicand or Number to be multiplied; 23 is the Multiplicator or
Number by which the Multiplicand is to be multiplied; and 8732 is the Product
or Number that arises and comes by the said Multiplication, containing the
Multiplicand so often as there are Units in the Multiplier, that is 23 times.
For the Product contains the Multiplicand as many times as there be Units in
the Multiplicator.

It makes no difference which of the two given Numbers you make the
Multiplicand or the Multiplicator, for 8 multiplied by 6, is as much as 6
multiplied by 8; but commonly the greatest Number is made the Multiplicand,
standing uppermost; and the lesser Number the Multiplicator, standing under the
Multiplicand.

The Learner must get the following Table completely by heart, before he can
proceed any further in Arithmetic, because there is no Rule in Arithmetic but
has a great dependence upon Multiplication and Division.

Multiplication Table.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 3 6 9 12 15 18 21
24 27 30 33 36 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
55 60 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 66 72 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84 8
16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80 88 96 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 99 108 10 20 30
40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 110 121 132 12 24 36
48 60 72 84 96 108 120 132 144

The use of this Table is not difficult, in the top of the Table you have these
Numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12; and likewise down the first
Column toward your left hand you have the same Figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12; and in their respective Columns you have all those Numbers
multiplied by one another. So that if you would know the Product of any two
given Numbers from 1 to 12 multiplied together, look for either of the two
given Numbers in the top or uppermost Column, and for the other in the side
Column, guiding your eye in the same until you come under the other Figure or
Number in the uppermost Column, and in the common Angle or Meeting, you shall
have the Product required. Example, I desire to know the Product of 9
multiplied by 7. In the uppermost Column I find 9, and in the side Column 7;
and carrying my eye along the row or Column against 7, until I come under 9 in
the uppermost Column, I meet with 63, which is the Product of 9 and 7
multiplied together. And if you look for 7 in the top, and go down the same
Column until you come against 9 in the side you will find 63 as before; so it
matters not which you look for in the uppermost Column, or which in the side
Column. This Table being completely gotten without Book, the Learner may
proceed to the practice of Multiplication.

In Multiplication if the Multiplicand consist of many places, and the
Multiplicator of one place, set down the Multiplicand, and under it in the
place of Units set down the Multiplier, and draw a Line underneath them, and
multiply one into another, beginning at the place of Units, and proceeding
toward the left hand, setting down each particular Product as you go, and if
any particular Product amount to ten or any Number of tens, set down a o, and
for every ten carry so many Units to the next Product; and if any particular
Product exceed ten or any Number of tens, set down the excess, and for every
ten carry so many Units to the next Product; and when you come to the last
Figure, set down the total Product, as by the following Example will appear;
where it is required to multiply 7958 by 7. First, set down 7958 for the
Multiplicand, and under it in the place of Units set down 7 for the
Multiplicator, ^
then drawing a Line I begin finding by the former Multiplication Table, that 7
times 8 is 56, I set down 6 being the excess of 5 tens, and for those 5 tens I
carry 5 to the next Product. Now proceeding toward the left hand to the next
figure 5; saying, 7 times 5 is 35, and 5 as I carried is 40, set down 0, and
for the 4 tens carry 4 to the next Product; saying, 7 times 9 is 63, and 4 as I
carried is 67, setting down 7, and carry 6 to the next Product for so many
tens. Then I proceed; saying, 7 times 7 is 49, and 6 as I carried is 55; which
being the last Product I set down the whole Product 55, having finished the
said Multiplication and finding the Product to be 55706 as was required.

In Multiplication, if both the Multiplicand and the Multiplier do consist of
diverse places. Begin first with that Figure of your Multiplier as does stand in
the place of Units, multiplying it into all the Figures of the Multiplicand,
placing the Product below the Line, according to the Instructions of the last
Example. Then begin a new Product with the next Figure of the Multiplier,
standing in the place of tens, multiplying it into all the places of the
Multiplicand, and set the Product thereof under the first Product, but one
Figure more toward the left hand. In like manner multiply the third, fourth
and fifth Figures, etc. until you have multiplied all the Figures of the
Multiplier into all the Figures of the Multiplicand, remembering to set the
place of Units of the second Product under the place of tens in the first
Product, and the place of units in the third Product, under the place of tens
in the second Product, and the place of units of the fourth Product under the
place of tens in the third Product; and in like manner for as many Products as
there be Figures in the Multiplier, which will cause every Product to stand one
Figure short of one another toward the right hand, according to the foregoing
Instructions, the undermost Product standing one Figure more toward the left
hand than his undermost; as you see by the following Example.

It is required to multiply 486739 by 4387. I set ^
them down, the lesser under the greater, according to the Instructions in the
beginning of this Chapter, and drawing a Line under them, I begin with the
first Figure of your Multiplier, standing in the place of Units which is 7;
saying, 7 times 9 is 63; I set down 3 and carry 6. Then 7 times 3 is 21, and 6
as I carried is 27; set down 7 and carry 2. Then 7 times 7 is 49, and 2 as I
carried is 51, that is 1 and carry 5. Then 7 times 6 is 42, and 5 as I carried
is 47; set down 7 and carry 4. Then 7 times 8 is 6, and 4 as I carried is 60;
setting down 0 and carrying 6. Then 7 times 4 is 28, and 6 as I carried is 34;
setting 4 and 3 after him as you see. So the first Product will be 3407173.
Then I proceed to the next Figure, of the Multiplier which is 8, for a new
Product. Saying, 8 times 9 is 72; now I must remember the former Instructions
for placing the several Products, viz. to place the first Figure or place of
Units of your second Product, under the second Figure or place of tens in the
first Product. Therefore for 72 I set down 2 under the second Figure of the
first Product being 7, and carry 7. Then 8 times 3 is 24, and 7 as I carried is
31; set down 1 and carry 3. Then 8 times 7 is 56, and 3 as I carried is 59; set
down 9 and carry 5. Then 8 times 6 is 48, and 5 as I carried is 53, set down 3
and go 5. Then 8 times 8 is 64, and 5 as I carried is 69; set down 9 and carry
6. Then 8 times 4 is 32, and 6 as I carried is 38; I set down 8 and 3 behind
being the last of that Product. Next I proceed to the third Figure of the
Multiplier; saying, 3 times 9 is 27; setting down 7 under the 1, which is the
second Figure of the last Product, and I carry 2. then 3 times 3 is 9, and 2 as
I carried is 11; set down 1 and carry 1. Then 3 times 7 is 21, and 1 as carried
is 22; set down 2 and carry 2. Then 3 times 6 is 18, and 2 as I carried is 20;
set down 0 and carry 2. Then 3 times 8 is 24, and 2 as I carried is 26, setdown
6 and carry 2. Then 3 times 4 is 12, and 2 as I carried is 14; I set down 14
being the last Figure multiplied in that Product. Then I next proceed to the
fourth Figure of the Multiplier, which is 4. Saying, 4 times 9 is 36; setting
down 6 under 1, according to the former Instructions, and I carry 3. Then 4
times 3 is 12, and 3 as I carried is 15; set down 5 and carry 1. Then 4 times 7
is 28, and 1 as I carried is 29: set down 9 and carry 2. Then 4 times 6 is 24,
and 2 as I carried is 26: set down 6 and carry 2. Then 4 times 8 is 32, and 2
as I carried is 34, set down 4 and carry 3, then 4 times 4 is 16, and 3 as
carried is 19: set down 19, being the last Figure of your Multiplicand.

You must observe the same order in placing the respective Products, and the
Figures of each Product one under the o^ther, as you see in the Example, and
draw a Line, and by the Instructions of the second Chapter, add those several
Products up into one Sum under the Line, which will be 2135323993, the true
Product required being equal to 4387 times 486739, or 486739 times 4387.

In the same manner are all Multiplications to be wrought, although there are
more Figures either in the Multiplicand or Multiplier.

Another way of Multiplication.
The carrying of one Number is a little difficult to young Learners in this
Art, or to such as do not frequently exercise themselves therein. Therefore for
the help of such capacities, I show you a plain and easy way for finding the
several Products that are made by Multiplying the Multiplicand, by the several
Figures of the Multiplier.

When you have two Numbers given to be multiplied one by another, multiply the
greater Number by all the nine digits by continual Addition nine times over,
setting the several Sums down Table-wise as you see in the following Example.
The first Addition being as much as a Multiplication by 2, the second Addition
being a Multiplication by 3, the third Addition being a Multiplication by 4,
the fourth a Multiplication by 5, the fifth a Multiplication by 6, the sixth a
Multiplication by 7, the seventh a Multiplication by 8, the eighth a
Multiplication by 9. So have you the several Products of the Multiplicand, when
it is multiplied by all the nine digits, cast up to your Hand by Addition,
which you may choose out according to your Figures of the Multiplier, setting
your several Products down one under another, according to the Instuctions of
the last Example.

Example.
It is required to multiply 3968473 by 74698. First I set down the Multiplicand.

^

The Multiplicand being doubled, which is multiplying by 2, the Product or Sum
is 7936946, the Multiplicand added to that Sum, the Sum of them will be
11905419, which is the first Number multiplied by 3. The first Number added
again gives 15873892, being the Product of the first Number multiplied by 4.
The next Addition gives 19842365, or the first Number multiplied by 5. The
next Addition gives 23810838, or the Product of the first number multiplied by
6. The next Addition gives 27779311, or the Product of the first Number
multiplied by 7. The next Addition gives 31747784, or the Product of the first
Number multiplied by 8. And the last Addition gives 35716257, or the
Multiplication of the first Number by 9.

Here have you the first Number or Multiplicand multiplied by all the nine
digits, which Products set one under the other as you see, your Multiplier
being set under the Multiplicand, and a Line drawn, you take notice what figure
stands in the first place of the Multiplier, which in this Example is 8, and
against 8 I find this Sum 31747784, which I set down under the Line as you see.
The next Figure of the Multiplier is 9, against which Figure stands this Sum
35716257, which I set under the other as you see. The next Figure of the
Multiplier is 6, against it stands 23810838, which I set under the last Number
as you see. The next Figure of the Multiplier is 4, against that stands
15873892, which must be set under the last Number as you see. And the last
Figure of the Multiplier is 7, and against that stands 27779311, which must
like wise be set under the last Number, observing the same order in setting
down the Sums as you see, according to the Instructions in the last Example but
one of this Chapter, and drawing a Line, by adding up those Sums you will find
the true product required to be 296436996154 being equal to 74698 times
3968473, or unto 3968473 times 74698.

Abbreviations in Multiplication.
First, if you are to multiply any Number by 10, you need do no more but set a
Cipher 0 to the right hand of all the Figures. As, 5978 multiplied by 10, makes
59780. In the same manner if you were to multiply any Number by 100, add the
said Number two Ciphers thus 00, if by 1000 add three 000.

Secondly, if you are to multiply any Number by 20, 30, 40 or by 200, 300, 400,
or any Number with more Ciphers at the end, set them as you see in the Example,
as if you were ^
only to multiply by Figures; and let the Cipher or Ciphers hang over, and add
them to the Product, as in this Example.

Thirdly, if you are to multiply any Number, that has a Cipher or Ciphers at
the end, by another Number which has a Cipher or Ciphers in the end thereof,
set them as you see in the Example, in such manner as the first ^
figure of the Multiplier may stand under the first Cipher of the Multiplicand,
and cast up the Product as you see is here done.

Fourthly, if there be a Cipher in the middle of your Multiplier, you need do
no more but put a Cipher under the second Figure of the foregoing Product, to
fill up room, and set down the first* Figure of the next Product ^
next to the Cipher in the same Line, as by the Example you may plainly
perceive.

The Proof of Multiplication.
The surest way to prove Multiplication is by Division. But there is a way to
prove Multiplication by the Cross, which is thus.

First, add up all the Figures of the Multiplicand, as ^
in the Example of Multiplication of four Figures.

Saying, 3 and 9 is 12, and 6 is 18, and 8 is 26, and 4 is 30, and 7 is 37, and
3 is 40. How many times 9 can I have in 40? 4 times 9 is 36, and there remains
4; set down 4 by the Cross.

Secondly, do the same by the Multiplier. Saying, 7 and 4 is 11, and 6 is 17,
and 9 is 26, and 8 is 34; 3 times 9 is 27 from 34 and there does remain 7;
which set down on the other side of the Cross.

Thirdly, multiply these two Numbers together. Saying, 4 times 7 is 28; 3 times
9 is 27 from 28 and there remains I; which I set over the Cross.

Fourthly, I do the like by the Product as I did by the Multiplicand and the
Multiplier, and I find there will remain I; therefore I conclude the
Multiplication is right.

CHAP. V.
Of Division.
DIvision is a Rule which teaches to part any Number into any quantity of
equal parts assigned, or to find how often any Number given does contain a less
Number. That is to say, by two Numbers given to find out a third Number, which
third Number shall contain so many Units as the lesser of the two given Numbers
is contained times in the greater.

Division has four parts, viz. the Dividend, the Divisor, the Quotient, the
Remainer.

The Dividend is the Number given to be parted or divided.

The Divisor is the Number given, by which the Dividend is to be divided, and
is always the lesser of the two given Numbers, or the Number that shows how
many parts the Dividend is to be parted or divided into.

The Quotient is the Number that is produced of the parting or dividing the
Dividend by the Divisor, and is the Number that tells you how many times the
lesser Number is contained in the greater.

The Remainer is a Number always less than the Divisor.

Example.
There are two given Numbers 978462 for the Dividend, and 246 for the Divisor.
Now if the first Figure of your Divisor toward your left hand be less than the
first Figure of your Dividend, as in the following Example it is set, the first
Figure of the Divisor under the first Figure of your Dividend, as you see: but
if it be greater, then set the first Figure of the Divisor under the second
Figure of the Dividend, and the rest in their order, keeping your Figures
exactly one under ^
another.

Now beginning the said Example, I ask how many times 246 is contained in 978,
but for the more easy working I need but say, how many times 2 is contained in
9, I find 4 times, therefore upon a piece of wast paper, prepared for that
purpose, I multiply the Divisor by 4, the Product will be 984, which cannot be
subtracted out of 978, therefore I find the Divisor will go but 3 times in 976;
I set down 3 in the Quotient, making a separation as you see between the
Dividend and the Quotient, then you begin to multiply your Divisor at the right
hand end; saying, 3 times 6 is 18, cancel the 6. Then 8 from 8 and there
remains 0, and 1 from 7, cancel the 7, and there remains 6. Then 3 times 4 is
12, cancel the 4, saying, 2 from 6 and there remains 4, and 1 from 9 and there
remains 8, setting 8 over 9, and 4 over 6, cancelling the 9 and 6. Then 3 times
2 is 6, cancel the 2; and say, 6 from 8 and there remains 2, and the Division
stands as you see.

Next to proceed for finding the next Figure of the Quotient, I remove my
Divisor one Figure more toward the right hand, there standing over the Divisor
these uncancelled Figures 2403. I ask how many times 2 the first Figure of the
Divisor in 24 I find 9 times by multiplying the Divisor by on wast paper:
therefore I set down 9 in the ^
quotient after the 3. Then begin to multiply the Divisor; saying, 9 times 6 is
54, 4 from 3 I cannot, but borrowing 1 and saying, 4 from 13 and there remains
9, cancelling the 6 and 3 and set 9 over it, and 1 as I borrowed and 5 is 6,
from 0 I cannot, but borrowing 1, saying 6 from 10 and there remains 4, and 1
as I borrowed from 4 and there remains 3. Then 9 times 4 is 36, 6 from 4 I
cannot, but 6 from 14 and there remains 8, cancel 4 at bottom and 4 above,
setting 8 the remainer over head, than 1 as I borrowed and 3 is 4, from 3 I
cannot, but 4 from 13 and there remains 9, and 1 as I borrowed from 2 and there
remains 1. Then 9 times 2 is 18, cancel the 2, and say, 8 from 9 there remains
1, and 1 from 1 and there remains 0. So there is two Figures of the Quotient
finished.

I remove the Divisor one Figure more toward the right hand, as by the Example
does appear, then over the first Figure of the Divisor toward the left hand
which is 2 ^
there stands 18. So I demand how many times 2 in 18? answer is 8: so for
experience I multiply the Divisor 246 by 8, the Product will be 1968 which does
exceed 1894 the Number standing over it: therefore I do conclude the Divisor
must go but 7 times; I set down 7 for the third Figure of the Quotient, and
proceed, saying, 7 times 6 is 42, 2 from 4 and there remains 2, and 4 from 9
and there remains 5, cancelling the 6, 4 and 9, setting the remainer over head.
Then 7 times 4 is 28, cancel the 4, and 8 from 5 I cannot, but 8 from 15 and
there remains 7, 1 as I borrowed and 2 is 3 from 8 and there remains 5,
cancelling your Figures as you subtract from. Then 7 times 2 is 14, 4 from 5
and there remains 1, and 1 from 1 and there remains 0, there being these
Figures uncancelled 1722.

Now I must remove the Divisor one Figure more toward the right hand, as by
the Example, and over the first Figure of your Divisor toward the left hand
there will stand 17, I demand how many times 2 can I have in 17, I find but 7
times, so I set 7 in the Quotient and proceed in Multiplying the Divisor
thereby. Saying, ^
7 times 6 is 42, cancel the 6; then 2 from 2 and there remains 0, and cancel
the 2; and 4 from 2 the next Figure I cannot, but 4 from 12 and there remains
8, and 1 as I borrowed from 7 and there remains 6, cancelling 2 and 7 and set
the remains over head. Then 7 times 4 is 28, 8 from 8 and there remains 0, and
2 from 6 and there remains 4, cancelling 4 in the Divisor, and 8 and 6 in the
Dividend. Then last of all 7 times 2 is 14, 4 from 4 and there remains 0, and 1
from 1 and there remains 0. The Division is now completed, and I find by the
Quotient that the Divisor 246 is contained 3977 times in the Dividend 978342,
and there does remain nothing.

A more easy and plainer way of Division.
There is a far plainer and better way of Division, than this cancelling and
scratching of Figures, which I much admire that the Schoolmasters in these
times do not practice, the other way being too hard and difficult for a
Learner, for I have known many that have learned so far as Division with a
great delight and cheerfulness, but with the hardness and difficulty of
Division have been quite disheartened from proceeding any further. But this way
that I intend to show the Learner is so plain, easy and delightful that the
meanest and ordinariest capacity may attain the knowledge thereof by the help
of the former Rules.

Example.
It is required to divide 8748 by 36. First, set down the Divisor 36, and some
little distance in the same Line set down the Dividend, making a separation
between them, as you see in the following Example. So I demand how many times
36 I can have in ^
87, I find 2 times, I set 2 in the Quotient, and by it I multiply the Divisor,
saying, 2 times 6 is 12, setting 2 under the 7, which is the second Figure of
Dividend, then proceeding to the next Figure of the Divisor; saying, 2 times 3
is 6, and 1 as I carried is 7, setting down the 7 under 8, so there is 72 the
Product of the Divisor multiplied by 2, under which I draw a Line and subtract
one from the other by the third Chapter, and there will remain 15, which place
under the Line, at which time the Operation will stand as you see.

Next you must make a prick under the next Figure of the Dividend being 4, and
set 4 before the remainer 15, so you shall have 154 for a new Dividend, as you
see. Now I demand how many times 3 in 15, I find ^
4 times; so I set 4 for the second Figure in the Quotient, and I multiply the
Divisor thereby, and the Product 144 I set under the new Dividend 154, and
drawing a line, by the third Chapter I subtract one from the other and there
will remain 10.

Lastly, I set a prick under the next Figure of the Dividend, which is the
last, being 8, and drawing it down I set it before the Remainer 10, by which I
have 108 for a new Dividend. Then I ask how many times ^
3 I can have in 10? I find 3 times, therefore I set down 3 in the Quotient,
and multiplying the Divisor thereby, I set the Product which is 108 under the
last Dividend, and subtracting one from another there does remain 0, and the
whole work of the Division is finished.

But if it does fall, out that the first Figure toward your left hand of your
Dividend be less than the first Figure of the Divisor toward the left hand, or
if all the Figures of the Divisor be they more or less, do amount to more than
so many Figures of the Dividend, set a prick one Figure nearer the right hand,
as if in such case the Divisor does consist of three Figures, then you must
begin under the fourth Figure of your Dividend from your left hand, and seek
how often the first Figure on the left side of your Divisor is contained in the
two first Figures to the left side of the Dividend, and place the answer in the
Quotient; by which Figure multiply the Divisor, and place the Product thereof
under the Dividend in order, and deduct one from another and proceed, always
remembering in all the varieties of Division, that if you find by Multiplication
the Product to be at any time greater than the Dividend, you must take a Figure
lesser for your Quotient number by a Unite, or one.

Example.
It is required to divide 3865498 by 487. I set the Divisor and Dividend
according to the former Instructions, as you see in the following Example. And
because the 3 first figures of your Dividend ^
is less than the Divisor, I set a prick under the fourth figure from the left
hand being 5, then ask how many times 4 in 38, answer is 8 times, now for
experience sake, upon wast paper I multiply the Divisor 487 by 8, and the
Product I find will be 3896, which is greater than my Dividend 3865, therefore
it must go but 7 times, so I set 7 in the Quotient, and multiplying the Divisor
by 7, the Product 3409 I set under the Dividend 3865, and by subtracting I find
there will remain 456.

Now according to the former Instructions, I set a prick under the next figure
which is 4, drawing it down and set it before the Remainer; so have I 4564 for
a new Dividend. Then do I ask how many times 4 will go in 45, answer is 9
times, and finding by Multiplication it will bear so much, I set down 9 in the
Quotient, ^
and multiply the Divisor thereby, the Product thereof being 4383 I subtract
from the Dividend, and there does remain 181, the work standing as you may see.

I again proceed to the next figure of the Dividend, which is 9, and likewise
according to Rule I set a Prick under him, and drawing him down I set him
before the last Remainer 181, so I have 1819 ^
for a new Dividend. Then I do ask how many times 4 in 18? answer is 3 times,
for the Product arising by 4, will be greater than the Dividend 1819, therefore
I set down 3 in the Quotient, and Multiplying the Divisor thereby, I set its
Product 1461 under the last Dividend, and by subtracting I find there does
remain 358, as you see in the Example.

Lastly, I set a prick under the next and last figure of the Dividend which is
8, drawing it down I set the said figure before the last Remainer 358, which
gives me 3588 for a new Dividend. I now demand how many times 4 the ^
first Figure of the Divisor I can have in 35, by examination I find it will go
but 7 times, therefore I set down 7 in the Quotient, and multiplying the
Divisor by it, the Product of that Multiplication I set under the last new
Dividend 3588, and subtracting one from another I find there will remain 179.
Now the Division is finished, and I find that in 3865498 there is contained
7937 times the Divisor 487, besides 179 which does remain.

Here you must note that many times it happens that the Dividend cannot be
exactly divided by the Divisor; that is to say, after you have taken the
Divisor as many times as you can out of the Dividend, yet there will remain
some odd Number over and above.

But that Number which does remain of your Division must always be less than
the Divisor, or else your Division must in necessity be false; therefore you
must endeavor to rectify your work, and find out your error, which in this
plain and easy way of Division you may quickly find out, in your examination
having but two things to have regard to, that is your Multiplication and
Subtraction, both which in this way of Division lie so plain before your eye
that they may be examined with ease and facility.

Another way of Division.
This way that I do intend now to explain does not much differ from the latter
way: but here you have all the Products of every Multiplication ready cast up
to your hand by multiplying the Divisor by all the nine digits, as by the
following Example does more plainly appear.

Example.
Let it be required to divide 27232072 by 3698. Multiply your Divisor which is
3698, by all the nine digits, which you may do by Addition, 3698 1 7396 2 11094
3 14792 4 18490 5 22188 6 25886 7 29584 8 33282 9
as you see in the Table, where against each respective digit you have the
Product of the Divisor multiplied by that digit, as 2 times 3698 the Divisor is
7396, 3 times the said Divisor is 11094, 4 times the said Divisor is 14792, 5
times is 18490, etc.

Therefore by the former Rules having orderly placed your Divisor and Dividend
as you see, you do find the four ^
first figures of your Dividend toward your left hand are less than the
Divisor, and because the Divisor contains four figures, you therefore set a
prick under the figure from your left hand, which is 2, and demand how many
times the Divisor 3698 will go in 27232, therefore I look over the Table
prepared for that purpose, for the nearest Number to it that is less, which I
find is 25886, which is the Product of the Divisor multiplied by 7, so I set 7
in the Quotient, and 25886 for a Product underneath 27232, and have drawn a
Line, by Subtraction I find there does remain 1346, but less than the Divisor
3698.

Next I proceed to the next figure of the Dividend, which is 0, setting a prick
under it, and by drawing it down I place it before the Remainer 1346, and I
shall have 13460 for a new Dividend, and I ask how many times the Divisor 3698,
will go in 13460, I look in the Table of Products for the nearest less Number
which is 11094, being the Product ^
of the Divisor multiplied by 3 wherefore I set 3 in the Quotient, and the said
Product 11094 under the new Dividend 13460, and by subtracting one from
another, I find there will remain 2366, but yet less than the Divisor 3698.

Next I proceed to the next Figure of the Dividend which is 7, ^
and under it I set a prick, and by drawing it down, I set it before the last
Remainer 2366, and there will be this number 23667 for a new Dividend, then to
know how many times the Divisor 3698 is contained in that Dividend 23667, I
look in the former Table of Products, and there I do find 22188 being the
nearest less Number, and the Product of the Multiplication of the Divisor 3698
by 6: so I set 6 in the Quotient, and the said Product 22188 I set under the
last Dividend 23667, and after Subtraction is made, there will remain 1479, but
still you observe the Remainer is less than the Divisor 3698, and by that
observation you may soon discern an error when it is committed.

Lastly, proceeding, I set a prick under the next and last Figure of the
Divivend, and by drawing it down, set 2 before the last Remainer ^
1479, and you will have thenumber 14792 for a new Dividend, asking how many
times the Divisor 3698, will go in the Dividend 14792 in the Table of Products,
and the nearest less number to it is 14792, which is the Product of the Divisor
multiplied by 4, therefore I set down 4 in the Quotient, and the said Product
14792, under the last Dividend; and by Subtraction I find o remains, and now
having finished the Division, I do hereby find that the Dividend 27232072
contains the Divisor 3698 just 7364 times, and nothing over nor under.

^

If you divide 8743168495 by 67832, the Quotient will be 128894, and there does
remain 30687, as by the foregoing Example does appear.

By this way of multiplying your Divisor by the nine digit Numbers, you may,
First observe to be very useful, not only in this way of dividing downward, but
in all other ways of Division, whereby you may certainly know by ocular
inspection how many times your Divisor is contained in your Dividend, without
running the danger of mistake, by reason whereof you may be constrained to
begin your work again

Secondly, if you place the Numbers found in this manner as I have showed you,
directly under the Dividends, setting Figure under figure according to the
several places, your work will be much more easy, for you then have nothing to
do but to subtract the two Numbers one from another, without charging your
memory.

Thirdly, this way you shall have a more plain and easy Proof of the truth of
your work, than in any other way, for if you add together the several Sums to
be subtracted, and remain as they stand in the order, which in the last
Division you will find to be 30687. If your work be right the Sum will exactly
agree with the first Sum of your Dividend, as by the Proof of the last Division
here following does appear.

^

This being a far more easy and plain Proof of the work than by
Multiplication, only you must observe this method of setting the Sums down, as
you see here is done.

But because Multiplication is the common received way to prove Division, I
will show the Reader the way thereof.

When you are to prove any Division by Multiplication, you must set the Divisor
under the Quotient, and multiply one by another according to the fourth
Chapter, and to the Product of that Multiplication add the Remainer if there be
any, and the Sum thereof will be neither more nor less than the Number given to
be divided. As for Example.

Let it be required to prove the last Division but one of four Figures, whose
Divisor is 3698, Dividend 27232072, and Quotient is 7364: therefore ^
I set the Divisor 3698 under the Quotient 7364, and by the fourth Chapter I do
multiply one by another, and being no Remainer of this Division the Product of
the Multiplication is equal to the Dividend of the Division 27232072.

There be some will pretend to prove Division by casting out of nines, thus.

First, cast the nines out of the Divisor, as in the last Example of Division
is 6, 7, 8, 3, and 2 which make 26, from which take the nines and there does
remain 8, which I set on one ^
side of the Cross. Then I cast the nines out of the Quotient and there will
remain 5, which set on the other side of the Cross, and multiply the two
Numbers on each side of the Cross together, and there remains of the Product 4,
after the nines are taken out, which 4 I keep in mind, then join the Figures
remaining of the Division together, viz. 3, 0, 6, 8 and 7, which make 24, and 4
kept in mind makes 28, nines from thence and there remains 1, which I set on
the top of the Cross.

Lastly, I cast all the nines out of the Dividend, and there will remain 1
answering to 1 at the head of the Cross, and to be set at bottom, and when the
two Figures at top and bottom of the Cross do agree, then the Division is well
done, or else not.

Abbreviations in Division.
When a Number is given to be divided by any Number that has one or more
Ciphers on the right hand, for so many Ciphers cut as many Figures from the
right hand of your Dividend, and also cut off those Ciphers of your Divisor,
and let the remaining Numbers of the Dividend be divided by the remaining
Numbers of the Divisor, and if any thing remain of your Division, set the
Figures cut off from your Dividend to the right hand of them, and this new
Number is the true Remainer of the Division.

Example.
Let it be required to divide 86492 by 700, there being two Ciphers to the
right hand of the Divisor, I cut off two Figures from the right hand of the
Dividend, ^
viz. 9, 2, and likewise the two Ciphers from the Divisor, and divide the
remaining figures of the Dividend 864 by the remaining Figures of the Divisor
7, and there does remain of that Division 3, I therefore set 92 the Figures cut
off from the Dividend to the right hand of 3, and there will be 392 for the
just and exact Remainer, so that the Dividend 86492 does contain the Divisor
700, 123 times, and 392 parts of 700 over and above, as by the Example does
appear.

And hence it does by consequence follow, that if you have any Number to divide
by 10, 100, 1000, etc. you must cut off as many Figures from the right hand of
the Dividend, as there are Ciphers in the Divisor, and those Figures remaining
to the (...) hand shall be the Quotient, and the Figures cut off shall be the
Remainer, as thus; if 37842 be to be divided by 10, cut off the last Figure to
the right hand, as you see 37842 the work being done, wherein 3784 is the
Quotient, and 2 is the Remainer. Likewise if the same Number were to be divided
by 100, then cut off two Figures from the right hand thus, 37842, then 378 is
the Quotient, and 42 is the Remainer. And if 1 were to divide the same Number
by 1000, then cut off three Figures thus, 37842, and 37 shall be the Quotient,
and 842 the Remainer.

Having now explained the five Species of Arithmetic, viz. Numeration,
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division; being the Foundation of all
the following Rules, there being no Rule in Arithmetic but what does depend
upon them. I would entreat the Learner to be well acquainted with these Grounds
before he proceed further.
CHAP. VI.
Of Reduction.
REduction is a Rule that teaches to bring Numbers of several Denominations
into one particular Denomination; whether the Denominations do signify Money
English, Flemish or French, also Weights, Measures, etc.

Reduction is performed two ways, either by Multiplication or Division.

Reduction by Multiplication is a reducing of great Denominations into less, as
Pounds into Shillings, Shillings into Pence, and Pence into Farthings. Likewise
Hundreds into Quarters, Quarters into Pounds, and Pounds into Ounces, etc.
which is done by Multiplication.

Reduction by Division is a reducing of lesser Denominations into greater, as
Farthings into Pence, Pence into Shillings, and Shillings into Pounds.
Likewise, Ounces into Pounds, Pounds into Quarters, and Quarters into Hundreds,
etc. which is done by dividing that Denomination by as much as make one of a
greater, as in reducing Farthings into Pence, I divide the Number propounded by
4, because 4 Farthings make 1 Penny.

Reduction of Money.
In this Reduction of Money as well as in other Reductions, you must consider
whether the Sum propounded be to be reduced into a greater or lesser
Denomination, and next consider how many of the one Denomination do make the
other: by which Considerations you will know when to multiply and when to
divide, and what to multiply or divide by. As for Example.

Quest. 1. In 374 Pounds it is required to know how many Shillings. Here I do
consider that Pounds is the greater Denomination, and Shillings is the lesser,
and that in one Pound are contained 20 Shillings, and that the Number of
Shillings in 374 Pounds will be 20 times as much as 374, therefore I multiply
374 by 20, and the Product is 7480, and so many Shillings are contained in 374
Pound.

Quest. 2. In 526: 18, how many Shillings and Pence?

In this Example you have two Denominations propounded to find out the
Denomination of Pence, here in multiplying your Pounds by 20, you must take in
the 18 Shillings, setting 8 down first, because 0 cannot multiply, therefore
multiply by the next ^
Figure 2; saying, 2 times 6 is 12, and 1 is 13 set down 3 and carry 1, 2 times
2 is 4 and 1 is 5, set down 5, 2 times 5 is 10; setting 10 down. So the Product
of this multiplicand and the odd Shillings make 10538 Shillings; now am I to
reduce the Shillings into Pence, and knowing that 12 Pence make one Shilling, I
therefore multiply the Number of Shillings by 12, and the Product of that
Multiplication 126456 will be so many Pence, and so many Pence does 526 Pound
18 Shillings contain.

In the work of Reduction many times you need not run through every particular
Denomination, but come to the thing required sooner. As for Example.

Quest. 3. In 398 l. 15 s. how many Farthings? First, multiply 398 by 20, and
taking ^
in the odd 15 Shillings, the Product of Shillings will be 7975, then knowing
that in one Shilling are 48 farthings, I do not reduce these Shillings into
Pence as in the last Example, by multiplying them by 48. I do reduce them into
Farthings at once, and the Product of that Multiplication is 382800, and so
many Farthings is there in 398 l. 15 s. as was required.

Rule 4. But if it be required to reduce Numbers of a lower Denomination into a
greater, in such case you must divide the lower Denomination propounded, by so
much as makes of that lower Denomination one Unite or Integer of the greater
Denomination. As for Example.

In 1360 Shillings how many Pounds? and knowing that 20 Shillings of the lower
Denomination is contained in a Unite or Integer of the greater ^
denomination of Pounds, I therefore divide the lower Denomination 1360
Shillings by 20, by cutting off the last Figure, and taking the half of the
remaining figures, which half 68 is the Quotient of that Division by 20, and
the Number of Pounds contained in 1360 Shillings, as was required.

Rule 5. But if the question so happen in Reduction that there may be a
denomination or denominations between the Denomination given, and the
Denomination required, then you may reduce your Denomination given by Division
into the next superior or greater Denomination, and when it is so reduced,
reduce it again into the next above that, and so until you have brought it into
the Denomination required. As for Example.

Rule 6. Let it be demanded in 142080 farthings to know how many Pounds. First,
I divide the given Number Farthings by 4, to bring them into Pence, because I
Penny does contain 4 Farthings, and the Quotient thereof will be 35520 Pence;
then I divide 35520 Pence by 12, because 12 Pence make 1 Shilling, and the
Quotient of that Division will be 2960 Shillings, and then I divide 2960 by 20,
and the Quotient gives 148 Pounds, which are equal in value to 142080
Farthings. According to the Example.

^

Rule 7. When the Number given to be reduced does consist of diverse
Denominations, as Pounds, Shillings, Pence and Farthings; Hundreds, Quarters,
Pounds and Ounces, etc. Then you must reduce the highest or greater
Denomination into the next inferior or lower, taking in the odd Numbers
standing in that Denomination which your greater Denomination is reduced to,
then reduce that Sum into the next inferior Denomination, adding thereto the
odd Numbers standing in that Denomination, and so doing until you have brought
the Number given into the Denomination required. As for Example.

^

Let it be required to Reduce 137: 16: 7:, into Farthings. First, I bring 137
Pounds into Shillings by multiplying by 20, and taking in the 16 Shillings, the
Product will be 2756 Shillings. Then I multiply 2756 Shillings by 12 to bring
the Shillings into Pence, taking in the odd 7 Pence, and the Product will be
33079 Pence. Lastly, I multiply 33079 by 4, to bring Pence into Farthings,
taking in 2 for the odd half Penny, and the Product is 132318 Farthings, being
equal in value with 137: 16: 7:, or the Number of Farthings contained in the
whole Sum, as was required.

Rule 8. If in Reduction any do remain of a Division, the Remainer is of the
same Denomination as the Dividend is of.

There is a shorter way for reducing Pounds into Pence, and Pence into Pounds.
As for Example.

Rule 9. Let it be required to know how many Pence is contained in 347 Pounds.
Now because 20 Shillings is 1 Pound, and 12 Pence is 1 Shilling, ^
therefore 12 times 20 which is 240, is the Number of Pence contained in 20
Shillings or 1 Pound, and if you multiply your Pounds 347 by 240, the Product
thereof 83280 are the Number of Pence contained in the Sum of 347 Pounds, as
was required.

Rule 10. It is required to know how many Groats are comprehended or contained
in 263 Pounds, the way of reducing Pounds into Groats is not difficult, for
multiply the Pounds by 20 to bring them into Shillings, and because 1 Shilling
does contain 3 Groats, multiply those Shillings by 3, and that Product shall be
the Number of Groats in so many Pounds.

But there is a quicker and shorter way than this, which is thus. Because 20
Shillings is 1 Pound, and 3 ^
Groats is 1 Shilling, therefore 3 times 20 which is 60 is the Number of Groats
in 20 or 1 Pound, and if you multiply the Number of Pounds 263 by 60, the
Product will be 15870 the Number of Groats in 263 Pounds which is a shorter way
than to reduce Pounds into Shillings, and Shillings into Pence by two
Multiplications.

Rule 11. And if it were required to reduce Pence into Pounds, or Groats into
Pounds. Divide by 240 for reducing Pence into Pounds, and by 60 for the
reducing Groats into Pounds, and the Quotient shall be the Number of Pounds
required.

^

Rule 12. Let it be required to reduce 83280 Pence, and 15780 Groats into
Pounds, for experience sake, being the Products of the two last Examples.
Divide 83280 Pence into Pounds by 240, the Number of Pence in 20 Shillings or
one Pound, and the Quotient will be 347, the Number of Pounds as before, also
divide 15780 Groats by 60, the Number of Groats contained in 20 Shillings or
one Pound, and the Quotient thereof will be 263 Pounds as before, by which you
discern the infallibility of both Rules, for dividing or multiplying by 240, to
reduce Pence into Pounds, and Pounds into Pence, and by 60 for reducing Groats
into Pounds and Pounds into Groats.

Rule 13. There are other Denominations of English Money, besides Pounds,
Shillings, Pence and Farthings. As the following Table does show.

Denominations. Value. s. d. A Mark 13 04 An Angel 10 00 A Noble 6 08 A Crown 5
00 A Thirteen Pence half Penny 1 01 A Nine Pence 00 09 A Four Pence half Penny
00 04 Pieces of 00 03 00 02

Rule 14. Let it be required in 783 Nobles to know how many Marks, and Pounds
at 20 s. By this Table you find the value of a Mark to be thirteen Shillings
and four Pence, and the value of a Noble to be half a Mark, that is 6 s. 8 d.
and likewise 6 s. 8 d. is one third of 20 Shillings, therefore 20 Shillings or
1 Pound does contain 3 Marks, therefore to resolve the question, double the
Number of Nobles given 783, that is to say, multiply 783 by 2, and the Product ^
1566 will be the number of Marks contained, and because 3 Marks, viz 3 times 6
s. 8 d. is 20 Shillings, or 1 Pound, I therefore divide the Number of Marks
1566 by 3, and in the Quotient I do find 522, which tells me that in 1566 Marks
there is 522 Pounds, therefore in 783 Nobles there is 1566 Marks, and 522
Pounds: which is the answer to the question required.

Rule 15. In 768 Pounds, how many Marks and Nobles? this question is but the
reverse of the last, for if you multiply your Pounds ^
given by 3, the Product 1566 will be Marks, and the half of that Number will
be 783, the Number of Nobles, as was required. Therefore in 522 Pounds there is
contained 1566 Marks, and 783 Nobles, as was required.

Rule 16. In 538 Pounds it is required to know how many Angels and Crowns? By
the foregoing Table you find the value of an Angel to be 10 Shillings, and of a
Crown 5 Shillings; therefore because twice 10 Shillings is 20 Shillings, and
twice 5 Shillings is 10 Shillings; therefore I multiply the ^
Number of Pounds given 538 by 2, the Product thereof 1076 is so many Angels,
and that Product 1076 multiplied again by 2, the Product thereof 2152 are the
Number of Crowns. Therefore in 538l. there are contained 1076 Angels, and 2152
Crowns, as was required.

Rule 17. In 2152 Crowns how many Angels and Pounds?

This is the reverse of the last Rule, and whereas 2152 Crowns. 538 Angels.
1076 Pounds.
there you multiplied, here you must divide by, which is taking the half of it,
as for experience sake, the last Example of the last Rule, the half of 2152
Crowns is 1076 Angels, and the half of 1076 Angels is 538 Pounds, as before
2152 Crowns make 1076 Angels and 538 Pounds, as was required.

Rule 18. In 294 Pounds it is required to know how many Nine Pences and Four
Pence half Pennies.

^

For the resolving this question you must first reduce your Pounds into
Shillings, then your Shillings into Pence by the seventh Rule, and the Product
of the which in the Example you will find to be 70560, you must divide by 9 to
bring them into Nine Pences, and the Quotient will give you 7840 which are Nine
Pences, and the double thereof 15680, is the Number of Four Pence half Pennies,
as was required.

Rule 19. In 15680 Four Pence half Pennies how many Nine Pences, Shillings, and
Pounds?

This is the Reverse of the last Rule, and where in that you did multiply here
you must divide, where you divided here you must multiply; there I have chosen
the same Example for your better experience, which is thus resolved.

Because two 4 d. make 9 Pence therefore take the half of your given Number of
Marks 15680, being 7840 Nine Pences. Then by multiplying 7840 by 9, I reduce
them into Pence and the Product thereof is 70560 Pence, by the Instructions of
the sixth Rule, and you will find the Product of shillings to be 5880
Shillings, and the Pounds to be 294. So I find that 15680 Marks is 7840 Nobles,
or in value 5880 Shillings, and 294 Pounds, as was required.

^

Rule 20. In 6748 Thirteen Pence half Pennies how many Pence, Shillings and
Pounds.

You must first compute how many half Pence there are in 13 d., and you will
find 27; therefore multiply 6748 by 27, and the Product 182196 will be all half
pences, and the half thereof 91098 is so much, which divided by 12 the Quotient
will give you 7591 Shillings and 6 pence remaining, 7591 Shillings divided by
20 gives 379 Pounds, and 11 Shillings remaining. So that I find 6748 thirteen
pence half pennies are in value 379l. 11s. 6d. as was required.

^

Rule 21. In 436 l. 12 s. 9 d. how many pieces of 4 d. per piece.

^

By the seventh Rule reduce the given Number 436: 12: 09 into pence, and you
will find the Product of pence to be as by the Example 104797 pence, which
because there is an odd half penny in 4 d. you must double to bring into half
pence, and the Product then will be 209586 half pence, now by reason that in 4
d. there are 9 half pence, you must divide these Number of half pence 209586 by
9, as you see in the Example, and the Quotient will be 23287 pieces of 4 d.,
and of the Division there does remain 3 which does signify so many half pence
over and above 23287 pieces of 4 d..

Rule 22. In 372 pounds how many pieces of 3 d. and 2 d. of each equal, that is
what Number of 3 d. pieces, and what Number of 2 d. pieces will make up 372
pound, and the Numbers of each equal.

The way to resolve this question, and all other questions of this nature, is
to add the pieces together, (into which the given Number is to be brought,) and
to reduce the given Number into the same Denomination with their Sum, and to
divide the given Number so reduced by their Sum, and the Quotient will give you
the exact Number of each piece, the same method being used in the Example
foregoing, by which we find that 17856 three pences, and 17856 two pences are
equal in value to 372 pounds.

^

Rule 23. In 3748 pieces of eight Dollers or Duccats at 4s. 7d., how many
pounds, shillings and pence?

^

First bring one single Doller or 4s. 7d., into the lowest Denomination named,
which is half pence, and it does contain 111 half pence, by which I multiply my
given Number of Dollers 3748, and the Product thereof is 416028 half pence, and
by taking the half I reduce it into Pence, which is 208014, which by the sixth
Rule you may reduce into Shillings and Pounds. So I find 3748 Dollers, Duccats,
or pieces of Eight at 4 s. 7 d. are worth 866l. 14s. 06 d. English Money, as was
required.

Reduction of Averdupoize Weight.
Averdupoize Weight is used for all such Goods and Commodities that are to be
weighed, except Gold, Silver and Bread, which are weighed by Troy Weight.

For the Contents of the several Denominations of Averdupoize Weight, the
Learner may find in the Averdupoize Table in the second Chapter.

Rule 24. In 246 C. 3 qu. 16 l. It is required to know how many Ounces?

In the Averdupoize Table in the second Chapter I find 4 Quarter is one
Hundred, therefore having set down the given Number as in the Margent, 246 C. 3
qu. 16 l. and ^
multiply the hundreds by 4, taking in the Quarters, and the Product 987 is so
many Quarters. Likewise in the said Table I find that 28 Pound makes one
Quarter, therefore I multiply that Product 987 by 28, and the Product thereof
must be 27652, not forgetting in the multiplication by 28, to take in the odd
pounds I likewise find in the Table that 16 Ounces makes one Pound: therefore I
multiply the last Product of Pounds 27652 by 16 to bring them into Ounces, and
I find the Product to be 442432, where I do conclude that in 246: 3: 16 there
is 442432 Ounces contained, as was required.

Rule 25. In 442432 Ounces, how many Hundreds, Quarters and Pounds?

^

This is no more but the reverse of the last Rule, for where in that question
you did multiply, here you must divide, and by the same Figures, as the
foregoing Example does illustrate, in this manner.

First, you see the given Number of Ounces divided by 16, the quotient gives
27652 for Pounds, next I divide 27652 Pounds by 28, the quotient gives me 987
quarters, there remaining of that Division 16 Pounds, next I divide 987
quarters by 4, and the quotient thereof is 246 hundred weight, and of that
Division there remains 3 which are quarters, by which work I find that 442432
Ounces is as much as 27652 pound, 987 quarters, and 16 pound; or which is all
one but more Arithmetically expressed, 246 C. 3 qu. 16 l. as was required,
perfectly agreeing with the given number of the last Rule, by which you clearly
understand the infallibility of the method or manner of working.

Rule 26. A person is to send to his Chapmen in the Country 93 parcels of
Tobacco of 12 Pound in a parcel, as many parcels of 8 pounds in a parcel, as
many of 6 pound parcels, and as many of 4 pound parcels. The question is how
many hundred weight, quarters and pounds must be weighed off of the said
Tobacco to comply with all these parcels?

First set down the several parcels one under another, as 12 pound, 8 pound, 6
pound, and 4 pound, the Sum whereof is 30 pounds; now because there is to be 93
of each parcel, I therefore multiply 93 by their Sum which is 30, the Product
thereof gives me 2790 for the whole quantity of pounds. Now by the directions
of the last Rule I divide that Number of pounds 2790 by 28, the quotient gives
me 99 quarters, and 18 pounds remaining, next I divide these quarters 99 by 4,
and the quotient gives me 24 hundred, and there remains 3 quarters. So by this
work I find the whole quantity does contain, as by the foregoing Example does
appear 24 C. 3 qu. 18 l. as was required.

^

Rule 27. A Chapman buyeth 24: 3: 18 of Tobacco, and orders it to be made up
into parcels of 12 Pound, of 8 pound, of 6 pound, and of 4 pound, and there
must not be more of one parcel than another, but all equal. I desire to know
how many must there be of each parcel.

^

This is the reverse of the last, therefore I have taken the answer of that
question, and make it here the question upon which I desire the answer, which
answer will come out the same as the question of the last, if the work be truly
done, else not.

The way to resolve this question is thus: Reduce your given Number into pounds
by the twenty fourth Rule, and the Product will be 2790 pounds. Next add all
your parcels together, as 12 pounds, 8 pounds, 6 pounds, and 4 pounds, and they
make 30 pounds: now divide your Number of pounds before found 2790 by 30, the
Sum of all the parcels added together, and the quotient gives me 93, by which I
find there must be 93 of each parcel, as was required, and agreeing with the
question of the last Rule.

Reduction of Troy Weight.
Troy Weight differs much from Averdupoize Weight, as by the said Table in the
second Chapter, where you will find but 12 ounces Troy Weight to be in a pound;
therefore I would have the Learner well experienced in the Table of Troy Weight.

Rule 28. In 243 l. 8 oz. 16 p. weight, how many grains.

By the Table of Troy Weight in the second Chapter you will find 24 Grains
makes 1 Penny weight, 20 Penny weights is 1 Ounce, and 12 Ounces one Pound. ^
Therefore to reduce the given Number 243 l. 8 oz. 16 p. weig. into grains I do
thus. First, multiply the pounds 243 by 12, and take in the odd 8 ounces, and
the Product gives you 2924 for ounces. Then multiply the ounces 2924 by 20, and
take in the odd 16 penny weights, and the Product will give you 58496 for penny
weights. Next multiply the penny weights 58496 by 24, the Product will give you
1403904 which are grains, by which I find that 243 l. 8 oz. 16 p. weig. do
contain 1403904 grains, as was required.

Rule 29. In 1403904 grains how many pounds, ounces and penny weights?

^

This is no more but the inverse of the last Example, and is resolved by
dividing here by the same numbers that there you multiplied by, which is taken
backwards by 24, 20, and by 12, and the answer will be 243 l. 8 oz. 16 p. weig.
as was required.

Reduction of Apothecaries Weights.
It will be requisite for the Learner to make himself acquainted with the
several Denominations, and the notes or marks thereof, used by Apothecaries,
Chirurgions and Doctors; which by the said Table in the second Chapter are
these following.

20 Grains is 1 Scruple. 3 Scruples is 1 Dram. 8 Drachms 1 Ounce. 12 Ounces 1
Pound lb.
The Learner getting these notes without Book readily to know them will be
capable of reading any Doctors or Apothecaries bill.

Rule 30. In 18 lb. 9. 2. 1. it is required to know how many Grains?

Which to interpret is thus, read in 18 pound, 9 ounces, 2 drachms and 1
scruple how many grains? Therefore you must multiply 18 the Pounds by 12, and
take in the 9 ounces, the Product will give 225 for ounces. Then multiply those
ounces 225 by 8 the Product will give 1802 for Drachms, then multiply these
Drachms by 3, and the Product gives 5407 for Scruples. Next multiply those
Scruples by 20, the Product gives you 108140 for Grains, as was required.

^

Reduction of Wine Measure.
Rule 31. In 36 Tun of Wine how many Gallons?

Multiply by 4 and the Product is 144, then multiply 144 by 63, and the Product
gives you 9072 Gallons, being so many contained in 36 Tun of Wine, as was
required.

^

But there is a shorter way to reduce Tuns into Gallons, which ^
is this. There is in a Tun 4 times 63 Gallons, viz. 252 Gallons in a Tun,
therefore multiply 36 by 252, or 252 by 36, the Product will be 9072 Gallons as
before.

Rule 32. In 68 Tun how many Runlets? at 14 Gallons per Runlet.

Reduce your Tuns into Gallons ^
bymultiplying the Tuns by 252, or 252 by the number of Tuns given 68, and the
Product will give you how many Gallons are contained in 68 Tun, which if you
divide by 14 the Number of Gallons in a Runlet, the Quotient 1224 is the
answer, and so many Runlets of 14 Gallons will there be in 68 Tun, as was
required.

Reduction of Beer Measure.
Rule 32. In 54 Barrels of Beer how many Gallons and Quarts?

If you examine the Table of Beer Measure in the second Chapter you will find a
Barrel of Beer to contain ^
36 Gallons, and one Gallon 4 Quarts; therefore multiply your Barrels given 54
by 36, the Product thereof gives you 1944 Gallons, which multiplied by 4 gives
you 7776 quarts, which are contain ed in 54 Barrels of Beer, as was required.

Rule 33. In 48 Kilderkins how many Gallons and Pints.

In the Table you will find that 9 Gallons is a Firkin, and 2 Firkins which is
18 Gallons is 1 ^
Kilderkin; therefore multiply Kilderkins 48 by 18 and the Product will give
you 864 Gallons. Now by the same Table I find 2 Pints is 1 Quart, 2 Quarts or 4
Pints 1 Pottle, and 2 Pottles or 8 Pints is 1 Gallon; therefore I multiply the
Gallons 864 by 8 and there does remain in the Product 6912 Pints, which are
contained in 48 Kilderkins of Beer, as was required.

Reduction of dry Measure.
Rule 34. In 72 Last of Corn how many Bushels and Pecks.

Because in the Table of dry Measure in the second Chapter you find 5 Quarters
make a Wey, and 2 Wey ^
1 Last; therefore I double the given number of Lasts 72, and make it 144,
which I multiply by 5, and the Product is 720. There is a shorter way of
reducing Lasts into Weys thus: 5 quarter being 1 Wey, 2 Wey or 10 Quarters is 1
Last; so that multiplying 72 Last by 10, by adding thereto 0 makes 720
Quarters, as before. Now by the said Table I find that 8 Bushels is 1 Quarter;
I therefore multiply 720 Quarters by 8, and the Product gives me 5760 Bushels,
and multiplying these 5760 Bushels by 4, the Product gives me 23040 Pecks, and
so many Bushels and Pecks are contained in 72 Last of Corn, as was required.

Reduction of Long Measure.
Rule 35. I demand how many Yards, Feet, Inches and Barley Corns will reach from
London to S. David's, which is reckoned 202 Miles.

Here I multiply 202 Miles by 8 to bring them into Furlongs, and the product
gives me 1616 Furlongs; then I multiply these Furlongs by 40 to bring them into
poles, and they produce 64640 poles or perches. Then I multiply them poles by
11, and the product gives me 711040 half Yards.

The half whereof 355520 are Yards, which Yards I reduce into Feet by
multiplying them by 3, and the product gives 1066560 Feet, then those Feet I
reduce into Inches by multiplying them by 12, and the product gives 12798720
Inches. Lastly, I multiply those inches by 3, and the product thereof gives
38396160 Barley Corns.

^

Rule 36. The greatest Circumference of the Globe of the Earth and Sea as all
other greater Circles are, are divided into 360 Degrees, each Degree into 60
Minutes or Miles.

^

Greatest Circumference in Inches 1368576000 Earths Diameter in Inches
435456000 Earths Semidiameter in Inches. 217728000

Reduction of Cloth Measure.
Rule 37. In 348 Yards how many quarters and nalls?

^

Rule 38. In 3462 Else English, how many Else Flemish?

^

Rule 39. In 5770 Else Flemish, how many Else English?

^

This is the Reverse of the last Rule, but there is a shorter way than this to
reduce Flemish Else into English Else, by multiplying the number of Flemish
Else given by 6, and from the Product cut off the last Figure toward the right
hand, and the Remainer shall give you the number of English Else.

Example.
Let it be required to reduce 678 Flemish into English, I multiply 678 by 6,
and the Product is 4068, then I cut off the last Figure toward the ^
right, which is 8, and there remains 406, which is the true number of English
Else, and the half of 8 being 4, gives you four fifths of an English Ell, which
is the same as eight tenths. Therefore 678 Else Flemish contains 406 Else
English, and of an Ell, as was required.

CHAP. VII.
The Single Rule of Three Direct.
THe Rule of Three is sometimes called Golden Rule by reason of the great
excellency of it, it being the chiefest Rule in Arithmetic, because the other
Rules do make use of the Rule of Three.

This Rule does teach to find out a fourth Proportional to three given numbers,
in such manner that the fourth may be in proportion to the third given Number,
as the second is to the first; for which reason it is also called the Rule of
Proportion.

Now Proportion is thus to be understood, that is when the first given Number
contains or is contained by the second, as often as the third contains or
is contained by the fourth, as you may see by these following Numbers.

As is to So is to 3 6 4 8 2 8 3 12 4 20 7 35

These Numbers are all proportional, viz. as 3 is to 6, so is 4 to 8; Likewise
as 2 is to 8, so is 3 to 12; and as 4 is to 20, so is 7 to 35: That is to say,
as many times as 3 is contained in 6, so many times is 4 contained in 8: again,
as often as 8 does contain 2, so often does 12 contain 3, etc.

The great difficulty is to know which of these three given Numbers are to be
placed in the first place, which in the second, and which in the third. Now of
these three given Numbers, there will be two of the said given Numbers of one
Denomination, and the other is of the same Denomination as the fourth Number to
be found will be of. Now when you have found out the two Numbers of one
Denomination, put one in the first place, and the other in the third place, and
in the second place set the Number which is the same Denomination with the
fourth Number sought.

But perhaps it may be objected, that which of the two given Numbers of one
denomination must be put in the first place, and which in the third place. Now
you must understand that upon one of these two Numbers there is a demand, and
that Number upon which the demand is placed, must be always esteemed the third
place; as in the following Example. If 3 Yards are worth 9 s. what shall 6
Yards be worth? here you see a demand made upon 6 Yards, for it is demanded
what shall 6 Yards be worth? therefore 6 Yards must be in the third place, and
3 Yards in the first place, and then by consequence the number 9 must be in the
second place, and they will stand in order thus.

Yards. Shillings. Yards. 3 9 6

Now you have prepared your Numbers as to order in standing, for the finding
out the fourth Number, observe this Rule.

Rule. Multiply your second and third Number together, and divide by your
first, the Quotient is the fourth Proportional or Number sought.

^

Having placed my given numbers according to the former directions, as you see,
I multiply the second number 9 by my third number 6, the Product will be 54
which by the fifth Chapter I do divide by the first number 3, and the Quotient
gives 18 for so many Shillings, because the second number was Shillings. So 18
Shillings is the price of 6 Yards, being the fourth Proportional number, for
the fourth number 18 does contain the third number 6, as many times as the
second number 9 does contain the first number 3.

Therefore if 3 Yards cost 9 Shillings, 6 Yards will cost 18 Shillings.

Quest. 2. If 8 C. of Sugar cost 32 Pound, what will 27 C. of the same Sugar
cost?

To observe the former Rules in placing the given numbers, I consider that the
demand is made upon 27 C. of Sugar, which must be the third number; next I
consider 8C. to be of the same Denomination, therefore I put that in the first
place, and by consequence I put 32 Pounds in the second place, being of the
same Denomination as that number which is sought, as you see in the following
Example.

Next I proceed and ^
multiply according to the instructions before given, viz. 32 by 27, and the
Product thereof will be 864, which I likewise divide by the first number 8, and
the Quotient will give 108 for the true value 27 of C. of Sugar, as was
required, at the rate of 32 Pound for 8 C.

Now if any thing do remain after you have divided the Product of the
Multiplication of the second and third number by the first number, the
remainder of your Division must be multiplied by the number of Units of the
next lesser Denomination as are equal to a Unite or Integer of the second
number in the question, the Product of this Multiplication divide by the first
number in your question, and the quotient of this Division shall be the same
denomination as the parts by which you last multiplied, and part of the fourth
number sought, and if any thing remain of this Division, multiply such remainer
by the parts of the next inferior denomination equal to a unite of the last
quotient, and divide the Product by the same Divisor, and this Quotient shall
be of the same denomination as your last multiplier, and so proceed either till
nothing remain of your division, or till you have reduced your remainer into
your lowest denomination.

Quest. 3. If 17 C. of Tobacco cost 43 Pounds, what will 86 Pound cost?

By the following Example you will find according to the former Instructions
the numbers, and also multiplied and divided, the Quotient of the Division
gives 217 l. because the second number is Pounds, but there remains 9, by which
I understand the price or value of 86 C. of Tobacco to be something more than
217 l. and to know how much more I proceed according to the foregoing
Instructions.

As by this Example, viz. I multiply the Remainer 9 by 20, because 20 Shillings
is equal to an Integer of the second number, the Product of this Multiplication
is 180, which I divide by the first number 17, and the Quotient is 10 Shilling,
because the last Multiplier was of the Denomination of Shillings. But here yet
does remain 10, which I multiply by 12 Pence because the last quotient was
Shillings, and the Product of that Multiplication is 120, which I divide by 17
the first number, and the quotient is 7 Pence, because the last Multiplier was
Pence. But here yet does remain 1, which if I multiply by 4, cannot be divided
by 17, therefore I set it next after the Pence, and over the Divisor with a
Line between thus, 1/17. By which I do find that 86 C. of Tobacco will cost 217
l. 10s. 7d. 1/17, if 17 C. cost 43 l. which Fraction is one seventeenth of a
Penny, which is an exact answer to the question propounded.

^

Another Example of this kind will not be amiss, wherein the second number will
be of another kind, as Weight.

Quest. 4. If 32 Pound buy 53 Hundred Weight of Sugar, how much will 124 Pound
buy.

As you may discern by the ensuing Example. I have placed the numbers according
to the former Instructions, and likewise multiplied the second and third
numbers together, and divided by the first number, of which Division there does
remain 12, and the Quotient is 205 C. weights, because the second number is of
that denomination, viz. Hundred weights, now because there does remain 12, I
understand thereby I can buy more than 205 Hundred weight of Sugar for 124
Pound; which to find out I thus proceed according to the former Instructions,
viz. I multiply the remainer by 4, because the second number is Hundred
weights, and 4 Quarters makes one Hundred weight, and the Product is 48, which
I divide by 32 the first number, and the Quotient will be 1 Quarter, because
the Multiplier was so; but of this Division there does remain 16. Next I
multiply that remainer by 28 Pound, being the last

^

Quotient was Quarters, and 28 Pounds make 1 Quarter, and the Product of this
last Multiplication will be 448, which I divide by 32, and the Quotient gives
14 Pounds, because the last Multiplier was Pounds, but of this last Division
there does remain nothing. Finding by the Operation that for 124 Pound I can
buy 205 C. 1 qu. 14 l. if 53 Hundred weight cost 32 Pound, being the answer to
the Question propounded.

It many times falls out in questions of the Rule of Three, that
notwithstanding the first and third numbers are of one Kind or Species, viz.
Money, Weight, Measure, etc. yet they may either or both consist of several
denominations, in such case you are to reduce both numbers into the lowest
denomination, and likewise into one denomination; also if your second number be
of several denominations, you must reduce it into the lowest denomination
named, or lower if you please; which being done, then multiply the second and
third number together, and divide by the first, according to the former
directions, the answer to the question being of the same denomination as your
second number is reduced unto.

Quest. 5. If 12 C. 3 qu. of Sugar cost 32l. 14 s. 6 d. what will 82 C. 1 qu.
22l. cost?

Having placed these several numbers in their several respective places,
according to the former instructions, as you see in the following Example, 12
C. 3 qu. being in the first place, 32 l. 14 s. 6 d. in the second place, and 82
C. 1 qu. 22 l. in the third place.

Now I perceive my first and third numbers are of several denominations, my
first number having two denominations, as Hundreds and Quarters, viz. 12 C. 3
qu. My third number has three denominations, as Hundreds, Quarters and Pounds,
viz. 82 C. 1 qu. 22 l. But yet the first and third numbers are of one kind,
that is to say, their several denominations are of Weight. Now the first and
third number must be both of them brought into one denomination, and that
denomination must be the lowest named either in the first or third number,
which here in this Example is Pounds weight. Now by the sixth Chapter for the
Reduction of Averdupoize weight, you may reduce the first and third numbers
into Pounds weight, the first number producing 1428l. weight, and the third
number produces 9234 l. weight.

Next I consider the nature and quality of the second number which is Money; but
it likewise does consist of several denominations, as Pounds, Shillings and
Pence, viz. 32 l. 14 s. 6 d. which by the sixth Chapter of Reduction of Money,
must be reduced into Pence, being the lowest denomination named, and it will
produce 7854 Pence.

Having thus reduced the three given numbers, as you see in the following
Example, I proceed according to the former Instructions of this Chapter,
multiplying the second number reduced 7854 by the third number reduced 9234,
the Product of which Multiplication is 72523836, which I do divide by the first
number reduced 1428 by the instructions of the fifth Chapter, and the Quotient
makes 50787, which are Pence, because the second number 7854 by Reduction was
made Pence, which Quotient 50787 is the fourth Proportional required, and the
number of Pence answering to the Question, which by Reduction makes 211 l. 12
s. 3 d. And so much will 82 C. 1 qu 22 l. cost, if 12 C. 3 qu. cost 32 l. 14 s.
6 d. as was required.

^

To prove the Rule of Three is to state the Question quite backward, by putting
the fourth number found out, first, the third number put second, and the second
number put third; so have you three new given numbers to find a fourth by the
former Instructions, which fourth number when it is found will be the same as
the first number in the question first stated.

The Proof of the second Question of this whose fourth number so found is 108.
^

Here you see the second and third number multiplied together, whose Product
864 I do divide by the first number 108, and the quotient 8 is the fourth
number found out, which is the first number in the Example of the second
question.

But there is a shorter way of proving any question in the Rule of Three thus.

Multiply the first number by the fourth number found; likewise multiply the
second number by the third; if these two Products do agree, your Operation is
without any error, else not, as you may see by the Proof of the Example of the
second question.

^

By this you see that 8 the first number, and 108 the fourth number multiplied
together make 864, and the second number 32 multiplied by the third number 27
produces 864 as before.

The fifth Question proved both ways.
^

^

Here you multiply your first number 1428, and the fourth number found 50787
together, whose Product is 72523836; likewise multiply the second number 7854,
and the third number 9234 together, and the Product is 72523836 as before.

CHAP. VIII.
The Single Rule of Three Backwards.
THIS Rule is so called, because it produces and requires a proportion quite
backward, and contrary to the Rule of Three Direct, because in the Rule of
Three Direct the greater the third number is, the greater will the fourth
number be. But in this Rule the greater the third number is, the lesser will
the fourth number be: You are to place your three given numbers in order
according to the Directions of the last Rule. But in this Rule you must
multiply the first and second numbers together, and the product of that
Multiplication divide by the third number, and the number that comes in the
Quotient shall be the fourth number required, or answer to the Question.

Quest. 1. If 12 Laborers will build a House in 28 days, how many days shall
16 men build such another in.

Here I set the three given numbers in order, as you see in the following
Example, where you ^ see 12 in the first place, 28 in the second place, 16 in
the third place, and the first and third number both of one Denomination, and
the fourth number required will be the same Denomination as the second number
is of, according to the former Instructions of the last Chapter.

These numbers being thus placed and disposed as you see, multiply the first
number 12 by the second number 28, and the Product thereof will be 336, which
divide by 16 the third number, and the Quotient gives you 21 days for answer to
the Question as was required: For if 12 men can do the work in 28 days, 16 men
will do it in 21 days.

Quest. 2. If a Traveller performs a Journey when the days are 12 hours long
in 12 days, in how many days shall he perform the same Journey when the days
are 15 hours long?

Here you may clearly perceive, the more hours are in a day, the fewer days
will he be in performing his Journey, therefore set your numbers down as you
see, ^ Multiply the second number 12 days, and the first number 10 hours
together, and the product 120 divide by 15 hours the third number, and the
Quotient will give you 8 days, in answer to the Quotient as was required.

Quest. 3. If I hang a room with 36 yards of stuff at 7 quarters wide, how many
yards will hang the same Room at 4 quarters or yards wide.

^

Place the numbers are you see, and multiply the first and second numbers
together, the product thereof will be 252, which divide by the third number 4,
and the Quotient will be 63 yards, and so many yards does answer, or is equal
to 36 yards of 7 quarters wide.

Quest. 4. If when the bushel of wheat is worth 3 s. a penny wheaten Loaf
weighs 8 ounces: I demand, how many ounces shall the same Loaf weigh, when
the bushel is worth 5 shillings?

^

Multiply the first and second numbers together, the product being 24 divide by
5 the third number, the Quotient will be 4 ounces of an ounce.

I might set down many Examples more of this Rule, but I suppose these may be
sufficient for instruction sake.

The Rule of three Backward may be proved after this manner, multiply the first
and second numbers together, and likewise the third and fourth numbers
together. If the products of these two several multiplications do agree, the
operation is right, else not.

^

Here is the first Example of this Rule proved by multiplying the first and
second numbers, and the third and fourth numbers together, the products of each
multiplication agreeing in one sum 336.

For proving of such questions, wherein after you have divided something does
remain, such Remainder must in proving the said question, be added to the
Product of the third and fourth numbers, for the Product of the third and
fourth numbers in such cases will fall out so much lesser than the Product of
the first and second number, as there be Units remaining of the Division.

CHAP. IX.
The Double Rule of three Direct.
THE Rule of Three Double or Composed is so called, because it is a Composing
or Joining of two Questions of operations of the common Rule of Three into one,
which does much abbreviate Work.

And as in the Rule of Three there is the Direct Rule and the Backward Rule, so
here also the two Questions may require a Direct or Reverse Proportion.

The Double Rule of Three being either Direct or Reverse, which is Backward.

In the Double Rule of Three Direct there are 5 numbers given to find out a
sixth Proportional, which sixth Proportional may be found out by two single
Questions of the Rule of Three Direct.

In these five given numbers of the Double Rule of Three Direct, are two
Species or Kinds, first a supposition, secondly a Question or Demand.

The Supposition is contained in the three first of the five given numbers, the
Demand in the two last.

The Question being stated, the five numbers given must be disposed in such
order as the first and the fourth may be of one Denomination, the second and
the fifth number of another Denomination, and the answer in the sixth will be
the same with the third, and then the manner of operation must be thus,
multiply your first and second numbers, the Product shall be the Divisor, then
multiply the other three numbers one by another, and the Product thereof shall
be the Dividend.

Quest. 1. If 100 l. in 12 months gain for Interest 7 l. what will 80 l. gain
for 8 months?

In the following Example of this Question you see the three first numbers,
viz. 100 l. 12 months, and 7 l. do contain a supposition, and the two last,
viz. 80 l. 8 months do contain a Demand or Questistion.

And these five numbers are so disposed and placed, that the first number 100
l. and the fourth number 80 l. are of one kind or Denomination, viz. Money, the
second number 12 months, and the fifth number 8 months, are both of another
Denomination, viz. months, and the sixth number required will be the same kind
or species as the third number, viz. money.

Now according to the former Instructions of this Chapter, I multiply the first
and second numbers together, and their Product 1200 is the divisor, then I
multiply the three other numbers 7, 80, and 8 one by another as you see, whose
Product comes to 4480 for the Dividend, which divided by 1200 the Divisor, the
Quotient gives 3 for so many pounds, because the third number was pounds, but
of this Division there will remain 880, which I multiply by 20, and the Product
gives 7600 for a new Dividend, which divided by 1200, the Divisor, the
Quotient gives 14 shillings, but there yet does remain 800, which multipled by
12 gives 9600 in the Product for another new Dividend, which divided by the
former Divisor 1200, the Quotient gives 8 pence, as by the former Example, so
the sixth number found is 3 l. 14 s. 8 d. being of the same Kind or Species as
the third number, viz. money, ^ therefore by the foregoing Operation 80 Pound
for 8 Months will gain 3 l. 14 s. 8 d. if 100 Pound for 12 Months gains 7 l.
being the true answer to the question, as was required.

This question is done at two Operations by the Rule of Three Direct, but this
is the quicker and shorter way by much.

First Operation. If 100 l. gain 7, what will 80 l? answer 5: 12: 0.

Second Operation. If 12 Months give 5 l. 12 s. what will 8 Months? answer 3:
14: 8.

This Example will be sufficient for the explanation of this Rule, but to make
it so plain, that the Learner may meet with nothing to obstruct his cheerful
proceeding in the Art of Arithmetic, I will exemplify these two Operations,
as follows, according to the Rules and Instructions laid down in the seventh
Chapter.

^

Here you have the Work perspicuous to the eye, performed by two single
questions in the Rule of Three Direct, exactly agreeing in the answer to the
former way, which is a very great Argument to prove the infallibility of the
former, which is much the quicker and shorter way.

CHAP. X.
The Double Rule of Three Backward.
IN all questions of this Rule you have five numbers always given, in disposing
of which numbers to their several proper places, observe the directions in the
last Chapter, for this Rule is no other than the Reverse of the last Rule, when
the numbers are placed in order, the Solution of any question at one Operation
is thus.

Multiply your third and fourth numbers together, the Product thereof is yoar.
Divisor, then multiply your first, second and fifth numbers together, and their
Product is your Dividend, which divide by your Divisor, and the quotient is the
sixth number required, and answer to the question propounded.

In the disposing of the five given numbers you must always remember to make
the third and fifth numbers of one and the same Kind or Species.

Quest. 1. If 100 Pound in 12 Months gain 7 l. how much Money in 8 Months will
gain 3: 14: 8.

In the following Example of this question you find the three first numbers,
100, 12 and 7 do contain a supposition of the question, viz. suppose 100 l. in
12 months to gain 7 l. and the other two numbers 8 Months, and 3: 14: 8 contain
the demand of the question upon those suppositions, viz. how much Money in 8
Months will gain 3: 14: 8? which is according to the Instructions of the last
Chapter.

And according to the Instructions of this Chapter, I have made the third
number 7 l. and the fifth number 3 l. 14 s. 8 d. both of one Species or Kind,
that is to say, they both do signify Money gained, although one of them does
contain three denominations, and the other but one.

Here you must note that if any of the five numbers given are of different
denominations, you must reduce all the numbers of the same Kind or Species into
the lowest denomination named, as here in the following Example, the fifth
number contains three denominations, viz. Pounds, Shil ings, Pence, as 3: 14:
8, therefore I do not only reduce that fifth number into Pence, but the rest of
the five numbers, that are of the Species of Money, 100 l. and 7 l. and
afterward I proceed according to Instruction, as by the following Example.

Example.
^

^

The numbers given being orderly disposed as you see, the next thing I find the
first number, the third number, and the fifth number to be one of one Species,
viz. Money, but of different denominations, so I reduce them all three into the
lowest demination named which is Pence, the first number being reduced into
24000 d. the third number into 1680 d. and the fifth number into 896 d. at
which time the five numbers are 24000, 12, 1680, 8, 896. Then I proceed
according to the foregoing Instructions of this Chapter, and multiply the third
number 1680 by the fourth number 8, and the Product 13440 is the Divisor. Next
I multiply the fifth number 896 by the second number 12, and the Product
thereof is 10752, which I multiply again by the first number 24000, and the
Product thereof is 258048000 for the Dividend, which if you divide by the
Divisor 13440, the Quotient will give you 19200d. for the sixth Proportional or
answer to the Question propounded, which by Reduction you will find to be 80 l.
which does agree with the Question and Example of the last Chapter; the
Question and Example of this Chapter being the Reverse of that Question and
Example, and do prove one another, as you may perceive by their Examples.

This Question may also be resolved at two Operations, the first by the Rule of
Three Reverse, the other by the Rule of Three Direct.

If 12 Months require 100 l. what will 8 Months? answer 150 l.

If 7 l. require 150 l. Principle, what will 3: 14: 8 require Principle? Answer
80 l.

The first Operation by the Rule of 3 Reverse. ^

The second Operation by the Rule of Three. ^

Here you see the two Operations worked according to the Rule of Three Reverse
in the first Operation, and according to the Rule of Three Direct in the second
Operation, and they do produce the same answer as before, viz. 80.

And in like manner must you work in all other questions of this nature,
supposing this question and Example sufficient to explain the meaning of this
Rule.

CHAP. IX.
Reduction of Fractions.
BEFORE we treat of Reduction of Fractions, it will be convenient to show the
Learner what a Fraction is.

A Fraction or Broken Number is a part or many parts of any whole number, and
it is usually expressed by two numbers in smaller figures, one above the other,
with a little Line drawn between them, thus the figure or figures, standing
above the Line, are called the Numerator, the other underneath the Line are
called the Denominator, as by Example, 3 quarters is a Fraction, and must be
thus expressed, whereof 3 standing above the Line, is called the Numerator, and
4 which stands under the Line is called the Denominator, it being always
convenient that the Numerator be always less than the Denominator, for if the
Numerator be either greater or equal to the Denominator, it is then an improper
Fraction.

Reducing of Fractions are according to the several Heads following.
1. To Reduce a mixed number into an improper Fraction equal thereunto. 2. To
Reduce a whole number into an improper Fraction. 3. To Reduce an improper
Fraction into its equivalent whole (or mixed) number. 4. To Reduce any Fraction
into his lowest equivalent term, to the Fraction given. 5. To find out the true
value or worth of a Fraction in the known parts of Coin, Weight, Measure, etc.
6. To Reduce Compound Fractions to a simple one of the same value. 7. To Reduce
diverse Fractions of several unequal Denominators, to Fractions of equal
Denominators, and of the same value. 8. To Reduce a Fraction of one
Denomination into another Fraction that is of the same value.
1. To Reduce mixed Numbers to an improper Fraction.
A mixed Number is composed of two Parts, or Numbers, whole and broken Integers
and Fractions, the whole Numbers being composed of Integere, the broken being a
Fraction annexed to the whole Number, as in the mixed Mumber 48 2/86, 48 is the
whole number, and 12/16 is the broken number, showing that one Integer of 48
being divided into 16 parts, this 12/16 does signify that there does belong to
48, 12 of the 16 parts, the Rule is thus:

Multiply the whole number, by the Denominator of that Fraction annexed to him,
and to the Product thereof, add the Numerator of the same Fraction, then set
their sum, over the Denominator with a Line between them. And this new
Fraction, though improper, shall be equal to the mixed Number given.

Example.
Let the mixed Number beforementioned 48, 1/16 be required to be Reduced into
an improper Fraction equal thereunto, multiply the whols Number 48 by the
Denominator ^
16, and the Product is 768, to which add the Numerator 12, and they do make
780, which is so many sixteens, therefore I set down 780, and underneath 16,
drawing a Line between them as you see which is an improper Fraction, but
containing 780 sixteens is equal to the mixed number 48 12/16 as was required.

2. To Reduce a whole Number to an improper Fraction.
Multiply the whole Number given by the intended Denominator, and place the
Product of the Multiplication over the Denominator, and draw a Line between.

Example.
Let it be required to Reduce the whole Number 24 into a Fraction whose
Denominator is 8, multiply the whole Number 24 by 8, and ^
the Product is 192, which I set over the Denominator 8, and draw a Line
between, so 192 is the Numerator, and 8 the Denominator, making 192/8 equal to
24 the whole Number.

3. To Reduce an improper Fraction into a whole or mixed Number equivalent
thereunto.
Divide the Numerator by the Denominator, and the Quotient will give the whole
Number equal thereunto, that is equal to the improper Fraction given; and if
any thing remain make it the Numerator, and make the Divisor Denominator, as
you may see in the following Example.

Example.
Let it be required to Reduce the improper Fraction 357/12 into a mixed Number
equivalent thereunto, I divide the Numerator 357 by the ^
Denominator 12, and the Quotient is 29, which is the whole Number, and there
does remain 9, which I make a Numerator, setting 12 the Divisor underneath for
a Denominator, so you have the mixed Number 29 9/12 equal to the improper
Fraction 357/12 as was desired.

4. To Reduce a Fraction into its lowest terms equal thereunto.
If the Numerator and Denominator of the Fraction propounded be even numbers.
Take the half of either as often as you can, and if either Numerator or
Denominator be odd numbers, or falls out to be so in the halfing, then divide
them by any number that will divide both Numerator and Denominator without any
thing remaining in either, and when you have thus brought both Numerator and
Denominator as low as you can, then this new Fraction shall be equal to the
given Fraction.

Example.
Let it be required to Reduce the given Fraction 192/67 into the lowest terms.
First I take the half of the Numerator 192,

192 96 48 24 12 6 2 672 336 168 84 42 21 7 which is 96. Likewise half the
Denominator which is 336, so it is brought to 96/336, then I take half the
Numerator 96, which is 48, and half the Denominator 336 which is 168, and they
two numbers make the Fraction 48/18, and by the halfing 48/168 I bring it to
24/84 the half of which is 12/42, and the half of that 6/21, and because here
the Denominator is an odd number 21, which will not admit of halfing, I try to
divide them by 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. finding that 3 does divide both the Numerator 6
and the Denominator 21 without any remains, bringing the Fraction to 2/7 which
is the lowest it can be brought, whereby I conclude 2/7 to be as much or
equivalent with 192/672.

Another way of Abbreviation.
There is a more excellent and quicker way to Abbreviate or Reduce a Fraction
into its lowest term, which is thus: First, divide the Denominator by his
Numerator, and if any thing remain let your Divisor be divided by that number,
and if any thing do still remain of this Division, divide your last Divisor by
this last Remainder, and so do until o remain, and the Divisor of that last
Division shall be the number which shall Abbreviate your Fraction by dividing
both your Numerator and Denominator, and reduce them at once into the lowest
terms.

Example.
It is required to Abbreviate 1152/2592 into its lowest terms, by a certain
number which shall divide both Numerator and Denominator, without any
Remainder, the Quotient of which Divisions shall give the Numerator and
Denominator equivalent in the lowest terms.

Divide the Denominator 2592, by the Numerator 1152, and there will remain 288,
therefore divide your Divisor 1152 by 288, and there will remain 0, the Divisor
of this last Division was 288, which is the common number, by which if you
divide the Numerator of your given Fraction 1152, the Quotient gives 4 for a
new Numerator, by which I likewise do divide the Denominator 2592, and the
Quotient gives 9 for a new Denominator, and 0 remains of either of these
Divisions, whereby I find the new Fraction 4/9 is the same in signification as
1152/2592 being equivalent or equal thereunto in the lowest terms it can be
reduced to, as was required.

Note.
If both Numerator and Denominator of any Fraction do end with a Cipher, or
Ciphers, you may cast off as many Ciphers from one as from the other, and the
remaining figure will give a Fraction of the same value as the given Fraction
before was of, Example 200/500 by cutting off the Ciphers will be reduced unto
which signifies as much in value as the given Fraction 200/500.

V. To find the value of any Fraction in the known parts of Coin, Weight,
Measure, etc.
Multiply the Numerator by the number of Units in the next inferior
Denomination equal to an Unit of the same Denomination, as the Fraction given
divide the Product of that Multiplication by the Denominator, and the Quotient
gives the value in such parts as you did multiply by; but if any number does
remain, multiply such remainder by the number of Units in the next inferior or
lesser Denomination, and divide by your last Divisor, or Denominator of your
given Fraction; do thus until you have 0 remaining, or until you have brought
it as low as you can, and the several Quotients give the true value of the
Fraction in several Denominations, and if any thing remain of the last
Division, make it a Numerator over the same Denominator in your Fraction given.

Example.
It is required to know or find out the true value of 283/487 of a Pound
Sterling, the Fraction being given in a pound, the next inferior Denomination
is shillings wherein 20 Units make an integer in pounds, therefore I multiply
the Numerator of the given Fraction 283 by 20, the Product is 5660, which
divide by 487 the Denominator, and the Quotient gives me 11 shilling, but there
does remain of this Division 303, which I multiply by 12 the number of Units in
the next inferior Denomination, and the Product is 3636, which I likewise
divide by 487, and the Quotient gives me 7 pence, and there does remain 227,
which I multiply by 4 the number of Units in the next inferior Denomination,
and the Product 1008 I divide by 487 as before, and the Quotient gives me 2
farthings, and there still remains 34, which I put as a Numerator over the old
Denominator 487, so I find the just value of 283/487 of a pound sterling is 11
s. 7 d. 2 f. 34/487 as you may see by the succeeding work.

^

VI. To Reduce a Compound Fraction into a simple one of the same value.
A SimpleFraction consists but of one Numerator and one Denominator; but a
Compound Fraction does consist of many Numerators, and as many Denominators of
of 7/16 of a pound Sterling is a Compound Fraction, because there are more
Denominations than one represented in the Fraction.

When a Compound Fraction is given to be converted into a single Fraction,
multitiply all the Numerators together, and the Product thereof make a new
Numerator, then Multiply all the Denominators together, and the Product thereof
make a new Denominator, which new Numerator and Denominator shall be a Single
or Simple Fraction and equal to the Compound Fraction given.

Example.
It is required to Reduce 9/16 of 3/9 of of into a single or simple Fraction.
Multiply the several Numerators, 9, 3, 5, 3, one into another as you ^
see, the Product thereof will be 405, which make your Numerator, then multiply
all the Denominators in the samemanner and their Product will be 4608 which
make your Denominator. So have you the single Fraction 405/4608 equal to 9/16
of 3/9 of of as was required, whereby you may know the value of a Compound
Fraction: First by reducing the Compound Fraction into a simple one as you are
here taught, then by the Instructions of the fifth Rule of this Chapter you may
find its true value.

VII. To Reduce Fractions of unequal Denominators, into Fractions of the same
value having equal Denominators.
Multiply all the Denominators into one Sum, and the Product shall be the
common Denominator, then multiply each Numerator into all the Denominators but
his own, and the last Product put for a Numerator over the Denominator before
found. And this new Fraction is equal to the Fraction whose Numerator you
multiplied into the Denominators; do so by the rest, and you have your desire
fulfilled.

Example.
Reduce 243/578 and 7/16 into a common Denomination; do thus,

Multiply the Denominators 5, 7, 8 and 16 into one Sum, which will be 4480 for
a common Denominator. Then multiply the Numerator 2 into all the Denominators
but his own, viz. into 7, 8, and 16, and the Product thereof 1792 will be a
Numerator to the Denominator before found 4480, which new Fraction 1792/4480 is
equal to the first given Fraction, next proceed for a new Numerator to a second
Fraction by taking the next Numerator, which is 4, and multiply him by all the
Denominators, except his, that is by 5, 8 and 16, and the Product is 2560,
which is a new Numerator unto the Denominator before found 4480, and the new
Fraction 2560/4480 is equal to the second given Fraction, viz. 4/7. Likewise
multiply the Numerator 3 by the Denominators 5, 7, and 16, the Product gives
1680/4480 equal to the third given Fraction which is 9/8, then multiply the
last Numerator 7, by 5, 7, and 8, and the Product gives 1960/4480 equal to
7/16. So instead of 243/578 and 7/16, I have found 1792/4480 2560/4480
1680/4480 and 1960/4480 which have all equal Denominators, and each Fraction
equal to his respective given Fraction as was required.

VIII. To Reduce Fractions of one Denomination into another.
Reduction of Fractions of one Denomination to another, is twofold, viz.
Ascending or Descending. Ascending when a Fraction is to be reduced from a
lesser to a greater Denomination, as Fractions of pence into Fractions of
pounds; Descending when a Fraction of a greater Denomination is brought into a
lesser, as Fractions of pounds into Fractions of pence.

A Fraction being given to be reduced from a lower Denomination to a greater
Denomination, make of it a compound Fraction, by adjoining the parts of the
several Denominations, between that and the Denomination you would reduce it to
for Denominators, and a Unit for a Numerator, then by the 6th hereof reduce
your Compound Fraction to a Simple one.

Example.
It is required to know what part of a pound 7/9 of a farthing is?

To reduce this, you must make it a Compound Fraction, by considering that 1
farthing is of a penny, a penny is the 1/12 of a shilling, and a shilling the
1/20 of a pound, therefore 7/9 of a farthing is 7/9 of of 1/12 of 1/20, which
by the 6th hereof, having already made a Compound Fraction of it, you may bring
it to 7/8640 of a pound as was required.

To reduce Fractions of a greater Denomination into a lesser; you must multiply
the given Numerator by the parts contained in the several denominations between
the denomination your Fraction is of, and the denomination you would reduce it
to, then place the Product over your given Denominator.

Example.
I would reduce of a pound to the Fraction of a farthing.

Multiply the Numerator 5 by 20, by 12 and 4 into one Sum, the Product is 4800,
which put over the Denominator 8, and it makes 4800/8 of a farthing equal to of
a pound as was required.

And if the Fraction propounded to be reduced be in weight, you must then have
respects to the parts contained in the several denominations of weight.

CHAP. XII.
Addition of Fractions.
ADdition of Fractions is the putting or joining together of several broken
numbers, thereby to make one principal Fraction of them all, and in this and
the next, observe that all Fractions proper or improper, must be of one
denomination, or by the former Rules must be reduced thereunto, and when you
have so reduced them, add all the Numerators together, and subtract their total
sum for a new Numerator over the common Denominator.

Example.
It is required to know the sum of 17/36 19/36 12/36 18/36, here you have one
common Denominator, which is 36, and the sum of Numerators, 17, 19, 12, 18, is
66, which put as a Numerator over the Denominator thus 66/3, and by the former
Rules of the last Chapter you may reduce them to the mixed number 1: 30/36.

But if the Fractions that are required to be added together be of unequal and
different Denominators, bring them a common Denominator by the 7th Rule of the
last Chapter, and having so reduced them follow the foregoing instructions.

CHAP. XIII.
Subtraction of Fractions.
THE instruction given in Addition of Fractions are likewise here to be
followed in Subtraction of Fractions, in reducing the Fractions given to one
Denomination, and before any Subtraction is to be made the Fractions must be
reduced to a common Denominator, then deduct one Numerator from the other, and
set the remainder over the common Denominator, which Fraction is the difference
between the given Fractions.

Example.
It is required to subtract 3/7 from 7/9 by the 7th of the 11th Chapter, you
may reduce the said given Fractions into a common Denominator, which will be
49/63 and 27/63, subtract the lesser Numerator 27 from the greater 49, and
there will remain 22, which place over the Denominator 63 makes the Fraction
22/63 which is the difference between the two given Fractions as was required.

Secondly, If you are to subtract a broken number from a whole number, you must
borrow a Unit and convert it into a Fraction by making both Denominator and
Numerator equal to the Denominator of the Fraction given, then take the lesser
Numerator out of the greater, and place the remainder as a Numerator over the
given Denominator, and for one you borrowed of the whole number, pay a Unit by
subtracting a Unit from the whole number and the remainder set down before the
Fraction found as before, and the mixed number is the remainer or difference
between the two given Fractions, when they are taken one from the other.

Example.
It is required to subtract 7/16 from 12, here 7/16 is a fraction or broken
number, and 12 is the whole number, from which whole number I take a Unit and
make a Fraction of, so the number is 11 16/16, then I deduct the Fraction 7/16
from 11 16/16, taking the Numerator 7 out of the Numerator 16, and there
remains 9, which I make a Numerator over the Denominator given 16, and set down
11 ^
before the said Fraction as you see, So shall the difference or remainer
between the two given Fractions be 11 9/16 as was required.

Thirdly, If it be required to subtract a Fraction from a mixed number, or one
mixed number from another, reduce the Fractions into a common Denominator by the
7th of the 11th, and when you have so done, if the Numerator of the Fraction to
be subtracted, be less than the Numerator of the Fraction from whence you
subtract, then take one from the other, and the remainer is the Numerator to
that common Denominator, then subtract the less whole number from the greater,
and that remainer with the Fraction annexed, is the difference between the two
given numbers.

Example.
It is required to subtract the mixed number 7 from the mixed number 9 5/9 by the
7th of the 11, the Fractions are reducted unto 27/72 and 40/72 therefore I
subtract the Numerator of the number to be subtracted being lesser, viz. 27/72
from ^
40/72 and the remainer is 13 which I set over the common Denominator 72 as a
Numerator. Likewise I subtract the whole number 7 from 9, and there remains 2,
by which I find that the mixed number 2 13/72 is the remainer or difference
between the two given mixed numbers 9 5/9 and 7 as was required.

But if the Fraction to be subtracted be greater than the Fraction from which
you are to subtract, reduce the Fractions as you were taught by 7th of the 11th
into a common Denominator, then subtract the greatest Numerator from the common
Denominator, add the remainer to the lesser Numerator, and their Sum make a new
Numerator to the common Denominator, and carry one to the whole number to be
subtracted, and subtract it from the greater whole number, and the remainer
with the Fraction annexed, being a mixed number, shall be the difference of the
two mixed numbers given.

Example.
It is required to subtract 24 3/4 from 28 2/6. By the 7th of the 11th the
Fraction 24 is reduced into 18/24, and the other Fraction 28 2/6 into 8/24, now
because the numerator 18 cannot be subtracted from 8, therefore I subtract the
Numerator 18 from 24 the common Denominator, and there remains 6, ^
which I add to the Numerator 8, and it makes 14, which makes a new Numerator
to the common Denominator 24, then I carry 1 to the whole number 24, saying 25
from 28, and there remains 3, so the mixed number 3 14/24 is the remainer and
difference between the two Fractions given 28 2/6 and 24 as was required.

Fourthly, If you are to subtract Fraction of Fractions from Fraction of
Fractions, that is one Compound Fraction from another, you must by the 6th of
the 11. reduce the two Compound Fractions given into two Simple or Single
Fractions, then by the 4th of the 11, you abbreviate those two Fractions, and
by the first Example of this Chapter subrtact them.

Example.
Let it be required to subtract 2/7 of 3/16 of from of 5/7 of 8/12 by the 6th
of the 11, you reduce 2/7 of 3/16 of into the Simple Fraction 30/896, and of
5/7 of 8/12 into 120/672, now these two single Fractions 30/896 and 120/672,
which two Fractions by the 4th of the 11th you may abbreviate to 15/448 and
60/336, then by the 7th of the 11. reduce these two last Fractions into a
common Denominator, and you will make the Fractions 26880/161528 5040/161528
subtract the lesser Numerator 5040 out of the greater 26880, and there remains
21840, which put as a Numerator over the common Denominator, and you will have
the Fraction 21840/161528 which is the difference between the two Compound
Fractions 2/7 of 3/16 of and of 5/7 of 8/12 as was required.

CHAP. XIV.
Muliplication of Fractions.
IF the Fractions you are to multiply are Simple Fractions, multiply the
Denominators one by another, the Product is a new Denominator, also multiply
the Numerators one by another, and their Product is a new Numerator, and this
new Fraction is the Product of the Multiplication required.

Example.
It is required to multiply 2/6 by.

The Product of the two Denominators 6 and 8, multiplied together is 48, and
the Product of the two Numerators 2 and 3 is 6, therefore the new Fraction
6/48, which by abbreviation is, is the Product of the two Fractions 2/6 and
multiplied one by another as was required.

If the given Fractions to be multiplied be mixed numbers, by the first of the
11th, you must first put either the whole number into his broken by reducing
them into improper Fractions, and then multiply Numerator by Numerator, and
Denominator by Denominator, their Products will give you a new Numerator and
Denominator for a new Fraction, which new Fraction shall be the Product
required, but this Fraction will be an improper Fraction, therefore if you
divide the Numerator by the Denominator, the Quotient gives the whole numbers,
and the remainer is the Numerator, and the Divisor the Denominator of the
proper Fraction, and this mixed number found shall be the true Product as before.

Example.
It is required to multiply 36 5/9 by 18, by the 1st of the 11, the mixed number
36 5/9 is 329/9 and the mixed number 18 is 92/5, now multiply the two Numerators
329 and 92 together, the Product is 30268, which is your new Numerator, and the
Product of the two Denominators 9 and 5 is 45 the new Denominator, so have you
the improper Fraction 30268/45 being the Product required; but if you divide
the Numerator 30268 by the Denominator 45, the Quotient gives the whole number
672, and the remainer 28 is Numerator to the Divisor 45, so the mixed number 672
28/45 is the Product of 36 5/9 multiplied by 18 as was required.

If a Compound Fraction be given to be multiplied by a Simple or Single
Fraction, reduce that Compound Fraction given into a Simple one by the 6. of
the 11th, and proceed according to the instructions of the first Example, in
multiplying one by another.

Example.
Let it be required to multiply 3/7 by of 2/9 of 3/12, and this Compound
Fraction of 2/9 of 3/12 is by the 6th of the 11th reduced to the Simple or
Single Fraction 18/864, which by abbreviation is 1/48, which multiplied by 3/7,
the Product is 3/326 as was required.

If the Fractions given to be multiplied are both Compound Fractions, reduce
them into Simple ones both, by the 6th of the 11th, and proceed as before, and
you have the Product for answer.

Example.
It is required to multiply 7/9 of of by 6/7 of of 2/8 by the 6th of the 11th,
the Compound Fraction 7/9 of of is reduced unto 105/270 and 6/7 of of unto
36/84, multiply these two simple Fractions Numerator by Numerator, and
Denominator by Denominator, and you will have the new Fraction 3750/22680,
which by abbreviation is 125/756, both which last Fractions are either of them
equal to the Product of the two given Compound Fractions, multiplied one by
another as was required.

If it be required to multiply a Fraction by a whole number, make that whole
number a Numerator, and set 1 under him for a Denominator, so the Fraction will
be improper, but multiply their Numerators and Denominators together as before.

Example.
It is required to multiply 16 by there efore I make a Fraction of the whole
number thus 16/1, which multiplied by 3/7, produces 48/7, or 6 6/7 as was
required.

CHAP. XV.
Division of Fractions.
IF the Dividend and Divisor the two Fractions given are both Simple or Single
Fractions, set the Divisor next the left hand, and the Dividend even with it
toward the right hand, then multiply them cross-wise thus: Multiply the
Numerator of the Dividend, by the Denominator of the Divisor, and the Product
is the new Numerator, then multiply the Denominator of the Dividend by the
Numerator of the Divisor, and the Product is a new Denominator, which new
Fraction is the Quotient you do desire.

Example.
It is required to divide by, to effect it I proceed thus, being the Dividend,
and the Divisor, ^
I place them as you see, the Divisor to the left hand, and the Dividend to the
right, so I multiply the Numerator of the Dividend 4 by the Denominator of the
Divisor 4, the Product is 16, for a new Numerator, then I multiply the
Denominator of the Dividend 5 by the Numerator of the Divisor 3, and the
Product 15 is the new Denominator, so I find 16/13 or 1 1/15 is the Quotient
sought.

Secondly, if you divide a Simple Fraction by a Compound, or a Compound by a
Simple, or Compound by Compound, reduce such Compound Fractions to simple
Fractions, then proceed according to the last Example.

Example.
It is required to divide 7/9 of 12/16 by of, you must reduce 7/9 of 12/6,
which makes the Simple or Single Fraction 84/144, and of of 10/24, so 84/144 is
the Dividend, and 10/24 is the Divisor, which multiplied cross-wise, as ^
in the last Example, does produce the Fraction 4216/4410 for the Quotient,
which in a proper Fraction is 1 576/1440.

If the Dividend or Divisor, or both be mixed numbers, reduce them to improper
Fractions, and perform the Division as in the two last Examples.

Example.
It is required to divide 22 3/9 by 7 the improper Fraction of 22 3/9 is 201/9
and of 7 is 21/3, so the improper Fraction 23/3 is the Divisor, ^
and 201/9 is the Dividend, which if you do multiply cross-wise, you will have
the improper Fraction 603/207, now if you divide the Numerator of this Fraction
603 by the Denominator 207, the Quotient gives 2, and there will remain 189,
which is the Numerator, and the Disor 207 the Denominator, so the mixed number 2
189/207 is the Quotient required.

And in like manner must you work if you divide a Fraction by a whole number,
or a whole number by a Fraciion, as you see in this last Example.

CHAP. XVI.
The Rule of Three Direct in Fractions.
IN the Direct Rule of Three in Fractions there are four things to be observed
and practiced.

1. That the Fractions of the first and third places be of one Denomination, as
Money, Weight, or Measure.

2. That if any of the given Fractions be Compound, they must be reduced to
simple of the same value.

3. If any of the Fractions given should be mixed numbers, reduce it into an
impro-Fraction.

4. If any of the three terms given should be a whole number, make it an
improper Fraction by putting a Unite for his Denominator.

The Solution of the Rule of Three Direct in Fractions is performed the same
way as in whole numbers, that is to say, multiply the second and third
Fractions together by the 14th Chapter, and the Product thereof by the first
Fraction, according to the fifteenth Chapter, and the Quotient is the fourth
Fraction required.

Another Way.
Multiply the Numerator of the first Fraction by the Denominators of the second
and third Fractions, the Product thereof is a new Denominator; then multiply
the Denominator of the first Fraction by the Numerators of the second and third
Fractions, and the Product is the new Numerator, and this Fraction is the
fourth proportional Fraction required, and answer to the Question, which if it
should fall out to be an improper Fraction, must be reduced into a whole or
mixed number by the third of the eleventh.

Quest. 1. If of a Pound weight cost 5/12 l. what will 9/21 of a Pound weight
cost?

^

Having disposed of the given Fractions according to the four first Rules of
this Chapter and the seventh, I proceed to the Solution thus. Multiply the
Numerator of the first Fraction which is 3 by 12, and 12 the Denominators of
the second and third Fractions, the Product will be 432 for a new Denominator.
Then multiply 8 the Denominator of the first Fraction by 5 and 9 the Numerators
of the second and third Fractions; the Product thereof is 360, which is a new
Numerator. So I have found the fourth proportional Fraction 360/432 for answer
to the Question propounded, and by abbreviation is found equal to or 16 s. 8 d.

CHAP. XVII.
The Rule of Three Backward in Fractions.
FOr disposing of the given Fractions follow the four Rules in the last
Chapter, and the way of resolving is not different from the Instructions of the
eighth Chapter, for it was there showed how to find out a fourth proportional
to three given numbers.

When you have a Question to be resolved by this Rule, then the third Term is
the Divisor, then having exactly reduced the Terms given according to the Rules
of the last Chapter, then multiply the Numerator of the third Fraction by the
Denominators of the second and first Fractions, and the Product gives a new
Denominator, Then multiply the Denominator of the third Fraction by the
Numerators of the second and first Fraction, and the Product gives a new
Numerator, and this new Fraction is the fourth proportional Fraction and answer
to the Question propounded.

Quest. If of a Yard of Cloth, that is 1 Yard will make a Garment, how much of
another piece of Cloth that is 1 Yard wide will make the same Garment.

^

Here you see in this Question the second and third Fractions are mixed
Fractions, there you see they are reduced to improper Fractions, so the three
given Fractions are, 7/4 and 7/5. Now according to the former Instructions of
this Chapter, I multiply the Numerator of the third Fraction being 3, by the
Denominators of the second and first Fractions, which is 4 and 8, the Product
thereof is 224, which is a new Denominator. Then I multiply the Deuominator of
the third Fraction 5 by the Numerators of the second and first Fractions, which
is 7 and 7, the Product thereof will be 245, which is a new Numerator. So I
have found out the improper Fraction 245/224, which reduced is 1 21/224 equal
to 1 3/32, which is the answer to the propounded Question.

CHAP. XVIII.
The Rule of Practice.
THE Rule of Practice is so called because it is the Practice of the other
Rules, and chiefly of the Rule of Three, in a far more compendious and shorter
way, being by some called the brief Rules, because thereby many Questions may
be operated with more expedition than by the Rule of Three, and because this
Rule is so expeditious in finding a resolution to any Question propounded, it
is therefore of infinite great Use amongst Merchants, Tradesmen and others.

It is very convenient 1 times 12 is 12 2 24 3 36 4 48 5 60 6 72 7 84 8 96 9 108
for the Learner to get perfectly by Heart the annexed Table containing the
Product of 12 multiplied by all the nine Digits, for the speedy reducing Pence
into Shillings, and Shillings into Pence; and for reducing Shillings into
Pounds, I refer the ingenious Reader to the sixth Chapter, in Reduction of Money.

s. f. The even Parts of a Shilling. 6 is the 4 3 2 1 1 1/12 1/16 1/24 1/48

s. d. The even Parts of a Pound. 10 is the 6 8 5 0 4 0 3 4 2 6 2 0 1/10 1 8
1/12 1 0 1/20

I would likewise advise the Learner to get the two foregoing Tables by Heart,
the first containing the even parts of a Shilling, the second the even parts of
a Pound.

When a Question is propounded to be resolved, you must consider whether the
price of the Integer be parts of a Shilling, or parts of a Pound.

And whether the said price be either the even part of a Shilling, or the even
part of a Pound; if it be neither the even part of a Shilling, nor the even
part of a Pound, you may divide the said price into so many parts that each
part may be the even part either of a Shilling or Pound, as 5 d. may be divided
into three even parts of a Shilling, viz. 3 d. which is of a Shilling, 2 d.
which is, and which is 1/16.

Proposition 1.
If the price of a Unite of the Sum propounded be a Farthing, I find by the
Table a Farthing to be the 1/48 of a Shilling, but because the 48. part of any
Sum is not so soon taken as the, the, the, the, the, and the like, therefore
because 8 Farthings make 2 d. I divide the given number by 8, that is to say, I
take the eighth part, and if any thing remain they are all Farthings. Then by
the Table I find that 2 d. is of a Shilling, therefore take the sixth part of
them for Shillings, and what remains is so many two Pences; now these Shillings
reduce into Pounds, by cutting off the first figure to the right hand, with a
small stroke with your pen; then draw a line underneath, and take half of the
remaining figures, which I set under the line for so many Pounds; but if the
last figure you are to halve be an odd figure, take the half and add 10 to the
figure cut off, for that figure and the 10 added together makes so many
Shillings.

Example. Let it be required to know how much 9783 l. at a Farthing per Pound
comes to. First, as you see in the following Example, take the eighth part of
9783, and it is 1222 two Pences, and 7 Farthings remaining, which is 1: I set a
little distance to the right hand, next by the Table of the even parts of a
Shilling, I find 2 d. to be the 1/0 part, therefore I draw a line under 1222,
and take the part thereof, which is 203 Shilling, and 4 remaining which is so
many two pences; therefore I set down 8 under the last Remainer, I draw a line
under these Shillings 203, and reduce them into Pounds, according to the
Instructions hereof, and of the sixth Chapter of Reduction of Money, by cutting
off the first figure toward your right hand, which is 3, and drawing a line I
take the half of the Remainer 20, which is 10 Pounds, and the figure 3 cut off
signifies so many Shillings. Now I add all these odd Remains together, viz.
1:, 8 d. unto 10 l. 3 s. So the whole Sum is 10: 3: 9:, the Resolution of the
propounded Question, as by the following Operation.

^

For the more clear demonstration of what has been so far said of this Rule, I
shall set down more Examples.

^

In the first Example it is propounded 65937 l. at a Farthing per Pound, the
thereof is 8242 two Pences, and Farthing remaining, the of 8242 two Pences is
1373 Shillings, and 4 two pences remaining is 8 d. Next the 1/20 of 1373
Shillings is 68 Pounds, and 13 Shillings remaining; so taking all the Remains
to this last Sum, it makes 68: 13: 8, and so much does 65937 l. come to at a
Farthing per Pound; and in the same manner is the other Example explained. The
reason why I take the and in these Examples of a Farthing, and not 1/48, is
because the of is equal to 1/48.

Proposition 2.
If the value of a Unite in the Sum of the propounded Question be 2 Farthings,
then first take the and afterward the; for although 2 Farthings be the 1/24 of
a Shilling, yet of 1/^ is equal thereunto, and done with more ease and less
charge to the memory than to take the 1/24 of any Sum, having thus taken the to
reduce them into two pences, if any thing remain they are so many half pence,
then reduces them into Shillings as before.

Examples.
^

^

In the first of these Examples it is required to know how much 57632 l. at 2
quarters per Pound comes unto, knowing 4 half pence do make 2 d. I therefore
do take of 57632 which is 14408 two pences; then I take of 14408 which is 2401
Shillings, and there remains 2 two pences which is 4 d. Then the 1/20 of 2401
Shillings is 120 Pounds, and there does remain 1 Shillings. So the Sum makes
120 l. 1 s. 4 d.

In the second Example the of 76597 is 19149 two pences, and there remains 1
half penny; the of 19149 is 3191 Shillings, and there does remain 3 two pences,
which is 6 Pence, and the 1/20 of 3191 is 159 Pound, and 11 Shillings
remaining. So the whole Sum does amount 10 159 l. 11 s. 6 d. 2 quarters.

Proposition 3.
If the price of a Unite in Sum propounded be 3 Farthings, then take the of Sum
propounded which will be three pences, and if any thing remains it will be so
many three farthings. Then the of the three pences is Shillings, and what does
remain is so many three pences, and the 1/20 of those Shillings is Pounds, as
before.

Example.
^

In the last of these Examples you find it required for to know how much 769327
l. at 3 Farthings per Pound comes to? the of 769327 is 192331 three pences,
and there remains three times three Farthings, which is 2 d. 1 qu. then the of
192331 is 48082 Shillings, and there remains 3 three pences, which is 9 d. Then
the 1/20 of 48082 is 2404 Pounds and 2 Shillings remaining. So the whole
amounts unto 2404: 2: 11: 1 qu.

Proposition 4.
If the price of an Unite of the Sum propounded to be resolved be an even part
of a Shilling, and above the value of 3 Farthings, divide the number given
whose value is sought, by the Denominator of the Fraction representing the even
part, the Quotient thereof will be Shillings, then take (...) for Pounds as
before.

Example. Let it be required to know how much 28376 l. at 1/^ comes to? by the
Table I find 1: is 1/^ of a Shilling, therefore I divide the number 28376 by 8,
or which is all one, I take the (...) which is 35^7 Shillings, the 1/20 of 3547
Shillings is 177 Pound and 7 Shillings remaining, as by the following Operation.

^

Of every even part of a Shilling above the value of 3 Farthings, I have
demonstrated by these following Examples, which need little or no explanation,
being so plain that at first sight they may be understood.

Examples.
^

^

^

Proposition 5.
If the price of a Unite of the propounded Sum be Pence, and not the even part
of a Shilling, then you must divide the price given into even parts, as 7 d. is
no even part of a Shilling, yet may be divided into even parts, as 4 d. and 3
d. make 7 d. and are both even parts of a Shilling, in which case work thus.
First take and then the 1/^ of the given number, and add the and of the number
given together, and you have the true number of Shillings, the 1/20 whereof is
Pounds as before. Likewise 9 d. is and or three times, 11 d. is and 1/^ and or
else it is 1/^ and and of a Shilling, as by the following Operations does more
plainly appear, where you have an Example of every uneven part of a Shilling,
the price being any number of pence only.

^

^

^

Proposition 6.
When the price of a Unite of the given number be Pence and Farthings, and if
it be an even part of a Shilling, work as in the fourth Proposition; but if it
be uneven parts of a Shilling, as 1:, 1:, 2: 1/^, 2:, or the like.

First find out some part of the price that is an equal part of a Shilling;
then consider what part the Remainer of the price is of that even part, and
divide that even part thereby, then take their Sum which is the true number of
Shillings, the 1/20 whereof is Pounds, as before.

Example. It is required to know how much 28762 l. is worth at 1:. First I take
the 1/12 which is 2396 Shillings, and ^ there remains 10 d. Now 2396 Shillings
10 d. being the value of the said number at 1 d. per Pound, and 1 Farthing
being of a Penny, therefore the of the value at 1 d. per Pound 2396 Shillings
and 10, which is 599 Shillings 2: is the value of the said number at 1 Farthing
per Pouud which added together gives 2996 Shillings one half penny, the 1/20
whereof 149: 16: 0: 2 qu. is the whole Sum required.

^

^

^

^

^

In the foregoing Examples you may perceive how the several Examples are
wrought by dividing the given price into so many even parts as will make the
complete price, although it may consist of 3, 4 or 5 Divisions, as in the 10.
Example the price is 11 d. 3 qu. which is made up with the, and 1/^, and of
the, and the of the, and the of that, as 6, 4, 1, and, which all put together
makes 11.

Proposition 7.
If the price of a Unit of the given number be 2 Shillings, cut off the figure
toward the right hand of the given number, and double it, the Product will be
Shillings, and the remaining figures toward the left hand are Pounds.

Example.
Let it be required to know how much 1283 Yards are worth at 2 Shillings per
Yard, the figure toward the right hand which is 3 being cut off and doubled
makes 6 Shillings, and the remaining figures 128 are Pounds. So ^
the true worth of 1283 Yards at 2 Shillings per Yard comes to 128 Pounds, 6
Shillings, as by the annexed Example may appear, being the answer and solution
of the question, as was required.

By this Proposition we gather, that when the price of any number of Yards,
Pounds, etc. is an even number of Shillings, with the half of the even number,
multiply the given number, but double the first figure of the Product, and set
it apart for Shillings, and the rest of the Product shall be Pounds.

Example.
Let it be required to know how much 5783 Else of Linen comes unto at 14 s.
per Ell, for the solution whereof, I take ^
half of the price given, which is 7, and therewith I do multiply the given
number 5783; saying, 7 times 3 is 21; now according to the Rule I double the
first figure 1, which makes 2 Shillings, setting it apart, and I carry 2 to the
next figure, saying, 7 times 8 is 56, and 2 as I carried is 58, set down 8 and
carry 5, proceeding according to the Instructions of the 4. Chapter, and you
will find the remaining part of the Product, to be 4048. So I find that 5783
Yards, Else or Pounds at 14 is worth 4048 l. 2 s. as by the annexed Example
does appear.

Proposition 8.
If the price of a Unit of the given number be any odd number of Shillings,
work the even number of Shillings by the last Example of the 7. Proposition,
and for the odd Shillings take the 1/20 of the given number, and add these two
together, and you will find your desire, as by these following Examples does
appear; where in the first toward your left hand it is required to know how
much 7393 Yards comes unto at 7 s. per Yard, for the even number of ^ 6 s. per
Yard by the second Example of the 7. Proposition, 7393 Yards comes to 2217 l.
18 s. then the 1/20 of 7393 is 369 l. 13 s. which added together make 2587 l.
11 s. the true value of 7393 Yards as was required, and in like manner is the
other Example operated for 3767 Yards at 9 s. per Yard.

Proposition 9.
If the price of a Unit of the given number be 5 s. then the Operation,
although it be an odd number of Shillings, may by taking the 4 be done sooner,
as by the following Examples does more plainly appear.

^

Proposition 10.
If the price of a Unite of the given number be Shill. and Pence, or Shill.
Pence and Farthings, if the Shill. and Pence be an even part of a Pound, divide
the number given by the Denominator of that Fraction representing the said even
part, as by the following Example wherein it is required to know how much 576
Yards amount to at 3 s. 4 d. per Yard. First by the Table of the ^
even parts of a Pound I find 3 s. 4 d. to be the of a Pound, therefore I
divide 576 by 6, which is the Denominator of the Fraction, or which is all one,
I take the sixth part thereof which is 96, So I find that 576 Yards at 3 s. 4
d. comes unto 96 l. as was required.

For further explanation sake I have set down these several following Examples.

^

^

Proposition 11.
When the price of a Unit of the number given is Shillings and Pence, but not
the even part of a Pound, you must reduce them into even parts, as 8 s. 4 d.
may be reduced into the even parts 6 s. 8 d. and 1 s. 8 d. which make 8 s. 4 d.

Likewise 7 s. 6 d. may be reduced into these even parts 5 s. and 2 s. 6 d.
which make up 7 s. 6 d. add together the several Products of such reduced even
parts, and their Sum is the answer to the question propounded, as by these
following Examples may appear.

^

^

^

Proposition 12.
When the price of a Unite of the given number is Pence and Shillings, but
cannot be reduced to even parts, then in such case multiply the given number by
the number of Shillings contained in the price given, and after by the fourth
or fifth Proposition hereof, then add the several Products found together,
their Sum is the total in Shillings, as by this Example following.

Let it be required to know how much 5734 Yards comes to at 9 s. 9 d. per
Yard: according to the Rule I multiply the given number 5734 by 9, the Product
gives me 51606 Shillings, therefore 9 d. being no even part of a Shilling, I by
the fifth Proposition divide them into even parts 6 and 3, taking the of the
given number 2867, and the which is 1433, these Products added together make
55906 Shillings and 6 Pence, the 1/20 thereof is 2795 Pounds, 6 Shillings and 6
Pence.

^

Proposition 13.
When the price of a unit of any number given be Shill. Pence and Farthings,
then tiply your given number by the number of Shillings contained in the given
price, and your Product will be Shillings; then for the Pence and Farthings
work by the sixth Proposition of this Chapter, as by the following Examples
does appear. In the first whereof it is required to know how much 1743 Yards
come to at 7 s. 3 d. 3/^^, first I multiply the given number 1743 by 7, the
number of Shillings in the price given, the Product thereof is 12201 Shillings;
then by the sixth Proposition I find the Product for 3 d., adding them together
I find they do make 12745 Shillings 8 d..

^

Proposition 14.
When the price of a Unite of any number given is Pounds, multiply the number
given by the number of Pounds contained in the price, and the Product is the
number of pounds required, as by these two following Examples you may discern.

^

Proposition 15.
When the price of any given number is Pounds and Shillings, work for the
Pounds as by the last Proposition, and for the Shillings as by the 7. and 8.
then add the several Products together, and the Sum is the value sought as was
required, as by these following Examples.

^

^

Proposition 16.
When the given price of a Unite of the number given is Pounds, Shillings,
Pence and Farthings. First, find out the whole value of the given number in
Shillings, Pence and Farthings, by the Instructions of the 13. Proposition of
this Chapter, as if there had been no Pounds in the given price, then for the
Pounds work as by the directions of the 15. Proposition, then add these two
Products thus found together, and their Product or Sum shall be the whole value
of the given number at the price propounded.

^

^

^

Proposition 17.
If the given number whose value is required be of several Denominations, as
Hundreds, Quarters and Pounds; for the Hundreds, follow the directions of the
last Proposition, and for 2 quarters take half the given price, for 1 quarter
take, for 14 pound take, for 7 pound take 1/16 of the given, then add all these
Products together, and you have the full value required, as by these following
Examples does appear.

CHAP. XIX.
The Rule of Fellowship without Time.
THe Rule of Fellowship without Time, is when several Merchants do put in each
man his several and particular Sum of Money, without any respect at all to any
Time, but to have such a proportion of the gain as he has in the Stock.

Example.
A, B, C and D make a Stock of 20 Pound, in which A has 5 Pound, which is, l.
A 5 B 10 C 3 D 2 20 B has 10 Pound which is, C has 3 l. which is 3/20, and D
has 2 Pound which 2/20. By this 20 Pound they do gain 7 l. which makes the
Stock 27 Pound; now that person that has in the first Stock, must also have
1/^ of the profit, which is 1 l. 15 s. and he that has of the first Stock must
have of the Profit which is 3 l. 10 s. and he that has and he that has 3/20
of the first Stock must likewise have 3/20 of the profit, which is 1 l. 1 s.
and he that has 2/20 of the first Stock must have 2/20 of the profit, which is
14 s. as you see.

Stock. Profit. A 1/^ 5 1 15 B 10 3 10 C 3/20 3 1 01 D 2/20 2 14 20 7

Now to find out each man's several share in the profit or loss, you must
collect the several Sums paid into Stock together, and by addition find their
Sum, then by the Rule say, As the Sum of the several partners shares is to the
profit or loss, so is each man's particular share in Stock to his particular
share in the profit or loss, and as many shares as the principal Stock does
contain, so many Operations will there be of the Rule of Three, the fourth
proportional of each Operation being the respective share in the profit or
loss, belonging to that share of the Stock, which is the third number in the
same Operation.

Example 1.
Four Partners, viz. A, B, C and D make up a Stock, in which Stock they have
each different and unequal shares. A puts in 160 l. B put in 80 Pound, C puts
in 144 Pound, and D put in 96 l. now there. was gained by the whole Stock 126 l
the question is how much of the 126 l. each Partner to is have according to his
share in the Stock.

l. s. d. A 160 B 80 C 144 D 96 480

According to the former directions, I add the several shares together, and
they do make 480 Pounds, now because there are four several shares, there will
be four Operations by the Rule of Three, which are as follow.

If 480 l. give 126 l. what will 160 l? Ans. 42 l.

If 480 l. give 126 l. what will 80 l? Ans. 21 l.

If 480 l. give 126 l. what will 144 l? Ans. 37 l. 16 s.

If 480 l. give 126 l. what will 96 l? Ans. 25 l. 04 s.

And these fourth proportionals found are due to the several partners over and
above their respective shares, as to A 42 l. to B 21 l. to C 37: 16, and to D
25 l. 4 s. as you see following, which being added altogether make 126 l. as
before, equal to the Sum that was gained.

A 42 B 21 C 37: 16 D 25: 04 126

The adding together of these fourth proportionals found is the proof of the
single Rule of Fellowship, for if they make up the same Sum as was gained by
the whole Stock, or lost, then your several Operations have been right worked,
if there be any difference you may certainly conclude you have committed some
error.

Example 2.
Two Partners join together and are resolved to make up a Stock, viz. A and B.
The first Partner A does resolve to have 4/7 of the profit, and lays in 1368
Pound. It is required to know how much B must pay into Stock to gain the
remaining 3/7 of the profit.

By the Rule of Three, say, If 4/7 of the gain which the first man A takes,
did pay into Stock 1368/1, how much must 3/7 of the gain lay into Stock, which
is the second man B profit, which by multiplying and dividing you will find to
be 1026l. and so much must B lay into Stock to gain 3/7 of the profit, if A
gains 4/7 by putting in 1368l.

Example 3.
Six Partners, viz. A, B, C, D, E and F build a Ship between them, amounting to
the Sum of 2376 Pounds: the several Partners put in as follows.

l. s. A put in 222 15 B 271 05 C 519 15 D 297 00 E 816 15 F 148 10 2376

These Partners let their Ship out to Freight for a certain Voyage for 1250 l.
It is required to know how much of the said Freight is due to the several
Partners. Therefore by the Rule of Three, as 2376l. the whole value of the Ship
is to 1250 l. the Freight, so is the several respective shares put in by the
said Partners, to their respective shares in 1250l. the Freight, which by
multiplying and dividing I find to be as follows.

Answer.
l. s. d. A 117 03 9 B 195 06 3 C 273 08 9 D 156 05 0 E 429 13 9 F 78 02 6 1250

If there happen to be a Loss, the several Partners must bear a proportional
share in the Loss, as they did in the Gain, which is to be found out after the
same manner. For as the general Stock of the Partners is to the general Loss,
so is the particular share in the Stock to the particular share in the Loss.

Example 4.
Three Merchants adventure to Sea 794 Pound. Viz. A has 148: 17: 6, B has
198: 10: 0, and C has 446: 12: 6. These Merchants have lost out of their
general Stock 213 l. 10 s. I require to know each man's share in the loss.

As 794 l. is to 213 l. 10 s. so is 148 l. 17 s. 6 d. to 40 l. 00 s. 7 d.

As 794 l. is to 213 l. 10 s. so is 198 l. 10 s. 0 d. to 53 l. 7 s. 6 d.

As 794 l. is to 213 l. 10 s. so is 446 l. 12 s. 6 d. to 120 l. 1 s. 10 d..

Answer.
A has lost 40 00 7 B 53 07 6 C 120 01 10 213 10

Here in this Example A has lost 40 l. 7 d., B has lost 53: 7: 6, and C has
lost 120: 1: 10:; each bearing such a proportional share in the Loss as they
have in the general Stock, and their respective shares in the Loss makes up
the just Sum of 213 l. 10 s. the general Loss as before.

CHAP. XX.
The Rule of Fellowship with Time.
THE Rule of Fellowship with Time, is when each Partners share in the Stock
has a Relation to the Time that it has remained in Stock. In this Rule you
must multiply each Partners particular share by the Time it has continued in
Stock; these several Products you may call for distinction sake their new
layings in. Then by the Rule of Three say, as the Sum of their new layings in
is to the profit made, so is each man's particular new laying in to his
particular share of profit.

Example 1.
Two Partners join Stocks together, viz. A laid in the first of April 475
Pounds, and B laid in the first of July 525 Pounds, and by the last of December
they had gained 360 Pound; now I desire to know each man's proportion of the
profit answerable to his share in Stock and Time.

A has for 9 Months 475 B has for 6 Months 525 1000

A share multiplied by his Time is 4275 B share multiplied by his Time is 3150
7425

As is to so is to 7425 360 4275 207 5 5: 6075/7425 7425 360 3150 152 14 6:
1350/7425

A share for 475 l. 9 mon. is 207: 5: 5: 6075/7425 B share for 525 l. 6 mon. is
152: 14: 6: 1^25/7445 Total Sum is 360

Example 2.
Two Partners are resolved to make a Stock together, viz. A puts in 380 l.
the first of May, and B cannot put any thing in till the first of August next.
I demand how much B ought to put into receive of the profit at the years end.

Multiply A share 380 by 8 Months, the time his Money abides in Company, the
Product thereof is 3040 l. for his new laying in. Now because B puts in
nothing until the first of August, his Money will lie in but 5 Months. Divide
3040 by 5, and thereof will come 608 l. and so much must B lay in to receive of
the profit, as was required.

Example 3.
Two Partners joined together in a Stock of 750 Pound, by which Stock they
gained 240 Pound, which put to the Stock makes 990 l. A his Money was in 12
Months, and B his Money was in 8 Months; when they divided the Money, A received
671 l. 8 s. 6 d. and 3/7, and B received 318 l. 11 s. 5 d. of. 4/^. I require
to know how much each man's Stock was at first? Then by the Rule of Three, if 12
Months give 750, 8 Months will give 500; there the Stock of A first put in was
500, which subtracted from 750, there remains the Stock of B, as was required.

Example 4.
Three Graziers hire a piece of Ground for 37: 10. A put into the said Ground
60 head of Oxen 15 days, B put into the said piece of Ground 48 head of Oxen 21
days, and C put in 75 head of Oxen 12 days: I desire to know how much each
Grazier must pay.

Oxen. days.
A 60 15 900 B 48 21 1008 C 75 12 900 2808

If give what will l. s. l. s. d. 2808 37 10 900 12 0 4 1296/2808 2808 37 10
1008 13 9 2 ^216/2808 2808 37 10 900 12 0 4 1^96/2808

l. s. d. A is to pay 12 0 4 1296/2808 B is to pay 13 9 2 ^^16/28088 C is to
pay 12 0 4 1296/2808 37 10 0 0

Which three several Sums being added together make 37 l. 10 s. which is the
Sum the three Graziers are to pay among themselves.

Example 5.
Three Merchants entered in a Trade of Company, as A, B, C, and put in several
Sums of Money for a Stock. A put in the first of January 250 l. and the first of
July following he takes out again 40 l. B. lays in the first of April 425 l.
and the first of September following he puts in 75 l. C laid in the first of
June 360 l. and the first of September following he took out again 60 l. at the
years end they found they had gained 275 l. I require to know how much each
Partner shall have of the said 275 l. gained.

Answer. First multiply the money that A laid in which was 250 l. by 12 Months,
the time it continued in Stock, the Product thereof is 3000 l. from thence
subtract 6 times 40 l. which is 240, for the money which he took out again, and
there does remain 2760, which is the just laying in of A. Then multiply 425 l.
the money B paid, by 9 Months his time of continuance, the Product thereof is
3825, whereto add 4 times 75 l. which is 300, for the money he laid in more the
first of September, the Sum whereof is 4125, the second man B his layings in.
Then for the money that C paid which was 360 l. multiply by 7 Months his time,
the Product thereof is 2520, from whence subtract 4 times 60 l. for the money C
took out the first of September which is 240, and there does remain 2280 the
third man C layings in.

A his new layings in 2760 B 4125 C 2280 9165

Then according to the Instructions of the first Example of this Chapter, add
all the new layings in together, the Sum whereof is 9165, then by the Rule of
Three the several Operations are as follow.

As is to so is to l. l. l. l. s. d. f. 9165 275 2760 82 16 3 2 4170/9165 9165
275 4125 123 15 5 1 5535/9165 9165 275 2280 68 08 2 3 8625/9165

A is to have 82 16 3 2 4170/9165 B 123 15 5 1 5535/9165 C 68 08 2 3 8625/9165
275

Which shares aforesaid being added all together make up the sum of the whole
gain 275.

The Proof of this Rule is not different from that of Fellowship without Time
laid down in the last Chapter.

CHAP. XXI.
Of Interest Simple and Compound, Purchases and Valuation of Annuities.
INterest is of two Kinds, Simple and Compound.

Simple Interest is when it is required so much per Cent. for so many years.

Compound Interest is as much as to say, Interest upon Interest, that is, you
add the Interest every year to the Principal, and the next year you account
Interest for their Sum being added both together.

Of Simple Interest.
Let it be required to know, if the Interest of 100 l. for 12 Months be 6 l.
what shall the Interest of 375 l. be for the same time.

Example 1.
For the effecting this Operation by the Rule of Practice, work thus. It is
here required to know the Interest of 375 l. at 6 per Cent. I therefore
multiply 6l. by 3, the Product thereof is 18l. which ^
is the Interest of 300 l. but there is 75l. more to know the Interest of,
whichis three quarters of a hundred, that is, of 100, the half whereof is 50 l.
the quarter 25 l. which make up 75 l. therefore under 18 l. I set down 3 l. the
half of 6 l. and 1 l. 10 s. the quarter of 6 l. and add all these together
their Sum is 22 l. 10 s. the Interest of 375 l. for 12 Months as was required.

Example 2.
I desire to know if the Interest of 100 l. for 12 Months be 6 l. what shall
the Interest of 450 l. be for 9 Months.

This question may be answered by two Operations of the Rule, as follows.

If require what shall answer 100 l. 6 l. 450 l. 27 l. 12 mon. 27 l. 9 mon. 20:
05

But by the first Example of the Double Rule of Three, you do this and such
like questions at one Operation. Thus

Say, if 100 l. for 12 Months gains 6 l. what shall 450 l. gain for 9 Months?

Set down the several numbers given in order as follow with their denominations
over head.

The Operation is thus, you have here five numbers given to find out a sixth
proportional, wherein 100 l. is the first Term, 12 the second, 6 the third, 450
and 9 the fifth Term.

Therefore multiply the two first Terms, viz. 100 and 12 together, the Product
thereof is 1200, then multiply the three last Terms, viz. 60, 450 and 9 into
one ^ another, and the Product thereof will be 24300, which is the Dividend to
be divided by the Divisor 1200; now because the Divisor and Dividend have each
two Ciphers, therefere I cut off the said Ciphers, and there remains 12 for the
Divisor, and 243 for the Dividend, which being divided the Quotient is 20,
which is so many Pounds, but there remains 3, which being the quarter of 12 I
set down in the Quotient 5 s. So I find the Interest of 450 l. for 9 Months is
20 l. 5 s. at the Rate of 6 l. per 100 l. as before.

But to avoid Fractions in this manner of working, and to find out the true and
exact Interest of any Sum of Money propounded, not only in Months but in days,
observe the following Directions.

Reduce your Interest, whether it be 6 l. 7 l. or 8 l. into Pence as you see.

I likewise convert the given numbers of Time into Days, and because the Year
does contain 365, and 6 Hours, it being better to allow more than less, I
therefore do reckon 366 Days.

Example 3.
Let it be required to know the Interest of 360 l. for 40 days, at 6 per Cent.
per. An. set down the given numbers as you see; then multiply the first and
second number together, viz. 100 and 366, the Product thereof is 36600, then
multiply the three ^ last numbers together, and their Product will be 20736000;
make the former number 36600 your Divisor, and 20736000 your Dividend; but
because both the Divisor and Dividend do contain each two Ciphers, cut off two
Ciphers from both Divisor and Dividend, then 366 will be your Divisor, and
207360 your Dividend, and the Quotient of such Division will give 566 Pence
204/366, which by Reduction does make 47 s. 2 d. 204/366, and so much is the
exact Interest of 360 Pounds for 40 days at 6 l. per Cent.

When the given Sum whose Interest you desire to know, does consist of several
Denominations, work according to the following directions.

Example 4.
I desire to know the Interest of 1236 l. 16 s. 8 d. for 12 Months or a whole
Year.

By the Rule of Three.

If 100 l. give 6 l. what will 1236 l. 16 s. 8 d. give.

Or thus, set down the given number whose Interest you do require 1236: 16: 8,
and multiply it by 6, as you see, setting down the Product of each Denomination
multiplied by 6, as you see.

^

Take away the two figures toward the right hand, or else make a separation
between them, and then it will be 74 l. and 21 hundred parts now to find out
the value of this 21 hundred parts, you must multiply it by 20, and by taking
two figures from the Product it makes, 4 Shillings 20 parts, multiply this 20
parts by 12, doing as before, you have 2 d. and 40 parts. Lastly multiply this
40 parts by 4, and your Product will be 1 Farthing, 60/100 parts of a Farthing.
So the exact Interest of 1236: 16: 8 for a Year is 74 l. 4 s. 2 d. 1 f. 60/100.

^

By this following Table you may with more expedition and ease find out the
true and exact interest of any Sum of money given, wherein take notice that the
Penny is divided into 100 parts, of which 25/100 is the value of 1 Farthing,
50/100 the value of of a half penny, and 75/100 the value of three farthings.

The Use of the former Table.
Let it be required to find the Interest of 975 l. for 12 Months or a Year.
First, I find the Interest of 900 l. for 12 Months to be 54 l. which I set
down, then I find the Interest of 70 l. for the same time to be 4 l. 4 s. which
I set under the 54 l. next I find the Interest of 5 l. for the like time to be
6 s. which I likewise set down, as you see.

l. l. s. The Interest of 900 for 12 mon. is 54 00 00 70 04 04 00 5 00 06 00 58
10 00

Add these several Sums together, and their total Sum will be 58 l. 10 s. which
is the exact Interest of 975 l. for 12 months at 6 l. par Cent. as was required.

Of Compound Interest.
Compound Interest is when Interest upon Interest is reckoned on any Sum of
Money.

Example.
Let it be required to know the Interest of 200 l. for 3 years, reckoning
Interest upon Interest, to effect which by the Rule of Three, observe these
following proportions.

As is to so is to 100 006 200 012 1. year. 100 006 212 024 2. year. 100 006
224: 14: 4: 3: 03 8: 47: 0: 2 3. ye.

As by the following Example does appear.

In this Operation I say at first, if 100 l. give 106 l. Interest and Principal
for one year, what shall 200 l? and by Multiplication I reduce 200 l. into the
lowest Denomination, which gives me 192000 farthings, I multiply these
farthings by my second Term 106, the Product is 20352000, and because I am to
divide by 100, I cut off the two Ciphers toward the right hand, which is all
one and the same, and there does remain 203520 farthings, which reduced ^ makes
212 l. for the Principal and Interest of 200l. the first year, the Proportion
now lies. If 100 l. give 106 l. what will 212 l. give? and by the foregoing
Operation I find 212 l. to contain 203520 Farthings, which I again multiply by
106, the Product thereof is 21573120, cutting off two figures as before, there
remains 215731 Farthings, which reduced make 224 l. 14s. 4 d. 3 f. the
Principal and Interest upon Interest of 200 Pound for two years. Lastly, I
multiply 215731 by 106, the the Product is 228674 (86, cutting off two figures
as before there remains 228674 Farthings, which reduced gives 238 l. 4 s. for
the Principal and Interest upon Interest of 200l. for three years. And in like
manner must you work if time be longer, so that if you multiply 228674
Farthings by 106, and from the Product thereof cut off two figures toward your
right hand, the Remainer gives you the number of farthings contained in the
Principle and Interest upon Interest of 200 l. for 4 years.

But because questions of Interest upon Interest require an Operation for each
year, I have therefore inserted the following Table.

A Table showing the Principal and Interest upon Interest for one Pound for any
Term under 31 Years.
Years. l. s. d. f. 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 5 2 3 1 3 9 3 4 1 5 3 0 5 1 6 9 0 6 1 8 4 2

3 14 2 5 2 2 15 2 7 11 1 16 2 10 9 2 17 2 13 10 1 18 2 17 1 0 19 3 0 6 0 20 3 4
1 3 21 3 7 11 3 22 3 12 0 2 23 3 16 4 1 24 4 0 11 1 25 4 5 9 1 26 4 10 11 0 27
4 16 4 1 28 5 2 1 2 29 5 8 3 0 30 5 14 8 3 31 6 1 7 1

The first Column of this Table is the Column of years from 1 to 31, and over
against each number of years does stand the Sum that 20 Shillings or one Pound
does come to at Interest upon Interest for the same time.

Suppose it were required to know by this Table the increase of 50 l. for 12
years at Interest upon Interest. Look in the Table over against 12 years and
you will find 2 l. 0 s. 3 d. which is the increase of 1 Pound for 12 years,
which multiplied by 50, as you see, viz.

l. s. d. 2 0 3 50 50 Times 3 d. is 12 6 50 Times 2 l. is 100 Total is 100 12 6

So that 100 l. 12 s. 6 d. is the increase of 50 l. for 12 years, allowing
Interest upon Interest.

Of Purchases and Annuties.
If you would purchase any Sum of Money to be paid you any number of years to
come, you must first know what it is worth in ready money, allowing Interest
upon Innerest. To effect this say, As 106l. is to 100 l. so 100 l. to the
present worth of 100 l. to be paid at 12 Months or a year. Then for the second
year say, as 106 l. is to 100 l. so is the present worth of one year to the
present worth for two years, and in like manner is the present worth of any Sum
of Money given found out for any number of years to come, as by the following
Example does more plainly appear.

Example.
Let it be required to know how much 50 l. to be paid at two years end is worth
in ready money, by the Rule of Three according to the preceding Instructions say,

^

Here you see 50 l. to be paid at one years end is worth in ready money 47 l.
169 parts, or 3 s. 4 d. Then for the second year make this last Sum found out
47: 169, your third number, saying,

^

By this last Operation the fourth number found out is 44: 499, by which you
see that 50 l. to be paid at the end and expiration of two years is worth no
more than 44 Pound 10 Shillings in ready money, and in like manner if you would
know the present worth of 50 l. at the end and ration of three years, make 44:
499 your third number; saying,

As 106 l. is to 100 l. so is 44: 499 to 41: 980.

But to avoid this trouble I have inserted the following Table showing the
present worth of one Pound in ready money, to be paid any number of years under
31, and if you know the present worth of one Pound, by Multiplication you may
know the present worth of any other Sum of Money.

Annexed to this Table is another Table, showing the true value of 1 l. Annuity
to continue 31 Years in ready money, whereby you may easily know the true value
of any Purchase to continue the same Term of years.

The Use of the foregoing Tables.
It is required to know the present value in ready Money of 36 l. Annuity or
Lease that is to continue 21 years.

By the former Table you find 1 l. Annuity or Lease to continue 21 years is
worth 11 l. 15 s. 3 d. 1 f. therefore the answer to your question must be 36
times 11 l. 15 s. 3 d. 1 f.

l. s. d. f. Therefore 11 15 3 1 Multiplied by 36 36 times 1 Farthing is 9 0 36
times 3 Pence is 9 0 0 36 times 15 Shillings is 27 0 0 0 36 times 11 Pounds is
396 0 0 0 Total Sum is 423 9 9 0

By Decimals thus, look for the Decimal value of one Pound Annuity or Lease for
21 Years, which you will by the same Table find to be 11: 76405, which multiply
by 36 Pound, the Product will be 423 Pound, 50580, which in value is ten
Shillings, being three Pence more than the other.

^

Therefore the Purchase of 36 Pound for 21 years is worth 423 l. 9 s. 9 d. as
was required.

CHAP. XXII.
Of Rebate or Discount.
REbate or Discount is when money is due at a certain time, as at 2, 3, 6 or 12
Months, and the person to whom the money is payable may sometimes have such
occasion for his money as to desire it before it be due; the person that is to
pay the money has no reason to pay his money before it be due, without some
consideration of Rebate or Discount for so much time at 6, 7 or 8 per Cent. as
they do agree.

Observe this as a general Rule, that upon Rebatements there must be no more
money paid down than would augment it self unto the whole Sum due, if it were
put forth to Interest for so much time as it is paid or received before hand.

Example 1.
Let it be required to know the Rebate of 250 l. for 12 Months at 6 per Cent.
Then by the Rule of Three say,

As 106 is to 100, so is 250 l. ^

l. s. d. Money to be laid down 235 16 11 Money rebated or discounted 14 03 00
Total 250

By which I gather that the Interest of 235: 16: 11: for 12 Months at 6 l. per
Cent. is 14: 3: 0:, which makes up the whole debt 250 Pound, as before.

Example 2.
I demand how much I must rebate or discount for 165 Pounds for 9 Months at 8
Pound per Cent. simple or bare Interest.

Say by the Rule of Three. ^

l. s. d. Total Sum due is 165 00 00 To be paid 155 13 02 At 8 l. per Cent. for
9 months is rebated 9 6 10

Example 3.
I demand the Discount or Rebate of 548 l. for 6 Months at 7 per Cent. simple
Interest.

Say by the Rule of Three. ^

^

Total Sum due is 548 Paid down 529 09 04 Rebated for 6 Months at 6 l. per
Cent. 18 10 08

Quest. Let it be required to know the Rebate of 500 l. for 9 mon. at 6 l. per
Cent.

Example. To resolve this Question, you must find out the Interest of 500 l.
for 9 Months, the Interest of 100 l. for 9 Months or three quarters of a year
is 4 l. 10 s. therefore the Interest of 500 l. for the same time must of
necessity be 22 l. 10 s. now I say if 522 l. 10 s. give 500 l. what will 500 l.
give.

^

Here you find the answer to the question last stated, by the Quotient which
does give you 114832 Pence, which is reduced as follows.

^

At last we have found that if 522 l. 10 s. give 500 l. then 500 l. will give
478 l. 9 s. 4 d. which subtracted from 500 l. gives 21 l. 10 s. 8 d. for the
Rebate of 500 l. for 9 Months at 6 l. per Cent.

This following Table will be of very great use for the ready casting up of the
Rebate of any Sum of Money for any time propounded.

The Explanation of the foregoing Tables.
Let it be required to find the Rebate of 348 l. for five Months at 6 l. per
Cent.

In the foregoing Table I look in the Column of five Months and in the same l.
l. s. d. 300 7 06 04 40 0 19 06 8 0 3 11 348 8 9 9 Column over against 300 l. I
find 7: 6: 4, and against 40 l. I find 19: 6, and against 8l. I find 3s. 11d.
which Sums I set down one under another, as in the Example; and by Addition I
find the Rebate of 348 l. to be 8 l. 9 s. 9 d. And in like manner you must do
for any greater or lesser Sum.

CHAP. XXIII.
Equation of Payments.
THIS Rule teaches how to bring the several Times appointed for the Payment of
a Sum of Money due unto one Time for payment of the whole Sum. As admit, a
Merchant does owe 900 l. to be paid at three several payments, viz. 300 l. at
three Months, 300 l. more at six Months, and 300 l, more at nine Months. But it
is concluded by the Debtor and Creditor to pay the Money all together at one
Time. It is required to know the Time the whole Sum ought to be paid in, that
neither Debtor nor Creditor may be losers.

The Rule.
Multiply each Payment by his own Time, add the several Products together, and
divide the Sum thereof by the whole Debt, the Quotient shows you the exact
Time for payment of the whole Sum.

300 multiplied by 3 Months is 900 300 multiplied by 6 Months is 1800 300
multiplied by 9 Months is 2700 5400

The several Products added together make 5400, which divided by 900 l. the
whole Debt, the Quotient gives 6 Months for the exact Payment of the whole Sum
at one Payment.

The Proof.
First find out what the Interest of the Money does come to, that should have
been paid before the time found out for payment of the whole Sum. Likewise find
out what the Interest of the Money comes to, that should have been paid after
the said time found out for payment of the whole Sum; and if the Interest of
the Money paid before be equal to the Interest of the Money paid after, then the
time found out is the exact time for payment of the whole Sum.

Example.
In the foregoing Example where 300 l. is to be paid at 3 Months, 300 l. more
at 6 Months, and 300 l. more at 9 Months, it is found out by the said Operation
that 6 Months is the exact time for payment of the whole Sum of 900 l. To prove
this, there was 300 l. to be paid at 3 Months, but is not paid unto 6 Months,
which is 3 Months longer, and the Interest of 300l. for 3 Months at 6 l. per
Cent. is 4 l. 10 s.

The 300 l. paid at 6 Months is the time equated or found out.

The other 300 l. to be paid at 9 Months is to be now paid at 6 Months, which
is 3 Months before his time of Payment, the Interest whereof for 3 Months is 4
l. 10 s. as before, therefore 6 Months is the exact time for payment of the
whole Sum of 900 l.

A Merchant owes 750 l. to be paid at 4 several payments; 200 l. at 4 Months;
250 l. more at 8 Months, 150 l. more to be paid at 10 Months, and 150 l. more
at 12 Months. I require to know what time the whole 750 l. ought to be paid in,
that neither Debtor nor Creditor may be losers?

l. l. 200 multiplied by 4 Months is 800 250 multiplied by 8 Months is 2000 150
multiplied by 10 Months is 1500 150 multiplied by 12 Months is 1800 6100

^

The several Sums of payment being multiplied by their respective time, the Sum
of their Products is 6100, which divided by 750, the Quotient gives eight
Months and 2/15 for the time of payment altogether.

There is owing to a Merchant 480 l. to be paid 120 l. ready money, 120 l. at
four Months, 120 l. more at eight Months, and 120 l. more at 12 Months. I
demand the exact time for payment of the whole Sum 480 l. so that neither
Debtor nor Creditor may have any advantage nor be damnified.

l. l. 120 multiplied by 0 Months is 000 120 multiplied by 4 Months is 480 120
multiplied by 8 Months is 960 120 multiplied by 12 Months is 1440 2880

^

The several Products added together make 2880, which divided by the whole Sum
480 l. the Quotient gives 6 Months, as was required.

CHAP. XXIV.
Of Tare, Tret and Cloff.
TAre, Tret and Cloff are allowances of Merchandise sold by weight.

Tare is the allowance for the weight of the Cask, Chest, Bag, etc. wherein any
Commodity is put.

Tret is an allowance of 4 pound weight, upon every subtle 100 pound weight;
that is to say, to allow 104 pound for every 100 pound.

Cloff is an allowance of 2 pound upon every draught that does exceed 336
pound, or 300 gross weight.

Quest. 1. If one subtle Hundred cost 3 pound, what shall 2704 pound cost?

By the Rule of Three say, If 104 l. cost 13 l. what shall 2704 l. cost?

^

By the Operation I find 2704 pounds weight to be worth 78 pound Sterling.

Quest. 2. If 100 l. be worth 13 s. 4 d. what will 2496 l. be worth, allowing 4
l. for every 100 for Tret?

Divide the given number 2496 by 26, because the 4 l. Tret is the 26. part of
104, and the Quotient will be 96, which is to be abated for the Tret out of
2496, and there will remain 2400 l. nett at 13 s. 4 d. per Hundred. Then by the
Rule of Three say, If 100 cost 13: 4, what will 2400 l. cost? the answer will
be 1600 l. the answer to the question, as was required.

CHAP. XXV.
The Rule of Barter.
BArter teaches how to sell Wares for Wares, or change one Merchandise for
another.

As for Example.
There are two Merchants, viz. A and B, A has 24 C. weight of Tobacco at 4 d.
per pound, and B has Sugar at 7 d. per pound. I demand how much Sugar must B
deliver to A for the Tobacco?

By the Rule of Three say, If 1 l. of Tobacco cost 4 d., what will 24 C. ^

^

By the foregoing Operation you find that 24 C. will cost 50 l. 8 s. Then say
again,

If 7d. buy 1 pound of Sugar, how many pound will 50l. 8s.

By multiplying and dividing you will find that 50 l. 8 s. will buy 1728 pound
of Sugar at 7d. per pound, therefore B must deliver 1728 pound of Sugar to A at
7 d. per pound for 24 C. of Tobacco at 4 d. as was required.

^

Two Merchants barter one with the other: A has 128 Yards of Broad Cloth at 9
s. 6 d. and B has Holland Cloth at 3 s. 4 d. per Ell. I demand how much
Holland Cloth B must deliver to A for his 128 Yards of Broad Cloth?

By the Rule of Three say, If 1 Yard of Broad Cloth cost 9: 6 what cost 128
Yards?

^

If 3 s. 4 d. buy one Ell of Holland Cloth, what will 60 l. 16 s. ^

Two Merchants barter, A has 432 Yards of Canvas at 14d. per Yard, B gives A
in barter for those 432 Yards of Canvas at 14 d. 24 pieces of Cloth. I desire
to know how much A gives for one piece of Cloth.

By the Rule of Three. If 1 yard cost 14 d. what will 432 yards? ^

If 24 pieces cost 25 l. 4 s. what cost 1? ^

Here I find by the Operation A gives 21 s. a piece for the 24 pieces of
Cloth, as was required.

Two Merchants, viz. A and B do barter one with another, A has Nutmegs at 5 s.
per pound to sell for ready money, but in barter he will sell for 6 s. per
pound, and B has Cinnamon at 4 s. 6 d. per pound, to sell for ready money. I
desire to know how much B must sell his Cinnamon a pound for in Barter that he
may not be a loser.

By the Rule of Three. If 5 s. give 6 s. what will 4 s. 6 d? Answer 5 s. 4 d..

Two Merchants, viz. A and B do barter one with another. A has Currants at 35
s. per Hundred, ready money, which he barters to B at 42 s. per Hundred: B has
Raisins of the Sun, which cost him 28 Shillings per Hundred, but he barters
them at 33 Shillings 3 Pence per Hundred, I desire to know how much in 100 l.
each man gains?

By the Rule of Three If 35 s. gain 7 s. what will 100 l. gain? Answer 20 l.

If 28 s. gain 33 s. 3 d. what will 100 l. gain? Answer 18 l. 15 s.

By multiplying and dividing you will find,

A gains 20 l. per Cent.

B gains 18 l. 15 s. per Cent.

CHAP. XXVI.
Of Loss and Gain.
THis Rule shows how to find out the Loss or Gains upon any parcel of Goods
sold, and it likewise shows how to find what price you must sell your Goods
for to gain so much per Cent.

Quest. 1. Suppose I buy broad Cloth at 7 s. 6 d. per Yard, and I sell the same
Cloth at 8 s. 9 d. per Yard, I desire to know how much is gained in 100 l.

First see whether there be Gain or Loss in one Yard, and how much it is.

s. d. Sold for per Yard 8 9 Given per Yard 7 6 Gained per Yard 1 3

By the Rule of Three say, If 7 s. 6 d. gain 1 s. 3 d. what will 100 l. gain?
Answer 16l. 13s. 4d. Multiply and divide, and you will find 16 l. 13 s. 4 d. is
gained per 100l. the answer to the question, as was required.

Quest. 2. If one Yard of Broad Cloth be worth 9s. 6d. for how much must 36
Yards be sold for to gain 20 per Cent.

By the Rule of Three say, If 100 l. give 120 l. what will 9 s. 6 d. give?
Answer 11 s. 4d. 8/10. Multiply and divide, and you will find 11s. 4d. 8/10.
Then by the same Rule again say,

If 1 Yard give 11: 4: 8/10, what will 36 Yards? 20: 10: 4: 8/8. Multiply and
divide, and you will find that you must sell 36 Yards of that Broad Cloth for
20: 10: 4: 8/10 to gain 20l. per Cent.

Quest. 3. If a piece of Broad Cloth containing 34 Yards cost 18 l. 14 s. and I
sell it for 10 s. 8 d. per Yard, I demand whether I gain or lose, and how much
per Cent.

By the Rule of Three say, If 1 Yard give 10 s. 8 d. what will 34 Yards? Answ.
18 l. 2 s. 8 d. which is less than the price it cost by 11 s. 4 d. therefore
you have lost, now to find how much you you have lost per Cent. say,

If 18 l. 14 s. lose 11 s. 4 d. what will 100 l. lose? 3 l. 0 s. 7 d..

By multiplying and dividing you will find you lose 3 l. 0s. 7d. in the 100 l.
the answer to the question, as was required.

Quest. 4. If one Yard of Broad Cloth cost me 13 s. 4 d. and I sell 24 Yards of
the same Cloth for 14l. 17 s. 6d. I desire to know whether I gain or lose, and
how much in the 100 l. of money.

By the Rule of Three say If 1 Yard cost 13 s. 4 d. what will 24 Yards? Answer
16 l. 0 s. 0 d.

By multiplying and dividing I find 24 Yards at 13 s. 4d. will cost 16 l. and I
sold the 24 Yards for 14 l. 17 s. 6d. So by Subtraction I find I have lost upon
the 24 Yards 1 l. 2 s. 6 d. Now to know how much per Cent. say,

If 16 l. lose 1 l. 2. s. 6 d. what will 100l? Answer 7 l. 0 s. 7 d..

By multiplying and dividing you will find you have lost 7l. 0s. 7d. per Cent.
the answer to the question as was required.

Quest. 5. If I give for 32 Yards of Cloth after the rate of 7 s. 6 d. and for
18 Yards 12 s. 6 d. and I sell one Yard with another for 10 s. per Yard. I
desire to know whether I gain or lose, and how much per Cent.

By the Rule of Three say, If 1 Yard cost 7 s. 6 d. what cost 32 Yards? Answer
12 0 0 If 1 Yard cost 12: 6, what cost 18 Yards? Answer 11 5 0 50 23 5 0

So I find the two pieces contain 50 Yards and cost me 23 l. 5 s. 0 d. but I
sell them round for 10 s. per Yard, and by the Rule of Three say,

If 1 Yard sell for 10 s. what will 50 Yards sell for? Answer 25 l.

By multiplying and dividing you will find it to amount unto 25 l. so that I
have gained 1 l. 15 s. Now to know how much per Cent. I have gained,

By the Rule of Three say, If 23 l. 5 s. gain 1 l. 15 s. what will 100 l. gain?
Answer 7 l. 10 s. 6 d..

Multiply and divide, and you will find you have gained 7: 10: 6: in 100 l.
which is the answer to the question, as was required.

Quest. 6. If I buy 100 of Oranges at 2 a Penny, and another at 3 a penny, and
sell them 5 for two pence, I require to know how much is lost or gained?

By the Rule of Three say, If 2 Or. cost 1 d. what cost 100, Ans. 4: 2 If 3 Or.
cost 1 d. what cost 100, Ans. 2: 9 5 200 6: 11

If 5 Oranges cost 2 d. what cost 200? Answer 80 d. or 6 s. 8 d.

So I find by multiplying and dividing the several Operations, that there is 3
d. of a penny lost, being the answer to the question, as was required.

CHAP. XXVII.
Allegation Medial.
Teaches how to find out a Common or Medium Rate or Price in a mixture of
several Rates and Prizes together, which must be performed by reducing the
several prices into one Denomination.

Multiply the particulars of the several mixtures by his respective price, and
divide their Sum by the whole quantity, the Quotient is the Medium or Common
Price required.

Quest. 1. A Cooper has Wine of several prices. Viz. 36 Gallons at 2 s. 40
Gallons at 2 s. 6 d. 60 Gallons at 3 s. and 120 Gallons at 3 s. 4 d. He intends
to put all these Wines together, but would know the common price.

In the following Work you have 36 Gallons multiplied by 24 pence, which is 2
s. the Product is 864 Pence. 40 Gallons by 30 Pence, or 2 s. 6 d. the Product
thereof is 1200 Pence. 60 Gallons by 36 Pence or 3 s. the Product thereof is
2160 Pence. And 120 Gallons by 40 pence or 3 s. 4 d. the Product thereof is
4800; the Sum of these several Products is 9024, which if you divide by 250
Gallons the Sum of the several quantities, the Quotient will be 36 d. 24/250 or
3 s. 0 d. 24/250, which is the Medium or common Price, as was required.

^

Quest. 2. A Mealman has 230 Bushels of Meal at 9 d. 368 Bushels at 14 d. and
485 Bushels at 16 d. He is intended to mix all these together, and desires to
know the common price.

^

The common price here found out is 13 d., as was required, and in like manner
for all other questions of this nature.

CHAP. XXVIII.
Alligation Alternate.
ALligation Alternate teaches how to mix diverse sorts and prices together, in
such manner that you may make them of what price or quantity you please.

Quest. 1. A Goldsmith has four sorts of Gold, the first sort is worth 36
Crowns the pound weight, the second sort is worth 38 Crowns the pound, the
third sort is worth 42 Crowns the pound, and the fourth sort is worth 45 Crowns
the pound: and with these it is required to make a mixture, worth 41 Crowns the
pound. I desire to know how much of each sort he must take.

First, set down the numbers of which the Alligation is to be made, one under
the other, viz. 36, 38, 42 and 45, in such order as you see in the following
Example, and the common price unto which you would reduce them, to the left
hand, which in this Example is 41, then observe which of the four numbers
before set down are greater than the common number 41, and which are less, and
with a Semicircle link a greater and a lesser number together, for two greater
or two smaller numbers than the common number may not be coupled together. ^

After these numbers are according to the former directions linked or coupled
together, next observe how much each of the lesser numbers differs from the
common number 41, and set that difference against his respective number to
which he is coupled; as here 36 differs 5 from the common number 41, which I
do not set down against 36 but against 45, the number to which he is coupled;
so likewise 38 does differ 3 from the common number 41, which I do not set
against 38 but against 42 the number to which he is coupled: likewise you must
observe how much each of the greater numbers does exceed the common number 41,
as 42 does exceed the common number 41 but 1, which I set against the number
38, to which he is coupled, and 45 does exceed the common number 41 but 4,
which I set against the number 36 to which he is coupled. The Sum of these
differences which is 13 shows the number of pounds the composition or mixture
must weigh, and the several differences do show how many pound of each sort you
must take. As 4 shows you must take 4 pound of 36 Crowns fine, 1 pound of 38
Crowns fine, 3 pound of 42 Crowns, and 5 pound of 45 Crowns fine; each pound of
this mixture containing 13 l. is worth 40 Crowns, as was desired.

The Proof.
Crowns. 4 l. of 36 Crowns fine is 144 1 l. of 38 38 3 l. of 42 126 5 l. of 45
225 533

So likewise 13 l. of 41 Crowns 533

But suppose it were required to make a mixture of a certain weight as well as
a certain fineness. As, let it be required to make a mixture of 8 pound weight
of the several former finenesses, and to the former common price of 41 Crowns,
how much must be taken of each sort?

Then by the Rule of Three say, As the Sum of the several differences which is
13 is to the weight propounded 8 pound, so is each particular difference to the
weight desired, as follows.

As 13 is to 8, so is 4 to 26/13. As 13 is to 8, so is 1 to 8/13. As 13 is to
8, so is 3 to 11/^^. As 13 is to 8, so is 5 to 3/^^. 8 l.

So there must be 2 l. 6/13 of the fineness of 36 Crowns, 8/13 parts of a pound
of 38 Crowns, 1 pound 11/13 of 42 Crowns, and 3 pound 1/13 of 45 Crowns, which
added all together make 8.

To prove the Work.
2 6/13 of 36 Crowns is 88 8/13 8/13 of 38 23 5/13 1 11/13 of 42 77 7/13 3 1/13
of 45 138 6/13 328

8 pound of 41 Crowns is 328

Therefore you may certainly conclude you have committed no error in your work.

Quest. 2. A Vintner has several sorts of Wine, viz. he has Wine of 14 d. the
Gallon, Wine of 19d. the Gallon, Wine of 23d. the Gallon, and he has Wine of
28d. the Gallon, now he does intend to make a mixture of 48 Gallons; now it is
required to know how many Gallons of each price he must take to make one Gallon
with another worth 21 d.

d. Gal. s. d. 21 14 2 at 14 2 4 19 7 at 19 11 1 23 7 at 23 13 5 28 2 at 28 4 8
18 at 21 1: 11 6

Say by the Rule of Three, As 18 to 48, so 2 to 5 Gallons 6/18 As 18 to 48, so
7 to 18 Gallons 1/18 As 18 to 48, so 7 to 18 Gallons 12/18 As 18 to 48, so 2 to
5 Gallons 6/18 48

The Proof is as follows.
d. 5 Gallons 6/18 of 14 Pence is 74 ^^/18 18 Gallons 12/18 of 19 354 12/18 18
Gallons 12/18 of 23 429 6/18 5 Gallons 6/18 of 28 149 6/18 1008 d.

48 Gallons of 21 Pence is 1008 d.

Therefore you may conclude your Operation is without error.

Quest. 3. A Drugster has three sorts of Druggs, the first sort at 3 s. the
pound, the second at 7 s. and the third at 15 s. per pound. Of these sorts he
is to make 3 parcels containing each 24 pound, one parcel to be reckoned 11 s.
per pound, the other 12s. and the other 13s. how much must be taken of each
sort to make up each parcel?

^

The common prices propounded are 11 Shillings, 12 Shillings, and 13 Shillings;
likewise the prices given of which the mixture is to be made are 3 Shillings, 7
Shillings and 15 Shillings, and because two of the three given prices are less
than the common price, I couple the two lesser with the greater as you see, and
the differences of the 2 lesser I place against the greater, and the
differences of the greater against the lesser; then proceed as before, saying,

As 20 the whole difference is to 24 the whole quantity of each parcel, so is
each particular difference to its respective quantity enquired after, as
follows.

1. As 20 to 24, so 4 to 4 As 20 to 24, so 4 to 4 As 20 to 24, so 12 to 14 24

2. As 20 to 24, so 3 to 3 As 20 to 24, so 3 to 3 As 20 to 24, so 14 to 16 24

3. As 20 to 24, so 2 to 2 As 20 to 24, so 2 to 2 As 20 to 24, so 16 to 19 24

Here you see in the first parcel that is to be 11 s. per pound, to make a
mixture of 24 l. you must take 4 pound of 3 s. per pound, 4 l. of 7 s. per
pound, and 14 l. of 15 s. per pound; and in the second parcel of 12 s. the
common price round, you must take 3 l. of 3 s. per pound, 3 l. of 7 s. per
pound, and 16 l. of 15 s. per pound; and in the third parcel of 13 s. round,
you must take 2 l. of 3 s. and 2 l. of 7 s. and 19 l. of 15 s. per pound, and
if you add up each parcel found out they will each amount unto 24 l.

Quest. 4. A Goldsmith has five sorts of Gold, one is 15 carrects fine, 17
carrects fine, 20 carrects fine, 23 carrects fine, and 26 carrects fine. All
these five sorts he does intend to mix with such an allay, as that a mixture of
124 ounces should be but 12 carrects fine, I desire to know how much of either
sort of Gold must be taken to make up 124 l.

To answer this and all other questions of this nature, set down their several
and particular finenesses one under another, as you see in the following
Example, and set down the common fineness of the Gold which is demanded, viz.
12 carrects toward the left hand, also set down a Cipher under the particulars
for an alloy, set the alloys difference, which is 12, against all the other
Sums, as in the Example you may see is done, and set the difference of all the
other Sums against the alloy, as 3, 5, 8, 11 and 14. Then by the Rule of Three
say, As 101 the whole difference is to 124 the whole quantity, so is each
particular difference to each particular quantity sought. ^

oz. As 101 to 124, so 12 to 14 74/101 As 101 to 124, so 12 to 14 74/101 As 101
to 124, so 12 to 14 74/101 As 101 to 124, so 12 to 14 74/101 As 101 to 124, so
12 to 14 74/101 As 101 to 124, so 41 to 50 34/101 124

CHAP. XXIX.
Of Exchange.
EXchange is the way of remitting money from one place or Country to another, by
paying money in one place, and receiving the like value in another, with
allowance sometimes of profit and sometimes of loss.

It will be of little or no consequence to give you the names of the particular
Coyns of several Countries, because with us in England they sometimes rise and
sometimes fall in value, according as the Exchange runs, I therefore do only
intend to lay down some necessary questions as follow.

Quest. 1. A Merchant pays at London, or any other Sea Port Town of England
256 l. Sterling, to receive the value thereof at Amsterdam Exchange at 33 s. 9
d. Flemish, for 20 s. Sterling I desire to know how much Flemish money I must
receive at Amsterdam.

By the Rule of Three say, If 1 l. Sterling. give 33 s. 9 d. Fl. what will 256 l? ^

Quest. 2. A Merchant at Amsterdam does deliver 432 l. Flemish, to receive the
value thereof at London Exchange, 33 s. 9 d. for 20 s. Sterling, I desire to
know how much Sterling money I must receive at London?

By the Rule of Three say, If 33 s. 9 d. Fl. give 1 l. Ster. what will 432 l.
Fl. ^

Multiply and divide and you will find he must receive 256 l. Sterling. These
two questions do prove one another, as you may plainly see.

Quest. 3. A Merchant at London delivers 374 l. 2 s. Sterling to be received in
Paris, the like value Exchange at 58d. per French Crown. I demand how many
French Crowns must I receive in Paris?

By the Rule of Three say, If 58 d. give 1 Fr. Cr. what will 374 l. 2 s? ^

By multiplying and dividing you will find you must receive at Paris 1548
French Crowns.

Quest. 4. A Merchant at Paris does deliver 2870 French Crowns, the like value
to be received in London, Exchange at 57d. per Crown. I desire to know how much
Sterling money I must receive at London?

By the Rule of Three say, If 1 Fr. Cr. give 57 d. how much will 2870 ^

Quest. 5. A Merchant at London does deliver for Franckford 140 l. Sterling.
Exchange for Frankford at 46d. Sterling. the Florin of 66 Kreutrars. The Question
is how many Florins must he receive at 60 Kreutrars at Frankford?

By the Rule of Three say. If 46 d. give me 66 Kreutr. what will 140 l? ^

Quest. 6. An Merchant in Antwerp takes up money by Exchange, at the rate of 33
s. 4 d. Flemish, to pay at London 20 s. Sterling. but when the Bill of Exchange
came due, he was forced to take up money in London to pay the said Bill, to pay
at Antwerp for every 20s. Sterling 33 s. 10 d. Flemish. I desire to know
whether I do win or lose, and how much in the 100 l. of money?

By the Rule of Three say. If 33s. 10d. give 33s. 4d. what will 100l? Answer 98
l. 10s. 5d. which subtract from 100l. gives 1l. 9s. 7d. for the remainer, and
so much is lost in 100 l. of money.

Quest. 7. A Merchant at Cales does receive a Bill of Exchange from London for
1500 Ducats which is the value of 365 l. 12 s. 6 d. Sterling delivered at
London. I desire to know what the Ducket is worth?

If 1500 Ducats cost 365l. 12s. 6d. what cost 1 Ducket? Answer 4 l. 10 s..

The Exchange between London and France is much different from the Flemish
Exchange, because in France it is delivered in French Crowns, which is worth 50
Sous Tournois the piece.

For in France they do account by Deniers Tournois, accounting 12 Deniers 1
Sous Tournois, and 20 Sous Tournois 1 Livre or Frank, which is also 1 Pound
Tournois; the French Crown in Commerce is current for 51 Sous Tournois, but in
Exchange it will pass for no more than 50 Sous Tournois, which is 2 l. 10 Sous
Tournois the Crown.

Quest. 8. A Merchant in London does deliver 360 l. 2 s. 4 d. Sterling Exchange
at 5 s. 8 d. the French Crown, and to receive at Paris 50 Sous Tournois for
every French Crown. I desire to know how many Livres I shall receive at Paris
for the 360 Pound paid in London?

By the Rule of Three say, If 5 s. 8 d. give 2 Livres 10 Sous, what will 360 l.
give? Multiply and divide and you will find 3177 Livres 10 Sous Tournois, and
so much must I receive in Paris for my 360 Pound.

Quest. 9. A Merchant at Paris does deliver by Exchange 3784 Livres Tournois,
at 50 Sous Tournois the French Crown, and for each French Crown to receive here
5 s. 7 d. Sterling in London. I desire to know how much Sterling money I shall
receive for my 3784 Livres or Pounds Tournois?

By the Rule of Three say, If 2l. 10 Sous Tournois give 5s. 7d. what will 3784?
Or, If 5 l. Tournois give 10s. 2 d. Sterling, what will 3784?

Multiply and divide either of these proportions, and you will find the fourth
proportional to be 422l. 10s. 11d. and so much you must receive at London for
your 3784 Livres paid or delivered in Exchange at the rate before mentioned.

CHAP. XXX.
Of Gauging.
IF you would know how many Gallons any Vessel contains in Wine or Ale measure,
you must first take the Diameter of the head of the said Vessel in Inches, then
the Diameter at the Bung withinside in Inches, then in the respective following
Table look for the Diameter of the Bung in Inches before taken, which you will
find in the respective Table in the Column entitled Inches, and the number
that you find stand against it set down twice, then in the same Columns
entitled Inches look for the Diameter of the head Inches, and the number
standing against it set down once under the number twice set down, and add them
all together, multiply their Sum by the length of the Vessel in Inches, from
the Product cut off 3 figures toward the right hand, and those remaining
figures toward the left hand are the number of Gallons required, and the 3
figures cut off are parts of a Gallon either of Ale or Wine measure, according
to the Table from whence you take your numbers.

Example 1.
There is a Cask or Vessel whose Diameter at the Bung is 26 Inches, the
Diameter at the head is 17 Inches, and the length of the said Vessel is 41
Inches. I desire to know how many Gallons of Wine he does contain? In the Wine
Table over against 26 Inches the Diameter at the Bung, I find the number 0:
766, which according to instructions I set down twice; likewise against the
number 17 I find 328, which I set down: the Sum of all these three is 1: 860,
which multiplied by 41 the length, the Product is 76: 260, from whence I cut
off the three figures toward the right hand, and there will remain 76, which
shows the Vessel does contain 76 Gallons 260/1000.

Diameter at Bung 26 0 766 The same 0 766 Diameter at Head 17 0 328 1 860 41 1
860 74 40 Content in Gallons 76 260/1000

Example 2.
There is a Cask or Vessel whose Diameter at Bung is 22 Inches, his Diameter at
Head 16 Inches, and his Length 36 Inches. I do desire to know how many Gallons
of Ale measure it does contain? out of the respective Table for Ale measure I
find the Diameter at the Bung 22 Inches, and against it this number 450, which
I set down twice, I also find out the Diameter at head 16 Inches in the same
Table, and against it I find the number 238, which I set down as you see. Add
all these together and their Sum will be 1138, which multiply by 36, the length
of the Cask or Vessel, the Product will be 40: 968, and cutting off three
figures toward the right hand, there remains 40, which shows the Cask does
contain of Ale measure 40 Gallons 968/1000.

CHAP. XXXI.
The Extraction of the Square Root.
IT is necessary to insert the Table of the Squares of all the nine Digits, as
follows.

Roots. Squares. 1 1 2 4 3 9 4 16 5 25 6 36 7 49 8 64 9 81

Example.
It is required to extract the square Root of 22429696, set a mark or prick
with your Pen, under the first figure toward your right hand, and so under
every second figure as you see, so will your given number be divided into four
parts or points, whereby you must note that the Root will admit of four
figures, for the square Root of the given number does always admit of as many
figures as the given number does admit Points. Then proceed to the Extraction
thus, beginning at the left hand the first Point being 22, by the former Table
of Squares, I find 16 to be the greatest Square number contained therein, whose
Square Root is 4, therefore I set down 4 in the Quotient, and the Square
thereof 16 I set underneath 22, and I subtract one from the other and there
remains 6, which I set underneath; to this remainer 6 I draw down the next
Point 42, which does make the number 642; next I double the Quotient 4 which is
8, which I set down one figure short of the right hand as you see; then do I
seek how many times 8 will go in 64, which is 7 times, set down 7 under that
vacant figure toward your right hand 2, and likewise set down 7 in the
Quotient, and multiply 87 by 7, whose Product 609 set under the line, and
subtract it from the number made of the last remainer, and the Point last
brought down 642, and the remainer of this subtraction will be 33, to which
remainer draw down the next point 96, and it makes the number 3396; next double
the Quotient 47, it makes 94, which set under the number 3396, that it may
stand one figure short toward the right hand, as you see in the following
Example; then ask how many times 94 is contained in the number or figures
standing over them 339? answer is three times, therefore I set down 3 to the
right hand of 94, also I set down 3 in the Quotient, then do I multiply 943 by
3 the last figure in the Quotient, and the Product of the multiplication 2829 I
set underneath the line, and subtract it from the number made of the last
remainer, and the point last brought down which is 3396, and of this
subtraction there does remain 567; lastly to this remainer I draw down the next
point 96, and it makes the number 56796, now double the Quotient 473, which
makes 946, and set it under the number 56796, that it stand one figure short
toward your right hand as you see, and ask how many times 946 is contained in
the figures standing over him 5679? answer is 6 times, setting down 6 to the
right hand of 946, and also in the Quotient, and multiply 9466 by 6 the last
figure set in the Quotient, and the Product of such multiplication I set down
under the line being 56796, which I subtract from the number composed of the
last remainer, and last point brought down which is 56796, and there will
remain 0, and having no more points to draw down, I therefore conclude I have
finished my Extraction, wherefore the square Root of the given number 22429696
is 4736, as was required, as by the following Example does appear.

^

The Proof of the Extraction of the Square Root, is done by multiplying the
Root found in it self, and the Product is the number given whose Square Root is
required.

Example.
Let it be required to prove this Example where the Root found is 4736;
therefore I multiply 4736 by it self, that is to say, by 4736, and the Product
is 22429696 the number given.

Let it be required to extract the Cube Root of the given number 42144192.
First point the given number as you see, setting a prick under the first figure
toward your right hand, and so under every third figure as you see, every
prick except the last toward the left hand containing three figures, and that
contains the two figures 42: therefore in the foregoing Table, find out the
greatest Cube number in 42, which I find to be 27, whose Cube Root is 3, which
place in the Quotient, and subtract the Cube number 27 from 42, and there will
remain 15, which place under neath; to this remainer bring down the next point
144, so have you the number 15144, which call your Resolv. draw a line under;
square the Quotient 3 which is 9, multiply the said Spuare 9 by 300, and the
Product thereof 2700, place under the Resolvend, and call it the Treble Square.
Again, multiply the Quotient 3 by 30, which makes 90, place 90 under the Treble
Square, and call it the Treble Quotient, add the Treble Square and Treble
Quotient together into one Sum, and it makes 2790, which call your Divisor,
then examine how often you can take your Divisor in your Resolvend, which is
four times, set 4 in the Quotient, then multiply the Treble Square 2700 by the
4 last placed in the Quotient, and subscribe the Product underneath your
Divisor, square the last said figure in the Quotient 4, which is 16, thereby
multiply the Treble Quotient 90, and the Product thereof 1440 place under the
last Product 10800, cube the figure 4 last placed in the Quotient, which by the
foregoing Table is 64, and place it under the preceding Products, then add
these three Products into one Sum, and subtract the Sum thereof 12304 from your
Resolv. and there will remain 2840, to this remainder draw down the next point
192, and the number 2840192 is a new Resolvend, under which draw a line, then
square the Quotient 34 which is 1156, which Square multiply by 300, and the
Product 346800 set under the Resolvend, and call it the Treble Square as
before; then multiply the Quotient 34 by 30, and the Product thereof 1020, set
under the Treble Square, and call it the Treble Quotient, and the Sum of the
Treble Square and Treble Quotient is 347820, which call your Divisor, and
examine how often you can take your last Divisor in your last Resolvend, which
will be 8 times, therefore set 8 in the Quotient, multiply your last Treble
Square by the last figure in your Quotient 8, the Product thereof 2774400
subscribe under your last Divisor, square the last figure in your Quotient 8,
which is 64, by which multiply the last Treble Quotient, the Product 65280 set
under the last Product, then cube the last figure of your Quotient 8, which by
the foregoing Table you will find to be 512, which place under the preceding
Products, and add all these three Products into one Sum, which makes 2840192,
which if you subtract from your last Resolvend there will remain 0, and in such
manner must you proceed by reiterating the work by squaring the Quotient, until
all the figures are brought down.

But in this Example the work is finished, for there is no more figure to draw
down, and 0 remains; so the Cube Root of 42144192 is 348, as was required.

^

To prove the Extraction of the Cube Root.
Multiply the Cube Root found by it self, then multiply the Product of the
multiplication by the Root found, and the Product of this second multiplication
is the given number whose Cube Root is required.

Example.
^

It is required to prove this Example of the Extraction of the Cube Root,
wherein the Cube Root found is 348, which multiply by 348, and the Product of
the multiplication will be 121104, which multiplied again by 348 the Root found
produces the given number to be extracted 42144192, whereby it is concluded
the Operation is right.
