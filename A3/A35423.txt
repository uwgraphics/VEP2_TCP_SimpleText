THE DECLARATION Of the Right Honorable, Henry Earl of Cumberland, etc.
FRom the deep sense of the growing miseries which have formerly afflicted this
distressed coontry, and out of the grievous apprehension of those inevitable
ruins, and desolations, with a real War fomented, hatched, and brought forth
by our continual distractions, must infallibly bring upon us; We thought it
the least of our duty to our God, our King, and our country, to endeavor all
means possible to discharge our selves before God and Man, and to leave nothing
unattempted which might avert and prevent those fearful calamities which as it
must be consequently the most bloody and ruineous) was of all others; and
therefore in pursuance of that due affection to our Native Country; We first
prevailed with our most gracious Sovereigne, whose Royal Inclination met our
humble desires, in the most ready ways, and apparent means which we could
devise and find out for the p^ace and safety thereof, and set aside all other
respects, though never so much conducing to the main of His own affairs, for
our security; and therefore carried a way the fatal Cloud of War, which in a
hideous form hung over our heads, to disburden it self in another Clymate, so
as we conceived, we had no further work of labor, but to pay the duties of
praise and thankfulness to our God and King* whose grace and goodness had
freed us from the visible consequences of a great and terrible tempest, but
since it has pleas^d the unsearchable Wisdom of Almighty God so to order it,
That another storm has broken and powered a great part of it upon this Country
(when we least feared, and by those means which we least suspected) and that
contrary to all expectation work our misery) there appeared those out of our
own Bowels, which have begun a War and kindled a flame, which ^oth hazard the
ruin and destruction of their Native Country; which we take as a Punishment
due to our manifold sins and offennes, and leave the particular executioners
thereof, to His own wisdom and Justice hereafter, yet we have not been a
wanting to the safety and protection of this People (so long, and in so many
ways afflicted, but have appolyed our selves to all such ways and means,
which in Humane reason we could hope might procure a timely remedy to those
bleeding wounds. And therefore in a Treaty at Rodwell, with some Gentlemen of
this County, of whose affection to peace and Unity (though differing in Opinion
from us) we were most confident: Sundry Articles were a greed and Concluded
upon, all wholly tending to those ends, and conducing to real settlement,
which was sought after by us with so much candor plain dealing, and
earnestness, that we willingly let pass the manifest advantages which we then
had over the opposers of the settled Peace of this County, and judging the
affections of others by our own desires and inclinations, declined and quitted
all other considerations, but such as might parchase a good correspondence and
amity with those Gentlemen and others, whom at that time it lay in our Power to
have forced or destroyed; and that nothing might be awanting to oblige them,
set at Liberty sundry Prisoners, some of good quality, upon their word and
Faith, to return them again if the Treaty were not preformed; and
condescended to all the World knows That we aimed at the Public safety and
assurance: Yet not withstanding all this, without the least breach on our
behalf, particular passions and interests has so far prevailed, That as,
soon as they were freed of the danger wherein they were then engaged, contrary
to their Hands, Faith and protestations, they have wholly broken that Agreement
so solemnly concluded, and without rendering the least reason (which indeed is
impossible and of which they can never excuse themselves) have with indirect
intentions; and by a specious of^er of Peace (which it seems was the least of
their thoughts) strengthened, and prepraed themselves for War, by pretense of
safety to the County, disveloped themselves from danger, and procured security
to their own persons, and by a seeming desire to stop the deluge of War (began
by them alone) opened a breach to all the miseries and calamities which must
now most invitable overwhelm this distressed Country; whereby before the utmost
extrimity has appeared, we have already suffered what can befall any people
(setting aside, firing Towns and Villages) by the Hand of a cruel and
Foreign enemy; Strangers brought in to oppress us, our houses plundered,
goods destroyed and taken away, our households disperced, Wives and children
banished, the persons of diverse of us seized, and Imprisoned, our lives
endangered, and sought after, by Sword or Famine; (and what is beyond all
belief) those who are unquestionably innocent, and in no capacity to be
involved in our pretended offenses (if we be guilty of any) our Children (even
those whose Infant years admit no color of objection) our Servants (employed
only in domestic, commands) sought after* and endangered in the same measure
and degree of cruelty, violence, and oppression. And that no aggravation may be
a wanting to increase our sufferings, all those exorbitances executed under the
glorious pretenses of safety of Religion and preservation of State, and done by
Authority and command of Parliament (which we acknowledge and b^leive to be the
Guard^an of Public liberty) and who we are confident being chosen by us for
assertors of our Freedoms, will not enthrale us; being trusted with the
property of our goods, will not take them from us; being selected for the
preservation of our Laws, will not violate or infringe them; and that in so
high a measure, as more could not be perpetrated, if we were conquered and
subdued by the most barbarous and violent Enemy. We have heard and do believe,
That both the Houses have commanded the Militia to be settled and that they
think it necessary, for some reasons (best known to themselves) that the power
which until this time, has bin unquestionably in the Kings of this land,
should now be settled in themselves yet these admitted, we cannot be persuaded,
That it is the intention or meaning of the Parliament, that all who are not
convinvinced of the necessity, or who cannot dispense with their Oaths, which
ties them to the known Laws of the Land till they be repealed, and to obey
His Majesty's command in those things wherein it appears He has manifest
Right, until He has given a way and parted with that Right by His own assent,
or who are yet Newters, and conscionably, expect a legal Rule whereby to be
directed, should presently with out due process of Law, be divested from all
property of Goods, Liberty of persons, Lives and Fortunes, and be in a worse
condition for not performing what is it no Law, then any Man can be for
offending and disobeyng all the Laws which were ever yet established: and much
less, that the friends and servants, the faulty and guiltless, those whose
condition or inability free them from assisting in, or, exercising any Militia,
Clergymen, Babes, Old Men, women, should be included and wrapped up in one
common fate and destruction, contrary to the rules of God and nature; which
make a large differene between the innocent, and the offender, and the customs
and Laws of this Realm, which give freedom to diverse in those cases and have
so long maintained this Kingdom in peace, by distributing rewards and
punishments (not to all a like) but to the conscionably obedient, or wilful
contemners thereof. These distructive courses of violence, pretending
necessity, were ever opposed when they were executed by Regal power, deferred
and protested against by his Sacred Majesty, altogether condemned by former,
and this present Parliament, and not to be done or consented to by any, without
disobedience to His Majesty, offense to the Parliament, and injury to the
Freedom and Liberty if this people and Kingdom. But we are far from
believing these to be the command and Acts of an English Parliament, which our
selves have so earnestly desired, so faithfully supported; but rather of some
persons, who (being now) contrary to their hopes, armed with power to gain the
affections of their Soldiers for farther ends and designs, and to make their
particular profit by the general spoil, give way to this licentiousness, and
suffer them to ransom persons and destroy the goods of the innocent people,
and to make havocke and spole of all which comes in their way, letting loose
the Raines of government, and giving way to all manner of rapine (though the
gain on the (...) does in no measure countervaile the loss on the other) to
the unspeakeable detriment and damage of this our flourishing, now miserable
Country. By which courses it has been already endammaged (as we offer to make
good) to the value of 100000 pound, besides the sufferance of many such
barbarous outrages, scarce credible to be committed by Christians; and those so
frequent, that if possible, they can be denied; and that the Houses will admit
the proof, we shall make them appear in such numbers, and so abominable,
will exceed the belief of any, unless they see them sufficiently witnessed
and attested. Out of our desire of peace, we have already endured beyond
mortal sufferance, and are ready to suffer still in our own particulars; and
to set apart all Interests of our own, and to expose our selves to the height
of violence and rigor though undeserved (unless to obey our King according to
His Laws be an offense) before we will hazard the peace of this County, and
this people, for any regard or respect whatsoever. And therefore because as our
Adversaries do speciously pretend, That their Arms are raised only for seizing
upon Delinquents, and bringing them to condign punishments, or driving them
out of the Country (which is their bait to catch the multitude.) We do
unanimously profess and declare (although we are confident, and that their
practices show that whosoever has money or Plate, or Movables, is a
Delinquent, and must part with them ere he be guiltles*) to take away all
scruples, if they will set down and express the names of the delinquents (if
any be amongst us) and their offenses, upon assurance that no other end is
sought by their Arms; and that once obtained, they will absolutely lay them
down, and free the country: it shall be manifested, That we will not decline
any just and legal trial, or desire that a war should be continued, or the
people disturbed for the safeguard of them, or any of them: although we are
most assured, that when by the term of Delinquency, they have quit their
hands of such, who are most likely to oppose the ruinous proceedings, that
others whose wealth, estates, or former actions unpleasing to these men, have
made them obnoxious, shall succeed in the same misery; and very many, who
suppose themselves in a good condition of grace and favor with them, shall
fall into the like misfortune, as soon as the Lion sees fit time to discover
his hidden Claws; it being impossible they should be in a better estate of
Innocence, then our selves, who have not at all wilfully offended, or opposed
any of the known Laws of this Kingdom. We have had woeful and sad experience,
that the more our Adversaries are sought unto for peace, the farther they are
estranged from it; and that all lenitive applications, do but exasperate our
disease. We do protest before God and man, That we will yet apply our selves
to all means which may conduce to quiet, and settlement; but in the mean time
will really and effectually labor for the safety of this Country, our selves,
our wives, and children; and if for the preservation of all, that ought to be
defended, and maintained by Mortal Man: we are necessitated and compelled by
their example to call in Forces, and desire the Assistance of the Earl of
Newcastle, and of our friends and Neighbors in the adjacent Counties (being of
our own nation, and whose turn is next, and cause the same with ours, and that
thereby some unforeseene or unwished accident arise, not then to be remedied,
and that Yorkshire become an Akeldama and field of blood, we lay the
consequences and effects thereof at the doors, and upon the heads of those men
who first begun, and kindled the flame i^ this County, and have hitherto
refused our most brotherly and peaceable offers, and endeavoring for unity and
tranquillity, which on our parts has bin so earnestly sought after, and
attempted; that we can justly now say, we have freed our own souls,
discharged the duty of Christians, Englishmen, Patriates, and have bin refused
in all: so as there remains no more, but to defend our Country from Strangers,
our lives from violence, our Wives and children from extremity of injury, our
Houses from Rapine, our goods from spoil, our Laws, liberties, property, and
whatsoever is or can be near or dear unto us, from utmost hazard and
destruction. In execution or which resolution, there is no course or means
omitted, which may (as far as is possible) conduce to the benefit and
preservation of the people. The Earl of Newcastle required assurance before he
would march to our assistance, that the Country should be paid the billet of
his Soldiers, which was before thought upon, and resolved by us, and caution
is accordingly given; so that no man will receive loss or damage by those
forces, as far as it is in our power to provide or foresee. And because they
have hitherto built up themselves upon false reports and foundations, and
disguise and make the truth according as it may best fit their ends, and serve
their purposes; and thereby not only persuade the people with deceitful
rumors of his Majesty's unfortunate proceedings (when in truth God has
wonderfully blessed him with most fortunate success) but also casting false
lights before their eyes, lay scandalous aspersions upon our actions and real
intendments, for the benefit of this County, striving to possess them with a
prejudicacy of whatsoever we go about to do; and accordingly are now seeking to
poison the minds of the people with a false opinion, and causeless jealousy,
That the Army now coming to our assistance, is assigned for the oppression,
not deliverance; the destruction, not safeguard of the Country; and will be the
ruin of it wheresoever they pass. To stop the poisonous mouths of malice it
self, the Earl of New Castle has declared his honorable Intentions, to
leave the Country in peace, as soon as he has delivered it from these enemies
of His Majesty, who now oppress and tyrannise over it. In which endeavor we
doubt not, to find the real concurrence of all who have interest in this
County, and that they will not be behind their Neighbors and Allies in seeking
their own preservations, being all owners of one common cause, and must (what
ever pretenses be made) in the end, run the same course of violence and
disolation. How ever, though we perish in this work, we shall rest satisfied,
that we have preserved our Faith and Honor untainted: and if all other disert
us in this resolution, we will not fail our selves, nor our duty to our King
and Country* wherein appears so much Justice and Piety: but are most confident
by Gods blessing upon the performance of our just endeavors, to repress the
enemies of His Majesty's peace, and to conserve our selves and this Country, to
the Glory of God, the service of our King, and mutual comfort of one another.

FINIS.
