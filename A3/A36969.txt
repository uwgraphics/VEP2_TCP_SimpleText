The Country Farmer,
A Song set by Mr. Jeremiah Clark.
^Hark the Cock crow'd* it is Day all a broad, and looks like a Jolly fair
Morning; Up ^^Roger* and James, and drive out your Teams; up quickly to carry
the Corn in. ^^Davy the drowzy, and Barnaby Bowzy, at Breakfast weell flout and
weell Ieer Boys. ^^Slugards shall Chatter, with small drink and water, whil^t
you shall tope off the March Beer Boys.^

2
Lasses that Snore, for Shame give it over
Mouth open* the Flies will be blowing.
To get us stout Hum, when Christmas is come,
Away where the Barley is Mowing.
In your Smock sleeves too* go bind up ye sheaves too.
With nimble young Rowland and Harry;
Then when Works over, at Night give each, Lover,
A Hug and a Buss in the Dairy.
3
Two for ye Mow, and two for ye Plough,
Is then the next* Labor coms after.
I Am sure I hired four but if you want more,
I Will send you my Wife and my Daughter.
Roger ye trusty, tell Rachel ye lusty,
The Barn's a rare place to Steal Garters;
Twixt her and you then con^trive up ye Mow then*
And take it at night for your Quarters.
For ye Flute
^^^
