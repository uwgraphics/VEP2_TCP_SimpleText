Pharonnida: A HEROIC POEM.

BY WILLIAM CHAMBERLAYNE Of Shaftsbury in the County of Dorcet.

(...). Hom. Odyss. Lib. XIX. LONDON, Printed for Robert Clavell, at the Sign
of the Stags-head near St. Gregory's Church in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1659.

TO The right Worshipful, SIR WILLIAM PORTMAN, BARONET.
Honored Sir,
THough by that Splendour with which the bountiful hand of Fortune, illustrated
by the more excellent Gifts of Nature, has Adorned you, to the illumina^ting
the Hopes of all your expecting Friends: I might justly fear these Glowworms of
Fancy may be out-shone, to the obscurity of a contemptible Neglect; You being
like, ere long, to prove that glorious Luminarie, to whose ascending Brightness
the happiest Wits that grace the British Hemisphear, like Persian Priests,
prostrated to the rising Sun, will devote the Morning Sa^^^fices of their
Muses: Yet Animated by your late Candid Reception of my more Youthful Labors,
whose humble flights having your Name to beautify their Front, past the
public View unsullied, by the cloudy Aspect of the most Critic Spectator: I
have once more assumed the boldness to let the Infirmities of my Fancy take
Sanctuary under the Name of so honored a Patron. Though my Abilities could not
Cloth Her in such Robes, as would render Her a fit Companion for your serious
Studies, yet I hope her Dress is not so sordid, but she may prove an acceptable
Attendant on your more vacant Hours. For my Subject (it being Heroic Poesy)
it is such as the wiser part of the World has always held in a Venerable
Esteem, the Extracts of Fancy being that noble Elixer, which Heaven ordained to
Immortalize their Memories, whose worthy Actions being the Products of that
nobler part of Man, the Soul, is by this made, almost Commensurate with Her
Eternity; which otherwise (to the sorrow of succeeding Ages) who are in debt
for much of their Virtue to a noble Emulation of their glorious Ancestors, had
either terminated in a Circle of no larger a Diameter then Life; or like short
breathed Ephemera's, only survived a while in the Aerie Region of Discourse.

This, Sir, having been the past Fortune of our Predecessors; And, as the
Pregnant Hopes of your blooming Spring, promises the World like to be yours in
the future; yours, when both the splendid Beauties of your most glorious
Palace, and the lasting Structure of your Marble Domitory, time shall have so
levigated, that the wanton Winds dally with their Dust: I doubt not but to find
you so much a Mecaenas, as to affect the Eternizing of your Name, more from the
lasting Lineaments of Learning, then those vain Phainomena of Pleasures, which
are the low Delights of more Vulgar Spirits.

Though I confess these (...) beneath the serious View, (...) a Wit Acuated
with the best Adjuncts of Art, will, ere long, render the ordinary Recreations
of your Progressive Studies; yet, as in relation to the Latitude for which they
were Calculated: I hope they may not appear unworthy a present Supervisall; It
being intended (like the weak Productions of the early Spring) but for the
April of your Age; where, though my Hopes tell me it may subsist, whilst
irrigated with those balmy Dews of Passion, which are the usual Concommitants
of Youth: I am not guilty of so un-becoming a Boldness, as to think it fit to
stand the heat of your more vigorous Maturity, when the Meridian Altitude of
your Comprehensive Judgment shall have attained so near an universality of
Knowledge; As the Sun when in its Apogaeum, does of Light, that being only
hindered by a Comparatively Punctillo of Earth; As the powerful Energies of
noble Souls, are by the upper Garments of their Mortality, from being at once
Ubiquitary Blessings.

Fortified by these Considerations, with the hope of your Acceptance, and
assured, that prefixing your Name, is an Amulet of sufficient power to preserve
me from the Contagion of Censure; I have, with an unruffl'd Confidence, given
these Papers a Capacity of being publicly viewed: If their being liked attain
but near the Dimensions of your being beloved, it will co-equate the knowledge
the World shall have of them; that being so universal, as the Serenities of
your Bliss is the happiness of your nearest Relations; so is it much of the
hopes of those, that only know you at a remoter distance: And shall be still
the Prayer of,

SIR, Your devoted Servant, William Chamberlayne.
Shaftsbury, May 12. 1659.
TO THE READER.
SInce Custom obliges me to give a Welcome at the Gate, I shall not be so
irregular, as not to meet that common Civility, with a fair Compliance. And
though like the passive Elements, I lie open to all the Incongruity of Aspects,
of which I have some reason to doubt, the most powerful may be found in a
disdainful opposition; yet, like the noblest of Active Creatures ( Light) I
shall not think my self sullied by every Vapor; nor solicit his
Acquaintance, that cannot so long spare his Eyes from beholding more Active
Vanities.

I have always held it a Soloescim for Entertainers to be Beggars. And,
although by exposing these Papers to the public View, I must consequently
expect variety of Censures; should be loath to descend so low to court the
Applause of every Reader, from whose various Genii, I am necessitated to take
such Welcome, as Affection in most (though Judgment in so the) shall incline
them to give. For the first of which, as their Censures are doubtful, so their
Calumnies are small, not of weight sufficient to balance the indifferent
temper of my thoughts: But for the latter, since looked upon as competent
Judges, though their Sentence may be formidable; I shall beg no further favor,
then what their Ability thinks fir to bestow; only, for what they may justly
except against, could rather wish that whilst these Papers were private, I had
had their Advice to reform, then now they are published their Censure to
condemn. Fortune has placed me in too low a Sphere to be happy in the
Acquaintance of the Ages more Celebrated Wits: Wherefore wonder not, that I
appear un-usher'd in with a Train of Encomiums, which (though I confess) If
from knowing and juditious Friends, they add a Luster to the Authors ensuing
Labors; yet the Custom of these Times often makes them appear as ridiculous,
as a splendid and beautiful Front to an empty and contemptible Cottage.

I have made bold with the Title of Heroic, but have a late Example that
deters me from disputing upon what grounds I assumed it: If it suits not with
the Abilities of my Pen, yet it is no un-becoming Epithet for the Eminence of
those personated in my Poem. For the place of my Scean, manner of Composure,
and the like; though in Prefaces they often find an immature Discovery, and
perhaps, but acuate an Apetite to what, on further progress may prove but a
distasteful Banquet: I hold them so impertinent, that if Will, and Leisure
serves you to read, you may suddenly with more Advantage, satisfy your self,
if not omit them as strangers to your other Affairs, and not to be understood
but in their own Dialect.

I have done with all that in probability may prove my Readers; And now a word
to such, whom I presume, will be none, for they are desired to do no more then
the Epistle, It being fit to serve them like Vagabonds, let them enter no
further then the Gate; I mean, all squint-eyed Sectaries, from the Spawn of
Geneva, to the black Brood of Amsterdam: together with some Rascals of a lower
Rank, such as usurp the abused Title of, Sons of Art, and with an empty
Impudence, endeavor to pollute those Immaculate Virgins; whilst the other,
with an exalted Villainy sully the Celestial Beauties of Divine Truth. For the
first of which, the preposterous Genius of the Times has so far favored them,
that now nothing is more vendible then the surreptitious offsprings of their
immagin'd Wit: Every Stationers Shop affording pregnant examples of it, in big
bulk'd Volumes of Physic, Astrology, and the like: By these indigent Vermin,
either to satisfy their clamorous Wants, or inhance their esteem in the Vulgar
Opinion, basely prostituted to every illiterate Spectator; whilst Truth, and a
guilty Conscience, tells them naught is their own but the Hyperbolicall Titles,
which to discerning Eyes appear but the glorious outsides to tainted
Sepulchers, in which their detected Villainy shall be Abominated by more knowing
Posterity^ These cry down all things of this Nature, for Subjects of Inutility,
not tending to the improvement of Science, which in the most genuine
Construction of it, has no Enemy from which her ruin is more formidable then
from them.

But for my more dangerous Sceptick, (who yet is so much like the Fool of an
Ass, that he appears to the World with his Spleen in his Mouth) I mean, my
pretended zealous Censurer, from whom in me, it were an over-weaning boldness
to expect Civility; since (though not for the Nature, which he understands not,
yet for the Name which he has only heard of, he is so much an Enemy to the
Muses; that should the Seraphick Strains of Majestic David, or the flaming
Raptures of Elegiack Jeremiah, appear to the World in their pristine and
unpolluted Purity; his Ignorance would extend to so vast an Error, to censure
them of Levity.

But as no man will esteem the Sun less Glorious, for that the hated Owl
avoids its sight; so I presume, none, except their own deluded Followers will
betray so palpable a dearth of Judgment, as to bear the less estecm to
Majestic Poetry; for the illiterate scandal of flattering Ignorance: Poesy
(if justly meriting to be invested in that glorious Title) being of so
attractive a Beauty, that it does rather like an Orphean Harmony, draw that
Emblem of a Beast, the unpollisht Clown to a listening Civility, then like
Circe's Enchantments, change the more happily Educated, to a swinish and sordid
Lethargy. But her defense being a burden which already stands firm on so many
noble Supporters, whose Monuments will remain, till Time it self shall be lost
in Eternity: I need not add my weak Endeavors to illustrate a Beauty, which
the wiser world already admires; Now (though she want the Applause of some)
Attribute it not to the defect, either of her Excellency, or their Judgment;
but to that various Dress of Humors, wherewith Nature has Checkered the
Universe: Concluding with that Honor of ancient Thebes, (...).

W. C.

PHARONNIDA. The first Book.
CANTO THE FIRST.
The ARGUMENT.
I.
From Seas wild fury, and the wilder rage
Of faithless Turks, two noble strangers freed,
Let Courtesy their grateful Souls engage
To such a Debt as does obstruct their speed.
II.
Where they to fill those Sceans unactive rest,
Would tedious make in fair description saw,
How Spata's Prince for his Queens loss oppressed,
Found all those Ills cured in Pharonnida.
THE Earth which lately lay like Nutures Tomb,
Marbl'd in Frosts, had from her pregnant Womb
Displayed the fragrant Spring, when courted by
A calm fresh Morning, ere Heavens brightest Ey
Adorned the East, a Spartan Lord, whom Fame,
Taught from Desert, made glorious by the Name
Of Aminander, with a noble train,
(Whose active Youth did sloath-like sin disdain)
Attended, had worn out the Morning in
Chase of a stately Stag, which having bin
Forced from the Forests safe protection, to
Discovering Plain, his clamourous Foes had drew
Up to a steep Cliffs lofty top, where he
As if grown proud, so sacrificed to be
To man's delight, amongst the pu^suing cry,
(Who make the Valleys echo Victory)
Sinks weeping, whilst exalted shouts did tell
The distant Hea^ds, their ancient Leader fell.
The half-tir'd Hunters, their swift Game stopped here
By death, like noble Conquerors appear,
To give that Foe, which now resistless lies
With their shrill Horns his Fun'rall Obsequies;
Which whilst performing their diverted sight,
Turns to behold a far more fatal fight:
That since famed Gulf, where the brave Austrian made
The Turkish Crescents an eternal shade,
Beneath dishonor seeks, Lepanto lay
So near, that from their lofty station they
A Ship upon whose Streamers there were fixed
The Christian Badge saw in fierce Battle mixed,
With a prevailing Turkish Squadron that
With shouts assault, what now lay only at
That feeble Guard, which under the pretense
Of injuring others, seeks its own defense.
Clear was the day, and calm the Sea so long
Till now the Turks, whose numbers grew too strong,
For all that could no other help afford,
But humane strength, within their view did board
The wretched Christians, to whose sufferings they
Can lend no comfort, but what Prayers convey
To helpful Heaven, by whose attentive Ear,
Both heard and pittyed, Mercy did appear
In this swift change: A hollow Wind proclaims
Approaching storms, the black Clouds burst in flames,
Imprisoned Thunder roars, and in a shoure,
Dark as the Night, dull sweaty Vapors pour
Themselves on the earth, to enrich whom Nature vents
The etherial Fabrics useless excrements;
Whose flatuous pride, as if it did disdain
Such base descents, rolling the liquid plain
Into transparent Mountains, hurls them at
The brow of Heaven, whose Lamps by Vapors that
Their influence raised, are crampt, whilst the sick day
Was languishing to such a Night as lay
Over the first Matter, when Confusion dwelt
In the vast Chaos, ere the rude Mass felt
Heavens segregating breath; But long this fierce
Conflict indures not, ere the Sunbeams pierce
The scatterd Clouds, which whilst wild Winds pursue
Through sullied Air in reaking Vapors flew.
In this Encounter of the storm before
Its sable Vail let them discover more,
Then contained horror, a loud dreadful shriek,
Piercing the thick Air, at their Ears did seek
For trembling entrance, being transported by
Uncertain drifts, rent Sails and Tackling fly
Amongst the towering Cliffs, a sure presage
That adverse Winds did in that storm engage
Some Vessel, which did from her Cordage part,
With such sad pangs, as from the dying Heart
Convulsions tear the Fibers. But the day
Recov'ring her lost Rain, made clearer way
For a more sad discov'ry. They behold
The brackish Main in funeral Pomp unfold
The Trophies of her Cruelty: Her Brow
Uncurl'd with Waves, was only spotted now
With scattered Ruins, here engaged within
The ruffl'd Sails, some sad Souls that had been
For life long struggling tired, at length are forced
To sink and die; Yonder a Pair divorced
From all the warm Society of flesh,
With cold stiff Arms embrace their Fate; The fresh
And tender Virgin in her Lovers sight,
The Sea-Gods ravish, and the Enthean light
Of those bright Orbs, her Eyes, which could by naught
But Seas be quenched, to eternal darkness brought.
Whilst pitying these, a sudden noise, whose strange
Confusion did their Passions Object change,
Assaults their wonder, which by this surprise
Amazed, persuades them to inform their Eyes
With its obscure Original, when led
By sounds that might in baser Souls have bred
A swift aversion: clashing Weapons they
Might soon behold upon the Sands, that lay
Beneath the Rock, a Troop of desperate men,
Unstartled with those dangers, which even then
Their ruined Ship, and dropping Garments showed
Heaven freed them from, what Mercy had bestowd:
Let their own anger loose, which flaming in
A fatal Combat, had already bin
In blood disfigured: But when now so near
Them drawn, that every Object did appear
In true distinction, they with wonder raised
To such a height, as Poets would have praised
Their Heroes in, a noble Christian saw
Whose Sword (as if by the eternal Law
Of Providence, to punish Infidels,
Directed) with each falling stroke expels
A Turks black Soul; Yet Valor being oppressed
By multitudes, must have at length sought rest
From Death, had not brave Ariamnes, by
His Hunters followed, brought him Victory:
Whilst the approaching danger did exclude
Even hope, the last support of Fortitude.
The desperate Turks that chose the Sea to be
Their sad Redeemer of Captivity:
Though from that fear they fled to death, had now
Upon the Shore left none, life could allow
But motion to, though stopped by death such store,
All the Escaped appeard, but such as bore
The fatal Story of destruction to
Their distant Friends; when now a serious view
By Ariamnes, and that noble Youth,
Whose Actions (honored as authentic truth)
Made all admire him, of their pitty'd dead
With sorrow took, one worthy Soul unfled
From life they found, which by Argalia seen,
With joy recalls those Spirits that had been
In busy Action lost, but danger that
Toward the Throne of life seemed entering at
Too many wounds, denies him to enlarge
The Sheam of Love, as noble Virtues charge
To him (her follower) Ariamnes by
His goodness, and their sad necessity,
Prompted to pity, fearing slow delays
As dangers fatal Harbinger, conveys
The wounded strangers to the place, where he
His Palace made the Throne of Charity.
'Twas the short journey 'twixt the Day and Night,
The calm fresh Evening, Times Hermaphrodite.
The Sun on Lights dilated Wings being fled,
To call the Western Villagers from Bed:
Ere at his Castle they arrive, which stood
Upon a Hill, whose Basis freng'd with wood,
Shadowed the fragrant Meadows, thorough which
A spacious River, striving to enrich
The flowery Valleys, with what ever might
At home be profit, or abroad delight,
With parted streams that pleasant Islands made,
Its gentle Current to the Sea conveyed.
In the composure of this happy place
Wherein he lived, as if framed to embrace
So brave a Soul, as now did animate
It with its presence, strength, and beauty sat
Combined in one, 'twas not so vastly large,
But fair convenience countervaild the charge
Of Reparations, all that modest Art
Affords to so^^r pleasures every part,
More for its Ornament, but none were dressed
In Robes so rich, but what alone expressed
Their Masters providence and care to be,
A prop to falling Hospitality;
For he not Comet-like did blaze out in
This Country Sphere, what had extracted been
From the Courts lazy Vapors, but had stood
There like a Star of the first Magnitude,
With a fixed constancy so long, that now
Grown old in Virtue he began to bow
Beneath the weight of time, and since the calm
Of Age had left him nothing to embalm
His Name but Virtue, strives in that to be
The glorious wonder of Posterity;
Each of his Actions being so truly good,
That like the Ground where hollowed Temples stood,
Although by age the Ruins ruined seem,
The people bear a reverent esteem
Unto the place; so they preserve his Name,
A yet unwasted Pyramid of Fame.
Rich were his public Virtues, but the price
Of those was but the World to Paradise,
Compared with that rare Harmony that dwells
Within his Walls, each Servant there excells
All but his Fellows in dese^t, each knew,
First when, then how his Lords Commands to do;
None more enjoyed, then was enough, none less,
All did of plenty taste, none of excess;
Riot was here a stranger, but far more
Repining penury, never from that door,
The Poor-man went denied, nor did the rich
Ere surfeit there, 'twas the blessed Medium, which,
Extracted from all compound Virtues we
Make, and then Christian Mediocrity,
Within the compass of his spacious Hall,
Stood no vain Pictures to obscure the Wall,
Which useful Arms adornd, and such as when
His Prince required assistance, his own men
Valiant, and numerous, managed to defend
That righteous Cause, but never to attend
A popular Faction, whose corrupted Seed
Hell did engender, and Ambition feed.
His Judgment that like Life's Attendant, Sense,
To try each Objects various difference,
Fit Mediums chose (which he made Virtue) here
Beholding (though these wandering Stars appear
Now in their greatest detriment) the Rays
Of perfect worth, he to that Virtue pays
Those Attributes of honor, which unto
Their Births (though now in course disguise) was due:
To Aphrons wounds successful Art applies,
Prevailing Medicines, whilst Invention flies
To the Aphelion of her Orb to seek
Such modest Pleasures as might smooth the Cheek
Of ruffl'd Passion, which being found are spent,
To cure the sad Argalia's discontent:
Which long being lost to all delight, at length
Revives again his Friends recovered strength.
They having now no Remora to stay
Them here but what their gratitude did pay
To his desires, whose Courtesy had made
Those bonds of Love, with as much zeal obeyed,
As those which duty locks, preparing are
To take their leave, even in whose civil War
Whilst they contend with Courtesies, as sent
To rescue when his Eloquence was spent.
Brave Amminander, with such have as showed
His speed to some supreme Injunction owed
Such diligence, a Messenger brings in
A Packet, which that noble Lord had been
Too frequently acquainted with to fear
The unseen Contents which opened did appear,
A Mandate from his royal Master to
Attend him ere the next days Beauties grew
Deformed with Age, which honored Message read
To banish what Suspicion might have bred
In's doubtful Friends, he the enclosed contents,
With cheerful have unto their view presents.
Their fear thus cured by information, he
That his appearance in the Court might be
More glorious made by such Attendants to
Incite in them a strong desire to view
Those royal Pastimes, thus relates that story,
Whose fatal truth transferred the Morea's glory
So often thither. 'Twas my honored friends
My fate ('among some, that yet his Court attends)
Then to be near my Prince, when what now draws
Him to these parts did prove at once the cause
Of joy and grief. Not far from hence removed,
The Vale of Ceres lies, where his beloved
Pharonnida remains, a Lady that,
Nature ordaind for man to wonder at;
She not being more the comfort of his age,
Then glory of her Sex: but I engage
My self to a more large discovery, which,
Thus take in brief, When Youth did first enrich
Beauty with manly strength, his happy Bed
Was with her royal Mother blessed, who fed
A flame of Virtue in her Soul, that lent
Light to a Beauty, which being excellent,
In its own Sphere, by that reflection shon,
So heavenly bright, Perfections height of noon
Dwelt only there; Some years had circled in
Times revolutions, since they first had been
Acquainted with those private pleasures that
Attend a Nuptial Bed, ere she did at
Lucina's Temple offer, whose barred Gate,
Once open flow, both their good Angels sat
In council for her safety, hopes of a Boy,
To be Morea's Heir, fill high with joy
The ravished Parents, Subjects did no less,
In the loud voice of Triumph theirs express.
But when the active pleasures of their love
Which filled her Womb, had taught the Babe to move
Within the mory Mount, preceding pains,
Tell the fair Queen, that the dissolving Chains.
Nature incos'd it in, were grown so weak,
That the imprisoned Infant soon would break
Those slender Cuards, the gravest Ladies were
Called to assist her, whose industrious care,
Lend Nature all the helps of Art, but in
Despair of safety send their Prayers to win
Relief from Heaven, which swift Assistance lent,
TO unload the Burden, but those Cordials sent,
By Harbengers, with whom the fair Queen fled,
To deck the silent dwellings of the dead,
And lodge in Sheets of Lead, over which were cast
A Coverlet of the Springs Infants past
From life like her, even whilst Earths teeming Womb,
Promised the World, and not a silent Tomb,
That beauteous Issue; But those Nimphs which spun
Her thread of life the slender twine begun,
Too fine to last long, undenied by
The pondrous burden of Mortality;
Beneath whose weight, she sinking now to death,
The unhappy Babe was by the Mothers breath
No sooner welcomed into life before
She bids farewell, of Power to do no more,
But whilst her Spirits with each word expires,
Thus to her Lord express her last desires.
Receive this Infant from thy dying Queen,
Name her Pharonnida, at which word between
His trembling Arms she sunk, and had even then
Breathed forth her Soul, if not recalled again,
By their loud Mournings from the Icy sleep,
Which like a chilling Frost did softly creep,
Through the cold Channels of her blood to bar
The springs of life, in which defensive War,
The hasty Summons sent by death allow,
Her giddy Eyes, whose heavy leads did bow
Toward everlasting slumber, no more light,
Then what affords a dim Imperfect sight;
Such as the troubled Optics being by,
Dying Convulsions wrested, could let fly,
Thorough their sullied Chrystals to behold,
Her woeful Lord, whilst she did thus unfold
Her dying thoughts; O hear, O hear (quoth she) I do,
By all our mutual Vows conjure thee to
Let this sweet Babe, all thou have left of me,
Within thy Thoughts preserve my Memory.
And since (poor Infant) she must lose her Mother,
To beg an entrance here, oh let no other
Have more Command over her then what may bear
An equal poise with thy paternall Care.
This, this is all that I shall leave behind,
An earnest of our loves, here thou may find,
Perhaps my Image to behold, whilst I
Resolving into dust embraced do lie,
By crawling Worms. Followers that Nature gave
To attend Mortality, whilst the tainted Grave
Is ripening us for Judgment: O my Lord,
Death were the smile of Fate, would it afford
Me time to see this Infants growth, but oh,
I feel Life's Cordage cracked, and hence must go
From time and flesh, like a lost Feather fall
From the Wings of Vanity, forsaking all
The various business of the World, to see
What wondrous Change dwells in Eternity.
This said, she faintly bids farewell, then darts
An eager look on all, but ere she parts,
Even whilst the breath, with which in thin Air slips
Departing Spirits, on her then cold Lips
In clammy Dews did hang, she of them takes
Her last farewell, whilst her pure Soul forsakes
Its brittle Cab'net, and those Orbs of light,
That swam in death, sunk in eternal Night.
Thus di'd the Queen, Pharonnida thus lost,
Ere knew her Mother, when her Birth had cost,
A price so great, that brought her Infancy
In debt to Grief, until maturity
Ripened her Age to pay it, after long
And vehement lamentation, such whose strong
Assaults had almost shook his Soul into
A flight from the Earth, her Father does renew
His long lost Mirth, at the delight he took,
In his Souls Darling; whose each cheerful look,
Crimsoned those Sables, which even whilst he wore
A flood of Woes his head had silvered over:
Had not this Comfort stopped them, which beguiles
Sorrow of some few hours, those pretty smiles,
^^at dressed her fair Cheeks like a gentle Thief,
^^ealing his heart through all the Guards of Grief.
(...) But when that time's expunging hand had more
Defaced those sable Characters he wore
(...) Sorrows Livery over his Soul, and she
^^aving out-grown her tender Infancy,
^^id now (her Thoughts composed of heavenly Seed)
(...) guide her life no other Guardian need,
(...) native Virtue, for her calm retreat,
When burthend Corinth was with throngs repleat:
(...) chose this seat, whose venerable shade,
Waving what blind Antiquity had made,
^or sacred held, is not so slighted, bu^
Custom ancient, as our Law, has shut
^ence (as the hateful marks of servitude)
^ll that unbounded power did e're obtrude
^n suffering Subjects, which, this happy place
^its so serene a blessing to embrace,
^s is this Lady, whose illustrious Court,
Though now augmented by the full resort,
Of her great Fathers Train, does still appear
This happy Kingdoms brightest Hemisphear.
A hundred noble Youths in Sparta bred,
Of Valor high, as ere for Beauty bled,
^ll loyal Lovers, and that Love confined
Within the Court are for her Guard assigned.
^ut what (if often in such an Orb of all
That Is great, or good, may low as Censure fall)
^he Court has questioned, is the cause that moved
The Prince to give a Party so beloved
unto his hands that leads them, being one
Whose Birth excepted, that being near a Throne,
Those Virtues wants on whose Foundation wise
Considerate Princes let their Favors rise.
Like the abortive Births of Vapors by
Their Male Progenitors enforced to fly
Above the Earth their proper Sphere, and there
Lurk in imperfect Forms, his Breast does bear
Some Seeds of Goodness, which the Soil too hot,
With rank Ambition, does in ripening rot.
Yet, though from those that praise humility,
He merits not, a dreaded power which he
Far more applauds, raised on the Wings of's own
Experienced Valor, has so long been known
His Foes pale terror, that it is feared he bends
That Engine to the ruin of his friends,
Whose equal Merits claim as much of Fame,
As e're was due to proud Almanzors Name.
Yet what may raise more strong desires to see,
Her Court then Valors wished society,
Is one unusual Custom, which the love
Of her kind Father has so far above
All past Examples raised, that for the time
He here resides, no Cause, although a Crime,
Which death attends, but is by her alone
Both heard and judged, he seeming to unthrone
His active power, whilst Justice does invest
His beauteous Daughter, which to the oppressed,
Whose hopes even shrunk into despair, has in
That harsh extreme their safe Asilum bin:
So that even those that feared the 'vent could now
Mix their desires, the Custom would allow
Her Reign a longer date. But that I may
Illustrate this by a more full survay
Of her excelling Virtues, no pretense,
Of harsh employment shall command you hence,
^^ll you have been Spectators of that Court,
Whose Glories are too spacious for Report.
The noble Youths beholding such a flame,
Of Virtue shown them through the Glass of Fame,
First gaze with wonder on it, which ascends
Into desire, a Rivolet which ends,
Not till its swelling streams had drawn them through
All weak excuses, and engaged them to
Attend on Ariamnes; when to show
How much man's vain Intentions fall below
Mysterious Fate, even in the height of all
Their full Resolves, her Countermands thus call
Back their Intentions, by a Summons that
The uncertain World has often trembled at.
The late recoverd Aphron, whether by
Too swift a Cure, Life's springs being raised too high,
^lowd to a dangerous Plethora, or where
Some Cause occult the Humors did prepare
For that malignant Ill, did, whilst he lay
In tedious expectation of the day,
Shook with a shievering numness, first complain,
Through all his Limbs of a diffusive pain:
Which searching each to find the fittest part,
For its Contagion, on the laboring heart
Fixes at length, which being with grief oppressed,
By the extended Artries to the rest
^th' body sends its flames, the poysond blood
Through every Vein streams in a burning flood.
^is Liver broyls, and his scortch'd stomach turns
The Chile to Cinders; in each cold Cell burns
The humid Brains. A violent Earthquake shakes
The crackling Nerves, Sleeps balmy Daw forsakes
The shrivel'd Obticks; in which trembling fits,
Amongst tortured Senses troubled Reason sits
So long oppressed with Passion, till at length,
Her feeble Mansion, battered by the strength
Of a Disease, she leaves to entertain
The wild Chymera's of a sickly Brain.
And, what must yet to's Friends Affliction add,
More weights of grief, their courteous have which had
Stayed to the latest step of time, must now
Comply with those Commanders, which could allow
No more delays, and leave Argalia to
Be the sole Mourner for his Friend, which drew
As far as humane Art could guess so near
His end, that life did only now appear
In thick, short sobs, those frequent summons that
Souls often forsake their ruined Mansions at.

The ARGUMENT.
III.
Whilst here Argalia in a calm Retreat,
Allays the sorrow felt for's sickly Friend,
Two blooming Virgins near him take their Seat,
Whose harmless Mirth soon finds a hapless end.
IV.
The fairest seized on, and near ruined by
Impeteou^ Lust, had not Andremon's speed
Protected her, till from his fall drawn nigh
The same sad Fate the brave Argalia freed.
THat sad, slow hour, which Art even thought his last,
With the sharp Feav'rs Paroxisme past
Sick Aphron's Spirits to a cool reareat,
Beneath a slumber (Life's remotest seat)
Was gently stolen, which did so long endure,
Till in that opiate quenched, the Callenture
Decayed forsakes him, leaving naught behind,
But such faint symptoms, as from ^ime might find
An easy Cure, which though no perfect end
Is lent to the care of his indulgent Friend,
Yet gives him so much liberty, that now
Fear dares without his friendships breach allow
Sometime to leave him slumbring, whi^st that he
Contemplates Natures fresh variety.
The full blown beauties of the Spring were not
By Summer Sunburned yet, though Phoebus shot
His Rays from Cancer, when prepared to expand
Imprisond thoughts, from Objects near at hand,
To ey-shot Rovers, freed Argalia takes
A Noontide walk, through a fair glade that makes
Her aged Ornaments their stubborn head,
Fold into verdant Curtains, which she spread
In cooling shadows over the bottoms, where
A crystal stream unfetterd by the care
Of nicer Art, in her own Channel played,
With the embracing Banks, until betrayed,
Into a neighboring Lake, whose spacious Womb,
Looked at that distance like a crystal Tomb;
Framed to inter the Nayades. Not far
From hence an Oak, whose limbs defensive War,
Against all the Winds, a hundred Winters knew,
Stoutly maintaind, on a small rising grew,
Under whose shadow whilst Argalia lies,
This Object tempts his Soul into his Eyes.
A pair of Virgins fairer then the Spring,
Fresher then Dews, that ere the glad Birds sing.
The Mornings Carrols drop, with such a pace,
As in each act showed an unstudied grace,
Crossing the Neighboring Plain, were, now so near
Argalia drew, that what did first appear
But the neglected Object of his Ey,
More strictly viewd, calls Fancy to comply,
With so much love, that though no wilder fire
Ere scortcht his breast, he here learnt to admire
Loves first of symptoms. To a shady seat,
Near that which he had made his cool retreat;
Being come beneath a spreading Hawthorn they,
Seating themselves, the sliding hours betray,
From their short lives by such discourse as might
Have made even time (if young) lament his flight.
Retired Argalia, at the sight of these,
Though no obsceaner vanity did please
His Eyes, then Anch'rites are possessed with, when
Numbering their Beads, or from a sacred Pen
Distilling Heavens blessed Oracles, yet he
Wondering to find such sweet Civility
Mixed with that places rudeness, long beholds
That lovely pair, whose every act unfolds
Such linkt affections, as wise nature weaves
In dearest Sisters, but their form bereaves
That thought ere featherd with belief, although
To admitation, beauty did bestow
Her gifts on both, she had those darlings dressed,
In various colors, what could be expressed
By Objects fair, as new created light,
By Roseall mixtures, with immaculate white,
By Eyes that emblemd Heavens pure Azure, in
The youngest Nymph, Florenza, there was seen;
To which she adds Behavior far more free,
Although restraind to strictest modesty,
Then the more sad Ca^ina, who, if there
Were different years in that else equal Pair,
Something the Elder seemd, her beauty such,
As Jove-lov'd Leda's was not praised so much,
For Rose or Lillies residence, though they
Did both dwell there, as to behold the day
Lose its Antipathy to Night, such clear
And conquering Beams so full of light to appear
Thorough her Eyes, showed like a Diamond set,
To mend its Luster in a foil of Jet.
Nor does their dress of Nature differ more
In color, then the Habits which they wore;
Though fashiond both alike, Floronza's green,
As the fresh Spring when her first Buds are seen,
To cloth the naked Boughs: Carinas white
As Innocence, before she takes a flight,
In thought from cold Virginity. Their Hair
Wreathed in contracting Curls, beneath a fair
But often parting Vail, attempts to hide
The naked Ivory of their Necks, that pride
Of Beauties Frontispiece. On their heads sat
Lovely, as if unto a Throne of State;
From their first Earth advanced, two flowery Wreaths,
From whose choice mixture in close Concord breaths
The fragrant Odor of the Fields, placed by
Them in such order, as Antiquity
Mysterious held: Being sat, to pass away
The unactive heat of the exalted day,
They either tell old harmles Tales, or read
Some story where forsaken Lovers plead
Unpittied Causes, then betwixt a smile
And Tear bewail Passion should ere beguile
Poor Reason so, at length, as if they meant
To charm him who far from each ill intent
So near them lay, melting the various throng
Of their Discourse, into a well-tuned Song;
Whose swift division moulds the Air into
Such Notes, as did the Spears first tunes outdo.
Argalia in this Lab'rinth of delight,
To Action lost, had drawn the vail of Night,
In quiet slumbers, over his heavy Eyes,
Locked in whose Arms, whilst he securely lies
Least the mistakes of vain Mortality,
The brittle Glass of Earth should take to be
Perfections lasting Addamant, this sad
Chance did unravel all their mirth; There had
Some of the Princes noblest Followers, in
That Mornings nonage led by Pleasure been,
Far from their Sphere, the Court, and now to shun
The unhealthy Beams of the refl^cted Sun,
Whilst it its shortest shadows made, were to
The cool protection of the Woods withdrew:
In which retreat, as if conducted by
Their evil Genius (all his Company
An awful distance keeping) none but proud
Almanzor in those guilty Groves, which shroud
The hapless Virgins enters, who so near
Him sitting, that, soon his informing Ear
Thither directs his Eye, unto his view
Ere scarce thought obvious swiftly they withdrew
But with untimely have, his Soul that nursed
Continual flames within it, at the first
Sight kindles them, ere he discovers more,
Then difference in the Sex, such untried ore,
Hot, heedless lust, when made by practice bold,
In The flame of passion vente^s on for Gold.
But when drawn nearer to the place he saw
Such beauties whose magnetic form might draw
Souls steeld with Virtue, custom having made
His impious Rhetoric ready to invade,
He toward them have, with such a pace as might
Excuse their judgments, though, in open flight,
They strove to shun him, but in vain, so near
Them now he is drawn, that the effects of fear
Obscuring reason, as if safety lay
In separation, each a several way
From danger flies, but since both could not be,
By that secure, whilst her blessed stars do free
The glad Carina, from his reach the other
He swiftly seizes on; hot kisses smother
Her outcries in the Embrio, and to death
Near crushed Virginity, ere from lost breath
She could a stock of strength enough recover,
To spend in prayers; the tempting of a Lover,
Mixed with the force of an Adult'rer, did
At once assail, and with joynd powers forbid
All hopes of safety; only, whilst despair
Looked big in apprehension, whilst the Air
Breathed naught but th^eatnings, promising him to pay
For It in her answers, she does lust betray
Of some few minutes, which with all the power
Of prayer she seeks to lengthen, sheds a shower
Of tears, to quench those flames, but sooner might
Hels sooty Lamp extinguished be, the sight
Of such a fair, but pitiful aspect,
When Lust assails, wants power to protect.
By this hot parley, whilst she strove to shun
His loathd embraces, the throngd Spirits run
To fortify her Heart, but vainly seek
For entrance there, being back into her Cheek
Sent in disdainful blushes; now she did
Entreat Civility, then sharply chid
His blushless impudence; but he whose skill
In Rhetoric was pregnant to all ill,
Though barren else, summons up all the choice
Of Eloquence, that might produce a Voice
To win fair Virtues Fortress, though her chaste
Soul armd against those battering Engines past
That Conflict without danger, when enraged,
By being denied, with passion that presaged
A dangerous Cons'quence, his fierce eyes sixth
On hers, that melting with pale terror mixed
Floods with their former flames, her souls sad doubt
He thus resolves. Unworthy Whore, that out
Of hate to Virtue do deny me what
Thou freely grantst to every rude Swain that
But courts thee in a Dance. Think not these tears
Shall make me wave a pleasure, that appears
Worth the receiving. Can your sordid Earth
Be honored more then in the noble Birth
Of such a Son as, would thou yield to love,
Might call thee Mother, and hereafter prove,
The glory of your Family, from Jove,
The noblest Mortals heretofore that strove
To fetch their Pedigree, thought it no stain,
So to be illegitimate, as vain
Is this in thee, there being as great an Ods
'Twixit you and u^, as betwixt us and Gods?
Trembling Florenza, on her bended knees
Thus answers him; That dreadful power that sees
All our disvellop'd thoughts, my withess be
You wrong my Innocence: I yet am free
From every thought of Lust. I do confess
The unfathomd distance 'twixt our Births, but less
That will not make my sin, it may my shame
The more, when my contaminated Name
Shall in those ugly Characters be shown,
To the Worlds public view, that now is known
By the blush of honesty, whose style, though pore,
Exceeds the Titles of a glorious Whore;
Attended whilst Youth does unwitherd last,
With envied greatness, but frail beauty past
Into a swift decay, assaulted by
Rotteness within, and black mouthed Callumny,
Without, cast off, blushing for guilt, the scorn
Of all my Sex. My Mother would unborn
Wish her degenerate Issue, my Father curse
The hour he got me. As Infection worse
Then mortal Plagues, each Virgin that has naught
To glory in, but what she with her brought
Into the World, an unstaind Soul, would fly
The Air I breath; cast Whores being Company
For none but Devils, when corrupted vice
A Wilderness makes Beauties Paradise.
To this much ill, dim eyed Mortality
A prospect lends; but what, oh what should be
When we must sum up all our time in one
Eternal day, since to our thoughts unknown,
Is only feared. But if our hallowed Laws
Are more then Fables, the everlasting Cause
'Twill of our torment be. If all this breath
Formd into Prayers, no entrance finds, my death
Shall buy my Virgin-freedome, ere I will
Consent to that, which being performd will kill
My honor to preserve my life, and turn
The unworthy beauty which now makes you burn
In these unhallowed flames into a Cell,
Which none but the black Inhabitants of Hell
Will ere possess. Those private thoughts which give
If we continue verteous, whilst we live
On Earth, our Souls commerce with Angels, shall
Be turned to Furies, if we yield to fall
Beneath our Vices thus, O then take heed
Do not defile a Temple, such a deed
Will, when in labor with your latest breath,
With horror Curtain the black Bed of death.
Though Prayers in vain strove to divert that Crime,
He prosecutes, yet to protract the time,
She more had said, had not all Language been
Lost in a storm of 's Lust, which raging in
His fury gives a fresh assault unto
Weak Innocence, for Mercy now to sue
To hope seems vain, robustious strength did ba^
The use of Language, which defensive War
Continuing till the breathless Maid was wrought
Almost beneath resistance, just Heaven brought
This unexpected Aid. A lovely Swain
Whose large Possessions in the neighboring Plain,
Had styled him rich, that powerful, which to improve,
To that fair stock his virtue, added love,
Which to flattery, since it lost its eyes,
The world but seldom sees without disguise.
This sprightly Youth led by the parallels
Of Birth, and Fortune, what ere else excels
Those fading blessings, to Florenza in
His Youths fresh April, had devoted been
With so much zeal, that what that heedless age
But dallied with, like Customs which engage
Themselves to habits, ere its growth he knew,
Love equal with his active manhood grew,
Which noble Plant though in the torrid Zone
Of her disdain, 't had nere distemper known,
Yet often those sad vicissitudes does find,
For which none truly loved, that nere had pined,
Which pleasing passion, though his judgment knew
How to divert, ere reason it out-grew,
It often from important action brought
Him to those shades, where Contemplation sought
Calm sollitude, in whose soft raptures, Love
Refining Fancy, lifts his thoughts above
Those joys, which when by trial brought to the test,
Proves thoughts bright Heaven, dull E^rth when once possessed
Whilst seated here, his eyes did celebrate,
(As to those shade,) Florenza often had sat
Beneath kind looks, to ravish that delight,
The tired Ca^ina in her breathless flight,
Come near the place, assaults his wonder in
That dreadful sound, which tells him what had bin
Her cause of fear, which doleful stories end,
Arrived to the danger of his dearest Friend,
Leaves him no time for language, ere wingd by
Anger, and Love, his have strives to out-fly
His eager thoughts. Being now arrived so near
Unto the place, that his informing Ear,
Thither directs his steps, with such a have,
As nimble souls when they are first unc^s'd,
From bodies sly, he thither speeds, and now
Being come, where he beheld with horror how
His better Angel injured was, disputes
Neither with fear nor policy (they are Mutes
When Angers thunder roars) but swiftly draws
His Faulchion, and the justice of his Cause,
Argues with eager strokes, but spent in vain,
Against that unequal strength, which did maintain
The more unlawful, all his power could do,
Is but to show the effects of Love unto
Her he adored, few strokes being spent before
His feeble Arm, of power to do no more,
Faints with the loss o^ blood, and letting fall
The ill-manag'd VVeapon, for his death does call
By the contempt of mercy, so to prove
A Sacrifice, slain to Florenza's Love.
The cursed steel by the robustious hand
Of fierce Almanzor guided, now did stand
Fixed in his breast, whilst with a purple flood,
His life soi^s forth in the Channel of his blood.
This Remora removed, the impious deed
No sooner was performd, but ere the speed
Florenza made (though to her eager flight,
Fear added wings) conveyed her from his sight:
His rude hand on her seises. Now in vain
She lavisht Prayers, the groans in which her slain
Friend breaths his soul forth, with her shrieks did fill
The ambient Air, struck lately with the still
Voice of harmonious Music; But the Ear
Of penetrated Heaven not long could hear
Prayers breathed from so much innocence, yet send
Them back denied, white Mercy did attend
Her swift deliv'ry, when obstructing fear
Through Reason let no Ray of hope appear*
Startled Argalia, who was courted by
Her pleasing Voices milder Harmony,
Into restrictive slumbers, wakend at
Their Altered Tone, have to discover what
Had causd that change, and soon the place attains.
Where in the exhausted treasuce of his Vains
Andremon wallows, and Florenza lies,
Bathed in her tears, ready to sacrifice
Her Life with her Virginity, which sight
Provoked a have, such as his presence might
Protect the trembling Virgin, which perceived,
By cursed Almanzor made to be bereaved
Oth' Spoils of such a wicked Victory,
As Lust had then near conquered, fiercely he
Assails the noble stranger, who detesting,
An Act so full of Villainy, and resting
On the firm just^ce of his Cause, had made
His guiltless Sword as ready to invade,
As was the others that had surfeited,
In blood before. Here equal Valor bred
In both a doubtful hope, Almanzors Lust
Had fierd his Courage, which Argalias just
Attempts did strive to quench. The thirsty steel
Had drunk some blood from both, ere Fortunes Wheel
Turned to the righteous Cause; that Vigor which
Through rivolets of Veins spread the salt Itch
(...) feverish Lust before, was turned into
(...) flame of anger ^ whilst his hands did do,
What Rage does dictate, Fury does assist,
With flaming Paroxismes, and each Nerve twist,
Into a double strength: yet not that flood
Which in this ebullition of his blood
Did through the Channels boil, till they run over.
With flaming spirits, could depress that store
Of manly worth, which in Argalias breast
Did with a quiet even Valor rest;
Moving as in its natural Orb, unstraind
(...) any violent motion, nor yet chaind
By lazy damps of faint mistrust, but in
Dangers extreme, still confident to win
A noble Victory, or in the loss of breath,
I^ his Fate frownd to find an honored death.
Filled with these brave Resolves, until the heat
Of their warm Fury, had Alarmes beat.
(...) the neighboring fields they fought, which tumult by
Such of Almanzors Followers, as were nigh
The Grove reposed, with an astonishment,
That rouzd them heard, they hasten to prevent,
The sad effects that might this Cause ensue.
^re more of danger then their fear they knew;
Arrived even with that fatal Minute, he
Who against Justice strove for Victory,
With such faint strokes, that their descent did give
^ought but assurance that his Foe must live,
(...) happy Conqueror, they usurp the power
(...) Heaven (revenge) and in a dreadful shower
(...) danger with their Furies torrent strive,
(...) orewhelm the Victor; but the foremost drive
Their own destruction on, and fall beneath
His conquering Sword, ere he takes time to breath
Those spirits which, when near with Action ti^'d,
Valor brea^hd fresh, fast as the spent expired.
Here rash Araspes, and bold Leovine,
Two, whose descent in the nearst collateral Line,
Unto Almanzors stood, beholding how
His strength dec^yd, must unto Conquest bow,
In spite of Valor, to revenge his fate,
With so much have attempt, as if too late
Theyd come to rescue, and would now to shun
It Is just reproof, by rashness strive to run
To death before him, finding from that Sword
Their Life's discharge, which did to him afford
Only those wounds, whose fears must live to be
The badges of eternal Infamy.
But here ore-whelmd by an nnequal strength,
The noble Victor soon to the utmost length,
Had life's small thread extended, if not in
The dawn of hope, some troops whose charge had bin,
Whilst the active Gentry did attend the Court,
To free the Country from the feared Resort
Of wild Bandeets, these being directed by
Such frighted Rurals, as employment nigh
The Grove had led, arriving at that time,
When his slain Foes made the mistaken Crime
Appear Argalias, soon by power allay
That fatal storm, which done, a full survay
Of them that death freed from distress being took,
Them through whose wounds life had not yet forsook,
Her Throne they view, amongst whom through the disguise
O^'s blood Almanzor, whose high power they prise
More then discovered Innocence, being found,
As Justice had by close decree been bound,
TO espouse his quarrels, whilst his friends convay
Him safely thence, those ponderous Crimes they lay
Unto Agalias Charge, whose just defense,
Pleads but in vain, for injured innocence.
Now near departing, whilst his helpful friends,
Bore off Almanzor, where he long attends
The cure of's wounds, though they less torment bred,
Then to behold how his lost honor bled;
The sad Florenza comes to take her last
Leave of her lost Andremon, ere she past
That sad stage ore, to his cold clammy Lips
Joining her balmy Twins, she from them sips,
So much of deaths oppressing Dews, that by
That touch revived his soul, though winged to fly
Her ruined seat, takes time enough to breath
These sad notes forth; farewell my Dear, beneath
The ponderous burden of mortality,
My fainting spirits sink. Oh may thou be,
Blessed in a happier Love; all that I crave,
Is that my now departing soul may have
Thy Virgin prayers for her Companions through
Those gloomy Vaults, which she must pass unto
Eternal shades; had Fate assigned my stay,
Till we'd together gone, the horrid way
Had then been made delightful, but I must
Depart without thee, and convert to dust,
Whilst thou art flesh and blood; I in a cold
Dark U^ne must lie, whilst a warm Groom does hold
Thee in thy Nuptial bed, yet there I shall,
If fled souls know what does on earth befall,
Mourn for thy loss, and to eternity
Wander alone; the various World shall be
Refined in flames, time shall afford no place
For Vanity, ere I again embrace
Society with flesh, which ere that must
Change to a thousand forms her varied dust.
What we shall be, or whither we shall go,
When gone from hence, wheth'r unto flames below,
Or joys above, or whether in death we may
Know our departed friends, or tell which way
They went before us, these, oh these are things
That pauze our Divinity; Scepterd Kings,
And Subjects die alike, nor can we tell,
Which does enjoy, or which in torments dwell.
Oh sad, sad ignorance, Heaven guide me right,
Or I shall wander in eternal Night;
To whose dark shades my dim eyes sink apace:
Farewell Florenza, when both time and place,
My separated Soul has left to be
A stranger maskt in Immortality.
Think on thy murtherd friend, we now must part
Eternaly, the Cordage of my heart
That last sigh broke, with that the breath that long
Had hoverd in his Breast, flew with a strong
Groan from that mortal Mansion, which beheld
By such of's friends, whom Courtesy compelled
To that sad Charge, the bloodless body they
With sad slow steps to's Fathers home convey.

The ARGUMENT.
V.
The brave Argalia, who d^sign'd to raise
Through all approaching ills his weighty Fate,
In smooth Compliance that harsh Guard obeys
Who towered his death did prosecute their hate:
VI.
To death, which here unluckily had staind,
Maugre his friends, the ill directed Sword
Of Justice, had not secret love obtaind
More mercy then the strict Laws dare afford.
LOw in a fruitful Pasture, where his Flocks
Cloud with their breath those Plains, whose leavy lock*
Could hardly shadow them, though Meadows need
No shearing, where in untold Droves did feed
His bellowing Herds, of which enough did come,
Each day to's Yoke to serve a Hecatombe;
Lay old And^en^ons Country Farm, in which
(Happy til now) being made by Fortune rich,
And Goodness honest, from domestic strife,
Still calm and free, the upper Robes of Life;
Til witherd he had worn, to ease whose sad
And sullen Cares, less bounteous Nature had
Lent him no numerous Issue, all he would won
By prayer confined unto this murtherd Son:
The blasted Blossom of whose tender age,
When blooming first, taught Hope how to presage
Those future Virtues, which interpreted
By Action had such fruitful Branches spread,
That all indulgent Parents wished to be
Immortalizd in blessed Posterity,
Had seen in him, whose innocently good,
Still let his Heart by's Tongue be understood,
In such a sacred Dialect, that all
Which verg'd within deliberate thought did fall,
Toward Heaven was graced, and in descent did prove
To's Parents Duty, and to's Neighbors Love.
This hopeful Youth, their Ages chief support,
Whose absence though by's own desires made short;
Their Love thought tedious, having now expired
His usual hours, the aged Couple tired
With expectation, to anticipate
His slow appearance to their Mansions Ga^e;
Where softly walked, where cooly shadowed by
An Elm, which planted at his Birth did vie
Age with his Lord, whilst their desires pursue
Its first design, they with some pleasure view
Their busy Servants, whose industrious pain
Sweats out Diseases in pursuit of gain.
All which, although the chiefest pleasure that
Their thoughts contain, whose best are busied at
The Mart oth' World, such small diversion lent
The aged pair, that his kind Mother spent,
With a too long protracted hope had let
Even that expire, had not his Father set
Props to that weakness, and that mutual fear,
Which filled their breasts, let his sound Judgment clear
By the proposing Accidents that might
Untouchd detain their Darling from their sight.
But many Minutes had not left their seals,
On the Records of Time, ere truth reveals
Her horrid secrets. A confused noise
First strikes their Ears, which suddenly destroys
Its own imperfect Embrioes, to transfer
Its Object to that nearer Messenger
Oth' Soul, the Eyes whose beamy Scouts convey
A trembling fear into their Souls, whilst they
That bore their murtherd Son, arrived to tell
Their doleful M^ssage, which so fierce storm fell
Not long in those remoter drops, before
Sweld to a Deluge, the swift Torrent bore
The bays of Reason down, and in one flood
Drowned all their hopes, when purpl'd in his blood
Yet pale with death, untimely Death, she saw
Her hopeful Son, grief violates the Law
Of slower Nature, and his Mothers tears
In death congeals to Marble, her swollen fears,
Grown for her Sex a burden far too great
Had only left death for her dark retreat.
Although from griefs so violent effects,
Reason conjoynd with manly strength protects
His wretched Father, at that stroke his Limbs
S^ack their unweildy Nerves, faint sorrow dims
His Eyes more then his Age, his hands bereft
His hoary head of all that time had left
Unpluckt before, nor had the expecting Grave,
Gaped longer for him, if they then had gave
His passion freedom, his own guilty hand
Had broke the Glass, and shook that little Sand
That yet remaind, into thin Air, that so
Unclog'd with earth, his tortured Ghost might go
Beyond that O^b of Attomes that attend
Mortality, and at that Iournies end,
Meet theirs soon, as swift Destiny inrouls
Those new^ come Guests within the sphere of Souls.
By these sad symptoms of infectious grief,
Those best of friends that came for the relief
Of sorrows Captives, being by that surprizd
They hoped to conquer, sadly sympathizd
With him in woe, till the epedemick Ill,
Stifling each Voice, dressed sorrow in a still
And dismal silence, in which sad aspect,
None needing Robes, or Cypress to detect
A Funeral March, each dolefully attends
To deaths dark Mansion, their lamented friends,
Where having now the earthy Curtain drawn
Over their cold Bed, till Doomsdaies fatal dawn,
Rally their dust they, leave them, and retire
To sorrow, which can never hope to expire
In just revenge, since kept by fear in aw^
Where power offends, the poor scarce hope for Law,
By sad example to confirm this truth,
From innocent and early hopes of youth;
Led towered destruction, let us return to see
That noble stranger, whose captivity,
Like an unlucky Accident depends
On this sad subject. By the angry friends
Of those accused, which in that fatal strife,
To death resigned the Charter of their life,
He Is brought unto the Princes Palace, where
That age, whose Customs knew not how to bear
Such Sails, as these have filled with pride, was placed
The seat of Justice, whose stern Sword defaced
Not pleasures smoothest Front, since now it was by
Her fair hand guided, whose commanding eye,
If armd with Anger, seemd more dreadful then
The harshest Law ere made by wrathful men.
Here strictly guarded, til the important Crime
Which urged her to anticipate the time,
By Custom known, had called her forth to that
Unwilling Office: still unstartled at
The frowns of danger, did Argalia lie
An injured Captive, til commanded by
The stern Reformers of offended Law,
He hasts to the Bar, where come, though death nere saw
A Brow more calm, or Breast more confident,
To meet his Darts: yet since the innocent
Are staind with guilt, when in contempt of Fate,
They silent fall, he means to meet their hate,
With all that each Beholder could expect,
From dying Valor, when 't had to protect
An envied stranger left no more defense,
But what their hate obscures, his Innocence,
The clamorous friends of Aphron, backed by those
Which knew his death the only mean to close
Almanzors bleeding honor, to the fair
And pitiful Pharonnida repair,
With cries of Vengeanc^, whose unwelcom^ sound
She by her Fathers strickt command was bound
To hear, since that those rivolets of Law,
Which from the Sea of regal power did draw
Their several streams, all flowd to her, and in
That crystal Fountain pure as they had bin
From Heaven dispensed, ere just Astrea fled
The Earth remaind, yet such aversion bred
In her soft soul, that to these Causes where
The Law sought blood, slowly as those that bear
The weight of Guilt, she came, whose dark Text she
Still Comments on with noble Charity.
High mounted on an Ebbon Throne, in which,
The imbellisht Silver showed so sadly rich,
As if its varied form strove to delight
Those solemn souls, which Deaths pale fear did fright;
In Tyrian Purple clad, the Princess sat,
Between two sterner Ministers of Fa^e,
Impartial Judges, whose distinguished tasks
Their varied habits to the view unmasks,
One, in whose looks, as pity strove to draw
Compassion in the Table^s of the Law,
Some softness dwelt in a magestick Vest
Of state-like red was cloathd, the other dressed
In dismal black, whose terrible Aspect,
Declard his Office, served but to detect
Her slow consent, if when the first forsook
The Cause, the Law so far as death did look.
Silence proclaimd, a harsh Command calls forth
The undaunted Prisoner, whose excelling wroth,
In this low ebb of Fortune did appear,
Such as we fancy, Virtues that come near
The excellence of Angels; fear had not
Rifl'd one drop of blood, nor rage begot
More color in his Cheeks, his soul in state,
Throned in the Medium, constant Virtue sat
Not sleighting with the impious Atheists, that
Loud storm of danger, but safe anchord at
Religious hope, being firmly confident,
Heaven would relieve, whom Earth knew innocent.
All thus prepared, he hears his wrongful Charge,
(Envy disguizing injured Truth) at large,
Before the people, in such Language read,
As checked their hopes, in whom his worth had bred
Some seeds of pity, and to those whose hate
Pursued him to this Precipice of Fate,
(Dead Aphrons friends) such an advantage gave,
That Providence appeard too weak to save,
One so assaulted; yet, though now deprest,
Even in opinion, which often proves the best
Support to those, whose public Virtues we
Adore, before their private guilt we see*
His noble Soul still wings it self above
Passions dark Fogs, and like that prosperous Dove,
The Worlds first Pilot, for discovery sent,
When all the floods that bound the Firmament,
Ore-whelmd the Earth, Conscience calm joys to increase,
Returns freight with the Olive Branch of Peace.
Thus fortified from all, that tyrant fear
E'reawed the Guilty with, he does appear,
The Courts just wonder in the brave defense
Of what, though power, armd with the strong pretense
Of right opposd, so prevalent had been,
TO have cleard him, if, when near triumphing in
Victorious truth to cloud that glorious Sun,
Some faithless Swains, by large Rewards being won
To spot their souls, had not corrupted by
His Foes been brought, falsely to justify,
Their Accusations, which beheld by him
Whose knowledge now did hopes clear Optics dim;
He ceased to plead, justly despairing then,
That Innocence amongst Mortals rested, when
Banished her own Abode; so thinks it vain
To let truths naked Arms strive to maintain
The Field against his more powerful Foes; not all
His Virtues now protect him, he must fall
A guiltless Sacrifice, to expiate
No other Crime, but their invenomd hate.
An ominous silence, such as often precedes
The fatal sentence, whilst the Accuser reads
His Charge, possessed the pitying Court, in which
Pre^aging Calm, Pharonnida too rich
In mercy (Heavens supreme Prerogative)
To stifle tears did with her passion strive
So long, til what at first assaulted in
Sorrows black Armor had so often bin
For pity cherisht, that at length her eyes
Found there those Spirits that did sympathize
With those that warmd her blood, and unseen move
That Engine of the World, mysterious Love,
The way that Fate predestined, when
It Was first infused in the Embrio, it being then
That which espousd the active form unto
Matter, and from that passive being drew,
Divine Ideas, which subsisting in
Harmonious Natures highest sphere, do win
In the perfection of our Age, a more
Expansive power, and Natures common store
Still to preserve, unites Affections by
The mingled Attomes of the serious eye.
Whilst Natures Priest, the cause of each effect,
Miscal'd Disease indeavou^ to detect
Its unacquainted operations in
The beauteous Princess, whose free soul had bin
Yet guarded in her Virgin Ice, and now
A stranger is, to what she does allow
Such easy entrance, by those Rays that fall
From eithers eyes, to make reciprocal
Their yiedling passions, brave Argalia felt
(Even in the grasp of death) his Functions melt
To flames, which on his heart an onset make,
For sadness such as weaker Mortals take
Eternal farewels in, yet in this high
Tide of his blood, in a soft calm to die;
His yielding Spirits, now prepare to meet
Death, cloathd in thoughts, white as his winding sheet.
That fatal doom, which unto Heaven affords
The sole Appeal, one of the assisting Lords
Had now pronouncd, whose horrid thunder could
Not strike his Laureld Brow, that Voice which would
Have putrified, a timorous Soul he hears
With calm attention, no disorderd fears
Ruffl'd his Fancy, nor domestic War
Raged in his breast, his ^v'ry look so far
From vulgar passions, that, unless amazd
At Beauties Majesty he sometimes gazd
Wildly on that, as Emblems of more great
Glories then earth afforded, from the seat
Of resolution, his fixed soul had not
Been stird to passion, which had now begot
Wonder, not fear within him. No harsh frown
Contracts his Brow, nor did his thoughts pull down
One fainting spirit, wrapped in smootherd groans,
To clog his heart. From her most eminent Thrones
Of Sense, the Eyes, the lightning of his Soul
Flew with such vigor, forth it did control
All weaker passions, and at once include,
With Roman Valor, Christian Fortitude.
Pharonnida, from whom the rigid Law
Extorts his Fate, being now enforced to draw
The longest Line she ere could hope to move
Over his Face, that beauteous sphere of Love,
Unto its great'st obliquity, she leaves
Him in his winter solstice, and bereaves
Loves Hemisphear of light, not hear, yet often
Retreating wished those Stars Fare placed aloft
In the first Magnitude of Honor might
Prove retrograde, so their contracted light
Might unto him part of their Influence
In Life bestow, Passion would fain dispense
So far with Reason, to recall again
The sentence she had past, but hoped in vain,
Those false suggestions moves, his Jaylers are
The undaunted Prisoner hurrying from the Bar;
His fair Judge rising, the corrupted Court
Upon removing, all the ruder sort
Of Hearers rushing out, when through the throng,
Kind Ariamnes (being detaind so long
By strict Employment comes) at whose request,
The Court their Seats resuming, he adrest
Himself to the Princess, in a Language that
Whilst all Argalias Foes were storming at,
Even on her Justice so prevails, that he
Reprieved, til all, hope could produce to free
Her Loves new care might be examind by
His active Friend, who now being seated nigh
Pharonnide, whilst all attentive sat;
The strangers story does at large relate.
Pleased at this full relation, nere as much
As grieved to see those Jewels placed in such
A course cheap Metal, which could never hold
The least proportion with her regal Gold.
Pharonnida had now removed, if not
Thus once more stayed, the Rumor first bego^;
From this sad truth, had with the common have,
Of Ill arrived, where his Disease had placed
Aphron, whose Ears assaulted now with words
Of more infection then that Plague affords
Room for the st^onger Passion: though offended,
To leave a hold it had, at first intended
To keep til ruined, the imprisond blood,
And spirits are unfetterd, by that flood
To wash usurping grief from off that part
Where most she reigned, but they drawn near the heart,
And finding Enemies too strong to be,
Incounter'd mix in their society;
Which thus supplied with Auxiliaries in
Contempt of weakness, when he long had been
Languishing underneath a tedious Load
Of sickness, sends him from his safe Abode;
Amongst dangers which in deaths black shape attend
His bold design, to seek his honored Friend.
Come on the spur of passion to the Court,
A flux of Spirits from all parts resort,
To prompt his anger, which abruptly broke
Forth in this Language. Do not Sirs, provoke
A foreign power thus far (I speak to you,
That have condemnd this stranger) as to do
An Act so opposite to all the Law,
Of Nations, here within your Realm to draw
Blood that is so near allied unto the best
Of an adjacent State. If this request
Of mine, too full of insolence appear,
We are Spirits nobly born, and near
Enough to hav't, whatever Crime's the Cause
Of this harsh sentence, tried by our own Laws.
This bold Opposer of stern Justice, here
Pausing to see what Clouds there did appear
In that fair Heaven, whose influence only now
Could light to's friends declining Stars allow,
To free the troubled Court, which struggled i^
A strange Delemma had commanded bin,
To a more large discovery, if not by
His pitying Friend, discharged in a reply,
Doubting how far inregular boldness had
Provoked just wrath, Argalia thus unclad
Amezements dark disguise. To you that a^
This Court (with that kneels to Pharonnida)
I now for Mercy flee, that scorn to run
From my own doom, so I might have begun
The doubtful task alone, but here to leave
My Friend from whom your Justice did receive
This bold Afront in danger, is a Crime
That not approaching death, which all my time
Too little for repentance calls, can be
A just excuse for, let me then set free
His person with your doubts, and joynd to those
What both their varied stories may compose.
For what this noble Lord, whose goodness we,
First found in needful hospitality,
From him has differd him, impute it not
To eithers error, both Reports begot
From such mistakes, as Nature made to be
The careful Issues of Necessity;
That fatal difference, whose Vestigia stood
Where we Epiciae left fresh filled with blood;
By league so lately with Calabria made,
Being composed, that Fame did not invade
Our Ears with the report, til we had been
By a disguise secured, which shaded in
Whilst fearing danger we nere thought to leave,
Til safe at home; Thus what did first deceive
Kind Aminander you have heard, and now
Without the stein of boasting must allow
Me leave to tell you, that we there have Friends,
On whom the burden of a State depends,
When to the Court just wonder, thus far he,
With such unshaken confidence as we
Pray on the expanded wings of Faith, displayed
His Souls integrity, the Royal Maid,
Whom a repented destiny had made
His pitying Judge, endeavoring to evade
That dooms harsh rigor, grants him a reprieve,
Till thrice the Sun returning to relieve
Nights drooping Sentinels had circl'd in
So many days, in which short time to win
The fair advantage of discovering truth,
Old Aminander, active as fresh Youth
In all Attempts of Charity, to know,
From what black Spring those troubled streams did flow:
Hasts toward Andremons, whi'st Pharonnida
Active as he, toward all, whence she might draw
A consequence of hope, lays speedy hold
On this design, Commissioned to unfold
Their Masters Love toward her, there long had been
Ambassadors from the Epicote in
Her Fathers Court, whose Message though it might
Wear Loves pure Robes, yet in her Reasons light,
Seems so much staind with policy, that all
Those blessings which the wise foresaw to fall,
As Influence from that Conjunction, she
Opposes as her stars malignity.
Proud of this new Command, with such a have,
As those that fear more slow delays may wast
Their precious time, the Ambassadors attain
The Princess Court, where come, though hope in vain,
Only expect a speedy Audience, they
That frustrated, are soon taught to betray
More powerful passions; the first glance oth' eye
They on the Prisoners cast, kind sympathy,
Proclaimed Love gave no leave for time to rust
Their Memories, both the old Lords durst trust
Eyes dimmed with tears, whilst their embraces give
A sad assurance there did only live
Their last and best of Comforts, which beheld,
By those from whom kind pity had expeld
All thoughts of the vindictive Law, they strive
By all the power of Rhetoric to drive
Those sad storms over, which good Office done,
They each inform the Prince, which was the Son
Of Nature, which Adoption, withal tell how
By their persuasions moved, they did allow
Them time to travel, which Disasters had
So long protracted, for some years with sad
And doubtful hopes, they had in vain expected
Their wished return, but that their stars directed
Their course so ill, as now near home to be
Ore-taken with so sad a destiny;
Since such a sorrow could be cured by none,
They sadly crave the time to mourn alone.

PHARONNIDA. The first Book. CANTO THE FOURTH.
The ARGUMENT.
VII.
At length the Vail from the deluded Law
with active Care by Aminander took,
The startled Court in their own error saw
How lovely truth did in Argalia look.
VIII.
The story of our Youth discovered, he
His Merits yet in higher pitch to raise
Morea's Prince does from a danger free,
Which unto death his noblest Lords betray.
THat last sad Night, the rigid Law did give
The late reprieved Argalia leave to live;
Was now wrapped in her own obscurity,
^toln from the Stage of Time, when light got free
From his Nocturnall Prison summons all
Almanzors Friends, to see the longed for fall
Oth' envied stranger, whose last hour was now
So near arrived, faint hope could not allow
So much of comfort to his powerfulst friend,
As told her fears, she longer might suspend
His fatal doom. Mournful Attendants on
That serene Sufferer, all his friends are gone
Unto the sable Scaffold that is ordained
By the decree of Justice to be stained
With guiltless blood, all sunk in grief, but she
Whom by inevitable destiny,
Doomed him to death, most deep. Dull sorrow raigns
In her triumphant, sad and alone remains
She in a Room, whose Windows prospect led
Her Eye to the Scaffold, whither from the Bed
Where sorrow first had cast her, she did often
Repair to see him, but her passions soft
Temper soon melting into Tears, denies
Her Soul a passage through o're-flowing Eyes.
Often she would in vain expostulate
With those (two subtle) Sophisters that Sat
Clothed in the Robes of Fancy, but they still
O^e-threw her weaker Arguments, and fill
Her Breast with Love and Wonder, passion gave
Such fierce Assaults, no Virgin Vow could save
Her Hearts surrender, she must love, and loose
In one sad hour, thus grief does often infuse
Those bitter (...), where hidden poison dwell,
In the smooth pleasures of swee^ Oximel.
Argalias friends that did this minute use,
As if the last of mortal enterviews
Had now reverst their eyes, expecting naught
But that strokes fall, whole fa^all speed had brought
Him to eternal rest; when by a loud
And busy tumult, as if death grown proud
Expected triumphs, to divert their sight,
They from the Scaffolds lofty station might
Within the reach of an exalted Voice,
Behold a Troop, who as the Leaders choice
Confined to st^aight necessity, had there
Inrold all Comers, if of strength to bear
Offensive A^mes, did first appear to be
Some tumult dressed in the variety
Of sudden rage, for here come headlong in
A heard of Clowns, armd as they then had been
From labor called, near them (well orderd ri^e)
(As greatness strove no longer to divide
Societies, (some Youths, brave as they had
Been in the spoils of conquered Nations clad.
This sudden Object, first obstructing all
Their Courts proceedings, prompts their doubts to call
Their absent Prince, who being too wise for fears
Uncertain fixions, with such speed appears,
As checks the tumult, when, to tell them who
Had from their homes the frighted people drew,
In The Van of a wel-orderd Troop rides forth
Loved Aminander, whose unquestiond worth,
That strong Attractive of the peoples love,
Exspung'd suspicion; whilst his Troops did move
With a commanded slowness to inform,
The expecting Prince, from whence this sudden storm
Contracted Clouds, he to his view presents
Andremons Friends, whose looks the sad contents
Of sorrow, with a silent Oratory,
Begs pity; whilst, he thus relates their story.
That we (great Prince) we, whom a loyal fear
To strict obedience prompts, dare thus appear
Before your sacred Person, were a sin
Mercy would blush to own, had we not been
Forced to offensive Arms, by such a Cause
As tore the Scepter, regulated Laws,
Forth of your royal hand, to vindicate
This suffering stranger, whom a subtle hate,
Not solemn Law, pursued. I here have brought
Such Witnesses as have their knowledge bought,
At the expense of all their joy, whom I
Found so confined, as if their misery
Were in their houses sepulcherd, a sad
And general sorrow in one Dress had clad
So many, that their only sight did prove
Lost Virtue caused such universal love
To free this noble Youth, whose Valor lent
A late protection to this Innocent,
But injured, Maid, they (unconstraind) had here
Implored your Aid, had not too just a fear
Caused from some Troops, raisd by a wronged pretense
Of your Commands checked their intelligence,
With such illegal violence, that I
Had shared their sufferings, if not rescued by
These following Friends, whose rude Conjunction shows
It was no studied plot did first compose
So loose a body; but, least it appear
In me like envy, should I strive to clear
This doubtful story, here are those (with that)
Calls forth Andremons Friends, instructed at
The dearest price, which by discovering truth,
Will not alone rescue this noble Youth,
From falling ruin; but least he retreat
Into rebellion, force before this fear,
A man whose power, the people thought had bin
To punish Vice, not propagate a sin.
Having thus far past toward discovery, here
The grave Lord ceast, and that truth might appear,
From its first fair Original, to her
(Whose Virtue Heavens affected Messenger)
Commands Attention, the more horrid part
Of his relation leaves: And here vain Art
Took on, and envy, to behold how far
Thy strickt Rules (which our Youths Afflictions are)
Nature transcends, in a Discourse which she,
With all the Flowers of Virgin modesty,
Not Weeds of Rhetoric strewn; to hear her miss,
Or put a blush for a Parenthesis,
In the relating that uncivil strife,
Which her sad Subject was, so near the life,
Lim^s lovely Virtue, that that Copy whence,
Ar^ took those Graces, she does si^ce dispense
To the best of women, fair Pharonnida,
Ta^ght by that sympathy, which first did draw
Those lovely Transcripts of her sel^, although
Varied as much as humble Flowers that grow,
Dispiers'd in shady Deserts, are from those
That nice Art in enameld Gardens shows,
Yet like bright Planets, which communicate
To Earth their Influence, from exalted state,
She now descends, to cherish Virtue in
Those lovely Nimphs, whose Beauties though they would bin
Yet in the Country clouded from Report,
Soon grow the praise, or envy of the Court.
Imboldned by that gracious favor shown
To these fair Nymphs, to prosecute their own
Most just Complaints, Andremons wretched friends,
With prayers perceive that Mercy which descends
Over all their sufferings, on the expanded Wings
Of noble pity, whose fair hand first brings
Argalia from the sable Scaffold, to
Meet those Rewards to his high Merits due,
Not only in what deaths dark progress stays,
But Life's best joy, an universal praise
Aquir'd from just desert: Next she applies
Her self to those poor burthend Souls, whose Eyes
Look (even on Comforts) through their tears, the dead
Andremons Mourners, whose l^st Joy though fled
For ever from those wintring Regions, yet
As much received as sorrow would permi^,
Souls so oppressed, the splendid Court they leave,
With thankful prayers; And now, called to receive
His sins reward Almanzor is, whose shame
Its black Attendant, when by his ha^ed Name
He Would often been summond, prompts him to deny
That legal Call, which being an Act too high
For a depending power to patroniz^,
To shun feared Justice public doom, he flies
His Princes Mandates, an affront that sent
Him to's desert, perpetual banishment.
This Comet lost in clouds of Infamy,
The Court which had too long been burthend by
His injured power, with praises entertain
Impartial Justice, whilst to call again
Those pleasures which had in this interval
Of Law been lost, the Prince convening all,
That shared those sufferings, as the Center whence
Joy spread it self, to the Courts circumference,
Crowns all their wishes, which by that bright Star
In Honors Sphere, the auspitious Princes are
Exalted to their highest Orbs; her Love
Unto Argalia, though it yet must move,
As an unnoted Constellation, here
Begins its Erae, which that might appear
Without suspicion, she disguises in
The public joy, which amongst those that had bin
His serious Mourners to participate
That kind Epicote, who first taught his Fate,
The way to Glory comes, to whom he now
Was on those Knees Merit had taught to bow,
With as much humble reverence, as if all
The Waights of Nature made those burdens fall
A Sacrifice to Love, fixed to implore
Its constant Progress, but he needs no more
For confirmation, since his Friend could move
But the like joy, where Nature taught to love.
Passions encounter, which too high to last,
Into a calm of thankful prayers being past
The Prince from the Calabrian seeks to know
By what collateral streams he came to owe
Such love unto a stranger, one that stood
Removed from him in the Magnetisme of blood;
Whom thus the Lord resolves, When blooming in
The pride of Youth, whose varied Sceans did win
Time on the Morning of my days, a while
To taste the pleasures of a Summers Smile,
I left the Courts tumulteous noise, and spent
Some happy time, blessed with retired content,
In the calm Country, where Arts curious hand,
As Center to a spacious Round of Land,
Had placed a Palace, in whose lovely Dress,
The City might admire the Wilderness,
Yet though that ill Civility was in
Her marble Circle; Natures hand had bin
As liberal to the neighboring Fields, and dect
Each rural Nymph as gaudy, til neglect,
Or slovenly Necessity had drawn
Her Canvass Furroughs over their Vails of Lawn:
Near this fair Seat, fringed with an ancient Wood,
A fertile Valley lay, where scattered stood
Some homely Cottages, the happy Seats
Of laboring Swains, whose careful Toil compleats
Their wishes in obtaining so much Wealth,
To conquer dire Necessity; firm health,
Calm thoughts, sound sleeps, unstarted innocence,
Softn'd their Beds, and when roused up from thence,
Suppl'd their Limbs for Labor; amongst these,
My loved Argalia, for till Fate shall please,
His dim Stars to uncurtain, and salute
His better Fortune, with each Attribute,
Due to a nobler Birth, his Name must be
Contracted unto that Stenography,
Life's Sceans began, amongst his Fellows that
There first drew breath, being true Heirs to what
Whilst all his Stars were retrograde, and dim,
Unlucky Fortune, but adopted him;
Whilst there residing, I had often beheld
The active Boy, whose Childhoods Bud excelled
More full blown Youths, gleaning the scatterd Loc^^
Of new-shorn Fields, amongst the half-clad Flocks,
Of their unripe, but healthful Issue, by
Which Labor tired, sometimes I see them try
The strength of their scarce twisted Limbs, and run
A short breathd Course, whose swift contention done,
And he (as in each other active ^port)
With Victory crowned, they make their next resort
To the Springs cheap Bounties; but, what did of all
His first Attempts, did give the powerful call,
Both to my Love and Wonder was, what chanced
From one rare Act: the Morning had advanced
Her tempting Beauties to assure success
To these young Huntsmen, who with Labor less
Made by the pleasure of their Journey had
The Forest reached, where with their Limbs unclad
For the pursuit, they follow Beasts that might
Abroad be recreation, and when Night
Summond them home, the welcomest supply
Both to their own, and Parents quality.
An angry Boar, chaft with a Mornings chase,
And now near spent, was come so near the place,
Where (though secured) on the stupendous height
Of a vast Rock they stood, that now no flight
Could promise safety, that wild rage which sent
Him from the Dogs, his following Foes, is sp^nt
In the pursuit of them, which (to my grief,
Had sufferd ere we could have lent relief,
H^d not Argalia, even when danger drew
So near as death, turned on the Beast, and threw
His happy Javelin, whose well guided aim,
Although success it knew not how to claim,
From strength, yet is so much assisted by
Fortune, that what before had scornd to die,
By all our power, when contending in
Nice Art, the honor of that day to win
To him alone, falls by that feeble stroke,
From all his speed; which seen, he, to provoke
His hastier death, seconds those wounds, which in
Their safety are, by those with terror seen,
That had escapt the danger, and even by
Us that pursued with such amaze, that I
Who had before observed those Rays of worth,
Obscured in clouds, here let my love break forth
In useful Action, such, as from that low
Condition brought him, where I might bestow
On him what Art required, to perfect that
R^re piece of Nature, which we wonderd at,
From those whom I ('among others) thought to be
Such whose Affection, the proximity
Of Nature claimd, with a regret that showed,
Their poverty unwillingly bestowd
So loved a Jewel, had procured the Youth,
His Foster Father, loath to wave a truth,
That in the progress of his Fate might be
Of high account, discovers unto me
The worlds mistake concerning him, and thus
Relate his story, He was brought to us,
(Quoth the good man) some ten years since, by two
Who (could men be discoverd to the view
Of knowledge by their Habits) seemd but such
As Fortunes narrow hand had gave not much
More then Necessity requires to be,
Injoyd of every man, whom Life makes free
Of Natures City; though their bounty showed,
To our him judgments, that they only owed
Mischance for those course Habits, which disguised,
What once the World at higher rates had prized,
In The worst extreme of time, about the birth
Oth' fluggish Morning, when the crusted earth
Was tinsel'd over with Frost, and each Sprig clad
With Winters Wool, I whom cross Fortune had
Destined to early Labors, being abroad,
Met two benighted men, far from the Road,
Wandering alone, no skilful Guide their way
Directing in that Infancy of day;
But the faint beams of glimmering Candles, that
Shon from our lovely Cottage-Windows, at
Which Marks they steerd their Course; one of them bore
This Boy, an Infant then, which knew no more
Then Natures untrod paths. These having spied
Me through the Mornings Mists, glad of a Guide,
Though to a place, whose superficial view,
Lent small hopes of relief, went with me to
Mine own poor home, where with such course cheap Fare,
As must content us, that but eat to bear
The burdens of a Life refresht, they take
A short repose, then being to forsake
Their newfound Host, desire with us to leave
The Child, til time should some few days bereave
Of the Habiliments of Light. We stood
Not long to parl, but willing to do good
To strangers so distressed, were never by
Our poverty once tempted to deny.
My wife (being then a Nurse) upon her takes
The pretty Charge, and with our own Son makes
Him Fellow-commoner at the full Breast,
And Partner of the Cradles quiet rest.
Now to depart, one that did seem to have
The nearst relation to the Infant, gave
Him first this Jewel (at which word they showed
One which upon Argalia was bestowed
By those that left him) then that we might be
Not straightned by our former poverty;
Leave us some Gold, by which we since have bin
Enabled to maintain him, though not in
That Equipage, which we presume unto
His birth (although to us unknown) is due.
This done, with Eyes that lost their light in Tears,
They take their leaves, since when, those days to years
Are grown, in which we did again expect
They should return; but whether be neglect
Or else impossibility detain
T^em from his sight, our care has sought in vain.
Having thus plainly heard as much as Fate
Had yet of him discoverd, I, that late
Desired him for his own, now for the sake
Of's Friends (what ere they were) resolved to take
Him from that barren rudeness, and transplant
So choice a Slip, where he might know no want
Of Education; with some labor, I
Having obtaind him, til virility,
Rendered him fit for nobler Action, stayed
Him always with me, when, my Love obayed
His Reason, and, then in the quest of what
Confined Domestics do but stumble at
Exotic knowledge, with this noble Youth,
To whom his Love grew linckt, like spotless truth,
To perfect Virtue, sent him to pursue
His wished design, from whence this interview,
First took its fatal Rise, and here the Lord
That a more full discov'ry might afford
Them yet more wonder, shows the Jewel to
Sparta's pleased Prince, at whoes most serious view,
The skilfulst Lapidaries judging it,
Both for its worth and beauty only fit
To sparkle in the glorious Cabinet
Of some great Queen, such value on it set,
That all conclude the honor on'^ must be,
Some falling Star in the Night of Royalty,
From Honors sphere, the Glories of a Crown,
To vaunt (the center of our Fears) dropped down.
And now the Court, whose brightest splendour in
These fatal Changes, long eclipsed had been,
Resumes its luster, which to elevate,
With all the pleasures of a prosperous state,
For that contracted span of time designed,
For the Princes stay, Fancies are wrackt to find
New forms of Mirth, such, whose Invention might
Inform the Ear, whilst they the Eye delight.
All which, whilst to the less concernd they lent
A flux of joy, yet lost their first intent,
To please the Princess, who from mirth did move
Excentrical, since first iufl^m'd with Love,
Which did soon from Fancies Embrion grow,
A large limbd Tyrant, when prepared to go,
She sees Argalia, who engaged to attend
The Ambassadors, here soon had put an end
To what, even from, those unto Love unkind,
Must now force tears ere it a period find.
That time expired, ordaind to terminate
Her Fathers stay, and so that splendid state,
That yet adornd the Princess Court, to show,
How much he did for's Frontiers safety ow,
Unto those moving Cittadels, a Fleet
His Mandates calls each Squadron for to meet
Within Lepanto, in whose harborous Lay,
Those Ships that were ordaind for a Convay
To the Calabrians Messengers, who now
With all that Love, or Honor could allow
To noble strangers, being attended by
The brightest Glorys of two Courts, draw nigh
A royal Fleet, whose glittering streamers lent
Dull Waves the beauties of a Firmament:
Amongst which numbers, one, too stately far
For rough Encounters of defacing War,
Whose gilded Masts their crimson Sails had spread
In silken Flakes, advanced her stately head,
High as where Clouds condense, where a Light stands,
Took for a Comet by far distant Lands,
For Cabbins where the imprisond Passenger
Wants Air to breath, she is stored with Rooms that were
So fair without, and yet so large within,
A Persian Sophy might have reveld in
Their spacious bulks. To this Molarchus, he
Whom greatness joynd to known Ability,
Had made Sicillia's Admiral, invights
The Royal Train, where with what ere delights,
(Although Invention all her stock had spent)
Could be upon that liquid Element,
Prepared their welcome, whilst at every Bowl
A Health inters, the ful-mouthd Cannons trowl
A Peal of Thunder, which in white Waves drowned
The softer Trumpets do their Dirges sound.
Now in the full Carier of Mirth, whilst all
Their thoughts in Perpendiculars did fall
From Honors Zenith; none incurvated
With common Cares, Parents that might have bred
A sly suspicion, whilst neglective Mirth
Keeps all within from their deep bed of Earth
Molarchus hoist his Anchors, whilst that all
The rest lay still, expecting when his call
Commands their Service, but when they beheld,
His spread Sails with a nimble Gale were sweld:
An oppressed Slave, which lay at rest before,
Was with stretched Limbs tugging his Finny ore;
Conceiving it but done, to show the Prince
That Galleys swiftness, let that thought convince
Fears weak suggestions, and invited by
Their tempting Mirth, still safe at Anchor ly.
But now, when they not only saw the Night
Draw sadly on, but what did more afright
Their loyal Souls, the distant Vessel by
Doubling a Cape loft to the sharpest Ey,
For hateful treason, taxing their mistake,
With Anchors cut, and Sails spread wide they make
The lasht Waves roar, whilst those enclosed within
The Gally, by her unkown speed had bin
Far more deceived, being so far conveyed,
Ere care arrives to tell them they are betrayed
Through Mirths neglective Guards, who now in have
With anger raised, in vain those flames did wast
In wild Attempts, to force a passage to
The open Decks, whither, before withdrew
Molarchus was, who now prepared to give
That treason birth, whose hated Name must live
In bloody Lines of Infamy, before
They could expect it, opening wide the door
That led them forth, the noble Captives fly
To seek revenge, but being encounterd by
An Armed Crew, so fierce a fight begin,
That Nights black Mantle nere was lined within,
With ought more horrid; in which bloody Fray,
The subtle Traitor valiant to betray,
Though Abject else unnoted, seizing on
The unguarded Princess from their rage is gone,
Through Nights black Mask, with that rich Prize into
A Boat that placed, for that design was drew
Near to the Gally, whose best Wealth being now
Thus made their own, no more they study how
To save the rest, all which for death designed,
The conquered Rebels soon their safety find,
From other Boats, but first, that all but she,
Oth' royal train secured by death might be,
So large a Leak in the brave Vessel make,
That thence her Womb soon too much weight did take
For her vast bulk to weild, which sinking now,
No safety to her royal Guests allow.
The Ship thus lost, and now no Throne but Waves,
Left the Sicilian Prince, just Heaven thus saves
His sacred Person, amongst those that sought
For timely safety, nimble strength had brought
Argalia, and his following Friend so near,
One of the Boats, in which (secured from fear)
The Rebels saild, that now they both had took
A Hold so sure, that though their Foes forsook
Their Oars to hinder't, spite of all their force,
Argalia enters, which a sad divorce
From Life, as he by strength attempts to rise,
From falling wounds, unhappily denies
The valiant Aphron, who by death betrayed
From time, and strength, had now left none to aid
His Friend, but those attending Virtues, that
Never more then now, for the world to wonder at,
Brave Trophies built; with such a sudden rage,
As all his Foes did to defense engage,
Those bolder Souls that durst resist, he had
From their disorderd Robes of flesh unclad,
Which horrid sight froc'd the more fearful to
Such swift submission, that ere fear out-grew
His hope, assisted by that strength which bought
Their Lives reprieve, their Oars reverst had brought
Him back to the place, in which the guilty flood,
Was staind with fair Sicillias noblest blood.
Assisted by those silver streams of Light,
The full faced Moon shot through the swarthy Night,
On the smooth Sea, he first his course directs,
Toward one, whose Robes studded with Jems, reflects
Those feeble Rays, like new fallen Stars, he there
Finds Sparta's Prince, then sinking from the sphere
Of mortal greatness in the boundless deep,
To calm Life's cares in an eternal sleep,
From unexpected death, the Graves most grim
And ghastly Tyrant, having rescued him
With as much sp^ed, as griefs distractions joynd
To Nights confusion, could give leave to find
More Friends before that all were swallowd by
The Sea he hasts, when being by chance brought nigh
Dead Aphrons Father, to be Partner in
Their carer, who as they only saved had bin
To mourn the rest, he from the rude Sea saves
Him, to be drowned in sorrows sable Waves.
Now in the Quest of that deserving Lord,
Whose goodness did to's Infancy afford,
Life's best of Comforts, Education, he
To bawk that needless diligence might see,
At one large draught the wide Waves swallow all,
Who vainly did till that sad minute call
To Heaven for help, which dismal sight beheld
By those that saved by accident, expeld
Their own just fears, for them to entertain,
As just a grief, their needful time in vain
They spend, no longer in their search, but though
Unweildy grief, yet made their motion slow,
Have from that horrid place, where each must leave
Such valued friends; numbers that did receive
Their blood descended to Nobility,
From the royal Spring, here the grieved Prince might se^
Interd in the Ocean the Epirote Lord,
His late found Son, whom Love could scarce afford
A minutes absence; nor's Argalia less
Engaged to grief to leave, whom the distress
Of's Youth relieved, but what from each of these
Borrowed some streams of sorrow to apease,
A grief which since so many Floods has cost,
The noble Aminander here was lost.
Rowed with such speed, as their desire joynd to
That fear which from the conquered Rebels drew
A swift obedience, being conducted by
A friendly Light, their Boat is now drawn nigh
A rocky Island, in whose Harbor they
Found where the Boat that had out-sayld them lay,
Drawn near the shore, but all the Passengers
Being gone, the sight of that alone confers
No other comfort, then to inform them that
The ravished Princess had been landed at
That Port, which by their Sailors they are told
Belongs unto a Castle, kept to hold
That Island, though but one unnoted Town,
To the scarce known Laws of the Sicillian Crown.
This heard by the Prince, who formerly had known
That Castles strength being vexed (although his own)
That now 'twas such, leaving the Vessel they
Protected by Nights heaviest shades, convey
Themselves into a neighboring Cottage, where
The Prince, who now externally did bear
No forms of greatness, lest to his repose,
Argalia whilst Nights shadows yet did close
Discovering Eyes, have back to the Harbor, whence
To give the royal Fleet Intelligence,
Oth' Kings distress, he sends forth all but One,
Whose stoutness had best made his Valor known,
Of those which conquered by his Sword, are now
By bounty made too much his own, to allow
Even flight suspicion room; This being done,
That Valor though with Love 'twere wingd, might run
On no rash Precipice, assisted by
That skilful Seaman, from some Ships that ly
Neglected, 'cause by time decayed, he takes
So much oth' Tackling, as of that he makes
Ladders of length, sufficient to ascend
The Castle Walls, which having to defend
Them naught but slave security, is done
With so much ease, that what is so well begun,
They boldly second, and first entering in
A Tower, which had by the prudent Founder bin
Built to command the Havens Mouth, which lay
Too low for the Castle, where when come, all they
Found to resist, is one poor Centry bound,
In sleep, which soon by death is made more sound.
To lodge the Prince in that safe place, before
His active valor yet attempted more:
The Gates secured that led to the Castle, he
Protected by that Nights obscurity,
By a conceald small Salliport is to
Its strength soon brought; when now prepared to view
More dreadful dangers, in such habit clad,
As by the out-Guards easy Error had
Soon as a Soldier gave him entrance, come
To the Hall he is, there being informd by some,
Oth' drousie Guards, where his pretended speed
Might find Molarchus, to perform a deed,
That future Ages, if that Honors fire
Lose not its light, shall worthily admire
His Valors have; within a room whose pride,
Of Art (though great) was far more glorified,
By that bright Luster, the Spectators saw
Through Sorrows Clouds in fair Pharonnida,
He finds the impious Villain heightend in
His late success, to such rude acts of sin,
That servile baseness, the low distance whence
He used to look, grew saucy Impudence.
Inflamed Argalia, who at once beholds
Objects to which the Sold enlarged, unfolds
Its passions in the various Characters
Of Love and Anger, now no more defers
The ex^cution of his rage, but in
So swift a death, as if his hand had been
Guided by Lightning, to Molarchus sent
His Life's discharge, which with astonishment,
Great, as if by their evil Angels, all
Their sins had been displayed, did wildly fall
Upon his Followers, whom ere have could save,
Or strength resist, Argalia's Sword had gave
Such sudden deaths, that whilst Amazements reignd,
Ere all he from the heedless tumult gaind,
That glorious Prize, the royal Lady, who
In all assaults of fears, not lost unto
Her own clear Judgment, as a blessing sent
From Heaven, whilst her base Foes Confusion lent
That Action safety, follows that brave Friend,
Whose Sword redeemd her, till her Journeys end
Through threatening dangers, brought her to that place.
Where with such passion, as kind Wives embrace
Husbands returned from bondage, she is by
Her Father welcomed into liberty.
Thus rescued, whilst exalted tumors sweld
To such Confusion, as from sense expeld
Reasons safe Conduct, whilst each Soldier leaves
His former Charge, fears pale disease receives
This Paroxisme; the Fleet, which yet had in
A doubtful Quest of their surpised Prince bin
Directed hither with the newborn day,
Their streamers round the Citadel display,
Which seen by them, that being deluded by
The dead Molarchus, to his treachery,
Had joynd their strength, guilt, the Original
Of shame, did to defend the platform Call
Their bold endeavor, but, when fidning it
Too strongly manned for undermineing wit,
Or open strength to force, dispairing to
Be long secure, prompted by fear they threw
Themselves on Mercy, which calm Grace among
Heavens other blessings, whilst it leads along,
The Prince toward Victory made his Conquest seen,
Such as came not to punish, but redeem.
The end of the fourth Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The first Book. CANTO THE FIFTH.
The ARGUMENT.
IX.
The grateful Prince, to show how much he loved
This noble Youth, whoes Merits just reward,
Too great for less Abilities had proved,
Makes him Commander of his Daughters Guard.
X.
Where seated in the most benign Aspect,
Kind Love could grant to fair Pharonnida,
A sacred Vision does her hopes detect,
Whose waking joys his absence does withdraw.
FReed from those dangers, which this bold attempt
Made justly feared, whilst joy did yet exempt
Those cares, which when by time concocted shall,
His Kingdom to a general Mourning call,
Sparta's pleased Prince, with all the Attributes
Ere Gratitude learnd from Desert, salutes
That noble Youth, which even when hope was spent,
Kind Heaven had made his safeties Instrument,
By acts of such heroic Virtue, that
Whilst all the less concernd are wondering at
The grateful Prince, in all the noble ways
Of honor lasting, as his life repaies,
By whose example the fair Princess taught
To shadow Love (her Souls most perfect draught)
In friendships Vail, so free a welcome gave
The worthy stranger, that al, prayer durst crave,
Though sacrificed in Zeals most perfect fire,
Seemd now from Heaven dropped on his pleased desire.
Some days spent here, whilst Justice vainly sought,
That Treasons root, whose base production brought,
Unto an unexpected Period in
Molarchus death with him had buried bin,
To future knowledge, all confessions, though
In torments they extracted were, bestow
Upon their knowledge, being the imperfect shade
Of supposition, which too weak to invade
Even those, whose doubtful Loyalty looked dim,
The prudent Prince, burying mistrust with him,
Leaving the Island, with his triumphant Fleet,
On the Sicillian shore, prepars to meet
That Joy in triumph which a blessing brought,
His loyal Subjects with their prayers had sought,
To cure those hot distemperatures, which in
His absence had the Courts Quotidian bin,
The Princess guard (as being an honor due,
To noble Valor) having left unto
That worthy stranger, whose victorious hand
Declared a Soul created for command,
The Prince departs from his loud Daughters Court,
To joyful Corinth, where, though the resort
Of such as by their service strove to express,
An uncorrupted Loyalty, made less,
That Mourning, which the Kingdoms general Loss,
Claimed from all hearts, yet like a sable Cross,
Which amongst Trophy's noble Conquerors bear,
All did some signs oth' public sorrrow wear.
But leaving these to rectify that State,
This Fever shook, return, to whom we late
Left gently calmed, that happy pair, which in
Desire (the shady Porch of Love) begin
That lasting progress, which ere ended shall,
So often their Fate to strong assistance call.
Some Months in happy free delights, before
Passion got strength enough to dictate more,
Then Reason could, right fair they would spent, in which
Slumber of Fancy, popular Love grown rich,
Soon becomes factious, and engages all
The powers of Nature to procure the fall,
Of the Souls lawful Sovereign; either in
Each Action of the others did begin
To place an Adoration, she does see
What ere he does, as shining Majesty
Beneath a Cloud, or Books, where Heaven transfers
Their Oracles in unknown Characters.
Like Gold yet unrefin'd, or the Adamant,
Wrapped up in earth, he only seemd to want
Knowledge of Worth. Her Actions in his fight
Appear like fires feigned Element, with light,
But not destruction armed; like the fair Sun,
When through a crystal Aqueduct he'th run,
His piercing Beams, until grown temperate by
That cooling Medium, through humility,
Shun her Majestic worth; in eithers Eyes,
The other seemd to wear such a disguise
As Poets cloathd their wandering Gods in, when
In forms disguised they here converst with men.
But long this conflict of their Passions ere
Resisted lasts not, when disdaind to bear
Those leaden Fetters, the great Princess tries
To quench that fire in the Embrio, ere it rise
To unresisted blazes, but in vain,
What her tears smoother are by sighs again,
Blown into flames, such as, since not to be
By ought extinguished, her sweet modesty
Strives to conceal, nor did them more betray,
Then by such Fugitives as stole away,
Through her fair Eyes, those Salliports of Love
From her besieged heart, now like to prove,
Had not her Honor called the Act unjust,
So feeble to betray her Souls best trust,
Her flames being not such, as each vulgar breast,
Feels in the fires of Fancy, when oppressed,
With gloomy discontents, her bright stars sat
Enthroned so high, that like the Bays of Fate,
It stopped the Current of the stream, and to
The Sea of Honor, Loves fresh Rivers drew.
Thus whilst the royal Eaglet does in the high
Sublimer Region of bright Majesty,
Upon Affections Wings, still hover, yet,
Loath to descend, on the humble earth does sit,
Her worthy Lover, like that amorous Vine,
When crawling over the Weeds, it strives to twine
Embraces with the Elm, he stands, whilst she
Desires to bend, but like that lovesick Tree,
By greatness is denied; he that nere knew,
A swelling tumor of conceit, nor flew
Upon the waxen Wings of vain Ambition,
A thought above his own obscure Condition,
Thinks that the Princess by her large respect,
Conferd on him, but kindly does reflect
Her Fathers beams, and with a reverend zeal,
Sees those descending Rays that did reveal
Loves Embassies transported on the quick
Wings of that heart-o're-coming Rhetoric,
Instructing that the weakness of his Eye,
Dazzled with beams of shining Majesty,
Might for too boldly gazing on a sight,
So full of glory, be deprived of light,
Stifling his Fancy, till it turned the Air,
That fand his heart to flames, which pale despair,
Chil'd into I^e soon; as he went about
With them to breath a storm of passions out.
But vain are all these fears, his Eagle sight,
Is born to gaze upon no lesser Light,
Then that from whence, all other beauties in
The same sphere borrow theirs, he else had bin,
Degenerate from that royal Airce, whence
He first did spring, although he fell from thence
Unfledged, the growing Pinnions of his Fame,
Wanting the purple tincture of his Name,
And Titles (both unknown) yet shall be fly,
On his own Merits strength, a pitch as high
Though not so boldly claimd, and such as shall
Inhance the blessing, when the dull mists fall
From truths benighted Eyes, whispering in
His Souls pleased Ear, her passion did begin,
Whilst all the Constellations of her Fate,
Fixed in the Zenith of bright honor sat,
Whilst his (deprest by adverse Fortune) in
Their Nader lay (even to his hopes) unseen.
Whilst thus Enthean fire did lie conceald,
With different Curtains, least by being reveald,
Cross Fate, which could not quench it, should to death
Scorch all their hopes, burnd in the angry breath
Of her incensed Father, whilst the fair
Pharonnida was striving to repair
The wakeful ruins of the day, within
Her Bed, whose Down of late by Love had been
Converted into Thorns, she having paid
The restless tribute of her sorrow, stayed
To breath a while in broken slumbers, such
As with short blasts cool feverish brains, but much
More was in hers, a strong Prophetic dream,
Divering by Enigmaes Natures stream,
Long hovering through the Portals of her mind,
On vain fantastic Wings, at length did find
The glimerings of obstructed reason, by
A brighter beam of pure divinity,
Led into supernatural light, whose Rays,
As much transcended reasons, as the days
Dull mortal fires, faith apprehends to be
Beneath the glimerings of divinity.
Her unimprisond Soul disrobed of all
Terrestial thoughts, like its Original,
In Heaven pure, and Immaculate, a fit
Companion did for those bright Angels sit,
Which the Gods made their Messengers to bear
This sacred truth: seeming transported where,
Fixed in the flaming Center of the world,
The heart oth' Mycrocosme, 'bout which is hurld
The spangl'd Curtains of the Sky, within
Whose boundless Orbs, the circling Planets spin
Those threads of time, upon whose strength rely
The pondrous Burdens of mortality;
An Adamantine World she sees, more pure,
More glorious far then this, framed to endure
The shock of Dooms-daies Darts, in which remains
The better Angels of what earth contains,
Placed there to govern all our Acts, and be
A Medium 'twixt us and Eternity.
Hence Nature from a Laberinth, half above,
Half underneath, that sympathetick Love
Which warms the World, to Generation sends,
On unseen Atoms, each small star attends
Here for his Message, which received is by
Their influence to the Astral Faculty,
That lurks on earth communicated; hence
Informing Forma sends Intelligence,
To the material principles of earth,
Her upper Garments, Natures second birth.
Upon each side of this large Frame, a Gate
Of different use was placed, at one there sat
A sprightly youth, whose Angels form delights,
Eyes dimmed with age, whose blandishments invights
Infants in the Womb to court their woe, and be
By his false shape tempted to misery.
Millions of thousands swarm about him, though
Diseases do each minute strive to throw
Them from his presence, since being tempted by
His flattering form, all court it, though they ly
On beds of thorns to look on it, saving some
More wretched Malcontents, that hither come,
With Souls so sullen, that whilst time invights
Them to his Joys, they shun those smooth delights.
This, the Worlds Favorite, had a younger Brother.
Of different hue, each more unlike the other,
Then opposite Aspects Antipathy
Within their breasts, though they were forced to be
Almost inseparable dwelt: this Fiend
A passage guarded, which at the other end
Oth' spacious Structure stood, betwixt each Gate
Was placed a Laberinth, in whose Angles sat
The vanities of Life, attempting to
Stay deaths pale Harbengers, but that black Cle^,
Times dusty Girdle, Fates Arithmetic,
Griefs slow paced Snail, Joys more then Eagle quick,
That Chain whose Links composed of hours and days,
Thither at length spite of delay conveys
The slow paced steps of time; there always stood
Near him one of the triple Sisterhood,
Who with deformity in love, did send
Him troops of Servants, hourly to attend
Upon his harsh Commands, which he from all
Society of flesh, without the Wall,
Down a dark Hill conveyed, at whose foot stood
An ugly L^ke, black as that horrid flood,
Gods made by men did fear, Myriads of Boats,
On the dark surface of the water floats,
Containing Passengers, whose different hue,
Tell them that from the Walls do trembling view
Their course, that there is no age of man to be
Exempted from that powerful tyrany.
A Tide which nere shall know reflux, beyond
The baleful stream, unto a gloomy strond,
Circl'd with black obscurity, conveys
Each passenger, where their torn Chain of days,
Is in Eternity pe^ckt up: between
These different Gates, the Princess having seen
Life's various Sceans wrought to a method by
Disposing Angels, on a Rock more high
Then Natures common surface, she beholds
The Mansion house of Fate, which thus unfolds
Its sacred Mysteries, A trine within
A quadrate placed, both those incompast in
A perfect Circle was its form, but what
Its matter was, for us to wonder at,
Is undiscoverd left; a Tower there stands
At every Angle, where times fatal hands
The impartial Par^ae dwell, in the first she sees
Clothe, the kindest of the Destinies,
From immaterial Essences to cull
The seeds of life, and of them frame the Wool,
For Lachesi^ to spin, about her fly
Myriades of Souls, that yet want flesh to lie
Warmd with their Functions in, whose strength bestows
That power by which man ripe for misery grows.
Her next of Objects was that glorious Tower,
Where that swift fingerd Nymph that spares no hour
From mortals service, draws the various threads
Of life in several lengths; to weary beds
Of age, extending some, whilst others in
Their Infancy are broke, some blackt in sin,
Others (the Favorites of Heaven) from whence
Their Origin, candid with Innocence:
Some purpl'd in afflictions, others died
In sanguine pleasures; some in glittering pride,
Spun to adorn the Earth, whilst others wear
Rags of Deformity; but knots of care
No thread was wholly freed from. Next to this
Fair glorious Tower was placed that black Abbyss
Of dreadful Atropos, the bale full seat
Of death and horror, in each room replear,
With lazy damps, loud groans, and the sad sight
Of pale, grim Ghosts, those Terrors of the Night:
To this (the last stage) that the winding Clew
Of life can lead mortality unto;
Fear was the dreadful Porter, which let in
All Guests sent thither by destructive sin.
As its firm Basis, on all these depends
A lofty Piramid, to which each sends
Some Gift from Natures treasury to Fames
Uncertain hand, the hollow room with Names,
And empty sounds was only filled, of those,
For whom the Destinies daind to compose
Their fairest threads; as if but born to die,
Here all Ephem'raes of report did fly,
On feeble Wings, till being like to fall
Some faintly stick upon the slimy Wall,
Till the observant Antiquary rents,
Them thence to live in paper Monuments,
In whose Records they are preserved to be,
The various censures of posterity.
In The upper Room, as Favorites to Fate,
There only Poets (rich in Fancy) sat,
In that beneath, Historians, whose Records,
Do Theams unto those pregnant Wits afford;
Yet both preparing everlasting Bays,
To crown their glorious dust, whose happy days
Were here spent well; beneath these covered over
With dim oblivions shadows, Myriads more,
Till Doomsday shall the gaudy World undress,
Lay huddl'd up in dark forgetfulness:
All which (as Objects not of worth to cast
A fixed Eye on) the Princess Genius past,
In heedless have, until obstructed by
Visions, that thus fixed her Souls wandering Ey.
A Light as great, as if that Dooms-daies flame
Were for a Lamp hung in the Court of Fame:
Directs her, where on a bright Throne there sat
Sicillia's better Genius: her proud state,
(Courted by all Earths greatest Monarchs) by
Three valiant Knights supported was, whose high
Merits disdaining a Reward, less great,
With equal hopes aimed at the royal Seat,
Which since all could not gain, betwixt her three
Fair Daughters both her Crown and Dignity
Is equally bestowed, by giving one
To each of them; when the divided Throne,
Had on each Angle fixed a Diadem,
Her Vision thus proceeds; the royal Stem,
That bore her Fathers Crown, to view first brings
Its golden Fruit, a glorious Race of Kings,
Led by the Founder of their Fame, their Rear
Brought by her Father up: next those that bear,
Epirus honored Arms, the royal train
Concluding in Zoranza: this linkt Chain
Drawn to an end, the Princes that had swayed
Argalia's Scepter, fill the Scean till stayed
By the Epirots Sword, their conquered Crown,
From aged Gelons hoaty head dropped down,
At fierce Zoranza's feet; this she beholds
With admiration, whilst hid truth unfolds
It self in plainer objects, the distressed
Actolian Prince again appears, but dressed
In a poor Pilgrims Weed, in's hand he leads
A lovely Boy, in whose sweet look she reads
Soft pitties Lectures, but whilst gazing on
This Act till lost in admiration,
By sudden Fate he seemd transformd, to what
She last beheld him, only offering at
Loves Shrine his heart to her Idea; there
Joy had bereaved her slumbers, had not fear
Clouded the glorious Dream, a dreadful mist,
Black as the steams of Hell, seeming to twist
Its ugly vapors, into shades more thick
Then Night ingendring Damps, had with a quick
But horrid darkness veiled the Room, to augment
Whose terror a Clouds sulphry bosom rent,
With dreadful thunderclaps, darting a bright
But fearful blaze through the artificial Night,
Lent her so much use of her Eyes to see
Argalia grovelling in his blood, which she
Had scarce beheld, ere the malignant flame
Vanished again she shrieks, and on his Name
Does passionatly call, but here is no sound
Startles her Ear, but hollow groans, which drowned
Her Soul in a cold sweat of fears, which ended,
A second blaze lends her its light, attended
With Objects, whose wild horror did present
Her Fathers Ghost then seeming to lament,
Her injured Honor, in his Company,
Thd slain Laconians Spirit, which let free
From the dark Prison of the cold Grave, where
In rusty Chains he lay, was come to bear
Her to that sad Abode, but as she now
Appeard to sink, a golden Cloud did bow
From Heavens fair Arch, in which Argalia seemd,
Clad in bright Armor fitting, who redeemd
Her from approaching danger, which being done,
The darkness vanished, and a glorious Sun
Of welcome Light displayed its beams, by which
A Throne the first resembling, but more rich
In its united Glory to the eye,
Presents its luster, where in Majesty
The Angels that attend their better Fate,
P^ac'd her, and brave Argalia, in which state
The un-bard portals of her Soul, let fly
The golden slumber, whose dear memory,
Shall live within her noble thoughts, until
Treading over all obstructions, Fate fulfill
These dark predictions, whose obscurity,
Must often first her Souls afflictions be.
When now the Mornings dews, that cool allay,
Which cures the Fevers of the intemperate day,
Were rarifi'd to Air, the Princess to
Improve her joy in private thoughts, withdrew
From burdensome society within
A silent Groves cool shadows, what had been
Her Midnights joy to recollect, in which
Delightful task, whilst Memory did enrich
The robes of Fancy, to divert the stream
Of thoughts, intentive only on her Dream.
Argalia enters with a speed, that showed
He unto some supreme Commander owed
That diligence, but when arrived so near
As to behold, stopped with a reverend fear,
Least this intrusion on her Privacies,
Might ruffle Passion, which now floating lies
In a calm stream of thoughts, he stays, till she
By her Comm^nds gave fresh activity
To his desires, then with a lowly grace,
Yet such, to which Prides haughty Sons gave place,
For Native sweetness, he on's knee presents
A Packet from her Father, whose Contents,
If Love can groan beneath a greater Curse,
Then Desperation, made her sufferings worse
Then fear could represent them, 'twas expressed
In Language that not wholly did request,
Nor yet command consent; only declare,
His royal Will, and the paternal Care
He bore his Kingdoms safety, which could be
By naught confirmed, more then Afinity,
With the Laconian Prince, whose big fame stood
Exalted in a spacious Sea of blood,
On Honors highest Pyramid; his hand
Had made the triple headed spot of Land,
One of her stately Promontories bow,
Beneath his Sword, and with his Scepter now,
He at the other reaches, which, if Love
But gently smile on's newborn hopes, and prove
Propitious as the God of War, his Fate
C^imbs equal with his wishes, but too late,
That slow-paced Soldier bent his Forces to
Storm that fair Virgin Cittadell, which knew
Ere his pretenses could a Parlee call,
Beneath what force that royal Fort must fall.
Enclosed within this rough Lords Le^ters ^he
Received his Picture, which informed her be
Wanted dissimulation (that worst part
O^ Courtship (^o put Complements of Art
On his Effigies; his stern Brow far more
Glorying in the Scars, then in the Crown he wore:
His active Youth made him Retainer to
The Court of Mars, something too long to sue
For entrance into Love's, like Mornings clad
In griesl'd Frosts, ere plump-cheek'd Autumn had
Sh^rn the Glebs golden Locks, some silver hairs
Mixed with his black appeard; his Age dispairs
Not of a hopeful Heir, nor could his Youth
Promise much more, the venerable truth
Of glorious Victories, that stuck his Name
For Ornament in the Frontispiece of Fame,
Together with his Native greatness were,
His Orators to plead for Love, but where
Youth, Beauty, Valor, and a Soul as brave,
Though not known great as his, before had gave
Loves pleasing wounds; Fortunes neglected gain,
In fresh assaults, but spends her strength in vain.
With as much ease as Souls, when ripened by
A wel-spent life, have to eternity.
She had sustaind this harsh encounter, though
Backed with her Fathers threats, did it not show
More dreadful yet, in a command which must
Call her Argalia, from his glorious trust,
Her Guardian to a separation in
An Embassy to him, whose hopes had been
Her new created fears, which sentence read
By the wise Lady, though her passions bred
A sudden tumult, yet her reason stays
The Torrent, till Argalia who obaies
The strictest limits of observance to
Her he adornd, being reverently withdrew,
Enlarged her sorrow in so loud a tone,
That ere he is through the winding Laberynth gone,
So far, but that he could distinctly hear
Her sad Complaints, they thus assault his Ear:
Unhappy Soul, born only to infuse
Pearls of delight with Vinegar, and lose
Content for Honor; it is a sin to be
Born high, that robs me of my liberty:
Or is it the curse of greatness to behold
Virtue through such false Optics as unfold
No splendour less, from equal Orbs they shine?
What Heaven made free, ambitious men confine,
In regular degrees: poor Love must dwell
Within no Climate, but what is parallel,
Unto our honored births; the envied Fare
Of Princes often these burdens find from state;
When lowly Swains knowing no Parents voice,
A Negative, make a free happy choice.
And here she sighed, then with some drops di^tild,
From Loves most sovereign Elixar filled
The crystal Fountains of her eyes, which ere
Dropped down, she thus recals again; but nere,
(Never my Argalia) shall these fears destroy
My hopes of thee, Heaven let me but enjoy
So much of all those blessings, which their Birth
Can take from frail Mortality, and Earth,
Contracting all her Curses cannot make
A storm of danger loud enough to shake
Me to a trembling Penitence, a Curse,
To make the horror of my sufferings worse,
Sent in a Fathers Name, like Vangeance fell
From angry Heaven, upon my head may dwell,
In an eternal stain; my honored Name
With pale disgrace may languish, busy Fame
My Reputation spot, Affection be
Termed uncommanded Lust, sharp poverty,
That Weed which kills the gentle Flower of Love,
As the result of all these Ills may prove
My greatest misery, unless to find
My self unpitied, yet not so unkind,
Would I esteem this mercenary Band,
As those far more malignant powers that stand
Armed with diswasions to obstruct the way,
Fancy directs, but let those Souls obey
Their harsh Commands, that stand in fear to shead
Repentant tears: I am resolved to tread
These doubtful paths, through all the shades of fear,
That now benights them. Love, with pity hear
Thy Suppliants Prayers, and when my clouded Eyes
Shall cease to weep, in Smiles I Will sacrifice
To thee such Offerings, that the utmost date
Of deaths rough hands shall never violate.
Whilst our fair Virgin-sufferer was in
This Agony, Argalia that had been
Attentive, as an envied Tyrant to
Suspected Counsels: from her Language drew
So much, that that pure essence which informs
His knowledge, shall in all the future storms
Of Fate protect him, from a fear that did
Far more then death afflict, whilst Love lay hid
In Honors upper Region, now whilst she
Calmly withdraws, to let her Comforts be
Hopes of's return, his latest view forsook
His Souls best comfort, who has now betook
Her self to private thoughts, where with what rest,
Love can admit, I leave her, and him blessed
In a most prosperous Voyage, but happier far
In being directed by so bright a Star.

CANTO THE FIRST.
The ARGUMENT.
I.
Still wakefull guilt, Almanzors Rebel sin,
Taking advantage of unguarded mirth,
Which now without mistrust did revell in,
The Princess Court gives thence new Treason birth.
II.
By treachery seized, and through Nights shades conveyed
She had for ever in this storm been lost,
Had not its rage by such rude hands been stayed,
That safety near as much as danger cost.
THese Hell-ingendred Embrioes, which had long
Lay hid within Almanzors breast, grown strong;
Now for delivery strives; Clandestine plots,
Ripened with Age and Lust, dissolve the knots,
Wherein his fear had fetterd them, and fly
Beyond the Circle of his Loyalty.
Since his deserts made him a stranger to
His Princess Court, he would lived like those that do
Fly that pursuing Vengeance, which attends
A Rebels Acts, seen only to such Friends,
Whose blemmisht Honor, suffering in his fall,
Assist his rising, though they venture all
By that unlawful Act, on paths that may
Precipitate to ruin; the dark way
Had long been sought for, Consultations did
Whisper Rebellion in soft Aires, forbid
To live in louder Language, until like
Inevitable thunder it could strike,
As swift, as secret, and as sure as those,
Heavens anger hu^ls through all that durst oppose.
In all the progress of that dark design,
Whose unseen Engines strove to undermine
That power (which since Heaven does in Kings infuse)
None but unhallowed Rebels durst abuse
Time (Treasons secret Midwife) did produce
No birth like this; such Friends as often use
Had taught him their Souls Characters he makes
Sharers of's guilt; but whilst he (troubled) takes
A care to fit each smaller Wheel unto
This fatal Engine, those black powers that do
Assist such dark designs, a moving spirit,
Supplies it with, although Almanzors merit
Purchased few friends, yet had his tempting Gold
Corrupted some, amongst which it surest hold
Upon Amphibia took, a Lady who
Before Florenza's sweeter virtues drew
Her Favor to a better Object, swayed,
The Princess choice Affections she betrayed
By glittering Charms, persuades her thoughts no deed
For guilt is branded, whose attempts may feed
Ambitions malice, and at one blow give
Envy and Avarice a hope to live
Pleased with their ruin, whose fair merits dwell
High in those thoughts, from whence she justly fell.
To rack revenge unto as large extent,
As hate could wish, what Hell could nere invent,
Without assistance of a female Wit,
Man's first Betrayer, all that seemd but fit
From Treasons close embrace to propagate
Revenge she lights him, what (though close as Fate,
When parling with the Destinies) is by
Her Counsel acted, swift as stories fly
From vulgar Tongues, her treachery makes known
To the bold Rebbel, whose intentions grown
Hence ripe for Action, when his secret guilt
A strong retreat had for rebellion built,
By laying the foundation on it, in those
Whom since by want, or envy made the Foes
To the public peace, are soon persuaded by
Their Princess fall, to cure that malady.
This platform laid, some whose wise valor he
By practice knew, adornd with secrecy,
Amongst the number of his guilty friends,
Selected in its first attempt, attends
Treasons dark walks, which now more secret by
Nights dismal shadows made, had brought them nigh
The Princess Palace, through the Hemisphears
Dark Curtain, now the big bulkt roof appears,
And dapl'd Windows showed their several light,
Like rich Enamel in the Jet of Night;
All rockt in sweet security they found,
By Fate false smiles, triumphant mirth had crowned
The glorious Train, whose height of joy could taste,
No poison of suspicion, each embraced
His free delights, yet feared, no Snake should lie
Lurking within those Flowers: amidst which high
Divine flames of enthean joy, to her
That levelled had their way, a Messenger
Makes known their near approach, for which before
She had prepared, and vaild the Pavement over
In thin, but candid Innocence; accursed
By all that ere knew Virtue: oh, how durst
Thy Envy turn these commick Sceans into
So red a Tragedy as must ensue,
Thy guilts Stenography, which thus writes Fate
In Characters of blood: but now too late
It Is to repent, when punishment wrought fair,
Shows thy foul Crimes, thou only may despair.
Leaving this Fiend to hatch her Vipers here,
Lets breath awhile, although in full carier,
Stay on the brow oth' precipice to view
The Cou^ts full joys, which being arrived unto
Their Zenith seemd to Fate-discerning Eyes,
Like Garlands were before a Sacrifice,
The Cornu Copiae from the Tables now,
Removed by full fed Rurals, did allow
Time for discourse, as much as modest mirth
Durst stretch her wings; crowned Cups gave lusty birth
To active sports. The hearts warm bounties flame
From lofty Piles, and in their pride became
The luster of the Roof; to glorify
Which yet imperfect Festival, the eye
That lent to this large body light divine,
Pharonnida, at whose adored Shrine,
These Sacrifices offered were, appears
Within the Hall, and with her presence clears
Each supercillious brow, if hopes to see
What Is now enjoyed, suffered such there to be.
The Princess on her honored Throne reposed,
A Fancy tempting, Music first unclos'd
The winding Portals of the Soul, which done,
Four Swains, whose time directed knowledge won
Attention with Credulity, by turn
Sicillia's Annals sung, and from the Urn
Of now almost forgotten truth did raise
Their Fame (those branches of eternal Baies.)
Which sober mirth, Preparatives unto
More active sports continuing, whilst the new
Model of Treason was disguizing in
A Mask ordaind to candie over their sin,
To gild those Pills of poison with delight,
And strew with Roses, deadly Aconite,
Was now drawn near an end, when from without
A murmuring noise of several sounds about
The Palace Gates was heard, which suddenly,
Dissolving to an antic harmony,
Proclaims their entrance, whose first solemn sight,
In dreadful shapes mixed terror with delight.
In the black front of that slow March appears,
A Train, whose difference both in Sex and years,
Had spoke confusion, if agreement in
Their Acclamation had no Prologue been.
A Dance where method in disorder lay,
Where each seemd out, though all their rules obey,
Was first in different measures trod, which done
Twelve armed Viragoes, whose strange habit won
More admiration then their beauty led,
As many captive Satyrs, in the head
Oth' Amazonian troop, a Matron by,
To younger Nymphs supported, till come nigh
Pharonnida's bright Throne, presents the rest
Her Issue, who externally expressed,
So many fair soul'd Virtues, born to be
Protectors of their Mother Chastity,
Who wants their help, although supported by
Her weaker daughters Fear, and Modesty.
Those obscean vices, whose rude hands betray
Natures deformities forced to obey,
Their brave opposing Virtues did appear
In The captive Satyrs, who, being now brought near
A dreadful Musick's heard without, whose sound
Did gentler Aires in their first births confound;
Which being a signal to that act of blood,
That soon ensues, whilst all expecting stood,
Some happier change, the false viragoes drew
Their Swords, and with a speedy fury slew
The struggling Knights, who thus disguised had bin,
With the more horror to be murtherd in
Their royal Mistress sight, whose shrieks did tell,
What trembling Guests within her breast did dwell.
Sudden and cruel was the Act, yet stands
Not Treason here, but whilst their purpl'd hands
Yet wreakt in blood, their guilty Souls to stain,
With blacket sins (her weak Defenders slain)
Rush toward the trembling Princess, who now lies
Betrayed by the Souls Janitors, her Eyes
To Passions insupportable, which grown
A burden to her Spirits, all were flown
To the Porch of death for rest: if Souls new fled
From tainted bodies that have surfeited,
On studied sins, could be discernd when they
Unarmd with penitence, are hurld away,
By long armd Fiends, less pale, less horrid would
Their guilty looks appear, confusion could
Not live in livelier emblem, each appears
To fly the danger, but about him bears
Its pale effects: so passengers forsake
A sinking Ship, such strong Convulsions shake
Surprised Forts, so Doomsdays Trumpet shall
Startle the unprepared world, when all
Her Attomes in their then worn Robes shall be
Ravished in flames to meet eternity.
The unguarded Princess being by all forsook,
But poor Florenza, both from thence are took,
Whilst neither in that horrid Agony,
Beheld their danger, and transported by
Almanzor to his Coach, which near attended,
On his assured success, who now befriended
With the protecting darkness hasts away,
Swift as desire with the fair trembling prey.
Those few opposing friends, whose will was more,
Then power to relieve her, over bore
By the victorious Rebbels, did in vain
Attempt her rescue, which since fruitless, slain,
Her Martyrs fall, leaving their lives to be,
An evidence of dying Loyalty.
Success attends thus far, but Fortune now
Left off to smile on Villainy, her brow
Contracted into frowns, she swiftly sent
This Countermand, her Followers having spent
Their own endeavors to no purpose raise,
In have the neighbourig Villages, nor stays
The swift Alarm, till it had out-fled
The speed Almanzor made; roused from his Bed,
And warm Embraces of his Wife, by those
Which had outrun the danger of their Foes:
The drousie Villager in trembling have,
Snatches such Arms as former fear had placed,
Fit to defend, with which whilst Hor^pies call
In tones more frantic then a bacchinal.
They stumble to their Rendesvouz, which none
But only by the louder cries had known.
This giddy multitude, which no command
Knew, but what rage did dictate, hovering stand,
Like big swollen Clouds drove by a doubtful wind,
Uncertain where to fall: one cries behind
The greatest danger lies; some like his choice,
And speedily retreat, until a voice
More powerful though from the like judgment sprung,
Persuades them on again; some madly rung
The jarring Bells, as far from harmony,
As their Opinions: all which disagree
About the place, whence the Alarum's come,
One cries the Princess Court, until struck dumb,
By a more terrifying Fool that swears
The next Port is surpised, towered which he stares,
To see the Beacons blaze, but is from far,
Deceived by the light of an ^scending star.
So many shapes bear their weak Fancies, that,
All would do something, but there is none knows what.
In this strange Medly of Confusion, they
That could command, want such as would obey,
To exercise their power; each thinks his own
Opinion best, so must perform't alone:
Or else remain, as hitherto they had,
Busy in doing nothing: in which mad
Fit of distracted fury, like to fight,
For want of Foes amongst themselves, the Night
(Grown gray with age) fore-shewd her death, when each
Thinking that now he would done enough to teach,
An active Soldier vigilance in spending
A Night abroad, which they will call defending
Their Prince and Country from a danger, but
What it was they know not, swearing't shall be put
In the next Chronicle, they disunite,
Their nere wel-joynted Forces, and a flight
Rather then march, to the several Hamlets take,
From whence at first, being scarce half awake,
Not so much cloathd, their heedless have had sent
Them, only noise and number to augment.
One troop of this disbanded Company,
Which, though but few, more then could well agree
To march together, by mistake being cast
Into a narrow straight, met as they past
The Coach that bore the Princess, being by those
That stole her guarded, the mad Rowt to oppose
Their farther passage, not because they thought
Them to be those their Ignorance had sought,
In their late meeting, the Antipathy
Twixt them and the Gentry, is enough to be
That quarrels Parent, whose event shall make
Their Prince and Country blessed in their mistake.
Startled from all his temperate joys with this
Unlookt for Remora in the Road of bliss,
Enraged Almanzor rows to ford the Flood
Oth' present danger, or with his own blood,
Augment the stream, with that he flies among,
Those that are nearest of the numerous throng,
Who, when they found what difference was between
Their Clubs (blunt as their Valor^) and the keen
Edge of his Sword would have fell back, but are
Forced on by those behind, who being far
From danger, fear it not. Thus some are forced
To fight, till their unwilling Souls divorced
From their cold Lodgings made their peace; but here
Whilst he a Conqu'ror reigns, ingenious fear,
Taught them that du^st no nearer come, to do
Most mischief at a distance, climbed unto
The Rocks inequitable Clifts: from thence
They shower down stones that equally dispense,
Danger amongst Friends and Foes; had she not been
Defended by her Coach, their Princess in
This storm had perished: or had fear of death
Unfixt her thoughts, she would spent that precious breath,
Now sacrificing in her prayers to be
From their wild rage deliverd safe, but she
(Oppressed with Lethargies of sorrow) lends
No ear to this rude fight, on which depends,
So much of Fate, danger appears to ly,
Not more in the disease, then remedy.
Whilst the opposed Almanzor now had near
Hewd forth his way through all of them, appear
More company by their loud clamors drew,
Unto their timely aid; now danger grew,
Horrid and threatening, till the impe^eous shower,
Wetting the Wings of the fierce Rebels power;
Clog all his hopes of flight, unless he leave,
His trembling prey behind him; to bereave
Him of his last of hopes, he sees his train
Begin to drop* with those that yet remain
He thinks it time, whilst undiscovered, to
Secure himself, which difficult to do;
At length (though not unwounded) he alone
Breaks through their Forces, blessed in being unknown:
Else had their batterd Weapons spared to shed
The blood of others, and had surfeited
On his, which adding knowledge to the fire
Of Rage, they had most reason to desire.
The unsuccesful Rebel thus secured,
By speedy flight, his train not long endured
The circling danger, which from each side sends,
Symptoms so deadly, all their strength de^ends
Not the rude torrent, nor their prayers could calm
Their Foes stern rage; sweet Mercies healing Balm
Is the extraction of brave Spirits, which
(By innate valor rarefied) enrich
With that fair Jem, the triumphs of success,
Whilst Cowards make the Victors glory less,
Their highest flame of rage being but dull earth,
Fired into tyranny, the spurious birth
Of a precedent fear, whose baseness knows
No calm, but what from others danger grows.
And now the field, scourd by the beastly rage
Oth' savage Clowns, had left no Foe to engage
A Life, nor could their policy persuade
Them to let one survive, till he had made
The Plot discoverd, with rude have they crush
Their trembling Souls out, and all Weapons blush,
In part of the b^o^d, so many bands had gave
Them hurt less Wounds, that the expecting Grave,
Needs only take their Bones, for madly they
Had mi^c'd their flesh for the Vultures easier prey.
This Victory gaind, they have to the Coach, and thence
The unknown Princess take, no large expense
Of prayers, pourd from Florenza's fears could be,
So powerful to obtain Civility.
She tells them who their rage prophanes, and by
Their Princess Name conjures them, but the high
Exalted outcries drown her voice, till one,
Who had the Rape of the sad Lady known,
When first performd, did with a louder voice
Proclaim her there, and having first made choice
Of a more civil Companvt' oppose
The uncivil Clowns, rescues her, and then shows,
How near their heedless rage had cast away
The glorious Prize of that victorious day.
From fainting slumbers raisd, the Princess now
Secure in their discovery, taught them how
To turn her Fury into Zeal, and show
By serving her, the Allegiance that they ow
Her royal Father. To the Palace come,
Rewarding all, she there commands that some
Stay for her Guard, but soon that Order grew
A troublesome obedience, none would to
His Cottage, whilst that any stayed within
The Palace Gates, but long they had not been
Thus burthensomly diligent, ere on
A new design, each struggles to be gone
From's former Charge; a Messenger is sought,
Who to the Court must post, but each one thought
Himself of most ability, so all
Or none must go, yet ere the difference fall
Into a near approaching quarrel, he
Who rescued her, the Princess chose to be
Her Messenger. Euriolus (for so
The Youth was called) disdaining to be slow,
Where such Commands gave Wings, with speed unto
The Court was come, but busy Fame out-flew
His eager have, and ere's Arrival spread
Some scatterd fragments of the news, which bred
Suspicion of that doubt full truth, from whence
His Message leads to doleful Confidence,
The end of the first Canto.

Fre^^ from suspicion by a Cause that tells
His injured Prince, Almanzors guilt exceed^
His great'st mistrust, from thence just anger swells,
Till for that Fever the whole Nation bleeds.
IV.
Armies united in a dreadful have,
From distant places sad Spectators bring,
To see by Fortune Justice so defaced,
The Subjects here pursue a Conquered King.
MOrea's prudent Prince, whose scars had bin
Before this Message, but like truths wrapped in
Dark Oracles; now, with a sense enlarged,
Beyond imperfect doubts, no longer charged
His Judgment with Dilemma's, but in all
The have indulgent Love, when by the call
Of danger frighted, could procure, without
Staying to let slow Counsel urge a doubt,
Which might but seem a Remora unto
His fixed desires, having together drew;
His Guard was marching; when, in such a have
As breathless speed fore-shewd they had been chased
By some approaching danger, such as were
Too full of truth, and loyalty to bear,
Rebellion longer, then their thoughts could be
Eased of the burden by discovery:
Arrive at the Court with this sad news, that by
Almanzor (who forgetting Loyalty)
Had seized Alcithiu's Castle, they were drove
To fly their Country, since that there he strove
To raise an Army, by whose strength he might,
To the Swords power subject the Scepters right,
By this sad news startled out of his late
Fixed resolutions, the vexed Prince whose Fate
Had not through all the progress of his Reign,
Darted so many Plagues to entertain
Them now with strength unballast, calls in have
His late neglected Counsel, and embraced
This sudden, but mature advice, that he
Should with such Forces as could soonest be
Prepared for service, having only seen
Pharonnida, possess that straight between
The Castle, and the Mountains, from whose rude
Inhabitants, which Nature did include
Within those Rocks, Rebellion soonest might
Grow to a dangerous tumor, the dim light
Of scarce discerned Majesty, so far
Being from them removed, that least a War,
Enforced him to command their aid, they nere
Heard of his Mandates, being more fit to bear
The weight of Armor on their bodies, then
Of Taxes on Estates, so small that when
With all the art of Industry improved,
For want were kept, but not for ease beloved.
Through paths that no Vestigia showed to these
As being retaind, or lost with greatest ease;
Since naturally unconstant, comes the King,
Not much too late, Majestic Rays did bring
Props to their wavering Faith that yet remaind
Unclad in lawless Arms, some being gaind
Unto Almanzor, whose revolt had brought
That freedom those, whose subtle plots long sought
For Innovations, wished; the sickly State
In sad Eruptions, such as future Fate,
From sacred truths, speaks deadly symptoms in
Relaxes, all that order which had been
Till now her Cement; the soft harmony
Of peaceful Contracts, sadly silenced by
That discord, in whose flames the Kingdom burnd,
Had all their Measures into Marches turned.
Throughout his Dominions speedy Orders flow,
For raising Troops; whilst with such have, as new
Shorn Meadows, when approaching storms are nigh,
Tired Laborers huddle up; both parties try
To levy Armies. The sad Scholar throws
His Books aside, and now in practice shows
His studied Theoricks; the stiff Labourer leaves
In The half-shorn fields the uncollected sheaves,
To female Taskers, and exchangd his hook
Into a Sword; each busy Trade that took
Pains in the nicer Ornaments of peace,
Sit idle till Want forced them to increase
The new raisd Troops; that Ornament oth' Hall,
Old Armours, which had nothing but a Wall
Of long time saved from the invading dust,
From Cobwebs swept, though its Enamel rust
Stick close, and on the unpractic'd Soldier put,
Forth of their breasts, nor fear, nor danger shut.
Yet with an Army of this temper in
Have huddl'd up, the wandering Prince had been
Enforced to fight, had not his just Cause brought
Some loyal Gentry, such, whose Virtue sought
Truth for reward, unto his side, with which
He now advances more completely rich,
In noble Valor, then is rebellious Foes,
In numerous Troops; no Enemies oppose
His speedy March, till being now come near
Alcithius Fort, Almanzors timely fear,
Hurries him thence; his better Fate depends
On larger hopes; unto such constant friends,
As equal guilt by sympathy secured,
To him he leaves the Castle, and assured
Them of relief, with what convenient speed,
Those of his Faction (which did only need
His presence to confirm rebellion by,
An injured power) could draw their Armies nigh.
As hence he marches, each succesful hour
Augments his strength, till the unlawful power,
Trebl'd his injured Princes; but as they
Who carry guilt about them, do betray
Her by her Sister fear, so these whose Crimes
D^tected, durst not, in more peaceful times,
Look Justice in the face, and therefore now
Stood veiled in Arms against her, fearing how
She might prevail against power, march not till
A greater strength their empty bosoms fill
With hope, a tumor which does often dilate
The narrow Souls of Cowords, till their Fare
Flatter them into ruin, then forsakes
Them in an Earthquake, whose pale terror shakes
Base Souls to flight, whilst noble valor dies,
Adorned with Wounds, Fames bleeding Sacrifice.
Almanzors doubtful Army, since that here
The threatening storm at distance did appear,
Locked in a Calm, possessed with confidence,
Slowly their Squadrons move, but had from thence
Not a days journey marched, before the sad
News of Alcithiu's desperate danger had
Pal'd over their Camp, which whilst the Leaders strove
To anim^te, Almanzor faster drove
On those designs, which (prospering) might prevent
It from surrender, but the time was spent
Too far before. The Governor that kept
It now, against his Prince too long had slept,
In the preceding down of peace, to be
Awakn'd into valor, only he
Had seen't kept clean from Cobwebs, and perhaps
The Guns shot off, when those loud thunderclaps
Proclaimed a storm of healths; yet till he saw
The threatening danger circularly draw
An armed Line about him, in as high
A voice as valor, could a Foe defy,
He clothes his fears, which shook the false disguise
Off with the first assault, and swiftly flies
To's Princes mercy, whose pleased Soul he found
Heightened, to have his first attempt thus crowned
With Victory, which nere made his Army less,
Nor steept in blood, though travaild to success.
To this new Conquest, as a place whose strength,
He best might trust, if to a tedious length,
Or black Misfortune, the ensuing War,
His Fate should spin, his choicest treasures are,
Together with her, in whose safety he,
Placed Life it self, brought for security.
This done, that now no slow delays might look
Like fear, he with his loyal Army took
The field, in which he would scarce a Level chose,
To rallie's Army, ere his numerous Foes,
Appear on the tops of the adjacent Hill,
Like Clouds, which when presaging storms, do fill
Dark Southern Regions: In a plain that lay
So near, that both the Armies full survay,
Might from the Clifts, on which Alcithius stands,
Be safely viewd, were the rebellious bands
Of 's Enemies descending, on each side
Flanked by a River which did yet divide
Him from the Prince, who having time to choose
What ground to fight on, did that blessing use
To's best advantage, on a Bridge which by
Boards closely linkt had forced an unity
Betwixt the Banks, his Army past, he now
Within a Plain, whose spacious bounds allow,
Together with a large extention, all,
An ancient Leader could convenient call.
Removed no tedious distance from his Rear
Stood a small Town, which, as the place took care
How to advance so just an interest, might
Be useful, when tired in the heat of fight,
Strength lost in Wounds should force some thither by
Wants which a Camp's unfurnisht to supply.
More near his Front, betwixt him, and the Plain,
Through which Almanzor led his spacious Train,
On a small Hill which gently rose, as though
Its eminence, but only strove to show
The fragrant Vale, how much nice Art out-went
Their beauties in her brows fair Ornament,
A splendid Palace stood, which having been
Built but for wanton peace to revel in,
Was as unfit for the rough hand of War,
As boisterous Arms for tender Virgins are.
To this, since now of consequence unto
The first Possessor had both Armies drew;
Commanded parties, which ere Night shut in,
Lights latest Rays, did furiously begin
The first hot Skirmish, which continuing till
Dark shadows all the Hemisphear did fill,
To such as Fear, or Novelty had sent,
To th'Hils safe tops, such dreadful prospect lent,
By the swift rising of those sudden fires,
In whose short close, that fatal sound expires;
Which tells each timorous Auditor its breath,
To distant breasts, bears unexpected death:
That whilst their eyes direct their thoughts unto
Their danger, whom Reward or Honor drew
To the Encounter, all the uncouth sight
Affords, to horror turns that strange delight*
These circling fires drawn near their Center, in
Such tumult, as Armies engaged begin
Deaths fatal task, a dreadful sound surpised
The distant Ear, danger, that lay disguised
In darkness yer, now, as if wak'nd by
The Conquerors shouts, so general, and so high
That it even drowned the clamourous Instruments
Of fatal War, her Vale of sables rents,
From round the Palace, by that horrid light,
Which her own Turrets, through the steams of Night
In dreadful blazes sent, discovering both
The shadowed Armies, who like Mourners loath
To draw too near their sorrows Center, while
Their friends, consume, surround the blazing Pile,
In such a sad and terrible aspect,
That those engaged in Action, could neglect
Approaching danger, to behold how they
Like Woods grown near the foot of Aetna lay,
Whilst the proud Palace from her sinking Walls,
In this sharp Fevers fiery Chrisis falls.
But now the Nights, as wearied with a Rain,
So full of trouble, had resigned again,
The earths divided Empire, and the day
Grown strong in light, both Armies did display
To their full view, who to the Mountain, in
Sad expectation of the event, had been*
Early Spectators called; here, seated nigh
Their female friends, old men exempted by
Weakness from Wars to, rough encounters, show
Those Colors which, their active Youth did know
Adorn the field, when those that now engage,
Like tender Plants, kept for the future age,
In blooming Childhood were, amongst this they tell
What Heroes in preceding Battles fell,
Where Victory stoop to Valor, and where rent
From brave desert by fatal Accident:
Then ere their story can a period have,
Show Wounds they took, and tell of some they gave.
This sad Praeludium, to an action far
More dismal past, the unvaild Face of War
Looks big with horror; now both Armies draw
So near, that their divided Brothers saw
Each others guilt (that too too common sin
Of civil War.) Rebellions Sons stood in
Arms against their Fathers clad: friends that no cross
Could dis-unite, here found the fatal loss
Of Amity, and (as presaging blood)
In The worst Aspect, sad opposition stood,
One was their fashion, form, and discipline,
Strict Heralds in one Scutcheon did combine
The Arms of both Armies, yet all this must be
By Wars wild rage robbed of its unity.
Whilst like sad Saturn, ominous and slow,
Each Army moved, some Youths set here to grow
By forward Actions, stately Cedars, to
Adorn Fames Court, like shooting Stars were flew,
So bright, so glittering, from the unweildy throng
Of either Army, which being mixed among
Each other, in a swift Numidian fight,
Like Aires small Atoms, when discovering light
Betraies their motion shows, some hours had past
In this light Skirmish, till now near Wars last
Sad Scean arrived, as the distressed heart calls,
Before the body deaths pale Victim falls,
Those Spirits that dispersed by action were
Back to their Center, their Commanders care,
Summons these in, that so united strength
Might swiftly end, or else sustain the length
Of that black storm, where yet that danger stood,
Which must ere long fall in a shower of blood.
A dismal silence, such as often attends
Those that surround the deathbeds of their friends,
In the departing minute, reigns throughout,
Both Armies Troops, who gathered now about
Their several Standards, and distinguished by
Their several colors, such variety
Presents the eye with, that whilst the sad thought
Beholds them but as falling branches brought
To the decay of time, their view did bring
In all the pleasures of the checkquerd Spring.
Like a large field, where being confined unto
Their several squares, here blushing Roses grew,
There purpl'd hiacinths, and near to them,
The yellow Cowslip bends its tender stem,
To the Mountains top, the Army marching low,
Within the Vale, their several Squadrons show.
This silent time, which by command was set
Asido to pay Confessions needful debt,
To often offended Heaven, whose aid though gave
Ere asked, yet since our duty is to crave,
Expects our prayers, the Armies from their still
Devotion raised, declare what Spirits fill
Their breast, by such an universal joy,
As to get Young, and not the Old destroy,
Each had by beauteous Paranymphs been led,
Not to rough War, but a soft Nuptial Bed.
That fatal hour, by time, which though it last,
Till fixed Stars have a perfect Circle past,
We still think short, to Action brought, which now
So near approacht, it could no more allow
The Generals to consult, although there need,
Naught to augment, when Valors flame does feed,
High on the hopes of Victory, the rage
Of eager Armies, ere their Troops engage
Their several Leaders, all that Art did use,
By which loud Wars rough Rhetoric does infuse
Into those bodies, on whose strength consists
Their safety, Souls whose brave Resolves might twist
Them into Chains of Valor, which no force
Then death less powerful, ever should divorce.
The Prince, as more depending on the just
Cause that had drawn his Sword, which to distrust,
Looks like a Crime, soonest commits the day
To Fates Arbitrament; no more delay
Comforts the ^ainting Coward: a sad sound
Of Cannon gave the Signal, and had drowned
The murmuring Drum in silence, Earth did groan,
In trembling Echoes, on her sanguine T^rone
High mounted Horror sits, wild Rage does fill
Each breast with Fury, whose fierce flames distill,
Life through the Alimbecks of their R^ins, that Cloud
Of dust, which when they first did move, a shroud
Of darkness vaild them in, allayd with blood,
Fell to the Earth, whose Clefts a crimson flood,
Filled to the brim, and when it could contain
No more, let forth those purple streams to stain
The blushing fields, which being made sl^ppery by
The unnatural shower, there lets them sink and die:
Whose empty veins rent in this fatal strife,
Here dropped the treasure of exhausted Life.
In sad exchange of wounds, whilst the last breath,
Even flying forth to give another death;
Supports the fainting Spirits, all were now
Sadly employed, armed danger could allow,
In this loud storm of Action, none to stand
Idle Spectators, but each busy hand
Labors in deaths great work, his life to sell
At rates so dear, that Foe by which he fell,
To boast his gain survives not; but now in
This mart of death, blind Fortune does begin
To show her self Antagonist unto
Less powerful Justice; In the common view
Of reason, which by the external shape
Of Actions only judges, no escape
From their desert, Captivity, was left,
The Rebels Army, but the unmanly theft
Of secret flight, to some, protected by
Their Fellows loss, when in a rage as high
As if it had attempted to out-roar
The Battles thunder, a rude Tempest bore
From Southern Climates, on the exalted wings
Of new-raised winds, a change so fatal brings,
To the royal Army, that from Vict'ries near,
Succesful pride, unto extremes which fear
Did nere suggest, it brought them back to view
Their glorious hopes thus sadly over-threw.
A strong reserve, raised by his friends to be
Almanzors rescue, if that Victory,
Seemed to assist the juster part, was now
Brought near the River, which endeavoring how
To ford, they there unwillingly had been
Detaind, till strength had proved but useless in
The Princess Conquest, if the swelling flood,
Whose added streams (too strong to be withstood)
Had not in that impeteous torrent tore
That Bridge which past the royal Army over;
Whose severd Boats borne down the River, made
So sad a change, that whilst their Foes invade,
Their Rear on them, the late lamented loss,
Forbid the others when dispersed to cross
Their Waves by dangers, which in each breast bred
Terrors as great as those from whence they fled.
The valiant Army, like Life's Citadel,
The heart, when naught but poisonous Vapors swel
Every adjacent part, long struggling in
Deaths sharp Convulsions, out of hopes to win
Ought there but what buys the uncertain breath
Of future Fame, at the high price of death;
At length, not conquered, but over burthend by
A flood of power, in Nights obscurity,
When dreadful shadows had the field o're-spread,
As Darkness were a Herse-cloath for the dead;
That this days losses might not grow too great
For reparation, by a hard retreat,
Attempt to save such of their strengths, as since
Enforced to fly, might safely guard the Prince
From dangers, which, could but his Foes have viewd,
Their motions all had unto death purfu'd.
In this distress, from that vast Sea of blood,
The field where late his Army marshald stood,
The wretched Prince retires, but with a train
So small they seemd, like those that did remain
After a Deluge, where the Rivers course,
(Stopped with dead bodies) run with smallest force,
He venters over the flood, whose guilty Waves,
Blushes in blood; some few whom Fortune saves
TO attend on his, a like succesful by
That bold adventure, whilst the Prince does fly,
To guard Alcithius, by his Mandates are,
Since the disasters of this fatal War
Forced him to seek for more assistance, sent
To the Epic^te, striving to prevent
Those wild reports, that on the quick belief,
Of female fear, might be imposed by grief,
He hasts to bear the sad Report to her,
Whose sorrows lost to see the Messenger.
The end of the second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The second Book. CANTO THE THIRD
The ARGUMENT.
V.
Through the dark terrors of a dreadful Night,
The Prince to's Daughter comes with flying speed
From dangers great, as those he feared in flight,
Is by Argalia's forward Valor freed.
VI.
Who having with succesfull Fortune gave
His Master freedom, their joined strength pursue
Their flying Foes unto an unc^uth Cave,
In whose vast Womb Fates dark decrees they view.
THis last Retreat, which seemd but to defer
Danger by being Honors Sepulcher,
Attaind in have, there calming all the strife
Of various Passion, since her Fathers Life,
Paid all the tears she owd his losses, he
His verteous Daughter found, prepared to be
No sad addition to his sorrow by,
The faults of female Imbecility,
Untimely tears; but with a confidence
High as ere taught brave Valor to dispense
With sad disasters, armed to entertain
The worst of Ills, to ease the Wounded's pain,
Or stop their blood, those hands which once she thought
Should have to Victors Triumphs Garlands brought,
Are now imployd, yet that her Acts may be
The best examples to posterity;
Her present ill, she with such strength withstood,
Its power was lost in hopes of future good.
Precipitated from a Throne to be
Subjected by a Subjects tyranny:
To want their pity, who of late did know
No peace, but what his Influence did bestow,
With sad presaging fears, to think his fair,
His verteous Daughter, his rich Kingdoms Heir;
Like to be ravished from his bafl'd power,
A Trophy to a rebel Conqueror,
With such afflicting griefs as did exclude,
The comforts of his passive Fortitude,
Oppressed the Prince, when now an Army led,
By their pursuing Enemies ore-spread
The circling fields, and brings their fear within
The reach of the Eye; heightened with hope to win
That now by parl, which ere the sad success
Of Battle made their conquered numbers less,
He feared in fight; the confidently bold
Almanzor in a Scrowl that did unfold
A Language, whose unreverend style affords
Far more of anger then his Soldiers Swords,
Had ere stird fear within his Princes breast,
His fixed Intentious thus in brief expressed;
-- Great Sir,
NO airy tumor of untamed desire,
Nursed my Ambition, prompts me to aspire
To any Action that may sore above
My Birth or Loyalty, it was the love
I bore your verteous Daughter, that first clad
Me in defensive Arms, which never had
Been else unsheathd, though it had been to defend
Me from Injustice, should your Sword extend
Its power to tyranny; but failing in
That first attempt, ere streams of blood had bin
Shed in addition to those drops, my hand
Had broke my Sword as guilty, had this Land,
To whom I owe, for the first Air I breathd,
Not washed the stain in tears, and since unsheathd
It in the name of Justice; to their good,
Which trembling on uncertain hopes has stood,
Whilst fearing foreign Governors, I have
Added my love, and satisfaction crave
For both, before a greater ill may fall,
To make our sufferings Epidemical,
By being slaves to some proud Tyrant, that,
In politic Ambition reaches at
A Kingdom by professed Affection, and,
Marries your Daughter, to command your Land.
This Scrowl, spotted with Impudence, received
By the vexed Prince, whom passion had bereaved
Of politic Evasions, he returns
A swift defiance, but his high rage burns
Naught but his own scortcht breast, the fainting fire,
Quenched by constraint, wants Fuel to blaze higher,
Then flashy threatenings, which since proved a folly,
Sink in the Ashes of Melancholy;
For which his ablest Council could prepare,
No Cordial of advice, they rather share
With him in sorrow, whose harsh burden grows
Not lighter by the company of those,
That now lend hearts to bear it, only in
This sullen Clouds obscurity, this sin
Of their Nativity, the noble Soul,
Of the undaunted Princess did control,
The harshest Lectures of her Stars, and sat,
Unshaken in this Hyrocane of Fate;
Calming her Fathers hot adversity
With Dews of comfort, taught him how to be
Prince of his Passions, a Command more great,
Then his that trembles in a regal seat.
The Enemy that vainly had till now,
Toiled forth their strength, no more endeavors how
By force to conquer, some small time they knew,
Would with the bloodless Sword of Famine do,
More then their Cannon could, the meager Fen
Already grew tyrannical, his men,
Like walking Ghosts, wait on their Prince and stand
For shadows on their Plat-forms, not a hand,
But was unnerv'd with want, yet whilst each part
Languisht towered death, each bosom held a heart,
Which though most large, could never empty he,
Being doubly filled with grife and loyalty:
Amongst both which, hope for a part puts in,
As the Supporter, of what else had been
A burden insupportable, and spoke
This pleasing Language, that the royal Oak
Beneath whose Winter Fortune now they stood,
Pining for want, the witherd under Wood,
That all his miseries dropped on, yet they shall
When ere his brighter Stars again do call
His Fortune into light, be comforted
By his kind shadow; which shall those that fled
Him in this sad extreme, then leave to be
Scortcht in the Rays of angry Majesty.
Reduced unto this pitied exigence,
Yet by his honor, which could not dispense
With ought that like suspicion looked, detaind,
From what by parl might have their freedom gaind,
The loyal Sufferers, to declare how far
They fear declind, those mourning weeds of War,
Whose fight a desperate valor does betray,
Black En signs on their guarded Walls display,
When to augment their high resolves, with what
Their valor was to pity so f^ned at,
After, with all those course, though scarce Cates, they
By sparing, first attempted to betray
Time till relief with, they would been fed till now
There naught remaind, that longer could allow
Life further hopes of sustenance, to do
An Act so great, all Ages to ensue,
Shall more admire then imitate; within
The Hall, appears their Sovereign, leading in
His hand the Princess, whose first view, though dressed
In Robes as sad as sorrow ere expressed,
Was but the Frontiers of their grief, to what
When nearer seen, whilst sorrow silenced at
So sad on Object, might for death be took,
Made solemn grief, like grave Religion look.
Whilst all thus in sad expectation stand,
Of future Fate, disdaining to command,
Those whom an equal sorrow seemd to make
His fellow Sufferers, the sad Prince thus spoke
His fixed resolves, Brave Souls, whose loyal love,
Oppressed by my unhappy woes must prove
Part of my grief, since by my wretched Fate,
Forced with my own life to precipitate
Yours into danger, from whose reach, since by
No Crime, until the love of Loyalty
Become a sin, you are called guilty, yet
Seek some evasion, it is not you that sit
Upon the Throne he aims at, nor does here
Arival in Pharonnida appear.
No, it is our lives, our lives brave Subjects that
His bold Ambition only reaches at,
By this pretense, what to my Daughter, love
To's Country's, pity called, could he remove
Those (now but small Obstructions) soon would grow
To's pride united, till it over flow,
All limets of a Subjects duty, by
Rebellious reach, usurped tyranny.
Go then, and let not my unhappiness
Afflict you more, in the shadow of distress;
It Will like warm comforts swel my Soul to know
That to his Favor you for safety ow.
Did not those sacred Canons that include,
All virtue in a Christians Fortitude,
Obstruct our Passions progress, we, ere this,
In death had made the haughty Rebel miss
The glory of his Conquest, which since now
Den^'d, although unweildy age allow
Not strength to sell my life at such a rate
Honor aims at, yet shall the slow debate,
Even in my fall, let the World know I died,
Scorning his pity, as they hate his pride.
Here stopped the Prince, when, as if every breast,
One universal sorrow had possessed,
Grief (grown into more noble passion) broke
The attentive silence, and thus swiftly spoke
Their resolution^, On, on, and lead
Us unto death, no Critic eye shall read
Fear through the Optics of our Souls, but give
Command to act, here is not a heart durst live
Without obedience; camforted with this
Rich Cordial, from his sorrows dark Abyss
Raised to resolves, whose greatness equaled all
His former Glory, by their fatal fall;
To darken the ensuing day, the Prince
Gives a Command to all his Train, that since
Their own free Votes elected death, they now
With Souls that no terrestial thought allow,
A residence, against the next Morn prepare,
That wished for freedom, with himself to share.
All sadly sat, expecting but that light,
Whose near approach must to eternal Night,
Their last Conductor be, a sudden, still,
And doleful silence, such as often does fill
The Room where sick men slumber, when their Friends
Stand weeping by, to Contemplation bends
Their busy thoughts; within each troubled breast,
Being to leave the Mansion she would possessed
So long, yet with so short a warning, all
Her Faculties the frighted Soul did call,
Forth of the Bosom of those Causes, in
Whose form they would fetterd to their Crasis been,
To join those powers (yet strong in living breath)
For her assistance in the grasp of death.
The whispering Trumpet having called them by
Such sharp Notes, as, when powerful Foes are nigh
Retreating Parties use, all swiftly rise
From bended Knees, and the last Sacrifice,
They ere expect to pay to Heaven, until
Their Souls last gasp the vocal Orgains fill.
Concluded was the last sad interview,
The Prince was marched, Pharonnida withdrew.
And now, all from the opened Ports were in
A swift March sallying, had their speed not been
Thus swiftlier stopped; those scatterd horse that fled
The Battle to the Epirotes Court had sped
So well in their Embassage, that the Prince
Whom the least negligence might now convince
Of want of love, proud of so fair a chance;
To shows Affection, swiftly does advance
With a vast Army towered them, but the fear,
Prevailing danger, ere their strength come near,
To their necessitated Friends, might force
Them to unworthy Articles, some horse
Selected are, whose swifter speed might, (by
A desperate charge broke through their Foes) supply
Their fainting friends; the much desired Command
Of these few men, committed to the ^and
Of brave Argalia (nere more blessed then now
In serving the fair Princess) did allow
His Sword so fair a field to write the story,
Of Honor in, that his unblasted Glory,
Beyond this day shall live, outlive the reach
Of long-armd Envy, and those weak Souls teach,
That fear the frowns of Fate, in spite of all,
Heroic Virtue sits too high to fall.
With the days close they take their March, and ere
The silver Morning on her brow did bear
The burnisht guilt oth' Suns warm Rays, arrive
In view oth' place; when Fortune, that did strive
To crown their hopes, had wrapped the earth in thick
And heavy mists; the sluggish Morning sick
Of Midnight surfei^s, from her dewy bed,
Pale, and discolourd Rose. This Curtain spread,
To vail their plot in, they assault their Foes,
Which when surpised could not themselves dispose,
Fit for resistance, but whilst some did fly
From the distracting danger, others die
To their neglect a Sacrifice: the swift
Alarm, like a rude winds circling drift,
Hurries confusion through the field, and shook
The trembling Soldier: some unclad forsook
Their half-fir'd Cabbens; deaths large gripe did take
Whole troops that Destiny ordaind to wake
No more till Doomsday, and in's march prevents
The unition of unrallied Regiments.
This frighted Language of Confusion heard,
By those oth' Castle, which were now prepared,
For their last desperate Sally, switly draws
Them to assist their friends, and though the cause,
(Being yet unknown) was only thought to be
Some private Jar grown to a Mutiny,
Or else the noise the Enemy had made,
When all their force was drawing to invade
Them in their works, however, they stand not to
Consult with reason, but as striving who
Shall first encounter death, each several hand
Sought for his own from those that did withstand
His rage-directed strength; their Cannon in
A Funeral Peal went off, whose steam had been
Their Covert to the Camp, where finding such
A wild confusion, they assisted much
The fortune of the day, which now was grown
Indubitable, they might call their own
A glorious Conquest, the thick sulphry cloud,
Whose dismal shade did that destruction shroud,
Rent with those thunderclaps, dissolved into
A shower of blood, what she vouchsaft to do,
Fortune lends light to show them; having left
Their Camp, whilst darkness did protect a Theft,
That only stole dishonor, which they were
Now in an open flight enforced to bear;
They see Almanzors broken troops ore-spread
The neighboring fields: those clouds of men that fled,
Being pursued by Companies so small,
That they appeard but like those drops that fall
After a storm. Yet as the laboring Heart
Long struggles for that life which does depart
From the less noble Members, to lend aid
To her in deaths pale Conflict, having stayed
Some of his best Commanders, hoping by
Their valor to recall the rest, with high
Undaunted force, Almanzor does oppose,
His Enemies pursuit, till like to enclose
Him in, disdaining the reproachful end,
He must expect, no longer stands to attend
The glimering light of hope: the field he leaves
To conquering Argalia, but deceives
Him of himself, the prize most sought for, which
When lost beyond recovery, he grown rich
In shining honor, that, like Sunbeams placed
Within a field of gules, by being defaced,
Had beautified his Armor; that dark mist,
Which did at first such contradictions twist,
That he both cursed, and blessed it, one cause did
Aid his design, the other cause it hid
His Heaven of Beauty, in their dewy Bed
Had left the blushing Roses, and was fled
Upon the Wings of the wind. With wonder now
Discoverd colors taught each party how,
To know their Friends. The royal Standard in
The Princes party had disvellopt been,
By that fair signal to discover, who
Was present there: but ere Argalia to
That place arrived, Pharonnida, who had,
Whilst desperation all her beauties clad
In the pale Robes of fear, heard all the loud
Shock of the Conflict, but until the Cloud
Removed his fatal Curtain, never knew
How near the hour of her delivery drew;
That being dissolved, through those which grief had raised,
In her fair Eyes, did see, and seeing praised
Just Heaven which sent it; each of those that
Fought for her she commends, but wonders at,
Although unknown, the lightning valor she
Saw in Argalia, whilst with just rage he
Unravels Natures workmanship, a rent
Which were a sin, if not a punishment,
And from the slender web of life did send
Forth Rebels Souls, fast as each busy Fiend,
That wait their falls transport them, fain she would,
Ere known, conceit 'twere he, but how he should
Come there, and so attended did exceed
Imagination. Thus whilst her hopes feed
On strange desires, being come near unto
The Coach wherein she sat, prepared to do
His Loves Oblations, he that Face disarms,
Which when beheld, by those attractive charms,
Within the center of her best desires,
Contracted all her hopes, whose life expires,
Soon as they are crowned with wished success; too great
A distance parts them yet, she leaves her seat,
And flies to his Embraces, but conceald
Her passion in his Merit, being reveald
To him alone, whose better judgment knew,
That in those Spirit-breathing beams that fl^w
Through the fair Casements of her Eyes, did move
The secret Language of an ardent love.
This conflict of her passions, which had been
Fought betwixt fear and hope, was settled in
A silent joy, that from her noble breast
Struggled for passage, whilst Argalia blessed
Above his hopes, in burning kisses seals
His service on her Virgin hand, that steals
From thence new flames into her heart, which ere
Fed with desire, even whilst she did prepare,
To entertain those welcome Guests, appears
The Prince, who now, thawd from the icy fears
Of desperation, was come there to give
Thanks to his unknown friends; but words did live
Within a place too baren to bestow
That fruitful zeal, whose plenty did or^-flow
His Eyes (those clouded Orators) which till
Disburthend did capacious passion fill.
This moist Gale over, when now they had awhile
Melted in joy, clothing it with a smile;
He thus unfolds his comfort. Blessed Fates
You have out-try'd my charity, he hates
All real Virtue, that confesses not
My care of thee, was but an unknown spot
To this large world of satisfaction; here
Kind sorrow stopped his voice again, when fear
Their Enemies might rally, and in the bud
Blast all their blooming joys, even whilst the blood
Wreak'd on his Sword, leaving their Eyes to pay
Pursuing prayers, Argalia posts away,
But finds his Foes dispersed, excepting one
Stout Regiment, whose desperation grown
To valor, spite of all pursuers, made
Good their retreat; till forced at length to shade
Themselves from the pursuing danger, in
A deep dark Cave, whose spacious Womb had been
Their Receptacle, when unlawful theft
Was their profession. In this place they would left
Their dearest pledges, as most confident
Those dark Meanders would their loss prevent.
These stout Opposers being protected here,
(Before Argalia brought his Army near)
Had fortified the narrow pass, and now
Presume of safety, since none else knew how,
Without their leave to enter; Hemmed about,
With all the Castle Foot, his Horse sent out
To clear the field, the careful General sees,
Then every Quarter made secure, he frees
His own from all suspected danger, while
This busy Siege did better things beguile
Of some few steps of time, the Prince arrives,
To see the Leager, where each Captain strives
With entrance to be honored, but in vain,
The subtle Engineer here racks his Brain:
The Mountains yield not to their Cannon shock,
Nor mine could pierce the marble-breasted Rock.
Thus whilst they lay despairing ere to force,
A place so difficult, with some few Horse
Only attended, the vexed Prince surrounds
The spa^ious Hill, whose uncouth sight confounds
His ablest Guides; making a stand to view
A Promontory, on whose brow there grew
A Grove of stately Cedars, from a dark
And hidden cleft, proud of so rich a Mark;
Some Mus kets are discharged, which missing by
A desperate Sallie's seconded, to fly
The danger thorough such a dreadful way,
As now they were to pass, was not to stay,
But hasten ruin, though too weak, in fight
More safety lay, then an unworthy flight.
But Valor, like the royal Eagle, by
A cloud of Crows ore-masterd, less to die
With honor, had no refuge left, and that
Here each Plebeian gains; when frighted at
The unusual clamor, with such troops as were
Most fit for speed, Argalia was come there;
Arrived even with that minute which first saw
His Prince a Captive; Now the Rebbels draw
Back to their private Salliport, but are
Too speedily pursued to enter far,
Within their dark Meanders, ere ore-took,
By their enraged Foes, who had forsook
Their other stations, and to this alone,
Drew all their Forces, entering the unknown
And horrid Cave, whose troubled Womb till then,
Nere such a Cholick felt: Argalia's men,
(Following so brave a Leader) boldly tred
Through the Rocks rugged Entrails; those that fled
Though better skild in their obscure retreat,
No safety find; the Caves remotest seat
Was now the stage of death, together thronged,
After their Swords had Life's last step prolonged;
There all the Villains in despair had di'd,
Had not the fear their Prince in such a tide
Of blood might have been shipwrackt, whom to save,
A general Pardon to the rest is gave.
And now the dreadful Earthquake which had turned
The Rock to Aetna, could its top have burnd,
With Subteranean fires, being ceased, the Prince
Desirous by his knowledge to convince,
Those word-deep wonders, which report had spread,
Of that strange Cave, commands some to be led
By an old Outlaw, whose experience knew
The uncouth Vaults remotest Corners, to
Those seats of horror, which performd, and word
Returned again, the danger did afford,
Subject for nobler Spirits; forthwith he
(Attended by Argalia) goes to see
What had afrighted them; the dreadful way,
Through which he past, being steep, and rugged lay,
Between two black and troubled streams, that through
The cleft Rock rowld with horrid noise, till to
An ugly Lake, whose heavy streams did ly
Unstird with air they come, and there are by
That black Asphaliis swallowd; a strange sound
Of yelling Dragons, hissing Snakes confound
Each trembling Auditor, till comforted
By bold Argalia, ventring first to tread
On stones, which did like ruined Arches ly
Above the surface of the Lake, he is by
Their aid brought to an ancient Tower, that stood
Fixed in the center of the lazy flood;
Its Basis founded on a Rock, whose brow
With age disfigured into clefts, did now
With loud and speedy ruin threaten to
Crush all beneath it; round about it flew
On sooty wings such ominous Birds as hate
The cheerful day, Vipers, and Scorpions sat
Circl'd in darkness, till the cold damp breath
Of near concreted Vapors, singed to death,
By the numerous light of Torches, which did shine
Through the whole Mountains Unequal, and refin^
Air with restraint corrupted, forcing way,
By conquering flames recals the banished day.
Come now to a black Tower, which seemd to be
The Throne of some infernal Deity,
That his extended Laws reaches unto
The brazen Gate, whose folded Leaves withdrew,
Assaul^ their eyes with such a flux of light,
That as the dim Attendants of the Night,
In bashful duty shun the Prince of Day,
So their lost Tapors unto this give way;
Whilst it with wonder, that belief out-grew,
Transports their sights to the amazing view
Of so much beauty, that the use of sense
Was lost in m^re then humane excellence.
A glorious Room, so elegantly fair,
In 't^ various structure, that the riotous Heir
O h' east^rn Crescent that might choose to be
The Theater of shining Majesty
They now behold, yet then its mighty strength,
Which had preserved such beauty from the length
Of Ages ire Tallons, there appear
More rare perfections, the large floor of clear
Transparant Emraulds, lent a luster to
The Oval Roof, whose scarce-seen ground was blew,
Studded with sparkling Gems, whose brightness lent
The beauties of the vaulted Firmament,
To all beneath their beams; the figured walls,
Imbost with rare and antic sculptry, calls
For the next observance, though the serious eye,
The way to truth in secret mystery
He e having l^st, lets the dark Text alone,
To view the beauties of a glorious Throne,
Which placed within the splendid Room, did stand
Beneath an Ivory Arch, over which the hand
Of Art, in golden Hierogliphicks, had
The story of ensuing Fate unclad,
But vainly, since the Art defective times,
Stro^k naught but discords on those wel-tun'd Chimes.
Upon the Throne, in such a glorious state,
As earths adored Favorites there sat,
The Image of a Monarch, vested in
The spoils of Natures Robes, whose price had been
A Diadems redemption, his large size,
Beyound this Pigmy Age, did equalize
The admired proportion of those mighty men,
Whose cast-up bones, grown modern wonders, when
Found out, are carefully preserved to tell
Posterity, how much these times are fell
From Natures youthful strength, if be not worse,
Our sins Stenography, the dwarffish Cu^se
Ordaind for large sized Luxury: before
The Throne a Lamp, whose fragrant Oils had more
Perfumed the Room, then all the ba^my wealth
Of rich Arabia, stood: Light, Life, and Health,
Dwelt in its Odours, but what more contents,
The pleased Spectators, that fai^ hand presents
The rest to the view: the Image to declare
Of whom the Effigies was, on's Front did bear
A regal Crown, and in his hand sustaind,
A threatening Scepter, but what more explained
Antiquities mysterious dress was seen,
In a small Tablet, which, as if 't had been
Worth more observance, then what Fate expressed
In unknown Figures he did gently rest
His left hand on, as if endeavoring by
That Index to direct Posterity;
How in their wonders Altitude to praise
The deeper knowledge of those wiser days,
By reading in such Characters as Time
Learnd in her nonage (this) in antic Rhyme.
When striving to remove this Light,
To Princes Leaves involved in Night;
The time draws near, that shall pull down
My old Morea's triple Crown,
Uniting on one royal Head,
What to disjoyn such discord bred,
But let the more remote ^ake heed,
For there is a third ordaind to bleed;
For when I Am read, not understood,
Then shall Epiru's royal blood,
By ways no Mortal yet must know,
Within the Artolian Channel flow.
This strange Inscription read, not only by
The Prince, but those whom wonder had drawn nigh
The sacred Room, their Fancies civil War,
Grows full of trouble, it is a Text so far
Beyond a Comment, that their Judgments in
Enigmaes mazed, had long let motion been
In Epeleptick wonder lost, until
(As that alone containd their dreaded ill)
The greater part with joynd consents advise,
To have the Lamp removed, since in it lies,
(If those Lines prove prophetic) the linkt Fate
Of all Ietian Princes, which debate,
Being carried in the Affirmative, the rest
Drew back, whilst bold Argalia forward pressed;
But's thus soon stayed, the stone on which he stepped,
Next, was by Art so framd, that it had kept
Concealed an Engines chifest Spring, which by
The least weight touched, in furious have let fly
Unpracticed wheels, and with such vigor struck,
The Scepter on the long lived Lamp, it shook
Its crystal Walls to dust, not thunders strong
Exagitations, when it roars among
Heaps of congested Elements, a sound
More dreadful makes, but what did most confound
Weak trembling Souls, was the thick darkness that
Succeeds the dying flame, which wondering at,
Whilst all remain, Arts feeble aides supply
The Lamps lost Virtue, with new Lights, but by
Cold Damps so darkened, that contracted Night
Scornd their weak flames, showing that hallowd light
Containd more sacred Virtues; now as Fate,
Had only to that hour prolonged the date
Of all within, a sudden change to dust,
The mighty body turns, consuming rust,
Had eat the brazen Imagry, and left
No sign of what till then, safe from the theft
Of time remaind, darkness had repossest
The sullen Cave, to an eternal rest;
In the rude Chaos of their ashes, all
Arts lively Figures in an instant fall.
Pleased with the sight of these strange Objects more,
Then with Wars dangers he was vexed before;
The Prince with all his train of Conquerors now,
Is gone to teach the expecting Army how
To share their wonder, but not far from thence,
Removes before confirmd Intelligence,
Acquaints him with the Epirots March, who in
Mis swift advance, so fortunate had been,
That falling on such as the Mornings flight,
Flatterd with hope, they there met endless Night;
At unawares; but of these added numbers,
Was cursed Almanzor none, yet Justice slumbers
In The prosecution of his unripe Fate,
Which must more horrid ^ins accumulate;
Before cut off, his clamorous guilt must call
For vengeance louder, and grow hectical
With Custom, til the Tables of his shame,
Into oblivion rot his loathed Name.

The ARGUMENT.
VII.
From Wars wide breaches, whence his brave friends had
With Victory brought him, the old Prince arrived
In safety, whilst fear punishes the bad
Rewards that Virtue, which his Cause revived.
VIII.
In which brave Act, Argalia's Merits met
With a reward that even desert out-grew,
Whilst him it the fair Princess Guardian set,
The root on which Loves fruit to ripeness grew.
THat too inferior Branch, which strove to rise
With the Basillick to Anastomize;
Thus drained, the States Plethorick humors are
Reduced to Harmony; that blazing Star,
Which had been lifted by rebellious breath,
To's exaltation in the house of death;
Now lay oppressed, which Victory complete,
Leaving his Army, where before the seat
O^h' Rebels was, his entertainment by,
The welcome Harbenger of Victory,
Before prepared, the pleased Epirote goes
With an exalted joy to visit those,
His goodness (whilst unknown) relieved, where he
Such noble welcome finds, as not to be
Imagined, but by grateful Souls that know
The strength of Courtesy, when 'twould ore-flow
Those Merits, which whilst Love incites to praise
Our friends deserts, to Pyramids we raise,
The narrow Confines of Alcithius Wall,
Which kept them safe from dangers past, too small
Grows for that present triumph, that blot out
All thoughts of grief, but what are spent about
Thansgiving for delivery, which they do
Perform in sports, whose choice delights might woo
Cold Anchorites from their sullen Cells, the Earth,
The Air, the Sea, all in a plenteous birth,
Exhausted their rich Treasuries to pay
Tribute to their desires, which could time stay
Her Chariot wheels from hurrying down the Hill
Of feeble Nature, man's vain thoughts would fill
With subaltern delights, most highly prized,
Till the conclusion (death) has annaliz'd
The doubtful Text, with what lets Mortals know
Their blooming joys must drop to shades below.
That great eclipse of Glories rays, within
Whose shades sad Corinth had benighted been:
Since like a widdowed Turth, first she sat
A Mourner for her wandering Princes fate;
Now like the days recoverd Rain breaks forth,
In fuller Luster; all excelling worth
That honored Virtue, or loved beauty placed
Her Ornaments, with their appearance graced
Those public triumphs, she prepares to meet
The Princes in, in every splendid street;
The various pride of Persia strove to outvie
Rich English Wool, dipped in the Tyrrian Dye:
Each Shop shines bright, and every Merchant shows,
How little to domestic toil he ows,
By the displaying beauteous Wardrobes, where
The worlds each part may justly claim a share,
Though what in all Arts stiff Contention lent
Most luster was the Windows Ornament,
Fair Constellations of bright Virgins, that
Like ful-blown Flowers, first to be wonderd at,
Display their beauties, but that past, with all
Tempt some kind hand to pluck them ere they fall.
Their entrance in this triumph made, whilst now
Each busy Artist is endeavoring how
To court their Fancies, times small stock t'improve
The grave Epirote, whose designs toward Love;
Yet only by Ambition led, had made
His first approach so seeming retrograde,
By States nice Cautions; and what did presage
More ill the inequality of age,
That when Converse his Fancy Captive led,
His largest hopes on the thin Diet fed
Of a Paternal power, assisted by
Whose useful aid, with all the industry
Of cager Love, he still augments that fire,
Which must consume, not satisfy desire.
But as occasion warned him to prevent
Unequal flames, he but few days had spent
In Loves Polemmicks, ere unpractic'd Art,
From this calm field, to wars more serious part
Is sadly summond, those large Conquests he
Had triumphed in, whilst glorious Victory
Waited on's Sword, too spacious to be kept
Obedient whilst that glittering terror slept,
In an unactive peace, disclaiming all
The harsh Injunctions of proud Victors, fall
Off from's obedience, and to justify
Their bold revolt, to the unsafe refuge fly,
Of a defensive power, to crush whose pride
With such a force, as an impeteous tide
Assaults the shoars defense, he is forced to take
A march so sad as Souls, when they forsake
The wel-known Mansions of their bodies, to
Tread deaths uncertain paths, and there renew
Acquaintance with Eternity, perplexed
To hear those new Combustions, but more vexed
With Loves proud flames burning, in which we will leave
Him on his hasty Voyage, and receive
A smile from the fair Princess fate, which till
Enjoyment stifles strong desire, will fill
The tragic Scean no more, but with as sad
A progress to her hopes, as ever had
Poor Virgin to the Throne of Love, will frame
Those harsh Philacters, which in Cupids name,
She must obey, unless she will dispense
With sacred Vows, and Martyr Innocence.
These storms blown over, and the Epirote gone,
Her Father, that till now had waited on
His Entertainment, with a serious eye,
Looks over his Kingdoms wounds, and does supply
Each part, which in this late unnatural War
Was grown defective, unto some that are
Not Lethargiz'd in Ill, he gently lays
Refreshing Mercies, sometimes danger stays
From an approaching Gangren, by applying
Corroding threats, but unto those that flying
All remedies prescribed, had mortified
Their Loyalty, stern Justice soon applied
The Sword of Amputation, which care past,
As 'twas his greatest, so becomes his last.
Pharonnida he places, where she might,
At once enjoy both safety and delight.
Her thoughts clear calm, too smooth for the turbuler
And busy City, wants that sweet content
The private pleasures of the Country did
Afford her Youth, but late attempts forbid
All places far remote, which to supply,
He unto one directs his choice, that by
Its situation did participate
Of all those rural privacies, yet sat
Cloathd in that flowery Mantle, in the view
Oth' Castle Walls, which as placed near it to
Delight, not trouble, in full bulk presents,
Her public Buildings various Ornaments.
This beauteous Fabric, where the industrious hand
Of Art had Natures Midwife proved, did stand
Divided from the Continent, by the wide
Arms of a spa^ious stream, whose wanton pride,
In Cataracts from the Mountains broke, as glad
Of liberty to court the Valley, had
Curld his proud Waves, and stre^cht them to enclose
That type of Paradise, whose Crown-top rose
From that clear Mirror, as the first light saw,
Fair Eden' mids the Springs of Havilah;
So fresh as if its verdant Garments had
Been in the first Creations beauties clad
Ere by mistaking of the fatal Tree,
That blooming type of blessed Eternity,
Subjected was, by man's too easy Crime,
Unto the sick Vicissitudes of time.
Nor was she in domestic beauty, more
Then Prospect rich, the wandering eye past over
A flowery Vale, smooth, as it had been spread
By Nature, for the Rivers fragrant Bed.
At the opening of that lovely Angle met
The Cities Pride, as costlier Art had set
That Masterpiece of Wit and Wealth, to show
Unpollisht Natures pleasures were below
Her splendid beauties, and unfit to be
Looked on, less in the Springs variety:
Though from the Palace where in prospect stood
All that nice Art, or plainer Nature wood;
If in Contention, show to magnify,
Their power did stand, yet now appeard to vie
Ehat Prospect, which the City lent, unless
Diverted from that civil Wilderness:
The pathless Woods, and ravenous Beasts within
Whose bulk were but the Metaphors for sin;
We turn to view the stately Hills, that fence
The other side oth' happy Isle, from whence
All that delight or profit could invent
For rural pleasures was for prospect sent.
As Nature strove for something uncouth in
So fair a dress, the struggling streams are seen,
With a loud murmr rolling amongst the high
And rugged clefts, one place presents the eye
With barren rudeness, whilst a neighboring field
Sits cloathd in all the bounteous spring could yield,
Here lovely Landskips, where thou might behold,
When first the Infant Morning did unfold
The Days bright Curtains, in a spacious Green,
Which Natures curious Art had spread between
Two bushy Thickets, that on either hand,
Did like the Fringe of the fair Mantle stand,
A timorous herd of grasing Deer, and by
Them in a shady Grove, through which the eye
Could hardly pierce, a wel-built Lodge, from whence
The watchful Keepers careful diligence,
Secures their private walks, from hence to look
On a deep Valley, where a silver Brook,
Does in a soft and busy murmr slide
Betwixt two Hills, whose shadows strove to hide
The liquid wealth, they were made fruitful by,
From full discoveries of the distant eye.
Here from fair Country Farms that had been
Built amongst those Woods, as places happy in
Their privacy, the first salutes of light,
Fair Country-Virgins meet, cleanly, and white,
As were their milky loads; so free from pride,
(Though truly fair) that justly they deride
Courts nice Contentions, and by freedom prove
More blessed their Lives, more innocent their Loves.
Ea^ly as these appears within the field,
The painful Husbandman, whose Labor steeld
With fruitful hopes, in a deep study how
TO improve the Earth, follows his slow-paced Plow.
Near unto these a Shepherd having took
On a green Bank, placed near a purling Brook,
Protection from the Suns warm beams, within
A cool fresh shade, truly contented in
That Sollitude, is there endeavoring how
On's wel-tun'd Pipe, to smooth the furrowd brow
Of careful want, seeing not far from hence
His flock (the Emblems of his Innocence)
Where the more lofty Rock admits not these
Domestic pleasures, Nature there did please
Her self with wilder pastimes, on those Clifts
Whose rugged ^eads the spacious Mountain lifts
To an unfruitful height, amongst a wild
Indomitable herd of Goats, the mild
And fearful Cony, with her busy feet,
Makes Warmth and Safety in one Angle mee^.
From this wild range, the eye contracted in
The Islands narrow bounds would think it had been
In The world before, but now were come to view
An Angel-guarded Paradise till to
A Pictures first rude Catagraph, the Art
Of an ingenious Pensil does impart
Each Complement of skill, or as the Court
To the rude Country, as each Princely sport
That brisks the blood of Kings, to those which are
The gross-Soul'd Peasants rude delight, so far
These Objects differ, here wel-figur'd Nature
Had put in form, and to a goodly sta^ure;
On whose large bulk more lasting Arts were spent,
Added the dress of choicest Ornament.
The stately Mount, whose artificial Crown,
The Palace was, to meet the Vale stole down
On soft descents, by labor forced into
A fliding Serpentine, whose winding Clew,
An easy, but a slow descent did give
Unto a purling stream, whose Spring did live,
When from the Hills cool Womb broke forth, within
A Grotto, whence before it did begin
To take its weeping farewell, into all
The various Forms restrictive Art could call,
Her Elemental Instruments unto
Obedience by it, Courts the admiring view
Of pleased Spectators, here exalted by
Clear Aqueducts, in showers, it from those high
Supporters falls, now turned into a thin
Vapor, in that Heavens painted Bow is seen;
Now it supplies the place of Air, and to
A Quire of Birds gives breath, which all seemd flew
From thence for fear, when the same Element
With such a noise as Seas imprisond rent,
Including Rocks do roar, which rude sound done;
As noble Conqu'rors who the Battle won,
From the loud thunders of impeteous War,
To the calm fields of peaceful Mercies are
By manly pity led, so Pro^eus like,
Returned from what did fear or wonder strike;
The liquid Nymph resuming her own shape,
Within a Marble square, a clear escape,
Till from her winding stream the River takes
Still fresh supplies, from that fair Fountain makes
Upon those Banks which guarded her descent,
Both for her Odor, and her Ornament,
Lillies, and fragrant Roses there were set;
To heighten whose perfume, the Violet
And maiden Primrose in their various dress,
Steal through that Moss, whose humble lowliness,
Preserve their beauties, whilst Aurora's rose
And that ambitious Flower that will disclose
The ful-blown beauties of her self to none,
Until the Sun mounts his Meridian Throne:
Like envied worth, together with the view
Of the Beholders, being exposed unto
Each storms rough breath, in that Vicissitude,
Finds that their pride their danger does include,
When scortcht with heat, or bur^hend with a shower,
From blooming beauty sinks the fading Flower;
Though here defended by a Grove that twined
(...) Embraces, and with boughs combined,
Protects the (...), which it never leaves,
Till thence the Vale its flowery wealth receives.
Placed as the nobler Faculty to this
Of vegitation, like an Emphasis,
Amongst the flowers of Rhetoric did stand
The gorgeous Palace, where Arts curious hand
Had to exceed example centerd in
One exact Model, what had scatterd been:
But as those Fragments which she now selects,
The glory of all former Architects,
Here did the beauties of those Temples shine,
Which Ephesu^, or sacred Pallastine,
Once boasted in, the Persian might from this
Take Paterns for his famed Pers^polis:
This, which had that fair Carian Widow known,
Mausolea's Tomb had never a Proverb grown,
But been esteemd, after her cost, by her
That did erect, a homely Sepulcher.
Though to describe this Fabric, be as far
Above my Art, as imitations are
Beneath its worth, yet if thy Fancies eye
Would at its outside glance, receive it by
This cloudy Medium; on a stately square,
Which powerful Art forced to a level, where
The Mountain highest rose, compast about
With a thick Grove, whose leavy Vail let out
Its beauties so, it is at a distance seen,
A silver Mount enameld over with green;
The shining Palace stood, whose outward form
Though such, as if, built for perpetual storm*
Yet in that strength appeard but armed to be,
Beauties Protector, whose variety
Though all met in an Artful gracefulness,
In every Square put on a several dress.
The sides whose large Balcones conveyed the Ey
To the Filds wild Prospects, were supported by
A thousand Pillars, where in mixture shone
The Parian white and red Corinthian stone,
Supporting Frames, where in the like Art stood
Smooth Ivory mixed with India's swarthy wood:
All which with Gold, and purer Azure brought
From Persian Artists, in Mosaicks wrought:
The curious Eye into Meanders led,
Until di^erted by a sight that bred
More real wonder, the rich Front wherein
By antic sculpture, all that ere had been
The various Acts of their preceding Kings,
So figured was, no weighty Metal brings,
Ought to inhaunce its worth, Art did compose,
Each Emblem of such various Gems, all chose
Their several colors, under a Saphir Sky,
Here cheerful Emeraulds, chaste Smaragdi ly;
A fresh green field, in which the armed Knights
Were all clad in heart-cheering Chrisolites,
With Rubies set, which to adorn them twist
Embraces with the temperate Amethyst:
For parts unarmd, here the fresh Onix stood,
And Sardias stone appeard like new-drawn blood.
The Proteus like Achates here was made,
For Swords fair Hi^ts, but for the glittering Blade,
(Since all of rich and precious Gems was thus)
Composed, was shown of flaming Piropus.
And least ought here that is excellent should want,
The Ladies Eyes were shining Adamant.
These glorious Figures large, as if that in
Each common Quar these glittering Jems had been
By sweaty Laborers dig'd, united by
Succesful Art unto the distant Ey;
Their mixed beams with such splendid Luster sent,
That Comets, with whose fall the Firmament,
Seems all on fire, amazes not the sight,
With such a full and sudden Flux of Light:
As Lines extended from their Center, hence
Unto the Islands clear circumference,
Four flowery Glades, whose odoriferous dress,
Tempted the weary to forgetfulness;
Cutting the Mountain, into Quadrants led,
Into the Valley, Pleasures humbler Bed;
Where come (if Natures stock can satisfy
The Fancy at the Fountains of the Eye)
'Twas here performd in all that did include,
What active mirth, or sacred sollitude,
Could happy call, Groves never seen by the Eye
Oth' Universe, whose pleasing privacy,
Was more retired from treacherous light then those,
To hide from Heaven, Earths first Offender chose.
When Contemplation the kind Mother to,
All thoughts that ere in sacred rapture flew
Toward Celestial Bowers, had here refined
The yet imperfect Embrioes of the mind;
To recreate contracted Spirits by,
The Souls best Medicine, fresh variety;
An easy walk conducts them unto all
That active Sports did ere convenient call.
All which, like a fair Theater by the Bank
Oth' River verg'd, was guarded by a Rank
Of ancient Elms, whose lofty Trunks embraced,
By clasping Vines, with various colors graced
Their spreding branches, whose proud brows being crowned
With stately Walks, did from that ample round,
The wel-pleas'd Eye to every place convay,
That in the Islands humble level lay.
To guard her Court, a hundred Gentlemen,
Such as had glorified their Valor, when
Tried in her Fathers Wars attended, which
Commanded by Argalia, did enrich
His Merit with such fair reward, that all
His better Stars, should they a Synod call;
Those fires convened nere with more glorious Light,
Could cloth his hopes, his Fortunes dim-ey'd Night,
Inflamed to Noon, and the fai^ Princess blessed
By the same power; for though his Fate invest
His noble Soul within the obscure Mask
Of an unknown descent, his Fame shall ask
In time to come a Chronicle, and be
The Glory of that royal Family,
From whence he sprung: but ere he must attain
The top of Fortunes Wheel, that Iron Chain,
By whose linkt strength it turns, too often will grate
Him with most hot Afflictions, his wise Fate
Digs deep with Miseries, before it lays
The ground-fork of his Fame, which then shall raise
On the firm Basis of Authentic story,
To him eternal Pyramids of Glory.
Thou that art skilled in Loves Polemmicks here,
Wish they may rest awhile, and though drawn near
A sadder Fate, if pi^y says to rath,
It Is to let sorrow sad the Scean, we will bath
Our Pen awhile in Nectar, though we then
Steep it in Gall again; the Spring did, when
The Princess first did with her presence grace
This house of pleasure, with soft Arms embrace
The Earth his lovely Mistress, clad in all
The painted Robes, the Mornings Dew let fall^
Upon her Virgin Bosom; the soft breath
Of Zephirus sung calm Anthems at the death
Of Palsie-shaken Winter, whose large Grave
The Earth, whilst they in fruitful tears did leave,
Their pious grief turned into smiles, they throw
Over the Hearse a Vail of Flowers, the low
And pregnant Valleys sweld with fruit, whilst Heaven
Smiled on each blessing its fair hand had given.
Be-calmd on this paciffick Sea of pleasure,
No boisterous Wave appearing, the rich treasure
Of Love, being ballast with Content, did fear
No threatening storm, so safe a Harbor near,
As the Object whence it sprung: such royal sports
As take their birth from the triumphant Courts
Of happy Princes, did contract the day
To pitied beauty, time steals away
On downy feet, whose loss since it bereaves
Them of no more then what new birth receives,
From the next teeming day, by none is thought
Worth the lamenting; sometimes rockt in the soft
Arms of the calmest pleasures, they behold,
A sprightly Comedy, the sins unfold
Of more corrupted times, then in its high
Cothurnal Sceans, a lofty Tragedy
Erects their (...), and does at once invite
To variou^ Passions, So^^ow and Delight.
Time (Motions a^ed (...)) includes
Not more in all the (...),
Then their often changing (...)
When the Suns lofty pride (...)
The Earths imbroiderd Robes, (...)
And palsy hand did those fresh (...)
Up in her hoary Plush, each Seas^^ (...)
Delights of 'ts own, such a beguiled (...)
Its stock of hours unwasted on, in chaste,
Though private sports, here happy Lovers (...)
Fancie's fresh Youth, whose first attempts did pro^^
Too innocent for the Sophistry of Love;
There scornful beauty, or the envious eye
Of jealous Rivals nere afflicts, all by
An equal and a noble height so blessed,
Pride none had raised, nor poverty deprest.

The ARGUMENT.
IX.
Whilst serene Joy sat smiling in her Court,
As shadows to illustrate Virtue by
Fantastic Love becomes the Princess sport,
Whose harsher Dictates she ere long must try.
X.
For now Suspicion (Virtues secret Foe)
Fired with Argalia's just deserved Fame,
Makes her great Father think each Minute slow,
Till separation had allayd the Flame.
LEst that her Court, which seems composed of all
That Is great, or good, th'ore-weaning world should ca^
Perfections height, a word which whilst on Earth,
(Vain as delight) only from Name takes birth,
In this, the largest and most glorious sphere,
Ere Greatness moved in, some few Stars appear,
To Virtue retrograde, the informing Spirit
(Love) by whose motion, on the Pole of Merit,
This bright Orb turned, even amongst these Heroes finds
A pair of Followers, whose imperfect minds
Transgrest his Dictates, and though no offense
So full of guilt, as foul Incontinence,
Durst here approach, by ways less known unto
What Love intends, those various Figures drew,
Whose Aspects nere more near Conjunction move,
Then Eyes, the slight Astronomy of Love.
That new Platonnick Malady, the way
By which imperfect Eunuchs do betray
Natures Diseases to contempt, whilst by
Such slight repast, they strive to satisfy
Loves full desires, which pines, or else must crave
More then thin Souls in separation have;
Being lately by some sick Phantasticks brought,
But near the Court, within it long had sought
For residence, till entertaind by two
Whose meeting Souls no more distinction knew,
Then Sex, a difference which whilst here it grows,
Toward Heaven, it to Corporeal Organs ows.
But since that these so uncouth Actors here,
But as Intruders on the Scean appear,
Ere in their story we ingulph too far,
Let Us first behold them in their Character:
If ere thy sober Reason did submit,
To suppling Mirth (that wanton Child of wit)
Beholding A Fantastic, dressed in all
His vain delights, what is Annalogical
To our Acretius, then conceive thou'st seen,
Though if compared, those short to him had been,
As Transcripts are to Coppies; to complete
A Humorist here, Folly had close a seat,
Amongst more then vulgar knowledge, and might pass
The same account, an Academick Ass
Makes of his Fathers four year Charge, when he
Frights Villagers with shreds of Sophistry.
Amongst foreign parts, of which like Coriate,
He Would run through some, he had acquired to prate
By privilege, and as if every Nation
Contributed, is in each several fashion;
Which (like their Tongues) all so imperfect find,
That both disguised his body and his mind;
Though self conceit (vain Youths fantastic Crime)
Made him steal singly from the Front of time,
In The Medium, which but seldom proves the seat,
For Lust's wildfire, or Zeals reflected heat,
He amarous grows, and doubting to prevail,
For all his Wings caught Pegasus by the Tail;
And being before with Cupidi Engines fit'd,
From his Posteriors doubly was inspi^'d.
She that at first this sympathetick flame,
Inspired him with the Court, knew by the Name
Of Philanta, to whom all would impair
Their skill, that gave that Epithet of fair
Except Acretius, since her beauty fit
For praises was, where paralleled by wit.
Yet, now, although times sad discovery tells
Her Autumes furrows were no parallels,
In Beauties sphere, those youthful forms being grown
So obsolete, scarce the Vestigia's shown
A Native pride, and strange fantastic dress,
More admiration then ere comeliness
Could do, acquires: She formerly had been
A great Admirer of Romances, in
Whose Garb she now goes dressed; a medly piece,
Made up of India, Turkey, Persia, Greece,
With other Nations, all enforced to be
Comprised within five foots Stenography.
Her Wit that had been critical, and ranged
Amongst Ladies more then the Ushers legs, was changed,
To gratify, and every word she said,
An Apothegme unto the Chambermaid,
From whom her long experienced knowledge in
Some of the female mysteries of sin,
Had gained the applause of being skilled in all
That could prevent decaying Beauties fall.
Acratius and she, being such a pair,
As Nature, when tired with more serious care,
For Recreation made, instructed by
Their meeting Natures secret sympathy;
Soon learn to love, but as if now too wise
For Youths first dictates, Loves loose Rules comprize
In such strick bounds, that each the Object saw
Of their desires, like sacred things, some Law,
Fear made obeyed, forbids the world to use,
Least the Adored, enjoyment should abuse
Into contempt, nor are their meetings in
Those plainer paths (which their nice Art calls sin)
At all performd, that the dull road unto
The Bridal Bed; this the fantastic Clew
To a delight, which does in Labyrinths sit,
None ere beheld, while they preserved their wit.
Like wanton Jove committing secret Rapes
On mortal Beauties, they transmute their shapes,
At every inter-view, now in adress
Resembling an Arcadian Shepherdess;
She in the Woods encounters him, whilst he
Armed like a furious Knight, resolved to be
Her Ravisher approaches, but being by
Her prayers charmd into pity, there does ly,
Fetterd in soft Embraces; now he must
Turn Hermit, and be tempted unto Lust,
By her a Lady errant; like distressed
Lovers, whose hopes by rigid Friends oppressed,
Pines to despair, they now are wandering in
Unhanted Groves, whose pensive shades had been,
So often their shady Vail, that every Tree,
In wreaths where Love lay wrapped in mystery,
Held their included Names, a subtle way,
To the observant Courties to betray
Their serious folly, which, from being their own
Delight, was now the sport oth' Pages grown;
The pleasant Offsprings of whose wanton wit,
Disturbs their peace, that though secured they fit,
In shady Deserts, with as much of fear,
As wandering Ladies, when the Giants near,
They Are still possessed; less tertible were all
The dreadful Objects Ammadis de Gaul,
Or wittier Quixote, from their Enemies
Ere met, then was the fear of a surprise,
By those which did such strict observance take,
They thus their folly the Courts laughter make.
Near to the Islands utmost Verge did lie
Retired even from Heavens universal Eye,
A deep, dark Vale, whose Night-concealing shade,
By a fresh Rivers silver stream was made
So sweetly cool, it often did invice,
Pharonnida to meet the smooth delight
Of calm retirement there, where to impart
With Natures Bounty all that liberal Art
Though fit for so remote a pleasure, stood,
A Grotto where, the Macrocosmes cold blood,
Run more dispersed in various Labyrinths then
It circulates within the Veins of men.
Hither the inventive Lovers, who long sought
Some way which Fancy nere her Followers taught,
TO express their serious folly in, repair,
Often as the Sun made the insalubrious Air,
Unfit for public walks; to entertain
Them here, with what exceeded all their vain
Delights before, newly erected by
Succesful Art, each various Deity,
Old Fancy placed the Seas Commanders, here
They with delight behold, but when drawn near,
They saw in the midst oth' blew-ey'd Tritons placed
Neptune and The^^s Chariot, yet not graced
With their unfinisht figures: this they took,
For so much favor, as they had forsook
Their Thrones to give them place, but what adds yet
More to the future mirth, they swiftly fit
Themselves with Habits, such as Art had drew
Its Fancies in, both of their Robes being blew;
Inchac'd with silver streams, their heads with fair
Disheveled Perrywigs of Seagreen hair;
Were both adornd, circling whose Crowns they wore,
Wreathd Coronets of Flags, his right hand bore
A Golden Trident here (yet hardly red)
As if new plucked from the Seas froathy Bed,
A branch of Corral: but whilst here they sit
Proudly adornd, both void of Fear, as Wit;
The Gates oth' Grotto, swiftly shutting in
A Torrent, such as if they would seated been
At Niles loud Chataracts, by ways before
Unseen break forth, by which the Engine bore
From its firm station, flotes aloft, and by
A swift withdrawing of those Bays, which rye
Floods from commerce, is wafted forth into
A spacious Pool, where the bold Artist drew
The unfathomed Seas Epitomy, within
A circling Wall, but such as might have been
A pattern to Romes big bulk'd pride, when they
Showed Seas loud Battles, for the Lands soft play.
Our amorous Humorists, that must now appear,
These narrow Seas Commanders, shook with fear,
Sit trembling, whilst the shril-voic'd Tritons sound
Their crooked Shells, whose watery Notes were drowned
By the lofty laughter of that Troop, they saw
Their pleased Spectators; for Pharonnida,
Being now with all her beauteous Train come to
Behold this Pageant, taught them how to view
A shame as dreadful as their fear, which yet
Was full of horror, for though safe they sit
In The floating Chariot, yet the mounting Waves,
So boisterous grew, that even great Neptune craves
Himself relief, till f^ighted from all sense,
By second dangers, from that Port from whence
They sallied forth, two wel-rig'd Ships are now
Seen under Sail, whose actions taught them how
Sea Fights are managed, in a method that
They being too near engaged to tremble at,
By fears slow conduct, to confusion led,
Fall from their Thrones, and through the Waves had fled
From shame to death, had they not rescued been,
By swift Relief, a Courtesy that in
Its first approach, though welcomed when they come
To stand the shock oth' Courts loud mirth, as dumb,
As were the Fishes, they so late forsook,
Makes Mercy court them in a dreadful look.
But leaving these to pay with future hate,
Each Courtiers present mirth, a sadder fate
Commands my Pen no longer to attend
On smooth Delights, before it gives an end
To that Ephemera of pleasure, which
Whilst a free Conversation did enrich
Their thoughts too fast did ripen in the breast
Of both our royal Lovers, whose Fate rests
Not longin downy slumbers, ere it starts
In vain Phantasmaes, Hope her self departs
In a distracted trembling, their bright sphere
Of milder Stars, had now continued clear;
So long, till what their smiling Influence drew,
From the unthankful Earth, contracted to
A vail of Clouds, whose coolness whilst some praised,
Obscured those beams, by which they first were raised.
Hels subtle Embrioes, the Ingratitudes
Of cursed Amphibia, whose disguise includes
Mischiefs Epitome, had often struck
In secret at their envied joys, which took
Nere its effects till now, so heavenly free
The verteous Princess was, from what could be
Of him to vice, she knew not to mistrust
It in another, but thinks all as just
As her own even thoughts, wherefore without
Oppressing of her Soul with the least doubt
Raised from suspicion, she dares let her see
She loved Argalia, though it could not be,
Yet counted more then what his Merits might
Claim as Desert, but this small beam of light.
Through the Prospective of suspicion, to
Envies malignant Eye conveyed, to do
An Act, informs the cursed Amphibia, that
Makes Love lament, for what she triumphed at;
Since Virtue (Heavens unspotted Character)
On the beloved Argalia did transfer
Merits of too sublime a height to be
Shadowed with vice, from that Flowers fragrancie
She sucks her Venom, and from what had built
His Glory, now intends to raise his Guilt;
For though the Prince no Engines need to move,
His Passions Frame, but just Desert, his Love,
Her close endeavors are to heighten't by
Praises, that make Affection jealousy,
Whose Venom, having once possessed his Soul,
It swiftly does (like fatal Charms) control
Reasons fair Dictates, and although no fear
From such wel-order'd Actions could appear
To strengthen it, Argalia's Merits caused
Some sad and sullen doubts, such as when pauf'd
Awhile upon, resolve their Cure must be
Their Cause removed, though in that Action he
From his Breasts royal Mansion, does exclude
The noblest Virtue, generous Gratitude.
My worthless Fortune with, will but prepare
Our future happiness, the time we spare
From feeding on Ambrosia, will increase
Our wealthy store, when the white Wings of peace
Shall bear us back with Victory; there may
Through the dark Chaeos of my Fate display
Some beam of Honor, though compared with thine,
(That Element of living flames) it shine
Dim as the pale-faced Moon, when she lets fall
Through a dark Grove her beams: thy Virtues shall
Give an Alarm to my sluggish Soul,
When ere it drops; thy Memory control
The weakness of my Passions: When we strive
In The heat of glorious Battle, I Will revive
My drooping Spirits, with that harmony
Thy Name includes; thy Name, whose memory
(Dear as those Re^icks a protecting Saint
Sends humble Vot'ries) mentions, will acquaint
My thoughts with all that is good, then calm again,
This Conflict of thy fears, I shall remain
Safe in the Hail of Death, if guarded by
Thy pious Prayers; Fates Messengers, that fly
On wings invisible, will lose the way
Aimed at my breast, if thou vouchsafe to pray
To Heaven for my protection. -- But if we
Nere meet again, yet -- oh yet, let me be
Sometimes with pity thought on, at which word,
His ore-charg'd Eyes no longer could afford
A Room to entertain their Tears; both wept,
As if they strove to quench that fire which kept
Light in the Lamps of Life, whose Fortunes are
In The House of Death, whilst Mars the regal Star.
Some time in silent sorrow spent, at length
The fair Pharonnida recovers strength,
Though Sighs each Accent interrupted to
Return this Answer, Wilt, oh will thou do
Our infant Love such injury to leave
It ere full grown: When shall my Soul receive
A comfortable smile to cherish it,
When thou art gone; they are but dull Joys that sit
Enthroned in fruitless wishes: yet I could
Part with a less expense of sorrow, would
Our rigid Fortune only be content
With absence, but a greater punishment
Conspires against us, danger must attend
Each step thou treadst from hence, and shall I spend
Those hours in mirth? each of whose minutes lay
Wait for thy life; when Fame proclaims the day,
Wherein your Battles join, how will my fear
With doubtful Pulses beat, until I hear
Whom Victory adorns? Or shall I rest
Here without trembling, when lodged in thy breast,
My heart's exposed to every danger that
Assails thy Valor, and is wounded at
Each stroke that lites on thee, which absent, I
Prompted by fear to Myriads multiply.
-- But these are Fancies Wildfi^es, we in vain
Do spend unheard Orizons, and complain
To unrelenting Rocks, this Night peect Scrol,
This Bill of our Divorcement does inrole
Our Names in sable Characters, naught will
Expunge till death obliterate our Ill.
Oh do not (dear Commandress of my Heart)
Argalia answers, let our moist eyes part
In such a Cloud as will for ever hide
Hopes brightest Beams, those Deities that guide
The secret motions of our Fate, will be
More merciful, then to twist Destiny
In such black Threads, should Death unravel all
The feeble Cordage of our Lives, we shall
Spite of that Prince of Terrors, in the high
And glorious Palace of Eternity,
Being met again, renew that Love, which we
On Earth were forced, before Maturity
Had ripened it to Leaves; in the numerous throng
Of long departed Souls, that stray among
The Mirtles in Elysium, I will find
Thy Virgin Ghost; and whilst the Rout inclined
To sensual pleasures here, refining are,
In purging Flames laugh at each envious Star,
Whose Aspects, if ill cited at our Brith,
With poisonous Influence blasts the Joys of Earth.
Oh wast not (cries the Princess) dear time in
These shadows of Conceit, the Hours begin
To be amongst those inserted, that have tried
The Actions of the World, which must divide
Us from our Joy; the Sea through which we sail
Works high with woe, nor can our prayers prevail
To calm its angry Brow; the glorious Freight
Of my unwelcome Honors hangs a Weight
Too ponderous on me for to steer the way,
Thy humbler Fortunes do, else ere I Would stay
To mourn without thee, I would rob my Eyes
Of peaceful slumbers, and in course disguise,
(Whilst Love my Sex's weakness did control)
Command my Body to attend my Soul:
My Soul, my dear, which hovering near thee, not
Midnight alarums, that appear begot
By truth should startle; 'twixt the clamorous Camp,
Lightened with Cannons, and the peaceful Lamps,
That undisturbed here wastes its Oil, I know
No difference, but what does from Passion flow:
Whose close Assaults do more afflict us far,
Then all the loud impetuous storms of War.
We must, we must, replies Argalia, stand
This Thunder bolt unmoved, since his Command,
Whose Will confirms our Law; happy had we
Great Princess been, if in that low degree,
From whence my Infancy was raised, I yet
Had lived a toiling Rural, then when fit
For Himens pleasures, uncontrol'd I Would took
Some homely Village Girl, whose Friends could look
After no Jointure, for to equallize
Her Portion but my love; no jealous Eyes
Had waited on our Meetings, we had made
All our Addresses free; the friendly shade
Cast from a spreading Oak, as soon as she
Had milkt her Cows, had proved our Canopy,
Where our unpollisht Courtship had a Love,
As chaste concluded, as from the amorous Dove,
Pearcht near us we had learnt it; when arrived,
Unto Loves Zenith, we had undepriv'd,
By disagreeing Parents soon been led,
To Church by the sprucest Swains; our Marriage Bed,
Though poor and thin, would have been neatly dressed
By rural Paranymphs, clad in the best
Wool their own Flocks afforded; in a low
And humble Shed, on which we did bestow
Naught but our labor to erect, we might
Have spent our lusty youth with more delight
Then glorious Courts are guilty of, And when
Age had decayed our strength, grown up to men
Beheld our large course issue. Our days ended
Unto the Church been solemnly attended
By those of our own Ra^k, and buried been
Near to the Font that we were Christened in.
Whilst I in russet Weeds of poverty
Had spun these course Threads, shining Majesty
Would have exhausted all her stock to Frame,
A match for thy Desert; some Prince whose Name
The neighboring Regions trembled at, from whom
The generous Issue of thy fruitful Womb,
Might have derived a stock of Fame to build
A future Greatness on, such as should yield
Subject^ of wonder to the World. About
To interrupt him, ere he had drawn out
This sad Theme she began to speak, but by
Nig^ts swift approach was hindered; now drew nigh
The time of his departure: whilst he bleeds,
At thought oth' first, a second S^mmons speec^s
His preparations to the City, where
That big bulkt body, unto which his care
M^st add a Soul, was now drawn up, and stayed,
Only to have his wished Commands obeyed.
His powerful Passion, Loves strict Rules respecting,
More then bright Honors Dictates, yet neglecting
All summons stayed him, till he would sacrificed
His Vows to her, whose every smile he prized,
Above those trivial Glories; Ere from hence
He dares depart, each with a new expense
Of Tears, pays interest to exacting Fate,
For every Minute she had lent of late,
Unto poor Love, whose stock since not his own
Although no Spend-thrift is a Bankrupt grown.
Look how a bright and glorious Morning, which
The youthful Brow of April does enrich,
Smiles, till the rude Winds blow the troubled Clouds
Into her Eyes, then in a black Vail shrouds
Her self, and weeps for sorrow; so wept both
Our royal Lovers, each would, and yet was loath
To bid farwell, till stubborn time enforced
Them to that Task; first his warm Lips divorced
From the soft balmy touch of hers; next parts
Their hands, those frequent witnesses oth' heart's
Indissoluble Contracts: last, and worst,
Their eyes, -- their weeping eyes, (oh Fate accursed,
That lays so hard a task upon my Pen,
To write the parting of poor Lovers) when
They had even lost their light in tears, were in
That shade, that dismal shade, forced to begin
The progress of their sorrow; he is gone,
Sweet, sad Phoronnida left -- left alone,
To entertain grief in soft sighs, whilst he
Amongst noise and tumult, often finds time to be
Alone with sorrow, though encompast by
A numerous Army, whose brave Souls ^weld high,
With hopes of Honor, least Fames Trump want breath,
Have to supply't by Victory, or death.
But ere calmd thoughts to prosecute our story,
Salute thy Ears with the deserved Glory
Our marshal Lovers purchased here, I must
Let my Pen rest awhile, and see the rust
Scoured from my own Sword, for a fatal day
Draws on those gloomy hours, whose short steps may
In Britains blushing Chronicle write more
Of sanguine Guilt, Newberies second Fight.
then a whole Age before:
To tell our too neglected Troops that we
In a just Cause are slow, we ready see
Our rallied Foes, nor will it our sloathful Crime
Expunge, to say, Guilt wakend them betime,
From every Quarter, the affrighted Scout
Brings swift Alarums in, hovering about
The clouded tops of the adjacent Hills,
Like ominous Vapors lie their Troops, noise fills
Our yet unrallied Army, and we now
Grown legible, in the contracted Brow,
Discern whose heart looks pale with fear: If in
This rising storm of blood, which does begin
To drop already, I Am not washed into
The Grave, my next safe Quarter shall renew
Acquaintance with Pharonnida, till then,
I leave the Muses to converse with men.
The end of the second Book.
PHARONNIDA. The third Book. A Tragi-comicall POEM.
CANTO THE FIRST.
The ARGUMENT.
I.
Beneath the powerful Tyranny of Love,
Whilst the fair Princess weeps out every Star,
In Pleasures Sphere, those dark Clouds to remov^,
All royal Pass-times in it practiced are.
II.
Amongst whose Tryumphs, that her Train might lend
Her their Attendants in the shades of Grief;
Passion brings some so near a fatal end,
That timely pity scarce affords relief.
SOme Months now spent, since in the clouded Court
Of sad Pharonnida, each Princely sport
Was with Argalia's absence maskt within
Sables of Discontent, Robes that had been
Of late her chiefest Dress; no cheerful smile
Ere cleerd her brow, those walks which were ere while;
The Schools where they disputed Love, were now
Only made use of, when her grief sought how
To hide its treacherous tear,; the unfil'd Bed
Oth' Widow, whose conjugal joy is fled,
In The hot and vigorous youth of Fancy, to
Eternal absence, sooner may renew,
(Though she for tears, repeated praises seeks)
The blooming spring of Beauty on her Cheeks.
When bright plumed Day on the expanded wings
Of Air approaches, Lights fair Herald brings
No overtures of peace to her; each prayer
In pious zeal she makes, a pale despair
In their Celestial Journey clogs; but long
Her feeble Sex could not endure these strong
Assaults of Passion, ere the red and white
Vanquished from Beauties Throne, had took their flight,
And naught but melancholy palness lest
TO attend the light of her dim eyes, bereft
Of all their brightness; pining Agues in
The earthquake of each Joint, leaving within
The Veins, more blood then dwelt in hers, which bea^
The hearts slow motions with a hectic heat.
Long Passions Tyrant reigns not, ere this change
Of Mirth and Beauty, letting sorrow range
Beyond the circle of Discretion, in
Her Father that suspicion which had been
Kindled before renewing, he removes
His Court to hers, but the kind visit proves
A Paroxisme unto that strong Disease,
Which combats in her blood, no mirth could please
Her troubled Soul, since barred society,
With all its better Angels, gone to be
Attendant on Argalia; she beholds
Those studied pleasures, which the Prince unfolds
His love and greatness in, with no delight
More smooth then that a sullen Anchorite,
Which a harsh vow has there enforced to dwell,
Sees the cold wants of his unhaunted Cell.
Amongst these sports, whose time betraying view
Ravished each pleased Spectator, the fair Clew,
Contracts some sable knots, of which my Pen
Is only one bound to unravel; when
War had unclasp'd that dreadful Book of hers,
Where honored Names in sanguine Characters,
Brave valor had transcribed, fair virtue fixed
Euriolus in Honors Orb, and mixed
Him with the Courts bright Stars; but he who had
Whilst unregarded poverty had clad
His virtues in obscurity, learnt how
To sail in Fortunes boisterous storms, is now
By her false smiles be-calm'd and sunk, before
Desert (bound thither) touched Loves treacherous shore.
In The playful freedom of their youth, when she
Was only a fair Shepherdess, and he
An humble Swain, he truly did adore
The fair Florenza, but aspired no more,
Since Poverty clogged Loves ambitious wing,
Then by his private Muse alone to sing
Her praise with, such a flame of wit, that they
Which have compared, say envied Lau^a may
Look pa^e with spleen, to hear those Li^es expressed,
Though in her great Platonicks Raptures dressed.
But now his Worth by Virtue raised, did dwell
High as his Hopes, and that a Parallel
To hers appearing, eithers Merits had
A Climax to preferment, and thus clad
Virtue in Honors Robes, which equal Fate,
Gave his Affection Language to relate,
What their Disparity kept dumb, nor did
Those Motions find acceptance, such as hid
Them for presumption, rather 'twas a Frost
Of Virgin Ice, then fire of pride that crossed
His Masculine Desires, her Eyes unfold
So much of Passion, as by them she told
Who had most interest in her Heart, which she
From all brave Rivals his resolves shall be.
Amongst those, Mazara, one, whose noble blood
Enriched the Gems of Virtue, though they stood
In Honors Altitude, was chief, nor could
A nobler Choice, were her Affections ruled
By Worth, commend her Judgment, his fresh youth
Being Crowned with Virtues which might raise a truth,
Above Hyperboles, his Nature mild,
As was the Gaulless Dove, yet not the wild
And furious Lion, when provoked could have
More daring Valor, an untimely Grave,
Whilst it in the Embrio was, to every Vice,
But unto Virtue a fair Paradise;
Whose weedless Banks no pining Winter knew,
Till Death the Iufluence of warm Life withdrew.
That sympathy of meeting Virtues, which
Did both their Souls with equal worth enrich,
'Twixt him, and brave Euriolus had tied
A League not to be broke, could Love divide
His Blessings amongst Friends; But that of all
Our Passions brooks no Rival, fear may call,
Friends to partake of Palsies, Anger strives
To fire each neighboring Bosom, Envy thrives
By being transplanted; but a Lovers pure
Flames, though converted to a Calenture,
Unwillingly with the least flame will part,
Although to thaw another frozen heart.
Few amongst the observant Wits oth' Court yet knew
(Though it with twisted Eye-beams strengthend grew,
At every interview, and often dropped
Some Tears to water it) whose Love 'twas stopped,
Mazara's Suit, Euriolus to her
Whose melting pity only could confer
A Cure, unlocks the Secrets, whilst the other
More confident to win, nere strives to smoother
A Passion so legitimate, but by
All actual Complements, declares how high
He prized her Virtues, but this Worthies Fate,
Fixed him in Loves intemperate Zone, too late
^he pining Fruit was sown, the Spring so far
Being spent, its days were grown Canicular;
Schortching all hopes, but what made able were
By fruitful Tears Loves April Showers, to bear
Neglects untimely Frosts, which often have lost
In bloomy Springs, the unhappy Lovers cost.
When this accomplished Youth, whose Tongue and Pen
With Negatives more firm and frequent, then
Cursed Usurers give impoverisht Clients, often
Had been repulsed, truth for discovery brought
This Accident, within the royal Court
Of bright Pharonnida, a full Resort
Of valiant Knights were met, convened to try,
Whose Valor Fortune meant to glorify;
Of which selected number there was one,
Who though a stranger, Virtue soon made known
To all, 'cause feared of most, his valor had,
Before the first triumphant day unclad
The silver-vested Hemisphear, been often
Cloathd in the Ornaments of Honor, brought
On Fames fair wings from the opposing part
Uncresting them to crown his high desert.
But now, when this new Constellation near
Its Zenith drew, in Honors Hemisphear,
Called thither by deciding Lots, the brave
Euriolus appears, whom Victory gave,
In the first shock success, and placed his Name
In the Meridian Altitude of Fame;
Where, though the valiant stranger prove no Foe,
So fortunately valiant do ore-throw
the structure of his Fate, yet his close Stars
Now sinks a Mine, to which those open Wars
But easy dangers were; Mazara in
His Crest a Scarff, that formerly had been
Known for Florenza's, seeing jealous Love
Converted into Rage, his Passions move
Above the sphere of Reason, and what late
Was but a gentle blaze, by alterd Fate,
Fires to a Comet, whose malignant beams
Foretold sad Ills, attending Loves extremes.
Loath to betray his Passions in so great
A breach of Friendship, to a close Retreat,
Mazara summons forward Rage; yet in
The strangers Name, whose Fortune might have been
The Parent of a private Q^arrel, sends
To call Euriolus, who now attends
Naught but triumphant mirth, ungua^ded by
Applauding Friends, in secret Fight to try,
What power did him from threatening danger guard,
When public Fame was Victories Reward.
This fatal Scroll received, by him that thought
It real truth, since Passion might have sought
In him the same delay, a swift consent
Returns his Answer, but the Message went
So far from its directed Road, that ere
It reached Mazara's, loose Neglect did bear
It to Carina's Ear, a Lady that
In silent tears her heart had offered at
His Virtues Shrine, yet with such secret zeal,
Her Eyes forbid their Cupids to reveal,
That Language of her heart, she knew that in
Florenza's Sea of Merits, hers had been
Shipwrackt and lost, yet with a Soul as far
From envying her, as hating him, this War
Of factious Passions she maintains, and since
Reason now wanted Language to convince
Those headstrong Rebels, she resolves to be
Though ruined, ruld by their Democracy.
The Information her officious Maid,
Had from Mazara's careless Page betrayed;
Assures Carina the preceding Night,
Such Horse and Armor as the stranger Knight,
Euriolus had conquered in, had been
By his most cautious diligence within,
A (not far distant Wood) in whose black shade
He meant his Fury should his Foe invade:
Lodged by his Master, which discoverd truth,
Frighting her tears from the swift chase of Youth,
And Beauty into froward Age, to meet
Sorrow in private shades, withdraws the sweet
But sad Carina, who resolves to spend
Her sighs unnoted by her dearest Friend.
This in Florenza, who foresaw that naught,
But Passions more then common, could have wrought
So swift a change, works high, who that she might
Dis-plume these Ravens, ere the Babes of Light,
Smile in their weeping Mothers Face, prepares
To see Carina, who with wakeful cares,
Her sad Companions by her friend surpised,
No longer in their Ebbon Vail disguised
Her thoughts pure candor; but with looks that did
Seem to implore Assistance, whilst they chid
Her own indulgent Nature, shows her how
Preposterous Love made her to Passions bow,
Whose fruit, since none of her first Planters came
From forward man, could be but female shame.
This (with its fatal Author) known to free
Her Friend from shame, her self from cruelty,
Unto Mazara whose firm Love attends
Her least Commands, incenst Florenza sends,
Whose zeal transported Soul no sooner hears
That welcome sound, but though presaging fears,
Prompt him to stay, least haughty honor fall
Ruined by Fame, be lets her Standards fall
Before commanding Love, and goes to wait
On's honored Mistress; but this sly deceit
Of hope, no Cordial proves, unto the sad
Carina's grief, the long experience had
Of his Affection to Florenza tells
Her doubtful Soul, those even Parallels
Could not by all her Friends persuasions be
Wrested into the least obliquity;
Which sad mistrust did Love precipitate,
On paths whose danger frights protecting Fate.
Assured the Combats hour drew on, and that
Mazara's lovesick Soul was offering at
Florenza's Shrine, and by that willing stay,
Might be enforced some Minutes to delay
The time, in which his readier Opposite,
Expected him, she being resolved to write
Affection in her blood, with Loves wild have,
Makes toward the Lists, there finds his Armor placed
Within the dark shade of an ancient Wood,
In whose black breast that place of horror stood,
Where they appoint to meet, like those of Fate,
Obscure and dark by Beasts and Birds, that hate
The Light alone frequented; but love had
Dis-plum'd fears Haggars, being resolved she clad
Beauties fair Pearl, where smooth delights did dwell,
In The rough-cast Mould of that Ciclopian shell.
But that no Arms, nor bounding Steeds affright,
Where Loves fair hand has Valors pasport wright,
Here we should pause, and pity her that now
Fancy beholds, whilst she is learning how,
To manage stubborn steel, within her sleek
And pollisht hand, through devious paths to seek
For doubtful dangers, such whose horrid shape,
On man's best judgment, might commit a Rape.
Her swift Conductor Love, ere this had brought
Her to the place, where Passion had not sought
Long for the Object of her hate, ere she
Her valiant Brother, that was come to be
His Fames Protector sees, but so disguised
In's Arms, that both, with envy unadviz'd,
By knowledge an unthought of guilt prepare,
In blood to meet; their foaming Horses were
Now freed from the commanding Rain, and in
Their full Carier; but Love in vain to win
The Field from Valor strives, her eager have
But argues such an envy as did wast
It self in weak Attempts, which to the length
Of power extended, falls beneath the strength
Of her Victorious Foe, whose Fortune had
In Robes of Joy, what he must weep for clad.
Conquered Carina now dismounted lay,
Struggling for life, whose Fortress to betray
Toward Natures Tyrant Death, her blood transports
False Spirits through their purple Salliports.
Her Brother with an Anger that was grown
Into disdain, his Fury should be shown,
On such resistless Subjects, ere he knows
How much of grief his Soul to sorrow owes,
For this unhappy Act, froms finished course
Was now returning, not by strength to force
The harsh Commands of Tyrant Victors, but
By calm advice, a bloodless end to put,
To that ill-manag'd Quarrel: but before
He there arrives, to make his sorrows more,
When truth unvails their dark design, a Knight
With have as speedy as the secret flight
O^ wrath, when winged from angry Heaven, he saw
Bolted into the Lists, who soon did draw
Too near in sober Language to dispute
Their fatal Quarrel, both, with Rage grown mute
Disdaining conference, found no place for words,
Amidst the mortal Language of their Swords;
Which, the first shock past over, and Lances broke,
In have took place, and at each furious stroke,
Unbay'd the Fountains of their blood, to stain
With purple guilt the Flower-enamel'd Plain.
Whilst each did thus with silent Rage employ,
An Art directed Fury to destroy
The others strength, the bordering shadows weep,
In trickling Dews, and with sad murmures keep
Time with the hollow, and ill boding Note,
Sent from a fatal Ravens stretcht-out Throat;
Which from an old Oaks witherd top did sing
A baleful Dirg; but these sad Omens bring
No terror to their busy thoughts, which were
Too much imployd in Action, to take care
For any danger more remote, then what
With the next stroke might fall; perceiving that
Their Horses faint, they both dismount, and do
On equal terms the Fight on foot renew,
Till a Cessation from the want of breath,
Not Valor was en^orc'd: the Vail which death
Contracted from those steams, his wreaking blood
Breathd forth its Spirits in already stood,
Over Mazara's Eyes, which clouded se^s
Not that approach of Night; his trembling Knees
S^agger beneath their fainting Load, which in
To the Grave had dropped, had not their fury bin
When its last heat was with Life's flame near spent
From further Rage, restraind by accident.
Some of the lost Carina's frighted Friends,
Fearing those Ills which desperate Love attends,
Spending that Morning in the fruitless Quest,
Of her had been, and now (their hopes distressed
With vain inquiries) to communicate,
Their Grief returning were, which secret Fate,
To interpose, through dark Meanders brought,
Neglect to find what care in vain had sought.
Whilst yet no more then brave humanity,
Prompts them to part a Quarrel that might be
Defiled with blood, which if not shead in Wars,
With Murder stains, what it does guild with Scars:
They toward them have, even in that critical
And dangerous Minute, when Mazara's fall,
With Vict'ries Laurels to adorn his Crest,
His valiant Friend had robbed of future rest,
Had not this blessed relief of Innocence,
The one from death, the other from expense
Of tears restraind, before Revenge had found
So much of Guilt as might his Conscience wound.
His high wrought Rage stopped by too many hands,
To vent its heat, Euriolus now stands,
Shook with the Fever of his anger, till
Those Friends which saw Mazara grown so ill
With wounds, to gasp for breath, by giving way
For air, they to the Victors view betray
His best of Friends, at which afflicting sight,
Cursing the cause of that unhappy fight;
His Sword as guilty thrown aside, he hasts
To his Relief, in which kind act none wastes
Their friendly help, Life, as but stolen from pain,
Behind the Vail of death appears again
On Natures Frontiers, whose returning flame,
Though scarce of strength to warm, looked red with shame,
When he so many wel-known Friends beheld,
Sad Witnesses, how much his passion sweld
Above the Banks, where Reason should have stayed,
When to that meeting it his Friend betrayed.
Their Vails of steel removed, each now beholds,
What shame and wonder in firm Contracts folds.
Amazed stands brave Euriolus to see,
None but his Friend, his honored Friend should be
The Parent of that Quarrel, shame confounds
Mazara more, and from internal wounds
(Though like the red Seas Springs his other bled)
Perhaps less danger, but more torment bred.
Both now by his unforced confession knew
Whose equaled honored Beauty 'twas that drew
Them to this fatal Combat, whose event
Him near the Grave on Loves vain Errant sent.
Friendship renewd in strickt Embraces, they
Are now arrived, where weak Carina lay,
So faint with Loves Phlebotomy, that she,
Maskt in forgetful slumbers could not see
Approaching shame, which when discoverd sticks
Life's fair Carnations on her death-like Cheeks.
Hasting to see, what over-forward Rage,
That unknown strangers weakness did engage,
In that unhappy Quarrel they beheld,
At the first glance an Object that expeld,
Into the shades of Sorrows Wilderness,
All temperate thoughts, his Sisters sad distress
Wrought by his Arm, whose strength betrayed her near
The Grave, did to Euriolus appear,
Dreadful, as if some treacherous friend had shown
Those flames in which his scor^cht Companions groan.
Nor did Mazara, though but prompted by
Pity (that tender Child of sympathy)
With less relenting sorrow live to see,
Loves bloody Trophies, though unknown to be
By his victorious Beauty reard; to save
From the cold grasp of an un^imely Grave,
So ripe a Virgin, whilst her Brother stands
Unnerv'd with grief, amongst the helpful hands
Of other Friends are his imployd, till by
Their useful aid; fled Life returns to try,
Once more the Actions of the world, before
It shot the Gulf of Death; but on the shore
Of active Nature, was no sooner set,
But that (together with the Light) she met
Her far more welcome Lover, whom whilst she
Beholds with trembling, Heaven resolved to free
A suffering Captive, turns his pity to
So much of Passion, as ere long Love grew
On the same Stem, whose Flowers to propagate;
She in these words uncurtains mystic Fate.
For bear your aid brave Sir, and let me die,
Ere live the Author of a P^odigy,
That future times shall curse: yet pardon me,
Dear Brother, Heaven will nere impute to thee,
The guilt of blood, it was my unhappy Love
Which raised this Storm, which if my prayers may prove
In death successful, let me crave of you,
Dear Sir, to whom I long have born a true
But indiscreet affection, that from hence
For poor Carina's sake, for this expense
Of tears and blood, you would preserve those dear
Respects of Friendship, that did once appear
Confirmd betwixt you, and, although my Fate,
Unto the worst of Ills precipitate
My Fame and Life, oh let my name not be
Offensive to your Ear, this, this for me,
Is all you shall perform; which spoke, she would let
Her hovering Soul forth, to have paid the Debt
Of Nature to the Grave, had not she bin
By some assisting Friends, whilst dropping in,
Scayd at the last step, and brought back to meet
The Bridal Pair, no single winding Sheet.
This doubtful Combat ended, they are to
The Court conveyed, where Fame upon this new
Text Commenting, in various Characters
Transcribes her sense; some this bold Act of hers
Term un-becoming Passion, others brave
Heroic love; but what most comfort gave,
To cured Carina, was, that this lost blood,
Had proved Loves Balm, and in a purple flood,
Washed from her heart Grief's sable stains, for now
Merit had taught her dear Mazara how,
To prize her verteous Love, and for its sake
Its Cabinet her hearts best Temple make.
Thus Passions troubled Sea had settled in
A smooth and gentle calm, had there not been
Unhappily, to blast their sweet content,
Not long before an Act for the banishment,
Of all such Courtiers made, as should withont
A License from the Council, fight about
What ever private Quarrel, but not this
Mazara, or his new choice frights; their bliss
Stood on more firm foundations then the Courts
Uncertain Favors were, whose glorious sports
Although he left, it was not to retire
To sullen cares, what Honor could require,
A state which called him her unquestiond Lord,
Without depending favors did afford.
But whilst we leave this noble Lover by
This Mandate freed, from what before did tie
Unto a troublesome Attendance; we
From brave Euriolus are forced to be
With sorrow parted, since the general love,
His Virtue had obtaind, wants strength to move
The ponderous doom; ere his impoverisht heart,
Grown poor in streams, could from Life's springs impart
Warm blood enough for his pale Cheeks to drink
A Health to Beauty, he is enforced to think
Of that sad theme of parting, on whose sense,
His grieved Soul dictates sighs, yet could dispense
Even with its harshest rigor, were there but
Any acception in it, that might put
Out parting with Florenza, that though he
Were shrunk into his former poverty,
(Calling the rugged frowns of Fate) would bear
A Brow unclouded with Ambitions care.
But he must go, not all the Rhetoric
Of tempting Love could plead against the quick
Approach of time, whose speedy motion now,
Only some slippery Minutes did allow
Their parting tears, in whose exalted flood,
Had Reason not with future hopes withstood
The rising stream, Loves Summer Fruits had been
(Ore-whelmd with grief) for ever buried in
A delluge of Despair; but that, whilst she,
With such sad looks, as wintring Scithians see
The Sun hasts toward the Artick Pole, beholds
His slow departure, glimmering hope unfolds
Twylight, which now foretells their frozen fear,
Day may return to Loves cold Hemisphear.
The end of the first Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The third Book. CANTO THE SECOND.
The ARGUMENT.
III.
The Princess by unluckie Accident,
Having Loves secret Embassies betrayed,
To her great Father, by that Action spent
That stock of hope, which promised future Aid.
IV.
His rage being to such rash extremes inflamed,
That he whose Mandates none durst disobey,
As if his power were of such Acts ashamed,
Shrinks from it self, and poorly does betray.
IF angry Aid, the Enemy to Love,
Tells thy grave pride, thy Judgment is above,
What with contempt (although it injure truth)
Thy spleen miscals the vanity of youth.
If harsh employment; gross society,
That feast of Brutes, make thee an Enemy
To love, the Souls Commercive Language, then
Remove thy Eye, whilst my unenvied Pen,
That long to Passion has a Servant been
Confines the fair Pharonnida's within,
These paper limits; frozen still she lies
Beneath opposing Passions, her bright Eyes;
Those Stars whose best of influence scarce had power
To thaw what grief congeald into a shower
Of heart dis-burthening tears, their influence spend
In sorrows polar Circles, and could lend
No light to beauties World; in the vigorous reign
Of this pale Tyrant, whilst she did remain
Unlighten'd with a beam of comfort, in
A Bower being sat, that formerly had been
Her seat, when she heard the unhappy news
Of parting with Argalia; whilst she views
She blames the guiltless shadows, who to ask
Pardon in trembling murmures did unmask
Their naked Limbs, and scatterd at her Feet
The fragrant Vail, in's deathbed sat the sweet
But pining Rose, each Grass its heavy head,
Laden with tears did hang, whilst her Eyes shead
A pattern to instruct them: hence, whilst she
Looks thorough on a way conceived to be
The same her Lo^d marched with his Army, when
He left Girenza, with a have more then
A common Traveler, she sees one post
Toward her Court, whose Visage had not lost
Its room within her Memory, he is known
Argalia's Page, and now each minute grown,
A burden to her thoughts, that did de^er
A nearer interview, the Messenger
Arrives, and to her eager view presents
His Masters Letters, whose enclosed Contents,
Are now the Object, her expecting Soul
Courts with desire, nor does she long control
Their forward have; A Diamond being by
The Messenger returned, whose worth might vie
Price with an Indian Fleet, when it sails slow
With His glittering burden; though each word ore-flow
With joy, whilst her inquisitive discourse,
Was on this pleasing theme, time did enforce
The Pages swift departure, who with all
Affected Epithites, that Love can call
To gild Invention when it would express,
Things more sublime then mortal happiness,
Is gone to carry his expecting Lord,
What pleasure could, when ratified afford.
Whilst this sweet joy was only cloathd in fresh
Blossoms of hope like Souls, ere mixed with flesh
She only by desire subsisted, but
Now to her Chamber come, and having shut
The treacherous door, from the conjugal seal,
The white Lipt paper freed, does soon reveal
Loves welcome Embassies; she reads, and by
Each Line transported to an Ecstasy,
In Fancies wild Meanders lost the way,
She rashly enterd, faint desire would stay
At every word in amorous sighs to breath
A Lovesick groan, but she is yet beneath
The Mount of joy, and must not rest until
Her swift-pac'd eye had climb the flowery Hill,
Which now past lightly over, with an intent
Of a review to its best Ornament,
His Name, she comes, which whilst bathd in the Balm
Of fragrant kisses, from joys gentle calm
She thus is startled, a redoubled groan,
That sign of neighboring sorrow, though unknown
From whence affrights her Soul; but she too soon,
Too sadly knows the Cause; the height of Noon,
Raged in reflected heat, when walking in
Those outer Rooms, her Father long had been
In expectation of her sight; but not
Finding her there, a golden slumber got
The start of's Meditations, to comply
With whose calm council, he did softly ly
Down on a stately Couch, whose glittering pride,
A Curtain from the public view did hide;
Where having plucked from off the wing of time,
Some of her softest Down, the Dews that clime,
In sleep to stop each Ventrickle, begin
To steal a soft Retreat, hovering within
His stretcht-out Limbs, sleeps vapors lie, his hands
Rub from his Eyes those leaden boults that stand
Over their heavy Leads, which scarce was done,
When first surpised Pharonnida begun
To read her Letter, and by that sad chance,
Betray her Love; Passion strove to advance
Her Father from his Lodging, when he first
Heard the discovery, but though anger thirst
For swift Revenge, yet policy persuades
Him to hear further, ere his sight invades
Her troop of Pleasures, whose thin Squadrons broke,
By what sh^'d heard, before she could revoke
Her vanquished spirits, that were fled to seek
Protection in her heart, robbing her Cheek
Of all the blood to waft in; whilst she stands
A burden to her trembling Legs, her hands
Wringing each others Ivory Joints; her bright
Eyes scattering their distracted beams, the flight
Oth' Curtain from her Fathers angry touch,
Discovers whence that groan which caused so much,
Her wonder came; Grief, and amazement strives
Awhile with Love, which soon victorious drives,
Those pale Guests from her Cheeks, unto whose aid,
Her noble heart (secure from being betrayed
By its own strength) did send a quick supply
Of its warm blood, her Conscience knows not why
To fear, 'cause knows no guilt, nor could have been
By Love so verteous, ere drawn near a sin.
But as the Evening blushes for the rude
Winds oth' ensuing day, so fortitude,
Upon the lovely Roses that did grow,
Within her Face a deeper Dye bestow,
Then fear could ere have done, and did presage
The ensuing storms exagitated rage.
Silent with Passion, which his Eyes inflamed
The Prince a while beholds her, ere he blamed
The frailty of Affection, but at length
Through the thick throng of thoughts, armd with a strength
Which crushed the soft smiles of paternal Love,
He thus begins; And must, oh must that prove
My greatest curse on which my hopes ordaind
To raise my happiness? have I refraind
The pleasures of a Nuptial Bed, to joy
Alone in thee, not trembled to destroy
My Name, so that advancing thine I might
Live to behold my Scepter take its flight,
To a more spacious Empire, have I spent
My youth, till grown in debt to Age she'th seen
Diseases to arrest me, that impair
My strength and hopes ere to enjoy an Heir,
Which might preserve my Name, that only now
Must in our dusty Annals live, whilst thou
Transfer'st the glory of our house, on one
Which, had not I warmd into life, had gone
A Wretch, forgotten of the World, to the earth,
From whence he sprung. But tear this monstrous birth
Of Fancy from thy Soul, quick as thou would fly
Descending wrath, if visible, or I
Shall blast thee with my anger, till thy Name
Rot in my Memory, not as the same,
That once thou were behold thee, but as some
Dire Prodigy, which to foreshew should come
All ills, which through the progress of my life
Did chance, were sent; I lost a Queen, and Wife,
Thy verteous Mother, who for her goodness might
Have here supplied, before she took her flight
To Heaven, my better Angels place, have since
Stood storms of strong Affliction, still a Prince
Over my Passions until now; but this
Has proved me Coward: Oh thou do amiss
To grieve me thus fond Girl. With that he shook
His reverend Head, beholds her with a look,
Composed of Grief and Anger, which she sees,
With melting sorrow, but resolved Love frees
Her from more yiedling pity; to begin
The Prologue to obedience, which within
Her breast still dwelt (though swayd by Love) she falls
Prostrate at's feet, to his remembrance calls
Her dying Mothers Will, by whose pale dust,
She now conjures him not to be unjust
Unto that promise, with which her pure Soul
Fled satisfied from Earth as to control
Her freedom of Affection, rather she
Desires her Interest in his Crown might be
Denied her, then the choice of one to sway
It in her right, she urges how it may
Be by his Virtue far more glorified,
Whom she had chose, then if by Marriage ti'd
To any neighboring Prince, who only there
Would rule by Proxi^, whilst his greater care
Secured his own Inheritance; she then
Calls to remembrance wh^ reliv'd him, when
Dist^est within Alcithiu's Walls, the Love
His Subjects bore Argalia, which might prove
Her choice their happiness, with all how great
A likelihood i^ was, but the retreat
O^ Royalty, to a more safe disguise,
Had showed him to their States deluded Eyes,
So mean a thing: Loves b^undless Rhetoric,
About to dictate mo^e, he with a quick
And fu^iou^ have forsakes the Room, his Rage
Thus boiling over; And m^st my wretched Age
Be thus by thee tormented: but take heed
Correct thy Passions, or their Cause must bleed,
Until he quench the flame; at which harsh word
He leaves the room, nor could her strength afford
Her power to rise, which whilst she strives to do,
Her Memory adding more Weights unto
The burden of her thoughts, her ^oul oppressed,
Sinks in a pale Swoon, catching at the rest
It m^st not yet enjoy, swift help lends light,
Though faint and glimering, to behold what Night
Of grief ore-shadow'd her: You that have been
Upon the Wrack of Passion, tortured in
The Engines of forbidden Love, that have
Shed fruitless ^ears, spent hopeless Sighs, to crave
A rigid Parents fair Aspect, conceive
What wild destruction seized her; I must leave
Her Passions Volume only to be read,
Within the breasts of such whose hearts have bled,
At the like dangerous wounds; whilst she sits here
Amazed with grief, know that no smiles appear,
To smooth her Fathers angry b^ow, yet to
None he unfolds his thoughts, but bent to do
What ere his Rage should dictate, to appease
This high-wrought storm, which turned into disease
Each motion of the Brain, he only takes^
Scorn and Revenge, to whose ill counsel shakes
The qu^et of the Soul, to be his Guides
Through those Night-peect Walks, whose shadow (...)
The languisht beams of Love, awhile their strong
Ingredients boil in's blood, before they throng
The scatterd thoughts into a quintessence
Of poisonous Resolutions, first from thence
There sprung this black Disaster to attend
Argalia's Fortune, he does forthwith send
A secret Messenger to the Warlike Prince
Of Siracuse, to let him know that since
He sent those Forces to assist him in
His War, their General, that till late had bin
The darling of his Love, by Arguments
Too strong was proved a Traitor, whose intents
Aymd at his Crown and Life; to aggravate
His spleen the more, he writes him word their Fate,
On the same ominous Pinions flew, if that
He proved succesful, having warmd him at
This flame of Passion, he concludes with; (Sir)
You guess my meaning, I would have no stir,
About dispatching of him, for he is grown
Strong in affection, and may call his own
The hearts of half my Kingdom; let this give
Your Justice power; he is too much loved to live.
The startled Siracusian having read
These bloody Lines, which had not only bred
A new, but nourisht growing envy in
His mighty Soul, a stranger to all sin,
So full of guilt, as to dissemble, till
The new made Generals just deserts did fill
Fames still augmented Volume, and was grown
More legible, then what he called his own.
What in a rival Prince had been a high
And noble Emulation, kindled by
A smaller Star blasts Virtue, he beholds
His lightning Valor, which cach hour unfolds,
Examples for Posterity, destroy
What (though he trembled at) creates no joy
Within his sullen Soul, a secret hate,
By Envy fed, strives to unhinge his Fate,
From off their lofty Pyramids, and throw
What Merit raised, unto a place more low
Then their first step to Glory, yet, whilst naught
But Honor was engaged, disdain nere sought
For life-excluding Corasives; but Love
Bearing a part, two Suns might sooner move
In the same sphere, then that hot Guest endure
A rival Flame, Desert could not secure
Worth thus besieged, yet this accursed intent,
Dares not unvail it self, the Army sent,
By him from fair Gerenza, ere the Sun
Performed his Summers progress, had begun
To Garrison their weary Fort within,
Such Towns as their own Valor first did win,
From the retired Ae^olians, ere this task
Was fully ended, curtaind in the Mask
Of Merits lawful claim reward there came
A large Commission, which Zoranza's Name
Had made authentic, that the Government
Of Ardenna a Town, whose strength had spent
The baffled Foe, whose Fields of blood should be
Conferd on him, by the Vicinity
Of the place, freed from a tedious Journey, in
The City he arrives, and what had bin
Sent from his Prince, presents those Mandates that
Informd the Governor, who frighted at
The strange Commands, lets a pale guilt ore-take
His swift Resolves, till glorious hopes did shake
Those Mourning Robes of Conscience off, and in
The purple Garments of a th^iving sin,
Shadows his trembling Soul, least she appear,
Shook with a cold fit of religious fear.
The discomposure of his look, which did
Appear the birth of Discontent, forbid
Suspicion of a blacker sin; that night,
As being the last of's charge, he did invite
Argalia to remain his Guest: the next
Promising to (...) his, yet seeming vexed,
To leave the place, though only to conceal
His dark d^sign that did it self reveal
To none but some selected Soldiers; by
Whose help he meant to murder him. To vie
I^ benefits with the Days, Night had bestowd
Refreshing slumbers upon all ha^owd
It to the l^st days Labor, when without
Fear of app^oaching danger, hemmed about
With guards of honest Valor, all his Train
Save such as mere necessity de^ain,
Lodged in the City, fearless Argalia in
T^ (...) lies, where having tempted bin
By Midnight Revels, full crowned Cups, to be
Betrayed from Reason to Ebriety:
But naught prevaling, ^e at length is led,
Like an in ended Sacrifice, to the Bed,
Ordaind to be his last, until the Earth
Within her Womb afford him one; the birth
Oth' Morn grew near her slow approach, ere all
Th^s^ Engines, by whose strength they meant his fall
Could be prepared; the Governor that held
The Helm of this black mischief, had expelled
The poisonous Guilt of staining his own Sword
With blood, providing Villains that abhord
No (...) Contagi^n, though Revenge did wait
On every guilty st^p: that Evenings Bait
Their liq^id Mirth had laid, although it took
No use of Reason from his Soul, had shook
Its laboring Facul^ies into a far
More sudden slumber, which composed the War
Of wandering Fancy in a Harmony
Of the Concordant Humors, until by
The sudden noise of those ordaind to be
His Murderers, he wakes; amazed to see
His Chamber so possessed, he catches hold
On one of them, but finds his strength controld,
By the assistance of the ^ther, in
The Embrio of this treachery, ere their sin
Was past to execution, he conjutes
Them to forbear so black a Deed, assures
Them of Rewards, greater then hope could call
A debt from him that basely sought his fal^.
But deadly silence had barred up the Gates
Of every Voice, those cursed Assassinates
Prepared for action were, but Heaven prevents
That aged sin of murdering Innocents,
With Miracles of Mercy. There was found
Not long before an ancient Story crowned,
With a Prophetic Honor, that containd
This sacred truth; ( When Ardenna is staind
With Treachery in F^iendships Vail disguised,
Her sable Tower shall be by Foes surpiz'd.)
This known, but misconceiv'd, to c^zen Fate,
They did unwounded bear without the Gate;
The now resistless Lion that did ly,
Like that brave Prince oth' Forest, fetterd by
A crew of trembling Hunters; to the brow
Of an high Promontory, that did bow
Its black Clifts over the clamorous Waves, they had
Conveyed the noble Youth; the place a sad
And dismal horror wore, the grim aspects
Of louring Rocks, the grey-ey'd Sea reflects,
In ugly glaring beams, the Night-Raven beats
His ^ufty Wings, and from their iquallid seats,
The baleful Scriek-Owls fly to bear their parts,
In the sad murmr of the Night; those hearts
Custom had steeld with Crimes, perhaps had bin
Here frighted to repentance, had not sin
Assisted by the hands of Avarice, drawn
The Bridge of Reason, and obscured the dawn
Of Infant goodness, to redeem the time
Astonishment had lost, toward their Crime
They now themselves precipitate the hand,
Ordaind to ruin that fair Structure, and
Unravel his Life's even thread, prepares
To strike the fatal blow; but he that dares
Obstruct commanded Villainy forbid
The further progress of their guilt, and chid
That pale sin in rough Language of, a strange
Confused sound, striking their Ears did change
The ominous Dirges of the Night into
A various noise of humane Voices, who
Durst in that secret place approach, 'twas now
Too late to think on, the Rocks spacious brow,
Was clouded ore with men, whose glittering Arms
Threatend destruction, ere their swift alarms
Could summon sleeps infeebled aid; whilst they
Forsake their Prisoner, who becomes a Prey
To the Invaders, seeking safety in
Their flight, they fall before him, that had been
Ordaind to speedier ruin, entering at
The open Salliport, they give by that
Rash Act directions to the Foe, that mixed
Promiscuously with them, and now had fixed
Their Standards on the Gates. The Castle in
Feverish alarms sweating, did begin
To case her fiery stomach, by the breath
O'th full-mouthed Cannon. Ministers of death
In this hot labor busily distills
Extracted spirits, noise and tumult fills
The frighted City, whose fired turrets lent
A dismal light. But the Assaylants spent
Their blood in vain, the Soldiers that had been
At the first trembling fit distracted in
Confusions giddy maze, had rallied now
Their scattered spirits, and were seeking how
To purge dishonours stains in the bright fire
Of rage contracted valor. To retire
Unto their Ships in safety, now is all
The Invaders hope for, but so many fall
In that attempt, it leave no triumphs due
To Fortunes temple. By this winding clew
Of various fate, Argalia only finds
That stroke of death deceived, no hand unbindes
His corded arms, but that which meant to lay
Bondage as hard, so corrasives do stay
A Gangrene fed by springs of poisonous blood,
When reaching at the heart, as these withstood
The catarracts of death. With tyrants more
Indomitable, then the sea that bore
Their black Fleet, leave our Hero to untie
This knotty riddle of his fate, whilst by
The ignis fatuus of a fancy led
With slow paced feet, through other paths we tread.
The tumults of the City silenced in
A peaceful calm, what the effects had bin
Of those loud clamours, whilst all seek to know
Argalia's loss makes giddy wonder grow
Into suspicion, that this Act might be
Some stratagem oth' Guvernour, to free
Himself from a Successor, but those fly
Darts of mistrust were rendered hurtless by
His Princes Mandates, whose envenomed hate,
That spurious birth had made legit^mate.
Yet swift Revenge aff^onis his Treason in
Its full carier, his Master having bin
By him informd of a surprizal, where
All sounds but death affrighted, could not bear
The burden of his Fears, and yet not sink
Deeper in sin, ere the poor wretch could think
On ought but undeserved Rewards, he by
A brace of Mutes being strangled, from the high
But empty Clouds of Expectation drops,
To let the World know what vain shadow props
Those blood-er^cted Pyramids that stand
On secret Mu^thers black and rotten Sand.
When thus the S^^acusian had secured
His future Fame, Passion that still endured
A strong distemperature, slept not until
The story of their cross Design did fill
Palermo's Princes Ear, Argalia's loss,
Was now the Ball that babbling Fame did toss
Thorough the Court, upon whose airy Wing,
Reaching the Island, it too soon did bring
The heavy N^ws, disguised in Robes more sad
Then truth to her, whose stock of Virtues had
Been venter'd on that Sea of Merit, in
Such forms of Grief, as Princes that have been
Hurld from the splendent Glories of a Throne,
Into a Dungeon, her great Soul did groan
Beneath the Weights of grief; the doleful Tale,
Had thunder-strook all joy, her Spir'^s exhale
Their vigor forth in sighs, and faintly let
That g^orious Fabric unto which they are set
Supporters fail to the Earth; yet sorrow stays
Not in this frigid Zone, rude g^ief betrays
Her Passions to her Fathers jealous Ear
Who fearing least Argalia's Stars might clear
Their smoaky Orb^, and once more take a flight
From deaths cold house by a translated L^g^t,
To s^parate from sorrow, and again,
In Fortunes house Lord of the Ascendant Raig^^
He doubts that Islands safety, and from thence
Removes her with what speedy diligence,
Fear could provoke suspicion to; her Train
Shook with that sudden change, desire in vain
The Islands pleasure, ere they know how much
Their Fates must differ; as it often in such
Unlookt for changes happens, each man vents
His own Opinion, some did discontents,
Of the young Princess, others that the season
Of the year was cause; but though none know his reason,
All must obey his Will. The pleasan Isle
Whose Walks, fair Gardens, Prosp^cts did beguile
Time of so many happy hours, must now
A solitary Wilderness, whose brow,
Win^er had bound in folds of Ice, be left
To wail their absence, whilst each Tree bereft
Of Leaves, did like to Virgin Mourners stand,
Cloathd in white Vails of glittering Icelets, and
Shook with the breath of those sharp winds that brought
The hoarie Fish. The pensive birds had sought
Out Springs that were unbar'd with ice, and there
Grew hoarse with cold. The crusted earth did wear
A rugged armor. Every bank unclad
With flowers, concealed the juicie roots that had
Adorned their Summers dress. The Meadows green
And fragrant Mantle, withering lay between
The griz'ie mountains naked arms. All grows
Into a swift decay, as if it owes
That tribute unto her departure, by
Whose presence 'twas adorned. Seated did lie
Within the circuit of Ghirenza's wall,
(Though stretched to embrace) a Castle which they call
The Princes tower, a place whose strength had stood
Unshook with danger, when that violent flood
Of war raged in the Land, hither were brought
Such (if of Noble blood) whose greatness sought
From treacherous plots extension, yet although
To those a prison, here he did bestow
His best of treasure, briefly, it had been
Unto the Spartan Kings a Magazeen
Since first they ruled that Kingdom, and when ere
A war drew near them, their industrious care
Made it their place of residence; the hill
'Twas built upon, with his rockie feet did fill
A spacious Iftmos, at its depth a Lake
Supplied by the neighboring sea, let in to make
The Fort the more impregnable, with slow
But a deep current running, did bestow
A dreadful prospect on the bended brow
O'th hill, which covered with no earth did bow
Its torn clifts over the heavy stream. The way
That led to it, was over a bridge, which they
That guard it did each night draw up, from whence
A steep ascent, whose natural defense
Assisted by all helps of art, had made
The fatal place so dangerous to invade,
Each step a death presented. Here when he
Had placed his daughter, whose security
Rocks, walls, nor rivers warranted, without
A trusty guard of Soldiers, hemmed about
The walls, less hard then they. Those Gentlemen
That on her happier Court attended, when
Argalia did command them, as too mild
Were now discharged, their office on a wild
Band of those Mountain Soldiers, who had in
His last great war most famed for valor bin,
Being conferred, and these lest they should be
Forced by commands into civilitie,
Bestowed upon the fierce Brumorchus, one
Whose knotty disposition nature spun
With all her coursest threads, composing it
For strength, not beauty, yet a Lodging fit
For such a rough, unpolished guest as that
Black soul, whose dictates it ought trembled at,
In feverish glooms, whose subterranean fire
Inflamed that ill-formed Chaos with desire
Its vigor to employ in naught of kin
To goodness, till 'twas better tempered in
The Princes Court, where though he could not cast
His former rudeness off, yet having past
The filing of the Courtiers tongues, at length
It thus far wrought him, he converts that strength
To's Princes service, which till then had lay
In Passions Fetters, learning to obey,
The gentle strokes of Government; though bred
In salvage wildness, nursed with blood, and fed
With hourly Rapine, since he had forsook,
Those Desert haunts, a firm obedience took,
Hold on's robustious Nature, not to be
By that effeiminate wanton (flattery)
Strok'd to an yiedling mildness, which being known,
To the mistrustful Prince, whose Passions grown
So far above the reach of Reason, that
Her strength could not support them, bending at
Their own unweildy temper, sunk in^o
Acts, that his milder thoughts would blush to do;
Makes him from all his noble^ Captains choose
Forth this indomitable beast; to use,
So harsh a Discipline unto the sole
Heir to his Crown, a Lady that did roll
More Virtues on the Spindle of her Life,
Then Fate days length of Thread, had raised a strife,
So high in his vexed ^ubjects blood, that all
Murmr in secret, but there is none durst call
His Princes Acts in question, to behold
Her Prison through their tears, and then unfold
Their Friends a Vail of sorrow, is the most
Their Charity durst do: But that which crossed
Distr^st Pharonnida above the grief
Of her restraint, or ought but the belief
Of her Argalia's death, is now to be
Barred when she wants it, most society
With sorrowful Florenza, whilst she stayed
The Partner of her secrets, now betrayed
By false Amphibia to her Father, and
Banished the Court, retiring to withstand
The storms of greatness, to her Fathers own
Poor quiet home, which as if nere she would known,
The beauties of a Palace, did content
Her eaven thoughts at leisure to lament,
In pensive tears, her wretched Mistress Fate,
Whose joys eclipsed, converts her Robes of State
To mourning Sables; what delights the place,
Was capable of having to deface
The Characters of grief, her Father strives
To make them hers, but no such choice Flower thrives
In the cold Region of her Breast, she makes
Her Prison such as theirs, whose guilt forsakes
All hopes of Mercy; the slow^ footed day,
Hardly from Night dist^nguisht, steals away
Few beams from her tear-clouded Eyes, and those
A melancholy Pensiveness bestows,
On saddest Objects* The ore-shadowed Room
Wherein she sat, seemd but a large sized Tomb,
Where Beauty buried lay, its furniture
Of doleful black hung in it, to inure,
Her Eyes to Objects like her Thoughts, in which
Night dress of sorrow, till a Smile enrich
Impoverisht Beauty, I must leave her to
Her sighs (those sad Companions) and renew
His fatal Story, for whose Love alone,
She dares exchange the Glories of a Throne.

PHARONNIDA. The third Book. CANTO THE THIRD.
The ARGUMENT.
V.
From Treachery, which, two Princes Annals staind
The brave Argalia by protecting Fate,
Deliverd, Land, or Rhodes fair Isle attaind,
Being there elected Champion for their State.
VI.
In which design, although with Victory blessed,
The common Fate him soon a Prisoner makes
To a proud Turk, beneath whose power distressed,
His virtue profferd liberty forsakes.
THrough the dark paths of dusty Annals, we,
Led by his Valors light, return to see,
Argalia's story, who, has since that Night,
Wherein he took that strange distracted flight,
From treacherous Ardenna performed a course
So full of threatening dangers, that the force
Of his protecting Angel, trembled to
Support his fate, which cracked the sl^nder clew
Of destiny almost to death,; His stars
Doubting their influence, when such horrid wars
The Gods proclaym'd, withdrew their languish'd beams
Beneath Heavens spangled arch. In pitchie streams
The heavy clouds unlade their wombs, until
The angry winds fearing the flood should fill
The air (their Region where they ruled) did break
Their Marb^e Lodgings; Natures self grew weak
With these distemperatures, and seemed to draw
Towered dissolution, her neglected Law
Each Element forgot, the imprisond flame
When the Clouds stock of moisture could not tame
Its violence, in Sulphry flashes break
Through the glaring air. The swollen clouds speak
In the loud voice of thunder; the sea raves
And foams with anger, hurls his troubled waves
High as the Moons dull Orb, whose waning light
Withdrew, to add more terror to the night.
When the black curtain of this storm, that took
The use of Art away, had made them look
For naught but swift destruction, being so vain
For'th' Mariners to row, that the proud main
Scornd to be lasht with Oars; to ease distress
The night forsook them, but a day no less
Dreadful succeeds it, by whose doubtful light
The wretched Captives soon discover night
Near them a Turkish Navy; to whose aid
The Renega^oes (having first displaid
Their silver Crescents) join; Nor did they meet
That help untimely, a brave Rhodian Fleet
Set forth from those (the Christian Bulwarks) to
Obstruct the Turks Invasions, was in view.
To meet the threatening danger, which 'twas then
Too late to wave, that miracle of men
The brave Argalia, chained unto an oar
Is with a thousand noble Captives more
Forced to assist damned infidels; and now
The well-arm'd Fleets drew near, their swift keels plow
The Oceans angry front. First they salute
Each other with their Cannon, those grown mute
Come to more desperate fight, unfriendly bands
Unite their Vessels, the fierce Soldier stands
Firm on his Hatches, whilst another bords
His active enemies, whose Ship affords
No room for such unwelcome guests, but sends
Their scattered limbs into thin air; Each bends
His strength to's Foes destruction; plunging in
Which bloody sweat, the Rhodians hopes had bin
Lost with their Fleet, had not kind Fortune smiled
Thus on their fear; whilst action had beguiled
Each soul of passive cares, Argalia sees
A way to unlock his rusty Chain, and frees
Himself and fellows from their bank, which done,
Those that continued at their Oars, did run
The Vessel from the rest, and ere unto
Their sight betrayed, the trembling Pirates slew.
Then closing with their unsuspitious Foes
In The vigor of the fight, they discompose
Their well ranged Fleet, and such confusion struck
Into the van, to see their Rear thus shook
With an unlooked for Hirrocan^, that in
A fearful haste the numerous Turks begin
To stretch their fins and flee, but a^ their speed
Was spent in vain, Argalia's hand had freed
So many Captives, that their Galleys must
Unto the winds uncertain favor trust
Or else becalmed, but seebly crawl before
Their eager foes, who both with Sail and Ore
Chased them to ruin. Glorious Victory,
Thus to the Christian party being by
A stranger purchac'd, with such high applause
As those that rescue a declining cause
From the approach of ruin, welcomed, he
Is now received into the society
Of the brave Christian order. But they not
Long joy'd in victory, ere the Turk to blot
The stayns of being conquered out had made
A mighty Army ready to invade
The valiant Rhodians, where Argalia shows
So brave a spirit, their whole Army owes
His valor for example. The Turks had ought
Made desperate onslaughts on the Isle, but brought
Naught back but wounds and infamy, but now
Wearyed with toil, they are resolved to bow
Their st^bborn resolutions with the strength
Of not to be resisted want, the length
Oth' Chronca' disease extended had
To some few months, since to oppress the sad
But constant Islanders, the Army lay
Circling their Confines. Whilst this tedious stay
From battle rusts the Soldiers valor in
His tainted Cabben, there had often bin
With all variety of Fortune fought
Brave single Combats, whose success had brought
Honors unwither'd Laurels on the brow
Of either party; but the balance now
Forced by the hand of a brave Turk, inclined
Wholly to them, thrice had his valor shined
In victories refulgent rays; thrice heard
The shouts of Conquest thrice on's Lance appeared
The heads of noble Rhodians, which had struck
A general sorrow amongst the Knights, all look
Who next the Lists should enter, each desires
The task were his, but honor now requires
A spirit more then vulgar, or she dies
The next attempt, their valors sacrifice,
To prop whose ruins, chosen by the free
Consent of all Argalia comes to be
Their happy champion. Truce proclaym'd until
The combat ends, th'expecting people fill
The spacious battlements, the Turks forsake
Their Tents, of whom the City Ladies ^ake
A dreadful view, till a more noble sight
Diverts their looks, each part behold their Knight
With various wishes, whilst in blood and sweat
They toil for Victory, the Conflicts heat
Raged in their veins, which honor more inflamed
Then burning Calentures could do, both blamed
The feeble influence of their Stars that gave
No speedier conquest, each neglects to save
Himself, to seek advantage to offend
His eager Foe. The dreadful combats end
Naught but their loss of blood proclaims their spirits,
In that Reflux of heat and life inherit
Valors unconqueer'd throne; but now so long
The Turks proud Champion had indu^'d the strong
Assaults of the stout Christian, till his strength
Cooled on the ground with his blood, he fell at length
Beneath his conquering Sword. The barbarous crew
O'th Villains that did at a distance view
Their Champions fall, all bands of truce forgot,
Running to succor him, begin a hot
And desperate combat with those Knights that stand
To aid Argalia, by whose conquering hand
Whole squadrons of them fall, but here he spent*
His mighty Spirit in vain, their Cannons rent
His scattered Troops, who for protection fly
To The City Gates, but closely followed by
Their Foes did there for sad oblations fall
To dying liberty; their battered wall
Groaned with the wondrous weight of Lead, and in
Its ruins hides her battlements, within
The bloody streets the Turkish Crescents are
Displayed, whilst all the miseries of war
Raged in Their Palaces. The common sort
Of people make the barbarous Soldier sport.
In dieing, whilst those that survive them crave
Their fate in vain, here cruelty did save
And mercy only kill, since death set free
Those happier Souls from dire captivity.
At length the unrestrained Soldier tires
Although not satisfies his foul desires
With Rapts and Murder, when amongst those pore
Distressed Captives that from thence they bore,
Argalia lies in Chains, ordained to die
A sacrifice unto the cruelty
Of the fierce Bashaw, whose lovd favorite in
The Combat late he slew, yet had not bin
In that so much unhappy, had not he
That honored then his Sword with victory
Half-brother to Janusa been, a bright
But cruel Lady, whose refined delight
Her slave (though husband) Ammurat durst not
Ruffle with discontent; wherefore to cool that hot
Contention of her blood, which be ^oresaw
That heavy new^s would from her anger draw
To quench with the brave Christians death, he sent
Him living to her, that her anger spent
In flaming torments, might not settle in
The dregs of discontent. Staying to win
Some Rhodian Castles, all the Prisoners were
Sent with a guard into Sardinia, there
To meet their wretched thraldom, from the rest
Argalia severed, soon hopes to be blessed
With speedy death, though waited on by all
The hell-instructed torments that could fall
Within inventions reach; But he is not yet
Arrived to's period, his unmovd stars sit
Thus in their Orbs secured. It was the use
O'th Turk^sh pride, which triumphs in the abuse
Of suffering Christians, once before they take
The ornaments of nature off, to make
Their prisoners public to the view that all
Might mock their miseries, this sight did call
Janusa to her Pa^lace window, where
Whilst she beholds them, love resolved to bear
Her ruin on her treacherous eye-beams, till
Her heart infected grew, their Orbs did fill
(As the most pleasing object) with the sight
Of him whose Sword opend a way for the flight
Of her loved Brothers soul; At the first view
Passion had struck her dumb, but when it grew
Into desire, she speedily did send
To have his name, which known, hate did de^end
Her heart, besieged with love, she sighs, and strait
Commands him to a dungeon, but loves bait
Cannot be so cast up, though to deface
His Image in her soul she strives: the place
For's execution, she commands to be
Against the next day prepared, but rest and she
Grow enemies about it, if she steal
A slumber from her thoughts, that does reveal
Her passions in a dream, sometimes she thought
She saw her Brothers pale grim Ghost, that brought
His grizlie wounds to show her, smeerd in blood
Standing before her fight, and by that flood
Those red streams wept imploring vengeance, then
(Enraged) she cries, Oh let him die, but when
Her sleep imprisoned fancy, wandering in
The shades of darkened Reason, did begin
To draw Argalia's image on her soul,
Loves Sovereign power did suddenly control
The strength of those abortive Embrio's, sprung
From smotherd anger. The glad birds had sung
A Lullaby to night, the Lark was fled
On drooping wings, up from his dewy bed
To fan them in the Rising Sunbeams, ere
Whose early reign, Janusa that could bear
No longer locked within her breast so great
An army of rebellious passion^, beat
From Reasons conquered Fortress, did unfold
Her thoughts to Manto, a stout Wench, whose bold
Wit, joynd with zeal to serve her, had endeard
Her to her best Affections; having cleard
All doubts with hopeful promises her made,
By whose close wilds this plot must be convayd,
To secret action, of her council makes
Two Eunuch Panders, by whose help she takes
Argalia from his Keepers charge, as to
Suffer more torments then the rest should do,
And lodged him in that Castle, to affright
And soften his great Soul with fear, the light
Which lent its beams unto the dismal place,
In which he lay, without presents the face
Of horror smeard in blood, a Scaffold built,
To he the Stage of Murder, blushed with guilt
Of Christian blood, by several torments let
From the imprisoning Veins; this Object set
To startle his Resolves, if good, and make
His future joys more welcome, could not shake
The Heaven-built Pillars of his Soul, that stood
Steady, though in the slippery paths of blood.
The gloomy Night now sat enthroned in dead
And silent shadows, Midnight Curtains spread
The Earth in black, for what the falling day,
Had blushed in fire, whilst the brave Prisoner lay
Circl'd in darkness, yet in those shades spends
The hours with Angels, whose assistance lends
Strength to the wings of Faith, which mounted on
The Rock of hope, was hovering to be gone
Toward her eternal Fountain, from whose source,
Celestial Love enjoynd her lower course.
Whilst in this holy Ecstasy, his knees
Descent, did mount his heart to him that sees
His thoughts disvellop'd, whilst dull shades oppressed
The drousie Hemisphear, whilst all did rest,
Save those whose actions blushed at daylight, or
Such wretched Souls whose sullen cares abhor
Truce, with ^ef^eshing slumbers, he beholds
A glimering light, whose near approach unfo^ds
The Leaves of darkness; whilst his wonder g^ows
Big with Amazement, the dim Tapour shows
What hand conveyed it thither, he might see
False Manto enterd, who prepared to be
A Bawd unto her lustful Mist^esse ca^ne,
Not with persuasive Rhetoric to inflame
A heart congeald with deaths approach, but thaw
Him from the frozen Rocks of rigid Law,
With brighter Constellations, that did move
In spears, where every Star was fired with love.
The Siren yet to show that she had left
Some modesty unrifl'd by the theft,
Of mercenary baseness, sadly wept,
Her Errands Prologue, but guilt was not kept
Within the Curtain long, she only sat,
A Mourner for the sickness of his Fate,
Until esteemd for pitiful, and then
Prescrib^s this Remedy, Most blessed of men,
Compose thy wonder, and let only joy
Dwell in thy Soul, my coming's to destroy,
Not nurse thy trembling Fears; be but so wise
To follow thy swift Fate, and thou may rise
Above the reach of danger, in thy Arms
Circle that power, whose radient brightness charms
Fierce Ammurat's anger, when his Crescents shine
In a full O^b of Forces, what was thine
Ere made a Prisoner, though the doubtful state
Of the best Christian Monarch, will abate
Its splendour, when (that Daughter of the Night)
Thy feeble Star shines in a Heaven of Light.
If Life, or Liberty then bare a shape
Worthy thy Courting, swear not to escape
By the attempts of strength, and I will free
The Iron bonds of thy Captivity.
A solemn Oath by that great power he served,
Took and believed, his hopes no longer sterv'd,
In expectation, from that swarthy seat
Of sad Despair, his narrow Jayl repleat,
With lazy Damps, she leads him to a Room,
In whose Delights Joys Summer seemd to bloom;
There left him to the brisk Society
Of costly Bathes, and corsick Wines, whose high
And sprightly temper, from cool Sherbets found
A calm ally: here his harsh thoughts unwound
Themselves in pleasure, as not fearing Fate
So much, but that he dares to recreate
His Spirits (by unweildy Action tired)
With all that Lust into no Crime had fired.
By Mutes (those silent Ministers of sin)
His sullied Garments were removed, and in
Their place such various Habits laid, as pride
Would cloth her Favorites with, she means to hide
From those Deformities, which Accident
On Natures Issue, striving to prevent
Forms eaven progress casts, when she would twine
That active Male with matter feminine.
Unruffl'd here by the rash Wearer rests
Fair Persian Mantles, rich Sclavonian Vests.
The gaudy Thuscan, or transmuted shape
Of the fantastic French, the British Ape,
The grave and constant Spaniard, all might here
Find Garments, such as Princes would appear,
To grace their honored Nuptials in, or tell
Strangers how much their Treasure does excel*
Though on this swift variety of Fate,
He looks with wonder, yet his brave Soul sat,
Too safe within her guards of Reason, to
Be shook with Passion; that there is some bing new
And strange approaching, after such a storm
This gentle Calm assures him, but the form
Of pleasure softens not, that which the other,
And worse extreme, not with fears damps could smother.
He flies not with the rugged Separatist,
Pleasures smooth Walks, nor does enjoying twist
Those threads of Gold to Fetters, he dares taste
All mirth, but what Religions stock would wast.
His Limbs (from Wounds but late recoverd) now
Refresht with liquid Odours did allow
Their suppl'd Nerves no so^ter rest, but in
Such Robes as wore their Ornament within,
Vaild over their beauty; Linen smooth, and soft,
As Phoenix Down, and whiter then what is brought
From furthest China he puts on, and then
What habit Custom made familiar, when
Cloathd in his own, makes choice of for to be
Most ho^ourd of that rich variety.
In an Italian Garb, ^o the Dubblet clad,
Manto, Lusts swift and wa^chfull Spy that had
With an efficious care attended on
That motion, entering, hasts him to be gone,
To ^'rd more sublimed delights, which though a just
And holy doubt proclaim the road of Lust,
Knowing his better Angel did attend
Upon each step, he ventures to descend
The dreadful Precipiece so far, until
The burni^g Vale was seen, then mounts the Hill
Of Heaven-bred Fortitude, from whence disdain,
Floods of contempt on those dark fires did rain.
^is guilty Conduct now had brought him near
Ihonusa's Room, the glaring Lights appear,
Through the Windows crystal Walls, the strong
Perfumes of balmy Incense mixed among
The wandering Attomes of the Air did fly,
Sights nimble Scouts, yet were: made captive by
A slower sense, as if but to reveal
What breathd within, those Fugitives did steal,
Thorough their unseen Salliports, which now
Were useless grown, the open doors allow,
A free access into the Room, where come,
Such real Forms he saw, as would strike dumb
Their Alcharons Tales of Paradise; the fair
And sparkling Jems in the gilded Roof impair
Their Fapours fires, yet both themselves confess,
Weak to those flames Ihonusa's eyes possess.
With such a joy, as bodies that do long
For Souls shall meet them in the Doomsdayes throng,
She that ruled Princes, though not Passions, sat
Waiting her Lover, on a Throne whose state
Epitomized the Empires Wealth, her Robe
With costly pride had robbed the checquerd Globe,
Of its most fair and orient Jewels, to
Inhance its value; captive Princes, who
Had lost their Crowns, might here those Jems have seen,
That did adorn them, yet she trusts not in
These Auxiliary strengths, her confidence
In her own Beauty rests, which no defense
Of Chastity ere yet withstood, and now
She scorns to fear it, when her power did bow
Unto a Slave condemnd, that nere could look
To see the sight, but whilst some torment took
The use of Eyes away, whilst he draws near,
(By her command) no less it did appear,
Her wonder to behold his dauntlesse Spirit,
Then his, what Virtue to applaud as Merit.
Placed in a Seat near her bright Throne, to stir
His settled thoughts, she thus begins; From her
Your Sword has so much injured, as to shed
Blood so near kin to mine, that it was fed
By the same milky Fountains, and within
One Womb warmd into life, is such a sin,
I could not pardon, did not Love commit
A Rape upon my Mercy, all the wit
Of man in vain Inventions, had been lost,
Ere thou redeemd, which now although it cost,
The price of all my Honors, I will do,
Be but so full of gratitude, as to
Repay my care with love: Why do thou thus
S^t dumb to my discourse, it lies in us,
To raise, or ruin thee, and make my way
Thorough their bloods, that our Embraces stay.
This on the spur of Passion spoke, she strains
His hand in hers, where feeling the big Veins,
Beat with intemperate heat, conceiving it
The strokes of Lust, to aggravate the Fit,
Into a Paroxisme of Guilt, she shows
(More then with modesty) how much she ows
To N^tures Treasare, for that ill spent stock
Of Beauty she enjoyd, her Eyes unlock
Two Cabinets of sparkling Diamonds, which
The even foils of Ebbon brows enrich,
With a more Orient brightness; on her Cheek,
The Roses (conquering the pale Lilly) seek
To counterfeit a Blush, but vanquished shame
Submits to Love, in whose insulting flame,
The modest Virgin a sad Martyr dies,
And at Fames wounds, bled Passions Sacrifice.
Natures embost work, her soft swelling breasts
(Those Bals of living Ivory) unprest,
Even with the Weight of Tiffany displayes,
Whiteness that shamed the Swans, the blood that strai^s
In Azare Channels over them did show
By their sweld st^eams, how high the Tide did flow,
Wherein her P^ssions saild; the milky way
Loves fragrant Valley that betwixt them lay,
Was moist with balmy Dew, extracted by
The busy Spirits that did hovering fly
Thorough her boiling blood, whose raging flame,
Had scortcht to death the April Flowers of shame.
To charm those sullen Spirits that within,
The dark Cells of his Conscience might have bin,
Yet by Religion hid, that Gift divine,
The Souls Composure, Music did refine,
The lazy Air, whose pollisht Harmony,
Whi^st dancing in reboubled Echoes, by
A wanton Song was answered, whose each part,
Invites the Hearing to betray the Heart.
Having with all these choice Flowers strewed the way
That leads to Lust, to shun the slow delay
Of his approach, her sickly Passions have
To die in action; Come (she cries) we wast
The precious Minutes, now thou know for what
You Are sent for hither, which if active at,
Thou only liv'st in my esteem; and then
(O Impudence, which from the worst of men
Might force a Blush) she swiftly hasts to tread
Within Lusts Tropicks, her polluted Bed.
And here black sinner, thou, whose bloods disease,
Of kin to Hels, wants numbers to appease
Its flaming Callenture, blushed to behold
A Virgin Virtue, spotless leaves unfold
In youthful Volume, whilst thy ripe years spent,
In lust, has lost thy Ages Ornament.
In this, as hot and fierce a Charge of Vice,
As (since he lost the field in Paradise)
Man ever felt; the brave Argalia sits,
With Virtue coold in Passions feverish Fits:
Yet at Life's Garrisons his Pulses beat,
In hot Alarums, till to a soft Retreat
Called by that fair Commandresse spite of all
Beauties prevailing Rhetoric, though he fall,
Ruined beneath her anger, he by this
Unwelcome Language, her expected bliss,
Converts to rage; And must my freedom then
At such a rare be purchased, rather when
My life expires in Torments, let my Name
Forgotten die, then live in black-mouthed Fame;
A s^rvant to thy Lust, go tempt thy own
Da^'d Infidels to sin, that nere had known
The way to Virtue, not this cobweb Vail
Of beauty which thou wearst, but as a Jayl,
To a Soul, pale with guilt, can cover over
Thy Minds deformities; a tainted Whore
Conscience proclaim thee will, when thou shall sit,
Shook with this spotted Fevers trembling Fit.
(Rent from these gilded Pleasures) send me to
A Dungeon dark as Hell, where shadows do
Reign in eternal silence; Let these rich
And costly Robes (the gaudy Trappings) which
Thou meanst to cloth my sin in, be exchanged
For sordid Rags; when thy fierce spleen has ranged
Through all invented torments, ^hoose the worst
To punish my denial, less accursed,
I so shall perish, then if by consent
I Would taught thy guilty thoughts how to augment
Their sins in action, and by giving ease
To thy bloods Fever, took its loathd disease.
To have the spring-tyde of her pleasures, sweld
By Lusts salt waters, thus by force expeld
Back to Confusions troubled Sea, had made
Such troops of Passion ready to invade,
An ill desended Conscience, that her look
Like a cast Felons, out of hopes of the book;
Was sad with silent guilt; the Room she leaves
To her Contemner, who not long receives
The benefit of rest, she that had been
The Prologue unto this obstructed sin,
With six a^m'd Slaves was enterd, thence to force
Him to his dismal Jayl, but the Divorce
Of life, from those which first approacht, joynd to
The others flight had put her to renew
That scatterd strength, had not that sacred tie
(His solemn Oath) from Laur^ld Victory,
Snatched the fair wreath, and though brave Valor strives
To reach at Freedom through a thousand Lives:
At her Command more tamely made him yield,
Then conquered Virgins in the Bridal Field.
CANTO THE FOURTH*
The ARGUMENT.
Anger (improved by Lusts enormous Flam^)
Fires vexed Jhonusa, with such sad^ex reams
Of Rage, that her swcet Sexes native shame,
Is scortcht to death, in those prodigious beams.
Which wilst they to her angry Lord betray,
Her Honors loss, such tumulis in him breed,
That both their deaths must serve for an allay,
Whose sudden fall our Christian Champion freed.
OUr noble Captive to fair Virtues Throne,
In safety past, though through Lusts burning Zone
Finds in his Dungeons lazy damps, a rest
More sweet, though with the heavy waights oppressed,
Of Iron bondage, then if they had bin
Loves amorou^ wreaths ( Jonusa's Arms) within
Whose Ivory Circles he had slept; but she,
(Her grief composed of all malignity)
Lusts flames unquencht converts to, whilst they burn.
Black thoughts within her breast, that beauteous Urn
Of Lusts corruption: sometimes anger flies
Above the sph^ar of Reason, and there dies,
With tears extinguished; she breaths Curses in
Her Souls pale Agony, such as had bin
More deadly then infectious damps if not
Strangled in the Embrio, dead before their hot
Poison could work upon her fancy more
Then spleenfull thoughts which were recal'd before
Ripened for execution. Now she steeps
Her down in tears, a flood of sorrow weeps
Of power (if penitent) to expiate
Youths vigorous sins, but all her mourning sat
Beneath a darker Veil then that which shades
Repentant grief, since sin but wished invades
The soul with that which leads to horror, when
Grief for sins past bring into light again
One through a sea of trouble leads the way
To a safe Harbor, the other casts away
Poor ship-wrackt Mortals, when by deaths swift stroke
Life's feeble hold is from hopes anchor broke.
So far the fair Jonusa in this sad
Region of grief had gone, till sorrow had
That Fever turned, upon whose flaming wings
At first lust only sat, to one which brings
Deaths symptoms near her heart, which had so long
Beneath the burden groand, until the strong
Disease had wrought up all the blood within
Her checks into consuming flames; the skin
Had lost its soft repose of flesh, and lay
On naught but bones, whose sharpness did betray
Their macerated nerves; The Rose had lost
His Ensigns in her cheeks, and though it cost
Payns near to death, the Lilly had alone
Set his pale Banners up, no brightness shone
Within her eyes dim Orbs, whose fading light
Being quenched in death, had set in endless night
Had not the wise endeavors of her Maid
(The careful Manto) griefs pale Scouts betrayed
By sly deceit. Knowing if she should want
Health, until cured by that exotic plant
The Captives love, what lust at first did burn
With inflammations might a Gangrene turn,
Although she cures not, yet gives present ease
By laying Opiates to the harsh disease.
A Letter, which, did for uncivil blame
His first denial, in the strangers name
Disguised she gives her, which, with eyes that did
O're-flow with joy, read ore, had soon forbid
Griefs sullen progress, whose next stage had been
Over Life's short road, the Grave, deaths quiet Inn
From whose dark terror by this gleam of light
Like trembling children by a Lamps weak light
Freed from nights dreadful shadows, she would embraced
Sleep (natures darkness) had not joy defaced
Those sooty characters, and on the wings
Of ayrie hope (that wanton bird which sing^
As soon as fledged) advanced her to survey
The dawning beauties of a longed for day.
But ere this pyramid of pleasure to
Its height arrives, with his presence to undo
The golden structure, dreadful Ammurat
From's floting mansion, safely landed at
The Cities Pott, impatient Love had brought
In an untimely visit, ere swift thought
Fetterd with guilt, could from his eager eye
By an excuse to sanctuary fly,
He enters, and she faints, in which pale trance
His pity finds her, but to no such chance
Imputes the cause, rather conceives it joy
Whose rushing torrent, made her heart employ
His nimble servants, all her Spirits, to
Prevent a deluge, which might else undo
Loves new made Commonwealth; But whilst his care
Hastens to help, her fortune did declare
Her sorrows dark enigma, from her bed
The Letter drops, which when life's Army fled
Their frontier Garrisons neglected had
Been left within't, this seen, declares a sad
Truth to the amazed Bassa, though 'twere mixed
With subtle falsehood, whilst he stands betwixt
High rage, and grief distracted, doubtful yet
In what new dress to wear revenge, the fit
Forsakes Ihonusa, who not knowing, she
Detected stood, of Lusts conspiracy
Against honors Royal Charter, from a low
Voice strayns a welcome, which did seem to flow
From fickle discontent, such as the weak
Lungs breath the thoughts in whilst their fibers break.
To counterfeited slumbers, leaving her,
He Is gone, with silent anger to confer
And though rage lives in fire, the fury lies
Unseen through the false optics of his eyes;
With such a farewell as kind husbands leave
Their pregnant Wives, preparing to receive
A Mothers first of blessings he forsakes
The room, and into strict i^quiry takes
The wretched Manto, who ere she could call
Excuse to aid, surpised, discovers all
Her sins black art, from whose dark Theorems, he
This method draws, that night designed to be
Lightn'd with Lusts hot triumphs, he pretends
Commanded absence, yet the false stroke bends
But toward that guard, ere by a swift reverse
Brought back, his souls sly Scouts had gained commerce
With all those enemies to honor by
Whose aid Ihonusa ruins chastity;
Placed by false Manto in a Closet, which,
Silent, and sad, had only to enrich
Its roof with light, some few neglected beams
Sent from Ihonusa's room, which serve as streams
To want intelligence; Here he beheld
Whilst she, who with his absence had expelld
All thoughtfull cares was with her joy swelled high
As Captives are when called to liberty,
Her Linen (like a Princely Brides that meets
In the soft folds of her first nuptial shee^s
Perfumed and costly, her fair bed was more
Adorned then Shrines, whose Saints rich Kings adore,
Incense in smoaky curles, climbs to the fair
Roof, whilst choice music rarifies the air,
Each element in more perfection here
Then in their first creation did appear
Yet lived in harmony, the winged fire lent
Perfumes to the air, that to moist Cordials pent
In Crystal Vials, strength, and those impart
Their vigor to that ball of earth, the heart,
The nice eye here epitomized might see
Rich Persia's wealth, and old Rome's luxury
But now (like Natures new made Favorite
Who until all created for delight
Was framed, did nere see Paradise) comes in
Deceived Argalia, thinking he had been
Called thither to behold a Penitent
Arming for death, not heavens choice blessings spent
On the vanities of Life, but mirth soon gives
That thought its mortal wound, and shows she lives
Beyond that dark sphere, where her joys did move
As if her eyes alone gave Laws to Love,
Where beauties Constellations all did shine
As if no cross aspect could ere untwine
Their claspt Conjunctions, which did seem to guide
Old Natures steps, till from their Zeniths pride,
By virtue (the Souls motion) which the World
In order keeps, into coufusion hurld.
For here gay vanity, though cloathd in all
Her gaudy Pageants, lets her Trophies fall
Before bright Virtues Throne, with such a high
Heroic scorn, as aged Saints that die
Heavens Favorites, leave the trivial world, he slights
That gilded Pomp, no splendent beam invites,
His serious eye, to meet their Objects in
An amorous glance, reserved as he had been,
Before his grave Confessor, he beholds
Beauties bright Magic, whilst its Art unfolds
Great Loves mysterious Riddles, and commands
Captive Ihonusa to infringe the Bands
Of Matrimonial modesty; when all
Temptation falls, she leaves her Throne to fall,
(The scorn of Greatness) at his Feet; but Prayer
(Like flattery) expires in useless air,
Too weak to hatter that firm confidence,
Their torments thunder could not shake: from hence
Despair (Loves Tyrant) had enfor^d her to
More wild Atempts, had not her Ammurat, who
Unseen, beheld all this, prevented by
His sight, the death of bleeding modesty.
Made swift with rage, the ruffl'd Curtain flies
His angry touch, he enters, fixed his eyes,
(From whence some drops of rage distill) on her
Whose heart had lent her Face its Character,
Whilst he stood red with flaming anger, she
Looks pale with fear, Passions disparity
In such extremes, as Natures Laws require,
'Twixt Earths cold Center, and the aires circling fire,
Dwelt in their troubled breasts, his wild eyes stood
Like Comets, when attracting storms of blood
Shook with portentuous sadness, whilst hers sat
Like the dull earth, when trembling at the Fate
Of those ensuing ills, heavy and fixed
Within their Orbs. Passions thus strangely mixed,
No various Fever ere created in,
The phrenzi'd Brain, when sleeps sweet calm had bin
From her soft Throne deposed: this Lightning past,
Thunder succeeds, as burning Mountains cast
Out horrid noise, after their flame and smoke,
So having paused, his dreadful Voice thus broke
The dismal silence; Thou prodigious Whore,
The curse of my Nativity, that more
Afflicts me, then eternal wrath can do
Spirits condemnd, some Fiends instruct me to
Heighten revenge to thy desert, but so
I should do more then Mortals may, and throw
Thy spotted Soul to flames, yet I will give
Its passe-port hence, for think not to outlive
This hour, this fatal hour, ordaind to see,
More then an Age before of Tragedy;
She that fell from a Firmament of pride
To Fortunes lowest Region, and there di'd
A sad example to ensuing times,
That Honors Altitude supports not Crimes.
When in their stretched Extentions reaching to
Justice, which can through reverst Optics view
Giants, though Pigmy sins do often appear,
Like the dim Moon, more great, because more near,
Sins, that till fear their guilt did aggravate,
Wore Virtues Frontispiece, since now too late
To hope for life, in their own monstrous form,
Encounter Reasons Guards, till the big storm
Of various p^ssions all were settled in
Dregs of despair, when ^earing tears should win
The victory of anger, Ammurat draws
His Simme^er, which had in blood writ Laws
For conquered Provinces, and with a swift
And cruel rage, ere penitence could lift
Her burdened soul in a repentant thought
Toward heaven, sheathes the cold steel in her soft
And snowy breast, with a loud g^oan she falls
Upon the blou^y floor, half breathless calls
For his untimely pity, but perce^ving
The fleeting spirits with her blood were leaving
Her heart unguarded, she imployes that breath
Which yet remained, not to bewail her death,
But beg his life that caused it, on her knees
S^rugling to rise, but now calmed Ammurat frees
Her from d^sturbing death, in's last great work,
And thus declares some virtue in a Turk;
I have brave Christian by perusing thee
In this great act of honor, learnt to be
Too late thy slow-paced follower, this ^ing (with that
Gives him his Signet) shall when questioned at
The Castle guards, thy safety be, and now
I see her bloods low water does allow
Me only time to lanch my souls black Bark
Into deaths rubick Sea, for to the dark
And silent Region, though we here were by
Passion divorced, Fortune shall not deny
Our souls to sail together: From thy eyes
Remove deaths load, and see what sacrifice
My Love is offering, with that word a stroke
Pierces his breast, whose speedy pains invoak
Deaths Opiates to appease them, be sinks down
By's dying Wife, who ere the cold flood drown
Life in the deluge of her wounds, once more
Betrays her eyes to the light, and though they bore
The weight of death upon their Leads, did keep
Them so long open, till the icie sleep
Began to seize on him, and then she cries
Oh see just heaven, see, see my Ammurat dies
To wander with me in the unknown shade
Of Immortality, but I have made
The wounds that murdered both, his hand that gave
Mine, did but gently let me blood to save
An everlasting Fever. Pardon me
My dear, my dying Lord, Eternity
Shall see my soul washed white in tears, but Oh
I now feel times dear want, they will not now
Fast as my stream of blood. Christian farewell,
When ere thou do our tragic story tell,
Do not extenuate my crimes, but let
Them in their own black characte^s be set
Near Ammurats bright virtues, that read by
The unpractic'd Lover, which posterity
(Whilst wanton winds play with our dust) shall raise
On beauties throne, the good may justice praise
By his example, and the bad by mine
From Vice^s Throne be scared to Virtues Shrine.
And here the speed deaths messengers did make
To hurry forth their souls, did faintly shake
Her words into imperfect accents, this
She cries is our last enterview, a kiss
Then joins their bloudlesse Lips; Each close the eyes
O'th other, whilst the parting spirit flies
Mounted on both their breaths, the latest gasp
They ere must draw. Whilst with stiff arms they clasp
Each others neck, Argalia through a cloud
Of liquid sorrow did behold the proud
Triumphs of death in their untimely fate,
He sees great Ammurat for a Robe of State,
Grovelling in blood, the fair Ihonusa lie,
Purpl'd in death; like pollisht Ivory.
Dipped in Vermillion; the bright Chrystals that
Her Soul in conquering flames looked thorough at.
Both quenched and coold in death; but time did lend
His tears scarce passage, till a drop could end
Its Journey over his Checks, before a Page
Whose cruelty had far out-grown his Age;
Enters in have, and with an anger that
(Though indiscreet) at wrongs seemd kindled at,
In wounds, did on the Bassas body vent
A spleen that deaths discharge could not content.
This seen, Argalia (to whom all must be
Offense that injures fair humanity)
Stops the vain Torrent, and a nearer way,
To just revenge directs the angry Boy,
Who by unfolded truth, now lets him know,
His Rage to that uncivil height did grow,
Not from a childish spleen, but wrongs that he
A Christian, sufferd in Captivity.
Assured by this confession, that he might
Be useful more, then in a secret flight,
Argalia bids him, in his Bassas Name,
A Mandate, write for some of worthiest Fame,
Amongst all the Christian Citizens, and those
To send the Guard for, ere the Morning rose,
On the black ruins of the Night; this done,
Before that time the Victory had won
Of opportunity (their Warders slain)
Each Christian Captive from his rusty Chain,
His bold band frees, and by their happy aid,
The Gates being first secured, with ease dismayed;
The drousie Garrison, from whom they found
But weak resistance, some soft fleep had bound
To Beds of ease, intemperate Riot kept
Others more vainly waking; here one slept
Between a Mistress Arms, and there another
(Stole to a private Cattamit) did smoother
Delight in whispers, in which loose Garb found,
Ere time rowls up what slow neglect unwound,
Even in securities soft Lap surpised,
They met grim death in Pleasures ^hape disguised,
All now being slain but feeble Eunuchs, and
Poor trembling Maids, the new, but valiant Band
Of late freed Captives Crown the Walls, from whence
They saw the Soldiers wicked diligence,
In finding those which the false Mandate had
Designed for Ruin general, as sad
The Cities sorrows were, a desolate
And silent horror, unregarded sat,
In The empty streets, which action had not filled,
Yet with employment; but when day did gild
The Ebbony of Night, to hear the rude
Murmr that did, from the mixed multitude,
Opened together with their Doors, assures
Argalia, that their ^ear, which yet secures,
That bandfull of insulting Tyrants, might
(With anger being charged home) be put to flight,
With a reserve of hope, whilst every breast
Was sweld with stiffl'd Spirits, whilst oppressed
With silent grief, helpless Spectators, they
Saw those they once for Virtue did obey,
(Their reverend Sena^ors, whose silvered heads,
Age now made fit for ease) forced from their Beds,
By feverish powers rude fits, whose hear, not all
The Jewleps of their Tears, though some drops fall
From Beauties lovely blossoms, cools their R^ge,
Neglected Youth slights like unreverent Age.
But when the conquering Captives, by the brave
Argalia rescued, from the Castle gave
Bright Vict'ries Signal, when they saw each Lance,
The bleeding head of a grim Turk advance
Anger (like unobstructed Love) breaks forth
In flaming have, yet here the Want of worth
And Valor amongst the City heard, had drove
Them all to deaths dark Fields, if whilst they strove
With that stout band of Iannizaries, they
Had not been by Argalia taught the way
To Victory, who in a sally meets
Retreating fear, when crecping from the streets,
To the vain protection of their doors, and now
His conquering Sword having taught all to bow
Beneath its burnisht splendour, since the high
Applause oth' loudest acclamations fly
Beneath his worth, a general Vote elects,
Him for their Prince, but his brave Soul affects
Not so sublime a burden, knowing they
Bred under a Democrisie, obey
Contracted power, but harshly he returns
All to their Senate, who of late like Urns
Naught but the useless Ashes did contain,
Of their own Laws, which were by Conquest sl^in.
But his refusal, where acc^ptance, not
Envy could say, Ambition had begot,
But new Plants Virtue; who from thence did take
The deeper Root, and amongst the throng did make
That choice so Epedemical, that he
For Valor feared, loved for Humility;
The peoples prayer (those humble shrubs) that ow
For safety to pow^'s Cedars) join to grow,
^hadowd beneath his Merit, and create
Him Prince oth' Senate, who (their doubtful state
Requiring strong Ailies) A Fleet prepared,
To seek those Princes, who their danger shard;
Which ready with a prosperous Gale of wind,
He (though imployd by Honor) sails to find
Out Loves rich Indiaes, and with his white winged Fleet,
Hastens Palermos nearest Port to meet.
CANTO THE FIFTH.
The ARGUMENT.
With prosperous Sails moved from Sardinia's Shore,
Argalia safe does now from danger set
The Cyprian Prince, who though so large in score,
With noble friendship soon repays the Debt.
In Sparta's Court they are now arrived, where he
That Life he saved, venters to serve him in
An Act so great, it sets the Princess free,
Who for his sake had long a Prisoner bin.
WHilst with bent Oars Argalia's Squadrons move,
Like the light wings of (Times Physician) Love,
Who steerd his course, and now had safely drawn
Him through the Ionian Waves, when by the dawn
Of a still Morning, whose pale sickly light
(Yet bounded in the Ebbony of Night)
Showed like a dull Quicksilver foil spread over
The Worlds great Glass, whose even Surface bore
Within their view two Galleons, whom they saw
(Like timorous Hares) base Hunters give no Law;
Chased by a nimble, numerous flee^. Drawn near,
Christians the chased, the Chacers Turks appear,
Which like a shole of smaller Fishes made
So bold by number, that they durst invade
The big bulkt Whale, on every side assails
The slow-paced fleet, who, since not strength prevayls
Against such ods, their fiery spirits spent
In thunder, which, had from their broad sides sent
The last great groan, for powers decease, and they
Not their Foes terror, but good fortune lay.
Whilst crampt in this convulsion of their fear
Which (honor gilding) made despair appear
The child of fortitude, they all prepare
Brave^y to die, Argalia's squadrons bare
Up with the wind, and ere the Turks proud Fleet
(Deceived by their own Crescents) fear to meet
A danger (like a Hirrocane) falls in
Destruction which was suffered whilst unseen.
So wealthy Merchants, whose returning cost
A storm on the pacifick Sea has lost,
Fall from the arms of hope. Sudden, and swift
As inundations, whose impetuous drift
Swallows a sleeping City up, had they
Lost the firm hold of Victory, and lay
Sad Captives in their own lost Ship, for flight
Saves few, where all in hopes of conquest fight
Fair Victory made more bright by accident
(Even when despair hopes wasted stock had spent)
Those that were rescued, from their soft prayers raise
To pay heavens tribute in their louder praise
Which (often neglected) debt discharged, they gave
(Allayed with thanks) to him, whose band did save
A miracle in their delivery, all
D^sev'd applause, that can when mounted, fall
In The Circle of Humanity; to kiss
Those hands which plucked him from the black Abbysse
Of Death, their brave Commander goes, where he,
(Discoverd by Majestic courtesy;
Such real forms of worth, that (he was grown
Rich in esteem, before more fully known.
But long Truth stands not veiled in a disguize
Of Ignorance, ere they are taught to prize
His Friendship at a higher rate, by seeing
Their active Valor had been blessed in freeing
The Cyprian Prince, for such he was, and then,
Bound for Morea: this made public, when
Acquaintance had taught Love more boldness, he
All that discretion would permit to be
Lodged in the Closet of a friendly Breast,
Tells to Argalia, who (though in his best
Of hopes, a Rival knowing him, was in
Love too secure to harbor envious sin.
Their prosperous Fleet, ere times short steps had trod
In hours, a full days Journey safely rod
At Anchor in Ghirenza's Bay, from whence
When known, their Cannons in a loud expense,
Proclaim their welcome; the Acquaintance that
The Cyprians Father, ere his youth stayed at
Its Summer Solstice, with Cleander had,
Revives in the Suns embraces, which the glad
City in the triumphs echoes, ere 'twas known,
That his Resolves were such, as Love was grown,
The wishes of the peoples throng, who thought
That that unpollisht Prince Zoranza brought
Unequal strength of Merit, ere to win
The Fort Pharonnida lodged Virtue in.
When first they enterd the admiring Court,
Fame (wise men's care, but the Fools busy sport)
Making the Ear the Eyes wise Harbinger,
By Learning first their Virtues, did coafer
More honor on their persons, they beheld
In The Cyprian Prince heroic worth, yet sweld
With no ambitious tumor, calm and free,
As who^esome air, when its Ubiquity
Breaths healthful blasts, where his smooth thoughts to all
Most sweetly affable, but few could call
His Love familiar, his Youth had not
Yet learnt rough War, although from Precept got
Its useful Rudiments, and by Valor shows
Future Command may pay what Action ows
To speculation; by the Grave, sad man,
Whose counsel could Conspiracies unspan,
When ready to give fire, he is beheld,
As one whose Virtues far his years excelled;
And might, when at maturity afford
Length to the Scepter, from's victorious Sword.
From this young Prince (Heavens hopeful Blossom) they
Pleal'd but not satisfied, their Souls convey
On those winged Messengers, their Eyes unto
Manly Argalia, finding there a new
And various form of worth on's Brow did sit,
Reserved discretion, reconciled to Wit.
Serious and grave his carriage, yet a Face,
Where Loves fair Shrine did Wisdoms Temple grace.
His scars (those broad Seals) which protecting sat,
His future safety signed in, on him sat
Not to deform, but until Age remain
Like M^ids of Honor placed in Beauties Train.
True worth dwelt in the other; but in this
Brave Heroes breast had her Metropolis.
The Cyprians safety, and Sardinia's brave
Redemption were the past:-ports which Fame gave
Unto his traveling praise, which fled in haste
Through the ears short stages, in each breast had placed
A Love of's worth, which wise men softly praise
Whilst the loud throng to acclamations raise.
Not long these true-born Sons of honor in
Palerino's Court remain, ere what had been
The cause which had the youthful Cyprian drew
Froms Fathers Court, white fame presents unto
Busy Inquirers; Which design from all
Those swift (but weak recruits) good wishes call
Except from some it most concerned, among which
Cleander staggers unresolved, the rich
And powerful Kingdom, which affinity
With Cyprus promised, was a prize to be
Valued before Epirus wealth, who though
Of late victorious, yet could never grow
Up to that glorious height. This thought the most
Of all the ere obstructed love, had crossed
Zoranza's hopes, had not his wishes been
(Though coveto^^ly vast) confined within
The others merits, amongst which the chief
Opposes first it self, and the relief
Whispers in's soul, that had been thence brought by
Him, when his state wept blood for liberty.
This in the Scale of Justice seemed as large
As Loves dimensions, till a second charge
Of thoughts proclaim the Cyprians power to do
The same if in necessity sought to,
Which blames becoming gratitude, as in
Relation to servility, a sin
In the great souls of Princes, who can be
If they remain in debt for courtesy
But Captives in the throne, too often the cause
Why meritorious Subjects meet the Laws
Harsh Rigor for Reward, when their Deserts
Many and great, over fill their Princes hearts.
Before Cleanders Gravity had laid
This ^empest of his Passions, Fame betrayed
Their Cause to the Epicote Prince, who hears
The Cyprians welcome, which his various fears
But briefly comment on, before without
More slow delays then what were spent about
The swiftest preparations, he intends
To visit fair Pharonnida, and ends
His Journey, ere a thought unwing'd with Love,
Could lead him forth of's Court, which have did prove
His Passions stronger then the strength of age
Appeard to promise what it might presage,
To see at once two royal strangers in
Their glorious Court, which both imployd had bin
About one amorous Errand, strangely did
Affect the Citizens, whose fears forbid
The public Stage, in private whispers tells
What danger lay betwixt those parallels.
Yet in the opposition of those Scars,
That shine in Passions sphere, Loves civil Wars
Had no field Army, all his power did rest
Within the private Garrisons oth' breast,
Which though besieged, by sly suspicion made
No verbal Sallies, but prepare t'invade
Beauties bright Province; yet, each only had
A single Visit given unto the sad
Sweet Object of their hopes, and thence received
A Welcome, such as neither had bereaved
The others hopes, both rather finding cause
Of cold despair,; Cleander pleads the Laws
Of Nature, and free choice, to wave his own
Engagements to Zoranza, which had blown
Loves sickly flame with the tempestuous breath
Of anger forth, had not those thoughts to death,
In The Bud been doomed: whilst thus his Passions slept
In Loves soft Arms, the noble Cyprian kept
A distance 'twixt his hopes and wishes by
The stayed Epicots interest, both rely
On their own Merits, and Loves doubtful sat,
Makes subject to the Monarchy of Fate.
But whilst this busy Combat of the heart
On equal terms it fought, time bent to part
The royal Champions, through the obscure Ports
Of dark disguize into Loves field resorts,
A third brave Combatant, whose Merit had
(Though not in the Armor of great Titles clad)
By parley won that Maiden Fort, which they
Although they scaled, on golden Mountains, lay
Before in vain; Argalia though within
Ghirenza's Court, had yet a stranger bin,
More then in Fame and big Report, to her
Whose best of thoughts wore his Souls Character;
And yet (although a Virgins bashful grace
Conceald her own, for to behold that Face
So much in debt to the peoples Praises) to
Her window often the royal Maid had drew,
Where whilst his eyes did wast their Beams in vain,
To pierce those stubborn Walls that did contain
Rich Loves unvalued-Treasure, she beholds
His brave Deportment, which, since strange, unfolds
New Volumes of unprinted joy, which she
(Sorrow affording so much liberty)
Often with delight looks over, beholding in it
Argalia's Virtues in a different print.
But his wise Fare, even when his prayer grew weak
In Faith, did through hopes cold Antartick break,
In a long Summers day, his noble friend
The Princely Cyprian did so largely spend
His st^ck of elo^uence in's praise when he
Last saw divine Pharonnida, that she
Although from no remoter cause then springs
From Virtues public love, tells him he brings
His next best welcome with his Friend, which proud
To be observant in, when time allowed
A visit he performs. Now to the Court,
Beauties dull Cloister, which no thronged resort
Of Clients fill they are come, the surly Guard
Those wakefull Dragons, did without reward
Let in that danger in disguise, which had
Met death in the entrance, if in that unclad.
The way that clest the scowling Rock, being by
A thousand steps ascended, they in the high
Clifts find the Royal E^glet, trying that
Bright eye of her fair soul, discretion at
The fiery beams of anger, which were shot
From her Majestic Father. Being got
Once more to breath his Soul upon that hand
Where Loves first Vows, sealed with his Lips did stand
(Knowledge inflaming passions Fever) like
Unpractic'd Saints, which miracles do strike
Into a Reverend zeal, he trembling takes
That holy Relic, which a cold fear shakes
In that warm touch. Her eyes fair splendour sho^e
Like bright Stars, in heavens trepidation
Shook with the general motion, though betwixt
The Spears of Love and Wonder they stood fixed
In their own Orbs, and their united beams
Centered on him, yet (like dead friends which dreams
Imperfectly present) his Lovely form,
As Mariners, when Land is through a storm
With doubtful joy desery'd, she sees, but yet
Knowledge had met with no prospective fit
To guide her through the dark disguize, unto
The Rode of truth, his Valor was in new
Habiliments of honor clothed, and scars
Made her Love's heaven adornd with unknown Stars.
But whilst her Recollecting spirits were
All busied, his Idea to compare
With what she a saw, sudden glance o'th eye
Disvellopes truth, that Jewel which was by
His first Protector left is seen, by which
Hope (near impoverisht with despair) grows rich
In Faith (heavens tenure). But the rushing tide
O're-flowes so much, that Loves fresh Rivers glide
Over weak natures banks, she faints, and in
A silent joy (contracted what had bin
By Love dilated) from which giddy trance
To rescue her Argalia does advance
To charge those troops of passions, which over her
Had proved vict^rious, nor did sat defer
Their Conquest long ere she displayes again
Beauties fair Banner in Loves Ivory plain.
The imprisoned spirits freed, the blood in haste,
(Fearing her Love had Wisdoms throne defaced
To beauties Frontiers flies. So mornings weep
And blush together when they over-sleep
Themselves in nights black bed. Though fears dull charm^
Whilst in the circle of Argalia's arms
Like Dreams fantastic Visions vanish. in
Her waking joys, yet knowing they had been
Betrayed into a strangers view, they both
Stood mute with passion, till the Cyprian, loath
To add more weights unto affliction, by
Imping Loves wings with noble courtesy
Fans off the Southern clouds of fear, and thus
Calms the loud storm; Doubt not because to us,
(Fair Princess) Loves mysterious Riddles are
By accident resolved, the factious war
Shall be renewd, such base intelligence,
Traitors and Spies give, when the dark offense,
Starts at discovery; if my service may
Be useful (Know) I sooner dare betray
My sins to the world, then your intentions to
A smooth Seducer: This rare interview
May be my wonder; but shall never prove
My guilt, though all the stratagems of Love
Lay open to my heart, which though unskild
In his Polemmicks, yet with truth is filled.
Since now too late to seek protection by
A faint denial, the wished privacy
Their Room afforded, gives them leave to lead
His apprehension, where conceit did read
The story of Loves civil Wars, whose Rage
Since treaty could not calm, makes him engage
His stock of power in their defense, and end
His Passions progress to let Love attend
On Friendships royal Train, what not the force
Of Earths united Beauties could divorce;
Nor Wealths, nor Honors strong Attractions draw
To other Objects, by that holy Law
Informd, as hateful Sacrilege does fly,
The bold intrusion on Loves Hierarchy.
With joy assured of such a powerful Friend
The hopeful Lovers sadder cares suspend,
To lay the platform of their safety by
A fair escape, but fear does often unty
The golden webs of Fancy, when they come
To name the means, Invention then struck dumb,
Startles into distraction; no smooth stroke
Of soft palmd flattery could ere provoke
Sleep in her watchful Dragons, nor no shower
Of ponderous Gold pierce through her sable Tower.
The harsh Commander of her surly Guard,
VVakeful as foaming Cerberus, and hard
As Parian Quars, a heart that could not melt
In Loves Alimbeck, the Slave never felt
His Darts, but when Lust gave the wound, and then
(Seard with enjoying) the blood stops again,
And leaves behind the Fever, which Disease
Now in him raged, Amphibia that could please
None but a sympathizing Nature, in
His blood had both Disease and Medicine bin
With Lusts Enchantments, thick loose glances, first
Breeding a Callenture, whose sickly thirst
Consenting, sin allays again; but long
This Monster thrives not in the dark, ere strong
By custom grown, with Impudence he dares
Affront unvaild Report, and boldly bears
Himself above those headstrong Torrents, by
Whose streams harsh Censure grew to callumny,
Which careless pride did unobstruct the way,
Through which to liberty Loves progress lay.
A short delay, which lets not Fancy rest
In idle thought, their Actions did digest
Into a Method; the succeeding Night
To that great day by whose triumphant light,
Their Annual Feasts her Birth did celebrate,
The time designed, which done, to stroke rough Fate
Into a calm, Argalia first finds out
Despised Florenza, then imployd about
Course Huswifery in the dull Country, where
She soon became a Partner of his care;
Prepares for safety with a diligence,
Whose privacy pays lavish Times expense.
Now from Nights swarthy Region rose that day,
Against which Invention taught her Babes the way
To level at delight, though she flew high
As Monarchs breasts, Beauty and Valor vie
Each other in a conquering Pride, within
A spacious field, that ought before had bin
The Theater of Martial sports, each Knight,
Whom the desire of honor did invite
By her swift Herald, Fame, were met, and all
Whom the respects of either part did call
To the Epicotes, or young Cyprians part
Repair unto their Tents, which rich in Art,
Adornd both sides oth' stately Lists, and lent
Their Beauties to be Prospects Ornament.
Near to the Scaffold every seat was filled,
With bright Court beauties, Ladies that did gild
Youth (Natures Throne of pollisht Ivory) in
Pride, there but greatness, though low Fortunes sin.
Ranged next to these the City Madams, that
Came both to wonder, and be wonderd at,
Fine (as on their first Lady-dayes) did sit
Comparing Fashions, to commend their wit;
Besides the Silkworms spoils (their husbands gain)
Jewels they wore (like Eyes in Beauties Wane)
Grown dim with Age, so dim, that they did look
As if they would been from plunderd Delphos took,
Although that sprung from Faction, yet each Face,
Was all set form, hardly affording place
For a stolen smile, save when some ticklish Lord
Strikes sail, which they could wish should come abroad,
Below, near to the overheated throng
Sweet Country beauties, such as nere did wrong
Nature with nicer Art were seated, where
Though big, rude pride cast them in Honors Rear,
Yet in Loves Province they appeard to have
Command from their acknowledgd beauty gave,
Humble their Looks, yet Virtue there kept state,
And made even Envy wish to immitate
Their Fashions, not fantastic, yet their dress
Made Gallantry in Love with comeliness.
Whilst here the learnd Astronomers of Love,
Observed how Eyes (those wandering Stars) did move,
And thence with heedful Art did calculate
Approaching changes in that doubtful state;
The Princess (like the Planet of the day)
Comes with a luster forth that did betray
The others beams into contempt, and made
The Morning Stars of meaner beauties fade,
Sadly confessing by their Languisht light,
They shone but when her absence made it Night:
Stately her look, yet not too high to be
Seen in the Valleys of Humility;
Clear as Heavens Brow was hers, her smiles to all,
Like the Suns comforts, Epidemical:
Yet by the boldest Gazer, with no less
Reverence adored, then Persians in distress;
Do that bright power, who though familiar by,
An aerie Medium, still is throned on high.
Least the ungovernd Multitude which raise
Their eyes to her, should in their lavish praise,
From zeal, to superstition grow, they are now
Drawn off, the enterd Combatants allow
Their Eyes no further leisure, but beginning
Their Martial sports, with various fate were winning
Bright Vict'ries Laurels. But I here must let
Honor in their own stories Live, the debt
I ow to promise, but extends unto
The fortune of our royal Lovers, who
(Though both concernd in this) have actions far
More full of Fate approaching, that bright Star,
Which gave Argalia Victory here, scarce shows
Its spangl'd Records unto which he ows,
Far more sublime protection, yet it lends
Vigor to that bright Planet which attends
His future fortune, and discovers all
His Astracismes in rising Cosmicall;
Followd with Acclamations, such as made
The troops of envy tremble to invade
His conquering Fame, he leaves the Field, and by
Cleander with Rewards of Victory
First honored in the public view, is brought
From thence to meet delitious mirth in soft
Retired Delights, which in a spacious flood,
From Princes breasts to tenifie the blood
Of the blunt Soldier hasts, whose dull souls sweld
With aerie pleasures had from thought expeld
All sullen Cares, and leveld paths, unto
Designs which did to their neglect ensue.
The black-browd Night to Court the drousie World,
Had put her starry Mantle on, and hurld
Into the Sea (their spacious breasted Mother)
Her dark Attendants, silent sleep did smoother
Exalted Clamours, and in private meets
The busy Whisperer sporting 'twixt his sheets,
Vaild in which shady calm, Argalia by
The noble Cyprian only, in his high
Attempt assisted, now prepares to free
The great Preserver of his liberty.
Come to the Bridge, that to secure the sleep
Oath careless Guard, which slender watch did keep,
Finding it drawn, the depth, and ugly look
Oth' heavy stream, had from the Cyprian took
All hopes of passage, till that doubt did end
In greater fear (the danger of his Friend)
Who with a Courage high, as if in that
He Would centerd all the world did tremble at,
In his precedent Victories, had cast
Himself to the mercy of the stream, and past
In safety over, though Nets enough were spread
On her dark Face to make his Deaths cold bed.
Giving his Spirits leave to fortify
His heart with breath, he then ascends the high
Opposing Clifts, which in an ugly pride,
Threatend beneath her ruined Scales to hide
That rising flame of honor; being come
To the other side a Centry, but struck dumb
With sleeps prevailing Retorick he finds,
Upon whose Keys he seizes, and then binds
His sluggish Limbs ere full awake, convays
Him to a place, whence no loud cry betrays
The sounds of danger to his Fellows, that
Reveld in louder mirth, unstartl'd at
The Rivers depth, the wondering Cyprian now
Crossed the united Bridge, and being taught how
By immitation to slight danger, goes
With his brave Friend toward their careless Foes.
Not far they were advanced, before they hear
Approaching steps, a Soldier was drawn near,
Which to relieve, the other came, but shared
In his misfortune, ere he had prepared
To make resistance, which attempt succeeds,
So equal to their wishes, that there ne^ds
No more to strengthen Faith; by the command
Oth' Will best Leader (Reason) both did stand
A while to view their danger, through a way
Narrow and dark their dreadful passage lay;
The rugged Rock upon each side so steep,
That should they have miss't, no trembling hold could keep
Them from the grasp of death; to add to this,
More forms of horror from the dark Abyss,
Which under-min'd the Rocks rough sides they hear,
A hollow murmr; the black Towers appear,
Flanckt with destruction, every part did hold
Peculiar terror, but the whole unfold,
Through the black Glass of Night, a Face like that,
Which Chaos wore, ere time was wakend at
The first great Fiat, or could ought appear,
More dark and dreadful, know 'twas emblem'd here.
Safe past through the first steps of danger, they
Now to the main Guard come, whom they betray
By a soft knock, of all conceived 't had bin
The Voice their Centry called for entrance in,
Their Errand undisputed, Postern Gates
Are open thrown, at which the royal Mates
Both rushing in, strangely amaze them, but
Now being enterd, 'twas too late to shut
The danger forth, nor could Confusion lend
Their trembling Nerves a strength fit to defend
By opposition, in base flight lay all
Their hopes of life, which some attempting fall
On the dark road of death, but few escape,
To show their fellows dangers dredful shape.
Whilst here like powerful winds that dissipate
Infectious damps in unobstructed state,
Their valor Reigned, to tell them that the way
Which led unto the Princess freedom lay,
Yet through more slippery paths of blood, with have
Wild as their Rage; Burmorch^^ Brother's placed,
That Guards Commanders enter, loose neglect,
Which drew them thence, since cause of that effect,
They now redeem with speed; Riot had not
Un-nerv'd their Limbs, although their blood grew hot,
With large intemperate Draughts, the Fever yet
In The Spirits only dwelt, till this rude fit
On the stretched heart lays hold in flames, which had
Scortcht Valors Wings, if not in Judgment clad.
Here (though their numbers equal were, yet in
A larger Volume danger had not bin
Often before presented to the view
Of the brave Champions, as if she had drew
With doubtful Art Lines in the Scheam of Fate,
For them and their proud Foes, pale Virtue sat
Trembling for fear her power should not defend
Her Followers against that strength which did attend
Those big-bon'd Villains strokes, beneath whose force
The Cyprian Prince had felt a sad divorce
Of Natures Wedlock, if when sinking in
The Icy sleep, deaths wide Gorge had not been
Stopped by a stroke from fierce Argalia sent,
To aid him when in his defense he would spent
His stock of strength, freed by which happy blow,
From Janus Guard, since now his Friend lay low*
Near Deaths dark Valley, he contracts his power,
To quench the others Lamp of Life, a shower
Of wounds lets fall on's Enemy, which now
Clogged his Souls upper Garments, and allow
His Eyes dim Optics, no more use of light,
Then what directs him in a staggering flight.
Yet in the darkness of approaching death,
In Mischiefs Sables, that small stock of breath
That yet remains to Clothe, he suddenly
Gives fire unto a Cannon that was by
Wise care ordaind to give intelligence,
When big with danger, fear could not dispense
With times delays; the Princess that within
Her Closet, had that fatal Evening bin
Retired and sad, whilst strong winged prayer acquaints
Her flaming zeal with Heavens whole Quite of Saints,
Thus startled by the treacherous thunder all
Her yet unnumberd stock of Beads lets fall
Amongst those that prayer had ranckt, and did implore
In one great shrick deliverance, to her door
Hasts to behold the danger of those Friends
On whose success (Loves fortress) hope depends.
Where being come, her eyes first progress met
Her prayers Reward, even whilst his Sword was wet
With blood (the balm of Victory) but long
The Ecstasies of Fancy, though more strong
Then sacred Raptures last not, all was now
Too full of noise and tumult, to allow
A Room for Passions flow, disputes within
The Schools of Action, loud Alarums in
The Castle, Court, and City raged, all were
Huddl'd into confusion, some prepare
To fly, what others with an Ignorance,
As great (though bolder) to oppose advance.
Here had our Heaven-protected Lovers lost,
What such large sums of prayers and tears had cost,
Had not the torrent of the peoples throng,
When rushing toward the Castle, by a strong
Voice, danger, been diverted to prevent
A hungry flame, which in the Cyprians Tent
Began, had spread its aire-dilated wings
Over the City, whose feared danger brings
On them a worse distemperature, then all
Their last Nights Surfets, whilst proud Turrets fall
In their own Ashes, the discordant Bells,
Ordaind to call for aid, but ring their Knels,
That in a drunken fury, half awake
First their warm Beds, and then their Lives forsake,
For to destruction here big pride had sweld,
Had not Nights errors been by day expeld.
With swift Calls frighted, but more terrified
At their sad Cause, Fear being his doubtful Guide;
The stout Epicote to Cleanders Court,
Repairs, and there amongst a thick resort
Of Subjects, finds the Prince distracted by
Those Epidemick Clamours that did fly
From every part oth' City, to appease
Whose fury whilst he goes, the sharp disease,
In flames feeds on her ruined beauty, and
Mounts on insulting wings, which to withstand,
The amazed Inhabitants did stop its flight,
With the whole weight of Rivers, till that light
Which an Usurper on the sooty Throne
Of darkness sat, vanished, or only shone
From their dim Torches Rays, the Prince thus stayed,
In's hasty Journey, till the flames allayd,
Lent safety to the City, by it gave
The royal Fugitives the time to save
Themselves by flight, from those ensuing ills,
Whose clamorous Scouts (rude sounds) the stird air fills.
Descended to the Gardens Postern Gate,
A place where silence yet unruffl'd sat.
A Night obscure, and an unhaunted way,
Conspiring their Pursuers to betray,
To dark mistakes, with silent Joy which had
All Fears pale symptoms in Loves purple clad;
Close as that bold Attempter, whose brave theft
Was sacred fire (the walks behind them left)
Argalia hasts unto the Castle Moat,
With his rich prize, there a neglected Boat
Half hid amongst the Willow Beds, finds ou^,
In which Pharonnida, that naught could doubt,
Whilst her successful Lover steerd, past over
To meet the safety of a larger Shore.
The end of the third Book.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book.
CANTO I.
The Argument.
I.
Whilst noise and tumult fills the Court, the sad
Orlinda to lament alone, retired,
Finds the brave Captain in deaths symptoms clad,
Whose perfect health her friendly care acquired.
II.
The Scouts with an unwelcom emptiness
Of news returned; the Princess secret flight
Yet well succeeds, but now in sad distress
Find a black morning to that dismal night.
When Fear, like an unskilful Pilot in
A storm distracted, long in vain had been
Placed at the helm of Action, whilst those rude
Waves, raised by greater winds, the Multitude
Swelled with uncertain councels, all met in
A thick and dangerous confluence, those within
The Castle by a hotter passion to
A high wrought fury startled, did undo
Those links of council, which the other broke
With corrosives of fear, by the rude stroke
Of heedless Anger, whose uncivil strife
Had rob^d Revenge of justice, and each life
That here was in deaths inundation spilt,
Shed but to aggrevate a private guilt;
Had not the Prince, whose angers flame they feared
More then grim death, to appease the storm appeared.
Beat from the outworks of their hopes, all in
A busy tumult are employed within
The Princess lodgings; but there only find
Their knowledge by her secret flight struck blind,
Stumbl'd on errors; No characters but what
The wasteful hand of death had scattered at
The Guard informs them; and even those seem left
The weak opposers of successful theft,
Dropped as their Foes victorious fate slew by,
To show his fortune, and their loyalty.
Leaving which late warm tenements of breath,
Without once throwing up that bed of death,
Their grave-cloaths ore them, every active friend
Hasts toward her search, whilst suffering females spend
The hours (grown slow since burdened by their fears)
In prayrs, whose doubts they numbered by their tears.
But amongst all of those that sacrificed
Tears to her loss, sorrow had most disguised
Lovely Orlinda, the fair sister to
The vexed Messenian, who with Love that grew
From equal attributes of Honor, in
The parallels of Beauty placed had been
In this restraint of liberty so long
Her pleased Companion, that her grief too strong
For comfort grown, to mourn her absence she
Forsaking all her friends society,
Whilst seeking of some shady grove is brought
To one whose vail, black as her darkest thought,
Appeared so much a stranger to the light,
That solitude did thither soon invite
The pensive Lady, who, whilst entering, by
A deep groans sound diverted, turns her eye
Toward one, who near the utmost ebb of life
Disguised in's blood, was with the latest strife
Of death contending; at the dreadful view
Of which sad object she retreating to
Some of her maids, who fearing to intrude
Whilst she appeared intending solitude,
A distance kept, made hold by number, now
Return to see if life did yet allow
A room for help, or if his soul were fled,
To let their care intomb the helpless dead.
Arrived so near, that through the rubric vail
Of's blood they saw how life did yet prevail
Over deaths convulsions, they behold one lie,
Whose wound's an object for their charity,
Soon drew them nearer in such trembling haste,
As if they feared those lavish springs would waste
Life's stock too fast; where come, with linen soft
And white as were those hands that thither brought
That blessing, having gently wiped away
His blood, his face discovered did betray
Him to their knowledge; for the Ciprian Prince
All soon conclude him, whose desert ever since
That Court she knew, had to Orlinda proved
A dear delight, yet she never knew she loved,
Till her soft pity, and his sad distress
Conspiring to betray that bashfulness
Whose blushes scorched that tender plant, did now
Even in their fortunes roughest storm allow
It leave to grow, safe, since yet passing by
No other name but noble charity.
By all the nimblest stratagems which Art
Ever learnt from nature, striving to impart
The best of mortal blessings, health, unto
Her Royal patient, praised Orlinda grew
So high in his deserved esteem, that though
Posterity does to his friendship ow
For their most perfect copy, knowing she
Too much adored Pharonnida to be
Her base betrayer, when his healths advance
Gave way for language, every circumstance
Declares which was in that so fatal night,
The sad preludiums to her secret flight;
By which when she whose love (though full of fire)
Yet lay raked up in a remote desire,
Unstirr'd by hope, with joy had learned that he
More then what friendship parroniz'd, was free
From all affection to the Princess, in
Her eyes, which until then had clouded bin.
Love with as bright and pure a flame as ere,
Did in the shades of modesty declare;
Passion, breaks forth, which happy signs by him
Whose heart, her eyes, even whilst they shone most dim
With mutual flames had fired, that loyal love
Which fate in vain shall struggle to remove,
Begins with flames as innocently bright
As the first rays of new created light.
But stay rash Reader, think not they are led
Through these smooth walks unto their nuptial bed;
But now, behold, that their misfortune prove,
Which thou have wept for, if thou ever did love
A separation, the suspicion that
Sparta's vexed King, when first distempered at
His daughters loss, did of this stranger Prince
Justly conceive, persuades him now that since
Not found within the Cyprian Court, that he
Who had been vainly sought abroad might be
Yet lodged at home, which supposition bred
So strict a search, that though the silent dead
Not silenter then her Attendants were,
Yet kind Orlinda whom a pious care
Prompted to save what she did yet possess,
Whilst seeking with a Lovers tenderness
How to secure him, does at length convay
Her roving fancy to this hopeful way.
Not long before, though now 'twere silenced in
Domestic ills, Report had busied been
In the relating of the sad distress
Of a brave Lybian Prince, whom heaven to bless
With an eternal Crown, in midst of all
His Youths fresh glories, by a powerful call
Summons to serve her, and that faith which he
Had from the early dawn of infancy
Sucked from the great Impostor of the East,
Though now by time Opinions strength increast,
Spite of a peoples prayers or fathers threats
Wholly forsaking; which revolt begets
So much aversion, pity could invent
Naught easier then perpetual banishment
To punish what their faith, mistaken in
Its object, terms a black Apostates sin.
Disguised in such a dress, as pity might
Expect t'encounter so distressed a Wight
As was that wandering Prince, attended by
No train but what becomes th'obscurity
Of such a fortune, to the Spartan Court
Amindor comes, where though the thick resort
Of well known friends might justly make him fear
Some treacherous eye; knowledge could never appear
Through that black vail his happy art had took
To make him like a sunburned Lybian look.
Yet what engaged them more then safety in
Prayers to heaven, his person had not bin
Not long the wonder of the Court, before
His fairer virtues which adorned him more
Then the other could disguise, did justly prove
The happy object of the Princes love,
Whose influence whilst it him to power did raise
Taught by reflex the people how to praise
That fair election, till the Pyramed
Raised to his fame, had fixed its lofty head
Above the clouds of fortune, yet not this
Fates fairest smile, a Lovers best of bliss,
A free commerce, which unsuspected might,
Though long and pleasant as the Summers light,
Be never disturbed, with fair Orlinda gives
Content such fullness, that although he lives
To all unknown but her alone, in that
Enjoyed more then ambition ever aimed at.
And now from all the fruitless diligence
Of inquisitions, and the vain expense
Of time, returned were every troop that had
True forlorn hopes been, Active in the sad
Search of Pharonnida, which ending in
A just despair, some that till then within
The Castle walls had (though as vainly) sought,
Their sorrow forth, before the grieved Prince brought
Brunorchus, whom they in a small lodge, where
Secured by sollitude, the household care
Of locks and bolts were vain unsought, they found
In the soft bands of griefs, best opiate bound,
Sleep, who though throned within her ebbon seat
From lusts hor field appears, but his retreat
When tired with action; for besides him they
Where Is poisons antidote, Amphibia lay
Blocked up in's arms, beheld the air with all
Their voices stroke at length, had raised a call
That drowned their sleeping thunder, from the bed
Brunorchus starting struggles to have fled
The shameful danger, whilst Amphibia creeps
Beneath her sheets protection, but naught keeps
Pursuing vengeance back, there took, and brought
Before the Prince, who startled at the thought
Of such a complicated crime, refers
Their punishment to death 's dire Messengers.
The yet succesfull Lovers long ever this
Safely arrived at their first stage of bliss,
Florenza's low unenvied roof, did there
Since speed was now the fairest child of care,
Stay only to exchange their horse, and take
With her a guide whose practick skill could make
Their untrod paths familiar, through a low
Dark vail where shade-affecting weeds did grow
Eternal strangers to the Sun, did lie
The narrow path, frequented only by
The forest Tyrants when they bore their prey
From open dangers of discovering day.
Past through this desert valey, they were now
Climing an easy hill, where every bough
Maintained a feathered chorister to sing
Soft Pahegyricks, and the rude winds bring
Into a murmuring slumber, whilst the calm
Morn on each leaf did hang her liquid balm,
With an intent before the next Suns birth
To drop it in those wounds which the cleft earth
Received from's last days beams, the hills ascent
Wound up by action, in a large extent
Of leavie plains, shows them the canopie
Beneath whose shadow their large way did lie:
Which being looked ore, whilst thankful praise did pay
Their debts to heaven, they thence with a convay
Of prayers (those swift ambassadors) did send
A hopeful glance towered their large journies end.
These short surveys past, since the place assures
A safe repose to cool the Calentures
Of feverish action, down a way that led
From Pleasures throne unto her fragrant bed
A rank of Laurels, spreading to protect
The flowery path, which not unprun'd neglect
Robbed of delight, they past, the slow descent
Soon brings them where her richest ornament
(Although with art unpleited) Nature in
A lovely Landshape wore, that once had been
Sacred to th'Islands fruitful Goddess; here
Whilst they behold the infants of the year
In The Springs unsullied livery clad, the fair
And large-limb'd trees, preparing to repair
Autums spent stock, from out an humble hill
A tributary fountain did distill
The earths cold blood, and murmuring convays
It on a bed of peebles, till it pays
Her debts to the neighboring river. Near to it
Full Chorusses of feathered Hero's sit
Amidst their willow-mansions, to whose ease
Their shrill notes call the sportive Driades.
Whilst by the brightest glories of that age
This Royal robe worn in a hermitage
Is seen with such a silent sad delight
As smooths the furrows of an Anchorite;
Their solemn walk had brought them to a green
Skirt of that mantle fairly spread between
Two mossie rocks, that near the crystal slood
Appendixes to larger mountains stood:
Near which they saw, with mournful majesty,
A heap of solitary ruins lie
Half-sepulchred in dust, the bankrupt heir
To prodigal Antiquity, whose fair
Composures did (beneath times pride sunk low)
But dim vestigia's of their beauty show.
Yet that it might unreverend gazers tell
It once was sacred Ceres image fell
From a thrones splendour did neglected lie
Sunk with her temple to deformity,
Dark, gloomy groves, which holy altars shade
With solitude, such as religion made
Full of an awful reverence, and drew
The ravished soul from the worlds wandering view,
Circled the sacred valley, into one
Of which our Royal Lovers were alone
Retired in private sollitude to pay
Sleeps forfeitures, whilst the bright bloomy day
Sweats the hidroptick earth, but joy denies
That sullen ghest an entrance in their eyes.
Their eyes, which now like wandering Plannets met
After a race of cross aspects, and set
Within a firmament of beauty, thence
On Loves cold Region dropped their influence;
Warmed by whose vigor, springs of pleasures had,
Watring their cheeks, those fields in roses clad.
Fear, that till now had made them languish in
A dangerous hectic, or at best had bin
But cased with intervals, which did include
Ambiguous hopes in times vicissitude,
Ceased to usurp, yet (though the throne expelled)
A large command in Reasons Empire held
Leading those parties which wise counsel sent
Close ambuscado'd dangers to prevent;
Nor could the conduct fail, assailed by ought
Within the circuit of extended thought.
Deliberation (the souls wary Scout)
Being still employed to lead fresh parties out
Against the known enemies of hope. But here
Black Troops of danger, undiscerned of fear,
Assaults unralli'd fortitude, whilst she
Slept amongst the rose-beds of security.
Exalted far above the gross mistakes
Of vulgar love, clothed in such thoughts as shakes
Ripe souls from out their husks of earth, to be
Picked up by Angels, joys Stenographie
In their embraces met; not with less strength
Of love (though yet not to be wrought at length)
Then that which meets in nuptial folds when they
Reap Heavens first blessing, in their bloods allay
Met their full seas of passion, yet both calm
As virtues brow, their blood but warmed like balm
To pour in sorrows wounds, not boild into
A scum of lust, The worlds first man did woe
The blushing off^pring of his side, the first
Unpractickt Virgin, with as great a thirst
Of blood as theirs, when in the safe defense
Of Paradise each act was innocence.
Here whilst their sweet employment was discourse
Taught in the School of Virtue, to divorce
Those maiden brides, their twisted eye-beams, sleep
Which flies the open gates of care, did creep
In at their cristal windows to remove
The lamp of joy, filled with the oil of love.
The Princess spirits fled from the distress
Of action into calm for getfulness
Having the Curtains drawn, Argalia's head
Softly reposing on her lap (that bed)
Of precious odors, there receives a while
A rest, for sweetness such as Saints beguile
Time in, in their still dormitories till
Heavens summons shall their hopes on earth fulfill.
Removed from them, feeding his horses in
A well-fle^^'d meddow which that age had seen
Till then never loose its Summer robe before,
Russet with age, he put it off, and wore
A glittering tissue furred with snow, did lie
Their careful guide, secure, till frighted by
A dreadful noise of horse, whose rushing wakes
Him to behold; what seen with terror shakes
Off sleeps declining weights, in such a strange
Amaze as (forts surprised) the skar'd guards, change
Their swords for Fetters, flying he looks back
On the steel fron^ed troop, till at his back
Approaching danger gathering in a cloud
Of death overwhelms him, frighting with its loud
Exalted clamors from their then closed eyes,
(Loves altars,) sleeps intended sacrifice.
Shook from their slumber with the first salutes
Of light to meet their ruin, thick recruits
Of brave resolves into Argalia's breast,
Had swiftly summoned; but the Princess rest.
Exchanged for wild amazement, in which sad
Restraint of spirits, life with beauty had
Fled to the silent Region, if not by
Her Royal friend supported, who the high
Pitch of exalted anger, whilst he draws
His sword to vindicate their righteous cause,
Descends to comfort her, thinking those troops
Her Fathers Messengers, his brave soul stoops
Not to request a favor; but although
Their multitude, in hopes account outgrow
Life more then those diseases which attend
On ages cold extreme, he dares defend
Love, though by vigor of supreme commands
Deprived of favor's mercinary Bands.
Prompted by power that sovereign antidote
Against Natures poison, baseness and by roate)
Not Arts fair Rules, taught Lessons of defense:
These dregs of men, not having more pretense
Then what from Riot was extorted, in
Unwieldy throngs the conquest strive to win
From single valor, not the powerful prayer
Of her whose voice had purified the air
To a seraphick excellence, the sweet,
Heaven loved Pharonnida could come to meet
Pity in this rude wilderness, her words
Losing their form in the wild air affords
Their busy souls no heedfull leisure, but
With wilder passions the soul's portals shut.
That sober friend to happy sollitude,
Silence, which long those blessed shades did include,
By rude noise banished from her solemn Throne,
Did in a deep and hollow echo groan;
Whilst the brave Champion, whose own worth did bring
Assistance, yet had in a bloody ring
Strewn death's pale triumphs, and in safety stands
The dangerous business of so many hands,
All which had in the grave joined palms, if by
One stroke that index unto victory,
His sword, had not with sudden breaking proved
Traitor to the strength by whose command it moved.
Robbed of this safe defense, Valors brave flame
In vain is spent, that Piramis of fame
Built by his hand over Loves fair temple, now
Even in the view of 's Saint is forced to bow
Beneath an earthquake, his commanding soul
In this sharp conflict, striving to control
Nature, (rebellious to her power) lets fly
In vain the piercing lightning of the eye,
Whose dark leads drooping in a death like close,
Forbids high fury thundering on his soes.
He falls, and from each purple salliport
Of wounds, tired spirits, in a thick resort
Fly the approach; in which wild trance
His eyes did their declining lights advance
Above their gloom of darkness to convay
The last faint beam of natures falling day
To his distressed Pharonnida: but she
In clouds of sorrow lost, was gone to be
Close mourner for his rigid fare beneathe
A pale sowns shady vale, and could not breathe
One sigh to welcome those sick guests, nor lend
A beam to light them to their journies end;
Which being deprived of, in deaths dark disguise
Forgetful shadows did obscure his eyes.
Branded with an ignoble victory,
His base oppressors, staying not to try
Where fire remains in life's dark lamp, forsake
Their bleeding shame, and only with them take
The trembling Ladies, whose amazement yet
Griefs floodgates shuts in a distracting fit
Of wilder passions, circled in which cloud
She Is hurried thence; and ere that damp aloud
Light through her souls prospectives, had past ore
Much of the Desert, and arrived before
A barren Rocks proud front; which being too steep
For the laborious traveller, a deep
Dark vault did pierce, whose dismal black descent
Safe passage to a distant valley lent.
With slow ill-boding steps, this horrid way
Overcome, they meet the Beauties of the day
Within the pregnant vale, a place that showed
Some art had pruned what natures hand bestowed.
No earth-encumbring weeds, but wholesome plants
Such as relieve the winter of our wants,
Were here in comely order placed, each tree
Tired with his fruitful burden stoops to be
Eased by the lowliest hand; for want of which
Their feeble stems had dropped them to enrich
Their pregnant mother; this civilitie
Proclaiming more then art had meant to be
The dress of deserts, did at first appear
As if those useful blessings had for fear
That wasteful man should ravish them to feed
his luxury, fled thither; none that need
Such thrifty joys in the circumference
Oth' valley seeming to have residence.
All whose exalted pride did terminate
The levelled eye, was a round hill that sat
As center to the golden vale, come near
To which, what did externally appear
A rock in ivy dressed, being entered showed
The beauties of a gorgeous palace, hewed
Out of the living stone, whose vaulted breast
Had by the union of each part expressed
The strength of Concord; The black Rock was all
Tinsell'd with windows, over which did fall
Thin Ivy-wreaths, like Cobweb-vails that shade
The salliports of Beauty, only made
To cool, not darken, and on those that sit
Within bestow a shady benefit.
They being drawn near, a sad old man that sat
Unwilling Porter, from the spacious gate
Withdrew the verdant curtain, she is now
Entered the Castle, where could fear allow
Her eyes that liberty she had survai'd,
Buildings, whose strength with beauty joined, betrayed
Times modern issues to contempt, and by
A lasting glory praised antiquity.
But Pleasure spreads her baits in vain, she sat
Beneath the frozen Artick of her fate,
Whilst he from whose aspect she only felt,
Delightful heat, in's winter-solstice dwelt.
More to depress her sinking spirits, she
Too soon finds cause to think that gravitie
She met in the entrance, but the reverend shade
Of injured worth, which accident had made
Stoop to that bondage, virtue drooping in
His furrowed cheeks, as if deposed, she would bin
Thither confined within the walls, to let
Imperious vice her painted banners set.
A troop of wild Bandits, vilains whose guilt
Shunned public haunts, heavens private blessings spilt
There in luxurious riot, which grown bold
By toleration, durst to the light unfold
Vices deformedst issues; naught by the name
Of sin being known, but sins betrayer, shame.
In such a loose intemperance as raigns
In conquered cities, when the soldiers pains
With spoils of peace is paid, they lived: amongst these
Some few unhappy women kept to appease
Lusts tumults, she beheld, whose looks betrayed
A sickly guilt, and made the Royal maid
Amidst her griefs cold symptoms blush to see
How pale they looked with Lusts deformity.
Whilst these are viewed, with such a change as that
Poor Village-drunkards are enforced to at
An Officers approach, when the night grows
Deep as their draughts, she sees them all compose
Their late wild looks; nor was this dress of fear
In vain put on, Almanzor did appear
Dreaded Almanzor, who on them had built
A power, which though by unsuccessful guilt
Banished to the desert, forced their wants to be
The helpless sufferers of his tyranny.
Past through the fear dispersed throng, he is to
The Princess come, where startled at the view
Of Majesty, shrinks back, unsteady haste
Which brought him there but to view Beauties placed
Within the reach of 's lust, assaulted by
Objects that both to love and loyalty
Had proved him an apostate, to retreat
Within a blush attempts; but that is too great
A friend to bashful virtue in that face
Whose heart deposes her, to sprinkle grace.
Ruffled with this recoil of spirits, in
Such troubled haste as Novices begin
New conn'd orations, he himself applies
To the injured Lady, whose brave spirit flies
Not what she feared, but with the brave defense
Of scorn opposes blushless impudence,
Crushing the embrio's of that language, in
Whose guilty accents he attempts to win
Opinions favor, and by that redeem
What former guilt had lost in her esteem.
Contemned with such a look as Princes cast
On over-bold usurpers, he is past
The first encounter of her eye, and she
Turned in disdain to show her great soul free
From low submission, by which fired into
A sullen anger, he resolves to mew
The Royal Eaglet, until freedom grow
A favor whose fair streams might overflow
Those barren fields of indesert, in which
His fortune pines, lest this fair prize enrich
The cursed soil, and on its surface place
The long abstracted beams of princely grace.
She to the narrow confires of a room
Restrained to let his rufl'd thoughts resume
Their calm composure (counsels throne) he goes
Aside, and on that doubtful text bestows
The clearest comment of his judgment, yet
Falls short of truth, and must contented sit
To know her there, though not the accident
Which from her fathers glorious Court had sent
Her so ill guarded; but referring that
To times discovery, he transported at
What was a truth confirmed, within the wide
Arms of his hope, grasps, what aspiring pride
Or lusts loose Rhet'rick, when youths rigrous fire
Beauty has kindled, prompts him to desire.
Yet by two several paths to tread that way
His crime's dark roads, Lust and Ambition lay,
The poor Florenza, that long since had been
The trembling object of the baser sin,
To make his sly access to either free
From the others thoughts, must from her Lady be
In this dark storm removed, he fearing less
That counsel aiding virtue in distress,
Though wanting strength the battle to maintain,
Might countermine the engine of his brain.
To this sad separation leaving them
Whom innocence had licensed to condemn
Fortunes harsh discipline, Almanzor goes
Fates dark enigma's, by the help of those
That took her to unvail, but 'twas a work
Too full of subtle mystery, a Turk
Her brave Defender, by those garments which
Rash fear had only refled to enrich
Nice inquisition seemed, by which betrayed
To dark mistakes, his policy obeyed
Domestic counsels, and by subtle spies
Whose ears were more officious then their eyes,
Soon from the lovesick Ladies close complaints
His wiser knowledge with their cause acquaints.
The End of the First Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO II.
The Argument.
I.
From all the hopes of Love and Liberty
Overwhelmed in the vast Ocean of her grief,
The wretched Princess is constrained to be
A Prisoner to her youths first dreadful thief.
II.
The cursed Almanzor, in whose dismal Cell
She comments on the various ^eats of grief
In every form, till from the tip of Hell,
When seeming darkest, just Heaven sent relief.
DIstracted in the agony of Love
Pharonnida, whose sad complaints did prove
Her sorrows true Interpreters, had made
Argalia's name, wrapped up in sighs invade
The ears of an unseen Informer, whence
Almanzor's thoughts, delivered from suspense,
Shake off their doubtful dress of fears, and teach
Hypocrisy by paths untrod to reach
The Apex of his hopes. What not the fear
Of ills, whilst her own interest did appear
The only sharer, could perform, he now
Presumes affection to her Friend would bow
With low submission, if by that she might
Aid his dim Stars with a reserve of light.
With frequent visits, which on sins dark Text
Wrought a fair gloss, Almanzor often had vexed
The calmer passions of the Princess in
To rufled anger; but when all could win
No entrance on her favor, fury tries
A harsher corrosive, stern power denies
Her even of those poor narrow comforts which
Her souls dark region, that was only rich
In sorrows sables, could possess. Withdrew
Were all those slippery Parasites that knew
To her no pity, but what did reflect
The rays o'th Tyrants favor, whose neglect
Taught them the Lesson of disdain, whilst she
Her practiced soul trained in humility.
Pensive as an unpractic'd Convert in
A Bath of tears, she shadowed lies within
The unfrequented room, a curtain bed
Her close retreat, till Lights fair Angel fled
The swarthy Region. But whilst here she lies
Like a dark lanthorn that in black disguise
Circles imprisoned Light --
Grief from the sullen world concealed to turn
The troubled stream, as if the silent urn
Of some dead friend to private sorrow had
Summoned her thither, entered was a sad
And sober Matron, in her hands she bore
A light whose feeble rays could scarce restore
The sick successor of the day unto
A cheerful smile. Sad Pilgrims that renew
Acquaintance with their better Angels by
Harsh penitence, have of humility
Less in their looks then she, her habit showed
Like costly ruins that for fashion owed
To elder pride, in whose reversion she
Appeared the noble choice of charity.
This shadow of religious virtue drawn
Near her disordered bed, a sickly dawn
Of light breaks through the Princess clouded eyes
To meet the welcome object, the disguise
Of sorrow, which at first appearance sat
Fixed on her brow, a partner of her fate
Making her seem; nor was the fancy crushed
In The infancy of faith, fair truth first blushed
For verbal crimes, near to the bed reposed
Where the sad Lady lay, she thus disclosed
Her cause of entrance. Cease (fair stranger) to
Monopolize a sorrow which, not you
Here share alone; pity instructed by
Experience in the rules of misery
Has brought me from complaining of my own
To comfort thine; this Castle once has known
Me for its Mistress, though it now behold
Me (in the dress of poverty grown old)
Despised and poor, the scorn of those that were
Nursed into life by my indulgent care.
This in her tears overflowing language spoke
Persuades the pensive Princess to revoke
Depraved opinions doom, confessing she
Wedded not grief to singularity.
But comfort in the julip of her words
Was scarce dissolved, e're a reply affords
Conceived requital, striving to prevent
The (often more forward) thanks. Rise to content,
Fair soul, she cries, be but so wise to let
Sick passion die with just neglect, I Will set
Thy dropped Stars in their orbs again; I have
(Forced by command) a late attendance gave
Unto a wounded stranger that remains
Within this Castle in the heavy chains
Of cruel bondage, from whose weight unless
Your Love redeem him, dark forgetfulness
Will draw the curtains of the grave about
His dull mortality, and the sick doubt
Of hope resolve in death, this evening I
Ore heard his heavy doom, from which to fly
He has no refuge but your mercy, which
Stripped of light passion, must be clothed in rich
But graver robes of reason, when it sits
In counsel how to reconcile the fits
Of feverish love, when being most propense
To passions heat, a frost of abstinence
Benums it to a Lethargy. In brief,
It Is he whose prosperous tyranny the chief
Command within this castle gave, that in
His swift destruction does attempt to win
Free passage to enjoying you, then prove
He friend to him that begs you to change love
For now more useful pity, and so save
A life that must no longer live to crave,
If now denied. This Ring (with that presents
A jewel, that when loves first elements
The harmony of faith united, she
Gave to confirm her vows) he sends to be
A note that he denies what ever was made
Authentic, when your mixed vows did invade
Unwilling Heaven, which in your sufferance shows
We may intend, but wiser powers dispose.
Pharonnida, whose fears confirmed did need
No more to wound a fancy that did bleed
At all the springs of passion, being by
The fatal Present taught whose liberty
Her Loves exchange must purchase, with a sad
Reverse o'th eye beholding it, unclad
Her sorrow thus: And did, oh did this come
By thy commands, Argalia! no, by some
Unworthy hand you are robbed of it, I know
Thou sooner would be tempted to let go
Relics of thy protecting Saint: Oh, cease
What ever you are, to wrong him, the calm peace
He wears to encounter death in, cannot be
Scattered by any storm of fear: would he
That has affronted death in every shape
Of horror, tamely yield unto the rape
Of 's Virgin honor, and not stand the shock
Of a base Tyrants anger; but I mock
My hopes with vain fantasms, it is the love
He bears to me carries his fear above
The orb of his own noble temper, to
An unknown world of passions, in whose new
Regions ambitious grown, it scorns to fall
Back to its Center, Reason, whither all
The lines of action until now did bend
From's souls circumference; yet know his end
If doomed unto this cursed place, shall tell
The bloody Tyrant that my passing bell
Tolls in his dying groans, and will e're long
Ring out in death, if sorrow when grown strong
As fate, can raise the strokes of grief above
The strength of nature; which if not, yet love
Will find a passage where our souls shall rest
In an eternal union, whilst oppressed
With horror he, by whose command he dies,
Falls to the infernal powers a Sacrifice
If that your pity were no ficton, to
Betray my feeble passions, and undo
The knots of resolution, tell my Friend,
I live but to die his, and will attend
Him with my prayers (those verbal angels) till
His soul's on the wing, then follow him, and fill
Those blanks our Fate left in the lines of life
Up with eternal bliss, where no harsh strife
Of a dissenting Parent shall destroy
The blooming springs of our conjugal joy.
Vexed by this brave display of fortitude
To sullen anger, with a haste more rude
Then bold intrusions, lusts sly advocate,
Forsakes her seat, and though affronts too late
Came to create a blush, yet passion had
Her cheeks in red revenges livery clad;
Her eyes like Saturn's in the house of death,
Heavy with ills to come, her tainted breath
Scattering infectious murmurs, with a look
Oblique and deadly, the cursed Hag forsook
That ebbon cabinet of grief, and hastes
To tell Almanzor how his passion wastes
More spirits in persuasions hectique, then
If power had quenched ambitions fever when
'Twas first inflamed with hope, whose cordials prove
Often slow as opiates in the heat of love.
This, with a heat that spoild digestion, by
The angry Tyrant heard, rage did unty
The curles of passion, whose soft trammels had
Crisp'd smooth hypocrisy, from which unclad
Disvellop'd nature shows her unfil'd dress
Rough as an angry friend, by no distress
Of beauty to be calmed, since sly deceit
Virtue had now unmasked, no candid bait
Conceals his thoughts, which soon in public shows
From what black Sea those mists of passion rose.
Days sepulcher, the ebbon arched night
Was raised above the battlements of light;
The frenzy'd worlds allaying opiate, sleep,
Oretaking action, did in silence steep
The various fruits of labor, and from thence
Recovers what pays for her times expense.
In which slow calm, whilst half the drowsy earth
Lay in the shade of nature, to give birth
Unto the burden of sick fancy, fear,
Groans, deep as deaths alarms, through her ear
Fly toward the throne of Reason, to inform
The pensive Princess, that the last great storm
Of fate was now descending, beyond which
Her eyes (orewhelm'd in sorrow) must enrich
Their orbs with love no more; but in the dawn
Of Life behold her Friends destruction drawn,
Since threatened danger sad assurance gives
In those deep groans he now but dying lives.
More swiftly to destroy the falling leaves
Of blasted hope, with horror she receives
By a convey of wearied light, that stroke
Through rusty grates, intelligence which shoke
The strength of fortitude, there was a room
Deep and obscure, where in a heavy gloom
The unstirr'd air in such a darkness dwelt
As masked Egyptians from Heavens vengeance felt,
Till by the struggling rays of a faint lamp
Forced to retreat, and the quicksilver damp
Shed on the sweaty walls, which hid within
That glittering vail, worn figures that had been
The hieroglyphick epitaphs of those
Which charity did to the earth dispose
In friendships last of Legacies, except
What is to cure loose fames diseases kept.
Here amongst the ruins of mortality,
In blood difigur'd, she beholds one lie
Who though disguised in death's approach, appears
By's habit (that confirmer of her fears)
Her gentle Love, alone, and helpless in
The grasp of death, striving in vain to win
The field from that grim Tyrant, who had now
Embalmed him in his blood, and did allow
Him no more spirits, but what in that strife
Served to groan out the Epilogue of life
And then depart natures cold stage, to be
Sucked up from time into eternity.
When thus the ever lasting silence had
Locked up his voice, and death's rude hand unclad
His hovering soul, whose elemental dress
Is left to dust and dark forgetfulness
When natures lamps being snuft to death, he lay
A night-piec'd draught of once well-modell'd clay;
With such a silent pace as witches use
To tread ore graves when their black arts abuse
Their cold inhabitants, his murderers were
Entered the vault, from the stained floor to bear
The cold stiff coarse, which having softly laid
In's doom-days bed, unto the royal Maid,
Whose beauty in this agony defaced
Griefs emblem sat, with eager speed they haste.
Either a guilty shame, or fear to be
Converted by her forms divinity,
Made them choose darkness for protection, in
Whose hideous shade, she of her self unseen
Is hurried thence unto that dreadful place
Where he entombed lay, whom she must embrace
In death's dark lodgings, and ever life was fled
Remain a sad Companion of the dead,
Confining beauty in youth's glorious bloom
To the black prison of a dismal tomb,
Where fast enclosed, Earth's fairest blossom must
Unnaturally be planted in the dust,
Where life's bright Star, Heavens glorious influence,
Her soul in labor with the slow suspense
Of lingering torments must expecting lie
Till famine Natures ligatures untie.
And can, oh, can we ever hope to save
Her that is in life a Tenant to the Grave!
Can ought redeem one that already lies
Within the Bed of Death, whose hot lust fries
In the enjoyment of all beauties that
The aged World ever had to wonder at;
To feed whose riot, the well tempered blood,
That sanguine youth's smooth cheek, mixed with a flood
Of harsh distemperatures, overflows and brings
Some to their lodgings on the flaming wings
Of speedy fevers, whilst the others creep
On slow consumptions, millions from the steep
And dangerous precipice of war: Some in
A stream of their own humors that have bin
Swelled to a dropsy, being even pressed to death
By their own weight, whilst others part with breath
From bodies worn so thin, they seemed to be
Grown near the souls invisibilitie.
But whither strayes our fancy? have we left
The woeful Lady in a tomb bereft
Of all society, and shall I let
My wandering pen forsake her? such a debt
Would banckrupt pity. The undistinguished day
Whose newborn light did but even then display
Its dewy wings, when first she was confined
To the dark tomb, was now grown almost blind
With age, when thus through fates black curtin broke
Unlooked for light, that darkness which did choke
All passages by which the thin air held
Commerce with neigboring rooms, being now expelled
By the dim tapers glimmering beams let fall
Part of the rays through an old ruined wall
That fenced an ugly dungeon, where the night
Dwelt safe as in the Center; by the fight
Of which unlooked for guest some prisoners who
Had there been stayed, even till despairing to
Be ere released, in eager fury tries
To force their way, where their directing eyes
Led by the light should guide them, come at length,
Where with times burden tired the buildings strength
Losing its first firm union was divorced
With gaping clefts, an easy strength enforced
Those feeble guards; but come into the room
Where ore the living Ladies sable tomb
Hung the directing light, they there in vain
For further passage seeking, were again
To the black dungeon, horrors dismal seat,
In sad despair making their slow retreat.
Now near departing, a deep doleful groan
Reversed their eyes, amazement almost grown
To stupefaction stays them, whilst they hear
New sighs confirm their wonder, not their fear;
Till thus Euriolus, whose bold look spoke
The braver soul, the dismal silence broke.
What ere thou art that hoverest here within
This gloomy shadow, speak what wrong has bin
Thy troubled Ghost's tormenter, art thou fled
From woe to stir the dust of the peaceful dead?
Or come from sacred shadows to lament
Some friends dead coarse, which this dark Tenement
Has lodged in dust. The trembling Lady hearing
A humane voice again, and now not fearing
The approaches of a greater danger, cries,
What ere you are, fear mo^ks your faith, here lies
A woeful wretch int^mb'd alive, that nere
Must look on light again, my spirit were
Blessed if resolved to air, but here it must
A sad companion in the silent dust
To Loathed corruption be, until the pale
Approaching Fiend, harsh famine, shall exhale
In dews of blood the purple moisture, that
Fed life's fresh springs; but now shall tremble at
My doleful story, it is enough that fate
Has for this tomb exchanged a throne of state.
To active pity stirred, the valiant friends
Attempt her rescue, but their labor ends
In fruitless toils, the ponderous marble lies
With too much weight to let the weak supplies
Of humane strength remov't, which whilst they tried
To weary sweats, kind fortune lends this guide
To their masked virtue; the informing ear
Proclaims approaching steps, which ushered fear
Into Ismander's breast; but his brave friend
(The bold Euriolus) resolved to end
By death or victory their bondage, goes
Near to the gate, where soon were entered those
Which in Pharonnida's restraint had bin
The active engines of that hateful sin,
With them, that Hag whose cursed invention had
Revenge in such an uncouth dressing clad.
Whilst her Ismander seized, and with a charm
Of nimble strength commands the active arm
Of fierce Euriolus, directed by
Victorious valor purchac'd liberty
By strokes whose weight to dark destruction sunk
His worthless foes, and sent their pale souls drunk
With innocent blood stagg'ring from earth, to be
Maskt in the deserts of eternity.
This being beheld by her whose hopes of life
With them departed, she concludes the strife
Of inquisition by directing to
An engine which but touched would soon undo
That knot which puzzled all their strength, and give
The captive Princess hopes again to live
Within the reach of light, whose beams whilst she
Unfolds her eyes (those dazzled stars) to see,
Dark misty wonder in a cloud orespread
His faith that raised her from that gloomy bed:
Amazed Euriolus, whose zeal-guided eyes
Soon knows the Princess through griefs dark disguise,
Could his inflamed devotion into one
Great blast of praises be made up, t'had gone
Toward heavenly bowers on the expanded wings
Of his exalted joy, nor are the springs
Of life less raised with wonder in the breast
Of's royal Mistress, whose free soul expressed
As much of joy as in her clouded fate
With reason at the helm of action sat.
Here had they maskt in mutual wonder stayed
T'unriddle fate, had not wise Fear obeyed
Reasons grave dictates, and with eager speed
Urge their departure, for whose guide they need
No more but her directions, who then lay
Taught by the fear of vengeance to obey
Their just demands, by whom informed of all
That might within the Castles circuit fall
With weights of danger, and taught how to free
Confined Florenza, to meet liberty,
They march in triumph, leaving none to take
Possession there, but her whose guilt would make
The torment just, though there constrained to dwell
Till death prepared her for a larger hell.
Whilst sleeps guards doubled by intemprance reigned
Within the walls, with happy speed they gained
The Castles utmost ward, and furnished there
With such choice horses as provided were
For th'Outlaws next days scouts; A glad adieu
Of their loathed jail they take: Ismander knew
Each obscure way that in their secret flight
Might safety promise; so that sullen night
Could not obstruct their passage, though through ways
So full of dark meanders, not the days
Light could assist a stranger, ere the dawn
Of The wakeful morn had spread her vails of lawn
Ore the fair Virgins of the Spring, there past
That silvan labyrinth, and with that had cast
Their greatest terror off, and taught their eyes
The welcome joys of liberty to prize.
And now the spangled squadrons of the night
Encountering beams had lost the field to light,
The morning proud in beauty grown, whilst they
With cheerful speed past on the levelled way
By solitude secure, of all unseen
Save early Laborers that resided in
Dispersed poor cottages, by whom they are viewed
With humble reverence, such as did delude
Sharp-ey'd suspicion, they are now drawn near
Ismanders palace, whose fair towers appear
Above the groves, whose green enamel lent
The neighboring hills their prospects ornament.
A River whose unwearied bounty brings
The hourly tribute of a thousand Springs
From several fragrant valleys here, as grown
So rich, she now strove to preserve her own
Streams from the all-devouring Sea, did glide
Betwixt two hills which nature did divide
To entertain the smiling Nymph, till to
An entrance where her silver-eye did view
A wealthy vale she come, a vale in which
All fruitful pleasures did content enrich;
Where all so much deserved the name of best,
E^ch took a part seemed to excel the rest.
Rounded with spacious meads, here scattered stood
Fair Country-farms, whose happy neighborhood,
Though not so near as justling Palaces
Which trouble Cities, yet had more to please
By a community of goodness in
That separation. Natures hand had been
To all too liberal, to let any want
The treasures of a free inhabitant,
Each in his own unrack'd inheritance
Where born expired, not striving to advance
Their levelled fortunes to a loftier pitch
Then what first styled them honest, after rich;
Sober and sweet their lives, in all things blessed
Which harmless Nature living unopprest
With surfeits did require: Their own Flocks bred
Their homespun garments, and on that they fed
Which from their Fields or Dairies plenteous store
Had fresh supplies: what fortune lent them more
Then an indifferent mean, was sent to be
The harbingers of hospitality.
Fair Virgins in their youths fresh April dressed,
Courted by amorous Swains, were unopprest
By dark suspicion, Ages sullen spies,
Whose spleen would have the envious counted wise.
Love was religious here, and for to aw
Their wilder passions, conscience was their law.
More to complete this rural happiness,
They were protected from the harsh distress
Of long-wing'd power by the blessed neighborhood
Of brave Ismander, whose known greatness stood
Not to eclipse their humble states, although
It shadowed them when injured power did grow
To persecution, by which means he proved
Not feared for greatness, but for goodness loved.
Which gentle passion his unhappy loss
Had sowr'd to grief, and made their joy their cross.
But now their antidote approaches, he
From heavy bondage is returned to be
Their joyful wonder, at his Palace gate
Being now arrived, his Palace that of late
With His absence dimmed in her most beauteous age
Stood more neglected then a Hermitage
Or sacred buildings, when the sinful times
To persecution aggravate their crimes.
But being entered, sadder objects took
Those outside wonders off, each servants look
Spoke him a sullen mourner, grave and sad,
Their sober carriage, in no liveries clad
But doleful sable, all their acts like those
Of weeping wives, when they to the grave dispose
Their youthful husbands; yet all these were but
Imperfect shadows of a sorrow, put
In distant landscape, when to trial brought
Near his fair Ammida's, whose grief had sought
As dark a region for her sad retreat
As desperate grief ere made pale sorrows seat
In sacred temples the neglected lamp
So wastes its oil, when Heresies do cramp
Religions beams, with such a heavy look
Monarchs deposed behold themselves forsook
By those that flattered greatness, shut from all
Those glorious objects of the world that call
Our souls in admiration forth, her time
Being spent in grief, made life but Natures crime.
The rough disguise of time assisted by
The meager gripe of harsh captivity,
Had now expunged those characters by which
Ismander once was known, and even the rich
In love and duty rendered strangers to
Their honored Master, from whose serious view
Neglective grief withdraws them, so that he
An unknown Pilgrim might have gone to be
Theirs and his own afflictor, had that fear
Not thus been cured* A Spaniel being of dear
Esteem to Ammida, since the delight
Of her Ismander once, come to the sight
Of's first protector, stays not till a call
Invites acquaintance, but preventing all
The guides of reason by the sleights of sense,
Fawning on's Master, checks the intelligence
Of's more forgetful followers, which being seen
By an old servant, whose firm youth had been
Spun out amongst that family, till by
Grave age surprised, it led his sober eye
To stricter observations, such as brought
Him near to truth, and on contracted thought
Raised a belief, which though it durst conclude
Naught on the dark text; yet in the magnitude
Of hope exalted by his joy he hastes
To's mourning Mistress, tells her that she wastes
Each minute more she spends in grief, if he
Dares trust his eyes t'inform his memory.
Contracted spirits starting from the heart
Of doubtful Ammida, to every part
Post through the troubled blood, a combat fought
Betwixt pale fear and sanguine hope, had often
Won and lost battails in her cheeks, whilst she
Leaving her sullen train, did haste to see
Those new come guests: But the first enterview
Unmasks Ismander, winged with love she flew
To his embraces; 'twas no faint disguise
Of a course habit could betray those eyes
Into mistakes, that for directors had
Loves powerful optiques, Nuptial joys unclad
In all their naked beauties, no delight
So full of pleasure, the first active night
Being but a busy and laborious dream
Compared with this, this, that had swelled the stream
Of joy to fainting surfeits, whose hot strife
Had overflowed the crimson-sea of life,
If not restrained by a desire to keep
What each had lost in the eternal sleep.
But now broke through the epileptique mist
Of amorous rapture, rallied spirits twist
Again their optique cordage, whose mixed beams
Now separate, and on collateral streams
Dispersed expressions of affection bore
To each congratulating friend that wore
Not out those favors with neglect, but by
A speedy, though unpractick sympathy
Met their full tide of bliss; glad fame which brings
Truths messages upon her silver-wings,
In private whisper hovers for a while
Within the palace, every servants smile
Invites a new spectator, who from thence
(Proud to be author of intelligence
So welcome) hastes till knowledge ranged through all
Diffusive joy made epidemical:
For though that noble family alone
Afforded pleasure a triumphant throne,
Yet frolic mirth did find a residence
In every neighbors bosom; they dispense
With their allegiance to their labor, and
Revel in lusty cups, the brown bowls stand
With Amber-liquor filled, whose fruitful tears
Dropped loved Ismander's health, till it appears
In sanguine tincture on their cheeks: All now
Had, if not calmed their passions, smoothed a brow
To temporize with pleasure. The sad story
Of his own fortune, and that Ages glory,
Pharonnida, whilst each attentive dwells
On expectation, brave Ismander tells.
The End of the Second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO III.
The Argument.
I.
From the sad consort of her silent grief
The Princess does with pleasing wonder hear
Poor Vanlore's fate, and the unjust relief
Which his unworthy Father freed from fear.
II.
Whose hell-deep plots the dregs of avarice
Had so defiled, that whilst he seeks for aid,
His subtlety masked on the road of vice,
By his presumed Assistant is betrayed.
COmposing time did now begin to slack
The rain of mirth; exalted Joy shrunk back
From Pleasures summer-solstice, and gave way
For more domestic passions to obey
An Oeconomick government, which brought
Loose fancy on the wings of serious thought
Back to her sober home, in that to find
Those several burdens that were left behind
In the carier of mirth, amongst which number
Pharonnida that had let sorrow slumber
In the high room of joy, awakes again
That clamorous elf, which she must entertain
At Beauties cost: Yet in this dark retreat
From Pleasures throne to Sorrows dismal seat
She finds a sweet Copanion, one that had
By fatal love opposed, with loss unclad
Delight of all his summer-robes, to dress
Her trembling soul in sables of distress.
The sad Silvandra (for surviving fame
Has on record so charactered her name)
Being sister to returned Ismander, in
This flourish of triumphant joy had bin
So much eclipsed with grief, that often her tears
Dimmed Beauties rays, whilst through them she appears
A fit Companion for the Princess to
Twist those discourses with, whose mourning clue
Led through the labyrinth of their lives. They often
In shades as secret as their closest thought
With pensive paces meeting, sit and tell
Stories so sad, that naught could parallel
But Love, and Loss, a theme they both had bin
By rigid power made hapless Students in.
One eyebright morning tempting them to take
The start of time, soon as the Lark did wake,
Summons them from the Palace to the side
Of a small Wood, whose bushy crest the pride
Of all the flowery plains, they chose to be
Against the invading sun their canopie.
Reposed beneath a full-grown tree that spread
His trembling arms to shade their fragrant bed,
They now are sat, where for a while they view
The distant vale, whilst contemplation grew
Pregnant with wonder, whose next prosperous birth
Had been delight, had they not sent their mirth
In sad exchange, whilst tears did usher in
Silvandra's fate, who, weeping, did begin
With such a look as did command belief,
The late-past story of a present grief.
In yonder fields (with that directs her eye
To a black Fen, whose heavy earth did lie
Low in a dark and dirty vale) is placed
Amarus Castle, which though now defaced
More by the owners covetous neglect
Then times rough strokes, that strength which did protect
Once its inhabitants, being now but made
Use of when want does with weak prayers invade
The gates, being thought sufficient if they keep
The poor at bay, or whilst his stiff hindes sleep
Their laboring beasts secure. But I alas
Blush to discover that this Miser was
Father to my dead Vanlore, and to her
Whose living virtues kind heaven did confer
As blessings on my brother; but the sun
Never saw two sweeter streams of virtue run
From such a bitter fountain. This accursed
And wretched man, so hated, that he durst
Scarce look abroad, fearing oppression would
Be paid with vengeance, if he ever should
Fall into the hand's of those whose faces he
Grownd with extortion, till the injury
Fear clothed like justice, ventring once to view
A Manor whose intemperate Lord out-grew
In debts the compass of a Bond, besides
His common guard of Clowns, fellows whose hides
Served for defensive armor, he commands
His sons attendance, who since from his hands
Racked Tenants hoped for ease, he thought that they
Would for that hope with reverent duty pay.
But vain mistakes betray opinion to
A fatal precipice, which they might view
In The objects of each glance; one side affords
Large plains, whose flock's, the wealth of several lords
By him contracted, but the spoils appears
Of beggared Orphans, pickled in their tears;
Farms for whose loss poor widows wept, and fields
Which being confined to strict enclosure, yields
To his crammed chests the starving poor man's food,
For private ends robbing their public good,
With guilt enclosed those ways which now ha^^ brought
Him by some cottages who honors bought
Poor livelihoods at a laborious rate
From his racked lands, for which pursuing hate
Now follows him in curses; for in that
They yet take vengeance, till arriving at
The thicker peopled Villages, where more bold
By number made, the fire of hate takes hold
On clamarous women, whose vexed husbands thirst
In The fever of revenge, to these when first
They kindled had the flame, swiftly succeeds
More active men, such, as resolved their deeds
(Spite of restrictive law) should set them free
From the oppressor of their liberty.
His son (the noble Vanlore) to appease
The dangerous fury of this rash disease,
Spends all his stock of Rhetoric, but in
Fruitless attempts. His rustic guard had bin
At the first onset scattered, and were now
Posting for fafety, whilst his son, taught how
By frequent injuries to entertain
Angers unusual guests, shows it in vain,
Though brave attempts of valor, by whose high
Unhappy flame, whilst circling foes did die
Unworthy hecatombs for him, at length
Engaged him had beyond the power of strength,
Though backed by fortune to redeem; which when
Beheld by those whose characters of men
In rage was lost, they wildly persecute
Revenge, till life, natures hurmonious fruit,
Was blasted to untimely death. And here
Her fatal story in its full carier,
The memory of him, who di'd to be
The peoples curse, and crime of destiny
Grief did obstruct, whilst liquid passion feeds
Her crystal springs, which stopped, she thus proceeds,
His brave defender now retreating to
The rode of death, whilst he did vainly sue
For undeserved remorse, Amarus lies
Their furies object, in whose wild disguise
Whilst giddy clouds of dark amazement dwell,
Ore his dim eyes the exalted tumult fell
In a black storm of danger, in whose shade
They drag him thence, that fury being made
Wise by delays, might study torments great
As was their rage; but in their wild retreat
They thus are stopped: A wandering Knight that near
The place approached, directed by his ear
How to inform his eye, arrives to see
The wretched trophies of this victory,
A dying son, whose latest beams of light
Through deaths dim optics bids the world goodnight,
With looks that did so black a sorrow lim
He frowned on earth, though heaven did smile on him
Hurried from thence by unrelenting hate,
A living father of more woeful fate.
Pity (that brave allay of manly heat)
Persuades the noble stranger to entreat
A parle with rage, which being denied he then
Attempts to force; and since their ablest men
Were wounded in the former conflict, soon
Successful proves, like mists in the pride of noon
Being hudl'd into hurtless clouds they fly
Before his fury, till from reach o'th eye
Shrunk to the woods protection, where whilst each
With such a fear as sanguine guilt did teach
The worlds first murderer, seeks for safety, he
Retreating leaves the scattered herd to be
Their own afflictors, and hastes thence to find
Him to whom fortune proved so strangely kind
In his approach, as by his sword to be
When hope lost anchor, blessed with liberty.
Come to the place where old Amarus lay
With fear so startled, that he durst betray
Life through no motion, yet he is followed by
That train of Cowards, which though they did fly
The danger, when they saw their foes pursued
On the reward, (the victory) intrude,
Whose easy spoils (those invitations to
A Cowards daring) such a distance drew
Them from their homes, that they with labor were
Recalled from rifling enemies to bear
Their feeble Masters off, Amarus living
As weak with fear as Vanlore was with dying.
Before the black obstructions of the night
Did interpose, they were arrived in the sight
O'th Castles ruined walls, a place whose hew,
Uncouth and wild, banished delight into
Uncomly profit, and at distance gives
A sad assurance that its honor lives
By men so hated, and by heaven unblest,
As he enjoyed not what he there possessed.
Come to the front o'th house, whose dirt sorbid
A cleanly entrance, he sees pavements hid
With heaps of rubbish, times slow hand let fall
From the neglected ruins of the wall,
Green Arbors, pleasant Groves, all which were now
Swiftly dismantling to make way for the plow;
Only his Barns, preservers of that store
Detained with curses from the pining poor,
Their upper garments of warm thatch did wear
So thick to keep them dry, whilst thin and bare
Even his own lodging stood; the Hall first built
To have that wealth, which he in sparing spilt,
Spent there in hospitality, nere by
More heat warmed then a candle gave, did lie
Molded with lazy damps, the wall oregrown
With moss and weeds, unhaunted, and alone
The empty tables stood, for never Guess
Come there, except thin Bankrupts whom distress
Spurred on with sharp necessity to crave
Forbearing months, which he, when bribed forgave.
Hence (by a rude domestic led) he goes
To veiw the cellar, where like distant foes
Or buildings in a new Plantation stand
The distant Barrels, yet from all command
But his own keys exempted. To bestow
A welcome on him, which he never did show
To man before; led by a rusty slave,
Whose iron limbs rattling in leather gave
Alarums to the half-starv'd Rats; he here
Is by Amarus visited, whose fear
That place should too much suffer, soon from thence
Sounds a retreat to supper, where the expense
Became a Usurers purse: yet what was by
Sparing defective, neatness did supply:
A virtue where repining penury
Prepares, unusual; but he soon did see
Whence it proceeds, the sad sweet Ammida
Whom shame and grief attempted to withdraw
From public view, was by her fathers call
To crown that entertainment brought, whose all
Was else so bad, it the first visit might
Repented make, not to the next invite.
Here, with afflicted patience, he had spent
Some few, but tedious days, whose slow extent
Behind his wishes flagg'd, ere he had seen
Vanlore interred, whose obsequies had been
In secret huddl'd up, but then prepares
To take his leave, when adverse fate that shares
Double with man's intentions, in the tart
Of's full resolves opposing, claims her part
By harsh command, a dangerous Fever that
Threatened destruction ere arriving at
Its distant crisis, and on flaming wings
Posts through the blood, whose mass infected brings
Deaths banners near the Fort of life, which in
Acute distempers it attempts to win
From Natures guards, had not the hot assault
By youth sustained made deaths black army halt
Whilst marching to the grave, the swift disease
Like a proud foe repulst, forced to give ease
By slow retreats; yet of those cruel wars
Left long remaining bloodless characters.
But ere the weak Euriolus (for he
This hapless stranger was) again could be
By strength supported, base Amarus, who
Could think no more then priceless thanks was due
For all his dangerous pains, more beastly rude
Then untamed Indians, basely did exclude
That noble guest; which being with sorrow seen
By Ammida, whose prayers and tears had been
His helpless advocates, she gives in charge
To her Ismander, that till time enlarge
Her then restrained desires, he entertain
Her desolate and wandering friend: Nor vain
Were these commands, his entertainment being
Such as observant Love thought best agreeing
To her desires. But here not long he stayed
Ere Fortune, prompted by his wit, obeyed
That artfull Mistress, and reward obtains
By fine imposture for firm virtues pains.
The gout (that common curse of slothful wealth)
With frequent pain had long impaired the health
Of old Amarus, who, though else to all
Griping as that, for ease was liberal.
From practiced physic, to the patients curse,
Poor prattling women, or impostors worse
Sly Mountebanks, whose empty impudence
Do frequent murders under healths pretense,
He all had tried, yet found he must endure
What though some eased, none perfectly could cure.
Often had his judgment, purse, and patience bin
Abused by cheats, yet still defective in
The choice of men: which error known unto
My brother and Euriolus, they drew
Their platform thus: Euriolus clad in
An antic dress, which showed as he had bin
Physician to the great Mogol, first by
Ismander praised at distance, does apply
Himself unto Amarus, where t'^inhance
The price of's art, he first applauds the chance
That had from distant Regions thither brought
Him to eclipse their glory, who had sought
For It in his cure before, then seconds that
With larger promises; which tickled at
Amarus vies with his, threatening to break
His iron chests, and make those idols speak
His gratitude, though locked with conscience they
To his own clamorous wants had silent lay.
Some common medicines, which the people prize
'Cause from their knowledge veiled in slight disguise,
Applied to's pain, and those assisted by
Opinion, whose best antidotes supply
The weak defects of art, he soon attains
So much of health, that now his greatest pains
Had been the engaged reward, had he not bin
By future hopes kept from ungrateful sin
So far, that in performing action he
Exceeds his passions prodigality,
Large promises, with such performance, that
Whilst his deluders smile, and wonder at,
Thus speaks its dark orginal; To show
Euriolus how fortune did out-grow
Desert in his estate, he was one day
From the Castle walls taking a pleased survay,
Of spacious fields, whose soils made fertile by
Luxurious art, in rich variety
Still youthful nature clothed, which whilst he views
An old suspicion thus his tongue renews.
How blessed, my worthy friend, how blessed had I
Been in my youths laborious industry
TO have seen a son possessed of this! but now
A daughters match, a stranger must endow
With what I Have toiled to get, and what is more
My torment, one that being betrothed before
My sons decease, wants an estate to make
Her marriage blessed; but knew I how to shake
This Swagg'rer off, there lives not far from hence
One that to match her to were worth the expense
Of my estate, his name is Dargonel,
A wary Lad, who though his land do swell
Each day with new additions, yet still lives
Sparing and close, takes heed to whom he gives
Or whom he lends, except on mortgage, by
Whose strength it may securely multiply.
This worthy Gentleman, with wise foresight
Beholding what an object of delight
Our linked estates would be, has since I lost
My heir, been in's intention only crossed
By this Ismander, whom, though I confess
A braver man, yet since a fortune less,
Never must have my consent; only since by
Her contract I have lost the liberty
Of second choice, unless I vainly draw
My self in danger o'th ore-busie Law,
I want some sound advice that might inform
Me how to rid him, yet not stand a storm
Broke from his rage, although my daughter love
Him more then health, I shall command above
Her feeble passions, if you dare impart
So much of aid from your almighty art
As to remove this remora; and here
He stopped, yet lets a silent guilt appear
In looks that showed what else the theme affords
He Would have conceived, as being too foul for words.
Which seen by him whose active wit gr^w strong
In friendships cause, as loath to torture long
His expectations, thus their stream he stays
With what at once both comforts and betrays.
Raise up your spirits, my blessed Patron, to
Sublime content, Heaven sent me to renew
Your souls harmonious peace; that dreadful toy
Of conscience wisely waved, you may enjoy
Uninterrupted hopes: yet since we must
Be still most wary where we are most unjust,
Lets not be rash; swift things are often unsure,
Whilst moles through death's dark angles creep secure.
Then since it is full of danger to remove
Betrothed Ismander, whilst his public love
By your consent raised to assurance, may
A granted interest claim; first let us stay
His fury, and the peoples censures by
A nuptial knot, whose links we will unty
Ere the first night confirms the hallowed band,
By ways so secret, that death's skillful hand
Shall work unknown to fate, and render you
To the deluded worlds more public view
A real mourner, whilst your curtain'd thought
Triumphs to be from strict engagements brought.
Besides the vailing of our dark design
Like virtue thus, this plot will sink a Mine
Whose wealthy womb in ample jointure will
Bring much of dead Ismanders state to fill
The vast desire of wealth. This being done,
I with prevailing philters will outrun
Sorrows black Bark, which whilst it lies at drift,
I Will so renew her mirth, no sigh shall lift
Its heavy sails, which in a calm neglect
Shall lie forgot; whilst what is not now respect
To Dargonel, shall soon grow up to be
Like Natures undiscovered sympathy,
A love so swift, so secret, all shall pause
At its effects, whilst they admire the cause.
This by Amarus, with belief* which grew
Into applause, heard ou^, he does renew
With large additions what he had promised in
His first attempts: Then hasting to begin
The tragic scene which must in triumph be
Ushered to light, his known deformity
Of wretched baseness for a while he lays
Aside, and by a liberal mirth betrays
Approaching joy, which since incited by
His wishes, soon lifts Hymen's torches high
As their exalted hopes. The happy Pair
Dear to indulgent heaven, with Omens fair
As were their youthful Paranimphs, had bin
In The hallowed Temple taught without a sin
To taste the fruits of Paradise; and now
The time when tedious custom did allow
A wished retirement, come, preparing are
To beautify their beds, whence that bright star
Whose evenings blush did please the gazers eyes,
Eclipsed in sorrow is ordained to rise.
But such whose superficial vail oppressed
Only her friends, whose knowledge were not blessed
With the design which to our proscript Lovers
Euriolus with timely zeal discovers.
The morning opens, and the wakened Bride
By light and friends surprised, attempts to hide
Her bashful beauty, till their hands withdrew
The curtains, which betrayed unto their view
Ismander cold and stiff: which horrid sight
Met where they looked for objects of delight,
At first a silent sad amazement spread
Through all the room, till Fears pale army fled
In sad assurance, Sorrows next hot charge
Began in shrieks, whose terror did enlarge
Infectious grief, till like an ugly cloud
That cramps the beauties of the day, grown proud
In her black empire, Hymen's tapors she
Changes to funeral brands, and from that tree
That shadows graves, pulls branches, which being wet
In tears, are where Loves mirtles flourisht set.
Their nuptial himns thus turned to dirges, all
In sad exchange let cloudy sable fall
Ore pleasures purple-robes, whilst from that bed
Whence Love oppressed, seemed to their sorrow fled
To death for refuge, sadly they attend
To the last of homes, his tomb, their sleeping friend,
Who there with all the hallowed rights that do
Betray surviving friendship, left unto
Darkness and dust, they thence with sober pace
Return, whilst shrouded near that dismal place
Euriolus conceals himself, that so
When sleep, whose soft excess is natures fo,
Has spent her stupefactive opiates, he
Might ready to his friends assistance be.
And now that minute come, which to comply
With Arts sure rules, gives Nature leave t'unty
Sleeps powerful ligatures, his Pulses beat
The Floods revelly, from whose dark retreat
The spirits thronging in their active flight,
His friend h'encounters with the early light;
By whose assistance whilst the quiet earth
Yet slept in nights black arms, before the birth
Of The morn, whose busy childhood might betray
Their close design, Ismander takes his way
Toward a distant friends, whose house he knew
To be as secret as his love was true.
There whilst concealed even from suspicion, he
In safety rests, Euriolus, to free
Her fears fair Captive, Ammida, hastes back
To old Amarus, who too rash to slack
Sorrows black cordage by degrees that might
Weaken mistrust, lets mirth taken open flight
Into suspected action, whilst he gives
To Dargonel, who now his Darling lives,
So free a welcome, that he in it might read
If love could not for swift succession plead,
Power should command; yet waves the exercise
Of either, till his Empericks skill he tries:
Who now returned, ere Dargonel that lay
Slow to attempt, since certain to betray,
Had more then faced at distance, he pretends
To close attempts of art, whose wished for ends
Ere their expecting faith had time to fear,
In acts which raised their wonder did appear.
Love, which by judgment ruled, had made desert
In her first choice the Climax to her heart,
By which it slowly moved, now; as if swaid
^y heedless passion, seems to have betrayed
At one rash glance her heart, which now begins
To break through Passions bashful cherubins,
Spreading without a modest blush the light
Of morning-beauty ore that hideous night
Of all those dull deformities that dwell
Like earths black damps ore cloudy Dargonel,
Who being become an Antique in the Mask
Of playful Love, grows proud, and scorns to ask
Advice from sober thought, but lets conceit
Persuade him how his worth had spread that bait
Which sly Amarus who presumed to know
From whence that torrent of her Love did flow,
With a just doubt suspecting, strives to make
His thoughts secure, ere Reason did oretake
Passions enforced carier; Nor did his plot
Want an indulgent hope, like dreams, forgot
In the delights of day, his daughter shook
Off Griefs black dress, and in a cheerful look
Promised approaching love, no more disguised
Then served to show strict virtue how she pris'd
Her only in applause, whose harmony
Still to preserve, she is resolved to be,
If secret silence might with action dwell,
Swift as his wish espoused to Dargonel.
More joy'd then fettered Captives in the year
Of Jubilee, Amarus did appear
Proud with delight, in whose warm shine when is haste
Had with officious diligence embraced
Euriolus, he waving all delays,
To Dargonel the welcome news conveys;
Who soon prepared for what so long had bin
His hopes delight, to meet those joys within
The sacred temple hastes: The place they chose
For Hymen's Court, lest treacherous eyes disclose
The Brides just blushes, was a Chapel where
Devotion, when but a domestic care,
Was by his household practiced; for the time
'Twas ere the morn blushed to detect a crime.
All thus prepared, the Priest conducting, they
With sober pace, which gently might convey
Diseased Amarus in his chair, they to
The Chapel haste, which now come near, as through
The ancient room they pass, a sad deep groan
Assaults their ears, which whilst with wonder grown
Into disease they entertain, appears
A sad confirmer of their doubtful fears;
Ismander whom but late before they had
Followed to the grave, his lively beauty clad
In The upper garments of pale death: which sight
The train avoiding by their speedy flight
Except the willing Bride, behind leave none
But lame Amarus, who, his chair orethrown
By his affrighted bearers, there must lie
Exposed to fear, which when attempts to fly,
Through often struggling proved his labor vain,
He grovelling lies unseen to entertain.
Thus far successful blessed Ismander thence
Conveys his lovely Bride, whilst the expense
Of time being all laid out on fear, by none
He was observed; Amarus long alone
Lying tormented with his passions, ere
His frighted servants durst return to bear
Their fainting Master of; but being at length,
When greater numbers had confirmed the strength
Of fortitude, grown bold, entering again
The room, which yet fear told them did retain
The scent of brimstone, there they only found
Their trembling master, tumbling on the ground.
Horror, augmented by internal guilt
Had in his conscience trepidations spilt:
Both prayers and tears, which since heavens law they crossed
For humane passions in despair were lost;
Obscured in whose black mists, not daring to
Unclose his eyes, fearing again the view
Of that affrighting aparition, he
Is hurried from that dreadful place, to be
Their mirth, whom he (for fiends mistaking) cries
For mercy to, scarce trusting of his eyes,
When they unfolded had, discovered none
But such whom long he would for domestics known.
Yet to torment him more, before these fears
Wholly forsake him, in his room appears
Some officers, whose power made dreadful by
The dictates of supreme authority
As guilty of Ismander's death, arrest
Him for his murderer, by which change oppressed
More then before with fear, he, who now thought
On naught but death, to a tribunal brought,
Ere asked confesses that foul crime, for which
He this just doom receives; since to enrich
What had before wealths surfeit took, this sin
Was chiefly acted, his estate, fallen in
To the hands of justice, by the judge should be
From hence disposed of, then from death to free
His life, already forfeited, except
Murdered Ismander, whom he thought had slept
In's winding sheet, his hopeless Advocate
Should there appear, in which unhappy state
The wretch, now ready to depart, beholds
This glorious change; Ismander first unfolds
Himself, and her, who bound by natures laws,
Implores his pardon ere they plead his cause,
Which done, the Judge, that his lost wealth might be
No cause of grief, unmasking, lets him see
Euriolus, by whom, from the worst of sin
To liberal virtue he would deluded bin.
The End of the Third Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fourth Book. CANTO IV.
The Argument.
I.
Whilst we a while the pensive Lady ^eave
Here a close Mourner for her rigid fate,
Let Us from the dark records of time receive
The manner how Argalia waved the hate
II.
Of his malignant stars, which when they seem
To threaten most, through that dark cloud did lead
Him to a knowledge of such dear esteem,
He his high birth did there distinctly read.
FReed from the noise of the busy world, within
A deep dark vale, whose silent shade had bin
Religions vail, when blasted by the beams
Of Persecution, far from the extremes
Of solitude, or sweary labor, were
Some few blessed men whose choice made Heaven their care
Sequestered from the throngs of men to find
Those better joys, calms of a peaceful mind.
Yet though on this pacifick sea, their main
Design was Heaven, that voyage did not restrain
Knowledge of humane arts, which as they past
They safely viewed, though there no anchor cast;
Their better tempered judgments counting that
But hoodwinked zeal, which blindly catches at
The great Creators sacred will, without
Knowing those works that will was spent about,
Which being the climax to true judgment, we
Behold stooped down to visibilitie
In lowliest creatures, natures stock being naught
But God in's image to our senses brought.
In the fair evening of that fatal day,
By whose meridian light Love did betray
Engaged Argalia near to death, was one
Of these (heavens happy Pensioners) alone
Walking amongst the gloomy Groves to view
What sovereign virtues there in secret grew
Confined to humble plants; whose signatures
Whilst by observing, he his art secures
From vain experiments, Argalia's Page
Crossing a neighboring path, did disingage
His serious eye from natures busy task,
To see the wandering Boy, who was to ask
The way; for more his youths unprompted fear
Expects not there, to the blessed man drawn near.
But when, with such a weeping innocence
As Saints confess those sins which the expense
Of tears exacted, he had sadly told
What harsh fate in restrictive wounds laid hold
Of's worthy Master, pity prompted by
Religious love, helps the poor Boy to dry
His tears with hopes of comfort, whilst he goes
To see what sad Catastrophe did close
Those bloody scenes which the unequal fight
Foretold, before fear prompted him to flight.
No^ far they would past ere they the place had found
Where grovelling in a stream of blood, the ground
His purple-bed, the wearied Prince they see
Struggling with death, from whose dark monarchy
Pale troops assail his cheeks, whilst his dim eyes
Like a spent lamp which ere its weak flame dies,
In giddy blazes glares, as if his soul
Were at those casements flying out, did roll
Swifter then thought their bloodshot orbs; his hands
Did with deaths agues tremble; cold dew stands
Upon his clammy lips; the springs of blood
(Having breathed forth the spirits) clotted stood
On that majestic brow, whose dreadful frown
Had to deaths scepter laid its terror down.
The holy man upon the brink of the grave
Finding such forms of worth, attempts to save
His life from dropping in, by all his best
Reserves of art, selecting from the rest
Of his choice store, an herb whose sovereign power
No flux of blood, though falling in a shower
Of death could force, which gently bruised, and to
His wound applied, taught nature to renew
Her late neglected functions, and through short
Recruits of breath made able to support
His blood-enfeebled body, till they reach
The Monastry, where nobler art did teach
Their simple medicines to submit to those
Which skill from their mixed virtues did compose.
Life (which the unexpected gift of fate
Rather then art appeared) in this debate
Of death prevailing, in short time had gained
So much of strength, that weakness now remained
The only slothful R^mora that in
His bed detained him; where being often seen
By those whom art alike had qualified
For his relief, as one of them applied
His morning-medicines to a spacious wound
Fixed on his breast, he that rare jewel found
Which in his undiscerning infancy
There hung by's father, fortune had kept free
From all her various accidents, to show
How much his birth did to her favor owe.
Shook with such silent joy as he had been
In calm devotion by an Angel seen,
The good old man, his wonder rarifi'd
Into amazement stands, he had descri'd,
What, if no force had robbed him of it since
'Twas first bestowed, none but his true born Prince
Could wear, since art (wise Natures fruitful ape)
Never but in that had birth which bore that shape
Assured by which with unstirr'd confidence
He asks Argalia where he knew from whence
When nature first did so much wealth impart
To earth, that jewel took those forms of art:
But being answered, that his infancy
When first it was conferred on him, might be
The excuse of's ignorance; that voice alone
Confirms his aged friend, who having known
As much of fortune as in fates dark shade
His understanding legible had made
From weak Argalia, to require him leads
Knowledge where he his life's first copy reads
Dressed in this language. --
-- 'Twas, unhappy Prince!
(For such this story must salute you, since
Told to confirm't a truth) my destiny
When youth and strength rendered me fit to be
My dearest Countries servant, placed within
Mantinea's glorious Court, where, having been
Made capable by sacred Orders, I
Attained the height of Priestly dignity,
Being unto him whose awful power did sway
That crown, in dear esteem; but Honors day
Which gilded then the Courtly sphere, sunk down,
I lost my Mitre in the fall of the Crown.
Sad is the doleful tale; yet since that in
Its progress you may find where did begin
Your life's first stage, thus take it. When the Court
Stifled with throngs of men, whose thick resort
Plenty and peace called thither, being grown
Sickly with ease, viewed as a thing unknown,
Dangers stern brow, which even in smiling fates
Proves a Quotidian unto wiser States;
Whilst pride grew big, and envy bigger, we
Sleeping in the bed of soft security,
Were with alarums wakened; Faction had,
To show neglects deformities, unclad
That gaudy monster, whose first dress had bin
The night-peec'd works of their unriper sin,
And those that in contracted fortunes dwelt,
Calmly in favors shadow, having felt
The glorious burden of their honor grown
Too large for all that fortune called their own,
Like fishes which the lesser fry devour,
Pride having joined oppression to their power,
Preyed on the subject, till their load outgrew
Their loyalty, and forced even those that knew
Once only to obey, in sullen rage
To mutter threats, whose horror did presage
That blood must in domestic jars be spilt,
To cure their envy, and the peoples guilt.
These seeds of discord which began to rise
To active growth, by the honorable Spies
Of other Princes seen, had soon betrayed
Our States obscure disease, and called to aid
Ambitious subjects, foreign powers, whose strength,
First but as physic used, was grown at length
Our worst disease, which whilst we hoped for cure,
Turned our slow Hectique to a Calenture.
A Syracusian army, that had bin
Against our strength often victorious in
A haughty Rebels quarrel, being by
Success taught how to ravish victory
Without his aid, which only useful proved
When treason first for novelty was loved:
Seizing on all that in's pretended cause
Had stooped to conquest, what the infeebled laws
In vain attempted, soon perform, and give
The traitor death, from what made treason live.
This done, whilst their victorious ensigns were
Fanned by fames breath, they their bold standards bear
Near to our last of hopes, an army which
Like often tried Oar, disasters made more rich
In loyal valor then vast numbers, and
By shaking fixed those roots on which did stand
Their well-elected principles, which here
(Oppressed with number) only did appear
In bravely dying, when their righteous cause
Condemned by fates inevitable laws,
Let its religion, virtue, valor, all
That heaven calls just, beneath rebellion fall.
Near to the end of this black day, when none
Was left that durst protect his injured throne,
When loyal valor having lost the day
Bleeding within the bed of honor lay:
Thy wounded father, when his acts had shown
As high a spirit as did ever groan
Beneath misfortune, is enforced to leave
The fields wild fury, and some rest receive
In faithful Enna, where his springs of blood
Were hardly stopped, before a harsher slood
Assails his eyes: Thy royal mother, then
More blooming then earths ful-blown beauties when
VVarm'd in the Ides of May, her fruitful womb
Pregnant with thee, to an untimely tomb,
Her fainting spirits in that horrid fright
Losing the paths of life, from time, from light,
And grief steals down; yet ere she had discharged
Her debts to death, protecting heaven enlarged
Thy narrow lodging, and that life which she
Lost in thy fatal birth, bestowed on thee;
On thee, in whom those joys thy father prized
More then loved empire, are epitomized.
And now as if the arms of adverse fate
Had all conspired our ills to aggravate
Above the strength of patience, we are by
Victorious foes, before our fear could fly
To a remoter refuge, closed within
Unhappy Enna, which before they win
(Though stormed with fierce assaults) the restless sun
His annual progress through-the heavens had run;
But then, tired with disasters which attend
A slow-paced siege, unable to defend
Their numbers from resistless famine, they
With an unwilling loyalty obey
The next harsh summons, and so prostrate lie
To the rage, or mercy of their enemy.
But ere the Cities fortune was unto
This last black stage arrived, safely withdrew
To the Castles strength thy father was, where he
(Though far from safety) finds the time to be
Informed by sober council how to steer
Through this black storm, love, loyalty, and fear
Had often varied judgments, but at last
Into this form their full resolves were cast.
To cool hot action, and to bathe in rest
More peaceful places, darkness dispossessed
The days soveraignity, to usher whom
Into her sable throne, a clouds full womb
Congealed by frigid air, as if that then
The elements had warred as well as men,
In a white vail came hovering down to hide
The Coral pavements, but forbid by the pride
Oth' Conquerors triumphs, and expelled from thence
As that which too much emblem'd innocence,
Since that the City no safe harbor yields,
It takes its lodging in the neighboring fields,
Which mantled in those spotless robes invite
The Prince through them to take his secret flight.
In sad distress leaving his Nobles to
Swallow such harsh conditions as the view
Of danger candi'd ore, from treacherous eyes
Obscured in a Plebeians poor disguise
His glorious train shrunk to desertless I,
The sad companion of his misery;
He now departing, thee his infant son
Heir to his crown and cares, ordained to run
This dangerous hazard of thy life before
Time taught thee how thy fortune to deplore.
When ventring on this precipice of fate,
We slowly sallied forth, 'twas cold and late,
The drowsy guard asleep, the Centries hid
Close in their huds did shivering stand, and chid
The whistling winds with chatring teeth, when now
A leave as solemn as haste would allow,
Of all our friends, our mourning friends, being took,
We like the earth veiled all in white forsook
Our salliport, whilst slowly marching ore
The new fallen snow, thee in his arms he bore.
Whilst this imposture made the scared guards when
They saw us move, then make a stand again,
Either to think that dallying winds had played
With flakes of snow, or that their sight betrayed
Their fancy into errors, we were past
The reach of danger, and in triumph cast
Off with our fears, what had us safety lent
When strength refused to save the innocent.
The eager lover hugs himself not in
Such roseal beds of joy, when what has bin
His sickly wishes is possessed, as we
Through watchful foes arrived to liberty
Embrace the welcome blessing; first we stear
Our course toward Siracuse, whose confines near
The mountain stood, upon whose cloudy brow
Poor Enna did beneath her ruins bow.
The Stars clothed in the pride of light, had sent
Their sharp beams from the spangled firmament,
To silver ore the Earth, which being embost
With hills, seemed now enameled ore with frost,
The keen winds whistle in the justling trees,
And clothed their naked limbs in hoary frees.
When having paced some miles of crusted earth,
Whose labor warmed our blood, before the birth
OF the sluggish morning from his bed had drawn
The early Villager, the sober dawn
Lending our eyes the slow salutes of light,
We are encountered with the welcome sight
Of some poor scattered Cottages that stood
In the dark shadow of a spacious wood
That fringed an humble valley, toward those,
Whilst the still morn knew naught to discompose
Her sleepy infancy, we went, and now
Being come so near we might discover how
The unstir'd smoke streamed from the Cottage tops,
A glim'ring light from a low window stops
Our further course, we are come to a low shed,
Whose happy honor (never disquieted
With those domestic troubles that attend
On larger roofs) here in content did spend
Fortunes scant gifts, at his unhaunted gate
Hearing us knock, he stands not to debate
With wealthy misers slow suspicion, but
Swift, as if 'twere a sin to keep it shut,
Removes that slender Guard; but when he there
Unusual Strangers saw, with such a care
As only spoke a conscious shame to be
Surprised, whilst unprovided poverty
Straightened desire, he starts, yet entertains
Us so, that showed by an industrious pains
He strove to welcome more. Here being by
Their goodness, and our own necessity
Tempted a while to rest, we safely lay
Far from persuing ills, yet since the way
To danger by suspicion lies, we still,
Fear being betrayed by those that meant no ill,
Since often their busy whispers, though they spring
From love, and wonder, slow discoveries bring.
Being now removing, since thy tender age
Threatened to make the grave its second stage
If thence conveyed by us whose fondest love
Could to thy wants but fruitless pity prove
TO enlarge thy commons, though increase our fears
To those indulgent rurals, who for tears
Had springs of milk to feed thee, thou remain'st
An infant tenant, for thy own name against
What since thou have bin known by, which when we
Contracted had to the stenographie,
Some gold, the last of all our wealth we leave
To make their burden light, which they receive
With thankful joy, amazed to see those bright
Angels display their strange unwonted light
In poverties cold region, where they had
Been pined for want, if not by labor clad.
When age should make thee capable to tell
Thy wonder how thy infancy had fell
From honors pyramids, a jewel which
Did once the splendour of his Crown enrich
About thy neck he hangs, then breathing on
Thy tender lips a parting kiss, we are gone,
Gone from our last delight to find some place
Dark as our clouded stars, there to embrace
Unenvi'd poverty, in the cold bed
Of sad despair, till on his reverend head,
Once center to a crown, grief makes him wear
A silver frost by frequent storms of care
Forced on that royal mount, whose verdute fades
Ere time, by youths antagonist invades.
Not far, through dark and unknown paths we had
Wandered within those forests, which unclad
By big winds of their summers beauteous dress
Naked, and trembling stood, ere fair success
Smiling upon our miseries did bring
Us to a crystal stream, from whose cold spring,
With busy and laborious care, we saw
A feeble Hermit stooping down to draw
An earthen pot, whose empty wants supplied
With liquid treasure, soon had satisfied
His thirsty hopes; who now returning by
A narrow path, which did directing I Will
Through the unfrequented desert, with the haste
Of doubtful Travelers, in lands laid waste
By conquering foes, we follow till drawn near
To him whom innocence secured from fear,
Disburth'ning of his staff, he sits to rest
What was with age and labor both oppressed.
Our first salutes, when we for blessings had
Exchanged with him, being sat, we there unclad
All our deformed misfortunes, and unless
A kingdoms loss disvellop'd our distress.
Which heard with pity, that he safely might
Be the directing Pharos by whose light
We might be safely guided from the rocks
Of the tempestuous world, his tongue unlocks
A cabinet of holy counsel, which
More then our vanished honor did enrich
Our souls (for whose eternal good was meant
This cordial) with the worlds best wealth, Content,
Content, which flies the busy throne, to dwell
With hungry Hermites in the noiseless cell.
More safe then age from the hot sins of youth,
Peaceful as faith, free as untroubled truth,
Being by him directed hither, we
Long lived within this narrow Monast'rie,
Whose orders being too strict for those that never
Had lost delight in the prosecuting care
Of unsuccessful action, suited best
With us, whose griefs compared taught the distressed
To slight their own, as guests that did intrude
On reason, in the want of fortitude,
That brave supporter, which such comfort brings,
That none can know but persecuted Kings.
The purple-robe, his births unquestioned right,
For the course habit of a Carmelite
Being now exchanged, and we retired from both
Our fears and hopes, like private Lovers loath
When solve from the observant Spy, to be
Disturbed by friends, for want, or greatness, free
Secure and calm, we spent those happy days
In naught ambitious, but of what might raise
Our thoughts toward heaven, with whom each hour acquaints
In prayr more frequent then afflicted saints
Our happy souls, which here so long had bin
Refining, till that grand reward of sin,
Death, did by age (his common harbinger)
Proclaim's approach, and warned us to defer
For the earths trivial business) naught that might
Concern eternity, lest life and light
Forsaking our dark mansions leave us to
Darkness and death, unfurnisht of a clew
Which might conduct (when time shall cease to be)
Through the meanders of eternity.
Thy pious father, ere the thefts of age
Decaying strength, should his stiff limbs engage
In an uneasy rest, to level all
Accounts with heaven, does to remembrance call
A vow, which though in hot affliction made
Whilst passions-short ephemera's did invade
His troubled soul, does now, when the disease
Time had expunged, from solitary ease
Call him again to an unwilling view
Oth' active world, in a long journey to
Forlorn Enna, unto whose Temple he
Had vowed, if fortune lent him liberty,
Till tired with the extremes of weary age,
The cheap devotion of a pilgrimage.

The Argument.
I.
To the grave Author of this happy news
The pleased Argalia with delight did hear,
Till (whilst the fatal story he persues)
He brings his great soul near the gates of fear,
II.
By letting him in full discovery know
The dreadful danger that did then attend
His royal Sire, who to his sword must ow
For safety, ere his sad afflictions end.
FOrsaking now our solitary friends,
Whose prayrs upon each slow-paced step attends
From danger by a dress so course exempt
As wore religion to avoid contempt,
Through toils of many a tedious day, at last
We Enna reach, where when his vows had past
The danger of a forfeiture, and we
(That debt discharged to heaven) had liberty
To look abroad, with sorrow-laden eyes
We view those ruins in whose ashes lies
Sad objects of our former loss, not then
Raked up so deep, but old observant men
When youths were in procession led, could tell
Where towrs once stood, and in what fights they fell;
Which to confirm, some in an aged pride
Show wounds, which then though they did wisely hide
As signatures of loyal valor, they
Now unsuspected with delight display.
Hence when commanded by the wane of light
We sought protection from approaching night
In an adjacent Monastry, where we
(The wandering objects of their charity)
Although by all welcomed with friendly zeal,
Found only one whose outside did reveal
So much of an internal worth that might
To active talk our clouded souls invight
From griefs obscure retreats; his grave aspect
(Though reverend age dwelt with unprun'd neglect)
Seemed dressed with such a sacred solitude,
As ruined Temples in their dust include.
My royal Master, as some power divine,
Had by instinct taught great souls how to twine
Though amongst the weeds of poverty, with this
Blessed man consorting, whilst their apt souls miss
In all their long discourse no tittle set
For man's direction in heavens alphabet;
Whilst controverted points, those rocks on which
Weak faiths are shipwrackt, did jems enrich
Their art-assisted zeal, a sudden noise
Clamorous and loud, in the soft womb destroys
That sacred infant; the concordant bells
Proclaim a joy, which larger triumph tells
To be of such a public birth, that they
(In quiet cells) for what they late did pray
In tears (the souls oreflowing language) now
(Being by examples common rule taught how
They vary passions) and in manly praise
Their silent prayers to Halleluiahs raise.
By swift report informed that this days mirth
From the proclaiming of their Prince took birth
These private mourners for the public faults
Of busy nations, by the hot assaults
Of triumph startled from their gravitie,
Prepare for joy; all but grave Sophron, he
Then with the pilgrim Prince, who both were sat
Like sad Physicians when the doubtful state
Oth' Patients theatens death, the serious eye
Of Sophron as a threatening prodigy
Viewing that flattering smile of fate, which they
Of shallower souls praised as approaching day.
When both (their souls from active words retired)
A while had silent sat, the Prince desired
To know the cause why in that triumh he
Of all that Covent found the time to be
With thoughtful cares alone, whom Sophron gave
This satisfaction: Worthy Sir, I have
In the few hours of our acquaintance found
In you such worth, 'twould question for unsound
My judgment, if unwilling to impart
A secret, though the darling of my heart.
Know then, this hapless Province, which of late
Faction has harrast, a wise Prince whom fate
Deprived us of, once ruled; but so long since,
That age has learned from time how to convince
The hot enormities of youth, since we
With such a Ruler lost our liberty.
For though at first, as he alone had bin
Our evil Geni^^, whose abode brought in
All those attendant plagues, our fortune seemed
To calm her brow, and captive hope redeemed
In the destruction of our foes, which by
A hot infection were enforced to fly
From conquest near obtained: yet we, to show
That only 'twas our vices did orethrow
The merits of his weaker virtues, when
Successful battails had reduced again
Our panting Land from all external ill,
Domestic quarrels threatened then to kill
What foreign powers assailed in vain, and made
Danger surprise, which trembled to invade.
For many years tossed by the uncertain wind
Of wild ambition, we had sailed to find
Out the Lucadian rocks of Peace; but in
A vain pursuit; for we so long had bin
A headless multitude, the factious Peers
Oppressing th'injur'd Commons, till our fears
Became our fate, few having so much left
Unsequestred, as might incite to theft
Even those whom want makes desperate, all being spent
On those that turn to the worst of punishment
What wore protections name, Vilains that we
Enforced maintained to christen Tyranny
In The injured name of Justice, such as kept
Litigious Councels, for whose Votes we wept,
From punishment so long, till grown above
The blinded peoples envy, or their love.
But lately these prodigious fires that led
Us through the night of Anarchy, being fled
At the approach of one, who since has stood
Fixed like a Star of the first magnitude,
Diffusive power, which then was only shown
In Factions dress, being now Rebellion grown,
By the uniting of those attoms in
One haughty Peer, ambitious Zarrobrin,
Whose pride (that spur of valor) when 't had set
Him in the front of Honers alphabet,
The sole Commander of those forces whence
Our peace distilled, and in as large a sense
As Subjects durst (whilst loyal) hope to have,
Adorn their tombs, the highest titles gave
Of a depending honor, to repay
Their easy faiths that levelled had the way
Unto his greatness, that Command he made
The steps by which he strugl'd to invade
A Throne, and in their heedless Votes include
Unnoted figures of their servitude.
When with attempts frequent as fruitless, I
With others, whose firm love to loyalty
Time had not yet expunged, had often in vain
Opposed our power, which found too weak to gain
Our Countries freedom, we, as useless, did
Retire to mourn for what the fates forbid
To have redrest: since when, his pride being grown
The peoples burden whilst he urged his own
Ambitious ends, he has, to fix their love
On principles whose structure should not move,
Unless it their allegiance shook, brought forth
Their Prince, whose fathers unforgotten worth
Did soon command their full consent, and he
For treason feared, made loved for loyalty.
But since that amongst observant judgments this
So sudden change might stand in doubt to miss
A fair construction, to confirm't he brings
An old Confessor of their absent Kings,
The reverend Halophantes, one whose youth
Made humane arts submit to sacred truth
So much, that now arrived to graver age
He (like authentic Authors) did engage
The people^ easy faith into a glad
Belief, that when his youths afflictions had
Unthron'd their Prince, he in that fatal night,
Wisely contracting his imagined flight
(As rodes unto destruction) leaving all
Frequented paths, did in nights silence call
At's unfrequented Cell, where entertained
With all the zeal that subjects which have gained
From gracious Sovereigns, study to express
A virtue in, which thrives by the distress
Of an afflicted patron's, he betrays
Enquiring Scouts, till some expunging days
Make them forsake their inquisition in
Despair to find: which vacancy did win
Time to bestow his infant burden where
Some secret friends did with indulgent care
Raise him from undiscerning childhood to
Be such as now exposed unto their view.
Thy father, who with doubtful thoughts had heard
This story, till confirmed in what he feared,
Starts into so much passion as betrays
Him through the thick mask of those tedious days.
Time had in thirty annual journeys stepped
To Sophron, who, when he a while had wept,
A short encomion to good fortune, in
Such prostrate lowliness as seemed for sin
To censure guiltless ignorance, he meets
His Princes full discovery, whom he greets
With all the zeal, such whose uncourtly arts
Make tongues the true interpreters of hearts,
Do those wise Princes whom they know to start
At aguish flattery, as if indesert
Ushered it in: -- Those that know how to rate
Their worth, prize it by virtue, not by fate.
With Arguments which to assist he made
Reasons firm power, Passions light scours invade,
He had so often the unwilling Prince assailed,
That importunity at length prevailed
On his resolves, from peaceful poverty
His ages refuge hurrying him to be
Once more an Agent unto fortune in
Uncertain toils, whose trouble to begin,
Leaving his Prince to so much rest as those
Whose serious souls are busied to compose
Unravelled thoughts into a method; now
Sophron forsakes him to discover how
His fellow Peers of that lost party stand
Disposed for action, if a Kings command
Should give it life; all which h^ finds to be
So full of yet untainted loyalty,
That in a swift convention they prepare
By joining judgments to divide their care.
From distant places, with such secret haste,
As did declare a flaming zeal, though placed
In cautions shadow, owe considerate Peers,
Such whose light youth the experienced weight of years
Had long since ballast with discretion, met
To see their Prince, and to discharge the debt
Of full obedience, each had with him brought
His states surviving hope, snatched from the soft
Hands of lamenting mothers, that to those,
If fit for arms, they safely might dispose
The excution of those Councils which
Their sober age with judgment did enrich.
In Sophron's Palace, which being far removed
From the streets talking throngs, was most aprov'd
For needful privacy; these loyal Lords
Whose faithful hearts the infallible records
The heedless vulgar (whose neglective sin
Had lost the copies of allegiance in
This inter regnum) trust to, being met
To shun delays, (man's late repented debt)
The Prince with speed appears, whom no disguise
Of youths betrayer, Time, could from their eyes
Long undiscovered keep, through the rough vail
Of Age, or what more powerful did prevail
On Beauties ruins, they did soon descry
The unquench'd embers of a Majesty
Too bright for time to hide, with curtains less
Dark then that mansion of forgetfulness,
The Grave, which man's first folly taught to be
The obscure passage to eternity.
That their example might be precept to
Unknowing youth, with all the reverence due
To awefull Princes on their thrones, the old
Experienced Courtiers kneel; by which grown bold
In their belief, those of unriper age
Upon their judgments did their faith engage
So far, that they in solemn vows unite
Their yet concordant thoughts, which ere the flight
Of time should leave the day behind, desire
To live in action: But this rising fire
Of loyal rage, which in their breasts did burn,
The thankful Prince thus gently strives to turn
Into a milder passion, such as might
Not scorch with anger, but with judgment light.
How much is it both my wonder and my joy,
That we whom treason studied to destroy,
With near as much of miracle, as in
The last of days, lost bodies that have bin
Scattered amongst the elements, shall be
Convened in the Court of immortality.
Depressed with fortune and disguised with age,
(Sad arguments, brave subjects, to engage
Your loyal valor) I had gone from all
My mortal hopes, had not this secret call
Of heaven, which does with unknown method curb
Our wild intention, brought me to disturb
Your peaceful age, whose abler youth had in
Defending me exposed to ruin bin.
I had no more my conscience (now at rest)
With Widows curses, Orphans tears oppressed;
No more in fighting fields, those busy marts,
Where honor does for fame with death change hearts,
Beheld the sad success of Battails, where
Proud victors make youths conquest ages care,
But hid from all, a crowns false glories, spent
Like beauteous flowers, which vainly waste the scent
Of odors in unhanted deserts, all
My time concealed till withered age should fall
From that short stem of nature, life, to be
Lost in the dust of deaths obscurity.
When in the pride of youth my stars withdrew
Their influence first, I then had stood with you
Those thunderbolts of fate, and bravely died,
Contemning fortune, had that feverish pride
Of valor not been quenched in hope to save
My infant son from an untimely grave.
But he, when from domestic ills conveyed
In safety, being by treacherous fate betrayed
Either by death, or ignorance, from what
His stars, when kindled first, where pointed at,
Either lives not, or else concealed within
Some course disguise, whose poverty has been
So long his dull companion, till he is grown
Not less to us, then to himself unknown.
All this being weighed in reasons scale, is there
Ought in it can tempt decrepid age to bear
Such glorious burdens, which if fortunate
In the obtaining of, in natures date
Can have no long account, ere I again
What I had got with danger, kept with pain,
Summoned by death the graves black monarch, must
With sorrow lose: yet since that heaven so just,
And you so loyal I have found, that it
Might argue fear, if I unmoved should sit
At all your just desires, I here in the sight
Of heaven declare, together with my right,
To prosecute your Liberties as far
As Justice dares to patronize a war.
This with a magnanimity that showed
His youths brave spirits were not all bestowed
On the accounts of age, had to so high
A pitch of zeal inflamed their loyalty,
That in contempt of slow-pack'd counsels they
Did like rash youth, whose wit wants times allay,
Haste to unripe engagements, such as ^ound
The issue weak, whose parents are unsound.
All to those towns where neighborhood had made
Them loved for virtue, or for power obeyed;
Whilst each with his peculiar guar^ attends
His honored Prince, employ their active friends,
Who having with collecting trumpets made
Important errands ready to Invade
The peoples censure, for a theme to fame
Their long lost Princes safe returu proclaim;
Which, though at first, a subject it appeared
Only for faith, when circumstance had cleared
The eye of Reason, from each nobler mind
The embraces of a welcome truth did find.
In public throngs, whilst every forward friend
Spoke his resolves, his sullen foes did spend
Their doubts in private whispers, by exchange
Of which they found hate had no farther range
Then close intelligence, whose utmost bounds
Ere they obtain, the useful trumpet sounds
No distant summons, but close marches to
His loyal friends, whom now their foes might view
In troops, which if fate favor their intents,
Ere long must swell to big-bulk'd Regiments:
Through Country towns, and Cities prouder streets
The murmuring drum in busy marches meets
Such forward valor, husbandmen did fear
The earth would languish the succeeding years
For want of Laborers; nor could business stop
The straightened Prentice, who, the slighted shop
Left to his angry Master, who must be
Forced to abridge his seven years tyranny,
Changes the baser utensils of trade
For burnisht arms, and by example made
More valiant, scorns those shadows which they feared
More then rough war, whilst amongst the cities herd.
To Regiments, from scattering bands being grown,
From that to Armies, whose big looks made known
Those bold designs, which Justice feared to own,
Though hers, till placed in Powers imperial throne,
They now toward action haste; which to begin,
Whilst Castles are secured, and Towns girt in
With armed lines, whose Pallizado's had
Whole Forests of their whispering Oaks unclad.
The Prince, his mercy willing to prevent
Approaching danger, by a Herald sent
To Zarrob^in, commands him to lay down
His arms, and as he owed unto his Crown
A Subjects due allegiance, to appear
Before a month was added to that year,
Within his Court, which now, since action gave
Life to that body whose firm strength did save
His life (by treason levelled at) was in
His moving Camp. But this too weak to win
The doubtful Rebel, since his lawful right
Swords must dispute, the Prince prepares to fight.
Proud Zarrobrin, who had by late success
Taught Siracuse how to avoid distress
By seeking peace, like a black storm that flies
On Southern winds, which in a tumult rise
From neighboring seas, was on his march: But come
Sonear the Prince, that now he had by some
Of's spreading Scouts made full discovery where
His Army lay; whose scarce discovered Rear
Such distance from their well-arm'd Van appeared,
That such whose judgments were with numbers feared
Making no further inquisition, fled
By swift report their pale disease to spread.
Disturbing clouds which rather seemed to rise
From guilt then fear spread darkness ore the eyes
Of The Rebels, who, although by custom made
To death familiar, wish their killing trade
In peace concluded, and with murmures nigh
Grown to the boldness of a mutiny,
Question their own frail judgments, which so often
Had life exposed to dangers, that had brought
No more reward then what preserved them still
The slaves unto a proud Commanders will.
To stop this swift infection, which begun
In lowly huts, to lofty tents had run,
Sly Zarobrin, who to preserve the esteem
Of honor, lest lib'rality might seem
The child of fear, with secret speed prevents
What he appears to slight, their discontents.
As if attending, though attended by
Their young Mock-Prince, whose landscape royalty
Showed only fair, when viewed at distance, he
Passing with slow observant pace to see
Each squadrons order, he confirms their love
With donatives, such as were far above
Their hopes if Victors; then, to show that in
That pride of bounty he had not strove to win
Assistance by unworthy bribes, he leads
Them far from danger, since his judgment reads
In long experience, that authentic story,
Whose lines has taught the nearest way to glory;
That soft delays, like treacherous streams, which by
Submitting lets the rash intruder try
Their dangerous depth, to an unwilling stay
His fierce persuers would ere long betray;
Whose force since of th'untutor'd multitude
By want made desperate, and by custom rude
Would soon waste their unweildy strength, whilst they
Whom discipline had taught how to obey,
By pay made nimble, and by order sure,
Would wars delays with easier wants endure.
This sound advice meeting with sad success
From the persuing Army, whose distress
From tedious marches being too clamorous grown
For's friends estates to quiet, soon was shown
In actions such, which though necessity
Enforced on virtue, made their presence be
To the inconsiderate vulgar, whose loose glance
For virtue take vice gloss'd with circumstance,
Such an oppression, that comparing those
Which fled with mildness, they behold as foes;
Only their ruder followers, whom they curse,
Not that their cause, but company was worse.
When thus their wan^s had brought disorder in,
And that neglect whose looser garb had bin
At first so shie, that what was hardly known
From business then, was now to custom grown.
This large limbed body, since united by
No cement but the love to loyalty
Loses those baser parts, such as to please
Unworthy ends turned duty to disease,
Retaining only those whose valor sought
No more reward then what with blood they bought.
But here, to show that slumbring justice may
Oppressed with power, faint in the busy day
Of doubtful battle; when their valor had
So many souls from robes of fresh unclad
Of his brave friends, that the forsaken Prince
Whose sad success taught knowledge to convince
The Arguments of hope; unguarded left
Unto persuing foes was soon bereft
Of all that in this cloud of fortune might
By opposition or unworthy flight,
But promise fafety, and when death denide
Him her last dark retreat to raise the pride
Of an insulting foe, is forced to see
The scorn of greatness in captivity.
Yet with more terror to limb sorrow in
His mighty soul, such friends as had not bin
By death discharged in fatal battle, now
Suffered so much as made even fear allow
Her palest sons, to seek in future wars
Brave victory got, by ages honor, scars,
Or braver death, that antidote of shame,
Whose stage none pass upon the rode of Fame,
Those that fared best being murdered, others sent
With life to more afflicting banishment.
When thus by him whose sacred order made
The truth authentic, from his fortunes shade
Argalia was redeemed, the Prelate to
Confirm his story, from his bosom drew
The jewel, which having by ways unknown
To him that wore it opened, there was shown
By wit contracted into art, as rare
As his that durst make silver spears compare
With heavens light motion, an Effigies which
His royal Sire, whilst beauty did enrich
His youth, appeared in such epitomy,
As spacious fields are represented by
Rare optics on opposing walls, where sight
Is conzen'd with imperfect forms of light.
When with such joy as Scythians that grow proud
Of day, behold light gild an eastern cloud,
Argalia long had viewed that picture in
Whose face he saw forms that said his had been
Drawn by that pattern, with such thanks, as best
The silent eloquence of looks expressed,
The night grown ancient, ere their stories end,
With solemn joy, leaves his informing friend.

Tier'd with afflictions in a safe retreat
From the active world, Pharonnida is now
Making a sacred monastry her seat,
Where near approaching the confirming vow,
II.
A rude assault, makes her a Prisoner to
Almanzors power, to expiate whose sin
The subtle Traitor swiftly leads her to
The Court, where she had long a stranger bin.
HEre harsh employments, the unsavory weeds
Of barren wants had overrun the seeds
Of fancy with domestic cares, and in
Those winter storms shipwrack'd what ere had bin
My youths imperfect offspring, had not I
For love of this neglected poverty,
That meager fiend whose rustic tallons stick
Contempt on all that are enforced to seek
Like me, a poor subsistence amongst the low
Shrubs of employment, whilst blessed wits that grow
Good fortunes favorits, like proud Ceders stand
Scorning the stroke of every feeble hand,
Whose vain attempts, though they should martyr sense,
Would be repulst with big-bulk'd confidence:
Yet blush not gentle Muse, thou often have had
Followers, by fortunes hand as meanly clad,
And such as when time had worn envy forth
Succeeding ages honored for their worth.
Then though not by these rare examples fier'd
To vain presumption, with a soul untir'd
As his, whose fancies short Ephemeraes know
No life, but what does from his liquor flow,
Whose wit grown wanton with canaries wealth
Makes the chaste Muse a pandress to a health,
Our royal Lovers story I Will pursue
Through times dark paths, which now have led me to
Behold Arga^ia, by assisting art
Advanced to health, preparing to depart
From his obscure abode, to prosecute
Designs, which when, success strikes terror mute
With pleasing joy, shall him the mirror prove
Of forward valor, glost with filial love.
But let us here with prosperous blessings leave
A while the noble Hero, and receive
From times accounts the often varying story
Of her whose love conducted him to glory,
Distressed Pharonnida, whose sufferings grown
Too great for all that virtue ere had known
From humane precepts, flies for refuge to
Heavens narrowest paths, where the directing clew
Of Law, to which the Earth for order owes,
Lost in zeals light, a useless trouble grows.
Returned were all the messengers, which she
Had at the first salutes of Liberty
To seek Argalia sent: But since none brought
Her passions ease, sick hope no longer sought
Those flattering Emp'ricks; but at Loves bright fires
Kindling her zeal, with sober pace retires
From all expected honors, to bestow
What time her youth did yet to nature ow,
A solemn Recluse, by a sacred vow
Locked up from action, whilst she practiced how
By speculation safely to attain
What busier Mortals doubtfully do gain.
Within the compass of the valley, where
Ismanders palace stood, the pious care
Of elder times had placed, a Monastrie,
Whose fair possessors from life's tumults free,
In a calm voyage toward heaven (their home) there spent
The quiet hours, so sweetly innocent,
As if that place, that happy place, had bin
Of all the earth alone exempt from sin;
Some sacred power ordaining (when 'twas given)
It for the next preparing school to heaven;
From whence those Vestals should, when life expires,
Be for supplies advanced to heavenly quires.
Lost to the world in sorrows lab'rinths, here
Pharonnida, now out of hope to clear
This tempest of her fate, resolves to cast
Her faiths firm anchor: But before she past
The dangerous straits of a restrictive vow,
She to such friends as judgment taught her how
To prize, imparts it; amongst which few, the fair
Silvandra, whom lost love had taught despair,
With sad Florenza, both resolve to take
The same strict habit, and with her forsake
The treacherous world. But to disturb this clear
Stream of devotion, soon there did appear
Dissuading friends, Ismander loath to lose
So loved a guest, whilst she is of power to choose,
Together with the virtuous Amida,
Spend their most powerful arguments to draw
Her from those cold thoughts, that her virtue might
Whilst unconceal'd, lend weaker mortals light.
Long had this friendly conflict lasted, ere
Her conquered friends, whom a religious care
Frighted from robbing heaven of Saints, withdrew
To mourn her loss; yet ere they left her to
Her cloistered Cell, Ismander, to comply
With aged custom, calls such friends whom nigh
Abode had made familiar, to attend
His Royal guest; some hasty days they spend
In solemn feasting, where each friend although
Clothed as when they at triumphs met, did show
A silent sadness, such as wretched Brides,
When the neglected nuptial robe but hides
The cares of an obstructed love, before
Harsh parents wear. The mirthless feast past ore,
The noble Virgins in procession by
The mourning train, unto the Monast'ry
Slowly conducted are, each led by two
Full-breasted Maids, whom Hymen to renew
The worlds decaying stock, his joys to prove
By contracts summoned to conjugal love.
These as they past, like Paranymphs which led
Young Beauties to espouse a Maidenhead
With harmony, whose each^concording part
Tickled the ear, whilst it did strike the heart
With mournful numbers, rifling every breast
Of their deep thoughts, thus the sad sense expressed.
I.
To secret walks, to silent shades,
To places where no voice invades
The air, but what is created by
Their own retired society,
Slowly these blooming Nymphs we bring
To wither out their fragrant spring,
For whose sweet odors Lovers pine,
Where beauty does but vainly shine:
Cho.
Where Natures wealth, and Arts assisting cost
Both in the beams of distant hope are lost.
2.
To Cloisters where cold damps destroy
The busy thoughts of Bridal joy;
To Vows whose harsh events must be
Vncoupl'd cold Virginity;
To pensive prayers, where heaven appears
Through the pale cloud of private tears,
These captive Virgins we must leave,
Till freedom they from death receive:
Only in this remote conclusion blessed,
Cho.
This vale of tears leads to eternal rest.
3.
Then since that such a choice as theirs,
Which styles them the undoubted heirs
To heaven, 'twere sinful to repent:
Here may they live till beauty spent
In a religious life, prepare
Them with their fellow-Saints to share
Celestial joys, for whose desire
They freely from the world retire:
Cho.
Go then, and rest in blessed peace, whilst we
Deplore the loss of such society.
Through all the slow delays of Love arrived
To the unguarded gate, friendship that thrived
Not in Persuasions rhetoric, withdraws
Her forces to assist that juster cause,
Prayers for their future good; with which whilst they
Are taking leave, th'unfolded gates give way
For the blessed Votries entrance, whom to meet,
A hundred pair of Maids, more chastely sweet
Then slowers which grow untoucht in deserts, were
Led by their Abbess; to whose pious care
These being joined, with such a sad reverse
Of eyes oreflowing, as the sable hearse
Close mourners leave, when they must see no more
Their coffined dead, their friends are from the door
With eager looks, woes last since now denied
A further view, departs unsatisfied.
This last of duties which the dearest friend
Ought to perform, brought to successful end;
For here no custom with a dowries price
At entrance paid, nursed slothful avarice:
They Are softly led through a fair garden, where
Each walk was by the founders pious care,
For various fancies, wanton imagrie,
To catch the heart, and not to court the eye,
Adorned with sacred histories. From hence
To the center of this fair circumference
The fabric come, the roving eye confined
Within the buildings, to enlarge the mind
In contemplation, saw where happy Art
Had on the figured walls the second part
Of Sacred story, drawn in lines that had
The worlds Redeemer from his first being clad
In robes of flesh, presented to the view
Through all his passion, till it brought him to
The Cross, that highest seal of love, where he
A sinless offering died, from sin to free
The captived world, which knew no other price
But that to pay the debts of Paradise.
Past through this place, where bleeding passion strove
Their melting pity to refine to love,
They Are now the Temple entered, where to skreen
Their thoughts yet nearer heaven, whom they had seen
In The entrance scourged, contemned and crucifide,
They there beheld, though veils of glory hide
Some part of the amazing Majesty
In his Ascension, as when raised to be
For them that hear his death freed from the hate
Of angry heaven, the powerful Advocate.
Besides these bold attempts of Art that stood
To fright the wicked, or to prompt the good;
Something more great, more sacred, then could by
Art be expressed, without the help oth' eye
Reached at the center of the soul, from whence
To heaven, our raised desires circumference,
Striking the lines of Contemplation, she
Wrapped from the earth, is in an ecstasy
Holy, and high, through faith's clear optic shown
Those joys which to departed saints are known.
Before those prayers which zeal had tedious made
With their last troops did conquered heaven invade;
The day was on the glittering wings of light,
Fled to the western world, and swarthy night
In her black Empire throned; from silver shrines
The kindled lamps through all the temple shines
With dapl'd rays, that did to the eye present
The beauties of the larger firmament.
In which still calm, when all their rites were now
So near performed, that the confirming vow
Alone remained, a sudden noise of rude
And clamorous sound, did through the ear intrude
On their affrighted fancies, in so high
A voice, that all their sacred harmony
In this confusion lost, appeared so small,
As if that whispered which was made to call.
Although the awful majesty that here
Religion held, the weak effects of fear
With faith expelled, yet when that nearer to
Their slender gates the murmuring tumult drew;
The Abbess sends not to secure, but see
Who durst attempt what heaven from all kept free
By strictest law, save those unhallowed hands
That follow curses whilst they fly commands,
But they being entered ere the timorous Scout
Could notice give, fear, which first sprung from doubt
Being into wild confusion grown, from all
Set forms affrights them, whilst at once they call
For heavens protecting mercy, to behold
That place where peaceful Saints used to unfold
Heavens Oracles, possessed with villains that
Did never know ought but want to tremble at,
Which looked like those that with proud Angels fell,
And to storm heaven were sent in arms from hell,
Converts that Scean where nothing did appear
But calm devotion, to distracting fear;
Amazed with horror, each sad votress stands
Whilst sacred relics drop from trembling hands;
Here one whose heart with fears convulsions faint,
Flies to the shrine of her protecting saint;
By her another stands, whose spirits spent
In Passion, looks pale as her monument:
One shrieks, another prays, a third had crossed
Her self so much, ill Angels might have lost
The way to hurt her, if not taught to do'r,
Cause she to the sign too much did attribute.
The royal Stranger by her fear persu'd
To the altar fled, had with mixed passion viewed
This dreadful troop, whilst from the temple gate
They past the seat where trembling virgins sat
Free from uncivil wrongs, as if that they
That entered had been men prepared to pray,
Not come to ravish, from which sight her fear
Picks flowers of hope, but such, as they drawn near
From fancies soft lap, in a Hirocane
Of passion dropped her prayers and tears in vain
As words in winds, or showers in Seas, when they
Prepare for ruin the obstructed way
To pity, which her stock of prayers had cost,
In the dark shade of sudden horror lost.
Seized on by two of the sacrilegious train
Whose black disguise had made the eye in vain
Seek to inform the soul, she and the poor
Florenza, whilst their helpless friends deplore
With silent tears so sad a loss, are drew
From the clasped Altar in the offended view
Of their protecting saints, from whose shrines in
A dismal omen dropped what ere had bin
With hopes of merit placed. Black sulphry damps
With swift convulsions quenched the sacred lamps,
The fabric shakes, and as if grieved they stood
To circle guilt, the walls sweat tears of blood.
Shrieks, such as if those fainted souls that there
Trod heaven's strait paths, in their just quarrel were
Rose from their silent dormitories to
Deter their foes, through all the temple flew.
But here in vain destroying angels shook
The sword of vengeance, whilst his bold crimes struck
Against heaven in high contempt; with impious haste,
Snatched from the altar, whilst their friends did waste
Unheard Orizons for their safety, they
Unto the Fabrick's utmost gate convey
Their beauteous prizes, where with silence stood
Their dreadful guard, which like a neighboring wood
When vapors tip the naked boughs in light,
With unsheathed swords through the black mists of night
A sparkling terror struck, with such a speed
As scarce gave time to fear what would succeed.
To such preceding vilanies, within
Her Coach imprisoned, the sad Princess, in
A march for swiftness such as busy war
Hastes to meet death in, but for silence far
More still then funerals, is by that black troop
With such exchange as falling stars do stoop
To nights black region, from the Monastrie
Hurried in haste, by whom, or whither, she
Yet knows no more then souls departing, when
Or where, to meet in robes of flesh again.
The day salutes her, and uncurtain'd light
Welcoms her through the confines of the night*
But lends no comfort, every object that
It showed her, being such, as if frighted at
The Prince of day, grieved h'ad no longer slept,
To shun, shrunk back beneath a cloud, and wept.
When the unfolded curtains gave her eyes
Leave to look forth, a troop, whose close disguise
Were stubborn arms, she only saw, and they
So silent, naught but motion did betray
The faculties of life, by whom being led
In such a sad march as their honored dead
Close mourners follow, she some flow-pac'd days
Amongst strangers passing through stranger ways,
(At both amazed) at length, unfathomed by
Her deepest thought within the reach oth' eye
Her known Ghirenza views; but with a look
From whence cold passion all the blood had took,
And in her face (that frozen sea of fear)
Left naught but storms of wonder to appear.
Convened within the spacious Judgment-hall
Of Reason, she, ere this had summoned all
Her weaker passions to the impartial Bar
Of Moral Virtue, where they sentenced are
Only to an untroubled silence; in
Which serious act whilst she had busied bin,
She is, unnoted, ere the fall of day
Brought by her convoy to a Lodge that lay
Off from the rode, a place, when seen, she knew
Ere his rebellion, had belonged unto
Her worst of foes, Almanzor, which begins
At first a doubt, whose growing force soon wins
The field of faith, and tells her timorous thought
Her fathers troops would never have thither brought
Her, if designed to suffer, since that he
Knew those more fit for close captivity.
But long her reason lies not fettered in
These cross Dilemma's; the slow night had been
With tedious hours past ore, whilst she by none
But Mutes, no less unheard, then their unknown
Is only waited on, by whom, when day
To action called (she veiled) is led the way
To the attending Convoy, who had now
Varied the Scene, Almanzor studying how
To court compassion in his Prince, dares not
At the first view, ere merit had begot
A calm remission of rebellious sin,
Affront an anger which had justice bin
In his confusion; his arms he now behind,
As that which might too soon have called to mind
His former crimes, he leaves, and for them took
To gain the aspect of a pitying look,
A Hermites homely weed, his willing train
By that fair gloss their liberties to gain,
Rode armed; but so, what for offense they bore,
Was in submission to lay down before
The throne of injured power, to cure whose fear
Their armed heads on halter'd necks appear
Near to the rear of these, the Princess in
A mourning Litter, close as she had bin
In a night-march unto her tomb, is through
The Cities wandering tumults led unto
The royal palace, at whose gates all stay
Save bold Almanzor, whom the Guards obey
For his appearing sanctity so much,
That he unquestioned enters, and thought such
As his grave habit promised, soon obtained
The Princes sight, where with a gesture feigned
To all the shapes of true devotion, he
By a successful fiction comes to be
Esteemed the true converter of those wild
Bandits, which being by their own crimes exiled
In spite of law had lived to punish those
Which did the rules of punishment compose.
These being pardoned, as he would took from thence
Encouragement, veiled under the pretense
Of a religious pity, he begins
In language, whose emolient smoothness wins
An easy conquest on belief, to frame
A sad Petition, which although in name
It had disguised Pharonnida, did find
So much of pity as the Prince inclined
To lend his aid for the relief of her
Whose virtue found so fair a character
In his description, it might make unblest
That power which left so much of worth distressed.
Though too much tired with private cares to show
In public throngs how much his love did owe
To suffering virtue, yet since told that she
Was too much masked in clouds of grief to be
The object of the censuring Court, he to
The Litter goes, whose sable veil withdrew
With wonder, that did scarce belief admit
Shadowed in grief, he sees his daughter sit,
His long lost daughter, whom unsought, to be
Thus strangely found, to such an ecstasy
Of joy exalts him, that his spirits by
Those swift pulsations had been all let fly
With thanks toward heaven, had not the royal Maid
With showers of penitential tears allaid
Those hotter passions, and revoked him to
Support her griefs, whose burden had out-grew
The powers of life, but that there did appear
Kind natures love, to cure weak natures fear.
In this encounter of their passions, both
With sorrow silent stood, words being loath
TO intrude upon their busy thoughts, till they
In moist compassion melted had away
His angers fever, and her frozen ^ears
In Natures balm, soft loves extracted tears:
Like a sad Patient whose forgotten strength
Decayed by cronick ills, has made the length
Of life his burden, when near death, meets there
Unhop'd for health; so from continual care,
The souls slow hectic, elevated by
This cordial joy, the slothful Lethargy
Of age, or sorrow finds an easier cure
Then the unsafe extreme, a Calenture.
Nor are these comforts long constrained to rest
Within the confines of his own swelled breast,
Ere its dismantl'd rays did in a flight
Swift as the motions of unbodied light
Disperse its Epidemick virtues through
The joyful Court, which now arrived unto
Its former splendour, heavens expected praise
Does on the wings of candid mercy raise:
Which spreading in a joyful Jubilee
To all offenders, tells Almanzor he
Might safely now unmask; which done, ere yet
Discovered, at the well-pleased Princess feet
Humbl'd with guilt he kneels; who at the sight
As much amazed as so sublime a flight
Of joy admitted, stands attentive to
What did in these submissive words ensue.
Behold, great Sir, (for now I dare be seen)
An object for your mercy that had been
Too dreadful for discovery, had not this
Preceding joy told me, no Crime could miss
The rode of mercy, though like mine, a sin
The suffering Nation is invellop'd in.
Sunk in the ocean of my guilt, I h'd gone
A desperate Rebel, waited on by none
But Outlaws to a grave obscure, had not
Relenting heaven thus taught me how to blot
Out some of sins black characters, ere I
Beheld the beams of injured Majesty.
This in his passions relaxation spoke,
Persuades the Princes justice to revoke
Its former rigor. By the helpful hand
Of mercy raised, Almanzor soon did stand
Not only pardoned, but secured by all
His former honors from a future fall,
Making that fortune which did now appear
Their pities object, through the glass of fear
With envy looked on, but in vain, he stood
Confirmed in Loves Meridian altitude
The length of life from Honors western shade,
Except in new Rebellion retrograde:
Which plotting leave him, till the winding clew
Of fancy shall conduct your knowledge to
Those uncouth vaults; and mounting the next story,
See Virtue climbing to the throne of glory.
The End of the First Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO II.
The Argument.
I.
Leaving Pharonnida to entertain
The varieus passions of her Father, we
Must now return to see Argalia gain
That power by which he sets his Father free
II.
From the command of haughty Rebels, who
By justice sent to a deserved death,
Argalia takes the Crown, his merits due,
And the old Prince in peace resigns his breath.
Returned to see what all the dark records
Of the old Spartan History affords
In The progress of Argalia's fate, I found
The chained Historian here so strictly bound
To follow truth, although at dangers cost,
No silent night, nor s^^cky battle lost
The doubtful rode, which often did appear
Through floods of faction filled with storms of fear
Obscure and dark, to the belief of that
Less guilty age; though then to tremble at
Romes bold ambition, and those prodigies
Of earth, their Tyrants, to inform their eyes,
Left mourning monuments of ill, but none
Like what they now attempt, a sin unknown
To old Aspirers, which should have been sent
Some Ages forward for a president
To these, with whom compared, their crimes had bin,
Though past to act, but weak essays of sin.
With such a speed as the supplies of air
Fearing a vacuum, hasten to repair
The ruptures of the earth, at our last view
We left revived Argalia posting to
Aetolia's distant confines, where arrived,
He found their Army, whose atempts had thrived
Since he Epirus had forsook, so far
Advanced, that now the varied scene of war
Transferred to faithless Ardena, was there
Fixed in a siege, whose slow approaches were
The doubts of both; the city pines for fear
Remote supplies might fail, which drawn so near
The circling Army knows, that either they
Must fly from conquest near obtained, or stay
To meet a danger, which by judgment scanned,
Their strength appears unable to withstand.
Whilst thus their pensive leaders busied are
In cross dilemma's, as by public war
He meant to meet revenge in private, to
Their camp Argalia comes, a camp which knew
Him by the fair-wrought characters of fame
So well, that now he needs no more then name
Himself to merit welcome, all mistrust
Being cleared by them which left as too unjust
To be obeyed, the false Epirots ^ide,
When by his loss made subject to the pride
Of stranger Chiefs; these for their virtue praised
For number feared, to such a height had raised
Applauding truths of him, that Zarrobrin
Conjoined to one he trembled at, whilst seen
In opposition, slights what did of late
Appear a dreadful precipice of fate.
Lest poor employments might make favor show
Like faint mistrust, he does at first bestow
On the brave stranger the supreme command
Of some choice horse, selected to withstand
The fierce Epirot's march, whose Army ere
The slow Aetolians could their strength prepare
Fit to resist, if not by him withstood,
With case had gained a dangerous neighborhood*
But he, whose angers thunderbolts could stay
Though hurled from clouds of rage, if the allay
Of judgment interposed, here finding naught
More safe then haste, ere his secure foes thought
Of opposition, strongly had possessed
A strait in which small troops had often distressed
Large bodied Armies, until brought so low,
Those they contemned did liberty bestow.
Whilst stopped by this unlooked for remora
The baffled Army often had strove to draw
Argalia from his safe retreats, but found
His art of more advantage then his ground;
In the dead Age of unsuccesful night
A forward party which had learned to fight.
From honors dictates, not commands, being by
Youths hasty guide, rash valor, brought so night,
Argalia's troops, that in a storm which cost
Some lives, they many noble Captives lost:
Amongst which number, as if thither sent
By such a fate as showed Heavens close intent
Pointed at good, E^riolus appears
First a sad captive; but those common fears
Soon, whilst in conflict with his passions, rest
On the wished object of his long inquest
Admired Argalia, to whose joy he brings
As much of honor, as elected Kings
Meet in those votes, which so auspicious prove,
They light to honor with the rays of love.
Having from him in full relation heard
Pharonnida yet lived, whom long he feared
Beyond redemption lost, they thence proceed
To councels, whose mature results might breed
Their heedle^s foes confusion, which since they
That now were captives, bore the greatest sway
In the opposing Army proves a task
So free from danger, death did scarce unmask
The face of horror in a charge, before
Argalia's name echoed in praises ore
The rallied troops, summons from thence so large
A party, that the valor of a charge
In those that stood were madness, which to shun,
Base Cowards taught brave Fighters how to run.
This easy conquest gained; ere Zarrobrin
Was with his slower Army drawn within
The noise of the battle, to such vast extent
Of fame, high virtues spreading ornament,
Had raised Argalia's merits, that the pride
Of his Commander wisely laid aside
For such advantage, to let honor stand
On her own basis, the supreme command
Of all the strangers in his Camp to him
He freely gives, a power which soon would dim
His, if ere by some harsh distemper placed
In opposition; but his thoughts embraced
In all suspicions darkest cells, no fiend
So pale as fear, fixed on the sudden end
Of high designs, he looks on this success
As the strait rode to future happiness
With such a speed as prosperous victors go
To see, and conquer, when the vanquished foe
Retreats from honor, the Aetolian had
Followed success, till that fair hand unclad
The sunk Epirot of his strength, and now
Secured from foreign ills was studying how
To cure domestic dangers; which since he
The weak foundation of his Tyranny
Had fixed in sand but only cemented
With loyal blood, such just contempt had bred
IN the Ages deep discerning judgments, that
The unsettl'd herd, ere scarcely lightened at
Those sober flames, like ill mixed vapors break
In blustering murmurs forth, which though too weak
To force his fortune on the rocks of hate,
With terror shook the structure of his fate.
Like wise Physicians, which when called to cure
Infectious ills, with Antidotes make sure
Themselves from danger; since hypocrisy
Could steal no entrance to affection, he
Leads part of's Army for his guard, that they
Where mines did fail, by storm might force a way.
But since he doubts constrained domestics, though
Abroad obedient, might, when come to know
From burdened friends their cause of grief, forsake
Unjust commands, his wiser care did take
Argalia and his stranger troops, as those
(Which unconcerned) he freely might dispose
To wind up all the engines of his brain,
So guilt were gilded with the hopes of gain.
By hasty marches being arrived with these
Within Aetolia, where his frowns appease
Those bubbles, that (their Neptune absent) would
Have swelled to waves, ere his hot spirits cooled
Were with relaxing rest, he visits him
The weak reflex of whose light crown looks dim
To the burnished splendour of his blade that set
Him only there to be the cabinet
Of that usurped diadem, which he
Whose subtle arts in clouded brows could see
The hearts intended storms, beheld without
His unstrain'd reach, until the peoples doubt,
Which yet lived in the dawn of hope, he saw
Oreshadow'd with the forms of injured Law.
Though time (that fatal enemy to truth)
Had not alone robbed the fresh thoughts of youth
OF the knowledge of their long lost Prince, but been
Even unto those that had adored him in
His throne, oblivions handmaid, yet lest by
Some power occult that in captivity
Forsakes not injured Monarchs, there remained
In most some passions, which first entertained
At pities cost, at length by reason tried
Grew so much loved, that only power denied
Them to support his sinking cause, which seen
By Zorabrin, whose tyranny had been
At first their fear, and now their hate, he brings
His Army, an Elixar, which to Kings
Transforms Plebeians, by the strength of that
To bind those hands, that else had strugl'd at
Their heads offense, which wanting power to cure,
They now with griefs convulsions must endure.
A Court convened of such whose killing trade
The rigid Law so flexible had made,
That their keen Votes had forced the bloodiest field
To the deep tincture of the Scaffold yield;
Forth of his uncouth prison summoned by
The rude commands of wronged Authority,
An object which succeeding Ages when
But spoke of weep, because they blushed not then,
The Prince appears a guarded captive in
That City where his morning Star had bin
Beheld in honors Zenith; slowly by
Inferior slaves, which nere on Majesty
Whilst uneclips'd durst look, being led to prove
Who blushed with anger, or looked pale with love.
By these being to a mock-tribunal brought,
Where damned rebellion for disguise had sought
The veil of justice, but so thinly spread,
Each stroke their envy levelled at his head
Betrayed black treasons hand, couched in that Vote
Which struck with Law to cut Religions throat.
From a poor Pleader, whose cheap conscience had
Been sold for bribes, long ere the purple clad
So base a thing, their calm-soul'd Sovereign hears
Death's fatal doom, which when pronounced, appears
His candor, and their guilt, the one expressed
By a reception, which declared his breast
Unstir'd with passion; the other struggling in
Their troubled looks, which showed this monstrous sin
That this damned plot did to rebellion bear,
Even frighted those that treasons midwives were.
Hence (all their black designs encouraged by
The levelled paths of prosperous vilany)
High mounted mischief, stretched upon the wing
Of powerful ill, persues the helpless King
To the last stage of life, a scaffold, whence
With tears (cheap offsprings to his innocence)
Such of his pitying friends as durst disclose
Their passions, view him, whilst insulting foes
(Exalted on the pyramids of pride)
By long-wing'd power, with base contempt deride
Their sorrow, and his sufferings whom their hate
Had followed near the period of his fate;
Which being now so near arrived, that all
With various passion did expect the fall
Of the last fatal stroke, kind heaven to save
A life so near the confines of the grave,
Transcends dull hope by so sublime a flight,
That dazzled faith, (amazed with too much light;
Whilst ecstasies of wonder did destroy
Unripe belief) near lost the rode of joy.
Even with the juncture of that minute when
The ax was falling, from those throngs of men
Swayed by's command, Argalia with a speed
That startled action, mounts the stage, and freed
The trembling Prince from deaths pale fear; which do ne
To show on what just grounds he had begun
So brave, so bold an action, he seises all
That knowledge or suspicion dares to call
The Tyrants friends, the guilty Tyrant, who
Whilst he does from his distant palace view
This dreadful change, with a disdain as high
As are his crimes, being apprehended by
Argalia's nimble guards, is forced to be
Their sad Conductor to a destiny
So full of horror, that it hardly lies
In's foes to save him for a sacrifice
From their wild rage who know no justice but
What does, by death, a stop to fury put.
From noisless prayers and bloodless looks, being by
The bold Attempters of his liberty
Raised to behold his rescue; heedless fear
Hatched by mistake, from those that bordered near
Had with such swiftness its infection spread,
That the more distant knowing not what bred
The busy tumult, in so wild a haste
As vanquished troops which at the heels are chased
Fly the persuing sword, they madly run
To meet those dangers which they strove to shun*
In which confusion none of the throng had bin
Left to behold how justice triumphed in
Revenges throne, had not a swift command
By power enabled, hastened to withstand
That troubled torrent which the truth ourgrew
Until their fears original they knew.
The onset past, Argalia, having first
Secured the Tyrant, for whose blood the thirst
Of the vexed people raged, he mounted on
That scaffold whence his father should have gone
A royal martyr to the grave, did there
By a commanded silence first prepare
The clamorous throng to hear the hidden cause
Which made him slight their new-created laws.
Then, in that mart of satisfaction which
With knowledge does the doubtful herd enrich,
The public view, he freely shows how far
Through ^ortunes deserts the auspicious star
Of heavens unfathomed providence had led
Him from the axe to save that sacred head,
Whose reverend snow his full discovery had
In the first dress of youthful vigor clad,
Could constant nature sympathize with that
Reviving joy his spirits panted at.
His sons relation, seconded by all
That suffering sharer in his pitied fall,
Mantinea's Bishop, knew, joined to the sight
Of that known jewel, whose unwasted light
Had served alone to guide them, satisfies
The inquisition even of critic eyes
With such a fullness of content, that they
(Each from his Prince being lightened with a ray
Of sprightly mirth) endeavored to destroy
Their former grief in hope of future joy:
Which to attain to, those whose counsels had
The land in blood, and them in mourning clad,
Called forth by order to confession, there
Are scarce given time the foulness to declare
Of their past crimes, before the peoples hate
(That headstrong monster) strove to anticipate
The sword of vengeance, and in wild rage save
The labor of an ignominious grave
To every parcel of those rent limbs, that
When but beheld, they lately trembled at:
"Such being the fate of falling Tyrants, when
"Conquering, the fear, conquered, the scorn of men
But here lest inconsiderate rage should send
Their souls to darkness, ere confession end
Their tragic story, hated Zarrobrin
With that unhappy boy whose Crown had been
Worn but to make him capable to die
A sacrifice to injured liberty,
Rescued by order from the rout, is to
A public trial brought, where in the view
Of all the injured multitude, the old
Audacious traitor did to the light unfold
His acts of darkness, which discovered him
They gazed on, whilst unquestioned power did dim
Discerning wits but a dull Meteor, one
By hot ambition mounted to a throne,
By an attractive policy, which when
Its influence failed, back to that lazy Fen,
His fortunes Center, hurling him again,
The only Star in Honor's Orb would reign.
This sly Imposture seconded by that
Rebellious guilt his actions offered at
In all its bold attempts, had kindled in
The late supporters of unprosperous sin
So high a rage, that in wild fury they
Their anger wanting what it should obey,
A sober judgment, stands not to dispute
With the slow Law, but with their strength confute
All tending to delay; like torrents broke
Through the imprisoning banks, to get one stroke
At heads so hated all rush in, until
Their severed limbs want quantity to fill
A room in the eyes receiving beams; this done,
With blood and anger warmed, they wildly run
To search out such whom consanguinitie
Had rendered so unhappy, as to be
Allied to them, all which with rage that styled
Beasts merciful, and angry soldiers mild,
They to destruction chase, whilst guiltless walls
In which they dwelt in funeral blazes falls,
Where burns inviting treasure, as they saw
In the golds splendour an Anathema
So full of horror, as it seemed to be
A plague beyond unpitied Poverty.
Impetuous Rage, like whirle winds unoppos'd
Hushed to a calm, as hate had but unclos'd
The anger-blinded eyes of Love, the bold
Flame like a fire, forced from repulsive cold,
Breaks through the harsh extreme of hate, to show
How much their loyal duty did out-grow
Those fruits of forced obedience, which before
They slowly to intruding Tyrants bore;
In which procession of their joy, that he
Might meet their hopes with a solemnity
Large as their love, or his delight; the Prince
Taught by informing age how to convince
Ambitions hasty Arguments, calls forth
His long lost son, whose late discovered worth
Was grown the Ages wonder, to support
The ponderous Crown, whilst he did tread the short
And sickly step of age, untroubl'd by
The burden of afflicting Majesty.
His Coronation past in such a tide
Of full content, as to be glorifide,
Blessed souls in the worlds conflagration shall
From tombs their reunited bodies call,
The feeble Prince leaving the joyful throng
Of his applauding Subjects, seeks among
Religious shades (those cool retreats) to find
That best composer of a stormy mind,
A still devotion, on whose downy bed
Not long he'ad lay before that entrance led
Him to the Court of heaven, though through the gate
Of welcome death, a cross, which though from fate,
Not accident, he being instructed by
Age, and Religion, to prepare to di^
On Natures summons, yet so deep a strain
Spreads ore those robes that joy had died in grain,
That his heroic son to meet alone
So fierce a so, leaving the widowed throne
Retreats to silent tears, whose plenteous spring
By the example of their mourning King,
From those small clouds there first beheld to rise,
Bege^s a storm in every Subjects eyes.
Betraying time, the worlds unquestioned thief.
Intending ore obliterated grief
Some new transcription, to perform it brings
A ravished quill from Loves expanded wings,
Presenting to Argalia's willing view
What ere blind chance rolled on the various clew
Of his fair Mistress, Fate, unfolded by
Euriolus, who was when victory
First gave him freedom, by Argalia sent
With speed that might anticipate intent,
The unconfined Pharonnida to free
From her religious strict captivity.
But being arrived where contrary to all
His thoughts, he heard how first she came to fall
Into Almanzors hand, by whom conveyed
Thence to her Fathers Court, his judgment stayed
Not to consult with slow advice, but hastes
On the persuit of her; whom found, he wastes
Few days before fair opportunity
Was so auspicious to his prayers, that he
Not only proves a happy Messenger
Where first employed, but in exchange for her
Returns the story of what had been done
Since first this tempest of their fate begun.
How she forsook the Monastry, and in
What agonies of passion thence had bin
Forced to her fathers Court, where all her fears
Dissolve in pity, he related hears
With calm attention; but when come to that,
Whose first conceptions he had trembled at,
The Siracusians fresh assaults unto
That Virgin-fort, whose strength although he knew
Too great for storm, yet since assisted by
Her Fathers power, the wraths of victory
Rent by command from his deserts might crown
Another brows, to pull those Laurels down
Ere raised in triumph, he prepares to move
By royal steps unto the throne of love.
The End of the Second Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO III.
The Argument.
I.
From the Aetolians l^te victorious King
Ambassadors in Sparta's Court arrive;
Where slighted, back they this sad Message bring
That force must only make his just claim thrive.
II.
Which to confirm, the Epirots power invades
His Land, in hopes for full reward to have
Pharonnida; but close Almanzor shades
His glorious hopes in an untimely grave.
AN unripe rumor, such as Causes near
Declining catch at, when betraying fear
Plunges at hope, had through Ghirenza spread
The story of Argalia's fate, but shed
From such loose clouds of scattered fame, as by
Observant wits were only thought to fly
IN the airy region of report, where they
Are forced each wind of fancy to obey.
Whose various blasts, when brought unto the test
Of judgment, rather the desires expressed,
Then knowledge of its Authors: here amongst those
Of various censure, sly Almanzor chose
To be of the believing part, since that
Might soonest crush all hopes that levelled at
Affection to Pharonnida, whom he
Strove to preserve in calm neutralitie.
But here he fails to countermine his plot,
This seeming fable soon appears begot
By solid truth, a truth which scorns to lie
Begging at the gates of probability;
Which to avoid, she from Argalia brings
Ambassadors (those mouths of absent Kings)
To plead her right, at whose unlooked for view
Almanzor, whose falacious schemes were drew
Only for false Phaenomena's, is now
Forced to erect new figures, and allow
Each star his influence; but declared in vain,
Since Pride did lord of the Ascendant reign;
Pride, which conjoined to policy had made
All other motions seem but retrograde.
His black Arts thus deceived, since naught could make
The dull Spectators ignorance mistake
This constellation for a Comet, he
Attempts with fear of its malignitie
To fright each busy gazer, and since all
The circles of opinion were to fall
Like spacious Azminths in that Zenith, to
S^ttle the Prince, through whom the people view
All great conjunctions, where the different sign
Should force those aspects, which might amongst that trine
Of love else hold a concord, to dispense
On him its most destructive influence.
The Court being thus prepared, he boldly now
Dares the delayed Ambassadors allow
A long expected audience, which in brief
Makes known their masters fate in the relief
Of's injured father, thence proceeds to show
How much of praise his thankful friends did owe
To heaven for's own restored estate, which he
Desires to join in calm confederacy
With them, his honored neighbors; hence they past
To what concerned Pharonnida, their last
And most important Message: which when heard
In such a Language as the Rivals feared,
A Language, which, to prove his interest
In her unquestioned, come but to request
The freedom of a fathers grant, a high
But stifled rage began to mutiny
In all their breasts, such, as if not withheld
By the Law of Nations, had her father swelled
To open acts of violence; which seen
By some of the Lords, they calm his passion in
A cool retreat, such as might seem to be,
Though harsh contempt, wrapped in civilitie.
Fired with disdain, the Ambassadors in such
A speed which showed affronts that did but touch
Their Masters honor wounded theirs, forsook
Ghirenza, whilst Euriolus betook
Himself to some more safe disguise that might
Protect him, till the subject of delight,
The course his royal master meant to stear
In gaining her, his Story makes appear
Unto distressed Pharonnida, who in
That confidence secure, as she had been
From all succeeding ills protected by
A guard of Angels, in a harmony
Of peaceful thoughts, such as in dangers keep
Safe innocence, rocks all her cares asleep.
But here she rests not long before the fall
Of second storms proves this short interval
But lightning, which in tempests shows unto
Shores, which the shipwrack'd must no more then view:
Anger, ambition, hate, and jealous fear
Had all conspired Loves ruin, which drew near
From hasty counsels rash results, which in
His passions s^orm had by her Father bin
Like rocks, which wretched Mariners mistake
For Harbors, fled to, when he did forsake
That safer channel of advice that might
From free conventions, like the welcome light
Of Pharos guided his designs, till they
At Anchor in the rode of Honor lay.
As if his fears by nothing could have bin
Secured, but what proved him ungrateful in
Argalia's ruin, all discourses are
Distastefull grown, but what to sudden war
Incites his rage: which humor, though it needs
No greater fire then what his envy feeds,
Besides those Court-Tarantula's whose breath
Stings easy Princes, till they dance to death
At the delightful sound of flattery, there
Were deeper wits, such whom a subtle care,
Not servile fear taught how to aggravate
His angers flame, till their own eager hate
Though burning with a mortal fury, might
Pass unobserved, since near a greater light.
Amongst those few whose love did not depend
So much on fortune, but the name of friend
Was still preserved, the faithful Cyprian Prince
Durst only strive by reason to convince
Their wilder passions; but each Argument
With which affection strugl'd to prevent
A swift destruction, only seemed to prove
His friendship more effectual then his love.
From which mistake, such as did strive to please
The angry Princes passionate disease
With what might seed the sickly humors, draw
A consequence that proves Pharonnida
A blessing which was to his merits due
Who most opposed the bold aspirer to
That throne of Beauty, which before possessed,
Whole Armies must dispute their interest.
The slighted Cyprian, since their fear could trust
None but confederates, from their Councils thrust
Those swift conclusions, which before to stay
Their violence, had Reason's cool allay
Hurried to action, strict commands are sent
From fierce Zoranza through each Regiment,
Which stooped their Ensigns to his power, that by
Such marches as they would follow victory,
They reach Aetolia ere its new-crown'd King
Warned by report, had liberty to bring
Opposing strengths, (a task too hard to be
Performed with ease in powers minority.)
Nor fails this Council; for their Army draws
No sooner near, but such as in the cause
Of unsuccessful Rebels late had been
Exposed to danger, seek for refuge in
A fresh revolt; and since their ulcerous guilt
Was so malignant, that even mercy spilt
Its balm in vain, their injured Prince forsake,
To strengthen his proud Enemies, who make
Those Poisons up in Cordials, and compound
Them with their Army, which being thus grown sound
Whereas it lately fainted, durst provoke
Unto the trial of another stroke
His late victorious forces; which, though yet
Faint with the blood lost in the last great fit
Of Honors fever, when the Crisis proved
The cures prognostic, had with ease removed
The proud invaders, had Morea bin
As heretofore a hurtful Neuter in
That war; which now, since double strengths oppose
Brave fortitude, like base oppression shows.
So long both parties with variety
Of fortune fought, that fearing whose might be
The sad success, that old Cleander, in
Such speed as if his Crown engaged had bin,
Raises an Army, whose command, since he
Base flattery takes for brave fidelity,
Waving those Peers to whose known faith he owes
The most of trust, in hoodwinked hope, bestows
On false Almanzor, who by power advanced
Near to those hopes at which Ambition glanced
But like weak eyes upon the dazeling sun,
From that last ^atal s^age his plots begun
Mischiefs dark course, which ere concluded shall
Crush the Epirot in Morea's fall.
In this the hot distemper of their state,
A^ind^, whom the Destinies of late
To double-die his Honors purple-thred,
Robbed of a father, most disquieted
Their secret councels, since they knew the love
He bore Argalia, propt with power, might prove
A sad obstruction to their plots, if he
Urged by distastes, shook their confederacy
Off to assist his friend; which to oppose,
With slattery fleeting as the gourd that rose
But to discover his just wrath that made
The plant to cover, when it could not shade,
They all attempt, though he engage not in
Their party, yet his easy youth to win
By honors moths, by times betrayers, soft
And smooth delights, those serpents, which too often
Strangle Herculean virtues: But they here
In Ages April find a wit appear
Of such full growth, that by his judgment they
Are undermined, who studied to betray.
Being thus secured from foreign fears, they now
Employ that rage, whose speed could scarce allow
Advice from Council, to extirpate those
New planted Laurels vict'rie did compose
To crown Argalia. But before they go
To ravish Conquest from so cheap a Foe
Whose valor by orewhelming power was barred
From lying safe at a defensive guard,
Till old Cleander, that their league might be
Assured by bonds whose firm stabilitie
Death only could divorce, intends, though she,
With such aversion as their destiny
Wretches condemned would shun, attempt to fly
The storm of fate; yet countmanded by
His power, the fair Pharonnida, although
He not to love, but duty seemed to owe
For such a blessing, should Zoranza's be
Confirmed by Hymen's high solemnity.
This resolution, whose self ends must blame
Her fathers love, once registered by fame,
Submits to censure; whilst Pharennida
Laments her fate, some prompted by the law
Of love and nature are to entertain
So much of freedom, as they prove in vain
Her advocates: Others, whose cautious fear
Dares only pity, in that dress appear
Silent and sad; only Almanzor in
This State-distemper, by that subtle sin
Dissimulation, so disguises all
His black intentions, that whilst truth did call
Him Treasons agent, its reflected light,
Appearance, spoke him Virtues proselyte;
So much a Convert, as if all those hot
Crimes of his youth ambition had begot,
Discreeter age had either cooled, or by
Repentance changed to zeal and loyalty.
Whilst thus in the Court the most judicious eyes
Deluded were by factions false disguise,
By rumors heavy as the damps of death
When they fly laden with the dying breath
Of new-departed souls, this fatal news
Assaults the Princess, which whilst reason views
With sad resentments, to support her in
This storm of fate, Amindor, who had bin
In all her griefs her best adviser, now
Enters to tell her fainting sorrows how
They Would yet a refuge left, from whom she might
Reap hopes of safety: The first welcome sight
Of such a friend, whose former actions had
^nhanc'd his worth, encountering with her sad
And serious thoughts, so rarifies that cloud
Of grief, that ere dissolving tears allowed
A vocal utterance, as intended words
Something contained too doleful for records:
Both sighed, both wept; at length the Princess broke
Silence, and thus lier dismal passions spoke.
Dare you, my Lord, approach so near unto
A factious grief, in this black storm to view
Distressed Pharonnida? have either I
Or my Argalia's slighted memory
Yet in Morea a remaining friend,
Whose virtue dares by its own strength contend
Against this torrent of Court-factions? Now,
Now, Royal Sir, that doom which will allow
My soul no more refreshing slumbers, by
My father's past, my father (Sir) whom I
Must disobey with all the curses due
To black rebellion, or else prove untrue
Those vows, those often repeated vows, which in
Our Loves full growth has to Argalia bin
Sealed in the sight of heaven. About to speak
Her passions fuller, sorrow here did break
The sad theme off, and to proclaim her fears,
(Except th'oreflowing language of her tears)
No Herald left. In which sad silent fit
The valiant Cyprian, who at first did sit
His passions prisoner, from that bondage free,
To her disease prescribes this remedy.
-- Cease Madam --
Cease to eclipse illustrious beauty by
Untimely tears; your griefs deformity
Frights not Amindor from his friendship, when
I first beheld that Miracle of men
Adored Argalia, pluck from victory
His Naval laurels, Honor told me I
Was then so much his Virtues captive, that
Not all the dangers mortals tremble at
Can make me shun assisting of him in
Retaining you, though my attempts have bin
Employed in vain, in public council, to
Procure your peace, there is something left to do
By which our private plots may undermine
Their public power, and unperceived decline
That danger which, without this secret friend,
It lies not in our fortune to defend.
From griefs cold swoon to living comforts by
This cordial raised, Pharonnida's reply
Owns this pathetick language: If there be
In all the dark paths of my destiny
Yet left a rode to safety, name it, Sir,
What I Will atempt, no danger shall deter,
So brave Amindor be my conduct through
The dismal rode; but my wild hopes outgrow
What ere my reason dictates. No, my Lord,
Fly that sad fate whose progress can afford
Naught but disasters, and live happy in
Orlinda's love; should I attempt to win
You from so fair a virtue, 'twere a wrong
Too full of guilt to let me live among
The number of your friends, amongst whom let m^
In all your future thoughts remembered be
As the most wretched to whom rigid fate
All hopes weak cordials has applied too late.
Here ceased the sorrowing Lady, to suspend
Whose following tears, her charitable friend
Prescribes this comfort: Though my zeal has bin,
When serving you, so unsuccessful in
My first attempts, it gives just cause to doubt
My future actions; yet to lead you out
Of this dark labyrinth where your sorrow stands
Maskt with amazements, not the countermands
Of my affection to Orlinda, though
Confirmed by vows, shall stop; let grief bestow
But so much time (unclouded by your fear)
To look Hopes volumes ore, there will appear
Some lines of comfort yet, which that we may
Not in a heedless horror cast away,
Prepare for speedy action, to prevent
Ensuing ills no time is left unspent
But only this approaching night, by which
To sly from danger you must stoop to enrich
A course disguise, whose humble shadow may
Enquiring eyes to dark mistakes betray.
Our first retreat, which is designed to be
No further then the neighboring Monastrie
Where I of late did lie concealed, I have
Thus made secure: There stands an ancient cave,
Close hid in unfrequented shadows, near
Your gardens postern gate; which when the fear
Of bordering foes denied a free access
To the old Abbey, they from the distress
Of threatening Scouts were safe delivered by
A vault that through it leads; which though so nigh
Unto the city, careless time, since not
Forced to frequent, has wholly left forgot
By busy mortals. In this silent Cell
Where naught but Lights eternal strangers dwell
In the Meridian depth of night, whilst all
Are robbed in rest, you none encounter shall
(Except my self) but him, who may with us
This secret share, esteemed Euriolus;
With whom, and your indear'd Florenza, we
Within the unsuspected Monastrie
Protected by some secret friends may stay
Till fruitless searches waste their hopes away,
Whose watchful spleen by care conducted might
Stop our intentions of a further flight.
Raised from the cold bed of despair, from this
Mature advice to hopes of future bliss,
The heavenly fair Pharonnida had now
Withdrawn the vail of grief, and could allow
Some smiles to wait upon those thanks which she
Returned her friend; who, that no time might be
Lost by neglect from needful action, in
A calm of comforts, such as had not bin
Her late associates, leaves the Princess to
Pursue those plots, which fortune bent t'undo,
Whilst hope on expectations wings did hover,
Did thus by fatal accident discover.
That knot in her fair thread of destiny,
That lurking snake, the Purgatory by
Which heaven refined her, cursed Amphibia, had,
Whilst mutual language all their thoughts unclad,
Close as an unsuspected plague that in
Darkness assaults, an unknown sharer bin
Of this important issue; which with hate
Her genius met, soon strives to propagate
A brood of Fiends: Almanzor, whose dark plots
Like images of damned Magicians rots
Themselves to ruin others, like in this
Last act of ill by too much haste to miss
The rode that led through slippery paths of sin,
From prides stupendous precipice falls in
A gulf of horror, in whose dismal shade
A private room his dark retreat is made.
Here whilst his heart is boiled in gall, his brain
Orewhelm'd in clouds, whose darkness entertain
No beam of reason, whilst ambition mixed
Examples of the bloodiest murders fixed
Upon the brazen front of time, all which
Lends no unfathomed policy to enrich
His near impoverished brain, he hears one knock,
Whose sudden noise soon scattering all the flock
Of busy thoughts, him in a hasty rage
Hurries to the door, where come, his eyes engage
His tongue to welcome one whose cursed advice
His tortured thoughts turned to a Paradise
Of pleasing hopes, on whose foundation he
Prepares to build a future Monarchy.
A slow-consuming grief, whose Chronick stealth
Had slily robbed Palermo's Prince of health,
In spite of all the guards of Art had long
Worn out his strength, and now had grown too strong
For age to bear, each baffled Artist in
A sad despair forsaking what had bin
Tried but t'upbraid their ignorance, except
An aged Friar whose judgment long had slept
From watchful practice. but in the Court of Arts
Been so employed, that the mysterious parts
Of clouded Theoricks, which he courted by
High contemplation, to his minds clear eye
Lay all undrest of that disguise which in
Man's fall t'afflict posterity, they would been
By angry heaven wrapped in; so that he knew
What astral virtues Vegetables drew
From a celestial influence, and by what
Absconded magic Nature fitted that
To working humors, which they either move
By 'xpulsive hate, or by attractive love.
This Arts true master, when his hope was grown
Faint with delays, to the sick Prince made known,
A swift command calls from his still repose
The reverend Sire, who come, does soon disclose
That long concealed malignity which had
The feeble Prince in sickly paleness clad:
Nor stays his Art at weak prognostics, but
Proceeds to practice whatsoere may put
His Prince in ease, Cordials abstracted by
A then near undiscovered chemistry,
Such as in single drops did all comprise
Nature ere taught Art to epitomize;
Such, as if armed with a Promethean fire,
Might force a bloodless carcass to respire;
Such as curbed fate, and in their hot assault
Whilst storming life, made deaths pale army halt.
This rare Elixar by the Prince had bin,
With such success as those that languish in
Consuming ills, could wish themselves, so long
Used, that those fits which else had grown too strong
For nature to contend withal, were now
Grown more remiss; when Fate, that can allow
No lasting comforts, to declare her power
Ore Art it self, arrests that Conqueror
Of others ills, with a disease that led
Him a close prisoner to an uncouth bed;
Which like to prove natures slow chariot to
Th'expecting grave, loath to the public view
To prostitute a secret, yet bound by
The obligation of his loyalty
T'assist his Prince, he to Pharonnida
That sovereign secret, which could only awe
Her fathers threatening pain, declares, which she
Has since composed; when ere's extremity
Suffered those pains, whose progress to prevent,
Sh'ad by Amphibia now the Cordial sent;
The sly Amphibia, who did soon obey
What lent her hate a freedom to betray.
His first salutes being past, with such a speed
As did declare the guilt of such a deed,
Might doubt discovery, she unfolds that strange
Amazing truth, which from the giddy range
Of wild invention soon contracts each thought
Into resolves, such as no object sought
But the destruction of what ere might stop
Ambitions progress; toward the slippery top
Of which now climbing on Conceits stretched wing,
He silent stands, whilst teeming fancy brings
That Monster forth, for whose conception he
Long since deflour'd his virgin-loyaltie.
Few minutes, by that auxiliary aid
Which her discovery lent, his thoughts convaid
Through all the rodes of doubt: which safely past,
Strictly embracing her who in this last
And greatest act of vilany must have
A farther share, he thus begins: Oh save,
Save, thou that art my better genius now,
What thou alone have raised; my hopes must bow
Beneath impossibilities, if not
By thee assisted; Fortune has begot
The means already; let this Cordial be
With poison mixed, Fate knows no enemy
Dares grapple with me; Do not start, there is here
No room for danger, if we banish fear.
His thoughts thus far discovered, finding in
Her various looks, that apprehended sin,
The souls Mercurial pill, did penetrate
Her callous conscience, in whose cell this sat
With knawing horror; whilst all other lives
Whom her fraud spilt, proved hurtless corrosives,
From the cold ague of repentance, he
Thus rouses her: Can my Amphibia be
By fear (that fatal remora to all
That Is great, or good) thus startled? is the fall
Of an old Tyrant grown a subject for
This soft remorse? let thy brave soul abhor
Such sickly passions, when our fortune stands
Fixed on their ruin, the unwilling hands
Of those that now withstand our glorious flight
Will help inthrone us, whilst unquestioned right,
(Which is for power the worlds mistaken word)
Is made our own by the Legislative sword.
Raised from her fears cold trepidations by
These hot ingredients, in an ecstasy
Of flatuous hopes, she casts herself into
This gulf of sin; and being prepared to do
An act, which not the present times could see
With sense enough, whilst in th'extremitie
Of wonder lost, through all his guards strict care
Death to the unsuspecting Prince does bear.
Freed from this doubt, Almanzor to avoid
That storm of rage, which when their Prince destroid
The Courtshould know, might rise from fear, pretends
Haste to the Army; but being gone, suspends
That speedy voyage, and being attended by
A wretch whose guilt assured his privacy,
Through paths untrod hastes to the Cave wherein
Those habits which had by Amindor bin
(Whilst he his beauteous charge did thence convay)
Prepared to cloud illustrious beauty, lay:
Of which, in such whose size did show they were
For the largest sex, they both being clad, with care
Secret as swift, haste to augment the flood
Of swelling sins with yet more royal blood.
The Epirots constant Prince, by custom had
Made known a walk; which when the day unclad
Of glittering tissue, in her evenings lawn
Sat coolly dressed, to court the sober dawn,
He often used, near this Almanzor (by
Hell made successful in his vilany)
Arrived some minutes ere the other, lies
Concealed, till darkness, and a close disguise,
(Those safe protectors) from his unseen seat
Call him to action, where, with thoughts repleat
With too much joy t'admit suspicion, he
Finds the Messenian, whom no fear to be
Assaulted there had armed, his spacious train
Shrunk into one that served to entertain
Time with discourse: Upon which heedless pair
The armed Almanzor rushing unaware,
Ere strength had time their valor to obey
In storms of wounds their senses lose the way
T'external objects; in which giddy trance
The other Lord, whose spirits readvance
To life, they fear not, lies secure, whilst by
Redoubled wounds his Princes spirits fly
From the most strong retreats of life, which now
Battered by death, no safety could allow.
Revenges thirst being in this royal flood
Quenched for a while, that from the guiltless blood
His Honor might not yet a stain receive
First hasting to the cave, he there does leave
Those injured habits, which by him were meant
For the betrayers of the innocent.
This done, that he even from suspicion might
Secure his guilt, before the wasted night
Looks pale at the approach of day, he flies
To the distant Army, there securely lies,
Till all those black productions of his brain
Now ripening to perfection should attain
Maturity, and in the Court appear
In their most horrid dress, knowing the fear
Of the distracted City soon would call
Him, and his Army, to preve^t the fall
Of such distracting dangers as might be
Attendants on th'eclipse of Majesty.
The End of the Third Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO IV.
The Argument.
I.
Now, as if that great Engineer of ill,
Accursed Almanzor, had accomplished all
Those black designs, which are ordaia'd to fill
The Spartan Annals, by his Princes fall:
II.
With secret spite, yet such as seemed to be
From an advised Protector of the State,
Pharonnida's ill fate assisting, he
Toward her destruction prosecutes his hate.
THat dismal Night which in the dark records
Of story, yet so much of fate affords
In the Morean Annals, had to Day
Resigned its reign, whose Eastern beams display
Their morning-beauties, by whose welcome light
The early Courtier, tired with tedious night,
Rises to meet expected triumphs, in
Their Princes nuptials, which so long had bin
The joyful business of their thoughts, that now
Sallying to action, they are instructed how
To court observance from the studied pain
Of best inventions, by attractive gain
Joined to the itch of ostentative art,
Were thither drawn from each adjacent part.
In this swelled torrent of expected mirth
Which all conclude must make this morning birth
To future Ages celebrated by
An annual triumph, the disparity
Of passion (sorrow) first breaks forth among
The slain Epirot's followers, who so long
Had mist their master, that they now begin
To doubt his safety, every place had bin
By strict enquiry searched, to which they knew
Either affection or employment drew
His frequent visits; but with an effect
So vain, their care served only to detect
Their love, not him its object, who might have
Lain till corruption sought it self a grave,
Had not an early Forrester, so near
The place approached, that maugre all that fear
Alleag'd to stop a full discovery, he
Beheld so much as taught him how to free
His friends from further fruitless searches, in
Discovering what beneath their fears had bin.
In sorrow, such as left no power to vent
Its symptoms, but a deep astonishment
Th'amaz'd Messenians, whom a sad belief
Deprived of hope, did entertain their grief,
Whose swift infection to communicate
Their murdered Prince, as if pale death kept state
Clad in the crimson robes of blood, is to
The City brought, where whilst the public view
In busy murmurs spread her sable wings,
Pale terror to the Court, griefs center, brings
The dreadful truth, which some officious Lord
Whom favor did the privilege afford
Of easy entrance, through the guards of fear,
In haste conveys t'assault the Princes ear.
With such a silence as did seem to show
Unwelcom news is in its entrance slow,
Entered the room, he is with soft pace unto
The bed approached, whose curtains when withdrew
Discovered horror in the dismal dress
Of death appears; freed from the slow distress
Of Age (that coward tyrant) which never shows
His strength till man wants vigor to oppose
Through deaths dark gates fled to the gloomy shade,
Whose fear, or hope, not knowledge does invade
Our fancies yet, he man's material part
There only sees; which form, whose heavenly art
Tunes motion into'th faculties of life,
Had now forsook the elemental strife
Which had so long at concord aimed, was now
Silenced in death, on his majestic brow
No awefull frown did sit, the bloods retreat
From life and action left his cheeks the seat
Of deaths cold guest, which summoned by his fate
There in a pale and ghastly horror sat.
Whilst the astonished Courtier did behold
This with such trembling, as when graves unfold,
Their Doom-dayes curtains, sinful bodies shall
Rise from their urns, eternally to fall;
His stay, caused from restrictive fear, had drew
In more Spectators, to whose wandering view
This ghastly object when opposed had struck
So swift a tertor, that their fears forsook
The safe retreats of Reason, seeing life
Had now concluded all the busy strife
Of natures conflicts by delivering those
Time-shaken Forts unto more powerful foes,
Outcries in vain attempts for pity to
Scale heaven, whose ear, when from their prayers withdrew
The Court (now of her royal head bereft)
In a still calm of hopeless sorrow left.
Infectious grief, disdaining now to be
Confined within the brief Stenographie
Of first Discoverers, spreads it self among
The City herd, whose rude unsteddy throng
Raised grief (which in the mourning Court did dwell
In such a silence as an Anch'rites Cell
Never knew a heavier solitude) into
Exalted outcries whose loud call had drew
From their neglected arts so many, that
What first was choler, now being kindled at
Their rage, like humors grown adust had bin
The open breach to let rebellion in;
Had not the wiser Nobles, which did know
That vulgar passions will to tumult grow
When backed with power, by a new modeled form
Of counsel soon allayed this rising storm.
Their tears (those fruitless sacrifices to
Unactive grief, wiped off whilst they did view
The States distemp'red body, to supply
The wants of that departed Majesty,
Which when their Prince from Life's horizon fell
Fled from their view, before report should tell
This fatal story to the Princess, they
A Council call, by whose advice she may
Whilst floating in this Sea of sorrow be
Saved from those unseen rocks, where treachery
Rebellions subtle Engineer might sit
To wrack the weakness of a female wit;
Which, though in her such that it might have bin
The whole worlds Pilate, could, since clouded in
Such a tempestuous Sea of passions, see
No Star that might her safe director be.
A Messenger whose sad observant wit
By age allayed seemed a conveyer fit
For such important business, with the news
Hasts toward the Princess, whom whilst fear persues
On wings of pity, being arrived within
The Palace, he, as that alone had bin
The only feat where rigid sorrow took
Her fixed abode, beholds each servants look
Obscured with grief, through whose dark-shades whilst he
Searches the cause, the strange variety
Explains it self, as families that have
Led their protecting Ruler to the grave,
whose loss they in a heedless sorrow mourn
So long, till care does to distraction turn:
Her servants sat each wildly looking on
The other, till even sense it self was gone
In mourning wonder, whose wild flight to stay
Its cause, they to the pitying Lord display
In such a tone, as whilst it did detect
The Princess absence, showed their own neglect.
When this he'ad heard, with such a sympathy
Of sorrow as erected grief to be
The mourning Monarch of his thoughts, to those
Returned that sent him, he that transcript shows
Of this obscure original, the flight
OF the absent Princess, whilst the veil of night
Obscured her passage, tells: but questioned how,
With whom, or whether knowledge did allow
No satisfaction, all inquiry gained
From her amazed attendants but explained
Their grief, whose troubled rivolet flowed in
To that vast Ocean where before they would bin
By sorrow shipwrack'd in the general flood
Mixed, wants a language to be understood
In a peculiar character, and so
Conjoined makes up one universal woe.
Only, as if love knew alone the art
That taught his followers how to mourn apart,
Sad, sweet Orlinda, whose calm innocence
Had fostred passion at her healths expense,
Whilst wet with grief's oreflowing springs, she to
Her brothers ghost did pay soft natures due
In sorrow of such sad complexion, that
Others might lose their own to wonder at;
Yet when (as in the margint placed) she hears
Amindor lost, with new supplies of tears
Grief sallying forth, as if to be betrayed
Love now did fear, he draws the bashful Maid
From those that did the mourning consort keep
Where she unseen for loves decease does weep,
Frail woman's faith, and man's neglect does blame,
And softly then sighs out Amindors name;
Her lost Amindor, whose supposed disdain
Destroyed those spirits grief could never have slain.
And now before that powers decay engage
To many hands in a vindictive rage
The wise supporters of the State to stay
Increasing factions (which can never obey
Lest fear commands) unto Almanzor send
A mandate which injoyns him to attend
Their Councels in this interregnum, till
Their joint consent had found out one to fill
The empty throne: which summons prompted by
A care which they interpret loyalty,
Though truly called ambition, he obeyed
With such a speed as Love would fly to aid
A ravished Lady, having to impede
His march no more then what his care could lead
Even with a singes speed, yet that a strength
Enough to make his will confine the length
Of their desires, who soon in Council sit
But to bewail the abortion of their wit.
The frighted City having entered in
A mourning march, as if his thoughts had bin
A stranger to the sad events of this
So dismal night, he by relation is
Informed of each particular, which he
Seeming to hear in griefs extremity,
From silent sorrow which appeared to wait
On still attention, his prepared deceit
Disguised in rage appears, a rage which in
Its active flight to find what hearts had bin
Defiled with thoughts of such foul crimes, did seem
So full of zeal, its actions did redeem
The lost report of loyalty in those
His former crimes made his most constant foes.
By guarded gates, and watchful parties that
Surround the walls, till the people frighted at
Their fury, shrink from public throngs, they now
Assured of safety, whilst enquiring how
Hell hatched these monsters, whose original
Whilst searching, they by the consent of all
His best Physicians, whose experienced skill
From outward signs, knew what internal ill
Death struck the Prince, informed the cause could be
From naught but such a subtle enemy
As poison, which when every accident
They had examined, all conclude was sent
Mixed with that cordial whose concealed receipt
Unknown to art, their envy termed the bait
To tempt the easy Princes faith into
That net which death allured by treason, drew.
With power from this embraced suspicion sprung
Almanzor, who not envies spotted tongue
Durst call profane, though rudely forcing those
Weak gates, which need no greater strength to oppose
Unclean intruders, then the reverence they,
Enforced by zeal, did with Religion pay
Unto that places sanctity, which he
Contemning, ere the wronged society
Expecting such injurious visits, in
Rude fury entering, those whose power had bin
Employed by noble pity to attend
The suffering Princess, in such haste did send
Them to her close and dark abodes, that now
Their doubts confirm'st, they are only studying how
To shun that danger which informing fear
Falsely persuades, toward them alone drew near.
Which dark suspicion, ere unclouded, by
Seizing on him whose innocence durst fly
To no retreat, the Royal fugitives
Back to the vault where first they entered, drives.
Now at the great'st antipathie to Day
The silent earth oppressed with Midnight lay
Vested in clouds, black as they had been sent
To be the whole worlds mourning monument;
When through the Caves damp womb, conducted by
A doubtful light that scarce informed the eye
To find out those unhaunted paths, they in
A faint assurance, with soft pace begin
To sally forth, where unsuspected, they
Are seized by guards that in close ambush lay:
Which ere amazement could give action leave
To seek for safety, did their hopes deceive
By close restraint, awed by whose power, they are to
Almanzor brought, who from that object drew
Such joy as fills usurpers when they see
Wronged Princes struggling with captivity.
From hence in such disdainful silence led
As taught their fear, from just suspicion bred,
To tremble at some unknown ill, about
That sober time when Lights small lamps go out
At the approach of Days bright glories, brought
Back to the Court, they there not long had sought
Their sorrows sad original, before
A Court convened of such whose power had bore
Whilst (Gods own choice) a Monastry, had lent
Their dictates law, the weight of government,
They hither called by summons that did sound
Like bold rebellion, in sad omen found
More then they feared; A mourning train of Lords
Placed round a black tribunal, that affords
To the spectators penetrated eye
A dismal horror clothed in majesty.
Like hierogliphicks pointing to that fate
Which must ensue, all yet in silence sat
A dreadful silence, such as unto weak
Beholders seemed to threaten when they speak,
Death and destruction dictates, when they saw
Their Princess entered, as if rigid Law
To loyal duty let the scepter fall
In an obedient reverence raised, they all
Lowly salute her, but that complement
To bribe their pity, fear in vain had spent;
When all resuming now their seats, command
The Royal captives, whose just cause did stand
On no defense but unknown truth to be
Summoned to the bar, where that they first might see
What rigor on the royal blood was shown,
From no unjust conspiracy had grown,
A sable curtain from their herses drawn
Betrays her eyes then in the sickly dawn
Of grief grown dim, unto that horrid place
Where they met death drawn in her fathers face,
By whom now turned into well-model'd clay,
Fitted for's tomb the slain Epirot lay.
At this, as if some over-venturous look
For temperate rays, destructive fire had took
In at her souls receiving portals, all
Life's functions ceased, sorrow at once lets fall
The burden of so many griefs, which in
A death-like slumber had forgotten bin
Till humane thoughts obliterated by
The wish^ conversions of eternity
Oppressed no more, had not in^urious haste
Before this conflict could those spirits waste
Which had, to shun passions external strife,
Fled to the primum mobile of life,
Recalled with them her sorrows to attend
Their nimblest motions, which too fast did spend
Her strength, to suffer weakness to obey
The Courts intentions of a longer stay.
From ruffl'd passions which her soul oppressed,
By the soft hand of recollecting rest
Strok'd to a calm, which settled reason in
Her troubled throne; by those that first had bin
Her guards, the Princess (that fair pattern, whence
Men drew the height of humane excellence)
Is now returned, to let her proud foes see
That the bright rays of magnanimity
Though envy like the ungrateful moon do strive
To hide that sun, except what is relative
Never knows eclipse, the darkness taking birth
From what is below, whilst that removed from earth,
Her clear unclouded conscience ever stays
Amongst bright virtues universal rays.
The mourning Court (those ministers of fate)
In expectation of their prisoners sat,
They now appear in those disguises which
They first were took, being habits, though not rich
Enough to gild their rare perfections, yet
Such as did seem by sorrow made to fit
Their present sufferings; both the men clothed in
Monastic robes, black as their threads had bin
Spun from Peruvian wool; the women clad
Like mournful Votaries, showed so sweetly sad,
As if their virtues which injurious fate
Did yet conceal, striving to anticipate
The flights of time, had to the external sense
Showed these as emblems of their innocence.
But love, nor pity, though they both did here
Within their Judges sternest looks appear,
Durst plead for favor; their indictments read
So guilty sound, that those whose hearts even bled,
Disdained their eyes should weep, since justice did
In such foul crimes mercy as sin forbid.
Yet more to clear what circumstance had made
Level with reason, from the approaching shade
Of death redeemed, that Lord whose wounds had bin
But slumbers to recover safety in
When the Messenian murdered was, did now
Declare as far as reason could allow
The eyes to judge, those habits which they then
Did wear the same which clothed the murth'rers when
His Prince was slain; which open proof appears
So full of guilt it stops her friends kind fears
Ere raised to hope, and in appearance shows
A guilt, which all but pity overgrows.
The vexed Epirots who for comfort saw
Revenge appearing in the form of Law
Retired, to feed their spleen with hope until
The extent of Justice should their vengeance fill;
When now by accusations that denide
Access to pity, for a Paracide
The Princess questioned, whose too-weak defense
Being but the unseen guards of innocence,
Submits to censure; yet to show that all
Those scattered pearls, which from her eyes did fall
Dropped not to attempt their charity, but show
That no injurious storm could overslow
Her world of Reason, which exalted stood
Above the surface of the spacious stood,
Her tears for grief, not guilt, being shed, whilst in
The robes of magnaminity, not sin
Grown impudent, her brave resolved soul sat
Unshaken in this Hyrocane of sat.
To meet her calm (which like religion dressed
Does all become, but female virtues best)
The rough Amindor, whose discolored face
Anger did more then native beauty grace,
Since justly raised, disdaining thus to be
By a Plebian base captivity
Forced to submit his innocence unto
Their doubtful test, had from his anger drew
A ruin swifter then their hate intends,
Had not his rage, whilst it toward danger bends,
Been taught by her example to exclude
Vain passions with a Princely fortitude,
Whose useful aid (like those good works which we
For comforts call in deaths necessity)
Brought all their better Angels to defend
Them from those terrors which did death attend.
In busy whispers, which discovered by
Their doubtful looks the thoughts variety,
Long in sad silence sat the Court, until
Those noiseless streams of fancy which did fill
Each several breast united by consent
Want only now a tongue so impudent
As durst condemn their Sovereign, which being in
Theumantius found, a Lord whose youth had been
By favor nursed, till power's wild beast grown rude
Repays his Fost'rer with ingratitude.
This bold, bad man, Loves most unhappy choice,
From flatteries Treble now exalts his voice
Without the mean of an excuse, into
The Laws loud Base; and what those feared to do
That had been favored less, that black dec^ee
Pronounced, which discords all the harmony
Of subject fear, and sovereign love, by what
Succeeding ages justly trembled at
Whilst innocent, but have of late been grown
So bad to show such monsters of their own.
This sentence past, which knew no more allay
Of mercy, then what lets their judgments stay
From following life to deaths obscure retreat,
Till twenty nights had made their days complete,
The Court breaks up; yet ere from public v^ew
To close restraint the Royal captives drew,
Grant them this favor from their rigid laws,
That if there durst, to vindicate their cause,
In that contracted span of time appear
Any whose forward valor durst indear
The peoples love and prayers, so much to be
Their Champion, that his victory should free
Them from that dooms strict rigor; to oppose
Which brave Attempter, they Almanzor chose
(Since high command that honor did afford
To him alone) to weild the answering sword.
Now near departing, whilst the Cyprian in
A brave disdain, which for submissive sin
Looks on an answer, as his haste would show
An anger that did scorn to stoop so low
To strike with threats, stands silent, whilst that she
Whose temper heaven had made too calm to be
By rage transported, with a soul unmoved
By stormy passions, thus their sin reproved.
Should I (my Lords) here with a female haste
Discharge my passions, 'twere (perhaps) to waste
My prayers, or threats, whilst one you would not fear,
Nor the other pity: But when heaven shall clear
This curtain'd truth, wrapped in whose cloudy night,
Unjustly you, from my unquestioned right
By birth, obedience, into faction stray,
Then (though too late) untimely sorrow may
Strive by repentance to expunge these stains
Cast on your honor. These exhausted vains,
Fixed eyes, pale cheeks, deaths dismal trophies, in
This royal face I now could not have seen
With a less sorrow then had served to call
Me to attend him, had not the rude fall
Of your unjustice, like those dangerous cures
Performed by tutning into Calentures
Dull Lethargies, upon my heart laid hold
In such a flame of passion, as the cold
Approach of death wants power to quench until
You add that crime to this preceding ill.
Yet (though no fear can prompt my scorn to crave
A subjects mercy for my self) to save
This Noble Stranger, whose just acts being crossed
By misconstruction, have their titles lost,
I shall become your suppliant, lest there be
A sin contracted by his serving me;
And only in such noble ways as might
Unveil themselves to the suns Meridian light;
Sure he unjustly suffers, which may cause
You want more swords to vindicate your Laws
Then his you late elected to make good
Your votes, ere scarce cleans'd of that loyal blood
He in rebellion shed; but I am now
Too near my fatal period to allow
Disturbing passion any place within
My peaceful soul: what ere his crimes have been
In public war, or private treason, may
Kind Heaven, when with the injustice of this day
Those shall be strictly questioned, to prevent
Their doom, conceal them in the large extent
Of mercies wings, which there may prove so kind
To you, though here I can no justice find.
This spoken in a garb that did detect
A sorrow which was ripened to neglect,
She silent stands, whilst through the thick resort
Of thronged Spectators, toward the rising Court
Orlinda comes, with such a haste as showed
That service she by Love's allegiance owed;
Love, which had sorrows sable wings out-fled
To mourn the living, not lament the dead;
Come where her fears (now near lost) object she
Within the shadow of the Grave might see
By sentence shut, neglecting death that lay
In ambush there her reason to betray
To hate, when by the false informing Law,
Her Friend she as her brother's murderer saw
In actions such as Scythian Tyrants feel
Some softness from, she that never used to kneel
Too ought but heaven, a lowly suppliant falls
Before the Court, from whose stern breasts she calls
So much of sorrow as perhaps had struck
Them all with horror, if a sudden look
Obliquely on her murdered brother cast,
Had not ere Love assaulted with her last
And powerfull'st prayers, whilst hot with action in
A cool retreat of spirits, silenced bin.
She fainting fallen, as an addition to
Their former grief, is from the throng withdrew
Into the free untainted air, where by
Assisting Friends which gently did apply
Their needful aid, heat, which was then grown slack
In Natures work, antipathy calls back
To beauties frontiers, where like bashful light
It in a blush meets the Spectators sight
But such a one, as ere full blown is by
Her Friends disasters forced again to fly
Beneath those clouds of grief, whose swelling pride
Spread by report, did now not only hide
The Court or City, but to bear a part
Of that sad load, summons each Subjects heart.
Whilst now the Prisoners, ere the peoples love
To anger turn, the active Guards remove
To still the clamorous multitude, who swayed
By various passions, did whilst each obeyed
Opinions dictates, but in darkness rove
At shadowed truth, whence now they boldly strove
To pluck the vail from Declarations that
Contained those falsehoods, which whilst wondering at
They wept to force upon their faith, are sent
Through the Lands each Town, and Armies Regiment;
By which Almanzor, who attempted in
This plot to join security with sin,
Doubting if ere this story reach his ear,
Argalia might their combatant appear,
Besides those stains which common fame did take
For sins just debts, sliely attempts to shake
The heaven-erected fabric of his love
By closer engines, such as seemed to move
On noble pity, which with grief ingrost
That faith which envy in disdain had lost.
Black rumor, on the wings of raised report
Flying in haste, had soon attained the Court
Of the amazed Aetolian Prince, who hears
The dreadful story with such doubtful fears
As shook his noble soul, but not into
An easy faith, each circumstance was true,
He knew Almanzor's vilany to be
Of that extent so foul a progeny,
As all those horrid murders might from thence
Take easy birth: but when the innocence
Of's virtuous Princess, and his honored Friend
The noble Cyprian Prince, come to contend
With often confirmed report, that strikes a deep
And solemn grief, yet such as must not keep
A firm possession in his soul, until
A further inquisition either kill
His yet unfainting hopes, or raise them to
Joy by confirming those reports untrue.
The End of the Fourth Canto.
PHARONNIDA. The Fifth Book. CANTO V.
The Argument.
I.
Through royal blood to level that dark way
Which Rebels pass unto the injured throne,
Pharonnida is now condemned to pay
A debt for crimes that none durst call her own.
II.
When near the last step, brave Argalia, who
In close disguise truths secrets had betrayed,
When most did doubt 'twas now too late to sue
To heaven for pity, brings a timely aid.
IF on those vanished Heroes that are fled
Through the unknown dark Chasma's of the dead,
To rest in regions so remote from hence
Twixt them and life there is no intelligence,
When ere thou look through times dim optiques, then
Brave emulation of those braver men,
Rouses (that ray of heaven) thy soul to be
A sharer in their fames eternity;
Thou'st then a genius fit to entertain
A Muses flight, which may be raised again
To sing thy actions, when there is left no more
Of thee, but what by life, whilst passing ore
Natures short stage, had either scattered bin
By careless youth, or firmly planted in
Maturer age, whose wasted talent spent,
(Those were his Friends, this is his monument)
Is all, except some Muse thy life records,
That to thy worth, the unthankful world affords.
But if thy uninspired soul do bear
A lower sail, which flagging with the care
Of humid pleasures, never is swelled into
Sublimer thoughts, then such as only view
Earth for its object, which never yet did lend
Her favorites more then what they here do spend
TO improve her barren wants, may none rehearse
Thy name (beneath the dignity of verse)
But trivial flatterers, such as strive to gain
Thy favor from Ephemera's of the brain
Unsalted jests, pleased at whose painted fire
I leave fond thee in vapor to expire,
Whilst from thy living shadow I return
To crown the dust in brave Argalia's urn.
From common fame (that wild impostor) he
Had often heard what Love denied should be
For truth admitted, his Pharonnida
Accused for sins which envy strove to draw
Objects for heavens severest wrath, and now
Ere his considerate judgment would allow
Report for real, secret Messengers
To Corinth sends, who ill informed, transfers
His further trouble, in confirming what
Whilst others wept for, he transported at
So sad a change in her whose virtue had
Inflamed his thoughts, by passion near unclad
His soul of all his robes of ^lesh, which now
So loosely hung, as if she practiced how
To strip her self, should unexpected death
To heavens hard course, call forth the nimble breath.
Could earth here conquer, or had it within
The power of whatsoever is mortal bin
TO have wrought disorders of amazement where
The noble soul such true consent did bear
With the harmonious Angels, he in all
His acts like them appears, or (ere his fall)
Perhaps like man, that he could only be
Distinguished from some hollowed hierarchy,
By being clothed in the specific vail
Of flesh and blood, this grief might then prevail
Over his perfect temper; but he bears
These weights, as if unfelt, on his soul wears
The sable robes of sorrow, whilst his cheek
Is dressed in scarle^ smiles; no frown his sleek
And eaven front contract, like to a slow
And quiet stream his obscured thoughts did flow
With greater depths then could be fathomed by
The beamy lines of a judicious eye.
Whilst those good Angels which fond men call wit,
Reformed by age, did all in Council sit,
To steer those thoughts by which he did attend
Pharonnida's escape, they to this end
At length reduced his Councils, that he must
To succor her leave grovelling in the dust
His Kingdom, which being by domestic strife
Late wounded, was but newly rubbed to life:
Yet since that there to her redemption lay
In all the progress of his thoughts no way
Less full of danger, such of's Lords as he
Honored for age, and praised for loyalty,
Called to a secret Council, he discovers
His fixed resolves, which they, though now no Lovers,
With such consenting souls did hear, that though
They knew his danger might even fear outgrow,
They to oppose that scourge of cowards brings
His vows, his sacred vows, those sceptered Kings
Which justly rule the conscience, that awed by
Usurping fear submits to Tyranny.
Their first proposals, whence their judgment sought
To hide his absence, to conclusion brought,
They thence proceed to level him a way
Through that thick swarm of Enemies that lay
Circling the walls, where reason stays a while
In various censure, ere 't could reconcile
Their differing judgments, but at length in this
(As that which in this dangers dark abiss
Seems to lend fear most of the helpful light
Of hope) concludes, that when succeeding night
With strength of age was grown so gravely staid,
That dark designs feared not to be betrayed
By the wanton twilight, he in close disguise,
Whilst some of's troops diverted by surprise
His watchful foes, might pass their guards, which don,
Their care might be, with his surther march begun.
In dismal darkness, that black throne of fear,
Nights silent Empress, awed the Hemisphear;
When now Argalia's ready troops, with slow
And noiseless marches issued through their low
Close Salliports, are swiftly rallied by
Such as had long taught valor how to die
For honors rescue; Captains that had bin
From youth's first bud, till age was reverenced in
Her honored scars, such strict disciples to
Wars hardest precepts, that their fame out-grew
Their power, which that had so authentic made
Where fear was scorned, they were for love obay'd*
By these brave Hero's, which had often led
Armies to sleep in honors purple bed,
The Prince assisted, was with secret haste,
By ways where fear no Sentinel had placed,
Drawn near the Leagure, which the alarm took
From a stormed Fort, had with such speed forsook
Their huts, that haste which was intended to
Preserve, being now to wild confusion grew,
Helps to destroy: In undistinguished sounds,
Which not inform, but frighted sense confounds
With wild amazement, the unnoted words
Even of command are lost; no ear affords
Room for advice, nor the most serious eye
A place for order; Ensigns vainly fly
Since unperceived through the dark air, which in
A storm never knew more tumult then had bin
Since first their fear on this alarm fled
From Reason, through the troubled Leaguer spread.
In this loud horror, whilst they need no lamp
To guide them more then their own flaming Camp,
His frighted foes (fled from their quarter) lend
The Prince some hope this sudden charge might end
Their slow-paced siege; yet since approaching day
Persuading haste, denies his longer stay,
The power to those Commanders left, which he
For valor knew might force from victory
Unwilling laurels, though their judgment such,
Those hallowed wreaths they never durst rashly touch'
He leaves (when first his sword, which none did spare
Within its reach, had of his being there
Left bloody marks) the conquered foes, to find
Out sterner foes in his afflicted mind,
Which since usurping doubt with peaceful love
For empire strove, taught passion how to move
In spheres so differing from his reasons right
Ascension, that his cares protracted night
From this oblique position caused, had made
His sorrow tedious, as those nights which shade
Cold Artick regions, when the absent sun
Does underneath th'Antartick tropic run.
This passage forced through his obstructive foes,
That now the treacherous day might not disclose
Him whilst unguarded, to their view that might
In larger troops pursue a baser flight
Through deep dark paths, which never to th'sun had shown
Their uncouth shades, being to all unknown
Save neighboring rurals, he conducted by
A faithful guide, directs his liberty
Toward stately Corinth, near whose confines ere
Six morning dews had cooled the hemisphere,
Arrived in safety, that kind heaven might bless
His future actions with desired success
To seek to them, he first sought those, that in
The wane of's blood had life's supporters bin,
Those holy Hermites to whose art he owed
For life, next heaven which first that gift bestowed.
Come to their quiet Cell, where all receive
Him with a wonder that did hardly leave
A room for welcome, till their fear had in
A full relation of his fortune bin
Changed for as much of sanguine mirth as they
Could know, that had Religions cool allay
To check delight, he being retired with him
Whose first discoveries in his fortunes dim
Imperfect light directed him to know
His royal offspring, lets his language flow
With so much freedom as discovers what,
Whilst he by active war was aiming at
His Kingdoms safety, called him thence to save
Sweet virtue from an ignominious grave.
The fatal story heard by him, whose love
Fixed by religion, passion could not move,
Although he pitied all the afflicted, to
More softness then what had its offspring drew
From heavens strict precepts which are then misspent
When easy man mistakes the innocent:
Since what permits hypocrisy to win
Remorse, by mercy does but cherish sin.
Which to avoid, ere his consent approve
Of the design, neglecting all which Love
Prompted by pity could allege to draw
Him to the combat, though he in it saw
Naught to defend but innocence, since in
That shape deluded, charity has bin
Too often deceived, that his victorious sword
Might not but where fair justice could afford
Vict'rie be drawn, he, like a Pharos placed
Amongst rocks of doubt, thus rectifies his haste.
Take heed, brave Prince, that in this doubtful way
'Twixt love and honor thy bright virtues stray
Not from Religions latitude, into
More dangerous stations, Reasons slender clew
Is here too short to guide thee, and may in
Its conduct but obliquely lead to sin.
Be cautious then, and rashly venture not
On unknown depths, where valor seems begot
By vain presumption: Mortal beauty, that
Imperfect type of heaven, though wondered at,
Yet may not be so much adored to make
Our passions heavens directing road mistake.
Though thy affections were legitimate
As man's first choice, since in that happy state
Of innocence frail woman then found out
A way to fall, still let thy reason doubt
The same deceit, since that affected she
Which thou ador'st, yet wears mortality;
A garment which since man first wore, has bin
But once cast off without some spots of sin.
Yet know, my council strives not to prevent
Thy swords assisting of the innocent;
As much of mercy on neglect being spilt,
As there is got vengeance from presumptuous guilt
Only before thy valor dares to tread
This rubick path, whose slippery steps have led
So often to ruin, let Religion be
Thy prompter unto so much policy,
As may secure thy conscience; which to do,
Claim my assistance as thy virtues due.
The grateful Prince with lowly looks had paid
His thankful offerings, when, that promised aid
Might not fall short of expectation, he
Whose words (like vows that hold affinity
With heaven) breathed naught but constant truth, did thus
Proceed toward action; whilst (loved Prince) with us
Of this poor Covent, you, by wounds restrained
From action lived, you know that what is contained
In our calm doctrine, gives us leave to be
So intimate with each society,
No secret, though maskt in the clouds of sin,
Flies those discoveries which informs us in
Their last confessions; by which means you may
Know whether justice calls your sword to pay
These bloody offerings as a victim to
Th'appeasing of an inward virtue due.
By this advice instructed to convince
What love suggests, the apprehensive Prince,
Since this includes nothing but what is too just
To disobey, although he all mistrust
Of her like sin avoids, consents to be
Ruled by his Council, whose assistance he
So often successful found; which, that delay
(That slow-paced sin) might not obstruct the way
With times too often neglected loss, he now
So fast toward action hastes, they could allow
The night scarce time to steal a dark retreat,
Ere having left that melancholy seat,
Devotions dark retiring place, he goes
To see how much her frowns did discompose
That Cities dress, of whom he would never a sight
Before, but when 'twas polished with delight.
His Arms (bright Honors burnisht robes) into
Such weeds as showed him to the public view
A course Monastic, changed, attended by
His aged friend, soon as the mornings eye
Adorned the East, the prosperous Prince begun
His pious journey, which, before the sun
Blushed in the West, found a successful end
In clouded Corinth, where arrived, they spend
The hours of the succeeding night to find
How, in that factious troubled sea, inclined
The City stood, whose shallow sons dare vent
By nothing but their tongues, that discontent
Their hands might cure, were not those useful parts
Restrained from action by unmanly hearts,
Which being at once with grief and fear oppressed,
Durst do no more but pity the distressed;
Which gentle passion, since so general, lends
Some light of hope to her enquiring friends.
To usher in that dismal day, whose light
Designed to lead into eternal night
As much of beauty as did ere give place
To death, the morning shows her gloomy face
Wrapped up in clouds, whose heavy vapors had
Hung heaven in black, when, to perform the sad
And serious office of ^onfessors to
Those royal sufferers, whom harsh fates pursue
To deaths dark confines, through their guard of foes
Argalia and his grave assistant goes;
Where he whose love to neither did surmount
His zeal, to take the Cyprians last account
Himself addressed, whilst his kind passions lead
Argalia from Pharonnida, to read
Her life's last story, made authentic by
The near approach of her eternity.
Entered the room, which to his startled ^ight
Appeared like sorrow sepulcher'd in night,
So dismal sad, so silent, that the cold
Retreat of death, the grave, did never unfold
A heavier object, by a sickly light
Which was even then to the artificial night
That filled the room resigning'ts reign, he saw
Griefs fairest draught, divine Pharonnida,
Amidst her tears, fallen like a full-blown flower,
Whose polisht leaves oreburthen'd with a shower,
Drops from their beauties in the pride of day'
To deck the earth, so sadly pining lay
The pensive Princess, whom an ecstasy
O^ passion led to practice how to die
In such abstracted contemplations, that
Angels forsook their thrones to wonder at.
Wet with those tears, in whose Elixar she
Was bathing of the Lilies nurserie,
Her bloodless cheeks; her trembling hand sustan'd
A book, which what heavens mercy has ordained
For a support to humane frailty in
Storms of affliction, lay; which, as she would bin
Now so well in repentant lectures read,
That faith was on the wings of knowledge fled
To meditation, her unactive grief
Lets softly fall, whilst Time, wise natures thief,
That all might look like sorrows swarthy night,
Is stealing forth of the neglected Light;
Whose sullen flame, as it would sympathize
With those quenched beams that once adorned her eyes
After a feeble blaze that spoke its strife
But vain, in silence weeps away its life.
Come to behold this beauteous monument
Of mourning passion, his great spirits spent
On love and wonder, the astonished Prince
Here silent stands, valor could not convince
His wild amazement: To behold her lie
By rigid laws restrained from liberty,
To whom his soul was captive, troubles all
His reasons guards: But when, how she must fall
From beauteous youth, and virtuous life, to be
One of the graves obscure society,
Must fall no Martyr, whose lamented death
Grows pities object, but depart with breath
Amongst ignominious clouds of guilt, that must
Stick an eternal odium on her dust;
That thought transports him from his temper to
Passions, in which he had forgot to do
His Priestly office, and, in rage as high
As ever yet inflamed humanity,
Sent him to actions, whose attempt had bin
The rode his valor must have perished in,
Had not her sorrows agony forsook
The Princess, by whose first unsteady look
He, being as far as his disguise gave leave,
Discovered, is invited to receive
Those last confessions, in whose freedom she
Seeks by absolving comforts how to free
Her soul of all which a religious fear
Like spots on her white conscience made appear.
Having from her unburthen'd soul learnt how
To ease his own, the Priestly Prince had now
As far as bold humanity durst dive
Into remission, heavens prerogative,
Pronounced that pardon for whose seal there stood
The sin-polluted worlds redeeming blood:
By which blessed voice raised from what did appear
Like sorrow, till her faith had banished fear,
The Princess in such gentle calms of joy
As souls that wear their bodies but to cloy
Celestial ^lights can feel, to entertain
Her fatal doom with a resolved disdain
Of death prepares, whilst he whom heaven to her
Had made their mercies happy Messenger,
Forsaking her, repairs to him that had
With the same hand the Cyprians thoughts unclad:
By whom informed, how that in their defense
His sword protected naught but innocence,
Armed with those blessings which so just a cause
Proclaimed his due, he secretly withdraws
To change those emblems of Religious peace,
Monastic robes, for such as might increase
Their joy and wonder, whose contracted fear
Despaired to see a Combatant appear,
Although they knew his sword defended then
The best of causes against the worst of men.
Whilst he prepares with near as much of speed
As incorporeal substances that need
But will for motion, to defend her in
The assaults of death, that hour which long had bin
The dreadful expectation of those friends
That pitied her, arrived, in sorrow ends
Fears cold disease; those Ministers of fate,
The props to all that is illegitimate,
The Army, to suppress the weak essays
Of love or pity, guarded had the ways
By which illegal power conducted her
From that dark room, griefs curtain'd Theater,
To be beheld upon the public stage,
The glory, yet the scandal of the age*
Which two extremes met on the scaffold in
A Princess suffering, and a peoples sin:
Which now, joined to the dreadful pomp that calls
His Subjects to attend the funerals
Of her loved father, whose life's virtues won
Tears for his death, thus solemnly begun.
Removed no further from the City then
An hours short walk, though undertaken when
Sol raged in Cancer might with ease convay
Scorcht travelers, a dismal temple lay
In a dark valley, where more ancient times
Had perpetrated those religious crimes
Of humane offerings to those Idols that
Their hands made, for their hearts to tremble at,
Yet this, since now made venerable by
Those reverend relics of antiquity,
The Spartan Princes monuments, by those
Of later times, though altered faith, is chose
For their retreat, when life's extinguished glory
Sought rest beneath a silent dormitory.
Nor stood this fabric all alone; long since
A Palace by some melancholy Prince
Which hated light, or loved the darkness, built
To please his humor, or conceal his guilt,
So near it stood, to distant eyes which sent
Thither their beams, it seemed one monument,
Whose sable roof amongst Cypress shadows fills
The deep dark basis of those barren hills
With such a mournful Majesty as struck
A terror into each beholders look,
Awful as if some Diety had made
That gloomy vale to be the sacred shade
Where he chose in enigma's to relate
The dark decrees of man's uncertain fate.
Betwixt this temple and the City stood
In squadrons thick as shows an ancient wood
To distant sight, the Army, placed to be
In this sad march their guilts security
Whose glittering swords shon, as if drawn to light
Days beauties to the palace of the night;
Toward which, the prisoners, yet detained within
The City, in this dreadful pomp begin
Their mournful march, led by that doleful call
By which loud war proclaims a funeral:
Those that had been the common guards unto
The murdered Princes, to the peoples view
Are first presented, on an ebon spear
Each bore a scuchion, where there did appear
The arms which once adorned those Princes shields
Sadly displayed within their sable fields.
Next these, some troops whose prosperous valor in
Their Courts had steps unto preferment bin,
Come slowly on, but slowlier followed are
By elder Captains, such whom busy war
Whose victories had their youth in honor di'd,
As useless-now for Council laid aside:
IN the rear of these the Officers of State,
Grave as they would been of Council unto Fate,
IN the purple robes of royal Mourners clad,
With heavy pace conducted in a sad
And dismal object, two black Chariots drawn
Like hideous night when it assaults the dawn
In dreadful shadows, where to fright the day
With sadder objects, on black herses lay
The Effigies of the murdered Princes, in
Whose form those spots of treason that had bin
Fates Agents, to unravel Natures law,
In bloody marks the mourning people saw,
At which sad fight from silent sorrow they
Advanced had let external grief betray
Their love, and loss, if not diverted by
Succeeding objects, which assault the eye
With what, though living, yet more terror bred.
Then what they found for the lamented dead,
In such a garb as sorrow strives to hide
The hot efluviums of a sullen pride,
Almanzor next, with slow portentous pace
Follows the herses, his discovered face
So subtly di'd in sorrow as it had
Strove to out-mourn the sable arms which clad
His falser breast, whose studi'd treason knew
No such disguise, as first to meet the view
OF the censuring people in a dress that shows
Him by their States maturer Council chose
Against who'ere durst maintain the prisoners cause
By's valor for to vindicate their laws.
But now, to lose these rivolets of tears
In the vast Ocean of their grief, appears
Their last, and most lamented object in
The royal Captives, whose sad fate had bin
Not so disguised in attributes of guilt,
But that the love their former virtue built
In every breast, broke through their fear to show
How much their duty did to sorrow ow.
In that black train they had beheld before,
Though full of sadness, wearied life past ore
The stage of nature, is their darkest text
To comment on, which since good men perplexed
With life's cares are, finds less regre^ then now
To living sufferers justly they allow:
Friends though less near (since death is but that rest
They vainly seek that are in life distressed)
Being pitied more then those whose worst of Fate
We have beheld destruction terminate.
That naught might in this scene of sorrow be
Wanting to perfect griefs solemnity
The Kingdoms Marshal, who supported in
His hand a sword, which glitring through a thin
Wreathed Cipers, through the sad Spectators eye
Struck such a terror as if shadowed by
Death's sooty vail; conducting after goes
The undaunted Cyprian, with a look that shows
A soul whose valor was of power to light
Such high resolves as by their splendour might
Make death look lovely; on his upper hand
Her sexes glory, she whose virtues scanned
Her actions by heavens strictest rules, the swee^
Pharonnida, unmoved prepares to meet
The ministers of death, her train being by
Florenza, who must in that Tragedy
Act her last part, sustained. The garment which
The beauteous Princess did that day enrich
Was black, but cut on white, ore which the fair
Neglected treasure of her flowing hair
Hung loosely down; upon her head she wore
A wreath of Lillies, almost shadowed ore
With purple Hyacinths, on which the stains
Of murder yet in bloody marks remains;
Over all this a melancholy cloud
Of thick curled Cipers from the head did shroud
Her to the feet, through which those spots of white
Appeared like stars, those comforts of the night,
When stole through scattred clouds; in her right hand
She held a watch whose next stage should have spand
The minutes of her life; her left did hold
A branch of myrtle, which as grown too old
To live, began to wither, for defense
OF the falling leaves, as death and innocence
Had both conspired to save 't; the bow was round
In mistick wreaths of black and silver wound.
Near to the royal Prisoners, many Peers
Of either Kingdom, men of the gravest years
And loyal'st hearts, did with a doleful pace
Bring up the rear, each melancholy place
Through which they past, being with those pensive flowers
That wait on funerals strewn. The lofty towers
Of checkered marble had their stately brows
In sables bound, their pinacles with boughs
Of dismal Yew adorned, as if their knell
Should next be rung, a solemn passing bell
In every Church was toull'd, whose doleful sound
Mixed with the drum and trumpets dead march, dround
The peoples cries, whose grief can never be shown
In 'ts native dress, till loud and clamorous grown.
In this black pomp the mourning train had left
The sable City, which being now bereft
Of all her sad and solemn guests, did bear
The emblem of an empty sepulcher,
So full of silence, all her throng being gone
With heavy pace to be attendants on
Those funeral rights, which ere performed must have
More virtue for attendants to the grave
Then ere they could again expect to see,
Whose hopes of life lay in minority.
Come to the desert vale, which yet had kept
A solitary loveliness that slept
There in untroubl'd rest, a levelled green
Chose for the Lists, which nature lodged between
Two barren hills, upon whose bare front grew
(Though thinly scattered) here a balefull Yew,
And there a dismal Cypress, placed as they
Had only chose that station to display
The peoples passions, who with eyes fixed in
Full orbs of tears, ere this had sorrowing seen
The pitied prisoners, to those Scaffolds brought
Where those lamented lives whose treason sought
To ruin must be sacrificed to please,
Ambitious man, not angry heaven appease,
This curles their bloods, which soon inflamed had grown
Had not the varied scene of sorrow shown
The murdered Princes, who product, as they
Had been reserved as opiats to allay
Their angers flame, are both exposed unto
The satisfaction of the public view,
Mounted on herses, which on either side
OF the Temple gate with deaths most dismal pride
On ebon pillars stood, as raised to show
What justce did to their destruction ow.
Placed near to these, their sorrows sad Records,
Almanzors tent, to show that it affords
For red revenge a close reception, stood
Like a black rock from whence in clouds of blood
The sanguine streamers through the thickened sky
Did waving with unconstant motion fly,
In view of which, though at the other end
If any durst appear that could defend
Their cause, whom heaven alone knew innocent,
There to receive him stood an empty Tent,
Whose outside, as if fancied to deter
His entrance, there appeared a Sepulcher
Over whose gate her false Accusers had
Transcribed those crimes which so un^ustly clad
In purples sins those spotless ^ouls; which seen
In their bright virtues candid robes had been
The hated wonders of those foes, whose ends
Now find success in the pity of their friends.
Near this black tent, on mourning scaffolds, where
Death did to encounter innocence prepare
His heaviest darts, such as were headed by
That more then mortal plague, foul infamy,
The prisoners mounted; at the other gate
Almanzor, like the messenger of Fate
Fraught with revenge appears, his dreadful form
More full of terror then a midnight storm
To straightened Fleets, appearing to the view
OF the multitude, who whilst their prayers pursue
The prisoners safety on the flagging wings
Of sickly hope, his sure destruction brings,
Since from their knowledge more remote to cure,
Unto their hates impatient calenture.
Thrice had the trumpet sadly sounded bin
And thrice a Herald's voice had summoned in
Some bold defendant; but both yet so vain,
As if just Heaven neglected to maintain
That righteous cause, which sadly seen of all,
The sorrowful, but helpless people fall
Since hopes of life was shrunk into despair,
To be assistant by their private prayer
At deaths distracting conflict; in a brief
Effectual speech, which answered to the chief
Heads of's indictment, in those powerful words
Conceived his last, the Cyprian Prince affords
Their sorrow yet a larger Theme; which done,
Being first to die, having with prayer begun
That doubfull road, he now a short leave takes
Of all his mourning Friends, then calmly shakes
Off each terrestial thought, and heightened by
The speculations of eternity,
Above those damps which natures hand did weave
Of humane fear, submitting to receive
The fatal stroke, that Center to a crown,
But orb of wit, his sacred head lays down.
Fled to the dark cell of their utmost fears
With eyes whose lids were cemented in tears,
Each still Spectators thoughts did now repair
To the last refuge of a silent prayer:
In which close parl, from that deep Lethargy
They are to joy and wonder wakened by
A trumpets voice, which from the other gate
Sounds a defiance; 'twas not yet so late
In hopes dim twilight, but they once more may
In expectation of a glorious day
Dare look abroad: which done, unto their view
A Cyprian Herald being designed unto
That office, they leading a stranger Knight
Into the Lists behold, whose welcome sight
Was entertained with acclamations, that
Raised thunder for his foes to tremble at.
This valiant Hero, whose brave gesture gave
Life to that hope which told them heaven would save
Such suffering virtue, now drawn near unto
The tent, is taking a disdainful view
Of that accursed inscription, whilst all eyes
Centered on him, see through his steel-disguise
A goodlier shape, though not so vastly great
As that cursed lump nature had made the seat
Of's enemies black soul: The armor which
He wore, they knew not whether for more rich,
Or rare to prize; the ground of it, as he
For those had mourned, which now from infamy
His sword sought to redeem, was black, but all
Enameled ore with silver-hearts, let fall
From flaming clouds, which hovering above
Them, looked like incense fired by heavenly love.
Amongst these in every vacant place was found
A deaths-head scattered, some of which were crowned
With laurel, others on their bare fronts wore
A regal diadem; in's shield he bore
In a Field argent on the dexter side
A new-made Grave, to which a Lamb denied
Succor on earth, to shun the swift persuit
Of a fierce wolf, was fled; but ere one foot
Was entered there, from a red cloud that charged
The field in chief, a thunderbolt enlarged
By heavens just wrath, from's sulphrie seat was sent
So swiftly, that what saved the innocent,
The guilty slew, which now in's blood does lie
A President for powerful tyranny.
Those short surveys of the people hardly took,
Ere having now th'unuseful tent forsook,
The brave Defendant with a loud salute
Had past the scaffold in the bold persuit
Of glorious vict'rie, whom his angry foe
Whose valors flame never an allay did know
So cold as fear, in that wild flame which rage
Opposed had kindled, hastens to engage
Him with so high a storm of fury, that
Each falling stroke, others did tremble at
What they sustained. Strength, valor, judgment, all
Which ere made Conquerors stand, or conquered fall,
Here seemed to meet: As it t'outrun desire,
Each nimble stroke quick as ethereal fire,
When winged by motion fell, yet with a heft
So full of danger, most behind them left
Their bloody marks, which in this fatal strife
Seemed like the opened salliports of life.
Sadly expecting whom by fate would be
This day chose favorite unto destiny,
The people in such silent ecstasies,
As if their souls only informed their eyes,
Sat to behold the combat; when to give
Their faith assurance justice yet did live
Unchain'd by faction, from a fatal blow
Struck near his heart, Almanzor fallen so low
From hopes of vict'rie they beheld, that in
His ruin, what before their fear had bin
Grew now their comfort, when that speedy death
Might not transport his soul ere his last breath
Confessed his guilt; the noble Champion stays
His just raised rage, whilst his own tongue displays
His thoughts black curtains, by discovering all
Those crimes beneath whose burden he did fall,
Heavy as curses which from heaven are sent
For the peoples plague, or Princes punishment:
In which short close of life, to ease the grief
Of late repentance, that successful Thief
Whose happiest hour his latest proved, being took
For president, he in a calm forsock
That world, which, whilst his plots did strive to build
Ambition high, he had with tempests filled.
The multitude, whose universal voice
Had taught even such, though distant, to rejoice,
As age or sickness had detained within
The City-walls, forced those that yet had bin
Her foes (converted by the general votes
For joy) to change their envies ill set notes
To calm compliance, in whose concord they
With as much speed as duty did convey
Her best of subjects, to congratulate
Her freedom hastes, who in this smile of fate,
^^^ilst all her friends strove to forget those fears
Whose form they lately trembled at, appears
Shadowed in grief, on whose joy could reflect
No beam of comfort, the supposed neglect
Of her Argalia, whose victorious sword
Did in her fears extremity afford
Some hopes of comfort, which t'opinion lost
More sorrow then the assaults of death had cost;
Had not, whilst she did in dark passion stray,
His full discovery glorified the day.
Amidst the peoples acclamations, she
Though from a scaffold now conveyed to be
Raised to a Crown, all that vain pomp beholds
With eyes orecast in grief, till he unfolds
Her further comfort, by discovering what
Whilst each spectator was admiring at,
Becomes to her so much of joy, that in
This calm, that courage which before had bin
Unshook in tempests now begins to move,
And what scorned hate, submits to powerful Love;
From whose fixed center, with as swift a flight
And kind a welcome, as the nimble light
Salutes the morning, pleasure now imparts
Her powerful beams, until those neighboring hearts
That lived by hopes thin diet, drew from hence
Substantial lines to joys circumference.
Her innocence unvailed by his success,
And both by that black foil of wickedness,
Almanzor's guilt, more glorious made, is now
The only volume wonder could allow
Those that before her worst of foes had bin,
Sadly to read repentant lectures in:
Which seen by her observant Peers, that all
Succeeding discords in that Tyrants fall
Might find a tomb, him, being their Princess choice,
The Spartan Armies universal voice
Salute their Chief, which President affords
A pattern to the wise Epirot Lords,
Who had a law age made authentic, which
Prohibited their diadem to enrich
A female brow, on him, whose title stood
Nearest of all collateral streams of blood;
They wisely fix a choice, which proves to be
Their glory, and their States security.
And now raised from that lowly posture in
Which fear had left them, the vast rout begin
Their motion toward fair Ghieranza, where
The varied scene did such proportion bear
With joy's exalted harmony, which in
Their rescued Princess dwelt, all that had bin
Their sorrows dismal characters they now
Obliterate, and her late clouded brow
Crown with delights. The solemn bells whose sad
Toll, when they left your mourning City, had
Frighted the trembling hearer, now are all
Rung out for joy, as if so loud a call
Only becom'd a love which could not be
Expressed until the full solemnity
Of their approaching nuptials did unite
Their hearts or crowns, not with more full delight
Then what did near as great a blessing prove
(Discording subjects) in your bonds of love.
Thus after all the wild variety
Through Fates dark labyrinths, now arrived to be
Crowned with as much content as ere was known
By any that death did enforce to own
The frailties of mortality, we leave
Our celebrated Lovers to receive
Those blessings which heaven on such Kings showers down,
Whose virtues add a luster to the Crown.
FINIS.
