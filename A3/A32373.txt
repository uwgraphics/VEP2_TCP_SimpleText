A PROCLAMATION Commanding all Seamen and Mariners to Repair to the Ships on
which they are Listed.
CHARLES R.

WHereas His Majesty's Fleet is now ready to put to Sea, and that diverse
Seamen, Mariners, and others having been Listed to Serve on Board the said
Fleet, do neglect to make their appearance, His Majesty, with the Advice of His
Privy Council, has thought fit by this His Royal Proclamation, strictly to
Charge and Require all Seamen, Mariners, and others who have been Listed on
Board any His Majesty's Ships, or who have received Prest-money, or are
otherwise howsoever under His Majesty's Pay at Sea, That forthwith and
immediately upon Publication hereof, they repair to their several and
respective Ships; And if any after the Publishing of this His Majesty's
Proclamation, shall fail to render themselves accordingly, they shall be
proceeded against as Desertors of His Majesty's Service, with all Exemplary
Severity.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Sixth day of April, 1673. God save the
King.
