A PROCLAMATION Against NEW BUILDINGS.
CHARLES R.

WHereas in the Fields commonly called the Wind-Mill-Fields, Dog-Fields, and
the Fields adjoining to So-Hoe, and several other places in and about the
Suburbs of London and Westminster, diverse small and mean Habitations and
Cottages have been lately Erected upon New Foundations, and more of that kind
are Daily preparing, not only without any Grant or Allowance from His Majesty,
but some of them against His Majesty's Express Command, signified by His
Surveyor-general; Which kind of Buildings are likely to prove common and
public Nusances, by being made use of for the most Noysom and Offensive
Trades, and by becoming the Receptacles of a multitude of Poor, to the Damage
of these Parishes, already too much Encumbered, and by rendering the Government
of those parts more Unmannageable; But especially by Choking up the Air of
His Majesty's Palaces and Parks, and endangering the Infection, if not the
total loss of those Waters, which by many Expencefull Drains and Conduits, are
Conveyed from those Fields to His Majesty's Palace at Whitehall; Whereof some
Decay is already perceived by His Majesty's Sergeant-Plummer, and more is daily
feared: Therefore for prevention of such growing Mischiefs, whereby His
Majesty's Palaces may be greatly Annoyed, the Houses of the Nobility and Gentry
very much Offended, the Parishes Overcharged, the Perfecting of City Buildings
very much hindered and the Health both of City and Suburbs exceedingly
endangered: His Majesty by Advice of His Privy Council, has thought fit to
Publish this His Royal Proclamation, and does hereby Straightly Charge and
Command all manner of persons whom it does or may concern, That they forbear to
Erect, or cause to be Erected any more New Buildings in the Suburbs of London
or Westminster, or to Finish any Buildings in the said Suburbs already begun,
without His Majesty's License in that behalf, under His Great Seal first had
and obtained: To the end That if any more New Buildings be thought fit by His
Majesty to be carried on, they may be Built Firmly and Regularly, according to
such Design and Order as may best suit with the Public Benefit and
Convenience, as they will answer the contrary at their Perils. And if any shall
presume to Offend against His Majesty's Royal Command herein Declared, His
Majesty will cause such Buildings to be Abased and Thrown down, and the Persons
of such Offenders to be Arrested and Seized, and further Proceeded against
according to the utmost Rigor and Severity of Law.
