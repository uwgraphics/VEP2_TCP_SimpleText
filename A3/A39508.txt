AT THE Council Chamger in Whitehall, The Second Day of November, 1697.
PRESENT, Their Excellencies the Lords Justices in Council.
WHereas diverse of His Majesty's Subjects who are Attainted of High Treason, or
who have been in Rebellion against His Majesty, and other Dangerous and
Disaffected Persons, have withdrawn themselves into France, and other Parts
beyond the Seas; And whereas Information has been given to this Board, That
some Persons, being His Majesty's Subjects, have lately come out of France into
this Kingdom, without any Permission or Leave for the same, which, if not
prevented, may Endanger the Safety of His Majesty's Royal Person, and Disturb
the Peace of this Kingdom: Their Excellencies the Lords Justices in Council,
taking the same into Consideration, have thought fit to Order, That all Mayors,
Justices of the Peace, and other Magistrates and Officers, whom it may Concern,
in or near the respective Ports of this Kingdom, do take Care, and give the
necessary Directions, That all Persons, being His Majesty's Subjects, who shall
come out of France into this Kingdom, not having a Pass from His Majesty, be
Apprehended and Secured in Safe Custody, together with their Papers, till they
are Examined. In Order to which the said Magistrates are to give Notice from
time to time to One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State of all
Persons so Apprehended, that such further Directions may be given concerning
them, as shall be Requisite. And to the intent that all Persons concerned may
take due Notice hereof, Their Excellencies have thought fit to Direct that this
Order be Printed, and also published in the Gazette.
