Die Jovis 28. August. 1645.
WHereas for diverse years there has not been any Election of Scholars in the
College of Eaton, and this year by reason there was no Provost settled in Kings
College in Cambridge, the time appointed for such Election by the Statutes of
the College of Eaton is elapsed: It is therefore Ordained by the Lords and
Commons assembled in Parliament, That there may, and shall be an Election of
Scholars in manner as has been heretofore accustomed before the thirtieth
day of October next following, and that such Election shall be valide and of
force, as if it had been made in the time appointed by the said Statute of the
said College. And it is further Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That all
the Rents and Revenues belonging to the College of Eaton to be received and
disbursed for the immediate use of the said College, shall be freed and
discharged of and from all Assessements, Taxes, and Charges whatsoever, as well
already made, as hereafter to be made, or charged by virtue of any Ordinance of
Parliament.
