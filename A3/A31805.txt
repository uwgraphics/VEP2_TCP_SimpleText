HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER TO THE LAST MESSAGE AND RESOLVTION OF BOTH HOUSES OF
PARLIAMNT
Concerning the Militia and the Prince.
2. March 1641
I Am so much amassed at this Message, that I know not what to answer, you
speak of Ielosies and fears, lay your hands to you Hearts, and ask your
selves whether I may not likewise be disturbed with Fears and Ielosies; and
if so, I assure you this Message has nothing lessened them.

For the Militia I thought so much of it before I sent that answer, and am so
much assured that the answer is agreeable to what in Justice or Reason you can
ask, or I in Honor Grant, that I shall not alter it in any point.

For my residence near you I wish it might be safe and Honorable, that I had
no cause to absent my self from White Hall, ask your selves whether I have
not.

For my Son I shall take care of him, which shall Justify me to God as a
Father, and to my Dominions as a King.

To conclude J Assure you upon my Honor, that I have no thought but of Peace
and Justice to my people, which J shall by all fair means seek to preserve
and maintain, relying upon the goodness and providence of God for the
preservative of my self and Rights.

London, Printed for J. Wright.
