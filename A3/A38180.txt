October. 4. 1643.
Whereas an Ordinance was lately made by both Houses of Parliament, for the
speedy supply of the Cities of London and Westminster, with the places and
parishes adjoining, within the line of Communication, and bills of Mortality,
with wood for fuel within threescore miles compass of the said Cities. And
that the poorer sort may be first provided for, with special direction to the
Committee of Lords and Commons appointed for that service, to take care for the
preventing of the cutting down and spoiling of men's woods by disorderly
persons without any lawful Authority, which has been, and is so much daily
practiced and complained of. It is therefore Ordered by the said Committee,
that all persons in and about the said Cities of London and Westminster, and
other the places within the said compass, do forbear to cut or carry away
any woods or Trees growing upon any man's grounds, without the owners consent or
lawful Warrant in that behalf, on pain of severe punishment. And that all
Deputy Lieutenants, Justices of the peace, and other Officers whom it shall
concern, be required to take special care for the preventing hereof, and for
the apprehending of such persons who shall offend therein, that they may be
brought to condign punishment. And the several owners of such woods are
required to see this Order duly executed; and all owners of woods liable to the
said Ordinance, are hereby strictly required and enjoined not to sell, cut
down, or carry away any of the said woods liable to the said Ordinance, before
the same be duly executed on pain of further answering their contempt herein
to both Houses of Parliament.

It is Ordered by the Committee of Lords and Commons, that this Order be
printed, and published in all Parish-Churches and Chapels, by the Parsons,
Vicars, or Curates of the same, within the compass abovesaid.

Ralph Hall Clerk of the said Committee.
