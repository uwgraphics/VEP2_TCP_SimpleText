THE STATIONER TO THE READER.
I Have with some Industry and Trouble, made the following Collection of Books
Printed in England since the Dreadful fire of London in 1666, having mentioned
many (besides the additions) that were omitted in the former Catalogues; but
thought it not material to mention those Printed before the Fire, there being
then such a general destruction of Books (and scarcity, till Reprinted) that
the loss to our particular Vide Stat. Eng. p. 203. part Second.
Trade in Books only, was valued at One hundred and fifty thousand pounds.

In reference to the Prices which I mention, many of them are uncertain, in
regard of the various fortune that Books, as well as Men, are subject to; for
they continue, rise or fall in their price, according to the repute of the
Author, plenty, or scarcity of the Impression, etc.

I have only to add, that I have made some progress in Collecting the Titles
of Latin Books on all Subjects Printed beyond the Seas since 1666. and intend
to publish it in Easter Term next.
