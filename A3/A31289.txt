TO THE READER.
THE Reasons of this Sale are in plain English two. 1. The Gratification of the
Gentlemen of the Long Rob^ 2. A moderate Gain proposed by the undertaker, and
whatever may be the success as to the latter, he pleases himself that he may
possibly attain his end in the former. And tho the Books might be Justifiably
Commended as answering the Epithites given them, yet being really good he
thinks they need none; and if they were bad, to represent them directly good,
would betray the folly, and argue the ignorance of the Representer himself. The
Gentlemen the Buyers really are, and ought to be the most Competent Judges
themselves; and may censure and remark as they please: Its therefore desired
for their further satisfaction that they would come and view the
Qualifications, and Editions of the Books three whole days preceding the Sale.

This Auction will begin on Monday the fourteenth day of this instant February,
1687, at the Auction-house in Ave-Mary-Lane, over against the Black-swan, near
Ludgate Street, from the Hours of 9 in the Morning, to 12, and from 2 in the
Afternoon, to 6 in the Evening, continuing daily till all the Books are sold.
