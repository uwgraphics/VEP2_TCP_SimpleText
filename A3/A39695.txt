THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.
READER,
AMONG the difficulties and severities of true Religion, the faithful
searching, and diligent keeping of our heart^ are found in the first and
highest rank of difficulties; these two take up the main work of^^ Christian
betwixt them, hic labor hoc opu^^est. I had hopes that these Essaies for the
searching of the heart, might much sooner have followed my former A Sain indeed.
for keeping the heart: but providence has reserved it for the fittest season.

It comes to thy hand, Reader, in a day o^ straits and fears, a dark and gloomy
season^^ when the Nations about us are made drun^ with their own blood, and
filled with the (...) of astonishment; In a day when the (...) ready to pass
unto us, and a storm seems to (...) rising in the fears of many, and threatening
the Protestant interest in these reformed Nations* St^e Men very considerable
for Piety and Learning from that Scripture, Rev. 13. 3. The deadly wound, (viz.
that given the beast by the Reformation) was healed, have concluded that Popery
will once more over run the reformed Nations; and one of great renown in all
the Churches of Christ, foretelling this furious (but hort) srtom, comforts the
People of God with this, that it is like to fall heaviest upon the Worshipp^rs
in the outward Court, namely, the formal Professors of the times.

Oh! How much is every Man now concerned to have his estate and condition well
cleared, and to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure!

It should both amaze and grieve a pious mind, to see how some ingenious
Persons can sit with unwearied patience and pleasure racking their brains upon
some dry School Problem, or ^ome nice Mathematical Point; whilst no Reasons or
Persuasions can prevail with them to ^pend one serious hour in the search and
study of their own hearts.

It was the saying of the great Cicero, Li^enter omnibus omnes opes
concesserim, ut ^^ihi liceat, vi nulla interpellante, isto mo^^ literis vivere.
I would give all the Wealth ^n the World that I might wholly live in my
Studies, and have nothing to hinder me. What a brave offer had that been, if
Heaven and the clearing of a title to it had been the subject-mat^er of those
studies! Creed mihi, extingui dulce esset, Mathematicarum artium studio, says
another, (i. e.) Believe me, it were a sweet death to dye in the study of the
Mathematical Arts: And I should be apt to believe it too, did I not know that
eternal Judgment immediately follows death; and that they who stand at the door
of eternity have higher matters to mind than Mathematical niceties. To discern
the harmonies and proportions in nature is pleasant, but to discern the harmony
and proportion of the Signs of Grace laid down in the Word, with the Works of
Grace wrought in our Souls, is a far more pleasant and necessary employment;
and to be extinguished in such a work as this, were a lovely death indeed;
Blessed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he comes shall find so doing.

My Friends, a day of trouble is near, a dying hour approaches us, and when
our Eye-strings, and Heart Strings are breaking, when we are taking the last
grasp of Christ and the Promises, yo^ will then know to what purpose those
hours spen^ in such work as this were. Search your selves^ yea search your
selves before the decree brin^ forth, as that text may be read, Zeph. 2. 1, 2.
Ente^ into thy Chamber, Christian, and shut thy door; s^^ close to this
employment thou art here directed to; and however times shall govern, whether
it be fair or foul weather abroad, thou shall never repent such an expense of
thy time; Nusquam requiem inveni, nisi in libro and claustro; said a devout
soul once. I am never better, than when I am at my Book, or on my knees.

This may seem but a dull melancholy life to the brisk and aerie Spirits of
these times; but let us be content with it as it is, and leave them (if we
cannot have their company) to their ^portiveness and frolicks, never once
grudging ^^em their short and dear bought pleasures. Assu^ance that sin is
pardoned^ and Christ is ours; ^ith the unspeakable joys that are inseparably
^^nnected therewith is that White Stone, and New Name, which none knows but he
that ^^eives it; for no words can possibly signify to ^^other what that soul
tastes and feels in such an our as that is.

And be not discouraged at the difficulty of ob^ining it, this White Stone is
no Philosophers one, which no Man could ever say, he had in his own hand, for
many a Christian has really found it in waiting upon the Lord by Prayer, and
diligently searching the Scriptures and his own heart.

Reader, The time will come when they that ^coff at the serious diligence of
the Saints, and break many a pleasant Jest upon the most solemn and awful
things in Religion, will tremble when they shall hear the Midnight-Cry, Behold
^he Bridegroom comes; and see the Lamps of all Vain and Formal Professors
expire, and ^one admitted into the Marriage, but such whose Lamps are furnished
with Oil (i. e.) such whose professions and duties are enlivened and ^aintained
by vital Springs and Principles of ^eal Grace within them.

It is a very remarkable Story that Melchior Adams ^ecords in the life of
Gobeli^us, Melch. Adams in vita Gobelini personae vixit. Anno. 1420.
That a little before his ^ime there was a Play set forth at Isenach in
Germany, of the Wise and Foolish Virgins: ^herein the Virgin Mary, who was one
of ^he Five Saints that represented the Wise Virgins, ^as brought in with the
rest, telling the Fool^^h Virgins that cried to her for Oil, that it ^as too
late: and then others representing the ^oolish Virgins, fell a weeping and
making ^ost bitter Lamentations.

Hereat Prince Frederick (who was one of the Spectators) greatly amazed, cried
out, Quid est fides nostra Christiana, si neque Maria, neque alia Sancta
exorari potest, etc. What is our faith worth, and to what purpose are al^ our
good works, if neither Mary, nor any other Saint can help us! And such was his
consternation, that it threw him into a sore and violent disease, which ended
in an Apoplex, whereof he died about four days after.

If the representation of these things in a Play ended the Life of so great a
Man, so tragically; Oh think with thy self, Reader, what will the effects of
the Lords real appearance in the clouds of Heaven, and the mourning and wailing
of the Tribes of the Earth in that day be? Think I say and think again, and
again, what the dismal effects of such a sight and sound will be upon all that
neglect serious preparation themselves, and scoff at them that do prepare to
meet the Lord.

The design of this Manual is to bring every Man's Gold to the Touchstone and
Fire^ I mean every Man's Grace to the trial of the word, that thereby we may
know what we are, what we have, and what we must expect and trust to at the
Lord's coming. I preten^ not to any gift of diserning Spirits. Such a^
extraordinary gift there once was in the Church and very necessary for those
times (wherein Satan was so busy, and the Canon of Scripture not completed)
which the Apostle calls the Gift of discerning Spirits, 1 Cor. 12. 10. and some
are of Opinion that by virtue of this Gift, Peter discerned the Hypocrisy of
Ananias and Saphira, but whatever that Gift was, it is ut^erly ceased now; no
Man can pretend to it, but ^he Ordinary aids and assistances of the Spirit are
with us still, and the lively Oracles are a^ong us still, to them we may freely
go for resolution of all doubts, and decision of perplexed ^ases: and thus we
may discern our own Spi^its, though we want the extraordinary gift of
discerning other Men's Spirits.

I have little to say of this Treatise in thy Hands, more than that it is well
aimed, and ^esigned, however it be managed: the Ear tries words, as the Mouth
tastes Meat; these things will relish according to the Palates it meets ^ith.

It is not the pleasing, but profiting of Men ^^at I have herein labored for.
I know of nothing in it that is like to wound the upright, (...) slightly heal
the Hypocrite, by crying peace, ^ace, when there is no peace. Scripture light
^ath been my Cynosura, and with that thread ^ my hand, I have followed the
search of Hy^crisie through the Labyrinths of the Heart. ^ome assistance I hope
I have had also from ^xperience; for Scripture and Experience are such
Relatives, and the tie betwixt them so^a discernable, as nothing in Nature can
be more so. What we feel in our hearts, we might have read in the Scriptures
before ever we fel^ it.

That the Blessing of God may go forth with it, and accompany it to thy Soul,
Reader, i^ the hearts desire and prayer of

Thine and the Churches Servant in Christ, John Flavell
THE Touchstone of Sincerity: OR, THE SIGNS Of GRACE, AND Symptoms of
Hypocrisy, Opened in a Treatise upon REVEL. III. xvii, xviii.
Because thou say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of
nothing: And know not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me GOLD TRIED in the FIRE, that thou
may be rich, etc.
CHAP. I.
Wherein the Text is opened, and the Doctrines propounded.
ALthough the Revelation be a compendium of intricate Visions and obscure
Prophecies, containing almost as many mysteries as words: Tot mysteria
quo^verba. Hieron.
yet that cloud overshadows the Propheti^^ part only; which begins where this
Chap^^ter (with the doctrinal part) ends: here the Waters are found no deeper
than in other places of Scripture; but if we go a little farther they become an
overflowing flood: hithert^ we touch ground, but a step farther delive^ us into
the deeps, which are above the head of the tallest Christians: here the Spirit
speaks doctrinally, and perspicuously; but i^ the following Chapters
mystically, and i^ great obscurity.

Seven Epistles are found in this Doctrina^ part, immediately dictated from
Heaven^ and sent by John to the Seven Churches of Asia, to instruct, correct,
encourage, and confirm them, as their several cases required.

My Text falls in the last Epistle, sent to the Church of L^odicea; the worst,
and most degenerate of all the rest. The best had their defects, and
infirmities; but this labored under the most dangerous disease of all. The
fairest face of the seven had some spots, but a ^angerous disease seems to have
invaded the very heart of this.

Not that all were equally guilty, but the greatest part (from which the whole
is de^ominated) were lukewarm professors; who ^ad a name to live, but were
dead, who being never thoroughly engaged in Religion, ^asily embraced that
principle of the Gnost^ks which made it (...) a matter of indifferency to own
or deny Christ in time of ^ersecution. The most saving Doctrine that ^me
Professors are acquainted with. This ^kewarm temper Christ hated, he was sick
(...) them, and loathed their indifferency: I ^ish (says he) v. 16. thou were
either cold or ^t; an expression of the same amount with ^at in 1 King. 18. 21.
how long halt you between (...) opinions? And is manifestly transla^ed ^om the
qualities of ^ater, Frigidos vocat plane a Christo alienos. Fervidos, vera
Christi cognitione in excellenti gradu praeditos. Tepidos, qui cum Christiani
aici velint, nec causam religionis serio agunt, nec vitam confessioni conformem
dignamque ducunt. Sol. Glass. Rhet. Sacra par. 3. p. 165.
which is either ^ld, or hot; or luke^arm, a middle temper ^etwixt both, and
more ^aucious to the sto^ach than either of ^e former. Cold is the ^omplexion
and natu^al temper of those ^^at are wholly aliena^d and estranged from Christ
and Religion. ^ot, is the gracious temper of those that now and love Jesus
Christ in an excelling ^egree. Lukewarm, or tepid, is the temper of ^ose who
have too much Religion to be e^eemed Carnal, and too little to be truly
^piritual; a generation that is too politic to ^enture much, and yet so
foolish as to lose all: ^^ey are loath to forsake Truth wholly, and ^ore loath to
follow it too closely: the form of ^eligion they affect as an honor, the power
of (...) they judge a burden.

This is that temper which the Lord hat^ and this was the Disease of Laodicea,
whi^ Christ the great and only Heart- Anatom and Soul- Physician discovers in
v. 17. and p^scribes a cure for it in v. 18. So that (...) words resolve
themselves into two parts: (...) First, A faithful discovery, Secondly, A
proper remedy, of the Disea^ of Laodic^


1. First, Their disease is faithfully disc^vered to them, both in its
symptoms, caus^ and aggravation.

First, Its Symptom, an unconcerned, i^ different regardless spirit in matters
of Religion; nor hot, nor cold; the true temper (...) Formal Professors, who
never engaged them (...) selves thoroughly and heartily in the ways (...) God,
but can take, or leave as times govern^ and worldly interest come to be
concerne^^

Secondly, Its cause and root, which is the defect and want of the Truth, and
Power (...) inward Grace; noted in these expressions Thou art wretched, and
miserable, poor, blind, an^ naked; (i. e.) thou art destitute of a rea^
principle, a solid work of Grace; these fiv^ Epithets do all point at one and
the sam^^ thing; namely, the defectiveness and rotten^ ^ ness of their
foundation. The two first, (...), wretched and miserable; are more general,
concluding them in a sa^ condition, a very sinful and lamentable estate: the
three last, (...), ^Z. poor, blind and naked, are more particu^^r, pointing at
those grand defects, and ^ws in the foundation, which made their ^^ndition so
wretched and miserable.

First, poor, that is, void of Righteousness, ^^d true Holiness be^^re God;
(...) destitutus Iustitia, and Sanctitate vera coram Deo. Grotius.
these are ^e true riches of Chri^^^ans, and whosoever ^ants them, is poor, and
miserable; how ^ch soever he be in gifts of the mind, or ^easures of the earth.

Secondly, Blind, (i. e.) without spiritual ^umination, (...) Nec morbum
sciens, nec remedium.
and so ^ither knowing their ^ease, nor their reme^; the evil of Sin, or
necessity of Christ. ^rham in Loc.

Thirdly, Naked, without Christ, and his ^ghteousness. (...) Carens justitia
quaev^stitus est Christianorum. Pareus.
Sin is ^e Souls shame and ^kedness. Christ's pure ^d perfect Righteous^^s is
its covering, or garment: this they ^nted, how richly soever their bodies were
^^rned. These were Laodiceans, (i. e.) a just, righteous People; (according to
the no^on of that word) whose garments with ^ich they covered themselves, were
made the homespun thread of their own ^ghteousness.

Thirdly, The disease of Laodicea is he^ opened to them in its aggravations.
Thou sai^ I am rich, and increased with goods, and ha^ need of nothing; but
know not, etc.

To be really graceless, and Christless is miserable condition; but to be so,
and y^ confidently perswad^ of the contrary, Nil miserius misero non miserante
seipsum.
is mo^ miserable: to have t^^ very symptoms of Death upon us, and y^ tell
those that pity us, we are as well as the^ is lamentable indeed.

O the efficacy of a Spiritual Delusio^ This was their disease, gracelesness,
and t^^ aggravation of it, was their senslesness.

2. Secondly, We have a proper reme^ prescribed, v. 18. I counsel thee to buy
of (...) gold tried in the fire, that thou may be ri^ etc. In which we have
to consider, Fi^^ what is prescribed for the cure. Secondl^ where it is to be
had. Thirdly, how to (...) obtained.

First, What are the remedies prescribe and they are three; Gold,
White-rayment, a^^ Eye Salve. First, Gold the cure of Povert^^ yea, Gold tried
in the Fire, (i. e.) grace the has been variously proved already, and t^^ more
it is proved, the more its truth will (...) conspicuous. The next is
White-rayment, t^^ remedy against nakedness. And lastly E^^^salve, the
effectual cure of blindness. Und^ these choice Metaphors, more choice and
^cellent things are shadowed, even spiritu^^ Graces, real Holiness, more
precious than old. Christ's imputed Righteousness, the ^^hest garment in all the
Wardrobe of Hea^^n; and spiritual illumination, the most ex^^llent Collyrium or
Eye Salve that ever was ^^^can be applied to the men^al eye or un^^rstanding of
Man in this World.

Secondly, Where these precious remedies ^ay be had, and you find Christ has
the ^onopoly of them all; ^ of me, Hoc (...) est Christi, extra quod nulla est
salus.
says Christ the Text; he is the ^ository of all Graces. ^gels, Ministers,
Ordinances, cannot fur^^h you with them, without Christ.

Thirdly, How they may be obtained ^m him; buy of me; on this place Estius,
(...) others build their Doctrine of Merit; ^ich is to build a superstructure
of Hay (...) Stubble upon a foundation of Gold. The ^^^gence of the very Text
it self destroys ^^h conceits: for what have they that are ^^^r, wretched,
miserable, and want all ^^^gs, to give as a price, or by way of me^^or those
inestimable treasures of Grace? ^ing therefore in this place, can signify or
^^nd no more than the acquisition, com^ing, or obtaining these things from
Jesus ^^^st in the use of such means and methods as he has appointed, and in
the use of the^^ we merit Grace no more, than the Pati^^ merits of his
Physician by coming to hi^ and carefully following his prescriptions the use of
such Medicaments as he free gives him: and that place, Isa. 55. 1. (from which
this Phrase seems to be borrowe^ fully clears it; He that has no Money, let
(...) come and buy Wine, and Milk, without Mon^ and without price.

From all which, these three Observation fairly offer themselves to us.

Doct. 1. That many Professors of Relig^ are under very great and dangerous
mist a^ in their profession.

Doct. 2. That true Grace is exceeding precio^ and greatly enriches the soul
that possesses i^

Doct. 3. That only is to be accounted true Gr^ which is able to endure all
those trials appoi^^ed, or permitted for the discovery of it.

The first Doctrine naturally rises out the scope of the Text, which is to
awak^ and convince unsound Professors.

The second from the use the Holy Gh^^ makes of the best and choicest things in
(...) ture, to shadow forth the inestimable wo^ and preciousness of grace.

And the Third, from that particular, and ^st significant Metaphor of Gold
tried in the ^^e; by which I here understand, a real ^d solid work of grace,
evidencing it self be so, in all the proofs and trials that are ^de of it; for
whatsoever is probational grace, and puts its soundness and sinceri^ to the
test, is that to it which Fire is to old: in this sense it is used in
Scripture, ^al. 66. 10. Thou have tried us as Silver is ^ed: and Zach. 13. 9. I
will bring the third ^rt through the Fire and will refine them as ^ver is
refined, and try them as gold is tried. (...) that whatsoever it is which
examines and ^es Grace, whether it be sound, and sin^re, that is the Fire
Christ here speaks of; ^^d such grace as abides these trials, is the ^old here
intended.

CHAP. II.
^herein the first Doctrine is opened and improved briefly as a preliminary
discourse to the principal subject herein designed.
^oct. 1. That many professors of Religion are under very great and dangerous
mistakes in their profession.
^ECT. I.
ALL Flattery is dangerous, Self-flattery is more dange^^us, but Self-flattery
in the business of Salva^^on is the most dangerous of all.

To pretend to the good we know we ha^^ not, is- gross hypocrisy; to o^ine and
perswa^ our selves of the good we have not, thou^ we think we have it, is
^ormal hypocrisy; a^ this was the case of those Self-deceivers the Text.

My design in this discourse is not to sha^ the well built hopes of my Man, or
be^^^ groundless Jealousies; but to discover the (...) al dangerous flaws in
the foundation of many Men's hopes for Heaven: every thing as its foundation is,
and debile fundament^^ fallit opus; that failing all fails.

There is a twofold Self-suspicion or (...) in Gods own People. The one is a
fear caution, awaking the Soul to the use of (...) preventive means for
avoiding danger; (...) is Laudable. The other a groundless suspici^^ of
reigning hypocrisy, tending only to (...) spondency; this is Culpable: by the
form the soul is guarded against danger, by the (...) ter it is betrayed into
needless trouble; a^^ debaried from peace.

Good Men have sometimes more fear the they ought, and Wicked Men have less
th^^ they ought: the former do sometimes she their eyes against the fair
evidences of the own graces, the latter shut their eyes again the sad evidences
of their Sin and Misery. T^ is an evil in both, but not equally dangero^^ for
he that shuts his Eyes against his ow^^^aces and privileges, loses but his
peace and ^mfort for a time; but he that shuts his ^es against the evidences of
his Sin and ^^^ery loses his precious soul to all eterni^! of this latter
sort of Self-deceivers the ^^orld is full, and these are the Men I am ^^^cerned
with in this point.

O that some men had less trouble! and ^^that some had more! If the foolish
Virgins ^^d been less confident, they had certainly ^en more safe, Matthew. 25.
If those glorious ^ofessors in Matthew. 7. 22. had not shut their ^^^es against
their own hypocrisy, Christ had ^t shut against them the door of Salvation ^^d
Glory. Ananias and Saphira; Hymeneus, ^^d Philetus; Alexander and Demas: with
^^^ltitudes more of that sort, are the sad in^^nces and proofs of this point.
It is said, ^v. 30. 12. There is a generation that is pure their own eyes, and
yet is not washed from ^ir filthiness. Through what false Spectacles ^^the Men
of that Generation look upon ^^eir own Souls? The Men of that Genera^^^n are
multiplied in this Generation: ne^ was any age overrun with a generation
^vain, Self-couzening, formal Professors, as ^s Generation is.

Three things I shall here endeavor to do. (1.) To give evidence beyond
contradi^^on to this sad truth; That among Profes^s are found many
Self-deceivers.

(2.) To assign the true causes and (...)sons why it is so. And,

(3.) Improve it in those practical i^ rences the point affords.

SECT. II.
THat there are multi^^^s of such selfceivers among Professors, will appea^^ 1.
First, by this, that there are ev^ where to be fou^^ (...) more professors, t^^
Converts. Unregeherate professors, whose ligion is (...) the effect of
Education. C^^^stianity by the favor of an early Provide^ was the first comer,
it first bespake them it self; these are Christians of an hum^ Creation, rather
born, than newborn bel^^ers. Now, all these are self-deceived, and h^^ing to
damnation, under the efficacy ^ strong delusion; for if a man think himse^^ be
something, when he is nothing, he deceiv^ himself, says the Apostle, Gal. 6.
3. Su^ our birth-priviledge, without the new bi^ is nothing; yea, worse than
nothing, as to ^ last, and great account; that which sta^ for a great sum in
our Arithmetic, it is thing, it is but a Cipher you see, in God's. ^^cept a man
be born again, (say the lips of tr^^ he cannot see the Kingdom of God, Joh. 3. ^

Poor self-deceivers, ponder those word Christ; you have hitherto thought (...)
civil education, your dead and heartless (...) ^ough to denominate you
Christians before ^od; but go now, and learn what that Scrip^^re means; and
be assured, you must ^^perience another manner of conversion, or ^se it is
impossible for you to escape eternal ^^mnation.

2. Secondly, It is too manifest by this, that ^any professors are only
acquainted with ^e externals of Religion; and all their du^es are no more but a
compliance of the ^tward man with the commands of God: ^is is the superficial
Religion which deceives ^d betrays multitudes into eternal misery. ^rue
Religion seats it self in the ^ inward ^an, and acts effectually upon the vital
pow^^s: killing sin in the heart, and purging its ^esigns and delights from
carnality and sel^shness; engaging the heart for God, and ^tting it as a bow in
its full bent for him, in ^^e approaches we make to him: but how ^ttle are many
Professors acquainted with ^^ese things!

Alas! if this be all we have to stand up^, how dangerous a station is it! what
is ^xternal conformity, but an artificial imita^^on of that which only lives in
the souls of ^ood men? Thus was Iehu deceived; he did ^any acts of external
obedience to Gods ^ommand, but Iehu took no heed to walk in ^ie way of the Lord
God of Israel with his heart, Kings 10. 31. and this was his overthrow.

This also was the ruin of those (...) lifts, Ezak. 33. 31. they came and sat
(...) fore the Lord as his people; The word (...) to them as a lovely song;
mightily charm^ with the modulation of the Prophets voi^ and his lively
gestures; but all the wh^ their hearts went after their covetousness: what
abundance of such phari^aical, sup^^ ficial Religion is every where to be found^

3. Thirdly, It appears by this, that eve^ trial made by sufferings upon
professou^^ blows away multitudes like dry leaves Autumn, by a stormy wind;
many fall from their own stedfastness in shaking times: pr^^perity multiplies
vain Professors, and (...) versity purges the Church of them. Them she many be
offended, Mat. 24. 10.

This the Scripture every where marks as symptom of Hypocrisy, Psalm. 78. 8. A
gener^^tion that set not their heart aright: and wh^ spirit was not sted^a^t
with God, I John 2. 1^ But they went out, that they might be made m^nifest,
that they were not of us, Matthew. 13. 2^ For when tribulation or persecution
arises b^^cause of the word; by and by he is offended: b^^ should one have
told them in the days (...) their first profession, that all their zeal an^
labor in Religion would have ended in thi^ it is like they would have replied
as Haz^^^el to the man of God, 2 King. 8. 13. (...) what is thy servant a dog,
that he should do the (...) thing! quantum mutatus ab illo?

Oh how unlike is their dark and dirty e^^ing, to their glorious and hopeful
morn^^g! these Professors have more of the Moon ^^n of the Sun; little light,
less heat; but any changes: they deceive many, yea, they ^ceive themselves, but
cannot deceive God. ^^ring the calm, what a flourish do they ^ke! and with what
gallantry do they (...)! by and by you may hear horrendas tem^tates, and soon
after you may see, flenda ^fragia, a dreadful shipwreck, after a fu^us storm;
and no wonder, for they ^nted that (...), that ^last and establishment in
^^^mselves that would have kept them tite ^^^d stable. 1 Pet. 3. 17.


4. Fourthly, It is too apparent by this, that any Professors secretly indulge
and shelter ^oved lusts under the wings of their pro^sion. This like a worm at
the root will ^^her and kill them at last, how fragrant ^ver they may seem to
be for a season. ^eon had seventy Sons, and one Bastard; (...) that one Bastard
was the death of all his ^enty Sons.

Some men have many excellent gifts, (...) perform multitudes of duties, but
one ^et sin indulged and allowed, will destroy ^m all at last. He that is
partial as to the ^rtification of his sins, is undoub^edly hypocritical in his
profession. If David's eviden^ was good for his integrity, surely such
Pr^^fessours will never clear themselves of hyp^^^crisie. I was also upright
before him, and ke^ my self from mine iniquity, says he, Psalm.^^ 23. this is
the right eye, and right hand whi^ every sincere Christian must pluck out, a^^
cut off, Matthew. 5. 29, 30.

Which is a Metaphor from Chirurgeo^ whose manner it is when the whole is
danger by any part, to cut it off, ne pars (...) cera trahatur; lest all perish.

Their suppressing some lusts raises the confidence, the indulging of one
razeth (...) foundation of their hopes, and thus they (...)ceive themselves.

5. Fifthly, This also manifests the self-(...) of many professors, That the
secret d^^ties of Religion, or at least the secret into course of the soul with
God in them, (...) secret hid from the knowledge and expe^ence of many
professors.

To attend the Ordinances of God in (...) seasons of them they know, to pray in
the families at the stated hours thereof the know; but to retire from all the
world i^ their Closets, and there to pour out their he^^ before the Lord, they
know not.

To feel somewhat within, paining the like an empty hungry stomach until the
have eaten that hidden Manna, that br^^^ secret; I mean refreshed their souls
with ^al communion with the Lord there; this a Mystery locked up from the
acquain^nce of many that call themselves Christians; ^d yet this is made a
Characteristical note of ^sincere Christian by Christ himself in Matthew. 6.

O Reader, If thy heart were right with ^od, and thou did not cheat thy self
with (...) vain profession, thou would have frequent ^asiness with God, which
thou would be ^th thy dearest friend, or the wife of thy ^some should be
privy to: Non est religio ^i omnia patent. Religion does not lay all ^^en to
the eyes of men. Observed duties ^aintain our credit, but secret duties main^in
our life. It was the saying of an Heathen ^out his secret correspondency with
his ^iend, What need the world be a acquainted ^ith it? thou and I are Theater
enough to each ^her: There are enclosed pleasures in Reli^^on, which none but
renewed spiritual souls ^o feelingly understand.

6. Lastly, How many more profess Religi^n in these days, than ever made
Religion ^^eir business! Philosophy tells us there is a (...), and a (...), a
main-business; and a by^usiness, the same is found in Religion also.

There are that give themselves to the Lord,^^ Cor. 8. 5. whose conversation or
trade is (...) heaven, Phil. 3. 18. the end or scope of whose life is Christ,
Heb. 13. 7, 8. who gi^ Religion the precedence both in time a^ affection, Psalm.
5. 3. Romans 12. 11. who are constant and indefatigable in the work of (...)
Lord, 1 Cor. 15. 58.

And there are also that take up Religi^^ rather for ostentation, than for an
occupati^^ who never mind the duties of Religion, b^ when they have nothing
else to do; a^ when their outward man is engaged in t^ duties of it, yet their
heart is not in i^ they hear, they pray, (...), as Ch^^ sostome speaks, but
their souls, their though^ and minds are abroad. It is not their bu^^^ness to
have fellowship with God in duties^ get their lusts mortified, their hearts
trye^ their souls conformed to the image of G^^ in holiness.

They pray as if they prayed not, and he as if they heard not: and if they feel
^ power in Ordinances, no quickening in (...), it is no disappointment at all
to the^ for these were not their designs in drawi^^ nigh to God in these
appointments.

And thus you see what numbers of Profesessours deceive themselves.

SECT III.
ANd if we seriously enquire into (...) grounds and causes of this self dec^^
among professors, we shall find these (...) conspiring to delude and cheat
them, (...) the great concern of their salvation.

1. First, The natural deceitfulness of the ^eart, than which nothing is more
treach^ous, and false, Ier. 17. 9. The heart is de^eitful above all things, and
desperately ^icked (...) Supplanta^^vum cor prae omnibus, Ar. Mont.
the heart is ^e greatest supplanter, the most crafty and ^btil cheat of all,
it deceives us as Jacob ^d his brother, (to whose name this text ^ludes.) It
defeats us of our heavenly heri^age, as Jacob supplanted him in his earthly
^ne; while we are gone a hunting after ^arthly trifles. And wherein its
deceitfulness ^rincipally appears, you may see by the so^mn Caveat of the
Apostle James, 1. 22. where^ he warns us to beware, that in hearing ^he word we
deceive not our selves by false ^easonings; for so (...) imports, and may be
strictly rendered, false reasoning themselves, namely, by making false
syllogis^s: ^hereby they mis-conclude about their spiri^ual and eternal estate
and condition, and be^ool themselves.

The time will come when a man's own ^eart will be found to have the chief hand
^n his ruin; and what Apollodorus did but ^ancy his heart said to him, some
men's hearts will tell them in earnest when they come to ^he place of misery and
torment; (...) (...). I have been the cause of all this^^^ I have betrayed thee
into all these torment^ It was my laziness, my credulity, my ave^^^ seness to
the ways of strict godliness, morti^^fication, and self denial have for ever
undon^ thee. When thou satest under the convincin^ truths of the Gospel; It was
I that whispere^ those Atheistical surmises into thine ear, per^^swading thee
all thou heardst was but the intemperate heat of an hot brained zealo^ when the
Judgments of God were denoun^^ced, and the misery thou now feel fore^
warned and threatened, it was I that whis^pered what the tongue of another onc^
spoke out, Tunc credam, cum illuc venero. I will believe it when I come ^hither.

Surely this is a great truth which was ob^served by the wisest of men, he that
trustet^ in his own heart is a fool, Prove. 28. 26. and thousands of such fools
are to be found amon^ Professors.

2. Secondly, Satan is a chief conspirato^ in this treacherous design; we are
not ignoran^ (says the the Apostle) of his devices; (...) his Sophistry and
sleights, 2 Cor. 2. 21. his (...), trains and methods of temptation^ which are
thoughly studied, and artificially molded and ordered; even such Systems as^
Tutors and Professors of Arts and Science^ have, and read over to their
Auditors; a^ one judiciously observes, to be the impor^^ of that Text, Ephesians. 6.
11. Nor it is to be wondered at, Dr. Goodwin Child of Light^
considering his vast knowledge, deep malice, and long experience in this Art
of cheating; together with the great corruption and pronity of the hearts of
men to close with his devices, and believe his impostures; that so vast a
number of souls are take captive by him at his will, 2 Timothy 2. 26.

It Is the God of this world that blinds the minds of them that beleve not, 2
Cor. 4. 3, 4. The God of this world, (so called by a Mimesis) who leads a world
of poor deluded wretches to destruction, having first blinded their minds, that
is deluded, and with his hellish art practiced upon their understanding, that
(...), leading and directive faculty, which is to the soul what eyes are to the
body.

I remember Basil brings in Satan thus insulting Christ, I have them, I have
them: for all thy blood and miracles, thy wooings and beseechings, thy
knockings and strivings, I have couzened thee of them at the very gates of
Heaven: for all their illuminations, and tasting of the powers of the World to
come; I have shipwrackt them in the very mouth of the haven.

3. Thirdly, The common works found in unregenerate souls, deceive many, who
cannot distinguish them from the special works of the spirit in Gods Elect: see
that startlin^^ Scripture, Heb. 6. 4. where you find among the common
operations of the Spirit upon Apostates, illumination, which gives perspicuity
to their minds in discerning spiritua^ truths, and that frequently with more
distinctness and depth of Judgment, thansom^^ gracious souls attain unto;
besides, it is the matter out of which many rare and excellent gifts are formed
in admirable variety* which are singularly useful to others as they are
exercised in expounding the Scriptures (...) de^ending the truths of Christ by
solid arguments, preaching, praying, etc. and make the subject of them renowned
and honored in the Church of God; whilst mean time, they are d^zled with
their own splendor, and fatally ruined by them.

There you find also Tasting as well as enlightening. So that they seem to
abound not only in knowledge, but in sense also, ( i. e.) i^ some kind of
experience of what they know; for experience is the bringing of things to the
Test of spiritual sense. They do tast^^ or experience the good that comes by
the promises of the word, and discoveries of heaven and glory; though they feel
not experimentally the transforming efficacy of these things upon their own
souls.

Now that illumination furnishing them with excellent gifts (as before was
noted) enabling them to Assent to Gospel truth's, which the Scripture calls
faith, Acts 8. 12. and working in them conviction of sin, 1 Samuel 15. 24.
reformation of life, 2 Pet. 2. 2^. and touching their affections also with
transient joy in the discovery of those truth^.

And this Taste which comes so near to the experience which the sanctified soul
enjoyes: these things seem to put their condition beyond all controversy, and
lay a foundation for their ill built confidence; nothing is more apt to beget
and nourish such a Confidence than the meltings and workings of our affections
about spiritual things; for as a grave Divine has well observed, Mr. A. Burges.
such a man seems to have all that is required of a Christian, and to have
attained the very end of all knowledge, which is operation and influence upon
the affections. When they shall find heat in their affections, as well as light
in their minds; how apt are they to say (as these self-deceivers in the Text
did) they are rich, and have need of nothing! Now of all the false signs of
grace, by which men cousen themselves, none are so dangerous and destructive to
souls, as those that come nearest true ones: never does Satan more effectually
and securely manage his cheats, than when he is transformed into an Angel of
light.

Among this sort of self-deceivers, how many gifted men, and among that sort
some im^^ployed in the office of the Ministry, will b^ found! whose daily
employment being about spiritual things, studying, preaching, pray^ing etc.
conclude themselves sanctified persons, because they are versant about sacre^
employments, as if the subject must be, be^^cause the object is sacred. Oh that
suc^ would seriously ponder those two Scripture^ Mat. 7. 22. Many will say unto
me in tha^ day, Lord, Lord; have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name
have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful things and I Cor. 9
27. -- lest that by any mean^ when I have preached unto others, I my self
should be a cast away.

4. Lastly, To add here no more, this strength^^ens self deceit exceedingly in
many, viz^ their observations of and comparing them^selves with others. Thus
the Pharisees, (thos^ gross self deceivers) trusted in themselves tha^ they
were righteous and despised others, Luke 18^^ 9. their low rating of others,
gave them tha^ high rate and value of themselves: and thu^ the proverb is made
good, regnat luscus inte^c^cos, he that has but one eye, is a King among the
blind.

Thus the false Apostles cheated and be^^ fooled themselves, 2. Cor. 10. 12.
but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among
themselves, are not wi^e. God has not made one Man a measure or ^^andard to
another Man, but his Word is ^he common beam or scale to try all Men.

These Men are as sharp sighted to note o^^er Men's evils, as their own
excellencies, (...) eye the miscarriages of others with derisi^^, and their own
performances with admira^^on.

They bless themselves when they behold ^^e profane in their impieties, Luke
18. 11. God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, Unjust,
Adulterers, or even as this ^ublican, q. d. O what a Saint am I in com^arison
of these miscreants! The Pharisees Religion you see runs all upon nots; a
nega^^ve holiness is enough to him; and the mea^^re he takes of it is by
comparison of himself, with others more externally vile than himself. A
Christian may say with praise and humility, I am not as some men are, but
^^ough he know nothing by himself, yet is he ^ot thereby justified, 1 Cor. 4.
4. he neithe^^ ^akes together the enormities of the vilest, on ^he infirmities
of the holiest to justify and ^pplaud himself as these Self deceivers do. And
these are the causes and occasions of that general deception, under which so
great a ^art of the professing World bow down, and perish.

SECT. IV.
3. IN the last place I shall prove this po^variously according to the
importan^ and usefulness of it, with as much brevi^ and closeness of
Application as I can: An^

Use. 1. Shall be for Caution to Professon before I tell you what use you
should man of it, I must tell you what use you may n^ make of it.

First, Don't make this use of it, to conclude from what has been said, that
all P^fessors are but a pack of Hypocrites, and the there is no Truth nor
Integrity in any Man this is both intolerable arrogance to ascen^ the Throne of
God, and unparalled Unch^^^ritableness to judge the hearts of all Men.

Some Men are as apt to conclude others ^ be Hypocrites, by measuring their
hearts b^ their own, as others are to conclude the^^selves Saints, by comparing
their own exce^ lencies with other Men's corruptions: but ble^sed be God there
is some grain among the heap of chaff, some true Diamonds amon^ the counterfeit
Stones. The Devil has no^ the whole piece; a remnant according (...) election
belongs really to the Lord.

2. Secondly, Don't make this use of it, tha^ assurance must needs be
impossible, becau^^ so many Professors are found to be Self de^ceivers.

That assurance is one of the great diffi^^lties in Religion, is a great truth;
but that is therefore unattainable in this World, is ^ery false. Popish
Doctrine indeed makes it ^possible, but that Doctrine is practically ^nfuted in
the comfortable experience ^ many Souls: all are commanded to ^^ive for it: 2
Pet. 1. 10. give diligence to ^ake your calling and Election sure: and some
^ave the happiness to obtain it: 2 Timothy 1. 12. (...) I know whom I have
believed, and I am per^aded that he is able to keep that which I have ^^mmitted
unto him against that day.

Let the Similar works upon Hypocrites re^mble as much as they will the saving
works ^ the Spirit upon Believers; yet God does ways, and the Saints do
sometimes plainly ^scern the difference.

3. Thirdly, Don't make this use of it, to ^^ceal and hide the Truths or Graces
of ^od, or refuse to profess, and confess them be^^re Men, because many
Professors deceive ^^emselves and others also; by a vain Pro^^ssion, because
another professes what he ^^th not, must you therefore hide or deny that you
have? It Is true, the possession of ^race and Truth in your own Souls is that
which saves you; but the profession and con^ssion of it, is that which honors
God, and (...); yea, sometimes is the instrument to (...) others: it is your
comfort that you feel it, it is others comfort to know that you so. Ostentation
is your sin, but a serious (...) humble profession is your duty, Romans 10. ^

SECT. V.
Use. 2. HAving showed you in the for^ Section what use you ought no^ make of
this Doctrine, I will next show ^ what use you ought to make of it; and su^ you
cannot improve this point to a be^ purpose than from it to take warni^^ and
look to your selves, that you be ^ of that number who deceive themselves (...)
their Profession. If this be so, suffer me clo^^^ to press that great
Apostolical Caution. I ^ 10. 12. Let him that thinks he stands, take h^ lest he
fall. O Professors, look carefully your foundation; be not high minded, ^ fear:
you have it may be done and suffer many things in and for Religion; you h^
excellent gifts, and sweet comforts, a wa^ zeal for God, and high confidence of
y^ integrity; all this may be right (for ou^^^ I or (it may be) you know) but
yet it is p^^^ sible it may be false also; you have so^^times judged your
selves, and pronoun^^ your selves upright; but remember your ^^^nal Sentance is
not yet pronounced by yo^ Judge. And what if God weigh you over ^^gain in his
more equal balance, and should ^ Mean tekel, thou art weighed in the ballan^
art found wanting; What a confounded ^an will thou be under such a Sentance!
(...) splendent in conspectu hominis, sordent in ^spectu Iudicis; things that
are highly e^emed of Men, are an abomination in the ^ht of God; he sees not as
Man sees.

Thy Heart may be false, and thou not ^ow it; yea, it may be false, and thou
^ongly confident of its Integrity.

The Saints may approve thee, and God ^ndemn thee, Rev. 3. 1. Thou have a name
^at thou live but thou art dead: Men may (...) there is a true Nathanael, and
God may (...), there is a self-couzening Pharisee.

Reader, thou have heard of Judas and Demas, ^ Ananias and Sapphira, of
Hymeneus and Phile^; once renowned and famous Professors, thou have heard what
they proved at last. ^^Take heed their case be not thine own; (...) they not
all as it were with one mouth (...) to thee, O Professor! if thou will not ^me
where we are, don't cousen thy self (...) we did: if thou expectest a better
place ^^^d lot, be sure thou get a sincerer Heart: ^^^d we been more
self-suspicious, we had ^^^en more safe.

I would not scare you with needless jealou^s, but I would fain prevent fatal
mistakes. ^on't you find your hearts deceitful in ma^y things? Don't they
shuffle over secret ^^^uties? Don't they ^ensure the same evils in others,
which they scarce reprove in yo^ selves? Are there not many by ends in d^^^
ties? Don't you find they are far less affect^ with a great deal of service and
honor do^ to God by others, than with a little by yo^^selves?

Is it not hard to look upon other Me^ excellencies without envy, or upon your
o^^ without pride?

And are you not troubled with a busy (...) as well as with a bad Heart? Has
(...) he that circuits the whole World observ^ you? Has he not studied your
constitu^^^on sins, and found out that sin which m^^easily besets you? Has he
less malice ^^gainst your Souls than others? Surely y^ are in the very thick of
temptations; tho^^sands of snares are round about you. Oh ho^ difficul^y are
the Righteous saved! How ha^ to be upright! How few even of the prof^^^sing
World win Heaven at last!

Otherefore search your hearts, Professor^ and let this caution go down to your
ve^^reins; let him that thinks he stands, take he^ lest be fall.

Away with rash uncharitable censures (...) others, and be more just and severe
i^cen^^^ring your selves. Away with dry and unp^fitable controversies, and
spend your thoug^ upon this great question, Am I sound, or a^ I rotten at
heart? am I a new Creature, (...) old Creature still in a new Creatures dress
^d habit? B^g the Lord that you be not ^eceived in that great point (your
inte^ity) whatever else you may be mistaken (...). Pray that you be not given
up to an ^eedless, careless, and vain Spirit, and then ^ave Religious duties
for a Rattle to still and ^^iet your Consciences.

Surely, that groundwork can never be ^id too sure, upon which so great a
stress as ^^y soul and eternity must depend. It will ^ot repent thee (I dare
promise) when thou ^omest to die, that thou have employed thy ^me and strength
to this end: whilst o^ers are panting after the dust of the Earth, and saying,
who will show us any good? be ^ou panting after the assurances of the love ^f
God, and crying who will show me how (...) make my calling and election sure?

O deceive not your selves with names and ^otions! think not, because you are
for a ^^^ricter way of Worship, or because you as^cia^e with (and are
accordingly denomi^ated) one of the more reformed Professors; ^^at therefore
you are safe enough: alas! how ^^all an interest have titles, modes, and
de^omi^^tions in Religion? Suppose a curious Artist take a lump of Lead and
refine it, and ^ast it into the Mould; whence it comes ^orth shining, and
bearing some noble figure, ^uppose of an Eagle, yet it is but a leaden Eagle.
Suppose the Figure of a Man, and that (...) the most exact lineaments and
proportion (...) yet still is it but a leaden Man. Nay, let (...) bear the
Figure of an Angel, it is but a lead^^ Angel: for the base and ignoble matter
(...) the same it was, though the Figure be no^^ Even so, Take an Unregenerate
carnal Man let his life be reformed, and his tongue r^^fined; and cale him a
zealous Conformist, (...) a strict Nonconformist; call him a Presbyter^^ an,
an Independent or what you will; he (...) all the while but a carnal
Conformist, (...) Nonconformist; an unregenerate Presbyt^^ rian, a carnal
Independent; for the nature (...) still the same, though the stamp and figu^^
his Profession gives him, be not the same.

O my Friends believe it, fine names, an^ brave words, are of little value with
Go^ God will no more spare you for these, tha^ Samuel did Agag for his delicate
Ornament^ and spruce appearance: either make su^ the root of the matter, or the
leaves of a va^^ Profession will not long cover you.

To be deceived by another is bad enoug^ but to deceive our selves is a
thousand tim^^ worse.

To deceive our selves in truths of the S^^ perstructure is bad, and they that
do so sha^^ suffer loss; 1 Cor. 3. 12. but to deceive (...) selves in the
foundation is a desperate decei^^ and shipwracks all our hope and happine^^ at
once.

If any Man lose his Money by a cheat it ^ubles him, but to lose his Soul by a
cheat will ^^ound him: if a Man lose an Eye, an Ear, Hand, a Foot; yet omnia
Deus dedit dupli^^^^, as Chrysostom speaks; God has given ^^ese Members
double; so that there is ano^^er left; animan vero unam; but the Soul is (...),
and only one, and if that be damned, ^ou have not another to be saved.

O therefore be restless till it be, and till ^ou know it be out of eternal
danger.

SECT. VI.
^se 3. IN conclusion, if so many Professors of Religion be cheated in their
^rofession, let all that are well satisfied and ^^sured of their integrity
bless the Lord ^hil'st they live, for that ^ercy. O it is a mercy that no
unsanctified Soul can have; ^ea, and it is a mercy that many gracious Souls
cannot obtain, though they seek it with ^ears; and would part with all the
pleasant ^^ings they have in the World to enjoy it.

This is that mercy that gives Souls the ^ighest pleasures this World is
acquainted ^ith, or the state of this mortality can bear: ^or let the well
assured Soul but consider that it is assured of: Christ with the purchases ^f
his Blood. O what is this! I am my belo^eds, and my beloved is mine, Cant. 2.
16. what ^ vital ravishing overpowering efficacy is in that voice of Faith. Let
it but look back (...) few Years, and compare what it was wi^^ what it is: it
was afar off, it is now ma^^ nigh, Ephesians. 2. 12, 13. It was not belove^ but is
now beloved, Romans 25. 26. it had n^ obtaine^ mercy, but now has obtained
mercy, 1 Pet. 2. 10. or let the assured So^ look forward and compare what it
now i^ and has, with what it shortly shall be mad^ and put in possession of:
Beloved, (says the Apostle) now are we the Sons of God, but (...) does not yet
appear what we shall be: but w^ know that when he shall appear, we shall be
lik^ him, for we shall see him as he is, 1 John. 3. (...)

I say, let the assured Soul but sleep i^ thoughts by meditation in these
subjects, an^ it is as impossible to keep him from h^^ transports of Joy, as it
is for a Man to for^bear laughing when he is tickled.

O what a life have you in comparison o^ other Men? Some have two Hells, one
present, another coming; you have two Heavens; one in hand, the other in hope.
Some of your own brethren in Christ, that have been it may be many years
panting after assurance, are still denied it; but God has indulged so peculiar
a favor to you. ^ Bless ye the Lord, and make his praise glorious.

CHAP. III.
Containing the Proof and Improvement of ^ct. 2 That true Grace is exceeding
precious, and greatly enricheth the Soul that has it: it is Christ's Gold.
^^CT. I.
THE Lord Jesus here chooses the most pure, precious, re^endent, durable, and
valuable thing, in (...) the Treasuries, and magazines of Nature, (...) shadow
forth saving Grace, which is ^^nitely more excellent: certainly that ^^ft be
the best thing, which the best ^^^ngs in Nature can but imperfectly sha^^w
forth. What was the golden Oil emp^d through the two golden pipes, Zech. 4. but
the precious Graces of God, flowing ^^ough Christ, into all his Members! Gold
^^recious, but one dram of saving grace more precious than all the Gold of
Oph^r. cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver ^weighed for the price
thereof, Job 28. 15. ^ely Gold and Silver, Saphires, Diamonds (...) Rubies are
not worth the mentioning, ^^en saving Grace is once mentioned. For ^^^sider it,

First, In its cause, and fountain from ^^ence it flows; and you shall find it
to be (...) fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5. 22. who upon (...) account is called
the Spirit of Grace, Heb. 10. 29. It derives its original from the (...) high;
it is Spirit born of Spirit, Io^. 3. 6. (...) the rules of Morality, all humane
dilige^^ and industry can never produce one gr^^ ous habit or act alone, 2 Cor.
3. 5. Not (...) we are sufficient of our selves, etc.

Nay, we speak not becoming the inco^^ parable worth of grace, when we say, it
is (...) fruit and birth of the Spirit; for so are co^^ mon gifts also. There
are several emanati^^ from this Sun, diverse streams from this fo^^ tain; but of
all his operations and produ^^^^ ons, this of saving grace is the most noble
(...) excellent. Gifts are from the spirit as we^^ grace, but grace is more
excellent than (...) best gifts, 1 Cor. 12. 31. covet earnestly the (...)
gifts, and yet show I unto you a more exce^^^^ way. Hence you read in Phil. 1.
10. of th^^ that are excellent, or as the original, (...) might be rendered,
things that (...) Namely, in respect of excellency; no^ good and evil, but as
less good, and (...) good differ. Gifts have their value and (...) ciousness,
but the best gifts differ as (...) from grace, as brass from gold; though (...)
be generated by the influence of same (...) Gifts (as one says) are dead
graces, but (...) are living gifts: it is the most excel^^^^ production of the
highest and most ex^^^^ lent cause.

2. Secondly, Consider it in its nature, (...) ^^u will find it Divine* 2 Pet.
1. 4. partakers (...) the Divine Nature, viz. in our Sanctificati^^ not that it
gives us the Properties of the ^^ivine nature, they are incommunicable; ^^t the
similitude, and resemblance of it is ^^amped upon our souls, in the work of
grace.

The new man is renewed in knowledge, after ^^e image of him that created him,
Col. 3. 10. The Schoolmen and some of the Fathers place ^^is image or
resemblance of God, in the ^atural faculties of the soul, viz. the
under^^anding, memory and will; which is an ^^brage of a Trinity in Unity: but
it rather ^^onsists in the renovation of the Faculties by ^race; for in this we
bear the Divine Image upon our Souls, and that Image or Resem^^ance of God in
Holiness, is the beauty ^^d honor of our Souls.

It is their beauty, How fair, and how plea^^nt art thou O love for delights!
says Christ of ^is People, Cant. 7. 6. Natural beauty con^^sts in the
Symmetry, and comely proportion ^f parts each with other; Spiritual beauty
(...) the harmony or agreeableness of our souls ^o God: and as it is our
chiefest beauty, so ^ertainly it is our highest honor; for it gives ^s access
unto God, who is the Fountain of Honor and Glory; and this makes the righte^us
more excellent than his neighbor; let his Neighbor be what he will, though the
blood ^f Nobles run in his Veins, the righteous is more excellent than he;
except saving gra^^ be also diffused into his soul.

3. Thirdly, Consider it in its receipient su^^ ject, and you will find its
value still to increase for the precious oil of Saving Grace is never poured
into any other than an elect vessel.

Hence faith, one branch of sanctification is with respect to its subject,
styled the Faith (...) Gods Elect, Tit. 1. 1. Whosoever finds tru^ grace in his
Soul, may (during the eviden^^ thereof) from it strongly conclude his E^
lection, looking backward, and his Salvation looking forward, Romans 8. 30. it
marks an^ seals the Person in whom it is for glory. Go^ has set apart him that
is godly for himself. Ps. 4. 3*

4. Fourthly, View the precious worth o^ grace in its excellent effects and
influences up^ on the soul, in which it inheres.

(1.) It adorns it with incomparable Orna^ ments, which are of great price in
the sigh^ of God, 1 Pet. 3. 4. yea it reflects such beam^ of Glory in the soul
where its seat is, Tha^ Christ himself the Author, is also the Admire^ of it,
Cant. 4. 9. Thou have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou have
ravished my heart, wit^ one of thine eyes, with one of the chains of the neck.
And as one overcome with its excelling beauty, he says, Turn away thine eyes
from me, for they have overcome me, Cant. 6. 5.

(2.) It Elevates and ennobles a Man's Spirit beyond all other principles in
Man. It se^^ (...) heart and affections upon Heaven, and (...) them up with the
glory of the invisible ^^rld, Phil. 3. 20. But our conversation is in ^^ven,
from whence we look for a Savior. ^^il'st others are trading for Corn, and
Wine; (...) Sheep and Oxen; for Feathers and Trifles; (...) gracious Soul is
trading with God for par^^^ and peace; for Righteousness and Life; (...) Glory
and Immortality. Truly our fellow^^ is with the Father, and with his Son Christ
(...), 1 John 1. 3.

(3.) It does not only raise the Spirit by ^^versing with God, and things
above; but ^^^sforms the soul, by that converse, into (...) likeness of those
heavenly Objects it con^^ seth with. It changes them into the same ^^ge, 2
Cor. 3. 18. so that though the san^^^^ed Man still remains, the who he was,
(...) not the what he was before, the very ^^^per of his spirit is altered.

(4.) It does not only transform the soul in ^^ich it is, but preserves the
subject in which (...): it is a singular preservative from sin; that though sin
be in them still, and works them still; yet it cannot prevail in them (...) to
fulfill the lusts of it, as it was want to (...) Gal. 5. 17. Sin conceives, but
cannot (...) fo^^h fruit unto death; this gives it a (...) carrying womb.

(5.) It does not only preserve it from sin, (...) Grace establishes the soul
in whom it is, far beyond any other Arguments without; or any other principles
within a Man. It is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, Heb.
13. 9. This is that which the Apostle calls our own stedfastness; or that
ballast we have within our selves; which keeps us tite and stable. O the
excellencies of Grace!

(6) To conclude, it is the root of all that precious fruit which we bring
forth to God in this World. It is the root of every gracious word in our lips,
and of every gracious work in our hands: be the matter of our gracious thoughts
never so excellent, the matter of our heavenly discourses and prayers never so
sweet; still grace is the root of the matter; Job 19. 28. O then what a
precious thing is grace!

5. Fifthly, View it in its properties, and you will soon discover its
transcendent excellencies: the richest Epithets are no Hyperboles here, we
speak not beyond the value of it, when we call it Supernatural Grace, for so it
is. It comes down from above, from the Father of Lights, Iam. 1. 17. nature can
never be improved to that height, how much soever its Admirers boast of it: nor
do we strain too high, when we call it immortal grace; for so God has made it:
this is that water which springs up in the sanctified soul into eternal life,
John 4. 14. It will not dye when thou die, but ascend with the soul from
which it is inseparable; and be swallowed up with it into glory, Romans 8. 10.
you may out live your friends, you may outlive your Estates, you may outlive
your Gifts; but you cannot outlive your Graces.

Shall I say it is the most sweet and comfortable thing that ever the soul was
acquainted with in this World, next Jesus Christ, the Author and Fountain of
it? Sure if I so speak, I have as many witnesses to attest it, as there be
gracious souls in the World: nothing is more comfortable than grace, except
Christ, and yet without grace no soul can feel the comforts of Christ, in the
troubles of life, or in the straits of death: this is a spring of comfort.

6. Sixthly, Consider it in its design and scope; and you will still discern
more and more of its precious excellency: for what is the aim and end of God in
the infusions and improvements of Grace, but to attemper and mould our Spirits
by it, into a meetness and fitness for the enjoyment of himself in the world to
come? Col. 1. 12. giving thanks to the Father, who has made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light* compare this with 2 Cor.
5. 5. now he that has wrought us for the self-same thing is God.

O blessed design! how precious must that work be, which is wrought for so high
and glorious a purpose as this is! no work more excellent, no end more noble.

7. Seventhly, Consider the means and ^^^ struments both principal, and
subordinate, i^^ ployed in this work: many blessed instr ^^ments are set on
work to beget, conserv^ and improve it in our souls: and these (...) speak the
precious worth of it: no wise man will dig for a base and worthless metal, wit^
golden mattocks. The blood of Christ w^^ shed to procure it, Heb. 13. 12.

The Spirit of God is sent forth to form an^ create it; for it is his own
workmanship Ephesians. 2. 10. his fruit, Gal. 5. 22.

The Ordinances and Officers of the Gosp^^ were at first instituted, and ever
since continued in the Church, for this works sake John 17. 17. and Ephesians. 4. 12.
it is the fruit (...) Christ's blood; yea, and it has cost the swea^ and blood
of the dispensers of the Gospel too*

Nay, all the works of Providence look this way; and aim at this thing, Romans 8.
28. What is the errand of all Gods rods, but to make us partakers of his
holiness? Heb. 12. 10*

8. Eighthly, The high value that the most high God sets upon grace, shows it to
be an excellent thing indeed: it is of great price in his sight, 1 Pet. 3. 4.
no service finds acceptance with God, but what is performed by grace: none but
sanctified vessels, are meet for the Masters use. The end of the Commandment is
Charity, out of a pure heart, 1 Timothy* 1. 5.

The weakest performances of grace find acceptance with him, though clogged with
many sinful weaknesses and infirmities, Heb. 11. 31, 32. if God so prize it,
well may we: he that made the Jewel, best understands the value of it.

9. Ninthly, The Hypocritical pretenses made to it all over the professing
world, show what a most precious and desirable thing it is: if there were not
some singular glory in it, why does every one covet to be reputed gracious? nay
the Devil himself baits many of his hooks of temptation with a show of grace:
for he knows sin has no native beauty of its own to entice; and therefore he
borrows the paint and pretense of holiness, to cover it: but O what a dilemma
will the Hypocrite be posed with at last? and how can he answer it when God
shall demand.

If grace were evil, why did thou so affect the name and reputation of it?
And if it were good, why did thou satisfy thy self with the empty name and
shadow of it only?

10. Tenthly, To conclude; The incomperable esteem that all good men have for
it, shows it to be a thing of inestimable price.

Grace is the sum of all their prayers, the scope of all their endeavors, the
matter of their chief Joy, the reward of their afflictions and sufferings.
Their chief Ioys and sorrows, hopes and fears in this World, are taken up about
it: by all which it appears that its price is above Rubies; and all the Gold
and Silver in the World are but dung and dross in comparison with it.

SECT. II.
Containing six practical inferences from this Precious Truth.

Infer. 1. Is saving grace more precious than Gold? Let them that have it bless
God for it, and not boast: Men's hearts are as apt to puff up and swell with
spiritual, as with material gold: it is hard to be an owner of much of this
gold, and not be lifted up with it. To keep down thy heart, and preserve thine
eyes from being* dazzled with these their gracious excellencies; it will be
needful for thee Christian sometime to consider,

That although Grace be one of the most excellent things that ever God created,
yet it is but a Creature, a dependent thing, 1 Cor. 5. 17.

Yea, it is not only a Creature, but a very imperfect creature yet in thy soul;
laboring under many weaknesses, Phil. 3. 12. and sometimes ready to die, Rev.
3. 2.

Though it can do many things for you, yet it cannot Justify you before God:
you cannot make a garment of to cover your guilt, not plead the dignity of it
at Gods bar for your discharge; it is not your inherent, but Christ's imputed
righteousness must do that for you; though in other respects it be very
necessary.

Nay, remember; how excellent soever it be, it is not the native growth and
product of your hearts; all the grace you have is foraign to your Natures; and
what you have, is received, 1 Cor. 4. 7.

And Lastly, remember he that is most proud and conceited of his own graces,
will be found to be the owner of least grace, and has most cause to question,
whether he have any or no. It Is the nature of grace to humble, abase and empty
the Soul; and it is the strength of our Corruptions which thus puffs us up with
vain conceits.

Infer. 2. Is Saving Grace more excellent than gold? what cause then have the
poorest Christians to be well satisfied with their lot? To others God has
given Ishmael's portion the fatness of the Earth; to you Isaac's, the graces of
their Covenant: the portion is paid in brass, yours in gold: many of you are
poor in the World, but rich in faith; and heirs of the Kingdom which God has
promised, Jam. 2. 5. what is the dust of the Earth, to the fruits of the
Spirit? you are troubled that you have no more of the World; it may be if you
had more gold, you would have less grace: you consider not how many are poor
and wretched in both worlds; moneyless, and Christless too: you don't consider
you are near come to that state, in which all your wants will be fully
supplied; where you shall not need the treasures of the Earth, and have your
desires satisfied out of the treasures of grace and glory.

Infer. 3. Is Saving Grace Gold, yea infinitely more precious than Gold? then
surely declining Christians are great losers, and have cause to be great
mourners. The remission of the least degree of Grace, is more to be lamented
than the loss of the greatest sum of Gold.

Though the habits of Grace be not lost; yet the Acts of Grace may be
suspended, 2 Samuel 12. 31. The degrees of grace may be remitted, Rev. 3. 3. The
evidences of grace may be clouded, and consequently the Comforts of grace may
be suspended, Isa. 50. 10. and the least of these is such a loss, as all the
treasures of the Earth cannot repair: well therefore may declined Christians
challenge the first place among all the mourners in the world.

Infer. 4. Is grace so invaluably precious? How precious then ought the
ordinances of God to be to our souls, by which grace is first communicated, and
afterward improved in our souls! The law of thy mouth is better unto me than
thousands of gold and silver, Psalm. 119. 72. and good reason, whilst it
imparts and improves that to which Gold and Silver is but d^oss and dung.

None but those that value not Grace, will ever slight the means, or despite
and injure the instruments thereof. It Is a sad sign of a graceless world, when
these precious things fall under contempts and slights.

Infer. 5. If Grace be so precious how watchful should all gracious persons be
in the dates of temptation! the design of temptation is to rob you of your
treasure: when Cut-purses get into the crowd, we use to say; Friends, look to
your purses. How many brave Christians have we read and heard of, that have
rather chosen to part with their lives, than with their graces, who have
resisted unto blood, striving against sin? Heb. 12. 4.

O Christians, you live in a cheating Age, many seeming Christians have lost
all, and many real Christians have lost much so much, that they are like to see
but little comfort in this World: who are like to go mourning to the Grave with
that Lamentation, Job. 29. 2, 3. O that it were with me as in times past!

Infer. 6. To Conclude. Is there such precious worth in saving Grace? then
bless God for, and diligently use all means to increase and improve it in your
souls. It Is Gold for preciousness, and for usefulness; and must not be laid up
in a Napkin: that is a sin condemned by the very scope of that Parable, Mat. 25.
14, 15, etc.

All Christians indeed have not the same advantages of improvement, but all
must improve it according to the advantages they have in order to an account.
Reserved Christians who live too abstracted from the Society and Communion of
others, and disperse not their streams abroad to the benefit of others; nor
improve the graces of others for their own benefit, are wanting both to their
own duty and comfort. See you a Man rich in grace; O trade with him if you can,
to improve your selves by him; and the rather, because you know not how soon
death may snatch him from you, and with him all his stock of Grace is gone from
you too, except what you made your own whilst you conversed with him: but alas,
alas! instead of holy profitable soul-improving communion, some are sullenly
reserved; some are negligent and lazy; some are litigious and wrangling; more
apt to draw forth the dross, than the Gold; I mean the Corruptions, than Graces
of others. And how few there be that drive a profitable trade for increase of
grace, is sad to consider.

And as grace is not improved by communion with men, so I doubt most Christians
thrive but little in their communion with God: we are too seldom in our
Closets, too little upon our knees, and when we are there, we gain but little,
we come not off such gainers by duty as we might. O Christians, think when you
are hearing, and praying, I am now trading with Heaven for that which is
infinitely better than Gold. God is rich to all that call upon him, what a
treasure may I get this hour, if the fault be not in my one heart? And thus of
the second observation.

CHAP. IV.
Wherein the third Doctrine, being the main subject of this Treatise is opened,
and the method of the whole discourse stated.
Doct. 3. That only is to be accounted true grace which is able to endure all
those trials appointed or permitted for the discovery of it.
SECT. I.
THE most wise God has seen it fit to set all his people in a state of trial
in this world. First, he tryes, and then he Crowns them. Jam. 1. 12. Blessed is
the man that endures temptation, (...), (i. e.) probation or tryal] for when
he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, etc.

No man can say what he is, whether his graces be true or false, till they be
tried and examined by those things which are to them as fire is to gold. These
self-deceivers in the Text, thought they had grace; yea they thought they had
been rich in grace; but it proved no better than dross: and therefore Christ
here counsels them to buy of him gold tried in the fire, (i. e.) true grace
indeed, which appears to be so upon the various proofs and examinations of its
sincerity which are to be made in this world, as well as in the great solemn
trial it must come to in the world to come.

The Scriptures speak of a twofold trial, viz. A trial of men's Opinions and
Graces.


1. First, The opinions and Judgments of men are tried as by fire, in which
sense we are to understand that place, 1 Cor. 3. 12, 13. Now if any man build
upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones; wood, hay, stubble every
man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it
shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort
it is.

This text speaks of such persons as hold the foundation of Christianity, but
yet superstructed such doctrines and practices, as were no more able to endure
the Trial, than hay, Dum probantur toti in fumum abeunt.
wood, or stubble can endure the fire. Such a person hereby brings himself into
danger, and though the Apostle will not deny the possibllity, yet he asse^ts
the difficulty of his salvation: he shall be saved, Quo ex judicio velut ex
incendio nuddus effugit. Chrysoft.
yet so as by fire, (i. e.) as a man is saved by leaping out of his house at
midnight when it is all on fire about his ears: for so that phrase imports,
Amos 4. 11. and Jude 23. glad to escape naked, and with the loss of his goods,
blessing God, he has his life for a prey: as little regard shall such have to
their erroneous notions, and unscriptural opinions at last.

2. Secondly, The graces of men are brought to the test as well as their
opinions. Trial will be made of their hearts, as well as of their heads; and
upon this trial the everlasting safety and happiness of the person depends: if
a man's opinions be some of them found hay or stubble, yet so long as he holds
the head, and is right in the foundation, he may be saved; but if a man's
supposed graces be found so, all the world cannot save him: there is no way of
escape if he finally deceive himself herein: and of this trial of Graces my
text speaks: Sincere Grace is Gold tried by fire.

There is a twofold trial of grace, Active, and Passive.

First, an Active trial of it, in which we try it our selves, 2 Cor. 13 5*
Examine your selves, prove your selves: (i. e.) measure your hearts, duties and
graces by the rule of the word; see how they answer to that rule, bring your
hearts and the word together by solemn self-examination: confer with your
reins, and commune with your own hearts.

Secondly, A Passive trial of it: whether we try it or no, God will t^y it, he
will bring our gold to the touchstone, and to the fire. Thou O Lord know me,
thou have seen me and tried mine heart toward thee, says the Prophet, Ier.
12. 3.

Sometimes he tryes the strength and ab^lity of his servants graces, and thus
he try Abraham, Heb. 11. 17. and sometimes (...) tryes the soundness and
sincerity of our grace so the Ephesian Angel was tried, and foun^ dross, Rev.
2. 2. And so Job was tried an^ found true gold, Job 23. 10. These trials a^ not
made by God for his own information for he knows what is in man, his eyes pier^
his heart and reins; but for our information which is the true sense of Deuteronomy.
8. 2. The shall remember all the way which the Lord the God led thee these
forty years in the wilderness humble thee, and to prove thee, to know wh^ was
in thy heart, (i. e.) to make thee know it, by giving thee such experiments and
try als of it in those wilderness straits and di^ ficulties.

And these are the trials of grace I am here to speak of, not excluding the
Active trials made by our selves; no, no, all these trials made by God upon us
are designed t^ put us upon the trial of our selves: when God tryes, we should
try too.

Now the method into which I shall ca^^ this discourse, shall be to show you,

1. First, What those things are which try the sincerity of our graces, as fire
tryes gold.

2. Secondly, For what ends does God pu^ the graces of his people upon such
trials in this world.

3. Thirdly, That such grace only is sin^ere as can endure these trials.

4. Fourthly and Lastly, To apply the whole, (...) the main uses of it.

SECT. II.
First, WHAT those things are which try the sincerity of grace, as fire ^yes
gold.

Before I enter into particulars, it will be ^eedful to acquaint you, that the
subject be^re me is full of difficulties. There is need as one speaks) of much
cautious respect to ^^e various sizes and degrees of growth a^ong Christians,
and the vicissitudes of their ^^ward case: else we may darken and per^lex the
way instead of clearing it.

The pourtracture of a Christian is such ^s none can draw to one Model, but
with ^espect to the infancy of some, as well as the ^ge and strength of others.

Great heed also ought to be had in the ap^lication of marks and signs, we
should first (...) them, before we try our selves, or others by ^^em, Marks and
signs are by some distinguish^d into exclusive, inclusive, and positive:
ex^^usive marks serve to shut out bold pretend^s, by showing them how far they
come ^^ort of a saving work of grace, and they are ^ommonly taken from some
necessary com^on duty, as hearing, praying, etc. he that does not these things,
cannot have any wo^^ of Grace in him; and yet if he do them, (...) cannot from
thence conclude his estate to (...) gracious: he that so concludes deceive
himself.

Inclusive Marks rather discover the degree^ than the truth of grace, and are
rather intended for comfort than for conviction: we find them in our selves, we
do not only find sincerity, but eminency of grace: they being taken from some
raised degree and (...) minent acts of grace in confirmed an^ grown Christians.

Betwixt the two former there is a midd^^ sort of marks, which are called
positive mark^ and they are such as are always and onl^ found in regenerate
souls. The Hypocrite has them not, the grown Christian has them, and that in
an eminent degree^ the poorest Christian has them in a lower but saving degree
great care must be taken in the application of them: and it is past doubt that
many wea^ and injudicious Christians have been greatly prejudiced by finding
the experiences of eminent Christians proposed as rules to measure their
sincerity by. Alas! these no more fit their ^ouls, than Saul's Armor did David's
body*

These things being premised, and a du^ care carried along with us through this
discourse; I shall next come to the particulars and show you what those things
are which discover the state and tempers of our souls. And though it be true,
that there is no condition we are in, no providence that befalls us, but it
takes some proof, and makes some discovery of our hearts: yet to limit this
discourse, and fall into particulars as soon as we can, I shall show what
Trials are made of our graces in this world, by our prosperity, and our
adversity, by our corruptions, and our duties: and lastly by our sufferings
upon the score and account of Religion.

SECT. III.
FIrst, Prosperity, Success, and the increase of outward enjoyments, are to
grace what fire is to gold. Riches and Honors make trial what we are, and by
these things many a false heart has been detected, as well as the sincerity
and eminency of others graces discovered: we may fancy the fire of prosperity
to be rather for comfort than trial; to refresh us rather than to prove us; but
you will find prosperity to be a great discovery; and that scarce any thing
proves the truth and strength of men's graces and corruptions more than it does:
Rara virtus est humilit as honorata, says Bernard, to find humility with
honor is to find a Phoenix; let an obscure person be lifted up to honor, and
how steady and well-composed soever he was before, it is a thousand to one but
his eyes will dazzle and his head run round when he is upon the lofty pinacl^ of
praise and honor: Magistratus indicat virum.
Prov^ 27. 21. As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a
man to his praise: pu^ the best gold into the fining pot of praise, and it is a
great wonder if a great deal of dros^ do not appear. Isa. 39. 2. the vain glory
o^ good Hezekia^ rose like a froth or scum upon the pot, when heated by
prosperity. It wa^ such a sining pot to Herod as discovered him to be dross its
self, Acts 12. 23. How did that poor worm swell under that trial into the
conceit of a God? and was justly destroyed by worms, because he forgot himself
to be one: we little think what a strange alteration an exalted estate will
make upon our spirits. When the Prophet would abate the vain confidence of
Hazael who could not believe that ever he should be turned into such a salvage
beast as the Prophet had foretold: he only tells him, The Lord has showed me
that thou shall be King over Syria, 2 King. 8. 13. The meaning is, don't be too
confident Hazael, that thy temper and disposition can never alter to that
degree, Thou never yet satest in a Throne; when men see the Crown upon thy
head, then they will better see the true temper of thy heart.

How humble was Israel in the Wilderness, tame and tractable in a lean pasture
^^^t bring them ^once into Canaan, and the orld is strangely altered; then, we
are Lords, ^y they, we will come no more unto thee, Jer. 2, 7, 31. Prosperity
is a Crisis both to ^ace and corruption. Thence is that caution (...) Israel,
Deuteronomy. 10. 11, 12. When thou have ^aten, and art full, Then beware lest thou
forget ^he Lord thy God. Then beware, that is the Critical time; surely that man
must be ac^nowledged rich, very rich in grace, whose grace suffers no
diminution or eclipse by his ^iches; and that man deserves double ho^our, whose
pride the honors of this world cannot provoke and inflame.

It was a sad truth from the lips of a pi^us divine in Germany upon his death
bed; ^eing somewhat disconsolate by reflecting upon the barrenness of his life:
some ^riends took thence an occasion to commend ^im, and mind him of his
painful Ministry, and fruitful life among them; but he cried out, auferte
ignem, adhuc enim paleas habeo; withdraw the fire for I have chaff in me;
meaning that he felt his ambition like chaff catching fire from the sparkles of
their praises: like unto which was the saying of another, He that praises me,
wounds me.

But to descend into the particular discoveries that prosperity and honor make
of the want of grace in some, and of the weakness of grace in others: I will
show you what symptoms of Hypocrisy appear upon some men under the Trials of
prosperity, and what signs of grace appear in others under the same trial.

SECT. IV.
PRosperity discovers many sad symptoms of a naughty heart, and among others
these are ordinarily most conspicuous.

1. First, It casts the hearts of some men into a deep oblivion of God, and
makes them lay aside all care of duty: rare fumant faelicibus Arae. The Altars
of rich menseldom smoke, Deuteronomy. 32. 13, 14, 15. Iesurun sucked honey out of the
rock, eat the fat of Lambs, and kidneys of wheat; but what was the effect of
this? he kicked, and forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the rock
of his salvation; instead of lifting up their hearts* in an humble thankful
acknowledgment of Gods bounty, they lifted up the heel in a wanton abuse of his
mercy: in the fattest earth we find the most slippery footing.

He that is truly gracious may in prosperity remit some degrees, but a Carnal
heart there loses all that which in a low condition he seemed to have. Agurs
deprecation as to himself, no doubt was built upon his frequent observation how
it was with others, Prove. 30. 8, 9. Lest I be full, and deny God. It Is said in
Eccles. 5. 12. That the abundance of (...) rich will not suffer him to sleep,
and I wish ^at were the worst injury it did him; but ^^s, it will not suffer
him to pray, to meditate, allow time and thoughts about his eternal
^^ncernments; he falls asleep in the lap of ^^osperity, and forgets that there
is a God to (...) served, or a soul to be saved. O this is a dan^rous symptom
of a very graceless heart.

2. Secondly, prosperity meeting with a ^aceless heart, makes it wholly
sensual, and ^tirely swallows up its thoughts and af^ctions: Earthly things
transform and ^old their hearts into their own similitude ^^d nature: the whole
strength of their ^^^s goes out to those enjoyments. So those ^aceless, yet
prosperous persons are descri^^d, Job 21. 11, 12, 13. They take the Timbrel ^^d
Harp, and rejoice at the sound of the Organ, (...) spend their days in wealth;
they take the ^^mbrel, not the Bible. They rejoice at the sound the Organ, not
a word of their rejoicing (...) God. They send forth their little ones in the
^nce. That is all the Catechism they are ^ught. They spend their days in
wealth. Their ^^^oletime, that precious stock and Talent (...) wholly laid out
upon these sensitive ^ings: either the pleasure of it powerfully ^arms them, or
the cares of it wholly en^oss their minds; that there is no time to ^are for
God, They live in pleasure upon earth, (...) it is Iam. 5. 5. Just as the fish
lives in the water its ^roper element, take him o^ from these things, and put
him upon spir^tual serious heavenly employments, and (...) is Piscis in arido.
Like a fish upon the d^^ Land.

Now though prosperity may too much influence, and ensnare the minds of goo^
men, and estrange them too much from he^^ venly things; yet thus to engross
the^ hearts, and convert them into their ow^ similitude and nature, so that
these thin^ should be the Centure of there hearts, the v^ry proper element in
which they live, is u^^ terly impossible.

An Hypocrite indeed may be brought (...) this, because though Ianus like, he
have tw^ faces, yet he really has but one principle and that is wholly carnal
and earthly: (...) that it is easy to make all the water to (...) in one
channel, to gather all into one enti^^ stream, in which his heart shall pour
out a^ its strength to the Creature.

But a Christian indeed has a doub^ principal that acts him: though he have
law of sin, that moves him one way, (...) there is in him also the Law of
grace, which thwarts and crosses that principle of corru^^tion; so that as
grace cannot do what would, because of sin; so neither can sin (...) what it
would, because of grace, Gal. 5. 17.

The heart of a Christian in the midst ensnaring sensitive enjoyments finds
indeed a corrupt principle in it, which would incline him to fall asleep upon
such a soft pillow; and forget God and duty: but it cannot; Oh no, it cannot do
so, there is a principle of grace within him that never leaves jogging,
disturbing, and calling upon him, till he rise and return to his God the true
rest of his soul.

3. Thirdly, A false pretender to Religion, an Hypocritical Professor meeting
with prosperity and success, grows altogether unconcerned about the interest of
Religion, and senseless of the calamities of Gods people. Thus the Prophet
convinces the Jews of their hypocrisy, Amos 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. They were at
ease in Zion, and trusted in the Mountain of Samaria: and so having a shadow of
Religion, and a fullness of all earthly things, they fell to feasting and
sporting: they drank wine in bowls, and anointed themselves with the chief
ointment, but were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph: they condoled not
Gnalsheber over the breakings or tearing to pieces of Joseph; they are out of
danger once, let the Church shift for it self; they are secure in a warm nest,
let the birds of prey catch and devour that flock with which they sometimes
associated, they are not touched with it. Moses could not do so though in the
greatest security, and confluence of the honors and pleasures of Egypt, Acts
7. 23. Nehemiah could not do so, though the servant and favorite of a mighty
Monarch, and wanted nothing to make him outwardly happy: Yet the pleasures of a
Kings Court could not cheer his heart, or scatter the clouds of sorrow from his
Countenance, whilst his brethren were in affliction, and the City of his God
lay waste, Nehem. 2. 1, 2, 3. nor indeed can any gracious heart be unconcerned
and senseless; for that Union that all the Saints have with Christ their head,
and with one another as fellow members in Christ, will beget sympathy among
them in their sufferings, 1 Cor. 12. 26.

SECT. V.
BUT as the fire of prosperity discovers this, and much more dross in a
graceless heart; so it discovers the sincerity and grace of Gods people. I say
not that it discovers nothing but grace in them. O that it did not! alas! many
of them have had a great deal of dross and corruption discovered by it, as was
noted before: but yet in this Trial, the graciousness and uprightness of their
hearts will appear in these and such like workings of it.

1. First, Under prosperity, success and honor, the upright heart will labor
to suppress pride, and keep it self lowly and humble* and still the more grace
there is, the more humility there will be. If God lift him up, he will lay
himself low, and exalt his God high. So did Jacob when God had raised and
enlarged him, Genesis 32. 10. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and
of all the truth which thou have showed unto thy servant, for with my staff I
passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two ^ands.

Great was the difference in Jacobs outward condition at his return, from what
it was at first passage over Jordan: then poor, now rich; then single and
comfortless, now the head of a great family. Yea, but though his outward estate
was altered, the frame of his heart was not altered. Jacob was an holy and
humble man when he went out, and so he was when he returned: he saw a multitude
of mercies about him, and among them all, not one but was greater than himself.

I dare not say every Christian under prosperity can at all times manifest like
humility; but I am sure what pride and vanity soever may rise in a gracious
heart tried by prosperity, there is that within him, will give check to it: he
dare not suffer such proud thoughts to lodge quietly in his heart: for a^as he
sees that in himself, and that in his God that will abase him; grace will make
him look back to his original condition, and say with David, What am I O Lord
God, and what is my fathers house; that thou have brought me hitherto? 2 Samuel
7. 18.

It will make him look in, and see the baseness of his own heart, and the
Corruptions that are there, and admire at the Dealings of God with so vile a
Creature. O thinks he, (...) others did but know what I know of my self they
would abhor me more than now they esteem and value me.

2. Secondly, Prosperity usually draws forth the Saints love to the God of
their mercies that which heats a wicked man's lusts, warm^ a gracious man's heart
with love and delight in God.

These were the words of that lovely song which David sang in the day that the
Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of
Saul, and he said, I will love thee O Lord my strength^ Psalm 18. Title and v.
1. compared: these outward things are not the main grounds and motives of their
love to God; no, no, they love him when he takes away, as well, as when he
gives: but they are sanctified instrument^ to inflame their love to God: they
boil up a wicked man's lusts, but they melt a gracious man's soul. O in what a
pang of love did David go into the presence of God under the sense of his
mercies? his melting mercies; when he thus poured out his whole soul in a
stream of love to his God, 2 Samuel 7. 19, 20. Is this the manner of men, O Lord
God! and what can David say more unto thee! an expression that turns up the
very bottom of his heart.

3. Thirdly, Prosperity and comfortable providence do usually become cautions
against ^in when they meet with a sanctified soul. This is the natural
inference of a gracious soul from them, Has God pleased me, then has he
obliged me to take more care to please him. O let me not grieve him, that has
comforted me. So Ezra 9. 13. After such a deliverance, as this, should we again
break thy Commandments! what! break his Commandments who has broken our bonds!
God forbid.

It was an excellent resolution of a Christian once, who receiving an eminent
mercy, at the same time he felt himself under the power of a special
Corruption; Well, (says he) now will I go forth in the strength of this mercy
to mortify and subdue that Corruption. I will not measure every Christian by
the eminent workings of grace in some one; but surely so far I may safely go,
That sincerity knows not how to sin, because grace has abounded, any more than
it dare sin, that grace may abound.

4. Fourthly, A truly gracious soul will not be satisfied with all the
prosperity and comforts in the world for his portion. Not thine Lord, but thee
is the voice of grace: when providence had been more than ordinarily bountiful
in outward things to Luther, he began to be afraid of its meaning, and
earnestly protested, God should not put him off so. The Lord is my portion
says my soul, Lam 3. 2, 4. and the soul can best tell what it has made its
choice, and whereon it has bestowed its chief delights and expectations.

An unsound heart will accept these for its portion: if the world be sure to
him, and his designs fail not there; he can be content to leave God, and soul,
and heaven, and hell at hazard: but so cannot the upright. These things in
subordination; but neither these, nor any thing under the Sun in Comparison
with, or opposition to God.

CHAP. V.
Showing what probation Adversity makes of the sincerity or unsoundness of our
hearts.
SECT. I.
THat Adversity is a furnace to try of what metal our hearts are, none can
doubt, that has either studied the Scriptures, or observed his own heart under
afflictions.

When the dross and rust of Hypocrisy and Corruption had almost eaten ou^ the
heart of Religion among the Jews; then says God, I will melt them, and try
them; for what shall I do for the daughter of my People? Jer. 9. 7. here
Affliction is the Furnace, and the People are the metal cast into it; and the
end of it is Trial. I will melt them and try them; what other course shall I
take with them? If I let them alone, their Lusts like the rust and Canker in
metals will eat them out. Prosperity multiplies Professors, and adversity
brings them to the test: then Hirelings quickly become changlings: the gilded
potshard glisters till it come to scouring. The Devil thought Job had been such
a one, and moves that he may be tried this way; being consident he would be
found but dross in the trial, Job 1. 11. But though the Furnace of Affliction
discovered some dross in him, (as it will in the best of men) yet he came forth
as gold.

In this Furnace also grace is manifested: it is said, Rev. 13. 10. Here is the
patience and faith of the Saints: (i. e.) here is the trial and discovery of it
in these days of Adversity. It was a weighty saying of Tetullian to the
persecutors of the Church in his days, probatio innocentiae nostrae, Tertul. in
Apol.
est iniquitas vestra. Your wickedness is the trial of our innocence.
Constantius the Father of Constantine made an exploratory decree, that all who
would not renounce the Christian Faith, should lose their places of honor and
profit; This presently separated the dross from the gold; which was his design:
for many renounced Christianity, and thereupon were renounced by him; and those
that held their integrity, were received into favor.

In time of Prosperity, Hypocrisy lies covered in the heart like nests in the
green bushes; but when the Winter of adversity has made them bare, every body
may see them without searching.

But to fall into closer particulars, it will be necessary to enquire what
effects of adversity are common to both the sound, and the unsound; and then
what are proper to either in this close trial by Adversity.

SECT. II.
IT will be expedient to the design I manage in this discourse, to show in the
first place what are common effects of adversity to both the godly and ungodly,
for in some things they differ not, but as it is with the one, so also with the
other: as,

1. First, Both the godly and ungodly may fear* Adversity before it comes. To
be sure a wicked man cannot, and it is evident many godly men do not come up to
the height of that rule, Iam. 1. 2. To account it all Joy when they fall into
diverse temptations, or trials by Adversity.

It Is said, Isa. 33. 14. The sinners in Sion are afraid, trembling surprizeth
the Hypocrite. Namely, under the apprehension of approaching calamities: and
it is true also, the Saints in Sion may be afraid: my flesh trembles for fear
of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments; said holy David, Psalm. 119. 120.
and Job 3. 23. The thing which I greatly feared (says that upright soul) is
come upon me: there is a vast difference betwixt a Saints first meeting with
afflictions, and his parting with them: he entertains them sometimes with
trembling, he parts with them rejoicing, smiling on them, and blessing them in
the name of the Lord. So that by this the upright, and the false heart, are not
discriminated: even sanctified nature declines sufferings and troubles.

2. Secondly, Both the godly and ungodly may entertain afflictions with regret
and unwillingness when they come: afflictions and troubles are Wormwood and
Gall, Lam. 3. 19. and that goes not down pleasantly with flesh and blood, Heb.
12. 11. No affliction for^ the present seems joyous, but grievous; he means
to God's own People. They are in beaviness through manifold temptations or
trials by the rod: 1 Pet. 1. 6. When God gives the cup of affliction into the
hands of the wicked, how do they reluctate and loath it? How do their stomachs
rise at it? And though the portion of the Saints cup be much sweeter than
theirs, (for that bitter ingredient of Gods vindictive wrath is not in it) yet
even they shrink from it, and loath they are to taste it.

3. Thirldly, Both the one and other may be impatient and fretful in adversity:
it is the very nature of flesh and blood to be so* The wicked are like the
troubled sea which cannot rest* whose waters cast forth mire and dirt, Isa. 57.
20. It Is an allusion to the unstable and stormy Ocean: You know there is
naturally an estuation, and working in the Sea, whether it be incensed by the
wind or no; but if a violent wind blow upon the unquiet Ocean, Oh what raging
and foaming is there! what abundance of trash and filth does it at such times
cast out!

Now, though grace make a great difference betwixt one and another, yet I dare
not say, but even a gracious heart may be very unquiet and tumultuous in the
day of affliction. Sanctified souls have their Passions and Lusts which are too
little mortified, even as Sweet-bryar, and Holy-thistles have their prickles,
as well as the worthless bramble. Jonah was a good Man, yet his Soul was sadly
distempered by adverse providence: Jonah 4. 9. Yea (says he, and that to his
God) I do well to be angry, even unto death.

4. Fourthly, Both the one and the ^ther may be weary of the rod, and think the
day of adversity a tedious day, wishing it were once at an end. Babylon shall
be weary of the evil that God will bring upon it, Ier 51. ult, and oh that none
of Sions Children were weary of adversity too! How sad a moan does Job make of
his long continued affliction, Job 16. 6, 7. though I speak, my grief is not
assuaged, and though I forbear, what am I eased? but now he has made me weary.

And if you look into Psalm. 6. 3, 6. you may see another strong Christian even
tired in the way of affliction: My soul (says David in that place) is sore
vexed, but thou O Lord how long! I am weary with my groaning.

5. Fifthly, Both the one and other may be driven to their knees by adversity.
Lord in trouble have they visited thee, they have poured out a prayer when thy
chastening was upon them, Isa. 26. 16. Not that a godly person will pray no
longer than the rod is at his back; O no, he cannot live without prayer long,
how few calls soever he has to that duty by the rod: but when the rod is on
his back, he will be more frequently, and more ^ervently upon his knees: indeed
many graceless heart are like Childrens Tops which will go no longer than they
are whipped; they cannon find their knees and their tongues, till Go^ find a rod
to excite them. A dangerous symp^tome. The same affliction may put a gracious
and a graceless soul to their knees; but the in the external matter of duty,
and in the external call or occasion of duty they seem to agree; yet is there a
vast difference in the principles, manner, and ends of these their duties; as
will evidently appear in its proper place in our following discourse.

But by what has been said in this Section you may see how in some things the
holy upright soul acts too like the unsanctified, and in other things how much
the Hypocrite may act like a Saint: he may be externally humbled, so was Ahab:
he may pray under the rod, Mal. 2. 13. yea and request others to pray for him,
so did Simon, Acts 8. 24.

SECT. III.
BUt though the sound and unsond heart differ not in some external carriages
under the rod; yet there are effects of adversity which are proper to either,
and will discriminate them. To which end let us first see what effects
adversity is usually followed withal in unsound and carnal hearts: and we shall
find among other, these five symptoms of a naughty heart appearing under
crosses and afflictions.

1. First, A Graceless heart is not quickly and easily brought to see the hand
of God in those troubles that befall it, and be duly affected with it, Isa. 26.
11. Lord when thy hand is lifted up they will not see: when it has smitten, or
is lifted up to smite, they shut their eyes: it is the malice of this man, or
the negligence of that, or the unfaithfulness of another that has brought all
this trouble upon me: thus the Creature is the Horizon that terminates their
sight, and beyond that they usually see nothing: sometimes indeed the hand of
God is so immediately manifested, and convincingly discovered in afflictions,
that they cannot avoid the sight of it, and then they may (in their way) pour
out a prayer before him, but ordinarily they impute all to second causes, and
overlook the first cause of their troubles.

2. Secondly, Nor is it usual with these Men under the rod to retire into their
Closets, and search their hearts there; to find out the particular cause and
provocation of their affliction: No man repented him of his wickedness, saying
what have I done? Jer. 8. 6. what cursed thing is there with me, that has thus
incensed the anger of God against me? God visits their iniquities with
afflictions, but they visit not their own hearts by self-examinations. God
judges them, but they judge not themselves; he shows their iniquities in a
clear glass, but none says, What have I done? This phrase, What have I done?
is the voice of one that recollects himself after a rash action; or the voice
of a Man astonished at the discovery afflictions make of his sins, but no such
voice as this is ordinarily heard among carnal Men.

3. Thirdly, An unsound Professor if le^t to his choice, would rather choose Sin
than Affliction; and sees more evil in that, than in this.

And it cannot be doubted if we consider, the principle by which all
unregenerate Men are acted, is sense not faith: hence Jobs friends would have
argued his Hypocrisy, Job 36. 21. and had their application been as their
rule, it would have concluded it. This ( viz. Sin) have thou chosen, rather
than affliction.

I do not say that an upright man cannot commit a moral evil, to escape a
poenal evil. O that daily observation did not too plentifully furnish us with
sad instances of that kind! but upright ones do not, dare not upon a serious
deliberate discussion and debate choose sin rather than affliction; what they
may do upon surprisals, and in the violence of temptation is of another nature.

But a false and unsound heart discovers it self in the choice it makes upon
deliberation, and that frequently, when sin and trouble come in competition:
put case, says Augustine, a Ruffian should with one hand set the cup of
drunkenness to thy mouth, and with the other a dagger to thy breast; and say,
drink or die: thou should rather choose to die sober, than to live a drunkard:
and many Christians have resisted unto blood striving against sin, and with
renowned Moses chosen affliction, the worst of afflictions; yea death it self
in the most formidable appearance, rather than sin: and it is the habitual
temper and resolution of every gracious heart so to do, though those holy
resolutions are sometimes overborn by violence of temptation.

But the Hypocrite dreads less the de^ilement of his soul, than the loss of his
estate, liberty or life. If you ask upon what ground then does the Apostle
suppose, 1 Cor. 13. 3. a man may give his body to be burnt, and not have
charity? that the Salamander of Hypocrisy may live in the flame of Martyrdom?
The answer is at hand, they that chose death in the sense of this Text, do not
chose it to escape sin, but to seed and indulge it. Those strange adventures
(if any such be) are rather to maintain their own honor, and enrol their names
among worthy and famous Persons to Posterity; or out of a blind zeal to their
espoused erours and mistakes; than in a due regard to the glory of God, Timeo
dicere, sed dicendum est; martyrium ipsum si ideo fiat ut admirationi and laudi
habeatur a fratribus; frustr^ sanguis effusus est. Hier.
and the preservation of intiegrity. I fear to speak it, but it must be spoken;
(says Hierom.) that even Martyrdom it self, when suffered for admiration and
applause, profits nothing; but that blood is shed in vain.

4. Fourthly, It is the property of an un^^generate soul under adversity to
turn from creature to creature for support and comfort, and not from every
creature to Go^ alone. So long as their feet can touch groun^ I mean feel any
creature relief or comfor^ under them, they can subsist and live in
a^flictions; but when they lose ground, the^ all creature refuge fails, then
their hearts fail too.

Thus Zedekiah and the self-deceivin^ Jews, when they saw their own strengt^
failed them, and there was little hope le^^ that they should deliver themselves
from the ^haldeans, what do they in that strait? D^ they with upright
Iehosaphat say, our eyes (...) unto thee? No, no, their eyes were upon ^gupt
for succor, not upon Heaven: Wel^, Pharaoh and his aids are left still, all
hope^ is not gone: Ier. 37. 9. See the like in Aba^^ in a sore plunge and
distress he Courts the King of Assyria for help, 2 Chronicles, 22. 28, 2^^ That
project failing, why then he will tr^ what the Gods of Damascus can do for him*
any way rather than the right way, Flecter^ si nequeam superos, Acheronta
movebo.

So it is with many others. If one chil^ die, what do they do, run to God and
com^fort themselves in this, The Lord lives the my Child die? If an Estate be
lost and a Fa^mily sinking, do they with David comfor^ ^^emselves in the
everlasting Covenant, order^ and sure? No, no; but if one Relation (...),
there is another alive; if an Estate be ^^ne, yet not all: something is left
still, and (...) case will mend.

As long as ever such Men have any visible ^^couragement, they will hang upon
it; and ^ot make up all in Christ, and encourage ^^emselves in the Lord. To
tell them of re^^ycing in the Lord, when the Fig tree blos^^ms not, is what
they cannot understand.

5. Fifthly, To conlude, An unsound heart ^ever comes out of the Furnace of
affliction ^^rged, mortified, and more spiritual and ho^^ than when he was cast
into it: his scum (...) dross is not there separated from him: ^ay the more
they are afflicted, the worse ^^ey are. Why should ye be smitten any more? ye
^ill revolt more and more, Isa. 1. 5. and to ^eep to our Metaphor, consult Ier.
6. 29. ^od had put that incorrigible people into ^e Furnace of affliction, and
kept them long (...) that fire; and what was the Issue? why, ^^ith the Prophet,
The bellows are burnt, ^e lead is consumed of the fire, the founder mel^^h in
vain, etc. reprobate silver shall men call ^^em, because the Lord has rejected
them.

If the fire of affliction be continually ^lown till the very bellows be burnt,
that is, ^^e tongue, or rather the lungs of the Prophet, which have some
resemblance to bellows; though these be even spent in reproving and threatening,
and denouncing woe upon woe, and Judgment upon Judgment; an^ God fulfills his
word upon them; yet sti^ they are as before; the dross remains: thoug^
Jerusalem be made a Furnace, and the inha^bitants, the flesh boiling in it over
a fier^^ fire of affliction; yet as it is noted (pert^nently to my Discourse)
in Ezekiel. 24. 6. 1^ the scum remains with them, and cannot b^ separated by the
fire; and the reason (...) plain, because no affliction in its self purg^ sin,
but as it is sanctified, and works in the virtue of Gods blessing, and in
pursuan^^ of the promises

O think on this you that have had thou^sands of afflictions in one kind and
another and none of them all have done you good they have not mortified
humbled, or bene^fited you at all. And thus you see what the effects of
adversity are when it meets (...) graceless heart.

SECT IV.
BY this time, Reader, I suppose thou ar^ desirous to know what effects
adversit^ and afflictions use to have when they mee^ with an honest and sincere
heart; only be^fore I come to particulars, I think it needfu^^ to acquaint
thee, That the fruits of afflictions are mostly after-fruits, and not so
discerna^^^^ by the Christian himself under the rod, (...) after he has been
exercised by it, Heb. ^^. 11. and calmly reflects upon what is past; (...) does
every Christian attain the same easure and degree: some rejoice, others ^mmonly
submit: but I think these seven ^ects are ordinarily found in all upright
^earts that pass under the rod.

1. First, The sincere and upright soul be^^es its self to God in affliction,
Job 1. 20. ^hen God was smiting, Job was praying: ^hen God afflicted, Job
worshipped: So David, ^al. 116. 3, 4. I found sorrow and trouble, ^en called I
upon (...) the name of the Lord; and ^hen the messenger of Satan buffeted Paul,
(...) this cause (says he) I besought the Lord ^rice 2 Cor. 12. 8. Alas,
whither should a ^hild go in distress but to its Father?

2. Secondly, He sees, and owns the hand of ^od in his afflictions: how much or
little ^ever of the instruments of trouble appear. (...) Lord has taken away,
says Job, Job 1. ^. God has bidden him, says David* 2 ^^m. 16. 10. If the
blow come from the and of a wicked man, yet he sees that ^^cked hand in Gods
righteous hand, Psalm, ^. 14. And this apprehension is fundamental (...) all
that communion men have with God their affl^ctions, and to all that
peaceableness, ^^gracious submission of their spirits under (...) rod, he that
sees nothing of God in his trou^^s, has nothing of God in his soul.

3. Thirdly, He can justify God in all the afflictions and troubles that come
up^ on him, be they never so severe. Thou ar^ just in all that is brought upon
us, says Nehemiah^ Nehem. 9. 33. Thou have punished us less tha^ our
iniquities deserve, says Ezra, Ezra 9. 13* It is of the Lords mercy we are not
consumed, says the Church, Lam. 3. 22. Are we in Babylon? it is a mercy we are
not in hell. If God con^demn him, yet he will justify God: if God cast him
into a sea of trouble, yet he will acknowledge in all that sea of trouble,
there i^ not one drop of injustice. If I have not deserved such usage from the
hands of men^ yet I have deserved worse than this at the hands of God.

4. Fourthly, Afflictions use to melt an^ humble gracious hearts: there is an
habitu^al tenderness planted in their spirits, and (...) just occasion quickly
draws it forth: and so usual a thing it is for gracious hearts to be humbled
under the afflictings of God, that affliction is upon that score called
humiliation: the effect put for the cause; to show where one is, the other will
be: 2 Cor. 12* 21. My God will humble me, (i. e.) he will afflict me with the
sight of your si^s, and disorders: and if a gracious soul b^ so ap^ to be
humbled for other men's sins, much more for his own.

5. Fifthly, The upright soul is inquisitive ^^der the rod to find out that
evil for which the Lord contends with him by af^^^ction, Job 10. 2. show me
wherefore thou ^^ntendest with me: and Job 34. 31. that which I see not, teach
thou me: If I have done ^iquity, I will do no more. So Lam. 3. 39, 4. (...) us
search and try our ways, and turn again (...) the Lord; in afflicting God
searches them, and under affliction they search themselves: ^illing they are to
hear the voice of the rod, and glad of any discovery it makes of their hearts.

6. Sixthly, The upright heart chooses to ^ye under affliction, ^ rather than
to be deli^ered from it by sin. I say this is the choice and resolution of
every upright heart, how^ver it may be sometimes overborn by the ^iolence of
temptation, Heb. 11. 35. not ac^epting deliverence, viz. upon sinful terms, and
^onditions.

They are sensible how the flesh smarts under the rod, but had rather it should
smart, ^han conscience should smart under guilt. ^ffliction says an upright
soul grieves me, ^ut sin will grieve God; affliction wounds (...), flesh, but
sin will wound my soul. Deli^erance I long for, but I will not pay so ^ear for
it, how much soever I desire it. Nolo (...) emere paenitentaim: outward ease is
^weet, but inward peace is sweeter.

7. Seventhly, He prizeth the spiritual good gotten by affliction, above
deliverance from it; and can bless God from his heart for those mercies how
near soever his flesh hat^ paid for them, Psalm. 119. 67. and 71. It (...) good
for me that I have been afflicted. Such (...) the value the people of God have
for sp^^ritual graces, that they cannot think the^^ a dear penny worth, whatever
their flesh hat^ paid for them. The mortification of one Lus^ one discovery of
sincerity, one manifesta^^ on of God to their souls, does much more than make
amends for all that they have endured under the rod.

Is patience improved, self-acquaintan^ increased, the vanity of the Creature
more effectually taught, longings after heaven i^ flamed? O blessed afflictions
that are atten^ed with such blessed fruits! It was the say^ing of a holy man
under a sore troubl^ for the death of an only Son; when in tha^ dark day God
had graciously manifeste^ himself to his soul; O said he, I would b^ contented
(if it were possible) to lay (...) only Son in the grave every day I have (...)
live in the world, for one such discovery (...) the love of God as I now enjoy.

CHAP. VI.
^^ewing Indwelling sin to be to grace, what fire is to gold; and how the
soundness and unsoundness of our hearts are discovered by our Carriage toward
it.
^ECT. 1.
PRosperity and adversity put sincerity to the trial, but nothing ^akes a
deeper search into our bosoms, ^^thing sifts our spirits more narrowly, or
^lls us what our state is more plainly than (...) behavior toward that
corruption that wells in us; the thorn is next neighbor (...) the rose: sin
and grace dwell not only (...) the same soul, but in the same faculties. ^he
Collier and Fuller dwell in one room, that one cleanses the other blacks: of
(...) the evils God permits in this world, none (...) more grievous to his
people than this: ^^ey sometimes wonder why the Lord will ^^ffer it to be so;
why, surely among other ^ise and holy ends of this permission, these ^e some.

They are left to try you, and to humble (...); there is no intrinsecal
goodness in sin, (...) how^ver in this it occasions good to us, ^^at by car
carriage toward it we discern (...) sincerity. The touchstone is a worthless
one in it self, but it serves to try the gold: Joh. 3. 9, 10. Whosoever is born
of God; does (...) commit sin, for his seed remains in him, and he cannot
sin, because he is born of God; in (...) the Children of God are manifest, and
the ^^^^dren of the Devil; q. d. in respect of their ^^riage toward sin, the
one and other is plai^ manifested: this is that which separates^ dross from the
gold, and shows you what true state of Men's Persons, and tempe^ their hearts
is. By not sinning we are no^ understand a total freedom from it in (...)
World, as if it implied any such perfect^ of the People of God in this World,
the the Popish and Pelagian sense: nor yet (...) we take it in the Arminian
sense, who (...) void the Argument of the Orthodox, will ^^^derstand it of the
sin against the Holy Gh^^ what a strange thing would it be to (...) that a
Characterstical note of distinction ^^twixt the godly and ungodly, which so
(...) few even of the most ungodly are e^ guilty of?

But the manner of our behavior tow^^^ sin, and our carriage toward it
before, under, or after the commission of it; in (...) the Children of God are
manifest, and Children of the Devil.

Now there are five things relating (...) that discriminate and mark the state
of Persons: the difference is discernable,

In our
1. Abstinence for Sin. 2. Hatred of Sin. 3. Troubles about Sin. 4. Subjection
to Sin. 5. Opposition of Sin.
SECT. II.
THe Grounds and Motives of our abstinence do very clearly manifest (...) state
of our souls; what they are in the ^generate, and unregenerate, is our next
^^rk. And let it be considered,

(...) First, Tha^ an unsound and unrenewed ^art may abstain from one sin,
because it (...) contrary to, and inconsistent with ano^^er sin: for it is with
the sins of our na^^es, as it is with the diseases of our bodies: ^ough all
diseases be contrary to health, yet ^^e diseases (as the Fever and Palsy) are
^^ntrary to each other. So are prodigality (...) Covetousness, Hypocrisy, and
Prosane^ss: these oppose each other, not for mu^^l destruction as sin and grace
do, but for ^^eriority, each contending for the throne, (...) sometimes taking
it by turns: it is with (...) persons as with that possessed man, (...). 17.
15. whom the spirit cast some^^es into the fire, sometimes into the water:
(...) if one subdue the other, yet the heart is (...) subdued to the vassalage
of that lust that ^ppermost in the soul.

2. Secondly, An unrenewed soul may (...) kept from the commission of some sin;
(...) because there is a principle of grace with^^ him, but because of some
providential (...) straint without him, or upon him: For it ofte^^ falls out,
that when men have conceived (...) and are ready to execute it, providen^^
claps on the fetters of restraint, and hinde^^ them from executing it.

This was the case of Abimeleck, Genesis 2* 6. and 17. compared, I withheld thee:
A^^ though persons so restrained, have not (...) good of such providence, yet
others have for by it a world of mischief is prevented^ the world, which
otherwise would bre^^ out; and to this act of providence we owe (...) lives,
liberties, estates and comforts in this wor^^

3. Thirdly, An unsound heart may (...) commit some sins; not because he truly
ha^^ them, but because his constitution incli^^ him not to them: these men are
rather (...) holding to a good temper of body, than a gracious temper of soul.
Some men cann^^ be drunkards if they would; others cann^^ be covetous and base*
^hey are made ^e meli^luto of a more refined metal than others; (...) chaste and
liberal, just and sober nat^re, (...) nature still: the best nature in all is
end^ments, is but nature at the best.

4. Fourthly, A graceless heart may be^^ strained from sin by the force of
educa^^ (...) principles of morality that way instilled (...) it. Thus Iehoash
was restrained from (...) 2 Kings 12. 2. and Iehoash did that which (...) right
in the sight of the Lord all the days ^erein Iehojadah the Priest instructed
him. (...) fear of a Parent or M^^ter, will do ^reat deal more with some in
this case, (...) the fear of God. The influence of a ^ct education nips off the
excrescencies of ^ding vice. The way we are taught when (...), we keep when
old: this is the influ^^^e of man upon man; not the influence ^he regenerating
spirit upon men.

^. Fifthly. A Graceless heart may be kept ^n some sins by the fear of the
events, both ^his world, and that to come. Sin that is ^owed with infamy and
reproach among (...), may on this ground be forborne; not ^^use God has
forbiden it, but because hu^e laws will punish it, and the sober world (...)
brand us for it: and some look farther, ^e punishment of sin in hell: they are
not ^id to sin, but they are afraid to burn.

^ere sin is like a sweet rose in a brake ^orns: fain we would have it, but are
(...) to ^ear our flesh to come by it. It Is (...) that in is prevented any way,
but to ^ept on this ground from sin, does not ^^e the estate of the person to
be good: (...) you see some of the grounds on which ^al men are restrained: and
in this the children (...) devil are manifest.

SECT. III.
BUt there are grounds of abstinence (...) sin, by which the children of God a^
manifested, and such are these that follo^

1. First, A sincere heart dares not sin cause of the eye and fear of God which
i^ on him: So you find it in Job 31. 1. (...) 4. he durst not allow his
thoughts to sin cause he lived under the awe of Gods Nehemiah durst not do as
former Gover^ had done: though an opportunity prese^^ to enrich himself;
because of the fear (...) God, Nehem. 5. 15. The soul that live (...) the awe
of this eye will be as co^entious where no discovery can be mad^ Creatures, as
if all the world looke^ Levit. 19. 14. Thou shall not curse the^ nor put a
stumbling block before the blind* shall fear thy God, I am the Lord.

What if a man do curse the deaf, the cannot hear him; and what if he do (...)
stumbling block before the blind, the (...) cannot see him: true, but God sees^
God hears him, that is enough to a man^ has the fear of the Lord upon his (...)

2. Secondly, As the fear of Go^ so (...) of God, is a principle of restraint
from (...) the soul that is upright. This kept Joseph from sin, Genesis 39. 9. How
can I (...) great wickedness, and sin against God!

I? he speaks as a man that feels himself and up from fin by the goodness and
love God that had been manifested to him, q. ^ath he delivered me from the pit
into ^ch my envious brethren cast me? has ^n so miraculous a way advanced me
to ^his honor and power in Egypt? and (...), after all his kindness and love
to me, (...) I sin against him? O how can I do (...) against so good, so
gracious a God? Psalm. 97. 10. ye that love the Lord hate evil. ^e will cry ou^
in the hour of Temp^ati^^s this thy kindness to thy friend? Do (...) thus
requite the Lord for all his kind^^es?

^. Thirdly, As the love of God, so the insecal evil and filthiness that is in
sin keeps (...) the gracious soul from it, Romans 12. 9. ^or that which is evil,
(...), (...) it as hell it self: or as the French Tran^^n has it, be in
horror: as the appre^^^sions of hell, so the apprehensions of sin ^^ress
horror upon the mind that is sancti^^: nothing more loathsome to an holy (...)
Its aversations from it are with the hest indignation and loathing.

^. Fou^thly, The renewed Nature of a (...) rest^ains him from sin, Gal. 5. 17.
The (...) lusts against the flesh, so that ye cannot (...) thing that ye
would: Ye cannot, why ^^^not ye? because it is against your new ^^ure.

Beloved, This is a very remarkable thi^ in the experience of all renewed men,
(...) upon the renovation of men's principles, the delights, and their
aversations and loathin^ are laid quite cross and oppostie to wh^^ they were
before. In their carnal state, va^^ company, and sinful exerci^es were their
^^^ight. To be separated from these, and ty^ to prayer, meditation, heavenly
discourse, company; O what a bond^ge would (...) have been! Now be tied to such
carnal^^ciety, and restrained from duties of godline and the society of the
godly, becomes a mu^^ sorer bondage to the soul.

5. Fifthly, Experience of the bitterness of (...) is a restraint to a gracious
heart. They the have had so many sick days, and sorrows^ nights for sin as
they have had, are loath (...) taste that wormwood and gall again, whi^^ their
soul has still in remembrance, 2 C^^ 7. 11. In that ye sorrowed after a godly
sort, wh^^ carefulness it wrought! he would not grapp^ with those inward
troubles again, he wou^^ not have the cheerful light of Gods Cou^^ tenance
eclipsed again for all, and much mo^^ than all the pleasures that are in sin*

6. Sixthly, The Consideration of the Suff^^ings of Christ for sin, powerfully
withholds gracious soul from the Commission of it Romans 6. 6. Our old man is
Crucified with hi^ that the body of sin might be destroyed, the ^enceforth we
should not serve sin. Were there (...) knife or sword in the house that had
been ^hurst through the heart of your Father, would ^ou ever endure the sight
of it? sin was the lord that pierced Christ, and so the death of Christ becomes
the death of sin in his people. Thus the Children of God, and ^he Children of
the Devil are manifest, in ^he principles and reasons of their abstinence from
sin.

SECT. IV.
(^.) SEcondly, They are also manifested by their hatred of sin: this puts a
clear distinction betwixt them: for no false or ^nregenerate heart, can hate
sin as sin; he ^ay indeed,

1. First, Hate sin in another, but not in himself: thus one proud man hates
another, Calco superbiam Platonis, said Diogines; when ^e trampled Plato's fine
clothes under foot; (...) spurn the pride of Plato: Sed majori super^ia, as
Plato smartly replied, Thou tramp^est upon my pride, but it is with greater
^^pride. Why (says Christ to the Hypocrite) be^holdest thou the mote in thy
brothers eye, but co^sidere^t not the beam that is in thine own eye? Matt. 7.
3. how quick in espying, and rash in censuring the smallest fault in another,
is the Hypocrite! it was but one fault, and that but a small one, but a mote
that he could find in another; yet this he quickly discerns: (...) may be there
were many excellent graces in him, these he overlooks, but the mote he plainly
discerns.

It may be that mote in his brothers eye had drawn many tears from it; but
these he takes no notice of; and mean while there is a beam (i. e.) a great
horrid flagitious evil in himself; but it is too near him to be discerned, or
bewailed: this is a sad symptom of a naughty heart.

2. Secondly, He may hate it in its effects, and consequents; not in its own
nature: as the Thief hates the Gallows, not the wickedness that he has done.
It is not sin in it self, but sin in its connection with Hell, that is
frightful to him.

The unsound professor could wish that there were no such threatenings in the
Bible against sin: when sin tempts him, I would says he, but I fear the
consequence. O sin, could I separate thee from hell, nothing should separate
thee and me.

3. Thirdly, He may hate it in a mood or pang, but not with a rooted habitual
hatred. It Is plain from 2 Pet. 2. 22. that sin may sometimes lie upon the
conscience of an unregenerate man, as a load lies upon a sick stomach; and so
he may discharge himself of it, by reformation, restitution, etc. but a little
time reconciles the quarrel betwixt him and his Lust again: if they fall out
they will fall in again; the dog is ^^turned to his vomit, and the sow that was
washed, to her wallowing in the mire.

But an upright soul hates sin in another manner, and in this hatred of sin the
Children of God are manifest.

1. First, the opposition of sin to God, is the very ground and formal reason
upon which a gracious soul opposes and hates it: if it be opposite to the holy
nature and law of God, it cannot but be odious in his eyes: This put David's
heart, Psalm. 51. 4. Against thee, thee only have I sinned: q. d. I have wronged
Uriah greatly, I have wronged my self and family greatly; but the wrong I have
done to others is not worth naming, in comparison of the wrong I have done to
thee.

2. Secondly, The upright soul hates sin in himself, more than he hates it in
any other: as a man hates a Serpent in the hedge, but much more in his own
bosom: Romans 7 23. But I see another Law in my members: and ver. 21. I find
then a Law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me: q. d. I'don't
know how others find it, but I am sure I find sin in my very bosom, in my very
bowels, it is pr^sent with me. O wretched man that I am! a gracious soul can
mourn to see in others; but to find it in himself, pierces him to the very
heart.

3. Thirdly, The gracious soul hates not only this or that particular sin, but
the whole kind, Arist. Rhet. lib. 2. cap. 4.
every thing that is sinful. True hatred is (...), of the whole nature or kind,
Psalm. 119. 104. I hate every false way; his reasonings proceed a quatenus ad
omne, from sin, as sin; concluding against every sin. Sins that are profitable,
and pleasant, as well as sins that have neither profit nor pleasure: sins that
are secret as well as sins that are open, and will defame him.

And before this trial a false heart cannot stand; for he always indulges to
some Lust: there is an iniquity which he cannot be separated from.

4. Fourthly, The sincere soul hates sin with an irreconcilable hatred: there
was a time when sin and his soul fell out, but there never will be a time of
reconciliation betwixt them again.

That breach which effectual conviction once made, can never be made up any
more: they will return no more to folly, Psalm. 85. 8. and indeed it seems to
them that have suffered so much for sin, that have endured so many fears and
sorrows for it; the greatest (...) in the world to return to sin again: no, no*
they admire the mercy of their escape from sin, to their dying day; and never
look back upon their former state but with shame and grief.

Ask a Convert, would you be back again where once you were? would you be among
your old companions again? would you be fulfilling the lusts of the flesh
again? and he will tell you he would not run the hazard to abide one day or one
night in that condition again, to gain all the Kingdoms of the world the next
morning.

5. Fifthly, The sincere soul hates sin with a superlative hatred: he hates it
more than any other evil in the world besides it. Penal evils are not pleasant
themselves, but yet if he must endure them, or sin; then sufferings to choose:
Heb. 11. 25. Choosing rather to suffer affliction than enjoy the pleasures of
sin; the worst of sufferings, rather than the best of sin.

6. Sixthly, To conclude, so deep is the hatred that upright ones bear to sin,
that nothing pleases them more than the thoughts of a full deliverance from it
does: Romans 7. 34. I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. What does he so
heartily thank God for? O for a prospect of his final deliverance from sin,
never to be entangled, defiled, or ^roubled with it any more: and this is one
thing that sweetens death to the Saints, as much as any thing in the world can
do, except Christ's victory over it, and lying in the grave for us. To think of
a grave is not pleasant in it self, but to think of a parting time with sin,
that is sweet and pleasant indeed.

SECT. V.
(3.) THirdly, The Children of God an^ the Children of the Devil, pur^ Gold,
and vile dross are manifest as in ha^tred of sin, so in their troubles, and
sorrow about sin.

All trouble for sin argues not sincerity some have reason to be troubled even
for their troubles for sin. So have they.

1. First, That are only troubled for the commission of some more gross sins
tha^ startle the natural Conscience, but not for in^ward sins that defile the
soul. Judas wa^ troubled for betraying innocent blood, bu^ not for that base
Lust of Covetousness tha^ was the root of it, or the want of sincer^ love to
Jesus Christ: Matthew. 27. 4, 5. Out^ward sins are sins major is infamiae, of
great scandal; but heart-sins are oftentimes major^ reatus, sins of greater
guilt: to be trouble for grosser sins, and have no trouble for ord^^nary sins
daily incurred, is an ill sign of a ba^ heart.

2. Secondly A graceless heart may be much troubled at the discovery of sin,
when it (...) not troubled for the guilt of sin, Jer. 2. 26* As the Thief is
ashamed when he is found, so (...) the house of Israel ashamed: Hence it is
tha^ they stick not to commit ten sins against God, ^o hide one sin from the
eyes of men* It is a mercy that sin is the matter of men's shame, and that all
are not arrived to that height of impudence to declare their sin as Sodom, and
glory in their shame; but to be ashamed only because men see it, and not with
Ezra to say, O my God I am ashamed, and blush to look up unto thee, Ezra 9. 6.
ashamed that thou see it, is but Hypocrisy.

3. Thirdly, A graceless heart may be troubled for the rod that sin draws after
it, but not for sin it self as it provokes God to inflict such rods.

But the troubles of upright ones for sin are of another kind and nature.

1. First, They are troubled that God is wronged, and his Spirit troubled by
their sins. So the penitent Prodigal, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy
sight, Luke 15. 21. Against heaven, (i. e.) against him whose Throne is in
Heaven, a great, glorious, and infinite Majesty: a poor worm of the Earth, has
lifted up his hand against the God of Heaven.

2. Secondly, They are troubled for the defilement of their own souls by sin:
hence they are compared in Prove. 25. 26. to a troubled fountain; you know it is
the property of a living spring when any filth falls into it, or that which
lies in the bottom of its chanel is raised and defiles its streams, never to
leave working till it have purged it self of it, and recovered its purity again.

So it is with a righteous man; he loves purity in the precept, Psalm. 119. 140.
and he loves it no less in the principle and practice: he thinks it is hell
enough to lie under the pollution of sin, if he should never come under
damnation for it.

3. Thirdly, They are troubled for the estrangements of God, and the hiding of
his face from them because of their Sin. It would go close to an ingenuous
spirit to see a dear and faithful friend whom he has grieved, to look strange
and shy upon him at the next meeting; as if he did not know him: much more does
it go to the heart of a gracious man to see the face of God turned from him,
and not to be toward him as in times past. This went to David's heart after his
fall, as you may see, Psalm. 51. 11. Cast me not away from thy presence, and
take not thy holy spirit from me; q. d. Lord, if thou turn thy back upon me,
and estrange thy self from me, I am a lost man: that is the greatest mischief
than can befall me.

4. Fourthly, Their troubles for sin run deep, to what other Men's do. They are
strong to bear other troubles, but quail and fain^ under this: Psalm. 38. 4.
other sorrows may for the present be violent, and make more noise; but this
sorrow soaks deeper into the soul.

5. Fifthly, Their troubles for sin are more rivate and silent troubles than
others are; their sore runs in the night; as it is Psalm. 77. 2. ^ot but that
they may, and do open their roubles to Men, (and it is a mercy when ^hey meet
with a judicious, tender, and expe^enced Christian to unbosom themselves unto:)
but when all is done, it is God and ^hy soul alone that must whisper out the
^atter: ille vere dolet, qui sine test dolet: that (...) sincere sorrow for
sin indeed, which is ex^ressed secretly to God in the Closet.

6. Sixthly, Their troubles are incurable ^y creature comforts: it is not the
removing ^ome outward pressures and inconveniences, that can remove their
burden; nothing but ^ardon, peace, and witnessed reconciliation ^an quiet the
gracious heart.

7. Seventhly, Their troubles for sin are ordi^ate and kept in their own place;
they dare not stamp the dignity of Christ's blood upon their worthless tears and
groans for sin: Lava achrymas meas domine, Aug. Lord, wash my ^inful tears in
the blood of Christ, was once ^he desire of a true Penitent. And thus our
^rouble for sin shows us what our hearts are.

SECT. VI.
^4.) FOurthly, the behavior and carriage of the soul with respect to
subjection ^o the commands of sin, shows what our estate and condition is. This
will separat^ dross from gold. All unregenerate men ar^ the servants of Sin,
they subject themselves (...) its commands. This the Scripture sometime calls a
Conversation in the lusts of the flesh, Ephesians* 2. 3. sometimes the selling of
themselves to sin 1 King. 21. 20. Now as a judicious Divine observes, though the
Children of God com^plain with Paul, Romans 7.14, 15. that they are sold under
sin, Dr. Reynolds
yet there is a vast difference betwixt these two the Saints are sold to it by
Adam, but other by their own continued consent. But to she^ you the difference
in this matter, I conceiv^ it necessary to show, wherein the reignin^ power of
sin does not consist, and the^ wherein it does: that you may plainly dis^cern
who are in subjection to the reignin^ power of their corruptions, and who ar^
not. Now there be diverse things common both to the regenerate and unregenerate
and we cannot say the dominion of sin lie^ in any or in all of them, viz.
abstractly an^ simply considered.

1. First, Both one, and other having Or^^ginal Corruption dwelling in them,
may all find this fountain breaking forth into gro^ and scandalous sins: but we
cannot say the because original Corruption thus breaks fort into gross and
scandalous-sins in both; there^fore it must needs reign in the one, as we (...)
in the other: a righteous Man may fall ^^^efore the wicked, as it is Prove. 25.
26. he may all in the dirt of grosser iniquities, and fur^ish them with matter
of reproach. So did ^avid, Peter, Abraham, and many more of ^he Lords upright
hearted ones, whose souls ^^evertheless sin did not reign over, by a vo^ntary
subjection to its commands, nor must his embolden any to sin with more liberty.

2. Secondly, Though an upright Soul fall once and again into sin, though he
reiterate the same ^ct of sin, which he has repented of before; (...) it
cannot merely from thence be con^uded, that therefore sin reigns over him,
(...) it does over a wicked Man that makes it (...) daily trade. I confess
every reiteration of (...), puts a farther aggravation upon it: and (...) sad
we should repent, and sin; and sin, (...) repent: but yet you read, Prove. 24.
16. (...) just man falls seven times, and rises up a^^in: Job's Friends were
good men, yet he ^lls them, These ten times have ye reproached (...), Job 19.
3. This indeed shows a heart that ^eally needs purging; for it is with relapses
(...) spiritual, as it is with relapses into na^ral diseases: a recidivation or
return of the ^sease shows that the morbifique matter was (...) duly purged;
but though it show the foul^^ss, it does not always prove the falseness of (...)
heart.

3. Thirdly, Though one may be impatient of the reproof of his sin, as well as
the other; yet that alone will not conclude sin to be in full dominion over
one, as it is over the other*

It Is pity any good Man should storm at (...) just rebuke of sin; that such a
precious Oy^^ as is proper to heal, should be conceited to break his head: but
yet flesh will be tender* and touchy; even in good men. Asa was (...) good man,
and yet he was wroth with the Prophet who reproved him; as you find 2 Chronicles.
16. 10. yet I doubt not but their Consciences smite them for it, when pride
suffers not another to do it: a reproof may be ill timed, and ill managed by
another; and and so may provoke; but they will hear the voice of conscience in
another manner*

4. Fourthly, Though in both some one parti^cular sin may have more power than
another yet neither does this alone conclude tha^ therefore that sin must reign
in one, as it does in another: indeed the beloved Lust of eve^ry wicked man is
King over his soul; bu^ yet a godly man's constitution, calling, and^ may
incline him more to one sin than an^other; and yet neither that, nor any other
may be said to be in dominion; for th^'* D^ vid speaks of his iniquity, (i. e.)
his special si^ Psalm. 18. 23. which some suppose to be (...) sin of lying, from
that intimation, Psalm. 11^ 29. yet you see in one place he begs God (...) keep
him from it, and in the other he tells (...) he kept himself from it, and both
show he was not the Servant of it.

5. Fifthly, Though both may sin against knowledge, yet it will not follow from
thence, that therefore sins against knowledge must needs be sins in dominion in
the one, as they are in the other: there was too much light abused, and
violenced in David's deliberated sin; as he confesses, Psalm. 51. 6. and the sad
story it self too plainly shows; and yet in the main, David was an upright Man
still, though this consideration of the fact shrewdly wounded his integrity: and
stands upon record for a caution to all others.

SECT. VII.
WE have seen what does not infer the dominion of sin in the former
particulars, being simply considered; I shall next show you what does; and how
the sincere and false heart are distinguished in this trial. And

1. First, Assent and Consent upon delibera^ion notes the soul to be under the
dominion of sin: when the mind approves sin, and the will gives its plenary
consent to it; This sets (...) sin in its Throne, and puts the soul into
sub^ection to it: for the dominion of sin consists (...) its authority over us,
and our voluntary ^ubjection to it. This you find to be the cha^acter of a
wicked graceless Person; Psalm. 36. 4. He devises mischief upon his bed; he
sets himself in a way that is not good, he abhors not evil.

The best Men may fall into sin through mistake, or be precipitated into sin
through the violence of Temptation; but to devise mischief, and set himself in
an evil way; this notes full assent of the mind, and then not to abhor evil,
notes full consent of the will, and these two being given to sin, not only
antecedently to the acting of it; but also consequently to it: to like it
afterward, as well as before; this puts the soul fully under the power of sin;
what can it give more?

This (as one says) in direct opposition to the Apostle, Romans 12. 1. is to
present their bodies a dead Sacrifice, Mr. Caryl.
unholy, and abominable to God; acceptable to the Devil, which is their
unreasonable service: all Men by nature are given to sin, but these men give
themselves to it.

2. Secondly, The customary practice of sin, subjects the soul to the Dominion
of sin: and so he that is born of God, does not commit sin, 1 John 3. 9. Fall
into sin, yea the same sin he may, and that often; but then it is not without
reluctance, repentance, and a protest ent^ed by the soul in Heaven against it:
So that sin has not a quiet possession of his Soul; he is not the servant of
sin, nor does he willingly walk after its Commandments: but so do its own
Servants; it is their daily practice: Ier. 9. 3. They proceed from evil to evil.

3. Thirdly, Delight in sin proves the dominion of sin. So the Servants of sin
are described, Isa. 66. 3. They have chosen their own ways, and their soul
delights in their abominations.

Look as our delight in God is the measure of our holiness; so our delight in
sin is the measure of our sinfulness. Delight in sin is one of the uppermost
rounds of the Ladder, and much higher the soul of a sinner cannot go, till it
be turned off into Hell. It Is a sport to a fool to do mischief. Prove. 10. 23.
Never merrier than when he has the Devil for his play-fellow, says one upon
that place: Mr. Trap.

4. Fourthly, Impatience of Christ's Yoke and Government, argues the soul to be
the subject of sin. This is clear from the Apostles reasoning in Romans 6. 17,
18. But God be thanked that ye were the Servants of sin, but you have obeyed
from the heart the form of doctrine which was delivered you: being then made
free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness: where you see plainly,
that no man can have his manumission or freedom from sin, that comes not into
Christ's service, and yields himself up to his obedience.

So then to fret at Christ's Laws that tie us up from our Lusts, to be weary of
all spiritual employments as a burden intolerable, never to be in our Element
and Center till we are off from God, and plunging in the world, and our lusts;
this is a sad note of a soul in subjection to sin.

Object. But may not an upright soul find some weariness in spiritual things?

Sol. Doubtless he may, for he has flesh as well as spirit, and though the
spirit be willing, the flesh is weak: he is sanctified but in part, and his
delight in the Law of God is but according to, or after the inner man, Romans 7.
22. but he sees another law in his members, (i.e) contrary inclinations.
However, if he be weary sometimes in the duties of Godliness, to be sure he is
more weary out of 'em, and is not Centred and at rest till he be with his God
again: But the Carnal heart is where it would be when it is in the service of
sin: and as a Fish upon dry land, when engaged in spiritual duties. Especially
such as are secret, and have no external allurements of reputation to engage
him to them.

But what surprisals or captivities to sin soever may befall an upright soul,
yet it appears by these eight following particulars, that he is not the servant
of sin, nor in full subj^ction to it. For,

1. First, Though he may be drawn to sin, yet he cannot reflect upon his sin
without shame and sorrow; which plainly shows it to be an involuntary surprise.
So Peter wept bitterly, Mat. 26. 75. and David mou^ned for his sin heartily;
others can fetch new pleasures out ^f their old sins by reflecting on them: and
^me can glory in their shame, Phil. 3. 19. ^ome are stupid and senseless after
sin, and ^he sorrow of a carnal heart for it, is but a ^orning dew: but it is
far otherwise with God's people.

2. Secondly, Though a Saint may be drawn (...) sin, yet it is not with a
deliberate and full ^nsent of his will: their delight is in the law (...) God,
Romans 7. 22. They do that which they ^ould not, ver. 16. (i. e.) there are
inward ^islikes from the new nature: and as for that ^ase of David, which seems
to have so much (...) counsel and deliberation in it; yet it was ^t in a single
act; it was not in the general ^ourse of his life: he was upright in all things
(i.e.) in the general course and tenor of his ^fe, 1 King. 15. 5.

3. Thirdly, Though an upright soul may fall ^to sin, yet he is restless and
unquiet in that ^ondition; like a bone out of joint: and ^at speaks him to be
none of sins Servants: (...) on the contrary, if a Man be engaged in ^^e
external duties of Religion, and be rest^ss and unquiet there; his heart is not
in it, ^e is not at rest till he be again in his earth^^ business; this Man
cannot be reckoned ^hrists Servant: a gracious heart is much ^ter that rate
employed in the work of sin, ^at a carnal heart is when employed in the ork of
Religion: that is a good rule, ea tantum dicuntur inesse, quae insunt per modum
qui it is: that is a man's true temper wherein (...) is at rest: poor David fell
into sin, but he h^^ no rest in his bones because of it, Psalm. 51.1^ 11, 12. if
his heart be off from God and d^^ty for a little while, yet he recollects
himself, and says, as Psalm. 116. 7. Return unto t^ rest O my soul.

4. Fourthly, Though a sincere Christian f^ into sin, and commit evil; yet he
proceeds (...) from evil to evil, as the ungodly do: Ier. 9. but makes his fall
into one sin, a caution prevent another sin. Peter by his fall got est
blishment for time to come: if God w^ speak peace to them, they are careful to
(...) turn no more to folly, Psalm. 85. 8. In that sorrowed after a godly sort,
what carefulness wrought? yea what fear? 2 Cor. 7. 11. It is (...) so with the
Servants of sin, one sin lea^ them much more disposed to another sin.

5. Fifthly, A sincere Christian may be dra^ to sin, but yet he would be glad
with all heart to be rid of sin. It would be more him than thousands of gold or
silver, that might grieve and offend God no more; a^^ that shows sin is not in
dominion over hi^ he that is under the dominion of sin, is l^ to leave his
Lusts. Sins servants are not ^^ling to part with it, they hold it fast, and
fuse to let it go, as that Text expresses it, 8. 5. but the great complaint of
the upri^^^^ ^s expressed by the Apostle according to the ^rue sense of their
hearts, in Romans 7. 24. Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?

6. Sixthly, It appears they yield not themselves willingly to obey sin, in as
much as it is ^he matter of their joy when God orders any ^rovidence to prevent
sin in them: Blessed ^e the Lord (said David to Abigail) and blessed ^e thy
advice, and blessed be thou, that have kept ^^ne this day from shedding blood,
1 Samuel 15. 32, 33.

Here Is blessing upon blessing for a sin-preventing providence. The Author is
blessed, ^he Instrument blessed, the Means blessed. O it is a blessed thing in
the eyes of a sincere man to be kept from sin: he reckons it a great
deliverance, a very happy escape if he ^e kept from sin.

7. Seventhly, This shows that some who may be drawn to commit sin, yet are
none of the Servants of sin, That they do heartily ^eg the assistance of grace
to keep them from ^in: keep back thy servant from presumptuous (...) (says the
Psalmist, Psalm. 19. 13.) let them ^ot have dominion over me; q. d. Lord, I find
^ropensions to sin in my nature; yea, and strong ^nes too; if thou leave me to
my self, I am ^arried into sin as easily as a Feather down ^e Torrent. O Lord
keep back thy servant: and there is no petition that upright ones our out their
hearts to God in, either more ^equently, or more ardently than in this, (...)
be kept back from sin.

8. Eighthly, and Lastly, This shows the soul not to be under the dominion of
sin, that it does not only cry to God to be kept back from sin, but uses the
means of prevention himself; he resists it, as well as pray aginst it, Psalm.
18. 23. I was also upright before him, and kept my self from mine iniquity, So
Job 31. 1. I have made a Covenant with mine eyes; and yet more fully in Isa.
33. 15. he shakes his hands from holding bribes, and stops his ears from
hearing blood; and shuts his eyes from seeing evil. See with what care the
portals are shut at which sin uses to enter. All these things are very
relieving considerations to poor souls questioning their integrity under the
frequent surprisals of sin. And the next trial no less.

SECT VIII.
(5.) FIfthly, Our opposition to and conflict^ with sin, discover what we are
gold, or dross.

There are conflicts with sin both in the regenerate, and in the unregenerate;
but there is a vast difference betwixt them, as will appear in the following
account.

1. First, There is an universal, and there (...) a particular opposition to
sin; the former (...) found in regenerate, the latter in unregene^rate souls: a
gracious heart hates every false way, Psalm. 119. 104. and must needs do so
because he hates and opposes sin as sin; s^ ^^at he can no peccatum in
deliciis; no ex^epted or reserved Lust; but fights against ^^e whole body, and
every limb and mem^er of the body of sin.

But it is not so with the Hypocrite or car^l Professor: he has evermore some
reser^^^d sin, that he cannot part with.

2. Secondly, There is an opposition be^ixt the new nature and sin, and there
is an ^position betwixt natural Conscience and sin; ^^e former is the case of
an upright soul, the ^ter may be of a self-deceiver.

A regenerate Person opposes sin, because ^ere is an irreconcilable Antipathy
betwixt and the new nature in him, as is clear ^om Gal. 5. 17. The flesh
lusts against the spi^, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are
^^trary the one to the other: by flesh under^nd corrupt Nature; by spirit not
only the ^irit of Man, but the spirit of God, or prin^^le of Regeneration in
Man: by the lust^ of these two against each other, under^^nd the desire and
endeavor of each others ^^struction and ruin: and the ground of all ^s is the
contrariety of these two natures.

These are contrary one to the other: there is wofold opposition betwixt them,
one for^l, their very natures are opposite; the ^er effective, their workings
and designs are posite, as it is betwixt fire and water.

But the oppositions found in unrenewed Souls against sin, is not from their
nature for sin is suitable enough to that; but from the light that is in their
minds and conse ences which scares and terrifies them. Suc was that in Darius,
Dan. 6. 14. He was so displeased with himself, and set his heart on Dani to
deliver him; and labored till the going dow of the Sun to deliver him: here
the contest wa^ betwixt sense of honor upon one side, an conviction of
Conscience on the other sid^

Sometimes a generous and noble disposit on opposes sordid and base actions:
maj^ sum, and ad majora natus; quam ut corpor is m sim mancipium. I am greater,
and born ^ greater things; than that I should be a slaw to my Body, said a
brave Heathen.

3. Thirdly, There is a permanent, and the^^ is a transient opposition to sin;
the former the case of God's People, the latter of ^en^^ porary and unsound
Professors.

The Saint when he draws the sword this warfare against sin, throws away th
scabbard; no end of this combat with sin t^^ life end; their life and their
troubles are nished together, 2 Timothy 4. 7. I have fought t^^ good fight, and
have finished my Course.

But in other Men it is but a transie quarrel; out with sin one day, and in an^
there; and the reason is plain by what w^^ noted before; it is not the
opposition two natures: it is like the opposition of t^^ Wind and Tide, these
may be contrary and make a stormy sea to day; but the wind may come about, and
go as the T-yde goes ^o morrow: but in a Christian it is as the ^pposition of
the river and the dam, one must give way to the other, there is no reconciling
them: but the other like the dog, ^eturns to his vomit, 2 Pet. 2. ult.

4. Fourthly, There is an opposition to he root of sin, and an opposition to
the fruits of sin. A gracious soul opposes root and fruit, but others the
latter only. The great design of an upright soul, is not only to lop off this
or that branch, but to kill the root of sin which is in his nature, Romans 7.

24. Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? but the great care and
endeavors of others is to suppress outward acts of sin, and escape the
mischievous consequents of it: yea, their study is as Lactantius phraseth it,
Potius abscondere, quam abscindere vitia: to hide, rather than to kill their
Lusts.

5. Fifthly, There is an opposition to sin, in the strength of God, and an
opposition to sin, in our own strength: The former is proper to a real
Christian, the later is found frequently with unsanctified persons: when a
Christian goes forth against any sin, it is in the strength of God: So you read
their rule directs them, Ephesians. 6. 10. Be strong in the Lord, and the power of
his might: take unto you the whole armor of God: and suitab^^ you shall find
them frequently upon the^ knees begging strength from heaven again^ their
Lusts; 2 Cor. 12. 8. For this cause I b^ sought the Lord thrice, says Paul (i.
e.) Often and earnestly, that the temptation mig^^ depart from him.

But Others go forth against sin only i^ the strength of their own resolutions;
so di^ Pendleton in our story: these Resolutions, o^ vows which they have put
themselves under are as frequently frustrated, as made.

6. Sixthly, There is a successful oppositio^ to sin, and an opposition that
comes to n^^thing. The former is that of true Christian^ the later is found
among unregenerate me^^

The work of Mortification in the Saint^ is progressive, and increasing: hence
Romans 6. 6 Our old man is Crucified with him, that the bo^dy of sin might be
destroyed. Sin dies in be^lievers much what as crucified persons use t^ ^^ye;
viz. a slow, lingering, gradual, bu^ sure death: its vigor and life expires by
degrees: or as a consumptive person dies for to that also he alludes here:
there is ^ disease which is called Consumptio totius, a Consumption of the
whole, and those tha^ dye of that disease languish more and more, till at last
they drop sensim, sine sensu, by imperceptible degrees and steps into the grave.

But in the unregenerate whatever conflicts they have with sin; no corruption
falls before it: it may be said of them, as the Church in another case
complains of her self, Esa. 26. 18. We have been in* pain, we have as it were
brought forth wind, we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth, neither
have the inhabitants of the world fallen. So it fares with these professors,
they pray, they hear, they vow, they resolve; but when all is done, their lusts
are as strong and vigorous as ever: no degree of mortification appears after
all.

And thus much of the trial of our sincerity by our carriage toward sin.

CHAP. VII.
Showing what proof and trial is made of the soundness or unsoundness of our
graces by the duties of Religion which we perform.
SECT. I.
WE now come (according to the method proposed) to make trial of the truth of
falseness of grace* by the duties we daily perform in Religion* And certainly
they also h^ve the use and efficacy of fire, for this discovery, 1 John 2* 4,
5. He that says I know him, and keeps not his Commandments [is a lyar] and
he truth is not in him: but whosoever keeps his word, i^ him verily is the love
of God perfected: an^ hereby know we that we are in him.

This is a practical lie; of which the Apostle speaks here, by which men
deceive^ other (...) while, and themselves for ever: a lie not spoken, but
done; when a man's course of life contradicts his profession. The life of an
Hypocrite is but one long o^ continued lie: he says or professes he knows
God, but takes no care at all to obey him in the duties he commands: he either
neglects them, or if he perform them, it is not as God requires: if they draw
nigh ^ him with their lips, yet. their heart is far from him, Isa. 29. 13. Thou
art near in their mouth, but far from their reins, Jer. 12. 2.

There are some that feel the influence and power of their Communion with the
Lord in duties, going down to their very reins: and there are others whose lips
and tongues only are touched with Religion.

This is an age of light and much profession: men cannot now keep up a
reputa^ion in the sober and professing world, whilst they let down, and
totally neglect the duties of Religion: but surely if men would be but just to
themselves, their very performances of duty would tell them what their hearts
are.

SECT. II.
FOr there among others these following particulars, that do very clearly
diffe^ence he sound from the unsound prfessour.

1. First, The designs and true Levels and ^aims of men's hearts in duty will
tell them what they are.

An Hypocrite aims Low, Hosea 7. 14. They have not cried unto me with their
heart, when they ^owled upon their beds; they assembled themselves for Corn and
Wine, and they rebel against me. It is not for Christ, and pardon, ^or
mortification, and holiness; but for corn, and wine, thus they make a Market of
Re^igion; all their ends in duty are either carnal, natural, or legal; it is
either to accommodate their carnal ends, or satisfy and quiet their
Consciences: and so their duties are performed as a sin-offering to God.

But an upright heart, has very high, and pure aims in duty; the desire of
their ^oul is to God, Isa. 26. 8. their soul follows ^ard after God, Psalm. 63.
8. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I might
dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to see the beauty of
the Lord; and to enquire in his Temple, Psalm. 27. 4. These are the true Eagles
that play at the Sun, and will not stoop to low and earthly objects. Alas! if
the enjoyment of God be missed ^n a duty, it is not the greatest enlargements
of gifts will satisfy: he comes back like a man that has taken a long journey
to meet his friend upon important business; and lost ^is labor; his friend was
not there.

2. Secondly, The engagements of men^ hearts to God in duties will tell them
wha^ they are. The hypocrite takes little heed to^ his heart, Esa. 29. 13. they
are not afflicted really for the hardness, deadness, unbelief* and wanderings
of their hearts in duty; as upright ones are: nor do they engage their hearts,
and labor to get them up with God^ in duty as his people do. I have intreate^
thy favor with my whole heart, says David. Psalm. 119. 58. they are not
pleased in duty till they feel their hearts stand toward God like a bow in its
full bent. I say not it is always so with them, what would they give that it
might be so! but surely if their souls in duty be empty of God, they are filled
with trouble and sorrow.

3 Thirdly, The Conscience men make o^ secret as well as of public duties,
will tel^ them what their hearts and graces are, true, or false. A vain
Professor is curious in the former, and either negligent, or at best formal in
the latter: for he finds no inducement^ of honor, applause, or o^tentation of
gift^ externally moving him to them: nor has he any experience of the
sweetness and benefit of such duties internally to allure and engage his soul
to them.

The Hypocrite therefore is not for the closet* but the Synagogue, Matthew. 6. 5.
6. not bu^ that education, example, or the impulse o^ conscience may sometimes
drive him thither; but it is not his daily delight to be there; his meat and
drink to retire from the clamor of the world to enjoy God in secret. ^Tis the
observation of their duties is the great inducement to these men to perform
them; and verily says our Lord, ver. 2. they have their reward, (...) they
have it away; or they have carried off all the benefit and advantage that ever
they shall have by Religion. Much good do them with their applause and honor,
let them make much of that aerie reward, for it is all that ever they shall have.

But now for a soul truly gracious, he cannot long subsist without secret
prayer. It Is true, there is not always an equal freedom and delight, a like
enlargement and comfort in those retirements: but yet he cannot be without
them: he finds the want of his secret, in his public duties: if he and his God
have not met in secret, and had some Communion in the morning, he sensibly
finds it in the deadness and unprofitableness of his heart and life all the day
after.

4. Fourthly, The spirituality of our duties tryes the sincerity of our graces:
an unregenerate heart is carnal, whilst engaged in duties that are spiritual.
Some men deceive themselves in thinking they are spiritual men, because their
employment and calling is about spiritual things, Hosea 9. 7. this indeed gives
them the denomination, but not the frame of spiritual men: and others judge
themselves spiritual persons, because they frequently perform and attend upon
spiritual duties: but alas the heart and state may be carnal notwithstanding
all this. O my friends, it is not enough that the object of your duties is
spiritual, that they respect an holy God; nor that the matter be spiritual,
that you be conversant about holy things; but the frame of your heart must be
spiritual, an heavenly temper of soul is necessary, and what are the most
heavenly duties without it?

The end and design you aim at must be spiritual, the enjoyment of God, and a
growing conformity to him in holiness; else, multiply duties as the sand on the
sea shore, and they all will not amount to one evidence of your ^incerity. God
is my witness whom I serve with my spirit, says the Apostles, Rom* 1. 9. he
seems to appeal to God in this matter. I serve God in my spirit, and God knows
that I do so. I dare appeal to him that it is so: he knows that my heart is
with him, or would be with him in my duties: the arms of my faith do either*
^ensibly grasp, or are stretched out toward him in my duties. O how little
^avour do gracious hearts find in the most excellent duties, if God and their
souls do not sensibly meet in them!

Certainly Reader, There is a time when God comes nigh to men in duty, when he
deals familiarly with men, and sensibly fills their souls with unusual powers
and delights. The near approaches of God to their souls are felt by them, (for
souls have their senses as well as bodies;) and now are their minds abstracted
and marvellously refined from all that is material and earthly, and swallowed
up in spiritual excellencies and glories.

These are the real prelibations or foretastes of glory, which no man can by
words make another to understand, as he himself does that feels them.

These seasons I confess do but rarely occur to the best of Christians, Rara
hora, brevis mora; fapit quidem suavissime, sed gustatur rarissime. B^rnard.
nor continue long when they do: alas! this wine is too strong for such weak
bottles as we are. Hold Lord (said an holy man once) it is enough* thy poor
creature is a clay vessel, and can hold no more: this is that Joy unspeakable
and full of glory, which is mentioned, 1 Pet. 1. 7, 8. something that words
cannot describe: these seasons are the golden spots of our lives, when we are
admitted to these near and ineffable views and tastes of God: possibly some
poor Christians can say but little to these things; their sorrows are exercised
in duties mo^^ than their Joys: they are endeavoring (...) mount, but the
stone hangs at the heel: they essay, but cannot rise to that height tha^ others
do, who are got up by their labou^^ing faith into the upper Region, and ther^
display their wings and sing in the Su^^beams: but though they cannot reach
thi^ height, yet have they no satisfaction in d^ties wherein there is no
intercourse betwix^ God and their souls.

That which contents another, will no^ content a Christian: if the King be
absent* men will bow to the empty chair; but i^ God be absent, an empty duty
gives no satisfaction to a gracious spirit. The poore^^ Chrictian is found
panting after God by sincere desires, and laboring to get up that dead and
vain heart to God in duty; though alas! it is many times but the rolling of the
returning stone against the hill: yet the never expects advantage by that duty
wherein the spirit of God is not; nor does he expect the spirit of God should
be, where hi^ own spirit is not.

5. Fifthly, Assiduity and constancy in duties of Religion makes a no^able
discovery o^ the soundness or rottenness of men's heart^ The Hypocrite may show
some zeal and fo^^wardness in duties for a time, but he will jade and give out
at length: Job 27. 10* ^ill he delight himself in the Almighty? will (...)
always call upon God? No, he will not. If ^ is motions in Religion were
natural, they would be constant; but they are artificial ande is moved by
external inducements; and so ^ust needs be off and on: he prays himself ^eary
of praying, and hears himself weary ^f hearing: his heart is not delighted in
his ^uties, and therefore his duties must needs ^row stale and dry to him after
a while. ^here be three seasons in which the zeal of ^n Hypocrite may be
inflamed in duties.

First, When some iminent danger threat^ns him, some smart rod of God is shaked
^ver him: when he slew them, then they sought im, and returned and enquired
early after God, ^sal. 78. 34* O the goodly words they give, the fair promises
they make; and yet all the ^hile they do but flatter him with their lips, and
^ye unto him with their tongues, ver. 36, 37. ^or let but that danger pass
over, and the ^^eavens clear up again, and he will restrain ^rayer, and return
to his old course ^gain.

Secondly, When the times Countenance and favor Religion, and the wind is in
his ^ack: O what a zeal will he have for God* ^o in the stony ground, Matthew.
13* 5. the ^eed sprung up and flou^ished till the sun ^f persecution arose, and
then it f^ded away; for it had no depth of earth: no deep solid inward work or
principle of grace (...) maintain it.

Thirdly, When self^ends and designs at ^ accommodated and promoted by these
things this was the case of Ie^u, 2 Kings (...) 16. come see my zeal, for what?
for a ba^^ self-interest, not for God: how ferventl^ will some men pray,
preach, and profel^ whilst they sensibly feel the incomes and profit of these
duties to their flesh: whilst the^ a^e admired and applauded!

These external incentives will put an hy^pocrite into an hot fit of zeal, but
then as (...) is with a man whose colors are raised b^ the heat of the fire,
and not by the heal^h^ fullness of a good constitution; it soon fade^ and falls
again.

But blessed be God it is not so with all The man whose heart is upright with
his God, will keep judgment, and do righteousnes^ at all time^, Psalm. 106. 3.
whether dange^^ threaten or no; whether times favor Religion no no; whether
his earthly interest b^ promoted by it or no; he will be holy still: he will
not part with his duties when they a^^ stripped naked of those external
advantages: as the addition of these things to Religion di^ not at first engage
him, so the substraction o^ them, cannot disengage him.

If his duty become his reproach, yet Mose^ will not forsake it: Heb. 11* 26.
If he lose^^ company, and be left alone, yet Paul will ^ot flinch from his
duty, 2 Timothy 4. 16. if ^azard surround duty on every side, yet Da^el, will not
quit it, Dan. 6. 10* for they con^dered these things at first, and counted the
^st, they still find Religion is rich enough (...) pay the cost of all that
they can lose or ^ffer for its sake; yea, and that with an ^undred-fold reward,
now in this life. They ^^ver had other design in engaging in Re^gious duties,
but to help them to heaven, ^d if they recover heaven at last; whether ^e way
to it prove better, or worse; they ^ve their design, and ends: and therefore
^ey will be steadfast, always abounding in ^e work of the Lord, as knowing
their ^^our is not in vain in the Lord, 1 Cor. ^. ult.

6. Sixthly, The humility and self-denial (...) our hearts in duties will try
what they ^e for their integrity and sincerity toward ^od. Does a man boast
his own excellencies (...) prayer as the Pharisee did, Luke 18. 10, (...) God I
thank thee I a^ not as other men: which he speaks not in an humble
acknow^gement of the grace of God which dif^ences man from man; but in a proud
^entation* of his own excellencies? Does (...) man make his duties his
Saviors, and trust (...) them in a vain confidence of their worth ^d^dignity?
Luke 18. 9. Surely his heart which is thus lifted up within him, is ^ upright,
Hab. 2. 4. But if the heart be (...) right indeed, it will express its
humility, (...) in all other things, so especially in its dut^^ wherein it
approaches the great and ho^ God.

First, It will manifest its humility in th^^ awful and reveren^ial
apprehensions it h^^ of God, as Abraham did, Genesis 18. 27. (...) now I that am
but dust and ashes (says (...) have taken upon me to speak unto God. T^
humility of Abraham's spirit is in some mea^^ to be found in all Abraham's
Children.

Secondly, In those low and vile thoug^^ they have of themselves, and their
religi^ performances: thus that poor peni^^^ Luke 7. 38. stood behind Christ
weepi^^ yet the dogs eat the crumbs, says anot^^ Mark 7. 28. I am more brutish
than ^ man, says a third, Prove. 30. 7. I abho^^ self in dust and ashes, says
a fourth, Iob^ 6. and as little esteem they have for t^^ performances, Esa, 64.
6. all our righteous^^^ are as filthy rags. I deny not but the^^ pride and
vanity in the most upright o^^ but what place soever it finds in their ^ ver^es
with men, it finds little room in t^^ converses with God; or if it do, they lo^
it, and themselves for i^.

Thirdly. But especially their humility duty is discovered in renouncing all
t^^ ^uties in point of dependence, and relying ^tirely upon Christ for
righteousness, and ^cceptance: they have special regard to du^^es in point of
obedience, but none at all in ^oint of Relyance.

7. Seventhly, The Communion and intercourse which is betwixt God and men in
duties, ^otably discovers what their persons and ^races are. And it must needs
do so, because that communion soever the hypocrite has ^ith duties, or with
Saints in duties; to ^e sure he has none with God.

None can come nigh to God in duty, but ^ose that are made nigh by
reconciliation: (...) special Communion with Christ, is found^^ in real union
with Christ: but The wick^^ are estranged from the womb, Psalm. 58. 3.

But now there is real communion betwixt ^od and his people in duties. Truly
our^ llowship, (...), our Communion is with ^e Father and Son, 1 Ioh. 1. 3. God
pours ^rth of his spirit upon them, and they pour ^ ^th their hearts to God. It
is sensibly ma^fest to them when the Lord comes nigh ^ their souls in duty, and
as sensible they ^e of his retreats and withdraw^ents from ^^eir souls, Cant.
3. 1, 4. They find their ^arts like the Heliotrope, open and shut ac^^rding to
the accesses and recesses of the ^vine presence. They that never felt any ^ing
of this nature, may call it a fancy, but the Lords people are abundantly
satisfied of the reality thereof.

Their very Countenance is altered by it, 1 Samuel 1. 18. the sad and cloudy
countenance of Hannah, cleared up, there was fai^ weather in her very face,
as soon as she kne^ she had audience and acceptance with he^ God. I know all
communion with God does not consist in joys and Comforts, the^^ is as real
communion with God in the mo^^tifying and humbling influences of his spi^i^
upon men, as in the cheering and refreshing influences thereof. I know also
there is ^ great diversity in the degrees and measu^^ thereof. It is not alike
in all Christians, no^ with the same Christian at all times: b^ that real
Christians have true and real Co^^munion with God in their duties, is a tru^ as
manifest in spiritual sense and expe^^^ence of the Saints, as their Communion ^
one with another.

8. Eighthly, Growth and improvement ^ grace in duties notably differences the
soun^ and unsound heart. All the duties in t^^ world will never make an
hypocrite mo^ holy, humble, or heavenly than he is: b^ as the watering of a dry
stick will soon rot it, than make it flourishing and frui^^ What was ^^udas the
better for all those h^^^venly sermons, prayers, and discourses Christ which he
heard? and what (...) ^y soul be the better for all the duties thou ^erformest
weekly and daily if thy heart be ^nsound? It Is plain from Ioh. 15. 4. there
^ust be an implantation into Christ, before ^ere can be an improvement in
fruitful o^edience. And it is as plain from 1 John ^. 14. that the virtues of
the ordinances must ^emain, the efficacy and powers that we ^ometimes feel
under them, must abide and ^emain in the heart afterward; or we cannot grow,
and be made fruitful by them.

But the false professor is neither rooted ^n Christ by union with him, nor
does or ^an retain the virtue of ordinances within ^im: but like one that views
his face in a glass, quickly forgets what manner of man he was: his head indeed
may grow, his know^edge may increase, but he has a dead and withered heart.

But as the Saints have real Communion with God in duties, so they do make
im^rovements answerable thereunto: there is ^ost certainly a ripening of their
graces that way; a changing or gradual transformation from glory to glory; a
springing up to that ^ull stature of the man in Christ. They that ^re planted
in the house of the Lord, shall flourish ^n the Courts of our God, Psalm. 92.
13, 14. There is pure and sincere milk in the breasts ^f ordinances: a believer
sucks the very ^reasts of Christ in his duties, and does grow 1 Pet. 2. 2. they
do grow more and more judicious, experienced, humble, mortified and heavenly,
by conversing with the Lord so frequently in his appointments.

There is I confess a more discernable growth and ripening in some Christians,
tha^ in others: the faith of some grows exceedingly, 2 These. 1. 3. others
more slowly* Heb. 5. 12. but yet there are improvements of grace in all upright
ones: habits are more deeply radicated, or fruits of obedience more increased.

Obj. If any upright soul be* ^tumbled at this, (...) not being able to discern
the increase of h^^ graces after all his duties.

Sol. Let such consider the growth o^ grace is discerned as the growth of
plants is, which we perceive rather Crevisse, qua^^ crescere: to have grown,
than to grown: compare time past and present, and yo^ may see it: but usually
our eager desires after more, make us over look what we have as nothing.

9. Nint^ly, The assistances and influences of the spirit in duties, shows us
what we are: no vital sanctifyi^g influences can fall upon carnal hearts in
duties. The spirit helps no^ their infirmities, nor makes intercession for them
with groanings which cannot be u^tered, as he does for his own people: Rom* 8.
26, 27. they have his assistances in the ^^y of common gifts, but not in the
way ^ special grace: he may enable them to ^ach judiciously, not
experimentally: to pray ^erly and neatly, not feelingly, believingly, ^d broken
heartedly: for as many as are by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God,
^m. 8. 14. he never so assists, but where he ^h first sanctified. Carnal men
furnish the ^^erials of their duties out of the strength their parts; a strong
memory, a good in^tion are the fountains whence they draw. But it is otherwise
with souls truly gra^us: they have ordinarily a three fold a^^ance form the
spirit in reference to their ^ies.

First, Before duties, exciting t^em to it; ^^ing them feel their need of it:
like the ^l of an empty stomach: Psalm, 27. 8. Thou (...), Seek my face: my
heart answered, Thy ^ Lord Will I seek.

Secondly, In their duties, furnishing both ^tter and affection; as in that
text lately ^ed, Romans 8. 26. guiding them not only ^ at to ask, but how to ask.

Thirdly, after their duties, helping them (...) only to suppress the pride and
vanity of ^ir spirits, but also to wait on God for (...) accomplishment of
their desires.

Now though all these things wherein the ^^e^ity of our hearts is tried in
duties, be and in great variety (asto degrees) among Saints, yet they are
mysteries unknown (...) experience to other men.

CHAP. VIII.
Opening the Trials of sincerity and hypocrisy sufferings upon the account of
Religion.
SECT. I.
WE are now arrived at (...) la^t trial of grace propo^ ded, viz. bv sufferings
for Religion.

Thousands of Hypocrites embarque the^ selves in the profession of Religion i^
Calm; but if the wind rises, and the (...), and they see Religion will not
tra^^^port them safely to the Cape of their eart^ hopes and expectations; they
desire to (...) landed again as soon as may be, for they (...) intended to ride
out a strom for Ch^^^^ so you find Matthew. 13. 20, 21. He du^^^ for a while, but
when tribulation or persecu^ arises because of the word, by and by he is offen^

But yet it is not every Trial by sufferi^ that seperates gold form dross, and
there^^ my business will be to show,

1. First, When the fire of sufferings ^ persecution is hot and vehement enough
separate them.

2. Secondly, Why it must needs disco^^ hypocrisy when it is at that height.

3. Thirdly, What advantages sin^^ Grace has to endure that severe and she
tr^al.

SECT. II.
NOW the fire of persecution or sufferings for Religion may be judged ^^ense
and high enough to separate gold and dross.

First, When Religion exposess us to emi^ent hazard of our deepest and dearest
in^^rests in this world. Such are our liberties, ^tates, and lives: now'tis a
fierce and fiery ^yal indeed. Sometimes it exposes the li^erties of its
professors, Revel. 2. 10. The ^vil shall cast some of you into prison:
some^mes their estates, Heb. 10. 34. ye took joy^lly the spoiling of your
goods; and sometimes ^eir lives, Heb. 11. 37. They were stoned they ^ere sawn
asunder, they were slain with the lord. Whilst it goes no higher than some
^all inconveniences of life, rep^^ation and ^nse of honor will hold a false
heart; ^t when it comes to this, few will be found ^le to endure it, but those
that expect to ^ve no ^ore by Religion but their souls, and ^count themselves
in good case if they can ^t save them, with the loss of all that is dear (...)
them in this world.

Here the false heart boggles, here it usual^ades and fau^ters.

Secondly; The fiery Trial is then high, ^hen there remains no visible ho^es of
deli^rance or outward encouragements to sense, that the Scene, will alter: when
we see not ou^ Signs, there is no more any prophet; nor any tha^ can tell us
how long, as the case with the Church was in Psalm. 74. 9. then their hands hang
down, and their hearts faint: nor is it to be wondered at, when the length of
trouble^ prove so sore a temptation even to the up^right, to put forth their
hands to iniquity, a^ it is Psalm. 125. 3. if such a temptation shak^ such men
as build on the rock, it must qui^^ overturn those whose foundation is b^^ sand.

Thirdly, When a false professor is enga^ged alone in sufferings, and is
singled o^^ from the herd as a deer to be run down now it is a thousand to one
but he quits Re^ligion to save himself: good company wi^ encourag^ a faint
hearted traveller to jogg (...) a great way: but if he be forsaken by all*
(...) Paul was, no man to stand by him if left ^lone, as Elijah was, what can
encourage hi^ to hold out?

Indeed if they had the same invisible s^^ports those good men had, that the
Lord w^ with them, that would keep them steady but wanting that encouragement
from wit^ in, and all shrinking away from without they quickly tire downright.

Fourthly, When near relations and in ^ mates oppose and tempt us. The Prop^
speaks of a time When a man's (...) shall be the men of his own house, it may be
^he wife of his bosom, Mica. 7. 5, 6. O that a trial is that which Christ
mentions ^n Luke 14. 26. when we must hate Father and Mother, Wife and
Children, or quit ^laim to Christ and heaven! This is hard ^ork indeed.

How hard did that truly noble and re^owned Galeacius Caracciolus find this! O
that a conflict found he in his bowels! Now christ and our dearest interest
come to meet ^ke two men upon a narrow bridge, if one (...) forward, the other
must go back, and ^w the predominant interest can no long^ be concealed.

Fifthly, When powerful temptations are ^ixed with cruel sufferings, when we
are ^ongly tempted, as well as cruelly persecu^d; this blows up the fire to a
vehement ^ight. This was the trial of those preci^s primitive believers, He^.
11. 35, 37. They ^re stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were ^pted: here was
life, liberty and prefer^nt set upon one hand; and death in the ^st formidable
shape upon the other. This ^not but be a great trial to any: but es^ially when
a cruel death, and tender temp^eet; then the trial goes high indeed.

SECT. III.
ANd that such sufferings as these will discover the falseness and rottenness
of men's hearts cannot be doubted, if yo^ consider that this is the fire
designed b^ God for this very use and purpose to sep^ rate the gold from the
dross, so you will fin^ it, 1. Pet. 4. 12. Beloved think it (...) strange
concerning the fiery tyral, which is (...) try you,(i.e.) the very design and
aim ^ providence in permitting and ordering the^ is to try you. The design of
Satan is to d^ stroy you, but Gods design is to try you. U^ on this account you
find the hour of pe^^ ^ cution (in a suitable notion) called the (...) of
temptation, or probation, Rev. 3. 10. (...) then professors are sifted to the
very bra^^ ^earched to the very bottom principles. T^^ is the day that burns as
an Oven, in which (...) the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be as
^^^^ble, Mal. 4. 1. for,

1. First, In that day the predominant ^^terest must appear, and be discovered:
it (...) be concealed no longer, no man can (...) two masters, says Christ,
Luke 16. 13. as may serve many masters, if they all comma^^ the same things, or
things subordinate (...) each other; but he cannot serve two ma^ers if their
Commands clash and interf^^ with each other; and such are the (...) of Chirst
and the flesh in a suff^^^ing hour: Christ says, ^e thou f^ithful to death;
the flesh says, spare thy self* and (...) the comforts of life. Christ says,
He (...) (...) Father, or Mother, Wife or Children, ^ ands or Inheritances more
than me, is not ^orthy of me. Flesh says, he that will grieve ^^d break the
hearts of such dear relations, ^^d forsake when he might keep such earth^
accommodations, is not worthy of them.

Thus the two interests come in sull oppo^ion: and now have but patience to
wait little, and you shall discern which is pre^ominant. A dog follows tow men
while they ^^th walk one way; and you know not which of the two is his master;
stay but a little (...) their path parts, and then you shall quick^ see who is
his master. So is it in this case.

2. Secondly, In that day sen^ible supports ^^l, and all a man's relief comes in
by the ^^re and immediate actings of faith; and ^ere it not for those reliefs,
his heart would ^on faint and dye away under discourage^ents, 2. Cor. 4. 17,
18. We faint not, whilst (...) look not at the things which are seen, for they
(...) temporal, but at the things which are not seen, (...) they are External:
q.d longer than we ^eep our eye intently fixed upon the invisi^e and eternal
things in the coming world; (...) feel our selves fainting, and dying away
^^der the troubles and afflictions of this world. ^ad fainted(says David) if I
had not believed. ^ow then suppose ye shall the Hypocrite live (...) such a
time, who has no fiath to support ^m? no relief but what comes in through
(...) senses?

3. Thirdly, In that day all mere Notion and Speculations about Religion
vanish, an^ nothing relieves and satisfies the suffe^ing soul, but what it
really believes, and what (...) has satisfying proof and experience of (...)
himself There are a great many p^et^^ pleasing notions with which our minds a^^
entertained with some delight in times (...) peace, which can do us no service
at all i^ the day of trouble: and for our speculati^^ unpracticable knowledge
of the greate^^ truths in Religion, as little service is to be ex^pected form
them. Except we have bette^ evidence and security about them, we shall beloth
to venture all upon the credit of them that is a very considerable passage to
this pu^^pose in Heb. 10. 34. Ye took joyfully the spoi^^ing of your goods,
[knowing in your selves.] the ye have in heaven a better and more enduring
substance: this knowing in our selves is by i^ ward sensible experience, taste,
and feeling which is abundantly satisfying to the soul and ^tands opposed to
all that tradition^ knowledge we receive from others; which as it leaves the
mind flucturating, so the hea^ also dead and comfortless.

4. Fourthly, In that day the root and found^tion of a man's faith and hope is
tried, a^^ then they that have built upon the sand mu needs fail: for every
thing is as its found^^tion is: principles are to us, what a root to a tree; or
a foundation to an house, a ^^aw, or grand defect there ruins all: this we
find to be the very scope of those two famous pa^ables, Luke 14. 25. and Matthew.
13. 21. lesser troubles shake b^t the branches, but these try the root: if
nothing be found ^here but self ends, the force of education, the ^^nfluence of
examples; surely when the winds rise high, and beat upon it, they will quickly
lay the lostiest professor even with ^he ground.

And thus you see what a Crisis an hour of temptation, the suffering hour is,
and what discoveries of Hypocrisy it must needs make; ^or now the Hypocrite
like Orpha will forsake Religion, but sincerity will make the soul ^leave to
it, as Ruth did to Naomi.

SECT. IV.
^. WHat advantages sincerity gives the soul for its establishment and
perseverance in suffering times, I shall briefly account for in the following
particulars.

1. First, Sincere godliness dethrones that Idol the love of this world, in all
true Christians; and this is it that makes men shrink and flinch from Christ in
a day of suffer^ng I do not deny but even believers themselves love the world
too much, but they love it not as their chief good; it is not their portion or
happiness, if any man so love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,
1 John 2. 15. How much soever a sincere Christian loves the world, yet still it
is in subordination to the love God, Ioh. 21* 15. Sincerity can consist with no
other love of the world; it will not suffer such a cursed (...) to grow under
its shadow.

Now, what is it but this inordinate s^pream love of the Creature that makes
me^ forsake Christ in time of temptation? this was the ruin of that young man,
Matthew. 19* 22. he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. This was
the overthrow o^ Demas, 2. Tim. 4. 10. he has forsaken m^ (says the Apostle)
having loved this present world: the lvoe of this world like sap in green wood
will not suffer you to burn for Christ; get but the heart mor^ified to the
creature, by a discovery of better things in heaven; and it will establish and
fix your spirits, that it shall not be in the power o^ creatures to shake you
off from Christ your foundation.

2. Secondly, Sincerity kni^s the soul^ to Ch^ist^ and union with him secures
us in the great trials: munimur quartenus unimur. The Hy^pocrite having no
^nion with Christ, can have no communion with him; nor communications of grace
from him; and so that little stock of his own being quickly spent, (I mean
natural courage and resoution) and no incomes form Christ, he must needs give
up in a short time; but it is with a believer in a day of trouble, as it is
with a Garrison besieged by Land, buyt free and open to the Sea; whence fresh
supplies are daily sent in to relieve it: see 2 Cor. ^. 5. as the sufferings of
Christ abound in us, so our con^^^a^ion also abounds by Christ: fresh aides
and daily supplies proportionable to our expenses, and decays of strength. So
Col. ^. (...), Strengthened with all might in the inner man, according to his
glorious power; unto all pati^nce, and long suffering with joyfulness: and this
^s the believers great advantage by his union with Christ in a day of trial.

3. Thirdly, As sincerity unites the soul with Christ, so it sets the heart
upon heaven and things eternal, Col. 3. 1. etc. surely nothing is more
conducive to our stability than his, in the hour of temptation.

This is the most effectual preservative from ^emptations upon the right hand,
and upon ^he le^t. Moses could cast a Kingdom at ^is heels, despise the riches,
pleasu^es and ho^ours of Egypt, whilst his eye was fixed up in him that is
invisible; and had respect to ^e recompense of reward, Heb. 11. 24, 25, 6. And
it was a brave reply of the Forty ^artyrs to Valence the Emperor, tempting
^^em with the preferments and honors of ^e world; why offer you these trifles
to us, when you know the whole world is contemned by us? And for temptations on
the left hand, how little can they move that soul, who realizes the glory of
the approaching world, and sees the afflictions and sufferings of this world
preparing him for, and hastening him to the enjoyment of it; temptations meet
but with cold entertainment from such souls.

4. Fourthly, Sincerity drives but one design, and that is to please and enjoy
God; and what can more establish and fix the soul in the hour of temptations
than this? The reason why the Hypocrite is unstable in all^his ways, is given
us by the Apostle James 1. 8. he is a double minded man (...) a man of two
souls in one body; as a profane wretch once boasted, that he had one soul for
God, another for any thing: but all the designs of a gracious heart, are united
in one: and so the entire stream of his affections runs strong.

It Is base by ends and self-interests, that like a great many ditches cut out
of the bank of a River, draw away the stream out of its proper Chanel, and make
its waters fail: but if the heart be united for God as the expre^^ion is, Psalm.
86. 11. then we may say of such a Christian, as was said of a young Roman,
quicquid vult, what he does, is done with all his might. And this was the
ground of valde valt; that saying, liberet me Deus ab ^omine unius tantum
negotii: a man of one only design puts to all puts to all his strength to carry
it: nothing can stand before him.

5. Fifthly, Sincerity brings a man's will into subjection to the will of God;
and this being done, the greatest danger and difficulty is over with such a
man. This is that holy oil, which makes the wheels of the soul run nimbly even
in difficult paths of obedience, non tardat uncta rota. Let but a man be once
brought to that, The will of the Lord be done; as it is, Acts 21. 13. to see
the highest reason of cheerful obedience in the holy, just and good will of
God; and then the difficulty is over: he can suffer quietly, what men inflict
unjustly.

6. Sixthly, Sincerity takes its measures of present things by the rules of
faith, and e^ernity: it goes not by the same reckoning and account that others
do, who judge of things by sense, and the respects they have to the present
world: 2 Cor. 4. 18. We look not at the things th^^ are seen, but at the things
that are not seen; and this is there given as the reason of his not fainting
under present difficulties: so Romans 8. 18. I reckon that the sufferings of the
present time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us: he will not allow himself to undervalue eternal glory by once
mentioning present sufferings, in a way of bemoaning himself for them: a steady
eye upon the other world makes us more than Conquerours over the troubles of
this world.

7. Seventhly, To conclude, Sincerity alone has all the heavenly aids and
assistances to stability and perseverance in suffering times. Upright ones (and
such only) have Christ's intercession in heaven for them, Romans 8. 34. The
spirits consolation in all their troubles, 1 Pet. 4. 14. the spirit of glory
and of God rests on them: the beneficial ministry of Angels, who are sent
forth upon their account, Heb. 1. 14. A stock of Prayers going for them all the
world over, Ephesians. 6. 18. Multitudes of precious promises in the Scriptures, for
every line, word and syllable of which the faithfulness of God stands engaged:
so that it is impossible such gold can perish in the fire.

And thus of the several ways by which grace is here tried.

CHAP. IX.
Opening the designs and ends of God in bringing of the professors of Religion
into such various Trials of their graces in this world.
SECT. I.
THese are some of the ways and methods in which God brings his Gold to the
Touchstone, and to the fire, even in this world; before the awful and solemn
Trial they must come to in the final Judgment. And if we desire to be satisfied
what the design and end of God in making such probations of his people is,

We must conclude in the general, he certainly designs his own glory, and his
peoples advantage, and profit in them. If he suffer them to be tried by
reproaches, happy are they, the spirit of God and glory rests on them;
there is their profit, and though his name be evil spoken of, yet in the
meekness of their spirits, he is glorified, as it is, 1 Pet. 4. 14. If the
scourg^ slay suddenly, he laugheth at the trial of the innocent, Job 9. 23. not
at their afflictions, but at the effects and blessed issues and results of
them: not that it gives them pain, but that it gives him glory: upon this
account the Apostle bids us count it all Joy when we fall into diverse
temptations or trials: and still the more trials the more joy; for thereby God
will produce such effects, as are more precious than gold that perishes, 1
Pet. 1. 7. O who can value the comfort that is tasted by the soul upon the
Trial and discovey of its sincerity! when after some sore temptation, wherein
God has helped us to maintain our integrity; or after some close pinching
affliction, wherein we have discovered in our selves a sweet resignation to,
and contentment in the will of God; an heart cleaving to the Lord, purged and
made more spiritual under the rod; we can turn to the Lord, and appeal to him
as the Prophet did, Ier. 12. 3. But thou O Lord know me, thou have seen me,
and tried mine heart toward thee.

I say who can duly value such an advantage, who would exchange such a comfort
^o all the gold and silver in the world! how many trials soever God brings his
poople under, to be sure neither his own glory, nor their interest shall suffer
any damage by them.

SECT. II.
BUt more particularly, let us bring our thoughts close to the matter before
us; and we shall find many great advantages and benefits rising out of these
Trials of sincerity; for,

1. First, Hereby Hypocrisy is unmasked and discovered; The vizard is plucked
off from the false professor, and his true natural face and complexion shown
to the world; and in this there is a great deal of good.

Object. Good, you will say where lies it? all the world sees the mischief and
sad effects of it; many are stumbled, many are hardened by it, woe to the world
because of offen^es, Matthew. 16. 7.

Sol. True, some are prejudiced and hardened by it, so as never to have good
thoughts of the ways and people of God more; that is sad indeed, however
therein God accomplishes his word, and executes his decree. And though these
perish; yet

First, Others are warned, awakened, and set a searching their own hearts more
narrowly than ever; and this is good: 1 Cor. 10. 11, 12. now these were our
examples, wherefore let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall.

Secondly, Hereby sin is ashamed, and it is good when sin that has exposed men
to so much shame, shall be it^self exposed to shame. This is the just reward of
sin, Ier. 13. 25, 26. This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me,
says the Lord; because thou ^ast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood,
therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appear.

The turning up the skirt is a modest expression of exposing a person to the
greatest shame: in the day of Trial, God by discovering hypocrisy shames the
hypocrite: and surely many such discoveries are made of men at this day; we may
see sin that lurked close in the heart before, now laid open before all Israel
and before the Sun.

Thirdly, Hereby the poor self-couzening hypocrite has the greatest
opportunity and advantage that ever was before him in all his life, to recover
himself out of the snare of the Devil: now all his pretenses are gone: now that
which like a shield was advanced against the arrows of reproof and convictio^
is gone: now a poor creature stands nake^ and stripped out of all his pleas as a
fair and ^ pen mark to the word, and his own conscience; and happy will it be
for him if now the Lord make conviction to enter pointblank into his^soul: all
these are blessed effects of the discovery of Hypocrisy.

2. Secondly, By these trials integrity is cleared up, and the doubts and fears
of many upright and holly ones allayed and quieted, resolved and satisfied.

O what would many a poor Christian give for satisfaction in that great point
o^ sincerity! how many tears have been shed to God in secret upon that account?
how many hours have been spent in examination of his own heart about it, and
still jealo^sies and fears hang upon his heart? he doubts what he may prove at
last: Well, ^aith God, let his sincerity then come to the test kindle the fire
and cast in my gold. Trials are the high way to assurance: let my child see
that he loves me more than these, that his heart is upright with me. I will try
him by prosperity and by adversity; by persecutions and temptations; and he
shall see his heart is better than he suspects it to be. This shall be the day
of resolution to his fears and doubts.

The Apostle speaking of Heresies, 1 Cor. ^ ^* 7. 9. puts a necessity upon
them. There ^ust be Heresies (says he) that they which are ap^roved may be
made manifest. The same necessity there is (and for the same end) of all other
trials of grace, that the lovely beautiful ^weet face of sincerity may be
opened some^imes to the world to enamour them, and to ^he soul in whom it is,
to satisfy it that it ^oth not personate a Christian, but lives the ^ery life
of a Christian, and has the very spirit and principles of a Christian in him.

3. Thirdly, By these trials pride and self^onfidence is destroyed and
mortified in the ^aints, as much as by any thing in the world: ^e never see
what poor weak creatures we ^re, till we come to the trial. It Is said, Deuteronomy. ^.
2. God led Israel through the de^art to ^rove them and to humble them: when we
^re proved, then we are humbled. Those that ^ver reckon their graces before the
trial, see ^^ey must come to another account, and take ^ew measures of
themselves after they have ^een upon trial.

Ah! little did I think, says one, that I had ^o much love for the world, and
so little for God, till afflictions tried it, I could not have ^elieved that
ever the creature had got so ^eep into my heart, till providence either
^hreatned or made a separation, and then I ^ound it. I thought I had been rich
in ^^ith, till such a danger be^el^me; or such a want began to pinch hard; and
then I saw how unable I was to trust God for protection, or provision. O it is a
good thing that our hearts be kept humble and lowly, how^rich soever they be in
grace.

4. Fourthly, By trials grace is kept in exercise, and the gracious soul
preserved from security and spiritual slothfulness: trials are to grace what
the estuations and continual agitations of the waters are to the sea: or what
the racking of Wines from the Lees is to it: were it not for our frequent
trials and exercises, we should quickly settle upon the Lees; and our duties
would be (as God complains of Ephraim) like sour or dead drink, Hos. 4. 18.
flat, and spiritless. Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has
settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel; neither
has he gone into Captivity; therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent
is not changed, Jer. 48. 11.

Much after that rate it would be with our hearts, did not the Lord frequently
try and exercise them: let the best man be without some trial or other but a
few months, and you may find the want of it in his prayers and conferences
quickly. O what a tan^ of formality will be found in them! an^ is it for the
honor of God or profit of hi^ people that it should be so? no, no, the Lo^^
knows it is not; but how shall their spiri^^ be reduced to the former zealous
heavenly temper again; why, says the Lord, they must into the Furnace again. I
will melt them and try them, for how shall I do for the daughter of my people!
Jer. 9. 7. I love them too well to lose them for want of a rod: alas! if I
should suffer things to go on at this rate, what will become of them in a
little time? what delight can I take in their duties* when the faith, fervor,
humility, and holy seriousness of their spirits is wanting in them? I will
therefore refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried; and
they shall call upon my name, and I will hear them; and I will say it is my
people; and they shall say the Lord is my God, Zech. 13. 9. and thus the Lord
chides himself friend again with his people.

Thus he recovers them to their true temper, and thus his visi^ations do
preserve their spirits: and when the Lord sees these sweet effects of his
trials upon them, it greatly pleases him. O now says God I like it. This
providence has done them good, this ^od was well bestowed, the letting
loose^of this temptation or that corruption upon them, has made them find
their knees again, ^ow I hear the voice of my child again.

Beloved, this is a blessed fruit and effect of ^ur frequent trials, and how
ungrateful so^ver they are to flesh and blood, that affects ^a^e and is loath to
be disturbed; yet it is necessary to the preservation of our spirits.

5. Fifthly, By the trial of our graces Satan is defeated, and his accusations
of the Saints found to be mere slanders. It is a very common thing with the
devil and wicked men, to accuse the people of God of Hypocrisy, and to tell
the world they are not the men and women they are taken to be; and that if
their inside were but turned out by some through trial, or deep search, it
would appear that Religion did not indeed live in their souls as they pretend;
but that they only act a part, and personate heavenly and mortified persons
upon the public stage of profession.

Thus the Accuser of the brethren suggests the Hypocrisy of Job, Cap* 2. 5.
put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse
thee to thy face. q. d. Well might Job serve thee, whilst thou have been so
bountiful a master to him; he has been well rewarded for all the service he
has done thee; but if thou stop the current of his prosperity, thou shall see
how quickly he will stop the course of his duty: a few lashes from thy hand,
will make him curse thee to thy face: but O what shame and disappointment was
it to that envious spirit, what a vindication of Jobs integrity, when under the
greatest trials of his faith and patience, he still held fast his integrity,
and shows himself as great a pattern of patience under the cross, as he had
been of piety in the days of his greatest prosperity. Satan gets nothing by
bringing forth the saints upon the stage, to be made a spectacle to ange^s and
men, as it is, 1 Cor. 4. 9.

6. Sixthly and Lastly, The frequent trials of grace, exhibit a full and living
Testimony against the Atheism of the world. These prove beyond all words or
arguments that Religion is no fancy, but the greatest reality in the world: men
would make Religion but a fancy, and the zeal of its professors, but the
intemperate heat of some crazy brains, overheated with a fond notion.

They that never felt the real influences of Religion upon their own souls,
will not believe that others do feel them. Serious piety is become the
ludicrous subject with which the wanton Wits of this Athestical world sport
themselves. But behold the wisdom and goodness of God exhibiting to the world
the undeniable testimonies of the truth of Religion, as often as the sincere
professor thereof are brought to the test by afflictions from the hand of God,
or persecutions from the hands of men. Lo here is the faith and patience of
their Saints: here is the courage, meekness, and self-denial shining as gold in
the fire: they have the real proofs of it before their eyes: instead of casting
them into hell, and convincing them by eternal fire, he is pleased to cast his
own people into the fire of affliction, that they who scoff at them may be
convinced at an easier and cheaper rate. It is no new thing to see the enemies
of Religionbrought over to embrace it, by the constancy and faithfulness of the
Saints in their trials and sufferings for it. God grant that the Atheism of
this present generation do not occasion a more fiery trial to the people of God
in it, than they have yet suffered.

CHAP. X.
Showing that grace only is to be reckoned sincere and real, which can endure
those trials which God appoints, or permits for the discovery of it.
SECT. I.
BEfore I offer you the proofs and evidences of this truth, it will be
necessary to prevent some mistakes that may be occasioned by misunderstanding
of it.

Caution 1. And in the first place, we are not to think assurance of our
sincerity impossible to be had in this life, because as long as we live here we
are in a state of trial; and how many trials soever have been made upon us
already, yet still there are more to come; and we know not what we shall prove
in future trials, though God has kept us upright in former trials; no, no*
this is none of my meaning; nor does such a conclusion necessarily follow this
assertion: for a Christian that has rightly closed with Christ at first, and
been faithful in the duties of active and passive obedience hitherto, may be
assured upon good grounds of a victory before he come to the fire of his
remaining trials. So was the Apostle, Romans 8. 35, etc. who shall separate us
from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? nay in all these we are more than
conquerours, through him that has loved us: here is an assured triumph before
the Combat. So Job 23. 10. but he knows the way that I take when he has
tried me, I shall come forth as gold, ^he appeals to God for the sincerity of
his ^eart, so far as he had hith ^to gone in the way of Religion; and thence
concludes that whatever trials God should bring him ^o for time to come, he
should come forth as gold, ( i. e.) he should not lose one grain ^y the fire;
and this confidence of a graci^us soul, is built not only upon experience
gained in former trials, but upon faith in the ^ower* promises, and
faithfulness of God which a^e engaged for him in the Covenant of grace, to keep
him in the greatest dangers that befall him in this world.

He believes the power of God is able to make him stand, though he has no
power ^or might in himself to overcome the least ^emptation, 1 Pet. 1. 5. you
are kept (...), (kept as with a garrison) by the power of God through faith
unto salvation: when Christ has once taken possession of the soul by his
spirit, he fortifies it by his power as a garrison, that using the means, it be
surprised or betrayed no more into the enemies hand, so as finally to be lost.

He builds this confidence also upon the promises of God, which are his
security in all future dangers: and how are all the page^ of the Bible
bespangled with such promises* as the firmament is with bright and gloriou^
stars! such are these of the first magnitude* 1 Cor. 1. 8, 9. Christ shall^
confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of ou^ Lord Jesus
Christ; God is faithful by who^ ye are are called into the fellowship of his
So^ Jesus Christ our Lord: and no less satisfying and sweet is that, Jer. 32.
40. And I will mak^ an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turn
away from them to do them good; (...) I will put my fear in their hearts, that
th^^ shall not depart from me: and of the same n^^ture is that also, John 10.
27, 28. My shee^hear my voice, and I know them and they follo^ me: and I give
unto them eternal life; and th^^ shall never perish; neither shall any man plu^
them out of my hand.

If there be any Hypocrite in sheeps-cloathin^ he has no part nor lot in this
promise; (...) it secures the whole flock of Christ, great (...) small, against
all danger.

He also builds his assurance upon the faithfulness of God, which stands
engaged to make good every line, word and syllable of his promises to his
people: so we find it in 1 Cor. 10. 13. There has no temptation taken you but
such as is common to man; but God is faithful; who will not suffer you to be
tempted above that ye are able; but will with every temptation make a way to
escape, that ye may be able to bear it: and 2 These. 3. 3. but the Lord is
faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.

Add to this the constant prevalent intercession of Christ in Heaven for his
people in all their trials, and then you will see a sincere Christian need not
to deny himself the joy and comfort of his assurance upon the account and
supposition of his future trials.

SECT. II.
Caution 2. NOr do we here suppose in this assertion, that inherent grace ^n
the saints has a sufficiency of ability in ^t self to endure the greatest and
severest trials that can befall it in this world. It is cer^ain that it shall be
carried safely through all, but not in its own strength and ability.

That is a true observation of the learned Gerson: perfectiones sibi relictae,
sunt pondera ad ^uinam: the most perfect creature left to it ^elf will fall
into ruin. This was exemplified in the Angels that fell, and in Adam, thoug^
in a perfect state-: divine preservation is the prop which supports the best
creatures from ruin. Grace it self is but a creature, an^ therefore a
dependent being: it is but (...) stream depends upon the supply of the
foun^tain; if the fountain let not forth it self, wha^ becomes of the stream?
That Is a true an^ judicious observation of the learned Dr. A^mes; Perseverantia
fidelium, vel immutabilis eo^rum conditio secundum integram ejus rationem^ non
provenit a principio intrinseco solo, nec a sol^ extrinseco; sed patrim ab
intrinseco, ex nature vitae spiritualis a Christo fluentis: and patrim (...)
extrinseco, ex custodi^, protectione, and direction^^ Dei: Amesii Coronis Art.
5. The perse^verance of believers, or the immutability (...) their condition,
if we view the whole groun^ and reason of it, is not wholly from within^ nor
wholly from without it self: but partl^ from the nature of the spiritual life
which flows from Christ into them; and partl^ from the keeping, protection and
direction of God. That protection is always afforde^ to this life* of grace,
and this life of grace a^^ways needs that protection. The best of me^ are but
men at best, as one speaks: it wa^ not Peter's grace and resolution that kep^
him, but Christ's care of him and interces^sion for him, Luke 22. 32. Be strong
in the Lord, (says the Apostle) and in the power (...) ^is might, Ephesians. 6.
10. Without me (says Christ) ^ou can do nothing, John 15. 5.

Neither of these is that which I have before me to prove, but this is that
which I ^im at; That such seeming grace as was ^ever yet brought to the trial,
nor will be able to bear the trial when God shall bring (...) thereto; must not
pass for current (as too ^requently it does) among us; such grace will neither
comfort us now, nor save us ^ereafter: for,

SECT. III.
^. FIrst, Great numbers of persons in the professing world are deceived and
destroyed by trusting to seeming and untri^d grace. This was the miserable
condition of these Laodicean professors in the Text: they ^eckoned themselves
rich, but were really ^oor, all is notgold that glisters: their gold (as ^hey
accounted it) was never tried in the ^ire: if a man's whole estate lay in some
precious stone, suppose a rich Diamond, how is ^e concerned to have it
thoroughly tried? ^o see whether it will bear a smart stroke with the hammer, or
fly like a Bristol Diamond under it? All that you are worth lies ^n the truth
and sincerity of your grace: and till that be tried you know not whether you be
worth any thing or nothing.

Reader, There are two sad sights in the world, which cannot but deeply affect
every upright heart: one is to see so many thousands of rational and ingenious
men in the Romish Church by an implicit faith in their guides, venturing their
souls upon their bare word, never searching the Scriptures with their own eyes,
but wholly trusting to the infallibility of the Pope, or a Council, when in the
mean time, they would fear to take their word for a sum of money without some
farther security. It is amazing to behold the soul-destroying, easy credulity
of these men: but this is a stroke of madnes^ and spiritual infatuation
judicially inflicted upon them; that the judgment which i^ written might be
fulfilled in them, God shall send them strong delusions that they should
believ^ a lie, 2 These. 2. 11.

And yet more amazing is that stroke of God upon multitudes of vain and formal
professors even in the Reformed Protestant Churches; where no man is
restrained from searching the Scriptures; nay, where men are so frequently and
earnestly presse^ from Sabbath to Sabbath to examine them selves, and prove
their own work, that yet (...) many are content to leave all at hazard (...)
and without any more ado or farther search in the matter, credit the report of
their ow^ deceitful hearts, and take all for granted without due trial or
examination of the matter

Surely, no one thing sends down more ^ouls daily to hell out of the professing
world, ^han this does. The five foolish Virgins ( i. e. ^he unprincipled
Professors in the Refor^ed Churches) perished this way. They took (...) for
granted all was well, because they had ^amps of profession as well as others;
and saw ^ot the cheat, till the cry was heard at mid^ight, and their
unfurnished Lamps went ^ut, Matthew. 25.

2. Secondly, The promises of salvation are ^ade over to tried grace, and such
only as ^ill endure the trial: So James 1. 12. Blessed (...) the man that
endures temptation: for when (...) is tried he shall receive the Crown of life
which God has promised to them that love him: (...) must be first tried, and
then crowned. (...) a man strive for masteries, yet is he not Crown^d, except
he strive lawfully, 2 Timothy 2. 5. he ^anifestly alludes to the Roman Games to
which there were Judges appointed, to see that no foul play were offered
contrary to (...) Law for wrestling: and where it was ^^und, the Crown was
denied them. Not to ^im that sets forth in the morning with re^lution and
gallantry, but to him that holds (...) till the evening of his life, is the
pro^ise made, Matthew. 10. 22. He that endures (...) the end shall be saved: so
Romans 2. 7. To ^em who by patient continuance in well doing (...) for glory and
honor, and immortality; eternal life: and once more, Heb. 3. 15. We are made
partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence, steadfast unto
the end. So that if you should endure some few slighter troubles, and faint at
last; give out when a closer trial befalls you; all your labors and sufferings
are in vain. Sincerity and final perseverance are the conditions of all special
promises.

3. Thirdly, Every man's graces and duties must be tried and weighed by God in
the great day; and if they cannot endure these lesser trials, to which God
exposed them now, how will they endure that severe and exact trial to which he
will bring them then? No man can search his own heart with that exactness in
this world, as God will search i^ in the world to come.

I may say in this case to you as the Lord spoke to Jeremiah, cl. ap. 12. 5. If
thou have run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee; then how can thou
contend with horses? and if in the land of peace wherein thou trustedst, they
have wearited thee; then how wilt tho^ do in the swelling of Jordan? This was
spoken to encourage the Prophet to constancy in his work; and as if the Lord
had said, O Jeremy, do the strivings of the men of Anat hoth thine own Town,
dishearten thee? pluck up thy spirits and faint not; there are harder Trials
than these that thou must undergo at Jerusalem: these are no more to what is
coming, than the running with footmen, is to contending with horses: or the
passing a small Rivulet, to the swellings of Jordan.

To allude to this, If our graces and duties cannot bear these lighter trials,
if a little lift of prosperity, or lighter stroke of adversity discover so much
falseness, rottenness, pride, and selfishness in the heart: If we cannot resist
the motions of corruptions, but yield our selves to obey sin in the lusts of
it: If we can neither keep our hearts with God in duties, nor mourn for our
wanderings from him: If a few scoffs from wicked tongues, or trials of
persecution from the hands of men will cause us to faint in the way, and turn
back from following the Lord; what shall we do when he comes whose fan is in
his hand, and who will thoroughly purge his floor, Mat. 3. 12. who will try
every man's work as by fire, 1 Cor. 3. 13. search the secrets of all hearts,
Romans 2. 16. weigh every man to his ounces and drachms? Surely we can take
little comfort in that which is so unable to bear the severe trials of that
day, that it cannot stand before the slighter Trials of this day.

4. Fourthly, True grace is willing to be tried, and nothing is more desirable
to an upright soul than to know his own condition. If therefore we shun the
trial, and are loath to search our selves, or be searched by the Lord, our
condition is suspicious, and we can take little comfort in it. It was David's
earnest desire, Psalm. 139. 23. that God would thoroughly search his heart and
reins, and see if there were any way of wickedness in him: false grace is shy
of Gods eye; it cares not to be examined; but this is the delight of sincere
ones: every one that does evil hates the light, lest his deeds should be
reproved; but he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be
made manifest, that they are wrought in God, John 3. 20, 21.

The reason is plain why Hypocrisy cannot endure to come to the. Touchstone
and test, for Hypocrites ^aving a secret consciousness of their own guilt and
unsoundness, know that by this means their vain confidence would quickly be
confuted, and all their reputation for Religion blasted: but O if men dare not
stand before the word, as it is now opened and applied by Ministers; how will
they stand when it shall be opened and applied in another manner by Jesus
Christ?

O professor, if thy condition be good, thy heart right, thou will desire to
know the very worst of thy self; and when thou have made the deepest search
thou can, thou will still fear thou have not been severe enough, and impa^^^^
enough to thy self: nothing will give thee more content than when thou feel
the word dividing thy soul and spirit, thy joints and marrow: nothing so much
comforts thee under, or after an affliction, as the discovery it has made of
thy heart, thou will seem to feel with what affections those words came from
the Prophets lips, Jer. 12. 3. But thou O Lord know me, thou have seen me,
and tried my heart toward thee. O what a freshing sweetness will stream
through thy heart; and all the powers of thy soul, when thou can make the
like appeal to God with like sincerity! And certainly without such a
disposition of spirit toward the trial of our graces, we can have little
evidence of the truth of them.

CHAP. XI.
Containing diverse practical instructive Inferences from this doctrine, with a
serious exhortation to self-tryal, and through examination.
SECT. I.
Infer. 1. ARe there such variety of trials appointed to examine the sincerity
of men's graces, how great a vanity then is Hypocrisy, and to how little
purpose do men endea^our to conceal and hide it! We say, murder, will out, and
we may as confidently affirm hypocrisy will out. When Rebekah had laid the
plot to disguise her son Jacob, and by personating his brother to get the
blessing; Jacob thus objects against it, My Father perad venture will feel me,
and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and
not a blessing, Genesis 27. 12. as if he should say; but what if my Father detect
the cheat, how then shall I look him in the face? how shall I escape a curse?
After the same manner every upright soul scares it self from the way of
Hypocrisy. If I dissemble, and pretend to be what I am not: my Father will
find me out. Ah there is no darkness nor shadow of death that can conceal the
the Hypocrite: but out it will come at last, let him use all the art he can to
hide it* Oftentimes God discovers him by the trials he appoints in this world,
and men in that day shall return and discern betwixt the righteous and the
wicked; between him that serves God, and him that serves him not, Mal 3. 18.
but if he make an hard shift to get by a private way to hell, carrying this
comfort with him to the last step; that no body know^ or thinks he is gone
thither; yet there will be a day when God will strip him naked before the great
assembly of Angels and men, and all shall point at him and say,

Lo this is the man that made not God his hope this is he that wore a garment
of profession to deceive, but God has now stripped him out of it, and all men
see what he is: for, there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and
hid that shall not be known: Matthew. 10. 26. and the Apostle assures us, 1. Tim.
5. 24, 25. that they that are otherwise cannot be hid: if men's works be not
good, it is impossible they should be hid long: a gilded piece of brass may pass
from hand to hand a little while; but the touchstone will discover the base
metal: if that do not, the fire will.

O sinners, away with your Hypocrisy, be honest, sincere, plain, and hearty in
Religion; if not, confusion of face shall be your recompense from the Lord,
that is what you shall get by it.

Infer. 2. Secondly, Are there such trials appointed and permitted by the Lord
for the discovery of his peoples sincerity in this world, then let none of Gods
people expect a quiet station in this world: certainly you shall meet with no
rest here: you must out of one fire into another, and it is a merciful
condescension of the Lord to poor creatures, thus to concern himself for their
safety and benefit: what is man that thou should magnify him? and that thou
should set thine heart upon him? that thou should visit him every morning,
and try him every moment? Job 7. 17, 18.

O it is a great deal of honor put upon a poor worm, when God will every moment
try him and visit him: it argues the great esteem the Goldsmith has of his
gold, when he will sit by the Furnace himself, and order the fire with his own
hand: when he pries so often, and so curiously into the fining pot, to see that
none of his precious metal upon which he sets his heart be lost.

Think it not then a debasing to you to be so often exposed to trials: if God
did not value you highly, he would not try you so frequently: what would become
of you* if your condition here should be more settled and quiet than now it is?
I believe you find dross enough in your hearts after all the fires into which
God has cast you: surely there is filth enough in the best of Gods people to
take all this: it may be a great deal more trouble than they have yet met with*
we fancy it a brave life to live at ease, and if we meet with long respites and
intervals of trial than usual, we are apt to say, we shall never be moved, as
David did, Psalm. 30. 6. or we shall dye in our nest as it is, Job 29. 18. our
hard and difficult days are over, but woe to us if God should give us the
desire of our hearts in this: see what the temper of those men's spirits is,
that meet with no changes, Psalm. 55. 19. Because they have no changes,
therefore they have not God: O it is better to be preserved sweet in brine, than
to (...) in honey.

Infer. 3. Thirdly, Let none boast in a carna confidence of their own strength
and stability; you are yet in a state of trial: hitherto God has kept you
upright in all your trials, bless God but boast not: you are but feathers in
the wind of temptation, if God leave you to your selves. Peter told Christ (and
doubtless he spoke no more than he honestly meant) though all men forsake thee
yet will not I: and you know what he did when the hour of his trial came:
Matthew. 26. 35. Angels left to themselves have fallen: it is better be a humble
worm, than a proud Angel.

Ah how many Pendletons will this professing age show, if once God bring us to
the fiery trial? let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall: you have
not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin: none stand upon firmer
ground, than those that see nothing in themselves to stand upon: he that leans
upon his own arm, usually benums it, and makes it useless.

Infer. 4. Fourthly, Does God kindle so many fires in Sion, and set his
Furnaces in Jerusalem to discover and separate the dross from the gold, how
contrary are those men to God that allow, yea and prize the dross of Hypocrisy
which God hates, and stick not to make the holy God a patronizer and
countenancer of it in the hearts and lives of men!

It is amazing to read what Popish pens have impudently written about this
matter Sylvester puts the question, A sum. adv. simulatio. n. 4.
whether it be a sin to make a false show of sanctity? and answers it thus: If
it be for the honor of God, and profit of others, it is no sin: nay, they have
a reverence for hypocrisy as an holy Art. Vincentius spends a whole Chapter in
commedation of the hypocrisy of St. Dominick; and entitles it, de sancta ejus
hypocrisi, (i. e.) of the holy hypocrisy of that Saint: reckoning it among his
commendations, that he had the art of dissembling. And yet one peg higher, A
Religious person (says another) that feigns himself Rosellain v. Hypocrisis.
n. 1.
to have more holiness than he has, that others may be edified, sins not but
rather merits.

Blush O heavens! that ever such factors for hell should open and vend such
ware as this in the public market, and invite the world to Hypocrisy, as that
which makes for the glory of God, the edification of men, and a work
meritorious in the Hypocrite himself. This is the doctrine of devils indeed.

Infer. 5. Fifthly, If it be so, that all grace must come to the test, and be
tried as gold in the fire, even in this world: how are all men concerned to lay
a solid foundation at first, and thoroughly deliberate the terms upon which they
close with Christ, and engage in the profession of his name! Which of you says
Christ intending to build a Tower sits not down first, and counts the
cost? Luke 14. 28. if some men had sat down at first and pondered the
conditions and terms of Christ, they had not sat down now discouraged and
tried in the way. The Apostle Paul went to work at another rate: he accounted
all but dung and dross for Christ, Phil. 3. 8. and was of the same mind, when
the actual trial came; for then he tells us, he counted not his life dear unto
him, Acts 20. 24. And the Apostle Peter admonishes believers not to think it
strange concerning the fiery trial which was to try them, 1 Pet. 4. 21. q. d.
let none of these things be surprisals to you, you were told beforehand what
you must trust to: every Christian must be a Martyr, at least in the
disposition and resolution of his heart.

O that men would balance the advantages and disadvantages of Religion, and
thoroughly ponder the matter in their deepest thoughts: to the test you must
come: the rain will fall, and the storm beat upon your buildings, look
carefully therefore to the foundations.

Infer. 6. Sixthly and Lastly, Learn from this point the unavoidableness of
scandals and offenses in the way of Religion; for if there be a necessity of
trial, there is also a necessity of scandal. It must needs be that offenses
come, Luke 17. 1. Why must it needs be? the reason is evident, all must come to
the trial, and all are not able to bear it. Our Lord tells us, Matthew. 24. 8, 9,
10. of a day of great straits and perplexity coming: and then (says he) shall
many be offended. The day of trial is the day of scandal: by these offenses
some are put a searching themselves, and some fall a censuring all others; but
the holy God brings about his end both ways, in them that are saved and in
them that, perish.

SECT. II.
WEll then, if it be so that all must into the furnace, let every man try his
own work, Examine your selves, professors, search your hearts, commune with
your reins: nothing more concerns you in all the world than this does. O that
you would be more in your closets, and oftener upon your knees: O that you would
look into the Bible, then into your hearts; and then to God, saying with David,
search me O God and know my heart; prove me, and try my reins; and see if there
be any way of iniquity in me: never did Religion thrive in the world since men's
heads have been so overheated with Notions and Controversies, and their hearts
so sensibly cooled in their closet work. I have elsewhere more largely pressed
this duty upon the professors of this generation, See my Saint indeed, p. 191,
192, 193, etc.
and thither shall refer the Reader for the present to see the necessity and
importance of this work.

Here I shall only urge the duty of selftryal by some pressing Motives, and
awakening Considerations.

Motive 1. And the first shall be the exceeding difficulty of this work:
difficulty in some cases may be a discouragement, but where the matter is of
absolute necessity as it is here; nothing provokes more to diligence; strive
(says our Lord) to enter in at the strait gate, for many will seek to enter in
and shall not be able, Luke 13. 24. A double difficulty is found attending this
work of self-tryal. Difficulty in bringing the heart to it, and difficulty in
the right and successful management of it: who find it not hard to persuade his
heart to such work as this? nature declines it, flesh and blood relish it not:
it is one of the great severities in Religion: it is no easy thing to bring a
man and his own heart together.

It is in this case as in the study of Geography, we are more inquisitive to
know, and delighted when we discover the rarities of foreign Countries, and
strange things in ^he remote parts of the world; than those of our own native
Country. I fear there be many professors of Religion that can spend day after
day in hearing, and love to be disputing fruitless controversies, that never
spent one day in searching what influence all those Sermons they have heard,
have had upon their hearts, or in rightly stating and determining that great
Controversy, in whose right and possession their souls are, and which way they
shall go as soon as death has divided them from those mortal bodies; yea, I
doubt many sinful hours are spent in praying into, reporting and censuring the
failings of others, and not one hour faithfully employed in judging their own
hearts before the Lord: O men had rather be about any other work than this:
there is no pleasure in it to the flesh.

And yet how difficult soever it be to bring our hearts to the work, it is
certainly much more difficult to manage it successfully, and bring the great
question of our sincerity to a clear result and issue. O how many upright
hearts have sat close to this work many a year, and lifted up many a cry to
heaven, and shed many a secret and undissembled tear about it; and yet still
are in the dark, and their minds greatly perplexed, and filled with fear about
it: what would they not do, what would they not suffer? what pleasant enjoyment
would they not gladly part with to arrive at the desire of their souls, the
full assurance of their sincerity! It was the saying of a pious woman, I have
born (said she) seven Children, and they have cost me as dear as ever Children
did cost a Mother; yet would I be content to endure all that sorrow over again,
to be assured of the love of God to my soul.

Motive 2. Secondly, And as the work is full of difficulty, so the discovery of
your sincerity will be full of sweetness, and joy unspeakable: it will never
repent you that you have prayed and mourned, that you have trembled and feared,
that you have searched and tried: nay, it will never repent you that God has
tried you by thousands of sharp afflictions and deep sufferings; if after all,
your sincerity may be fully clea^ed up to the satisfaction of your souls; for
in the same day your sincerity shall be cleared, your title to Christ will be
made as clear to your souls as your sincerity is: you may then go to the
promises boldly, and take your own Christ into the arms of your faith, and say,
my beloved is mine, and I am his: yea, you may be confident it shall be well
with you in the Judgment of the great day, for God will not cast away the
upright man, Job 8. 20. if the word clear you now, it cannot condemn you then.

O what an ease is it to the soul when the ^ears and doubts that hanged about
it are gone! when a man sees what he is, and what he has in Christ and the
promises; and what he has to do; even to spend the time betwixt this and
Heaven in admiring the grace of God that has delivered him from the ruining
mistakes and miscarriages by which so great a part of the professing world
perish to all eternity.

Motive 3. Thirdly, The deep concernment of your souls in the matter to be
tried, should awaken you to the utmost diligence about it. The trials of men
for their life, at humane bars, is but a trifle to this: it is your eternal
happiness that stands or falls with your sincerity.

It Is said in the trial of opinions, that if a man superstruct hay or stubble
upon the foundation, he shall suffer loss, yet he himself may be saved, 1 Cor.
3. 12. but if Hypocrisy be in the foundation, there is no such relief, there
is no possibility of salvation in that case.

Ah Reader, thou must be cast for ever according to the integrity or hypocrisy
of thy heart with God. Summon in then all the powers of thy soul, bring thy
thoughts as close as it is possible to bring them to this matter: if there be
any subject of consideration able to drink up the spirits of a man, here it is:
never was time put to an higher improvement, never were thoughts spent upon a
more important business than this is: happy is the man that rescues the years,
months, days, yea, the very moments of his life from other employments, to
consecrate them unto this solemn, awful, and most important business.

Motive 4. Fourthly, How evidential will it be of your sincerity, when you are
willing to come to the trial of your own hearts!

Suppose your doubts and fears should in some degree remain with you, yet in
this you may take some comfort, that if Hypocrisy be in your heart, it is not
there by consent: you are not loath to rich and come to the trial, because like
Rachel you sit upon your Idols: certainly it is a good sign thy heart is right,
when it is filled with so much fear lest it should be false: you know all the
disciples said, Master, Is it I: before Judas who was the Traitor spoke a word.
Last of all (says the text) Judas said is it I? our willingness to be tried,
is a good sign that the desire of our souls is to be right with God.

Motive 5. Fifthly, Conclude it to be your great advantage to be thoroughly
tried, whatever you befound to be in the trial: if you be found sincere, you
are richly rewarded for all your pains and labor: never did that man repent of
digging and toyling, that after all hit upon the rich vein that he dug for:
what is a vein of gold to a vein of sincerity!

If upon search you find the contrary, a false Hypocritical unsound heart, yet
in that very sad discovery you meet with the greatest advantage that ever you
had in your lives for salvation. This discovery is your great advantage: for
now your vain confidence being over-turned, and your ungrounded hopes
destroyed; you lie open to the stroke of a deep and effectual conviction o^
your sin and misery, which is the introductive mercy to all other mercies to
your souls^ and surely till you come to that, to give up your false hopes, and
quit your vain pretensions: there is no hope of you. Christ told the Pharisees,
Matthew 21. 31. Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before
you: Publicans were the worst sort of men, and harlots the worst sort of women,
and yet they stood in a fairer way for heaven than the Hypocritical Pharisees,
because conviction had easier access to their consciences: they had not those
defenses and pleas^ of duty and strictness to ward off the word, that the
self-couzening Pharisees had.

I may say of your vain and groundless hopes, as Christ in another sense said
to the officers that came to seize him in the garden^ if you seek me, let these
go their way. So 'ti^ here, if you expect Christ and salvation by him; let your
vain confidences go their way: away with your masks and vizards* ^f ever you
expect to see Christ. O it is your ^appiness to have all these things stripped
off, and your nakedness and poverty discovered, that you may be rich as the
Text speaks.

Motive 6. Sixthly, Consider how near the ^^ay of Death and Judgment approach
you. Oh these are searching days wherein you cannot be hid: will your
consciences, think you, be put off in a dying day as easily as ^hey are now?
no, no; you know they ^ill not.

I have heard of a good man that consumed ^ot only the greatest part of the
day, but ^ very considerable part of the night also in ^rayer to the great
weakening of his body; and being asked by a relation why he did ^o, and prayed
to favor himself, he returned ^his answer, O I must dye, I must dye: plainly
^ntimating, that so great is the concernment of dying in a clear assured
condition, that ^t's richly worth the expense of all our time and strength to
secure it.

You know also that after death the Judgment, Heb. 9. 27. you are hastening to
the judgment of the great and terrible God. Death will put you into his
balance to be weighed exactly: and what gives the soul a ^ouder call to search
it self with all diligence, whilst it stands at the door of eternity, and ^ts
turn is not yet come to go before that awful Tribunal? O that these
considerations might have place upon our hearts!

CHAP. XII.
Containing diverse helps for the clearing of Sinc^^rity and discovery of
Hypocrisy.
SECT. I.
YOu see of what importance the dut^ of self-examination is, how many thing put
a necessity and a solemnity upon tha^ work. Now in the close of all, I would
o^^fer you some helps for the due managemen^ thereof, that is as far as I can
carry it, the Lord persuade your hearts to the diligen^ and faithful
application and use of the^ The general rules to clear sincerity (...) these
that follow.

Rule 1.
We may not presently conclude we are in (...) state of Hypocrisy, because we
find some working of it, and tendencies to it in our spirits: the be^ gold has
some dross and alloy in it. Hyp^^crisie is a weed naturally springing in (...)
ground, the best heart is not perfectly cle^^ free of it: it may be we are
stumbled when we feel some workings or grudgings of the disease in our selves,
and looking into su^^ Scriptures as these, Joh. 1. 47. Behold an (...) raelite
indeed, in whom there is no guile: and Psalm. 32. 1. Blessed is the man unto
whom the Lord imputes not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.

This I say may stumble some upright soul, not understanding in what an allayed
and qualified sense those Scriptures are to be understood: for by a Spirit
without guile, is ^ot understood a person absolutely free from all
deceitfulness, and falseness of heart; this was the sole prerogative of the
Lord Jesus, who was separated from sinners, in whose mouth was no guile found:
in whom the Prince of this world in all his trials and at^empts upon him found
nothing: but we ^ust understand it of reigning and allowed Hypocrisy: there is
no such guile in any ^f the Saints: distinguish the presence from ^he
predominance of hypocrisy, and the ^oubt is resolved.

Rule 2.
Every true ground of humiliation for sin, is ^ot a sufficient ground for
doubting and questio^ing our estate and condition.

There be many more things to humble us upon the account of our infirmity, than
there (...) to stumble us upon the account of our ^^tegrity: i^ is the sin and
affliction of some ^ood souls to call their condition in question, upon every
slip and failing in the course of their obedience. This is the way to debar our
selves from all the peace and comfort of the Christian life: we find that
Joseph was once minded to put away Mary his Espoused Wife, not knowing that the
holy thing which was conceived in her was by the Holy Ghost. It is the sin of
Hypocrites to take brass for gold, and the folly of Saints to call their gold,
brass: be as severe to your selves as you will, always provided you be just:
there is that makes himself rich, and yet has nothing; and there is that
makes himself poor, and yet has great riches, Prove. 13. 7. Hiram called the
Cities Solomon gave him Cabul dirty, for they pleased him not, 1 Kings 9. 13.
it is but an ill requital, an ungrateful return to God, for the best of mercies,
to undervalue them in our hearts, and be ready upon all occasions to put them
away as worth nothing.

Rule 3.
A stronger propension in our Nature, and more frequent incidence in our
practice to one sin than another; does not presently infer our hypocrisy, and
the unsoundness of our hearts in Religion. It Is true, every Hypocrite has some
way of wickedness: Some peccatum in deliciis, iniquity that he delights in, and
rolls as a sweet morsel under his tongue; some lust that he is not willing to
part with, nor can endure that the knife of mortification should touch it, and
this undoubtedly argues the insincerity and rottenness of his heart: and it is
true also, that the nature and constitution of the most sanctified man inclines
him rather to one sin than to another, though he allow himself in none; yea,
though he set himself more watchfully against that sin than another, yet he may
still have more trouble and vexation, more temptation and defilement from it
than any other.

As every man has his proper gift one after this manner and another after
that, as the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 7. 7. so every man has his proper sin
also, one after this manner, and another after that: for it is with original
sin, as it is with the juice or sap of the earth, which though it be the common
matter of all kinds of fruits, yet it is specificated according to the
different sorts of plants and seeds it nourishes: in one it becomes an apple,
in another a Cherry, etc. Just so it is in Original Corruption, which is turned
into this or that temptation and sin, according to this or that constitution or
employment it finds us in: one it is Passion, in another Lust, in a third
Covetousness, in a fourth Levity, and so on. Now I say the frequent assaults of
this sin, provided we indulge it not, but by setting double guards labor to
keep our selves from our own iniquity, as David did, Psalm. 18. 23. will not
infer the hypocrisy of our hearts.

Rule 4.
A greater backwardness and indisposedness to one duty rather than another,
does not conclude the heart to be unsound and false with God, provided we do
not inwardly dislike and disapprove any duty of Religion, or except against it
in our agreement with Christ, but that it rises merely from the present
weakness and distemper we labor under.

There be some duties in Religion, as sufferings for Christ, bearing sharp
reproofs for sin, etc. that even an upright heart, under a present distemper
may find a great deal of backwardness and lothness to; yet still he consents to
the Law that it is good, is troubled that he cannot comply more cheerfully with
his duty: and desires to stand complete in all the will of God: perfection is
his aim, and imperfections are his sorrows.

Some Christians have much ado to bring their hearts to fixed solemn
meditation, their hearts fly off from it, but this is their burden that it
should be so with them. Truth is, it is a very dangerous sign of Hypocrisy
when a man's zeal runs out in one chanel of o^bedience only, and he has not a
respect to all Gods Commandments, as Physicians observe, the sweating of one
part of the body when all the rest are cold is symptomatical, and argues an ill
habit: but whilst the soul heartily approves all the will of God, and
sincerely desires to come up to it, and mourns for its backwardness and
deadness to this or that duty, and this is not fixed, but occasional under some
present indisposition out of which the soul rises by the same degrees, as
sanctification rises in him, and the Lord comes in with renewed strength upon
him; this I say may consist and is very ordinarily found to be the case of
up^ight-hear^ed ones.

Rule 5.
The glances of the eye at self ends in duties, whilst self is not the weight
that moves the wheels, the principal end and design we drive at, and whilst
those glances are corrected and mourned for; do not conclude the heart to be
unsound and Hypocritical in Religion: for even among the most deeply
sanctified, few can keep their eye so steady and fixed with pure and unmixed
respects to the glory of God, but that there will be (alas too frequently some
by^ends insinuating and creeping into the heart.

These like the fowls seize upon the sacrifice, let the soul take what pains it
can to ^ray them away. It Is well that our High Priest bears the iniquities of
our holy things for us: Peter had too much regard to the pleasing of men, and
did not walk with that upright foot toward the Gentile Christians and the
believing Jews in the matter of liberty as became him, Gal. 2. 13, 14 for
which, as Paul says, he ought to be blamed* and did blame him; but yet such a
failing as that in the end of his duty did not condemn him. In public
performances there may be too ^uch vanity, in works of charity too much
ostentation, these are all workings of Hypocrisy in us, and matters of
humiliation to us, but whilst they are disallowed corrected and mourned over,
are consistent with integrity.

Rule 6.
The doubts and fears that hang upon and perplex our spirits about the
hypocrisy of our hearts, do not conclude that therefore we are what we fear
our selves to be. God will not condemn every one for an hypocrite that
suspects, yea, or charges himself with Hypocrisy Holy David thought his heart
was not right with God, after that great slip of his in the matter of Uriah,
and therefore begs of God to renew a right spirit in him, Psalm. 51. 10, 11, 12.
his integrity was indeed wounded and he thought destroyed by that fall.

Holy Master Bradford so vehemently doubted the sincerity of his heart, that he
subscribed some of his Letters (as Master Fox tells us) John Bradford the
Hypocrite, a very painted Sepulcher: and yet in so saying he utterly misjudged
the state and temper of his own soul.

SECT. II.
WEll then, let not the upright be unjust to themselves in censuring their own
hearts: they are bad enough, but let us not make them worse than they are, but
thankfully own and acknowledge the least degrees of grace and integrity in
them: and possibly our uprightness might be sooner discove^ed to us, if in a
due composure of spirit, we would sit down and attend the true answers of our
own hearts to such questions as these are.

Question 1.
Do I make the approbation of God or the applause of men the very end and main
design of my Religious performances; according to 1 These. 2. 4 Col. 3. 23. Will
the acceptance of my duties with men satisfy me, whether God accept my duties
and person or not?

Quest. 2.
Is it the reproach and shame that attends sin at present, and the danger and
misery that will follow it hereafter, that restrains me from the Commission of
it? or is it the fear of God in my soul, and the hatred I bear to sin as it is
sin? according to Psalm. 19, 12. and Psalm. 119. 113.

Quest. 3.
Can I truly and heartily rejoice to see Gods work carried on in the world, and
his glory promoted by other hands, though I have no share in the credit and
honor of it, as Paul did? Philip. 1. 18.

Quest. 4.
Is there no duty in Religion so full of difficulty and self^denyal, but I
desire to comply with it: and is all the holy and good will of God acceptable
to my soul, though I cannot rise up with like readiness to the performance of
all duties? according to that pattern, Psalm. 119. 6.

Quest. 5.
Am I sincerely resolved to Follow Christ and holiness at all seasons, however
the aspects of the times may be upon Religion? or do I bear my self so warily,
and covertly as to shun all hazards for Religion: having a secret reserve in my
heart, to launch out no farther than I may return with safety; contrary to the
practice and re^olution of upright souls? Psalm. 116* 3. Psalm. 44. 18, 19. Rev.
22. 11.

Quest. 6.
Do I make no Conscience of committing secret sins, or neglecting secret
duties? or am I conscientious both in the one and other according to the rules
and patterns of integrity? Matthew. 6. 5, 6. Psalm. 19. 12.

A few such Questions solemnly propounded to our own hearts, in a calm and
serious hour, would sound them and discover much of their sincerity toward the
Lord.

SECT. III.
ANd as upright hearts are too apt to apply to themselves the threats and
miseries of Hypocrites, so Hypocrites on the contrary, are as apt to catch hold
of the promises and privileges pertaining to believers.

To detect therefore the soul damning mistakes of such deceived souls, O that
these following Rules might be studied and faithfully applied to their
conviction, and recovery!

Rule 1.
It is not enough to clear a man from Hypocrisy, that he knows not himself to
be an Hypocrite. All Hypocrites are not designing hypocrites; they deceive
themselves, as well as others: many will say to me in that day, Lord, have we
not Prophesied in thy name? etc. Matthew. 7. 22. Hell will be a mere surprisal to
multitudes of Professors: a man may live and dye in a blind ungrounded
confidence of his safe condition, and not fear his ruin, till he begin to feel
it.

Rule 2.
Zeal and forwardness in the cause of God, and for the reformation of his
worship, will not clear a man from the danger of Hypocrisy. Iehu was a zealous
reformer, and yet but a painted Sepulcher. In the year 1549. Reformation grew
so much in reputation even among the Nobles and Gentry of Germany, that many of
them caused these five letters V. D. M. I. AE. being the initial letters of
these words, v^rbum domini manet in aeternum, (i. e.) the word of the Lord
abides for ever; to be wrought or embroidered, or set in plates, some upon
their Cloaks, and others upon the sleeves of their Garments; to show to all the
world, (^aith my Author) that forsaking all Popish Traditions they would now
cleave John Wolf, lect. memor. To. 2. ad An. 1 549.
to the pure doctrine and discipline of the eternal word.

And no doubt they would have been as good as their word, if what was
embroidered on their cloaks, had been engraven on their hearts; but come see my
zeal, marrs all.

Rule 3.
It is no sufficient evidence of a man's own integrity, that he hates hypocrisy
in another: for as one proud man may hate another, and he that is Covetous
himself, will be apt to censure another for being so; (Lusts may be contrary to
one another, as well as all of them contrary to grace) so may an hypocrite
loath that in another, which yet he allows in himself: nay it is the policy of
some to declaim against the Hypocrisy of others, thereby to hide their own.
Hypocrites are none of the most modest censurers of others, Psalm. 35. 16. A
salt j^st seasoned their meat.

Rule 4.
The mere performance of private duties, will not clear a man from Hypocrisy;
the influence of education, or support of reputation, or the impulse of a
convinced Conscience may induce a man to it; and yet all this while his heart
may not be carried thither with hungry and thirsty desires after God: it is not
the matter of any duty that distinguishes the sound, and unsound professor;
but the motives, designs, and ends of the soul in them.

Rule 5.
The vogue and opinion you have got among Christians, of your sincerity, will
not be sufficient to clear you from the danger of Hypocrisy. Christ tells the
Angel of Sardis, Rev. 3. 1. Thou have a name that thou live, and art dead.
The fall of Hymeneus and Philetus, could never have shaken the faith of the
Saints as it did, had they not had great credit in the Church, and been men of
renown for piety among them.

Rule 6.
Your respects and love to them that are the sincere and upright servants of
God, will not clear you from the danger of being Hypocrites your selves: for
the bare loving of a Christian is not Characteristical and evidential of a man's
own Christianity, except he love him, qua talis, as he is a Christian, or as he
belongs to Christ: and so his sincerity becomes the attractive of thy
affection. There be a thousand by considerations and respects that may kindle a
man's love to the Saints, besides their integrity.

SECT. IV.
WEll then, if thou would indeed see the unsoundness of thy own heart,
propound such heart sounding Questions as these to thy self.

Quest. 1.
Do I engage my heart to approach unto God in the course of my duties? or do I
go in the round of duties, taking no heed to my heart in them? if so, compare
this symptom of thy Hypocrisy with that in 2 King. 10. 3. and that Ezekiel. 33.
31, 32.

Quest. 2.
Am I not swai'd and moved by self-interest and carnal respects in the ways of
Religion, the accommodation of some worldly interest, or getting a name and
reputation of Godliness? if so, how apparently do the same symptoms of
Hypocrisy appear upon my soul, which did upon Judas, Io^. 12. 6. and John, 2
Kings 9, 13, 14.

Quest. 3.
Have I not some secret reserves in my heart, notwithstanding that face and
appearance of zeal which I put on? certainly if there be any sin that I cannot
part with, any suffering for Christ which I resolve against in my heart: I am
none of his disciple, my heart is not right with God, the searcher of hearts
himself being Judge, Luke 14. 26, 27.

Quest. 4.
What Conscience do I make of secret sins? do I mourn for a vain heart,
wandering thoughts, spiritual deadness? and do I conscientiously abstain from
the practice of secret sins, when there is no danger of discovery, no fear of
forfeiting my reputation by it? is it Gods eye, or man's that awes me from
commission of sin? certainly, if I allow my self in secret sins; I am not of
the number of Gods upright people; whose spirits are of a contrary temper to
mine, Psalm. 119. 113* and Psalm. 19. 12.

SECT. V.
I Will shut up all with five or six concluding Counsels, (which the
Lord-impress upon the heart of him that writes, and those that shall read them)
to preserve and antidote the soul against the dangerous insinuation and Leven
of Hypocrisy.

Counsel 1*
Entreat the Lord night and day for a renewed and right Spirit: all the helps
and directions in the world will not antidote and preserve you from Hypocrisy,
nothing will be found able to keep you right, till sanctification have first
set you right, Ezekiel. 36. 27. I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to
walk in my statutes.

A Bowl may keep by a strait line, so long as the impres^ed force of the hand
that delivered it remains strong upon it; but as that wears off, so its motion
fails; and its own Bias swayes and turns it: a fright of conscience, a pang of
warm affection, or the influence of some great example, or a good education may
influence an unrenewed soul; and push it on in the way of Religion for a
season; but the heart so influenced must and will return to its own natural
course again. And I think there wants nothing but time, or a suitable
temptation to discover the true temper of many a professors spirit; pray
therefore as that holy man did, Psalm. 119. 80. Let my heart be sound in thy
statutes that I be not ashamed.

Counsel 2.
Always suspect and examine your ends in what you do: Sincerity and hypocrisy
lie much ^n your ends and designs: as they are, so are you. The intentions of
the heart lie deep. A man may do the same action to an holy end, and his person
and service be accepted with God; which another doing for a corrupt end, it may
be reckoned his sin; and ^oth his person and service be abhorred by ^he Lord:
we find two men riding in one Chariot, and both of them concerned in the same
expedition; Iehu the son of Nimshi and Ionadab the son of Rechab, 2 Kings 10.
15, 23. but though the work they engaged in was one and the same, yet the
different ends they aimed at, made the same action an excellent duty in
Ionadab, and an act of vile Hypocrisy in Iehu: idem quod duo faciunt, non est
idem: it was the saying of a good soul, commended for a good action; the work
indeed is good, but I fear the ends of it. Self Ends are creeping and
insinuating things into the best actions.

Counsel 3.
Scare your selves with the daily fears of the sin, that is in, and the misery
that will follow hypocrisy: look upon it as the most odious sin in the eyes of
God, and men: to want holiness is bad enough, but to simulate and pretend it
when we have it not, is double impiety: to make Religion the most glorious
thing in the world, a mere stirrup to preserment, and a covert to wickedness;
Oh how vile a thing is it! God made Christ a Sacrifice for sin, and the
Hypocrite will make him a Cloak for sin.

And as to the punishments that follow it, they are suitable to the nature of
the sin ^ for as hypocrisy is out of measure sinful ^ so the reward and
punishment of it, will be out of measure dreadful. Mat. 24. 51. He shall cut
him asunder, and appoint him his portion with hypocrites, there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Counsel 4.
Be daily at work in the mortification of those Lusts that breed hypocrisy.
It Is plain without much sifting, that pride, vain glory, self-love* and a
worldly heart are the seeds out of which this cursed plant springs up in the
souls of men. Dig but to the root, and you shall certainly find these things
there; and ^ill the Lord help you to kill and mortify these, hypocrisy will
spring up in all your duties to God, and in all your converses with men.

Counsel 5.
Attend the native voice of your own consciences in the day of sickness, fear
or trouble, and take special notice of its checks, or upbraidings; which like a
stitch in your side will gird you at such times; Commonly in that lies your
greatest danger: beware of that evil which Conscience brands and marks at such
times, whether it be your living in the practice of ^ome secret sin, or in the
neglect of some known duty: these frights of Conscience mark out the corruption
wherein your danger mostly lies.

Counsel 6. Let us all that profess Religion be uniform and steady in the
profession and practice of it, without politic reserves, and by^ends.

O take heed of this Laodicean neutrality and ^ndifferency which Christ hates:
be ^ure your ground be good, and then be sure you stand your ground. The
Religion of ^ime-servers is but Hypocrisy: they have ^luices in their
Consciences which they can open or shut as occasion requires: every Fox will
have at least two holes to his Den, that if one be stopped, he may escape at the
other. The hypocrite poyseth himself so evenly ^n a mediocrity, that as it was
said of Baldwin, Let Anthony win, let Augustus win, all is one: So let Christ
win, or let Antichrist win, ^e hopes to make every wind that can blow,
^erviceable to wast him to the port of his own interest.

The Hypocrite has always more of the Moon, than of the Sun; little light,
many spots and frequent changes: tit's easier to him to bow ^o the cross, than
to bear the Cross; to sin ^han to suffer.

Our own story tells us of a poor simple woman tha^ lived both in the reigns of
Q. Mary, and Q. Elizabeth; and would constantly say her prayers both in Latin
and English that she might be sure to please one side or other; and let God,
said she, take which likes him best: what is noted as an act of ridiculous
simplicity in her, the time serving hypocrite accounts a point of deep policy
in himself.

The times under Dioclesian were Pagan, under Constantine, Christian; under
Constantius, Arian; under Julian, Apostate; and under Iovian, Christian again:
and all this within the space of seventy years, the age of one man. O what
shifting, and shuffling was there among the men of that generation* the changes
of weather show the unsoundnes^ of men's bodies, and the changes of times, the
unsoundness of their souls.

Christian, if ever thou will manifest and maintain thine integrity, be a man
but of one design, and be sure that be an honest and good design, to secure
heaven whatever becomes of earth: to hold fast integrity, whatever thou art
forced to let go for its sake.

Take heed of pious frauds: certainly it was the Devil that first married those
two words together, for they never did nor can agree betwixt themselves, nor
was ever such a marriage made in heaven.

Never study to model Religion and the exercises thereof in a consistency with,
o^ subserviency to your fleshly interests: if your Religion be but a mock
Religion, your reward shall be but a mock heaven, that is, a real hell.

O the vanity and inutility of these projects and designs! men strive to cast
themselves into such modes, and stint themselves to such measures of Religion,
as they think will best promote, or secure their earthly interests: but it
often falls out contrary to their expectation, their deep policies are
ridiculous follies, they become the grief and shame of their friends, and the
scorn and song of their enemies. And often it fares with them, as with him that
placed himself in the middle of the Table, where he could neither reach the
dish above him, nor that below him, Esuriunt medii, etc. and (which is the very
best of it) if earthly interests be accommodated by sinful neutrality, and a
Laodicean indifferency in Religion, yet no good man should once feel a
temptation to embrace it, except he think what is wanting in the sweetness of
his sleep, may be fully recompensed to him by the stateliness of his bed, and
richer furniture of his Chamber; I mean that a fuller and higher condition in
the world, can make him amends for the loss of his inward peace, and the quiet
repose of a good conscience: these by-ends and self-interests are the little
passages through which hypocrisy creeps in upon the Professors of Religion.

O let this be your rejoicing which was Paul's, the Testimony of your
Conscience, that in all sincerity and godly simplicity, not in fleshly wisdom,
but by the grace of God, you have had your Conversations in this world, 2 Cor.
1. 12.

Let that be your daily prayer and cry to heaven, which was David's, Psalm. 25.
21. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait on thee.

Counsel 7. Keep your hearts day and night under the awe of Gods a^l-seeing
eye: remember he beholds all your ways, and ponders all your thoughts; how
covertly soever hypocrisy may be carried for a time, all must and will out at
last, Luke 12. 3. secrecy is the main inducement to hypocrisy, but it will
fall out with the hypocrite, as it did with Ottocar the King of Bohemia, who
refused to do homage to Rodulphus the Emperor, till at last chastised with
war, he was content to do him homage privately in a Tent: but the Tent was so
contrived by the Emperors servants, that by drawing one Cord it was taken all
away; and so Ottocar presented on his knees doing homage in the view of three
Armies.

Reader, awe thy heart with Gods eye, know that he will bring every secret
thing into Judgment. Thus did Job, and it preserved him, Job. 31. 1, 4. Thus
did David, and it preserved him, Psalm. 18, 21, 22, 23. Thus do thou also, and
it will preserve thee blameless and without guile to the day of Christ*
