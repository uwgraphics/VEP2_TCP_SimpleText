Oates's Bug -- Bug -- Boarding-School, AT CAMBERWELL. A SONG.
To the Tune of, My Lord Russels Farewell.
Writ by J. Dean, Author of the Wine-Cooper. The Hunting of the Fox. The Badger
in the Fox-Trap. The Lord Russel's Farewell. The Loyal Conquest. The Dutch
Miller, etc.
ROuse, Rouse my lazy Mirmidons,
And muster up our Tribe;
See how the Factious Fancies stands,
To trim or cross the Tide:
Invite 'em to my Vaulting School,
The Saints for freedom tell:
How they may live without Control,
With me at Camberwell.
There all Provision shall be made
To entertain the best,
Old Mother Creswel of our Trade,
For to rub down our Guests;
Three Hundred of the briskest Dames,
In Park or Field e're fell:
Whose Amorous Eyes shall charm the flames
O'th Saints at Camberwell.
For my own spending I will keep
Of Boys Three Hundred more,
They are to my Appetite, more sweet
Then Bawd or Bucksome Whore:
The Turks Seraglio we will revive,
He sinks so fast for Hell:
Our English Turks may Plot and thrive,
With me at Camberwell.
That Sacred place shall tempt his Grace,
Once more from Friends to fall:
He Will leave these newfound Sweets to trace
both More-Park and White Hall;
For Gray and Tom 'tshall be their home,
To Kiss Secure and Dwell:
Where every Lass shall have his Grace,
In my sweet Camberwell.
Patience shall from the Cock-loft creep,
And here have free Access:
To Swear and Drink, to Whore and Sleep,
Such Virtues we profess;
Waller his Pots of Venison,
He took for Priests, may sell:
His Amber-Necklaces make known
Our Saints at Camberwell.
Player may meet his Mistress here,
Sometimes Sir Robert's Wife;
They free from care in joys may share,
It may prolong ones Life:
That daring Gibbet before my Gate.
I Will tear him down to Rights;
Because no Emblems of ill Fate,
Shall fright our Amorous Nights.
Argile and Lob, and Ferguson,
And all Absconding Saints;
May safely to their Savior come,
And taste our sweet Contents:
Our largest Rooms to frisk and sport,
Beds round, and Curtains Drawn;
The Life and Sceen of Venus Court,
Excelling Englands Throne.
All naked round the Room we will Dance,
Fine Limbs and Shapes to show:
In pairs by Candlelight advance,
In dazeling postures go;
Here every Man obtains his Choice,
Sister, Madam, or Nell:
We Will have Papilion and Duboyce,
To my sweet Camberwell.
Finis.
