THE CASE OF William Air, Gent Bailiff of the Borough of SOVTHWARK.
THE Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of London being seized of the
Franchise of the said Borough in the Year 1664. by an Instrument under their
Common Seal, did Grant unto the said Air the Execution and Return of all
Writs, Mandates, and Process whatsoever, to be Executed within the said
Borough and Liberties thereof, with all Fees to be due for the same; and also
then made him a Lease of their Prison there called the Compter, and Granted him
all Fees due for Prisoners to be committed to the same, under the Rent of 50 l.
per Annum, with a Covenant therein for him to pay several other Payments,
amounting to 40 l. per Annum more, in all 90 l. per Annum, which the said Air
has hitherto Enjoyed.

That a Bill is brought into the House of Commons, for Erecting of a Court of
Conscience within the said Borough, and all other Places about the said City,
within the Weekly Bills of Mortality; and by that Bill new Officers are
appointed to Execute all Writs and Process to be Issued out of the same Court,
and they to Receive the Fees for the same. Which Bill, if so Passed, will take
from the said Air the greatest part of the Fees to him Granted, as aforesaid,
and he nevertheless Compelled to Pay his said Rent, which would be very Hard
and Injurious; and besides, would take away a great Part of the City of
London's Franchise.

Whereupon Air has put in his Petition to the said House of Commons to be
Considered and Relieved, or that a Day may be appointed him to be heard by his
Council at the Bar of the said House, before the Passing of the said Bill.
