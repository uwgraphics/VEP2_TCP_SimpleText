A PROCLAMATION For preventing the Importation of Foreign Corn in time of
Plenty.
CHARLES R.

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty being advertised, That great quantities of
Corn and Grain are Imported, and more intended to be Imported into this His
Majesty's Kingdom of England; whereby the Liberty for Transportation of Corn
will be rendered useless to His Majesty's Subjects, the Markets clogged, and the
Corn of the Growth of this Kingdom undersold, to the great discouragement of
Tillage and Husbandry, and diminution and abatement of the Rents and Revenues
of this Kingdom. Therefore the Kings most Excellent Majesty, with the Advice of
His Privy Council, for remedy and prevention hereof, Does by this His Royal
Proclamation straightly Forbid and Prohibit all persons whatsoever, Aliens and
Denizens, and all His Majesty's Subjects, from and after the Publishing this
His Proclamation, to Import or cause to be Imported into any part or place of
this Kingdom, any Foreign Corn or Grain, of what nature or kind soever, or to
Utter, Barter, or Sell the same, until His Majesty's Pleasure shall be
declared, or other Order taken, upon pain of forfeiting all that by Law is
Forfeitable, and such other Punishment as by the Prerogative Royal may be
Inflicted upon the Contemners of His Majesty's Royal Authority.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the 29th day of March, in the One and
twentieth year of Our Reign.
